[49:32] you know you can't be on chemo that long
[49:34] now two years and and still be
[49:37] healthy and well
[49:39] that's uh that's impossible
[49:41] but the bible said if you drink any
[49:43] deadly thing it wouldn't hurt you
[49:46] amen so these signs do follow them that
[49:48] believe
[49:49] and we are believers also greetings from
[49:52] brothers sean martin brother andrew
[49:53] glover we were in brother andrew's home
[49:56] and stayed with him preached for brother
[49:58] sean and so we bring back greetings from
[50:00] all of them
[50:02] amen and we're going to read the
[50:03] scripture
[50:05] um and i'll tell you i'll read this
[50:07] verse in exodus chapter
[50:10] 3 and verse eight
[50:12] and we will read death
[50:15] um together
[50:17] and he said and i am come down to
[50:19] deliver them out of the hand of the
[50:21] egyptians
[50:22] to bring them up out of that land and
[50:24] into a good land and large
[50:27] unto a land flowing with milk and honey
[50:31] and to the place of the canaanites the
[50:33] hittites the amorites and the parasites
[50:37] and the hybites and the jebusites god
[50:39] bless you can be seated
[50:42] you know we got a lot of things that are
[50:44] going on in the world that we're living
[50:47] in
[50:48] and i just want to make a
[50:50] few brief statements about that because
[50:52] i believe we are living in perilous
[50:54] times
[50:55] and it is a time that we should all be
[50:58] making our call in an election sure and
[51:02] uh knowing where we stand in this hour
[51:04] taking our stand on the on the word of
[51:07] god
[51:08] and uh just um you know making making
[51:11] sure we have unpacked everything to go
[51:14] amen because brother branham told us in
[51:17] this journey that we're taking
[51:19] we don't pack up to go we unpack
[51:21] we lay aside every sin and every weight
[51:24] that so easily besets us
[51:26] and so um and i you know
[51:28] i know as believers as we
[51:32] know we're in perilous times and there
[51:34] are serious moments in time
[51:36] i'm just like you without you know i i
[51:39] just ponder
[51:40] you know trying to understand what is
[51:42] happening
[51:43] even as um
[51:45] mr biden
[51:46] contemplates sending troops to the
[51:48] ukraine and
[51:51] there is war that is threatened with
[51:53] russia
[51:54] and we know we have seen
[51:56] advancements in science with the
[51:58] driverless car
[52:00] and it is here and i'll be testing on
[52:02] u.s highways
[52:04] and we can see plainly the rise of women
[52:06] and the moral decay of the country and
[52:09] the horrible liberal agenda
[52:12] that is quickly taken away many of our
[52:15] freedoms
[52:16] even as americans
[52:18] and then um you know if kamala is the
[52:22] fulfillment of brother branham's vision
[52:24] of a woman rising in power
[52:27] which i i don't know for certain that is
[52:29] true but if she is
[52:31] she certainly
[52:32] um is a woman who is risen in power and
[52:35] is a vice president as brother branham
[52:37] said i believe that there would be one
[52:40] that would be a vice president or
[52:42] president
[52:44] um and and so but if she is that one
[52:47] well um the next thing will be
[52:50] will be smoke bombs and craters all over
[52:53] the united states of america
[52:56] and the vision did tell us to watch
[52:58] russia to keep your eyes on the king of
[53:00] the north
[53:02] and never in our u.s history have we
[53:04] seen such a weak and pandering president
[53:10] it's at such a time as this that
[53:12] russia could certainly make her move and
[53:15] be able to do this brother branham
[53:17] always felt the bombs would come from
[53:19] russia
[53:20] and said so but the vision and the
[53:23] vision i can't find were in those seven
[53:26] visions that he was actually told where
[53:28] the bombs would come from but it's a
[53:30] self s
[53:32] a safe assumption i guess
[53:34] um since we're told to watch russia and
[53:36] keep our eyes on the king of the north
[53:39] i do know this
[53:40] we are in overtime
[53:44] and the last stages come and his
[53:46] messenger is gone
[53:48] and now we are been here as long as he
[53:50] was here
[53:52] he died at 56 and now has been gone for
[53:54] 56 years
[53:56] and surely we're at the end
[53:58] but i want to just say he will have a
[54:00] bride
[54:01] who has made herself ready who's putting
[54:04] on the righteousness of the saints
[54:07] and so this is the hour that we're
[54:08] living in i think i that would be
[54:12] what we should be doing in this hour
[54:14] making
[54:15] preparations to leave
[54:18] not exactly knowing how everything will
[54:20] come to pass
[54:21] but every word of god will come to pass
[54:25] and so we are standing here looking by
[54:28] faith and faith is a long arranged
[54:30] vision and we're trying to look in
[54:32] through the the gloom and the darkness
[54:34] of this age to understand what is going
[54:36] on in this hour
[54:38] but um i'm glad that we know in whom we
[54:42] have believed
[54:43] and we are assured of that and i know
[54:46] that we're making preparations you know
[54:48] there is another dimension
[54:51] i know there is beyond a shadow of a
[54:53] doubt
[54:54] i stood there many years ago as a little
[54:58] boy
[54:58] in brother branham's meetings
[55:01] and i saw him
[55:03] i saw him
[55:04] pull from another dimension of an angel
[55:07] of god that and i couldn't see
[55:10] sometimes men would be privileged to see
[55:12] them
[55:13] um and see the angel of god or the
[55:16] pillar of fire and it was seen many many
[55:18] times and
[55:19] and witnessed
[55:21] but at the same time
[55:23] you know for the most part many would
[55:26] sit there and never saw it
[55:27] that didn't mean they wasn't spiritual
[55:29] that means that god didn't open their
[55:31] eyes to it
[55:32] and so in this um i just want to say
[55:36] that
[55:36] i i saw it speak from that other
[55:39] dimension things of people's hearts
[55:42] um discerning the thoughts and intents
[55:45] of the heart
[55:46] and
[55:47] beyond that i i know that i received a
[55:50] birth from that other dimension
[55:52] so i know that dimension is real
[55:55] even though you may not see it
[55:58] there either because when man fell we
[56:02] become subject just to the five senses
[56:04] of the flesh and lost the
[56:07] the clarity of our spiritual sense that
[56:09] adam had when
[56:10] when god come and walked among them
[56:13] and and so you know we
[56:16] we look through a glass darkly as the
[56:19] bible said
[56:20] and but however we know there is a land
[56:23] we know there is that dimension we may
[56:26] not we may be able to see into the in
[56:28] the clear blue yonder there and maybe
[56:30] see a star from
[56:32] millions of miles away whatever they say
[56:34] that they are i have to take i have to
[56:37] take their word for it because i'd never
[56:39] been there and never measured it
[56:41] but nevertheless how many how far away
[56:44] it is you know we can see there and say
[56:46] well i don't see that dimension but you
[56:49] see i know that dimension is real
[56:52] and i know that there are things that
[56:54] have happened in this age
[56:56] from that dimension it happened to me
[56:58] from that dimension
[57:00] and so we know that we're we've got a
[57:03] place that we're going to and we know
[57:06] that one day that those from that
[57:08] dimension will come here and we will be
[57:11] changed when we see them and we'll be
[57:13] caught up to meet the lord in the air
[57:16] and they again the world won't even see
[57:18] that it'll be a dimension unknown to the
[57:22] rest of them
[57:23] so today as we
[57:25] prepare let's just um
[57:28] get ready to meet the lord
[57:30] you know we may not understand
[57:32] everything that's going on in the world
[57:34] and and
[57:35] what science is doing what
[57:38] the liberal politics is doing where that
[57:40] will lead us to with uh the marxism that
[57:43] we're seeing the the wormy eating and
[57:46] the
[57:46] in the nation with with communism and
[57:49] with socialism and we may not be able to
[57:52] see everything clearly on every on every
[57:55] aspect of it but one thing we can see
[57:57] clear
[57:58] and that is we have been born again
[58:01] from another world
[58:03] and we're predestined for that world
[58:06] so let's just press on this morning with
[58:09] all our hearts i want you to turn with
[58:11] me to deuteronomy chapter eight and
[58:14] verse seven
[58:15] i'm going to minister on something that
[58:18] while i was preaching my new year's
[58:20] sermon i struck a point of inspiration
[58:23] of the on the good land of the bible
[58:25] that we have returned to by malachi 4
[58:28] and i want to talk about that this
[58:29] morning
[58:30] as we just pick up that little
[58:33] little bit of inspiration and look at
[58:35] that i have other things that i'm
[58:37] looking at in this same thought
[58:39] they are our purpose but today we're
[58:42] going to be speaking on the return
[58:44] to the flow of milk and honey
[58:47] so there is um
[58:49] you know we're going to be speaking
[58:51] real clearly about the land
[58:54] the land
[58:56] it flowing
[58:57] and and then the return to that land
[59:01] and the land gushing forth its waters
[59:04] and its riches and then we're going to
[59:06] be speaking about the milk and honey
[59:09] that we have as believers so in
[59:12] deuteronomy chapter 8 and verse 7 for
[59:15] the lord thy god bringeth thee into a
[59:17] good lamb
[59:18] a land of brooks of water
[59:21] of fountains of and depths that spring
[59:24] out of valleys and hills
[59:26] a land of wheat
[59:28] and barley and vines and fig trees and
[59:31] pomegranate
[59:33] a land of olive oil olive and honey
[59:36] a land
[59:38] wherein thou shalt eat bread without
[59:40] scarceness
[59:41] thou shalt not lack
[59:44] anything in it i want you to get catch
[59:46] this what it's saying bread
[59:49] without scarceness
[59:52] thou shalt not lock
[59:54] anything in it
[59:55] a land whose stones are iron and out of
[59:58] heels that make us dig brass
[1:00:01] so here he's telling them
[1:00:03] that there is um a land that you're
[1:00:06] going to
[1:00:07] and it has every kind of thing within it
[1:00:11] that is necessary
[1:00:13] for your
[1:00:14] to sustain you upon the earth whether it
[1:00:16] be brass or iron or the bread
[1:00:20] or whatever it is you will not lack of
[1:00:23] of wheat or barley or vines and fig
[1:00:27] trees or pomegranates or olive oil or
[1:00:30] honey you're not going to like anything
[1:00:33] this land has got a land of abundance
[1:00:37] in the and the land in that land it
[1:00:40] flows freely now malachite 4 speaks of
[1:00:44] restoration
[1:00:45] it speaks of turning the heart back to
[1:00:48] the faith so it's a return
[1:00:51] it is not something new
[1:00:53] and and let me just say
[1:00:55] when they would leave egypt to go to the
[1:00:57] promised land they were not going to a
[1:01:00] different land than that of abraham
[1:01:02] isaac and jacob but they were going to
[1:01:04] the land of their fathers
[1:01:06] amen
[1:01:07] and it's it's to a place of faith
[1:01:10] where the i am god was found and and
[1:01:13] where he revealed himself and where he
[1:01:16] has revealed himself as el shaddai
[1:01:19] more than enough
[1:01:21] how many found he's more than enough
[1:01:24] and he's a lie is a land where new names
[1:01:27] are given
[1:01:28] and you don't live by names of like
[1:01:31] abram but you're given a new letter to
[1:01:34] your name and that new letter in itself
[1:01:37] represented god coming down into the
[1:01:39] name of abram
[1:01:40] and there it would be god himself coming
[1:01:43] down into him
[1:01:45] renewing his body changing him
[1:01:49] where that he could bring forth the
[1:01:51] promised son because the bible said his
[1:01:53] body was now dead
[1:01:55] is that right amen so again it will come
[1:01:59] down it will be god himself and the
[1:02:02] promised son
[1:02:03] and remember it's in that as we parallel
[1:02:06] it just a moment where the 2000 year old
[1:02:09] woman the church comes to life again and
[1:02:12] brings forth the messiah
[1:02:14] amen the hour the time where
[1:02:17] there is no baroness among us but where
[1:02:20] that we the church brings forth life
[1:02:24] are you with me
[1:02:25] now and we're an unbelieving old church
[1:02:28] a baron sarah or sarah has changed to
[1:02:31] sarah again god taken the h which would
[1:02:35] represent his his own self in that
[1:02:38] character a part of his own name and
[1:02:41] putting it in in the name of sarah
[1:02:43] changing her name and he would come down
[1:02:46] in her notice and turn
[1:02:48] her heart back to believing again
[1:02:51] and given her the promised son
[1:02:54] and where this is a line where jacobs
[1:02:57] are changed from deceiver
[1:03:00] amen a deceiver a liar a thief a you
[1:03:04] know a a horrible person a betrayer are
[1:03:07] you with me amen and would be changed
[1:03:10] from from that to israel a prince
[1:03:14] it's a royalty because the change
[1:03:17] doesn't come by reformation or by
[1:03:20] psychology but by a supernatural
[1:03:23] visitation from the almighty god
[1:03:26] now years after the return from egypt we
[1:03:30] know that that israel would be dispersed
[1:03:32] into babylon and and would return again
[1:03:35] and rebuild the temple and which would
[1:03:37] restore them back to worship again
[1:03:41] ezra would come and bring back the word
[1:03:43] and the bible would be known and and the
[1:03:46] people would rejoice as the book was
[1:03:48] open
[1:03:49] and god would show zechariah seven
[1:03:53] golden candlesticks
[1:03:55] and he showed that they were supplied
[1:03:58] with unlimited oil
[1:04:01] from two olive trees
[1:04:04] notice this because this parallels our
[1:04:06] day we also have been shown
[1:04:09] seven golden candle sticks
[1:04:11] and we've been shown that the same quad
[1:04:14] that has been here in one age would
[1:04:16] light the fire in the next stage
[1:04:19] and as it was lit from there would go to
[1:04:21] the next and would go to the next and so
[1:04:24] zechariah was 14 and 4 and 6 says this
[1:04:27] is the word of the lord to jerubal
[1:04:30] saying not by might nor by power but by
[1:04:34] my spirit saith the lord who art thou
[1:04:37] great o great mountain before zerubbabel
[1:04:40] thou shall become a plain and he shall
[1:04:42] bring forth the headstones of it thereof
[1:04:44] was shouting saying grace grace unto it
[1:04:49] there's great favor that has been given
[1:04:52] to this age to this time showing us the
[1:04:55] seven golden candlesticks and god
[1:04:58] working down to the ages but he would
[1:05:01] show that again it was done
[1:05:03] with an
[1:05:04] unlimited supply and i want to give
[1:05:07] these thoughts to you as we go because
[1:05:10] it flows with milk and honey it's a
[1:05:13] unlimited supply
[1:05:16] and i want to remind our church this
[1:05:17] morning as we go into the new year that
[1:05:20] god's supply is limitless
[1:05:23] that there's more than enough
[1:05:26] and that he's here in this age and this
[1:05:29] time with with not just grace but double
[1:05:32] grace
[1:05:33] the favor of god upon a people in this
[1:05:37] end time to bring them into a rapture an
[1:05:40] hour
[1:05:41] this is so important that we never
[1:05:44] forget that what we have is unlimited
[1:05:48] the capstone of course that is spoke of
[1:05:51] um is threefold it is the capping off of
[1:05:54] all the mysteries of god that's what the
[1:05:56] seven thunders were amen there would be
[1:05:59] the final revelation given to the church
[1:06:02] and in doing so it would it would give
[1:06:04] an unlimited supply like luther was
[1:06:07] limited to justification the few things
[1:06:10] that he understood and wesley was
[1:06:12] sanctification the few things he
[1:06:14] understood and pentecost was they they
[1:06:17] had their their revelation that they
[1:06:20] have but it was all limited
[1:06:22] but i want you to know that what you
[1:06:24] have received is an unlimited
[1:06:27] resource
[1:06:28] amen we can never run out of sermons we
[1:06:32] can never run out of material we can
[1:06:35] never run out of spiritual food
[1:06:38] and man because it's an unlimited supply
[1:06:42] you see again it's the cap and off of
[1:06:44] all the mysteries of god he will bring
[1:06:47] forth the headstone the capstone
[1:06:50] amen with grace grace
[1:06:53] other ages receive grace
[1:06:55] but this age receives a capstone with
[1:06:58] double grace double favor are you with
[1:07:02] me amen now it's also the capping off of
[1:07:04] the individual for the individual but
[1:07:07] the capstone is the holy ghost
[1:07:10] and so it's a finishing stone that must
[1:07:13] seal every believer so with that again
[1:07:16] it's an unlimited supply
[1:07:19] it's not a portion of the spirit
[1:07:23] somebody help me preach now it's not
[1:07:25] just justification or sanctification a
[1:07:28] dip of the spirit or a little release of
[1:07:30] it but this is where god empties it out
[1:07:34] this is where the fullness comes this is
[1:07:36] where that the people are being capped
[1:07:38] off with the token that gets them ready
[1:07:41] for a rapture that laying within them is
[1:07:44] rapturing faith because the holy ghost
[1:07:47] is lying within them
[1:07:49] and finally we come back to the final
[1:07:52] capstone of the church which is jesus
[1:07:55] christ physically to take away his
[1:07:57] people
[1:07:58] other ages have had him in portion
[1:08:02] other ages has had him you know in um
[1:08:06] as we said portions of the holy spirit
[1:08:08] being poured out and they saw him as the
[1:08:12] spirit of god the spirit of jesus but i
[1:08:14] want you to know this age will be capped
[1:08:16] off with the physical return of jesus
[1:08:20] christ
[1:08:21] that means all the fullness of god
[1:08:24] manifest it so we're not in the age of
[1:08:28] portion
[1:08:29] we're in the age of double portion
[1:08:32] hallelujah the age of double portion
[1:08:36] what others had in the portion you
[1:08:38] receive a double portion of it
[1:08:40] but let me tell you the finish will come
[1:08:43] and that mighty capstone will come not
[1:08:45] by might nor by power but by my spirit
[1:08:49] saith the lord of hosts when it comes to
[1:08:52] capping off the mysteries god didn't use
[1:08:54] a theologian to bring it
[1:08:56] he didn't unless he tried to shape it
[1:08:59] with his own hands
[1:09:01] are you with me for the capstone had to
[1:09:04] be a stone that was cut out without
[1:09:07] hands
[1:09:08] are you with me no theologian put his
[1:09:11] hand to it
[1:09:12] it wasn't man's ideas
[1:09:15] it came from the almighty god it came
[1:09:17] from the very thoughts of god this was
[1:09:20] not a man's portion this is a god
[1:09:22] portion and god is pouring out his
[1:09:25] fullness and opening up the word in his
[1:09:27] fullness showing light on things that
[1:09:30] were never seen before
[1:09:33] do you realize how blessed you are
[1:09:36] amen that light has now shown on things
[1:09:39] other ages did not we're not privy to
[1:09:42] and an understanding that has come
[1:09:45] you know who the seventh ages or or the
[1:09:48] seven churches represent as seven ages
[1:09:51] you know the names of the messengers
[1:09:54] is that right amen you know what the
[1:09:56] thunder's uttered
[1:09:58] you know now the seals have been
[1:09:59] revealed you know now the contents of
[1:10:02] the book you understand and you can see
[1:10:05] what predestination is others have that
[1:10:07] importion
[1:10:09] but we don't have it in portion
[1:10:11] others understood it in you know through
[1:10:14] a glass darkly but god is taking the
[1:10:16] veil off of it
[1:10:18] amen to reveal it and it's complete
[1:10:21] amen so you see again it was not by my
[1:10:26] might nor by power but it was by my
[1:10:29] spirit
[1:10:30] and my man's power didn't bring it man's
[1:10:33] understanding didn't bring it but it was
[1:10:36] by god's spirit and the same thing with
[1:10:38] the baptism of the holy ghost it wasn't
[1:10:41] man-made it wasn't shaking a hand of a
[1:10:43] preacher
[1:10:45] it wasn't joining a church it didn't
[1:10:47] come from a mental ascent to the message
[1:10:51] being true
[1:10:52] that's not how it came it didn't come by
[1:10:55] might it didn't come by men's thinking
[1:10:57] it was not a theologian
[1:11:00] amen but it was by my spirit saith the
[1:11:03] lord of hosts i'm captain of the people
[1:11:06] i'm bringing them to knowledge of the
[1:11:08] truth
[1:11:09] now so as we look at this this morning i
[1:11:12] want you to see
[1:11:13] that that again it will not be creeds of
[1:11:15] man that brings jesus christ back
[1:11:19] amen it won't be man's ideas or man's
[1:11:22] ways and man won't bring it theologians
[1:11:25] can't
[1:11:28] but by my spirit
[1:11:29] so to be an outpouring of the holy ghost
[1:11:32] that brings forth the dead in christ
[1:11:34] changes our body and causes a bride to
[1:11:37] be raptured
[1:11:40] but he'll bring forth the headstones
[1:11:42] thereof shouting
[1:11:44] with grace grace
[1:11:46] unto it
[1:11:47] it's a return to the land it's a calling
[1:11:50] out of egypt after sojourning in a
[1:11:53] strange land a land that is
[1:11:55] you know that is
[1:11:58] you see egypt was a land that was so
[1:12:00] different from the land of the apostles
[1:12:05] trying to get trying to make a parallel
[1:12:07] here amen follow my thinking as we you
[1:12:10] know don't let me throw you for a curve
[1:12:11] we know we know that egypt was never the
[1:12:14] land of the apostles
[1:12:16] but again that's where we were we were
[1:12:18] in spiritual bondage
[1:12:19] and man and god called us out where back
[1:12:22] to a land what land the land of the
[1:12:24] apostles
[1:12:26] the land of our fathers for israel it
[1:12:28] was abraham isaac and jacob for us it's
[1:12:32] the land of jesus peter paul
[1:12:35] james john
[1:12:36] are you with me this is the land that we
[1:12:39] have been returned to
[1:12:41] and and egypt was was a land of multiple
[1:12:44] gods
[1:12:45] and trinities of god where were three
[1:12:49] unclean spirits like frogs come out of
[1:12:52] the mouth of false prophets
[1:12:55] are you with me
[1:12:56] now anything that makes jesus less than
[1:12:59] god or secondary god is an unclean
[1:13:02] spirit
[1:13:04] amen but now we have returned
[1:13:07] and to do that god would send elijah the
[1:13:10] prophet
[1:13:12] now i want you to just place this here
[1:13:15] for a moment
[1:13:16] but i we're going to look at a couple of
[1:13:18] parallels
[1:13:19] because you know that
[1:13:21] moses and elijah will appear to the jews
[1:13:24] as the two witnesses
[1:13:26] amen but also we have seen we have seen
[1:13:30] the moses ministry and the elijah
[1:13:32] ministry
[1:13:34] you see his double grace
[1:13:38] somebody with me amen i want you to turn
[1:13:40] with him in malachi 4 and let's look at
[1:13:42] verse 4. let's just see not only does he
[1:13:45] speak of elijah he speaks of moses
[1:13:48] this is here before the coming of the
[1:13:50] great and dreadful day of the lord
[1:13:52] that's why those are wrong who thinks
[1:13:55] that that the two witnesses will be
[1:13:57] enoch and elijah because again malachi 4
[1:14:02] specifically says
[1:14:03] moses and elijah
[1:14:06] but i want you to see it here malachi 4
[1:14:08] 4 remember ye the law of my of moses my
[1:14:12] servant which i commanded in the unto
[1:14:15] him in horeb for all of israel and with
[1:14:17] the statues and the judgment behold i
[1:14:20] will send you elijah the prophet before
[1:14:23] the coming of the great and dreadful day
[1:14:25] of the lord and he shall turn
[1:14:28] remember our texts now return
[1:14:32] he shall turn the hearts of the fathers
[1:14:34] returning the hearts of the fathers to
[1:14:37] the children and the heart of the
[1:14:38] children to their fathers lest i come
[1:14:41] and smite the earth with a curse
[1:14:44] so did you notice verse 4
[1:14:47] he says remember or think
[1:14:50] moses
[1:14:52] but i'm sending you elijah
[1:14:55] want you to think moses but it's elijah
[1:14:59] i'm sending
[1:15:00] and i'm sending you elijah for the
[1:15:03] return for the turning back of the heart
[1:15:06] to the faith of the fathers
[1:15:09] so there is to be by elijah a returning
[1:15:12] back of the hearts of the children to
[1:15:14] the faith of the fathers and never
[1:15:16] forget
[1:15:17] god sending elijah is to turn our hearts
[1:15:22] back
[1:15:23] remember this is what he had to do with
[1:15:25] sarah turn her heart to believing
[1:15:30] amen
[1:15:31] now you know she started out as a young
[1:15:34] woman no doubt believing
[1:15:36] but as it went on she became less
[1:15:38] believing
[1:15:40] until she finally decided she couldn't
[1:15:42] do it let a hagar do it
[1:15:45] you see again then she got where she was
[1:15:47] past age and said it's totally
[1:15:49] impossible
[1:15:51] is that right she totally had lost her
[1:15:54] faith
[1:15:55] this was the condition of the church we
[1:15:58] had totally lost our faith
[1:16:01] amen but elijah returns us back to faith
[1:16:05] by the angel
[1:16:07] sarah's heart was turned back to
[1:16:09] believing again
[1:16:11] now as brother branham told us he said
[1:16:13] god promises church a spiritual a
[1:16:16] scriptural sign he said the resurrection
[1:16:19] would be reproduced jesus christ and his
[1:16:22] church would become so there would be
[1:16:24] one in the last days he promised it now
[1:16:26] we know that's true now he also promised
[1:16:28] there would be a restoring of the faith
[1:16:31] we read over jude earnestly contend for
[1:16:34] the faith that was once delivered to the
[1:16:37] saints now we're promised in malachi 4
[1:16:40] by the same system he always did which
[1:16:42] was a prophet that we would be restored
[1:16:45] back to the original faith oh my
[1:16:48] back to the original seed
[1:16:50] back to the seed like it began on the
[1:16:53] day of pentecost back to the same
[1:16:56] doctrine
[1:16:57] word by word
[1:16:59] power by power spirit this by the same
[1:17:02] thing just exactly like it was back in
[1:17:05] the beginning through signs and wonders
[1:17:07] of the living presence of jesus christ
[1:17:10] after 2 000 years he's still alive
[1:17:13] and he's the same yesterday today and
[1:17:15] forever
[1:17:16] so again think moses what was it about
[1:17:19] moses an angel appearing in a pillar of
[1:17:21] fire
[1:17:22] getting a commission
[1:17:24] not from an egyptian
[1:17:26] not from pharaoh not from the
[1:17:29] theologians but the commissioner prophet
[1:17:32] by an angel
[1:17:33] giving him a message
[1:17:35] a message to satan let my people go
[1:17:39] and a call to the elect come out of her
[1:17:42] my people
[1:17:43] that you be not partakers of our plagues
[1:17:47] oh church don't you know that call
[1:17:49] consummates
[1:17:50] in a bride leaving from here
[1:17:53] the plans are falling they're they're
[1:17:56] coming around we see pre-tribulation
[1:17:58] plagues already
[1:18:00] that are that have been bred in
[1:18:02] laboratories now released killing
[1:18:05] million now
[1:18:06] are you with me but i want to tell you
[1:18:09] before the plagues can strike there's
[1:18:11] got to be a people
[1:18:14] that are prepared to leave here
[1:18:16] they've heard a call they said cut out
[1:18:18] of her my people
[1:18:20] be separate saith the lord that you paid
[1:18:23] that you protect not plagues
[1:18:28] now those that are leaving egypt
[1:18:32] could say
[1:18:33] we're leaving the slavery of egypt
[1:18:35] there's not going to be no more weapons
[1:18:39] no more doing penance
[1:18:41] no more popes
[1:18:43] no more bishops
[1:18:44] no more false gods of the nile
[1:18:47] we're going to a land of freedom
[1:18:50] we're going back to the land and the god
[1:18:52] of our fathers we're going to the land
[1:18:55] of abraham isaac and jacob to a land
[1:18:58] that gushes
[1:19:00] flows grasses
[1:19:02] with milk and honey there's not just a
[1:19:05] little bit of this
[1:19:06] unlimited supply
[1:19:09] hallelujah amen so think moses
[1:19:12] but it won't be moses it'll be elijah
[1:19:16] and as elijah turned the hearts of the
[1:19:19] children of israel from following baal
[1:19:22] by being vindicated by a pillar of fire
[1:19:24] so will the last day elijah turn the
[1:19:26] hearts of the children back to the true
[1:19:29] and living god
[1:19:31] amen he'll not bring a new worship but
[1:19:34] he'll restore the old altar
[1:19:40] you remember when moses or excuse me
[1:19:43] when elijah there in that showdown
[1:19:46] he didn't go and build a new altar
[1:19:48] he returned to the altar
[1:19:51] he got the neglected stones
[1:19:54] of truth
[1:19:56] we don't have a message different from
[1:19:58] paul
[1:20:00] amen we've got the gospel of jesus
[1:20:03] christ it was as paul said it's my
[1:20:06] gospel
[1:20:08] the gospel of christ according to my
[1:20:10] gospel
[1:20:11] so if you'll see we have been returned
[1:20:14] back to the true gospel again
[1:20:17] look when when israel was
[1:20:19] in in this modern day was they were
[1:20:22] offered the land do you know they tried
[1:20:24] to get them to take the land of uganda
[1:20:27] so we'll settle you all there you know
[1:20:29] there's arabs there and they you know
[1:20:31] hittites and jebusites and all other
[1:20:33] kind of people wanting that land
[1:20:36] and they have vowed to keep you out of
[1:20:37] it but we'll just we'll just overrun
[1:20:39] uganda we'll give that to you and the
[1:20:42] jews can all settle in uganda there was
[1:20:44] no promise of god for uganda
[1:20:48] amen that was not their roots
[1:20:50] that was not their promised land
[1:20:53] and they had been given a promised land
[1:20:56] and it wasn't uganda
[1:20:58] it was it was a it was the land of zion
[1:21:02] it was a jerusalem
[1:21:04] it was it was a land of palestine
[1:21:07] and yet everybody was one to keep them
[1:21:09] from it
[1:21:10] but god swore i'm going to bring them
[1:21:13] back home
[1:21:14] and god has swore i'm bringing a pride
[1:21:17] back to her original place
[1:21:20] amen she she will be exactly in the land
[1:21:23] of her fathers
[1:21:25] not in the land of a stranger not in the
[1:21:28] land of uganda but the land of your
[1:21:31] fathers
[1:21:32] the land of paul the land of peter the
[1:21:35] land of james and john the place where
[1:21:38] jesus walked and all the old testament
[1:21:41] saints i'm bringing you back to that
[1:21:43] land
[1:21:47] now so
[1:21:49] elijah would not institute a new worship
[1:21:52] but he would restore the old altar
[1:21:55] he would be vindicated by a pillar of
[1:21:58] fire
[1:21:59] that that
[1:22:00] proved
[1:22:01] that this was no gimmicks
[1:22:05] no deception
[1:22:08] put barrels of water on the wood
[1:22:10] put it all over the sacrifice
[1:22:13] i want them to know this is no trickery
[1:22:16] and god would want you to know science
[1:22:19] themselves would have to validate the
[1:22:21] light struck the
[1:22:22] lens is that right
[1:22:25] over and over thousands upon thousands
[1:22:27] upon thousands of times it would the
[1:22:30] discernment would come to prove the word
[1:22:32] was among us
[1:22:35] amen what was it god was making you know
[1:22:38] this is no deception
[1:22:41] this is this is no gimmick
[1:22:44] am i put the water on the wood put it on
[1:22:46] the sacrifice this is no trickery
[1:22:50] and then visions were given to the
[1:22:52] prophet because he said i've done all of
[1:22:54] this at your command
[1:22:58] so he did it all by vision
[1:23:01] notice taking stones did you know in the
[1:23:04] old testament when they built an altar
[1:23:06] no man was able you know they could not
[1:23:08] put cut stones on the altar
[1:23:11] they had to be uncut stones
[1:23:15] somebody with me
[1:23:16] the reason why a man's hand could not
[1:23:19] tool it
[1:23:20] every revelation that goes in our
[1:23:22] worship
[1:23:23] cannot be tooled by man
[1:23:26] it can't come from seminaries it has to
[1:23:29] come from just saith the lord
[1:23:33] amen it'll be exactly as i made it
[1:23:38] amen
[1:23:39] now turn with me to first kings 18 and
[1:23:42] verse 36
[1:23:44] now and it came to pass
[1:23:46] at the time of the offering of the
[1:23:48] evening sacrifice notice is evening time
[1:23:52] in the last days when elijah comes that
[1:23:55] elijah the prophet came near and said
[1:23:58] lord god of abraham isaac and israel let
[1:24:02] it be known this day that thou art god
[1:24:04] in israel and that i am thy servant and
[1:24:07] that i have done all these things that
[1:24:09] thy word
[1:24:11] hear me o lord hear me that this people
[1:24:13] may know that thou art god
[1:24:16] and that thou has turned their heart
[1:24:19] back again
[1:24:20] you see as elijah turns the hearts back
[1:24:24] they were they were all following baal
[1:24:27] but they're coming of the ministry of
[1:24:29] elijah's turn our hearts back
[1:24:32] to the original faith
[1:24:34] come back to that with that they may
[1:24:36] know thou art the lord god and that thou
[1:24:40] hast turn their heart back again and
[1:24:43] then the fire of the lord fell
[1:24:47] and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the
[1:24:49] wood and the stones and the dust and
[1:24:52] licked up the water that was in the
[1:24:54] trench and when all the people saw it
[1:24:56] they fell on their faces and they said
[1:24:58] the lord he is the god the lord he is
[1:25:02] the god
[1:25:04] notice it comes back around they begin
[1:25:06] to know who the true and living god is
[1:25:11] amen the creeds are gone baal is gone
[1:25:15] every other god's out of the picture
[1:25:18] baptist gods methodist gods presbyterian
[1:25:21] gods all out of the picture
[1:25:23] [Music]
[1:25:24] amen because why elijah by a pillar of
[1:25:28] fire turned their hearts back again
[1:25:31] now unfortunately israel would rebel
[1:25:33] time and time again until finally they
[1:25:36] rejected and
[1:25:37] crucified their messiah
[1:25:40] their savior and at last they were
[1:25:42] dispersed
[1:25:44] among the nations
[1:25:46] but now we see a return of them after 2
[1:25:48] 000 years back to their homeland
[1:25:52] and similarly the the church has
[1:25:54] rebelled and fallen away until she's
[1:25:57] been dispersed among the denominations
[1:26:00] but i want you to know the return of
[1:26:03] israel
[1:26:04] shows a great parallel between the
[1:26:06] natural seed the nation of israel and
[1:26:09] the royal seed the bride of christ
[1:26:12] what god has done for the natural seed
[1:26:14] in reestablishing them in the land he's
[1:26:17] also doing for the royal seed
[1:26:20] amen and neither can be blessed outside
[1:26:23] of their promised land
[1:26:25] if you want to be blessed get back in
[1:26:27] the promised land
[1:26:29] amen it's only there we can be blessed
[1:26:32] and when they brought them there from
[1:26:33] the babylonian dispersal back to israel
[1:26:37] zechariah 13 1 prophesies in that day
[1:26:41] there shall be a fountain opened
[1:26:44] amen to the house of david to the
[1:26:46] inhabitants of jerusalem for your
[1:26:49] unbelief and your uncleanness
[1:26:52] amen what is a fountain
[1:26:56] opened
[1:26:58] not a cistern found
[1:27:00] we we found the cistern of of um
[1:27:03] hezekiah we found the cisterns of one of
[1:27:06] the kings or we found the cisterns and
[1:27:09] the baptists and the methodists where
[1:27:11] they stored water and they become leaky
[1:27:14] vessels and they're all out or what's
[1:27:16] there is stagnated
[1:27:18] amen but here when he comes back to your
[1:27:21] land a fountain is open
[1:27:25] and that's what i want to get to you
[1:27:27] today there's been a fountain open
[1:27:30] a fountain of an unlimited supply
[1:27:34] it can't run out you don't have to pump
[1:27:37] it up
[1:27:38] amen you don't have to sweat and and
[1:27:41] toil to get it it's there it's for you
[1:27:44] to drink from it's there to to give you
[1:27:48] what you need in the hour whether it's
[1:27:50] sin and for uncleanness whatever it is
[1:27:54] the washing of the water of the word
[1:27:56] will cleanse you from unbelief
[1:28:02] now when god puts his spirit in you it's
[1:28:04] a flowing fountain
[1:28:08] now i want you to remember
[1:28:10] they go to physical land your land is
[1:28:12] the holy ghost
[1:28:17] your land is the holy ghost
[1:28:19] so everything in the holy ghost whether
[1:28:21] it's the bible the word the bible the
[1:28:23] truth or whatever it is whether it's
[1:28:24] healing deliverance whatever is all in
[1:28:26] the holy ghost
[1:28:28] so your land is the holy ghost the
[1:28:31] kingdom of god is not meat and drink but
[1:28:34] it's righteousness peace and joy where
[1:28:37] in the
[1:28:39] holy ghost
[1:28:40] so there's it in that land is where we
[1:28:43] find righteousness peace and joy
[1:28:46] outside that land we're not blessed
[1:28:49] and you will never be blessed until you
[1:28:52] come fully into the baptism of the holy
[1:28:54] ghost
[1:28:55] now
[1:28:56] but notice in jeremiah chapter 2 and
[1:28:59] verse 13 can you put that up for me

[1:29:07] they have forsaken me here's the two
[1:29:10] evils now they forsaken me
[1:29:13] the fountain of living waters now look
[1:29:15] how he identifies himself he said i am
[1:29:18] not just water
[1:29:20] i'm living water flowing water and i'm a
[1:29:24] fountain it gushes out
[1:29:28] goodness
[1:29:29] mercy
[1:29:30] healing deliverance all comes from him
[1:29:36] and he said you forsake me the fountain
[1:29:39] of living water and you viewed out
[1:29:42] here's a second sin you've hewed out
[1:29:44] cisterns
[1:29:45] broken cisterns that can hold no water
[1:29:49] and this is the era of denomination
[1:29:51] today they've chewed out their cisterns
[1:29:54] where they used to have revival but it's
[1:29:57] all leaked out and the revival is gone
[1:30:01] amen but god didn't give us another
[1:30:03] sister
[1:30:05] i want you to get the stock here it
[1:30:07] flows
[1:30:08] it flows it's he is a fountain of living
[1:30:13] water there's no little flow out of it
[1:30:16] it's unlimited
[1:30:19] amen notice in jeremiah 17 verse 13
[1:30:23] and he says oh lord the hope of israel
[1:30:27] all that for safety shall be ashamed and
[1:30:30] they that depart from me shall be
[1:30:32] written in the earth because they have
[1:30:34] forsaken the lord the fountain of living
[1:30:38] waters again he's showing the fountain
[1:30:41] of living waters this is me the lord
[1:30:44] and then we find what comes out of that
[1:30:46] fountain heal me o lord and i will be
[1:30:49] healed
[1:30:50] save me and i will be saved for thou art
[1:30:53] my praise
[1:30:55] this is what comes out of the fountain
[1:30:58] healing for the body and healing for the
[1:31:00] soul
[1:31:03] hallelujah amen so he said i'm the
[1:31:06] fountain and they've forsaken me but he
[1:31:09] said if you'll turn back to god if your
[1:31:12] heart had turned back you'll find heal
[1:31:14] in there you'll find salvation there
[1:31:19] now zechariah 14 and verse 6
[1:31:21] and it shall come to pass in that day
[1:31:24] that the light shall not be clear or
[1:31:25] dark
[1:31:27] zechariah 14 7 but it shall be one day
[1:31:30] which shall be known to the lord
[1:31:33] not day nor night
[1:31:35] but it shall come to pass at the evening
[1:31:38] time it shall be light can you place
[1:31:41] yourself right there right now how many
[1:31:43] nodes we're in the evening light
[1:31:45] amen it's a time of darkness
[1:31:48] but light comes upon the word
[1:31:50] so brother tim well why don't you
[1:31:52] understand everything that's happening
[1:31:54] in the world today because the light's
[1:31:56] on the word
[1:31:58] it's not on politics
[1:32:00] amen it's not it's not on it's not on
[1:32:02] your 401k and the future of your of your
[1:32:06] finances that's not where the light is
[1:32:09] the light is on the word in the evening
[1:32:11] like a time it shall be light
[1:32:15] notice now the next verse and it shall
[1:32:18] be on that day in the evening time
[1:32:21] that living water shall go out of
[1:32:24] jerusalem
[1:32:27] hallelujah now remember the bride she is
[1:32:31] the spirits of jerusalem out of her will
[1:32:34] go what living waters
[1:32:36] there's going to be an abundant supply
[1:32:39] flowing out of her
[1:32:41] amen and half of them toward the former
[1:32:44] sea half of toward the henderson the
[1:32:46] summer and the winter shall be it won't
[1:32:48] matter if it's cold it won't matter if
[1:32:50] it's hot it don't matter if this is have
[1:32:53] revival and that one age amen it'll
[1:32:55] always be the same amen the living water
[1:32:58] shall grow out from jerusalem
[1:33:05] hallelujah out of this bride out of this
[1:33:08] people is going to come living waters
[1:33:14] not a stagnant stream
[1:33:17] not something with wiggle tails or
[1:33:19] something that was yesterday but not
[1:33:21] today
[1:33:23] amen but something i live in waters and
[1:33:26] the lord shall be king remember was
[1:33:28] preaching on the rejected king the lord
[1:33:30] shall be king over all the earth in that
[1:33:33] day there shall be one lord and his name
[1:33:36] won
[1:33:41] now jesus let it be known he was the
[1:33:43] giver of that water
[1:33:46] the woman at the well
[1:33:48] the woman that had six husbands
[1:33:52] or six men or five men and one was not
[1:33:54] her husband
[1:33:56] so six men
[1:33:57] and now she meets the seventh
[1:34:00] so when she comes to the seventh come on
[1:34:03] she mates the one who gives her the
[1:34:07] answer for the thirst in her life
[1:34:11] hallelujah amen he has living waters
[1:34:14] john 14 10 jesus answered said in her if
[1:34:17] thou knewest the gift of god and who it
[1:34:20] is that saith to thee give me to drink
[1:34:22] that would have asked of him and he
[1:34:23] would have given me living water
[1:34:28] not a stagnant pool
[1:34:31] living water
[1:34:32] not a dried up cistern where it leaked
[1:34:35] out years and years ago
[1:34:37] living water
[1:34:38] i've come to give living water
[1:34:41] now let's turn to john 7 verse 37
[1:34:44] in the last days and the great day of
[1:34:46] the feast
[1:34:48] jesus stood and cried saying if any man
[1:34:51] thirsts let him come to me and drink
[1:34:54] if you're thirsty come to me
[1:34:57] he that believeth on me
[1:35:00] as the scripture has said
[1:35:03] out of his belly shall flow
[1:35:05] rivers of living water
[1:35:08] notice again a flow
[1:35:12] an abundance
[1:35:14] this is not a trickle
[1:35:17] again you know it's not saying if you
[1:35:19] believe on me as the scripture has said
[1:35:21] out of you will come a trickle
[1:35:24] he said it'll be a
[1:35:26] river an unstoppable river
[1:35:30] it's an unstoppable fountain
[1:35:33] there's not a little bit of it it flows
[1:35:39] but this he spoke
[1:35:40] of the spirit which they that believe on
[1:35:43] him should receive for the holy ghost
[1:35:45] was not yet given because jesus was not
[1:35:48] yet glorified
[1:35:50] so again it is the lamb that leads to
[1:35:53] living waters
[1:35:55] it is him that gives living waters
[1:35:57] that's what he wants the church to have
[1:36:00] is a
[1:36:01] flowing fountain
[1:36:02] now ezekiel 37 11. i'd like to just look
[1:36:06] at here because as they're coming back
[1:36:09] there are prophecies laying in the bible
[1:36:12] for their return
[1:36:13] and so there are prophecies laying there
[1:36:15] for our return the bible prophesied that
[1:36:19] even as israel would return to their
[1:36:22] land we will return to our land
[1:36:25] are you with me so in ezekiel 37 11 he
[1:36:28] said unto me son of man these bones are
[1:36:31] the whole house of israel behold they
[1:36:33] say our bones are dried our hope is lost
[1:36:37] we're cut off from our parts therefore
[1:36:39] prophesy and say unto them just sayeth
[1:36:42] the lord behold o my people i will open
[1:36:45] your graves and i will come cause you to
[1:36:48] come out of your graves and bring you to
[1:36:50] the land of israel
[1:36:53] so you see the jews were brought out of
[1:36:55] the nations of bride from denomination
[1:36:57] but god said it's a resurrection
[1:37:00] i'm actually
[1:37:02] resurrecting a people
[1:37:05] bringing them to their land
[1:37:08] and you shall know i'm the lord when i
[1:37:10] have opened your graves o my people and
[1:37:12] brought you out of your graves and shall
[1:37:14] put my spirit in you and you shall live
[1:37:17] and i shall place you in your own land
[1:37:21] and you will know that i the lord has
[1:37:24] spoken it and performed it saith the
[1:37:27] lord remember israel's over there
[1:37:29] against all odds
[1:37:31] it looked impossible
[1:37:35] amen
[1:37:36] now in the in the rise of the sun
[1:37:38] brother branham talks about the
[1:37:40] brightest for the bright age it would be
[1:37:42] a resurrection out of dark
[1:37:44] denominationalism
[1:37:46] so what is it was god opening the graves
[1:37:50] and bringing the people to the land
[1:37:54] amen sometimes you know you you young
[1:37:56] people don't understand maybe even what
[1:37:58] we're talking about because you never
[1:38:00] were there
[1:38:01] but we were there
[1:38:03] we know what the slave belt feels like
[1:38:05] we know the whippings
[1:38:08] we understand the the
[1:38:11] humiliation the persecution we
[1:38:13] understand we were misfits
[1:38:18] amen we understand we were in a grave we
[1:38:21] were dying
[1:38:22] amen but god has brought a resurrection
[1:38:25] out of dark denominationalism
[1:38:28] back to the land i'll open up the graves
[1:38:31] and i'll bring you back to your land
[1:38:36] now
[1:38:38] so the bride has returned to the home
[1:38:40] land of the holy ghost
[1:38:42] brother branham told him in recognizing
[1:38:44] your day in this message israel back in
[1:38:46] her promised land she didn't know how
[1:38:48] she got back there she was just
[1:38:50] automatically put back there
[1:38:53] why national force put her in her place
[1:38:56] and he said i'm going to say something
[1:38:58] national force put israel in her
[1:39:00] homeland national forest will put the
[1:39:03] church in the world council of churches
[1:39:06] yes
[1:39:07] and we can already see national force
[1:39:11] coming down
[1:39:13] amen as
[1:39:14] the antichrist rises its power we feel
[1:39:18] it right now today
[1:39:20] you know that amen but i want you to
[1:39:22] know it's not national force that puts
[1:39:25] the bride in her homeland it's the power
[1:39:28] of god that puts the bride in her
[1:39:29] homeland
[1:39:30] and you see because we'll recognize our
[1:39:33] position and the word in that land and
[1:39:36] she is in christ and that that will put
[1:39:38] in a place no national force will do it
[1:39:42] i'm telling you the pressures you are
[1:39:44] under is not going to put you in your
[1:39:46] place
[1:39:48] people are looking for a squeeze to put
[1:39:50] them in their place it won't do it
[1:39:53] amen you say well the pressures brother
[1:39:55] tim they're getting worse and worse but
[1:39:56] i'll tell you friends there's another
[1:39:58] pressure
[1:40:00] there's another pressure it's the
[1:40:01] pressure of the holy ghost
[1:40:04] and it is pushing and pressing of all
[1:40:06] the people in this hour
[1:40:08] you've got to get ready to leave from
[1:40:10] here i'm taking you even beyond the land
[1:40:14] of the bible into the land of the
[1:40:16] promised land of the resurrection
[1:40:19] and the rapture into glory
[1:40:23] more than just a theology am i returning
[1:40:26] you to remember i'm giving you a double
[1:40:28] portion
[1:40:29] amen yes i'm restoring the word but more
[1:40:32] than the word i'm taking you physically
[1:40:37] don't you realize that the for the real
[1:40:39] capstone of the holy ghost will be taken
[1:40:42] a bride physically in a rapture
[1:40:45] a sweep of the holy ghost coming over
[1:40:48] them
[1:40:49] that's why you got to have the sweep now
[1:40:51] to change you now so that you'll be a
[1:40:53] part of the sweep then
[1:40:58] we're people who have returned to the
[1:41:00] land of the bible
[1:41:02] after six church ages of dispersal
[1:41:05] removal from the land
[1:41:08] by paul's gospel
[1:41:09] the church was rooted firmly in the land
[1:41:12] of the bible with correct bible
[1:41:13] doctrines and the power of the holy
[1:41:15] ghost
[1:41:17] and as the ephesian church lost their
[1:41:19] first love
[1:41:20] believers then would become dispersed
[1:41:23] among the denominations
[1:41:26] and they've been out of their homeland
[1:41:27] now for thousands of years
[1:41:30] but at this date
[1:41:31] there's been a call that has rung out
[1:41:33] come out of her my people
[1:41:36] this is a midnight cry
[1:41:38] amen light your lamps get ready the
[1:41:41] bridegroom cometh go you out to meet him
[1:41:44] this is the third exodus
[1:41:46] where god has sent us to moses
[1:41:49] to deliver the people of israel from
[1:41:51] egypt
[1:41:52] vindicating him with a pillar of fire
[1:41:55] and that same god has sent a prophet
[1:41:57] with a message saying let my people go
[1:42:01] and we're here in the land having
[1:42:03] returned to the gospel that paul
[1:42:05] preached
[1:42:07] i want you to know where we're at
[1:42:10] we're not in a strange land we're not
[1:42:12] over in uganda somewhere
[1:42:14] we have been returned back to our land
[1:42:18] the gospel paul preached
[1:42:23] amen
[1:42:24] you say well
[1:42:26] well we got something different from old
[1:42:28] paul well i'll tell you what you can
[1:42:29] have your uganda
[1:42:31] amen i don't want a different gospel or
[1:42:33] a different land
[1:42:34] because of this we have returned to the
[1:42:36] god of the bible
[1:42:38] in this land we will keep his
[1:42:40] commandments we will have no other gods
[1:42:43] besides him
[1:42:45] amen even the idols of television and
[1:42:48] hollywood have been abandoned
[1:42:50] with a pledge to serve the one true and
[1:42:53] living god
[1:42:55] amen
[1:42:56] true believers don't go to movies
[1:43:00] you didn't get that let me say it again
[1:43:01] true believers don't go to movies
[1:43:04] real believers don't wallow like pigs
[1:43:06] with the world and go to their ball
[1:43:07] games
[1:43:08] you might attract leo to seeing with
[1:43:10] ball games but not the bride
[1:43:14] make no mistake about it we we've got a
[1:43:17] safe place for for our children to play
[1:43:20] but that ain't about attracting people
[1:43:22] here
[1:43:23] we attract people by the gospel of jesus
[1:43:26] christ by the outpouring of the holy
[1:43:29] ghost
[1:43:30] amen the bride's heroes is not someone
[1:43:33] who can chase a pigskin
[1:43:36] amen a pigskin that's just full of air
[1:43:39] and when or when a gold medal at the
[1:43:41] olympics that is not our heroes our
[1:43:44] heroes are men who can kill a giant with
[1:43:47] a stone
[1:43:48] that lions cannot eat
[1:43:50] that fire cannot burn
[1:43:52] amen who fed through faith subdued
[1:43:55] kingdoms and wrought righteousness and
[1:43:57] obtained promises and stopped the mouth
[1:43:59] of lions
[1:44:00] who quenched the violence of the fire
[1:44:02] who escaped the edge of the sword who
[1:44:05] out of weakness were made strong who
[1:44:07] watched violet in flight and who turned
[1:44:10] the flight to armies of the aliens
[1:44:11] that's our heroes
[1:44:13] our heroes are abraham isaac jacob david
[1:44:17] peter paul james john jesus
[1:44:22] amen all the way down to the seven ages
[1:44:25] these are the heroes our heroes
[1:44:28] amen
[1:44:29] now
[1:44:30] we have returned to the land of milk and
[1:44:33] honey
[1:44:35] and it's it's a wonderful land
[1:44:38] like in the days of joshua of old you
[1:44:40] remember that walked around the walls of
[1:44:43] silence
[1:44:44] but now we've seen the silence that the
[1:44:46] seventh seal held and now is broken amen
[1:44:50] and the land is open to us
[1:44:52] it's open for the believer every
[1:44:54] resource of the book
[1:44:57] now this is granted us untapped
[1:45:00] resources
[1:45:02] i'm trying to get something to you it
[1:45:04] flows
[1:45:05] and there
[1:45:07] there are resources that you have not
[1:45:10] yet tapped into
[1:45:16] now
[1:45:17] just because i i i got a little sore
[1:45:20] throat yesterday don't mean you got to
[1:45:22] sit down on me you got to help me a
[1:45:23] little bit
[1:45:26] amen now let's listen this this this has
[1:45:30] granted us untapped resources
[1:45:33] no you don't have to cover your face and
[1:45:35] run i'm not sick
[1:45:39] now you see we have untapped resources
[1:45:43] just as israel had to conquer the land
[1:45:45] before
[1:45:47] before them and after seeing the walls
[1:45:49] fell
[1:45:50] you know after the seals is open that's
[1:45:53] only the beginning
[1:45:58] that we understand the seals and the
[1:46:00] mystery that's only the beginning
[1:46:03] there's more in the land
[1:46:08] amen
[1:46:09] now the third pull that third phase of
[1:46:11] brother brandon's ministry that opened
[1:46:14] the seven seals opened up the entire
[1:46:16] word of god
[1:46:17] it was based on a scripture
[1:46:20] that we are going to have to make our
[1:46:22] scripture
[1:46:24] i want you to see it mark 11 23 this is
[1:46:27] the scripture for this
[1:46:30] this word that we have received
[1:46:33] the message
[1:46:35] mark 11 23 for verily i say unto you
[1:46:38] that whosoever shall say
[1:46:40] to this mountain
[1:46:42] be thou removed and be thou cast in the
[1:46:44] sea and shall not doubt in his heart but
[1:46:47] shall believe that those things which he
[1:46:49] said shall come to pass he shall have
[1:46:52] whatsoever he said
[1:46:55] therefore i say unto you what things
[1:46:58] soever you desire
[1:47:02] how many's got things you desire
[1:47:06] all right so he's saying when you pray
[1:47:08] you believe that you receive them and
[1:47:10] you shall have them
[1:47:15] no exceptions
[1:47:19] no deals
[1:47:21] no clauses
[1:47:23] no buts
[1:47:24] no ifs
[1:47:26] amen but what you when you pray believe
[1:47:29] you receive them and you shall have them
[1:47:32] that's the message of the third pull you
[1:47:36] say brother tim i believe the mystery
[1:47:37] believe this mystery
[1:47:42] amen because this is what the third poll
[1:47:45] was based on this scripture right here
[1:47:48] amen the third poll opened up the seven
[1:47:50] seals of brother tiff we're to be
[1:47:52] studious and and learned and scholars
[1:47:55] and and understanders of of the bible
[1:47:58] and whatever well understand the
[1:48:00] scripture
[1:48:03] we are people who stand under the blood
[1:48:05] covenant
[1:48:08] amen the blood of the everlasting
[1:48:10] covenant
[1:48:12] a people that through the atonement
[1:48:15] sanctified by the blood of jesus christ
[1:48:18] can live in such a sphere with god
[1:48:21] so close that he can be wrapped so
[1:48:23] completely and god by the blood of jesus
[1:48:26] that it wouldn't be him talking it would
[1:48:28] be the holy spirit speaking these things
[1:48:35] now the original root
[1:48:38] of the bride tree has put forth another
[1:48:41] branch
[1:48:43] i want you to say we are a branch of the
[1:48:46] original root
[1:48:49] we have not been grafted in
[1:48:51] we have been born in the original vine
[1:48:56] we're not a sprout that it was put in by
[1:48:58] luther or wesley or pentecost we are not
[1:49:02] a grafted vine we are the vine the
[1:49:05] original vine pudding for the branch
[1:49:09] amen in other words we are then a
[1:49:13] continuation
[1:49:15] of the root
[1:49:16] of the book of acts
[1:49:18] amen we are not a continuation of her
[1:49:21] faces of her debates of our arguments or
[1:49:25] the heresies of our false doctrines but
[1:49:28] we are continuation of the same holy
[1:49:30] spirit that worked in the church of
[1:49:32] people who are now doing his acts again
[1:49:39] if you abide in me
[1:49:41] if you dwell in the land
[1:49:43] and the god of the land dwell in you
[1:49:46] the holy ghost in you then ask what you
[1:49:48] will
[1:49:55] see we receive the seals that open up
[1:49:57] the land of the book
[1:49:59] but we're to go into
[1:50:00] we are to go into full
[1:50:02] redemption
[1:50:05] listen in the queen of sheba brother
[1:50:07] branham said instead of people advancing
[1:50:09] on and seeing what god promised
[1:50:12] we look back and see what some brother
[1:50:13] behind us said
[1:50:16] let's don't look back let's look forward
[1:50:17] let's keep moving on and on we have
[1:50:20] untapped resources
[1:50:22] jesus said mark 11 23 why if you say to
[1:50:26] this mountain be moved and don't doubt
[1:50:28] in your heart but believe what you said
[1:50:30] it shall come to pass you can have what
[1:50:31] you said no conditions it's just
[1:50:34] unlimited
[1:50:36] whatsoever things you desire when you
[1:50:38] pray believe you receive them and you
[1:50:40] shall
[1:50:41] have them
[1:50:44] now you say brother branham what if we
[1:50:45] ask for somebody's life to be taken or
[1:50:47] some evil thing he said you can have a
[1:50:49] christian faith for doing the thing like
[1:50:51] that it takes a christian spirit to ask
[1:50:54] christian things to receive things from
[1:50:55] christ
[1:50:57] but he said when a spirit-born
[1:51:00] spirit-filled man in faith
[1:51:03] takes the word into his heart
[1:51:05] places it upon his lips what that is the
[1:51:08] same as deity speaking
[1:51:10] every mountain has to go
[1:51:12] satan cannot stand before that man
[1:51:17] i'm talking to that people that satan
[1:51:20] cannot stand before
[1:51:22] amen again he said in the early church
[1:51:26] he said the sick were healed the devils
[1:51:29] were cast out they spoke with new
[1:51:31] tongues that was the word in action that
[1:51:34] word is never failed in the mouths of
[1:51:36] believing christians
[1:51:38] and in this last age how many wants to
[1:51:40] know about the last days now it is here
[1:51:42] stronger and greater than ever in the
[1:51:46] true word bright
[1:51:48] not less more
[1:51:51] a double portion
[1:51:54] now moses in the first exodus by a
[1:51:57] commission under the blood of bulls and
[1:51:59] goat he began to torment satan's kingdom
[1:52:03] amen
[1:52:04] think of it
[1:52:05] amen say him time after time let my
[1:52:08] people go
[1:52:11] if you don't let them go i'll bring
[1:52:12] another plague on you
[1:52:14] we're going to plague the devil don't
[1:52:16] you get it we're going to plague the
[1:52:17] devil till we leave from here
[1:52:21] until he has to let us go
[1:52:24] amen satan you see pharaoh got stubborn
[1:52:27] but the more stubborn he became the more
[1:52:29] determined god was to have israel his
[1:52:32] firstborn serve him uninhibited
[1:52:37] don't try to inhibit us
[1:52:40] don't try to limit us
[1:52:42] amen we will have praise we will have
[1:52:45] worship
[1:52:46] we'll have the holy ghost we'll have
[1:52:49] every divine promise we'll have the
[1:52:51] mysteries we'll have every truth in the
[1:52:53] bible we will not shirk back from one
[1:52:56] thing it's all ours
[1:53:04] let my people go i won't do it okay then
[1:53:07] i'll plague you till you do
[1:53:09] and god used the voice of a man to bring
[1:53:12] plagues on satan's kingdom
[1:53:14] and now god wants to use your voice
[1:53:18] satan you have no right to my body i am
[1:53:21] a temple of the holy ghost you have no
[1:53:24] right to my children you have no right
[1:53:26] to my family i'm a child of the most
[1:53:28] high god amen i'm not standing still
[1:53:31] i'll call down heaven and the plagues
[1:53:34] from heaven until you let them go
[1:53:43] amen we will not stand still we've got a
[1:53:45] land to go to
[1:53:47] [Applause]
[1:53:49] we have a rapture in this hour we
[1:53:52] believe for the impossible
[1:53:57] and god will use the voice of a man
[1:54:00] to to bring plagues upon satan's kingdom
[1:54:03] and just a little more sound up here now
[1:54:06] so god
[1:54:07] hiding revealing himself in simplicity
[1:54:10] this is what brother adam told us god
[1:54:12] wouldn't be seen out there god would be
[1:54:14] hidden
[1:54:15] in simplicity
[1:54:17] he'd be hidden in a people
[1:54:20] he would be hidden in a in a little man
[1:54:22] that's had a stuttering speech
[1:54:25] in the days of moses somebody help me
[1:54:28] amen he would be hidden in him he would
[1:54:30] be hidden in a rod which would represent
[1:54:33] the name of jesus
[1:54:35] it didn't look like much
[1:54:37] but it availed much
[1:54:39] your prayers may not look like much but
[1:54:42] they avail much
[1:54:46] do you hear what i'm saying
[1:54:49] amen there was a story of a man um that
[1:54:52] had a real um
[1:54:54] near-death experience and i won't tell
[1:54:57] it all but unless he he went to hell he
[1:54:59] was not a believer
[1:55:01] and when he when he died and he he went
[1:55:04] and and descended way down down down
[1:55:07] miles there and as he did they began to
[1:55:09] pull on him and torment him and kick him
[1:55:12] and whatever and
[1:55:14] bite him and fight him and everything
[1:55:16] and he said i was you know i've been a
[1:55:18] football player as a kid and i knew how
[1:55:21] to handle myself and i was hitting back
[1:55:23] and whatever else but there was hundreds
[1:55:26] of them
[1:55:28] thousands of them coming against me in
[1:55:30] this dark place
[1:55:33] and he said they left me until i was
[1:55:36] just uh
[1:55:37] just a a heap
[1:55:40] on the floor my eyes were gone my
[1:55:42] eyeballs pulled out my ears pulled off
[1:55:45] they had bit me and tore me and
[1:55:47] tormented me and hurt me until i was
[1:55:49] nothing but just a piece of humanity on
[1:55:53] the floor he said i was i was like
[1:55:55] something from a sewer
[1:55:58] my life wretched
[1:56:01] and he said in that moment he began to
[1:56:04] he something began to say to him pray
[1:56:08] and he said i don't believe in prayer
[1:56:10] i don't believe in prayer whatsoever i'm
[1:56:12] an atheist and i don't believe in prayer
[1:56:15] i'll tell you you'll believe in that
[1:56:16] place
[1:56:19] and remember this man got to come back
[1:56:22] he only was able to see this
[1:56:25] amen but he got to come back to life
[1:56:28] again and it changed his life
[1:56:30] but there in that midst there he said in
[1:56:33] a heap broken hurting pain like you
[1:56:36] never felt
[1:56:38] he said i began they began to begin to
[1:56:40] say something from inside of me pray and
[1:56:43] he said i don't know i don't know how to
[1:56:45] pray
[1:56:47] and he said well pray
[1:56:49] and he said
[1:56:50] i i don't know how he said something
[1:56:54] from way back from his childhood
[1:56:56] come come to him and he began to say god
[1:56:59] bless america
[1:57:01] you know my country tis of thee and all
[1:57:04] kinds of things that he would say you
[1:57:06] know come to his mind about god anything
[1:57:09] that had god in it he noticed every time
[1:57:11] that he spoke the name jesus or god he
[1:57:15] said the demons would run screaming
[1:57:18] and they would scream but they wouldn't
[1:57:19] come closer they would they would back
[1:57:21] away from him every time that he would
[1:57:23] mention it
[1:57:24] and he said there in that horrible
[1:57:27] condition he said i i there was a hope
[1:57:30] and he said
[1:57:31] i i had something down on the inside of
[1:57:34] me that began to hope that jesus loved
[1:57:36] me
[1:57:37] he said why would he love me i've never
[1:57:40] done him for him i turned him away i've
[1:57:42] not believed in him but he said if there
[1:57:44] was ever time i wanted to believe jesus
[1:57:47] loved me i wanted to believe it then
[1:57:49] and he said i i began to say jesus loves
[1:57:53] me and then he said jesus come to me
[1:57:57] and he said i wanted to believe he would
[1:58:00] come and he said all of a sudden i saw a
[1:58:02] light it was so tiny but it began to
[1:58:05] advance toward me and become greater and
[1:58:07] greater and greater and he picked me up
[1:58:09] in his arms and he loved me
[1:58:12] and then he took i told him and took him
[1:58:14] from there as he
[1:58:15] took all his hurts away and replaced his
[1:58:18] eyeballs and his ears all the hurting
[1:58:21] that he had been through took him there
[1:58:23] and moved him into that dimension of
[1:58:26] heaven and he spoke about those things
[1:58:28] but nevertheless
[1:58:29] in the thing what i want to get to you
[1:58:31] this man he saw first hand
[1:58:34] well you know where just the name of
[1:58:37] jesus
[1:58:38] just speaking of god
[1:58:40] caused demons to move back in that round
[1:58:44] i don't think the believer realizes the
[1:58:48] effectual fervent prayer of the
[1:58:50] righteous man
[1:58:51] amen the power that is there that is
[1:58:54] unleashed when you call on the name of
[1:58:56] jesus
[1:58:57] demons have to go
[1:58:59] haven't we seen it haven't we seen
[1:59:01] demons bow to it haven't we seen them
[1:59:03] cast out in the name of jesus christ
[1:59:06] why because the effectual fervent prayer
[1:59:09] releases the name of jesus and the power
[1:59:13] to make devils flee
[1:59:15] i'll tell you there's enough power in
[1:59:17] there to heal your cancer to heal your
[1:59:20] diseases to heal your sickness to heal
[1:59:23] your soul sickness there's enough power
[1:59:26] to go out and find your loved ones and
[1:59:28] bring them home and restore your family
[1:59:31] there's enough power and when the saints
[1:59:33] of god begin to release the unlimited
[1:59:36] power of jesus
[1:59:39] hallelujah that's what i'm talking about
[1:59:41] there's power
[1:59:45] things you've never tapped into
[1:59:48] that you don't realize
[1:59:50] because the devil wants to make you
[1:59:52] think
[1:59:53] your prayers are going nowhere
[1:59:56] where all the time they're pushing him
[1:59:58] back and pushing him back
[2:00:00] and making him flee
[2:00:02] isn't that the bible
[2:00:04] submit yourself therefore to god resist
[2:00:07] the devil and he shall
[2:00:08] flee from you
[2:00:14] moses standing under the blood of bulls
[2:00:16] and goats
[2:00:17] walked out there
[2:00:19] reached toward the east and said dust
[2:00:21] said the lord let there come flies
[2:00:22] they've never been fly
[2:00:24] never heard a fly he didn't even see a
[2:00:27] fly he just spoke it
[2:00:30] amen and it was expressed
[2:00:33] doubts released from his lips
[2:00:36] a simple man with the blood of bulls and
[2:00:38] goats
[2:00:40] first thing you know here comes a little
[2:00:41] fly
[2:00:42] the next thing you know there are five
[2:00:45] pounds per yard
[2:00:47] you know again it was the word of god
[2:00:49] spoken through moses do you hear what
[2:00:52] was saying think moses remember moses
[2:00:56] i'm turning you back to an unlimited
[2:00:58] supply
[2:01:00] there's no limit in this
[2:01:03] it flows with milk and honey
[2:01:06] amen and he said if he said
[2:01:08] under the blood he stand in the presence
[2:01:10] of god his words was in his own words
[2:01:14] if you abide in me and my words abide in
[2:01:16] you then ask what you will
[2:01:18] it shall be given to you where is the
[2:01:21] church standing at
[2:01:23] i want to ask you something the blood of
[2:01:25] bulls and goats
[2:01:26] uh could be used for bleach we can only
[2:01:28] cover could put a man in position to
[2:01:31] speak the creative word of god and bring
[2:01:32] flies into existence why would you
[2:01:35] stumble at the bleach of jesus christ's
[2:01:37] blood who can speak a squirrel or
[2:01:39] something into existence
[2:01:41] amen don't do it don't stumble over
[2:01:43] simplicity believe he still remains god
[2:01:47] if you say to this mountain be moved
[2:01:50] don't doubt in your heart but believe
[2:01:51] what you said will come to pass you can
[2:01:54] have what you said
[2:01:56] again you say i believe the third pull
[2:01:58] brother brother tim we're in the third
[2:02:00] pool this is the scripture of the third
[2:02:02] pull
[2:02:04] amen
[2:02:05] and he says where is the pentecostal
[2:02:08] church today at today said you don't
[2:02:11] realize that truly confess sin omits
[2:02:15] sins and it builds a bridge across the
[2:02:18] council and takes a man back in the
[2:02:20] presence of the creator and makes him a
[2:02:22] son of god let me tell you even more it
[2:02:25] takes away the castle where there's not
[2:02:27] even a remembrance
[2:02:29] that you were ever on the other side
[2:02:31] that you ever was a sinner
[2:02:35] hallelujah as far as he issues from the
[2:02:38] west god has removed your sins your
[2:02:42] unbelief from you
[2:02:49] now
[2:02:50] he said god taking a humble center
[2:02:53] cleansing him by his blood dropping him
[2:02:55] in that con that confessed sin into that
[2:02:58] clorox bleach of the blood of the son of
[2:03:00] god putting his own life into that man
[2:03:02] by the baptism of the holy ghost then if
[2:03:05] we have the
[2:03:06] genuine baptism of the holy ghost what's
[2:03:09] wrong with us
[2:03:10] when the type when elijah dropped the
[2:03:13] road for elisha he got a double portion
[2:03:16] of it jesus said the works that i do
[2:03:18] shall you shall do also and greater than
[2:03:20] this shall you do for i go to my father
[2:03:23] what's wrong church
[2:03:26] now brother branham is asking what is
[2:03:30] wrong
[2:03:31] well you see
[2:03:33] the the lutherans were too happy just
[2:03:35] with having their sins forgiven
[2:03:38] to go on they left out a whole much more
[2:03:41] of the bible
[2:03:42] and a lot of it they never possessed
[2:03:46] amen wesley was too happy with holiness
[2:03:49] that he didn't go on into the holy ghost
[2:03:52] you see azusa street went into speaking
[2:03:54] in tongues and they were too happy with
[2:03:56] the gift of the spirit they didn't even
[2:03:58] get
[2:03:59] the the gift himself the holy ghost
[2:04:02] amen but i want you to understand god's
[2:04:04] asking the same question what's wrong
[2:04:07] with the church
[2:04:08] where are we standing
[2:04:11] this is not another denominational
[2:04:13] church
[2:04:15] where you just sit back on your pew and
[2:04:17] socialize and join up
[2:04:19] but this is a day where people who know
[2:04:22] their god will do exploits
[2:04:24] who will take all the land
[2:04:27] you see in the first exodus the people
[2:04:30] of the book use inspired words
[2:04:33] uttered from human lips and it created
[2:04:36] frogs and lice
[2:04:38] and locusts
[2:04:40] now they weren't playing games they were
[2:04:42] tormenting devils
[2:04:45] is that right
[2:04:46] they were calling the elements come
[2:04:48] torment satan
[2:04:50] we have been tormented we have been
[2:04:52] whipped
[2:04:53] we have been beat we have been enslaved
[2:04:56] we have been in bondage but no more
[2:04:59] right now we are starting to declare our
[2:05:02] freedom
[2:05:03] and in declaring our freedom we are
[2:05:06] bringing curses upon satan's kingdom
[2:05:10] amen we are bombarded satan's kingdom
[2:05:13] confessing the word by his stripes i am
[2:05:17] healed
[2:05:18] in the name of jesus christ hold in our
[2:05:20] our profession come on
[2:05:23] amen they in their household shall be
[2:05:25] saved
[2:05:26] they will be there in their offsprings
[2:05:28] with them every scripture that there is
[2:05:31] in the bible you bombard
[2:05:34] satan's kingdom
[2:05:36] you bomb him
[2:05:39] hallelujah and if the first bomb don't
[2:05:41] get him you drop another into the same
[2:05:43] place and if that don't get it you do it
[2:05:46] and you pound it till it gets through
[2:05:48] until you flatten him
[2:05:50] till it's no longer standing before you
[2:05:56] now god's word it said to the seed of
[2:05:59] abraham they would return to the land of
[2:06:00] abraham and nothing could stop him
[2:06:04] and i'm just saying nothing can stop us
[2:06:09] you know the tables had turned after
[2:06:11] being beaten despised suppressed
[2:06:14] now
[2:06:15] the israelites moses was the oppressor
[2:06:20] amen and they were unstoppable
[2:06:22] the bible said they went out with a high
[2:06:24] hand
[2:06:26] and when the red sea got in their way
[2:06:28] too bad you got to move
[2:06:31] you got to open up
[2:06:32] we've got our inheritance on the other
[2:06:35] side of the red sea and the devil's
[2:06:37] trying to block us here but we'll go
[2:06:39] right through your block
[2:06:41] it don't matter how big it is we got a
[2:06:43] message and that message said go forward
[2:06:47] i'm sick with cancer go forward
[2:06:49] amen well i got this problem go forward
[2:06:52] hey my my children brother go forward
[2:06:54] whatever it is you don't quit you don't
[2:06:56] stop you go forward you persevere you
[2:06:59] press on
[2:07:04] every example
[2:07:06] of the bible shows the resources
[2:07:09] of this milk and honey and the sun
[2:07:11] limited
[2:07:13] none of the book remains closed
[2:07:16] we are not a people who have six seals
[2:07:19] open and the seventh remains on
[2:07:23] we're not a people of a closed book
[2:07:26] we're a people of the open book
[2:07:29] every bit of it is accessible
[2:07:32] now brother branham told us if you can
[2:07:34] limit god you can limit christ and if
[2:07:37] you can limit the church today in this
[2:07:38] possibilities you're limiting god but
[2:07:41] all things are possible whatsoever you
[2:07:43] desire when you pray you believe you
[2:07:45] receive it and you shall have it
[2:07:47] he said i believe it and i know it i
[2:07:49] know it's the truth
[2:07:51] now it provokes god
[2:07:54] somebody with me
[2:07:56] it provokes god to limit him
[2:08:01] it makes him angry
[2:08:03] it depletes displeases god look at
[2:08:05] psalms 78 and 40. how oft did they
[2:08:07] provoke him in the wilderness and grieve
[2:08:10] him in the desert
[2:08:12] yea they turned back and tempted god and
[2:08:14] limited the holy one of israel
[2:08:17] they remembered not his hand nor the day
[2:08:19] when he delivered them from the enemy
[2:08:21] how he wrought his signs in egypt and
[2:08:24] his wonders in the field of zoan which
[2:08:26] is which is where pharaoh's house was
[2:08:30] you see they didn't remember
[2:08:32] they forgot in their trials what god did
[2:08:36] and they limited god
[2:08:41] and this is the way we do so often we
[2:08:43] get into a trial and we start limiting
[2:08:46] god
[2:08:47] amen and when we do it provokes him it
[2:08:50] grieves him
[2:08:53] amen now god is known by simple faith
[2:08:57] by the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:08:59] that's the only way god in you and you
[2:09:01] become a son
[2:09:03] of god it changes your nature and the
[2:09:05] very same thing god the creator who made
[2:09:08] all things spoke
[2:09:10] and the world into existence by his word
[2:09:13] and that same spirit in you you believe
[2:09:15] everything god says and there's nothing
[2:09:18] impossible if you believe it you won't
[2:09:20] stand back to one little creed and say i
[2:09:22] don't believe
[2:09:23] except that i i can't believe god will
[2:09:26] do this i can't believe you limit god by
[2:09:29] your unbelief
[2:09:32] amen
[2:09:34] now he said if god loved you well enough
[2:09:37] to bring you up out of sin and fill you
[2:09:39] with the holy ghost
[2:09:42] is that you
[2:09:43] what's the matter with you poor
[2:09:44] spineless weaklings around the country
[2:09:47] won't he much more deliver you from your
[2:09:49] affliction
[2:09:51] when he promised he would do it
[2:09:54] well i'm past my three scoring tent you
[2:09:57] can give any kind of excuse you want to
[2:10:01] but god is unlimited
[2:10:03] you are limited because of your age but
[2:10:06] age didn't limit god with abraham
[2:10:08] it didn't limit him with sarah
[2:10:11] come on church it didn't limit him with
[2:10:14] simeon it didn't limit him with ammo
[2:10:19] amen we should not allow our our
[2:10:22] thinking to limit god
[2:10:25] our excuses
[2:10:27] the devil's trying to hide you back and
[2:10:29] tell you you're a little trot down
[2:10:31] something you are not you are sons and
[2:10:34] daughters of god
[2:10:35] amen we're not a defeated people we're
[2:10:38] an overcoming people
[2:10:40] i'm my deity he said is not just in
[2:10:43] heaven deities in you
[2:10:50] do you realize brother branham taught us
[2:10:52] that god is here
[2:10:55] not just coming
[2:10:58] we always want to put in the future one
[2:11:00] day you know when jesus comes
[2:11:04] but remember god has always been here on
[2:11:05] the earth
[2:11:07] god has never left the earth listen this
[2:11:11] this is brother branham's word god has
[2:11:13] never left the earth
[2:11:14] if he'd ever leave the earth i don't
[2:11:16] know what would become of it but god's
[2:11:17] always been here in some form
[2:11:20] oh praise his name
[2:11:22] and he was with the children of israel
[2:11:24] in the in the wilderness coming out of
[2:11:26] egypt in the form of the light he spoke
[2:11:28] to abraham in the former man he spoke to
[2:11:30] moses in the form of a man he spoke to
[2:11:33] the church in the form of a man his son
[2:11:35] christ jesus and he's speaking through
[2:11:37] his church today
[2:11:39] through the anointed church of the
[2:11:41] living god through vessels of clay
[2:11:45] we are the branches you are the branches
[2:11:48] i am the vine god is still speaking and
[2:11:51] the world sees jesus as you present him
[2:11:56] so you see again
[2:11:58] this is what he is god is here on the
[2:12:00] earth today where is he he's in bright
[2:12:02] form
[2:12:03] he's in his people he's in this church
[2:12:06] this morning he hasn't abandoned his
[2:12:08] project
[2:12:09] he hadn't sent a prophet and then went
[2:12:12] back in the heavens and forgot it all
[2:12:14] he may have taken his man but he didn't
[2:12:17] take his spirit
[2:12:19] somebody help me preach and brother
[2:12:21] branham tells us where we're standing in
[2:12:24] invisible union he said can you see
[2:12:25] where we're standing life is in the
[2:12:28] grain again
[2:12:29] what is it just exactly like the grain
[2:12:32] that went in the ground the same jesus
[2:12:34] in bright form same power same church
[2:12:37] same thing same word
[2:12:40] hallelujah amen so here we are the
[2:12:43] complete body of jesus christ revealed
[2:12:47] in the form of the bride that was taken
[2:12:49] out of his side
[2:12:51] amen in the message token as a husband
[2:12:54] and a woman and her husband become one
[2:12:56] so does the bride in christ become one
[2:12:59] the ministry of the pride and the
[2:13:01] ministry of christ is the same
[2:13:07] the vindicated word in his body
[2:13:09] is this very victory in the reason of
[2:13:12] his death he only died in the flesh his
[2:13:14] spirit went to hell his and when and
[2:13:17] preached to the souls in prison his
[2:13:19] flesh died then he raised it up again
[2:13:21] and quickened it quicken means he made
[2:13:23] it alive his flesh which is his body and
[2:13:26] that's the word has been laying dead for
[2:13:28] years but gradually come up in the
[2:13:30] reformation now she's standing on her
[2:13:33] feet
[2:13:34] now where's the church standing at on
[2:13:35] her feet
[2:13:37] an invincible army
[2:13:39] with unlimited resource
[2:13:42] with powerful weapons
[2:13:44] the weapons of our warfare are not
[2:13:46] carnal but mighty through god to the
[2:13:50] pulling down of strongholds
[2:13:52] that is our weapon
[2:13:54] amen so you there again a mighty army
[2:13:57] raised up marching towards zion taking
[2:14:01] every promise
[2:14:02] not backing up from any
[2:14:05] brother branham said that you know when
[2:14:07] when the dry bones lived he said that
[2:14:09] that word can only come through a
[2:14:11] prophet how can prophecy come only to
[2:14:13] the prophet you say well brother tim you
[2:14:15] see that it was only through the prophet
[2:14:17] there are still prophets
[2:14:20] let me make it clear there is not a
[2:14:22] four-fold ministry
[2:14:24] there is a five-fold ministry
[2:14:26] and a prophet is a new testament
[2:14:28] preacher
[2:14:30] now of course we know that there's only
[2:14:32] one prophet messenger
[2:14:35] is that right
[2:14:36] amen there's only one major prophet
[2:14:39] messenger will reveal the mysteries
[2:14:41] that's contained in the word and has the
[2:14:43] ministry to turn the hearts of the
[2:14:45] children to the fathers
[2:14:47] so there's one prophet messenger of the
[2:14:49] age
[2:14:51] amen so there's no eighth messengers
[2:14:55] amen there's no eight h
[2:14:57] but there are still prophets
[2:14:59] there are new testament preachers
[2:15:02] amen you know why the ministry is being
[2:15:04] attacked today
[2:15:06] satan has effectively destroyed prophecy
[2:15:09] in the church
[2:15:11] and preaching is the testimony of jesus
[2:15:14] christ which is the spirit of prophecy
[2:15:19] or you hear me
[2:15:20] when a man stands behind the pulpit
[2:15:24] brother adam said he has
[2:15:26] more authority than the angels in heaven
[2:15:28] [Music]
[2:15:30] when he's given forth the word and
[2:15:32] coming by inspiration it's more than the
[2:15:34] man it's the power of god behind those
[2:15:37] words
[2:15:38] moses might have been the vessel that
[2:15:40] spoke it and it might have been a man's
[2:15:42] words or the man's lips that formed the
[2:15:44] word but god got behind those words
[2:15:47] and
[2:15:48] created amen i want you to know there is
[2:15:52] an invincible army that has raised up
[2:15:55] marching to take every square inch of
[2:15:57] the word that speaks of the bride
[2:16:00] we will have everything that god
[2:16:02] promised
[2:16:03] we will believe all the word
[2:16:05] we will have holiness
[2:16:08] amen for without that no man will seek
[2:16:10] the lord

[2:26:50] preacher's too long
[2:26:52] not enough entertainment anyway he
[2:26:54] didn't tell enough jokes to keep my
[2:26:56] attention
[2:26:58] wednesday night and that you know and
[2:27:00] then that long service on sunday that's
[2:27:02] a bit too much
[2:27:04] and first thing you know you're critical
[2:27:06] and you've got stickers coming out of
[2:27:07] you yeah
[2:27:09] because you've been in a desert place
[2:27:12] but yeah that ain't where you belong
[2:27:14] the children don't belong in a desert
[2:27:16] place they belong by rivers
[2:27:19] of living waters
[2:27:23] where there's unlimited resource
[2:27:26] and you have to drink more than you're
[2:27:28] then you're
[2:27:29] just enough to sustain you
[2:27:32] amen even in church you got to get where
[2:27:34] you don't fill up quickly
[2:27:37] amen that you've got a big capacity for
[2:27:39] the word of god
[2:27:41] one sign that you're not adopted is that
[2:27:44] your your little you got come with a
[2:27:46] little jug and it gets filled up real
[2:27:47] quick
[2:27:48] amen well let me tell you it's got to be
[2:27:50] like david my cup run is over
[2:27:55] hey man i get filled with my cup hey man
[2:27:58] and it's getting down in my saucer
[2:28:01] and it's overflowing from my saucer and
[2:28:04] it's enough honey amen that the little
[2:28:06] bears can come along and those that's
[2:28:08] needy come on everybody around you can
[2:28:11] see you've been in the presence of god
[2:28:15] hallelujah not a sermon that by preacher
[2:28:17] yet that just makes christianettes
[2:28:22] there's too many little fish
[2:28:24] they're not rainbow trouts
[2:28:27] some of you don't know where i'm at
[2:28:29] the third pulled vision told brother
[2:28:31] branham he could catch that that trout
[2:28:34] but there was others that were just for
[2:28:36] the entertainment
[2:28:38] and when he went into the next poll it
[2:28:40] scattered him
[2:28:41] i don't want to be scattered
[2:28:43] i want to be pulled into his presence
[2:28:46] amen everything's in us right now
[2:28:49] we are now tapped into it
[2:28:51] i'm bringing this down to close now
[2:28:54] let me tell you there's enough pressure
[2:28:56] in this flow
[2:28:58] that it says if all the waters of the
[2:29:00] world
[2:29:02] were stacked upon a four foot pipe
[2:29:06] and the pressure of that trying to get
[2:29:08] out
[2:29:12] and that's the way the pressure
[2:29:14] of god is
[2:29:16] trying to find just a crevice
[2:29:20] if you push through
[2:29:25] looking for somebody that'll yield
[2:29:27] herself
[2:29:29] and just let it push through
[2:29:31] amen because if he can get just a little
[2:29:34] stream
[2:29:37] that stream will grow into a bigger one
[2:29:39] and then it'll go into a bigger one and
[2:29:41] first thing you know there'll be a huge
[2:29:43] flow of the divine love of god and a
[2:29:45] rapture will take place
[2:29:48] that's where we're at friend we're in
[2:29:49] the age of a rapture
[2:29:51] it's adoption age where we're here in
[2:29:53] the manifestations of the sons of god

[2:30:00] amen
[2:30:01] he said but i can't overcome
[2:30:03] oh yes you can
[2:30:05] because greater is he that is in you
[2:30:08] more
[2:30:09] is he that is in you
[2:30:10] than he that's in the world
[2:30:13] amen
[2:30:14] now god wants to do more than even you
[2:30:17] drinking milk
[2:30:18] he wants to get you to meet
[2:30:20] yes
[2:30:22] those that are mature and of strong and
[2:30:24] a strong age
[2:30:26] full age

[2:30:30] them so we're here in the day and the
[2:30:33] hour

[2:34:16] a god that could take a jailbird like
[2:34:19] george winters and make a child of god

[2:34:52] camp that didn't go far enough
[2:34:54] can i preach just a minute
[2:34:56] can i just tell you just a moment
[2:34:58] i saw a couple of boys that come to our
[2:35:01] camp three of them actually
[2:35:03] mcgary boys every one of them wayward
[2:35:06] backs not backslidden they never slid
[2:35:08] anywhere
[2:35:10] they never went forward they were
[2:35:12] rebellious young men didn't want to be
[2:35:14] at camp gave their mother a hard time on
[2:35:16] the way man you know it was a torture to
[2:35:18] bring them
[2:35:19] and there was a torture when we got them
[2:35:23] they aggravated everybody and everything
[2:35:26] and
[2:35:26] broke every kind of rule and to the
[2:35:28] point that i had to take one of those
[2:35:30] young men two of those young men and
[2:35:32] sent them off the campground with their
[2:35:34] mother
[2:35:35] it's a shame i'd have to do that
[2:35:37] but i did amen but they don't hate me
[2:35:41] today they love me for it
[2:35:47] davey jr

[2:36:11] grounds
[2:36:15] and david junior comes through the
[2:36:17] prayer line
[2:36:22] now
[2:36:23] his hard heart had been cracked
[2:36:26] and opened a little
[2:36:28] because he realized the shame that he'd
[2:36:30] brought his mother and his daddy and all
[2:36:32] this and he was ashamed of himself and
[2:36:34] he got just a little bit tender
[2:36:37] and at the end he began to hope
[2:36:40] that he could get right with god
[2:36:43] and he comes through the prayer line
[2:36:45] and there in the prayer line god
[2:36:47] delivers him
[2:36:53] amen and and then you know it was
[2:36:55] infectious
[2:36:58] it was infectious in here a few months
[2:37:00] later his brother aaron because of his
[2:37:03] witness and his testimony and his change
[2:37:06] he comes to the lord
[2:37:09] and dave mcgary calls me up brother

[2:37:55] so in love with jesus
[2:37:57] that i sit there and i weep as i watch
[2:38:00] and i see for myself the transforming
[2:38:03] power
[2:38:05] of one minute in god's presence

[2:38:12] life-changing amen and he had found an
