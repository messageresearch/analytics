[25:24] questions that they had some origination
[25:27] some of the doct we have come out of so
[25:29] I believe the Lord used him in a special
[25:30] way and last night brother Timothy
[25:33] preached a masterpiece of a service and
[25:35] just the Holy Spirit dropped down and I
[25:37] think there was uh maybe an altar full
[25:39] and he prayed for people for several
[25:41] maybe 30 to 40 minutes so God's using
[25:44] our brothers and uh they're an extension
[25:46] of what we stand for here at even andite
[25:48] Tabernacle so let's just keep them in
[25:50] prayer today that the Lord a climax to
[25:52] meeting there use them in a special way

[59:00] we're going to read Revelation 10
[59:02] 7-1
[59:04] amen amen I just pray that Lord will
[59:07] help us today uh you know I
[59:10] was still not real sure which way this
[59:13] is going to go if it's going to be you
[59:15] know teaching or preaching just just
[59:18] however however the Lord takes it you
[59:21] know I said something about teaching
[59:23] this morning and my daughter is like oh
[59:25] man you're not going to bring the power
[59:29] today well and I told her I was going to
[59:32] tell y'all she said that and she asked
[59:33] me not to but here we
[59:36] are but you know what I can't bring the
[59:38] power anyway we need him to come and
[59:40] bring the power this morning amen so I'm
[59:42] just asking that he'll take control amen
[59:45] Revelation 10 verse 7 says but in the
[59:49] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[59:51] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[59:53] of God should be finished as he had
[59:55] declared cled to his servants the
[59:57] prophets and the voice which I heard
[59:59] from Heaven spake unto me again and said
[1:00:01] go and take the little book which is
[1:00:02] open in the hand of the Angel which
[1:00:04] standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth
[1:00:07] and I went unto the angel and said unto
[1:00:09] him give me the little book and he said
[1:00:11] unto me take it and eat it up and it
[1:00:13] shall make thy belly bitter but it shall
[1:00:15] make thy mouth sweet as honey and I took
[1:00:19] the little book out of the Angel's hand
[1:00:21] and ate it up and it was in my mouth
[1:00:23] sweet as honey and as soon as I had eat
[1:00:25] e it up my belly was bitter and he said
[1:00:29] unto me thou must prophesy again before
[1:00:32] many peoples Nations tongues and Kings
[1:00:37] amen I pray that the Lord will add his
[1:00:39] Blessing to the word as as you have your
[1:00:41] seats this
[1:00:42] morning
[1:00:45] amen you know this is a scripture that I
[1:00:48] that I know that we're all very very
[1:00:50] familiar with and I and I chose to read
[1:00:52] from here today because you know we can
[1:00:54] use this scripture as a marker a as a
[1:00:58] marker for where we are in time and for
[1:01:00] what has taken place in this day amen we
[1:01:04] know that the seventh angel has come and
[1:01:06] has sounded his message so with that we
[1:01:09] can confidently say that that if the
[1:01:12] final Angel has sounded then we are at
[1:01:14] the end time amen be because we we've
[1:01:18] reached the end and we can declare that
[1:01:20] the mystery of God is finished you know
[1:01:24] because it's quite simple really
[1:01:26] if there are still Mysteries and there
[1:01:28] are still things sealed and truths not
[1:01:30] in their proper place and then brother
[1:01:33] brandham wasn't the seventh angel if you
[1:01:35] can still look and say well this hasn't
[1:01:37] been opened and this is still left
[1:01:39] sealed then then then brother Bram isn't
[1:01:41] the seventh angel because when the
[1:01:43] seventh angel sounds his message the
[1:01:46] mystery of God should be finished so
[1:01:49] with the sounding of that message come
[1:01:51] comes the fullness of the word comes the
[1:01:54] completion of of the Mi of all the
[1:01:57] Mysteries and we can we can declare
[1:01:59] today that the book is an open book
[1:02:03] because we see it right here in verse 8
[1:02:05] it says go and take the little book
[1:02:07] which is open we see it right there in
[1:02:12] the scripture the the angel has sounded
[1:02:14] his message and then in verse eight we
[1:02:16] see the book is is is an open book and
[1:02:20] then and then we're told to go and take
[1:02:23] the little book which is open in the
[1:02:24] hand of the Angel we're told to consume
[1:02:26] the book and then we see a commission to
[1:02:30] us there's a commission and the
[1:02:32] commission says that that we are to
[1:02:35] prophesy again in other words there's
[1:02:37] something that we have to do in this day
[1:02:40] church is not about you know well I've
[1:02:42] got it all memorized and I've got all
[1:02:43] the head knowledge and I can out debate
[1:02:45] this one and I can I can do this but no
[1:02:47] there there's a prophesying that is
[1:02:50] supposed to come out of our Lives
[1:02:51] there's a prophesying that's supposed to
[1:02:53] come out of this Bride As she is the the
[1:02:56] final voice to the final age amen so
[1:03:00] there's something that we're to do we're
[1:03:01] commissioned to speak as the final voice
[1:03:04] but but first I want you to see there is
[1:03:07] to be a
[1:03:08] consuming of the book before there is a
[1:03:12] speaking and I said this before the
[1:03:14] problem is a lot of times we have people
[1:03:16] speaking that hadn't eaten the book you
[1:03:19] know and it's the eating of the book is
[1:03:21] the revelation of the word is taking the
[1:03:23] book and consuming it that's supposed to
[1:03:25] give you something to say because if
[1:03:28] that's not what you're saying then
[1:03:30] you're speaking your own ideas or you're
[1:03:32] speaking your Church's ideas or you're
[1:03:34] speaking this man's ideas amen but but
[1:03:37] today it's what has been revealed under
[1:03:40] the seventh angel messenger that we are
[1:03:43] supposed to be proclaiming we're not
[1:03:45] here to Proclaim evening light
[1:03:47] Tabernacle we're not here to Proclaim
[1:03:49] this church or this pastor we are here
[1:03:51] to Proclaim that the seventh angel has
[1:03:53] come that the message has sounded and
[1:03:56] that that message was truth amen amen
[1:03:59] and not our own ideas and not the ideas
[1:04:02] of this church not some pet doctrine
[1:04:04] that has been revealed to you but take
[1:04:07] the open Word and put that open Word In
[1:04:10] Action today Amen Let the open word
[1:04:13] manifest through your life and let the
[1:04:15] power of God manifest through you amen
[1:04:19] the power of that word manifest in your
[1:04:23] life because it is the opening of the B
[1:04:25] book it is the revealing of the word the
[1:04:28] the tying up of all the Loose Ends that
[1:04:30] has given us the authority to stand and
[1:04:34] Proclaim power over the enemy there were
[1:04:37] ages where they couldn't stand and
[1:04:38] Proclaim that because there there were
[1:04:40] claims against the church there was
[1:04:41] false doctrines and so the enemy held
[1:04:44] the power but today those claims have
[1:04:46] been struck off today those claims have
[1:04:48] been done away with light has shined and
[1:04:51] as that light shine you saw who you were
[1:04:54] you saw your position in Christ you saw
[1:04:56] your name in the book and so now you
[1:04:59] recognize I have authority over that
[1:05:01] thing I have power over that what gave
[1:05:04] us that it was the opening of the word
[1:05:08] amen it was the tying up of all the
[1:05:11] Loose Ends the truths of
[1:05:14] Luther the truths of Wesley the truths
[1:05:18] of Pentecost they each had truths but
[1:05:21] none of them were able to put it all
[1:05:24] together none of them were able to put
[1:05:27] it all together but they had their
[1:05:29] individual truth and so because of this
[1:05:31] the enemy still had claims on the church
[1:05:34] John Smith would come along and and and
[1:05:37] and restore immersion in
[1:05:39] baptism and yet he still did it in
[1:05:42] titles so he had a truth he had the
[1:05:44] truth of immersion and yet he's he's
[1:05:46] doing it in titles what is that that's a
[1:05:49] loose end that's something not restored
[1:05:52] properly and and there were many other
[1:05:54] things that were left loose but we were
[1:05:56] promised a message in the last day that
[1:05:59] would come and tie all those loose ends
[1:06:03] together and let me declare to you we
[1:06:05] have received it it has come that
[1:06:07] message was perfect and all the Loose
[1:06:10] Ends have been tied together and the
[1:06:12] Mystery of God has been
[1:06:17] finished brother Bram tells us here he
[1:06:19] says and at the end of the Pentecostal
[1:06:22] age we are supposed to receive according
[1:06:24] to the word as God helped me tonight to
[1:06:27] show you through here we are to receive
[1:06:29] a messenger that will take all those
[1:06:32] loose ends out there and reveal the
[1:06:35] whole Secret Of God what
[1:06:37] for the rapturing of the church it's the
[1:06:41] revealing of the word the tying up of
[1:06:43] the Loose Ends that gives you what the
[1:06:45] rapturing faith that you need the power
[1:06:48] that you need to take a Rapture amen and
[1:06:51] and and this wasn't just
[1:06:53] progress the message of the hour wasn't
[1:06:56] just progress the message of the hour
[1:06:59] was
[1:07:01] completion it was a completion of of of
[1:07:04] the Mysteries that Luther brought
[1:07:06] progress and it was great progress and
[1:07:09] Wesley brought progress and isua brought
[1:07:12] progress many great men down Through the
[1:07:14] Ages would would catch little glimpses
[1:07:17] and they would catch a little bit and it
[1:07:19] would it would bring progress but this
[1:07:21] messenger sounded a message that brought
[1:07:24] completion to to it all the mystery of
[1:07:27] God the whole thing what are we waiting
[1:07:29] on brother Aaron uh who's going to come
[1:07:31] to finish it no no no nobody's going to
[1:07:33] come to finish it it has been finished
[1:07:36] in this day now there's just got to be a
[1:07:38] people that have a hunger for it and a
[1:07:40] desire for it and they take the book for
[1:07:43] themselves not just the preachers not
[1:07:45] just the deacons but a people that say
[1:07:48] I'm part of that word that word is part
[1:07:50] of me I'm going to consume it for
[1:07:54] myself amen
[1:07:57] now as I say that that doesn't mean that
[1:07:59] we don't still
[1:08:02] progress we always have to be
[1:08:05] progressing the people came out of of
[1:08:08] Egypt they stayed under the same message
[1:08:10] but they had to progress every day if
[1:08:12] they took their tent Stakes on a certain
[1:08:14] Doctrine and stayed in one place too
[1:08:16] long they got left
[1:08:17] behind amen so there's got to be
[1:08:19] progress you know there was those that
[1:08:21] came out under Luther's message that
[1:08:23] progress further than others
[1:08:26] and those were the ones who were able to
[1:08:27] step into the next message and go on
[1:08:30] with the word and and there was those
[1:08:32] under Wesley that that progressed
[1:08:34] further than others under his message
[1:08:36] and they were able to accept the
[1:08:38] outpouring of the gifts and then there
[1:08:40] was those in the isua movement that that
[1:08:42] progress further and we able to accept
[1:08:44] the opening of the
[1:08:46] word well where are we going to progress
[1:08:48] who no we're going to progress under
[1:08:50] that message cu the next step those who
[1:08:52] progress with the message are going to
[1:08:54] take a final step and they're going to
[1:08:56] step into eternity they're going to step
[1:08:58] into a Rapture not into a new message
[1:09:01] not into a new revelation but the next
[1:09:03] step if you progress with the message is
[1:09:06] to take a Rapture in this
[1:09:08] day
[1:09:10] amen we're to be progressing all the
[1:09:13] time and in that progress what is that
[1:09:15] progress brother it's it's allowing the
[1:09:17] revelation of of this finishing message
[1:09:20] to change us from glory to glory we're
[1:09:24] to be changing to be growing and and
[1:09:26] making progress all the time underneath
[1:09:28] the revelation of this message because
[1:09:32] listen let's just be honest if if if we
[1:09:33] had attained it all if if we all had it
[1:09:37] figured out just right and and we
[1:09:39] completed everything we were supposed to
[1:09:40] do and everyone was in their perfect
[1:09:42] place and the bride body was complete we
[1:09:45] wouldn't still be
[1:09:47] here we'd be gone so just looking around
[1:09:51] at that we got to recognize there's
[1:09:52] progress for us to do there's steps I
[1:09:55] need to take I need to go further look I
[1:09:57] don't want to be the one holding this
[1:09:59] thing
[1:10:00] up Lord I want to be in my place so when
[1:10:03] you're ready you don't have to say well
[1:10:05] I'm waiting on this no I want to
[1:10:07] progress to the place you want me at
[1:10:09] this morning hey man there's still work
[1:10:12] to be accomplished I'll say this there's
[1:10:15] still prodical to return why are we
[1:10:17] still here cuz we're not leaving a hoof
[1:10:19] behind why we still here because we're
[1:10:21] waiting on prodal there there's still
[1:10:23] Devils to be cast out amen there are
[1:10:25] family Cycles to be broken there are
[1:10:28] families to be restored there are
[1:10:30] stronghold to take amen we're not
[1:10:33] leaving here and the devil go yeah they
[1:10:34] left but I still held this ground no sir
[1:10:37] we're taking all the ground we're taking
[1:10:39] The High Ground we're taking the valleys
[1:10:42] we're taking all of it and we're not
[1:10:44] leaving till it's all
[1:10:46] completed oh that's easy to talk about
[1:10:48] hey but there's strongholds in our lives
[1:10:51] that we're going to conquer before we
[1:10:52] leave we're always pointing we're going
[1:10:54] to conquer this we're going to conquer
[1:10:56] that we got to conquer this we got to
[1:10:59] defeat this right here amen but I'd like
[1:11:02] to announce to you today we have the
[1:11:04] power to do it we're not waiting on it
[1:11:07] to come because the revelation of the
[1:11:09] full word came with the full power of
[1:11:13] that word it wasn't just a head
[1:11:16] knowledge it's not just a mystery it's
[1:11:17] not just a Doctrine but with the opening
[1:11:20] of the word came the unveiling of power
[1:11:22] to you amen and that's what we're
[1:11:25] speaking on today is the unveiling of
[1:11:29] power always
[1:11:32] progressing I was talking to my wife I
[1:11:35] said you
[1:11:37] know sometimes as
[1:11:39] ministers you feel like you get into a
[1:11:41] theme and every time you study something
[1:11:43] you end up on that
[1:11:44] theme and I feel like
[1:11:47] progress has kind of been a theme of
[1:11:49] mine for a while now not being satisfied
[1:11:52] going forward not staying where you're
[1:11:53] at
[1:11:55] the Bible is replete with scriptures
[1:11:58] that encourage us to progress and to
[1:12:00] grow and to move beyond our current
[1:12:03] condition wherever you are today don't
[1:12:05] stay
[1:12:06] there wherever you're at maybe it's in a
[1:12:08] trial maybe it's in depression maybe
[1:12:10] it's bound down with anxiety maybe it's
[1:12:12] Justified maybe it's Sanctified maybe
[1:12:14] you've had an anointing of the Holy
[1:12:16] Ghost poured out on your life don't stay
[1:12:18] there wherever you are today take
[1:12:20] another step well I receive the baptism
[1:12:22] of the Holy Ghost I've been sealed

[1:12:26] in and say Lord I need a refilling I
[1:12:29] need more of you today don't stay
[1:12:34] there Philippians 3
[1:12:37] and12 scriptures a call to
[1:12:39] action urging you to strive to go higher
[1:12:43] higher Heights and deeper depths Paul
[1:12:45] says not as though I had already
[1:12:47] attained either were already perfect but
[1:12:50] I follow
[1:12:52] after if that I may apprehend that which
[1:12:55] I also am apprehended of Christ Jesus
[1:12:58] Brethren I count not myself to have
[1:13:00] apprehended but this one thing I do
[1:13:03] forgetting those things which are behind
[1:13:05] and reaching forth under those things
[1:13:06] which are before I press toward the mark
[1:13:09] of the prize for the prize of the high
[1:13:12] calling in God of God in Christ
[1:13:15] Jesus well who wrote that I bet that was
[1:13:18] somebody really struggling brother
[1:13:20] Aaron now that was the messenger of the
[1:13:22] age
[1:13:25] he says I haven't attained it all I'm
[1:13:29] full of
[1:13:30] imperfections but I'm following after
[1:13:33] you know what that means that means
[1:13:34] pursuing with
[1:13:37] Vigor I must have more I must know him
[1:13:40] more I'm not satisfied with where I'm at
[1:13:43] amen I hope that's the Cry of everybody
[1:13:45] in this room today Lord thank you for
[1:13:47] what you done I appreciate for what You'
[1:13:49] done for me but I am not satisfied with
[1:13:53] where I'm at I've got to go deeper today
[1:13:56] I'm following after I'm pursuing it with
[1:13:58] Vigor I want to leave here changed today
[1:14:01] by the power of God he says I haven't
[1:14:04] apprehended it yet but one thing I do
[1:14:07] forgetting the things which are
[1:14:09] behind reaching for what is before I
[1:14:13] press towards the mark evening light
[1:14:16] Tabernacle press towards the Mark today
[1:14:19] not Coast in not I've received the
[1:14:21] message so now I get to sit back and
[1:14:23] wait for the Rapture you're going to sit
[1:14:25] back and find yourself in the
[1:14:26] tribulation but you got to press towards
[1:14:28] the mark you got to press into eternal
[1:14:31] life you got to fight for it today to
[1:14:33] attain
[1:14:34] more forget what's
[1:14:38] behind forget what you know forget what
[1:14:42] you think you have
[1:14:44] accomplished forget where you have
[1:14:48] failed you can look at this several ways
[1:14:50] forgetting what's
[1:14:52] behind a lot of us need to forget our
[1:14:54] failures
[1:14:57] but a lot of us get hung up on our last
[1:15:00] success I'm not saying to forget the
[1:15:02] grace of God but but but what I'm saying
[1:15:04] is I'll give another example that I've
[1:15:06] given before with the children of
[1:15:08] Israel three weeks later if you were
[1:15:10] still dancing on the banks of the Red
[1:15:12] Sea because of that Victory you was left
[1:15:16] behind it's time to press to another
[1:15:18] Victory it's time to take more land it's
[1:15:22] time to move on from your last Revival
[1:15:24] and step say Lord I need a refilling
[1:15:26] today I need more of you today don't get
[1:15:29] hung up back there there's a race to run

[1:15:36] like that that guy that's still living
[1:15:38] in high school tell you how fast they
[1:15:40] used to
[1:15:41] be and what they used to do that's bro
[1:15:45] you're you're you're an old man
[1:15:49] stop well a lot of Christians are there

[1:16:13] they can't get over their
[1:16:15] failures and then others can't get on

[1:16:23] spirit you we need

[1:17:03] an I'm not worthy
[1:17:05] contest none of us are worthy get over
[1:17:08] yourself can I remind you today of why
[1:17:11] Jesus died he died because we needed a
[1:17:14] savior he died because we were Sinners
[1:17:17] he died because we weren't worthy but he
[1:17:19] said my blood is
[1:17:22] sufficient oh I'm not good enough
[1:17:24] brother Aon I fail I fail I fail quit
[1:17:27] crying we all fail but today by the
[1:17:30] blood of Jesus Christ I'm made clean I'm
[1:17:34] washed a new today in Jesus

[1:17:39] Hallelujah accept his forgiveness and
[1:17:42] let's
[1:17:43] run we got a race to run
[1:17:46] today let's take another step well
[1:17:50] brother Aaron I need a I need a fresh
[1:17:51] outpouring yep we all
[1:17:53] do but what are you doing to prepare for
[1:17:56] that
[1:17:58] outpouring how are you facilitating it
[1:18:01] what are your
[1:18:03] expectations did you walk in here today
[1:18:05] sad because you needed an outpouring or
[1:18:07] did you walk in here today excited
[1:18:09] because you knew you were going to get
[1:18:10] it today there's the
[1:18:12] difference I'm just going through
[1:18:14] something I need God to move and people
[1:18:16] live in that place for months and months
[1:18:18] and months why you got to move he's here
[1:18:22] he's willing he's ready he's looking for
[1:18:24] somebody expecting well I've just been
[1:18:26] in a rut he's here to pull you out of it
[1:18:29] he's saying I'm right here and all you
[1:18:31] got to do say Lord I'm willing I'm ready
[1:18:34] to do whatever it takes move in my life
[1:18:36] today Lord
[1:18:42] Jesus pursue with
[1:18:44] Vigor are you pressing towards the mark
[1:18:47] with all that is within you saying God I
[1:18:50] must have more of you today Paul would
[1:18:53] go on to say I Die daily
[1:18:56] listen this wasn't some halfway
[1:18:57] borderline guy sitting on the edge and
[1:19:00] man I got sin in my life and habits
[1:19:02] attached to my life I really need to get
[1:19:04] rid of so man I'm struggling every day
[1:19:07] now this was the
[1:19:09] messenger this is the writer of the New
[1:19:12] Testament and he's saying I'm not
[1:19:15] settling for how far I've come I'm going
[1:19:18] to get rid of more of me so that I might
[1:19:21] know more of
[1:19:23] him brother Brown says Paul said I Die
[1:19:25] daily and if Paul had to Die daily how
[1:19:29] much more am I going I'm going to have
[1:19:32] to stay Dead all the time if Paul had to
[1:19:35] Die daily to stay right with God so
[1:19:37] we'll all have to do that just die out
[1:19:40] to ourselves he says now I don't mean to
[1:19:43] say you went out in the world and you
[1:19:44] did this and that but you done
[1:19:49] something oh brother surely not yeah you
[1:19:52] done something
[1:19:54] that's true he says you've got to repent
[1:19:57] and Die daily to live in Jesus Christ so
[1:20:01] every daily every day you've got to die
[1:20:04] every day to live in Christ
[1:20:08] Jesus everything about the Christian
[1:20:12] Life involves going further and
[1:20:14] experiencing more Enoch what'd he do
[1:20:19] walked with
[1:20:21] God he didn't stand still he was moving
[1:20:24] moving he was progressing and as
[1:20:26] individuals I just want to say we can't
[1:20:28] settle today we can't settle because
[1:20:31] you've come out we can't settle because
[1:20:33] you're a message believer or because you
[1:20:35] shouted or you danced but make the
[1:20:38] determination I'm going all the
[1:20:41] way what do you mean all the way brother
[1:20:43] Aaron that means you don't stop at
[1:20:45] justification you don't stop at
[1:20:47] sanctification get born again and sealed
[1:20:49] by the spirit of God and then many
[1:20:52] people stop right there
[1:20:54] well I had an experience awesome now go
[1:20:57] all the
[1:20:59] way what do you mean get get full of the
[1:21:02] spirit and then go all the way fight
[1:21:04] today to know him more fight today to
[1:21:07] experience him more fight today for
[1:21:09] greater Revelation fight today to be the
[1:21:12] version of yourself that God intended
[1:21:14] you to be going all the way don't just
[1:21:17] mean getting full of the Holy Spirit uh
[1:21:19] we got to that's the token but going all
[1:21:23] the way means until the day I'm raptured
[1:21:25] I'm going to fight to attain more that's
[1:21:28] going all the way until the day I'm
[1:21:31] raptured I'm going to press towards the
[1:21:34] mark of the high calling and I believe
[1:21:37] that's also how we as a broad body the
[1:21:41] collective body from the world around
[1:21:42] the world have to be also not just
[1:21:44] satisfied with correct Doctrine not just
[1:21:47] satisfied in the knowledge of the
[1:21:49] Mysteries not not satisfied with just
[1:21:51] the mechanics or even just the
[1:21:56] Dynamics you get out of balance either
[1:21:59] way amen because when we settle we make
[1:22:02] void the entire point of the restoration
[1:22:06] and we go back to operating in portions
[1:22:10] again the point of the restoration was
[1:22:12] you don't got to operate in just a
[1:22:14] portion
[1:22:16] anymore that's the error people make
[1:22:18] they say well we don't have to do these
[1:22:20] things anymore because now that which is
[1:22:22] perfect has come that which in part is
[1:22:24] done away
[1:22:25] with because we have the
[1:22:28] hole did did we not go to elementary
[1:22:31] school did we not do a pie chart y'all
[1:22:34] remember pie chart and if every piece of
[1:22:38] pizza is there sorry I'm a fatty I think
[1:22:40] about food it's
[1:22:43] pizza if every piece of pizza's there we
[1:22:46] got the
[1:22:47] hole but think of how smart it is to go
[1:22:51] but now that we've got the hole we don't
[1:22:52] need these three pieces throw them away
[1:22:55] you don't have the hole no
[1:22:58] more the pieces make the hole the parts
[1:23:01] make the hole what it's saying is you
[1:23:04] don't have to operate on that piece
[1:23:06] alone anymore this isn't the only piece
[1:23:10] you have so we're not doing that's done
[1:23:12] away with just this part or just this
[1:23:14] part now we've got all the
[1:23:20] parts you can't throw Parts away and
[1:23:22] still claim to have the whole you don't
[1:23:25] have the
[1:23:28] whole and I'll just address this to to
[1:23:31] evening light Tabernacle this morning we
[1:23:33] can't settle for formal and traditional
[1:23:35] Services where you know maybe even the
[1:23:38] word is explained perfectly and
[1:23:40] Mysteries are unfolded to a
[1:23:42] tea and we're just Wild by it and yet
[1:23:46] the spirit's
[1:23:49] lacking listen this is not a dead
[1:23:52] word this message is not not a dead
[1:23:55] message this word is full of life this
[1:23:58] word is full of Victory this word is
[1:24:00] full of healing this word is full of
[1:24:03] Deliverance it's not a dead message it's
[1:24:06] a Living Word and we are supposed to be
[1:24:08] a living people today full of the power
[1:24:11] of God not making excuses for why it's
[1:24:14] missing why we don't need it you need it
[1:24:17] it's here it's available we just got to
[1:24:19] move past our ideas and say Lord pour it
[1:24:22] out in my life I want to tap in to the
[1:24:24] power of God this
[1:24:26] morning
[1:24:28] Hallelujah I'll tell you I'm faithful
[1:24:31] that faith is preached
[1:24:34] here there's lots of things Jesus could
[1:24:37] have said but he said when I return will
[1:24:39] I
[1:24:41] find I'm thankful that faith is preached
[1:24:44] here and expectations are raised to
[1:24:46] expect the impossible to expect the
[1:24:49] supernatural to expect the miraculous
[1:24:51] every service listen I'm expecting an
[1:24:53] outpouring today
[1:24:55] I'm expecting to move in this service
[1:24:56] today I'm expecting the miraculous today
[1:24:59] because it's been taught that we are to
[1:25:01] expect it and it's been fostered and
[1:25:03] it's been ministered Time After Time
[1:25:05] After Time and he has showed up Time
[1:25:08] After Time After Time and I Just Want to
[1:25:10] Thank You Lord For showing up where we
[1:25:12] invite you but I'm saying Lord I need
[1:25:14] you today I need a fresh outpouring
[1:25:16] today I'm expecting you to move at
[1:25:19] evening light Tabernacle in this service
[1:25:21] at my Pew
[1:25:23] today
[1:25:26] hallelujah thank you
[1:25:28] Jesus because where faith is not
[1:25:31] preached you find a faithless
[1:25:34] congregation when the moving of the
[1:25:36] spirit isn't preached you find places
[1:25:38] where the spirit doesn't
[1:25:40] move well we believe in those things
[1:25:43] brother Aaron that's good but why aren't
[1:25:45] they
[1:25:51] manifesting because they're not preached
[1:25:55] we have to keep those things those
[1:25:57] truths in front of us at all times so
[1:25:58] that our level of expectation is at the
[1:26:01] level of the
[1:26:03] promise because we can say we believe in
[1:26:07] something and not be expecting
[1:26:09] it
[1:26:11] right you can say you believe in
[1:26:14] something and not be expecting
[1:26:19] it things like freedom of the spirit
[1:26:22] freedom of worship that's something that
[1:26:25] fostered over a period of time by the
[1:26:28] leadership and the congregation of the
[1:26:30] church amen it's something that's
[1:26:32] fostered over time you know breakout
[1:26:34] Services where the power of God really
[1:26:36] moves and there's a there's a great
[1:26:38] response those things happen because the
[1:26:40] people feel free to respond because the
[1:26:44] atmospheres have been fostered and even
[1:26:48] promoted if every time the spirit moves
[1:26:50] and people rejoice and shout and the
[1:26:52] minister gets up and starts warning
[1:26:54] about it well y'all be careful about
[1:26:56] that
[1:26:58] now y'all y'all be careful about that
[1:27:00] because you know you know you could be
[1:27:01] deceived and and it's not really and
[1:27:03] it's
[1:27:04] not then the people get all
[1:27:07] confused well are we are we supposed to
[1:27:09] worship are we supposed to be fre can we
[1:27:11] be am I wrong for doing that sh should I
[1:27:14] even can I even are we supposed to and
[1:27:17] then that same person come there and go
[1:27:18] I believe in
[1:27:21] it but the people don't know
[1:27:27] the people aren't
[1:27:29] sure I'm thankful to be at a place and
[1:27:31] there's other places all all over this
[1:27:33] ain't just a evening like Tabernacle
[1:27:34] thing there's places all over where God
[1:27:36] is free to move how he wants to
[1:27:39] move where the spirit has complete
[1:27:41] freedom to work and operate the way that
[1:27:44] he wants to work and operate I say we
[1:27:46] want everything that God has for us I
[1:27:49] want solid teaching I want Evangelistic
[1:27:52] preaching we want a true Godly balance
[1:27:55] we we we don't want to settle into
[1:27:57] comfortable we don't want to settle into
[1:27:59] status quo and and this is how we do
[1:28:01] church and every Service is like this
[1:28:03] tradition and
[1:28:07] Norms tradition and
[1:28:09] Norms I want to show up going I don't
[1:28:12] know what's going to happen today and I
[1:28:14] don't care as long as God's in it as
[1:28:16] long as God's moving I just want him to
[1:28:18] have his way I sure don't want my
[1:28:20] attitude and my expectation to hinder
[1:28:22] what God is going to do
[1:28:25] Lord just move how you want to move
[1:28:27] whatever it takes to save a soul
[1:28:29] whatever it takes for a Deliverance
[1:28:30] today whatever it takes to light a fire
[1:28:32] in my heart today Lord just do it I'm
[1:28:35] open to it I'm inviting you Lord I know
[1:28:37] the word is open I'm thankful the word's
[1:28:39] open but with the word came great power
[1:28:42] and I want to see it manifested in this
[1:28:44] place
[1:28:45] today
[1:28:48] Hallelujah but as a body evening like
[1:28:50] Tabernacle let us walk on advancing in
[1:28:53] the word advancing in Revelation
[1:28:55] advancing in power that's my
[1:28:59] expectation as we stand here on his
[1:29:01] promises that we're going to see more
[1:29:03] than we've ever seen before we're going
[1:29:05] to see more manifested in 2025 than
[1:29:08] we've ever seen before we're going to
[1:29:10] see healings like we've never seen
[1:29:12] before we're going to see Deliverance
[1:29:14] like we've never seen before we're going
[1:29:15] to see prodal come back like we've never
[1:29:18] seen before that is my expectation
[1:29:21] because he is a god of increase amen is
[1:29:24] a god of increase so as we go further
[1:29:26] I'm expecting more I'm expecting greater
[1:29:29] not less and
[1:29:32] less more and more he doesn't back up
[1:29:37] and get
[1:29:38] less we didn't get down here to lead DEA
[1:29:41] with wickedness on the
[1:29:44] increase the devil on the
[1:29:46] increase millions of demons released
[1:29:48] from the river Euphrates and God
[1:29:51] says now that I have sent a message to
[1:29:54] restore the word I'm going to expect you
[1:29:56] to grow in great head
[1:29:58] knowledge and I'm going to pull back on
[1:30:00] the Deliverance for a
[1:30:02] while I'm going to pull back on the
[1:30:04] supernatural I'm going I'm going to pull
[1:30:05] back on the healings and you're going to
[1:30:07] have less power as you face greater
[1:30:10] enemies no it doesn't even make good
[1:30:14] sense if you stop and think about it for
[1:30:16] a minute but with the opening of the
[1:30:19] word came more power and more Authority
[1:30:22] power over the flesh power over sin
[1:30:25] power over the devil power over the
[1:30:27] lukewarm Spirit power to do the Greater
[1:30:30] Works of John 14:12 power for a body
[1:30:33] change power for a Rapture more than
[1:30:36] ever
[1:30:37] before Hallelujah God is a god of
[1:30:41] increase and he's given us everything we
[1:30:43] need today to put our foot on the heads
[1:30:46] of the serpent what Serpent's attacking
[1:30:48] your home what Serpent's attacking your
[1:30:51] body what serpent is attacking your mind
[1:30:53] you are the last serpent bruisers in the
[1:30:56] final age and you have the power today
[1:30:58] to take your foot and put it on the
[1:31:00] devil and say that's enough no more your
[1:31:02] attack stopped today your Victory stops
[1:31:05] today because I've been empowered as the
[1:31:07] Bride of Jesus Christ under the opening
[1:31:09] of The Seven Seals I've been given
[1:31:12] authority over you
[1:31:16] Hallelujah and he's going to continue to
[1:31:18] pour out his Spirit he's going to
[1:31:21] continue to pour out his power until we
[1:31:23] take the total Victory and leave here in
[1:31:25] a
[1:31:26] Rapture acts
[1:31:31] 2:17 says then it shall come to pass in
[1:31:33] the last
[1:31:35] days it didn't say next to the last days
[1:31:38] it didn't say 40 years before the last
[1:31:41] days the last days where are we the last
[1:31:49] days saith God I will pour out my spirit
[1:31:53] upon All Flesh and your sons and your
[1:31:56] daughters shall prophesy and your young
[1:31:59] men shall see visions and your old men
[1:32:02] shall dream
[1:32:03] dreams well brother Aaron if we got
[1:32:05] people seeing visions and people having
[1:32:07] spiritual dreams and they're being inter
[1:32:09] that takes away from the
[1:32:12] prophet that's just
[1:32:16] dumb if you don't have it it takes away
[1:32:19] from the Bible
[1:32:24] and on my servants and on my handmaidens
[1:32:26] I will pour out in those days my spirit
[1:32:30] and they shall prophesy so a little
[1:32:34] class participation I asked you where
[1:32:35] are we at last days how much is he going
[1:32:39] to give this he's going to sprinkle a
[1:32:42] little bit here and and this one's going
[1:32:44] to get some of it and and this one the
[1:32:48] super super gifted people and there's
[1:32:51] going to be one here and
[1:32:54] I will pour out my spirit upon All
[1:33:01] Flesh poor I like the word that he uses
[1:33:05] here to describe it how do you describe
[1:33:07] it when you look out the window and it's
[1:33:09] just kind of barely
[1:33:11] raining it's
[1:33:13] misting come to pass in the last days
[1:33:15] that I will
[1:33:16] Mist out my
[1:33:20] spirit or it's rain a little bit harder
[1:33:22] than that it's turned into a
[1:33:24] sprinkle that's trinitarian
[1:33:28] anyway he's sprinkling no no no no when
[1:33:32] you look out there and you know we have
[1:33:34] other Expressions it's raining like cats
[1:33:36] and dogs it's it's coming down in sheets
[1:33:39] but you know how it is to where you
[1:33:41] can't get from here to there without
[1:33:43] getting completely drenched you can't
[1:33:45] get in your vehicle without getting
[1:33:47] completely drenched I mean covered from
[1:33:49] head to toe I mean completely spping wet
[1:33:53] you say it's pouring out there I'm
[1:33:56] telling you in the last days it is
[1:33:58] pouring out it's time that you put away
[1:34:02] your umbrellas lay down your pride quit
[1:34:05] being afraid of it and step out into the
[1:34:07] porn and say cover me up Lord however I
[1:34:11] hack whatever I got to do I'm done
[1:34:14] pretending but pour it out on me Lord
[1:34:20] Jesus I get tired of people sitting
[1:34:22] underneath their umbrella was laughing
[1:34:24] at the people dancing in the rain I say
[1:34:26] forget about it just dance in the rain
[1:34:29] pour it out on me Lord Jesus I got to
[1:34:32] have it
[1:34:36] today
[1:34:38] Glory pour it out Lord
[1:34:42] Jesus well we don't need that God
[1:34:45] thought we
[1:34:50] did and he
[1:34:52] promised you're going to have
[1:34:56] it are you expecting it he's a god of
[1:35:01] increase more Revelation more power from
[1:35:06] the beginning and I may slow down here
[1:35:08] for a little bit from the beginning
[1:35:10] that's how God has done things he's
[1:35:13] revealed himself in a progressive
[1:35:16] manner revealing more unveiling more and
[1:35:20] as he reveals more of himself than what
[1:35:23] that with that Revelation comes more
[1:35:27] power he would reveal
[1:35:30] himself and what he was doing by his
[1:35:32] name there in the Old Testament and just
[1:35:36] so we understand what I'm talking about
[1:35:37] I got a few examples says these are the
[1:35:39] generations of the heavens and of the
[1:35:41] earth when they were creating in the day
[1:35:43] that the Lord God made the earth and the
[1:35:47] heavens notice all caps on the word Lord
[1:35:50] capital L capital O capital r and
[1:35:52] capital D
[1:35:54] in the King James it always is this way
[1:35:56] when it's referring to
[1:35:57] Jehovah so when you see it all
[1:35:59] capitalized that's Jehovah which means
[1:36:02] the self-existing
[1:36:04] one but there's notations in the
[1:36:08] scoffield that
[1:36:09] Haba from which Jehovah or Yahweh is
[1:36:13] formed signifies also to
[1:36:16] become that is to become known thus
[1:36:19] pointing to a continuous and increasing
[1:36:22] self-revelation so the name Jehovah then
[1:36:24] would mean the self-existent one who
[1:36:28] reveals
[1:36:30] himself he's constantly
[1:36:33] revealing himself it's a constant
[1:36:36] unfolding never a backing
[1:36:39] up never a backing up there's no going
[1:36:45] backwards and taking away what he
[1:36:48] gives okay once he gives it you have it
[1:36:52] now that doesn't mean that you're not
[1:36:54] supposed to go
[1:36:55] forward but you never go back behind
[1:36:57] that it's like people who are so afraid
[1:37:00] of what God gave at
[1:37:03] isua listen isua accepting the gifts and
[1:37:06] the moving of the spirit and those
[1:37:07] things was never their error their error
[1:37:09] was rejecting the
[1:37:11] word their error was not taking what God
[1:37:13] gave them and going into the
[1:37:16] word you say well we're going to do away
[1:37:18] with that okay well let's do away with
[1:37:22] sanctification and everybody for
[1:37:24] that let's do away with
[1:37:27] justification we don't need that anymore
[1:37:29] we got the opening of the
[1:37:32] word does that even make good
[1:37:35] sense no God's always going forward take
[1:37:37] what he's given you and
[1:37:40] progress
[1:37:42] don't settle down on it like the
[1:37:45] Pentecost did with you got to have the
[1:37:47] tongues to have the Holy Ghost and and
[1:37:49] then they began to manufacture things
[1:37:52] they got all complete out of order we
[1:37:54] know how that how that all went because
[1:37:56] they wouldn't progress we got to take
[1:37:58] what he's given us and progress there's
[1:38:00] no backing up or going backwards just
[1:38:02] another example of this one in Genesis
[1:38:04] 12 now the Lord capital L capital O
[1:38:07] capital r capital D had said unto Abram
[1:38:09] get thee out of thy country from thy
[1:38:11] Kindred and from thy Father's House unto
[1:38:13] a land I will show thee what you're
[1:38:14] seeing here once again is the name
[1:38:17] Jehovah but if you look just a little
[1:38:19] further on in Genesis 17 And1 you see a
[1:38:23] further unveiling and when Abram was 90
[1:38:25] years old and nine the lord it's Jehovah
[1:38:29] appeared to Abram and said unto
[1:38:31] him I am the almighty God walk before me
[1:38:37] and be thou perfect so now here almighty
[1:38:40] God translates to
[1:38:43] elai so what is it it was another
[1:38:45] unfolding of who he was another aspect
[1:38:48] of his nature it was it was expressing
[1:38:50] what he's doing at the time and there
[1:38:52] are many other other examples that we
[1:38:54] could show in other scriptures but just
[1:38:55] to go quickly when he provided a ram for
[1:38:58] Abraham he was expressing himself as
[1:39:00] Jehovah Gyra it was another
[1:39:03] unfolding it was another unveiling and
[1:39:06] his nature and his character is
[1:39:07] progressively being unfolded all through
[1:39:09] the scriptures and I'm going to skip
[1:39:11] from there all the way to the beginning
[1:39:14] of the New
[1:39:16] Testament and
[1:39:18] then the
[1:39:20] word arrives on the scene
[1:39:23] as
[1:39:25] Jesus all the names and we didn't list
[1:39:27] but a couple of them but all the
[1:39:29] compound names all the prophecies all
[1:39:32] the unveilings pointing to this and now
[1:39:34] all of it is manifested in Jesus he was
[1:39:37] the wisdom of Solomon he was the Psalms
[1:39:40] of David he encompassed all of the Old
[1:39:43] Testament he is the highest revelation
[1:39:46] of God he is mzc he is El Shai he is
[1:39:50] Jehovah Gyra he is Jehovah Rafa
[1:39:54] amen there is not a greater revelation
[1:39:57] of God than in Jesus and from him comes
[1:40:01] all other
[1:40:03] Revelations he is the fullness of the
[1:40:05] word and here he was in flesh standing
[1:40:09] upon the
[1:40:12] Earth and by the logic of many today
[1:40:14] since the fullness had come then he
[1:40:17] wouldn't manifest any of the powers that
[1:40:18] were spoke about
[1:40:21] before because he was the the
[1:40:24] fullness so since the fullness was there
[1:40:27] then we were we were Beyond
[1:40:29] healing we were Beyond Supernatural
[1:40:33] things those things were
[1:40:36] childish the fullness was here so all he
[1:40:38] was going to do was teach and make sure
[1:40:40] that you understood the
[1:40:44] Mysteries and what we saw was the word
[1:40:46] made flesh manifested itself not just in
[1:40:50] knowledge but with power and withth
[1:40:53] Authority yes he taught yes he taught
[1:40:56] like no man had ever taught before and
[1:40:58] then what he taught was
[1:41:01] demonstrated amen I can't understand the
[1:41:04] attitude that because we have the
[1:41:05] fullness of the word then that the
[1:41:07] manifestation of that word is now going
[1:41:10] to cease and
[1:41:11] decrease that those things are only
[1:41:14] going to we're only there to catch the
[1:41:16] attention of people to draw them to the
[1:41:19] word yes that's true but it's progress
[1:41:22] you don't leave those things behind they
[1:41:24] come along with you what I know is that
[1:41:27] when the fullness of the word was made
[1:41:30] flesh 2,000 years ago in the man Christ
[1:41:33] Jesus the word made flesh was full of
[1:41:37] power that's what I know what did the
[1:41:39] fullness of the word do how did the
[1:41:42] fullness of the word act how did the
[1:41:44] greatest of all Revelations manifest
[1:41:48] itself and Jesus went about all Galilee
[1:41:51] teaching yes he did in the synagogue and
[1:41:53] preaching the gospel of the kingdom and
[1:41:55] healing all manner of sickness and all
[1:41:58] manner of disease among the people and
[1:42:00] his Fain went throughout all Syria and
[1:42:02] they brought unto him all sick people
[1:42:04] that were taken with diverse diseases
[1:42:06] and torments and those which were
[1:42:08] possessed with devils and those which
[1:42:10] were lunatic and those that had the py
[1:42:13] and he sent them away and said don't you
[1:42:15] know it's about the
[1:42:21] Mysteries and he
[1:42:23] healed
[1:42:26] them it's the very nature of
[1:42:30] Jesus the greatest Revelation the
[1:42:34] greatest embodiment of the word the
[1:42:37] complete fullness and so Jesus said unto
[1:42:40] them we have the word now so y'all just
[1:42:42] going to have to be
[1:42:45] sick y'all just going to have to stay
[1:42:47] bound up we're Beyond those
[1:42:49] things no sir the fullness of the word
[1:42:52] brought the full of his power there was
[1:42:55] healing power there was delivering power
[1:42:58] there was power to provide there was
[1:43:00] power to create he was everything you
[1:43:02] had seen in the Old Testament rolled
[1:43:04] into one he created a universe he came
[1:43:06] and he created
[1:43:09] eyeballs he was still a Healer he was
[1:43:11] still a Creator he was still a provider
[1:43:13] he was all those things and he was full
[1:43:16] of quickening
[1:43:18] power prophet of God says our lord Jesus
[1:43:21] is so full of quickening power he he was
[1:43:23] all of it together he was so full of
[1:43:25] quickening power he said this you
[1:43:27] destroy this body and I'll raise it up
[1:43:29] in three days you talk about confidence
[1:43:31] and quickening power destroy this body
[1:43:34] and this Temple and I will bring it up
[1:43:36] in three days now look I'm going to get
[1:43:40] a little bit of my ahead of myself right
[1:43:41] here and that's okay the word is once
[1:43:44] again in flesh the word is once again
[1:43:48] embodied behind human beings and it's
[1:43:50] full of quickening power she is bone of
[1:43:53] his bone she's flesh of his flesh she's
[1:43:55] power of his power she is him she is
[1:44:00] what he is I say what devil can stand
[1:44:03] before him what mountain can stand
[1:44:04] before him then what are you worried
[1:44:06] about today what devil can stand before
[1:44:08] you what mountain can stand before you
[1:44:11] no wonder you're the mountain movers no
[1:44:13] wonder you're the serpent bruisers today

[1:44:17] crumble before you because your bone of
[1:44:19] his bone little bride you are full of

[1:44:33] done this for hours and he' have never
[1:44:35] killed Goliath I got power in this sling
[1:44:38] there's power in this word I got faith
[1:44:41] look at the Mysteries no sir you got to
[1:44:43] turn it loose one of these days let the
[1:44:45] quickening power go to its Mark and
[1:44:47] bring your giant down today it's more
[1:44:51] than just word it's more just talking

[1:45:10] the Earth one of these
[1:45:11] days because you have the same
[1:45:13] quickening
[1:45:14] power he was the
[1:45:17] fullness he was all of it he was full of
[1:45:20] quickening power
[1:45:23] and when the church Spilled Out Of The
[1:45:25] Upper Room on the day of
[1:45:29] Pentecost it was like he had never
[1:45:35] left it was like he had never
[1:45:39] left Peter and John leave the upper room
[1:45:42] in the very next
[1:45:44] chapter they come down past the gate
[1:45:46] called Beautiful on their way to the
[1:45:48] temple and there lays a beggar the Bible
[1:45:51] said had been lame from birth
[1:45:54] begging for
[1:45:55] arms Bible says who seen Peter and John
[1:45:57] about to go into the temple asking arm
[1:46:00] and Peter fastened his eyes upon him
[1:46:02] with John and said look on
[1:46:05] us you talk about
[1:46:08] confidence they knew look they hadn't
[1:46:10] been indoctrinated with that was for the
[1:46:12] days gone by they hadn't been
[1:46:15] indoctrinated with that was only for the
[1:46:17] prophet they hadn't been filled up with
[1:46:19] ecclesiastical doubt they just left the
[1:46:22] upper room they knew what happened right
[1:46:25] he walked up and said look on
[1:46:28] us and he gave him heed unto them
[1:46:32] expecting to receive something he was
[1:46:34] going
[1:46:35] to now I know we take
[1:46:38] this and we say well yeah he was
[1:46:41] expecting arms I just want to focus on
[1:46:44] something else he was
[1:46:48] expecting he was
[1:46:50] expecting they had got their attention
[1:46:52] and he was expecting expecting something
[1:46:54] and he was going to receive greater than
[1:46:56] he ever expected God don't disappoint
[1:46:59] you God don't disappointed Lord I'm here
[1:47:02] to receive today you'll receive and
[1:47:04] you'll receive even more than you could
[1:47:06] ever imagine he's not going to
[1:47:08] disappoint he was expecting to receive
[1:47:10] something then Peter said Silver and
[1:47:11] Gold Have I None but such as I have what
[1:47:14] do he
[1:47:15] have quickening
[1:47:19] power such as I have give I Thee in the
[1:47:23] name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up
[1:47:25] and walk and he took him by the right
[1:47:27] hand and lifted him up and immediately
[1:47:29] his feet and ankle bones receive
[1:47:30] strength and he leaping up stood and
[1:47:33] walked and entered with them into the
[1:47:36] temple
[1:47:37] quietly as to not disturb the people who
[1:47:41] think that's out of
[1:47:46] order I've said it many many many many
[1:47:48] many many many times we're not all going
[1:47:51] to worship the same
[1:47:53] some are going to be quieter that's fine
[1:47:56] some are going to be loud that's
[1:48:03] okay we love
[1:48:08] it but when God does something for you
[1:48:12] and nobody knows about
[1:48:15] it thank you Jesus
[1:48:20] you makes me wonder I mean he wasn't
[1:48:23] ashamed to come down and be identified
[1:48:24] with you he wasn't ashamed to come down
[1:48:27] and do a miracle for you an undeserving
[1:48:30] person he came down and and did
[1:48:32] something for you in that moment when
[1:48:34] God does something for you when God
[1:48:36] speaks to your heart when God gives a
[1:48:38] revelation don't be afraid to say thank
[1:48:40] you Jesus thank you Lord I love you
[1:48:43] Jesus I'm here to praise your name he
[1:48:44] entered into the temple walking and
[1:48:46] leaping and praising God they knew
[1:48:49] something had happened well that might
[1:48:51] get people's attention yep praise God
[1:48:53] now I got an audience to testify to let
[1:48:56] me tell you what God did for me God
[1:48:58] saved me when I was a wretched sinner I
[1:49:00] was no good I was lost I was going to
[1:49:02] hell I didn't stand a chance and I
[1:49:04] didn't deserve it but he reached out his
[1:49:06] hand for me and so I'm walking and
[1:49:09] leaping and praising God because he is a
[1:49:12] wonderful God and he deserves my
[1:49:17] praise sir brother BR says when Peter
[1:49:20] and John passed through the gate called
[1:49:21] Beautiful lifted up the man that had
[1:49:23] been crippled from his mother's wound it
[1:49:24] was a sign God was in the
[1:49:27] camp when the Holy Ghost returned on
[1:49:30] Pentecost and endued that bunch of
[1:49:31] people with power power it was a
[1:49:36] sign God was in the
[1:49:38] camp well I think it's all a bunch of
[1:49:40] hogwash when that goes on I think it's a
[1:49:42] sign God's in the
[1:49:46] camp thank you Lord Peter had it after
[1:49:49] Pentecost and he went to the gate called
[1:49:51] beautiful and there laid a man crippled
[1:49:52] from his mother's womb said Silver and
[1:49:54] Gold Have I None but I got some hidden
[1:49:57] power I'll give you if you'll believe it
[1:49:59] and he picked him up by the hand and
[1:50:00] raise him in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:50:02] rise up and walk and you knew what he
[1:50:04] projected hidden power listen I know
[1:50:09] sometimes it looks hidden sometimes
[1:50:10] we're beat down sometimes we come
[1:50:12] together and it's like my goodness how
[1:50:13] did everybody in the whole church have a
[1:50:16] bad day on the same
[1:50:19] day but even then
[1:50:22] even then well this one's got issues and
[1:50:25] that one's carnal that's okay that's
[1:50:27] what bayac saw and he tried to get balum
[1:50:28] to curse them all but brother Brandon
[1:50:30] points out in the midst of that flawed
[1:50:32] people those people with their backside
[1:50:34] and their carnal Parts even then the
[1:50:37] pillar of fire was in their midst even
[1:50:39] then God moved amongst them with signs
[1:50:41] and wonders and the supernatural maybe
[1:50:43] you had a bad day maybe you seen my
[1:50:46] carnality that's okay even then God move
[1:50:49] in this place manifest yourself here
[1:50:52] like never
[1:50:54] before well this one does this and this
[1:50:56] one bothers me and this one and this one
[1:50:58] and this one keep that list together to
[1:51:00] read to Jesus on that
[1:51:03] [Music]
[1:51:06] day I believe the Bible I just don't
[1:51:08] believe and going to church with all
[1:51:10] them people if you
[1:51:12] don't you can't not go to church and
[1:51:14] claim to believe the
[1:51:16] Bible end of
[1:51:20] argument because the Bible says to
[1:51:26] what were they doing after
[1:51:28] Pentecost it was like he had never left
[1:51:31] they did the same works because they
[1:51:33] were operating in the same
[1:51:39] power this is the book of Acts you know
[1:51:41] it well says and there was at japa a
[1:51:43] certain disciple named Tabitha which by
[1:51:45] interpretation is called Dorcas this
[1:51:47] woman was full of good works and all
[1:51:49] arms Deeds which she did and it came to
[1:51:50] pass in those days that she was sick and
[1:51:53] died man I wish Jesus was still here
[1:51:58] Joe I I wish Jesus we still here he is
[1:52:03] he just veiled in a multi membered body
[1:52:07] now the same power same
[1:52:11] power whom when they had washed they
[1:52:13] laid her in an upper chamber and for as
[1:52:15] much as L was not to japa and the
[1:52:16] disciples had heard that Peter was there
[1:52:18] they sent unto him two men Desiring him
[1:52:20] that he would not delay to come to them
[1:52:22] then then Peter arose and went with them
[1:52:23] and when he was come they brought him
[1:52:25] into the upper
[1:52:27] chamber I'm going to be real nice and
[1:52:30] just keep going and all the
[1:52:34] widows stood by him
[1:52:40] weeping and showing the coats and
[1:52:42] garments which Dorcas
[1:52:44] made while she was with them but Peter
[1:52:47] put them all
[1:52:50] forth listen when you get doubt out of
[1:52:53] the
[1:52:55] building Supernatural can take
[1:53:00] place Peter put them all out forth and
[1:53:04] kneel down and prayed and turned him to
[1:53:06] the body and said Tabitha arise I wonder
[1:53:09] where he learned to operate that
[1:53:13] way
[1:53:19] arise I a even going go all the way back
[1:53:21] to Jesus although that that's the main
[1:53:23] source to go to but let's just go back
[1:53:24] to the message that we claim to believe
[1:53:27] and
[1:53:29] follow how do we get off with some of
[1:53:32] the ways we act because it sure didn't
[1:53:33] teach us to act that
[1:53:36] way taught us to have faith it taught us
[1:53:39] to believe for the miraculous it taught
[1:53:41] us to believe for the supernatural it
[1:53:43] taught us that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:53:45] yesterday that was the theme of the
[1:53:47] message Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:53:49] today and forever we're in the Forever
[1:53:51] part amen still the
[1:53:54] same arise and she opened her eyes and
[1:53:57] when she saw Peter she sat
[1:54:00] up how'd he do it same power it was as
[1:54:03] though he never left acts 16 the same
[1:54:07] followed Paul and us and cried saying
[1:54:10] these men are the Servants of the most
[1:54:12] high God which show unto us the way of
[1:54:14] Salvation and this she did many days but
[1:54:16] Paul being grieved he got tired of it
[1:54:20] turned and said to the spirit I command
[1:54:21] thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come
[1:54:23] out of her and he came out that same
[1:54:25] hour same
[1:54:27] power same power in Acts 14 Paul heals a
[1:54:31] man acts 28 puas his father is
[1:54:34] healed and it causes a healing service
[1:54:35] to break out on the entire Island prison
[1:54:37] gates are open in Acts 12 prison doors
[1:54:40] and chains are loose in Acts 16 they
[1:54:42] were operating with the same power doing
[1:54:45] the same works it was the true church it
[1:54:48] was Mark 16 in action
[1:54:52] Amen brother brandom says the true
[1:54:53] church is Mark 16 and acts and says it
[1:54:55] has to be and then he drives that down a
[1:54:59] little harder and he says all else is
[1:55:03] false that's right and he said unto them
[1:55:06] go ye into all the world and preach the
[1:55:07] gospel to every creature and he that
[1:55:09] believeth and is baptized shall be saved
[1:55:11] but he that believeth not shall be
[1:55:12] damned and these signs shall follow them
[1:55:14] that believe in my name they shall cast
[1:55:16] out Devils they shall speak with new
[1:55:17] tongues they shall take up serpents and
[1:55:19] if they drink any deadly thing it shall
[1:55:21] not hurt them they shall lay hands on
[1:55:23] the sick and they shall recover what was
[1:55:27] the book of Acts doing they were
[1:55:28] fulfilling this
[1:55:31] commission they were the true church the
[1:55:34] same power on display but now in a many
[1:55:37] membered body and as we have seen up to
[1:55:39] this point every Revelation and every
[1:55:42] unfolding brought with it more power
[1:55:45] more Victory and here we are today and
[1:55:49] brother brandham says what the church
[1:55:50] had at Pentecost is her in Alien able
[1:55:53] right originally she had the pure word
[1:55:56] now notice something people want to
[1:55:58] separate the fullness and the pureness
[1:56:00] of the word from the moving of the
[1:56:03] spirit but look here she had the pure
[1:56:06] word she had the power of the spirit you
[1:56:10] can have them
[1:56:14] both manifested in diverse signs and
[1:56:17] wonders
[1:56:19] and gifts
[1:56:24] gifts go with the pure
[1:56:26] word it all goes
[1:56:29] together it's all in
[1:56:32] one but we know that there's a true and
[1:56:34] there's a
[1:56:35] false we know that there is a church
[1:56:38] spiritual and a church
[1:56:40] carnal and Paul's
[1:56:42] warning even in Acts 20 that the Wolves
[1:56:45] would enter in carnal men speaking
[1:56:48] things contrary to the truth John War
[1:56:52] warns in John 4 that many false prophets
[1:56:54] have already gone out into the world the
[1:56:57] Antichrist Spirits already at work with
[1:56:59] the goal of of perverting the pure word
[1:57:02] and what do you
[1:57:04] find when the pure word is
[1:57:07] perverted less
[1:57:09] signs less
[1:57:11] wonders less Miracles less freedom and
[1:57:15] more formal as carnal man came and began
[1:57:19] to squeeze the life right out of the
[1:57:20] church began to prosecute the True
[1:57:23] Believer began to ridicule and attack
[1:57:25] anywhere that the spirit moved and claim
[1:57:27] that those things showed that the focus
[1:57:29] wasn't on the
[1:57:31] word now I want you to notice how
[1:57:33] brother Bram says they began to attack
[1:57:35] you know that it's not at all strange
[1:57:37] for it is the word and the name that
[1:57:40] brings the enemy pouring after us like a
[1:57:42] flood that Mighty word which was
[1:57:45] manifested in healings so how's the word
[1:57:49] supposed to manifest healing signs
[1:57:50] wonders and other demonstrations
[1:57:53] caused the Pharisees to scream out for
[1:57:55] the
[1:57:57] death of the True
[1:58:00] Believer they hated
[1:58:02] it they hated the power of God being
[1:58:06] manifested they hated it moving in the
[1:58:08] church and as time progressed and that
[1:58:11] carnal seed began to move through the
[1:58:14] false Vine truth was lost and Truth was
[1:58:17] twisted the Judah Spirit brother brand
[1:58:20] would call it had always hated the
[1:58:21] flowing of the the oil he always hated
[1:58:24] the moving of the spirit brother Brown
[1:58:27] says that Spirit couldn't go to
[1:58:28] Pentecost said Judas showed his true
[1:58:29] colors when it was time to go to
[1:58:32] Pentecost he would go along with the
[1:58:34] doctors doctrines but he showed his true
[1:58:36] colors when it came time to go to
[1:58:38] Pentecost you know and I thought about
[1:58:40] and this is just me this is no Doctrine
[1:58:41] at all but I was just thinking about it
[1:58:43] and praying about it and I I began to
[1:58:45] think about the woman who brought the
[1:58:47] the perfumed anointing
[1:58:48] oil and began to pour it out on Jesus
[1:58:52] and how Judas hated
[1:58:54] it he hated the flow of the oil brother
[1:58:58] Joe he hated it as she poured it out and
[1:59:00] he still does he begins to say couldn't
[1:59:03] we do it some other way ain't there
[1:59:05] something else we could do with our
[1:59:08] service he hated her worship that's
[1:59:11] right why does that one always have to
[1:59:16] dance isn't there something we could do
[1:59:19] a there another way that we could show
[1:59:21] that we love him
[1:59:22] it's the same one that always
[1:59:25] shouts Judas has never liked
[1:59:32] worship does it got to be like this
[1:59:34] surely our time and effort could be put
[1:59:36] somewhere
[1:59:37] else he wanted to stop the flow of that
[1:59:41] oil and that was his spirit in the
[1:59:43] church carnal trying to tone down the
[1:59:45] worship there in the first age trying to
[1:59:47] stop the moving of the spirit trying to
[1:59:49] take the life out of the church
[1:59:51] attacking any sign in any life as being
[1:59:54] fanatical and out of
[1:59:56] order he says the spirit of Christ later
[1:59:58] came back upon the true church and the
[2:00:01] spirit of
[2:00:02] Judas came back upon the false
[2:00:07] Church came in and began to make it
[2:00:09] formal came in and robbed truths began
[2:00:13] to use titles and they began to lose the
[2:00:15] revelation of the name of
[2:00:17] Jesus right there they lost most of
[2:00:19] their power
[2:00:23] many other truths were lost and replaced
[2:00:25] by false doctrines and teachings of man
[2:00:27] and holy spirit leadership was replaced
[2:00:29] by a false priesthood and and I know we
[2:00:31] don't have time to go through all the
[2:00:32] ages but we know that the spirit of
[2:00:34] nianis began to take hold and the church
[2:00:38] went into the Dark Ages and with the
[2:00:40] loss of
[2:00:41] Truth came an obvious loss of
[2:00:46] power during this
[2:00:49] period from the point Ephesus began to
[2:00:52] slide all the way till Luther comes out
[2:00:55] in the sardan age this time period is
[2:00:58] the only time since the beginning that
[2:01:01] it isn't more truth being revealed and
[2:01:04] more power being revealed and more
[2:01:07] unveiling but it actually
[2:01:11] regressed not by the hand of
[2:01:14] God and understand
[2:01:18] Church we're not against anyone
[2:01:23] we're for people this ain't a call out
[2:01:25] of anything this is just pointing in the
[2:01:27] scriptures and going this is what the
[2:01:29] prophet
[2:01:31] said I think it's very important that
[2:01:33] we're
[2:01:35] all willing to be corrected when we get
[2:01:37] out of
[2:01:38] Step Lord if I'm out of step and if I'm
[2:01:41] wrong correct me because what we learned
[2:01:44] from the vision was just because
[2:01:45] somebody seeing something different or
[2:01:46] even maybe teaching something different
[2:01:48] or not seeing it right we'll just say it
[2:01:50] like that doesn't mean they're not bride
[2:01:52] brother brandham looked and they got out
[2:01:53] of step and he hollered back get back in
[2:01:56] step and they
[2:01:58] did so this this is in no way a call out
[2:02:01] but what I'm wanting to say is this was
[2:02:03] the first time any in history from the
[2:02:06] beginning that it had
[2:02:07] regressed that power was taken away and
[2:02:11] they went the wrong direction it wasn't
[2:02:12] God doing it was the spirit of Judas
[2:02:14] doing
[2:02:15] it because it was the spirit of Judas
[2:02:18] controlling that carnal false Vine
[2:02:20] brother Brown makes it clear it was the
[2:02:22] Antichrist Spirit taking truth away it
[2:02:24] was taking power away from the people
[2:02:26] and it was making everything too
[2:02:28] mysterious for the common
[2:02:31] believer
[2:02:33] listen brother brother Tim says it great
[2:02:36] that the problem with mystery preachers
[2:02:38] is that when they get done it's still a
[2:02:41] mystery there are no more
[2:02:44] Mysteries the Mysteries are
[2:02:48] revealed we're preaching from an open
[2:02:51] book today
[2:02:52] not well you might can get this and you
[2:02:54] might not it's right there it's open
[2:02:56] it's for you it's attainable for you
[2:02:58] it's for All God's Children amen but but
[2:03:01] but they begin trying to make things too
[2:03:03] Mis mysterious and the common person
[2:03:05] can't have the Bible and it's only for
[2:03:07] the priest to read and but I want to
[2:03:09] tell you that it wouldn't be that way
[2:03:11] forever it wasn't going to stay that way
[2:03:13] forever because I will restore sayeth
[2:03:16] the Lord it had already be written in
[2:03:18] the word that all that was stolen and
[2:03:21] all that was taken away and all the
[2:03:22] truth and all the power and all that was
[2:03:25] going to be restored once again the
[2:03:27] truth that had been taken and the power
[2:03:30] that comes with that truth the power
[2:03:33] that comes with the revelation of the
[2:03:34] name of Jesus the power that comes with
[2:03:36] the
[2:03:40] unveiling it's all going to be
[2:03:42] restored it started out with a
[2:03:44] revelation the just shall live by faith
[2:03:48] what was that it's just a little
[2:03:50] unfolding here we go
[2:03:52] we done folded this thing up long enough
[2:03:55] God says it's time to unfold the just
[2:03:58] shall live by faith and the restoration
[2:04:02] begins and a return to truth begins and
[2:04:04] with that a return to the ad the
[2:04:06] Abundant power of Truth he says now
[2:04:09] notice this then God brings himself on
[2:04:11] the scene as the chief captain in the
[2:04:13] ministry of these seven men to lead his
[2:04:15] people back to the
[2:04:17] truth and the Abundant power of that
[2:04:23] Truth Listen it was the most basic truth
[2:04:26] of the whole gospel the just shall live
[2:04:28] by faith but this unveiling came with
[2:04:31] power it came with power to stand and
[2:04:34] power to stand against the Roman
[2:04:35] Catholic Church power to stand again and
[2:04:39] believe that that I don't have to buy my
[2:04:41] way to heaven that that I can believe in
[2:04:43] faith and and and know that I'm saved it
[2:04:46] came with the power and and with this
[2:04:48] many of the lies of the church are
[2:04:50] exposed by basic
[2:04:52] Revelation listen I want to hammer
[2:04:54] something right here the exposing of the
[2:04:57] devil makes him powerless because truth
[2:05:01] empowers light shows what is right but
[2:05:04] it also exposes what is wrong and the
[2:05:08] exposing of the Enemy being brings power
[2:05:10] over the enemy listen I have dozens of
[2:05:13] these but I'm only going to show you a
[2:05:14] couple how many times maybe hundreds of
[2:05:16] times where brother Randon would say
[2:05:18] this at the end of service or in a
[2:05:19] prayer line Satan you've lost the battle
[2:05:22] why you've been
[2:05:24] exposed you're nothing but a bluff I'm
[2:05:27] so thankful today he's been exposed as a
[2:05:29] bluff he's knocking at your door he's
[2:05:31] claiming all kind of things I'm going to
[2:05:32] take your life I'm going to take your
[2:05:34] children I'm going to destroy your home
[2:05:36] Satan you came to the wrong place
[2:05:38] because I see you don't have any arrows
[2:05:41] so the truth of the revelation of the
[2:05:43] word has exposed you and it has
[2:05:45] empowered me to put my foot on your neck
[2:05:48] he's nothing but a blo in your life
[2:05:50] today he has no weapon he can't stand
[2:05:53] before you just speak the word says
[2:05:57] you're nothing but a bluff and you've
[2:05:58] been exposed on the platform come out of
[2:06:01] this people in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:06:03] come out Satan you've lost the battle
[2:06:06] you've been exposed here tonight before
[2:06:08] these people to show that you cannot
[2:06:09] stand your kingdom is done it's
[2:06:11] crumbling Jesus Christ is coming and his
[2:06:14] presence is here tonight to manifest his
[2:06:19] power brother Joe can testify
[2:06:22] how many
[2:06:23] times you've prayed for people and they
[2:06:25] can't get
[2:06:29] deliverance and at some point during it
[2:06:32] all they look up and they confess
[2:06:37] something and I mean
[2:06:40] instantly it's
[2:06:43] over the devil can't stay where he's
[2:06:46] exposed but see that's why he could stay
[2:06:48] in the church all down Through the Ages
[2:06:50] is he had places to hide
[2:06:52] there was false baptisms there was
[2:06:53] Triune you know baptism there there was
[2:06:55] all kind of things there was eternal
[2:06:57] hell there there was all kind of things
[2:06:58] out of
[2:06:59] order and so he could hide there even as
[2:07:02] certain lights would hit you come up for
[2:07:05] prayer you're asking for something from
[2:07:06] God you got to expose
[2:07:09] everything you got you got to put the
[2:07:11] light brother Brandon would talk about
[2:07:13] when the light comes on roaches scatter
[2:07:16] it exposes them and they no longer have
[2:07:18] power they have to go
[2:07:21] a lie binds but truth will expose the
[2:07:24] enemy and bring you Liberty look here he
[2:07:27] says Satan you who've bound these people
[2:07:29] you're exposed tonight your grips are
[2:07:34] lost church that's where we stand at
[2:07:36] right now in this final age the lies of
[2:07:39] all the ages has been exposed and his
[2:07:42] grip on the Bride of Jesus Christ has
[2:07:44] been broken you are a free people today
[2:07:48] what's holding you what's holding you if
[2:07:50] there's anything holding you it's just a
[2:07:51] bluff if there's anything holding you
[2:07:53] just expose it he's been exposed in this
[2:07:56] day and now we're a free bride we're
[2:07:58] ready for a Rapture filled with the Holy
[2:08:00] Ghost empowered by the revelation of the
[2:08:02] word he's lost his grip on us
[2:08:07] today I'm glad that he's been
[2:08:10] exposed exposed by the word exposed to
[2:08:13] be a bluff exposed to be a liar and his
[2:08:16] exposing has shown the truth about you
[2:08:19] you never was his you never did belong
[2:08:23] to him you always did belong to God your
[2:08:25] name was always written in the book but
[2:08:29] the coming of the word showed you who he
[2:08:31] was and who you are and it gave you the
[2:08:34] power over him it gave you power over
[2:08:37] the lie I'm telling you this morning
[2:08:40] cast the lie down and accept the truth
[2:08:42] Amen brother brandom said eve had to
[2:08:45] cast down the word before she could
[2:08:46] accept the lie I'm telling you to cast
[2:08:48] down that lie of complex cast down the
[2:08:50] lie that nobody loves loves you that
[2:08:51] nobody cares cast down the lie that you
[2:08:53] can't get the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:08:55] cast down the lie that you're a failure
[2:08:57] cast down a lie that your children ain't
[2:08:59] coming back and accept the promise of
[2:09:01] the truth today and hold on to it for
[2:09:04] dear life
[2:09:07] Hallelujah the coming of the word gave
[2:09:09] you power over the lie and when the book
[2:09:12] was open the truth comes out and when
[2:09:15] the truth comes out he never had power
[2:09:17] over you when the truth comes out you're
[2:09:20] not really a failure
[2:09:22] when the truth comes out you're standing
[2:09:23] in Le oysa when the truth comes out
[2:09:26] you're the Bride of Jesus
[2:09:29] Christ makes me think of of
[2:09:33] hmon there in in Esther chapter
[2:09:36] 6 and he's already planning to hang Mori
[2:09:40] he's already built the Gallows thank
[2:09:44] you but one night the king couldn't
[2:09:46] sleep on and he said bring me bring me
[2:09:50] the book of Chronicles yeah and they
[2:09:52] bring in the book now hmon had been
[2:09:55] saying these people are against you
[2:09:58] these people are threatening to
[2:09:59] overthrow your kingdom these people
[2:10:01] can't stand that guy's a failure you
[2:10:03] died for him and all he does is fail all
[2:10:05] he does is let you down all he does is
[2:10:08] miss church all he does is Time After
[2:10:10] Time the king says bring me the book of
[2:10:13] remembrance I need to read and when the
[2:10:15] book's
[2:10:16] open the truth comes
[2:10:19] out when the book's open they were
[2:10:21] standing for me all along they were in
[2:10:24] Satan's Eden standing for me all along
[2:10:27] hymon you're a liar now you're going to
[2:10:29] go to The Gallows it was hmon that's a
[2:10:31] liar it's a hmon with no power but you
[2:10:34] your name is written in the book and it
[2:10:37] shows who you always were you were loyal
[2:10:40] you were true you stood in an evil day
[2:10:43] the book came open and reveal your true
[2:10:48] identity Hallelujah
[2:10:52] thank you
[2:10:57] Jesus and it goes on from Luther's day
[2:11:02] and goes into Philadelphia age and the
[2:11:05] messenger John
[2:11:06] Wesley and more is
[2:11:09] unfolded and more is unveiled with the
[2:11:11] message of
[2:11:13] sanctification more is unfolded more
[2:11:15] power is released during the isua
[2:11:19] movement and then Malachi 4 comes on the
[2:11:23] seene I think you see where we're going
[2:11:25] we built from Genesis to
[2:11:27] Jesus and we're
[2:11:29] building from acts to
[2:11:34] Jesus Malachi 4 comes on the scene
[2:11:37] Revelation
[2:11:38] 10:7 and once again it's completely
[2:11:42] unfolded once again the fullness of the
[2:11:46] word the scripture said the mystery of
[2:11:50] God is
[2:11:52] finished and yet
[2:11:54] somehow
[2:11:56] somewhere people get the idea that with
[2:11:58] the coming of the word we're supposed to
[2:12:01] lay aside the power that came with it
[2:12:03] lay aside the life that came with
[2:12:05] it to try to make that a thing of the
[2:12:08] past and it's the same spirit that
[2:12:11] worked through the church carinal there
[2:12:12] in the first age anointed by the Judah
[2:12:15] Spirit to sell out the
[2:12:17] birthright to lay aside the power
[2:12:21] brother Bram says this man comes to him
[2:12:23] and says you're trying to make people
[2:12:24] believe in an Apostolic age to live
[2:12:26] today like they were in the apostolic
[2:12:29] age so the apostolic age ceased with the
[2:12:33] apostles brother Brown said it
[2:12:37] did listen I think you came too late to
[2:12:39] tell that
[2:12:41] man he said yeah I said who was the
[2:12:44] spokesman in the apostolic age he said
[2:12:46] the 12 apostles in the upper room I said
[2:12:49] then Paul was out
[2:12:53] I said the spokesman was Peter and Peter
[2:12:55] said on the day of Pentecost when they
[2:12:57] seen all this going on in the Holy Ghost
[2:12:59] work and he said the promise is unto you
[2:13:01] and to your children and to them that's
[2:13:03] a far off even as many as the Lord Our
[2:13:05] God shall ever call if he is still
[2:13:08] calling then the same thing is here when
[2:13:10] did the apostolic age cease then the
[2:13:13] apostolic age ceases when God ceases to
[2:13:17] call he never did say a thing but picked
[2:13:20] up his hat and walked
[2:13:23] away wrong fell to argue
[2:13:26] with the apostolic age doesn't cease as
[2:13:30] long as God is calling
[2:13:32] amen and we can't be deniers we We Can't
[2:13:35] Stop short that's the Jud Spirit
[2:13:37] stopping short walk right up to it walk
[2:13:39] up and see the truth and then walk away
[2:13:41] from
[2:13:42] Pentecost we can't settle for just a
[2:13:44] good life and we can't settle for just
[2:13:46] justification and sanctification and and
[2:13:49] we can't settle for just having gifts
[2:13:51] we don't want that we're not going
[2:13:53] backwards there's more for us the
[2:13:57] fullness is for us we have more power
[2:14:00] because truth in powers and the fullness
[2:14:03] of the truth has been restored brother
[2:14:06] Brandon would go through it like this he
[2:14:07] said justification brought power he said
[2:14:10] it was horse power he said the horse and
[2:14:13] buggy he said but they had
[2:14:15] power he said but then sanctification
[2:14:18] come and brought more power he said now
[2:14:20] they never done away with the power they
[2:14:23] added to
[2:14:24] it he said now they had more power it
[2:14:27] was automobile power he says Asuza
[2:14:30] brought airplane power he said they got
[2:14:33] off the ground he said no they didn't do
[2:14:36] away with the horse and buggy they
[2:14:37] didn't do away with the car Power they
[2:14:39] added to it
[2:14:42] listen he says and when the Pentecostals
[2:14:45] found the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[2:14:46] the restoration of the gifts they never
[2:14:48] Divi denied sanctification or justif
[2:14:51] ification they just got more power and
[2:14:53] raised up and went up because he found
[2:14:56] more power
[2:14:59] see but the unveiling didn't stop at
[2:15:02] isua but now friends now
[2:15:06] friends may I say this it has come to
[2:15:09] the age of the astronaut we have moved
[2:15:11] out of the airplane age we've got more
[2:15:13] power now the astronaut age has come in
[2:15:16] what is it we've come into the spiritual
[2:15:19] age of astronauts see going above it's
[2:15:21] the same Spirit only more power only
[2:15:25] lifted higher can go higher see more
[2:15:27] believe more be more like Christ not the
[2:15:30] automobile not the horse and buggy not
[2:15:32] even the airplane but the astronaut he
[2:15:35] sweeps on and above each one I'm not
[2:15:39] going back to the airplane I'm not going
[2:15:41] back to the car I'm not going back to
[2:15:43] the horse and buggy I've stepped into
[2:15:45] the astronaut age I'm going above and
[2:15:48] beyond each one I'm going past the Sun
[2:15:51] pass the moon past the Stars I'm going
[2:15:53] all the way as far as I can go with more
[2:15:58] power
[2:15:59] Hallelujah more power why is there more
[2:16:03] power brother Arion Aron Arion I renamed
[2:16:09] myself why is there more
[2:16:12] power for the very reason people think
[2:16:15] there's less power there's more power
[2:16:17] because the Mysteries have been
[2:16:19] revealed there's more more power because
[2:16:21] the seals have been open and with more
[2:16:24] truth comes more power he doesn't go
[2:16:26] backwards it's always more more of God
[2:16:29] released more of his nature more of his
[2:16:31] victory more of his healing more of his
[2:16:33] Joy I want you to notice the attitude of
[2:16:35] the Prophet speaking in the fifth
[2:16:38] seal it isn't now we have the word so we
[2:16:41] don't have to worry about any more
[2:16:42] healings we don't have to worry about
[2:16:44] Deliverance anymore this is him in the
[2:16:46] fifth seal I
[2:16:48] believe I'm not going to speak it in his
[2:16:50] name I'm going to speak it in the
[2:16:52] revelation of my faith what happened in
[2:16:54] Sabino Canyon the other day when the
[2:16:56] sword come down to him I believe that
[2:16:58] the hour is approaching when missing
[2:17:01] limbs will be
[2:17:05] restored you're telling me that the
[2:17:07] coming of the word raised the prophet's
[2:17:11] expectations for greater
[2:17:14] healings it raised his expectations for
[2:17:17] more power not less
[2:17:22] and the glorious power of the Creator I
[2:17:25] believe if he can make a squirrel appear
[2:17:27] that he here is the man or woman just
[2:17:30] got a part missing that's a complete
[2:17:32] animal he is God I love
[2:17:36] him brother Brown seeing the unveiling
[2:17:40] the the unveiling of power the unveiling
[2:17:42] of the word he expects more and he
[2:17:44] expects greater he has greater
[2:17:46] expectations now than ever for God to
[2:17:49] move in a mighty way for God to manifest
[2:17:51] and and after the revealing of the word
[2:17:54] the expectations for the Supernatural
[2:17:56] and for the healings go
[2:18:01] higher what is it was the unveiling of
[2:18:04] even more
[2:18:06] power the unveiling of Greater to the
[2:18:09] prophet the coming word meant more power
[2:18:11] not more theology yes correct doctrines
[2:18:14] but correct doctrines bring more power
[2:18:16] because the claim of the devil has been
[2:18:18] broken the devil is exposed and is
[2:18:21] exposing as we saw his grip is
[2:18:23] completely broken the light begins to
[2:18:26] shine in the last day it shows who the
[2:18:28] devil really is light shines and the
[2:18:31] Revelation strikes and you see who you
[2:18:33] really are and when you see that and you
[2:18:35] recognize the authority that you have in
[2:18:38] your position that allows you to operate
[2:18:40] the power of God what power are you
[2:18:43] talking about brother Aaron power to be
[2:18:45] an
[2:18:46] overcomer power to overcome the devil
[2:18:48] power to overcome leosia power power to
[2:18:51] overcome lukewarm spirit Power for the
[2:18:53] supernatural power for a
[2:18:57] Rapture and as we bring this down today
[2:18:59] knowing that it's all been revealed so
[2:19:02] the fullness is here I ask you what are
[2:19:05] your
[2:19:08] expectations what are your expectations
[2:19:11] because I'm expecting
[2:19:12] more with the release of the full word
[2:19:15] came the fullness of the Holy
[2:19:18] Ghost now listen other ages had por
[2:19:21] ions and it was enough power for that
[2:19:23] time if you were birthed under a
[2:19:26] previous outpouring it was good for that
[2:19:28] time you only had a portion if you were
[2:19:31] birthed under the isua
[2:19:34] movement you only had a
[2:19:37] portion now let's make it clear you may
[2:19:41] have received the fullness of what was
[2:19:43] allotted but it wasn't all
[2:19:48] allotted you did not receive the same
[2:19:50] New Birth Earth in
[2:19:53] 1950 that's available right now to you
[2:19:56] amen cuz the fullness of the word wasn't
[2:19:59] open so the fullness of the Holy Ghost
[2:20:00] could not be
[2:20:07] here it was good for that age it's good
[2:20:10] for the airplane age and it' get you off
[2:20:12] the
[2:20:13] ground it would get you off the ground
[2:20:15] but it won't work today because today
[2:20:17] the fullness has come
[2:20:20] and so I ask you
[2:20:22] this turn your thinking just a little
[2:20:25] what are you veiling this
[2:20:28] morning who are
[2:20:30] you the fullness has come in flesh again
[2:20:33] yeah
[2:20:36] where
[2:20:40] who
[2:20:43] you you've got to start recognizing this
[2:20:46] and quit facing the devil
[2:20:48] trembling Jesus never want one time
[2:20:51] trembled when he faced the
[2:20:53] devil he never one time was afraid of a
[2:20:56] situation and I'm telling you I
[2:20:58] understand our human aspects I
[2:20:59] understand our human emotions but you're
[2:21:01] veiling God on the inside of you
[2:21:04] tonight what was on the inside of
[2:21:07] Jesus this isn't some anointing we're
[2:21:10] talking about here in the last day this
[2:21:12] isn't some
[2:21:13] partial and as I bring this down to a
[2:21:15] close I'm going to read quite a few
[2:21:17] quotes from from the unveiling of God
[2:21:20] as he deals with this and these go in
[2:21:23] order not ex I mean there's places where
[2:21:25] I skip some paragraphs to get to the
[2:21:26] next quote but they're in order and you
[2:21:28] see him building this
[2:21:30] thought he says they said there is no
[2:21:33] such thing as prophets there is no such
[2:21:36] thing in these last days as Apostles and
[2:21:38] Prophets there's no such thing as Divine
[2:21:39] Healing there's no such thing as Sears
[2:21:42] anymore there's no such thing as Mark 16
[2:21:44] being fulfilled Apostolic age is done
[2:21:47] they veiled it from the people but God
[2:21:50] walked right out with his holy spirit of
[2:21:52] fire and rent that thing from the top to
[2:21:55] bottom God has rent The Veil he said it
[2:22:00] is too it is today too it's called a
[2:22:02] bunch of Holy Rollers fanatics but they
[2:22:04] don't know what's hid behind there W my
[2:22:08] he said that's what they don't know see
[2:22:10] then when God in Mercy rent The Veil for
[2:22:12] them to see they were so wrapped up in
[2:22:13] their Traditions don't let us get so
[2:22:16] wrapped up in message traditions we
[2:22:17] don't see him moving so wrapped up and
[2:22:20] well we been here for 2 hours that we
[2:22:21] don't see him
[2:22:22] [Music]
[2:22:24] moving it was still hid to them even to
[2:22:27] this day same now the glory the power of
[2:22:29] the Holy Spirit The shakana Glory that
[2:22:32] comes upon the believer now I mean the
[2:22:34] real believer that causes the works of
[2:22:36] God and the faith to come into him to
[2:22:39] believe the word of God that's all hid
[2:22:41] to them eyes they say them things just
[2:22:43] passed you see they're still living
[2:22:44] behind the veil you're not behind the
[2:22:46] veil anymore little ones God has come in
[2:22:49] full full view to you
[2:22:54] Hallelujah I'm going to keep going just
[2:22:56] bear with me he says so now we are
[2:22:58] invited into him to be partakers of all
[2:23:01] that he is we're invited into him which
[2:23:03] is hid to unbelievers by the veil
[2:23:07] of human
[2:23:09] flesh see they know that Glory they read
[2:23:13] of it it's in the word the glory of God
[2:23:15] things like that it's just a word to
[2:23:18] them we've got the word we
[2:23:22] no it's just a word to
[2:23:26] them to us it's a
[2:23:31] manifestation see it is no more a word
[2:23:35] it's a reality amen God said let there
[2:23:38] be light that was the word but now there
[2:23:40] is light it ain't the word it's the
[2:23:43] light that was the word but now there is
[2:23:47] light he says see what I mean now it
[2:23:49] isn't just a written word word to us
[2:23:51] it's a reality next sentence
[2:23:54] we
[2:23:56] are
[2:23:58] him well we don't we just don't have the
[2:24:00] power that used to come during the
[2:24:02] healing you're right we're beyond that
[2:24:05] power it's even greater now than it was
[2:24:07] then the word is open we are him
[2:24:11] whatever power he had we have today we
[2:24:15] are him now we're enjoying now we Behold
[2:24:18] Him now we see him the word word
[2:24:21] manifesting himself
[2:24:24] where in
[2:24:27] you it's HD out there because why it's
[2:24:30] veiled in human
[2:24:34] flesh look I'm going to be honest I
[2:24:36] think the biggest problem we have isn't
[2:24:38] even seeing God in our brother it's
[2:24:39] seeing God in
[2:24:41] us I might know two or three of your
[2:24:44] flaws I know all 682 of mine I was being
[2:24:48] generous there's probably more
[2:24:53] so it's hard to accept it about
[2:24:57] yourself but it's
[2:24:59] here what was the point of all this a
[2:25:01] defeated people no God in flesh again
[2:25:06] God again in a people doing the works
[2:25:08] that he did John 14:12 Mark 16 in action
[2:25:12] finishing what wasn't finished in the
[2:25:13] ministry of Christ finishing the
[2:25:15] ministry of his bride how can you do the
[2:25:17] ministry of the bridegroom if you're not
[2:25:20] the
[2:25:28] same like he was in Moses these are all
[2:25:31] come from the same service one after
[2:25:32] another it's an incredible sermon you
[2:25:33] should listen to it when the word was in
[2:25:36] Moses he was God in flesh when it was in
[2:25:39] Jesus it was God in flesh see only thing
[2:25:41] he done was change his mask not his word
[2:25:43] not his nature he is the same yesterday
[2:25:45] today and forever he only changed his
[2:25:47] form he changed from Noah to Moses he
[2:25:49] changed from Moses to David from David
[2:25:51] to Joseph on down till he come into the
[2:25:52] fullness of the godhead bodily that was
[2:25:54] Jesus Christ see it's still the same God
[2:25:57] amen amen I hope that gets through see
[2:25:59] it's the same God but he just takes on
[2:26:01] another Veil see he puts on another Veil
[2:26:04] he did it in the reformers taking on a
[2:26:06] veil taken on a veil until finally it
[2:26:08] come down through the Lutheran age down
[2:26:10] through the other age then finally it
[2:26:12] comes out in the
[2:26:16] complete the fullness oh Jesus was the
[2:26:19] fullness
[2:26:20] his bride is the
[2:26:26] fullness says now Moses was the word
[2:26:29] that day because the word was given to
[2:26:30] him for that day Moses Joseph was the
[2:26:32] word in his days portraying Christ
[2:26:34] exactly see each one of them was the
[2:26:36] word and when Jesus came he was the word
[2:26:38] in its fullness because the whole Plan
[2:26:40] of Redemption laid in him the whole Plan
[2:26:43] of Redemption didn't lay in Moses didn't
[2:26:44] lay in Joseph didn't lay in Elijah see
[2:26:46] they were only part of the word pointing
[2:26:48] to it just like Luther was pointing to
[2:26:51] it Wesley was pointing to it isua was
[2:26:54] pointing to it now notice keep your
[2:26:57] thought here it comes as I say see the
[2:26:59] whole plan wasn't in
[2:27:01] them they were pointing to it can I tell
[2:27:05] you something this morning even like
[2:27:06] Tabernacle we're not pointing to it
[2:27:09] we're no longer pointing there's not an
[2:27:11] age to come the fullness of the word is
[2:27:14] here the fullness of the word has been
[2:27:16] restored Jesus the fullness veiled in
[2:27:18] flesh 2,000 years ago and now bone of is
[2:27:21] bone and now flesh of is flesh and now
[2:27:24] power is power the fullness of the word
[2:27:27] is here this morning it's in a bride of
[2:27:30] Jesus Christ a worldwide body and you
[2:27:33] are a point a part of that fullness

[2:27:39] the believer the word is unveiled the
[2:27:42] power is unveiled I ask you this morning
[2:27:44] what can stand before you what's
[2:27:46] hindering you what sickness What Fear

[2:28:05] identified with him this is this is
[2:28:07] powerful amen I was with Noah when he
[2:28:10] went in the ark I was with Moses when he
[2:28:12] come out of Egypt amen I Was Elijah on
[2:28:15] Mount Caramel yes sir glory to God I was

[2:28:52] things of the world to myself in all
[2:28:54] Traditions I was identified with him I
[2:28:58] was identified with him on Easter
[2:28:59] morning when he rose from the dead I was
[2:29:02] identified with him on the day of
[2:29:04] Pentecost when the Holy Ghost came down
[2:29:06] like a rushing Mighty Wind I was
[2:29:08] identified with him all that he was I am
[2:29:15] all that I am he was brother and ain't
[2:29:20] making this up this morning the prophet
[2:29:22] of God says you are him he's not he's
[2:29:28] that where at devil the fullness of the
[2:29:31] word of God is manifested in flesh again
[2:29:34] today in a bride

[2:29:42] the bride he has revealed himself to her
[2:29:46] and now she is here to finish the work
[2:29:49] so I ask you
[2:29:51] what's on the inside of us this
[2:29:53] morning it's the same one that walked on
[2:29:55] water it's the same one that spoke to
[2:29:57] storms it's the same one that defeated
[2:30:00] death Hell In The Grave it's the same
[2:30:02] one that resurrected it's the same one
[2:30:04] that came back on the day of Pentecost
[2:30:05] it's the same one that opened the seals
[2:30:07] it's the same Jesus Christ today living
[2:30:11] in you and living in me Hallelujah he
[2:30:17] says notice the old Veil that hid the
[2:30:19] glory the old Badger skins there was no
[2:30:22] Beauty to be desired of it neither was
[2:30:24] his flesh that's the reason people said
[2:30:25] a little old stooped over fell like that
[2:30:28] probably 30 years old and gray and his
[2:30:30] beard gray wasn't much to look at the
[2:30:33] Bible said there's no Beauty we should
[2:30:35] desire him he didn't look like a king
[2:30:37] the old Badger skin but oh what was on
[2:30:39] the
[2:30:41] inside he says in a little bunch of Holy
[2:30:43] Rollers sitting together in a hot
[2:30:45] building like this they call them not
[2:30:47] much Beauty to be desired but what's on
[2:30:50] the inside this morning the fullness of
[2:30:53] Jesus Christ has returned
[2:30:55] Hallelujah Oh Glory now if we can all
[2:30:59] just get our mind in one Spirit one
[2:31:01] Accord let the directors get in the
[2:31:03] right spirit with the musicians and with
[2:31:06] the composer everything will be all
[2:31:08] right then he says no guesswork about it
[2:31:10] we are identified with him then Hebrews
[2:31:12] 13:8 said he's the same yesterday today
[2:31:14] and forever we're identified with him in
[2:31:16] Acts to we're identified with them with
[2:31:19] the same baptism ISM same thing all he
[2:31:22] was then and all he is all he was and
[2:31:26] all he
[2:31:27] is we
[2:31:29] are that's exactly it how's he able to
[2:31:34] preach like this it's after the
[2:31:36] seals and he's
[2:31:38] recognizing it's the
[2:31:41] fullness it's the
[2:31:43] fullness
