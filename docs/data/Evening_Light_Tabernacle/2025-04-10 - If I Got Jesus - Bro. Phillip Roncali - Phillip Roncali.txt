========================================

And I've had a dog to my name and I had friends walked away. And I've even lost myself a time or two. There were bridges crossed and burned. But through all the wreckage, I have learned that there's one thing that I could never lose. If I got Jesus, I've got all that I could ever need. Take the world away from me. And I'll be okay if I got Jesus. There's a hope that's living deep inside. A joy that I could never hide. And a safe place to fall. If I've got Jesus, I've got it all. And I've seen weakness turn strength. And I've seen failures met with grace. And it's not from what I've done, but it's Christ to me. And a miracle I can't explain. Oh, he's given me his name. I'm the richest man that I could ever be. If I got Jesus, I've got all that I could ever need. Take the world away from me and I'll be okay. If I got Jesus, there's a hope that's living deep inside. A joy that I could never find and a safe place to fall. If I've got Jesus, I've got it all. Oh, and someday that trumpet's going to sound. And the king of heaven will ride upon the cloud coming down. I'll hit my knees, oh Lord, who sings my soul. I'm going home. If I got Jesus, well, I've got all that I could ever need. and take the world away from me and I'll be okay if I got Jesus. And there's a hope that's living deep inside. A joy that I can live by and a safe place to fall. If I got Jesus, well, I've got it all. If I've got Jesus, I've got it all. [Music] [Applause] [Music]
