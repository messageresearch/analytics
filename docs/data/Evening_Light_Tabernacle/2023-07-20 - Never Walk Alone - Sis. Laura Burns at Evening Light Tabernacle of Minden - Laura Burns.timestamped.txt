[0:14] if I knew then what I know now I
[0:19] wouldn't have doubted you
[0:22] I wish I could tell my younger self just
[0:27] to have faith
[0:30] there's so many mountains you moved
[0:35] valleys you have led me through
[0:39] and it's only by your grace
[0:43] stand in here today
[0:48] [Music]
[0:51] in every storm and every step looking
[0:55] back and never once did you let me go
[1:02] no matter what the future holds you
[1:07] working for my good I know you are
[1:11] faithful and I never walk alone
[1:17] my life is full of
[1:20] Miracles the stories that I could tell
[1:25] that you've healed and all that you've
[1:28] done I can't forget
[1:32] so even if my life doesn't go the way I
[1:38] plan or how I hope
[1:41] our history has shown
[1:45] you've never failed me yet
[1:50] to your faithfulness and every storm in
[1:55] every step looking back never once did
[2:00] you let me go
[2:03] and no matter what the future holds you
[2:09] work for my good I know you are faithful
[2:14] and I never
[2:16] alone

[2:24] me
[2:26] [Music]

[2:33] [Music]
[2:36] oh there's nothing you no one can
[2:39] separate me
[2:41] [Applause]
[2:44] cause every moment
[2:48] of me and no matter what the future
