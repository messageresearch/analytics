morning so we kept it a secret amen god bless you sister connie wherever you're at revelations chapter 3 and verse 21 and i want to read about you i i want to read about you you fulfill the scripture to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne amen god bless you you can be seated two years ago in november we had invited brother kelly hildebrandt to come and speak for us over over the weekend and he had left saskatoon and begin to make his way and his first plane would get get delayed then he would go to calgary that motor would catch on fire and he would have to to spend the night in calgary then they would fly him to toronto and in toronto he would have to spend the night again because somehow they'd lost his ticket he didn't have seats to fly so he was going to speak on saturday night and sunday morning and so earlier in the week the lord had spoke to me to to deliver a sermon on don't worry and brother kelly wasn't able to arrive and so i spoke the sermon on don't worry the next morning he wasn't able to be there so we went to washington and picked him up at a complete different airport i told the audience i said what is going on is satan is trying to block the message because it's a message from god and and satan is doing his very best to block it he'll do the same thing this morning if you can to try to block the visitation of god in your personal life and he did that with abraham and sarah when brother kelly entered into pulpit that afternoon he he he presented me with a coin and it's this coin it's a coin that is a commemoration of d-day and on the back the inscription says that we will accept nothing less than full victory on the front there's a grain of sand that is in in the embedded in it to where that it came from normandy there's a great war that happened tremendous amount of people lost their lives i didn't realize that we were preparing to step into a great war ourselves within the coming months we would be told that we had cancer in our lungs and in our in our lymph nodes spotted on our kidneys that are on our liver then then then about a month later after that we'd be told that we had we had uh brain cancer and would have uh had three uh tumors at that time and one would be removed at that time they gave me four months to live if i left it alone it would be i would live about two months if i left that one tumor alone we had about two weeks to live doctors give their reports they give their reports but we have an option and i stand here to encourage every one of you every one of us are in a different battle your battle may not be cancer it may not be terminal over the last couple of months doctors have asked me how much longer do you want to fight i want to fight to the end that's what i want to do i want to fight to the end i want to admonish you today i want this courage to be in your heart you may not be fighting cancer you might not be fighting a lot of different things that other people are fighting but there's no quit in none of us quitting is not an option we're not people that turn around and run we stand in the face of danger by the by the grace and the help of almighty god sure there's going to be incredibly difficult days but god is with us and who better to have with us than to have god with us the scripture says and what shall we then say to these things if god be for us who can be against us if we've got god on our side we cannot lose i want you to just turn to your neighbor and say we can't lose if god's on my side psalms 46 says this god is our refuge and strength of present help in the in trouble therefore will not we fear though the earth be moved though mountains be carried into the midst of the sea the waters thereof roar and be troubled and mountain shape of the swelling thereof there is a river and streams whereof shall be made the glad the city of god the holy place of the tabernacle of the most high god is in the midst of her she shall not be moved god shall help her and that right early the heathen raged and the kings were moved he uttered his voice and the earth melted the lord of hosts is with us the god of jacob is our refuge come behold the works of the lord what desolation he made in the earth he maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth he breaketh the bow and cut up the spear and sunder he burneth the coal the chariot in the fire be still and know that i am god i will be exalted among the heathen i will be exalted in the earth the lord of hosts is with us the god of jacob is our refuge brother ron you don't know what i'm going through well maybe this will be an encouragement to us on our roughest days our lowest hours of despair even in those times we're still chosen blessed favored forgiven loved led by god victorious inheritance of the heaven's glory privilege to walk with our creator we're married to the king of kings he called us his beloved [Applause] we're strong in fight in faith armed to fight devils entrusted with god's word the most powerful weapon protected by the arm of the almighty he placed a hedge around us we have an assurance that each time we call he hears and he answers and he our answer from god is always good rest hope peace and joy is ours then why would we let the devil rob it from us even in the dark it is light around us even in the valley we are so blessed there's a leader called zelinski he's been called a modern-day hero modern day churchill he has extreme resolve extreme courage the odds are against him time and an enemy will destroy him but he stands there calling for help begging and pleading is there any nation is there any army that will come to stand in our defense is there anybody who cares on the other hand we're children of god we're amateur gods standing on the earth we are not alone and when we cry there's tens of thousands of angels begin to come to where we're at and you may never see them your spirits around your eyes may never come open to it but you are not alone in your battle god is on your side he will sin like hornets before you driving back your enemy there will be things that you will not have to go through because he has already taken bombardments and blowed them out of the way because you're his children we have the power of life and death in our tongues we can speak negativity or we can speak positive we can create a world around us i don't care if you live where 10 000 believers are or you're by yourself it matters not you don't need a thousand people to crack you up god's with you we're not a bunch of cowards we've been called to this battle we've been procrastinated to this battle god has built us to overcome when he told joshua be strong and courageous that was god's words to a believer and god's words do not have an expiration date on it milk has an expiration date god's words does not have an expiration date he is telling you i want you to be strong you may be the only one in your school you may be the only one in your job but god's got you there as a testimony that this message works [Music] then what are we afraid about possess the gates we have got god's promise we have his word we have his holy spirit angels are encamped about everything's in order every wall can be took down it's already took damage the son of god goes before us his banners is a waving and there's nothing can stand the stand in the way of a saint going to meet the promise of god death can't stop it the grave can't stop the devil can't stop it we're more than conquerors sickness is perfect for you death is conquered for you unbeliever you won't you receive him habits can be conquered for you temptations can be conquered for you you say i got temper i can't get over it's already conquered then tell me how can you lose george washington was at the persistent at valley forge all the odds was against him and the enemy was across the river but after all night in prayer the american soldiers with no shoes on their feet about one-third of them had shoes and they crossed that river at valley forge through the ice three musket bullets went through his coat but he had an answer from god and there was no need of him backing down nothing could stop him can you say that with us nothing nothing nothing your biggest trial this week last month looking like dread in front of you why don't you just say it aloud nothing nothing's going to stop me the biggest bully in town could not stop peter cartwright a red sea could not stop moses your storms may be huge but they're not too big for our god [Applause] the scripture says written from a dungeon who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril of sword as it is written for thy sake we're killed all the day long and we're accounted as a sheep for a slaughter nay and all these things i love this we're more than conquerors through him that loved us for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor death or any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord listen if i can stand here with death cells trying to destroy my body and preach to you victory in the face of girls how much more can you and look at your devil and tell him you're defeated in the name of jesus christ it is over i will not be your slave no longer let me give you this quotation be still and know that i'm god i'm bigger than your problem i'm bigger than your circumstance i'm bigger than your situation this is not your battle you don't have to handle this this is god's battle [Applause] god will work it out all you have to do is be still and know that i am god i want to say this to you never never never never never never give up in our god dna there's no quitting there's no going back we have come to win this battle we have not walked up on the shores of normandy to lose we've left families we've left a lot of security and we've come to win jesus did not leave the paradises of heaven where angels and seraphims worshiped him but he put on the cloak of humanity he did not come here to lose [Applause] he did not come to take satan's offer to pull you to a different kingdom or to get you there or get you over there we did not come to lose this battle [Music] [Applause] jesus looked right in the gale forces of hell hallelujah and defeated it for me and you yes i declare to you that we have a champion our champion is not in hollywood it is not in washington d.c our champion lives on the inside of us satan has fought this champion before in long he knows what you're capable of doing did you get that he knows he's he's fought that look he's fought that atmosphere before he's wondered how it got inside of you and he knows what you're capable of if he can only keep you from speaking if he can only keep you from worshiping if he can only keep you from taking your position but you're absolutely undefeatable when you recognize who you are and what you've been sent here for we have a mission on the earth more than to sit on a couch and play a game it's more than just to waste our life away and watch the minutes time kick until we become grey-headed but we got a mission we got a mission on the earth they have told me to get myself a bucket list things that i would want to do before i finish okay well here's one of those things they might have been talking about national parks or riding a bull learning to swim so if if i've got to get a bucket list here's a good here's a good start an understanding in the bucket list you're to enjoy every second of the moment of when you're doing the project so if it's my bucket list let's just make you a part of the bucket list let's make this the greatest epic meeting that there's ever been while rush is doing her thing and rome's doing their thing and washington's doing their thing the blood of jesus [Music] she christ in victory [Music] we refuse to be defeated we have met him toe-to-toe we're not shadow boxing no more we're not dancing around just to see if we can dance around we know that we've got more power than the devil [Applause] if he could have heather already took you out in the world he's ain't never gone in hell against you he sent every spirit that he can come to try to get a hold of your life and turn you a different way but something's on the inside of you that's holding it's on lawn when you can't hold on to yourself and there's no turning back it's not that you've got a hold of him he's got a hope of you and that's the whole difference your energy will fail you'll get distracted but god never gets distracted you are his crowning achievement you're what the whole plan is no doubt it's been quoted to you before people of texas february the 24th of 1836 the chief officer sent out a letter all americans in the world fellow citizens compatriots i am besieged by a thousand or more of the mexican under santa ana and i have sustained quite a statement in it not lost an inch a continual bombardment and cannon fire for 24 hours and i have not lost a man the enemy has demanded a surrender at discretion otherwise the garrison are to be put to the sword in the fort if the fort is taken you know the devil sent you a lot of bombardments you need to answer him you need to answer him just because he's doing all that firing and blowing up you need to respond and i've answered the demand with a cannon shot and our flag still weighs proudly from all the walls i shall never surrender or sound retreats [Applause] at the bottom of the letter it said p.s the lord is on our side if i could send the letter to hell from easter cat 2022 we shall never surrender [Applause] we shall never sound retreat we'll not lose a wine we're gonna stand our ground because the lord is on our side let us make a declaration this morning standing in the midst of the darkness of laodicea when brother branham couldn't see past 1977 most of you were born after 1977 in total darkness but god knew you were coming so he equipped you with the best that he could equip you with more than a tape recorder more than a bible more than god sent a prophet but he gave you a word that you can grab a hold of and eat the book and then you become a part of that open book and you see yourself in it and it's more than paul and james and john and nehemiah nehem but it's you it's more than your favorite preacher more than deacons and song leaders it's you standing in the midst of the darkness and the devil limps his way back to hell whipped again day after day after dariatic day yesterday we're literally beacons of light in the darkest of nights may we say like john paul jones we have not begun to fight yet brother brandon would give you the quotation it's not the size of the dog in the fight it's the size of the fight that's in the dog i've always liked that quote i serve a big god i serve an unlimited god i serve a god that's never been defeated i serve a god that has never been in a crisis i don't know what kind of god you serve but i serve a god that has the whole world in his hand and i happen to be on that world every situation of our life god's got it in his hand the scripture says before i formed thee in the belly and the belly i knew thee and before thou camest out of the womb and i sanctified thee and i ordained thee a prophet unto the nations god knew and you are beautiful in god's eyes sisters don't you left never let the devil tell you that you're plain don't ever let the devil compare you to hollywood to try to make you sell out because you are the queen of heaven and when when there are no more marilyn monroes and whoever hallelujah jesus said when brother brown said he said he might have been a man crying but when he called that that man from the out of the grave that had been there four days his soul journey somewhere i don't know where it is at neither do you so anyway he he called him back corruption knew its master the soul knew its creator and a man that's been dead and stood on his feet and lived again after being dead four days that was more than a man that was god i'm taking a minute to remind you if god is on your side let's just see how big he is we remember he believed his own word and created a son he believed his own word and created solar systems and he believed his own word and watched you come into existence pre-planning you before the foundation of the world and watching over your lineage all the way down that's the kind of planned parenthood i agree with it was a man when he was on the mountaintop that night hungry and looked all around in a fig tree and to find something to eat he was a man when he was hungry but when he taken five biscuits and two fish and fed five thousand he was more than a man he is the same yesterday today and forever that's more than just poetic words he's never lost any of his power the worst sinner in this building today getting saved does not diminish his power one bit the worst cancer patient sister erica the worst cancer patient that there is that's not diminish his power one a little iota why you could pour 20 foot of concrete on sister karen's grave on resurrection morning she's coming down that ground [Applause] you see we are committed and committed is more than just being talented committed as being more than just showing up and being entitled you got to give your whole heart to it committed is every day knowing there's no going back being totally committed you see it's not just for yourself but it's for those around you norman schwarzkopf a general in the gulf war he talked about an effective army he said it's not technology it's not the number of soldiers there's two things to evaluate when evaluating an army dedication to the cause and the will to fight brother ron i've been in some difficult things let me remind you there's no miracles without a mess when brother branham was standing with the angel of the lord in the cave he talked about the disease that i'm fighting and sister erica's fighting and many more are fighting and it was nothing to our god totally nothing to our god you're listening you're laying in a hospital bed and the doctors have give you up our god is greater than every problem that you've got if a little girl could lay over nine years and wouldn't have the strength to be able to raise her head up and she began to read about a god that all things were possible she began to believe all of the people around there didn't have that revelation but she reached out beyond the darkness of her circumstances if we could reach beyond the darkness of our circumstances [Applause] brother ron but i've been hurt i've been destroyed my life's been destroyed reach beyond your circumstances we can talk of a memphis girl a blind man in bombay a mexican girl that her babies dead and everybody's saying bury it but she was believing in a god who can that's what i'm standing here for today [Applause] brother donnie i just happen to believe that i can go home and on wednesday when i have all the scans i just happen to believe that the god that i serve can cause that doctor to say you don't have no more cancer ron [Music] so with that i i stand here and say this to you i press towards the mark of the high calling for the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus i can stand here and quote to you yea though i walk to the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me a lot of people that can quote a lot of things but they've never been in a battle but a man that's got blood on his sword he knows a living god many of you've been in some battles and you've had some real heartaches but i want to say this to you he's on your side many of you had miracles before and the devil keeps coming back over and over and over and over again just because you come and get victory in a camp like this and you go away back to your normal life and the devil meets you on tuesday or wednesday and he begins to bombard you it don't mean you have to take it [Applause] we are warriors [Applause] and warriors know how to fight god put fight on the inside of us brother ryan but i've got i've got incredible critics that say all matter of things against me i want to remind you of one principle the critic is the one that testifies that you are the masterpiece the critic testifies that you're the masterpiece we face battles on a lot of fronts maybe you're a spectator a spectator don't have to go to a practice spectator never has to come under criticism they can go to their favorite ball team sit there their arms crossed if i were the coach if i was the pastor if i was a songwriter this is what i do if i ran this church you see but they don't have to pay no cost they're just a spectator and the spectator's not getting blood on his hands no sweat pouring from his brow everybody wants to carry the olympic medal but nobody wants to get up at two and three o'clock in the morning to train everybody wants to go to heaven but they don't want to get their hands dirty fighting devils but for the believer [Music] i'm ready when i come to church i enter into his face with thanksgiving into his clothes with praise i'm ready to have church that's what i've been built for brother ron sometimes i just feel like quitting what don't we all it's an urge every champion has felt it every prophet has felt it even jesus prays it in the garden if it will be possible let this cup pass from me brother branham wanted to go to the mountains if i you know i'll come back when you give me a word of the lord i'll come back down you'd like to get away from the pressure presidents feel it kings feel it we heard last night about lions lions have felt it every winner has felt the urge to quit to walk away i've had enough every soldier has felt it every victorious person has felt it the urge to quit let me just remind you you could you would if you could but it's like a fire that shut up on the inside of your bones it's about church time all of a sudden you get dressed and that depression that's been on you all week told you to quit all the time you get dressed in spite of it you get in the car in spite of it [Applause] and you make your way to church in spite of it i thought i had them walking away but something on the inside of them has took them back to church and when the song is saying when they're redeemed are gathering in you begin to feel something charging from the inside of your body when the song says you don't know like i know what he's done for me and you begin to think about the victories that you've had in your life you forget everything that the devil has said because you don't know like i know i've been there in the valley i've been there in the darkness and something held onto me when i couldn't hold on glory [Applause] i've been sick before but i made it i've been broke before but i mean [Applause] i've been broken hearted before but i made it i cried all night long but i made it [Applause] i've been lied on but i made it i've been destitute but i made it [Applause] i've been rejected but i made it satan said i wouldn't be standing here but i made it [Applause] [Music] how many's ever seen the declaration of independence declaration independence at the bottom of it's got a bunch of names on it it declares that we as america are a free country and it declares freedom from a kingdom that was ruling over us we decided we wasn't going to pay them taxes no more if

he has pulled out every stop he has went to the nuclear options he couldn't stop joseph in a prison he couldn't stop david with a sling he couldn't stop rahab he couldn't stop tamar he couldn't stop mary when every critic in hell was against her she believed an angel couldn't stop shamgar couldn't stop samson couldn't stop elisha he couldn't stop enoch on a lock he couldn't stop moses at the red sea he couldn't stop the three hebrew children i'm just warming up he couldn't stop daniel any lines there he couldn't stop blind bartimaeus he couldn't stop the letter from being healed he couldn't stop lazarus from coming forth he couldn't stop he couldn't stop the woman at the well he couldn't stop paul when he was in prison and he can't stop you satan has tried every scheme to discredit this he's tried everything that he could to make him discredit this to get him to a place of kingdom without suffering tried to get him to take a take it without redemption don't you realize dear precious friends at this minute that satan makes you a promise he'll make you one of the best ministers in the association he'll give you a front series front row seat it's the coke seat in every church to make you a deacon he'll do anything if you'll just get away from this word we have news for him today we have not come to this battle to accept nothing less [Music] than full victory [Applause] the power of life and death is in your tongue and you have showed up and you know who you are let's go ahead and pull our swords this morning [Applause] we didn't just come here for a show we come here for a fight and you're fighting for your spiritual life and if that line is after you to eat you and he thinks your lunch let's get close enough that we can spit in his eye and then cut his head off we packed our bags we borrowed money we did whatever we had to do to come to this meeting we got in sometimes way too stuffed vehicles to sleep in a presidential suite to eat at the king's table but you came here with a purpose you have been praying about things for weeks and months if i can get to that place where jacob was at when he wrestle with an angel of the lord [Music] if i can get to that spot i don't like what i am i don't like what i have become i need a clutch from the king i need a touch from that supernatural power and i'm willing to wrassle it out why don't you just tell god right now i'll not turn you loose until i get what i need i don't want to go back home with a half a victory i want complete victory this is more than attitude this is more than a work up i want god in my life when i watch my life i see god on operation not myself in operation i'm talking about you what about the little habit that you've been wrestling with won't you leave that here why don't you leave that here maybe you've been sitting in prisons with change on your life and you'll go so far and you'll rise so high and then all of a sudden you're back down again and you're back down again and you're back down again and you're back down and you are just creating cycles of doing it again and again somewhere that cycle's got a break somewhere another you've got to get past the sound barrier i'm not talking about your neighbor i'm talking about you what did you come here for you didn't definitely didn't come here to hear me or andrew or brother donny maybe brother donny but you came here to meet jesus and there's one thing for sure he's waiting at your well mariah he's healed you he's done incredible things for you but he ain't finished yet he's the kind of god that knows about mind battles and situations of life and keep reminding you over and over again that there will become a day to where your hair will fall back out and there's other things that's going to debilitate your life but you just remind him who you are and ain't nobody can remind him like you can remind him [Music] ain't nobody can remind him like you can remind him you came a long way god

i've ever met in my life rough you you could look up gruff in the in the dictionary and his picture was right beside others nobody could get along with him he was just isolated drunk somebody invited him at church maybe it was his sister invited him to church and he started coming one night i was preaching over god watches over your predestinated seed and you might have been running the the waters of normandy and there wasn't a bullet no matter how great the army was there wasn't a bullet that could hit you because he predestinated you max was on one of those vessels he said i was standing there when they let the the gate down and just hundreds of us hit the water and he said the water turned to red and we ran my buddies were dying all around me and he said all i knew to do was run and he said when i got to the sand there was blood all over the sand and men laying everywhere and all i knew to do was just run and he said when i got to the wall i stood against that wall and he said how did i get here amen how did i get here [Music] he pulled me up close he said brother ron you answered the question tonight in this service that i've been wondering all my life how did i make it to

your hand and he told you ron i got this ron you're going to be well and you just take him at his word when you can't even trust yourself you trust him would there be hands across this building you
