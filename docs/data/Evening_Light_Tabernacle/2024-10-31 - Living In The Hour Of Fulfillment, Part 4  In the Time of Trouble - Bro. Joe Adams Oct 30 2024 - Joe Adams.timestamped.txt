[20:19] asking for the spirit of God to move in
[20:21] Jesus
[20:22] name amen if you have your Bibles
[20:25] tonight we're going to quickly get into
[20:26] this we're not sure how much time we
[20:28] have with the battery back up
[20:30] so if the lights go
[20:32] out well we'll just preach my iPad is
[20:35] lit up you just pull so we're
[20:38] here let's just get into it so we're
[20:40] going to look here in Matthew 24 we're
[20:42] going to pick back up on the line of
[20:44] thinking that I've been on on living in
[20:45] the hour of fulfillment a subtitle
[20:47] tonight is going to be in the time of
[20:50] trouble now I believe we sit under a
[20:52] great ministry brother Tim and he has
[20:54] done an outstanding job bringing these
[20:55] things to our attention and we are
[20:57] people that are
[20:59] uh this will not be new tonight but it
[21:00] should be a refresher to many of us so I
[21:03] just ask that you just get behind it
[21:05] tonight and we'll look at it and see
[21:06] what the Lord has in store for us but we
[21:08] find here Matthew 24 and
[21:10] verse1 says Jesus went out and he
[21:12] departed from the temple and the
[21:14] disciples came to him for to show him
[21:16] the building of the temple and Jesus
[21:19] said unto them see ye not all these
[21:21] things verily I say unto you there shall
[21:23] not be left here one stone upon another
[21:27] that shall not be thr down and he sat
[21:30] down upon the Mount of Olives and the
[21:31] disciples came unto him privately saying
[21:33] tell us when these things be and what
[21:36] shall be the sign of thy coming and the
[21:38] end of the world now I want you to clue
[21:41] in right here for the next portion of
[21:43] this scripture reading verse 4 through
[21:44] verse1 15 and Jesus answered and said
[21:47] unto them take heed that no man deceive
[21:49] you that's the first thing then he comes
[21:51] he says for many shall come in my name
[21:53] saying I am Christ and shall deceive
[21:55] many and shall hear you shall hear Wars
[21:58] and rumors of War see that you are not
[22:00] troubled for all these things must come
[22:03] to pass but the end is not yet for
[22:05] Nations shall rise against Nation the
[22:07] kingdom of against Kingdom there shall
[22:09] be famines there shall be pestilence and
[22:11] earthquakes in diverse places all these
[22:14] are the beginning of Sorrows not the end
[22:17] but the beginning then shall they
[22:19] deliver you up to be afflicted and shall
[22:21] kill you and you shall be hated of all
[22:23] Nations for my name's sake then shall
[22:25] many be offended and shall betray one
[22:27] another and shall hate one another and
[22:29] many false prophets shall rise and shall
[22:31] deceive many and because iniquity shall
[22:33] abound the love of many shall wax cold
[22:36] but he that shall endure to the end the
[22:38] same shall be saved and this Gospel of
[22:41] the Kingdom shall be preached to all the
[22:42] world for a witness unto all nations and
[22:45] then shall the end be when you therefore
[22:48] shall see the abomination of desolation
[22:50] spoken by Daniel the Prophet stand in
[22:53] the Holy place he said whosoever readeth
[22:55] let him understand God bless you you can
[22:58] have your seats
[23:01] tonight thank the thank the Lord for the
[23:03] opportunity to be here and we're just
[23:05] going to try to move as quickly because
[23:07] we're not sure how much time we got but
[23:09] if you go back in Daniel
[23:10] 8 and we're not going to go there for
[23:13] the sake of time but just to kind of
[23:14] paraphrase here in Daniel 8:15 Daniel
[23:17] had a vision and he begin to uh Gabriel
[23:20] the angel of God begins to come to
[23:22] Daniel share what this Vision meant and
[23:24] so the vision that Daniel had in Daniel
[23:26] 8 was actually the was the end time
[23:29] destruction it's the tribulation period
[23:31] it's the Abomination that maketh
[23:32] desolation and we go into Daniel 9 it
[23:35] says the first year of his Reign I
[23:37] Daniel understood by the books a number
[23:39] of years where of the word of the Lord
[23:41] came to Jeremiah the prophet that we
[23:43] would accomplish 70 years in the
[23:45] desolation of Jerusalem So Daniel Knew
[23:47] by looking back at Jeremiah the prophet
[23:50] when this time should happen and
[23:51] therefore his vision lined up with
[23:54] Jeremiah's prophecy and so because of
[23:57] that Not only was was it just the 70
[23:59] years that the Jews were going to be in
[24:01] Exile but it also carries on because
[24:03] Daniel was told in the book of uh Book
[24:06] of Daniel chapter 8 he's told seal these
[24:09] things up Daniel for there is certain
[24:10] time appointed they're not for now but
[24:13] they will be for a certain time so I
[24:15] believe what Daniel saw Daniel saw our
[24:18] day Daniel saw a people living out the
[24:20] manifestation of the end time and notice
[24:23] in that end time it's not a flowery bed
[24:25] of ease it's not an easy time it's a
[24:27] struggle of time it's a time of trouble
[24:30] but I want you to know in the time of
[24:32] trouble there's safety for the elect
[24:34] notice when when when egyp was receiving
[24:37] their plagues the uh the Jews of the
[24:39] elect was in Goan so it was Darkness to
[24:42] one but it was light to the other let me
[24:44] tell you the world's groping in darkness
[24:46] but you and I sitting here tonight oh
[24:48] the lights may be off in the building
[24:50] but the light of the Revelation is in
[24:51] our hearts tonight and we see because
[24:53] why God sent us the manifestation of the
[24:56] revelation of his word for the end time
[24:58] yes
[24:59] sir so we find I was going to speak
[25:02] tonight on the consummation but the Lord
[25:03] kind of changed my thought process this
[25:05] morning and we're going to look at it
[25:07] from the aspect of in the time of
[25:10] trouble so I looked at this and I was
[25:13] thinking you know what I don't want to
[25:14] bring them through the consummation and
[25:16] go about all the the details of the end
[25:18] time without first letting you know that
[25:20] there's a way of Escape so I think what
[25:23] we're going to do tonight we're going to
[25:24] look at the end time we're going to look
[25:26] at the Rapture message tonight we're
[25:27] going to look at what's promised for the
[25:29] bride cuz let me tell you destruction is
[25:31] not promised for the bride Annihilation
[25:34] is not promised for the bride let me
[25:36] tell you the tribulation is not promised
[25:38] for the bride but what is Promised for
[25:40] the bride in the time of trouble I will
[25:43] hide you in my Pavilion in the secret of
[25:46] my Tabernacle let me tell you in the
[25:49] time of trouble there's safety for the
[25:50] bride there's peace for the bride
[25:52] there's rest for the bride in the time
[25:55] of trouble hallelujah oh church let me
[25:57] tell you no if you got to look around
[25:59] and wonder oh are we in that time yes we
[26:02] are in that
[26:03] time and it's only going to get worse
[26:06] it's only going to get more uh more more
[26:09] wicked and more evil as the day goes by
[26:12] it's only going to get better you may
[26:14] make your vote on November 4th November
[26:16] 5th it ain't going to change the course
[26:18] of scripture it's not going to change
[26:20] the the plan of Prophecy it's going to
[26:23] manifest just exactly the way the word
[26:25] declares
[26:28] now we find and I talked about this the
[26:31] last time that we spoke we talked about
[26:34] Daniel here is not referring to the
[26:36] Gentiles he's referring to the Jews and
[26:39] you know brother BR would teach us to
[26:41] look at the Jews for they are the time
[26:43] piece they are our time piece notice
[26:47] Daniel's 70 weeks may not pertain to the
[26:49] bride matter of fact the prophet said it
[26:51] doesn't pertain to the Gentiles it
[26:54] doesn't pertain to us so brother Joe why
[26:57] do we look at it because they're your
[26:59] time piece it's just like looking at the
[27:02] clock on the back wall we can tell what
[27:04] time it is right now and how much longer
[27:06] we have before the service is out and we
[27:09] can look at the Jews they are time piece
[27:12] and we can find just how much longer we
[27:14] have before the end time destruction
[27:17] before the 70 weeks as Daniel is
[27:19] fulfilled and the Gentile dispensation
[27:22] is all summed up that's right so we want
[27:24] to look at that tonight and we find here
[27:27] in Revelation 6 and verse
[27:29] 12 says I beheld when he had opened the
[27:33] six seal and lo there was a great
[27:34] earthquake and the sun became black as
[27:37] sackcloth of hair and the moon became as
[27:41] blood and the stars of Heaven fell upon
[27:44] the Earth even a fig tree casteth her
[27:46] untimely figs when she is shaken of A
[27:49] Mighty Wind and the heaven departed as a
[27:51] scroll when it rolled together every
[27:54] mountain and Island were moved out of
[27:56] their places and the king of the the
[27:58] Great Men the rich men the chief
[28:00] captains and the Mighty Men And every
[28:02] bondman and every free man they hid
[28:05] themselves in the dens and in the rocks
[28:07] of the mountains and they said to the
[28:09] mountains and the Rocks fall on us and
[28:11] hide us from the face of him that sth on
[28:14] the throne and from the Wrath of the
[28:16] Lord for the great day of Wrath has come
[28:19] and who shall be able to stand now
[28:21] brother Brandon will tell us just
[28:23] exactly he says in the six seal
[28:25] comparing what Jesus said in Matthew 2 4
[28:28] speaking about the Abomination that make
[28:30] a desolation he says now Jesus said in
[28:33] Matthew 24 and what the Revelator here
[28:36] opened up in this six H is just exactly
[28:39] Jesus was speaking of the tribulation
[28:42] period he was speaking there's a Time
[28:45] coming and the prophet of God will teach
[28:47] us oh whatever you do make sure that you
[28:50] escape that time if you got to cut my
[28:52] stomach open pulic acid whatever you do
[28:56] make sure that you're not here for that
[28:58] time that's right that's right he says
[29:01] when you see the Abomination that maketh
[29:04] desolation spoken by the Prophet Daniel
[29:07] standing in the Holy place he said what
[29:09] is that he said that's the mosque of
[29:11] Omar stood in the place of the temple
[29:13] where they burned it down let them
[29:15] that's in the mountains let them that's
[29:17] on top of the housetops don't come down
[29:19] to take these things out of the house
[29:21] him that is in the field will return
[29:22] back for there will be a time of trouble
[29:26] yeah let me tell you if you're on
[29:28] offense tonight whether you want to
[29:29] serve God or I want to tell you there
[29:31] will be a time of trouble yeah we are
[29:34] living in that hour where there is
[29:36] nothing left but trouble for all those
[29:38] that reject the coming of the Lord all
[29:40] those that reject the message of the
[29:42] hour all those that reject the serve a
[29:44] living God there's nothing left but
[29:48] destruction my brother Joe can't you
[29:50] paint us a pretty picture I will get
[29:52] there but I want you to know it's not
[29:54] going to be pretty don't be a part of
[29:56] the Left Behind
[29:59] right so we find this Abomination
[30:01] brother said it has a compound meaning
[30:03] it also meant that time of Daniel 70
[30:06] weeks or the 70 years that they were
[30:07] held in captivity but it also speaks of
[30:10] our day it also speaks of an end time
[30:13] and we find that here we find that the
[30:16] church world has the end time all
[30:18] figured
[30:22] out we find the church world has its own
[30:25] idea of what it's going to be like when
[30:27] the world comes to an end right you know
[30:30] I was in the Baptist Church many years
[30:32] before I came to this message and I
[30:34] remember there was a series Left Behind
[30:36] Kirk Cameron many of you may know that
[30:38] and what you find that they got it all
[30:40] figured out the great theologians of the
[30:42] world they got airplanes falling from
[30:44] the skies so you're telling me every
[30:46] Captain every pilot in those planes or
[30:49] are happen to be Christians they all f
[30:51] with the Holy Ghost and serving the lord
[30:53] that those planes are going to come
[30:54] crashing down they have trains derailing
[30:58] from their track so every train
[31:00] conductor all of a sudden he got the
[31:01] Holy Ghost they have cars crashing into
[31:04] one another they have people Vanishing
[31:06] and one minute they're there the next
[31:08] minute they're gone let me tell you that
[31:10] is not how it's going to be it's going
[31:12] to be just like it was today it's going
[31:15] to be just another day but only thing
[31:17] different you and I won't be here oh
[31:20] Hallelujah I'm might tell you tonight
[31:22] cuz in the time of trouble we got a
[31:25] prophecy in the time of trouble we got a
[31:27] a promise that's right God sent you a
[31:32] Vindicated message to tell you to
[31:34] prepare to look for these
[31:36] things the Rapture of the church will be
[31:40] a secret going
[31:42] away brother BR says in one place he
[31:45] says the world is living as if they're
[31:46] going to come before Jesus comes they're
[31:48] going to make a an announcement on every
[31:50] radio station and on every television
[31:52] everybody get ready we got 30 days the
[31:54] Lord is coming he said it's a secret
[31:57] going away
[31:58] that's
[31:59] right he says you'll not know the hour
[32:02] nor the time but we know when he's
[32:05] coming the hour you think not that's
[32:09] scripture so what's that mean it means
[32:11] every day you need to be making
[32:13] preparation every day you need to be
[32:15] searching your heart searching your
[32:16] spirit searching your soul am I where I
[32:18] need to be if he comes today every
[32:21] morning should be we if if it's the day
[32:24] I'm going to meet the Lord I want to
[32:25] make sure my heart is right with him
[32:30] but they they think that it's just going
[32:32] to be you know all this
[32:35] chaos it may be chaos and then when
[32:38] we're gone oh church but the
[32:41] Rapture you know I remember as a kid I
[32:44] used to be afraid of the word rapture
[32:45] the term Rapture man I had bad dreams
[32:48] about the
[32:50] Rapture but the Rapture is the greatest
[32:52] thing that can ever happen to a Believer
[32:54] that's right the Rapture is our reward
[32:57] for believing and trusting we're going
[32:59] to kind of go through some of these
[33:01] things tonight I'm going to take this
[33:02] off cuz it's warm up
[33:04] here but notice brother ra says now
[33:06] Daniel's 70 weeks so it's a great
[33:08] scripture and it's a great uh uh this
[33:10] whole deal is so wonderful and so great
[33:12] because it shows us the hour in which
[33:14] we're in but he says it has nothing to
[33:16] do with the Gentiles nothing at all to
[33:19] do with it Israel is our time piece he
[33:22] goes if you want to know what time we're
[33:23] living in watch those Jews he says
[33:27] that's the only time piece now let me
[33:30] tell you don't pull your head out of the
[33:32] sand and you don't well I don't want to
[33:34] worry about what's going on over in
[33:36] Israel you need to be concerned about
[33:38] what's going on over there you need to
[33:40] be making sure that you're putting
[33:42] prophecies together because why they're
[33:44] the time piece when we see what's taking
[33:46] place and now Israel has become the
[33:48] burdensome Stone countries is pulled
[33:50] away from her her allies are pulling
[33:52] away from her Joe Biden has already said
[33:55] that she's an extreme country otherwise
[33:57] he saying that Israel is like a
[33:59] terrorist Nation let me tell you that's
[34:01] the nation that God has chose that's
[34:03] right and what God does for Israel in
[34:06] the natural he does for you and I the
[34:08] bride in the
[34:10] Supernatural but we find they turning on
[34:13] her just as well as they're turning on
[34:16] us what do you got this believe the sign
[34:18] they're turning on you those that used
[34:20] to sit right amongst you used to be our
[34:22] allies have now turned on us don't
[34:25] believe the message don't believe the
[34:26] Vindicated prophet
[34:28] in the message of 70 weeks of Daniel
[34:30] brother says to my understanding by the
[34:32] gospel by the holy spirit that the end
[34:35] time God returns again to the Jews do we
[34:38] believe
[34:40] that we know by the gospel that Paul
[34:43] taught and the others that God will
[34:45] return again to the Jews well then if
[34:47] he's going to return again to the Jews
[34:50] how can we apply that back to Daniel's
[34:53] time he goes we got to apply it in the
[34:56] last age and if it's after the Gentile
[34:58] church is gone cuz he deals with Israel
[35:01] as a nation and we as
[35:03] individuals So Daniel 70 weeks is of
[35:06] utmost importance for the body for the
[35:09] bride because we can see exactly we may
[35:12] not know the hour the day the moment but
[35:15] we can see the temperature rising to
[35:17] realize here we
[35:18] are it's time to quit playing it's time
[35:21] to just you know going through the
[35:22] motions has got to be over we got to get
[35:24] more sincere we got to get more
[35:26] dedicated brother B said the coming of
[35:28] the Lord should throw us into
[35:31] desperation desperation what I want to
[35:34] make sure I'm going to make it I don't
[35:35] want to be part of the left
[35:38] behind so we can see how close we are to
[35:42] the filling up of the cup of iniquity by
[35:45] watching Israel by seeing our time piece
[35:48] that's right so we certainly agree that
[35:50] we're not in the beginning of the L de
[35:52] seean age I hope we can certainly agree
[35:54] with that because we find God sends a
[35:56] messenger at the end End of the Age now
[35:58] he didn't send brother Bram at the end
[35:59] of the leoan age he sent him at the end
[36:01] of the Philadelphian age because there's
[36:04] not a messenger coming at the end of the
[36:05] Leo Dean age we received our message the
[36:08] only thing that's left for the bride is
[36:10] the going home of the
[36:12] church it's not to be part of the left
[36:14] behind but before the Lord turns back to
[36:16] the Jews notice what he's going to do
[36:18] he's going to snatch away his
[36:22] bride before he turns back to the Jews
[36:25] she'll be caught up with him and joy
[36:27] ening a wedding
[36:29] supper oh my that's nothing to be
[36:32] fretful about that's nothing to be
[36:33] concerned about you just got to make
[36:35] sure you make it brother Aaron did a
[36:38] great job manifestation of expectations
[36:40] you got to man know manage your
[36:42] expectations to that Lord let me dress
[36:45] myself in the word of God each and every
[36:47] day May my life become pure and clean
[36:50] and may I be a match piece to you and
[36:53] the same things that you did in the
[36:54] previous ages may you live out through
[36:57] my life in this age may I be the
[37:00] reflection of Christ to a dying
[37:01] generation that's who I want to be
[37:05] that's the manifestation of the
[37:07] expectation he's coming for a wife he's
[37:09] coming for a church without spot without
[37:12] wrinkle without blemish I say mama
[37:14] that's me tonight I want to be without
[37:17] spot I want to be without wrinkle I want
[37:19] to be without blemish Lord let your word
[37:22] make me that may I manifest that in this
[37:25] hour
[37:29] he says again now the Gentiles was not a
[37:32] lot at any certain
[37:34] time but the Jews were they had 70
[37:39] years but we find here in Luke 21 verse
[37:43] 24 they shall fall by the edge of the
[37:45] sword and shall be led away captive into
[37:47] all nations and Jerusalem shall be
[37:49] trotten down of the Gentiles until the
[37:52] time of the Gentiles be
[37:55] fulfilled and then he said says and
[37:58] there shall be signs in the Sun and Moon
[37:59] and in the stars and upon the Earth
[38:02] distressed upon the nations with
[38:04] perplexity the Sea and the waves are
[38:06] roaring men's heart are failing them for
[38:08] fear and for the looking after those
[38:11] things which are coming on the earth for
[38:12] powers of Heaven shall be shaken then
[38:15] shall they see the son of man coming in
[38:16] the cloud with power and great Glory
[38:19] then these things begin to come to pass
[38:21] he says look up and lift up your heads
[38:23] for your Redemption draweth nigh so we
[38:26] find when this end time destruction or
[38:29] the Gentile dispensation is being
[38:30] fulfilled he begins to Jesus begins to
[38:33] go in and tell us the things that are
[38:35] happening in the environment in which
[38:37] we're living in at that time men's
[38:38] hearts are failing them for fear the
[38:41] greatest the greatest uh thing that men
[38:43] face today is heart failure it's not by
[38:46] happen stance that it's heart failure
[38:47] it's fulfilling the scripture but we
[38:50] also find notice notice he says now then
[38:53] you shall see the son of man coming in a
[38:55] cloud let me tell we don't have the
[38:57] picture of the cloud up here it's back
[38:58] there but what was that that wasn't
[39:00] William Brown that was a picture of the
[39:02] son of man coming again in this day what
[39:04] was he doing showing that he is he is uh
[39:07] vindicating this
[39:08] message that wasn't some man's idea that
[39:11] was almighty God fulfilling the
[39:13] scripture that he came in this hour he
[39:16] came in this day to give you faith that
[39:18] you can put your rest in this word
[39:21] heavens and earth will pass away but
[39:24] this word will not pass away that's
[39:26] right the Revelation the prophecies will
[39:29] manifest I say Lord let it manifest
[39:31] through me in a time of trouble let my
[39:34] life manifest the message of the hour
[39:37] yes
[39:40] sir brother B says now in the mark of
[39:42] the beast and the S of God Gentile your
[39:46] days is just about
[39:49] over let me warn you in the name of the
[39:51] Lord Gentile your days is just about
[39:54] over the Gentile door is closed just as
[39:58] certain as I'm standing
[40:01] here we don't have an infinite amount of
[40:04] time
[40:05] Church it could be before we wake up in
[40:08] the
[40:09] morning it could before we get through
[40:11] the weekend it could be before we finish
[40:13] this service
[40:14] tonight but notice he said the Gentile
[40:17] he says your days is just about over let
[40:20] me warn you in the name of the Lord the
[40:22] Gentile door is closing just as certain
[40:25] as I'm standing here he said the
[40:28] muhammadans there would tread Down the
[40:30] Walls of Jerusalem until the Gentile
[40:32] dispensation be finished and fulfilled
[40:35] and he says in the spoken word The
[40:37] Original Seed he said God has promised
[40:39] be careful God has promised Malachi 4
[40:42] for this last
[40:43] day now come on everybody should be say
[40:46] Amen to that well that's our message
[40:48] right Malachi 4 is our ministry is our
[40:50] message he says and Malachi for has not
[40:53] yet been fulfilled now brother Brandon's
[40:55] being humble here he's recognizing he's
[40:58] trying to talk to an audience this is
[41:00] 1962 but he knows who he is but he says
[41:03] it's not been fulfilled yet but it must
[41:05] be fulfilled for it is a gerz word of
[41:08] God spoken through Malachi the prophet
[41:11] Jesus referred to it he said it is to be
[41:14] just before the coming of Christ the
[41:16] second time he says listen close now all
[41:19] scripture has not been fulfilled but
[41:21] must be before that time the Bible is to
[41:24] be finished it is to be finished to G
[41:27] dispensation is to be finished with the
[41:29] church age when this anointed messenger
[41:33] arrives let me tell you we're not in the
[41:36] day that the messenger is still here he
[41:38] has already preached his message and he
[41:40] is gone tell me what day are we living
[41:43] in their hearts of the people have
[41:46] already been turned back so one sign of
[41:49] the Gentile dispensation filling up was
[41:51] the ministry of Malachi 4 it would come
[41:54] first and turn the hearts of the elect
[41:56] back to the faith of the fathers sir
[41:59] that's one
[42:00] Vindication showing you where we are on
[42:03] the calendar of a
[42:06] Rapture so why must the heart of the
[42:09] Gentile bride be turned how many have
[42:12] ever wondered that why must our hearts
[42:13] be
[42:14] turned because she's predestinated to
[42:17] take a Rapture she's the one that's
[42:21] predestinated to take the Rapture you're
[42:24] not taking a Rapture unless your heart
[42:26] is been turned that's right you're not
[42:29] going to receive a body change unless
[42:31] your heart has been turned so we find
[42:34] and brother says this in the church AG
[42:36] he says now this messenger of Malachi 4
[42:40] and Revelations 10:7 is going to do two
[42:42] things everybody with me tonight all
[42:45] right I know it's kind of a different
[42:46] setting but let's just have it he says
[42:48] one according to Malachi 4 he will turn
[42:51] the hearts of the children to the
[42:53] fathers and the church said amen amen
[42:56] all those that had their heart's turn
[42:57] says amen amen all right we're going to
[43:00] get there notice he says two he will
[43:02] reveal the mysteries of the seven
[43:04] thunders in Revelations 10 which are the
[43:07] revelations contained in the Seven Seals
[43:10] it will be these divinely revealed
[43:13] mystery truths that literally turn the
[43:16] hearts of the children to the
[43:18] Pentecostal
[43:19] fathers so let me just say this and this
[43:22] if this sounds uh awful then just
[43:25] forgive me but sign and wonders didn't
[43:28] turn our
[43:29] hearts Miracles and the and the display
[43:32] of the supernatural didn't turn our
[43:34] hearts no the signs and wonders the
[43:37] Miracles and the display of Supernatural
[43:39] only caught our attention right but it
[43:42] was the these seals become open and
[43:45] these truths begin to manifest that's
[43:48] what turned our hearts back to the
[43:51] faith see the opening of the seals the
[43:53] revealing of the mystery truths that's
[43:56] what turned because only the bride's
[43:58] heart will be turned back and let me say
[44:00] this tonight if you are a bride no
[44:02] matter what you've been through no
[44:04] matter what kind of hell you've been
[44:05] going through no matter what kind of
[44:07] dirt the devil's put on you no matter
[44:09] what kind of trouble you've been in I
[44:11] want you to know if you got a seed on
[44:13] the inside there ain't enough devils in
[44:15] hell that can keep your heart from
[44:16] turning back God's got a word over it
[44:19] God's got a prophecy over that the elect
[44:22] their hearts will be
[44:24] turned I say hallelujah tonight and if
[44:27] your heart gets turned that means the
[44:29] body's going to take a Rapture
[44:31] Hallelujah tonight Church you got
[44:34] nothing to fear tonight my heart's been
[44:36] turned that's only a foreshadow that my
[44:39] body's going to be
[44:40] changed glory to God oh should give you
[44:44] Faith tonight yes sir the Turning of the
[44:48] heart turn back to the faith not to
[44:52] Creeds and dogmas and ideas of man but
[44:54] to the faith of the father
[44:57] he said Gross Darkness now the blinding
[45:01] of Israel was for the lighting of the
[45:04] Gentiles now the blinding of the
[45:06] Gentiles is the lighting of Israel so
[45:09] we're living in a day as the scripture
[45:11] would say gross Darkness upon the land
[45:14] or Darkness upon the lands gross
[45:16] Darkness upon the people so why is that
[45:19] because God is about to turn back to the
[45:22] Jews so the blinding of the Gentiles the
[45:26] light going out Darkness setting in only
[45:29] means that he's about to go back to the
[45:33] Jews he said and the church is making
[45:36] herself ready been making herself ready
[45:39] for a time it's time for the
[45:43] Rapture come on church I know you've
[45:46] been worried about what this election is
[45:48] going to bring is it going to be camela
[45:50] is she going to be the one to fit the
[45:52] bill let me tell you I'm not worried
[45:53] about camela I don't care if it's Donald
[45:56] Trump I don't care who you put there it
[45:58] ain't going to change the prophecy
[46:00] there's already been a word spoken it's
[46:02] going to get wickeder and wickeder and
[46:04] worse and worse as long as time is here
[46:07] but in a moment in the twinkling of an
[46:09] eye oh there's been a promise spoken
[46:11] over we shall be
[46:13] change there ain't enough devils and
[46:15] hell can keep that scure from coming to
[46:18] pass it don't matter how dark it gets
[46:20] how chaotic it get we will be
[46:23] changed glory to God tonight we're going

[47:14] there ain't enough anything that can
[47:16] take place to stop us from not fitting
[47:19] the bill so we find that all Christian
[47:22] them they recognize that the Rapture is

[47:41] there's no way we can continue down the
[47:43] road that we're going indefinitely
[47:45] something's bound to happen and so
[47:48] they're believing for a Rapture they're
[47:51] believing like you're believing for a
[47:54] Rapture but notice see the prophet tell
[47:56] tell us but watch the Jews that's your
[47:59] time piece so they're looking for it and
[48:03] if they're looking for it if they're
[48:05] sensing it if they can feel the
[48:07] atmosphere increasing and it's
[48:09] cultivating into a body change for in
[48:11] elect people what about the elect people
[48:14] shouldn't we be more concerned about the
[48:16] things of God than we are about our
[48:18] YouTube channel than we are about our
[48:20] Tik toks and everything else our social
[48:22] media platforms are be real let me tell

[48:31] you want to do with it but I'm just
[48:32] telling you don't let that be your main
[48:33] focus your main focus has got to be I
[48:36] got to be changed I got to look into the
[48:38] mirror of God's word and let myself fit
[48:41] that
[48:42] image wonderful we get so caught up on
[48:45] how many likes I get thank God I don't
[48:48] have

[48:52] fat
[48:54] man okay I got one like two likes man
[48:58] can I get a three can I get a
[49:00] four but we find every the world is
[49:04] recognizing we're at the
[49:07] end and we still at the end we still
[49:11] have people playing
[49:14] church we still not just young we still
[49:17] have some of the older middleaged come
[49:20] oh you know me and my wife were talking
[49:22] the other day and and you say well I
[49:24] come to
[49:25] church that's that's great coming to
[49:28] church is different being in church is
[49:30] different than being in his
[49:34] presence being in church well I go to so
[49:37] and so church that's great but where's
[49:39] the presence of God I want to be in a
[49:43] whether it be a building whether it be a
[49:44] car whether it be in my closet whether
[49:46] it be in my home whether it be in my
[49:47] office wherever it is I want to be where
[49:49] the presence his presence can come down
[49:52] like it came down today when I was
[49:54] studying and it begin to turn my
[49:55] attention away from the consummation and
[49:58] all that's going to befall Us in the end
[50:00] time and begin to push me into the
[50:01] Rapture the Rapture theme tonight to
[50:04] give you you have a hope tonight you
[50:06] have a promise tonight let me tell you
[50:08] let that be your drive let that be your
[50:10] focus not how many likes you get but
[50:12] long as you're like by him
[50:17] tonight brother said God's been running
[50:19] the Jews back into their Homeland which
[50:22] they' been away for 2,000 years while
[50:24] the Gentile was making ready
[50:27] and now the Gentiles has turned Christ
[50:29] on the outside of the church according
[50:31] to Revelations the third chapter he
[50:33] can't even get back in his church
[50:35] there's no place for him to go he's
[50:37] rejected then he says these words and
[50:41] it's time for the
[50:44] Rapture so not only do we see the Jews
[50:47] in their Homeland now we see Christ is
[50:50] on the outside of his church so what do
[50:53] you mean we find here behold I stand at
[50:55] the door and I
[50:57] knock he's not he's a gentleman he's not
[51:01] going to just barge into your life he's
[51:03] going to knock and let you open the door
[51:05] to him see if any man hear my voice and
[51:09] open the door I will come in to him and
[51:12] I will Su with him and he with me notice
[51:15] Christ has been put on the
[51:17] outside and now we have in the church
[51:20] system today gays and lesbians standing
[51:23] behind the pulpit preaching what they
[51:25] claim is a the gospel
[51:27] we have gays and lesbians in the
[51:30] congregations when never no desire to
[51:32] change Come As You Are God loves you as
[51:36] you are no he loves you as you are but
[51:37] he expects you to be
[51:39] changed because if it was an Abomination
[51:42] then it's an Abomination again today but
[51:45] however when you look at Revelations 3
[51:47] and 20 the call wasn't to the church to
[51:50] call was to the
[51:52] individual notice them that will open
[51:54] the door open their heart to him he said
[51:57] I will come in and I will s with him I
[51:59] will dine with him I will break bread
[52:02] with him I will reveal myself to him and
[52:05] he can suck with me that's where we want
[52:07] to be tonight Church we're not going
[52:09] with the masses we're just a small
[52:11] called out little group but he's not on
[52:13] the outside of our church he's not on
[52:15] the outside of our hearts tonight we've
[52:17] accepted him we have opened the door of
[52:19] understanding and say Lord come in and
[52:21] sub with me reveal yourself to me in a
[52:24] great Mighty way
[52:29] he says now don't you remember that as
[52:31] soon as a church
[52:33] goes as soon as the church goes the
[52:36] church goes then the Jews take hold of
[52:38] it and come in but first the next thing
[52:41] in order is not a mighty nation on a
[52:44] national rev Revival amongst the
[52:46] Gentiles the next thing in order is the
[52:49] coming of the kingdom of God the coming
[52:51] of
[52:54] Christ and we're going to go somewhere
[52:56] here in this is recognized in your day
[52:57] in this message very familiar quote for
[53:00] many of us for B says everywhere now
[53:02] there's there's no Revival everybody is
[53:05] complaining ministers are crying I was
[53:07] reading one of the outstanding papers
[53:09] that comes here to the church very fine
[53:11] paper and I know the ad aor and I know
[53:13] the people they're godly people very
[53:15] fine Pentecostal people sat under
[53:18] brother brandman's Ministry or had him
[53:20] there to minister for them these are not
[53:23] just anybody church or anybody people
[53:26] crying out for it he says they're godly
[53:28] people very fine brother and sister Mo
[53:31] of the herald of his coming one of the
[53:33] finest papers on the field The Herald of
[53:35] is coming but they hardly will print
[53:37] anything unless it's about fast pray
[53:40] fast pray sound the trumpet how many
[53:43] reads it he says you know you see it all
[53:46] the time fast pray fast pray it's all
[53:49] you hear fast pray we're going to have a
[53:51] great breaking of the day there's going
[53:53] to be a great thing going to happen all
[53:55] of you pray pray pray we're not too late
[53:58] yet see they're crying out even back
[53:59] then they were crying and today now the
[54:02] mainstream denominations are crying out
[54:05] for a worldwide Revival I was in ausa
[54:08] Street a couple months back in ausa
[54:10] street right there still today they're
[54:11] still calling for another
[54:14] Revival they saw a display back in the
[54:17] early 1900s and they're waiting every
[54:19] day somebody is in that building praying
[54:22] 24/7 praying for a national Revival but
[54:25] let me tell you it ain't coming
[54:28] church he said they have not recognized
[54:32] The Awakening of the
[54:35] Bride Oh by being a Christian they feel
[54:37] the pool of the hour but they haven't
[54:39] recognized what's been done that's
[54:41] what's making them feel that way they
[54:43] know something is supposed to happen but
[54:46] see they're looking for a way off in the
[54:47] future to come when it's already happen
[54:50] right by
[54:52] you he said that's the same thing it did
[54:54] in the old days they were believing in
[54:55] the coming of the Messiah they believe
[54:57] that there would be a forerunner come
[54:59] but it was right on them and they didn't
[55:00] know it they didn't recognize they
[55:02] believed there would be a forerunner
[55:04] that would forun the Messiah and they
[55:06] cut his head off they killed their
[55:07] Messiah because it was prophesied that
[55:10] they would be blinded and he says now
[55:12] again he says and the same spirit that
[55:14] spoke through Hosea spoke through John
[55:16] and said the church in the last days
[55:18] would be naked would be blind would they
[55:22] would put them on the outside of the
[55:23] church they failed to see those
[55:25] prophecies fulfilled but being in there
[55:28] they realize that something has got to
[55:30] happen they just don't get it they don't
[55:33] realize much like the Jews of the old
[55:35] times blinded Leo de seea of riches
[55:37] theology hostile with the church hostile
[55:40] toward the message look how hostile the
[55:42] Jews were with John look how hostile
[55:44] they were with Jesus when they was the
[55:46] very one that they claimed that they
[55:48] were looking
[55:49] for see they're crying for a Revival but
[55:53] that Revival will never come
[55:57] see however the Revival that's a church
[56:00] the Revival for the church will never
[56:02] happen because the church has been
[56:05] indicted brother bman indicted the
[56:08] church system he indicted the churches
[56:10] the denominations for rejecting the word
[56:13] of
[56:14] God but why are you here tonight because
[56:17] you didn't reject the
[56:19] word so tonight we find brother man tell
[56:22] us now there's three comings of the Lord
[56:24] the Lord Jesus came first to redeem his
[56:26] bride second to receive his bride and
[56:29] third with his bride so we as the bride
[56:32] we're not looking for a great
[56:35] Revival now hear me out and I want to
[56:37] say this we're not looking for a great
[56:40] Revival we are the
[56:43] Revival come on we are in the bride's
[56:46] Revival we have received the message
[56:49] that's why we can believe for the
[56:50] Supernatural That's why we can believe
[56:52] that cancer is defeated that's why we
[56:54] can believe that particles can come home
[56:56] that's all we can believe in the change
[56:58] of these bodies because we as the bride
[57:01] are in
[57:02] Revival and this revival is going to
[57:05] take us to the change of our
[57:08] bodies we're not looking for a Revival

[57:35] up to the word and it's done the
[57:37] supernatural we've got signs and wonders
[57:39] and Supernatural but more importantly we
[57:42] got a life that manifest the word of
[57:46] God we're looking for the day and the
[57:49] hour that we're going to be caught up
[57:52] with
[57:53] him we're looking for the day when these
[57:55] B IES of humiliation and Decay will
[58:00] become new strong and
[58:03] vibrant we're looking for that time well
[58:06] there'll never be another heartache
[58:08] there'll never be another tear shed for
[58:10] a lost loved one we're looking for the
[58:13] time when the wrinkles will come back
[58:15] and it's better than olil of
[58:17] Olay oh my see we're
[58:21] looking we're believing we're
[58:24] trusting what any moment we're going to
[58:26] step into our great
[58:28] reward to be seated with him in his
[58:34] throne oh Church the Bible says he that
[58:37] endureth to the end the same shall be
[58:41] saved he didn't say it was going to be
[58:44] easy but you got a message yes sir
[58:47] that's for told you these things listen
[58:48] what brother R says here in The
[58:50] Invisible Union of the bride of Christ
[58:51] he says when the spiritual bride when
[58:54] she begins to have of a Revival when she
[58:58] begins to come back and line herself up
[59:00] with the word of God watch then again
[59:03] you see how that the scriptures at that
[59:05] time there will be a message sweep out
[59:07] to catch that bride catch that woman the
[59:11] elect oh that's it church that's us why
[59:14] cuz we're lining back up with the word
[59:16] some of you were Methodist some of you
[59:18] were Baptist some of you were Pentecost
[59:20] some of you were this some of you were
[59:21] Sinners but oh let me tell you when you
[59:24] come and begin to line up with the word
[59:26] God sent you a message and he caught
[59:28] that heart of yours and he turned that
[59:30] heart back to the faith of the fathers
[59:32] that's
[59:34] right oh
[59:37] Hallelujah so notice the Jews we're
[59:39] going to start bringing this down I got
[59:41] about 30
[59:42] minutes we're going to do it everything
[59:45] brother B says everything fell right in
[59:48] their
[59:49] hand how did they do it because Hitler's
[59:52] heart was hardened melini's heart was
[59:56] hardened just like Pharaoh's heart was
[59:59] hardened driving them back into that
[1:00:02] land so 2500 years the Jews were without
[1:00:06] a Homeland but God gave them a little
[1:00:09] sliver of land and said I'll bless you
[1:00:12] inside that land and let me tell you God
[1:00:14] has given you a little sliver of the
[1:00:16] word I'll bless you as long as you stay
[1:00:19] in the message of the hour outside of
[1:00:22] that I'm not promised to bless you I'm
[1:00:24] not going to bless you and brother ra
[1:00:26] says Abraham when he left the promised
[1:00:27] land he said they didn't do one
[1:00:30] Miracle outside of that promised land so
[1:00:33] we find now that they their hearts were
[1:00:35] hardened these Hearts were hardened and
[1:00:37] he said for 40 years they've been coming
[1:00:39] back into the land and they've been
[1:00:40] waiting for so notice now the Jews are
[1:00:44] back in their Homeland and they have
[1:00:45] been back for 67 years they're not on
[1:00:48] their way back they are back and they
[1:00:51] are a great nation they have many
[1:00:53] capabilities that far exceeds many other
[1:00:56] countes that little bitty country God
[1:00:58] has blessed him in that
[1:01:03] Homeland so

[1:04:02] of the Lord that we which are alive and
[1:04:05] remain until the coming of the Lord
[1:04:08] shall not prevent them which are asleep

[1:04:13] from heaven with a shout amen and
[1:04:16] brother says the shout I think we just
[1:04:19] lost life the shout is the message going
[1:04:22] forth to call
[1:04:24] out that's right amen so he says he's
[1:04:27] going to descend with a shout and he
[1:04:29] says then he'll come with the voice of
[1:04:31] the Archangel and with the Trump of God
[1:04:34] and the dead in Christ shall rise first
[1:04:37] and we which are alive and remain shall
[1:04:40] be caught up together with them in the
[1:04:41] clouds to meet the Lord in the air

[1:08:34] does it do it does away with the Gentile
[1:08:36] age it's all over and God completely
[1:08:39] quits dealing with them let him that's
[1:08:41] be filthy be filthy still him that's
[1:08:43] holy be holy still what does he do then
[1:08:45] he takes the church the Holy
[1:08:49] Ghost amen and then the the rapure
[1:08:52] message he goes do you know that the
[1:08:54] Protestant and the Catholic Church is
[1:08:56] predicted in the last days to be blind
[1:09:00] the same thing to know to the scriptures
[1:09:02] with Christ on the outside trying to get
[1:09:04] in because they sayest I'm rich I have
[1:09:06] need of nothing knowest thou not that
[1:09:08] thou are miserable poor wretched naked
[1:09:11] blind and don't know it Revelations 3
[1:09:13] there you are back to the blindness
[1:09:15] again trampling over things of God as if
[1:09:17] it didn't mean nothing to them sculping
[1:09:19] and making fun of it that's what the
[1:09:21] Bible says but to the church the bride
[1:09:24] the Rapture is a
[1:09:26] revelation that's
[1:09:28] right so the Rapture is a revelation to
[1:09:33] you brother Tim can't tell you I can't
[1:09:35] tell you brother brother Aon can't tell
[1:09:37] you brother Timothy can't tell that
[1:09:39] you're going to make it you have to be
[1:09:41] told it's got to be a revelation that my
[1:09:44] heart has been turned my Nature's been
[1:09:46] changed my desires have been changed the
[1:09:49] things I used to do I do no more the
[1:09:51] desires I used to have I don't have
[1:09:53] anymore now my desires to
[1:09:56] the Rapture is a revelation that you've
[1:09:59] already made it
[1:10:02] hallelujah hallelujah wonderful but to
[1:10:05] the church the bride the Rapture the
[1:10:06] Revelation to her it's revealed to her
[1:10:09] that the Revelation the true bride of
[1:10:10] Christ will be waiting for that
[1:10:13] revelation of the
[1:10:15] rap now he says it is a revelation for
[1:10:20] the the Revelation is Faith and you
[1:10:22] cannot have Revelation with without
[1:10:24] being of Faith so faith is a revelation
[1:10:27] because it's something that's revealed
[1:10:29] to you faith is a revelation faith is
[1:10:31] something that you that's been revealed
[1:10:33] to you like it was to Abraham that could
[1:10:35] call anything contrary to what's been
[1:10:37] revealed to him as though it wasn't so
[1:10:40] now Faith that's what faith is it's a
[1:10:42] revelation of God and the church is
[1:10:44] built upon the Revelation the whole
[1:10:46] entire body and how does faith come by
[1:10:50] hearing that's right so what do you hear
[1:10:52] every surface that even like Tabernacle
[1:10:55] you hear Faith being
[1:10:57] preached you hear Faith being preached
[1:10:59] to elevate you up you hear great
[1:11:02] teachings you hear Mysteries you hear
[1:11:04] deep things of God you also hear things
[1:11:05] that are simple and things that are
[1:11:07] basic the fundamental foundations of our
[1:11:09] faith we bring a great mixture to the
[1:11:11] body of Christ here all with the aspect
[1:11:13] of increasing your faith so that you can
[1:11:15] have faith that you've already made
[1:11:19] it so the Rapture is not an event
[1:11:23] people did you hear he me I know we
[1:11:25] think about one day between 6 and N
[1:11:28] brother says that in the Rapture message
[1:11:30] and you hear preachers going around the
[1:11:31] world well between 6 and9 6 and9 6 and9
[1:11:33] 6
[1:11:36] and9 but he said there'll be two in the
[1:11:38] field I'll take one and leave one
[1:11:40] there'll be two in the bed I'll take one
[1:11:41] I'll leave one he said it's a Universal
[1:11:44] Event it's not an event it's a people
[1:11:47] the Rapture is not any certain event
[1:11:50] it's not any certain time it is a people
[1:11:52] that has made theirself ready for the
[1:11:54] change
[1:11:56] right and it's a revelation to you that
[1:11:58] when Jesus comes you're going with him
[1:12:02] you have to have that Revelation that no
[1:12:03] matter what you face no matter how
[1:12:05] difficult life is how bad the troubles
[1:12:07] are and the battles are you're going to
[1:12:09] be caught up with
[1:12:11] him do you realize that there there has
[1:12:14] to be a revelation I mean there has to
[1:12:17] be a reation true but there has to be a
[1:12:20] Rapture for God to be complete amen
[1:12:23] that's right amen has to be a rure now
[1:12:26] I'm going to slow down just for a second
[1:12:28] because I don't want you to miss this
[1:12:29] you realize there has to be a Rapture
[1:12:32] because God isn't complete without
[1:12:37] you and brother Brown makes this
[1:12:39] statement if you were in the fourn
[1:12:41] knowledge of God then you're becoming a
[1:12:43] part of God and the only way that you
[1:12:45] can be a son and daughter of God you had
[1:12:47] to be a part of God God isn't complete
[1:12:51] without you oh come on my some of you
[1:12:54] been worried about purpose some of you
[1:12:56] been worried am I going to make it God
[1:12:58] isn't complete without you right he says
[1:13:01] and when the bride is being called out
[1:13:03] how he goes how are you going to put it
[1:13:05] out it's the revelation of the
[1:13:07] manifestation of the word made truth
[1:13:10] we're living in the day praise God the
[1:13:12] revelation of the mystery of himself yes
[1:13:16] so I'm going to say something the
[1:13:17] Rapture is the completion of the mystery
[1:13:20] of himself yeah did you hear what I said
[1:13:24] the Rapture is the Revelation it is the
[1:13:26] completion of the mystery of himself for
[1:13:29] he without us or they without us cannot
[1:13:32] be made perfect he is not complete
[1:13:35] without you lord so when he takes his
[1:13:38] bride he becomes complete every thought
[1:13:41] that he ever had his finished every
[1:13:43] every attribute to be a father to be a
[1:13:46] savior to be a Healer to be a husband
[1:13:48] everything that he ever had in his
[1:13:51] thinking is now been made complete
[1:13:53] that's right because because he raptured
[1:13:56] his rde Hallelujah notice she's no
[1:13:58] longer waiting on him now she's with him
[1:14:01] that's right amen
[1:14:04] wonderful yes the Rapture is the
[1:14:07] completion of the mystery of himself
[1:14:10] hallelujah amen but B says the Rapture
[1:14:14] that we're talking about is only for the
[1:14:18] bride remember the Bible the rest of the
[1:14:21] Dead live Not A Thousand Years the great
[1:14:22] Rapture if there's not a Rapture friend
[1:14:25] where we at where we at what are we
[1:14:27] going to do what age are we living in
[1:14:29] what promise do we have there's going to
[1:14:31] be a Rapture the Bible sday will be and
[1:14:34] it will only be for the elected the
[1:14:36] elected lady the bride in this day
[1:14:39] that's pulled out the church is it back
[1:14:43] on well praise
[1:14:47] God all
[1:14:52] right testing it ain't give it a second
[1:14:55] all right let's keep going and he being
[1:14:58] the groom the bride has to come
[1:15:00] forth because it's part of him
[1:15:04] yeah I'm trying to show you this thought
[1:15:07] that we just spoke about now it can only
[1:15:10] be the manifestation of the fulfilling
[1:15:12] of all the revelations in the others has
[1:15:14] spoke of the Bride it can only manifest
[1:15:17] if it does something different from the
[1:15:19] groom than it isn't the bride because
[1:15:21] she is flesh of his flesh bone of his
[1:15:24] bone life of his life power of his power
[1:15:27] she is him
[1:15:29] yeah that's why you're the completion
[1:15:32] that's why when he raptures his bride
[1:15:34] that is the completion of the mystery of
[1:15:36] God yes everything that God had in his
[1:15:39] intention in his thoughts in his AC had
[1:15:41] now been complete when he takes his
[1:15:43] little bride off
[1:15:45] the
[1:15:47] Hallelujah because she's flesh of his
[1:15:49] flesh bone of his bone life of his life
[1:15:51] power of his power she is him amen amen
[1:15:56] that's why we're not in the
[1:15:57] r yeah that's why we're not insane and
[1:16:00] lost our mind on medication 247 trying
[1:16:03] to calm our nerves we have a revelation
[1:16:06] of the Rapture right notice we've
[1:16:09] received the message we have peace
[1:16:10] that's surpasses all understanding yes
[1:16:14] many wonder how we can be so calm in a
[1:16:16] chaotic age CU we have a message right
[1:16:19] cuz we have a revelation not just a
[1:16:21] revelation of who we are but a
[1:16:22] revelation of where we're going that's
[1:16:25] right they wonder why you don't get all
[1:16:27] caught up in politics in this
[1:16:28] presidential W man that's all you hear
[1:16:31] all you see is camela and and and the
[1:16:33] Democratic party and and Donald Trump
[1:16:35] and the Republican party and this one
[1:16:37] against the other and now we got one
[1:16:39] calling the one all the Trump voters
[1:16:41] garbage and all this kind of stuff we're
[1:16:42] not caught up in all that I don't care
[1:16:44] who wins cuz at the end of the day we
[1:16:47] win that's that's all I'm worried about
[1:16:49] is we're winning we're going to be
[1:16:50] translated we're going to be changed
[1:16:53] we're going to be raptured
[1:16:55] and we do it take place in the time of
[1:17:00] trouble amen
[1:17:03] yes notice the sign of his coming proves
[1:17:06] that the coming that the coming is right
[1:17:08] at hand now it could come at any time it
[1:17:12] don't he goes I don't see nothing to H
[1:17:15] the Rapture of the church right now
[1:17:19] amen after the sign was manifested fully
[1:17:21] to Abraham and his group then the next
[1:17:24] thing comes was that
[1:17:29] change hey just now we done seen
[1:17:31] everything through justification
[1:17:33] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:17:36] placing of the son the signs and wonders
[1:17:37] of him being in the presence of theer
[1:17:40] the thoughts of the heart and so forth
[1:17:41] he said as it was in the days of Sodom
[1:17:43] so shall it be at the coming of the son
[1:17:45] of man we see that taking place right
[1:17:48] now what was the next thing the change
[1:17:51] of the
[1:17:53] body he says now now show that this that
[1:17:56] we're looking for and expect the son
[1:17:58] glory is that right we cannot meet him
[1:18:00] in these bodies if we were changed back
[1:18:02] to young men and women still we can't
[1:18:04] meet them because we have to meet them
[1:18:06] in the air there has to be something
[1:18:08] done besides changes back to young men
[1:18:11] and young women we got to be changed and
[1:18:13] call up in the air to meet him the next
[1:18:15] thing coming is the rapture of the
[1:18:16] church and the change of the body of the
[1:18:18] sleeping Saints to meet the Lord in the
[1:18:21] end
