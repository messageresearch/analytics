every situation and today we are raised up with him by his grace and all things are under our feet today we go forward in his name it's could to be here in the house of the Lord today and glad to have all the guests that are still here from the wedding yesterday and want to be thankful to the Lord for the beautiful wedding time that we had together looking forward to a great wedding in the sky amen when we'll be United with the lamb there's going to be a lamb on Earth a bride of people that will match the coming lamb from Heaven I believe we're a part of that this morning we just want to enter in today with all of our hearts anden we have the the burrow family here that we haven't seen in a while so welcome God bless you thank you for coming today each one of you that are here I pray a special blessing on you today as the word Goes Forth we have with us our brother Donnie Reagan from Johnson City Tennessee and brother Donnie and I have been friends for a long time since about 1987 I would meet him for my first time hear of him before in his ministry how God was using him and then it was my privilege to meet with him and after that we became fast friends and best friends and I'm so appreciative of God's men that he places here that will edify the body of Christ and build them up I'm thankful for balanced Ministry who know the word of God and can bring it in a true and balanced way so today as you are here in this service I Want You To Worship the Lord as we hear the word I want you to respond to it with an amen with the Hallelujah where your glories to God because it's when we respond to the word that God moves back and deals with our hearts and speaks to us in a special way and does things for us so respond to him today and let him speak to you in a real way amen I pray that you'll just pray for our brother Donnie as he ministers today we wanted to sing the song Mercy rewrote my life as brother Donnie comes and I pray today that this will be a day a time that God will truly rewrite your life it doesn't matter who you are or how long you've been a Christian there are things that can be Rewritten in your life things that God can deal with and adjustments that can be made and if you're not a Christian today I would pray for you you would leave this building God would so rewrite your life that you would know that your names are written in heaven before the foundation of the world that that Revelation become real to you that you are chosen of God may he speak to you today he's our healer as brother Tim winter sung so beautifully a moment ago Jehovah Rafa and I want you just to realize he can heal your situation that there is no problem that is too big for our God it doesn't matter whether it's age related situations or whether you're young it doesn't matter if it's a teenage problem a marriage problem a financial situation this God cares about you and your need he's a personal God I was just speaking with brother Andrew Glover and he just kind of told me this story as he just came from Brother bcll where he was spend a little time with him brother bisc just reiterated some experiences with him that he had with brother bradam and remember to pray for brother Bisal he'll be 90 this year and you know age is not kind to any of us so remember him in prayer but he just he he just shared with him said you know we were up among the Indians and there in British Colombia and some of them were not able to get help from the government cuz they didn't know their date of birth and they didn't know their um even you know any of their personal informations of when when they were born and and um and things that that was needed to fill out the forms for the for the assistance and they were living in extreme poverty because of it brother brandham sat down with them one by one and told them their date of birth when they were born filled out their forms where they could get the assistance that they needed you know what that tells me that God is a personal God he knows when you were born he knows exactly what your situation is he knows the answer to your problem the god that we serve is a big God but he wasn't so big that he just remained in heaven aloof from all of us but he become one of us to give his life on our on our behalf to rewrite our lives so let him rewrite your life today let him speak to you in a special way as We Worship the Lord together as brother Donnie comes Mercy reot my life Mercy reot my [Music] life I should have fallen my soul cast down but Mercy let's sing it together Mercy thank you Lord [Music] I I cast down my Mercy my I would sure hate to think today where we would be if it wasn't for the mercy of God you I'm so grateful when we think about Mercy though we don't think about what we can do and get by with as far as wrong and sin and all of that and that God will be merciful to us a person that's really experienced that it changes their life changes their life about Grace about forgiveness about Mercy we're so grateful for that today had a little glitch in my computer so I won't be singing it right now turn with me to U Genesis CH 3: 6 I know out in the old west a lot of guys used to carry U two six guns I carry two iPads cuz I was fixing to walk out just a minute ago and my other one went crazy so I've got another one then if that goes down I've got it on my phone so God bless you we certainly appreciate the opportunity to get to be with you today and once again with my dear friend brother Tim I'm really sorry brother Timothy couldn't be with this service today I was looking so forward to seeing him again too Genesis 3: 6 I want to speak to you today by the help of the Lord on dressed for the occasion and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sowed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons verse 21 now that's what they did this is what God did unto Adam also so and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins and closed them so they covered thems with one thing botney life could not bleed could not suffer but God closed him with something else the first time that we see the word close or CL clothed used in the Bible and in this case the occasion was Redemption let's bow our heads together Heavenly Father we so love you today we're truly thankful we're blessed people to be able to gather together once again in the the house of God we're grateful Lord that we also realize the house of God is not just this building but it's this mystical body that's sitting here today that individually we've been baptized into Christ Jesus for that we are so thankful may you take the service today may you help us Lord you know the needs of all your children father I pray if there's a need that lays out of the confines that I've studied today make me sensitive that I would be able to go out maybe to a little straying sheep Lord maybe to one that's heartbroken or heavy lad it may not be but five words or 10 but it would be something that would touch them yes Lord Make Me sensitive I pray father not only me but help the people here today help them to realize that the preacher does not bring a service in his briefcase or on his iPad but a great portion of the service so be determined by them too we are so needy but our God is so great and so wonderful would you speak to us today Father in the name of the Lord Jesus we ask it and the Saints said God bless you you may be seated all of us of course can appreciate what God did for Adam and Eve there in the Garden of Eden we're all aware and very common to us as far as certain clothes that we wear to certain things some of you all were at the wedding that we had yesterday and as I looked out and saw the people when I first got there and watching them continue to arrive and I seen men that I knew were not really comfortable in a suit you know we just have that look about us don't we when you were just you know U some of them did not have a suit on but they had on a dress shirt and a tie because the way they looked at it there was something about the occasion that they felt like it would be worse inconveniencing thems in order to to dress in a way that would suit the occasion now had I walked out in my favorite clothes my favorite clothes are blue jeans a T-shirt and a pair of Sketcher shoes but if I would have walked out that way and I would have come out and Stood Beside brother Tim and those of you that were there and the other people that were there and they would have looked at me and thought what in the world is the matter with that preacher why would he wear well what if I would have said well these are my favorite clothes Carol told me the other day I've got a t-shirt that I wear down the basement whenever I'm staining and refinishing and whatever I'm doing down there and it's got two or three holes right up here where the buttons are it's got two or three holes right here she said you're going to have to get rid of that shirt I said that's one of my most favorite shirts it's just getting broke in she said how long you had it 20 years years 25 but to be comfortable is not always right now leoda is very comfortable in what they are wearing as a matter of fact they're wearing nothing in the eyes of God they are naked and yet they feel like they are dressed for the occasion of the marriage supper so if we would have had the wedding yesterday and we would have went through it all and then we go over to the place where we're going to have the reception and there's people in there that's not even got any clothes on at all would you all have sat down with them well how you doing been a while since I've seen you so good to see you nice to see you you know the sad part about Leo deia is she's totally convinced she's closed Rapture Ready Now may I say when I refer to Leo deia I'm not just talking about denominational people the sad part about it is we've got folks sitting in message churches that are as Leo deia as they can be they're blind wretched miserable poor and naked but yet the way they look at it well I I believe God sent a prophet but I I believe that you know I believe every word he said yeah and he said you could do that and that's just being able to read so if we're going to meet the Lord and we believe of course that we're living in that time when the Rapture is going to be we certainly do not want to meet him in the way that Adam and Eve met him it was the first time that they had ever experienced this type of emotion yeah every day prior to this we don't know how long that they had lived in the Garden of Eden in this perfect setting but every day in the evening Papa would come down yes and the little fire would start burning and the bushs would start moving and he had settle down and Adam would grab her by the hand and say sweetheart it's time for us to go up to church and worship and their Church wasn't a place like this of course but a Cathedral of trees and every day they did this for thousands of years maybe who knows we don't know for sure but on this day God showed up but Adam wasn't in church God showed up but Eve wasn't in church now the omnipotence and omnipresence of God he knew where they were but he wanted to give them an opportunity to come clean and be reckoned with him so the prophet said one of the saddest scriptures in the Bible was God running can you imagine God running God running through the Garden of Eden screaming Adam Adam God may have passed the bush that he was H hiding by behind four or five times but just went right by as if though he didn't know where he was [Music] Adam where are you son finally he mustered up enough courage to say I'm over here Lord I hid myself because I'm afraid most of and small children started experiencing that emotion fear but this man is an adult maybe hundreds of years old thousands of years old we don't know and the first time he experienced it it must have been such trauma that it was overwhelming he felt so afraid so his response was instead of coming out to meet God the way You' done every day before was to hide right he didn't know anything else to do just a reaction in Fallen man to hide that's so he takes her by the hand and they go over and they hide his heart racing his blood pressure fluctuating flushing in his skin her standing behind him terrified of the very same being that there's waiting for him the day before with anticipation so the prophet said I can imagine seeing that portal Eve when she looked at Adam her long blonde hair hanging down her at her back those bright blue eyes that look like the skies where God had made them tears pouring down mixing with the blood on the garments now God knew that what they had done was an appropriation of their own works but it would never stand up in the presence of God so they took fig leaves and begin to sew them together and we know that they put the Fig leaves around the guilty part of their Anatomy which was not their mouths Adam and Eve did not come out from behind the bushes with a covid-19 mask on because they didn't need a mask but they covered what to them was the guilty part of their sin and if you look at the Hebrew word it is a loin cloth not a mask so God got a lamb and killed that lamb and took the skin off of it and throw it in behind the bushes and said Put it on and come out the prophet said eve and Adam his strong body body caught her she leaned over on his bosom there are the tears mingling falling as it run through the sheep skins blood dripping down so here they come out in the presence of God and they're afraid to look at him they're ashamed they're embarrassed they're humiliated but at least they were properly dressed I'm so glad when I came to the Lord Lord so many many years ago I wasn't raised in church and didn't know anything about church I had to ask my mama how to even get saved I didn't know how but when I went up to that Altar and that little Pentecostal church I found myself being clothed in a cloak of repentance and sorrow right and sadness how many knows what I'm talking about today so even before you met him he provided for you a cloak that would be able to bring a broken and a contract spirit in his presence why that's what he requires that's right and we realize as we go on in time we're preaching more and more and more to educated message people yeah that whenever a preacher goes to start quoting a quote they can just about finish it for you but the disadvantage to that is it's not always what we know oh I know I know I know I should do this I know I should do that I know I should do that but knowledge alone will never set us free that's right we have to take what we know and apply it to our lives look the prophet said now he says you have to depart out of my presence can you imagine that they heard a tone in God's voice they' never heard it before every day prior to this the prophet just dramatizes it for us and said Papa would come down and say children have you enjoyed your stay on Earth today and they'd say oh papa it's been so wonderful how was everything oh everything was fine it was so wonderful and he said I've come down to kiss you good night so he would lay Adam down in the Garden of Eden and he would lay Eve down at his arm so he'd stretch his arm out maybe something like this and God would lay her down on his arm and papa would reach over I Adam I love you I'll see you tomorrow and Eve say papa you going to kiss me good night come here e good night my children I love you so much you imagine Miss he would step back and the angels of God would look at him and say Papa he looks just like you Papa's heart would race because they had everything they needed in this dispensation of Innocence but now they hear the rais in Papa's voice that they never heard before come out you know people wonder sometimes why that a preacher will maybe have to raise his voice maybe he'll have to even when he's counseling them have to get a little bit Stern with them and have to say things that he doesn't even want to say and the tenor of his voice may have to be in such a way that it actually breaks his heart heart to have to say it but what is it that determines that you and I you see it was not that God wanted to be upset that day God never wanted to have to tell them get out leave do you hear me me I said leave the prophet said when he stole it did he come down before them and he stood there looking at such love and he said I promise you I will bring you back aren't you glad and then God does something so strange he turns and he speaks to the woman to the woman and he promises through her will come forth the Redeemer notice brother Bren goes on to say I can see Eve and Adam their arms around one another moving out like this them old sheep skins flopping against their legs bloody beating brother R claps his hands together I can see that all space which was God which had no beginning of days or ending of years I can see all that great space begin to move together like this coming down to a funnel shape as he be to eye that little couple going down through the garden the bloody skins flopping against their leg he couldn't stand it oh it moved down it moved down the very heart of God and spelled l o v e so here he come in the act of condensation and he founded himself down from all this great space of time and he just kept getting smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller even the very symbol he came in was a sign of reconciliation this is what I must do to get you back I will become from the great Eternal I will come down and embody myself in a body of time Hallelujah and he called them back and said I'm going to put between imity between your seed and Satan's seed this was done at Calvary when God himself came down through a woman born of a Virg virgin now listen how God looked at this human love when God looked down and seen that love of a human being it was so great he couldn't stand it himself I love the Song of Solomon it has been called by the Jews for many Millennium the holy of holies the Song of Solomon the holy of holies they will not allow their children to read it until they're adults because of the contents of the book and one of my favorite verses there is when the bridegroom looks at the bride and he says I have come into my garden and there they are together in this space and she looks at him and when she does he says oh my sister my fair one my undefiled turn your eye away from me for your ey has caught me and the word that Solomon used there in the Hebrew it's it's it's a phenomenal word it's that the word that he chose to use caught me when I looked at your eye you captured me I have no will to resist you oh children I know I know we want to go to heaven so bad we long for the Rapture every day don't we but that's only half the story yes sir the other half is can you imagine the anticipation that he has for you this morning we know and understand by the teaching of the scriptures and of the message of the hour that when the saints of God pass beyond this life and go into the sixth Dimension they actually do not go into the seventh where God is Paul has never yet seen the Lord Jesus Peter did not go directly into where Jesus was nor did Brother randam no do any of the same of this day but they're under the altar or as he calls it in the sixth Dimension there they are waiting it would be Unbecoming for them to see him as he's still acting out the part of the mediatorial work in the office of high priest that's right right so when his bride sees him we will all see him at once when Paul catches his first glimpse of the King it'll be the same time you see him and we all will gather there together and stand before him Hallelujah not as a high priest but as our great resurrected king of kings and Lord of lords look at how God tried to relate to this love it was so great that he couldn't stand it himself and he said I'll come yeah and go to now you know what Adam did God had made man on the sixth day of his creation so he was the finale of God's work then God s Sanctified and hallowed the seventh day which was 7,000 or Thousand Years God entered into his millennium right when Adam was placed in the Garden of Eden and Adam's sin called God out of his Millennium and God stopped it don't you understand why we cannot jump from the sixth Dimension and go straight into the Eighth Day the Millennium must be lived out yes it has never yet been lived out but it will be I said it will be so God simply put it on hold the fall of Man called God out of his Millennium now in the Millennium of course Ezekiel 44-48 the temple will be rebuilt it will be all there for Memorial and all that you've read it I know and I know brother Tim has telling to you many times but in the seventh day the Heathen which has never heard the gospel will be raised not people that's heard it and turned it down and get a second chance only those who's never heard it remember Psalm whenever he said sit thou at my right hand until I make thine enemies thy foot stol and it will be there of course that the Prophecies of Isaiah of Zachariah and many of the Messianic prophecies I'm under the reign of the son of David in the Millennium will be lived out upon the thy Throne God told David by the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy Throne there we will reign in glorified bodies that will be the other people living on the earth in human bodies can you imagine they will live for a thousand years and at the end of that Thousand Years there's no devil there is no devil Bound by a chain of circumstance there's no demons infiltrating people's minds there's no cigarettes there's no drinking there's no Honky Tonks there's no bars there's no televisions there's no vow there's nothing there and at the end of that Thousand Years them people will make up their mind they hate Jesus Christ can you imagine living on the earth with people and glorified bodies so if you decide you want to go on the other side of the earth you think about it and go you're gone they see you disappear they see you you've not aged one day you're there in Eternal bodies and they've lived under this domain and remember if they don't come up at the Feast of Tabernacles to worship the sons of God in full manifestation of adoption they will not allow any rain on their crops God's really picky about us going to church sir he's going to be pretty picky about it in the Millennium so if folks don't go to church in the Millennium them people that's living outside there if they don't go to church the sons of God will be the magistrates and and then the governors over the Earth and God will relate to them you know our son go over there and tell them people in Babylon they wouldn't a church last Feast of Tabernacles tell them because of that they're not going to get no rain for a while that's what your Bible says now why because God wants to fulfill every word well why not jump just from the church e on over to the A day no he's perfect in all of his promises and remember we must be dressed in the proper attire as I stood there yesterday beside your pastor and I watched each one of the the groomsmen come in and I watched the Bridesmaids and the little girls and how cute they all were but there's one thing I noticed and those of you that were there and you've noticed it as well and other weddings that you've seen that was only one beautiful young lady that had on the wedding garment there were friends there were families there was preachers there was all types of other people the wedding coordinator so on and so on and so on but only one young lady had on oh Hallelujah there's churches churches Brides brides churches churches Brides but there must come one that has both mechanics and Dynamics oh there's many that have attended church today in different parts of the world and the Earth and they'll say oh we're the Church of the Living God we the bride show us the clothes you wear we'll tell you if you're the bride or not I ain't talking about now just the natural clothes I'm talking about the spiritual CLA of the word and remember the attire changed in every age so God would send a certain messenger and say this is the cause of the word that messenger would put together what God wanted the people to be clothed in in that hour but in the last days the seventh angel didn't have a certain message but he was to gather all the Loose Ends the ends of Luther the ends of Wesley the ends of Pentecost is that right why he's making a special garment for that resurrected bride because Paul can have no Resurrection if God don't complete a bride in this age I know you already know it but I'm here just to remind you of things that you already know but let me just remind you the Lord God is Not anxious he's not nervous he's not worried about the bride not being ready as a matter of fact he knows she will be there's not enough devils in Hell the devil ain't got enough power there's not enough smoking there ain't enough drinking there ain't enough alcohol there ain't enough lying it will come to pass last because Almighty God's reputation is at hand St if God don't produce a bride that'll be able to call forth the resurrection of tens of millions of saints of God God's reputation will be ruined yes sirl but don't worry I'll tell you how worried the Lord is about this he said it 2,000 years ago let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me for in my father's house are many mansions or Tabernacles if it were not so I would have told you I go away to prepare a place for you and if I go away to prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also now he's really concerned is he he's really tore up afraid that the powers is going to get so bad uhuh no that's exact opposite you remember when the children of Israel was right up to the brink of going over in the land and they saw all the cities and they saw all the things that went on little did they know years later whenever Rahab was told that the the children of Israel was coming in and they'd sent some Messengers down there and Rahab begin to testify of what they had heard 40 years ago and you know what it was they was terrified of the children of Israel they were scared to death but remember the prophet said the the Devil's weapon against you listen to this his weapon against you is to get you to doubt your weapon it's not like he's got a great big armor in he's got all this great power and he's got all this no he has one simple thing to give get you to doubt your weapon he don't have to have power he does not have to have a lot of weapons all he has to have is doubt and whenever we look at our circumstances and things that are around us and we say oh no how am I going to get through this how is this going to happen how is that going to happen I don't have a clue how it's all going to happen but we serve a God that can make whatever needs to happen happen and there's things no doubt that you and I think needs to happen this way and that way God said no you got it all wrong and I've just come to a spot I realized Lord I don't know how it's supposed to work I don't know how a lot of these things are going to be that I just commit myself to you you're the one who orchestrated this plan I'm just playing this real real tiny tiny part but aren't you glad you're a part this morning I'm so glad saints that by the grace of God the Lord Jesus has called us himself we were not called by brother brandom you were not called by your pastor you were not called by some other great Minister but the Lord God himself called your [Applause] name Hallelujah notice Joseph in Genesis 414 then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon he shaved himself and changed his reignment and came unto pharaoh Genesis 41:42 and Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it on Joseph's hand and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen and put a gold chain about his neck you see the changing of the clothes is a significance of changing positions now no doubt the prison clothes that he wore was very fitting for where he was but they would not match his new position now in reality when you look at it really what Lea has on it matches where she is but it don't match a son or daughter of God it will never produce the clo that is fittting for the Bride of Jesus Christ that's why we had to come out ruths chapter 3 verse two and now is not Boaz our Kindred with whose maidens thou was behold he went with barley tonight in the threshing floor wash thyself therefore and anoint thee and put thy reignment upon thee and get thee down to the FL but make not thyself known unto the man un he have done eating and drinking now remember she had on clothes that was very suited to her position and it was clothes of widowhood so she was a widow so when you looked at her you would know them whenever she come from the land of Moab she would have on these widow's clothes so every person knew okay this woman is a widow her husband has got killed she her husband has passed away but notice her mother-in-law and they only well trained in the word and she was getting her to this point why she's going to leave her to marriage what's she telling her go down and whenever you get that don't make yourself known well mother should I wear these clothes no take off your black hat take off your Veil take off your black clothes you know it's a sad thing to realize that many of the folks have come to the message but they've still gone on their old clothes of widowhood and they're not acting like a newly married bride of Jesus Christ but still acting like were servants out of there you remember the children of Israel come out of the land of Egypt and God had a much easier time of bringing them out of Egypt than he did getting Egypt out of them and we come out from under the slavery and the bondage of the world but have we got that slavery and bondage out of us come on somebody I ain't talking about free to sin I'm talking about free to live right free to walk in a place oh you imagine if Abraham would have been here this morning can you imagine if little little David would attended this service the deacons would done had to carry him out probably 27 times hit him in shouting and a running and a jumping David just by the law David said I love thy law better than my necessary food oh he said is sweet as honeycomb the law Thou shalt not Thou shalt not Thou shalt not oh if he would have been here this morning and evening light you folks would have been ashamed probably he'd have been up and around and around glory to God glory to God somebody give me my heart the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he makes me to lie down and G pastor and David would have been over there and up there and out there and back there oh Hallelujah why because he loved the Lord so much and just had on a garment of Thou shalt not and thou shalt not young man if David would have had your hope Holy Ghost and you imagine he danced and shouted and rejoiced so Ruth had to remove her clothes of widowhood look at Esther chapter 5 verse one now it came to pass on the third day that Esther put on her royal apparel why she's dressing for the occasion amen I don't know about you I get sick and tired of being sick and tired I get so sick and tired of God's people being sick and beat down and you know not living an overcoming life I do not believe that the Lord Jesus wants us to close out this age barely hanging on from one service to another I believe in Repentance I thank God for it I thank God for the blood that's there whenever we make a mistake but I believe that there is another sphere in God that a child of God can live so close to the presence of God that the devil don't even know what to do with you that is a direct quote so I I I just thank God for all of that but I believe we can live in a a presence of the Lord Jesus that Satan is scared of you when you get up in the morning and your feet touch the floor and them Devils go to running right and left oh Lord here they come here they come they live through another night I'll tell you one thing if I go by the way of the grave and I die and Y all come to see me or hear brother Tim preach my funeral whoever I hope not only if I got a witness in heaven but I hope down in hell then devils are a running and a screaming and a holling hallelujah hallelujah he's dead cuz I believe I was born to torment the devil I was born to cast out Devils I was born Hallelujah to be an overcomer in this age I was born to we the garments of loyalty not only I but you were and you were and you were were born to be dressed in the CL of the word of this day and when you come in demons begin to [Applause] tremble but it's not just you it's your clothes that's right it's your clothes you see clothes can reflect true prophecy or false you remember St Martin the church has messenger whenever the devil appeared before him he said Martin I'm your lord Jesus worship me remember he had a crown on his head and dressed up like a king all that sort of thing Martin looked at him looked at at him now Martin is judging this by the word Martin don't you know me I'm your Lord and Savior Jesus Christ but he looks at him and looks at him he said Satan get out of here you got a crown on your head and he ain't got one yet but the Saints are going to crown him so clothes can prophesy against you or they can prophesy for you now it's much easier sometimes for people to come to a message church and you know they get rid of this out of their closet and that out of their closet and they start wearing dresses if they're women letting their hair grow out and if they're men hopefully they never did wear dresses but you never know this day but anyway they start looking Godly too but sometimes it's the clothes on the inside that can take years and years to ever get rid of bitterness and grudges and envy and strife Amen brother Donnie you see the Lord wants us to have on on the reflection of the outside what is already been clothed in the soul from the inside oh my so notice Now esther is going before the king she's not given a direct invitation which is deaths to do so that's right so you reckon she got up at morning said well I'm going to go see the king and her rollers is still in her hair and she's got on her old wore out house shoes she's got on that old gown that she's had on for 30 years that old house coat where you going going to see the king I'm his wife Hallelujah I'm the bride I'm married her I'm she knew not only her position but she must be clothed not only with dignity but humility imagine when she comes out and she just alls the people is say look at her I imagine she has on this beautiful beautiful dress and this you know stick in her hand and well G to God how you doing old King I want to talk to you buddy you got a little time for me I'm your wifey imagine every step it was a step of royalty she knew who she was and her clothes matched her opinion that's why when you get on your knees to pray if you approach it right the devil will try to talk you out of praying and it ain't no wonder ain't no wonder he don't want you to pray if I was a devil I wouldn't want you to pray neither you imagine the angels of God are hushed in heaven when you get on your knees to pray and your'll fight sleep and you'll fight this and that and the other when you go to pray it ain't no wonder the queen is approaching her King this is why the prophet tells us when we pray we should offer a little bit of worship we're priest right and we should offer a little bit of worship and we enter into his courts with praise and thanksgiving then we come and we make our petition known and it was so when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court now remember it was not what she said yet but when he saw her I don't you understand if she would have come with her house clothes on and her slippers and all that sort of thing it would have been such reproach are you kidding me you disgrace me this way I wonder how sometimes our father feels when we go before him and we're like Beggars I'm not worthy I'm not worthy oh God I I'm not worthy I'm not good enough Lord here here I am again I I hate to even bother you I hate to even trouble you got so many you got so many more important people to deal with where'd you get that idea there ain't nobody any more important than you are you're a son and daughter of God on that Plateau we all stand at the same level brother Tim ain't more of a Son of God than I am I ain't more of a Son of God than any one of you Brothers here today our position and all that yes yes that's different but when we approach the Lord Jesus we stand right there with the same Robes of dignity and honor and whenever we call out upon his name we are a spiritual priesthood for he has made us Kings and Priests unto our God and we shall reign on the earth sisters in the Old Testament only men could be priests but the Lord God made a special inclusion in this new covenant because not only are the brothers priests but the sisters stand right there and you can grab a hold oh Hallelujah of your position as a daughter of God and be able to pray oh my and watch God Shake hell at the prayer of a daughter of God you remember whenever the woman had a baby and there was up in the in the balcony and there was a little woman sitting there and this woman was walking back and forth and back and forth and the baby was crying and brother Brown was meeting and she said here honey you take my chair you take it oh thank you sister thank you and she said honey I just keep feeling this in my heart could could I pray for your baby I know you got a prayer card and you on my little prayer wouldn't be nothing but could I pray for you anyway and she said sure honey you pray for her and the woman come down later you remember the story come down later in the Prine brother said that baby is already healed that woman right up there in that balcony God heard her prayer and he said why would God do it being a mother she could have a feeling of compassion that maybe brother brandom couldn't I want wonder I wonder sometimes if the trials and the tests and the things that we go through that if God is Not preparing us to be able to enter into a greater place as priests I've always hated cancer cancer took my mama cancer took my grandmother but I've got a new reason to hate it now cancer my baby girl figh oh no the devil couldn't take her I'm the God was done with and I thank you all for every prayer that you pray that I've got more of a hatred now for that devil that I've ever had in my entire life cancer has Afflicted one of my brothers brother Ron Spencer and I hate that devil amen when people come up for prayer I've got something there brother de that I didn't have before I've got something there what did it do it dressed me more fitting it dressed me in a way where I can meet this enemy it's the same with your trials and your test don't let Satan beat you down with them but realize God is molding you Esther God is molding you why for such a time so put on your word garments and take those prayer requests with your broken heart I remember hearing brother random say it years and years ago and it puzzled me when he said God you have broken my heart time and time again but I thank you for it you remember this little baby laying there dying her eyes Crossing the devil no doubt rejoiced and laughed but he didn't laugh when one after another after another cross-side babies would come across that platform and not a one of them walk away without being healed God was closing his Prophet with something in the cost of his word there's something about suffering there's something about it being woven in our garments are Divine but they are human as well are they not in this attire that we wear as the elect of God we are are so privileged to be able to sit in Heavenly places in him and hear things that no other age has been able to hear but on the contrast side of that we will be tried sometimes to such a place it seemed like the heavens have shut themselves said my God won't even hear you no more but it's only part of the woven tapestry that will come together to make the cost of the word for was there air of people that was ever tried like him remember you're reflected by the antitype of the beaten golden Candlestick that your life will be so beaten my little brother sitting behind me here how many trials and tests has he been through would he have ever thought the Lord would have taken away his Queen and he would have to go through how many ever months years that it'll be of this journey without her by his side there's things about the will of God that are frightening there's things about the will of God we will never understand but I learned a long time ago even when I don't understand I still trust him understanding is a great thing but there's sometimes understanding is not what we need but we actually need trust Esther's life was on the line you imagine her contemplating this so she' fasted up to this time and they would wear certain clothes dressed for the occasion she would not put on a robe and have a diam and her crown when she's down fasting but get down and sacla and ashes and take the ashes and throw them over them themselves like this so you imagine when they would get up and they were weeping and crying oh I don't I oh I don't I I don't Elohim Elohim Adon and they' take them ashes and throw it all over themselves and it would run down their face and mixed with the sweat and the tears that was on their body but they had on their apprpriate attire what was it a broken Spirit reaching out to God but now she must step into her dressing room she must wash away all the ashes wipe away the tears the persperation of ardan's prayer and dress like a queen in presentation not a queen in morning it must have been quite a transition for her cuz as she stands there feeling I must change I must change God help me how can I get from this mind ET how can I get from this mindset your clothes might help so you lay them aside and you start with the base layer of justification and you put on sanctification true baptism of the Holy Ghost then you go to getting all the adornments you know all the gifts and the specialities of the attire and then you look in the mirror and you say daddy is that me is that truly me because a while ago you looked in the mirror and you saw a Broken Man a broken woman your countenance was so fallen and you were so sad but now you step back in front of the mirror and you say is that really me I don't know exactly what day of the week it'll be I don't really care I don't know what time it'll be Eastern Central Pacific New Zealand time I don't really care about that either but one of these days we will start to see our loved ones appear before us I've been in Johnson City now for many years one of the sisters deacons wives always kept a record of how many funerals I've preached since I've been there 144 I think it is Carol 144 people I've buried it's pretty good sized Church ain't it since I've been there so on that Resurrection morning I got plans for a big visitation Hallelujah notice what she's doing she's dressing in a way that will please her husband and bear the dignity and honor that he himself expresses from his position she wants to match him praise God look at Mark chapter 1 verse 6 and John was clothed with camel's hair and a girdle of skin about his loins and did eat Locust and wild honey you can tell John wasn't going to a wedding he's going to a thrashing I mean he's a sword slanging head chopped off profit he's fixing to Flay them he's fixing to cut him down and he's dressed for the occasion it wouldn't have been fitting for him to walk out in a suit like I have on today or any of these other brothers here it would have not been becoming at all it would have not been becoming for him in his diet to pulled up through McDonald's and ordered you know whatever your favorite thing is and your latte you know all them things that y'all drink it would have not been fitting he had a crude diet for a crude man preaching a crude message to A Lost Generation but it was so fitting for what God chose for the hour notice in Luke chap 2: 7 birth of Jesus and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a Manger because there was no room for him in the end what was it clothes fit for the occasion so it was wasn't born in a Marriott he was not born in an InterContinental hotel but he was born and laid in a Manger so his attire was very fitting for the Lamb of God is that right notice that he himself dresses to match the occasion keep that in mind Mark chapter 9:2 and after six days Jesus take us with him Peter and James and John and leads them into a high mountain apart by themselves and he was transfigured before them the word transfigured means to transform to changed into another form Christ's appearance was changed and was with resplendant is the word there resplendant with Divine brightness on the Mount of transfiguration now notice he's fixing to typify the great Rapture and the resurrection so the swaddling cloth would not be the proper attire for him to wear on that Transfiguration now no doubt he walked up there with that one piece woven garment that he wore for many many years of his life and whenever he walked up there it was perfectly fitting for a humble lowly servant of God but even God would not allow him to stand there in the type until his garments had been changed to match the occasion now if the Lord Jesus could not stand there with his old garments on what convinces us we can stand there with ours on we will not be able to do it so he himself had to be changed into Oh Glory an an outfit that would match the occasion is that right so he was transfigured or changed and it was him receiving of course the placing of a son and his reignment did Shine and the glory of God was upon him now the verb there that that uh that Mark used whenever he wrote that was metamorph which denotes a transformation of the essential form proceeding from within and it's the same word that Paul uses in the Book of Romans I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holding acceptable unto the Lord which is only your reasonable service being not conformed to this world but be ye transformed metamorph so we are to be transformed where not from the outside in from the inside out and if you've got the right thing on the inside it brings this outside subject to the word of God now remember your body is like them people that live in the Millennium it ain't got the Holy Ghost and it never will get the Holy Ghost but the spirit of God inside of us makes this old man right here go to church that's right yes that's right my soul wants to worship God but my soul ain't got a mouse my soul wants to praise God but my soul Ain't Got No Hands my soul every now and then wants to dance but my soul ain't got no feet so you know what my soul tells my body give me yourself but I don't want to dance I don't want to praise God I said give me yourself and shut up and do what I tell you to do I want to clap hands this morning what am I going to do all right then my soul is the control to oh I wish somebody would preach with me this morning you see my clothes in my soul is making my body obey and it shows that I'm truly going in the Rapture and whenever I act it out by the grace of God I get a little bit of touch of my new outfit praise the Lord praise the Lord amen this is why we believe in miracles this is why we believe in Healing The Sick every time we see somebody heal it is a little bit of a down payment of the Resurrection we see the Lord doing in a moment of time what he's fixing to do to all of [Applause] us hallelujah one of our Deacon Brothers come up just for last service when I was there at the church been having a pinched nerve up here on the top of his head right out there in the lower party below the bend the stem of his brain there couldn't move his head excruciating pain been to the doctor all they don't know what they're going to do this at the other myself and the other minister Brothers laid hands on him oh my the charge of the Holy Ghost run right down through there he text me the next day said brother Donnie it's absolutely every Speck of it is totally gone he said I couldn't even move I couldn't beend my head what was it it was a down payment of what we're all fixing to experience praise the Lord what was it something my clothing come out my clothing come out and run through my hands his clothing come out and believe the word the clothing of those ministers come out and run through their hands and the spirit of God used our hands to perform a great Supernatural [Applause] [Music] move Oh Glory to God so the Lord Jesus put on a robe of immortality and stepped into it and they looked at him Peter James and John they said there's Moses and Elijah now I want to ask you one question how did they know that there was no pictures of Moses there was no pictures of Elijah it's not like they had it on their iPhone every day and you know every day they get up you know memories of yesterday and memories of 2500 years ago how did they know it them three standing on the mountain so impacted them dressed in immortality it gave them a foresight of what it's going to be on that day that we will know as we are known that's Hallelujah 2 Corinthians chapter 3 Verse 18 let's read there if you would but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord praise God mark 9:3 his reignment became shining exceeding white as snow so as no Fuller on Earth can whiten Revelation 101 and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven you say it with me clothes ah well this Lord Jesus is a man of many costumes in it swaddling cloth glorified body and the here we see him introducing our time Hallelujah and what's he got on this time clothed with a cloud isn't it amazing that John does not pluralize that and say there was clouds everywhere but it was one Cloud closed with a cloud I know you've seen that picture him with his wig on haven't you I'm sure you've looked at it many many times and I'm sure you've noticed that whenever it's turned the right way his head is looking down on the Earth wonder what he's looking for the rest of his body what's he looking for the rest of his body what's his ministry in US looking for the rest of his body we're not here to build a kingdom we're not here to build you know something for for us ministers we're not here for that we are here looking for that last one so we can go home we're here looking for his body that's the anointing all the anointing you know of Kingdom Builders is totally different from that it's all about them and their Ministry and so on and so on and so on but the real move of God what is it about it's about getting that last one in getting them filled with the Holy Ghost getting them to their position in Christ Jesus so we can leave this world Hallelujah and the devil can have it I said the devil can have it I don't know about you I'm looking for the coming of the Lord more than I've ever in my entire life I want to leave this place it's unfitted place for us to live it's ungodly it's Unholy it's unclean it's filthy it's not conducive for my beautiful pure white clothes so can you imagine here you're dressed in these beautiful glistening Gard gments and everywhere's around you is black smudy fils you can't already go through a Walmart checkout with being insulted by pictures on a magazine or some woman standing there everywhere you can't even go to the grocery store and buy your groceries without them playing rock and roll music I've never understood what does bacon have to do with rock and roll what in the world of SpaghettiOs and cereal what in the world don't you understand it's invading it's invading it's clothing them their music is preparing them it's closing them just as ours is helping clothe us I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with the cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire Revelation 19:13 now watch him again now he's going to come dress like something totally different in Revelation 10 he was clothed with a vesture dipping blood and his name is called the word of God uhoh and the armies plural which were in heaven followed him upon white horses now look how they're dressed look at the significance of John seeing what clothes he had on and what they had on now you see the marriage supper has done took place so we're not all sitting around the reception oh don't you long for that Carol and I left the wedding practice the other day after we had ate and everybody was standing up and telling the different things you know about the bride and the groom and all that I started going out to my vehicle I just started crying I'm a baby you see I just started crying I told her she what what's the matter I said I just got to thinking wonder what it would be like when we all sat at that great table that day and we going talking about the different things how we overcome we reach across the table and I'll grab a hold of your hand and you'll grab a hold of mine we'll both be the same age and then all of a sudden the door opens and here he comes and he walks out the king and he's great splendor and they start up at the head of the table and come down through there and each one of them gets their time and they go look it up at him what you going to say how you going to feel when you get your time and he may lay his hand over on your shoulder and call you by your real word name and you're sitting there and tears running out your eyes Jesus Jesus I love you I love you being so good to me Donnie whatever my name is Donnie don't cry no more he reaches down and grabs a hold of his robe and said that's all right don't cry no more it's all over now friends we won't be sitting at the table if we're not closed with the right Clos maybe the very last person at the end of that Thousand Miles well on down the end maybe I'll be sitting there I don't care what I say to you I don't care I don't care I just want to match his clothes I'll be so United with him that he will take part of his clothes why wouldn't he why wouldn't he CU I'd become clothed in his righteousness so he's not going to bring a hand time he's not going to have one of the angels to go back in the bathroom somewhere you know and bring out a wash towel and something like that and say you know bring everybody kleenexes please hand out the kleenexes it'll be his own garments why shouldn't you feel his garments I felt his presence since I was a little boy he spoke my name before I was born I had an aunt that was a Christian loved the Lord spoke in tongues and interpreted he was carrying a baby the interpretation was Donnie Lee will do many great things in my name of course she thought she was going to have a boy she had a girl named her Ronda Lee couple years later my mom and daddy conceived she kept it in her heart for years and years whenever I was born she told my mama my mom and daddy wasn't Christian wasn't serving the lord my mama held it in her heart and I got saved at the age of 12 my mother's mother my grandmother bought me a Bible it big a tiny Bible I still got it gave it to me have my name put in it she said I hope I'm alive to hear you preach your first sermon I ain't going to be no preacher I ain't going to be no preacher I have to say that kind of that kind of does something to me that he knew my name but I'm going to tell you something you knew yours too nobody might ever spoken tongues or interpreted or prophesied but he knows your name just as well as he knows any of the prophets the armies of Heaven closed with fine linen you see the Jewish trolls on read a little bit history no close in Christ time the families of the bride and the groom would meet with some Elders there as Witnesses the young man would give the young woman either a gold ring or some article of value simply sometimes a document which will be a promise to marry her so as job said in job 29:14 I put on righteous and it clothed me my judgment was a robe and a diadem Paul in Romans 13:14 said but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ I'm sure you've looked at this brother Tim I love this word it's in uo which means to be clothed in to sink into clothing so put on the Lord Jesus Christ and you actually sink in into clothing and your clothes is the Lord Jesus that's why Paul would say in Thessalonians I pray your whole Spirit soul and body be preserved blameless to the day of Jesus Christ don't you appreciate him notice in Samuel Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him and gave it to David and his garments he gave to David and even his sword and his bow and his girdle so David was seen wearing Jonathan's clothes so he was Jonathan by representation praise be to God and then Jonathan put on David's clothes for he who knew no sin became sin that we might become the righteousness of God in him let me close there was an old brother brother Tim that I knew in Pentecost and he his name was brother Moran he was a preacher preached for many many years every time this brother would get up either to testify or to preach he'd take his right hand and he'd stand there like this whether he was just testifying or whether he would preach and he would rub like that so I asked him I was just a young guy so I asked him I asked my uncle about it was was the pastor first he said he kind of told me the story he said Donnie ask him let him tell you about it so this man when he was younger he had a dream and in this dream he walked up before the Lord it was a dream and everything about him was glistening white except for one spot right there in his trousers near his pocket almost a perfect arms length and he hadn't even noticed it till he got into the presence of that light and he walked into the presence of that light and he looked down and he saw that and he took his hand and tried to hide it so even when he would preach he would get up as a reminder just to remind him you don't want no spots can we bow our heads this morning hallelujah praise the Lord Jesus praise the Lord Jesus I wonder how many here today you just said brother Donnie with all my heart I want to be clothed in his righteousness just raise your hand to the Lord there maybe you know of a spot maybe you know of something there in your life that you needed to be taken care of today just let the presence of God meet you I know it's a great challenge in this day because everywhere we look around us it's all the darkness and the filth of the world if your soul is sealed today in the presence of God Satan can never never get the that soul but if he can affect your spirit and you pick up things in your spirit or your attitude or you pick up things in the flesh that Grieves the spirit of God oh God will correct you and he'll straighten you out but just affects your walk with the Lord and your fellowship with the Lord and the rest of you may be here today say Lord I don't want nothing in my w I raise my hands to you you Lord Jesus hallelujah hallelujah heavenly father as we bow our heads Lord Jesus I know this might seem an unusual sermon to bring today but it's what you placed upon my heart father we know Lord that we under an onslaught every day of Our Lives I cannot imagine what the young people here at this assembly what they face so much more than I went through as just a young Christian I suffered persecution went through a lot of things going to school I was laughed at and made fun of and ridiculed but I cannot imagine what they have to deal with in this day help them Jesus you're not only going to have adults and older men like brother Tim and myself and people in the 30s and 40s but you're going to have teenagers you're going to have young married couples in their 20s they're going to walk before you with a holy life Lord Jesus help each of us God I pray you to help me I can't say I understand it Lord but I've seen it in my years that many men they walk pretty straight seemingly 20s 30s 40s 50s and then when they turn older that's when they go to getting off either doctrinally or picking up things keep me true Jesus I remember the first time I heard that song saying it was years ago when I came down to preach for brother Tim and he sung that song Keep Me true Lord Jesus Keep Me true that's the way we feel today Father I don't want no spot on my garment I want to be dressed in Purity a white robe clean and white father oh Jesus May every young man every young woman every boy every girl even those that have
