[30:47] so lord we just ask these things this
[30:49] morning for your honor for your glory
[30:52] just in jesus name
[30:54] amen if you have your bibles this
[30:55] morning we're going to look here in
[30:56] first kings 18.
[31:00] first kings 18 and verse 36.
[31:06] hey man it's good to be back in the
[31:08] house of the lord with you we're not
[31:09] able to be here wednesday night we were
[31:11] not feeling well at home but we did
[31:13] stream in and
[31:14] you know brother timothy poured his
[31:16] heart out the healer hasn't lost his
[31:18] touch
[31:19] and i believe he's still going by still
[31:21] the healing angel still visits your
[31:24] address he knows exactly where you live
[31:26] he knows exactly what you're going
[31:27] through and he knows exactly when to
[31:30] heal
[31:31] i was listening to a sermon yesterday i
[31:33] believe it was in testimony in 1959 just
[31:35] a short little cap of a message brother
[31:37] man i'm talking about the the little
[31:39] black girl there who was blind i believe
[31:40] it was in in arkansas and
[31:42] he's she told her she said you show me
[31:45] where that healer is i'll find my own
[31:47] daddy
[31:48] well she didn't realize she was right in
[31:50] the place of the healer he was right
[31:52] there and she said he grabbed a hold of
[31:54] her or his lapel and wouldn't let him go
[31:56] that's the way we need to be this
[31:57] morning with god
[32:00] grab ahold and don't let them go but we
[32:01] find here in the scripture that came to
[32:03] pass at the time of the offering of the
[32:05] evening service
[32:06] that elijah the prophet came near and he
[32:08] said
[32:09] and said lord god of abraham isaac and
[32:12] of israel let it be known this day that
[32:14] thou art god in israel
[32:16] and that i am thy servant and i have
[32:18] done all these things at that word
[32:21] hear me o lord hear me that this people
[32:24] may know that thou art the lord god and
[32:25] that thou hast turn their heart back
[32:28] again
[32:28] then the fire of the lord fell and
[32:30] consumed the burnt sacrifice and the
[32:32] wood and the stones and the dust and he
[32:34] licked up the water that was in the
[32:36] trench and when all the people saw it
[32:38] they fell on their faces and they said
[32:41] the lord he is god the lord
[32:45] is god
[32:46] and elijah said unto them take the
[32:48] prophet to baal let not none of them
[32:50] escape and they took them and elijah
[32:53] brought them down to the book of kishan
[32:55] and he slew them there
[32:57] go to chapter 19 and verse 1.
[33:08] and they have told jezebel all that
[33:10] elijah had done and with all how
[33:13] he had slain all the prophets with the
[33:15] sword
[33:17] and jezebel sent
[33:18] a messenger
[33:20] unto elijah saying
[33:23] let the gods excuse me real quick let me
[33:25] get this fixed
[33:29] god's due to me and more also if i make
[33:31] not thy life as the life of one of those
[33:33] them by tomorrow about this time and
[33:35] when he saw that he arose and he went
[33:37] for his life and he came to bresheba
[33:39] which belongs to judah and he left his
[33:41] servant there but he himself went a
[33:43] day's journey into the wilderness and
[33:45] came and sat down under a juniper tree
[33:48] and he requested for himself that he
[33:49] might die and he said is it enough now
[33:52] oh lord take my life for i am not better
[33:55] than my father's and as he lay and he
[33:57] slept under the juniper tree of the
[34:00] juniper tree behold there an angel
[34:02] touched him and said unto him arise and
[34:04] eat and he looked and behold there was a
[34:06] cake bacon of coals and a cruise of
[34:08] water at his head and he did eat and
[34:10] drank and he laid him down again and the
[34:12] angel of the lord came again the second
[34:15] time and touched him and said arise and
[34:17] eat because a journey is too great for
[34:19] thee and he arose and he did eat and he
[34:21] went
[34:22] in the strength of the meat forty days
[34:24] and forty nights unto horeb the mount of
[34:27] god you can have your seats this morning
[34:31] so we find here
[34:32] the story of elijah and no doubt we look
[34:35] in first kings 17 first kings 18 and we
[34:39] find some pretty miraculous episodes or
[34:42] situations that took place
[34:44] and
[34:45] you know we find when we started our
[34:47] reading elijah was on mount carmel if
[34:49] you could cut me down just a little bit
[34:50] i'm extremely hot up here
[34:52] uh
[34:53] he was on a mount carmel but yet he
[34:55] finds himself on a juniper tree he finds
[34:57] himself wandering through a desert he
[34:59] finds himself in a cave and like elijah
[35:02] many of us our lives have the same
[35:04] situation it goes through the same
[35:06] cycles
[35:07] we have mountain top experiences we have
[35:10] juniper tree experiences we have desert
[35:12] wandering experiences we find ourselves
[35:15] thankfully in a cave where the voice of
[35:17] the lord can speak to us brother
[35:19] brethren would tell us and what does
[35:20] thou hear he said now pastors here know
[35:22] other ministers
[35:23] watch
[35:25] after your mount carmel's you're going
[35:26] to have a juniper tree
[35:30] after your mount carmels you're going to
[35:32] have a juniper tree whenever a man has a
[35:34] blessing and the power god pours down
[35:37] and does something for you look out
[35:39] satan's on the track
[35:42] just remember the next day the monday
[35:44] after a good day of sunday it's gonna be
[35:46] a hard thing because he's gonna do
[35:48] everything he can to knock that
[35:51] confidence out of you that the holy
[35:53] spirit instilled in you the day before
[35:58] i might have a little bit voice
[36:00] struggles because i've been sick this
[36:01] week so
[36:04] we're gonna find that happy medium here
[36:06] in just a minute but see
[36:08] that's not it
[36:15] amen we're going to get there we got new
[36:17] mics we're good
[36:19] but we find satan's going to do
[36:20] everything he can to knock the
[36:23] confidence that god has instilled in you
[36:26] the day before
[36:28] but i want you to know god still has
[36:30] confidence in you
[36:32] and even when you don't have confidence
[36:34] in yourself god has confidence in you
[36:37] god has confidence in what he's placed
[36:39] in you he has confidence in what he's
[36:41] deposited in you he has comment because
[36:43] this is not the work of a man but this
[36:46] is the work of god and there's not
[36:48] enough demons there are not enough
[36:50] struggles there are not enough trials
[36:52] that can defeat you that can defeat the
[36:54] plan of god that can defeat the purpose
[36:56] of god god has confidence in his seed
[37:02] job faced some hardships lost his family
[37:04] lost his wealth lost all these things
[37:07] but brother branham would tell us job
[37:09] only had one way and that's through
[37:11] fellowship through the shedding of the
[37:14] blood he talked to god he knowed that he
[37:18] was and god had confidence in job
[37:21] because he had fellowship with job
[37:25] you want god to have confidence in you
[37:27] then develop a relationship with god
[37:29] have fellowship with god give god more
[37:32] than a two-minute prayer give god your
[37:34] all
[37:37] god had confidence in job because job
[37:39] had a relationship and a fellowship and
[37:42] he said now may the branham tabernacle
[37:44] see that today the only way god can have
[37:47] confidence in you is not because you do
[37:50] something
[37:51] or not because faith to do something but
[37:54] it's when you have fellowship
[37:58] so let me just say this this morning
[38:01] maybe you're not on a mountaintop but it
[38:03] doesn't mean that god doesn't have
[38:04] confidence in you
[38:06] maybe you're at your breaking point but
[38:08] that doesn't mean that god doesn't have
[38:10] confidence in you
[38:11] see god has confidence in the faith seed
[38:15] that he deposited in you before the
[38:18] foundation of the world
[38:20] see that deposit that he made in you
[38:22] will outlast anything that you face here
[38:24] on earth
[38:25] that deposit that he made in you is
[38:27] stronger than any demon power that's
[38:29] trying to destroy your life that deposit
[38:31] that he made in you will conquer any
[38:33] situation that's trying to conquer you
[38:35] this morning god has confidence not only
[38:38] in you but in the seed that he deposited
[38:41] in you
[38:44] and what shall separate us
[38:46] shall trial persecution tribulation
[38:50] nothing can separate us from the love of
[38:52] god
[38:54] so but when we have fellowship with god
[38:57] when we have fellowship then we know
[38:59] that we're predestinated
[39:01] we know that we've been adopted and we
[39:03] find here in ephesians 1 and verse 5
[39:06] having predestinated us unto the
[39:09] adoption of children by jesus christ to
[39:11] himself
[39:12] according to the good pleasure of his
[39:15] will notice god has a will god has a
[39:17] plan and god has a way
[39:21] and you're here this morning because of
[39:23] god's will god's plan in god's way
[39:27] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[39:29] where he has made us
[39:32] how many can say i've been made accepted
[39:35] he has made me accepted in the beloved
[39:38] yet one day i was going contrary to the
[39:41] move of god or to the plan of god but
[39:43] yet god saw something inside of me god
[39:46] looked beyond my failures god looked
[39:48] beyond my sin god looked beyond my flaws
[39:51] and god saw the deposit and he said i'm
[39:54] gonna make sure on that deposit i'm
[39:56] about to get benefits i'm about to reap
[39:58] rewards from that deposit
[40:01] and so god forgets to move on that
[40:03] deposit and begin to pull your heart and
[40:05] bring you into a relationship with him
[40:09] what does he do he places you
[40:12] predestinates you unto the adoption of
[40:14] sons
[40:16] and adoption is positionally being
[40:18] placed
[40:20] there ain't a devil in hell can take you
[40:21] out of that place there's not a devil in
[40:24] hell can move you out of that position
[40:26] there ain't a situation that you face
[40:28] can uproot you from where god placed you
[40:32] the bible would say in whom we have
[40:34] redemption verse 7
[40:36] through his blood and forgiveness of sin
[40:38] according to the riches of his grace
[40:40] wherein he had to bound toward us in all
[40:42] wisdom and prudence
[40:43] having made known unto us
[40:45] the mystery of his will according to his
[40:47] good pleasure
[40:49] which he had purposed in himself that in
[40:51] the dispensation of the fullness of
[40:53] times
[40:54] he might gather together in one all
[40:56] things in christ but which are in heaven
[40:58] and which are on earth even in him
[41:01] and whom we also have obtained an
[41:04] inheritance
[41:05] being predestinated according to the
[41:09] purpose
[41:11] god's purpose will never
[41:13] be
[41:13] defeated
[41:15] predestinated according to not your
[41:19] purpose
[41:20] not a denominational purpose
[41:23] not a man's purpose a man's idea but
[41:26] according to the purpose
[41:28] of god of him who worketh all things
[41:31] after the council of his will god knows
[41:35] the intricate details of your life in
[41:38] the things that you go through whether
[41:40] you're here or whether you're here it
[41:42] all plays into the purpose and plan of
[41:44] god
[41:47] but we've been when you have that
[41:48] relationship you know you've been
[41:50] adopted you know you've been
[41:51] positionally placed and i want you to
[41:52] know this morning sometimes we don't
[41:54] feel like sons of god
[41:58] sometimes you don't even feel like
[41:59] you're saved but i want you to know
[42:00] right now we are sons of god
[42:04] because i'm not looking at my failures
[42:06] i'm looking at what the word says and
[42:07] the word says beloved now we are the
[42:10] sons of god right now we are this minute
[42:13] this moment this service no matter what
[42:15] we're facing no matter the sickness in
[42:17] our body no matter what we're going
[42:19] through we are sons of god
[42:21] and in a devil in hell can come against
[42:24] that sonship
[42:25] god calls you god place you and god's
[42:28] anointing you for this moment
[42:32] right now we are sons of god no matter
[42:34] what we're facing no matter what we're
[42:36] going through no matter the sickness no
[42:37] matter the difficulty no matter the
[42:39] situation we
[42:41] are now and have been adopted
[42:44] positionally placed as sons and
[42:46] daughters of god
[42:48] we had the nature of god we had the
[42:51] character of god our conduct matches the
[42:53] father we've been accepted into beloved
[42:56] we have redemption through his blood we
[42:58] have forgiveness of sins he made known
[43:00] unto us the mystery of his will we've
[43:02] obtained an inheritance and we've done
[43:04] all this because why because we have
[43:06] been predestinated according to his will
[43:10] all glory to god this morning so no
[43:12] matter what you're facing you've been
[43:14] predestinated brother rose to the will
[43:16] of god
[43:21] god
[43:22] has confidence in you this morning
[43:24] young people god's got confidence that
[43:26] you're going to rise above the
[43:28] lukewarmness of laodicea
[43:32] god's got competency it's your character
[43:35] your conduct that gives god confidence
[43:38] in you
[43:39] your character and your conduct
[43:42] that gives god's confidence in you
[43:44] that's the reason problem says that's
[43:45] the reason we haven't got a great church
[43:47] marching on today is because god can't
[43:49] find people to put his confidence in
[43:52] the holy spirit keeps saying well
[43:54] they're tearing up here they're breaking
[43:55] up they're doing this they're off on the
[43:57] lines stay with god's word that's god
[44:00] that's true that's the pattern that's
[44:02] the blueprint he says that's the reason
[44:04] the church today got all kind of isms
[44:06] and everything because it don't stay
[44:08] with the word
[44:10] they won't listen to the holy spirit the
[44:12] holy spirit won't testify them
[44:15] another thing but god's word sees but i
[44:17] want you to know
[44:19] there's a bride in the land today
[44:22] there's a bride in the land today that
[44:23] he has confidence in
[44:25] there's a bride in the land today that
[44:27] her conduct pleases him
[44:29] her character matches his she knows what
[44:32] he wants done with the word or she keeps
[44:35] still
[44:36] she has the mind of god she has thus
[44:39] saith the lord in the rising of the son
[44:41] the prophet of god says she is flesh of
[44:43] his flesh bone of his bone life of his
[44:46] life power of his power she is him
[44:52] oh if you'd ever let that revelation
[44:54] strike in your heart she
[44:56] is him i'll tell you no matter what
[44:58] you're facing in life you
[45:01] you're not your own but you're him
[45:03] you're a representation of him no matter
[45:05] what you're going through if you've been
[45:07] out there and you've been hungry for 40
[45:09] days and you've been tempted by the
[45:10] enemy but i want you to know let me tell
[45:12] you he's got a word that says oh the
[45:14] word says this and the word says that
[45:16] keep pointing them back to the word

[46:01] for it god did it and if god put the
[46:03] desire there then there ain't enough

[47:08] there you're always mudded up
[47:12] always off the main roads you're always
[47:14] in and out
[47:15] he said you can't even have confidence
[47:17] in yourself if you're like that we
[47:20] should wash him one minute you're up
[47:22] next minute you're down and i understand
[47:24] we have
[47:25] mountain tops and valleys
[47:27] we're talking about little floundering
[47:28] fish just like this
[47:31] you know you shake somebody's hand
[47:35] i'm like
[47:39] no buddy
[47:40] you need a man up
[47:43] a little
[47:44] flimsy fishy handshake
[47:47] we don't want men and women like that
[47:49] we're christians we're rugged
[47:52] no matter what we face
[47:53] in the face of adversity we stand
[47:56] in the face of sickness when we're all
[47:58] alone we stand and haven't done all
[48:00] those stand we stand we don't give up we
[48:04] don't bend we don't bow we don't break
[48:06] we stand we're christians
[48:09] in the face of the enemy we stand in the
[48:12] face of love to see and we stand in the
[48:14] face of cancer we stand
[48:17] because we're not standing on our own
[48:19] word we're standing on dust saith the
[48:21] lord
[48:21] [Applause]
[48:24] verbum says it was behooven to elijah
[48:27] but coming to elijah the prophet that he
[48:29] made he stand to fulfill the word of god
[48:32] because he know the word of god he says
[48:35] but it's becoming to him in the midst of
[48:37] his trial in the midst of his criticism
[48:40] in the midst of indifference it's
[48:41] becoming to elijah as a prophet to stand
[48:46] to stand or take the stand of god and
[48:48] stand there and it becometh us
[48:51] to fulfill all righteousness
[48:54] the great mighty men foreshadowing this
[48:56] day when jezebel religions and things is
[48:58] raising up now things that we have have
[49:00] today trying to take over it's becoming
[49:03] to the servant of god no matter what
[49:05] anyone else says or what takes place
[49:08] stand
[49:10] see because it's becoming to us that we
[49:13] stay
[49:14] with the word
[49:17] don't stay with it
[49:18] until you criticize and give up you stay
[49:21] with it past your criticism
[49:23] don't stay with it until they make fun
[49:25] of you call you holy roller
[49:27] or make fun of your jump in your shout
[49:28] you stay with it
[49:30] because one day you're going to jump so
[49:32] high you ain't going to be here again
[49:35] [Applause]
[49:37] oh yeah
[49:39] i thought michael jordan could jump
[49:41] he could jump he set a record back then
[49:43] he jumped from the free throw line and
[49:45] dunked the basketball we're not talking
[49:46] about our free-throw line we talking
[49:49] about the line of time we're going to
[49:50] jump on into eternity look because while
[49:53] something's going to grab hold when you
[49:54] make that final jump that's going to be
[49:56] a holy spirit catch you and take you up
[49:58] into the higher height let me tell you
[50:00] you stand there and you keep jumping for
[50:03] god you keep standing for god you keep
[50:05] dancing for the glory of the lord
[50:12] we find in first peter i believe he puts
[50:13] us here for a purpose
[50:15] first peter 4 and verse 12.
[50:18] beloved
[50:20] thinking not strange concerning the
[50:22] fiery trial which is to try you
[50:24] as though some strange thing has
[50:26] happened to you now i know
[50:29] we face a trial we face a battle
[50:31] looking around god why me
[50:34] what in the world brother aaron did i do
[50:36] to deserve this
[50:37] when i get right here it squeals
[50:41] i gotta move now brother tim
[50:43] i gotta move
[50:45] i'm not a hula dancer by the way just
[50:47] that's why
[50:50] yeah few is right
[50:52] beloved think it not strange
[50:55] concerning the fiery trial which is to
[50:57] try you as though some strange thing has
[50:59] happened to you but rejoice
[51:03] oh here we go again
[51:06] we can't ever be in the valley because
[51:07] we always got to rejoice
[51:09] no matter what you're facing rejoice
[51:12] rejoice in who your god is
[51:15] rejoice and know that he's bigger than
[51:17] your situation
[51:20] notice now but rejoice in so much as you
[51:22] are partakers of christ's sufferings
[51:23] that when his glory shall be revealed
[51:26] you may be glad also with exceeding
[51:28] joy see there is nothing that happens to
[51:31] a believer
[51:32] or that a believer endures but what god
[51:35] hasn't allowed
[51:36] or god hasn't purposed in your life
[51:40] so no matter what you're going through
[51:42] don't think it's strange
[51:44] say god what's the purpose
[51:46] let me yield
[51:48] to the purpose of god
[51:51] let me yield myself in this situation to
[51:54] the plan of god to see god not with
[51:57] human eyes but with the eyes of christ i
[51:59] can see the purpose behind it because i
[52:02] know nothing will defeat the purpose of
[52:04] god
[52:06] then we find in james one my brethren
[52:08] count it all joy when you fall into
[52:10] diver's temptation knowing this that the
[52:12] trying of your faith work is patience
[52:14] but let patience have her perfect work
[52:16] that you may be perfect and entire
[52:18] wanting nothing so the fiery trial is a
[52:22] part of the purpose of god
[52:25] god has allowed it to mold you
[52:28] now i know some of you don't like
[52:29] molding
[52:31] you don't like to be rubbed the wrong
[52:32] way
[52:34] oh my
[52:36] oh yeah it got quiet real quick didn't
[52:38] they
[52:40] yeah the preacher gets up there and
[52:41] preaches all on your heart and he don't
[52:43] know anything about it but you want to
[52:45] say somebody told them but we didn't
[52:47] realize that the holy spirit is still a
[52:49] discerner of the intents of the heart
[52:52] the thoughts
[52:53] he knows what you have need of so he
[52:56] brings a certain little five foot six
[52:58] preacher in fiery and he's going to try
[53:00] to preach and teach this morning to you
[53:02] and he's going to rub you the wrong way
[53:04] a few times
[53:06] because god knows you need it and god's
[53:08] got a purpose behind it
[53:11] everything ain't sand castles and fairy
[53:13] tales
[53:15] this christian life is rugged now see if
[53:16] god god allows the devil to try you
[53:20] because god first he wants to show the
[53:22] devil that i got a bride on earth that
[53:24] will not fall
[53:26] she's going to stand no matter what you
[53:28] put her through she's gonna stand on my
[53:30] word on my promise because why she
[53:32] didn't call herself but i called her now
[53:35] sagen have you have you tried my little
[53:37] bride have you seen her down there she's
[53:39] a pure virtuous woman she's sinless
[53:42] she's virtuous she's a she's a daughter
[53:44] of the living god go out there and try
[53:46] her try with your pornography try it
[53:48] with this and try with that she won't be
[53:50] and she won't bow she won't break god's
[53:52] proven to your enemy that he's able to
[53:55] keep somebody in the midst of the work
[53:57] we're gonna say god's gonna have a young
[53:59] person god's gonna have a mom god's
[54:01] gonna have a daddy god's gonna have
[54:03] grandparents that's gonna stay true to
[54:05] the word of god
[54:06] [Applause]
[54:08] god is going to have a people that stays
[54:10] faithful to the word
[54:13] second is to bring us into a state
[54:16] of perfection
[54:19] now we don't like to be rubbed the wrong
[54:20] way we don't like trials we don't like
[54:22] tribulations we don't like these things
[54:24] but they have a purpose
[54:27] see there's a law
[54:30] of contrast
[54:32] we're going to go here for a little bit
[54:33] this morning
[54:36] let me set my watch
[54:39] all that was free
[54:41] just kidding
[54:44] i got my timer set just so y'all can
[54:46] relax
[54:47] y'all can get back into the service you
[54:48] are doing good
[54:49] program said now israel had its ups and
[54:52] downs
[54:53] it was the very type of the church today
[54:55] sometimes they were up on the housetops
[54:58] next time they were down in the valley
[55:00] you know in every service
[55:02] even here this morning there's some of
[55:04] you that's up here
[55:07] there's some of you that's down here
[55:09] there's some of you doing this and
[55:11] there's some of you that's doing that
[55:13] every service
[55:15] we have it
[55:16] so i'm thankful we have a church
[55:19] that when i'm not here you're there to
[55:21] bring me up
[55:23] and maybe when you're not here
[55:25] i'm here to bring you up brother aaron
[55:28] brother tim brother timothy deacons
[55:29] different ones other songs specials that
[55:32] song they're here to elevate us to bring
[55:34] us up
[55:37] but see israel had his ups and downs the
[55:39] very type of the church sometimes they
[55:41] were on the house tops sometimes they
[55:42] were down in the valley see that's what
[55:44] it takes to make us appreciate the good
[55:46] things
[55:48] see there's what they call the law of
[55:50] contrast the black man of africa never
[55:53] know that he was black his skin until
[55:55] he's seen a david livingston
[55:58] i'm gonna push this out y'all excuse me
[56:01] we're working on it
[56:03] when he realized his skin was black
[56:05] because david livestream was white it's
[56:07] a contrast you know
[56:09] he says you would never know how to
[56:11] appreciate day if you didn't have a
[56:12] night
[56:14] you never know how to appreciate the
[56:16] sunshine if you didn't have a cloudy day
[56:19] you don't never know how to appreciate
[56:20] righteousness unless you had some
[56:22] unrighteousness you never know how to
[56:24] appreciate good health unless you had
[56:26] foul health or bad health you never know
[56:28] how to appreciate these things unless
[56:30] you had an opposite
[56:32] to contradict it
[56:35] he said that's the reason why we
[56:36] appreciate the holy spirit so much
[56:37] tonight is because we lived so long in
[56:39] the church that were told that there was
[56:41] no such a thing as a holy ghost
[56:44] that's the reason we appreciate it
[56:45] tonight because we've had the other side
[56:52] we are struggling just a little bit
[56:58] see you never know how to appreciate
[57:00] mountaintops
[57:01] unless you've been in a valley
[57:06] you never know how to appreciate the
[57:07] mountaintops
[57:08] unless you've been down in the valley
[57:13] all the way through it's the law of
[57:15] contrast
[57:17] he says no you know we don't enjoy
[57:19] listen what he says you don't enjoy the
[57:21] ups unless we have the downs
[57:24] is that right
[57:25] do you realize we wouldn't have any
[57:27] mountains if we didn't have any valleys
[57:29] think about this for every mountain
[57:31] there's two valleys
[57:35] for every mountain top there's two
[57:37] valleys
[57:39] lebron make the statement he said the
[57:40] storms of life is what makes us have joy

[57:46] to be a battle

[58:04] facing if you want the victory you got
[58:06] to go through the battle see there is no

[1:00:17] morning i got no takers
[1:00:20] i'll get ready because it's about to
[1:00:21] happen
[1:00:22] he said everybody the pentecostal church
[1:00:24] too every night if you're not shouting
[1:00:27] dancing jumping up and down speaking in
[1:00:29] tongues running around over the floor
[1:00:31] something of another he goes you didn't
[1:00:33] have any kind of a meeting
[1:00:36] so brother joe you need to get quiet
[1:00:38] cause that's kind of how we are
[1:00:40] no just bear with me
[1:00:43] notice he says you know it's all right
[1:00:45] to be on the mountaintop that's good but
[1:00:47] let me tell you your fruits will freeze
[1:00:49] up there at night
[1:00:51] when the cold spells come cold spells
[1:00:54] when the cold spell comes you'll lose
[1:00:56] all your fruit that's what's happened
[1:00:58] now we put too much on mountaintop
[1:01:00] experiences of dancing of shaking and
[1:01:03] jumping around instead of the all-night
[1:01:05] prayer meetings down in the valley of
[1:01:06] decision where you have to come down
[1:01:08] there and meet god and really pour out
[1:01:10] your life until something takes place
[1:01:14] oh we let the fruits grow up there but
[1:01:16] the freeze kills it that's right every
[1:01:17] time it comes a little coals fell you
[1:01:19] know you got up there and nothing up
[1:01:21] there to rest upon the emotion dies down
[1:01:23] the shout's all gone the noises cease he
[1:01:26] says where are you at then he said the
[1:01:28] temptations come along and then you
[1:01:30] can't take it
[1:01:33] a couple years ago we took our family to
[1:01:35] colorado on a family vacation and we we
[1:01:38] visited pikes peak i don't know if you
[1:01:40] know but pike's peak is probably one of
[1:01:42] the tallest mountain peaks in all of
[1:01:44] northern america stands 14 115
[1:01:49] astonishing feet in the air
[1:01:52] when we started up
[1:01:54] beautiful scenery oh it was just so
[1:01:56] gorgeous as you switched back and oh
[1:01:59] look at that that's so beautiful we were
[1:02:00] taking pictures look like a never mind
[1:02:02] like a bunch of paparazzi just click
[1:02:04] click click go to the other side of your
[1:02:06] oh oh i've never seen that before and
[1:02:08] it's just so gorgeous all the way up
[1:02:12] just glorious great views man it's so
[1:02:14] nice
[1:02:15] and then you get to the top
[1:02:17] hall rock
[1:02:18] all rugged
[1:02:20] but man you could see as far as the eye
[1:02:22] would allow
[1:02:24] beautiful i mean you're up on the top
[1:02:26] tallest mountain in all of northern
[1:02:28] america i stand fourteen thousand one
[1:02:31] hundred and twenty one feet how you say
[1:02:34] you get that extra six because i put six
[1:02:36] foot on top of that
[1:02:38] i was standing on the rail gave me extra
[1:02:40] six inches i'm five foot six bam i'm 14
[1:02:43] 120 one feet i can do math pretty quick
[1:02:49] whoa and i could see as far as the eye
[1:02:51] could see
[1:02:54] but when we stepped out of that van
[1:02:57] not only is it cold brother aaron
[1:03:00] but there's something called altitude
[1:03:02] sickness
[1:03:04] that begins to settle down on you and
[1:03:06] you begin like this
[1:03:08] and all you can see right but you're
[1:03:10] seeing two of everything
[1:03:13] it's beautiful if you could focus but
[1:03:15] see we were up there and my wife got
[1:03:18] altitude sickness she had to sit down
[1:03:20] because we're not
[1:03:22] made to live on that kind of height
[1:03:25] and your spiritual life is the same way
[1:03:28] oh it's going up the mountain is great
[1:03:30] it's grand it's got a lot of
[1:03:32] achievements it's got a lot of beautiful
[1:03:34] scenery it's got a not a nice switchback
[1:03:36] but you're not made to live on the
[1:03:38] summit god made you to live down in the
[1:03:41] valley when you plant that seed in the
[1:03:43] valley and the right amount of moisture
[1:03:45] and the right amount of sunlight and it
[1:03:47] begins to hit that seed it begins to
[1:03:49] come up because there ain't enough
[1:03:50] devils in hell can keep that seed in the
[1:03:52] ground but on the mountain top you
[1:03:54] wasn't made to live up there on the
[1:03:56] mountain top that seed or die that seed
[1:03:59] are free it can't bring forth life but
[1:04:01] it's in the valley
[1:04:03] it's in the valley that your life pushes
[1:04:06] out the gift of god it's in the valley
[1:04:08] that you usher out the gift of god
[1:04:17] i'm so glad though
[1:04:19] that here at evening like tabernacle
[1:04:21] when i'm in my valley
[1:04:23] some of you are on the mountaintop
[1:04:26] and we can come into a service
[1:04:28] and we can create an atmosphere no
[1:04:30] matter where we are
[1:04:32] we can create an atmosphere
[1:04:36] an atmosphere to pull somebody up if
[1:04:38] it's only for a moment
[1:04:40] catch a glimpse at this ain't it
[1:04:43] there's more to this life than my valley
[1:04:46] i got a glimpse i went high enough up
[1:04:48] that i could see eternity just around
[1:04:50] the corner
[1:04:54] i got a glimpse behind the curtain of
[1:04:56] time oh i've seen it
[1:04:59] oh i've been seen in a vision i've been
[1:05:02] seeing all that second bride when she
[1:05:04] come marching through she was the same
[1:05:06] as the first prize same in every detail
[1:05:09] let me tell you because the alpha has
[1:05:11] become the omega the omega is matching
[1:05:13] back to the alpha the same bride that
[1:05:16] was in the beginning is the same bride
[1:05:18] that's here today
[1:05:20] oh churchill we're not going down we're
[1:05:22] going up in one moment
[1:05:26] oh hallelujah
[1:05:28] but see
[1:05:29] real spirit-filled leaders real
[1:05:31] spirit-filled christians of the
[1:05:33] pentecostal move they recognize that
[1:05:35] something happened
[1:05:36] they cooled off
[1:05:39] because everybody's trying to live on a
[1:05:41] mountaintop and they're going off
[1:05:43] without god
[1:05:45] he says what we need is to get back to
[1:05:46] god get back to the experience
[1:05:49] get back
[1:05:51] see our life
[1:05:53] your life
[1:05:54] my life
[1:05:55] no matter what position you play in the
[1:05:58] body
[1:05:59] your life has pros
[1:06:01] and your life has cons
[1:06:04] he says we got to have pros and cons
[1:06:07] that's the way it goes you got to have
[1:06:09] good days to make you enjoy the or bad
[1:06:12] days to make enjoy the good days you got
[1:06:14] to have a little sickness to make enjoy
[1:06:15] good health you have to have the valleys
[1:06:18] to make you enjoy the mountain tops and
[1:06:20] so then some of these days it'll be all
[1:06:22] he said it'll be all mountain top it'll
[1:06:24] be all good health it'll be all god but
[1:06:26] it'll be all joy but until then
[1:06:30] pros and cons
[1:06:33] and it seems like for most of us there's
[1:06:34] more cons than there are pros
[1:06:38] there's more struggles
[1:06:39] than there are joys
[1:06:41] there's more hardships
[1:06:43] than they are mountain tops seems like
[1:06:46] we're always in a trial how many
[1:06:49] and i'm not passing gloom this ain't no
[1:06:50] gloomy messes this morning if you down
[1:06:52] in that trial and you gloomy you need to
[1:06:53] learn to praise god in it
[1:06:56] but notice now just as soon as you come
[1:06:58] out of one trial you're back into
[1:06:59] another but the bible says many are the
[1:07:01] afflictions of the righteous
[1:07:03] but the lord delivereth out of them all
[1:07:07] god's not going to leave you in that
[1:07:09] valley god's not going to leave you in
[1:07:10] that sickness god's not going to leave
[1:07:11] you in that trial god's going gonna
[1:07:13] raise you up to that mountain peak and
[1:07:15] let you look over the corner of time and
[1:07:17] see that this life is not your final
[1:07:19] resting place god has provided something
[1:07:21] better for you church
[1:07:25] so we find there's times we get down
[1:07:29] there's times we get depressed we get
[1:07:31] nervous we fret we get anxious we have
[1:07:33] fears we have sicknesses we lose the
[1:07:35] love when we deal with loneliness we
[1:07:36] deal with disappointments this life is
[1:07:39] full
[1:07:40] of cons but it's so refreshing
[1:07:44] when we can have a pro
[1:07:47] it's so refreshing
[1:07:49] when we can come into the house of god
[1:07:52] and the presence of god begins to move
[1:07:54] and you may have walked in with a con
[1:07:59] [Music]
[1:08:00] dragon all around
[1:08:02] mully
[1:08:03] mullet grub
[1:08:05] but then the spirit of god
[1:08:07] in the song service on my best days i'm
[1:08:10] a child of god on my worst days i'm a
[1:08:13] child of god no matter where you are you
[1:08:16] may have come dragging a pro in but on
[1:08:18] your worst day you're still a child of
[1:08:20] god on your worst day you've still been
[1:08:22] adopted on your worst day you've still
[1:08:24] been you've still been born again of the
[1:08:26] spirit of god on your worst day oh if
[1:08:29] that's your worst day then what about
[1:08:31] your best day what about in the presence
[1:08:33] of a living god on your best day ain't a
[1:08:36] devil in hell can stand before you on
[1:08:38] your worst day much less your best day
[1:08:41] on my worst day satan i'm a child of god
[1:08:45] [Applause]
[1:08:49] you fight
[1:08:51] this move another spirit becomes
[1:08:53] all of a sudden the shackles of the cons
[1:08:56] fall off your life
[1:08:57] whoa
[1:08:59] and you begin to oh tap your foot you

[1:09:18] to try to rob you of your mountaintop
[1:09:22] they want to rob you they they watch in
[1:09:24] on the videos and they see young people
[1:09:26] move with the spirit or they see a young
[1:09:28] mother running around with a little baby
[1:09:30] in the arm because they don't know what
[1:09:32] god's just done for or they don't know
[1:09:35] what god just done for me they don't
[1:09:36] know what god just done for you they

[1:09:44] you coming to a service oh you may have
[1:09:46] been packing a bunch of coffee but all

[1:10:48] those
[1:10:49] very few mountaintops
[1:10:52] or those pros
[1:10:53] but see us in the valley
[1:10:55] when those roots
[1:10:57] begin to sprout
[1:10:59] and the winds of life
[1:11:01] begin to blow
[1:11:03] those winds have a purpose
[1:11:06] not to uproot the seed
[1:11:08] that seed shakes a little bit
[1:11:10] goes a little bit deeper shakes a little
[1:11:12] bit
[1:11:13] a little bit deeper
[1:11:14] for god allows the winds of life to blow
[1:11:17] across you your path
[1:11:19] for a purpose
[1:11:21] of making you a stronger christian

[1:14:13] here i didn't say i was closing
[1:14:16] no i'll do that five times y'all know
[1:14:18] when i do it
[1:14:21] elijah had a mountaintop
[1:14:24] actually if you go back in first kings
[1:14:25] 17 we're not going to read them all i'm
[1:14:27] just going to paraphrase second our
[1:14:29] first kings 17 and verse 1 he called for
[1:14:31] not to reign and it didn't rain
[1:14:34] i wouldn't mind having that kind of
[1:14:35] power
[1:14:36] but i don't you don't
[1:14:38] we don't
[1:14:39] but elijah did
[1:14:41] so he finds
[1:14:42] first kings 17 called for not to reign
[1:14:44] nor do the fall until it came his word
[1:14:46] and it dried up well look at 17 and
[1:14:49] verse 8 and verse 9 he goes to widows
[1:14:51] woman's house said give me a a cake to
[1:14:54] eat and realize he told her you make me
[1:14:56] one first that barrel of meal will never
[1:14:58] waste nor will your cruise oil ever run
[1:15:00] dry
[1:15:01] it never wasted until it rained
[1:15:03] we find here in first kings 17 and verse
[1:15:06] 17 he raises a widow's son who had died
[1:15:11] he stretches forth himself over the
[1:15:12] child and cried unto the lord
[1:15:14] when the life comes back to the young
[1:15:16] man we find him our opening scripture
[1:15:18] here first kings 18 he calls the
[1:15:20] prophets of baal he restored the altar
[1:15:22] first the power of god came down and
[1:15:24] licked up everything and dried it all up
[1:15:27] chased 400 prophets killed every last
[1:15:28] one of them he was on a mountaintop
[1:15:32] and noticed at the end first kings 18 he
[1:15:35] calls for it to reign notice he hears
[1:15:38] something i hear the sound
[1:15:41] oh i hear the sound of abundance of rain
[1:15:44] that was something it was time for the
[1:15:46] movement of the spirit i heard a sound
[1:15:48] for even like tabernacle it's the
[1:15:49] abundance of rain oh it's been a drought
[1:15:52] for a long time maybe you've been in the
[1:15:53] drought but i hear something this
[1:15:55] morning oh that rainy sea or that dry
[1:15:57] season is about to be over i hear
[1:15:59] something and he sent his servant up
[1:16:01] there and he saw a cloud by the size of
[1:16:03] a man's hand
[1:16:05] notice what he did
[1:16:07] call for it terrain and then he got on
[1:16:10] his
[1:16:11] garments
[1:16:12] and he cinched him all up and he outran
[1:16:15] the chariot
[1:16:17] this ain't no young whooper snapper
[1:16:19] he was an old man
[1:16:21] gray-headed
[1:16:22] i'd put him around 80.
[1:16:25] i don't know how what he was
[1:16:27] old man
[1:16:29] and he's out running a chariot
[1:16:31] i would say he was on a mountaintop
[1:16:35] called for it not to rain it didn't rain
[1:16:38] pray for the widow her meal wouldn't
[1:16:40] drop never dried up raised a dead boy
[1:16:43] back to life childing 400 prophets of
[1:16:44] bell called for it to rain out ran the
[1:16:46] chariot man everything he said came to
[1:16:48] pass bless god this is great amazing he
[1:16:50] didn't know what it meant to have a bad
[1:16:52] day
[1:16:52] that's what we look at
[1:16:54] we're outside looking in that's what our
[1:16:56] thoughts are
[1:16:57] man elijah man that guy's amazing he
[1:17:00] don't know what it is have a bad day i
[1:17:01] mean he just did this this this and this
[1:17:04] man he's just always living up here
[1:17:07] not the case
[1:17:09] it's amazing how soon
[1:17:11] one comes off the mountaintop
[1:17:15] we look here first kings 19 and they
[1:17:17] have
[1:17:18] no doubt you've imagined they have going
[1:17:20] home
[1:17:21] man jesse you know me tell you what this
[1:17:24] prophet just did
[1:17:26] jesse he destroyed all your prophets
[1:17:30] called them down there the man restored
[1:17:32] the broken altar they were calling out
[1:17:34] for their gods look they spent all day
[1:17:36] we were getting tired of it it was
[1:17:38] boring they kept calling they got up
[1:17:40] there they cut their self blood
[1:17:42] everywhere i mean it was an awful mess
[1:17:44] jesse but i'm going to tell you when
[1:17:45] elijah got up there he restored the
[1:17:47] altar he dug a dish they poured water on
[1:17:50] the thing three times i'm like i almost
[1:17:52] drowned because of so much water
[1:17:56] that's when y'all laugh
[1:18:00] but not only that
[1:18:02] man the power of god jesse come down and
[1:18:04] drunk up all the water took up all the
[1:18:06] offering looked up everything and then
[1:18:09] he chased your prophets and killed every
[1:18:11] last one of them
[1:18:12] but that ain't it he outrun my horses
[1:18:16] this man is unbelievable
[1:18:19] and you would have thought
[1:18:22] that that kind of witness would have
[1:18:24] turned her heart
[1:18:26] but notice what she says jezebel sent a
[1:18:29] messenger unto elijah saying so let the
[1:18:32] gods do to me and more also if i make
[1:18:35] not thy life is the life of one of them
[1:18:37] by tomorrow about this time and when he
[1:18:40] saw that he arose and he went for his
[1:18:42] life and he came to beersheba which
[1:18:44] belongs to judah and he left his servant
[1:18:46] there but he himself went a day's
[1:18:48] journey into the winters and he came and
[1:18:50] sat under a juniper tree
[1:18:52] and he requested himself that he might
[1:18:55] die
[1:18:56] we all have been
[1:18:59] there
[1:19:01] elijah receives a negative report
[1:19:03] this man called for not to reign he
[1:19:06] prayed for a widow's son brought a dead
[1:19:08] baby back to life destroyed 400 prophets
[1:19:10] and now
[1:19:12] he's running from a woman
[1:19:14] you would think man i'm going to take
[1:19:16] care of this little chick
[1:19:19] oh jesse with her little painted up face
[1:19:21] trying to ruin my
[1:19:23] parade i'm gonna tell you what i'm gonna
[1:19:24] do fire bam sucker up
[1:19:30] like the sons of thunder in the new
[1:19:31] testament will call fire down but he
[1:19:33] didn't do that
[1:19:35] because why because he was coming out of
[1:19:37] the anointing
[1:19:39] see he was on the other side of the
[1:19:41] mount carmel experience he was coming
[1:19:43] down and now you thought man this man
[1:19:45] doesn't have this this this this all
[1:19:47] these supernatural things take place
[1:19:49] there's no way why is he running from a
[1:19:51] little woman but i want you to know when
[1:19:53] you come out from under that anointing
[1:19:55] it changes everything and i'm going to
[1:19:58] go in here we're going to see see it's
[1:20:00] you can when you're up here you can pack
[1:20:02] the world away but when you're coming
[1:20:03] out of that anointing any little bitty
[1:20:05] thing just destroys you and it destroys
[1:20:08] your confidence and you run to the
[1:20:09] wilderness and you sit under a juniper
[1:20:11] tree
[1:20:14] now he's running for his life
[1:20:17] well the bible says elijah had a hard
[1:20:19] day he been on mount carmel he seen the
[1:20:22] glory of god come down he prayed fire
[1:20:24] out of heaven and then he prayed for it
[1:20:26] to reign upon the earth and all under
[1:20:27] his train his nerves were about broken
[1:20:30] oh how i feel for him
[1:20:34] see elijah he wouldn't compromise
[1:20:36] he told jezebel to her face
[1:20:39] what she needed to do
[1:20:41] and she despised him and threatened his
[1:20:43] life and the threat of his life what did
[1:20:45] it bring he didn't bring an
[1:20:46] international revival he'd have thought
[1:20:48] the whole country oh the lord he is god
[1:20:51] that's what they said one moment but
[1:20:53] jezebel put a death threat on his head
[1:20:54] the next
[1:20:56] see he was trying with all his heart
[1:20:59] within him to try to show the people
[1:21:00] that god was still god but it backfired
[1:21:03] and he runs into the wilderness when he
[1:21:04] heard it and there he laid under a
[1:21:06] juniper tree trying to find consolation
[1:21:10] see he was criticized and his life was
[1:21:12] threatened because he stayed with the
[1:21:14] word of god
[1:21:17] and you're going to be criticized
[1:21:19] but you've got to stay with the word of
[1:21:20] god
[1:21:21] you're going to be your values will be
[1:21:23] threatened but you got to stay with the
[1:21:24] word of god
[1:21:25] your beliefs will be threatened but you
[1:21:27] got to stay with the word of god they're
[1:21:28] going to talk about you they're going to
[1:21:30] make fun of you they're going to make
[1:21:31] fun of our running they're going to make
[1:21:32] fun of our tongues they're going to make
[1:21:34] fun of our dance but we got to stay with
[1:21:36] the word of god he didn't compromise on
[1:21:39] the word he didn't bend a little bit on
[1:21:40] doctrine he didn't preach a
[1:21:41] tickle-to-the-ear message he stayed with
[1:21:44] what god said no matter who his audience
[1:21:46] was he didn't preach an intellectual
[1:21:48] gospel no elijah demonstrated the
[1:21:51] dynamics of god he called for rain he
[1:21:54] called for it not to rain he called for
[1:21:56] fire to come down elijah demonstrated
[1:21:59] signs and wonders and i'm going to tell
[1:22:01] you this little bride is demonstrating
[1:22:03] the same supernatural god that elijah
[1:22:06] demonstrated
[1:22:08] he goes i wonder brother ma'am says this
[1:22:10] now i want y'all to listen in here
[1:22:13] i wonder sometimes i get so discouraged
[1:22:17] it's a wonder my wife can put up with me
[1:22:19] i go around after the meeting i feel so
[1:22:22] moody i cry while i walk around a while
[1:22:24] i say oh my i'm a total failure i don't
[1:22:28] see why the lord ever had anything to do
[1:22:30] with me this is your prophet
[1:22:34] see we see up here
[1:22:36] this one healed this one he'll
[1:22:37] disaddress this here this issue looking
[1:22:40] back looking forward looking here
[1:22:41] looking at man he never has a bad day
[1:22:46] my wife
[1:22:48] and he notice what he says my wife i
[1:22:50] walk around i'm so moody i cry out wow
[1:22:52] i'm a total i don't see one god
[1:22:54] while the lord ever has anything to do
[1:22:56] with me see it's coming out from under
[1:22:58] that anointing
[1:23:00] when you're up here up there you feel
[1:23:02] like you can pack the world away when
[1:23:04] you're down here though it's all right
[1:23:06] but it's coming between the two
[1:23:08] that's where it gets you
[1:23:10] for the aaron can testify
[1:23:12] some of you singers can testify
[1:23:14] especially when the anointing is on when
[1:23:16] you come out of it
[1:23:18] it's coming down
[1:23:20] it's what gets you
[1:23:23] and i want this message to encourage you
[1:23:25] see here a prophet of god felt like a
[1:23:26] total failure
[1:23:28] he didn't know why god would continue to
[1:23:30] use him see we're not alone
[1:23:32] we're not immune from these things these
[1:23:34] moments but we've got to learn to trust
[1:23:36] god because there's a purpose behind it
[1:23:39] see jonah here jonah was went into a
[1:23:41] belly of a well for three days and the
[1:23:43] well spit him out on the land he walked
[1:23:44] in there he converted the entire city
[1:23:46] they all repented and we find joan on
[1:23:49] top of a hill asking god to take his
[1:23:51] life when he come out of the anointing
[1:23:54] william calper here he's the one that
[1:23:56] that wrote the song that we sing there's
[1:23:58] a fountain filled with blood drawn from
[1:23:59] emmanuel's veins when the center is
[1:24:01] punched beneath the flood they lose all
[1:24:02] their guilty stains he said did you ever
[1:24:04] hear what happened to him after the
[1:24:06] inspiration left from him he tried to
[1:24:09] find the river and commit suicide
[1:24:11] coming out of the anointing
[1:24:14] stephen foster america's most famous
[1:24:16] folk song here he was he got the
[1:24:18] inspiration and that inspiration when it
[1:24:20] left him he would go get on the drunk
[1:24:22] and finally called a servant and took a
[1:24:24] razor and he committed suicide
[1:24:27] brother bam says people don't know what
[1:24:29] the people that live in the spiritual
[1:24:31] realm go through see it's coming out
[1:24:34] of the anointing see elijah was up on
[1:24:36] the mountain top one he called for fire
[1:24:38] out of heaven and he called for rain out
[1:24:41] of heaven and it had not rained for
[1:24:42] three years what anointing called for a
[1:24:44] hundred a balaam priest and chop their
[1:24:46] heads off what a powerful anointing but
[1:24:49] then went down in the desert that the
[1:24:50] threat of a woman he run out into a
[1:24:52] desert and when the anointing left him
[1:24:54] he was 40 days wandering out there in
[1:24:56] the wilderness and god found him and
[1:24:59] pulled back in a cave that's right no
[1:25:01] need to try to explain it you can't
[1:25:04] see when you come out of that anointing
[1:25:07] so let me give y'all some words of
[1:25:08] encouragement or words of advice this
[1:25:10] morning canada
[1:25:12] it's never a good time to say anything
[1:25:15] negative
[1:25:16] to a man who's just poured out his heart
[1:25:18] whether you're joking or not
[1:25:21] that man has poured out his heart he's
[1:25:22] prayed he studied he's yielded he's
[1:25:24] given himself and you sometimes you know
[1:25:26] some people they just don't know how to
[1:25:27] keep their mouth closed you know
[1:25:30] they come out well you know this was
[1:25:31] good but they did they did their butt
[1:25:33] but what you just done is you sent that
[1:25:35] man
[1:25:37] right off the mountain he's coming out
[1:25:40] of that anointing give him time
[1:25:42] give him time give him a day or two
[1:25:44] there's time for corrective or
[1:25:46] constructive criticism you don't have to
[1:25:47] do it immediately after the service
[1:25:49] let him get back down to ground zero
[1:25:53] then you can give him that feedback my
[1:25:55] wife learned that we learned that
[1:25:56] together
[1:25:59] why'd you say that so loud
[1:26:05] you've been at my
[1:26:06] house know when i first started
[1:26:08] preaching and she'd tell me stuff right
[1:26:10] after service i'm like
[1:26:14] and she learned i can't tell you right
[1:26:15] now
[1:26:17] i can't tell you right now i'll talk to
[1:26:18] you about it later
[1:26:19] i'm like alright
[1:26:21] because later you can receive it
[1:26:23] right then you're coming out of that
[1:26:24] anointing
[1:26:26] so there's something about coming out of
[1:26:27] that anointing we think man elijah he's
[1:26:29] done all this but he's coming out of it
[1:26:30] now and now a threat of a woman
[1:26:33] sends him and running for his life
[1:26:35] so no matter how many positive comments
[1:26:37] that preacher that song special person
[1:26:40] may have done one negative little
[1:26:42] comment
[1:26:44] sends them to a juniper tree but let me
[1:26:46] say this you don't you don't have to lie
[1:26:47] about it
[1:26:49] you don't enjoy the service that's fine
[1:26:51] just don't say nothing
[1:26:53] he didn't enjoy that special that's fine
[1:26:55] keep your mouth quiet
[1:26:58] use some self-control some restraint
[1:27:03] that's
[1:27:04] good gospel teaching right there told
[1:27:06] you i was a teacher
[1:27:14] see the thought jezebel's response would
[1:27:16] have been man
[1:27:17] he shut the mouths
[1:27:19] of baal
[1:27:20] they didn't even respond
[1:27:23] and yahweh comes down pooh
[1:27:26] sucks up the altar
[1:27:28] but instead of repenting
[1:27:31] she was more determined than ever to
[1:27:32] take his head off
[1:27:34] and elijah when he saw this he arose for
[1:27:36] his life and he went to beersheba and he
[1:27:38] left his servant notice he leaves his
[1:27:40] servant there and he goes on by himself
[1:27:42] now he's dwelling with his own thoughts
[1:27:45] man look all i've done was try to serve
[1:27:47] god i did this god you told me to do
[1:27:49] this you know how sometimes we are we're
[1:27:51] going right we're running it through the
[1:27:53] middle of the night three o'clock in the
[1:27:54] morning running things through four
[1:27:56] o'clock in the morning we're running
[1:27:57] things through you're woken up and
[1:27:58] you're like oh my you got this running
[1:28:00] through your head lord i just did this
[1:28:01] at your will and this is coming against
[1:28:02] me and that's coming against me and now
[1:28:04] he's got all these thoughts and he's
[1:28:05] just wandering and he's just wandering
[1:28:07] and he's just wondering and he's just
[1:28:09] wondering and sometimes we despise
[1:28:12] we despise the juniper tree
[1:28:15] because we think it's a form of weakness
[1:28:18] and he's got these thoughts in the heat
[1:28:21] of the day of the journey
[1:28:23] and he finds this little sagebrush
[1:28:26] broom plant
[1:28:28] i don't know how tall it is it's tall
[1:28:30] enough for elijah to go sit under it
[1:28:33] in the middle of nowhere there's a
[1:28:35] little tree planted
[1:28:37] and he goes and he sits down
[1:28:48] he's tired
[1:28:50] he's weary
[1:28:51] it's been a long day he's come out of
[1:28:53] the battle
[1:28:55] he's coming out from underneath the
[1:28:56] anointing
[1:28:58] and he finds a place of rest
[1:29:02] so i say that this morning
[1:29:04] philippe said elijah and his nerves were
[1:29:07] on edge i always felt sorry for him his
[1:29:10] nerves were all about ready to break
[1:29:12] anyhow great great pound from jezebel
[1:29:14] for finishing stroke he says oh the
[1:29:17] experience of the juniper tree
[1:29:22] don't despise
[1:29:24] your juniper tree
[1:29:27] god put it there for a purpose
[1:29:31] because you're not meant to live on a
[1:29:32] mountaintop
[1:29:34] you're not meant to stay up here in the
[1:29:36] supernatural
[1:29:37] there's a time coming will there be all
[1:29:39] day no night
[1:29:41] all supernatural no human element to it
[1:29:45] but he says now there's many of us find
[1:29:46] ourselves under the juniper tree he goes
[1:29:49] i get myself one of them many times
[1:29:51] it's a place that i that i just you just
[1:29:53] don't know what to do you're frustrated
[1:29:55] he says frankly i'm right under it now
[1:29:57] and i'm wondering oh god what would you
[1:30:00] have me to do
[1:30:01] see the juniper tree is a part of the
[1:30:04] christian experience
[1:30:07] god has a purpose
[1:30:09] for
[1:30:10] the juniper tree

[1:31:36] terrible condition and many of us hit
[1:31:39] those places especially after a mount
[1:31:42] carmel experience
[1:31:45] they asked him said brother branham what
[1:31:47] do you do what can be done for a time
[1:31:48] like this he says there's only one thing
[1:31:50] that you can do is commit yourself to
[1:31:52] god
[1:31:53] that's all that we can do he said god
[1:31:57] has to do something
[1:31:58] for every man that comes under the
[1:32:00] juniper tree or he'll go to pieces
[1:32:03] god has to do it

[1:32:22] after i come out of a meeting i look
[1:32:24] like i tried i preached i begged i
[1:32:26] persuaded i see the angel god sweep
[1:32:28] through the meeting and do signs and
[1:32:30] wonders and said in the car on the
[1:32:31] outside and i hear them crying say oh it
[1:32:33] was nothing but psychology there's
[1:32:35] nothing to it nothing to it at all a
[1:32:37] bunch of nonsense he goes oh i then i
[1:32:40] crawled under a juniper tree and i think
[1:32:42] lord
[1:32:43] what did you why did you let me do it
[1:32:46] what he says what can it be done it says
[1:32:49] but with all these experiences but the
[1:32:51] mercy of jehovah to his servant he said
[1:32:53] god knows your trials

[1:33:51] you're at your juniper tree for a
[1:33:53] purpose

[1:34:56] thousand angels watching

[1:35:03] though the world turned them down god
[1:35:05] loves him
[1:35:08] though the world may turn you down

[1:42:36] i cried unto the lord and i said thou
[1:42:38] art my refuge and my portion in the land
[1:42:41] of the living
[1:42:43] here elijah
[1:42:45] found the refuge
[1:42:48] when he was
[1:42:49] at his breaking point
[1:42:51] weakest moment
[1:42:53] crying out to god to take his life he
[1:42:56] found a refuge
[1:43:00] on a place that just you would have
[1:43:03] never thought
[1:43:04] a juniper tree a sagebrush a balloon a
[1:43:08] broom plant he was tired and weary but
[1:43:10] god cared for his prophet he goes oh i
[1:43:13] think the lovely kindness of god showed
[1:43:15] to elijah when he took him out from
[1:43:16] underneath that tree
[1:43:17] and he says i believe that juniper tree
[1:43:20] was put in the ground there for that
[1:43:22] very purpose
[1:43:25] god planted that tree many years before
[1:43:30] because he knew he would have a
[1:43:31] wondering prophet
[1:43:33] come and need to find rest
[1:43:38] and god has provided you a tree
[1:43:41] two thousand years ago he cut down a
[1:43:43] cross
[1:43:44] and he planted it in the ground and he
[1:43:46] hung his son on it so that that weary
[1:43:49] wayward sinner could find rest for his
[1:43:52] weary soul
[1:43:54] not only find rest
[1:43:56] but to receive supernatural vitamins to
[1:43:59] continue the journey because the
[1:44:00] journey's not over so juniper tree is
[1:44:03] only a stopping place
[1:44:06] it's not a permanent place but it has a
[1:44:08] purpose
[1:44:10] he goes oh what we need in this journey
[1:44:13] that we're in now is to find a place of
[1:44:15] rest
[1:44:16] and to feast
[1:44:18] on the word of god so that it'll give us
[1:44:21] strength
[1:44:23] when you're underneath your juniper tree
[1:44:24] i want the musicians to come
[1:44:29] sister rebecca
[1:44:31] when you're underneath your juniper tree
[1:44:32] filling all alone down in the dumps
[1:44:34] just start playing softly i'll let you
[1:44:36] know when i want you to start
[1:44:39] just be assured that god has allowed you
[1:44:41] to come to this place for a purpose
[1:44:44] it may appear that you're at your
[1:44:45] breaking
[1:44:46] point may appear that you can't keep
[1:44:49] going
[1:44:50] [Music]
[1:44:51] but just as god had a purpose for the
[1:44:53] mountaintops
[1:44:55] god has a purpose for the juniper tree
[1:44:57] experience
[1:44:58] in the vast desert all along god led his
[1:45:01] servant to a shade tree
[1:45:03] and i believe god has led all of us here
[1:45:05] this morning
[1:45:06] to an oasis a place of rest
[1:45:09] we can come
[1:45:11] busyness and struggles of life leave it
[1:45:13] on the outside we come in here as a
[1:45:16] refuge a place of rest
[1:45:19] [Music]
[1:45:22] same god that stroked elijah's head
[1:45:25] and his brow is the same god is here to
[1:45:27] stroke yours this morning
[1:45:30] you may be weary you may feel like
[1:45:31] giving up you feel like giving in you
[1:45:33] feel like throwing in the towel and
[1:45:34] calling it quits
[1:45:35] he's got the angels here this morning
[1:45:38] encamped around this service
[1:45:40] with the softest hands
[1:45:43] to take care of your need
[1:45:45] he knows your need all he has to do is
[1:45:47] dispatch him for the johnny he knows
[1:45:50] that arthritis dispatch it
[1:45:52] take care of that
[1:45:56] see he hasn't left you to wander in your
[1:45:58] wilderness alone
[1:46:00] he hasn't forsaken you
[1:46:02] he hasn't left you to face your trial or
[1:46:04] your sickness alone but he's provided a
[1:46:07] juniper tree
[1:46:11] place of rest

[1:46:14] and sit down and you can refresh
[1:46:15] yourself
[1:46:17] from the heat of the day the struggles
[1:46:19] of life
[1:46:20] and you can receive spiritual food
[1:46:24] see god's provided
[1:46:26] a tree for us in this journey

[1:46:39] rain
[1:46:40] there's no mention of god
[1:46:42] and called for fire to come down god
[1:46:44] wasn't just there like that
[1:46:47] wasn't personal so much
[1:46:49] we did all these other things
[1:46:51] but when he was there underneath that
[1:46:53] juniper tree
[1:46:54] god dispatched angels and they came to
[1:46:57] his side
[1:46:59] and they began to caress his servant
[1:47:02] show him eternal attention
[1:47:05] special attention supernatural food
[1:47:09] a special meeting maybe it's miss
[1:47:11] meeting this morning may just be for one
[1:47:12] person because you're or where elijah
[1:47:15] said and you know god i just need
[1:47:18] something brother i'm saying god has to

[1:47:30] he found himself there and he wanted to
[1:47:31] die
[1:47:33] god take me i'm no better than my
[1:47:36] father's and many of us we've been there
