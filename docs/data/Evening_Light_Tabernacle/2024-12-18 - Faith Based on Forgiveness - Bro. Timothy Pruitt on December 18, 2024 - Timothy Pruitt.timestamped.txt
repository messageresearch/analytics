[42:42] [Music]
[42:45] amen amen let's turn to Mark chap 11 if
[42:49] you would in your Bibles
[42:58] Mark
[43:00] 11:22 and Jesus answered and saith unto
[43:03] them have faith in God for verily I say
[43:06] unto you that whosoever shall say un
[43:09] this mountain be thou removed and be
[43:11] thou cast into the sea and shall not
[43:14] doubt in his heart but shall believe
[43:16] that those things which he saith shall
[43:18] come to pass he shall have whatsoever he
[43:22] saith therefore I say unto you
[43:24] whatsoever things you desire When you
[43:26] pray believe that you receive them and
[43:29] you shall have them and when you stand
[43:32] praying forgive ain't that amazing when
[43:35] you stand praying forgive if you have
[43:38] altought against any that your father
[43:40] which also is in heaven May forgive you
[43:43] your trespasses but if you do not
[43:45] forgive neither will your father which
[43:48] is in heaven forgive your trespasses
[43:51] amen we let you be seated this evening
[43:54] just have a thought kind of a part two
[43:56] of Last last Wednesday we spoke about
[43:59] resentment uh I want to speak on faith
[44:02] based on
[44:04] forgiveness amen faith based on
[44:06] forgiveness actually this comes from a
[44:08] quote in perfect Faith where brother
[44:10] Bram says his very statement he says
[44:12] faith is based on forgiveness he said
[44:16] when we said that this morning trying to
[44:18] get the church into the place that where
[44:21] we could really see Apostolic times
[44:23] moving Among
[44:25] Us amen So it's b based on forgiveness
[44:28] so we can get the church to the place
[44:30] where we can really see Apostolic times
[44:33] moving among us and that's what we all
[44:35] hunger for amen it is just laying right
[44:39] at the door we see it but we want to see
[44:42] more of it amen we see healings but we
[44:44] want to see more healings we see
[44:47] salvation but we want to see more
[44:48] salvation we've seen prodal come home
[44:51] but we want to see more prodal come home
[44:54] amen we've seen it but we want to see
[44:56] more of it we want it we want such a
[44:59] flow that it'll be a help to us and also
[45:02] flow out to others amen so I was just
[45:05] reading the scripture as Jesus speaks
[45:07] and and brother brother Tim's been
[45:09] preaching on uh moving the mountain but
[45:12] just reading that scripture and reading
[45:14] a little further down of of how he
[45:17] actually tied it to forgiveness and and
[45:19] is you know we want power to speak to
[45:21] mountains we absolutely H want that we
[45:24] desire that and we have that in the
[45:25] Church of the Living God
[45:27] amen that mountains can be moved in our
[45:29] lives but if we allow things to stay in
[45:31] our hearts and our lives then mountains
[45:34] cannot move because if you have a Al in
[45:36] your heart or you have something there
[45:38] amen doubt would try to arise feelings
[45:40] of all kinds of things trying to keep
[45:43] Faith amen dormant in your life amen we
[45:46] can read it here in Matthew chapter 8
[45:48] and verse1 15 he says moreover if your
[45:51] brother shall trespass against thee go
[45:54] and tell him his fault before thee and
[45:56] him alone and if he shall hear thee thou
[45:58] has gained a Brethren and we know how he
[46:00] speaks about it you if that don't happen
[46:03] then get a witness and go go speak to
[46:05] him if I don't go then take it before
[46:06] the church but then he brings it right
[46:08] down in verse 18 He said verily I say
[46:11] unto you whatsoever you shall bind on
[46:14] Earth shall be bound in heaven and
[46:16] whatsoever you loose on Earth shall be
[46:18] loosed in heaven so we can again see
[46:21] that faith is based on forgiveness it's
[46:24] scripture amen and he said again I say
[46:26] unto you that if two of you shall agree
[46:28] on Earth as touching anything that they
[46:30] shall ask it shall be done of them of My
[46:33] Father which is in heaven for where two
[46:35] or three are gathered together in my
[46:38] name there am I in the midst of them
[46:41] amen not gathered together with their
[46:43] hurts or their pains or their feelings
[46:45] against one another but gathered
[46:47] together in his name amen that my grace
[46:50] and Glory may be revealed to you amen
[46:53] then came Peter you know Peter he's had
[46:55] to say something he said and then came
[46:57] Peter to him saying Lord how off shall
[47:00] my brother sin against me and I forgive
[47:02] him till seven times that that sounds
[47:04] pretty good that's one for every day of
[47:06] the week that's that's pretty awesome
[47:08] you know I I got it covered there and
[47:11] Jesus looks at him and said Jesus said I
[47:13] say not unto thee until seven times but
[47:16] until 70 times
[47:19] seven wow Peter no doubt kind of rocked
[47:22] on his heels a little bit now wait a
[47:24] minute hey you know it's eye for an eye
[47:26] tooth for a Toth and you're telling me
[47:28] I'm supposed to forgive him 70 time 7 in
[47:31] other words enough forgiveness Amen to
[47:34] have enough forgiveness till it's enough
[47:37] forgiveness to have amen that where no
[47:39] matter what comes against you amen no
[47:42] matter what happens that you can let
[47:44] those things go and let God work in your
[47:46] life because that's the ultimate thing
[47:48] am me no wonder Satan wants to keep us
[47:51] so bound down with our unbelief because
[47:53] we we get bound down with hurts and
[47:55] pains and and alts and things that we've
[47:58] carried for years and God can't even use
[48:00] us like he wants to use us God wants to
[48:03] use us more than we ever could even
[48:05] think of God wants to do the miraculous
[48:07] Among Us he wants to heal Among Us he
[48:10] wants to deliver he wants to set free
[48:12] but if we allow those things no wonder
[48:14] Satan tries to keep us divided no wonder
[48:17] Satan tries to keep us all one one after
[48:19] another and this hurt over here and that
[48:21] bad business deal there and this
[48:23] situation over there why cuz he knows if
[48:25] he can keep the church in the attitude
[48:27] of alts in the attitude of unforgiveness
[48:30] then they can never be in the attitude
[48:32] of faith and we want faith in our hearts
[48:35] to believe for the
[48:38] impossible amen he says not until seven
[48:42] times but 70 times seven therefore is
[48:45] the Kingdom of Heaven liken unto a
[48:47] certain King I may mention this but I
[48:49] want to bring it out which would take
[48:51] account of his servants and when he
[48:53] begin to reckon he was brought unto him
[48:55] which owed 10,000 talents now it's
[48:58] around it's around three or four million
[49:00] bucks a lot of money for as much as he
[49:02] had not paid the his Lord commanded him
[49:04] to be sold his wife his children and all
[49:07] that he had and a pavement be made and
[49:10] the servant there fell down and
[49:11] worshiped him saying Lord have patience
[49:13] with me and I will pay thee all then the
[49:16] lord of the Ser that servant was moved
[49:18] with compassion and loosed him and
[49:21] forgave him the debt ain't that a
[49:23] wonderful thing right there amen we can
[49:25] find ourselves in that scripture amen we
[49:27] were all in a place we had a debt we
[49:30] could not pay we could not pay our sin
[49:33] debt we could not pay the things that we
[49:35] had but the Lord had compassion upon us
[49:38] I'm glad to be a people that the Lord
[49:40] has compassion upon and he saw us in our
[49:43] sin and he saw us in our unbelief and he
[49:46] wiped it all
[49:48] off Hallelujah but the same servant went
[49:52] out the same servant and found one of
[49:54] his fellow servants so they're both
[49:58] servants come on now amen they're both
[50:01] servants which owed him a 100 P which is
[50:04] about 17 bucks maybe 24 bucks today with
[50:10] inflation $24 round it off to a good 25
[50:14] bucks so we got several million dollars
[50:17] and
[50:18] $25 amen so it it's amazing that Jesus
[50:22] uses this type like this to show how
[50:24] great your sin Deb is how great and
[50:28] impossible that you can't pay it if you
[50:30] sold every lamb if you sold every donkey
[50:33] if you sold everything you could never
[50:35] pay it and but yet God rich in Mercy
[50:38] paid it all and then we'll take
[50:40] something so
[50:42] little and hold it over somebody's
[50:46] head all right we ow owed him a 100
[50:50] Pence and he laid hands on him ain't
[50:52] just hanging it over his head he's
[50:54] laying hands on him
[50:57] and took him by the
[50:58] throat he just walked out and got all
[51:01] this forgiveness and he walks right down
[51:04] the road and here's this oh I remember
[51:06] you owe me $25 you got it on no I don't
[51:08] have it well you better have it right
[51:09] now cuz I'm going to shake you upside
[51:11] down till I Shake It Out of You old
[51:15] Bud all right and besold
[51:19] him pay me th that thou owest and his
[51:22] fellow servant fellow servant fell down
[51:26] at his feet and besought him saying have
[51:28] patient with me and I will pay thee all
[51:31] now he has a perfect opportunity right
[51:32] here he has an opportunity to do just
[51:35] what's been done to
[51:37] him but no he goes exactly the opposite
[51:40] saying he would not but went and cast
[51:42] him into prison till he should pay the
[51:44] debt so when his fellow servants saw
[51:46] what was done they were very sorry came
[51:48] and told the Lord that was done and then
[51:50] the Lord after he called him said unto
[51:52] him oh thy Wicked servant I forgave thee
[51:55] all that debt because thou desirest me
[51:57] should us not thou also have compassion
[52:00] on thy fellow servant even as I have
[52:02] pity on thee and the Lord was wroth and
[52:05] delivered him to the tormentors till he
[52:07] should pay all that was due unto him so
[52:10] likewise shall my heavenly father do
[52:13] also unto you if you have in your hearts
[52:16] from your hearts forgive not everyone
[52:19] his brother their
[52:22] trespasses wow so you know so why why is
[52:25] he why is he dealing with this so
[52:28] harshly or trying to show you how
[52:30] harshly it is because he knows if you
[52:33] fail to forgive someone you actually
[52:35] become a prisoner to the
[52:38] Past you actually become a prisoner to
[52:41] the Past unforgiveness it keeps the pain
[52:44] alive it it keeps uh it never lets the
[52:46] wound
[52:47] heal keeps pulling the scab off of again
[52:51] then you go through life and you're
[52:52] always reminding yourself of what's been
[52:54] done to you and you begin to accumulate
[52:57] bad feelings instead of accumulating
[53:00] Faith you begin to accumulate
[53:02] unforgiveness which which goes into
[53:04] bitterness and all kinds of other things
[53:06] unforgiveness puts you in a prison of
[53:09] the past and robs you of the joy of the
[53:12] present
[53:14] right people many times are ruining
[53:17] their present because of the
[53:19] Past come on now they allowed the things
[53:23] that have come up in their childhood and
[53:25] they allowed all that bitterness and
[53:26] hate towards their daddy or whatever and
[53:28] it ruins the present what they could
[53:31] have with their own
[53:33] children come on
[53:35] somebody all right well you're getting
[53:37] in the Pastoral do wonderful I'm
[53:39] assistant pastor
[53:42] here amen amen so but when you forgive
[53:47] it opens the door to the prison and it
[53:50] lets you out right I want you to
[53:53] understand amen you are the one that's
[53:55] in the prison or the one out of the
[53:57] prison that's
[54:02] right but when you forgive it opens the
[54:05] door and forgiveness sets you free from
[54:07] the
[54:08] past but if you continue to allow the
[54:11] offense and never forgive then you allow
[54:15] that person to continue offending you
[54:17] the rest of your
[54:20] life for unforgiveness accumulates it
[54:23] accumulates bitterness and resentment
[54:25] and the LA longer the offense is not
[54:28] forgiven the more you accumulate and the
[54:30] more it begins to shape you
[54:34] presently unforgiveness accumulates
[54:36] bitterness bitterness accumulates anger
[54:39] anger accumulates
[54:43] Revenge amen forgiveness though also
[54:47] accumulates amen uh forgiveness
[54:50] accumulates amen just as the other also
[54:54] it washes it washes bitterness away and
[54:57] anger away and revenge away and it
[54:59] accumulates love joy peace gentleness
[55:03] goodness and
[55:10] God unforgiveness though gives the devil
[55:13] an open
[55:14] door and you must close that door to and
[55:18] forgive to forgive is to turn the key
[55:21] open the sail and let the prisoner out
[55:25] you amen because you know you keep that
[55:28] all and you got that thing so buried
[55:29] down deep in there and it's affecting
[55:31] everything in your life meanwhile the
[55:32] other person is going on doing their own
[55:34] thing moved on and they ain't even
[55:36] thought about it no more well how dare
[55:38] should I forgive them you forgive them
[55:41] so you can be set free that's right amen
[55:44] listen I want to I want to break this in
[55:46] here for just a moment again forgiveness
[55:48] is not actually just letting somebody
[55:50] off of they if they' done you wrong amen
[55:52] they're going to have to give account
[55:53] for it sooner or later they going to
[55:55] have to give an account for what they
[55:57] done am me how they treated people all
[56:00] of that they going to have to give an
[56:01] account for but what forgiveness does is
[56:04] set you free that's right so you can be
[56:07] free to accumulate love and joy and
[56:10] happiness and peace and faith in
[56:17] God to forgive is to write and large
[56:21] letters across the debt nothing owed
[56:26] yeah well I just need them to tell me
[56:28] I'm sorry they're sorry no you just need
[56:30] to
[56:33] forgive Let It Go Amen to forgive is to
[56:37] pound the gravel in a courtroom and say
[56:39] not
[56:42] guilty to forgive is to bundle up all
[56:45] the garbage and dispose of it and
[56:47] leaving the house clean and fresh
[56:50] [Music]
[56:51] again Hallelujah to forgive is to relax
[56:55] the strangle hold
[56:57] the strangle hold on a wrestling
[56:59] opponent and give him his
[57:04] life to forgive is the sand blast a wall
[57:07] of graffiti leaving it looking like new
[57:12] again forgiveness is so important it's
[57:15] right at the center of your spiritual
[57:23] well-being amen you know what a blessing
[57:27] is what anybody know what a blessing is
[57:30] oh if I can receive $25,000 that'd be a
[57:33] blessing yes sir it would
[57:36] be well if I could just get get ahead
[57:39] what a blessing that' be if somebody
[57:40] just give me this I'd you want you know
[57:43] the prophet as answered to that he said
[57:45] do you know what a blessing is do
[57:47] something for somebody
[57:50] else wow that's a real blessing if you
[57:54] have a neighbor somebody that's done you
[57:56] Injustice remember this for me don't
[57:58] ever turn him
[58:01] down take him into God in prayer and see
[58:04] what a different attitude you will
[58:08] have if you're sincere in your prayer
[58:11] you'll stand shoulder to shoulder with
[58:12] him though he's done you wrong in
[58:14] justice but you'll take that man to God
[58:16] and stand there in the presence of
[58:18] father one time and say father my
[58:20] neighbor has done me wrong but I get
[58:22] watch when you go to telling is wrong
[58:24] it'll not only help him but but it'll
[58:26] help
[58:27] you oh I love telling what people done
[58:30] to me wrong well do you love telling it
[58:31] to the
[58:32] father this is who he says you're
[58:34] allowed to go tell it to not on the
[58:37] phone or gossiping and carrying on and
[58:40] causing all these hard feelings and
[58:41] stuff what it's a root of
[58:43] bitterness and it begins to grow out and
[58:46] the more you tell it the more the roots
[58:47] get out but if you'll tell it to your
[58:50] father then he can take a word and chop
[58:53] that thing off out of your life amen see
[58:55] what watch where you go telling is wrong
[58:57] it'll not only help him but it'll help
[58:59] you and you'll see that he's been
[59:01] through Temptations and things just as
[59:03] you have it'll change your attitude
[59:06] towards that brother and it'll help him
[59:08] also you're always are doing good when
[59:11] you're praying for one
[59:13] another come on somebody you're always
[59:16] doing good when you're praying for one
[59:21] another but if the devil another quote
[59:24] if the devil can keep us separated and
[59:26] he's got us shooting at one another so
[59:28] he's got an open Target anytime he wants
[59:30] to shoot so but what really what's the
[59:32] use in him shooting we're shooting one
[59:34] another he can just sit back and
[59:37] relax but if I found Grace in your sight
[59:39] through God you take my word for this
[59:43] well I I don't know about you but a
[59:45] prophet's words means a little bit more
[59:47] to me than anybody else's words as far
[59:49] as humanly
[59:51] speaking amen if you want to be a
[59:54] blessing and get a blessing how many
[59:56] wants to be a blessing and get a
[59:57] blessing all right when a man has done
[1:00:00] you wrong and I mean done you wrong you
[1:00:04] know he's done you
[1:00:06] wrong he's done you evil don't mention
[1:00:14] that Hallelujah
[1:00:19] [Laughter]
[1:00:21] anyhow help us lord well you just said
[1:00:25] you conv mention yeah to the
[1:00:28] father
[1:00:29] hello or you can go to that brother as
[1:00:32] the scripture
[1:00:33] said but not to the
[1:00:37] church come on
[1:00:39] somebody all that does is just spread
[1:00:42] bitterness and you know what that all
[1:00:44] that is is a one-sided tale one-sided
[1:00:46] story amen that's why Jesus wanted to
[1:00:49] get both of you
[1:00:50] together CU there's two sides to every
[1:00:52] story
[1:00:56] oh I know I stepped off in it right then
[1:00:58] but there's two sides to every
[1:01:03] story he's done you wrong he's done you
[1:01:05] evil don't mention that you take him to
[1:01:08] prayer before God and don't take it in a
[1:01:11] way of just a selfish way of say well
[1:01:13] I'm just supposed to do this I guess
[1:01:15] stand shoulder to shoulder stand in the
[1:01:16] presence of
[1:01:17] God no you pray to the father a way a
[1:01:23] prayer should be made in the presence of
[1:01:25] God
[1:01:27] god father here's my brother yes he
[1:01:31] deserves punishment because he's done me
[1:01:32] evil I don't see why he did it but then
[1:01:36] you just be quiet for a little bit and
[1:01:37] let God go to talking to
[1:01:40] you and you'll see maybe what that man's
[1:01:43] been through the devil's Twisted him up
[1:01:44] somewhere caused him to do that though
[1:01:46] he's absolutely wrong before you leave
[1:01:49] the Throne of God you'll be feeling
[1:01:50] sorry for that
[1:01:52] man wow You'll Be sympathizing with that
[1:01:55] brother and when you get back down to
[1:01:57] Earth again you'll go over that brother
[1:01:58] shake his hand cuz you know what he's
[1:02:01] been through you can't stand with a
[1:02:03] mortal in the presence of God and
[1:02:05] condemn
[1:02:08] anybody I don't believe it no sir even
[1:02:11] if he is a rank
[1:02:15] sinner what about a brother that's made
[1:02:17] a mistake though I say he's wrong
[1:02:19] sometimes it's accus of being wrong and
[1:02:20] not wrong but if he's wrong if we'll
[1:02:22] take him to the throne of God and stand
[1:02:24] there shoulder to- shoulder with our
[1:02:25] brother knowing he's IM mortal and maybe
[1:02:28] his destination rest upon our attitude
[1:02:31] towards
[1:02:33] him my I his destination rest upon our
[1:02:37] attitude towards him when we come back
[1:02:39] from the Throne of God we'll realize
[1:02:41] that we're everyone
[1:02:44] guilty we're everyone guilty we all need
[1:02:48] help one from the other and that's the
[1:02:52] best way to do is pray
[1:03:01] I this quote here is is amazing to me
[1:03:06] said we must be reverent and respect
[1:03:08] each other and love each other and show
[1:03:09] respect to each
[1:03:11] other I believe you say why are you
[1:03:13] preaching this you know
[1:03:15] something I'm preaching this cuz God
[1:03:17] told me to preach
[1:03:18] this and I know people that's exactly
[1:03:21] right we
[1:03:22] people we got issues
[1:03:26] as you heard Sunday about the perfect
[1:03:28] Church don't go there cuz you won't it
[1:03:30] won't be perfect no
[1:03:31] more amen is I believe it was a few
[1:03:35] nights ago somewhere else it was there
[1:03:37] was a crippled woman a crippled woman
[1:03:40] she had a real need a woman it
[1:03:43] was in Jamaica and she was sitting there
[1:03:45] but she gave her
[1:03:47] place respect to a woman that had heart
[1:03:51] trouble she gave her place in line
[1:03:57] and because she did that the Holy Spirit
[1:04:00] comes right back around and healed
[1:04:04] her love and show respect one to the
[1:04:08] other if you want God to hear your
[1:04:11] prayer and send you an angel to your
[1:04:15] home that's a blessing I'd like to have
[1:04:18] amen send an angel to your home live
[1:04:21] right do right treat everybody right and
[1:04:25] be right before God and God will grant
[1:04:28] that to
[1:04:29] [Music]
[1:04:30] you amen that's treating everybody right
[1:04:33] at
[1:04:34] work whether you're the employee or the
[1:04:37] employer that's treating people with
[1:04:39] respect and love and realize and listen
[1:04:42] they're standing before me a purchased
[1:04:44] son or daughter of God or somebody that
[1:04:46] needs
[1:04:49] God and my attitude towards them might
[1:04:52] have an everlasting effect on them
[1:04:54] towards Christ
[1:05:00] he said you don't know this's another
[1:05:02] quote I love how they just line up you
[1:05:04] don't know what's beaten beneath that
[1:05:06] little old skin
[1:05:09] there the Holy Ghost might be your
[1:05:11] Tabernacle there so you got to watch
[1:05:13] yourself don't do that we must be
[1:05:15] brothers no matter if he's in the wrong
[1:05:18] still treat him
[1:05:21] nice
[1:05:23] Hallelujah be nice to him if you haven't
[1:05:26] got that Spirit then there's something
[1:05:29] wrong Hallelujah anyhow if you Jesus was
[1:05:34] nice to those who were ugly to
[1:05:36] him you must be Christians full of love
[1:05:39] ready to help any
[1:05:42] race I know that people want to make the
[1:05:45] prophet some racist but listen to listen
[1:05:47] because of what he said on marriage and
[1:05:49] and and things about inter Mar but
[1:05:50] listen what he said you must be nice to
[1:05:53] any race color Creed anywhere anytime we
[1:05:58] must be that way that's a
[1:06:01] Christian amen amen that's the way
[1:06:03] Christ would have us act and to be
[1:06:06] Christians is to be
[1:06:09] Christlike CU see so another quote
[1:06:12] somebody is watching your
[1:06:15] life they're watching how you talk to
[1:06:17] other
[1:06:18] people well I'm their boss I can talk to
[1:06:20] them how I want to no they're watching
[1:06:23] or I'm an employee I they're watching
[1:06:26] other people were
[1:06:28] watching let everybody know let your
[1:06:30] dealings be fair and
[1:06:34] square good and don't take nothing that
[1:06:38] doesn't belong to you don't say nothing
[1:06:41] but what's the truth and you can always
[1:06:42] tell the truth every time God will honor
[1:06:45] the truth always do what's right treat
[1:06:47] everybody right if they don't treat you
[1:06:49] right treat him right anyhow Jesus
[1:06:51] treated us right when we didn't treat
[1:06:53] him right that's right
[1:06:56] come on somebody what has he done for
[1:06:59] you he's forgiven us of our debts and
[1:07:02] our sins and made us Sons and Daughters
[1:07:04] of God how come we can't treat somebody
[1:07:07] else the same way so
[1:07:12] true John
[1:07:15] 13:34 says a new commandment I give unto
[1:07:18] you oh well I thought we had the 10 well
[1:07:19] a new commandment I give to you that you
[1:07:21] love one another as I have loved you
[1:07:25] that you also love one
[1:07:28] another by this shall all men know that
[1:07:31] you are my disciples if you have love
[1:07:34] one for the
[1:07:36] other John 15:12 says this is my
[1:07:39] commandment that you love one
[1:07:41] another as I have loved you greater love
[1:07:44] has no man than this that a man laid
[1:07:46] down his life for his friends and ye are
[1:07:49] my
[1:07:51] friends I'm glad he's friend enough to
[1:07:54] me to tell me what I need to hear
[1:07:56] here if you if you do whatsoever I
[1:07:58] command you you have not chosen me but I
[1:08:01] have chosen you he chose you when he
[1:08:05] knew you was in
[1:08:06] debt he chose you when he knew you
[1:08:09] couldn't pay your way out of debt he
[1:08:11] chose you when you was the darkest
[1:08:14] blackest covered up with sin sinner that
[1:08:17] could ever be but God rich in Mercy
[1:08:19] reached across your life and said Pay in
[1:08:24] for thank
[1:08:27] you have not chosen me but I've have
[1:08:29] chosen you and ordained you that you
[1:08:31] could go and forth and bring forth fruit
[1:08:33] and that your fruit shall remain that
[1:08:34] whatsoever you shall ask of the father
[1:08:36] in my name that he may give it to you
[1:08:38] these things I command you that you love
[1:08:41] one
[1:08:42] another Romans 13:8 says oh no man
[1:08:45] anything but to love one
[1:08:49] another for he that loveth another hath
[1:08:52] fulfilled the law for this Thou shalt
[1:08:54] not commit adul ulter Thou shalt not
[1:08:56] kill Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not
[1:08:59] bear false witness covet not covet or
[1:09:02] are there any other commandment is
[1:09:03] briefly comprehended and saying this
[1:09:05] namely that thou shalt love thy neighbor
[1:09:07] as thyself love worketh no ill to his
[1:09:10] neighbor therefore love is the
[1:09:12] fulfilling of the law and that knowing
[1:09:15] the time and now is that now is high
[1:09:17] time to wake out of sleep and now is our
[1:09:19] Salvation nearer than we believe the
[1:09:21] night is far spent the day is at hand
[1:09:23] let us therefore cast off the works of
[1:09:26] darkness what's the works of darkness he
[1:09:29] just wrote it right out amen not
[1:09:31] forgiving one another the works of
[1:09:34] darkness and let us put on the armor of
[1:09:36] light let us walk honestly as the day
[1:09:38] not in rioting and drunkenness or
[1:09:40] chamber or walting is not a Strife for
[1:09:42] him but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:09:45] and make not pro Provisions for the
[1:09:47] flesh to fulfill the lust thereof 1
[1:09:50] Thessalonians 4:9 says but as touching
[1:09:52] brotherly love you need not that I write
[1:09:54] unto you for you yourselves are taught
[1:09:56] of God Amen not a man of God to love one
[1:10:05] another 1 Peter 1 and verse 22 seeing
[1:10:08] you have purified your souls and obeying
[1:10:11] the truth of the spirit and the
[1:10:12] unfeigned love of the Brethren see that
[1:10:14] you love one another with pure heart
[1:10:18] fervently uhoh it ain't just a
[1:10:21] half-hearted love well I got to love him
[1:10:23] I guess cuz he goes to church with me
[1:10:26] me that's not what the word
[1:10:29] says an unfeigned love amen heart that's
[1:10:34] fervently outpouring of love cuse being
[1:10:37] born again not of corruptible seed but
[1:10:39] Incorruptible by the word of God which
[1:10:40] alive liveth and abideth forever 1 John
[1:10:43] 3:11 so for this is the message that you
[1:10:46] heard from the beginning that we should
[1:10:47] love one
[1:10:49] another not as Cain who was the Wicked
[1:10:52] one who slew his brother were why what
[1:10:54] what what slew a SL what happened
[1:10:57] because of
[1:10:59] resentment cuz he resented what God did
[1:11:02] in his heart in his offering but not in
[1:11:05] his and here he said I brought my best
[1:11:08] brother I'm giving everything I
[1:11:10] got but that's not all that God required
[1:11:14] God required
[1:11:16] blood but when God come down and and
[1:11:19] visit him he said if you'll do as your
[1:11:21] brother Abel did you'll also be
[1:11:23] accepted can you see the mercy of
[1:11:25] almighty
[1:11:27] God to look right straight at serpent
[1:11:30] seed and say if you'll do just like this
[1:11:32] you'll also be
[1:11:38] accepted so if you feel that you might
[1:11:41] be serpent seed there's still Mercy for
[1:11:44] you there's still Grace for you that's
[1:11:47] right there's still a god who's calling
[1:11:49] out to you if you'll do as these have
[1:11:51] done you shall also be accepted
[1:12:00] marble
[1:12:02] not my brethren if the world hates you
[1:12:05] we know that we know that we have passed
[1:12:07] from death into life because we love the
[1:12:10] Brethren Oh I thought it's because we
[1:12:12] had Miracles no it's because we have
[1:12:13] love the greatest of all these is
[1:12:16] love
[1:12:19] amen he said pass from Death to life
[1:12:22] because we love the Brethren he that
[1:12:23] loveth not his brother abideth in death
[1:12:25] whosoever hateth his brother is a
[1:12:30] murderer wow and you know that no
[1:12:33] murderer has eternal life abiding in him
[1:12:35] hereby perceive we the love of God
[1:12:38] because he's laid down his life for us
[1:12:40] we ought to also lay down our lives for
[1:12:42] the brethren for whoo hath the words
[1:12:45] world's goods and see the brother have a
[1:12:47] neede and shth up his bowels of
[1:12:49] compassion with himself how dwelleth the
[1:12:51] love of God in him my little children
[1:12:53] let us not love in word neither in
[1:12:55] tongue but also in deed and
[1:12:58] Truth beloved if God so loved us we
[1:13:01] ought to also love one another no man
[1:13:03] has seen God at any time if we love one
[1:13:06] another God dwells in us and his love is
[1:13:08] perfected in us
[1:13:13] hallelujah second John 1 says the the
[1:13:16] Elder unto the elect lady and her
[1:13:18] children whom I love in the truth and
[1:13:21] not only I but also all they that have
[1:13:24] known the truth for the truth whose sake
[1:13:25] what dwelleth in US shall be with us
[1:13:27] forever Grace be unto you mercy and
[1:13:28] peace that God from God the Father for
[1:13:30] the Lord Jesus Christ the son of the
[1:13:32] father in truth and love I Rejoice
[1:13:34] greatly that I found my children walking
[1:13:36] in truth and received amen a commandment
[1:13:39] from the father now beseech thee lady
[1:13:42] not as though I wrote a new commandment
[1:13:44] unto thee but that which we had from the
[1:13:46] beginning that we love one another so I

[1:13:52] scripture am me love brother br like

[1:16:56] cuz we're in the last days where the
[1:16:57] Bible exhorted us the much more as we
[1:17:00] see that day approaching to love one
[1:17:02] another with Christian love and divine
[1:17:04] love to assemble ourselves in Heavenly
[1:17:06] places in Christ Jesus this will all men
[1:17:08] know you are my disciples that you have
[1:17:11] love one for the
[1:17:14] other and if the brother you think he's
[1:17:16] a little wrong or sister Lord
[1:17:19] don't say just say Lord don't let me
[1:17:22] ever have a root of bitterness spring up
[1:17:24] because it'll affect him and it'll take
[1:17:27] the Christ right out of my life that
[1:17:30] poison acid of malice and jealousy and
[1:17:32] hatred that'll just take the Holy Spirit
[1:17:34] right away from you it'll run you from
[1:17:36] the him from the Tabernacle here it'll
[1:17:38] kill the spirit of God or drive it away
[1:17:40] from here hurt your pastor do everything
[1:17:43] don't let that happen you wax that much
[1:17:45] closer together move right on up closer
[1:17:47] to one another love one another talk
[1:17:49] nice about one another say nice things
[1:17:51] about one another
[1:17:55] and then God will bless
[1:17:59] you brother brandom actually experienced
[1:18:01] this very personally when he went into
[1:18:03] that
[1:18:05] restaurant and there was this woman
[1:18:07] sitting over there with this cop and
[1:18:09] music playing he said he was standing
[1:18:12] there criticizing her and looking at her
[1:18:15] like how in the world oh grandma what's
[1:18:17] she doing here when that cop what's he
[1:18:19] probably out on his wife and what what
[1:18:21] what are they doing he's like Lord how
[1:18:23] can you why why don't you just wipe all
[1:18:25] this off just wipe it off get rid of
[1:18:30] it God said come over here for a
[1:18:33] minute pulls him over into a corner and
[1:18:35] he begins to see a
[1:18:37] vision of the sins coming from the earth
[1:18:41] and going up and striking striking
[1:18:45] him and he said he would have wiped it
[1:18:47] all off but there was a blood ban around
[1:18:49] it and he said I ask is this the sins of
[1:18:53] the world he he said no these are your
[1:19:01] sins
[1:19:03] ouch that
[1:19:05] pinches because we can see all the sin
[1:19:08] out
[1:19:09] there come on we can see all the sin out
[1:19:12] there and all the stuff that's around
[1:19:14] and all the stuff that's happening
[1:19:15] around us the the the the Leo DEA how
[1:19:18] it's become and and the lukewarmness and
[1:19:20] we can see all the hatred against God
[1:19:23] and the homos sexuality as it was in the
[1:19:26] days of Sodom and gomorra we see all of
[1:19:28] that but what about
[1:19:31] us well I can see this person's fault
[1:19:33] sure you can't I can see that person's
[1:19:35] fault but what about
[1:19:37] yours listen we don't come to church to
[1:19:40] expose everybody else's fault we come to
[1:19:42] church to see how I need to get right
[1:19:44] with God how I need to grow closer to
[1:19:47] God how I need to come and lay aside
[1:19:50] everything that's so easily beset me and
[1:19:52] press toward the mark of the High
[1:19:54] Calling
[1:19:56] amen but it changed his attitude from
[1:20:00] unforgiveness cuz what he had was
[1:20:02] unforgiveness he he's like Lord why you
[1:20:04] even putting up with this strike it
[1:20:07] off and when he realized what
[1:20:09] forgiveness was he said Lord please
[1:20:12] forgive
[1:20:13] me Lord let me have a heart for these
[1:20:16] kind of people and it changed everything
[1:20:19] Faith fell in amen and Faith came to a
[1:20:22] point where he could go over there and
[1:20:24] he you know what he did he actually said
[1:20:26] I want to talk to you just a moment I
[1:20:27] want to ask for your
[1:20:30] forgiveness come on somebody I want to
[1:20:33] ask that you forgive me because I was
[1:20:35] thinking things I shouldn't be thinking
[1:20:37] about you and he begins to un unload his
[1:20:39] heart and the spirit of God fell in and
[1:20:43] Faith arose from forgiveness so that
[1:20:46] woman could give her heart to
[1:20:48] God this is what we want Amen in the
[1:20:51] house of God we want forgiveness to take
[1:20:53] place so fath Faith Can rise healings
[1:20:56] can
[1:20:58] happen our prodical can come
[1:21:02] home
[1:21:06] beautiful we have those things in our
[1:21:08] lives God testing
[1:21:13] us he said when you get this spirit in
[1:21:17] you then the burdens of Life become
[1:21:19] light you don't even notice them the
[1:21:21] more the yolks line with the feathers it
[1:21:23] becomes so easy
[1:21:25] and then people may pile things on
[1:21:29] you they pile a lot of stuff on me they
[1:21:32] say a lot of bad things about me he said
[1:21:35] if you got this Spirit it'll be like
[1:21:37] Samson in the gates of
[1:21:39] Gaza you'll just pick them up and move
[1:21:42] them up the
[1:21:44] hill and put him right there at the foot
[1:21:46] of the
[1:21:47] cross and say Lord forgive my brother
[1:21:51] cuz he don't know what he does that's
[1:21:53] the same spirit Christ had I mean he
[1:21:55] just got whooped and beat and bloodied
[1:21:58] and spit on and Crown the thorns and
[1:22:00] what was his word last words out of his
[1:22:02] mouth father forgive
[1:22:04] them and they had already said let his
[1:22:07] blood be upon
[1:22:08] us father forgive them for they know not
[1:22:12] what they
[1:22:18] do you'll pack them right back to the
[1:22:20] straight to Calvary and there at Mount
[1:22:22] Calvary you'll lay them at the feet of
[1:22:24] Jesus and pray for your enemies who not
[1:22:28] with a grudge Lord if you'd bust them
[1:22:30] open right now direct quote just bust
[1:22:34] them right open but with something from
[1:22:36] your heart say dear God that man is a
[1:22:40] man like I am you see what's lacking in
[1:22:43] the church friends we what we need is to
[1:22:47] start it all over
[1:22:55] so it comes forgiveness is a a letting
[1:23:00] go it's letting go and let God have his
[1:23:06] way God might be using that very thing
[1:23:09] that that brother wronged you about to
[1:23:10] work something out in his
[1:23:15] life but Satan wants to turn it and make
[1:23:18] you angry about it and make you mad
[1:23:19] about it and get the church all stewed
[1:23:21] up about it listen it's time we start it
[1:23:23] all over
[1:23:25] say father you forgive me let me forgive
[1:23:29] others amen as he said in this prayer
[1:23:32] amen father Thou Are Who Art Thou in
[1:23:34] heaven Hallowed be thy name and he says
[1:23:36] as as you forgive us let us forgive
[1:23:41] others
[1:23:43] forgive Let It Go some have carried
[1:23:47] burdens for years and it's crippled them
[1:23:50] in their Spirit not only the spirit it's
[1:23:52] also crippled them in their body amen
[1:23:54] science I could have brought it science
[1:23:56] talks about they talk about how that
[1:23:58] bitterness and resentment and anger and
[1:24:00] for unforgiveness actually actually
[1:24:02] bruises cells in your body and it causes
[1:24:04] all kind of
[1:24:07] issues so you are the one that's in the
[1:24:12] prison he said the only thing we have to
[1:24:15] do he said when you're placed in the
[1:24:18] body of Christ to Sons and Daughters you
[1:24:20] don't have to Knuck down to the devil
[1:24:23] knuckle down is what he say you don't
[1:24:24] have to knuckle down to the devil we
[1:24:26] have a law and that law is the Holy
[1:24:28] Spirit the only thing you have to do is
[1:24:31] to know how to let go and let
[1:24:34] God Amen let go and let God but you keep
[1:24:37] fighting it and it won't never work but
[1:24:39] if you'll let go and let God that's all
[1:24:43] there is to it he said the fish said
[1:24:44] wait I I'll catch my breath and it be
[1:24:46] good I I'll breathe up but I'll breathe
[1:24:49] up a little oxygen in me and I'll see if
[1:24:50] I can go down no he doesn't do that
[1:24:52] he'll burst open bird say I'll see how
[1:24:53] fast I can run down here maybe I'll take
[1:24:55] off no he won't do that he'll fall down
[1:24:57] there's a law that controls him and he
[1:24:59] said it's the same way with us if we it
[1:25:02] isn't what how we fight and Pull and
[1:25:04] hurry oh if I don't do this if this
[1:25:06] happens and I got this problem it's not
[1:25:09] that it's to know that the law of life
[1:25:12] is in
[1:25:13] you and you just let go and let God
[1:25:17] beautiful you just let go and let God
[1:25:20] then he takes you to your healing he
[1:25:24] takes you to your baptism of the spirit
[1:25:26] he takes you anything that's promised he
[1:25:28] will take it take you to it if you let
[1:25:31] go and let God have his
[1:25:38] way but
[1:25:40] let but the way you he said but the way
[1:25:43] you do you let Satan just get away with
[1:25:45] it all the doubt and
[1:25:49] everything begins to come in ad had
[1:25:53] accumulate accumulate late we got this
[1:25:55] big old baggage we carrying for years
[1:25:58] it's weighing us down and weighing us
[1:26:01] down we're so crippled up in our spirit
[1:26:04] that we can't even enjoy the
[1:26:08] present you know fathers many time ruin
[1:26:11] relationships with their son because of
[1:26:13] what happened in the
[1:26:15] past instead of breaking Cycles we're
[1:26:19] called to be cycle Breakers
[1:26:21] right ain't it something that we can
[1:26:23] preach a message of forgiveness in an
[1:26:25] hour of
[1:26:27] unforgiveness there's more hate in this
[1:26:29] world there's more bitterness in this
[1:26:31] world there's more malice in this world
[1:26:33] there's more unforgiveness in this world
[1:26:35] he man just go out and have a little
[1:26:37] bump in the run or some little bump
[1:26:38] against somebody and see what happens
[1:26:41] people get angry and mad used to be I
[1:26:43] didn't hurt nothing have a nice
[1:26:47] day and Satan's building it such a way
[1:26:50] that he's trying to make it to where you
[1:26:52] can't even hardly be nice to anybody no
[1:26:54] more more what you mean brother Tim well
[1:26:56] just the other day I I I actually
[1:26:58] stopped by Brother Tims picked up a
[1:26:59] trailer and empty trailer was taking it
[1:27:01] out to the house and and I come over
[1:27:03] this hill and there's this young boy on
[1:27:04] a motorcycle standing and he just kind
[1:27:06] of waved at me I just looked at wonder
[1:27:08] if he's wonder if he's got problems need
[1:27:10] some help I D well I can't turn around
[1:27:13] here and I'm driving I said well I know
[1:27:15] where spot to turn around but you know
[1:27:16] by the time I got up there think man
[1:27:18] this guy might mug
[1:27:22] me hey you know tell them what this guy
[1:27:25] do got my wife in here I
[1:27:30] I but I was like no I don't believe that
[1:27:33] and I just cast that stuff aside and I
[1:27:35] turned around went back down and I said
[1:27:39] young man you need some help he said yes
[1:27:41] sir he said I just bought this
[1:27:42] motorcycle and he's about five I don't
[1:27:44] know three or four miles from the the U
[1:27:47] fire station there on on germant toown
[1:27:50] and he said I I I I I live up by that
[1:27:52] fire station he said I bought this
[1:27:53] motorcycle and somebody put the wrong
[1:27:55] gas in it and I was trying to work on it
[1:27:57] and I traded it and just a young boy
[1:27:59] trying to do something and he said uh
[1:28:01] you you wouldn't mind giving me a ride
[1:28:03] would you I said no I'd knocked that I
[1:28:05] had you it's your lucky day I got a
[1:28:08] trailer we pulled the trailer up he said
[1:28:10] well do you happen to have some straps I
[1:28:12] said it's your lucky day two
[1:28:15] times we laughed we put straps on that
[1:28:18] and dropped him off but Satan has fed
[1:28:20] this world with so much
[1:28:23] hate and fear and worry used to that
[1:28:27] wasn't nothing you do that at any time
[1:28:28] just see somebody pick them up you won't
[1:28:30] do it no more why CU it's a world of
[1:28:34] unforgiveness it's a world of hate and
[1:28:36] bitterness and hatred and people mad
[1:28:39] want to kill somebody because of
[1:28:41] something that happened to them lost
[1:28:43] their
[1:28:45] minds God don't let that thing sneak in
[1:28:48] our
[1:28:49] Spirits into our churches where're we're
[1:28:51] willing to kill somebody I'm not
[1:28:53] literally talking about taking a gun and
[1:28:55] God help us taking a gun bringing it to
[1:28:57] the Church of God and shooting somebody
[1:28:59] but I'm talking about using that
[1:29:00] bitterness and that fear the bullets
[1:29:02] that Satan gave you and shooting it out
[1:29:05] and it catches somebody else and it
[1:29:07] catches somebody else and it kills
[1:29:09] people around
[1:29:15] us what we need to do is start
[1:29:20] over let the musicians come
[1:29:31] by if you would mind bow your heads for
[1:29:33] a moment
[1:29:57] coming into this Christmas
[1:30:01] season it's kind of contemplated today
[1:30:04] you know why would you preach two
[1:30:07] services like this coming into
[1:30:10] Christmas
[1:30:12] why why would you speak things like this
[1:30:18] [Music]
[1:30:24] Christmas as we believe is not just not
[1:30:27] about gifts in a tree or nothing like
[1:30:30] that but his brother Brandon would say
[1:30:33] put Christ back in Christmas and to
[1:30:36] remember what he'd
[1:30:39] done how he came down and became
[1:30:43] lowly became a footwash
[1:30:48] flunky the king of
[1:30:50] Heaven would kneel down and wash
[1:30:54] feet dirty
[1:30:58] feet but more than that he came down and
[1:31:01] he took
[1:31:03] dirt grime of the devil that devil had
[1:31:06] piled upon your
[1:31:08] life and by the spilling of that blood
[1:31:10] that blood can wash over you and wash
[1:31:13] every bit of that Grime away
[1:31:20] [Music]
[1:31:26] I don't

[1:31:45] special the greatest gift that you could
[1:31:48] ever receive as a gift of eternal
[1:31:51] life that gift was wrapped

[1:31:55] cell virgin
