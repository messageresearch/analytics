[Music] When hope is just a distant thought, you take my pain [Music] and you lead me to the cross. What love is this? That you gave your life for me [Music] and made a way for me to know you. And I confess you're always enough for me. You're all I need. I look to you. I see the scars upon your head and hold the truth that when I can't, you always can. And standing here beneath the shadow of the cross, I'm overwhelmed that I keep finding open arms. What love is this? That you gave your life for me and made a way for me to know you.

What love is this that you gave your life for me [Music] and made a way for me to know you. And I confess you're always enough. love for me. You're all I need. [Music] [Applause]
