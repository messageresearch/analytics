spend the week amen with some of the different uh Believers here and and just has uh have just really received such a blessing amen amen to come I trust that the word that we spoke Wednesday was an encouragement to you amen and that the Lord Jesus encouraged your heart amen and said something amen that could help you along your your journey amen we're almost home friends my goodness I'm so glad to say that I we're almost home it won't be much longer amen now the world is falling apart amen and it's breaking apart at the seam seems like every day you turn on the the news or you click into anything that you can read and the world is just living under prophecy that that that a prophet prophesied and said I prophesy to you the world will go completely insane aren't you glad that in the midst of an insane world we have the mind of Christ amen the sanity of the word of God Amen and that's our stability it's our strength amen it's our it's our Rock it's our high tower it's our Fortress amen and the world can get you know so weary sometimes but David said when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to a rock that is higher than I amen and we have that today God bless you amen Judges chapter 17 and verse 6 we're just going to read amen just a few portions of scripture here actually just this one verse and I'll have you be seated I want to minister to you today and I and the Lord even before I came um uh here this this week this for this Sunday service um I thought I would Minister this and and wasn't really sure and then the it worked out where my my father was supposed to be here but we had a death there uh with one of the families at the church and so he had to be there and so the Lord has me here today so I'm just a spare tire fill in so amen now I see brother Joe is not here today so um someone is going to need to take that Amen Corner Spot amen because that's a big void right there so uh you don't let it be a void today you pull on that spot and and if maybe you'd have Haven done that before well you just you you can't be brother Joe but uh you could pull on the word of God Amen praise the Lord Judges chapter 17 but I I want to minister to you I knew the Lord would have me thought the Lord would have me speak this and so he just confirmed it so much to me I'm going to title this called out of judges and into Ruth called out of judges and into Ruth Judges chapter 17 and verse 6 in those days there was no king in Israel and every man did that which was right in his own eyes let's read that again in those days there was no king in Israel and every man did that which was right in his own eyes you'll actually find this and I don't want to take time to have you turn but if you go to chapter 18 chapter 19 chapter 20 I think it's 21 he actually can continues to repeat this message in those days there was no king in Israel and every man did that which was right you see what typifies judges is the same thing that types our age that we live in a world to where there's no King and so everybody does whatever they want to do and whatever they think is right and they've redefined and redefined and and now they're not following any absolute you see when you don't have an absolute you become your own absolute and so the pattern of Judges was a a a pattern to where there was no King every man did that which was right in his own eyes and he just did whatever he wanted to do and you'll find this repeated over and over and over turn to Joel chapter 2 if you have your Bible man we have um some slides and I will'll have those just in a moment but I just want to read a couple scriptures before we have you be seated very familiar scripture Joel chapter 2 and let's just begin reading at verse 28 and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh somebody say all all I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see Visions it sounds like to me that nobody is exempt from this promise that God not only had a promise for the young men but also for the old men not just for the sons but also for the daughters and this promise that he makes in Joel chapter 2 is a promise of restoration that afterward I will pour out my spirit Lord Jesus father we just bow our heads in your presence together giving you Lord complete control Lord Jesus I have many things that I have weighing upon me many directions that I feel pulled in Lord but I believe that you Above All Else Lord God have a word that you want to speak and so Lord I just want to say that I I'm just humbling myself before you now I become subservient Lord to your spirit to the anointing the unction Lord I pray God that you would help each one of us now Lord just pull out from you exactly what we need from the front to the back lord May there not be one of us Lord that is distracted or unfocused Lord but may you tune our hearts right now to synchronize Lord and to be sensitive to what your spirit wants to say Grant it loud Lord to the speaker to the audience Lord I pray that you would be lifted up Lord and may your name be lifted up we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen you can be seated this was the pattern of Judges it was actually a cycle that was going to repeat seven times I almost titled this sermon and it's a funny title but I almost titled this the circle and the line two shapes the circle and the line and the reason is is that you will find in the Book of Judges that judges is all a circle it's a repeating pattern it starts and then it then it it starts good and then it moves past into a cycle and then it repeats over and over and over and there's this constant message there was no King in other words there was no absolute there was no Authority there was no boundary that was just open-ended and and it was the condition that the modern Church would be prophesied to come in today again to where Jesus would say men would become lovers of their own self now that lover of your own self is a prophecy of the age you live in today and it's not that anybody is admiring the beauty of their own self or standing in the mirror and you know I none of us I hope none of us go and get in our bathroom and look at oursel and think oh my I just love myself so much quite the opposite but actually what it's speaking of is that men would become lovers of their own self to where human thought or rational idea would become exalted above the knowledge of the word of God and so this is the age that you live in that men would become their own absolute they would become their own own Compass they would become their own authority and because of this men would would literally exalt their their thinking and their ideas to replace the place of God this is the reason why we live in the information technology age even the Advent of the internet and blogs and social media and all of those things I'm not preaching against those things I'm just wanting you to get your spiritual thinking caps on today to realize that the world that you see its condition that it's in didn't just end up here this isn't just an accident but it's actually on time because this story that you're living is his story and so God's controlling everything he's controlling politics he's controlling econ the economic world the political world the all of the the the the pain the chaos that you see in the world is uh not by accident but it's actually right on time to where men would be exalt themselves and exalt their thinking and exalt their ideas it would be the age of man and the age of self to where men would be able to express themselves in such a way and and you think of the Advent of of a man of blogs and and you know and what they're thinking and what their ideas are it's been a great and some ways a great positive and some ways a great negative we've gotten so detailed today to where people want to let everybody know not just what they're thinking but what they ate that day uh what what they want to eat that day the mood that they're in if they're feeling up if they're feeling down if they're feeling happy if they're feeling sad and then they would post that on the world for the world to see because think about it friends it's an exaltation of self it's an exaltation of what your pain is or what you've suffered or what you've had to go through and we live in a world to where everybody's it's all so they are they are uh intoxicated with themsel listen uh we're to remember I preached on suffering on Wednesday night and I believe in all of that but let me just say you're not to become so self-focused on everything that you've went through in your life and fact the B Paul said that we may know him not to think about our own suffering but in the fellowship of his suffering and so the world would literally become a place of chaos because of this judges cycle to where there was no King there was no absolute there was no there was no ruler but men would become the lover of their their own self and I just want to say today that you live in the Fulfillment of that you're living literally in a world to where people exalt themselves what they think what their their what their ideas are and you live in a world of social media where things are constantly being given to you and constantly being pushed to you whether it's a notification whether it's a feed listen you know I just want to say something very simple have you ever noticed that your Instagram and your Facebook and your I'm going to get old here cuz I don't know all some of the new ones I thought a real was the same thing as be real and I found out that it's totally different and so uh uh I don't even know what be real is but I mean I'm really showing my age but let me just say this those things are caught a feed because they're feeding you something and many people don't realize you're feeding yourself with something and then you feed and you feed and you feed and you feed and you think my I feel imp I feel depressed I feel anxiety I I got so much listen I we more than ever before we live in an age where young people are feeling more anxiety and more these are demon Spirits we give them name but they're the names but they're just Demons of Oppression and and we're feeling D we're feeling depressed and and those things are real and anxiety and you're feeling fear do you realize I wonder sometimes the very thing that you want delivered from is the very thing sometimes if we'd be honest it's the very thing we're feeding all right and we feed upon those things and constantly thumbing going through it and going through it and ingesting it and constant you know what's amazing brother Aaron I have never one time turned on a tape and listened to a tape of God's prophet and ever ended the tape feeling depressed I have never one time opened my Bible and read my Bible Brother Sam and thought Oh I'm just so I got so much fear and so much anxiety and so much worry but how many times do we get on the news come on somebody do we get on our Facebook do we get on some kind of a feed and then we feel pressure we feel worried we feel stressed I think it's time we stop feeding on the wrong things and start feeding on the thing that gives us peace and joy and love and harmony oh friends let me just say if there was ever a generation where you need to hear from the voice of God and not hear from some worldly view it's today if there was ever a day where we need to hear the voice of God's Prophet it's not a day to listen l yes it's a day to listen more oh do we have a church that believes that today it's not time to quiet that voice it's a time to amplify that voice of God that speaks to you in your life and tells you not your uh you know not that you're not going to make it but it tells you you're going to make it child greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world so this was the the world that we would live in it would be a world that would be full of fear full of pressure full of stress full of anxiety and it would be a world that would go completely insane it's incredible when you look at this in Judges chapter 2 and if you have your Bible I have you turn quickly if you just want to turn there to Judges chapter 2 and I want you to notice because I want you to see the pattern here of judges and the cycle of this judges cycle as it goes because God is going to send them everything that they need to come conquer the land of Canaan they're going to have a prophet they're going to have Moses they're going to have the instructions not only that but further they're going to have a promise and God is going to come through this prophet and he's going to tell them I I I here's the instructions of what you're to do when you cross into the land of Canaan you're to drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you destroy all their pictures destroy all their images destroy all their high places and God says don't let any of them remain from among them and he says and if you allow those things to remain then they shall be Pricks in your eyes and thorns in your side Hall couldn't imagine things more painful than a thorn in my eye but God says through Moses through the prophet I want you to utterly destroy them I want you to completely drive them out and so then we pick it up in Judges chapter 1 and we see that through this through these instructions they have a promise they have a prophet and God says for behold I have given you the land to possess it you say well what more would they need here's the crescendo of the whole moment here's everything every reason that they left Egypt as going to Climax and Crescendo at this moment in Canaan yet when you go and read your Bible in Judges chapter 1 outside of Caleb you'll find that the Bible says Manasseh didn't drive out all the inhabitants of bethen and her town and tanic and her towns and the inhabitants of eam and and her towns it moves on to Asher and it says neither did Asher drive out all the inhabitants from the land but he allowed the iron chariots to stay in the valley he could never get Victory he got Victory here but he could never fully get Victory here and then you move on to Nepali and the Bible records that Nepali didn't get total Victory it goes through all of the potential all of those men now notice this is the judge of cycle it was a cycle to where there was moments of Victory moments of great Revival moments of things to Rejoice over great battles and great things to you know that God sent but with mixed in with those great victories was great defeat and in fact it would be those valleys and mountains and those ups and those downs and God says because you didn't completely drive out because you didn't completely have Victory God says now those things things which you let remain shall be Pricks in your eyes and thorns in your sides and shall Vex you in the land wherein you dwell it's incredible because this pattern actually repeats over and over and God then sends an angel in Judges chapter 2 can we read it together in Judges chapter 2 it says in verse one an angel of the Lord came up from gilg God of bokam said I made you to go up out of Egypt I brought you into the land which I swore to your father and said I will never break my Covenant you shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land you shall third on their altars and notice this here but you have not obeyed my voice and God says why have you done this and you shall make no leak you shall throw down their altars wherefore I also said I will not drive them out from before you but they shall be as thorns in your sides and their gods they're Gods lowercase G O DS and their gods shall be a snare or a trap unto you the Bible says that when the a angel of the Lord spoke these words that all of the people lifted up their voice and wept and they called the name of the notice this is a great rebuke from the Lord it was such a let down after such potential after such a promise after such a victory notice every reason the whole reason God brings them out of Egypt into this land is not to fall short and the Bible says they lifted up their voices and wept and they called the name of that place bokeum and they sacrificed there unto the Lord now what's incredible as you keep going through Judges chapter 2 as you find that the Bible says when Jacob Joshua I'm sorry it let the people go that the children of Israel went every man to his own inheritance to possess the land and the Bible says this verse here in verse seven and the people serve the Lord all the days of Joshua the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua and all of the notice and the days of the elders that outlived Joshua who had seen all the great works of the Lord and Joshua the son of nun died being 110 years old they buried and also all now notice this you say well what happened I thought God made a promise here was this great Wicked here was this great word and this great curse that was going to come but I want you to notice actually it was not the generation of fathers but it was the generation of sons and I'm preaching to you today on this and we read it out of Joel chapter chapter 2 because I want to show you the powerful correlation between a father and a son because it was actually not going to be Joshua but it was or that entire generation but actually the scripture goes on and says they serve the Lord they live for the Lord say well I guess we dodged a bullet I guess we got by I mean here God made this all this word it was going to come to pass and it shall be thorns in your enemies but I think we did okay guys the whole generation and all the others they're they're buried everything looks good I mean but notice what it says keep reading here in verse 8 and verse 9 they buried him in verse 10 and also all that generation were gathered under their fathers and there arose another generation after them which knew not the Lord nor yet The Works which he had done for Israel and the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord and served balum they forsook the Lord God of their fathers which brought them out of the land of Egypt and followed other lowercase gos gods of the Gods of the people that were round about them and bowed themselves unto them and provoke the Lord to anger incredible because the curse was not going to come upon the fathers though it was the fathers because of their incomplete Victory come on somebody don't let me lose you here because of their inability to get victory in their own life because of something about their testimony because of something that they allowed in their life in their home and it was not necessarily going to affect them but it was going to have a great impact upon their children in so much that the Bible says they forsook God they they they the Bible says that they went went on and got the anger of the Lord it was hot against them and so you see what happens here is that pattern of Judges that cycle of Revival and death that cycle of good and then bad and then good and then bad begins to take place and the Bible says in verse 14 The Anger of the Lord was hot against them and he delivered them into the hand of spoilers he sold them into the hand of their enemies so that they can not longer no longer stand before their enemies whereever they went the hand of the Lord was against them notice verse 16 nevertheless the Lord raised up judges now these judges are not judicial don't think of that word in litiga in kind of some kind of judicial way but actually this was an actual dispensation because Israel is going to be ruled by prophets by judges by Kings Prophet priest and King but this is the period of Judges where God was going to raise up men and the Bible actually says says that these men are are not judicial judges but it's actually the word Savior and so these men were going to become saviors to the people they were going to become lights they were going to become a message of hope that we're going to be a deliverer because Samson is called he shall begin to deliver Israel he shall begin to save the people out of the hand of their oppressors you following me today and so God sends them judges and the Bible says notice this about these judge nevertheless the Lord raised up judges I delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them and yet they would not hearken unto their judge they went a whing after other gods verse 17 they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in obeying the Commandments of the Lord but they did not so and when the Lord raised them up judges then the Lord was with that judge notice the pattern when the Lord raised up a judge Lord was with him and they delivered them out of the hand of their Philistines all the days of the judge all the days of the judge and it came to pass verse 19 that when the judge was dead that they returned and corrupted themselves more it is so amazing to me how many times I've watched this pattern in real life to where God will take a man you can call him a patriarch a pillar of a family a pastor maybe a mother and that man will have a strong testimony a strong conviction might even preach the message of the hour and all the days while that man is alive the grandchildren are good the children look good a family looks together they they that the Anchor Point it's amazing when you study what people are really anchored to because as long as that man is alive as long as he has passion as long as he's preaching the message as long as he's contending for the truth then the family the sons and the daughters and the church and and the grandchildren and and and the Anchor Point is in their life and as long as that man serves the Lord they serve God but if they're anchored to that man and not Christ the word then when that Anchor Point is removed out of their life it's like a boat floating down the tide without an anchor and after a while you know it seems like it's okay big deal but then you sit in that boat I've been in the Bufford River long enough and the anchor came loose and you didn't realize it at first but then slowly they start to drift and they start to drift and they start to drift a little at a time the dress changes their manner of dress their attitudes their behavior and you notice that that Anchor Point that pillar that has been removed out of their life is now removed and then before you know it they Flo and they Flo and they but what was what what what for years they sat in church for for years they they they I said it appeared visually on the outside listen friends if I could just preach this here today let me just get straight to my point today it is not enough to be anchored to a papa or a far a mother or an Earthly testimony or the stories of yesterday uh you've got to be anchored to Christ you've got to be anchored to the word uh let's let our our young people and our churches not have the experience of of what a pastor has that's wonderful but I say God give our people the real baptism of the Holy Ghost let the anchor be anchored to Christ the word and I'm not talking about Christ just a story of Jesus because that won't hold you oh I'm just going to go ahead and preach here I said not just a story well yeah just get them to Jesus and people love to quote that and say we're preaching the message and the message and we need to preach Christ listen I'm all for preaching Christ but which Christ are you talking about I'm not just talking about a story of Christ of a good man who was nice and kind and humble and listen you learn all that in Bible in Bible study in Sunday school and you say brother man is there anything wrong with that there's not but the Bible says that the letter kth so it's not enough just to know about the message it's not enough just to know the let me quote a prophet we didn't come together to talk about the message we didn't we didn't come together just to preach about it we come to get under it because the message is not doctrines and books and tapes and stories it's Christ revealed in his own word I notice as that judge lived they served the Lord but then after that pepo died and then suddenly now for a while they look good and then eventually poof they're gone and you think what happened I'm going to tell you what happened the cycle of Judges they had never came out of you see judges was actually patterned this way to where that cycle of Revival would repeat seven times it's not an accident I don't believe for one moment that it was actually through seven times God would s in this pattern of Revival and then death he would send them men and and you could go to the slides brother if you want to he would send them men like the king of Jericho would be an oppressor so he'd send an oel he'd send a king of Moab and so God would send an Ehud it send the ammonites and so God would send a shamgar it send the amalekites and so there was a Deborah and a barck he'd send the Philistines Satan would come and and attack them so God would send them a Gideon this is the second uh slide there you can display if you'd like thank you that's behind me thank you so he would send them a Gideon you know the story of Gideon you know the story of shamgar you know the story of the of Samson what was it that every time the enemy come rushing in God would raise up a deliverer God would raise up a standard every time the dtin friends s Satan has never one time been ahead of God but God has always been 10 steps ahead of of the devil and every time Satan would come into the church with oh you know brother Bron would preach that about the ages when he would come with a white horse and he would come with a black horse he'd come with a a red horse God would raise up an anointing that would come upon a messenger and that messenger would be the the the defender or the the anointing that would that would meet the challenge of that day but those people under that message would come under the anointing of the messenger's anointing and they would meet the challenge of their generation oh in the days of the Dark Ages God would raise up an ox he would raise up a lion he would raise up a a man but let me just say what was those those were spirits of defenses and and and and that God would send upon men and it would defeat the Devil for their Generation Well let me tell you you don't have the anointing of an ox today you don't even have the anointing of a of a man of human intellect and you're going to outsmart the devil but God sent a message when an anointing of a mighty eagle and that eagle is your anointing today to rise above all of Lady oia to rise above all of the that the fear and the pressure and the anxiety God would send a message and it would anoint that people notice this here the story of Gideon and the story of Samson listen to what brother bham says today during the time of Judges the first thing there come I think I got that right he says when Israel got away from God when they did the water supply was withheld and when the people notice get away from God today the water supply is withheld and all the other blessings will be withheld the prophet says Now history keeps repeating itself I want you to notice some of these themes here because in judges it was going to repeat seven times and through those ages can we say it was going to be a cycle a cyclic circle of repeating and repeating and repeating the prophet says history keeps repeating itself in the generation of Israel we see revival can I take this off we see Revival in one generation only to see the fires fading in the next and in the third Embers may be glowing slightly but in the fourth there may be no vestage of that or whatsoever of that original flame you say then what does God do he just lights the fire again and then the same process is repeated the fervent desire you say brother Matt what are some of the the things that begin to fade in that cyclic pattern the fervent desire to please God the passion to know his word the fervency the passion oh we can preach all day about ages and I could preach about churches and we but how about we just preach about oursel here today for a moment because when you're called in that judge's cycle it's a cycle of Good Times highlights revivals but mixed in with that is defeat the fervent desire to please God the passion to know his word the cry for reaching out in the spirit all begins to fade and instead of that church being on fire with the fire of god notice it has cooled off and became a bit formal this is the pattern of Judges it's the cycles of revivals and then death of high times good times and then it would repeat and he says that is what was happening back there to the Ephesians that second generation coming on was just like Israel they demanded the king to be like other nations and when they did that they rejected God but they did it anyway notice what the prophet of God says here that is the history that is the circle that is the cycle of the church and it isn't long until you see them stop doing things they wouldn't used to do you mean it's that simple to decipher if my Revival is dying yet it's that simple they stop doing things they used to do do and they start doing things they would not do initially isn't it incredible I'm just reading you right out of the Ephesian Church age they changed their manner of dress ah so you mean how we look and how we dress says something about where our Revival is their attitudes and their behavior notice they get laxed that's what Ephesus means means relaxed and drifting and listen what a prophet says that second generation notice that cycle of Revival and death has never failed and notice that pattern in judges would actually repeat seven times I want you to see this that I Illustrated I wrote I just did this quickly because this is the cycle of judges in those days there was no King and every man did that which was right right in his own eyes there was compromise there was there and notice what it would it would lead to always it would start with sin and then sin always always always leads to slavery sin always leads to bondage and you know sometimes bondage doesn't look like bondage I'm not talking about just your hand are chained up and tied up incarcerated in prison a lot of people are in prisons of their own mind and Visually outwardly externally looks like no bondage at all and a lot of people get in bondage in their own mind when they can't believe the listen you're in a bondage in your own mind the devil's got you in prison when you can't believe the promises of God are for you and the devil will put somebody in bondage in their own mind to say that God surely God couldn't do that did that for them but he couldn't do that for me it's bondage yes and it would lead from sin to slavery and then repentance and then Deliverance but guess what it'd go right back into sin when that judge would die and then that sin would lead to more slavery and then it would go to repentance and then it would be deliverance and then it would go back to sin and then it would go to repentance and our slavery then it would go to repentance then it would go to deliverance and this is a lot how people's lives who've never really came out of judges yes and their life is a repeating pattern can I preach to you today and they go in circles and they go in circles and they go in circles and life becomes just a circle just a loop I know we've we've preached on this before but I'm just going to go in and do it again people are like that in their lives when they get away from God their life just becomes a wondering Circle and they go around and around and around and around the roundabout and and they go around you know like a roundabout like a traffic circle y'all got those around here and you know that you know the purpose of that roundabout is to get off it's not to go around and around and around and around but people go in that roundabout of life and they you know they grow up and then they get in that cycle to where they get a job they go to work they come home from work they say hello to the family then they veg on entertainment then they go to bed then they wake up they go to work they work eight hours they come home say hello to the family then they get on YouTube or whatever their Outlet is and then they veg and then they go to bed then they wake up and then they go to work and then they work eight hours then they come home then they greet their family they veg on entertain then it's Sunday so they go to church on Sunday then they go right back to the same cycle and then they go to CH go to work on Monday work eight hours come home greet the family and and then veg on entertainment and then then go to then it's Wednesday they go to church but then they go right back to the cycle come on somebody I'm preaching right at you right now and they go on that cycle and they do that for 60 years they retire and they hope to step off the roundabout about the same place they stepped on well let me just preach to you today your life is not about the roundabout that might be the life of your neighbor that might be the life of of other people but your life has a purpose God has called you he's ordained you to something and I say today get off of the roundabout get off of the circle and get on the line because you see the line is so different than the circle the line is so different than the linear line is so different than that cyclic life of patterns of repeated patterns over and over and it was going to be a little woman named Ruth who was caught up in that judge's cycle I want you to notice something so powerful about this little woman Ruth she came from the Book of Judges in fact if you go read the way that judges ends and you go look at the way that judges ends I I'm not going to do it today because it honestly would be hard to even preach to you in a mixed audience with different ages the way your Book of Judges ends it's complete chaos it's complete Carnage and murder and and and and and you have body parts of cut up people and being sent to other tribes these aren't I'm not reading you the story of Canaanites and heathens this is tribes of Jacob in so much that the tribe of Dan is is almost completely obliterated two tribes and and and and and this is how judges ends it in horror but do you want to know something so powerful about this little woman Ruth she was caught up in that same judge's cycle but she came out of it and just two miles two miles from where the end of Judges takes place as a little town called Bethlehem Judea and do you realize that that little woman's that little woman Ruth's life was going to completely The Narrative was going to be completely Rewritten in her life and that actually originally the Book of Judges and the Book of Ruth are not two books in fact if you go and pick up a Tanakh a Hebrew Bible Judges and Ruth are actually the same book you say brother Matt why is that powerful to you because your story doesn't end in judges in fact Ruth is the answer to the judges cycle Hallelujah it would actually be just two miles away you say what was different brother Matt everything was different about Ruth and judges though it was only separated by such a small distance yet the atmosphere was totally different because little Ruth was going to step into a lineage she was going to get off the circle and her life was going to enter a line of Boaz and it would be through that line that Boaz and Ruth's life would be connected with Jesus Christ you see with Christ it is not a circle of seven Church ages that would end in death but somebody would break the cycle and the pattern of the cycle of Revival and death Hallelujah listen friends we ain't ending in death we're ending in a Rapture of the go God's Church it will be a ly to Glory it would be that cycle that would repeat actually that would start all the way back in the days of the Kings now I want to show you something incredible in your Bible because actually it was going to be these cyclic patterns that would bring de that would bring destruction to the Kings of Israel even in your Bible turn to turn if you have it to 2 Kings chapter 12 I have it for you but if you have your your Bible turn there I want you to notice that actually it would be Solomon not David you see David was going to be the father of Solomon and then Solomon would have children and then their children would have children and the generations would begin to go and it wasn't going to be DAV but it was actually going to be Solomon that was going to bring in things into the worship in in the divinc worship that David never allowed in fact David would have never stood for but Solomon is going to begin to bring something in the people's lives from his concubines Heathen concubines and you would find in your Bible this thing called a high place and it was actually we' seen them when we were there last August in in in Israel and they would build a moat or they would build a great uh uh you know on top of a mountain and they would Worship the Lord on this high place you ever read that in your Bible and you C it that that that that that you know that he built the high place so they worshiped on the high place everybody ever read that in your scripture that actually wasn't from David but it actually was from Solomon and Solomon would bring in from his concubines he would bring in from these Canaanite wives the the these Foreigner foreign Nations I should say and they would bring in this way of worship that was mixed with div vinic worship and they would he would bring in these high places and it would affect generation after generation after generation now I'm sure that when he first brought it in I'm sure that when he first showed up to church with it people were thinking my goodness David would have never allowed that David would have certainly never stood for that but you know what is amazing you can let me say it the way that John Wesley stood it said it what one generation tolerates the Next Generation Embraces I said what one generation tolerates the Next Generation Embraces oh friends if we've ever seen that today it's it's if we ever seen a pattern of that in our world it's right now what what was at first egregious and no one could have imagined that we'd be confused on what as a boy and what as a girl and what bathroom to use but what one generation might get even might even think to themselves that shouldn't be going on but listen friends if no one ever takes a stand to cut the head off of that thing hello somebody it's it's okay you say well I was I was you know I was indignant but did you do something about it well I knew it shouldn't have been going on but what did you do about it because your silence makes you complicit with it and people could think like a lot who Bible the Bible brother bam said the sins of Sodom vexed his righteous soul but didn't have the backbone to say anything of it and to say anything against it and a lot of people are against it but do they have the backbone listen friends if we ever needed to cut and make the truth clear and bare knuckled clear and not dance around the way we say it or the way we quote it we listen we don't need to dress this gospel up we don't need to modernize this gospel we don't need to water it down we need to say it like a prophet said it and after a while you know eventually after a while well you know David wouldn't allowed it but then another time then then you know next Generation before you know it it's a staple in Hebrew worship and those cycles that that would affect that the family generationally would just repeat and repeat and repeat let's pick it up here in 2 Kings chapter 12 in the seventh year now the writer of Kings is going to always say something he's going to tell you the mother's name he's going to tell you how old he was he's going to tell you how many years he served and then he's going to tell you something most important he's going to say one of two things this King did that which was right in the sight of the Lord or it's going to say this King did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord in the seventh year of juu jehoash begin to Reign 40 years reigned he in Jerusalem and his mother's name was zebi BBA and joash did that which was right somebody say praise the Lord praise the Lord I want you to say that every time we read that let me read it again and joash did that which was right praise the Lord in the sight of the Lord all notice all his days wherein jhoda the priest instructed him you see the limitation as long as his priest as long as his Pastor come on somebody as long as that vessel that that that pillar was in his life he did that which was right all his days when jeod the priest instructed him verse three but big notice this here but but he did that which was right praise the Lord but the high places were not taken away he did burn he he says the people still sacrificed and burn incense in the high places so the pattern continues go a little bit further to Second Kings chapter 14 notice in verse one of 2 Kings 14 in the second year of joash son of jeho King of of Israel reigned amiah the son of joash King of Judah he was 25 he began to Reign he reigned 29 years his mother's name was jeod of Jerusalem and he did that which was right the Lord praise the Lord he did that which was right notice the stipulation yet not like David his father his father wait a minute brother Tim did we just read that right his father his father was not David oh it's Father's Day ain't it notice the Bible is going to connect David his father and disconnect him from his Earthly father notice not like David his father he did according to all things as joash his father did you mean brother Aaron you can have two daddies two fathers well one day brother brandham says I realized I'm not the son of Charles and Ella brandham I might have had one father on Earth and that's a good thing and thank God for a Godly father but you've got to come out of that You' got to come out of that cycle of that Earthly father and be connected with your heavenly father notice here he did according to all things as joash his father did how be it for some reason the high places were not taken away as yet the people did sacrifice and burn incense on the high places ah let's go on further 2 Kings chapter 15 and the 27th year of jeroboam king of Israel began Azariah the son of amaziah King of Judah 16 years old he reigned this many years here's his mom's name verse three and he did that which was right Lord oh that was weak come on now praise the Lord he did that which was right praise the Lord according to all that his father amiah had done in other words as far as his father could go he could go but yet there was a governor placed upon his life to where as far as that father could go he could go but wherever the father couldn't go it seemed like it stopped his life and stuned his growth he did that which was right according to all that his father amziah had done and notice the very next thing it says save that the high places were not removed the people sacrificed and burned incense still owned the high places uh second king look at verse 32 of chapter 15 second year of Pica son of remaliah king of Israel began jothan the son of Uzziah king of Judah to rign 25 years old was he is his mom's name verse 34 and he did that which was right praise the Lord he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done how be it the high places were not removed isn't it incredible cycle after cycle after cycle after cycle of Revival but death good but mixed him with bad some victory but mixed him with a lot of defeat and as long as he could serve in the ways of his father he could go as far as his daddy went he could go as far as his family went but whatever kind of idioc secretes and little things that were bred into him naturally those things always bothered him in his life and it seemed like if a daddy was a cheater he would have a a tendency to cheat if his daddy had a problem with lying he'd have a tendency to lie it might have been a good man might have been a might have been a great man but always struggled with a little bit of dishonesty he was always limited by his father if his father was a was a was an abuser he might would be an abuser too I'm going to preach whether you get quiet or not I'm going to keep on preaching if his daddy if you know if his daddy had a temper he probably would have the same traits and tendencies in his life if his mama was a gossiper well then she would probably have the same trouble and battle the same struggle if the mama took her dress and you know it always was borderline and dressed on the edge of you know standards and you know was always really just the the the you know just living on the edge of modesty then those girls would battle the same exact thing if the father let me go further let me just say this to you if the father never really entered into true worship in spirit and freedom of the Holy Ghost then the children were always restricted by that same thing you can never lead a person to a place you've never been yourself and thinking about it and Desiring it and oh I wish my children would get free in the Holy Ghost well have you got free in the Holy Ghost all right now if the daddy was critical then most likely the kids would just ingest all of that criticism and then they would grow up to be little Min versions of their dad don't you realize this is the pattern of Judges so long as the judge lived they lived good but when the judge died wherever the Daddy went wherever the family went whatever the standard was it was the standard they withheld and they were always struggling and restricted by the cycle that he passed down for instance a few days ago I was caught in on a scene a little something going on there was a fine young man very fine boy listen to what brother brandham says here I'm going to skip this to make sure you get it fine young man very he was going with a little girl very fine little girl fine family little boy all of a sudden came up with some kind of an idea he just walked away he did something wrong to that little girl as much as promised her to do a certain thing they didn't do it instead of coming to the girl and apologizing like a gentleman should do notice it just wasn't in him he couldn't say I'm sorry it just wasn't in him to do it he a good boy has a good family has a good dad has a good mom but now he's struggling with this pattern notice what brother M says the father and mother called me to the scene and said we would desire to know what's wrong with our boy it's not easy to do so sometimes you're right brother bham it's not easy to do so but you must be truthful and honest right brother bam says he says therefore the boy notice how he divides this the boy was a Christian somebody say praise the Lord as far as a Believer he had repented Lord he was baptized come on Church he was a Christian he's a good boy he was repented he had baptized and had his position among Believers but yet had not received the baptism of the Holy Ghost no matter how much he thought he had you thinking you have and having it is two different things you might be able to try to say you have and you might be able to show some evidence some emotion but unless your life you mean it's not in some emotion no it's not it's good to have it but it's not in it brother Brandon what's the evidence of the baptism of the Holy Ghost love would have to be loveed brother brandom said it sounded good sounded good love and he said but the Holy Spirit showed me it's not love Christian Science has more fruits of the spirit than anybody and they deny the deity of Jesus Christ yeah then it must be some gift to speak in tongues or shout or fill it down or shout it down brother brand says I've seen the the the you know the witch doctors do that he says no matter how much you say then what is it brother Matt well let's let a prophet say it unless your life is vindicating what you're professing that's right you still hav't got no matter emotions no matter how much you jump run Sensations speak in tongues uh uh or shouting or whatever you might lay upon it and listen what brother random says which is all right I believe in all of that too but unless your life copes with your testimony that's why I said Wednesday night more than anything else your life needs to match the life of your lamb and with that lamb comes Joy it comes power it comes forgiveness it comes love somebody help me preach it comes it comes gentleness and meekness and Temperance and patience and with all of those fruits comes the power of the spirits of God it's all of it you say brother M which is it it's all of it we don't just need some of it we need all of it oh do just evening light believe today God don't just give me a fruit don't just give me a gift don't give me everything God that you have for me Lord I want all of it yeah unless your life copes you still haven't got it because the fruit of the spirit vindicates what you are just like fruit of any tree Jesus said by their fruits notice this young fellow's parents his mother is German I hope you're not German today out here but there's a strain in that family that is they'll just sit like a lot of people do when you're preaching to them they'll just sit you can talk to them they'll just stare you right in the face uhhuh they sure will sometimes God finally had to tell Jeremiah don't look at their faces you get discouraged sometimes sometimes y'all don't realize how much your faces have an effect on a preacher amen preachers he says they'll just stare at you right in the face they got this girl sister the mother of this boy is brother bandam says the mother of this boy or sister I've come down the street many a morning this young lady be sitting right out there and say good morning to you she'd just look at me I stop i' say sure a fine morning she'd just stand and look right at you an intelligent woman I'd say come up and see us some sometimes she'd just stand and look well the brothers are that way her father and mother's that way now the father of this boy is strictly an Irishman he he's high tempered strung that's his whole family's like that except one or the other out of the family converted now in this boy I love that statement right there now in this boy so now we know the mom now we know the dad that'll tell you a lot about the boy now in this boy father mother both of them Christians filled with the Holy Ghost and they have brought this young man theyve brought this young man up in the way of the Lord and now the young man is about 17 18 something something along there very fine kid he's been a real mod bu at home nice kid he's got a brother that's just vice versa the girl of the mother mother's family lives close to the Fine church and he says you know would they ever come over there no they they know it's right it's just not in them to do it to ask forgiveness or ask pardoning can you believe actually that's hard for some people it's hard for some people to say I'm sorry but do you know the power of asking for forgiveness I tell you what it can do sometimes it can break a curse that's been on a family for 30 years and I've watched it happen and he said they just don't have it in them they just won't do it it's just not in them now the genes and this father and the mother of this boy no matter how much they're converted in other words no matter how much the dad and mom are converted no matter how much they're converted Still Remains In the Flesh that's been in breed out to this boy therefore the boy has got a complex in him just like from his mother's family they are not forgiving they will not apologize that's where the boy stands now I said to the father no matter how much you've raised him up look at your family out of all of them drunks and fighting and shooting and cutting his brother Brandon's family speaking of cutting and family and so he says and so forth and he says now look at your family to the mother there are a bunch of people that sit there won't speak very independent very independent I said very independent I know y'all ain't got him in Louisiana but we got him in South Carolina so you forgive me while in case they stream I'll preach against them here just for a moment y'all just sit there and listen very independent you say oh well you know high high tempered and you know High Strung and unforgiving you know but they got the Holy Ghost and so that's that's just how I am you know that's just me and you know you know that's just you know it's just way my daddy was that's just the way I that's just the way I am you know it just it's just and it's amazing how many excuses we make for these little things in our own flesh and yet profess that we've got the life of the Lamb I believe you got it in your soul but you need to let it that that Soul take control of your spirit and your flesh and your mind and your temper and your personality listen friends God ain't going to stop shining that light on any part of your life he got in your soul but now he wants to change you one day he's going to change your body and the fact that he'll change your body is the fact that he can change every part of me I'm not from South Carolina you're not even from Louisiana in fact you're not an American you're not a German my Bible says whoever is in Christ is a new creature Hallelujah all things are passed away I don't care what was in your family or your daddy or your mama don't you say that's just me and that's just how I am God wants to change that part of you well you know I'm unforgiving but you know brother Adam says notice this here notice I said it's not you now look at your family to the mother set there won't speak independent in rever to religion I said I love how brother Bram says this but it's not you think about that you're the only one out of all of your sisters and brothers and you're sweet you're kind mind your forgiving what does that brother Bram says what does that your tree part of that family tree yet you Reed the Holy Ghost that's the thing that made you tender that's the thing that made you sweet it's not your people anymore it's your Christ that lives inside of you I said look at your family all of them drunks and so forth Moody High tempered High strong but you're not you're kind you're forgiving what is it the Holy Ghost you're no more what you are it's Christ inside of you oh I said now the same thing must happen listen friends I am not brother ROM said one day I was there as a little boy and he said I watch my mama and my daddy I'll party animals and I go home all night and party all night he said sometimes I'd lay there as a little boy and he says I'd lay on the top of the shed waiting for the music to die down waiting for the party to end he said I'd sit there with my hunting dog and he said and I'd weep and listen this is the kind of life our Prophet was in and he should have been a drunk just like him he should have been a party animal just like him he should have been an alcoholic just like him but what made the difference brother bam says I sat there in the woods and he says and I sat there with my HG and I cried and I cried and he said and he said one day he said I'd sit there through the winter and he said and the the you know the snow would be 2 feet deep and he said and one day I I was sitting there on that river bank and he said and it was summer I was fishing and he said I had my dog there and he said and I looked down and I thought my goodness you know it's amazing this same ground that is now like this was covered with snow one day and brother B says then I looked under and there was a little flower that popped up and brother Brandon says and I thought where'd you come from in other words how'd you get here prophet of God says there was snow over top of you but somehow that didn't stop you and I built a fire over top of you and you shouldn't have been here but somehow you're here yes sir oh and the devil put everything in the path of your life he might you might not have had the right daddy or the right Mama or the right family and Satan thought he' just knocked you out you shouldn't be here today brother bam says I thought Little Flower where'd you come from and he said I Heard a Voice speak to me and say you are not the son of Charles and Ella brandham Hallelujah but you're from above you've got another father and another kingdom and another mother oh friends it don't matter what the devil threw at you I say I am still here I am here by the grace Hallelujah I am here by the grace you shouldn't be in a church today pulling on the word of God but God took you out of judges and he put you in rof Hallelujah [Applause] [Music] Ruth didn't deserve to be there she should have died with the rest of the Book of Judges but God said you're not going to end in judges you're not going to end in a cycle of Revival and death but I'm going to connect you with Boaz and in Boaz it doesn't matter what your daddy did now I'm thankful for a good father but I'm so glad I met my heavenly father I'm so glad I met my heavenly father do you know what's so powerful and I don't don't have time to preach really can I just have just a few more minutes so powerful when you think of this father connection because it's going to represent the the it's going to represent a generation and a new generation a generation preceding and a generation arising and even David would say to pass the faith on down generation to generation we will not hide Psalms 38 these things from our children but we'll tell them another generation and another generation that they might know the works of God that they might set their hopes in the god of their fathers and it's amazing because this father knows he doesn't want to pass down the wrong things brother Aon he knows as we just read in judges that it's up to him to break the cycle that it's up to him to not just live from the defeat of yesterday but that that God is going to do something new for him and that he cannot just walk in the ways of yo I didn't even say it let me just thank you Lord for reminding me do you realize you go just right after this you go right after this and what you'll find is a king named Hezekiah he was no different than the rest of the Kings you say brother Matt what was different about this man he had a daddy he had a mother he reigned this many years here's his mom's name he did that which was right but notice the difference in Hezekiah according to all his father David yeah oh Hallelujah you say brother Matt what was the difference he removed the high places what was it it wasn't going to connect him with his Earthly father but he was going to walk in the ways of David his father you say brother Matt what was it going to represent what was it going to say what was it going to be representative of I'm going to tell you what it was going to represent it was going to repres present that it doesn't matter what your past was it doesn't Define your future it doesn't matter what your ancestors were it doesn't matter what what the family before you did God can take you and break generational curses and shatter the power of the devil in your life but very much like a father can pass the wrong things the father can also pass the right things and a good father father and a father who passes down the right things as David said tell them to your children oh I think of that story we read of that that prophecy in Joel that you're that I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men will dream dreams your young men will see Visions in other words God wasn't going to leave any of them out in fact God was going to say by Joel that it doesn't matter if you're a child it doesn't matter if you're a teenager it doesn't matter if you're 20 if you're 30 if you're 40 if you're 70 if you're a come on somebody he said old men and young men in other words God has a purpose in every season of your life God has a special purpose God has things that he can do for you as a young man that he may not be able to do so you better take your opportunity while you're young and let me say to the I won't call you old but the Bible called the old men the old men you say brother mat is this going to be the young uh-uh because the Bible says the old men dream dreams and the young men seen Visions I notice this generation even when Elijah dies and Elisha saying my father my father he calling him his father the Chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof and notice this passing down of this mantle and a double portion what was it it was the right father passing down the right things and not the wrong things and then Elisha comes to the end of his life tell something so powerful Elisha comes down to the very end and the Bible says he's going to repeat the same words the same words not Elisha but juu is going to say the same exact thing what do you have represented here in Elijah I'm sorry Elisha can we read it can we just take just a moment to read it turn to Second Kings chapter 13 turn there quickly if you could thank you my plane ain't till 7 o'clock so that's that's either good or bad for you I'm not sure I'll let you decide now notice this here because he's going to pass down the right things not the wrong things and I want you to notice the power of this connection between the old and the young between the old men and the young men because both are important in fact one can't live without the other it wasn't just an old generation or a new generation but actually God viewed them as one weapon and I'm just filling the Holy Spirit right now so I believe the Lord wants to say something it was actually going to be both the connection of the old and the young and God says here's Elisha and Elisha's Fallen sick he's got at the end of his life he's going on but God is going to actually take this example and notice it says Elisha was Fallen sick of his sickness come here brother Tim come here I got to use you just for a moment come here come here buddy I want to use you come here can I use these two give these give these guys a hand as they come I want to illustrate something come up here on the stage with me now brother Tim I want you to stand here and face the audience and brother you stand here and face the audience I want you to notice because I'm not call calling you old brother Tim but I'm about to use you as Elisha now the Bible says here in verse 14 Elisha was Fallen sick of his sickness come on brother Tim Fallen sick of his sickness now don't die yet not that sick notice Elisha was Fallen sick and and joash the king of Israel came down unto him and wept over his face said oh my father let's read it together oh my father my father The Chariot of Israel notice this connection between this father my father my father The Chariot and the horsemen thereof and Elisha said unto him take bow and arrow so brother take bow and arrow don't draw it yet but just hold your bow like this like you got a bow now now I want you to notice what he says he says take bow and arrow and so he takes a bow and arrow and he took unto him a bow and arrow and he said to the king of Israel put thy hand upon the bow and he put his hand upon it and Elisha stand behind him brother Tim Elisha this is actually the example that he gives that he tells him to put your hand in other words there's a connection between the old and the young come on somebody help me preach here today there's not a disconnection there's a connection between the two and God says I want you to put your hand upon his hand and Elisha put his hand upon his hand and what's it representative of here what's it representing is that God says this is the arrow of God's Deliverance what was it going to be your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see Visions you say what do you have represented here you have the wisdom of the old generation you have veterans that have stood for the message of the hour you have testimonies of time Ed memorials and you've got the Zeal and the passion and the fervor and the energy of a new generation and God says this is the arrow of God's Deliverance oh I say it's time for our old men to dream dreams and our young men to see the vision thank you Brothers give them a hand this morning let me say we need the faith of the generation the old generation we need the faith and the energy of the new God says this is the arrow of my deliverance and Elisha knows as he puts his hand upon the hand of ju Elisha knows I don't want to pass down all I thank this and I thank any father how many dads we got here today on Father's Day Elisha says I don't want to pass down the wrong thing I think of God's Prophet as we read in standing in the Gap and he realizes it's going to be his testimony and his resolve oh he could have just went off and took that detour he had a right to listen sometimes people hurt you and you you say if anybody ever had a right I think it was God's prophit just to go be a mountaineer come on if anybody had a right a human right just to say I didn't do anything wrong and people are closing the doors but he knew if he did that what would that do to the Next Generation and he knew as a father I don't want to pass down the wrong thing I don't want to pass down my complexes I don't want to pass down my anger if I've got any temper I don't want to pass down any idial secrecies anything I want to pass down the right thing how many dads how many mothers how many fathers raise their hand today and say God don't let me transfer the wrong thing upon my family I want to transfer faith brother Aaron oh I want to transfer Hope Oh does anybody feel that way today I want to transfer Revival to the Next Generation I want to transfer the god of the supernatural to my children so that they would believe in a god of the supernatural oh could you stand to your feet and say God let me transfer down the right thing to my children let me pass down not fear not fear but Faith oh you just want to raise a hand to the Lord now and say God that's my desire that's my desire Lord that I transfer the right things down that i' break the cycle of judges and I bring my family into Ruth where there's no more fighting there's no more war there's just rest under boas there's peace oh brother Matt you don't know what my life is you don't know where I've been you don't know what my home looks like oh but can I just tell you today with your head bows and bowed in that hand raised can I just encourage you that a different atmosphere is just right down the road it's not a Million Miles Away judges doesn't have to end you don't have to end your life there but you can break that cycle in your life you don't have to end with the chaos and another generation go down and pass down the same traits and pass down the same things and pass sound the same as brother brandham said just little things that their family was inner bread and bread and inner bread but God can come and rewrite your whole life you say brother Matt what power do I have over the tendencies that I was born with I'm going to tell you what power you have you have the power of choice to lay it down and say I stomp my pride under my feet in the name of Jesus I stomp it under my feet you say what power do I have brother Matt to live past and go beyond to break free from the chains of generational curses curses God can forge a new Legacy this morning and what could have ended in death can end in life life it can end in it can end in Hope Ruth's Legacy her past wasn't going to dictate her future but God was going to rewrite The Narrative of her life and break the shackles of generational curses and God says Ruth I got your new purpose I got your new identity oh and it's not going to be one that ends in defeat and failure and it's not going to be one that ends in lukewarmness and coldness and indifference it's going to be one that ends with you having a son oh and that son will be OED and he'll have a son named Jesse and Jesse will have a son what was it it was a lineage of Faith her name would have been smeared out in the Book of Judges but because she came out of judges and came into Ruth now the very lineage of Christ would come through her lineage you say God I want that for my family today I'm raising my hand and I accept it maybe you need to do that I challenge you today I challenge you today and and and you do whatever you want to do you there at your seat or come to this altar do whatever you feel you need to do but I challenge you today to take that yearslong generational tendency and come up to this alter and say I'm leaving it right here it will not haunt me it will not follow me I'm going to smash it under my feet and today I'm coming out of judges and I'm entering the land of Ruth oh Hallelujah Lord oh God give it give us that kind of inheritance to our young people to our families to our fathers to our mothers to our children give the Visions to our young give the dreams to our old revive us Lord God again I think of Jacob as he was had lost all hope in Joseph he had lost all faith it was his dream got to the end of his life and his dream was dead he for all he knew Joseph was dead oh but one day he would see the evidence of wagons of increase and the Bible says Jacob was revived oh what was it Lord you sent a Revival God it was an old man receiving a Revival and becoming like a man oh I say today God give us all the families this isn't just about preachers this isn't just about pastors this is about the whole body coming under the same expectation and token life give it to our families Lord Jesus give it to us Lord God we pray let it be all hands raised up all over the building you just want to talk to him now and say Lord I reach a hold of the promises of God and I I take it down I reach out of that Earthly Dimension I reach into that Heavenly atmosphere and I say I apply the blood over my home I apply the blood over my family I apply the blood over my children over my f over my mind over my spirit over my personality let it let the Lamb's blood let the life of that lamb wash over every part of my being oh God grant it Lord Jesus we
