[57:37] to see a man that I've seen day in and
[57:39] day out struggle to to live and to fight
[57:43] it it gives you a tenacity to believe
[57:45] that all things are possible to them
[57:47] that believe and I believe that the Lord
[57:49] is here to display his power and His
[57:52] Majesty like never before and we're
[57:54] under great anticipation amen amen if
[57:57] you have your Bibles this evening would
[57:58] like to look over in the Book of John
[58:01] John chapter 1 verse 11 then to Luke
[58:05] chapter 4
[58:12] certainly honored to have my wife and my
[58:14] children
[58:15] here with us this weekend and
[58:25] his little children know how to
[58:27] calm daddy right on down and maybe
[58:29] sometimes
[58:31] stir them up a little bit too so
[58:34] but they certainly are special
[58:37] they certainly are special to us amen
[58:39] I'd like to speak to you on the thought
[58:42] that the lord has laid on our heart for
[58:44] this meeting open this meeting up on
[58:47] anointed by accepting what Eve turned
[58:49] down
[58:51] anointed by accepting what Eve turned
[58:54] down John chapter 1 and verse 1
[58:57] he came unto his own
[58:59] and his own received him not
[59:02] but as many as received him
[59:05] to them gave you power to become the
[59:07] sons of God even to them that believe on
[59:11] his name which were born not of blood
[59:13] nor of the will of the flesh nor of the
[59:16] will of man but of God and the Word was
[59:19] made flesh and dwelt amongst us and we
[59:22] beheld his glory the glory as of the
[59:25] only begotten of the father full of
[59:27] grace and of Truth and flipped down to
[59:29] verse 40 there
[59:31] and one of the two which heard John
[59:34] speak and followed him was Andrew Simon
[59:37] Peter's brother he first findeth his own
[59:40] brother Simon and saith unto him we have
[59:42] found the Messiah which is being
[59:46] interpreted the Christ and he brought
[59:48] him to Jesus and when he and when Jesus
[59:51] beheld him he said Thou Art Simon the
[59:54] son of Jonah thou shall be called cephas
[59:56] which is by interpretation a stone
[1:00:00] Luke chapter 4 and verse 18.
[1:00:11] Luke chapter 4 and verse 18. the spirit
[1:00:14] of the Lord is upon me because he hath
[1:00:17] anointed me to preach the gospel to the
[1:00:19] poor he hath sent me to heal the
[1:00:20] brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to
[1:00:23] the captives and recovering of the sight
[1:00:25] to the Blind and to set at Liberty them
[1:00:27] that are bruised to preach the
[1:00:30] acceptable year of the Lord and he
[1:00:32] closed the book and he gave it again to
[1:00:35] the minister and sat down and the eye is
[1:00:37] of all of them that were in the
[1:00:39] synagogue were fastened on him and he
[1:00:42] began to say unto them this day is this
[1:00:45] scripture fulfilled in your ears may God
[1:00:48] bless his word he may be seated in the
[1:00:50] presence of the Lord
[1:00:51] I think it's amazing I think it's an
[1:00:53] amazing thing as we're reading here and
[1:00:55] we look back two thousand years ago that
[1:00:57] Jesus comes and he takes the he takes
[1:01:00] the scroll and he begins to read over as
[1:01:02] we would identify it as Isaiah chapter
[1:01:04] 61 and he begins to read that portion of
[1:01:07] scripture as the book was delivered to
[1:01:09] him and the Bible said that he closed
[1:01:11] the book and sat down but today we
[1:01:13] recognize that we're living in an hour
[1:01:15] that he's opened the book and he has
[1:01:17] said that this day is a scripture
[1:01:19] fulfilled and today we recognize that we
[1:01:22] are the Most Blessed people beyond
[1:01:24] beyond our own human compensation to be
[1:01:27] able to to understand exactly how
[1:01:30] blessed that we are to think that we're
[1:01:31] sitting right here in the greatest
[1:01:33] anointing that's ever struck the land or
[1:01:36] struck the people of God and here we are
[1:01:38] we're we're watching the the more the
[1:01:41] mighty move of God as it's moving
[1:01:42] through his people as he's as he's
[1:01:44] drawing a body together you're watching
[1:01:47] the anointing of the Lord as he's
[1:01:49] beginning to move through the message of
[1:01:51] the hour of Malachi 4 and he begins to
[1:01:53] move across the Living God and the
[1:01:55] Church of the Living God and he begins
[1:01:57] to draw them unto himself and and we
[1:01:59] recognize that that that they're
[1:02:01] accepting it means to the consent to
[1:02:04] receive it's to receive willingly it's
[1:02:06] to give an affirmative answer to offer
[1:02:09] or proposal or to say yes to and when
[1:02:11] when you watch as a young couple as
[1:02:13] they're as they're working or they're
[1:02:15] walking down the aisle and they're
[1:02:17] standing there and they're they're
[1:02:18] making their proposal and they're making
[1:02:20] their they're making their vows to one
[1:02:22] another and they they declare that I
[1:02:24] will go with you I will be with you your
[1:02:26] people will be my people your God will
[1:02:28] be my God and they say I I do at the
[1:02:31] very end when the when the preacher's
[1:02:33] standing there and he's asking you see
[1:02:35] what is he doing he's asking this man
[1:02:38] will she accept this except this man to
[1:02:41] be her woman or the wife to be the man
[1:02:42] or wife to be the husband and vice versa
[1:02:45] she's standing there and she is
[1:02:47] accepting him as her head and when that
[1:02:50] when that wife is standing there she is
[1:02:52] accepting him as her headship and this
[1:02:55] body in this generation has allowed the
[1:02:58] Lord Jesus Christ to be her headship
[1:03:00] she's not allowed Rome to be her
[1:03:02] headships she's not allowed the church
[1:03:04] World she's not she's not allowed
[1:03:06] anybody but our Lord Jesus Christ to be
[1:03:08] her headship and you go to studying out
[1:03:10] over in Jewish Traditions when you go to
[1:03:12] studying out when they have a wedding
[1:03:14] ceremony there in the Eastern countries
[1:03:17] that there as the as the groom and the
[1:03:19] bride are standing before one another
[1:03:21] that they're standing there and she's
[1:03:23] got the veil over her face and she lifts
[1:03:26] the bridegroom lifts the veil and he
[1:03:29] places it upon his shoulder showing that
[1:03:32] he is taking complete ownership of her
[1:03:34] and our Lord Jesus Christ has come in
[1:03:36] this generation and he's took in
[1:03:38] complete control of this body and
[1:03:40] there's not one thing out of place in
[1:03:42] the body of Jesus Christ this is not a
[1:03:44] Bejeweled corpse this is this is not a
[1:03:47] freak body but this is the body of the
[1:03:50] Lord Jesus Christ that is an anointed by
[1:03:52] the same anointing that was there two
[1:03:55] thousand years ago it is the same
[1:03:57] anointing that was on it was on Moses
[1:03:59] it's the same anointing that was there
[1:04:01] on Jonah it's the same anointing that is
[1:04:04] here in this building tonight is the
[1:04:06] same one that was back there in the very
[1:04:07] beginning that rode the worlds off of
[1:04:09] his fingertips and he said let there be
[1:04:12] there's an anointing in this room
[1:04:13] tonight maybe you don't see it or maybe
[1:04:15] you don't feel it right now but there's
[1:04:17] an anointing here that'll drive out
[1:04:19] every Cancer cell that'll drive out
[1:04:22] every disease it'll drive out every
[1:04:24] Creed or dog my idea that you have
[1:04:26] there's an anointing amongst the body of
[1:04:28] Jesus Christ that every devil in hell is
[1:04:31] scared of tonight and that's why the
[1:04:33] devil shook up tonight is because
[1:04:34] there's an anointing here that will
[1:04:36] defeat him Anytime Anyplace under any
[1:04:39] circumstance I'm not shook up and I'm
[1:04:42] not scared what the devil may do to you
[1:04:44] because there's an anointing that is
[1:04:46] here
[1:04:47] [Music]
[1:04:55] I'll let you happen
[1:04:57] now you know if you're very familiar
[1:05:00] with a message and I believe I believe
[1:05:02] that you are you know exactly where I'm
[1:05:03] drawing this thought from tonight from
[1:05:06] Christ the mystery God revealed and
[1:05:08] brother Branham said that in there there
[1:05:09] would be a Time come forth when he would
[1:05:11] Express himself in the fullness of a
[1:05:13] godhead deity through his church and
[1:05:15] have the preeminence in this church oh
[1:05:17] my what the anointed man now the
[1:05:20] anointed people oh my to bring back the
[1:05:22] anointed bride and bridegroom anointed
[1:05:24] by Why by accepting what Eve turned down
[1:05:27] coming back with the anointing of the
[1:05:30] word because he said my word is spirit
[1:05:32] see Anointed with the word what Eve
[1:05:35] turned down he comes back and we accept
[1:05:38] and we recognize that where we are
[1:05:40] standing at is a Church of the Living
[1:05:41] God it's the greatest day where we
[1:05:43] recognize that there's an extremely
[1:05:46] strong angel that has stood up in this
[1:05:48] day and you go to reading Revelations
[1:05:50] chapter 10 you find that there John
[1:05:53] represented you as the body of Jesus
[1:05:55] Christ and the angel said unto him go
[1:05:58] and eat the book John don't just eat
[1:06:01] half of it but eat the book and you're
[1:06:03] recognizing that there is an anointing
[1:06:05] there's an angel that is here that is
[1:06:08] standing here tonight and he's watching
[1:06:10] over every single movement that is going
[1:06:11] on now we know that the Bible said in
[1:06:14] second Timothy at 3 and 16 that all
[1:06:16] scripture is given by the inspiration of
[1:06:19] God and it's profitable for Doctrine
[1:06:21] reproof and correction and instruction
[1:06:23] and we recognize that that the the
[1:06:26] inspiration of the Lord would move out
[1:06:28] across across his his Gene seed of God
[1:06:32] as we could call it that way he would
[1:06:34] move out across the prophets and those
[1:06:36] prophets would go in the Old Testament
[1:06:38] and you would watch them as the prophecy
[1:06:40] would come forth they were moved by the
[1:06:43] Holy Ghost to bring for the word in the
[1:06:46] hour and they recognize it was the same
[1:06:48] holy ghost that was coming to pass in
[1:06:51] all of their lives and you watch there's
[1:06:53] one thing that the elect always is
[1:06:55] watching for the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:06:58] or the the anointed is always looking
[1:07:00] for it's the Fulfillment of what their
[1:07:03] prophets had said is that right you're
[1:07:05] watching for the identification of his
[1:07:07] presence when it comes behind the word
[1:07:09] that has been spoken when a prophet has
[1:07:12] stayed with the word and then that
[1:07:14] prophet's credentials is that he stayed
[1:07:16] with the word and you'll find that there
[1:07:19] in this hour there is a whole gang of
[1:07:21] people a whole body move of people that
[1:07:24] has stayed with the word and I have to
[1:07:26] say that that we as the body of Jesus
[1:07:28] Christ we are the credentials we are
[1:07:31] standing we're Toe to Toe with the Devil
[1:07:34] Himself because we've stayed with the
[1:07:36] word
[1:07:36] [Applause]
[1:07:39] I believe that everything brother
[1:07:40] Brandon said he said I believe that
[1:07:42] Jesus of Nazareth fulfilled every
[1:07:44] description that all the prophets spoke
[1:07:46] of to be the Messiah you see when Jesus
[1:07:49] came in flesh he fully accepted his role
[1:07:53] as the Messiah because he knew who he
[1:07:55] was he never went around denying that he
[1:07:58] was a Son of God he never went a day
[1:08:00] around denying that he was the Messiah
[1:08:02] but he went around and he clearly put a
[1:08:04] voice with the word and said I am he he
[1:08:07] knew who he was and he accepted his
[1:08:09] position he didn't hang his head down
[1:08:11] when the enemy or when the people caught
[1:08:14] him be else above he accepted his
[1:08:16] position and he walked fully into it
[1:08:18] when he was standing out there with a
[1:08:20] woman at the well in John chapter 4 she
[1:08:22] said I know that when Messiahs come he
[1:08:25] will tell us of all of these things and
[1:08:27] he clearly identified who he was when he
[1:08:29] was speaking to a prostitute when there
[1:08:31] was a lot of people who thought he
[1:08:32] should have been talking to them he was
[1:08:34] out there having a conversation with a
[1:08:36] prostitute somebody that was a nobody
[1:08:38] some somebody that should have never
[1:08:40] been in a picture but the Messiah was
[1:08:42] out there having a picture or having a
[1:08:45] conversation with a woman of your Fame
[1:08:47] somebody that never should have been in
[1:08:49] a message somebody that should have
[1:08:50] never been in a message search somebody
[1:08:52] that never should have been at the whale
[1:08:54] with a messiah but he was up there
[1:08:56] identifying who he was to a prostitute
[1:08:58] and there's a lot of people that thought
[1:09:00] that you should have never been
[1:09:01] identified with this message there's a
[1:09:03] lot of people that said you should have
[1:09:05] never been identified with a messiah but
[1:09:07] you have been anointed by accepting who
[1:09:10] you are there is something on the inside
[1:09:12] of this body
[1:09:14] that is moved you to accept that this is
[1:09:17] your Liberty this is your message
[1:09:21] I'm sick and tired of people saying it's
[1:09:23] just William bradham's message this is
[1:09:25] my message this is our young people's
[1:09:28] message it will be this message that'll
[1:09:31] take this body right onto the coming of
[1:09:33] the Lord
[1:09:39] knew who he was he accepted who he was
[1:09:42] you remember when brother Bantam is
[1:09:44] preaching on the testimony at the sea
[1:09:45] and he's out there and he's got the
[1:09:47] disciples and he's he's laying out a
[1:09:49] drama and he's laying it out and there's
[1:09:51] John up there and he said I'm fully
[1:09:53] satisfied that this was a messiah and
[1:09:56] there Peter and James and they're going
[1:09:57] through there and they're having a
[1:09:58] testimony they're having a testimony
[1:10:01] about about the actions of the Messiah
[1:10:03] he said now my daddy taught me these
[1:10:05] things we've looked at the scripture and
[1:10:07] they've taught us these things he said
[1:10:08] I'm fully satisfied that he is he is
[1:10:12] exactly like the Jehovah that was back
[1:10:15] there in the creation and they were
[1:10:17] sitting there and they were talking
[1:10:18] about when he fed the five thousand
[1:10:22] and he starts breaking the bread off he
[1:10:25] starts breaking it off and there's
[1:10:27] another place put in position there's
[1:10:28] another there's another there's another
[1:10:30] piece of bread that's went back in the
[1:10:32] same spot he broke it and it was
[1:10:34] multiplied he broke it and he was
[1:10:36] multiplied and it looked like Satan was
[1:10:38] going to take you down but God put
[1:10:41] somebody
[1:10:42] put somebody with something on the
[1:10:44] inside of them that could go all the way
[1:10:46] through laodicea and make it and they
[1:10:49] were having a conversation and while
[1:10:51] Jesus is back there in the boat and he's
[1:10:54] and he's back there sleeping and they're
[1:10:56] having a testimony and they looked out
[1:10:58] there and they said brother random said
[1:11:00] that they this one had the habits of
[1:11:03] Jehovah
[1:11:04] he's got the habits of Jehovah he acts
[1:11:07] like Jehovah he thinks like Jehovah he
[1:11:10] must be Jehovah and you look at this
[1:11:13] body today she's got the same habits
[1:11:16] she's got the same habits it ain't just
[1:11:19] Malachi 4. it's the body of Jesus Christ
[1:11:22] she's got the habits of Jehovah
[1:11:25] he just for had he writes it ain't just
[1:11:28] for me to bring him it's for the Church
[1:11:30] of the Living God
[1:11:33] how can those things be she wasn't
[1:11:36] questioning it she was asking how can I
[1:11:39] do this
[1:11:41] oh somebody there's a body of Believers
[1:11:45] that's anointed by accepting
[1:11:58] William Branham knew
[1:12:00] that you'd fulfill this portion
[1:12:06] coming back
[1:12:07] with the anointing of the word because
[1:12:09] he said my word is spirit see Anointed
[1:12:11] with the word what Eve turned down he
[1:12:12] comes back and we accept now you go to
[1:12:15] studying out throughout the Old
[1:12:16] Testament and you go to looking at the
[1:12:18] anointing you've got to look at there
[1:12:19] when they set up altars they would pour
[1:12:21] out the anointing oil upon the rocks and
[1:12:24] they would pour it out on pillars they
[1:12:26] would set up altars and they pour out
[1:12:27] the anointing oil upon stubs and upon
[1:12:30] rot and when Moses is back there a
[1:12:32] little big hit us Leviticus chapter 8.
[1:12:35] he's up there and he's he's laying out
[1:12:37] the levitical priesthood how everything
[1:12:39] is supposed to be set up he's laying all
[1:12:42] of these things out there and he anoints
[1:12:44] the vessels in the Tabernacle he anoints
[1:12:47] Aaron and his sons and he recognize that
[1:12:49] that priest when he would walk into The
[1:12:51] Presence of Jehovah he would have to
[1:12:53] walk in there completely dress right he
[1:12:56] had to ha he had to have the anointing
[1:12:58] on him he had to have the sacrifice the
[1:13:00] blood upon him he had the he had the
[1:13:03] bells and the pomegranates that were
[1:13:04] around his robe and they were going up
[1:13:07] there and they were singing Holy Holy
[1:13:09] Holy unto the Lord you see all of this
[1:13:12] was done to ring out a praise unto the
[1:13:15] great Jehovah and you watch as Moses is
[1:13:18] up there he goes in there and he anoints
[1:13:20] the vessels he sprinkles it sprinkles
[1:13:23] the anointing oil upon all of the
[1:13:25] vessels up there he goes in there and
[1:13:27] anoints him to be to sanctify and you
[1:13:30] watch that there are prophets that are
[1:13:32] anointed there are Kings I don't know
[1:13:34] you're very familiar with these things
[1:13:36] that's why I'm preaching it to you and
[1:13:38] you you understand that Kings were
[1:13:40] anointed the kings were set up they were
[1:13:43] anointed and went just like when you
[1:13:45] would watch him in the in the book of
[1:13:46] Samuel that you would watch that God
[1:13:49] would anoint Saul to be king he would
[1:13:51] take the Horn of oil and he would pour
[1:13:53] the oil which was a type of the Holy
[1:13:55] Ghost he would pour it over his heart
[1:13:57] you watch what Saul did he couldn't live
[1:14:00] right
[1:14:02] he couldn't live right he he got out
[1:14:05] there he backslipped but he wasn't lost
[1:14:06] he backslid but the anointing was upon
[1:14:09] him and David knew that he wasn't going
[1:14:11] to touch him he said I'm not going to
[1:14:12] touch the Lord's anoint it but you watch
[1:14:14] when when Samuel goes out there and he
[1:14:17] finds and that God says I am anointing
[1:14:19] another king and Samuel goes out there
[1:14:22] and his Prophet Groves and he walks out
[1:14:25] there and he's looking for David but you
[1:14:29] see Jesse was looking was looking on the
[1:14:32] natural side of things
[1:14:34] and there come out all of Jesse's sons
[1:14:37] and they're stacked out there in front
[1:14:39] of the prophet and they're stacked out
[1:14:42] there some are bigger than stature some
[1:14:44] are greater than knowledge some got a
[1:14:45] great intellectual DD they've got phds
[1:14:49] they've got llds they've got all these
[1:14:51] things but I'm reminded when a prophet
[1:14:53] said a DD is it's a dumb dog and they
[1:14:56] stacked up there and they walked out in
[1:14:58] front of the prophet and the prophet
[1:15:00] said no these are not the ones you see
[1:15:03] there might be people that are bigger
[1:15:05] than you there might be people that that
[1:15:07] look better than you there might be
[1:15:09] people that are stronger than you there
[1:15:11] might be people that have more intellect
[1:15:13] more wisdom more knowledge than you
[1:15:16] but there is a major difference between
[1:15:19] talent and anointing
[1:15:21] there's a lot of people that can speak
[1:15:23] better than myself there's a lot of
[1:15:25] people that can talk better than these
[1:15:26] bunch of hillbillies that you got
[1:15:28] preaching to you this weekend but God
[1:15:30] doesn't want somebody that's got a bunch
[1:15:32] of intellect and a bunch of knowledge
[1:15:34] standing before his body he wants
[1:15:36] somebody that's got anointing there's a
[1:15:38] major difference between a singer and a
[1:15:41] real worship leader that's a great major
[1:15:43] difference between an anointed piano
[1:15:45] player and somebody that knows all of
[1:15:48] the keys and all the diaphragms of how
[1:15:50] it's filled and all of these things
[1:15:53] God they want somebody that's full of
[1:15:55] knowledge he's wanting somebody that's
[1:15:57] emptied out so that he could pour
[1:15:59] himself in there and he could shake the
[1:16:01] world with him
[1:16:02] [Applause]
[1:16:04] there's a lot of people that have a
[1:16:06] better ability to be able to be a orator
[1:16:09] before the people
[1:16:12] but they have no option of the Holy
[1:16:14] Ghost they have no power and they have
[1:16:16] no anointing the Bible said in
[1:16:18] Ecclesiastes chapter 9 I believe he said
[1:16:21] it's a living a living dog is better
[1:16:24] than a dead lion you see I'd rather have
[1:16:26] somebody that's maybe the poorest
[1:16:28] poorest preacher but yet he's fully
[1:16:30] anointed by God than to have some
[1:16:33] intellectual job that thinks he knows
[1:16:35] everything about the message to stand up
[1:16:37] and try to give us some great speech of
[1:16:40] what he thinks the message is I want
[1:16:42] somebody that's got the faith that's got
[1:16:45] the faith to move mountains I want
[1:16:47] somebody that's got the power to believe
[1:16:49] that all things are possible I want
[1:16:51] somebody that's got some anointing on
[1:16:53] the inside of them that believes that
[1:16:56] there's a God that is here at the pulpit
[1:16:58] that can do exceedingly abundantly above
[1:17:01] all that you could ever ask or think I
[1:17:04] want somebody that knows how to get a
[1:17:06] hold of God I want somebody that
[1:17:08] believes in Malachi 4. I want somebody
[1:17:10] that believes in Revelations here I want
[1:17:13] somebody
[1:17:16] we don't want Talent we want an
[1:17:18] anointing we want an anointing not a
[1:17:21] break to yoke off of our young girls we
[1:17:23] want an anointing that'll break suicide
[1:17:25] we want an anointing
[1:17:27] we want an anointing now to break
[1:17:29] depression we want anoint another break
[1:17:32] then a break home of sexuality and that
[1:17:34] anointing is in this room
[1:17:37] it's in this body and hell is shook up
[1:17:40] because you're here
[1:17:47] hell you better be nervous because we
[1:17:49] have come to tear your shape tear your
[1:17:51] kingdom down
[1:17:53] better you got every right to be nervous
[1:17:55] you got every right to be excited
[1:17:57] because we're not backing up on one of
[1:17:59] God blood's Brown promises
[1:18:11] the oil was a type of the life of the
[1:18:15] Holy Ghost
[1:18:16] that has come upon the believer
[1:18:20] you see when they would those Hebrews
[1:18:22] back there when they when they watched
[1:18:25] the anointing oil be poured over top of
[1:18:28] David they believe that David had the
[1:18:32] mind of Christ
[1:18:33] you watch when when what the Bible tells
[1:18:36] us in James chapter 5 to if there's any
[1:18:38] sick amongst you let them call upon the
[1:18:40] Elders of the church and anoint them
[1:18:42] with oil and pray the prayer of faith
[1:18:45] over them and it shall save the sick
[1:18:48] Psalms 28 and 8 says that the Lord is
[1:18:51] their strength and he is the saving
[1:18:53] strength of his anointed Psalms 45 and 7
[1:18:56] thou love is righteousness and hated
[1:18:58] wickedness therefore God thy God hath
[1:19:01] anointed thee with the oil of gladness
[1:19:04] above our fellows Psalms 92 and 10 says
[1:19:07] but my horn shall thou exalt like the
[1:19:10] Horn of a unicorn and I shall be
[1:19:13] Anointed with the fresh oil
[1:19:15] now watch what it what the tri the
[1:19:17] passion translation says your anointing
[1:19:20] has made me strong in Mighty you've
[1:19:23] empowered my life for Triumph by pouring
[1:19:26] fresh oil over me
[1:19:30] you have made your anointing has made me
[1:19:34] strong and mighty Paul said in second
[1:19:37] Corinthians 1 and 21 now he would
[1:19:39] establish us with you in Christ have
[1:19:42] anointed us as God it's not the man here
[1:19:45] at the pulpit it is the anointing of
[1:19:47] almighty God that has anointed us
[1:19:50] if any of us preachers have the ability
[1:19:52] to make you call to make you elect we'd
[1:19:55] have done did it we'd have done went
[1:19:56] down to Walmart and anointed every
[1:19:58] single body there we'd have made we'd
[1:20:00] made them all bright of Jesus Christ but
[1:20:02] there is a gene said of God that has
[1:20:04] allowed you to be who you are
[1:20:07] you see it wasn't just the oil that was
[1:20:10] poured over top of David that made him
[1:20:12] there made him the anointed you could
[1:20:14] take that same oil and pour it on the
[1:20:17] top on the top of all of Jesse's Sons
[1:20:19] but it never would have made them the
[1:20:21] anointed
[1:20:22] of God because God had already seen that
[1:20:25] David's heart was pure before him he had
[1:20:28] the heart after God
[1:20:32] what was it
[1:20:34] David was quick
[1:20:36] to repent
[1:20:38] and I find that is the hardest thing
[1:20:41] for believers to do sometimes is to
[1:20:44] repent
[1:20:45] and say I'm sorry
[1:20:48] it ain't gonna hurt you he won't kill
[1:20:50] you he won't hurt you just say look I've
[1:20:53] been wrong about some things I'm sorry
[1:20:55] I've done some things wrong you know we
[1:20:59] won't think no less of you if you repent
[1:21:01] and think you're not anointed we're
[1:21:03] going to know you're anointed because
[1:21:04] you're repented
[1:21:07] we're gonna know you're anointed because
[1:21:09] you come after the heart of God
[1:21:16] notice what John 3 and 27 that John
[1:21:18] answered and said a man can receive
[1:21:20] nothing except to be given him from
[1:21:23] heaven now you know you remember when
[1:21:25] brother Brandon is he's there and he has
[1:21:27] his dream he has his dream about this
[1:21:29] man this this great big pearly man that
[1:21:32] is beating this woman and brother random
[1:21:34] thought that it was his mama at first he
[1:21:36] was this big great big ball in my hand
[1:21:38] was beating this woman with a
[1:21:40] three-corner club and every time every
[1:21:43] time it looked like she would rise up
[1:21:44] that man would go to beat her down with
[1:21:47] that pretty Corner club and brother
[1:21:49] Brandon said I was I was scared of that
[1:21:50] man at first he said I was scared of
[1:21:52] that man at first he said but all of a
[1:21:54] sudden I reached some pair and I grabbed
[1:21:56] him by the caller and said you stop that
[1:21:59] or you're going to have to deal with me
[1:22:01] you see what he what it was is that
[1:22:03] woman was the churches of the world and
[1:22:06] if that man that man was the
[1:22:08] denominations that was trying to rule
[1:22:10] the church and it was taking her and he
[1:22:13] was beating her with that Three Corner
[1:22:15] Club of trinitarian baptism in the name
[1:22:18] of Father Son and Holy Ghost and every
[1:22:20] single time she'd rise up to accept the
[1:22:22] truth he'd go to beat her down
[1:22:26] go beat her down with with his with his
[1:22:29] Doctrine and with his idea you see
[1:22:31] that's what Satan will do to you every
[1:22:33] single time you come to accept the truth
[1:22:36] and accept what's right and accept this
[1:22:38] anointing he will try to beat you down
[1:22:40] with circumstances and beat you down
[1:22:42] with problems and beat you down with
[1:22:44] cancer and beat you down with troubles
[1:22:46] and beat you down with fights between
[1:22:48] one another and beat you down within
[1:22:50] those secrecies and all of these things
[1:22:52] but you see if Satan can keep you afraid
[1:22:54] of your inheritance that's where he's
[1:22:56] got you at but I don't believe that
[1:22:58] you're a bunch of wimpy Christians that
[1:23:01] just easy roll over when the pastor
[1:23:02] don't talk to you I happen to believe
[1:23:05] that you're the strongest body the most
[1:23:07] powerful body that there ever has been
[1:23:09] upon the face of the Earth
[1:23:11] yeah and you're going to turn down
[1:23:14] Satan's life you're going to turn down
[1:23:16] his life you're going to turn down what
[1:23:18] he said about you you're going to turn
[1:23:20] down what he said and you're going to
[1:23:21] accept what God has said about you
[1:23:23] [Applause]
[1:23:34] your pastor brother Tim
[1:23:36] has been a very special friend to our
[1:23:39] family
[1:23:43] he's been there
[1:23:45] he's been there through the thick and
[1:23:46] the thin
[1:23:48] and I thank God for the man Tim Pruitt
[1:23:53] anybody else
[1:23:58] let me tell you if you're dying
[1:24:01] and you've been burned up playing in a
[1:24:03] coma for 17 days
[1:24:05] you you might want to have Tim Brook
[1:24:07] come by your way
[1:24:11] well Tim's been a friend in good times
[1:24:13] and he's been a friend in bad times
[1:24:15] and when I was going to the greatest
[1:24:17] trial of my Ministry
[1:24:21] when my Ministry was under attack
[1:24:22] because Satan loves to attack the
[1:24:25] ministry like never before what is he
[1:24:27] after he's after your anointing Samson
[1:24:31] you see if he can get you to lay your
[1:24:34] head over and lay ought to see his lap
[1:24:36] he'll take your anointing away from you
[1:24:38] but it's time that you shake yourself
[1:24:42] he's after your anointing and when I was
[1:24:46] in my greatest trial
[1:24:49] preachers don't have those that's what
[1:24:50] some people think
[1:24:56] brother Tim sent me this
[1:25:01] when you are gifted and anointed
[1:25:04] Satan will personally assign someone to
[1:25:07] bring you down just so your gift and
[1:25:09] anointing won't manifest
[1:25:12] but the enemy cannot kill what God has
[1:25:15] anointed to live he cannot stop who God
[1:25:18] is chosen to prosper and he cannot block
[1:25:21] what God is called to manifest
[1:25:24] you are gifted and you are anointed
[1:25:27] Satan has somebody that is after your
[1:25:29] anointing but there is a power in the
[1:25:32] house of God to shut down every blockade
[1:25:35] of hell
[1:25:36] you're not going to stop the anointing
[1:25:38] we're just going to let it operate more
[1:25:41] you can try to shut down the move of God
[1:25:43] you can try to shut down our power but
[1:25:47] God has quoted to manifest let the sons
[1:25:50] of God begin to operate in their
[1:25:52] anointing
[1:25:56] the Bible said in Psalms 105 and 15
[1:26:00] touch not my anointed and do my prophets
[1:26:03] no harm
[1:26:03] [Applause]
[1:26:05] it's a dangerous thing when you go to
[1:26:07] touching the anointing of the Lord and I
[1:26:08] ain't just talking about preachers I'm
[1:26:10] talking about you Satan has messed up
[1:26:12] when he's come back your way brother
[1:26:14] Lemuel and he besides that he's going to
[1:26:16] cut you and hinder you and try to stop
[1:26:18] the move of God in your life hell is
[1:26:20] messed up and he spits on their own set
[1:26:23] of preachers because we're not backing
[1:26:25] off and we're not backing up we believe
[1:26:27] he's still the same yesterday today and
[1:26:30] forever
[1:26:32] try to stop our anointing try to stop
[1:26:35] our gift try to stop our preaching we're
[1:26:37] just gonna rise up that much stronger
[1:26:39] we're going to rise up that much more
[1:26:41] powerful
[1:26:44] thank you
[1:26:48] it's dangerous when you go to touching
[1:26:50] the Lord's anointed
[1:26:52] Satan
[1:26:54] be careful
[1:26:57] is this all right
[1:26:59] I'll press okay brother
[1:27:07] one brother random
[1:27:09] he goes to preaching the seahorse
[1:27:11] and he starts taking us through the
[1:27:13] greatest the greatest release
[1:27:16] on the ministry that we've ever seen and
[1:27:18] he starts taking us through these things
[1:27:20] and brother Branham said that every
[1:27:22] single time that the Antichrist would
[1:27:24] send out one of his writers that the
[1:27:26] that that that the end that the
[1:27:27] Antichrist would send out one of his
[1:27:28] writers that God would send out a power
[1:27:31] or an anointing to combat to combat that
[1:27:34] power and watch what brother Adam says
[1:27:36] here in the fifth seal he said when that
[1:27:38] Antichrist was riding with his false
[1:27:40] teaching God sent his teaching out there
[1:27:42] the word the lion of the tribatuto which
[1:27:45] is the word may manifest in the Holy
[1:27:47] Spirit and the Holy Spirit is there to
[1:27:49] manifest himself which is the word he
[1:27:52] said that's the reason that the early
[1:27:54] church had healings and miracles and
[1:27:56] visions and power is because it was the
[1:27:59] Living Word in the form of the Lion of
[1:28:01] the tribe of Judah writing out there to
[1:28:03] combat that amen now you got it he sends
[1:28:06] his power the Antichrist and God sends
[1:28:09] his word so the enemy comes in like a
[1:28:11] flood but God raises up a standard now
[1:28:14] what is it you're not living in the Life
[1:28:17] age you're not living under that
[1:28:18] anointing but you are living under the
[1:28:21] Flying Eagle anointing what was that
[1:28:24] anointing it was Malachi 4 to restore
[1:28:27] the faith back to the faith of the
[1:28:29] Pentecostal fathers and
[1:28:31] just setting him
[1:28:32] he's still on the ground like a bunch of
[1:28:34] chickens you have rose up under the
[1:28:36] Flying Eagle anointing and you were
[1:28:38] under the Dominion of the anointed one
[1:28:42] to restore back to the faith of the
[1:28:44] Pentecostal fathers that what this
[1:28:47] message does it does not leave you where
[1:28:49] I found you it takes you higher
[1:28:54] what is it we are under a divine order
[1:28:57] to carry out the commission of this age
[1:29:01] when Paul was standing there when Paul
[1:29:04] was standing there and he's coming up
[1:29:06] into it and he's coming up into a
[1:29:07] certain city and he can't find nobody up
[1:29:09] there he can't find nobody up there
[1:29:11] that's preaching that's preaching Divine
[1:29:13] Healing all of them had done become a
[1:29:15] bunch of denominationalists but there he
[1:29:17] found one by the name of Timothy that
[1:29:20] was up there holding a healing campaign
[1:29:22] and brother random said he had such an
[1:29:24] atmosphere about him but there was lives
[1:29:26] that was being changed there was
[1:29:28] Miracles that were being done and that
[1:29:30] word in the church today will create the
[1:29:33] same type of atmosphere
[1:29:36] you see what's happening is that Satan
[1:29:39] is upset about the atmosphere that's
[1:29:40] going on in here he gets upset because
[1:29:43] there's an anointing here that'll make
[1:29:45] you speak in another language there's an
[1:29:47] anointing here that'll make you dance
[1:29:49] and it'll make you shout there's an
[1:29:51] anointing here that'll make you catch
[1:29:53] who you are in the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:29:58] now I'm gonna drive some things if
[1:30:00] that's all right with you just for a
[1:30:01] moment now brother random Will Tell Us
[1:30:03] in in A God Called man he said there's a
[1:30:05] lot of people that misunderstand what
[1:30:08] the anointing is he said they get there
[1:30:10] he said and they think that the
[1:30:11] anointing is that of emotions of jumping
[1:30:14] and shouting he said that is Joy he said
[1:30:17] but it's not an it's not an it's not
[1:30:19] anointing and then he would go over
[1:30:21] there and why people are so tossed about
[1:30:23] he said he said now emotions he said
[1:30:26] emotions is not the anointing
[1:30:29] he said anointing is supreme power under
[1:30:33] control he's now wind was the greatest
[1:30:35] anointing on Earth ever he said was in
[1:30:38] our Lord Jesus Christ and he said he
[1:30:40] went up there and he grabbed Isaiah 61
[1:30:43] and he took the book and he said this
[1:30:46] day this scripture is fulfilled in your
[1:30:49] ears and he set back down he said now we
[1:30:51] would want to run and jump and run all
[1:30:53] over the building
[1:30:55] he said but that is not it he said it is
[1:30:58] a supreme power under control
[1:31:02] now I know the devil likes to think that
[1:31:04] that just because we preached that quote
[1:31:06] that he can push us in some Corner the
[1:31:08] reason why we jump the reason why we
[1:31:10] shout the reason why we believe the
[1:31:12] reason why we accept is because there is
[1:31:15] an anointing here these young people
[1:31:16] have been taught under this message
[1:31:18] they've said here under the greatest
[1:31:19] Ministry and they're not just excited
[1:31:22] there's an anointing that is upon the
[1:31:24] body
[1:31:26] it's the same inspiration that was back
[1:31:28] there in the Garden of Eden and Adam was
[1:31:31] standing there and he was calling such
[1:31:33] and such by their names because it is an
[1:31:36] anointing
[1:31:38] and there's an anointing here to call
[1:31:41] out every black shadow
[1:31:44] there's an anointing here to call out
[1:31:46] every disease there's an anointing here
[1:31:49] that will break the yoke upon your life
[1:31:52] that's what the Bible tells us in Isaiah
[1:31:54] 10 and 27 that that that that there will
[1:31:57] be a burden that will be taken away from
[1:31:59] you and it is the anointing that breaks
[1:32:02] the Yoke off of your life now Satan
[1:32:05] wants to keep you under the Yoke of the
[1:32:08] enemy but there's an anointing to break
[1:32:10] every stronghold that is stacked up
[1:32:12] against you
[1:32:16] I don't know why we're here but we're
[1:32:18] here but Satan wants to keep you from
[1:32:21] accepting your Liberty in the Lord Jesus
[1:32:23] Christ he wants to keep you from
[1:32:25] accepting that it's it's for every
[1:32:27] person in the building he wants to make
[1:32:29] you think it's for a day gone by but he
[1:32:32] is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:32:35] and forever and the Bride of Jesus
[1:32:38] Christ she is not just some push-off
[1:32:40] she's not just some schoolgirl she knows
[1:32:43] exactly who she is she know exactly
[1:32:45] where she came from and yes she's a
[1:32:47] paradox yes it's incredible but it's
[1:32:49] true but there is a faith in the body of
[1:32:52] Jesus Christ to do exceedingly
[1:32:54] abundantly above all that you can ever
[1:32:57] ask or think according to the power that
[1:33:00] works on the inside of this body if
[1:33:02] Joshua was anointed you're anointed
[1:33:05] if Moses wasn't on this you're anointed
[1:33:08] if he could ask if God could call angels
[1:33:11] from heaven and say God you that you
[1:33:14] gave will go down there and you watch
[1:33:15] over Moses as he's going down the Nile
[1:33:17] River and you keep him from those
[1:33:19] crocodiles
[1:33:22] what was it
[1:33:23] he was watching over God's anointing you
[1:33:26] recognize that there's an angel that is
[1:33:29] overcharged over top of every single one
[1:33:31] of you here tonight
[1:33:34] now you may not see it but that I feel
[1:33:36] the influence of them here right now
[1:33:39] and I I believe that there are angels
[1:33:42] that are at their posts of Duty you
[1:33:44] remember when Jacob is up there and then
[1:33:47] the Bible said in Genesis that there was
[1:33:49] angels that was descending and ascending
[1:33:51] upon that ladder brother random said
[1:33:53] that God's got angels that are at their
[1:33:55] post adorned post of Duty and they're
[1:33:58] watching over your life to make sure you
[1:34:00] get everything you have need of out of
[1:34:02] this meeting
[1:34:05] all right
[1:34:10] get my angel just a little bit of room
[1:34:12] let him operate right here let him
[1:34:14] operate right here
[1:34:18] what did Eve turn down she turned down
[1:34:21] the rights to the tree of life she
[1:34:23] turned down the word she turned down
[1:34:24] supreme power she she turned down she
[1:34:28] she turned down Adam being able to move
[1:34:30] mountains for him
[1:34:36] she turned down the ability to move
[1:34:38] cancer cells
[1:34:43] who in here is fought cancer before
[1:34:50] who in here fought a bad headache before
[1:34:55] I finally got you to raise your hand
[1:34:59] who in here is fall bad bad backaches
[1:35:01] before
[1:35:05] she was turning down the right
[1:35:09] turning down the rights to control the
[1:35:11] atmospheres brother Matthew
[1:35:16] you think
[1:35:19] to turn down the rights
[1:35:23] to the Tree of Life
[1:35:25] but you're anointed by accepting it
[1:35:30] you're anointed by saying I I accept
[1:35:32] that mountains can be moved I accept
[1:35:35] that squirrels can be created I accept
[1:35:37] that tumors can dissolve I ain't I
[1:35:39] accept the cancer and brain bleeds can
[1:35:41] be broke up I accept that particles can
[1:35:44] come back home I accept the mountains
[1:35:46] can be moved I accept that storms can be
[1:35:49] controlled I accept that death can be
[1:35:52] rolled back I accept that I could go on
[1:35:54] a Rapture I accept him as my savior I
[1:35:57] accept him as Martin delivery I accept
[1:35:59] him as my protector I accept him that is
[1:36:02] going to make me who I'm supposed to be
[1:36:05] you're anointed by accepting what Eve
[1:36:07] turned down
[1:36:10] but what about the rest of the world
[1:36:12] they're anointed by rejecting it but
[1:36:14] you're anointed by accepting it we will
[1:36:17] not turn our backs on you Lord where
[1:36:19] would we go for you only have the words
[1:36:22] of life
[1:36:24] my words are spirit and they are life
[1:36:27] [Music]
[1:36:30] do you think do you think I would turn
[1:36:33] down the rights to break every Cancer
[1:36:35] cell in my dad's body right now do you
[1:36:38] think I would turn down the rights to
[1:36:40] accept complete healing for sister Ruth
[1:36:42] do you think I would turn down the
[1:36:44] rights
[1:36:46] [Applause]
[1:36:50] to set me in free from Every Chain of
[1:36:53] DNA complexes that's been built up in
[1:36:55] their life why in our right mind when we
[1:36:58] turn down the anointing when we return
[1:37:01] down when men would push us aside when
[1:37:04] men would say we're not good enough why
[1:37:06] would we turn down the rights to the
[1:37:08] Tree of Life
[1:37:10] but the Bible said in the Book of
[1:37:11] Revelation I have given you rights as an
[1:37:14] overcomer to the tree of life and if God
[1:37:17] gives you something God ain't taking it
[1:37:20] away
[1:37:24] Joshua was anointed to go into the
[1:37:27] promised land and you're anointed to
[1:37:29] accept the opening of The Seven Seals
[1:37:31] you're not holding a close book you're
[1:37:34] holding the greatest anointed
[1:37:38] that's why Hale is so upset is because
[1:37:40] you are an open book people
[1:37:52] Josh wondered that commission he crossed
[1:37:54] across the Jordan River
[1:37:57] he took down Jericho
[1:38:00] he saved Rahab he conquered the land he
[1:38:04] stopped the sun because he was anointed
[1:38:06] he was anointed to take the land
[1:38:10] and there's a bunch of squatters that's
[1:38:12] trying to keep you off of your Promised
[1:38:13] Land
[1:38:15] he's trying to keep you from the baptism
[1:38:16] of the Holy Ghost he's trying to keep
[1:38:18] you from your breakthrough he's trying
[1:38:20] to keep you from your repentance he's
[1:38:22] trying to keep you from being baptized
[1:38:24] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but
[1:38:26] there's an anointing here that'll make
[1:38:28] sure that you get what you came for
[1:38:30] you see they came up against this
[1:38:32] prodigal or they excuse me they came up
[1:38:34] against these promises they came up
[1:38:36] against these promises with rumors and
[1:38:38] negativity that surely this can't be the
[1:38:40] move of God surely this can't be the
[1:38:42] anointing if it really was the anointing
[1:38:45] God would have chose me to do it God
[1:38:48] would have chose this one to do it no
[1:38:49] God has his way of choosing who he wants
[1:38:52] leading and dividing the words of truth
[1:38:55] yeah
[1:38:56] what did he do he come in there with
[1:38:59] rumors and negativity and tried to keep
[1:39:02] Joshua and Caleb out of their Promised
[1:39:04] Land what was he doing what was he
[1:39:06] afraid of he was afraid that if Joshua
[1:39:08] ever got in he'd never get him out
[1:39:12] let me tell you he is so scared that
[1:39:15] you'll get the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:39:16] he's so scared that you accept this as
[1:39:19] your faith he's so scared that if you
[1:39:21] get in he'll never get you out it's too
[1:39:24] late we've accepted the truth we've
[1:39:27] accepted our breakthrough it's too late
[1:39:29] we've turned down the devil's life it's
[1:39:32] too late we're already here it's too
[1:39:34] late the Raptors in us it's too late it
[1:39:38] is too late devil we're not backing off
[1:39:43] he's trying to keep you from the
[1:39:45] anointing he's trying to keep her from
[1:39:47] worship but God said let go and let God
[1:39:51] let go and let God brother Adams which I
[1:39:55] heard him say today he said some of you
[1:39:57] are afraid to let go and let God just
[1:39:59] give him your habits give him your ideas
[1:40:01] give him your thoughts let go and let
[1:40:04] God he said well I don't know how to let
[1:40:06] God I don't know how to let go and let
[1:40:08] God brother random said yes you do
[1:40:11] [Applause]
[1:40:13] let go
[1:40:15] I don't know how to break free yes you
[1:40:17] do
[1:40:19] okay
[1:40:20] [Applause]
[1:40:21] I don't know how to worship yes you do I
[1:40:24] don't know how to break through yes you
[1:40:26] do whom the son is set free
[1:40:29] is free indeed if your legs are free he
[1:40:32] ain't locking you up
[1:40:36] God said kind of God he can get you in
[1:40:39] and he can get you out
[1:40:41] if Satan got you into trouble gotta get
[1:40:44] you out and Satan put cancer on you
[1:40:46] gotta get it out
[1:40:47] [Applause]
[1:41:01] your Mom and Daddy can be worried
[1:41:04] I need to worry about you all your life
[1:41:08] but one time with the anointing
[1:41:10] one time
[1:41:15] I have found the Messiah
[1:41:17] I have found the Messiah
[1:41:19] I have found him he's right here I have
[1:41:22] found him he told me who I was he called
[1:41:25] me by my name he told me where I came
[1:41:27] from and he told me where I'm going I'm
[1:41:30] not scared about these young boys I know
[1:41:32] that hey if they could accept this
[1:41:34] anointing here
[1:41:36] I don't know why but we're here if they
[1:41:38] can accept this anointing there is no
[1:41:40] stronghold that the devil can put on him
[1:41:43] because there is a weapon that is here
[1:41:45] the cast down every stronghold and every
[1:41:48] Power of hell
[1:41:58] don't you time to take away that
[1:42:00] breakthrough don't you try to take away
[1:42:02] their Joy don't you try to take away
[1:42:04] their dance don't you try to take away
[1:42:06] their shouts aren't you trying to take
[1:42:08] it away if you taking it away you're
[1:42:10] taking away the Breakthrough you're
[1:42:12] taking away their anointing you're
[1:42:13] taking away the Rapture I'm not going to
[1:42:15] take a lag I'm going to give them
[1:42:17] exactly what they need let's give them a
[1:42:20] message diet be fully on the son of man
[1:42:36] hail through me everything
[1:42:40] hell offered me everything you wanted
[1:42:44] he threw money at me
[1:42:48] I won't tell you everything
[1:42:50] because I ain't expecting you to tell me
[1:42:52] everything
[1:42:54] thank you
[1:42:56] thank you
[1:42:57] but hell will offer you all kinds of
[1:43:00] things
[1:43:02] it'll offer you sin
[1:43:04] it'll offer you a bottle
[1:43:07] but it won't show you the man laying
[1:43:09] down there in the gutter
[1:43:10] he won't eat off for a hell or offer you
[1:43:12] a cigarette young boy
[1:43:15] but he won't all he won't show you that
[1:43:17] man laying there in the hospital
[1:43:25] Satan's offer seems real nice
[1:43:28] it seems real pleasing
[1:43:35] I got offered
[1:43:38] Major Baseball League money to do the
[1:43:42] same thing I do every single day
[1:43:51] Satan knows how to offer you things it
[1:43:54] seems real enticing
[1:43:56] I can do the same thing I do every
[1:43:58] single day
[1:44:01] and make Major League Baseball money
[1:44:03] Satan say oh I'm sure I got it
[1:44:08] but you're worth it
[1:44:15] I'd had to give up coming preaching
[1:44:17] these meetings I didn't give up time on
[1:44:19] my family I had to give up time in my
[1:44:21] church I'd had to give up I'd have to
[1:44:23] give up my life to accept what Satan's
[1:44:26] offer was
[1:44:28] but I was anointed to turn down
[1:44:31] because one of these young boys and one
[1:44:34] of these young girls is work every bit
[1:44:37] of energy that I can pour in no I ain't
[1:44:40] delicate in speech but there's an
[1:44:42] anointing here tonight that'll tell you
[1:44:45] burn down the devil's life you're not a
[1:44:47] homosexual you're not going to commit
[1:44:50] suicide you're not going to go the way

[1:45:32] I heard brother banham say the other day
[1:45:34] he said the rest of those Israelites
[1:45:36] believed it could be done he said but it
[1:45:38] was revealed to David that it could be
[1:45:40] done the reason why you're here is
[1:45:43] because it's been revealed to you that
[1:45:46] you are the most powerful people on the
[1:45:48] face of the Earth I'll say cancer ain't
[1:45:51] got a chance standing in front of this

[1:46:22] completely off the script

[1:46:28] author flips the script

[1:46:45] man I went completely different
[1:46:47] than I expected
[1:46:49] well Satan's looking
[1:46:54] Satan's looking at a bunch of lives at
[1:46:56] the author flipped the script on
[1:46:58] it ain't just about discernment tonight
[1:47:01] being flipped on me it's because the
[1:47:03] offer is flipping the script in your
[1:47:05] life and you thought it was going one
[1:47:07] way when your memory was playing painted
[1:47:10] with all kinds of circumstances things
[1:47:12] that your mama said about you things
[1:47:14] that your daddy said about you things
[1:47:16] that the world said about you but you're

[1:47:45] the anointing come and break every yoke
[1:47:47] in here
[1:47:53] no you're not like the first thief in
[1:47:56] the beginning she listened to the
[1:47:58] devil's lies but you're predestinated
[1:48:00] not to do it you're not gonna fail
[1:48:03] you're not going to be defeated you're
[1:48:06] gonna win
[1:48:32] Soldier Boy
[1:48:34] Soldier Boy
[1:48:36] you'll not commit suicide
[1:48:39] what happened the flip got script the
[1:48:43] script got flipped
[1:48:46] you were walking one way and God Turn
[1:48:50] the page on you
[1:48:52] you thought you were hell-bent and he
[1:48:55] thought you were help out but God
[1:48:57] flipped the script Satan thought you had
[1:49:00] it he would Bond it's Satan thoughts he
[1:49:02] had you with alcohol Satan thought he
[1:49:04] had to with pornography that God said
[1:49:06] not today flip the script the blood is
[1:49:09] more powerful Satan's power is not
[1:49:12] enough to break the power of this Blood
[1:49:14] this blood is all powerful this blood is
[1:49:17] Jesus Christ and you
[1:49:21] have the partying power from the inside
[1:49:24] of you that's why brother random said
[1:49:26] she'll be a token to the whole world
[1:49:34] there's been churches
[1:49:36] churches Brides brides but there must
[1:49:40] come one that's both mechanics and
[1:49:44] Dynamics
[1:49:45] let me tell you we've had enough
[1:49:47] intellectualism rise up in this message
[1:49:49] and it's never produced One victory
[1:49:53] you can know every quote and you can be
[1:49:55] a Jack Van Impe of this message and you
[1:49:58] can know it from the 1947 all the way to
[1:50:01] 65. but where you stop I continue
[1:50:05] because the anointing that was on
[1:50:07] William Branham his homeless body
[1:50:09] there's an angel in this room
[1:50:14] it might be dark streets in your family
[1:50:16] history but there's a light that is here
[1:50:18] to break it
[1:50:30] don't touch mining on it
[1:50:33] foreign
[1:50:40] will never win over you
[1:50:42] he thought it could keep you from
[1:50:45] complete Victory but it'll never win
[1:51:05] that anointing try
[1:51:08] and tried and tried
[1:51:10] but when he got you where he wanted you
[1:51:13] it broke
[1:51:19] it made you think it was just for your
[1:51:21] daddy
[1:51:25] anointing for you
[1:51:31] he'll keep your children
[1:51:33] thank you
[1:51:43] I ain't nothing too hard for him
[1:51:47] if he could have a prostitute sitting at
[1:51:49] a well with him
[1:51:57] that would drop her water bottle
[1:52:01] it would make her run back to the men
[1:52:03] that she'd been with before
[1:52:06] I said I have found him
[1:52:10] I have found him I have found him
[1:52:14] and you have run from Well to Well you
[1:52:16] have rung from church to church but the
[1:52:18] Messiah is setting at your well
[1:52:24] they're not going back the same way you
[1:52:26] came in here
[1:52:28] anointing it's not going to leave you
[1:52:31] he's not going to leave you sick he's
[1:52:33] not going to leave your pound he's not
[1:52:35] going to leave you paddling the
[1:52:37] anointing is stronger than ever disease
[1:52:42] the anointing will follow you home the
[1:52:44] anointing will break it
[1:52:51] well I'm going to do everything to stop
[1:52:53] it you can't stop this move you can't
[1:52:56] stop this anointing you can't stop this
[1:52:59] body
[1:53:01] she says thus save the Lord when she
[1:53:04] sets still wants the Harmony in this
[1:53:07] body
[1:53:09] she knows what he wants done with the
[1:53:11] word
[1:53:12] she speaks his word
[1:53:15] by his command
[1:53:22] what is it
[1:53:24] it's the sovereignty of God
[1:53:29] you don't need squirrels tonight
[1:53:32] you don't need a snowstorm rolled out
[1:53:37] but you need that third poor anointing
[1:53:40] to come in your family
[1:53:44] and you feel you liked ever before
[1:53:49] you need that purple anointing
[1:53:52] to go in there
[1:53:54] and cut the last head off
[1:53:56] things that's kept you from your
[1:53:58] breakthrough
[1:53:59] things that's kept you from being free
[1:54:01] in this service things that's held you
[1:54:03] down
[1:54:05] little things that's been laying there
[1:54:12] Satan can't hide under this anointing
[1:54:17] foreign
[1:54:18] because it breaks the yolk
[1:54:23] Jesus was anointed over the Supernatural
[1:54:26] and he cast out devils
[1:54:28] he was anointed and had power over death
[1:54:31] had power over the thing that was
