[37:19] this evening while you're standing with
[37:21] us we want to turn to the Book of Luke
[37:23] the 19th Chapter The Book of Luke the
[37:25] 19th Chapter I think I saw brother
[37:27] Abraham back there God bless you buddy
[37:29] amen a camp Camp friend of mine it's
[37:32] sure good to see you all God bless you
[37:33] the Book of Luke the 19th Chapter
[37:36] we want to look here in the 41st at
[37:39] first
[37:42] everybody love the Lord
[37:44] amen Luke 19.
[37:46] in verse 41
[37:49] and when he was come near he beheld the
[37:51] city
[37:52] and wept over it saying if thou had us
[37:56] known
[37:57] even now at least in this thy day
[38:00] the things which belong unto thy peace
[38:02] but now they are HID from Thine Eyes
[38:04] isn't that a sad situation
[38:07] for the day shall come upon thee that
[38:09] thine enemies shall cast a trench about
[38:11] the incapacity round and keep thee on
[38:13] every side notice this and shall lay
[38:16] thee even with the ground and thy
[38:19] children within thee and they shall not
[38:21] leave in thee one stone upon another
[38:24] now one thing could have avoided all of
[38:26] this and he said because thou knew is
[38:29] not the time of thy visitation had they
[38:33] recognized the time of their visitation
[38:35] it would be a different reading in the
[38:37] previous verses but they did not
[38:39] recognize the time of the visitation now
[38:42] in the book of First Peter the second
[38:43] chapter
[38:45] I want to pull one verse of scripture
[38:47] with you from there in First Peter the
[38:49] second chapter and the 12th verse
[38:53] Peter 2
[38:55] in verse 12 Peter here says having your
[38:58] conversation honest among the Gentiles
[39:01] that were as they speak against you as
[39:04] evil doers they may buy your good works
[39:07] which they Shall Behold glorify God in
[39:11] the day of visitation we ask the Lord
[39:14] this evening to add the blessing to the
[39:15] reading of his word as you can be seated
[39:17] here this afternoon I want to on this
[39:20] Wednesday evening for just a few moments
[39:22] I want to speak to you here and I want
[39:24] to draw our title and our thought from a
[39:26] prayer brother Brown and prays in the
[39:28] uncertain sound I want to read it to you
[39:30] 1962 Spokane Washington he said heavenly
[39:33] father I pray the prayer for them with
[39:35] all my heart I give them to you he says
[39:37] they're trophies of the message they're
[39:39] trophies of your visitation I want to
[39:41] speak tonight on trophies of his
[39:43] visitation they're trophies of the
[39:45] message they are trophies of your
[39:47] visitation being here tonight sin you
[39:49] walk among us doing works that has never
[39:52] been done since the foundation of the
[39:54] world until the these last days here
[39:57] they are they're your children now I
[39:58] commend them to you Lord you give them
[40:00] to us and we give them to you in the
[40:02] name of Jesus Christ watch over them and
[40:04] raise them up at the last day I may
[40:07] never be able to shake their hands on
[40:09] this Earth but when the battle is over
[40:10] and the last trumpet is sounded and the
[40:13] dead has risen from the grave and the
[40:15] life has been called up together with
[40:17] them to meet the Lord in the air then
[40:19] may I have fellowship with Jesus Christ
[40:21] and them around the throne and through
[40:23] the Eternal ages to come he says Grant
[40:26] it Lord they are yours in the name of
[40:28] Jesus Christ amen I believe that's a
[40:30] powerful prayer that a prophet was
[40:32] praying over the church that you're not
[40:34] just church members you're not just
[40:36] citizens of a state or citizens of a
[40:38] country but you're actually amen
[40:40] trophies of something that is of a
[40:42] higher power your trophies of the
[40:44] message your trophies of thy visitation
[40:46] now when you look at this word
[40:47] visitation Webster says it is a special
[40:50] dispensation of divine favor or wrath so
[40:54] a visitation nation is a special
[40:56] dispensation and it's either coming upon
[40:59] whoever let me put it this way however
[41:01] you recognize it will depend on the
[41:03] effect it has upon you if you if you
[41:06] recognize it it is a time of favor if
[41:08] you don't recognize it then there will
[41:10] be a time of Wrath to follow and that's
[41:12] what happened there in Luke the 19th
[41:14] Chapter amen as Jesus told him he said
[41:16] listen amen the time will come and these
[41:19] things will happen but because you did
[41:20] not recognize amen what was being done
[41:23] now your children will be laid in the
[41:24] ground within thee and the enemy will
[41:26] Compass thee amen but if you recognize
[41:29] amen the time of visitation it will be a
[41:32] peace unto you it will be it'll be a
[41:34] special season of favor now when you
[41:35] start looking at this word visitation in
[41:38] the Bible the Bible actually speaks of
[41:40] visitation in job 10 verse 12 he says
[41:43] thou has granted me life and favor and
[41:45] thy visitation has preserved my spirit
[41:48] how many how many can say the visitation
[41:50] of God has preserved your spirit amen
[41:53] thy visitation has preserved spirit in
[41:56] Psalms 102 verse 13 He says Thou shalt
[41:59] arise and have mercy upon Zion for the
[42:02] time to favor her amen yea the set time
[42:05] is come so Zion amen is a type of the
[42:08] Bride right amen and you are the Bride
[42:11] of Jesus Christ so the Bible here says
[42:13] amen that if you would actually go and
[42:15] look at God's calendar there was a time
[42:17] amen that God would favor the bride and
[42:20] he said the set time amen it's not
[42:22] coming and it not has been amen but the
[42:25] set time is now to favor her remember
[42:27] him send me the power amen reached down
[42:29] and pick up the people and shake them
[42:31] Lord and let them realize that this is
[42:34] the day of their visitation this is the
[42:36] time amen that the Lord has said this is
[42:39] the time of their healing now amen I
[42:41] love the way brother remember says that
[42:42] because it's not the time that a man has
[42:44] said it's not the time that a church has
[42:47] said it's not the time amen that a
[42:49] preachers thought well you know now's a
[42:50] good time to go favor amen but actually
[42:52] before the foundation of the world amen
[42:56] the time was set by the almighty God of
[42:58] a season that he would favor amen the
[43:00] end time bride and I'll say it to you
[43:02] like this amen that time is here you say
[43:04] well amen I'm too young or I'm too old
[43:06] but according to a prophet every
[43:08] generation amen receives a visitation
[43:11] amen the prophet of God said we're
[43:13] thinking Our Kind Heavenly Father for
[43:15] this great visitation Amen in our
[43:17] generation that we're now living in Amen
[43:20] to see these things come to pass amen
[43:23] we're living in the time amen where
[43:25] we're not having together three times a
[43:27] week and talk about what God done amen
[43:29] and we're not Gathering to talk about
[43:30] what God's going to do amen but actually
[43:33] we have a focus of what God is doing
[43:35] right here amen we're not just gathering
[43:37] tonight to say well 50 years ago amen
[43:40] God delivered Rose Helen Griffin in 50
[43:42] years from now if God Terry's just
[43:44] coming he'll deliver somebody else but
[43:46] actually amen we can turn our attention
[43:48] from the past and the future Amen to the
[43:51] present and say what God done amen is
[43:53] what God's doing and what he's doing now
[43:55] is what he will continue to do until the
[43:58] changing of our bodies listen I don't
[44:00] believe the church and living God has
[44:01] got to live amen looking in a rear view
[44:04] mirror I don't believe amen that the
[44:06] best days for this bride is behind her
[44:08] amen I believe they're right here upon
[44:10] her and I believe they're in front of
[44:12] her listen you say well we've seen a lot
[44:14] of healings but I propose amen will see
[44:16] more amen well we've seen a lot of
[44:18] Miracles but I propose amen will see
[44:20] more miracles well brother Andrew we've
[44:22] seen a lot of prayers answered for
[44:24] unbearing wounds amen but I propose
[44:26] we'll see more prayers answered amen
[44:28] because this is the time amen that God
[44:31] is Not favoring the generation of Noah

[44:35] Samson but he's favoring the generation
[44:37] of this end time bride now amen I think

[45:05] that raised Jesus from the grave is
[45:08] right here in our midst now he meant the
[45:11] same spirit that raised our Lord amen

[45:16] Jerusalem tonight it's not in a tomb in
[45:19] Jeffersonville it's not in a building in
[45:21] Jeffersonville amen but the spirit of
[45:23] the Lord is in his word and his word is
[45:26] in his bride then I propose to you
[45:28] tonight amen that my God is not dead
[45:31] amen my God is alive he is well he is
[45:35] still saving he is still delivering he

[51:07] talk about it no more but you're not
[51:09] crazy to believe it right now
[51:13] right now you are the sons of God
[51:15] remember him said these things that
[51:17] we're seeing today they couldn't happen
[51:19] 20 years ago
[51:21] things you're seeing happen today he
[51:24] said they couldn't happen 20 years ago
[51:25] amen or even 40 years ago but it today
[51:28] it happens because this is the hour
[51:32] [Applause]
[51:34] this is the time this is the time it's
[51:37] fulfilled why because God promised it
[51:39] and here it is amen so when you
[51:41] recognize that now is the time now is
[51:43] the hour now is the season today is the
[51:46] day amen and you are the generation
[51:49] receiving this visitation then it'll
[51:51] open up a whole new meaning to you when
[51:53] I call you a trophy the problem of God
[51:56] set the end of the prayer of token 1963
[51:58] he said if there be a seed anywhere
[52:00] that's predestinated Lord to hear the
[52:02] word of this last day may they come now
[52:05] amen sweetly and humbly and lay their
[52:08] trophies down at the cross
[52:11] now he said if there's a seed anywhere
[52:13] and they hear this word he said may they
[52:16] come so they as a person right so here
[52:18] comes a person and they lay their
[52:21] trophies down at the cross Now watch how
[52:23] he turns his and says or their self as a
[52:26] trophy
[52:28] so he no longer is calling it an object
[52:30] amen but now the trophy has become you
[52:34] oh God now the trophy is no longer
[52:37] something that you are holding in your
[52:39] hand as a representation of a victory
[52:42] past or a victory future amen but he
[52:45] said may they come and as they're laying
[52:48] their trophies down may they recognize
[52:50] it the trophy is not marble amen it's
[52:53] not granted it's not gold they've been
[52:55] but the trophy is the human and may they
[52:57] lay themself down as a trophy of the
[53:00] grace of God that's called them and may
[53:02] they be filled with the Holy Spirit
[53:04] oh God and this play the token of the
[53:07] life of Jesus Christ in his resurrection
[53:10] as long as they remain here on the earth
[53:13] I could preach on that quote for 30
[53:15] minutes amen because in one prayer amen
[53:17] Silas he changed amen the trophy from
[53:20] being an object to being a person then
[53:22] he included the token and then he said
[53:24] may as long as they remain on the earth
[53:26] may they be a trophy of the grace that
[53:29] called them amen out of Darkness into
[53:31] this marvelous life listen I'm gonna go
[53:33] ahead and say it you don't have to go to
[53:35] heaven to be a trophy
[53:37] you don't have to die to be a trophy I
[53:40] mean you don't have to wait till till
[53:41] the bind by or the great Hereafter amen
[53:43] but according to a prophet amen you are
[53:46] to be a trophy as long as you remain on
[53:49] the earth amen I believe that there's a
[53:51] bride who's not waiting to get to heaven
[53:53] in order to enjoy him and amen but she's
[53:56] enjoying Heaven on the earth amen
[53:58] because the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[54:00] has brought a discipline has brought a
[54:03] deposit of Heaven into your soul listen
[54:05] friends I don't think we got to wait
[54:07] until we get on the other side Amen to
[54:09] shout and rejoice amen but I believe
[54:12] right here on a Wednesday night when the
[54:14] word is being preached and the message
[54:16] is having preeminence I believe we got a
[54:18] right to shout I believe we got a right
[54:20] to Rejoice among church do you realize
[54:23] what you are you are the answer to the
[54:25] Father's prayer you are the answer to
[54:27] Our Father's prayer when he stood upon
[54:29] the Earth he said father let thy kingdom
[54:32] come he said let thy will be done amen
[54:35] where On Earth as it is and heaven in
[54:38] other words there would be a kingdom
[54:39] people who would be regenerated by the
[54:42] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the blood
[54:44] of Jesus and they would be manifesting
[54:47] heaven on Earth listen I believe
[54:49] somebody is going to manifest
[54:51] forgiveness here on the earth I believe
[54:53] somebody is going to manifest the
[54:55] ability to live above sin right here I
[54:58] do not believe these things are just in
[55:00] the future Church
[55:02] I believe your trophies of the grace of
[55:05] God that has called you now a trophy has
[55:07] got to be displayed anybody anybody ever
[55:09] got a trophy in anybody two of you three
[55:12] of you you ever got a trophy you never
[55:15] took that Trophy and hit it but you
[55:17] wanted everybody to see it come on now
[55:20] and then you hung it on your wall you
[55:22] come on people even build what they call
[55:23] Trophy showcases amen cause they want
[55:26] everybody to see amen their trophy I
[55:28] remember I remember in high school it's
[55:30] about my junior year it was graduation
[55:32] and awards night and they was giving out
[55:34] Awards and trophies and so they're
[55:35] sitting there passing them out and here
[55:37] gets somebody up for a 3.5 GPA and here
[55:40] comes somebody for a 4.0 you know and
[55:43] I'm just kind of sitting there saying
[55:44] thank God for open book tests you know
[55:46] it's the only way I graduated and I'm
[55:48] just sitting there and then all of a
[55:49] sudden they call my name and I said well
[55:51] I said I don't know what I'd be getting
[55:53] the trophy for because him grades ain't
[55:55] testifying to them numbers and not that
[55:57] time they said Andrew Glover we award
[56:00] you with the trophy of Christian conduct
[56:02] now I know some people probably looked
[56:04] at me like that's crazy amen but I
[56:06] shouted higher about that than I did
[56:07] about a 4.0 they say well why would you
[56:10] shout amen because I was thankful that
[56:12] somebody amen could see what Jesus
[56:14] Christ had done in my life and not
[56:17] acknowledged me but acknowledge Him amen
[56:19] where did the strength come from to get
[56:21] it it comes from Jesus Christ where did
[56:24] the grace come Amen to manifest a
[56:26] christ-like character it did not come
[56:28] from school it did not come from
[56:30] education it comes from the baptism of
[56:33] the Holy Ghost that God In My Soul as a
[56:36] 12 year old boy in a room in Dry Creek
[56:38] Louisiana and it's never got out because
[56:41] it's Jesus and he made me a trophy I may
[56:44] not have much I may not look like much
[56:46] amen but in the eyes of my father I am a
[56:50] trophy of the grace of Jesus Christ and
[56:52] it's called me out of Darkness it called
[56:55] me out of confusion it called me out of
[56:57] the past it called me out of stars it
[57:00] called me out of Destruction
[57:04] I think it's time we let a lost and
[57:07] Dying World see the trophies of almighty
[57:10] God
[57:11] a trophy is something that ought to be
[57:14] displayed now when you look at the word
[57:16] Webster Webster's definition of trophy
[57:18] it means something gained it means
[57:21] something achieved or given in Victory
[57:23] or Conquest especially when preserved or
[57:26] mounted as a memorial it is a
[57:29] representation of such a memorial as on
[57:32] a mantle see it is a game animal or a
[57:35] fish that is suitable for mounting as a
[57:37] trophy I love this part it is usually
[57:40] used attributively so actually what a
[57:44] trophy is is a trophy is an expression
[57:47] or an expressed attribute of victory
[57:51] a trophy is an expressed attribute of
[57:54] Victory now the problem said God's
[57:56] secret mystery he had before the world
[57:58] began he said now in the back part of
[58:01] God's mind he said there was something
[58:03] he was trying and was going to achieve
[58:06] what is a trophy it is something that is
[58:08] given Amen in exchange for something
[58:11] that is achieved amen he was going to
[58:13] try he was going to achieve and he had a
[58:16] motive in doing it in order to let
[58:17] himself be expressed because first there
[58:19] wasn't an atom there wasn't a moon a
[58:21] star a molecule anything he was God but
[58:24] he actually wasn't God at that time
[58:25] because God is an object of worship and
[58:28] there was nothing to worship him so in
[58:31] his great mind he wanted those
[58:33] attributes to be expressed and in him
[58:36] was love in him was to be a father in
[58:38] him was to be a son in him was to be a
[58:41] savior in him was to be a Healer and all
[58:43] these great attributes we see already
[58:46] expressed they were in God now you know
[58:49] the first thing created there Amen in
[58:51] the mind if God was Angels right amen
[58:53] and Angels what could they do they could
[58:56] hear him say I'm a father and they would
[58:58] say yes you're a father they could hear
[59:00] him say I'm a savior and they would say
[59:02] yes you're a savior they can hear him
[59:04] say I'm a Healer he would say yes you're
[59:06] a Healer brother brother will you make
[59:07] it hear him say I'm a deliverer and they
[59:09] would repeat back to him yes sure
[59:11] deliver amen but those angels had no
[59:13] clue what they were talking about
[59:16] they had no clue what they were talking
[59:19] about amen because they had never
[59:21] experienced what he was talking about so
[59:24] they could he could say I'm a Healer and
[59:26] they could say yes you're a Healer he
[59:27] could say I would liver and they could
[59:29] say yes your liver amen can I go and say
[59:31] it angels are not trophies they meant of
[59:34] the attributes of Jesus Christ amen
[59:36] because they've never experienced
[59:38] they've been the powerful force that's
[59:40] in those attributes amen but who has
[59:42] more power before God Amen an angel that
[59:45] is never sin or a redeemed son and
[59:47] daughter of God and according to a
[59:49] Vindicated Prophet a redeemed son has
[59:52] more Authority before God than an Angel
[59:54] that's never notes him listen the angels
[59:57] can agree by hearing it amen but you can
[59:59] agree by experiencing it amen and he can
[1:00:02] come to this building tonight and say
[1:00:04] I'm a Healer and something in your
[1:00:06] hearts will begin to scream out yes
[1:00:08] you're a Healer amen he can say I'm a
[1:00:10] deliverer and something in your hearts
[1:00:12] amen will bring you to your feet and
[1:00:14] you'll say that's right Prophet God you
[1:00:16] are deliver amen not because you
[1:00:19] delivered my friend amen but because you
[1:00:21] delivered me you can say I am ahead oh
[1:00:24] God I'm a love I'm a lover and he can
[1:00:27] say yes Lord You're a lover because

[1:00:49] then you say amen and according to a
[1:00:52] prophet you are nothing but the
[1:00:54] manifestation of the gene of life that

[1:00:59] expressed after his word has come in you

[1:01:28] since before the foundation of the world
[1:01:31] he was not hoping there would be
[1:01:33] somebody upon the Earth to recognize it
[1:01:35] he was not hoping somebody would come
[1:01:37] stumbling along and brother Lambert say
[1:01:40] well he's worthy to be praised but he
[1:01:42] knew what he would begin to release this
[1:01:44] Authority there would be a bride upon

[1:09:03] wait till the Earth receives that
[1:09:05] baptism he said then you'll see it now
[1:09:07] when Abraham speaks about these trophies
[1:09:09] in the message I love it because he
[1:09:11] mainly refers a mentor trophies in
[1:09:13] prayer and remember say when you go to
[1:09:15] prayer he said the first thing you do is
[1:09:17] you go to God with a worship and a
[1:09:19] Thanksgiving right so when he's praying
[1:09:21] he's actually worshiping God and giving
[1:09:24] God Thanksgiving for trophies which are
[1:09:26] not objects but they're humans he said
[1:09:28] like this they're trophies of this
[1:09:30] meeting their trophies of the message
[1:09:32] they are trophies of the presence of the
[1:09:34] Lord they are trophies of the grace of

[1:09:51] spirit of the Lord their trophies of the
[1:09:53] message that even in the lifetime I love
[1:09:54] this when they're trophies amen of the
[1:09:57] ministry of the seventh angel so you're

[1:10:08] visitation of God in this generation now
[1:10:10] when you start looking at this trophies
[1:10:12] amen then brother man will connect these
[1:10:14] scriptures with trophies he'll say it
[1:10:16] like this in John 5 24 verily verily I
[1:10:18] say unto you he that heareth my word and
[1:10:20] believeth on him that sent me half
[1:10:22] everlasting life and shall not come into
[1:10:25] condemnation but it's passed from Death
[1:10:27] unto life in John 6 37 all that the
[1:10:30] father giveth me shall come to me and
[1:10:32] him that cometh to me I will in no wise
[1:10:34] cast out in John 10 28 I give unto them
[1:10:37] eternal life and they shall never perish
[1:10:39] neither shall any man pluck them out of
[1:10:41] my hand for my Father which gave them me
[1:10:44] is greater than all and the one and no
[1:10:47] man is able to pluck them out of my
[1:10:49] father's hand remember said all these
[1:10:52] are trophies that God has given to his
[1:10:54] son Christ Jesus by the power of His
[1:10:57] presence and the word of God my you are
[1:11:00] a trophy that God has been given amen by
[1:11:04] the power of His presence by the power
[1:11:06] of his word and by Jesus Christ that in
[1:11:09] other words the message of the hour amen
[1:11:12] is a claiming message amen that has
[1:11:14] claimed you for a purpose can he say
[1:11:16] Amen the blood REM said I claim them for
[1:11:18] you tonight Jesus as your own personal

[1:11:57] you then it's claims you not on by
[1:11:59] accident but it's claimed you on purpose
[1:12:01] amen for a purpose and by purpose can I
[1:12:04] say it to you like this you were claimed
[1:12:06] to be a trophy
[1:12:10] the message did not claim you to be a
[1:12:13] debater
[1:12:14] the message did not claim you to be a
[1:12:16] better quota the message did not claim
[1:12:19] you they meant to be a better memorizer
[1:12:21] amen the message claimed you ain't meant
[1:12:24] to be a trophy of what it was doing in
[1:12:26] the generation that you were living in
[1:12:28] in other words God's trophies are living
[1:12:31] trophies somebody say well amen
[1:12:33] everybody that's dead must be trophies
[1:12:35] but according to Ephesians 2 and verse 5
[1:12:37] even when we were dead in sin have
[1:12:40] quickened us together with Christ by
[1:12:42] Grace ye are saved look at this word
[1:12:44] dead it means spiritually dead it means
[1:12:47] destitute of a life that recognizes and
[1:12:50] is devoted to God people say well
[1:12:52] someday when I when I when I breathe my
[1:12:54] last breath and I go on to Eternity man
[1:12:57] I'll be a trophy over there but I
[1:12:59] believe there's going to be some
[1:13:00] Believers that still got breath in their
[1:13:02] lungs
[1:13:04] well brother Andrew I don't know what
[1:13:05] program said here is those who were dead

[1:13:10] who have been in accidents and were
[1:13:11] smashed up and they are healed he said I
[1:13:13] see Miss Wilson standing there not long
[1:13:15] ago she was hemorrhaging to dance with
[1:13:17] TB years ago but here she is tonight the
[1:13:20] doctors didn't just give her but just

[1:13:31] living trophies why is it Jesus Christ
[1:13:34] lives and he is the same yesterday today
[1:13:37] and forever come on church amen an angel
[1:13:40] has visited this generation and it was
[1:13:43] not some angel that was hatched out of
[1:13:45] some man's Revival but it was the angel
[1:13:48] of the covenants it was the angel of the
[1:13:50] Lord and his return to this generation
[1:13:52] come on church and we've got innumerable
[1:13:55] manifestations come on right come on
[1:13:57] right here in this message alone we've
[1:14:00] got innumerable manifestations of the
[1:14:02] supernatural visitation of the angel of
[1:14:05] God in the generation we're living I say
[1:14:07] it's time to start picking up these
[1:14:09] testimonies and fighting back against
[1:14:11] that devil I think it's time to quit
[1:14:13] letting testimonies pile up and just be
[1:14:15] memories and landmarks of what God done
[1:14:17] I think it's time to pick up a testimony
[1:14:20] tonight and throw it back if that devil
[1:14:22] I think it's time to pick up a testimony
[1:14:24] of a young person getting the Holy Ghost
[1:14:26] and throw it back at that line therefore
[1:14:28] it says God don't give the Holy Ghost I
[1:14:31] think it's time
[1:14:33] I think it's time to pick up a testimony
[1:14:35] of a lying devil that says God don't
[1:14:37] heal cancer and throw a witness if that
[1:14:39] devil
[1:14:43] well it's the truth whether you want to
[1:14:44] believe it or not there is more with us
[1:14:46] than there is with them
[1:14:47] [Applause]
[1:14:49] I said there's more brother Derek with
[1:14:51] us than there is with him and the
[1:14:53] prophet of God said I guess in the
[1:14:54] providences of Canada alone there was
[1:14:57] over
[1:14:57] 250 or maybe more than that cases of
[1:15:01] cross-eyed people with their eyes
[1:15:03] straightened and mutually numerable to
[1:15:05] count them for there was multiplied
[1:15:06] scores of them that came some were deaf
[1:15:09] some are done some hard of hearing
[1:15:11] everything were made perfectly whole
[1:15:12] that's only done through the visitation
[1:15:15] of the angel
[1:15:18] the death only here through the
[1:15:20] visitation of the Angel the blind only
[1:15:22] see through the visitation of the Angel
[1:15:24] oh God help me Lord the dead are only
[1:15:27] raised to the visitation of the Angel
[1:15:29] amen you you get a breakthrough only
[1:15:32] because of the visitation of the angel
[1:15:34] now God gives four warnings amen signs
[1:15:38] of his visitation
[1:15:40] in other words God does not show up
[1:15:42] unannounced
[1:15:44] but according to a prophet he said if
[1:15:46] the death don't hear and the dumb don't
[1:15:49] speak and the blind don't see and the
[1:15:51] cripples didn't walk if Prophecies of
[1:15:53] sin isn't foretold the people and your
[1:15:55] sins from the time that he was a child
[1:15:57] foretold then believe that this Angel
[1:15:59] has come to me as a false and I'm false
[1:16:01] with it
[1:16:02] come on if the deaf don't hear the blind
[1:16:04] don't say the dumb don't speak he said
[1:16:06] sins revealed told from childhood things
[1:16:08] if that's not if that's false and I'm
[1:16:11] false with it he said but if it
[1:16:13] manifests itself here on the platform
[1:16:15] amen before you you believe it and
[1:16:18] repent of your sins and disbelieve for
[1:16:21] the hour of his visitation is Drawing
[1:16:23] Near that's right he only done those
[1:16:26] things to confirm his word then pray
[1:16:28] tell me why was Jesus Christ the son of
[1:16:31] God Amen laying a foundation of John 14
[1:16:34] 12 before he even left the Earth amen
[1:16:37] because there was a bride who was coming
[1:16:39] behind him that would do those Greater
[1:16:42] Works
[1:16:44] he said Greater Works in this shall you
[1:16:46] do because I go to my father amen
[1:16:48] notices Greater Works than they say you
[1:16:50] do now brother said can I can I break
[1:16:52] this down for you he said Jesus in his
[1:16:54] ministry he said Greater Works than they
[1:16:56] say you do he said now nothing could be
[1:16:58] any greater than what he did he said now
[1:17:00] what's happening there is it's the same
[1:17:03] thing he did he promised the church to
[1:17:06] do the same thing Jesus Christ did is
[1:17:10] what he promised the church to do only
[1:17:12] more of it than what he did so the only
[1:17:15] thing that changes is not the quality
[1:17:18] it's the quantity he stopped nature he
[1:17:21] raised the dead he spoke to Nature
[1:17:23] brother Daryl he took a fish and bread
[1:17:25] and fed five thousand amen what greater
[1:17:28] could be done than the creative power of
[1:17:30] Jesus Christ manifested in his son upon
[1:17:33] the Earth amen but in the end times the
[1:17:36] same God that was back there is going to
[1:17:38] return to the church that's here and it
[1:17:40] would not be equality it would be a
[1:17:42] quantity so it would know God it would
[1:17:45] no longer just be in one man it would be
[1:17:48] in a many-membered body Universal which
[1:17:51] would be fulfilled in John 14 12. now I
[1:17:53] just got to preach my heart amen because
[1:17:55] man is not doing these things
[1:17:58] come on have we have we come so far
[1:18:00] removed from what a prophet said the
[1:18:02] greatest prophet of Our Generation the
[1:18:04] greatest Ministry since Jesus Christ
[1:18:06] could stand on the earth and say I was
[1:18:08] not the one that done it I was only
[1:18:10] standing there when he done it come on
[1:18:13] church amen I just got to preach my
[1:18:15] heart to you amen I've heard guys
[1:18:16] testify and if I didn't know any better
[1:18:18] I wouldn't think anybody in the building
[1:18:20] was there but them amen because
[1:18:21] everything's brought upon me I wouldn't
[1:18:23] even know Jesus was there amen but
[1:18:25] because there's a real body and there's
[1:18:28] a real bride amen every one of these
[1:18:30] brothers sitting here recognizes they
[1:18:32] don't have power Amen in their physical
[1:18:34] body to release you from them demons and
[1:18:36] torment amen but they recognize the
[1:18:39] angel of God is in the church and if he
[1:18:42] is here then every demon is subject if
[1:18:44] he is here ever sickness and disease
[1:18:47] that's lost its hold
[1:18:50] among church it's not the man it's the
[1:18:53] angel come on you say preacher why do
[1:18:55] these guys get up and start song service
[1:18:57] and say now clap your hands and say amen
[1:19:00] amen because the Angels here and he
[1:19:02] comes reasonvided but he only stays
[1:19:05] where he's made welcome and don't you
[1:19:06] think it's time Amen to start
[1:19:08] entertaining the angel
[1:19:10] you say well brother Andrew how do I
[1:19:12] entertain the angel you got to wake up
[1:19:14] and forget about who's around you and
[1:19:16] forget about who's not here and forget
[1:19:18] about who didn't Shake whose hand and
[1:19:20] who didn't invite whose party well I
[1:19:22] feel like preaching I might as well hat
[1:19:24] now come on church and realize we're
[1:19:26] here for more than a social Gathering
[1:19:28] amen but the angel of the covenants has
[1:19:31] descended into the church in the last
[1:19:34] days to make good his Divine promises
[1:19:38] somebody entertaining
[1:19:42] I said somebody entertaining they say
[1:19:44] well preacher how do I entertain him
[1:19:46] hallelujah thank you Jesus that ain't
[1:19:49] nothing but the truth
[1:19:52] I tell you how you entertain the angel
[1:19:54] you don't make brother Tim preach his
[1:19:56] guts out and then finally decide to say
[1:19:58] Amen
[1:20:00] from the very first word go you say amen
[1:20:03] that's right come on church I I I'm just
[1:20:06] going to preacher for a second can I
[1:20:08] preach amen you're a man unlocks another
[1:20:10] dimension in these meetings
[1:20:13] come on brother Tim can spend 80 hours a
[1:20:15] week he can sit in the room with a Bible
[1:20:17] and his computer and the tapes amen and
[1:20:20] get every bit of manna and come this
[1:20:22] pulpit and he can labor and labor and
[1:20:24] labor and labor and I'll tell you what
[1:20:25] brother Tim will do he'll get it off his
[1:20:27] heart because he's not a hireling he's a
[1:20:29] preacher but if you want to see that
[1:20:31] gift go into another realm amen get off
[1:20:34] the nonsense before church and come in
[1:20:36] the house of God and from the very first
[1:20:39] word go say that's the truth speak to me
[1:20:42] Lord I entertain your presence and
[1:20:44] you're a man will reach into that gift
[1:20:47] and will unlock the power of the Holy
[1:20:50] Ghost and it'll break out in the church
[1:20:52] and the word will discern situations
[1:20:54] it'll change circumstances I still
[1:20:57] believe in old-fashioned Holy Ghost Land
[1:20:59] Son of God inspired preaching
[1:21:03] say we ought to open up the anointing we
[1:21:06] ought to open up the channels we ought
[1:21:07] to open up the atmosphere
[1:21:12] you got to open it up well I don't feel
[1:21:15] like it you got to open it up anyhow
[1:21:17] well I'm too tired you don't think these
[1:21:19] men of God come out here sometimes and
[1:21:21] they're physically drained but if they
[1:21:23] get out here anyhow and they preach
[1:21:25] their heart out you know why because
[1:21:27] they're doing it as a sacrifice of
[1:21:29] praising to God
[1:21:31] well I don't know how I got here but I'm
[1:21:33] here amen sometimes you gotta sacrifice
[1:21:36] a little bit and get out of your comfort
[1:21:38] zone and acknowledge the presence of the
[1:21:41] angel
[1:21:44] you're unlocked your amen unlocks the
[1:21:47] supernatural
[1:21:49] now
[1:21:50] well brother Andrew we've seen enough I
[1:21:52] don't think we have

[1:22:41] and a half sermon and then a few prayers
[1:22:43] and it's time to go amen but do you know
[1:22:45] the greatest Miracles I've seen is when
[1:22:47] people are willing to forget what time

[1:22:52] His word is still true and his power is
[1:22:54] still here come on you say well it's

[1:23:59] now brother the Bible said can I have a
[1:24:01] few more minutes here
[1:24:02] [Applause]
[1:24:03] the Bible said in John 21 25 when they
[1:24:06] come down to the end of Jesus ministry
[1:24:09] they said there are so many other things
[1:24:10] which Jesus did the witch if they should
[1:24:13] be written everyone I suppose that even
[1:24:16] the world itself
[1:24:18] are you reading what I'm reading
[1:24:20] the world itself could not contain the
[1:24:24] books that should be written
[1:24:29] but hell he's still on the Earth
[1:24:33] he's still here in a corporate body
[1:24:35] and they're all ready saying what we've
[1:24:38] seen in this three and a half year
[1:24:40] Ministry could not even be recorded in
[1:24:43] books brother Brandon comes along and
[1:24:46] says wish I could testify a little bit
[1:24:48] of the things I've seen happen just in
[1:24:50] the last few weeks oh and I could
[1:24:52] testify you know it was John that said
[1:24:54] if Jesus done with me putting books
[1:24:56] there wasn't enough books in the world
[1:24:57] to write for him just what I've seen in
[1:24:59] my own Ministry seen him do you couldn't
[1:25:01] pile them in volumes on this platform
[1:25:04] here if I wrote it in the details when I
[1:25:07] seen him do just in my own Ministry seen
[1:25:09] him do see he had more success in my
[1:25:13] Ministry than he did in his own now
[1:25:16] remember he had more success now not me
[1:25:19] he had
[1:25:20] did you catch that word sister Debbie
[1:25:22] now
[1:25:25] now he had more success in my Ministry
[1:25:29] than he did his own he said he had more
[1:25:31] success in Jeffersonville than he did in
[1:25:33] Nazareth you say why because he finally
[1:25:36] broke through here he had more success
[1:25:39] right here than he did in Capernaum or
[1:25:41] Nazareth in that day see now notice this
[1:25:43] he done it now I never said I've done it
[1:25:46] see no cause I didn't do it I just
[1:25:48] didn't now can I tell you what he did
[1:25:50] though to see him do what he did to have
[1:25:52] more success in his ministry than in his
[1:25:54] own
[1:25:57] he said I just loved him
[1:26:00] and submitted myself to him and said
[1:26:03] what he said and the Holy Spirit went to
[1:26:06] the other people and they believed what
[1:26:09] he said then he'd done the work
[1:26:13] I just loved him I just submitted myself
[1:26:16] to oh I feel like preaching and I said
[1:26:19] what he said and the Holy Spirit went to
[1:26:21] the other people and they believed what
[1:26:23] he said then he done the work see then
[1:26:27] in Luke 19 first Peter 2 he speaks of
[1:26:30] this day of visitation so you got to
[1:26:32] love him that is visiting you're going
[1:26:34] to submit your heart to him that is
[1:26:36] visiting see it's the day of visitation
[1:26:38] it's the hour of visitation it's the
[1:26:41] time of visitation now the Bible is
[1:26:43] speaking here of the coming of the
[1:26:45] Messiah which was the very presence of
[1:26:47] God himself now the Bible said in Luke
[1:26:50] 19 41 he beheld the city and wept over
[1:26:53] it saying it foul had its known even
[1:26:55] thou at least in the day the things
[1:26:58] which belong in thy peace but now
[1:26:59] they're hid from thine eyes for the date
[1:27:01] shall come upon thee that thine enemy
[1:27:03] shall cast a trance about thee and
[1:27:05] compassionly around and keep being every
[1:27:07] side notice this because thou knew is
[1:27:09] not the time of thy visitation somebody
[1:27:12] said that word newest
[1:27:13] thou knew it's not the time of thy
[1:27:16] visitation now you say brother Andrew
[1:27:17] why are you drawing that point out
[1:27:19] because he only appears to those who are
[1:27:23] looking for him
[1:27:25] he only appears to those who are looking
[1:27:29] for him you say who is he appearing to
[1:27:31] he is not appearing to people brother
[1:27:33] Derek based on who they are
[1:27:37] oh God he's not where people say well
[1:27:41] bless God I'm a message believer so he's
[1:27:43] got to appear to me well but Scotty
[1:27:45] don't
[1:27:46] come on well brother I tell you who my
[1:27:49] daddy is he's going to appear to me well
[1:27:51] I tell you who your daddy is and he
[1:27:52] still don't have to because it's not
[1:27:54] he's not appearing to you based on who
[1:27:57] you are he's appearing to you based on
[1:27:59] what you will be
[1:28:01] come on Church the Pharisees saw him the
[1:28:04] Pharisees heard of him and they remain
[1:28:06] Pharisees they remain critical in
[1:28:09] different nitpicking come on decisive
[1:28:12] tearing everything apart amen his
[1:28:14] visitation did not change their
[1:28:17] condition
[1:28:19] his visitation did not change their
[1:28:21] position but can I tell you about one
[1:28:23] she's called the woman at the well
[1:28:25] [Applause]
[1:28:27] the woman at the whale said I know that
[1:28:31] Messiah cometh which is the cold Christ
[1:28:33] and when he has come he will tell us all
[1:28:35] things do you know what that word no
[1:28:37] means it means to have an interview with
[1:28:40] it means to visit so I know when Messiah
[1:28:44] comes oh God and I have an interview
[1:28:47] with Messiah
[1:28:50] and a visitation with him it will change
[1:28:53] me Jesus happened to her I am he that
[1:28:55] speaking to eat notice this remember
[1:28:57] said the woman at the well recognized
[1:29:00] her day by the sign of the Messiah when
[1:29:03] she recognized her hour of visitation
[1:29:05] she became a trophy of his visitation
[1:29:09] remember said if you receive him to them
[1:29:12] he give power to become the sons of God
[1:29:13] even to them that believe on his name so
[1:29:16] many of them missed him in that day
[1:29:18] don't you miss it in your day not me now
[1:29:20] him it's the day of his visitation I'm
[1:29:24] just a poor substitute of anything but
[1:29:26] it's him moving it's him working he just
[1:29:29] give me away a gift to heal myself to
[1:29:31] him and do these things for your benefit
[1:29:32] not for mine for yours so it's for you
[1:29:35] listen in other words as many as
[1:29:38] recognized him and entertained his
[1:29:41] visitation to them he changed their
[1:29:44] condition you all remember the Book of
[1:29:46] Genesis 18 when Abraham and Sarah sat in
[1:29:49] the tent right and here come the angel
[1:29:51] right and the Bible said Abraham kind of
[1:29:53] looked around and blinked his eyes
[1:29:54] checked his phone stretched a little bit
[1:29:56] and said well maybe Sarah will get up
[1:29:58] and do something go somewhere
[1:30:00] it's not what my Bible reads brother
[1:30:02] Jimbo my Bible says Abraham a hastened
[1:30:05] into the tent and the Sarah and said
[1:30:07] make ready quickly three measures of
[1:30:10] fine meal and need it and make three
[1:30:12] cakes upon the Hearth and Abraham ran
[1:30:14] into the herd and fetched the calf
[1:30:16] tender and good and gave it to a young
[1:30:17] man and he hastened to dress him and he
[1:30:19] took butter and milk in the calf which
[1:30:21] he dressed and said it before them and
[1:30:22] he stood by them under the tree and they
[1:30:24] did eat what did Abraham do he
[1:30:27] recognized this is my hour of visitation
[1:30:30] he was setting in the tent door on a
[1:30:33] real hot day he said there was a lot of
[1:30:35] complaints coming in Lately by the
[1:30:36] herdsmen if the grass was all gone the
[1:30:38] land was dried up and the cattle was
[1:30:40] becoming very thin the water supply was
[1:30:42] just about all gone you know sometimes
[1:30:45] amen when things are going wrong We Know
[1:30:47] by Nature that it's the darkest just
[1:30:49] before day and many times when we see
[1:30:52] disaster things happen like that
[1:30:54] especially to Believers we must bear
[1:30:58] this in our mind that it's Satan trying
[1:31:00] and to block the blessing that's on the
[1:31:03] road
[1:31:06] can I just preach to you in the line
[1:31:07] there's a blessing on its Road there's a
[1:31:10] blessing on its way there's a blessing
[1:31:11] in the building there's a miracle in the
[1:31:13] building but you know what that old
[1:31:15] dirty devil does I don't Slew Foot
[1:31:16] Creeps in and he tries to mock the

[1:37:35] woman as a whale to a trophy
[1:37:39] it's going to transform you from a
[1:37:42] condemned son to a redeemed Son of God

[1:38:28] are
[1:38:38] well you need to clock them prayer lines
[1:38:40] down you need to quit having so many
[1:38:42] prayer lines because it's just weakening
[1:38:44] faith I know a prophet said bad amen but
[1:38:47] what about the ones that's getting faith
[1:38:48] stronger every time they go through
[1:38:51] come on church I still believe somebody
[1:38:54] go through a prayer line 31 times sister
[1:38:55] Lydia and on the 32nd time could be the
[1:38:58] night they step in their miracle
[1:39:02] well it's here some might as well
[1:39:03] entertain it I think it's time to let go
[1:39:05] and let God have his way
[1:39:08] we're not here to be trophies of
[1:39:10] criticism we're here to be trophy you
[1:39:12] all know what I preached over in
[1:39:14] Oklahoma amen the devil has come to its
[1:39:16] end I'm gonna preach on it here for a
[1:39:18] second the devil has come to his hand
[1:39:19] you know what I told you I feel like I
[1:39:21] just feel it on me so I'm gonna
[1:39:22] preaching brother Tim you got to put
[1:39:24] your foot on that devil
[1:39:26] you got to put your foot on that devil
[1:39:29] you are a devil stomping serpent bruise
[1:39:31] and trophy of the visitation of Jesus
[1:39:34] Christ
[1:39:37] then you got to put your foot on that
[1:39:39] devil I'm not gonna read it to you I'm
[1:39:41] just going to preach it to you the Bible
[1:39:42] says in Genesis 3 amen that the Messiah
[1:39:45] said amen would bruise the head of the
[1:39:47] serpent right who was stomping do that
[1:39:49] again that felt pretty good amen amen
[1:39:51] the serpent whose head would be bruised
[1:39:54] by the by the by the seat of the woman
[1:39:56] and the Bible said that that devil would
[1:39:58] bruise its heel would Bruce is healed
[1:40:00] and the Bible says in in Luke the 10th
[1:40:02] chapter that I beheld Satan thought I'm
[1:40:05] going somewhere I beheld Satan Paul from
[1:40:07] heaven like lightning amen you know what
[1:40:09] that word fall means that word Paul
[1:40:11] means come to its end so in other words
[1:40:13] Jesus said I saw Satan fall from Heaven
[1:40:17] and I saw him come to his end and the
[1:40:20] very next verse the very next verse he
[1:40:23] connects the devil's end to your foot
[1:40:28] leave me on the very next verse he
[1:40:31] connects the devil's hand to your foot
[1:40:33] and he says I saw Satan and I saw Satan
[1:40:37] fall from Heaven like lightning but the
[1:40:40] whole I give you power what is that
[1:40:43] power to do it's the tread on serpents
[1:40:46] and upon scorpions now you want to go a
[1:40:49] little bit further let's go that word
[1:40:50] tread means to crush that word tread
[1:40:53] means to stomp on the devil's head and
[1:40:56] when Jesus Christ defeated Satan that
[1:40:58] day at Calvary he released the power in
[1:41:01] your body to go to your foot and put
[1:41:04] your foot on the devil's head
[1:41:07] now I know what somebody's saying right
[1:41:09] now you're saying well brother Andrew
[1:41:10] brother Brian said we don't stomp it
[1:41:12] that loud and you're exactly right he
[1:41:14] did say that but he also said 31 times
[1:41:17] that Jesus Christ the son of God is in
[1:41:20] this building and he says you got
[1:41:22] arthritis he said but Jesus Christ heals
[1:41:25] you about arthritis he said now go stomp
[1:41:28] on that Devil's Head
[1:41:30] I put him over in Oklahoma amen devil
[1:41:33] stomping amen don't defeat a devil but
[1:41:35] it sure gets you defeated one on their
[1:41:37] move a lot quicker
[1:41:41] brother Tim I don't stomp on the devil
[1:41:44] to defeat him but when he is defeated
[1:41:47] y'all know what I'm telling y'all
[1:41:49] brother Mark when he is defeated I'm
[1:41:52] gonna Rap by the words to put my foot on
[1:41:55] the ground and let that devil know he's
[1:41:58] defeated and Jesus Christ the son of God
[1:42:01] Reigns in Victory
[1:42:04] Jesus Reigns in Victory He reigns over
[1:42:07] depression He reigns over suicide He
[1:42:10] reigns over nervousness He reigns over
[1:42:12] false Doctrine He reigns over up and
[1:42:14] down services
[1:42:15] [Applause]
[1:42:19] [Music]
[1:42:22] but Timothy you got your you got you a
[1:42:24] stray animal around your property and
[1:42:26] you won't get rid of that thing take
[1:42:27] your shotgun put a little bit of lead in
[1:42:30] it that thing might stand there and bark
[1:42:31] at you but he's already defeated
[1:42:34] the LED's already hit him so while he's
[1:42:37] standing there barking you know what you
[1:42:38] do you say get out of here get out of
[1:42:42] here well Jesus Christ that day at
[1:42:44] Calvary put some land in that big old
[1:42:46] devil call Lucifer and he's straying
[1:42:48] around here right now and he's staring
[1:42:50] somebody do something about it but I say
[1:42:53] tonight Church put your foot on the
[1:42:55] ground

[1:43:16] you know what we need to do we need to
[1:43:17] bring some good old-fashioned footstop
[1:43:19] and religion back in the house of God
[1:43:21] ain't nothing wrong brother we're
[1:43:23] standing up and stomping on a defeated
[1:43:25] devil
[1:43:26] I can take it a little bit further if
[1:43:28] that's okay I found out God don't just
[1:43:30] tell natural arthritis he also heals
[1:43:32] spiritual arthritis young people that
[1:43:35] heard some of this but I feel it here so
[1:43:36] I'm gonna preach it amen and you know
[1:43:38] what I found brother Tim I found we got
[1:43:40] a lot of spiritual arthritis in the
[1:43:42] church
[1:43:43] you know what spiritual arthritis is
[1:43:44] it's the stiffening and the less
[1:43:46] movement of joints as more AIDS creeps
[1:43:49] on it in other words the more age you
[1:43:52] get the more stiffer you get I found out
[1:43:54] we got some people amen this gun
[1:43:56] arthritis in their hands they can't
[1:43:58] shake hands with certain people no more
[1:44:00] because they got arthritis and they've
[1:44:02] seen too many faults in them and they've
[1:44:04] seen too many mistakes and they've seen
[1:44:05] too many failures so their hand can't
[1:44:07] shake hands with them no more you ain't
[1:44:09] got nothing but spiritual arthritis
[1:44:12] well that feels good in here don't it
[1:44:14] that Devil's on the run you know what
[1:44:16] else I found I found out people got
[1:44:18] spiritual arthritis in their arm they
[1:44:20] can't brothers can't hug their brothers
[1:44:21] no more and sisters can't hug their
[1:44:24] sisters no more because 20 years ago
[1:44:26] somebody done somebody wrong and they're
[1:44:28] still holding and they've let 20 years
[1:44:29] since spiritual arthritis spilled up in
[1:44:31] their hand and in their arms
[1:44:34] then you know what else I found sister
[1:44:35] Elena I found out some people got it in
[1:44:37] their shoulders when the songs are sung
[1:44:39] no more they can't raise their hands no
[1:44:41] more because they got enough Revelation
[1:44:43] through the years and it's too
[1:44:45] Pentecostal to raise their hands well I
[1:44:47] might as well keep on going I found out
[1:44:49] some people got some spiritual arthritis
[1:44:51] in their knees
[1:44:53] they used to stand up when the preacher
[1:44:55] is preaching but now they complain
[1:44:56] because everybody in front of them
[1:44:57] standing up
[1:44:58] you got spiritual arthritis anywhere
[1:45:01] else I found they got it they got it in
[1:45:03] their ankles you know what they can't
[1:45:04] dance no more they can't shout no more
[1:45:06] they got so many years to sit in a Pew
[1:45:09] on them but they can't enjoy the
[1:45:10] blessings of the visitation of the angel
[1:45:13] of God but you know what if I didn't do
[1:45:15] nothing else when I come here but this
[1:45:17] I'm going to do it in the name of Jesus
[1:45:19] Christ spiritual arthritis is defeated
[1:45:22] in the house of God it leaves your hands
[1:45:25] it leaves your shoulders it leaves your
[1:45:28] knees it leaves your foot the moon
[1:45:30] Jackson put your foot on it with me amen
[1:45:32] put your foot on that devil
[1:45:35] that devil is defeated I think it's
[1:45:38] somebody reminding him he's defeated
[1:45:40] [Music]
[1:45:41] remind that Devil he's defeated
[1:45:44] he's underneath you
[1:45:47] but Andrew I don't know I know you know
[1:45:51] how come I know because I recognize the
[1:45:53] visitation of the Angel and the age I'm
[1:45:56] living in
[1:45:57] now I'm just going to say it because I'm
[1:45:59] going to say it or I'm gonna bust
[1:46:02] Ram said like this he said I challenge
[1:46:05] you to Stomp
[1:46:07] on every imaginary devil
[1:46:11] he said stomp on that unreasonable fault
[1:46:14] that is prophetica that brother that is
[1:46:17] prophetic instruction he is instructing
[1:46:19] you to put ever imaginary thought under
[1:46:22] your foot and stomp on it you say
[1:46:24] brother Andrew imaginary thought oh yeah
[1:46:26] I'm picking him up right now by the word
[1:46:28] amen nobody loves me nobody cares for me
[1:46:30] amen I don't fit in the youth group I
[1:46:32] don't fit in the adults brother Tim
[1:46:34] don't have time for me brother Aaron
[1:46:36] ignoring me Timothy ain't call me in two
[1:46:38] weeks Joe don't like me amen that's an
[1:46:40] unreasonable imaginary thought from the
[1:46:43] pits of hell you know what you need to
[1:46:45] do
[1:46:46] put your foot on that devil
[1:46:50] put your foot on that devil I said devil
[1:46:53] trying to get you out of the house of
[1:46:54] God as a devil trying to talk you out of
[1:46:57] the blessings well come on church that's
[1:46:59] a live devil but it's time to put your
[1:47:02] foot on that devil
[1:47:04] come on Aaron show us how it's done put
[1:47:07] your foot on that damn boy come on
[1:47:09] brother Timothy come on brother Tim come
[1:47:11] on brother Joe put your foot on that
[1:47:13] devil J come on in your might as well
[1:47:16] put your foot on that devil and back up
[1:47:18] it's an unreasonable imaginary song from
[1:47:21] the pits of Hell put your foot on it
[1:47:32] I think somebody open them doors and let
[1:47:35] that defeated devil out of the building
[1:47:37] that devil is defeated I think we ought
[1:47:40] to swim the extra time get out of here
[1:47:42] devil we're not a bunch of trophies of
[1:47:44] bitterness we're not a bunch of trophies
[1:47:46] are credulous and unforgiveness we're
[1:47:48] trophies
[1:47:50] of the visitation
[1:47:54] now I can take in the Book of Esther the
[1:47:56] seventh chapter and the Bible says that
[1:47:58] Haman had plans
[1:48:00] I got in there the other day Heyman had
[1:48:02] plans he had plans to spool and to root
[1:48:05] out amen the Jewish people but the Bible
[1:48:08] says that Mordecai and Esther have been
[1:48:11] full of the devil's plans I think I
[1:48:12] preached that here years ago when God
[1:48:14] cancels the devil's plans are you
[1:48:16] hearing me Mordecai and Esther amen
[1:48:19] fooled the devil and they foil his plans
[1:48:22] haman's plans fell right in front of him
[1:48:26] you know what the Bible says the Bible
[1:48:28] says they hung Haman in The Gallows now
[1:48:30] if you get to studying something I found
[1:48:32] this brother tell me about how to run
[1:48:33] and fit you get to study that it was
[1:48:35] called the Feast of Purim which in the
[1:48:38] feast appear him thousands of years ago
[1:48:40] was a lot more pure than it is today it
[1:48:43] was actually a worship you look at Purim
[1:48:45] today and it's just a big it I probably
[1:48:47] says compared to your Mardi Gras it's
[1:48:48] just a big old a big old conglomeration
[1:48:50] of everything but back then they had a
[1:48:53] day of feast a feast of Freedom they had
[1:48:56] a day of Joy a day of Celebration and
[1:48:58] you know what it was to do it was to
[1:49:00] remind one person he was defeated and
[1:49:02] his name was Haman
[1:49:05] you know what if I did how I'm about to
[1:49:08] punch a devil square in the face you
[1:49:09] know what they did every time haman's
[1:49:12] name was mentioned they made noise
[1:49:15] you know why they make noise because the
[1:49:18] more noise the louder it be and the less
[1:49:21] echo of haman's name would go through
[1:49:23] the feast but I found something Brother
[1:49:25] Jay because the people they wanted there
[1:49:27] the most you know who they wanted there
[1:49:28] the most was the kids
[1:49:31] they invited the kids the most you know
[1:49:34] why because they was good at making
[1:49:36] noise
[1:49:36] [Applause]
[1:49:39] well give me some preaching room right
[1:49:40] here
[1:49:42] I know we got a bunch of people let's
[1:49:44] get a little bit aggravated our kids
[1:49:46] making noise amen but I might as well go
[1:49:48] ahead and say it Jesus Christ invited
[1:49:50] them to be at this Feast because their
[1:49:53] enemy Haven is dead and we're going to
[1:49:56] make so much noise with this message and
[1:49:58] with the promises of God and with the
[1:50:01] Praises under Jehovah
[1:50:07] well glory to God come on musicians I'm
[1:50:09] done amen but you know the next thing
[1:50:11] they done was they took the name Haman
[1:50:13] and they wrote the name Haman on their
[1:50:15] foot and every time they heard the
[1:50:18] famous mention of the name Haman they
[1:50:21] just stopped
[1:50:22] they just stumbled you know what they
[1:50:24] could be standing there talking to you
[1:50:26] and you're just having a conversation
[1:50:27] and out of nowhere brother Tim just kind
[1:50:29] of stomped their foot and then they say
[1:50:31] well I didn't hear it it didn't matter
[1:50:32] if you heard or not I heard it and that
[1:50:34] Devil's lost his power over my life
[1:50:39] this ain't a universal praise this ain't
[1:50:42] everybody in the church place and you
[1:50:44] can be here on a Wednesday night and
[1:50:46] brother Tim and brother Timothy are one
[1:50:48] of these men of God be preaching and
[1:50:49] everybody's sitting around you sleeping
[1:50:51] and you can just stand up and start
[1:50:53] stomping your foot because you've heard
[1:50:55] the word of the lord your enemy is dead
[1:50:59] Haman is dead
[1:51:09] you think I shout now
[1:51:12] You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet
[1:51:13] you think I dance now you ain't seen
[1:51:16] nothing yet you know why because when I
[1:51:19] leave this earth by the way of the
[1:51:20] Resurrection or by the way of a Rapture
[1:51:22] I'm not leaving my dance here
[1:51:25] I'm taking it with me because I got over
[1:51:28] there reading the other day brother Jude
[1:51:29] in the Book of Revelation the 20th
[1:51:30] chapter and the Bible says the devil was
[1:51:32] cast down and a lit was put over that
[1:51:35] devil and he was spent with a chain of
[1:51:37] circumstance and you know what I did
[1:51:38] brother Timothy right there I made an
[1:51:40] appointment with the devil I said you
[1:51:42] think I danced you ain't seen nothing
[1:51:44] yet you just wait till Jesus Christ lets
[1:51:47] me get a spot on that lid that old
[1:51:49] Devil's underneath it you think I'm on a
[1:51:51] dance step here
[1:51:55] I'm going to shout and I'm going to
[1:51:58] Rejoice because my enemy is locked up
[1:52:01] and I'm free
[1:52:05] I'm free in the presence of God I
[1:52:08] recognize my day I recognize this
[1:52:11] message I recognize the angel I
[1:52:14] recognize the anointing I recognize the
[1:52:16] absolute I recognize the voice of the
[1:52:19] seventh angel and by the word and the
[1:52:22] presence of Jesus Christ
[1:52:23] [Applause]
[1:52:32] Lord
[1:52:35] the devil's back in his place
[1:52:39] he's under your foot now
[1:52:43] I said to you like this
[1:52:45] you're a trophy Stompers
[1:52:48] you're stomping trophies
[1:52:51] because everything the devil's tried to
[1:52:53] use over you
[1:52:56] you're stomping
[1:52:57] over him
[1:52:58] [Applause]
[1:52:59] [Music]
[1:53:01] now somebody asked me one time they said
[1:53:03] Belinda how in the world are you going
[1:53:05] to place these trophies I don't have
[1:53:07] time to read it to you but I do have
[1:53:08] time to preach it to you real quick

[1:53:29] babied and given a position to be a part
[1:53:30] of the church

[2:06:34] Heavenly Father
[2:06:36] Lord into thy hands we commend our
[2:06:37] Spirits Lord
[2:06:39] father these are not my people these are
[2:06:41] your trophies Lord
[2:06:44] I could go through this building Lord I
[2:06:46] could begin to speak about different
[2:06:47] Believers around the world tonight Lord
[2:06:51] and Lord I know how sometimes Satan
[2:06:53] works
[2:06:54] he wants us to get our minds on
[2:06:56] just the individual
[2:06:58] but lord it's not the individual
[2:07:01] it's the trophy story
[2:07:03] it's the trophy scars
[2:07:06] Lord as I said studying the other day
[2:07:07] and Spirit just come by my heart
[2:07:10] Lord I got to thinking about how that we
[2:07:13] live in a generation where the kids can
[2:07:15] be a part of a sports team or something
[2:07:17] and they may never get off the bench one
[2:07:19] time to play one one play they may never
[2:07:22] they may never dirty their uniform one
[2:07:25] time
[2:07:26] but at the end of the season they all
[2:07:27] get a trophy
[2:07:29] because it's called participation
[2:07:30] trophies
[2:07:32] so Lord they got a participation trophy
[2:07:34] just cause they showed up
[2:07:36] the man never broke a sweat
[2:07:38] the man never done one thing put forth
[2:07:40] one ounce of effort but they got a
[2:07:42] trophy just cause they showed up
[2:07:45] the Lord I got to thinking about this
[2:07:46] bride
[2:07:49] he's not a participation trophy
[2:07:52] she's broke the sweat Lord
[2:07:55] she's drawn her sword
[2:07:57] she's fighting against two hundred
[2:07:58] thousand thousand devils
[2:08:01] standing for you Lord
[2:08:03] she's an overcomer
[2:08:05] and Lord if there be one here tonight
[2:08:08] it's the devil's intimidating him give
[2:08:10] up quit going quit pressing quit pecking
[2:08:13] against that shell quit peeping your way
[2:08:15] out of there
[2:08:16] Satan I bind you in the name of Jesus
[2:08:19] Christ
[2:08:20] take your leave from the Believers of
[2:08:22] Jesus Christ
[2:08:23] the Sons and Daughters of God take your
[2:08:26] leave Satan
