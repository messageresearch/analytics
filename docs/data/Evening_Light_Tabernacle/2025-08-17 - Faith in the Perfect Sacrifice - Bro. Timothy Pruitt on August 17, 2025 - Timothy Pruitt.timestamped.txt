[16:47] I'd rather
[16:50] have Jesus
[16:53] than silver
[16:56] or gold.
[16:58] I'd rather
[17:01] be his
[17:03] than to have riches
[17:06] untold.
[17:09] I'd rather
[17:12] have Jesus
[17:15] than houses
[17:17] or land.
[17:21] How many would rather be led?
[17:24] Oh, by his name
[17:28] her stand
[17:31] to be
[17:34] a king
[17:36] of a master
[17:41] and beheld
[17:44] in sin
[17:46] dread sway.
[17:48] [Music]
[17:52] I'd rather
[17:55] Jesus
[17:57] than
[18:02] this world
[18:05] of
[18:07] to me.
[18:11] Well, I'd rather
[18:15] have Jesus
[18:17] than men's
[18:20] applause.
[18:22] I'd rather
[18:25] be faithful
[18:27] to his
[18:29] dear call.
[18:32] I'd rather
[18:35] have Jesus
[18:37] than worldwide
[18:40] fame.
[18:42] I'd rather
[18:45] be true
[18:47] to his holy
[18:50] name
[18:52] that you
[18:55] the king
[18:57] of the past
[19:00] made
[19:02] and to be held
[19:05] in sins.
[19:07] Oh, who is he made free this morning?
[19:11] Oh,
[19:12] I'd rather
[19:15] have Jesus more than anything
[19:20] [Music]
[19:22] this world
[19:25] affords
[19:26] [Music]
[19:27] to take.
[19:31] Well, I'd rather
[19:34] have Jesus
[19:37] than a vast
[19:39] domain.
[19:42] I'd rather
[19:50] Let's start that verse over again. Then
[19:53] men's applause. I'd rather
[19:56] have Jesus
[19:59] than men's
[20:01] of walls.
[20:04] I'd rather
[20:06] be faithful
[20:09] to his
[20:11] dear cause.
[20:14] I'd rather
[20:16] have Jesus
[20:19] than worldwide
[20:21] fame.
[20:24] I'd rather
[20:26] be true
[20:28] to his holy
[20:31] name
[20:33] than to be
[20:36] a car
[20:38] of a vast
[20:40] [Music]
[20:43] and be held
[20:46] in sins
[20:48] and sway.
[20:51] [Music]
[20:53] I'd rather
[20:56] have Jesus
[20:58] than anything
[21:03] this world
[21:05] affords
[21:08] today. He's fairer
[21:12] for He's fairer
[21:15] than the liies.
[21:18] of the rarest
[21:20] bloom.
[21:23] He's sweeter
[21:25] than honey
[21:27] from out of the cold.
[21:32] For he's all
[21:34] that my hungering
[21:38] spirit
[21:39] [Music]
[21:40] need.
[21:42] I'd rather I'd rather have Jesus
[21:47] and to live
[21:49] [Music]
[21:50] [Applause]
[21:52] than to be
[21:55] a king
[21:57] of the valley.
[22:02] and to be held
[22:05] in sad
[22:07] sway.
[22:09] [Music]
[22:12] I'd rather
[22:15] have Jesus
[22:17] than
[22:22] this world
[22:24] affords
[22:27] today.
[22:31] As the musicians play that chorus one
[22:33] more time,
[22:37] how many's been held in sin's
[22:40] dreaded sway?
[22:45] You could write the love of God. Your
[22:48] own story writes the love of God.
[22:52] It's grace.
[22:54] How many's been freed?
[22:56] Freed from that grip.
[22:59] [Music]
[23:00] you couldn't break yourself free from.
[23:03] But he did it. That's why we sing.
[23:12] [Music]
[23:14] Oh, then to be
[23:17] a king
[23:20] of a vast
[23:22] o
[23:24] and be held
[23:27] in sins
[23:30] dread sway.
[23:34] For I'd rather
[23:37] have Jesus
[23:40] than
[23:42] anything
[23:45] this world
[23:47] affords
[23:50] today.
[23:54] Or you could lock
[23:56] me up
[23:59] in a prison
[24:04] and you could throw
[24:07] away
[24:08] [Music]
[24:10] the key.
[24:14] You could take
[24:17] away
[24:20] my vision.
[24:24] from these eyes
[24:27] that now that now can see
[24:35] deprive
[24:37] me of
[24:40] the food
[24:42] I eat. Oh, you can divide
[24:47] mine.
[24:51] find my hands, my feet. Oh, but as long
[24:56] as I
[24:59] I know Jesus,
[25:05] he said I could still
[25:09] go free.
[25:13] He said that I
[25:16] I could still
[25:19] go free.
[25:21] [Music]
[25:23] And tell me what kind
[25:26] of a man.
[25:29] [Music]
[25:32] Oh,
[25:34] and do this for me.
[25:44] So
[25:46] unworthy
[25:48] to live.
[25:50] I was not faith
[25:53] to give. Oh, but the man on the cross
[26:00] had my name.
[26:03] Hallelujah. He said that I
[26:08] was still
[26:10] free.
[26:12] [Music]
[26:14] Now I never
[26:18] could.
[26:20] I don't
[26:22] understand
[26:24] why a king
[26:27] would leave
[26:29] his throne.
[26:31] [Music]
[26:34] Take on
[26:36] the road
[26:39] of a
[26:40] [Music]
[26:42] man.
[26:43] Feel the pain
[26:46] of flesh. Oh flesh and bone.
[26:53] [Music]
[26:57] Hold down this earthly sorrow.
[27:02] Oh land
[27:05] tonight.
[27:07] [Applause]
[27:12] But those blood those blood red stains.
[27:17] They broke all
[27:20] my chains
[27:22] that I
[27:24] could stand.
[27:27] [Music]
[27:31] He said, "Can I
[27:35] put your name there this morning?"
[27:38] Oh, tell me what kind.
[27:44] It's a God man who reached down
[27:48] his hand
[27:51] and do this for me.
[28:01] So
[28:03] worthy
[28:05] to live.
[28:11] Oh, but the man of the cross
[28:17] had my name in his will. And he said
[28:22] that I
[28:24] would still
[28:26] go free.
[28:29] Oh, he said that I
[28:34] still
[28:36] go free.
[28:38] [Applause]
[28:40] Tell me what kind
[28:43] of man
[28:46] could reach down
[28:48] his hand.
[28:49] [Music]
[29:00] So
[29:02] unworthy.
[29:06] I was not fit
[29:09] to kill.
[29:11] But the man on the cross
[29:20] and he said that I
[29:23] could still
[29:25] go free.
[29:29] Hallelujah.
[29:32] Hallelujah.
[29:33] How we thank you Lord.
[29:37] Yes Lord. Still free this morning to
[29:39] worship in spirit and in truth.
[29:43] Hallelujah.
[29:45] Hallelujah.
[29:47] Amen.
[29:51] Amen. Perspective has a lot to do with
[29:54] life. You know from a perspective of
[29:58] bondage, freedom looks foreign.
[30:01] But from a perspective of freedom, it's
[30:04] awesome. And when you're free and you're
[30:08] living in that perspective, it changes
[30:10] everything. Amen. God bless you this
[30:12] morning. We're going to go to prayer
[30:14] this morning as brother Aaron Ogles be
[30:16] if he'd mind opening the service for us.
[30:18] We do want to remember several prayer
[30:20] requests.

[30:25] Want to remember Sister Crystal Kutshaw
[30:28] and Naa. They're both very sick. been
[30:30] down with the flu-l like symptoms last
[30:33] couple of days and just needing a real
[30:34] touch. Want to remember brother Tom
[30:36] Herring as he's out sick this morning.

[30:43] very sick as well.
[30:46] And
[30:48] Sister Laura Burns's dad, Brother Bruce.
[30:51] We do want to remember him. He's not
[30:52] feeling well either. So just want to
[30:55] remember those that need a touch in
[30:57] their body. And how many would say,
[30:58] "Lord,
[30:59] pass me not. Oh gentle Savior, hear the
[31:02] cry of my heart. Lord, maybe it's for a
[31:04] loved one and whatever the need is,
[31:07] would you hold it before the Lord as we
[31:09] pray this morning?"
[31:12] Amen. Let's pray together.
[31:15] Heavenly Father, Lord, we just want to
[31:17] say this morning how much we love you,

[31:41] never lost its power Lord that

[31:50] but today there's freedom in the house
[31:52] of God Lord you're just looking for
[31:54] somebody to accept that freedom. Lord,
[31:56] we come to recognize, Lord, that the
[31:58] only way we stay bound is if it's that's
[32:00] the desire of our heart. Because if we
[32:02] desire freedom, there's freedom here
[32:04] today for us. Lord, I just pray that
[32:06] each and every one that's battled
[32:08] shackles and battled mind battles,

[32:52] your will is healing and deliverance,
[32:54] Lord. Lord, I pray Lord today that every
[32:56] lukewarm spirit, everything that would
[32:58] try to hinder this service right now
[33:00] will just bow to the name of Jesus. That
[33:03] you can just come in and begin to move
[33:04] in the lives of men and women. Lord, may
[33:07] you rekindle fires that have dwindled
[33:09] low. May you spark lives that have been
[33:11] struggling. May you move us past the
[33:13] things we like and don't like. And Lord,
[33:15] bring a refocus on why we are gathered
[33:18] here. And we are here for one purpose,
[33:20] and that's to hear from heaven. We're

[41:18] King of Kings.
[41:21] You are my everything
[41:24] and I will adore you.
[41:38] [Music]
[41:43] I'm not on
[41:46] an ego trip.
[41:49] I'm nothing
[41:52] on my own.
[41:56] I've made mistakes
[42:00] and often slipped. I'm just calling
[42:05] flesh and bone.
[42:10] But I'll prove someday
[42:14] just what I say.
[42:18] I'm of a special kind.
[42:24] For while he was on the cross,
[42:32] I was on his mind.
[42:37] [Music]
[42:41] The look of love
[42:45] was on his face
[42:48] with thorns
[42:50] on his head.
[42:54] Wood was on
[42:57] that scarlet robe and it was stained
[43:02] crimson
[43:04] red.
[43:07] Though his eyes were on the crowd that
[43:12] day,
[43:14] he looked ahead
[43:17] in time.
[43:20] For while he was on
[43:24] the cross,
[43:27] you were on his mind.
[43:35] Yet he knew me.
[43:42] Yet he loved
[43:45] me.
[43:50] He whose glory
[43:54] makes
[43:56] the heaven shine.
[44:01] And I'm so unworthy
[44:09] of such mercy.
[44:12] [Music]
[44:16] For while he was on the cross,
[44:23] I was on his mind.
[44:29] For while he was on the cross,
[44:36] you were on
[44:39] his mind.
[44:41] [Music]
[44:44] And so I'll cherish
[44:49] the old rugy
[44:52] cross
[44:56] until my troll
[45:00] fees at last time lay down
[45:05] [Music]
[45:07] and I will cling
[45:10] to the old rocky
[45:14] wrong
[45:15] [Music]
[45:18] and exchange
[45:20] it someday
[45:22] for a crown
[45:28] and exchange
[45:31] it someday
[45:33] for her crown.
[45:40] [Applause]
[45:51] [Music]

[53:42] What a wonderful savior we have today.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; Let's just go to him in prayer. Father
[53:48] we come to you today, Lord. Just so
[53:50] thankful, Lord, that we can serve you
[53:53] and live for you in this day. Lord,
[53:56] we've heard the call in our lives, Lord.
[53:58] And we've responded to that call.
[54:01] Lord, what a blessed people we are
[54:03] today, Father. We just ask, God, you'd
[54:06] come and make yourself known among us
[54:09] today by your presence.
[54:11] Your love and mercy, Lord, just come and
[54:14] surround us.
[54:16] Your glory just overshadow us today.
[54:18] Father, you know every heart. You know
[54:21] every desire, every need. Lord, we just
[54:23] ask God you minister to these needs and
[54:26] these situations.
[54:28] Lord, encourage the discouraged. Lord,
[54:31] Lord, lift up those that are cast down.
[54:34] Father, heal those that are broken. We
[54:37] pray.
[54:39] We ask these things for your glory and
[54:42] for your honor in Jesus name.
[54:46] Amen.
[54:48] Amen. God so good to us.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you today. It's good to
[54:53] be in the house of the Lord and
[54:55] &gt;&gt; just here to worship him in spirit and
[54:57] truth.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. God's so good to us.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; Has he been good to you?
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can turn your in Bibles to
[55:06] Leviticus chapter 22 and also Hebrews
[55:09] chapter 10. Amen. We have uh Sister
[55:13] Hannah Weaten that's with us today.
[55:15] She's been gone for through the summer
[55:18] and maybe we just ought to do like
[55:20] brother Joe says, give her a hand clap
[55:21] of praise for being back.
[55:25] [Laughter]
[55:26] [Applause]
[55:28] Amen. I thought she done moved away
[55:30] there for a moment, but we're glad to
[55:31] have her back. So glad to have every one
[55:34] of you here today and most of all we're
[55:36] glad to have him our most welcome guest
[55:39] here our Lord Jesus Christ to come and
[55:42] and to reveal himself and to be with us
[55:44] today. Amen. Leviticus 22 and verse 17
[55:49] says, "And the Lord spake unto Moses,
[55:51] saying, speak unto Aaron and to his
[55:54] sons, and to all the children of Israel,
[55:56] and say unto them, whatsoever he be of
[55:59] the house of Israel, or the strangers of
[56:01] is in Israel, that will offer his
[56:03] oblation for all his vows, and for all
[56:06] his free will offerings, which they will
[56:08] offer unto the Lord for a burnt
[56:10] offering. You shall offer at your own
[56:12] will a male without blemish of the bees
[56:16] or the sheep or the goats. But
[56:18] whatsoever hath blemish, thou shalt ye
[56:21] not thou shalt ye not offer, for it
[56:24] shall not be acceptable for you. But
[56:27] whosoever offerth a sacrifice of peace
[56:30] offerings unto the Lord to accomplish
[56:33] his vow or free will offering in the
[56:35] bees of the sheep, it shall be perfect
[56:38] to be accepted. and there shall be no
[56:42] blemish therein. Also, Hebrews chapter
[56:46] 10 in verse one
[56:49] says, "For the law having a shadow of
[56:51] good things to come, and not the very
[56:54] image of the things, can never with
[56:56] those sacrifices which they offered
[56:59] yearby year continually make the comers
[57:02] there unto perfect. For then would they
[57:05] not have ceased to be offered, because
[57:08] that the worshippers once purged should
[57:10] have no more conscience of sins. But in
[57:13] those si sacrifice, there is a
[57:15] remembrance again made of sins every
[57:18] year. For it is not possible that the
[57:21] blood of bulls and goats should take
[57:22] away sins. Wherefore when you come, he
[57:26] cometh into the world, he saith,
[57:27] sacrifice, and offerings thou wouldest
[57:30] not, but a body hast thou prepared me,
[57:33] and burnt offerings and sacrifices for
[57:36] sins, thou hast no pleasure. Then said
[57:38] I, lo, I come in the volume of the book,
[57:41] it is written of me to do thy will, oh
[57:43] God. Above when he said, "Sacrifice and
[57:46] offering, and burnt offerings, and
[57:48] offerings for sins, thy wouldest not,
[57:50] neither hast pleasure therein, which are
[57:52] offered by the law." Then said he, "Lo,
[57:55] I come to do thy will, oh God. He taketh
[57:57] away the first, that he may establish
[58:00] the second." By that, by the will we
[58:04] will we are sac sanctified through the
[58:07] offering of the body of Jesus Christ
[58:09] once for all. And every priest standing
[58:13] daily ministering offering oftentimes
[58:15] the same sacrifices which can never take
[58:18] away sin. But this man at after he had
[58:22] offered one sacrifice for sin forever
[58:24] sat down on the right hand of God from
[58:26] henceforth expecting till his enemies be
[58:29] made his foottool. For by one offering
[58:32] he hath perfected forever them that are
[58:35] sanctified. Whereof the Holy Ghost also
[58:37] is a witness to us. For after that he
[58:39] had said before, "This is the covenant
[58:42] that I will make with them after those
[58:44] days, sayaeth the Lord. I will put my
[58:46] law in their hearts, and in their mind
[58:48] will I write them, and their sins and
[58:51] iniquities will I remember no more. Now
[58:55] where remission of this is, there is no
[58:59] more offering for sin." Amen. God bless.
[59:02] You can be seated today. just like to
[59:06] speak to you on faith in the perfect
[59:08] sacrifice
[59:11] because I I believe we have a perfect
[59:13] sacrifice today.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; As we read in the scriptures, you know,
[59:17] they they tried as man could do as far
[59:19] as providing a lamb or a beef or or a
[59:23] sheep or a or a goat. They would try
[59:26] their best to make sure that it was uh
[59:29] perfect and without blemish and and
[59:32] otherwise God would not accept it. So
[59:34] they would bring the most perfect lamb
[59:36] and the priests would look it over and
[59:38] examine it and and bring it bring it and
[59:41] go through all the different things to
[59:43] make sure that was perfect. But then
[59:44] they would lay it upon the altar. And
[59:46] yes, it was perfect in the outside of
[59:48] its appearing appearance. It maybe
[59:51] didn't have a blemish or spot on it, but
[59:53] it had a blood that could not come back
[59:56] upon the worshipper. And so they would
[59:58] offer these sacrifices time after time
[1:00:01] after time. And all of this did was it
[1:00:03] would cover the sin because as we read,
[1:00:06] amen, as Paul would begin to bring it
[1:00:08] out, he said this would only cover
[1:00:10] because there was always a remembrance
[1:00:12] of this sin that would once a year come
[1:00:14] again. And so, amen, God, this this was
[1:00:17] just a shadow of things to come. You
[1:00:19] know, as shadows are, you can you can
[1:00:21] see that it's maybe representing my hand
[1:00:23] or representing my body, but you can't
[1:00:26] see the very details of a of it in a
[1:00:28] shadow. But when the when that shadow
[1:00:30] becomes reality, then you can see what
[1:00:33] God's real intention was. And God's
[1:00:35] intention was that there be made a
[1:00:37] sacrifice that would would answer the
[1:00:40] sin question forever. Amen. It wouldn't
[1:00:42] be after one service after another
[1:00:45] service or one one camp meeting after
[1:00:47] another camp meeting or one year after
[1:00:49] another year, but it would absolutely
[1:00:52] answer the sin question forever because,
[1:00:55] you know, he he he was looking for not
[1:00:57] just a perfect sacrifice, but also a
[1:01:00] perfect people made perfect by a perfect
[1:01:03] sacrifice. And so, he had to bring a
[1:01:06] sacrifice that would pay the punishment
[1:01:08] and would pay the price. And and you
[1:01:10] know we we we can read in Matthew 5 and
[1:01:12] verse 48 he said he said be ye therefore
[1:01:15] perfect even as your father which is in
[1:01:18] heaven is perfect. Now that in itself
[1:01:21] seems impossible to do. There's no way
[1:01:24] that we could ever be perfect as God is
[1:01:26] perfect. We we can't attain that on our
[1:01:29] own. So in order for him to say that he
[1:01:31] had to make a way for us to reach that
[1:01:34] perfection. Now we know our salvation,
[1:01:36] your salvation, my salvation, it does
[1:01:39] not hinge upon the merits of our own
[1:01:42] acts. You know, it hinges upon the p
[1:01:44] positive sovereign grace of almighty
[1:01:47] God. And he has chosen us in him. So,
[1:01:50] amen. That I therefore I maybe I could
[1:01:53] never be perfect and neither could you
[1:01:55] ever be perfect. We don't claim to be
[1:01:57] perfect, but we have this one
[1:01:59] consolation that our faith rests in a
[1:02:02] perfect sacrifice. Amen. that's already
[1:02:05] been received. And therefore, amen, as
[1:02:07] it was, that that sacrifice then was
[1:02:09] accepted. Then the believer was also
[1:02:12] accepted. And so it comes to our day
[1:02:14] that our lamb was also looked over. He
[1:02:17] was tried in every way. He was he was
[1:02:19] looked over by the eyes of God. And he
[1:02:22] was found to be perfect. He was found to
[1:02:24] be a perfect lamb. But the difference
[1:02:26] between this lamb, it ca he came not as
[1:02:29] a goat. He didn't come as a a sheep or
[1:02:31] he didn't come but he came on the same
[1:02:33] level at the same bloodline as we came
[1:02:36] upon. And so that blood can now be
[1:02:39] transferred over to us. Now we cannot go
[1:02:42] and have a have a trans blood
[1:02:44] transfusion from a goat or or or from a
[1:02:47] lamb or from a any other kind of
[1:02:49] creature. You know when we go get a
[1:02:51] blood transfusion is to come from human
[1:02:53] blood. And so, amen, this blood to be
[1:02:56] transfused or to be moved over into our
[1:02:59] lives, it had to come the same way. So,
[1:03:02] God created himself a blood cell. Now, I
[1:03:04] remember as a young man having a
[1:03:06] conversation with a guy, he had me a
[1:03:08] little bit confused because he asked me,
[1:03:10] you know, was Jesus Jew or was he
[1:03:12] gentile? And he goes through all of his
[1:03:14] thoughts and and you know, but I I found
[1:03:16] the answer to that when I begin to study
[1:03:17] the message that he was neither Jew nor
[1:03:20] Gentile. It wasn't that, you know, E
[1:03:22] provided the egg or or this or that, but
[1:03:25] God provided everything that it took to
[1:03:28] make himself a body. And God created the
[1:03:30] egg. He produced the the sperm that
[1:03:33] would f that would bring it to to life.
[1:03:36] He put it all together and he just
[1:03:38] placed it inside of an incubator. Amen.
[1:03:41] He placed it inside of a womb. I I found
[1:03:43] that that was possible in cattle, you
[1:03:46] know, they do it all the time. And they
[1:03:47] take an old scrub cow and they but they
[1:03:49] take an egg from a champion cow and a
[1:03:52] champion bull and they put them together
[1:03:54] and they can put them in any old scrub
[1:03:55] cow. Now when that calf is born it has
[1:03:58] no DNA whatsoever of the incubator or
[1:04:01] the carrier of its life. Amen. It comes
[1:04:04] out. It comes from who it came from. Its
[1:04:07] father and mother. Amen. And the life
[1:04:09] and the seed and all of that working
[1:04:11] together. It does not pick up one little
[1:04:14] bit of what's what's been played. what
[1:04:16] the life that has been placed on the
[1:04:18] inside. Amen. That's what he did. He
[1:04:20] made himself a blood cell. He made
[1:04:22] himself a body and he placed it there
[1:04:25] inside of an incubator. He didn't He He
[1:04:27] knew that it could not be human blood to
[1:04:30] redeem human blood. He knew that it
[1:04:33] could not be human DNA. Amen. To redeem
[1:04:36] human DNA because he knows he knew that
[1:04:38] as we do when we're born, we pick up
[1:04:41] certain genes from our mother. We pick
[1:04:43] up certain genes from our father. Amen.
[1:04:45] He didn't need genes from Joseph or this
[1:04:47] one or family traits here or family
[1:04:49] traits there. So he created himself a
[1:04:52] perfect blood cell and he placed it
[1:04:54] inside of a body that when that blood
[1:04:57] was shed at Calvary that blood paid our
[1:05:00] price. That blood paid our penalty and
[1:05:03] now we can be perfect if we accept the
[1:05:06] life of that blood. Amen. That's what it
[1:05:08] takes. The life of that blood coming
[1:05:10] upon us. And so we see here, amen, when
[1:05:14] the worshipper in the Old Testament,
[1:05:16] they had put their hands and and by
[1:05:18] faith upon the body of of that lamb,
[1:05:21] just as we do also by faith, we put our
[1:05:25] hands on the body of the Lord Jesus
[1:05:27] Christ. And we feel the terror of sin
[1:05:30] and the mock of the spit on his face.
[1:05:32] And we feel the groanings of Gethsemane
[1:05:35] and and the agonies of Calvary. And we
[1:05:38] know we're everyone guilty.
[1:05:41] Every one of us is guilty. Amen. Every
[1:05:44] one of us has come was born in sin and
[1:05:47] shaped in iniquity. Amen. We come into
[1:05:49] this world speaking lies. Amen. But see,
[1:05:51] when we felt that pull upon our life and
[1:05:54] we come to the Lord and we accepted our
[1:05:57] sacrifice and the blood came on us,
[1:06:00] Amen. then not just the blood over us
[1:06:02] and in us, but the life of that blood
[1:06:04] coming inside of us, then we can be made
[1:06:07] perfect as he was perfect. Amen. This is
[1:06:10] what he says in John 17 and verse 23. I
[1:06:14] in them and thou in me that they may be
[1:06:18] made perfect in one. That they may be
[1:06:21] made perfect in one. So you have to come
[1:06:24] into Christ to be made perfect. You
[1:06:27] cannot come into a church and be made
[1:06:29] perfect. You cannot be depend on being
[1:06:31] born in a certain family to be made
[1:06:33] perfect. Amen. You cannot be dependent
[1:06:36] on you know s seven generations of this
[1:06:38] or that and the other or or three
[1:06:40] generations of message believer. That's
[1:06:42] not what makes us perfect. What makes us
[1:06:44] perfect is accepting the blood that was
[1:06:47] shed for us but not just accepting the
[1:06:50] sacrifice but allowing that life to come
[1:06:53] on the inside of us and purge us from
[1:06:55] our sins.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is where he was there on
[1:06:59] Calvary. He says, "Then then the life
[1:07:01] that came from Calvary, which is the
[1:07:03] spirit of God, which is called the Holy
[1:07:05] Ghost, Amen, which was hid in the blood
[1:07:07] cell of the Lord Jesus, it returns to
[1:07:10] the worshipper and it baptizes and fills
[1:07:13] him with the Holy Ghost into the body of
[1:07:15] Christ. Then you are already judged."
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; Then you're already judged. You don't
[1:07:22] have to worry about judgment anymore cuz
[1:07:25] he took your judgment. He took your
[1:07:28] pain. He took your sorrow. He took your
[1:07:31] grief. Amen. So we don't have to worry
[1:07:34] about that no more.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; He said when I turn and I, brother said,
[1:07:38] I turn and I look maybe at a little
[1:07:39] crucifix, I realize that represents
[1:07:42] something. That represents the time he
[1:07:44] hung there on the cross in his body. And
[1:07:46] that body has already been judged.
[1:07:49] Therefore, God cannot justly judge it
[1:07:52] again. It's already judged. Uh God
[1:07:54] struck the judgment of death upon that
[1:07:58] body. And as long as I can find a way to
[1:08:02] get into that body.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Come on now. It's judgment struck. Amen.
[1:08:08] That body for you and me. Therefore,
[1:08:11] we're free. That Romans 8:1 says there
[1:08:14] now no condemnation to them that are in
[1:08:17] Christ Jesus. Amen. In the body of
[1:08:20] Christ. How can I be bought? How can I
[1:08:22] come into this body of Christ? Amen. Is
[1:08:24] it because I believe a certain thing? Is
[1:08:26] it because I was raised in a certain
[1:08:28] church? It was it because I was born in
[1:08:30] a certain family? Yes and no. Amen. Not
[1:08:33] the family here upon this earth, but be
[1:08:35] born into the family of God by the power
[1:08:38] of the new birth, the blood of Jesus
[1:08:40] coming into your life.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is what he says. So there's
[1:08:44] no condemnation. I don't care what comes
[1:08:46] and goes. You're hid beneath the blood.
[1:08:48] How many's glad to be beneath the blood?
[1:08:50] Amen.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. 1 Corinthians 12 and:e 13 says
[1:08:54] that by one spirit, how does a spirit
[1:08:57] come? Through the blood. Where did the
[1:08:59] spirit lay within the blood? Why
[1:09:01] couldn't the animal come back? It was an
[1:09:02] animal. The animal spirit cannot come to
[1:09:04] a human spirit. It cannot do anything
[1:09:06] for you. Amen. Because a human spirit is
[1:09:09] higher life than the animal. But no
[1:09:11] other man's spirit can come back. So if
[1:09:14] you got the spirit of some ancestor,
[1:09:16] Amen. that doesn't do you no good. But
[1:09:19] God himself came that his own that his
[1:09:22] own spirit which is the highest line of
[1:09:24] spirit there is can come back by the
[1:09:27] form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost to
[1:09:29] the worshipper through the blood of
[1:09:30] Christ and take you into the body. Then
[1:09:33] you are safe. You're only safe in this
[1:09:37] body. You're only free from judgment in
[1:09:40] this body.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about Evening Light
[1:09:43] Tabernacle. I'm talking about the body
[1:09:46] of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; The bride,
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; the blood of bulls and goats won't work.
[1:09:52] It was too weak.
[1:09:55] Amen. So, but by by one offering, not
[1:09:59] year by year, not revival after revival,
[1:10:02] not meeting after meeting, not day after
[1:10:04] day, but one offering, he has perfected.
[1:10:08] Somebody say perfected. Perfected. Amen.
[1:10:12] By one offering forever.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; Forever. That's the power of his blood.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; It's an everlasting covenant.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; It ain't, you know, go out and do
[1:10:22] something wrong. Amen. Then you've lost.
[1:10:24] No. Or you you make a failure, you make
[1:10:27] a fault and you've lost it. No, it's
[1:10:29] forever.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. By one, by one offering, he is
[1:10:34] perfected forever. He said, "That's the
[1:10:37] answer to the death of Christ. That's
[1:10:38] the answer to Calvary. He absolutely
[1:10:41] with his own blood, he purchased our
[1:10:44] sins. He paid for our sins and he has
[1:10:46] perfected forever his believers.
[1:10:49] Therefore, in Christ, we stand
[1:10:51] blameless.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You stand blameless this
[1:10:56] morning. It doesn't matter what you've
[1:10:58] done. You can have a wrap sheet all the
[1:11:00] way from here to the ceiling that
[1:11:01] Satan's kept up with you on your life.
[1:11:03] But if you've asked for forgiveness,
[1:11:05] it's all forgiveness. You stand
[1:11:07] blameless.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Blameless. Amen. Perfected in the
[1:11:12] presence of God Almighty. Oh my, ain't
[1:11:14] that amazing? Not just perfect in
[1:11:16] somebody else's sight,
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; but perfect in God's sight.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; That's what we need to strive for. You
[1:11:24] know, too many people get caught up in
[1:11:26] being perfect in social media site or
[1:11:28] perfect in have this perfect life or
[1:11:31] this perfect lifestyle or this perfect
[1:11:33] thing. Amen. And we put it out there
[1:11:35] because we want somebody else to think,
[1:11:37] "Wow, he's got a perfect life. He's got
[1:11:39] a perfect way. He's got a perfect body.
[1:11:41] He's got a perfect this." Amen. It ain't
[1:11:43] about being perfect in somebody else's
[1:11:45] sight.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; It's about being perfect in God's sight.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; This is where the devil gets people
[1:11:55] tricked up and tripped up because he got
[1:11:57] our minds and the world's all about
[1:11:59] being perfect in in somebody else's
[1:12:02] sight.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; You know, we got to have perfect hair
[1:12:04] and we got to have perfect lips and we
[1:12:06] got to have per Lord help us got to be
[1:12:08] perfect everything.
[1:12:12] But you stand blameless.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; You stand blameless.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that? Standing blameless
[1:12:22] in God's sight.
[1:12:24] That's that's some rejoicing stuff right
[1:12:26] there.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; When Jesus said, "Be ye therefore
[1:12:31] perfect. It is perfected forever." God
[1:12:34] through the death of Christ 2,000 years
[1:12:37] ago perfected the believer for he for he
[1:12:39] foresaw before the foundation of the
[1:12:41] world forever. Those he called he has
[1:12:43] justified. Those he forneew he called.
[1:12:45] Those he called he justified. Those he
[1:12:47] justified he has also glorified. Or in
[1:12:50] other words he has perfected his
[1:12:52] believers. Amen. But the law having a
[1:12:55] shadow of good things to come. Not the
[1:12:57] very image of those things but a shadow
[1:12:59] of something to come. Amen. So by year
[1:13:02] by year it was trying. that was working.
[1:13:04] They was trying to become perfect. Amen.
[1:13:07] But see, but for then they you said if
[1:13:10] they they could have received that if
[1:13:12] they could have received that
[1:13:13] perfection, they would have ceased from
[1:13:16] offering. But they could not re reach
[1:13:19] that because they would come in with
[1:13:20] that that that desire in their heart
[1:13:23] that that that that that want to do
[1:13:26] wrong and they would offer sacrifice and
[1:13:28] they would go back and they would still
[1:13:30] have that same old desire.
[1:13:35] Because this is what brother Brandham
[1:13:36] deals with. He deals with no more
[1:13:38] conscience for sin. He said actually
[1:13:41] that should that word should be amen
[1:13:43] translated or the real interpretation is
[1:13:45] desire
[1:13:48] because you always as far as you know
[1:13:50] what we think of conscious you should
[1:13:51] always be conscious of sin.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; That sin is sin. That's why being
[1:13:56] conscious of it. Amen. But this is no
[1:13:58] more desire for sin. No more desire
[1:14:01] because Christ has come and taken that
[1:14:04] away by his power of his word and his
[1:14:07] spirit. The Holy Ghost comes into your
[1:14:09] heart. The very sin question is settled
[1:14:12] forever. Every desire for sin has been
[1:14:15] taken away. For the law could have done
[1:14:17] that then sacrifices would have ceased.
[1:14:19] But it could not. So Christ had to come
[1:14:22] and die so we could be made perfect like
[1:14:25] he is perfect.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; But there's so many things about
[1:14:28] perfection. And you know, we're always
[1:14:30] trying, you know, to reach that moment
[1:14:32] and reach that place. But it's only
[1:14:36] God's grace that we are what we are.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; It's only God's grace.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; When I think about God's grace, it's
[1:14:47] only God's grace that we have the have
[1:14:50] the even the desire to serve him
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; because there's so many out here that
[1:14:55] has no desire whatsoever. It's only
[1:14:58] God's grace that you heard a felt a
[1:15:00] little pull or you help a heard a call
[1:15:03] or or something was said and it sparked
[1:15:05] something on the inside. It's only by
[1:15:08] God's grace. We're not here because
[1:15:10] we're something great or we made
[1:15:12] ourselves something. We have made we
[1:15:13] can't make oursel anything if we wanted
[1:15:15] to. Cuz if we could have, they would
[1:15:18] have a long time ago when they was
[1:15:19] offering sacrifices after sacrifices.
[1:15:21] They were trying on their own. They were
[1:15:24] trying on their own abilities to raise
[1:15:26] the best, to do the best, but it would
[1:15:28] never produce the life needed.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; And so when we look at others, we need
[1:15:37] to remember the grace God's given us
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; because it's very easy, you know, in in
[1:15:43] the world that we live in because it's
[1:15:45] getting very dark and it's very very
[1:15:47] very
[1:15:49] evil and it's the evil is coming out of
[1:15:51] people. every day you see it more and
[1:15:53] more. And then and then and then we also
[1:15:56] even even ought to be real careful with
[1:15:58] the our the grace that we give and the
[1:16:01] and the things we look to and and make
[1:16:03] sure that our eyes can can see like he
[1:16:07] sees.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah, we need to see sin and not
[1:16:11] go that way. But when we see somebody in
[1:16:13] sin, we not ought to be saying looking
[1:16:15] at that and saying not not the sin but
[1:16:17] God be merciful on the sinner.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. God hates the sin, but he loves
[1:16:22] the sinner.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even if it's somebody that's left
[1:16:26] this church, we ought to be very careful
[1:16:28] how we look at that and how we how we
[1:16:29] even deem it and what we even say about
[1:16:31] it. Because listen, it's only by the
[1:16:33] grace of God that you're still sitting
[1:16:35] here this morning.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; It's only by God's grace that we haven't
[1:16:39] walked away, throw down our our life to
[1:16:42] the world, and just said, "Forget all
[1:16:43] about it." Yes.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham looked at this and he
[1:16:50] said, "I learned the lesson in this
[1:16:52] grace and God's blood and the power." He
[1:16:54] said, he said, "I I learned a lesson the
[1:16:57] hard way." He says, and we know the
[1:17:00] story of him being in a meeting in Ohio,
[1:17:01] but give me a moment. I'm going to go
[1:17:02] through it because it's very powerful.
[1:17:04] And he said, "I was staying out in the
[1:17:06] country." He said, "Because of all the
[1:17:07] masses of people and things." And so,
[1:17:09] but we had a little we've been eating at
[1:17:11] this little Dunkered restaurant. They
[1:17:14] called caught it and he said had such a
[1:17:15] lovely little waitresses and decently
[1:17:17] dressed and clean and very ladylike
[1:17:20] waited on us and said little spot of
[1:17:22] heaven to eat in such a place and the
[1:17:24] kitchen was and span and on Sunday
[1:17:26] they closed up and they went to their
[1:17:28] church and so I got a little hungry and
[1:17:30] I thought I'd go somewhere else you know
[1:17:32] and and so he goes to another place
[1:17:34] little common little American restaurant
[1:17:35] that he didn't name it but to get
[1:17:37] something to eat and he said I walked in
[1:17:38] the door and I hear a slot machine going
[1:17:41] man of my age probably a married man
[1:17:43] with his arms around a woman playing a
[1:17:45] slot machine, a policeman of our very
[1:17:47] law to protect our righteous and our
[1:17:49] goods, standing there violating the very
[1:17:51] thing he's supposed to be protecting
[1:17:53] because it was illegal to gamble in Ohio
[1:17:55] playing a slot machine. I turned and
[1:17:57] looked the back of the building, a bunch
[1:17:58] of teenage boys and a bunch of rock and
[1:18:00] roll records on the machine playing. A
[1:18:02] young lady about 18 years old here
[1:18:04] neatly under her anatomy as a woman as
[1:18:06] you get kind of catch the drift. But she
[1:18:08] was standing there with her dress
[1:18:09] hanging low in the front. One of these
[1:18:11] boys with his hands on the girl and
[1:18:13] where it didn't belong and they was
[1:18:14] smoking and drinking. I thought, "Oh,
[1:18:16] God, how can you stand it?"
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; And I looked over to my right and I
[1:18:22] heard someone make a big groan. And this
[1:18:24] little this set this age woman probably
[1:18:26] 60, maybe 70 years old, little old
[1:18:28] vulgar clothes about halfway up her
[1:18:30] limbs and her poor old wrinkled flesh
[1:18:32] just as flabby as it could be. And she
[1:18:34] had up there lip makeup and big purple
[1:18:36] thing on the side of her face painted
[1:18:38] up. Little pair of shoes, purple tan,
[1:18:40] toenails, purple f. I think he probably
[1:18:42] was studying her
[1:18:44] painted and her hair her hair was cut
[1:18:47] real short and curled up and dyed blue.
[1:18:50] Wow. This is in the 60s. And AC and
[1:18:53] across the the table said two men drunk.
[1:18:56] One of them, you know, with a big old
[1:18:57] army coat and a gray scarf wrapped
[1:18:59] around his neck and whiskers all over
[1:19:01] his face, belching and going all excused
[1:19:03] himself from her and walked started to
[1:19:05] walk like this to the restroom and and I
[1:19:08] stood there and said, "God, why don't
[1:19:09] you destroy the whole thing? Why don't
[1:19:12] you just sink it beneath the earth? Is
[1:19:14] my little Sarah and Rebecca going to
[1:19:16] have to grow up under stuff like this?
[1:19:18] How can you, God, in your great holiness
[1:19:20] ever stand to look at such a thing like
[1:19:22] that and not send an earthquake and sink
[1:19:24] it?
[1:19:26] He done it before.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; He sunk a whole group of people.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; But you got to remember that was under
[1:19:32] the blood of bulls and goats.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I was standing there
[1:19:36] condemning the woman and and as I was I
[1:19:40] stepped back behind the door and I felt
[1:19:41] the spirit of God come to me and I
[1:19:43] stepped back behind the door and I seen
[1:19:45] something whirling. And in a vision it
[1:19:47] was the world turning around and around.
[1:19:50] And as I noticed around the world was a
[1:19:52] scarlet streak around it. And I got to
[1:19:54] the world. I seen myself just a little
[1:19:56] boy doing things I ought not do. Amen.
[1:19:59] Maybe maybe not like that, but it was
[1:20:01] still sin. And every time I did
[1:20:03] anything, I seen a great big shadow go
[1:20:05] towards heaven. God should have killed
[1:20:08] me at that moment.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; But then I seen standing between me and
[1:20:13] God stood that perfect sacrifice.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; Stood that perfect sacrifice. And I seen
[1:20:20] him standing there with the thorns on
[1:20:22] his head and the spit hanging on his
[1:20:24] face. And every time my sins would start
[1:20:26] towards God, he would reach out and
[1:20:28] catch it. Oh God, he would reach out and
[1:20:31] catch it like a bumper on the car. He
[1:20:33] was protecting me from the death I
[1:20:36] should have had.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Every time I do anything wrong, God
[1:20:41] should have killed me. Certainly. His
[1:20:43] holiness required it. His laws required
[1:20:45] it. Every time I do anything or you do
[1:20:47] anything, the blood of Jesus Christ acts
[1:20:50] like a bumper. I seen that scarlet
[1:20:52] streak meant that the blood still holds
[1:20:55] the earth.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; The blood still holds the earth. And as
[1:20:59] I stood looking, I got a little closer
[1:21:01] to him. As I noticed him, I could hear
[1:21:03] him say, "Father, forgive him. He just
[1:21:05] don't know what he's doing. Father,
[1:21:07] forgive him. He don't know what he's
[1:21:09] doing." But I looked down, there laid a
[1:21:11] book, and there was a recording angel
[1:21:13] writing it all down and my name on it.
[1:21:16] And I realized that same day that blood
[1:21:18] streak would have been lifted. I'd have
[1:21:20] to stand in the presence of God and my
[1:21:22] sinful self. I seen by his mercy, he was
[1:21:25] holding off my judgment.
[1:21:28] He was holding off my judgment. And I
[1:21:31] went to him humbly. I knelt to my knees.
[1:21:33] I said, "Oh Jesus, thou son of God, am I
[1:21:36] I'm unworthy to come into your presence,
[1:21:38] but will you forgive me for what I've
[1:21:40] done?" And he touched the in his side
[1:21:43] and he grabbed some blood and he wrote
[1:21:46] over that old book, "Pardon."
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; And he looked at me very sternly,
[1:21:55] says, "Now I've forgiven you, but you
[1:21:58] want to condemn her.
[1:22:06] Come on, somebody.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; Come on. We We see a lot of folks like
[1:22:10] these. He's describing even worse.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; Then what is wrong with them crazy
[1:22:15] people? God, what in the world? Why have
[1:22:17] you allowed?
[1:22:19] But God don't see it.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; He sees a blood.
[1:22:24] Now, one of these days, this blood's
[1:22:26] going to lift
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; and then there's going to be sinkings
[1:22:29] and all kinds of things take place and
[1:22:31] tribulations and all kind of stuff. But
[1:22:33] right now, we have this blood and it's
[1:22:36] so perfect that God doesn't see an old
[1:22:38] woman flabby, dressed unmorally. Amen.
[1:22:42] Blue hair, blue, all kind of makeup on.
[1:22:44] And we want to condemn somebody because
[1:22:46] they made a mistake.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. Amen. We're talking
[1:22:51] about a perfect sacrifice here. Amen.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; We want to condemn somebody because they
[1:22:55] left for a for a little while. Hey,
[1:22:57] listen. There's got to be fulfillments
[1:22:58] in the scripture.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; Whether you want the only way there
[1:23:03] could be a fulfillment of the prodal
[1:23:05] son, there has to be prodal sons.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. God allows things to happen and
[1:23:12] people to get and they people look at
[1:23:14] the wrong things and they get
[1:23:16] discouraged and they say, "Well, I just
[1:23:17] go out there." But sooner or later,
[1:23:19] they're going to realize, hey, there's
[1:23:21] better things in my father's house.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; And I I'm I'm sorry, but sometimes I
[1:23:28] wonder if we're going to look at them
[1:23:29] with the right kind of eyes.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Are we going to look with them through
[1:23:33] judgments and what they've done and the
[1:23:35] mistakes? Amen. Are we going to be like
[1:23:37] the 11th hour workers that were mad
[1:23:39] because some are the last workers that
[1:23:40] were so mad because the ones that came
[1:23:42] in the end got paid the same as
[1:23:44] everybody else? Come on.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. Amen. We got to
[1:23:48] realize there's a grace here. There's a
[1:23:50] mercy here. I needed his grace and I
[1:23:53] want it for everybody else.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; I needed his forgiveness and I wanted it
[1:23:58] for everybody else.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; He wrote, "Pardon on me." I want him to
[1:24:07] write it on somebody else.
[1:24:15] So when I come into the vision, come out
[1:24:17] of the vision,
[1:24:19] I walked over to her and I said, "How do
[1:24:21] you do?" Apparently his attitude's
[1:24:23] changed now. He didn't come up to her
[1:24:26] like he wanted, "You lousy sorry sinner.
[1:24:29] What's wrong with you?
[1:24:31] How do you do?"
[1:24:34] She said, "Oh, hello."
[1:24:36] Said, "Could I sit down?" She said, "I
[1:24:38] already have company."
[1:24:41] He said, 'I don't mean it that way,
[1:24:42] lady. I just want to speak to you a
[1:24:44] minute. She said, 'Well, be seated. I
[1:24:47] said, 'Lady, just a few minutes ago
[1:24:49] standing over there behind that door and
[1:24:51] I began to tell her all that took place,
[1:24:53] how that he was condemning her and how
[1:24:55] he was telling God he ought to strike it
[1:24:57] off and how he saw the blood and he
[1:25:01] said, I begin to look and tears begin to
[1:25:03] run down that cheek. I said, 'Lady, you
[1:25:05] don't mean to do these things, but I'm
[1:25:07] here to tell you Jesus died for you, and
[1:25:10] the judgments of God is held off by this
[1:25:12] blood.' She said, 'N no, sir. I don't I
[1:25:15] don't want to I don't want to be this
[1:25:16] way. He said, "My father was raised was
[1:25:18] a deacon in the church. I was raised in
[1:25:20] a Christian home. My husband and I were
[1:25:23] charter members, lived a Christian life,
[1:25:24] and she began to tell me after his
[1:25:27] death, she had two had two young girls,
[1:25:29] and she just went astray and how the
[1:25:31] girls had left her, and she'd throw her
[1:25:33] life away."
[1:25:34] She just thought now there wasn't no
[1:25:36] more hope for her.
[1:25:38] And I said, "God be merciful. Those who
[1:25:41] he has fornown, he is also called."
[1:25:46] She looked at him and said, "Are you
[1:25:48] Reverend Brandham?"
[1:25:51] I said, "I am." She said, "I'm ashamed
[1:25:53] of myself to be sitting here like this,
[1:25:56] but let me ask you this. Do you think
[1:25:59] there's a chance for me?"
[1:26:02] Not five minutes ago.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Not in his not in his mind, but he all
[1:26:11] but he caught a vision of a perfect
[1:26:13] sacrifice.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he said, "Hey," he said, "Yes,
[1:26:17] there's a chance for you." I said,
[1:26:20] "Jesus has his armstretched wide waiting
[1:26:22] for you to come, lady." I said, "Would
[1:26:24] you walk out here on this floor with
[1:26:26] me?" She said, "Yes, sir, I will." And I
[1:26:28] took her by the hand. I said, "You're
[1:26:30] about the age of my mother. would you
[1:26:31] kneel down on the floor? And there in
[1:26:33] the floor, we broke that place up that
[1:26:35] afternoon and had an oldfashioned Holy
[1:26:37] Ghost meeting. And God saved that woman
[1:26:40] by grace. She dressed herself up right,
[1:26:42] came to the meeting, and as far as I
[1:26:44] know, she's living a Christian life
[1:26:46] tonight.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; But what what changed his attitude
[1:26:58] towards a perfect sacrifice?
[1:27:01] that he realized there's enough blood
[1:27:03] for me and if God's got enough blood for
[1:27:05] me and my sin
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; cuz at first you know there's other
[1:27:08] times he tells it he said he saw those
[1:27:10] sins going up and he asked this question
[1:27:12] is that the sins of the world he said no
[1:27:14] that's your sins
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; and he realized God's got blood for me
[1:27:20] and if God's got blood for me he's got
[1:27:22] blood for you and he's got blood for you
[1:27:24] he's got blood for every one of us
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; by one sacrifice
[1:27:30] Not a million lambs, not a thousand
[1:27:32] lambs, but by one sacrifice,
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; he's got enough blood.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; What is it? God requires perfection. He
[1:27:42] requires
[1:27:44] your repentance. He requires your
[1:27:46] loyalty to him. He He's looking for it.
[1:27:48] No matter how much you sin, how little
[1:27:50] or how much. No matter how much you sin,
[1:27:53] how little, or how much, you're still a
[1:27:56] sinner and cannot get in no other way
[1:27:59] but by Jesus Christ, God's allsufficient
[1:28:01] sacrifice. And in him, you are perfect.
[1:28:04] Perfected forever.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Think of it. It's not nothing to do with
[1:28:10] you.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Right? If it's something to do with us
[1:28:16] and we ain't if we think we really think
[1:28:18] that in our hearts, we ain't no better
[1:28:20] than the Pharisees.
[1:28:21] That's what we are. Message Pharisee.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; Ain't got nothing to do with us. It's
[1:28:28] not new pages you turn, isn't it? But
[1:28:30] it's not it's it's a new life. It's a
[1:28:32] confession that you're wrong. And you
[1:28:34] accept God's grace. But not only accept
[1:28:37] God's grace, you accept his life. And
[1:28:40] you that brings you into perfection.
[1:28:42] Then you are perfected in Jesus Christ.
[1:28:45] And this is where he says in Romans 8
[1:28:47] and verse one, there is therefore now no
[1:28:50] condemnation.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; Somebody say that no condemnation.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; No condemnation to him which are in
[1:28:58] Christ Jesus
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; which walk after not after the flesh but
[1:29:04] after the spirit. Now I want to break
[1:29:06] into a little something here on
[1:29:08] condemnation versus conviction
[1:29:11] because there is a difference.
[1:29:13] People get these mixed up. Condemnation
[1:29:16] refers to an act of declaring someone
[1:29:19] guilty and subject to punishment.
[1:29:22] But biblical conviction is actually what
[1:29:26] they what is known or said, Paul talked
[1:29:28] about it, godly sorrow. It actually yes,
[1:29:31] I'm guilty, but there's an answer for my
[1:29:34] guilt.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; And if I accept this answer for my
[1:29:38] guilt, then I am not condemned.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:43] Come on, somebody. Amen. It's just like
[1:29:45] somebody going to a judge. You can be
[1:29:47] convicted or you can even be condemned.
[1:29:49] Now, convicted, yeah, you may have to
[1:29:51] pay a price. There may be a spot of, you
[1:29:53] know, probation or a few years. Amen.
[1:29:56] But if you're condemned, actually, the
[1:29:58] word condemned, you look real deep in
[1:29:59] it. It means a separation. It talks
[1:30:02] about an eternal separation from God.
[1:30:05] It's a death penalty.
[1:30:10] And listen, a death penalty does not
[1:30:13] come from God. Not when the blood's
[1:30:15] still around.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; He He's already paid the death penalty.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; Now, when this blood leaves, yes, there
[1:30:21] going to be death penalties because they
[1:30:23] rejected the sacrifice.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; But listen, he said in John 3 and verse
[1:30:27] 17, "For God sent not his son into the
[1:30:30] world to condemn the world."
[1:30:35] Well, I you know I could understand that
[1:30:36] if he said God sent not his world son
[1:30:39] into the world to condemn the
[1:30:40] Christians. No, he said to condemn the
[1:30:42] world,
[1:30:44] but that the world through him might be
[1:30:46] saved. And he that believeth on him is
[1:30:49] not condemned.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; Is not condemned. But he that believeth
[1:30:54] not is all condemned already because he
[1:30:57] hath not believed in the name of the
[1:30:59] only begotten son of God. And this is
[1:31:01] the condemnation that light is coming to
[1:31:04] the world, but men love darkness rather
[1:31:06] than light because their deeds were
[1:31:08] evil. See, condemnation comes from
[1:31:10] Satan,
[1:31:12] and it's meant to tear you down.
[1:31:14] Condemnation continually points out what
[1:31:17] a failure you are.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; It continually is showing you that, you
[1:31:22] know, that that you've messed up and
[1:31:24] it's showing you the problem, but it's
[1:31:26] never taking you to the solution.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; All right? Amen. Conviction, as we said,
[1:31:32] is known in the Bible as godly sorrow.
[1:31:34] God's word tells us that godly sorrow is
[1:31:37] what leads us to repentance.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; Condemnation tells you you're such a
[1:31:43] failure. Look at what you did. Why
[1:31:45] conviction says, "Come to me and I will
[1:31:48] forgive you."
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; Condemnation is always trying to make
[1:31:53] you pay for what you did.
[1:31:56] instead of conviction is actually
[1:31:58] bringing to a place to accept that he's
[1:32:00] already paid for what you did.
[1:32:03] Condemnation shouts to you constantly
[1:32:05] your past, your sins, your losers. But
[1:32:09] conviction shouts, "The blood of Jesus
[1:32:12] washes away all your sin. Come to Jesus
[1:32:15] and be forgiven of your sin. You can be
[1:32:18] forgiven. Your sin and your past don't
[1:32:21] have to be a part of you anymore."
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:28] Conviction actually focuses on specific
[1:32:32] actions and offers a way of changing it.
[1:32:36] While condemnation
[1:32:38] only focuses on your personal
[1:32:41] worthlessness.
[1:32:47] Oh man, we got we got we done got quiet.
[1:32:50] Convictions awfully involve as we said
[1:32:52] godly sorrow while condemnation involves
[1:32:55] a sense of shame and despair.
[1:33:00] So you know conviction comes from God.
[1:33:03] We know but condemnation comes from the
[1:33:05] enemy. Conviction leads to repentance
[1:33:07] and restoration while condemnation leads
[1:33:10] to discouragement and hopelessness.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; Found this little graph that I thought
[1:33:16] was pretty good. is talk conviction by
[1:33:18] the spirit and condemnation by the
[1:33:20] enemy. Conviction actually is true
[1:33:24] guilt. Condemnation is false guilt.
[1:33:29] True conviction is leads to contrition
[1:33:32] or sorry that you sin. Condemnation
[1:33:35] leads to feeling worthlessness or inept
[1:33:38] a sorry sinner.
[1:33:41] You catch that. Sorry for there's a big
[1:33:44] difference there. sorry for your sin or
[1:33:45] a sorry sinner.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; That's what the devil is constantly
[1:33:50] trying to put over on you is you're
[1:33:52] nothing but a sorry sinner.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; Cuz you made a mistake. You made you
[1:33:56] made issues. You you if you fell down
[1:33:58] one time. Listen, it's not by our own
[1:34:01] merits and our own abilities. It's by
[1:34:03] the power of God that we can stay
[1:34:05] upright walking in faith in him. It's by
[1:34:08] the blood of Jesus that we can rise
[1:34:09] above the filth of this old world and
[1:34:11] the filth of this old thing that we live
[1:34:13] in and the and the and the flesh that we
[1:34:16] war against. It's by the power and the
[1:34:18] blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Conviction actually targets your sin.
[1:34:26] Condemnation actually attacks you.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Conviction actually explains.
[1:34:34] Condemnation accuses.
[1:34:37] Conviction actually illuminates our path
[1:34:41] to freedom.
[1:34:43] Condemnation
[1:34:45] darkens our understanding to the point
[1:34:48] that we don't even believe we're sons of
[1:34:50] God anymore.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; Because truly, if you'd be a son of God,
[1:34:54] you'd have never done nothing like that,
[1:34:58] right?
[1:35:01] It actually conviction actually It
[1:35:04] brings a specific wrong and it brings it
[1:35:06] to a clarified state. Amen. Condemnation
[1:35:09] is a fog of general wrongness and you're
[1:35:12] just wrong about everything.
[1:35:16] Conviction brings repentance.
[1:35:19] Condemnation spreads confusion.
[1:35:21] Conviction feels light and right.
[1:35:24] Condemnation feels heavy and wrong.
[1:35:26] Conviction may not want you may not want
[1:35:28] to repent, but you conviction you you
[1:35:31] you you want to repent and agree with
[1:35:33] the truth. Condemnation, you may be
[1:35:35] willing to confess to anything, but
[1:35:37] you'll never get freedom from it.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; But God did not send his son to condemn
[1:35:44] you.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; He sent his son to convict you and say,
[1:35:48] "I'm a sinner. I'm wrong.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; But there is a way that I can be free
[1:35:53] from these things.
[1:35:59] Conviction shows you the answer which is
[1:36:02] the blood of Jesus and it washes away
[1:36:05] every sin.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; It washes away every sin.
[1:36:12] While condemnation shows you the
[1:36:14] problem, the sin, the past, the
[1:36:18] failures. Condemn condemnation shows you
[1:36:21] the problem but conviction shows you the
[1:36:23] answer. And the answer is a perfect
[1:36:26] blood.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; This is why sometimes young people can't
[1:36:31] get the victory because the devil's got
[1:36:33] condemnation on their life when they've
[1:36:35] already asked for forgiveness.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; Because listen, when you ask for
[1:36:42] forgiveness, let's read it here in
[1:36:44] Revelation 15. Unto him that loved us
[1:36:46] and washed us from our sins in his own
[1:36:49] blood. The word washed is actually
[1:36:51] loosed. It's loosed. has loosed us from
[1:36:54] our sins in his own blood. Amen. Say,
[1:36:56] "Isn't that wonderful?" He said, "Did
[1:36:58] you catch it?" It was his own blood that
[1:37:00] loosed us completely.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; Not partially,
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; not just a partway loosing, not just a
[1:37:07] halfway, but completely loosed us from
[1:37:10] our sin. Amen. It was not human blood.
[1:37:13] It was the blood of God. Peter called it
[1:37:15] the blood of Christ. Paul called it the
[1:37:16] blood of the Lord and the blood of
[1:37:18] Jesus. Not three person, but one person.
[1:37:20] There's a revelation again. One God,
[1:37:22] that omnipotent Jehovah God came down,
[1:37:24] made himself a body by means of the
[1:37:26] virgin birth, and indwelt it, that it
[1:37:28] might be the blood of God that would
[1:37:30] free us, loose us entirely from our
[1:37:33] sins, and present us spotless before
[1:37:36] himself with exceedingly great joy.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; That he might present us spotless.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; I got a lot of spots. Well, you got a
[1:37:48] spotless sacrifice.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. that he might present us spotless.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; That he might pre present us spotless.
[1:37:59] It's not me making sure I got everything
[1:38:01] crossed. Listen, Pharisees had that
[1:38:03] done. They would do the right times and
[1:38:06] the right prayers and the right this and
[1:38:07] the right that. Wouldn't touch this,
[1:38:08] wouldn't touch that, would stone
[1:38:10] somebody for doing it. Had it all
[1:38:12] figured out. But that wasn't the rest
[1:38:15] that Jesus wanted.
[1:38:18] That wasn't the blood Jesus really
[1:38:19] wanted or God required. It was the blood
[1:38:22] of a perfect sacrifice that he that
[1:38:24] sacrifice can present us spotless.
[1:38:28] Amen. He said, see, you can see it in
[1:38:30] the Old Testament type. Let us go back
[1:38:31] to the Garden of Eden. The first news
[1:38:33] came from glory that the son Adam had
[1:38:35] been lost. Did God send an angel? Did he
[1:38:37] send a son? Did he send an unlike? No.
[1:38:39] No. He came himself to redeem that lost
[1:38:42] son. God did not entrust his plan of
[1:38:44] salvation to another. He trusted only
[1:38:46] himself. God was made flesh and dwelt
[1:38:50] among us and redeemed us unto himself
[1:38:52] and were saved by the blood of God. The
[1:38:55] eternal God and dwelt a mortal body in
[1:38:58] order to take away sin. He became the
[1:39:00] lamb in order to shed his blood and
[1:39:03] enter into the veil with it. Consider
[1:39:06] this. Since it was the blood of God, it
[1:39:08] is a perfect blood. And if it's a
[1:39:10] perfect blood that has loosed us from
[1:39:12] power and bondage and defilement of sin,
[1:39:15] then the loosen is perfect and complete.
[1:39:18] There is now therefore no condemnation.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; Who shall lay anything to the charge of
[1:39:24] God's elect.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; Well, if somebody's laying something to
[1:39:28] your charge, I can tell you who it is.
[1:39:29] It's Satan.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; Cuz once that sin has been dipped under
[1:39:34] the blood of Jesus Christ, it's
[1:39:36] remembered no more.
[1:39:40] Hallelujah.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; I got a lot dipped down in there.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; And I'm thankful I ain't got to go
[1:39:46] before him every day and wonder if he
[1:39:49] still remembers when I did this wrong
[1:39:50] and when it still remembers what I know.
[1:39:52] I can boldly go before the throne of
[1:39:54] grace cuz I'm not coming in on my own
[1:39:57] merits or my own abilities. He is
[1:39:59] presenting me spotless.
[1:40:05] Who can lay anything to the charge of
[1:40:07] God's elect? Well, I can tell you, you
[1:40:10] know, you did this wrong and you did
[1:40:12] that and condemnation, condemnation,
[1:40:14] condemn this, condemn that. That's the
[1:40:16] devil.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; Quit listening to his voice.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; Now, it's from God and you did wrong and
[1:40:23] it convicts your heart. Make it right.
[1:40:25] Just like brother Brandham talked about
[1:40:27] that woman, you know, I think brother
[1:40:30] John Andy's did a little demonstration
[1:40:31] in our camp about that woman that was
[1:40:33] standing in line. I think it was a
[1:40:35] woman, right? Anyway, had something
[1:40:36] going on in her life and he said, "If
[1:40:37] you've done such and such and such, he
[1:40:39] said, "Step back out. Step out of the
[1:40:40] line. Make it right. Ask God to forgive
[1:40:43] you. Step back in the line."
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Come on, young person. If you done
[1:40:51] something wrong, step out of the line,
[1:40:53] make it right before God, get back in
[1:40:55] line.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; It ain't no coming service after service
[1:41:00] and crying out to God for hours and
[1:41:01] hour. No, make it right
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; and say, "God, I was wrong." That's what
[1:41:05] conviction is. It brings you to a place
[1:41:07] that you can ask God for repentance and
[1:41:09] you can make things right. Condemnation
[1:41:11] just hangs it over your head.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; The devil's constant, oh, he remembers.
[1:41:15] He got a big list. He's constantly
[1:41:18] trying to bring it up and constantly
[1:41:19] trying to That is not God talking to you
[1:41:21] cuz God doesn't even remember it no
[1:41:24] more.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; He's not the one coming to you when you
[1:41:26] try to raise your hands and say, "Well,
[1:41:28] you remember last week or last month or
[1:41:30] when you used to do this or used to do
[1:41:32] you remember haha you that's
[1:41:34] condemnation. That is the voice of the
[1:41:36] devil."
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; But if you have done wrong and God
[1:41:40] speaks to your heart, he'll show it to
[1:41:42] you, make it clear so you can make it
[1:41:44] right.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:46] And once it's right, it's over.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; Step out of the line, make it right, get
[1:41:52] back in line.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; But condemnation wants you to step out
[1:41:55] of the line and stay out of the line.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; Come on. It wants you to step out and
[1:42:01] you stay out and you get away from
[1:42:03] fellowship. And you get away from this.
[1:42:05] Why? Because you're never worthy to come
[1:42:07] around them people. Listen, we ain't
[1:42:08] none of us worthy to be here. There you
[1:42:10] go.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; There's not one person sitting in a seat
[1:42:13] this morning or standing here on this
[1:42:15] platform or sitting there that is worthy
[1:42:17] to be here this morning. I'm not here
[1:42:19] because I'm worthy. I'm here because
[1:42:22] he's worthy.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; I don't believe what I believe cuz I'm
[1:42:28] worthy. I believe it cuz he's worthy.
[1:42:30] His
[1:42:36] death gave us the blood and that blood
[1:42:40] has loosed us.
[1:42:45] There is now no condemnation. What kind
[1:42:48] of service could we have if there was no
[1:42:51] condemnation?
[1:42:57] If there wasn't that little thought that
[1:42:58] wanted to come and Satan implant
[1:43:00] something in your mind just a moment
[1:43:02] you're about to have a breakthrough.
[1:43:03] What if that wasn't there? I'll tell you
[1:43:05] what would be. You'd go ahead and have
[1:43:06] your breakthrough.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; What if that wasn't there every time you
[1:43:11] went to lift your hands or you went to
[1:43:12] praise God? Listen, I tell you what
[1:43:14] would happen. You would go ahead lift
[1:43:16] your hands. You go ahead and praise God.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you can realize and get a real
[1:43:22] clear picture of where that stuff is
[1:43:24] coming from, you'll cast down that
[1:43:26] condemnation and say, "That's not me. I
[1:43:29] didn't ask God to forgive me. It's
[1:43:31] already done. It's finished. It's over
[1:43:33] with. I'll raise my hands. I'll praise
[1:43:36] God. I'll glorify him anyway cuz I have
[1:43:40] a perfect sacrifice.
[1:43:45] And I have faith in it
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; that in if I do make a mistake, there's
[1:43:49] still a blood.
[1:43:55] I can understand you not having faith in
[1:43:57] the blood of bulls and goats anymore.
[1:44:00] I can understand you having faith and
[1:44:03] not having faith and if it was my blood
[1:44:04] or somebody else in here in blood that
[1:44:06] you're trying to apply. I can understand
[1:44:08] that. We're not talking about any of
[1:44:10] that. We're talking about a perfect
[1:44:12] blood.
[1:44:17] He saw Adam and Eve as they would leave
[1:44:18] the garden
[1:44:20] cast aways. Could you imagine the
[1:44:23] condemnation they had?
[1:44:29] All the things they done wrong. Brother
[1:44:31] just reading over it before I come out.
[1:44:32] Brother Ram says Eve begin to feel that
[1:44:34] arthritis. She be getting to feel those
[1:44:38] pains.
[1:44:40] She begin to say, "Adam, what have I
[1:44:42] done?
[1:44:44] What have I done?
[1:44:48] Adam says, "Eve, what have I done?"
[1:44:52] And he said, "God was watching Adam go
[1:44:55] out." He said, "Because Adam didn't have
[1:44:56] to. He was not deceived. He willingly
[1:44:58] took her to himself
[1:45:01] because he knew if he took her to
[1:45:03] himself, he would save her or God would
[1:45:05] have to strike him, too."
[1:45:10] And God saw that and he said something
[1:45:12] sparked in the heart of God.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; He said, "Thy seed." And he begins to
[1:45:18] talk about the immity. I'll put an
[1:45:19] immity between thy seed and the
[1:45:20] serpent's seed. You won't always have to
[1:45:23] live this way.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; They used to have to live that way in
[1:45:29] the Old Testament because it was under
[1:45:31] the blood of go bulls and goats. Satan
[1:45:33] had a right to bring his condemnation
[1:45:35] because they would go in with a lust
[1:45:37] spirit and come out with a lust spirit.
[1:45:38] They would go in with situations in
[1:45:40] their life and come right out with it.
[1:45:41] They had a covering, but they didn't
[1:45:42] have something that would annihilate it.
[1:45:45] But now, as he said, I'll put him in. He
[1:45:47] said, I can just say, switch the scene
[1:45:48] for a moment. He said, I see him crying
[1:45:50] out for his life. I see him screaming
[1:45:52] for him to be crucified. And I watch him
[1:45:54] walking up that old hill called Goltha.
[1:45:56] And I see a white robe. He start getting
[1:45:59] bright red spots in it. He said, "Before
[1:46:01] long, it's all red." And he said, "I see
[1:46:03] him nail him to the cross. I see him put
[1:46:05] him up there and push the push the pole
[1:46:07] up and sink it in the ground. I see him
[1:46:09] cry out, "God, why hast thou forsaken
[1:46:12] me?" He said, "But I see him say, it is
[1:46:15] finished."
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. If you do a study, I
[1:46:24] was actually looking to preach on it,
[1:46:26] but I hadn't got there yet. But if you
[1:46:27] do a study on it is finished. It's a
[1:46:29] word that means actually three things.
[1:46:31] All the sin debt is paid.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All the sin da debt is paid.
[1:46:38] All the debt, all the debt that you ever
[1:46:41] owed is done away with. Amen. All your
[1:46:43] healing and deliverance is done. Amen.
[1:46:45] Not only that, he's also finished the
[1:46:47] back of Satan. He's crushed him under
[1:46:50] his feet. Amen. Listen, that that devil
[1:46:52] that's wanting to hang over you and put
[1:46:54] all kind of nonsense on your head, he is
[1:46:56] a defeated devil. Listen, he that that
[1:46:59] condemnation that he's putting on you is
[1:47:01] actually his condemnation. It's what's
[1:47:04] going to condemn him and put him into
[1:47:06] hell. Amen. What brother say about that?
[1:47:08] He said when you ask God to forgive you,
[1:47:11] all of that sin is rolled off of your
[1:47:13] back and is transferred onto your
[1:47:16] accuser. And he said, "He will go to
[1:47:19] hell for your sins."
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is what it was. He
[1:47:25] said, "It's finished. No longer will my
[1:47:28] children have to be under condemnation,
[1:47:30] but they can live above it."
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; His death gave us the blood. We're
[1:47:41] loosed. We're free. We're guiltless.
[1:47:46] Now, you got an old book. Yes, there's
[1:47:48] an old book.
[1:47:52] But you do do you know that old book? I
[1:47:54] love how brother Wayne brought it out
[1:47:56] one time at camp about our list.
[1:47:59] I've got a list of every sin you ever
[1:48:01] done, every white website you ever
[1:48:04] looked at, every thing you've ever said
[1:48:08] wrong, every time you've ever wronged
[1:48:11] somebody, just goes down this whole big
[1:48:14] list.
[1:48:15] And he stops and he says, "But something
[1:48:17] happened to the records.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; It got wiped out.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; I had an old book, but something
[1:48:27] happened to it.
[1:48:29] It got wiped out.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; That blood went across it and just rode
[1:48:34] across all those sins. And now all you
[1:48:36] can see is blood.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; It's in the sea of forgetfulness.
[1:48:43] So you can stand perfect before God.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; Your name is now in a new book. Not the
[1:48:50] book of life, but the lamb's book of
[1:48:51] life. What the lamb redeemed. Not the
[1:48:53] old book of your natural union, but your
[1:48:55] new book. A new bride. Hallelujah. your
[1:48:58] new life in the lamb's book of life,
[1:49:00] your marriage certificate where your
[1:49:02] true eternal gene or germ from the
[1:49:04] beginning takes hold. So you're not only
[1:49:06] forgiven, you're justified.
[1:49:10] Look up that word. That word doesn't
[1:49:11] mean forgiven. It means justified. When
[1:49:13] he talk about the just shall live by
[1:49:14] faith, it means justified. If you hear,
[1:49:17] I got drunk and done some evil things.
[1:49:18] Then you'd come around say things and
[1:49:20] you found I did them. But then what if
[1:49:21] you found out I really didn't do them?
[1:49:23] You still say I forgive you. Forgive me
[1:49:24] for what? I didn't do it in the first
[1:49:27] place. If I did, I'm guilty. But you can
[1:49:29] forgive me. But I wasn't even guilty
[1:49:31] because I'm not because I'm justified.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; It's not even regarded at all. God's
[1:49:39] book is in the sea of forgetfulness.
[1:49:41] Your old book and marriage is divorced,
[1:49:43] dead, and it's not even in the memories
[1:49:46] of God. You were justified.
[1:49:49] You never done it in the first place.
[1:49:51] It's forgiven. It's finished. It's over
[1:49:54] with. Amen.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; My, if we can get that this morning,
[1:49:58] that our sins which were many, we've
[1:50:00] been made white as snow.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; God doesn't even remember it no more.
[1:50:07] What a wonderful savior. Oh yeah. Well,
[1:50:10] the accuser may come. He can accuse
[1:50:12] whatever he wants to, but what good is
[1:50:14] it to accuse if there's nothing to be
[1:50:16] accused of,
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; right? You were deceived into this
[1:50:21] place. He said, "You were deceived by
[1:50:24] the parents." I talking to a young man
[1:50:26] yesterday and he's has a lot of
[1:50:28] bitterness in his heart towards God and
[1:50:29] things. I just talking to him just said,
[1:50:31] "Look, don't don't get there. Don't let
[1:50:33] it turn it towards a real enemy."
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; You might might got a right to have
[1:50:38] bitterness in your heart, but turn it
[1:50:39] towards a real enemy.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; God's not your enemy.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; And I begin to talk to him about how
[1:50:46] that that they were sold into this life
[1:50:48] by Adam and Eve at the fall. But I said,
[1:50:50] God made a way and he's made a way back
[1:50:52] to that Eden again. Back to that place,
[1:50:56] back to that place that we ain't under
[1:50:58] that old covenant no more.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Brham brings this
[1:51:06] story about the little mule out in the
[1:51:09] pasture. He says, "I don't know whether
[1:51:12] you ever farmed in here or not, but this
[1:51:13] mule been born with some floppy ears.
[1:51:16] About the most horrible mule you ever
[1:51:18] seen. Knock need crosseyed tail stick
[1:51:21] straight up horrible looking mule. Well,
[1:51:24] I ain't never seen a good-looking mule,
[1:51:26] but this this apparently bad.
[1:51:30] He look around his m say, "You know
[1:51:31] what? As soon as the master of the house
[1:51:34] comes out, he going to knock me in the
[1:51:35] head.
[1:51:38] I'm not even worth the food I eat. I'm
[1:51:40] no good." That sounds like a lot of
[1:51:41] message mules.
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; Follow me in the type now. I ain't
[1:51:46] saying you can't be saved.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; All right. But if his mammy was really
[1:51:52] instructed, she'd say, "Wait a minute,
[1:51:54] son. I got to tell you something. Maybe
[1:51:56] you don't know.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; You've been born under a birthright.
[1:52:00] When the master of the house, I don't
[1:52:01] care what you look like, comes out to
[1:52:03] see, you got a newborn mule. Then the
[1:52:05] thing he has to do is get a lamb without
[1:52:07] blemish and take a perfect lamb and it
[1:52:09] has to die so you can live." He said,
[1:52:12] 'The moment that that land, that mule
[1:52:14] hears that, he got a right to kick up
[1:52:16] his heels and have a big time.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; He said, 'Th that's the way it is within
[1:52:21] us. We're imperfect, no good, born in
[1:52:24] sin, shaped in iniquity, come to this
[1:52:26] world speaking lie. We were no good to
[1:52:28] begin with. But God doesn't even look at
[1:52:31] you.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; He doesn't even look at you. He looks at
[1:52:36] the sacrifice. He looks at the lamb. He
[1:52:39] doesn't even see you. He sees Christ.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; That's why no condemnation.
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; Now, hey, like I said, when this
[1:52:50] sacrifice moves back and this blood
[1:52:52] pulls away from this earth, when the
[1:52:54] bride leaves,
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; there going to be a lot of condemnation
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; there. There going to be a lot of
[1:53:01] condemning. God's going to condemn this
[1:53:03] whole world to fire. But until then, he
[1:53:07] sees the lamb.
[1:53:10] When you come into church, he sees the
[1:53:12] lamb.
[1:53:14] When you're at work, he sees the lamb.
[1:53:19] Now, of course, we don't do as Paul, you
[1:53:21] know, Paul said, "Do we sin even the
[1:53:23] more that grace may abound?" No, that's
[1:53:26] not. You don't got the life of that lamb
[1:53:27] yet, if that's the case. But if you make
[1:53:30] a fault, he sees the lamb.
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; If you have a failure in your life, he
[1:53:34] sees the lamb.
[1:53:40] He said, "God called you by grace, not
[1:53:42] that you would, but God would." The
[1:53:45] scripture said he was a lamb slain
[1:53:47] before the foundation of the world.
[1:53:48] That's God's word. When God speaks is as
[1:53:51] good as finished, right then. So, how
[1:53:53] you going to stamp out the baptism of
[1:53:54] the Holy Spirit? How you going to stamp
[1:53:55] out the gifts? How you going to stamp it
[1:53:57] out of the church? You can't do it. God
[1:53:59] spoke, it's going to be that's settled.
[1:54:00] It certainly it'll materialize
[1:54:03] somewhere. And when God foresaw by his
[1:54:05] fornowledge how he would redeem this
[1:54:08] world of sin and corruption, he slayed
[1:54:10] Christ before the foundation of the
[1:54:12] world. Amen. The book of uh of
[1:54:13] Revelation said when the Antichrist
[1:54:15] comes upon the earth, he will deceive
[1:54:16] all whose names are not written on the
[1:54:18] lamb's book of life. From the foundation
[1:54:21] of the world by God. So God by his
[1:54:23] fornowledge knew you and he called you
[1:54:26] to Christ and he put your name on the
[1:54:28] lamb's book of life. What do we got to
[1:54:30] be scared about? Are you afraid to take
[1:54:32] his word for anything? Don't be afraid.
[1:54:35] He is here and you are heir to
[1:54:37] everything that he has.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; You are righteous because he is
[1:54:42] righteous. You are perfect because he is
[1:54:44] perfect.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; He paid it all.
[1:54:55] I tell you what,
[1:54:59] people come into a church and all they
[1:55:01] see is faults,
[1:55:04] they're they're looking at the wrong
[1:55:05] thing.
[1:55:09] Because if you're looking at Christ, you
[1:55:10] don't see any faults.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; Balam, what did he do? He came and he
[1:55:16] looked on the back side of of Israel.
[1:55:18] They're backside as the scripture said,
[1:55:20] meaning they're hinder parts.
[1:55:23] We all got them.
[1:55:26] Every one of us. We fight this human
[1:55:28] flesh every day.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; And I get amused by people say, "Well, I
[1:55:34] ain't going to go to church. There's
[1:55:35] just so many, you know, so many
[1:55:37] hypocrites there." I tell you,
[1:55:40] hypocrites. Well, why ain't that stopped
[1:55:42] you from going to Walmart or anywhere
[1:55:45] else? There's hypocrites everywhere.
[1:55:48] We don't come to church
[1:55:50] to see what fault we can find or see
[1:55:53] what issue we can see. We come to see
[1:55:56] Jesus.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; Sir, we would see Jesus.
[1:56:02] And brother talks about Bam. He said if
[1:56:04] he would have really looked, he'd have
[1:56:05] saw the pillar of fire that was in the
[1:56:07] camp. He
[1:56:10] and they had problems and said, "Yeah,
[1:56:13] but the pillar of fire was in the camp
[1:56:15] and the shadow of the king was in the
[1:56:17] camp."
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; It all depends on what you're looking at
[1:56:21] or who you're looking at whether you
[1:56:23] will see faults or not.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; Cuz listen, let me tell you, if you want
[1:56:27] to find faults, you're going to find
[1:56:28] them.
[1:56:34] I just I think if I was somebody that
[1:56:36] always found faults, I'll just say,
[1:56:38] "God, forgive me for my unbelief.
[1:56:42] Forgive me for the way I look at things
[1:56:45] and help me look the way you see
[1:56:46] things."
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; Talking to brother the other day, a
[1:56:52] pastor, and he said, you know, and and
[1:56:54] it's and it's the same no matter who you
[1:56:56] talk to. He said there's two, and I
[1:56:58] don't even mean to get on this, but
[1:56:59] we're here, so anyway, forgive me.
[1:57:00] Whatever.
[1:57:01] Said there's two things that people find
[1:57:03] fault in the church the most, and that's
[1:57:05] the AC and the music.
[1:57:09] It ain't just our churches, every
[1:57:11] church.
[1:57:13] It can't be cold enough for some people,
[1:57:15] can't be hot enough for some people,
[1:57:16] can't be loud enough for some people,
[1:57:18] can't be soft enough for some people,
[1:57:19] can't be this, can't be. We're humans.
[1:57:22] We all got preferences.
[1:57:28] How many likes Dr. Pepper the best?
[1:57:32] Few hands. How many likes Coke the best?
[1:57:35] How many likes Pepsi the best?
[1:57:38] God help you.
[1:57:43] We all They just got here.
[1:57:48] Oklahoma thing, I guess. God bless you
[1:57:50] anyhow. We love you.
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; But we all got preferences.
[1:57:55] That's right.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; Every one of us got preferences. Every
[1:57:57] one of us got things we like, things we
[1:57:59] don't like. Some things matter to us
[1:58:01] more than other things matter to us. And
[1:58:03] somebody else, that thing matters them
[1:58:05] way more than ever matters to me. But we
[1:58:07] all but don't What we got to make sure
[1:58:08] of is we don't make our preferences
[1:58:11] spiritual.
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; What's spiritual is the blood of Jesus
[1:58:15] Christ.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; What's spiritual is what God sees, not
[1:58:18] what we see.
[1:58:20] What what's spiritual is what pleases
[1:58:22] him, not what pleases me.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; But that this old mule, all he could see
[1:58:35] is no need. All he could see was his
[1:58:38] faults. All he could see was his
[1:58:40] failures.
[1:58:42] All he could see that he was about to
[1:58:44] die. He was condemned.
[1:58:49] But the master didn't see him. He saw a
[1:58:51] lamb.
[1:58:54] Sometimes I feel like that's how it is.
[1:58:55] And some of our young people, you know,
[1:58:58] they're coming through those stages of
[1:59:00] life.
[1:59:02] They get in those things, those stages
[1:59:04] and moments of their life. They're so
[1:59:05] unsure about this and this that and the
[1:59:07] other. Things are happening. All kind of
[1:59:08] things are happening in their body,
[1:59:09] outside the body, in their mind,
[1:59:10] outside. All kinds of things are going
[1:59:12] on. And they get so unstable during
[1:59:14] those moments and all they can see is
[1:59:17] their faults and all they can see is
[1:59:19] their mistakes. Well, I don't have this
[1:59:20] and I don't I I don't I need this and I
[1:59:22] need that. Quit looking to that. Look at
[1:59:25] your lamb.
[1:59:27] Look what God has done for you. Look
[1:59:29] where God in his grace has even placed
[1:59:31] you in a in a family in a in a home of
[1:59:34] believers or or in a church of believer.
[1:59:36] Look what God has already done for you.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; He didn't start this work to just say,
[1:59:41] you know what, forget it. He's too
[1:59:42] knocked. I can't do nothing. No, he's
[1:59:44] got a lamb for that.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; He's too far gone. No, he's got a lamb
[1:59:49] for that.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; And it's a perfect lamb.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; If you can find fault in him, then you
[1:59:57] ain't got no hope.
[2:00:00] But I'm here to tell you, he is a
[2:00:03] perfect lamb.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; And you can have faith in this perfect
[2:00:08] lamb.
[2:00:10] You can have faith in him when you can't
[2:00:11] have faith in nothing else
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; cuz things will go on, things will
[2:00:18] happen, things will go wrong, things
[2:00:19] will turn upside down and backwards and
[2:00:21] everything gets turvy. But you can have
[2:00:24] faith that this lamb paid a price.
[2:00:28] This lamb,
[2:00:30] he came down so he could break out that
[2:00:35] body.
[2:00:38] Think about what he did on Calvary.
[2:00:41] They tore that flesh.
[2:00:43] They spit on him and the crown
[2:00:46] made fun of him.
[2:00:52] You know why he took all that? So you
[2:00:55] don't have to.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter if somebody makes fun
[2:01:04] of you. It only matters what God says.
[2:01:08] It doesn't matter if somebody may spit
[2:01:10] on you, spit on your name. It only
[2:01:12] matters what God says.
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter if people want to tear
[2:01:17] flesh from you and it hurts. It matters
[2:01:20] what God sees.
[2:01:22] If we can come to that place in our life
[2:01:24] and and that place in our church and
[2:01:26] that place around other people that
[2:01:28] we're not looking and trying to find
[2:01:30] every little fault. God, if I'm I'd say,
[2:01:32] God, if I'm a negative type of person,
[2:01:34] forgive me. Let me see positive things.
[2:01:38] Let me look at what's right instead of
[2:01:39] what's wrong. Let me see what you're
[2:01:42] really doing among us instead of what's
[2:01:44] not happening.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; Let me see the pillar of fire. Let me
[2:01:48] let me see the blood that's running
[2:01:51] around this church. Let me see the
[2:01:53] angels of God that are encamping about
[2:01:55] us. Let me see those things. Don't let
[2:01:57] me look at the faults and the failures
[2:01:59] and the mistakes and this that and the
[2:02:00] other. Let me see you, Jesus.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:05] Let me see him.
[2:02:09] He's the perfect sacrifice.
[2:02:13] If you can find fault in him,
[2:02:16] he said, "Well, I'll tell you why you
[2:02:18] can't be healed. But when you can find
[2:02:20] no fault in your sacrifice,
[2:02:23] then God can do anything for you.
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; He can heal you. He can deliver you. He
[2:02:29] can set you free." You say, "Oh, I feel
[2:02:31] religious about right now because I'd
[2:02:33] know I'd never had a chance to begin
[2:02:36] with."
[2:02:38] Well, if I had just been born in a
[2:02:40] better home. Let me tell you, the
[2:02:42] prophet wasn't born in the best home
[2:02:43] either.
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; His father was a drunkard,
[2:02:49] poor.
[2:02:51] It wasn't the greatest upcoming
[2:02:55] raising a person could ever have. It was
[2:02:58] looked down. It was scoured upon. They
[2:02:59] were looked down upon in the community,
[2:03:03] but God wasn't looking at that.
[2:03:06] God was looking through his blood.
[2:03:09] So, I mean, you may not have everything
[2:03:11] in this world. You may not have all the
[2:03:13] riches of this life. You may not have
[2:03:15] houses and lands and this that and the
[2:03:17] other, but as long as I've got Jesus,
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; I've got everything.
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. As long as I have him, as
[2:03:27] long as he knows me and I know him and I
[2:03:30] can see what he's done for me and I can
[2:03:32] say the blood was shed for me and the
[2:03:34] life has come down and I've given myself
[2:03:36] to him as long as I've got Jesus.
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; I've got everything.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter if I got the this these
[2:03:46] followers or that follow that I got that
[2:03:48] matters not to me. It doesn't matter if
[2:03:50] somebody comments or somebody don't
[2:03:51] comment. I could care less. What matters
[2:03:55] is I got Jesus.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; But more than that, Jesus has got me.
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our hearts.
[2:04:21] Lord,
[2:04:23] make me more like you.
[2:04:31] What if what would it be if Jesus would
[2:04:32] have the same attitude towards us as we
[2:04:34] have towards other things
[2:04:37] and all he seen was the negativity? All
[2:04:39] he seen was the faults.
[2:04:41] All he could about was this that you
[2:04:43] know how bad this was how bad the God
[2:04:46] make me more like you.
[2:04:47] [Music]
[2:04:51] Let me see the blood
[2:04:53] and what it's done.
[2:04:55] [Music]
[2:04:58] Let me see. Lord,
[2:05:02] let me truly see myself
[2:05:06] as you see me.
[2:05:09] [Music]
[2:05:17] Maybe.
[2:05:20] [Music]
[2:05:28] Maybe all you can see is mistakes and
[2:05:30] failures.
[2:05:32] If I can just somehow get you to see the
[2:05:34] price Jesus paid for all these mistakes
[2:05:37] and failures.
[2:05:40] [Music]
[2:05:42] you can be free from it.
[2:05:45] [Music]
[2:05:50] Won't let me just say to the Lord today,
[2:05:52] God, help me to see as you see.
[2:05:56] Help me to look at things as you see
[2:05:58] them, Lord.
[2:06:01] I get caught up in every negative
[2:06:04] thought and negative thinking, even
[2:06:06] about myself.
[2:06:08] Let me see you see as you see.
[2:06:16] Let me see, Lord, that you paid the
[2:06:19] price. It's finished.
[2:06:22] It's already done.
[2:06:25] I don't have to be bound by these things
[2:06:26] over this condemnation. I ain't got to
[2:06:28] live under it.
[2:06:30] Free from it.
[2:06:34] Lord Jesus,
[2:06:37] feel like every hand up, Lord, today.
[2:06:41] God, we just ask Lord that your eyes we
[2:06:44] can start seeing through those eyes of
[2:06:46] Christ.
[2:06:48] We can see you a risen lamb.
[2:06:52] Lord, what this is all about and what
[2:06:54] we're all about.
[2:06:58] Lord Jesus, I pray, Father, you just
[2:07:00] drop your word into our heart. Lord, if
[2:07:02] I said anything wrong, you'll forgive
[2:07:04] me. But Lord, your word will just have
[2:07:06] preeminence, Lord, in every heart, and
[2:07:08] every life.
[2:07:10] We pray.
[2:07:13] We ask, Lord, you'll just move Lord
[2:07:15] today in your people. Lord, may somebody
[2:07:18] walk out of here free from condemnation.
[2:07:21] Lord, may somebody walk out of here free
[2:07:23] from negative thoughts, negative
[2:07:25] thinking.
[2:07:27] But Lord, may we see you today.
[2:07:31] Jesus Christ risen among us.
[2:07:34] The same yesterday, today, and forever.
[2:07:35] We pray
[2:07:37] Jesus name.

[2:12:27] and it's true.
[2:12:33] There is a blood
[2:12:39] that cost a life
[2:12:45] that paid my way.
[2:12:51] Death its price.
[2:12:55] [Music]
[2:12:57] And when it flowed
[2:13:03] down from the cross,
[2:13:09] my sins were gone.
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; My sins forgot.
[2:13:22] There is a grave
[2:13:28] that tried to hide.
[2:13:34] Oh, this precious
[2:13:37] blood
[2:13:41] that gave me life.
[2:13:48] But in three days
[2:13:53] he breathed
[2:13:55] again
[2:13:58] [Music]
[2:13:59] and he rose to stand
[2:14:05] in my defense.
[2:14:12] And so I come

[2:15:06] that sides
[2:15:08] the blind
[2:15:12] that heals the sick.
[2:15:17] Oh, and lonely he fights.
[2:15:24] And it has the power
[2:15:30] to free the bound
[2:15:36] that says they fall.
[2:15:42] upon the ground.
[2:15:48] So pour it out
[2:15:52] [Music]

[2:19:09] All my words fall short.
[2:19:15] I've got nothing new.
[2:19:21] How could I express
[2:19:27] All my gratitude.
[2:19:32] I could sing these songs
[2:19:38] as I often do.
[2:19:44] Every song will sing
[2:19:50] you.
[2:19:55] So I throw up my hands,
[2:19:59] praise you again and again.
[2:20:05] All that I have is a
[2:20:09] [Music]
[2:20:14] hallelujah.
[2:20:16] [Music]
[2:20:19] And I know it's my
[2:20:22] nothing else for a king
[2:20:28] for a heart single.
[2:20:31] [Applause]
[2:20:34] [Music]
[2:20:44] All my words don't show
[2:20:47] me.
[2:20:50] I got nothing.
[2:20:52] [Music]
[2:20:55] I believe I
[2:20:58] [Music]
[2:21:02] grant you.
[2:21:05] [Music]
[2:21:06] I could sing this song
[2:21:11] as I
[2:21:13] do.
[2:21:17] Every song must
[2:21:20] [Applause]
[2:21:20] [Music]
[2:21:26] So
[2:21:28] I
[2:21:31] praise you again.
[2:21:34] [Applause]
[2:21:37] All I have is
[2:21:44] [Music]
[2:21:50] I know it's not right.
[2:21:54] for a king
[2:21:58] sent for a heart singing hallelujah.
[2:22:03] [Music]
[2:22:06] Hallelu.
[2:22:13] I've got one response.
[2:22:19] I've got just one
[2:22:23] [Applause]
[2:22:24] with my arms.
[2:22:29] I worship
[2:22:31] you.
[2:22:34] So I throw up my hands,
[2:22:38] praise you again and again.
[2:22:44] All that I have is a hallelujah.
[2:22:52] Hallelu.
[2:22:57] And I know it's not much of nothing else
[2:23:02] for a king
[2:23:05] except for a heart.
[2:23:08] Hallelujah.
[2:23:14] Hallelujah.
[2:23:16] [Music]
[2:23:21] So come on my soul.
[2:23:24] Don't you shine on me. Lift up your soul
[2:23:29] cuz you've got a lion inside of those.
[2:23:35] Get up and praise the Lord.
[2:23:39] Oh,
[2:23:42] so my soul
[2:23:45] won't you
[2:23:49] [Music]
[2:23:51] might

[2:23:54] [Applause]
[2:23:56] get praise the Lord.

[2:24:06] Don't you get shy of
[2:24:09] your soul.

[2:24:19] Lord.
[2:24:24] So I throw up my hands, praise you again
[2:24:29] and again. Cuz

[2:25:33] trying to put somebody put a whole
[2:25:35] building, whole room full of people in
