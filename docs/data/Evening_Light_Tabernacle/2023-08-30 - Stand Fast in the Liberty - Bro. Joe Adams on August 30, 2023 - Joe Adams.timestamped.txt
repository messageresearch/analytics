[29:13] in Jesus name if you have your Bibles
[29:14] tonight
[29:16] we'll have you look here in Matthew 11
[29:18] verse 25.
[29:21] Matthew 11 verse 25 and
[29:25] trust you've had a great week this week
[29:26] so far
[29:28] some of you had
[29:30] wonderful I will tell you that I have
[29:32] been in a personal trial this week
[29:35] we replace a transmission in the Yukon
[29:37] me and brother J.R my air has gone out
[29:39] three times this week and just just got
[29:41] it fixed at 4 30 this evening before
[29:43] coming to church so God's good
[29:47] and so we just give him the glory my
[29:48] wife said well you passed a test I said
[29:50] well praise God
[29:52] it's always good when you pass the test
[29:54] right if you want to look here though
[29:56] and I want to speak to you just for a
[29:57] little bit this evening on Stand Fast in
[30:00] the Liberty
[30:01] Stand Fast in the Liberty
[30:03] Matthew 11 verse 25 at that time Jesus
[30:06] answered and said I thank the old father
[30:09] Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou
[30:11] has hid these things from the wise and
[30:12] The Prudent and has revealed them unto
[30:15] babes even so father for so it seemed
[30:18] good in thy sight all things are
[30:20] delivered unto me of my father and no
[30:22] man knoweth the son but the father
[30:24] neither knoweth any man the father saved
[30:26] a son and he to whomever the son will
[30:29] reveal him
[30:31] come unto me don't notice now the
[30:33] invitation here in in verse 20 come unto
[30:35] me all ye that labor and are heavy laden
[30:38] and I will give you rest
[30:40] take my yoke upon you and learn of me
[30:43] for I am meek and lowly in heart and you
[30:45] shall find rest unto your souls
[30:48] for my yoke is easy
[30:50] and my burden is light God bless you can
[30:53] have your seats tonight
[30:56] so we find here in in this portion of
[30:59] scripture
[31:00] we're not going to actually use this for
[31:02] our title but this is just part of the
[31:03] foundation we find there's an imitation
[31:06] that's being given from Jesus and he's
[31:08] telling us come unto me all that are
[31:10] that are weary and heavy laden are labor
[31:13] and under heavy burden and I will give
[31:15] you rest well you can cease from your
[31:17] own works and he's telling us no he
[31:19] takes this word here yoke and this yoke
[31:22] is a crossbar or a band and it's
[31:24] generally used in reference to slavery
[31:26] to Troublesome laws that are imposed on
[31:29] one and he's telling them he says now
[31:31] you've had a yoke of Pharisee Traditions
[31:33] placed on you you've had a yoke of
[31:35] denominational views placed on you but
[31:38] he's telling them come unto me and take
[31:40] my yoke upon you take my yoke from my my
[31:43] yoke is is lowly and hard and it's it's
[31:46] a yoke that is easy and it's a burden
[31:49] that is life notice it's not a strenuous
[31:51] joke though it looks like it may be
[31:54] slavery to some yet it's not slavery to
[31:56] us it's our Liberty and we find here in
[32:00] second Corinthians 3 and verse 17.
[32:03] 3 and verse 17 says it says now the Lord
[32:06] is that spirit and where the spirit of
[32:09] the Lord is there is liberty and that
[32:12] word Liberty is a state of being free
[32:14] from society from oppressive
[32:16] restrictions imposed on others notice
[32:20] it's the it's a state of being free from
[32:22] oppressive restrictions that somebody
[32:25] has placed on top of you they give you
[32:27] parameters you can't go beyond this you
[32:30] can't do Beyond this you can only go so
[32:32] far you can't go beyond that but I want
[32:34] you to know the Bible says where the
[32:36] spirit of the Lord is there are no
[32:38] parameters There Are No Boundaries
[32:40] there's liberty there are no
[32:42] restrictions there are no limits he's a
[32:45] limitless God and he's telling his
[32:46] people where I am there are no
[32:48] limitations where I am there are no
[32:51] restrictions where I am is freedom
[32:55] notice freedom from oppressive
[32:57] restrictions imposed by man freedom from
[32:59] the law and its bondage Freedom From
[33:02] Slavery of sin and the power and its
[33:05] guilt and its pollution freedom from
[33:07] traditions of man that's been passed
[33:09] down from generation to generation to
[33:11] generation
[33:13] see we're not bound by some man's idea
[33:16] of worship we're not bound by some man's
[33:19] ID or interpretation of the word or even
[33:21] the interpretation of the message we're
[33:23] not bound by denominational restrictions
[33:25] that some man want to place on us their
[33:28] interpretation of it and then try to
[33:30] bind you of it God is a limitless god
[33:32] notice when Pharaoh when Moses went
[33:35] before pharaoh and said let my people go
[33:37] we're going out we're going to a land
[33:39] that's flown with milk and honey Pharaoh
[33:42] said fine you can only go so far he put
[33:45] restrictions on God's people but Moses
[33:47] didn't stand for the restrictions Moses
[33:49] said we're not going only so far we're
[33:52] going all the way and matter of fact we
[33:54] ain't going to empty-handed we're going
[33:55] to spoil our neighbors we're going to
[33:57] spoil our friends we're going to take
[33:59] our young people we're going to take the
[34:01] old people we're going to take the good
[34:02] of the land matter of fact we're not
[34:04] leaving a hoof behind but we're going
[34:06] all the way out
[34:08] why because we they were called to
[34:10] Freedom they were called to Liberty
[34:12] and I want you to know brother sister we
[34:14] have been called to that same Liberty in
[34:16] this hour
[34:19] but you find man again his tries to put
[34:21] restrictions
[34:23] on others
[34:24] tries to hold him in bondage so notice
[34:27] we're not bound by the limits that man
[34:30] want to place on God
[34:31] see man today even try to place limits
[34:34] on God well God doesn't do that anymore
[34:36] that was only for the 50s or the 60s or
[34:39] that was only for brother Branham or
[34:41] that was only for this group or that
[34:43] group
[34:43] notice God tells us that all things are
[34:46] possible
[34:48] to them that'll believe see all things
[34:51] are possible those that refuse to be
[34:53] bound by the limits of man those that
[34:55] refuse to allow man to put the
[34:57] boundaries out there say you can only go
[34:59] so far you have to act this way in
[35:02] church you can't shout you can't scream
[35:04] you can't you can't sing you can't do
[35:06] this you can't worship you can't praise
[35:09] you got to stay there and just nod your
[35:10] little head
[35:12] man's trying to put restrictions on God
[35:15] and God's people but I want you to know
[35:18] the Bible says for you to stand fast
[35:22] in your Liberty
[35:25] the brother man will tell us in the
[35:26] message the mark of the beast he said
[35:28] the Jubilee time has come that we are
[35:32] free
[35:33] do you believe that tonight
[35:35] come on punch your neighbor a little bit
[35:37] let's get to let's have church
[35:40] it's all right notice he says now and
[35:43] the trumpet is the gospel the good news
[35:45] the trumpet was the Gospel then the good
[35:48] news you're no longer bound you're no
[35:50] longer have to live in sin you can go
[35:52] home and be free you don't owe any debts
[35:54] at all the whole Emancipation
[35:56] Proclamation is done signed for you are
[36:00] free
[36:03] so notice where the spirit of the Lord
[36:05] is not
[36:06] there is no Freedom whether the spirit
[36:09] of the Lord is not it's a dead Church
[36:11] whether a spirit alone is not they're
[36:13] held by man's ideas man's
[36:15] interpretations there's no anointing to
[36:17] anoint the word whether the spirit of
[36:19] the Lord is not there's traditions and
[36:21] legalistic ideas and man-made doctrines
[36:24] and man-made creatures they don't have
[36:25] the freedom of the spirit of God to move
[36:28] within the church and deal with hearts
[36:30] and lives
[36:33] Galatians 5 and verse 1. this is where
[36:35] we're drawing our context tonight
[36:42] notice he says Galatians 5 this is Paul
[36:45] speaking Stand Fast therefore in thee
[36:49] not a liberty but it's D Liberty
[36:53] wherewith Christ has made us free
[36:57] and be not entangled again with the Yoke
[36:59] of bondage for Brethren you have been
[37:01] called
[37:03] you have been called unto Liberty only
[37:06] use not Liberty for an occasion to the
[37:08] flesh but by love serve one another see
[37:12] Paul tells a Believer brother you have
[37:14] been called to this Liberty
[37:16] to thee Liberty God doesn't have a whole
[37:19] bunch of different Liberties and this
[37:20] one here and this one here he just has
[37:22] Liberty
[37:23] and he said you have been called to the
[37:25] Liberty where if Christ has made you
[37:27] free and those it was a freedom from
[37:29] Jewish rights and Jewish Customs it was
[37:32] a freedom from Pharisee traditions and
[37:34] ideas of man and he's telling us that
[37:37] you too have been called unto this
[37:39] Liberty
[37:40] notice freedom from denominational ideas
[37:42] freedom from man's ideologies freedom
[37:45] from sin the penalty of sin freedom from
[37:48] the desires of sin and sin nature and
[37:50] not only have we been called from but we
[37:53] have been called to I'm here to tell you
[37:55] we have been called out of Egypt and
[37:56] we've been called to the promised land
[37:58] we've been called from bondage we've
[38:00] been called to Liberty
[38:03] and notice you are free tonight even
[38:06] like Tabernacle those on the stream you
[38:07] are free to worship God as the spirit of
[38:10] God leads we're not imposing any
[38:13] sanctions on you tonight we're not
[38:15] imposing any restrictions on you tonight
[38:17] you know Church order you know how you
[38:19] should behave in the house of God you
[38:21] know when the spirit hits you know to be
[38:23] free as it moves
[38:25] notice now you are free Church to move
[38:28] as the spirit of God leads you to move
[38:31] some of you may Shout
[38:34] some of you may cry you may sit there in
[38:37] tears just run down your face some of
[38:39] you may jump out of your aisle and dance
[38:43] but however the spirit of God leads
[38:46] there's freedom in the house of God to
[38:49] do just that
[38:51] oh well tell me in the way that they
[38:52] call heresy so do I worship my God and I
[38:57] want you to know the way that the world
[38:58] is calling heresy the way that some of
[39:00] the message churches are calling heresy
[39:02] is the way that we're going to worship
[39:04] because we've been called to be free
[39:06] we're free to Worship in that Avenue
[39:08] we're freed to worship as a Holy Roller
[39:13] ain't my nature try it one time
[39:17] maybe you didn't know you would like it
[39:20] notice the way that they want to call
[39:23] emotionalism
[39:25] you're free to worship
[39:28] in the way that they claim is
[39:29] Pentecostal
[39:33] you're free to worship
[39:35] there are no restrictions
[39:38] there's no limits there's no boundaries
[39:41] there's freedom but you find today man
[39:44] is trying to strip you of your liberties
[39:49] well we don't do that no more God don't
[39:51] do that no more
[39:53] well when did God die and they Place him
[39:55] in his Stead
[39:57] now the word Remains the Same God's word
[40:00] Remains the Same and Paul is telling us
[40:02] he knew what was going on in that day
[40:05] with the Pharisees and the Sadducees and
[40:07] the burden that they were trying to
[40:08] place on this new this this new way of
[40:11] worshiping this new way of life beloved
[40:14] God in bondage but I want you to know my
[40:16] brother and sister God has set you free
[40:19] and I'm telling you stand fast in your
[40:22] Liberty I'm not trying to impose you
[40:24] tonight that I want you to jump and
[40:25] shout and then act like a Wallflower no
[40:28] I'm saying God is giving you freedom God
[40:30] is giving you Liberty God is giving you
[40:32] the opportunity to worship as you choose
[40:34] and don't let man impose his
[40:37] restrictions on you tonight
[40:40] Paul's saying Stand Fast otherwise stand
[40:43] firm persevere be persistent
[40:47] that word persevere means to continue in
[40:49] a course of action even in in the face
[40:52] of difficulty
[40:55] you know sometimes it's not easy being
[40:57] free
[40:58] people look at you a little funny
[41:02] come on Church
[41:04] oh or maybe you jumped up and you danced
[41:07] all around the church and the devil gets
[41:09] right on your shoulder
[41:10] you know how stupid you look
[41:13] oh come on
[41:15] you know how silly you looked knowing
[41:18] that you battling this and you're
[41:19] battling that but yet you danced anyway
[41:22] see Satan trying to impose restrictions
[41:24] on you now we find here it means to be
[41:25] persistent it's to continue firmly or
[41:29] obstinately in the opinion or the course
[41:31] of action in spite of difficulties
[41:35] to stand fast in spite of difficulties
[41:37] be awesome let me young people there's
[41:40] ever a time to be opposite is now
[41:42] be obstinate against the devil trying to
[41:45] steal your joy trying to steal your
[41:46] peace trying to steal your happiness
[41:48] trying to steal your thoughts in your
[41:50] mind trying to come over and hold you
[41:51] Bound by your past and make you or make
[41:54] you be defined by who you used to be and
[41:57] not what God's called you to be I want
[41:59] you to know you ain't got to go from one
[42:00] camp meeting to the next count mean to
[42:02] the next count me and go from one high
[42:04] to the next high to the lake now God has
[42:06] called you into a place of Freedom where
[42:08] you can ride from one camp meeting and
[42:10] you can encourage another and another
[42:12] you ain't got to go don't all of a
[42:13] sudden get a shot in the arm like some
[42:15] spiritual junkie no God has called you
[42:18] into a freedom God has called you to a
[42:20] place of worship where you can remain
[42:22] consistent with the things of God
[42:26] he's called you from and he's called you
[42:29] too
[42:31] from bondage to Liberty he said well
[42:34] brother Joe you just don't understand
[42:35] what I'm going through it seems like all
[42:38] hell let's turn loose on me well
[42:40] praise God wake up we're all in the same
[42:42] battle
[42:44] tells us and I know some of these quotes
[42:46] we read a pretty good bit but I want you
[42:48] to understand the reason why we keep
[42:50] rehearsing some of these quotes is to
[42:52] reassure you and it's to encourage you
[42:54] don't give up
[42:55] we're all fighting the same adversary
[42:57] we're all in the same battle though it
[42:59] may be a little bit different but you
[43:00] say oh hell is against me and the
[43:02] prophet of God will tell us when all
[43:04] hell turns loose all Heaven turns loose
[43:07] also
[43:08] so quit getting your eyes on what hell
[43:10] is doing and get so fixated on what hell
[43:12] is doing and start expecting what God is
[43:15] about to do because God has called you
[43:17] to a place of Liberty
[43:19] start expecting God you see the hell I'm
[43:22] in I'm ready to see the heaven come down
[43:24] because he said notice he said when the
[43:26] enemy comes in like a flood he would
[43:28] raise up a standard to match the
[43:31] opposing enemy he'll raise up an
[43:33] anointing he'll raise her you'll come
[43:34] into a church service church and you may
[43:36] not get anything or think you're going
[43:38] to get anything from it but it's the
[43:40] service you need it's the time that you
[43:43] need it's the personal encounter that
[43:45] you need and God begins to begin to
[43:47] rehearse your conversation and begin to
[43:50] come back and begin to tell you things
[43:53] what was he doing he's reassuring you
[43:54] I'm raising that standard
[43:57] I've seen you in your dark moments I've
[43:59] seen you in your night Seasons I've seen
[44:02] you in your low points but I'm here to
[44:03] tell you I'm with you
[44:05] I'm with you
[44:07] you're free you don't have to be held by
[44:10] that bondage don't listen to the LIE of
[44:12] the enemy he's trying to bring you back
[44:13] down
[44:15] notice what we find today the believer
[44:18] is under constant attack hell is trying
[44:20] to keep you in its grip
[44:22] some of you have already came back from
[44:24] Ohio camp and Satan's already tried to
[44:26] get you back in its grip
[44:28] what is hell trying to do is trying to
[44:29] keep you from walking out
[44:32] as we heard a few weeks ago trying to
[44:34] keep you from walking out trying to
[44:35] strip you of your freedom
[44:37] he doesn't want you to be free to live
[44:40] free to worship free and even act free
[44:43] he wants to control you control every
[44:45] desire he wants to bring you to a
[44:47] sinner's grave in a devil's hell
[44:50] to make his hell your final resting
[44:52] place but I'm here to tell you God's
[44:54] called us for something greater
[44:55] God's called us for something greater
[44:57] program says now in the message the
[44:59] Queen of Sheba but you know when you
[45:02] start to meet God
[45:03] the devil is going to throw everything
[45:06] in your way
[45:09] wake up somebody when you go to try to
[45:12] meet God and that was going to throw
[45:14] everything in your way that he can to
[45:16] throw in your way that's his duty to do
[45:18] it he's going to hinder you in every way
[45:20] that he can but if you're determined God
[45:23] Will Make A Way I said oh blessed be the
[45:26] name of I'm determined tonight I'm not
[45:28] just living it for Mama I'm not just
[45:30] living this for Daddy I'm not just here
[45:32] because a preacher is my favorite
[45:34] preacher I'm here because I'm determined
[45:36] I'm going all the way I've been called
[45:38] out
[45:43] to me according to your word
[45:46] we're free people tonight Church
[45:48] Stand Fast in that Liberty
[45:52] you say well
[45:55] well brother Joe
[45:57] no it ain't no well brother Joe this and
[46:00] well brother Joe that is no God has
[46:02] called you to a place of Liberty
[46:05] it's not one day you're free the next
[46:07] day you're in bondage it's not one day
[46:09] you're saved the next day you're you're
[46:10] a sinner it's not one day that you're
[46:13] free the next day you're in bondage it's
[46:15] your free
[46:16] get it you're free
[46:19] see the truth is we find in John 8.
[46:22] and the servant about it this is John 8
[46:24] verse 35.
[46:26] the servant about it not in the house
[46:28] forever but the son abideth forever
[46:31] and that the son therefore shall make or
[46:34] set at Liberty
[46:37] or liberate you you are free you are
[46:41] free indeed
[46:43] so if the son has done it
[46:46] how many years the son has made free
[46:50] then you're free indeed no questions
[46:52] asked we're not up for debate it's not
[46:56] there's a scripture it's black and white
[46:57] put that in the devil's face and tell
[47:00] them I've been made free I've been
[47:02] liberated from my past I've been
[47:04] liberated from the change that used to
[47:06] hold me you can't hold me any longer you
[47:08] can't keep me in your grip any longer
[47:10] I've been made free by the blood of
[47:12] Jesus because the son of almighty God
[47:14] has liberated me from my past and the
[47:17] passions of sin and the desires of a
[47:20] sinful nature
[47:22] notice brother Brown tells us in the
[47:23] message kinsman redeemer
[47:25] a man that's done something wrong so he
[47:28] is his master of Sodom into slavery
[47:30] actually unto death and he's in the
[47:32] market and he's a slave but a man comes
[47:35] along a worthy man that's able to do it
[47:37] and he finds this man and he finds Grace
[47:40] in his sight he redeems him he says that
[47:43] that takes him from the slave market
[47:45] takes him out of himself notice and that
[47:48] slave once redeemed can never be sold in
[47:51] the market again
[47:54] can never be sold again he's marked and
[47:58] if he was a thought if he was thought
[48:01] enough of one time to be redeemed no one
[48:04] notice now no one can never sell him
[48:07] again for a Slave
[48:11] he says thanks be to God that when a man
[48:13] has come to Christ had been redeemed by
[48:16] the precious blood the devil can never
[48:19] make you a slave again
[48:21] come on church that's shouting grounds
[48:24] I'm here to tell you I don't know what
[48:25] you come in packing Burns tonight but
[48:27] you're not a slave any longer you've
[48:29] been redeemed and you can know
[48:30] Hallelujah you can never be sold again
[48:33] as a slave you've been liberated you've
[48:36] been set free you don't have to hold
[48:38] anything to your past and to those
[48:40] mistakes the mighty redeemers come down
[48:42] and he sent you in Liberty tonight you
[48:45] ain't got to look over your shoulder
[48:46] worry about you're going to go back and
[48:48] see it what about what you're going to
[48:49] lose the Holy Ghost you're gonna lose
[48:51] your death you're going to lose your joy
[48:53] you can't lose it because you can't be
[48:55] held as a slave man and again you've
[48:58] been made free by the blood you've been
[49:00] made free by the anointing of the hour
[49:03] he is loose too
[49:05] he has liberated you
[49:09] take my yoke
[49:11] my burden is easy
[49:14] and my burn is light
[49:17] notice
[49:18] see as Christ has made us free and it's
[49:21] a gift
[49:23] we fight here in Ephesians 2 and verse 8
[49:25] the Bible says for it is by grace that
[49:27] you are saved through faith and that is
[49:30] not of yourselves it is a gift of God
[49:33] so your freedom is a gift
[49:36] your bondage is a curse
[49:38] but your freedom is a gift
[49:41] and the Bible says the wages of sin is
[49:43] death but the gift of God is eternal
[49:45] life
[49:46] through Christ Jesus
[49:48] so notice When we struggle to free
[49:50] ourselves how many you've ever struggled
[49:53] man you tried within your own human
[49:55] ability you tried and tried guess what
[49:58] you did you made it worse
[50:00] the Bible says don't entangle yourselves
[50:02] again and when you try to free yourself
[50:04] you're just entangling yourself worse
[50:07] and worse that situation would have been
[50:09] done a long time ago
[50:11] if you just let go and let God
[50:14] notice When we struggle to free
[50:17] ourselves we just become more entangled
[50:19] again with a yoke of bondage
[50:21] you can't free yourself from sinful
[50:24] desire
[50:26] you young people here you can't free
[50:28] yourselves from the spirit of
[50:30] pornography of this age it takes
[50:32] something bigger than you
[50:34] something greater than you
[50:36] it takes a living God
[50:38] notice we were born in sin shaped in
[50:40] iniquity and yet we try to do these
[50:42] things in them in post I'm not going to
[50:44] do that and we come legalistic in our
[50:46] views look having a legalistic Viewpoint
[50:49] is only making matters worse
[50:52] because now it's based on works and not
[50:54] on Grace
[50:55] but we find see it's going to take
[50:57] something better than our own intellect
[50:59] it's going to take something better than
[51:01] man's ability something stronger to to
[51:03] free us from the bondage of sin it would
[51:06] take a lamb of God who would be slain
[51:08] before the foundation of the world let
[51:10] me tell you that that lamb has ever been
[51:11] bled on your behalf you're free
[51:15] you're free to worship any way you
[51:16] choose the Bible tells us in Romans 5
[51:18] verse 19 for as by one man Disobedience
[51:21] many were made Sinners so about one
[51:23] man's Disobedience many many of you were
[51:26] once Sinners oh but church he says but
[51:28] by The Obedience of one shall many be
[51:30] made righteous I'm here to tell you it
[51:32] took that one it ain't a whole bunch of
[51:34] men a whole bunch of favorite preachers
[51:36] a whole bunch of Camp means it took one
[51:38] man that'd be willing to take your place
[51:40] and that you would take he would take
[51:42] your sin that you could take his races
[51:44] and what did he do he liberated us
[51:48] he freed us from our passions our pride
[51:52] our iniquities
[51:57] if we go back to Galatians 4 and verse
[51:59] 30.
[52:02] Galatians 4 and verse 30 and I'm picking
[52:04] up in Galatians 4 because you actually
[52:05] to get to Galatians 5 1 you got to come
[52:08] back here it says nevertheless what's
[52:09] saith the scripture cast out the Bond
[52:11] woman and her son
[52:14] for the son of the bond moment shall not
[52:16] be Heir with the son of the free woman
[52:20] verse 31 so then brethren we are not
[52:23] children of the bond moment but of the
[52:26] free
[52:27] come on we're not children of
[52:29] denominational systems Bound by man's
[52:31] ideas and Creeds and doctrines and and
[52:33] everything else no but we are free
[52:34] Galatians 5 and verse 1 and he says now
[52:37] Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty
[52:41] notice the Liberty you're not bound any
[52:43] longer you're not held under that
[52:44] bondwoman religion any longer but no now
[52:47] you're free wherewith Christ has made
[52:49] you free and be not entangled again
[52:52] notice a warning don't be entangled
[52:54] again you have been called unto Liberty
[52:56] therefore don't use Liberty as an
[52:59] occasion to the flesh
[53:01] don't make Grace disgrace
[53:04] so it's the Christian's Birthright to
[53:06] think to feel and to act like a free man
[53:10] did you hear that
[53:12] it's the Christians the believer's
[53:14] birthright to act to feel
[53:17] and to to to act and to feel like a free
[53:21] man and to think like a free man you
[53:23] ain't got to have slave mentality
[53:26] no we shall now or not allow ourselves
[53:29] to become slaves again and typically
[53:30] slavery but starts here before it starts
[53:33] here
[53:35] it's what you think in your mind
[53:37] well I guess I'm not saved and all of a
[53:39] sudden now you're putting yourself in
[53:40] front of every dirty television program
[53:41] or reading every dirty book everything
[53:44] love story that ain't fit to be read
[53:47] because right here
[53:49] notice we've done the study on the
[53:50] battle of the mind but we find now we
[53:52] are to be firm unyielding in maintaining
[53:55] the great principles of our Christian
[53:57] faith
[53:59] see our true Liberty
[54:02] you find people today they're running
[54:04] out oh I'm I'm leaving the message I'm
[54:07] free first thing the ladies do is cut
[54:09] their hair and yet you're free
[54:12] a Bible completely tells us how a lady's
[54:15] hair should be they put on past the
[54:17] Bible completely tells us and the men do
[54:19] this that and the other in the Bible we
[54:21] have this is not brother branham's idea
[54:24] this is God's idea
[54:25] this is God's interpretation of the word
[54:27] and yet now they're free and so they run
[54:31] out on it and they thinking they're free
[54:32] they run head long and the first thing
[54:34] you know the girls they cut their hair
[54:35] then they start wearing their makeup
[54:36] then they start putting on the pants and
[54:38] before too long they keep on keep going
[54:40] on and on and they question the message
[54:42] then they're getting to question God
[54:43] then before too long they're not even in
[54:45] church they are completely as Gnostic or
[54:48] they're atheists
[54:49] it's a slippery slope Church
[54:53] because they've used their freedom
[54:56] and enslaved their self again
[54:59] with the enticements of the world see
[55:01] true Liberty is our freedom from the
[55:04] tyranny of trying to earn your way to
[55:06] heaven
[55:08] trying to earn your way to heaven I got
[55:10] to do this and I got to do that you
[55:11] ain't got to do nothing
[55:13] but believe
[55:15] by faith take God at his word
[55:19] see Freedom Stand Fast means that means
[55:22] we have something to do
[55:23] so Stand Fast means it's going to take
[55:25] some effort brother Mike
[55:27] I mean you got to stand Resolute when
[55:29] all the attacks coming from family from
[55:32] friends from work from school from this
[55:34] from that and the other and then for
[55:36] once you've got to stand fast in your
[55:39] freedom realize God and God Alone set me
[55:42] in this place
[55:44] I'm not wavering I'm not moving I'm
[55:46] going to be Resolute I'm going to be
[55:48] obstinate in the face of difficulty
[55:52] I know some of us have a hard time being
[55:54] after that don't we
[55:57] um
[55:58] look at all the smiles on the faces
[56:02] but we find how many of you ever heard
[56:05] of Dwight Moody
[56:07] most of us have Dwight Moody
[56:09] he Illustrated a point of quote an old
[56:11] former slave a former slave woman at
[56:14] this in the South following a Civil War
[56:16] and being that she was a former slave
[56:18] she was confused about her status now
[56:22] I know we have black people here and I'm
[56:24] not I'm not referencing this in any
[56:26] derogatory sense but this is Dwight
[56:28] Moody and this is in the histories he
[56:30] said and he's quoting this this former
[56:32] slave she says now now as I free or been
[56:35] I not when I go to my old Master he says
[56:38] I ain't free and when I go to my own
[56:39] people they say I is and I don't know
[56:42] whether I'm fear is I'm not
[56:44] a lot of you stand in that same place I
[56:47] come to church and the preacher tells me
[56:48] I'm free but when I go back out there
[56:50] they say I'm not my old Taskmaster that
[56:53] old thought that old depression out on
[56:54] anxiety that old pornography spirit that
[56:56] oh this spirit and that lustful Spirit
[56:58] tells me that I'm not free
[57:00] and she goes on she says now some people
[57:02] told me that Abraham Lincoln signed the
[57:04] the proclamation but Master says he
[57:06] didn't he didn't have a right to and
[57:08] that's the same thing that that old
[57:10] Taskmaster does to you he tells you he
[57:12] don't have a right to sign that you're
[57:14] still under my bondage you're still
[57:16] under my grip you're still under my
[57:18] restrictions but I want you to know you

[59:31] when you go back and look at that they
[59:32] were being held by Church of Christ
[59:34] mentality
[59:36] they were all twisted up in their minds
[59:38] and their thoughts oh and the prophet of
[59:40] God now the Lord told him he said free
[59:42] the people
[59:43] he looked at his arms a little skinny
[59:45] arms he got I ain't got no muscles

[59:49] bars big denominational bars Bears
[59:52] holding people behind it year after year
[59:54] day after day generation after
[59:57] generation has been held behind there
[59:59] and the people said brother Ben you have
[1:00:01] been misunderstood and you misunderstood
[1:00:04] the people
[1:00:06] but the Lord said I want you to free the
[1:00:07] people what did he do he sent you a
[1:00:10] message
[1:00:12] God sent you a message to do what to
[1:00:15] liberate you from the house of hell
[1:00:18] he looked at the bars humanly speaking
[1:00:20] he couldn't do it and let me tell you
[1:00:22] I'm looking at the bars tonight humanly
[1:00:24] speaking I can't do it but I'm praying
[1:00:26] in the name of the Lord that he'll send
[1:00:28] that word he'll send the winner the Holy
[1:00:30] Ghost and speak oh in the name of Jesus
[1:00:33] House of hell you give way tonight and
[1:00:36] he said all of a sudden the bar started
[1:00:37] creaking and the bar started popping and
[1:00:40] everybody went out free no longer held
[1:00:43] in bondage no longer held in sins passed
[1:00:46] no longer held by denomination on it you

[1:01:08] notice the whole emancipation
[1:01:10] of proclamation is done signed
[1:01:14] and you are free say that Calvary the
[1:01:16] emancipation of Proclamation was signed
[1:01:18] by the blood of the Lord Jesus and
[1:01:19] everything that Satan ever did to you he
[1:01:22] was stripped of every Power he had at
[1:01:25] Calvary
[1:01:27] oh some of you come dragging in because
[1:01:28] Satan's been lying on you
[1:01:30] Satan been accused I'm here to tell you
[1:01:32] he's been stripped
[1:01:34] oh come on man what's it going to get to
[1:01:38] excite that nerve on the inside let me
[1:01:40] tell you if I was held in the and the
[1:01:42] door Chief facility over here
[1:01:45] something I didn't do and they held me
[1:01:46] against my will they impose their
[1:01:49] sanctions on me
[1:01:50] I'd be a little upset
[1:01:53] man I'll be ready to call me a lawyer
[1:01:57] somebody needs to call up lawyer Jesus
[1:02:01] you held against your own will you are
[1:02:04] falsely accused but uh let me tell you
[1:02:06] when they try me and they realize you
[1:02:08] were convicted wrong you were convicted
[1:02:10] and justly I'm Gonna Let You Go let me
[1:02:13] tell you when I come walking out I'm
[1:02:14] dancing I'm shout out praising God you
[1:02:17] held me here against my will I'm running
[1:02:19] out here I ain't dragging out I will put
[1:02:21] there by by some man's idea some man's
[1:02:24] interpretation but I'll walk it out on
[1:02:26] my own designs why because I got a
[1:02:29] reason to be free I never done it in the
[1:02:32] first place
[1:02:33] and I'm going to tell you tonight
[1:02:34] evening light you've never done it in
[1:02:36] the first place
[1:02:38] in the first place you was in the very
[1:02:40] thoughts of God
[1:02:45] notice now when I hear that Jesus broke
[1:02:48] the bands of death he broke the bonds of
[1:02:50] bondage from me he signed the
[1:02:52] emancipation of proclamation with his
[1:02:54] own blood he went to death at Calvary
[1:02:57] for me I want today to crucify all the
[1:03:00] Flesh and live a new for him
[1:03:02] and take what he gives me and fight as
[1:03:05] best as I can this great rank Army of
[1:03:08] God until Jesus comes
[1:03:10] oh Church
[1:03:13] put your whole heart behind this
[1:03:16] this is not some hot man's idea
[1:03:19] the Bible tells us in second
[1:03:21] Thessalonians 2 and verse 3 let no man
[1:03:23] deceive you
[1:03:26] let no man deceive you by any means
[1:03:30] for that day shall not come
[1:03:33] except there come a falling away first
[1:03:35] that the man of sin be revealed the Son
[1:03:38] of Perdition notice deceive here is to
[1:03:40] believe something that is not true
[1:03:41] typically in order to gain some personal
[1:03:44] advantage
[1:03:46] so deception is a yoke that men place on
[1:03:48] another to hold control over their life
[1:03:53] you know the Jewish teachers
[1:03:55] they counted 613 Commandments that is a
[1:04:00] Jew you had to memorize
[1:04:02] now how many can remember our 613
[1:04:04] Commandments
[1:04:07] or nobody not only did they had to
[1:04:10] memorize them but they couldn't break
[1:04:12] them either
[1:04:13] they had to abide by them you want to
[1:04:15] talk about a law you want to talk about
[1:04:17] a restriction you want to talk about a
[1:04:19] bondage
[1:04:21] and men today will take this very
[1:04:23] message
[1:04:25] this very message that God sent you to
[1:04:28] liberate you and hold you in bondage to
[1:04:30] it
[1:04:31] you don't believe it the way I believe
[1:04:33] it you got to get my sermons if you plan
[1:04:37] on being in a rapture
[1:04:40] nobody I didn't see your name tacked in
[1:04:43] this word anywhere
[1:04:45] notice what they're doing many
[1:04:47] legalistic man a legalistic preacher
[1:04:49] they want to put a message yoke on you
[1:04:52] you find today that
[1:04:54] they want to force Holiness and
[1:04:57] legislate righteousness
[1:04:59] can't force holiness
[1:05:01] you can't legislate righteousness it
[1:05:03] comes from a holy God living on the
[1:05:06] inside
[1:05:08] some of these men are so afraid of a
[1:05:10] little bit of wildfire
[1:05:12] a little bit of fanaticisms and I may
[1:05:13] get with our young people and some of
[1:05:15] our old people some of them that are
[1:05:17] really free they're not afraid to be
[1:05:19] free
[1:05:21] and they want to criticize them because
[1:05:23] they're freedom because they're they're
[1:05:24] no longer in bondage
[1:05:27] you know in order to be able to dance in
[1:05:29] the spirit to shout in the spirit you
[1:05:31] got to First free your mind from this
[1:05:32] right here
[1:05:34] what is somebody going to think about me
[1:05:37] if you can ever get your mind to get
[1:05:40] free worrying about what your neighbor
[1:05:42] thinks what your brother thinks what
[1:05:44] your husband thinks or what your wife
[1:05:45] thinks buddy I'm gonna tell you you'll
[1:05:46] have a time in the Holy Ghost
[1:05:49] you are your greatest enemy
[1:05:52] if you can ever free your mind I just
[1:05:54] want to say try it one time
[1:05:58] try it one time
[1:05:59] I don't do it all the time but I tell
[1:06:02] you what when I do it I have a good time
[1:06:04] I may well and flail and shout and
[1:06:07] scream and it don't slobber and spit hey
[1:06:10] just get away it's coming
[1:06:13] I want to enjoy my time in his presence
[1:06:17] if I went to the Juke Joint I enjoyed my
[1:06:20] time brother Jeff
[1:06:22] oh yeah some of us we remember those
[1:06:25] moments in the Juke Joint the music
[1:06:26] going man that certain song starts going
[1:06:28] oh oh you just don't all of a sudden man
[1:06:30] you just bouncing from my I mean whoa
[1:06:33] you probably never been there praise God
[1:06:34] but I'm gonna tell you why
[1:06:36] that's my you'll be sitting there just
[1:06:38] minding your own business officer and
[1:06:39] that song oh yeah boom you're on the
[1:06:42] Dance Floor
[1:06:43] oh yeah come on get down all that
[1:06:47] and then we get to the house of God and
[1:06:48] the words coming I'm not talking about
[1:06:50] music I'm talking about the word being
[1:06:52] priest and that word begins to start
[1:06:54] something and it begins to break the
[1:06:55] chains off your life it begins to tell
[1:06:57] you who you are because take where you
[1:06:59] come from and where you're going and you
[1:07:01] tell me I gotta sit there and I like
[1:07:02] ain't nothing happening I heard where
[1:07:04] the my brother Tim said the other day he
[1:07:06] said you can't be touched by the Holy
[1:07:08] Ghost and not get emotional I say oh
[1:07:10] blessed be the name of the lord I Love
[1:07:13] to Worship
[1:07:15] and I respond to it because I am free
[1:07:18] and I don't plan on standing there in my
[1:07:22] freedom in my Liberty
[1:07:26] you can take your Church of Christ
[1:07:27] attitude right on up out of here for me
[1:07:30] and my church me and my family we're
[1:07:32] going to enjoy the presence of God
[1:07:36] well I don't think you got to do that in
[1:07:37] church fine you're welcome to leave
[1:07:41] I told you we're not putting any
[1:07:43] restrictions on you
[1:07:46] you're free to worship as he leads
[1:07:50] just stand fast in your Liberty
[1:07:52] Don't Be Afraid notice
[1:07:54] so the purpose of God sending us this
[1:07:58] message was to liberate you
[1:08:01] from man's hold
[1:08:03] man's ideas
[1:08:06] why do we have so many denominations
[1:08:09] because they all got a different View
[1:08:12] why do we have so many facets of the
[1:08:14] message that we know of right here we
[1:08:17] got all these different facets of
[1:08:18] because of man's idea
[1:08:21] the prophet brought one message
[1:08:23] and God brought one message through his
[1:08:25] prophet and that one message the Liberty
[1:08:28] wherein Christ through the message has
[1:08:31] made us free
[1:08:33] because he is the message
[1:08:34] he is the word
[1:08:36] that is our freedom it's not our bondage
[1:08:40] notice now
[1:08:42] they want to claim that you got to
[1:08:43] listen to them if you plan on making a
[1:08:45] rapture
[1:08:46] how many of you listen to somebody
[1:08:48] besides brother Tim
[1:08:50] well maybe a handful of you you may make
[1:08:53] it
[1:08:54] but if you don't listen to anybody but
[1:08:55] brother Tim we're all going to hell
[1:08:58] because they claimed you got to listen
[1:08:59] to my sermons
[1:09:01] or you're not going to make a rapture
[1:09:03] you got me and today that are inviting
[1:09:05] brother Brandon to take to service
[1:09:10] I mean we're going to turn the service
[1:09:12] over now to brother Branham
[1:09:15] come on Church we've got into
[1:09:16] Catholicism spirituality spiritualism
[1:09:20] we're going to set handkerchiefs in
[1:09:22] front of the tape recorder and play a
[1:09:25] certain portion of the tape when brother
[1:09:26] Branham prays over the handkerchiefs and
[1:09:28] say it now come get your handkerchief
[1:09:30] that brother Brandon prayed for did you
[1:09:32] get your hanky
[1:09:34] come on church that's bondage
[1:09:37] that's not Freedom that's not Liberty
[1:09:39] that's man holding something over
[1:09:41] another group of men oh it's deception
[1:09:47] that's not what God ordained it's a yoke
[1:09:49] of bondage
[1:09:51] but God sent us a message through a
[1:09:53] Vindicated Prophet to liberates us to
[1:09:56] liberate us to free us
[1:09:58] so we find now
[1:10:00] intellectual understanding will never
[1:10:02] deliver the people
[1:10:05] we're not looking for reformation we're
[1:10:07] not looking to have special classes
[1:10:09] how to teach our young boys how to live
[1:10:11] above sin
[1:10:12] overcome pornography we don't need
[1:10:14] classes
[1:10:15] no no no no what we need to do is get
[1:10:17] back to preaching the gospel get back to
[1:10:19] preaching the baptism of fire preaching
[1:10:21] the Holy Ghost
[1:10:23] preaching born born into born by the
[1:10:26] spirit and dead to yourself and dead to
[1:10:27] your own ideas dead to your own Passions
[1:10:30] that's what we need we need to get away
[1:10:32] from all this psychology because when
[1:10:34] you bring psychology into it church it's
[1:10:36] bondage
[1:10:37] psychology ain't gonna deliver the
[1:10:39] people
[1:10:41] when you deprive the church from a
[1:10:43] genuine Pentecostal experience that's
[1:10:45] bondage
[1:10:48] when you deny the people access to
[1:10:50] prayer lines that's bondage when you
[1:10:52] deny young people an altar call that's
[1:10:54] bondage when you say you gotta you know
[1:10:57] when the preachers you know you got
[1:10:58] sometimes in some Churches you got
[1:11:00] message preachers they can get all
[1:11:02] excited
[1:11:04] they can run and Shout kind of like what
[1:11:05] I'm doing up here but they put the
[1:11:07] restrictions on you you can't do that
[1:11:11] because you know what I'm confident in
[1:11:13] the spirit that I know that's anointing
[1:11:14] me but I'm not sure what's anointing you
[1:11:17] therefore we don't have any emotionalism
[1:11:19] in the church
[1:11:21] that's bondage
[1:11:23] that's nicolaitism
[1:11:25] that's bondage hold control over the
[1:11:28] people
[1:11:29] but what a God of God sent us a message
[1:11:31] of Liberty
[1:11:33] so that man has no control over you and
[1:11:36] you say well you find out what they're
[1:11:37] doing today and I know this is maybe
[1:11:39] going to turn real quick and I'm going
[1:11:40] to try to hurry up because I we're
[1:11:42] getting close to time but you find that
[1:11:44] you know we get a little bit emotional
[1:11:45] I'm sorry I'm a lot emotional
[1:11:47] I just you know hey if you've been where
[1:11:49] I've been you'd act the way I act
[1:11:52] but you find today that they want to
[1:11:54] they want to entangle the people now
[1:11:56] that you said you can't have any emotion
[1:11:58] in church
[1:12:00] I don't know what in the world I would
[1:12:01] how I would preach if the church was
[1:12:03] dead
[1:12:05] thank God some of you are alive tonight
[1:12:08] think about it they want to make you
[1:12:10] feel condemned for shouting they want to
[1:12:12] make you condemned for enjoying your
[1:12:13] Liberty
[1:12:15] and we find here that in Exodus 28 and
[1:12:18] verse 33 Lauren if you'd put that up
[1:12:19] there
[1:12:21] notice beneath upon the hymn
[1:12:24] of it thou shall make pomegranates of
[1:12:26] blue and a purple and of scarlet round
[1:12:28] about the hymn thereof bells of gold
[1:12:31] between them round about a golden Bell
[1:12:34] and a pomegranate
[1:12:36] Exodus 28 verse 34 now
[1:12:39] let me slow down
[1:12:41] Exodus 28 verse 34. a golden Bell and a
[1:12:45] pomegranate a golden belt and a
[1:12:46] pomegranate upon the Hem of the robe
[1:12:48] about verse 35 and thou shall be upon
[1:12:51] Aaron to minister and this or his sound
[1:12:54] shall be heard when he goeth into the
[1:12:56] holy place before the Lord and when he
[1:12:58] cometh out that he died not
[1:13:00] notice what the prophet of God says
[1:13:02] about this in an earnestly contended for
[1:13:04] the faith that was once delivered
[1:13:05] because I know you think we're an awful
[1:13:07] noisy bunch
[1:13:09] and some of you probably thinking that
[1:13:10] right here tonight man you're an awful
[1:13:11] nosy preacher well you're all over the
[1:13:13] place he said but I can prove to you
[1:13:15] that if there ain't no noisy then there
[1:13:17] ain't no God there
[1:13:20] if there ain't no noisy then there ain't
[1:13:24] no God there listen in the Old Testament
[1:13:26] when Aaron Anointed with the rose of
[1:13:28] Sharon when he had the anointing oil
[1:13:30] that run down his beard to the hymns of
[1:13:33] a skirt he had taken a sacrifice he went
[1:13:35] into the holiest of holies and when he
[1:13:37] went behind that curtain across His
[1:13:39] Garment he had a pomegranate and a bell
[1:13:42] a pomegranate and a bear and they hid
[1:13:44] together and when he walked he played
[1:13:46] holy holy holy unto the Lord that's the
[1:13:49] anointed Church of God moving into the
[1:13:52] holy place and if your life ain't crying
[1:13:54] holy holy holy unto the Lord your dead
[1:13:57] Church
[1:13:58] your life has got to be making some
[1:14:00] noise you saying brother John means I
[1:14:02] got a shout I'm not saying you got a
[1:14:04] shot I'm saying your life has got to
[1:14:06] shout I'm saying your experiences got a
[1:14:08] shout it's got to be crying out that
[1:14:10] there's something on the inside I'm not
[1:14:12] some dead somebody but I've been made
[1:14:14] alive through the blood of Jesus in my
[1:14:16] life whether I'm on the Mountaintop is
[1:14:18] crying holy holy unto the Lord if I'm in
[1:14:21] the Valley of Despair my life is still
[1:14:23] crying holy holy into the Lord if I had
[1:14:26] to put a brand new transmission in my
[1:14:28] wife's Yukon I'm still crying holy holy
[1:14:31] holy unto the Lord if I got to go three
[1:14:33] days without any AC my life oh
[1:14:35] Hallelujah is crying holy holy unto the
[1:14:39] Lord why because there's a life on the
[1:14:41] inside I thought some dead person or not
[1:14:43] some Dead reper face somebody we are
[1:14:46] children of God we've been made alive
[1:14:48] through the blood
[1:14:52] and if there ain't no noisy there
[1:14:56] ain't no God there
[1:14:59] that's not my interpretation that's your
[1:15:02] prophet
[1:15:03] so if you don't like it take it up with
[1:15:05] him
[1:15:07] you say he's Vindicated bam
[1:15:11] take it swallow it digest it meditate on
[1:15:15] it dwell on it let that same life that
[1:15:18] inspired that quote come inside of you
[1:15:20] all of a sudden you've run you'll
[1:15:22] realize there's a pomegranate whoa
[1:15:24] there's a bell oh Hallelujah that
[1:15:26] dinging man your feet get a little bit
[1:15:29] loose

[1:15:52] he said look at here brother the reason
[1:15:53] they did that was the only way they
[1:15:55] could tell that he was alive
[1:15:58] they listen to hear if there's any noise
[1:16:03] they listen they came
[1:16:06] man hair is about to go in
[1:16:09] he's going to offer a sacrifice they
[1:16:11] only had to go one time a year
[1:16:14] they tied a rope to him
[1:16:17] and he when he walked in
[1:16:19] there was noise
[1:16:21] but he walked in bearing your burden
[1:16:23] bearing your sacrifice go before your
[1:16:26] God go before the holy of holies oh my
[1:16:29] and if he wasn't accepted and that man
[1:16:32] died they would take that rope and
[1:16:33] they'd drag him out of there and you
[1:16:35] still had to pack those same Burns that
[1:16:37] he went in with because you wasn't free
[1:16:40] oh but if there was noise on the inside
[1:16:43] and there was some music being made in
[1:16:45] the presence of the holy of a holist and
[1:16:47] his life was crying out and when he made
[1:16:49] that offering when he sacrificed in it
[1:16:51] he put that lamb on that offering for
[1:16:53] you and for me and from our sins and
[1:16:55] that life came back and cried holy holy
[1:16:57] unto the Lord he didn't have to be drug
[1:16:59] out he walked out what am I telling you
[1:17:01] tonight you ain't got to be drunk out of
[1:17:02] this church you can walk out different
[1:17:04] you can walk out free God has made you
[1:17:06] to be free
[1:17:09] notice if there was no noise and he was
[1:17:11] dead and that's he said that's what's
[1:17:13] today the church that's born again going
[1:17:15] into the wholeness of holies Anointed

[1:17:32] to hear some noise

[1:17:36] shouting and screaming and certain ones
[1:17:38] responding to the word I'm talking about
[1:17:40] the spirit of God
[1:17:42] speaking to you
[1:17:44] and you know that he's alive and he's
[1:17:46] personal and he's dealing intimately
[1:17:48] with you
[1:17:49] see if your life isn't sounding forth

[1:18:08] and a belt tied around your ankles
[1:18:10] change the position
[1:18:12] come in with a different mindset
[1:18:14] come in with an expectation that I'm not
[1:18:17] going to let the noise bother me you
[1:18:19] remember I told y'all when I first came
[1:18:20] to church here man y'all was a bunch of
[1:18:22] nosy racket Russ
[1:18:24] I come out of the Baptist Church I'm
[1:18:26] like you know what we used to we're used
[1:18:28] to doing this
[1:18:29] we didn't Clap Hands you didn't
[1:18:31] definitely didn't say amen and shout and
[1:18:33] scream and all that stuff that was
[1:18:35] nonsense you didn't do that in the First
[1:18:36] Baptist Church
[1:18:38] no sir not in Greenville Mississippi
[1:18:42] no I came over here first time all this
[1:18:45] people bopping up and down I'm like what
[1:18:46] in the world have I gotten myself into
[1:18:50] I can't hear the preacher everybody's
[1:18:52] shouting everybody's screaming hands are
[1:18:54] going up I can't see what he looks like
[1:18:55] everything's in the way but all of a
[1:18:58] sudden I find myself you know I kept
[1:19:00] coming some drugged me back
[1:19:02] wow there was a seed on the inside what
[1:19:05] am I telling you I was once I was
[1:19:06] critical of all that record I was
[1:19:08] critical of all that noise oh but let me
[1:19:10] tell you when I changed shoes one time
[1:19:12] and I tied up pomegranate and a bell and
[1:19:15] got the Holy Ghost one time let me tell
[1:19:17] you brother it changed the situation it
[1:19:20] changed my mentality it changed the way
[1:19:22] I walked it changed the way I talked it
[1:19:25] changed the way I danced it changed the
[1:19:27] way I come to church I come from a mic
[1:19:29] with an expectation to hear some noise
[1:19:32] to hear somebody you know the anointing
[1:19:35] of the Holy Ghost and begin to shout
[1:19:37] hallelujah I was once burned but now I
[1:19:41] see I was once bound but now I'm free
[1:19:47] oh Hallelujah
[1:19:51] oh my God I could preach I should have
[1:19:53] saved this for Sunday
[1:19:57] oh but we fine notice what he says now
[1:20:01] oh he goes I can tell him he goes I tell
[1:20:04] you the only way you know that there's
[1:20:05] any life in the church when a little
[1:20:07] noise gets started somewhere
[1:20:09] Oh Sister scream out
[1:20:15] don't laugh
[1:20:16] man when I hear that yeah Faith muscles
[1:20:19] begin to come up
[1:20:21] oh cause what I know he's here
[1:20:24] I know whatsoever things that we asked
[1:20:26] in that time in that presence when that
[1:20:28] anointing drops down we can have
[1:20:30] whatsoever we ask for because why it's
[1:20:32] no longer the man but it's almighty God
[1:20:35] the pillar of fire dropping down into a
[1:20:37] church service and the noise begin to
[1:20:39] ring out people get to respond not to
[1:20:43] the man not to the voice not to the
[1:20:45] vessel but they responded to the spirit
[1:20:47] of God
[1:20:50] he said well
[1:20:52] the Bible says got to a place when you
[1:20:54] go to churches it's either so cold and
[1:20:56] formal and dry to the spiritual
[1:20:58] thermometer will hit 50 Below Zero May
[1:21:01] that never be
[1:21:03] tacked on even like Tabernacle
[1:21:07] the people just notice what he says now
[1:21:11] people just
[1:21:13] they just set like a ward on a pickle
[1:21:16] just as sour and in different and
[1:21:20] puckered up
[1:21:23] that's the best pucker and I can do for
[1:21:25] you
[1:21:26] Faith just sit
[1:21:29] sour puckered up
[1:21:33] you know what you don't want to preach
[1:21:35] to that kind of person
[1:21:37] you know what I do my best to look away
[1:21:41] I I I'm just being honest it's hard to
[1:21:44] preach to some puckered up
[1:21:46] bump on a pickle
[1:21:48] man a man done study gave up his time
[1:21:50] prayed to God will lead him and guide
[1:21:52] them and speak to him and minister to
[1:21:54] heart's life and you got somebody out
[1:21:56] there just
[1:21:59] I'll Puck it up and half asleep no we
[1:22:02] got to come with an expectation to hear

[1:22:12] a church and it ain't got no noise but
[1:22:13] let me tell you you didn't come to this
[1:22:15] church and expecting any no noise here
[1:22:17] because we're noisy bunch of people
[1:22:19] because why we end up being shook by the
[1:22:21] power of the Holy Ghost we have met the
[1:22:24] almighty God we have been set free the
[1:22:27] same angel that came down on the day of
[1:22:29] Pentecost is the same one that's here
[1:22:32] today and he's breaking bars and he's
[1:22:34] losing their teeth and he said captivity
[1:22:36] Captain that's my God that's my this
[1:22:39] word that's who we are we have been
[1:22:42] called to a place of freedom

[1:27:04] the aisle now
[1:27:05] like brother man I'm dancing in the
[1:27:07] spirit
[1:27:08] turn my house into it or my my church
[1:27:10] into a Tavern critical
[1:27:13] but he said what if they're right
[1:27:15] and I'm wrong
[1:27:19] I replay that all the time what if
[1:27:21] they're right and I'm wrong
[1:27:24] oh church let us not be
[1:27:26] let's not be held responsible for for
[1:27:28] quenching the spirit
[1:27:30] and I'm not saying we all got to act
[1:27:32] like a bunch of hooligans I'm not saying
[1:27:34] that at all I'm saying there's a freedom
[1:27:36] to worship
[1:27:39] because he that the sun is made free is
[1:27:42] free indeed
[1:27:44] no bars no chains notice he says I've
[1:27:47] seen meetings where the power of God was
[1:27:48] revealed to the people that they were
[1:27:50] free from the world the things of the
[1:27:52] world and the joy of the Lord filled the
[1:27:54] congregation they stood and they
[1:27:56] screamed and they cried and they shouted
[1:27:58] to the top of their voice just so you
[1:28:00] know this is 19th and 64.
[1:28:04] after the opening of the seals the
[1:28:06] prophet of God still preached and he
[1:28:08] still believed in emotional religion
[1:28:11] notice they shouted to the top of their
[1:28:13] voice for the glory of God I never did
[1:28:15] see anything disorderly they was always
[1:28:18] right in order
[1:28:21] because they had recognized that their
[1:28:23] name had been written in the Lamb's Book
[1:28:25] of Life before the foundation of the
[1:28:26] world the great prophet Shepherd had
[1:28:29] brought them the messes and they were
[1:28:31] delivered no matter what the other
[1:28:33] ecclesiastical realm said about it they
[1:28:36] knew what had happened just as them
[1:28:38] Shepherds did back there and they knowed
[1:28:40] what took place and those that shout
[1:28:42] those that jumped those that screamed
[1:28:45] those that cry those that allow the
[1:28:48] spirit of God to move upon them you know
[1:28:50] what took place
[1:28:53] all Church
[1:28:54] let me bring this down musicians go
[1:28:56] ahead and make your way back
[1:28:58] my brother said I was preaching there
[1:29:00] was a woman crying she was holding up
[1:29:01] her hands and crying and praising God
[1:29:03] and the Holy Spirit was there the woman
[1:29:05] was filled with the Holy Ghost how can a
[1:29:07] magnet draw anything unless it's
[1:29:08] magnetized to it correct he goes there
[1:29:10] was a man who belonged to another church
[1:29:12] he was a friend of mine
[1:29:14] standing there outside he said Billy I
[1:29:16] was enjoying your sermon
[1:29:18] until that woman raised up and started
[1:29:20] crying said how in the world could you
[1:29:22] preach and her acting like that
[1:29:25] listen to his response I said that's the
[1:29:27] only time I can preach
[1:29:32] oh church and that's the only time that
[1:29:35] I can't preach I want to see you
[1:29:37] shouting
[1:29:38] oh why why you want to see me shout
[1:29:41] because I know that the inside of that
[1:29:42] life is overcoming power and I know that
[1:29:45] the house that all hails against you but
[1:29:47] when you shout what are you telling hell
[1:29:49] to give way
[1:29:51] you can't hold me I'm walking out
[1:29:54] notice he says now he says that's the
[1:29:57] only time I can preach and when I see
[1:29:58] the power of God has caught away the
[1:30:00] church call the way the message he said
[1:30:03] it just made Shivers run over my back I
[1:30:06] said if you ever if you'd ever be
[1:30:08] fortunate to get to heaven you would
[1:30:09] freeze to death
[1:30:11] huh because they're crying and shouting
[1:30:13] and praising God day and night Angels
[1:30:16] flying back and forth crying holy holy
[1:30:18] holy unto the Lord and let me tell you
[1:30:20] right now brother he says you're living
[1:30:22] in the cry quietest World you'll ever
[1:30:24] live in
[1:30:27] if you go to hell there's weeping and
[1:30:29] wailing and National teeth if you go to
[1:30:32] heaven there's hallelujahs and Praises
[1:30:34] of God day and night all the times all
[1:30:37] in eternity this is the quietest place
[1:30:41] that you will ever live
[1:30:45] so if you plan on being in heaven
[1:30:48] I got any Heaven takers tonight
[1:30:51] and you better practice getting noisy
[1:30:55] you better practice your Praises you
[1:30:58] better start practicing your hallelujahs

[1:31:03] be heard over there it ain't gonna be
[1:31:05] your belly grubs and your ups and downs
[1:31:07] and your disappointments in life and
[1:31:09] everybody's against you and Wows and

[1:31:15] tonight we might as well start here we
[1:31:17] might as well start tonight we might as
[1:31:19] well start expecting Lord you said if
[1:31:21] there ain't no noise there there ain't

[1:31:25] people up but God I know where you are
[1:31:26] if sends a response to the people their
[1:31:29] hearts begin to be churned and that
