[26:56] Lord to lift up your name and worship
[26:58] you Father

[27:02] hear from a man nor if we did how
[27:05] greatly disappointed we would be but
[27:08] father we've come for you to speak to
[27:10] our hearts we've come for you Lord God
[27:13] to have your way Lord Lord now we
[27:15] surrender ourselves into your hand Lord
[27:18] we surrender the Lord the the gift that
[27:21] you gave us into your hand and we ask
[27:23] that you help us to move ourselves out
[27:25] of the way
[27:25] Lord loose my tongue and free my spirit
[27:28] Lord to speak how you would have me to
[27:30] speak Lord might I might not be bound by
[27:33] my own thoughts are bound by even notes
[27:35] or things that I've brought with me here
[27:37] Lord but may you have your way Lord
[27:39] speak to every heart tonight father we
[27:41] know Lord Jesus that when you're in the
[27:43] building miracles happen Lord God and
[27:46] we're expecting nothing less father than
[27:48] miracles because that's the kind of God
[27:50] we serve in Jesus name Amen if you have
[27:55] your Bibles with you if you will turn to
[27:58] second Corinthians four and the eighth
[28:01] verse we're gonna read there and then
[28:03] we'll read one verse from over in the
[28:05] book of Acts chapter 23
[28:08] you know we've joked before that they
[28:11] make sure they give me a small bottle of
[28:13] water so i dont preach long and i come
[28:14] out this time and they gave me an empty
[28:16] one so I thought my goodness we bout to
[28:20] shut down amen second Corinthians four
[28:27] and verse eight says we were troubled on
[28:32] every side yet not distressed we are
[28:36] perplexed but not in despair persecuted
[28:41] but not forsaken cast down but not
[28:46] destroyed Amen if you'll look with me in
[28:48] acts 23 verse 11 it says and the night
[28:54] following the Lord stood by him and said
[28:57] be of good cheer Paul for as thou has
[28:59] testified of me in Jerusalem
[29:01] so must thou bear witness also at Rome I
[29:06] prayed that God allowed his blessing to
[29:08] the reading of the word you may have
[29:10] your seats brother branham told us that
[29:18] God will always have somebody that will
[29:22] stand for him he taught us that he'll
[29:25] always have somebody that he can put his
[29:27] hand on somebody that will do his will
[29:29] somebody that will have a testimony in
[29:32] the I word that they live in and I know
[29:35] that the time we live in is getting more
[29:37] and more evil and it seems like
[29:38] sometimes you look around and more and
[29:40] more people are following away and
[29:41] there's fewer and fewer of us it seems
[29:43] however what we know beyond a shadow of
[29:46] a doubt is God is going to have somebody
[29:48] God is gonna have somebody that believes
[29:51] all of his word God is gonna have
[29:53] somebody that is completely surrendered
[29:55] to his will God is gonna have somebody
[29:58] that he can put his hand on for a
[30:00] testimony in this dark and evil age that
[30:03] we live in there's always been people
[30:04] down through the ages that were willing
[30:06] to believe parts of the word or were
[30:08] willing to surrender parts of themselves
[30:10] to him but he always had somebody that
[30:12] was totally surrendered somebody that
[30:14] was totally submitted and somebody that
[30:16] was willing to do the will of God
[30:19] brother Branham says I love that don't
[30:21] you love that God has never been without
[30:23] a witness God has always had a witness
[30:26] since the world began
[30:27] sometimes it come down to one man but
[30:30] God has always had somebody he could lay
[30:32] his finger on and say this is my servant
[30:36] in all ages and it's going to be the
[30:40] same way in this last stage that we're
[30:42] standing in now God's not going to get
[30:43] down to this last stage here at the
[30:45] closing of time and not have somebody
[30:48] that's going to stand up for his word
[30:49] he's not going to get down to the very
[30:51] end the very end of his plan and not
[30:53] have somebody in the palm of his hand
[30:55] that's willing to submit to him and do
[30:58] the will of the Father he's going to
[31:00] have somebody that will believe all the
[31:03] Word of God I believe for myself that
[31:06] this church stands for all of the Word
[31:09] of God I believe that this is a church
[31:11] that believes that all the promises
[31:14] God or true I believe that this is a
[31:16] church full of people that have
[31:17] experienced the highest of highs and yet
[31:19] many of us have experienced the lowest
[31:21] of lows and been through the darkest of
[31:23] valleys but through it all we know that
[31:25] God's Word is true
[31:27] through it all we remain anchored to the
[31:29] Rock of Ages through it all we remain
[31:31] anchor to the rough that is Jesus Christ
[31:33] brother Branham says my faith is stayed
[31:36] on the solid rock
[31:37] there's nothing can ever harm when
[31:40] you're anchored in that place the storms
[31:42] may shake and batteries but my anchor
[31:45] holds within the veil when a man or
[31:47] woman has anchored against that rock
[31:49] hallelujah there ain't nothing can ever
[31:52] shake you from it and tonight I want us
[31:54] to keep that in mind as we go through
[31:56] the things we discuss it doesn't matter
[31:58] what you're facing it doesn't matter
[31:59] where you're at tonight I'm telling you
[32:01] if you're standing on the rock you will
[32:03] not be moved I'm telling you if you're
[32:05] standing on the rock there's something
[32:07] that's still holding you I'm telling you
[32:09] if you're standing on the rock when the
[32:10] storm passes you're still gonna be
[32:12] standing there on the rock of ages' if
[32:15] you're standing on the rock tonight you
[32:17] have a sure foundation I believe that we
[32:21] are a people here anchored in Jesus
[32:24] Christ I believe that we're part of the
[32:26] people that have been seen in the vision
[32:28] and that's so important to us in this
[32:30] day I believe that we've been seen as
[32:32] overcomers I believe that when brother
[32:34] Branham saw the bride go up he saw you I
[32:38] believe that with all my heart I
[32:40] believed that I was a part of that I
[32:41] believed that you were a part of that
[32:43] when others went down you end up Church
[32:46] how comforting is that to know you say
[32:47] the world's going down it's okay I'm
[32:49] going up a little bit more every day the
[32:51] world's going down it's okay they've
[32:53] been seen going down but we've been seen
[32:55] going up and if we can see the world in
[32:57] that condition that what place does that
[32:59] put us at if we see them going down down
[33:02] down then even if you can't recognize
[33:03] that you have to know that at the exact
[33:05] same time there's are people going up
[33:07] and tonight I say take another step up
[33:10] take another step
[33:11] take another step closer get your eyes
[33:14] up the ones going down that's not us
[33:15] that's not who we are we don't have a
[33:18] part of that but we're going up tonight
[33:20] in Jesus name you said brother Aaron how
[33:24] do I know I was a part of that vision
[33:26] the devil tells me I'm not going to make
[33:29] it the devil tells me I was one of the
[33:31] ones that went down the devil tells me
[33:34] the devil tells me listen the devil is
[33:36] very good at his job and I don't if I'm
[33:39] gonna give him any credit I'll say that
[33:40] he's good at his job he's good at
[33:42] tearing you down he's good at lying -
[33:43] he's good at making you feel like you're
[33:45] a failure and you've come short quit
[33:46] listening to the devil we hear it over
[33:49] and over again and yet we continue to do
[33:51] it over and over again every one of our
[33:53] complexes every one of the things we
[33:54] deal with every fear we face is because
[33:56] we listen to the devil that's where they
[33:59] all came from and if I could get some of
[34:01] you not to hold on to the promises of
[34:03] God the way you hold on to the complexes
[34:05] if I could get you to hold on to the
[34:06] promises of God the way you hold on to
[34:08] the things that the devil is telling you
[34:10] you would be the most victorious person
[34:12] in this church tonight let's hold on to
[34:16] the right things you say how do I know
[34:19] the devil told me I'm not going to make
[34:22] it because the message called your name
[34:26] bear with me here and I realized that
[34:29] every person that hears this message
[34:30] isn't going to go I realize that but if
[34:33] the message called your name listen when
[34:35] I was in the chicken pen they told me I
[34:37] was a chicken but one day that Eagle
[34:39] screamed and I recognized it every one
[34:42] of those chickens heard the same thing I
[34:43] heard every one of those chickens heard
[34:46] that Eagle scream but it didn't mean
[34:47] nothing to them they just kept on
[34:48] pecking around doing what chickens do
[34:50] but I heard that Eagle scream and I said
[34:52] that's me something's calling me
[34:54] something said my name and something
[34:57] said your name when you heard this
[34:59] message there was a deep that called to
[35:02] the deep that was a vision of the bride
[35:04] whose name had been called by the
[35:07] message that's what that vision was it
[35:09] was a vision of the
[35:11] whose name had been called in a vision
[35:13] of the ones who had responded and stayed
[35:15] true to that message if the message
[35:18] calls your name tonight that means your
[35:20] your name was in the message think about
[35:24] that just for a minute if the message
[35:25] called your name if you heard your name
[35:28] in the message you couldn't hear it
[35:29] there unless your name was in the
[35:32] message how wonderful that is how
[35:34] powerful how much that stirs my soul it
[35:36] may not do nothing for you but to know
[35:38] that's the message of the I where my
[35:40] name was written there the message of
[35:42] the hour my name was there that devil
[35:45] wants to say you're a failure the devil
[35:46] says you do this you do that I just want
[35:48] to say my name's in the message devil
[35:50] my name is there my name is there and
[35:53] it's been there on the book of the last
[35:55] book of life since before the foundation
[35:56] of the world
[35:58] my name is there if you didn't have that
[36:02] seed gene of God you wouldn't have
[36:04] wanted it you wouldn't have responded to
[36:07] it but that evil scream identified you
[36:10] and therefore it places you in the
[36:14] vision a vision that told you you were
[36:17] going to rapture a vision that told you
[36:20] where you come from and where you're
[36:21] going a vision that said you're an
[36:23] overcomer a word to you personally
[36:28] listen I'm not telling you tonight that
[36:30] you're exactly where you need to be
[36:32] spiritually that's between you and God
[36:35] you know where you are but I'm telling
[36:39] you it's for you I'm telling you it
[36:41] called your name I'm telling you that
[36:44] you've been seen overcoming now it's up
[36:46] to you to step into the vision it's up
[36:48] to you to walk into the vision that's
[36:50] already been seen of you we have all
[36:52] been seen overcoming in this day and
[36:55] this is an important part might I remind
[36:58] you that the vision never failed Satan
[37:03] says you're not going to make it I say
[37:04] Satan there's never been a vision that
[37:06] failed God never sent a vision to the
[37:09] prophet of the hour that failed and if
[37:11] I've been seen in a vision going up I
[37:13] don't care what you do I don't
[37:15] what you say I don't care what wind
[37:17] blows I don't care what we have to go
[37:18] through I know that one of these days
[37:20] I'm going to step into that vision and
[37:22] in a moment in a twinkling of an eye
[37:24] these sails are going to begin to change
[37:26] everything about me is going to begin to
[37:28] change and I'm going to rapture because
[37:29] I've already been seen there and there's
[37:31] nothing he can do about it once it's
[37:33] already been seen it's already been seen
[37:36] in the mind of God he can't stop it get
[37:38] that through your head tonight he can't
[37:40] stop you from rapture and he can't
[37:42] defeat you
[37:43] he can't overcome you you've already
[37:45] been seen in God's month rapture at the
[37:48] end of this age you cannot be stopped
[37:56] and we're yet with that in mind
[37:59] Satan is a stubborn fellow he doesn't
[38:06] take kids to well he's been defeated
[38:11] time after time after time he was
[38:15] resisted in the Old Testament by those
[38:17] Saints and defeated he was defeated and
[38:21] whipped completely and stripped of his
[38:23] power at Calvary he was completely
[38:26] whipped there he was defeated time after
[38:28] time down through the church ages and as
[38:30] dark as it was he was defeated in the
[38:32] Dark Ages because there was always
[38:33] somebody that would stand and now here
[38:36] we are once again at the end of the age
[38:38] and he's been defeated time after time
[38:40] after time he has the worst losing
[38:43] record in the history of anybody ever
[38:46] and here we are again getting ready to
[38:49] hand him one more L here we are again
[38:51] that getting ready to hand it one more
[38:52] loss cause I'm telling you the bride of
[38:54] Jesus Christ is going to defeat him one
[38:56] more final time before we go in the
[38:59] rapture and it won't just be one little
[39:01] defeat it's like brother Timothy said
[39:02] the other day the word all what he's
[39:04] dealing with sicknesses he said somebody
[39:05] will be healed and delivered and
[39:08] overcome every single sickness that
[39:11] Satan has put on this earth every demon
[39:13] will be overcome every demon will be
[39:15] cast down every depression every anxiety
[39:18] every fear everything there is will be
[39:20] completely
[39:21] utterly and totally destroyed by the
[39:23] bride of Jesus Christ before we leave
[39:25] here I don't know where people get this
[39:27] idea that we're going to barely make it
[39:28] out by the skin of our teeth I don't
[39:30] know where people get this idea that
[39:31] we're just going to crawl in I'm telling
[39:33] you we're going to march out of here
[39:35] victorious with the enemy under our feet
[39:37] singing onward Christian soldiers going
[39:39] after war we are victorious we will be
[39:42] victorious we were victorious yesterday
[39:44] you were victorious today you're still
[39:47] standing you will be victorious tomorrow
[39:49] we will be victorious over the enemy and
[39:56] yet he's still determined he's
[40:00] determined in this last age more than
[40:02] ever to battle you to fight you to keep
[40:06] you from attaining your promises that's
[40:12] what we're preaching about tonight I
[40:13] forgot to say I always do a stronger win
[40:18] than this a stronger win than this Satan
[40:25] is going to challenge your church he
[40:27] challenged Jesus he challenged the
[40:30] Apostles he had challenged brother
[40:33] Branham and now here we are and he's
[40:38] challenging everything that we believe
[40:39] and he's challenging everything that we
[40:42] stand for and he's determined to shake
[40:45] him and his winds blow and his winds
[40:49] blow and he's determined one of these
[40:52] days those roots are going to let loose
[40:53] one of these days if I attack enough if
[40:56] my wins come enough if they swirl enough
[40:58] if they don't see him coming enough I'll
[41:00] break them and his wins below I believe
[41:04] the reason he is so angry Church is that
[41:06] in this scientific age that he is
[41:08] created in this age filled with more
[41:11] unbelief and more doubt than there has
[41:13] ever been on the face of the earth
[41:14] I believe he's so angry because they're
[41:17] still a people that believe I believe
[41:20] he's so angry that they're still a
[41:22] people believing and standing for the
[41:24] supernatural when we live in a world
[41:26] that thinks it's fairy tales when we
[41:28] live in a world that tells you it's not
[41:29] possible you live in a world that tells
[41:31] you if it can't be scientifically proven
[41:33] it's not the
[41:33] truth and there's still a people that
[41:35] ignore all that and something keeps
[41:37] holding them and they keep believing in
[41:38] the supernatural and they keep believing
[41:40] in the power of the third pool and they
[41:42] keep standing there regardless of what
[41:43] the devil sins and it incenses him and
[41:46] it makes him so angry because he has not
[41:48] been able to move you he has not been
[41:50] able to push you over and push you down
[41:52] like he did so many others he's angry
[41:54] that there's a people that stands for
[41:56] all the word and he's angry that there's
[41:58] still people holding on for their
[41:59] promises you mean after all these years
[42:01] he still believes he's going to be
[42:03] healed
[42:03] you mean after all these years he
[42:05] actually believes that that sun's gonna
[42:07] come back well absolutely I believe you
[42:09] dumb old devil because my God has never
[42:10] failed and all I see out of you is lies
[42:12] and all I see out of you as failures and
[42:14] all I see out of you as defeat why would
[42:16] I listen to anything you say yes I will
[42:18] be healed because it's in the word yes
[42:20] my sons coming home because it's in the
[42:21] word yes I'm gonna be delivered because
[42:23] it's in the word that's where I'm
[42:24] standing at that's my rock that's my
[42:26] anchor that's my foundation and he can't
[42:28] stand it and it makes him angry because
[42:30] his winds blew and his winds blow and it
[42:32] doesn't bother me none because I've got
[42:34] a sure foundation and I've got an anchor
[42:36] that holds tonight there's more doubt
[42:41] now than there's ever been and we are
[42:44] currently in an all-out assault on our
[42:46] faith jesus knew it was coming he said
[42:50] when I return will I find faith he knew
[42:53] where the attack would be every aspect
[42:57] of it is being tested every aspect of
[43:00] it's being challenged every aspect of
[43:02] it's being tried and I'm just telling
[43:05] you now if you're not there already the
[43:08] storms coming I'm just telling you if
[43:11] you're not there already the wind is
[43:12] coming and you better be anchored and
[43:16] you better be anchored on the solid rock
[43:18] you can't be anchored where you want to
[43:20] be anchored you can't be anchored on
[43:21] your ideas and you can't be anchored on
[43:23] Mama's ideas or even pastor's ideas and
[43:25] no matter how good those people may be
[43:27] you better be anchored in a solid
[43:29] revelation of who Jesus Christ is to you
[43:30] that he saved you and he's your savior
[43:33] and he gave you the baptism of the Holy
[43:34] Ghost
[43:35] you got to have your own anchor in this
[43:37] time because the storms
[43:39] are coming you better be built on the
[43:41] rock in these days because the devil is
[43:43] tacking in many different ways and means
[43:45] house we don't see it coming and he's
[43:46] trying to get us as a church yes as a
[43:50] worldwide body sure but I'm talking to
[43:52] you tonight as a church he's trying to
[43:54] get us to back up and he's trying to get
[43:56] us to back off with the things we claim
[43:58] to believe and he's trying to get us to
[44:00] back off we preached a third poole
[44:02] message full of power we've preached the
[44:04] third poole message that will change a
[44:06] life we have preached a message that
[44:08] will produce miracles we have preached a
[44:09] message that will cure cancer we have
[44:11] preached a message that will cure brain
[44:13] bleeds and he wants us to back up he
[44:15] wants us to back off of it and say well
[44:17] maybe it's just not like it used to be
[44:18] maybe we don't have the power that we
[44:20] you think we have or that used to be
[44:22] here when the Prophet was here I will
[44:24] not back off of one promise of God I
[44:26] will not back up for one minute for
[44:28] anything that I find in this Bible
[44:30] because it's mine it's mine to hold on
[44:32] to it will save me it will deliver me it
[44:34] will hold me it will keep me in the word
[44:36] says I will never be ashamed so it
[44:39] doesn't matter if I pray for a thousand
[44:41] and they all die tomorrow my gods are
[44:42] healer
[44:43] my god is a deliverer I will never be
[44:45] ashamed his promises are true they're
[44:47] yeah and they are amen
[44:51] he wants us to back up off of that he
[44:56] wants us to back up and settle for
[44:57] something just a little bit less charge
[45:03] has been welling up within me he started
[45:08] on Friday morning and the day after
[45:10] sister Karen's brain bleed brother
[45:15] Philip and I on several others were in
[45:16] Branson Missouri and we were in the
[45:19] hotel and brother Phillip was voicing
[45:21] his displeasure with the devil about his
[45:26] most recent attack on sister Karen and
[45:30] he said it feels like the devil is just
[45:32] trying to mock us because we've
[45:36] testified we've testified yet he comes
[45:39] back again look he'll do it that's what
[45:42] he does he's not just gonna go away well
[45:44] it didn't work once I guess I'll leave
[45:45] him alone now you can be healed today
[45:48] and attack again the same thing tomorrow
[45:51] but I knew what he was saying I was in
[45:53] agreeance with he said it feels like the
[45:54] devil is just trying to mock us right
[45:56] now trying to throw things up in our
[45:58] face and things that we just stood for
[46:00] and in that moment it kind of began to
[46:03] rise up in me he don't have enough then
[46:08] brother Timothy and brother Andrew
[46:11] Spencer and I began to talk about it at
[46:12] the cabin while brother ron was here he
[46:16] ain't got enough and I thought about how
[46:20] much Satan hates what we stand for how
[46:23] much he hates our testimonies how much
[46:26] he hates a lighthouse in the middle of
[46:27] darkness a lighthouse proclaiming our
[46:30] Jesus is the same yesterday today and
[46:32] forever a lighthouse proclaiming that
[46:35] our God heals a lighthouse proclaiming
[46:37] that our God delivers a lighthouse
[46:40] proclaiming that God still feels with
[46:42] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and there
[46:45] was something just rising up in me and
[46:46] it's been rising up and the more the
[46:48] storm blows the more it rises up within
[46:49] me if you think for a minute that I'm
[46:52] going to back up on preaching a living
[46:54] God if you think for one minute I'm
[46:57] going to back up on 3:00 on any of God's
[46:59] promises if you think for one minute
[47:01] we're going to back up on preach and
[47:02] divine healing if you think for one
[47:04] minute we're going to back up on
[47:06] preaching the baptism of the holy ghost
[47:07] if you think for one minute we're going
[47:09] to back up on preaching let the baptism
[47:11] of the Holy Ghost will save you and keep
[47:13] you from sin if you think for one minute
[47:16] that we're going to back up on those
[47:17] things if you think I'm going to quit
[47:19] preaching divine healing because you
[47:21] continue to strike down people I love
[47:23] with different sicknesses if you think
[47:25] you're going to get me to back up you've
[47:26] got another thing coming if you think
[47:29] we're gonna back up for one minute
[47:31] you've got another thing coming I want
[47:33] to proclaim to you into the whole world
[47:35] it'll take the stronger win than this to
[47:38] keep me from my promises it'll take a
[47:40] stronger wind
[47:41] this to get me to back up from every
[47:43] word of God he has given us in this day
[47:46] we're not backing up an inch as a
[47:48] strap it on the armor of
[47:50] God and we're going forward come more
[47:52] healing more deliberate more baptisms of
[47:55] the Holy Ghost more overcomers I'm not
[47:58] backing up I'm pushing through I'm
[48:00] walking forward it's gonna take a
[48:02] stronger win then this I'll tell you
[48:11] something personal right here many of
[48:16] you know that I've had some health
[48:18] issues since September 18th when the
[48:21] first attack came I've been tested for
[48:23] everything under the Sun they can't
[48:27] figure out exactly what it is and that's
[48:28] okay I don't have to know what John's
[48:30] name to kill him I don't really care
[48:33] dad doesn't matter to me Satan is
[48:37] defeated and I am having a complete
[48:40] healing but I had boys to my wife on
[48:45] Sunday or the week leading up to Sunday
[48:48] what was on my heart throughout the week
[48:51] how Satan wasn't enough and how they
[48:54] take a stronger win than this and how
[48:59] his wins would never move me never move
[49:02] us and we were grounded on the solid
[49:05] rock brother Timothy began to go down a
[49:08] certain line Sunday that just really
[49:11] confirmed to me what I was to speak on
[49:13] tonight and I was extremely overjoyed
[49:16] when he began to go down that line and
[49:18] really it put a lot of confidence in my
[49:20] heart and it was just an awesome moment
[49:22] in the sermon and I was excited because
[49:24] it confirmed to me that I was in the
[49:25] right channel for tonight's service I
[49:27] even looked back where my wife was and
[49:29] she didn't hurt and I smiled at her and
[49:31] she smiled at me real big just one of
[49:33] those things you know and no more than
[49:38] God had confirmed to me the devil came
[49:43] right there in that chair with fear and
[49:47] I'll tell you what he said he said don't
[49:51] you think
[49:53] I have stronger winds to send don't you
[50:00] think I have stronger winds once again
[50:06] let me say King we will not bow let your
[50:13] fury rage heat the furnace seven times
[50:16] hotter let your strong men bind me
[50:19] whatever but we're not gonna bend we're
[50:22] not gonna bow we're not gonna give in to
[50:24] your fear tackett's we're not backing up
[50:26] you can take me up to the fiery furnace
[50:28] that's fine my god is willing and my god
[50:30] is able to deliver what you can't see is
[50:32] that big bad fiery furnace may look
[50:34] scary but there's a fourth man on the
[50:36] way from me there's a fourth man in the
[50:38] fire from me there's a fourth man here
[50:39] tonight and he's fighting your battles
[50:41] and he's overcoming your fears and he's
[50:43] casting out the devil out of your life
[50:45] say ten
[50:46] it'll take a stronger win than this
[50:48] because even like Tabernacle is not
[50:50] backing up we have set our sons our
[50:53] sights on the goal we know where we're
[50:55] going we know what we've come through we
[50:57] know what you carry this through and
[50:58] you're not gonna stop us now some of us
[51:01] have been through the hardest heartaches
[51:03] we can go through but guess what stage
[51:05] it we're still here you told some of us
[51:08] we'd be gone 15 years ago ten years ago
[51:10] five years ago say ten we're still here
[51:14] and we're not going anywhere until the
[51:16] Lord calls us home we're not backing up
[51:19] or taking a step back until he takes us
[51:22] in a rapture
[51:32] whether Brown says when you see the real
[51:34] true principles of the gospel of the
[51:36] Lord Jesus Christ when you see our
[51:38] foundation is sure and solid all Devils
[51:41] out of hell can't upset the foundation
[51:43] of God upon this rock I'll build my
[51:46] church and the gates of Hell can't
[51:47] prevail against it it'll be against it
[51:50] sure will but it will never prevail
[51:53] God's foundation stands sure Amen now
[51:59] many times
[52:00] Satan's wind can come in many different
[52:02] forms I'm gonna go through some of this
[52:03] quickly just because we all deal with
[52:06] winds in a different way we have
[52:08] different attacks so my attacks not the
[52:09] same as the attack you may face many
[52:12] times it may come in the form of
[52:13] sickness maybe a form of depression or
[52:15] something like that and when that comes
[52:18] we must be sure to understand as
[52:20] Christians that those things come from
[52:23] the devil get that right now clear set
[52:28] in stone sickness is of the devil
[52:31] depression is of the devil those things
[52:35] are not from Almighty God many times we
[52:38] want to place it on God and we think
[52:40] we're being punished for some
[52:42] shortcoming or some failure and as long
[52:45] as we're thinking that way those winds
[52:47] will blow us all over the place those
[52:49] winds will move us in every direction
[52:51] and we won't be able to stand firm but
[52:53] brother Branham said let's take the
[52:54] profit job now that man went through a
[52:56] test but he knowed that God required a
[52:59] burnt offering that's what God required
[53:01] and that's all he required and no matter
[53:04] how much disaster happened to his home
[53:06] when you see something going wrong for a
[53:08] fellow that don't mean that he's being
[53:10] whipped by God it might not be that he's
[53:13] out of the will of God he knows in his
[53:15] heart whether he's listening to the
[53:16] trumpet or not God required to burn
[53:19] offering and Jobe stood right on it
[53:21] that's all they said Jobe you're a
[53:23] secret sinner you're doing something
[53:25] that's wrong but he knowed better he
[53:29] says he knowed it was the devil and as
[53:31] long as Satan can make him believe that
[53:33] his sickness was his God doing it he had
[53:37] Jobe whipped but when Joe once struck
[53:41] that revelation that it was not God he
[53:44] was only going through
[53:45] trial to make him something it wasn't
[53:47] God doing it it was Satan
[53:50] doing it listen when you realize it's
[53:52] the enemy doing it when you realize who
[53:54] it is you can stand right there on the
[53:56] Word of God and defeat the enemy but as
[53:59] long as you think it's coming from God
[54:00] you can't have big confidence in his
[54:02] word and you can't get to the place
[54:04] where you realize that you've been
[54:05] justified and sanctified by his
[54:07] sacrifice you can't see past your faults
[54:09] and you can't see past your failures and
[54:11] you're seeing everything through through
[54:13] a glass you're seeing everything through
[54:14] a filter of your failures and your
[54:16] faults and the devil will completely
[54:18] defeat you right there but when you
[54:20] realize that the price has been paid
[54:21] when you realize that this is not God's
[54:24] punishment when you realize that this
[54:26] sickness has already been defeated
[54:27] that's when you can begin to come out of
[54:29] the thing he says it doesn't make you an
[54:32] unbeliever when things befall you the
[54:35] devil will the devil will hold that over
[54:37] people and he'll make them believe that
[54:39] they've done something wrong and he'll
[54:40] begin to accuse you brother Brown says
[54:43] cloudy skies and storms of life are no
[54:45] signs of God's disapproval cloudy skies
[54:50] and storms of life are no sign of God's
[54:53] disapproval listen we absolutely do
[54:56] believe in the law of sowing and reaping
[54:58] we understand that we understand that
[55:01] sometimes our disobedience or maybe our
[55:03] stubbornness can lead to a situation or
[55:06] even an affliction that God can use to
[55:08] bring us back to where he warned us to
[55:10] begin with he can use these things to
[55:13] make us lean more on him to trust him
[55:16] more there are things you can learn
[55:19] through affliction absolutely all right
[55:22] but make no mistake about it trials come
[55:24] to everyman and sickness attacks every
[55:29] home and we must move beyond the thought
[55:32] that this is a punishment from God we
[55:34] must move beyond the thought that that
[55:36] were sick because of something that we
[55:38] did in our past we must move beyond the
[55:40] Putt thought that this sickness is there
[55:42] for us to show our humility for us to
[55:44] suffer with the Lord or for us to show
[55:47] patience brother Brown said that people
[55:49] teach that to excuse their unbelief he
[55:53] said people teach those things to it
[55:56] excuse their unbelief instead we must
[55:58] preach a resurrected Lord we must preach
[56:00] a Jesus Christ that saves we must preach
[56:02] a Jesus Christ that heals we must preach
[56:04] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[56:06] today and forever
[56:07] who will do the miraculous for you in
[56:09] the moment where it seems impossible
[56:11] it's the third pool anointing it's the
[56:13] Eagle anointing right when you think
[56:15] you're going down it will snatch you up
[56:16] out of the flames it will snatch you out
[56:18] of this generation it'll snatch you out
[56:20] of the sickness it'll snap you out of
[56:22] whatever position the devil has placed
[56:24] you in because it's not from God
[56:26] [Music]
[56:33] it's nonsense that we have to suffer for
[56:37] Glatt God's glory
[56:40] sometimes these winds will come through
[56:42] people I would hang it up like these
[56:54] other guys who did just be all out in
[56:56] the floor anyways sometimes people are
[57:01] so quick to play the role of jobs
[57:04] comforters ultimate so quick to place
[57:08] the blame of someone's situation on the
[57:11] person that's going through the
[57:12] situation so quick to point fingers
[57:15] wondering and even voicing this maybe
[57:17] there was some secret sinning that had
[57:19] been going on or sins that have been
[57:20] committed but you must be careful when
[57:23] you get to this place I find that odd
[57:26] how so many times we're more concerned
[57:27] with other people's sins than we are our
[57:29] own but we must be careful when we get
[57:32] to this place because when you begin to
[57:33] accuse someone especially a Christian
[57:35] what you're doing is you're placing
[57:36] yourself on this side of the accuser of
[57:38] the Brethren and that's not the side
[57:42] that you want to be standing that's the
[57:43] defeated side that's the losing side
[57:45] that's the cast down side it's our job
[57:48] to lend a helping hand a hand to support
[57:50] a hand of Prayer to lift the person up
[57:52] not to point a finger at them the Bible
[57:55] tells us in Romans 8:33 who shall lay
[57:57] anything to the charge of God's elect it
[58:00] is God that justified
[58:02] so we want to be careful when someone's
[58:04] going through these things if anything
[58:05] we should have learned from Jobe that
[58:07] the people that suffer that suffers the
[58:09] most aren't always the ones who sin the
[58:11] most that's something that you can take
[58:13] away took that but even the Apostles
[58:15] would ask this question when they came
[58:17] upon the blind man they said whose sin
[58:19] caused this man to be blind Jesus
[58:22] answers in John nine and three neither
[58:25] hath this man sinned nor his parents but
[58:28] that the works of God should be made
[58:29] manifest in him the works of God made
[58:34] manifest in him listen the sickness did
[58:36] not bring any glory to God that's where
[58:40] we get confused the sickness brought no
[58:42] glory to God the sickness didn't
[58:44] manifest God's glory the healing brought
[58:48] glory to God
[58:49] it was the victory that brought glory to
[58:51] God it was the overcoming that brought
[58:53] glory to God the glory comes when the
[58:56] giant head is taken off that's like
[58:58] saying we got to sit here and listen to
[59:00] glass for 40 days to bring glory to God
[59:02] that makes zero sense the glory comes in
[59:08] the victory the glory comes in the
[59:09] healing listen you will bring no glory
[59:11] to God in your suffering but you will
[59:13] bring glory to God in your victory you
[59:16] will bring glory to God and your
[59:17] deliverance you will bring glory to God
[59:20] when that sickness is under your feet
[59:22] and many times they don't take other
[59:28] people to play that role sometimes
[59:29] people play the accuser of themselves
[59:31] themselves well this is happening
[59:37] because God's punishing me because I've
[59:38] displeased God listen quit talking the
[59:41] devil's language quit speaking his
[59:43] language rise up and speak the words of
[59:46] God rise up and say what the word says
[59:48] Jesus paid the price my past is forgiven
[59:51] my sins are washed away by His stripes
[59:53] I'm healed quit speaking the devil's
[59:55] language and began to speak the language
[59:56] of victory he has no right to my mind he
[59:59] has no right to my body there is no
[1:00:01] reason that I should be going through
[1:00:02] this other than the fact that he's the
[1:00:04] devil he is a tormentor and I rebuke him
[1:00:06] in the name of Jesus Christ by His
[1:00:08] stripes I am healed don't allow the wind
[1:00:13] of the enemy to back you off
[1:00:15] who you are don't allow the words of the
[1:00:17] enemy to back you up for a minute off of
[1:00:19] what the word says you are the word says
[1:00:22] you're a son of God the word says you're
[1:00:24] justified and sanctified so don't listen
[1:00:26] to him saying you messed up you did this
[1:00:28] wrong maybe I did in my past life but
[1:00:30] that's not who I am because I've come
[1:00:32] through the blood I've come through the
[1:00:34] sanctification and the justification
[1:00:36] I've been there I've been under the
[1:00:38] sacrifice and because of that I can
[1:00:40] stand on the rock tonight and your wind
[1:00:43] will not move me that's one thing his
[1:00:50] wins are no match for our anchor when
[1:00:54] you're standing on the rock you can
[1:00:55] stand in confidence brother Branham says
[1:00:58] but if you really base your faith on
[1:01:00] God's eternal Word and it's down in your
[1:01:02] heart all devils if you'll notice every
[1:01:06] quote I read tonight I'll have the word
[1:01:07] all Devils in it all Devils out of
[1:01:11] torment can't upset you no sir you've
[1:01:14] got to stay there I know what I speak of
[1:01:16] because I've seen it and I put it to the
[1:01:18] test myself and I know that it's true
[1:01:22] see God's Word is eternal and unchanging
[1:01:25] but that doesn't matter if your faith
[1:01:28] isn't anchored in it his word is eternal
[1:01:32] and unchanging and that our faith in
[1:01:33] that unchanging word must be sure and
[1:01:36] steadfast but along the way Satan brings
[1:01:39] every type of unbelief and every kind of
[1:01:41] doctrine that there is to move you off
[1:01:43] of your god-given property to move you
[1:01:47] all for your promises brother Branham
[1:01:49] would call these doctrines and these
[1:01:50] things Giants he would refer to him over
[1:01:54] and over again as Giants and he says I
[1:01:55] don't care how much reasoning how much
[1:01:59] reasoning in it if it's against God's
[1:02:02] Word it's against God's Word if an
[1:02:05] intellectual giant come said we don't
[1:02:07] need no Holy Ghost we don't need this
[1:02:10] divine healing I don't care how much
[1:02:12] reasonable it looks like if it's
[1:02:14] contrary to the word God gave the
[1:02:16] promise amen
[1:02:17] they say that was just for the apostles
[1:02:19] I wonder where they get that Peter said
[1:02:23] on the day of Pentecost repent every one
[1:02:24] of you and be baptized in the name of
[1:02:26] Jesus
[1:02:26] Christ for the remission of your sins
[1:02:28] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:02:30] Holy Ghost for the promise is unto you
[1:02:33] and under your children and to them
[1:02:35] that's far off even as many as the Lord
[1:02:37] our God shall call amen
[1:02:38] just for the apostles brother Branham
[1:02:40] says for every one that's called yet
[1:02:43] don't listen to that giant don't listen
[1:02:47] to that giant listen if you're a person
[1:02:50] here tonight younger old and you've been
[1:02:51] wanting the baptism of the Holy Ghost I
[1:02:53] am a witness that it is still available
[1:02:55] for you the Word of God is witness
[1:02:57] enough but just this past week I've seen
[1:02:59] three men filled with the baptism of the
[1:03:01] Holy Ghost in an instant filled with the
[1:03:04] baptism of the Holy Ghost in an instant
[1:03:05] it happened just like that he's still
[1:03:08] here to give it to you he's just waiting
[1:03:10] on you to come and ask for it and accept
[1:03:12] it and receive it don't be listening to
[1:03:15] no intellectual John turn you don't need
[1:03:17] it no more all you got to do is believe
[1:03:18] God sent a prophet all you got to do is
[1:03:20] accept this to accept that no you got to
[1:03:23] be born again just like everybody else
[1:03:25] down through the ages and it's still
[1:03:27] available he's still doing it to this
[1:03:29] day but now more than ever the
[1:03:35] supernatural is doubted the supernatural
[1:03:40] is being questioned and when I say these
[1:03:43] things I'm not talking about in
[1:03:44] denominational churches I'm not talking
[1:03:48] about out on the street the supernatural
[1:03:52] is being pushed out the Holy Ghost
[1:03:55] divine healing deliverances miracles God
[1:04:00] don't do those things no more brother
[1:04:03] Branham said I wonder where they get
[1:04:05] that I wonder where they get that listen
[1:04:10] we can't get all the way down here to
[1:04:12] the closing of time the closing of all
[1:04:14] ages and make the same mistake that all
[1:04:16] generations and other ages behind us
[1:04:18] made we can't get all the way down here
[1:04:21] and go backwards by making the same
[1:04:23] mistake that the Pentecostal
[1:04:24] denominations made by getting off on a
[1:04:27] ditch somewhere and hunkering down on a
[1:04:28] truth and yet leaving the other side of
[1:04:31] truth out of it in other words Pentecost
[1:04:34] error was never was accepting the gifts
[1:04:37] and the supernatural that was not their
[1:04:38] error
[1:04:40] Casas error is that they only accepted
[1:04:43] that their error was that they accepted
[1:04:46] the gifts they accepted the supernatural
[1:04:48] but they did not accept the fullness of
[1:04:49] the word that's the error of Pentecost
[1:04:52] and we would find ourselves in that
[1:04:54] exact same error if we were to say that
[1:04:56] we accept the word we accept the
[1:04:59] fullness of the word and yet we denied
[1:05:01] the gifts and the supernatural that the
[1:05:04] word itself declares should be there you
[1:05:06] will find yourself in the exact same
[1:05:09] place but just on the other side of the
[1:05:10] road in a ditch period or cross the road
[1:05:12] at the other people that have stumbled
[1:05:14] in the ditch along the way it's the same
[1:05:17] error just reversed okay because you say
[1:05:20] we've got the word and those things your
[1:05:22] reminder that's fine you can call them
[1:05:23] what you want I don't find them minor I
[1:05:25] need divine healing
[1:05:27] I need those things but you can call
[1:05:31] them that if you want to the fact of the
[1:05:32] matter is you can't have the major
[1:05:34] unless all the minors are there you
[1:05:37] can't have the fullness of the word and
[1:05:39] leave out the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:05:41] leave out the supernatural leave out the
[1:05:44] gifts leave out the healings you can't
[1:05:46] leave those things out and claim to be
[1:05:48] standing in the fullness of the word
[1:05:50] however that's exactly where we find
[1:05:53] many people that today we find ourselves
[1:05:56] in a time where the supernatural is
[1:05:58] under attack we find ourselves in a time
[1:06:01] where it's looked down upon and have
[1:06:03] people shouting and dancing in the
[1:06:04] church words look down upon to have
[1:06:07] tongues in interpretation they say
[1:06:11] having dreams and vision in the church
[1:06:14] takes away from the profit it takes away
[1:06:17] from the profit for there to be dreams
[1:06:18] and visions in the church actually it
[1:06:21] takes away from scripture further not to
[1:06:23] be
[1:06:26] okay because in Joel 2:28 it says it
[1:06:28] shall come to pass afterward that I will
[1:06:30] pull out my spirit pour out my spirit
[1:06:31] upon all flesh and your sons and your
[1:06:33] daughters shall prophesy your old men
[1:06:35] shall dream dreams and your young men
[1:06:37] shall see visions so there's that it's
[1:06:45] right there in the scripture how can it
[1:06:48] take away if you're fulfilling Scripture
[1:06:51] it cannot take away when it's fulfilling
[1:06:53] Scripture we're living in a time where
[1:06:56] message churches are teaching that you
[1:06:57] can have the Holy Ghost and still commit
[1:06:59] any manner of sin we're in a time where
[1:07:03] people teach just accept God sent a
[1:07:05] prophet and you got it
[1:07:07] here's what these things are winds the
[1:07:17] winds of the enemy blowing it was in
[1:07:20] this age at the beginning of the 1900s
[1:07:23] that God began a move of restoring the
[1:07:26] gifts and he began once again to
[1:07:29] manifest himself through through gifts
[1:07:30] and through the spirit and although that
[1:07:33] we know this wasn't the full restoration
[1:07:35] or the the fullness of restoration we
[1:07:37] know this was the life passing through
[1:07:40] we know that this began to prepare a
[1:07:42] people for the supernatural it was a
[1:07:46] softening rain that would prepare the
[1:07:48] ground for a supernatural message to
[1:07:50] come and then that message came and it
[1:07:54] took us back to the original it took us
[1:07:56] back to Pentecost
[1:07:58] it took us back to the rock that is
[1:08:00] Jesus Christ it wasn't a partial word
[1:08:03] but it was a full word restoration and
[1:08:06] in that word is correct doctrine in that
[1:08:10] word is gifts of the Spirit in that word
[1:08:13] is divine healing in that word is the
[1:08:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost in that word
[1:08:19] is deliverance in that word is
[1:08:22] everything you have need of so take all
[1:08:26] of the word don't take parts of it don't
[1:08:28] try to return us back to some dried
[1:08:30] formal denominationalism that's not
[1:08:33] what's gonna rapture us out of here take
[1:08:35] the whole word eat the book let it
[1:08:37] become you let it lift through you let
[1:08:39] the power of God manifest itself and
[1:08:41] demonstrate itself through your life
[1:08:42] once again we are a people of the book
[1:08:48] as we have heard his brother Tim has
[1:08:50] preached restored to a land of promise
[1:08:53] but the winds of the enemy are blowing
[1:08:55] through the camp church and
[1:08:58] unfortunately it's coming out from Mahon
[1:09:00] message pulpits and it's trying to rob
[1:09:04] the word of its power and it doesn't
[1:09:06] want the supernatural operating in it
[1:09:09] brother Branham says this you say yes
[1:09:12] coming out from message pulpit so those
[1:09:14] are brothers those are but listen to
[1:09:17] this Joseph being a type of Christ born
[1:09:20] to be a seer he saw visions he was hated
[1:09:23] of his brothers loved of his father he
[1:09:26] couldn't help because he saw visions he
[1:09:28] was a spiritual boy God made him that
[1:09:31] way and the father loved him but his
[1:09:33] brothers hated him a type of the church
[1:09:35] today the carnal thinking Christian
[1:09:37] hates the spiritual things hates the
[1:09:40] phenomenal hates the spiritually borned
[1:09:42] again
[1:09:43] hates the move of God hate it without a
[1:09:45] cause that's right
[1:09:47] don't unchristian eyes them but they
[1:09:49] hate always the natural hates the
[1:09:53] supernatural amen he says and the only
[1:09:57] reason they hated him because he was
[1:09:59] spiritual he saw visions and can
[1:10:01] interpret dreams and his brethren they
[1:10:03] were good fundamental people but they
[1:10:06] just couldn't see the supernatural side
[1:10:09] I have the hardest time just as a human
[1:10:13] understanding claiming to believe a
[1:10:16] message that was so supernatural signs
[1:10:22] and miracles start-to-finish signs and
[1:10:27] miracles start to finish
[1:10:28] knowing the berry theme of that message
[1:10:31] was Hebrews 13:8 Church the theme of the
[1:10:35] message Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ is the
[1:10:38] same yesterday today and forever
[1:10:43] and to stand and then and claim that
[1:10:45] message a supernatural message it was
[1:10:48] supernatural signs proclaiming that
[1:10:49] Jesus does not change and then begin to
[1:10:52] drift from that to God don't do those
[1:10:55] things anymore I've said it before
[1:10:59] sometimes you wonder if people are on
[1:11:01] the same page but then sometimes you
[1:11:03] wonder if they're in the same book are
[1:11:07] we reading and believing in experiencing
[1:11:09] the same things are we even standing for
[1:11:12] the same things God doesn't do those
[1:11:15] things anymore it's the exact same giant
[1:11:21] that brother Branham faced night after
[1:11:22] night after night after night as this
[1:11:24] message began to spread across the world
[1:11:26] and night after night in the face of
[1:11:28] skepticism he was willing to stand I
[1:11:31] believe were willing to stand the winds
[1:11:34] didn't shake him because he had been
[1:11:36] commissioned I believe even like
[1:11:38] Tabernacle we've been commissioned the
[1:11:40] winds didn't shake him because he had a
[1:11:42] word from the Lord and night after night
[1:11:43] he would go out there in the face of
[1:11:45] skeptics in the face of unbelievers in
[1:11:47] the face of people that wanted him to
[1:11:49] fail and shut the mouths of the skeptics
[1:11:52] because time after time after time God
[1:11:54] would come and back up his word time
[1:11:56] after time he would come down and prove
[1:11:58] I am the same as I was yesterday
[1:12:00] I do those miracles I do heal I do
[1:12:02] deliver I do set the captive free every
[1:12:05] single night brother Brown says in here
[1:12:08] he when he's talking about David just a
[1:12:11] dancing in the spirit as hard as he
[1:12:13] could why my faith he saw the victory
[1:12:15] amen he saw the victory he took his
[1:12:18] little old sling in there and one of
[1:12:19] these stones and he give it a dance and
[1:12:22] here he comes coming around
[1:12:23] oh I see Goliath saying hohoho what was
[1:12:27] it he had five stones f8i eh in five
[1:12:31] fingers wrapped around his string around
[1:12:33] j esus here he comes oh brother look out
[1:12:36] Goliath you've got to fall and when he
[1:12:39] set that loose the Holy Ghost got ahold
[1:12:41] of that little old stone and he picked
[1:12:43] it up to a speed of about a thousand
[1:12:45] miles per second and he struck that
[1:12:47] giant between the face and he fell
[1:12:49] forward hallelujah oh my and like a
[1:12:51] little Jim Crow he danced up
[1:12:53] there he jumped up on him he pulled his
[1:12:55] sword out he chopped his head off like
[1:12:57] that and he said how do you like that
[1:12:59] boy I like that I'm not sure if that's
[1:13:06] exactly what David said but that's where
[1:13:07] I'm gonna go with I like it it's time
[1:13:09] some of us get out there and we let our
[1:13:11] joy be known some of us going into the
[1:13:13] battle like this but he said he danced
[1:13:17] his way out there he said he did a
[1:13:19] little dance and he went to running and
[1:13:21] when he let it go
[1:13:22] I believe he believed in the power of
[1:13:24] the Holy Ghost because I said the Holy
[1:13:25] Ghost took that stone and it got to
[1:13:27] going a thousand feet per second and he
[1:13:29] said Goliath you've got a fall and I
[1:13:32] declare today
[1:13:32] jeanny devil of tale that we're trying
[1:13:34] to bind the movement of the spirit that
[1:13:36] would try to bind the baptism of the
[1:13:38] Holy Ghost healings in the name of Jesus
[1:13:40] deliverance in the church you've got a
[1:13:42] fall tonight you can't stand because
[1:13:45] we're not going to let you stand we're
[1:13:46] coming out to meet you in the name of
[1:13:49] the Lord Jesus Christ and he says he
[1:13:52] pulled out his sword and cut off his
[1:13:54] head and said how do you like that boy
[1:13:58] reach down and got him by the hair of
[1:14:00] his head said come on boys let's preach
[1:14:03] divine healing whoa I like that hey look
[1:14:06] bad said come on was who was he talking
[1:14:08] to the ones who were too scared to
[1:14:11] preach it the ones who had stayed in
[1:14:12] their tents the ones who wouldn't meet
[1:14:14] the challenge but he didn't forget them
[1:14:18] like brother Bradley didn't creep D
[1:14:20] Christianizing he turn around - come on
[1:14:22] boys you can preach it - you can have to
[1:14:25] promise - let's preach the bond healing
[1:14:28] and he says a way they went hallelujah
[1:14:31] and you know what they done the rest of
[1:14:34] them seen it could be done and they cut
[1:14:37] Philistines palm to the wall glory down
[1:14:39] there the old critics has got to shut
[1:14:42] their mouths well if you didn't like
[1:14:47] that you got a problem with the prophet
[1:14:49] not me he said the old critics has got
[1:14:53] to shut their mouths now what did they
[1:14:56] see they saw somebody who was willing to
[1:15:00] stand
[1:15:01] they saw somebody who the winds of Gilad
[1:15:04] slides and his doctrines didn't move
[1:15:06] down they saw somebody who said this
[1:15:09] wind will not move me I will preach
[1:15:11] healing in the face of sickness I will
[1:15:14] preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost in
[1:15:16] the face of intellectualism and a way
[1:15:19] they went because somebody was willing
[1:15:21] to stand even in light Tamra knock well
[1:15:23] I know these men on the platform are
[1:15:25] willing to stand and I believe he Chand
[1:15:26] every one of you are willing to stand
[1:15:28] and say these doctrines will not move me
[1:15:30] this wind will not move me we believe in
[1:15:32] the power of the Holy Ghost we believe
[1:15:34] in the moving of the Spirit we believe
[1:15:36] in miracles and signs and wonders
[1:15:38] because it's in the word we're going to
[1:15:40] stand on it and we will have them like
[1:15:49] David I'm not meaning to criticize I'm
[1:15:52] saying brother quit listening to that
[1:15:54] giant that says you can't have it
[1:15:57] because you can have it I'm saying
[1:16:00] square up your shoulders tonight I'm
[1:16:03] saying quit listening to the
[1:16:04] intellectual Giants drive back your wins
[1:16:06] of doubt quit making excuses for why you
[1:16:09] don't have the supernatural and come on
[1:16:11] down here in the valley where we're
[1:16:12] fighting that come on down here and get
[1:16:15] you a piece of this right here because
[1:16:16] once you get a taste of it there's no
[1:16:18] going back once you get a taste of
[1:16:20] killing a Philistine there's no going
[1:16:22] back once you've seen one person set
[1:16:23] free you're not going to say he don't do
[1:16:25] that no more you're gonna love seeing
[1:16:26] the power of God move and you're gonna
[1:16:28] say he can do it for that one he'll do
[1:16:29] it for this one he did it for your house
[1:16:31] he'll do it from my house he did it for
[1:16:32] your house he'll come to my house get
[1:16:34] yourself a taste of it come down in the
[1:16:36] valley one time and realize you can do
[1:16:38] the greater works we need the day of
[1:16:46] old-fashioned God sent st. Paul's
[1:16:48] revival on the Bible Holy Ghost then a
[1:16:52] lot of this old ticker Chalker halfway
[1:16:55] formal religion broke up and Jesus
[1:16:58] Christ needs to be preached in the power
[1:17:00] of his resurrection where signs and
[1:17:03] wonders and miracles can take place
[1:17:05] again in the church before the end time
[1:17:08] it's the best part and we are going to
[1:17:11] have it
[1:17:12] you get that all devil
[1:17:14] out of hell can't stop it for God said
[1:17:17] it would be here it's going to be here
[1:17:19] sure is the wind wants us to back off
[1:17:23] the supernatural but I hear a prophet
[1:17:24] saying we can have it I hear a prophet
[1:17:26] saying all Devils in Hell can't stop us
[1:17:28] from having it I hear it proper to say
[1:17:30] it'll be here and I say Lord be it unto
[1:17:31] me let it be here in my life let it be
[1:17:34] here in your life let it be in your home
[1:17:36] let it be in our church services I'm not
[1:17:38] backing up I will have it he's trying to
[1:17:49] get you to back up
[1:17:51] it sure is a strong wind it blows hard
[1:17:55] but the scripture said we're troubled on
[1:17:56] every side yet not distressed we are
[1:18:00] perplexed but not in despair we are
[1:18:02] persecuted but not forsaken cast down
[1:18:05] but not destroyed it's going to take a
[1:18:09] stronger wind than this I believe that
[1:18:13] we're a people willing to look beyond
[1:18:15] what we see of people that still believe
[1:18:19] in the miraculous 1/3 pool people
[1:18:22] willing to look into the supernatural
[1:18:25] Satan does not want you to recognize the
[1:18:29] supernatural he doesn't want you to see
[1:18:33] that Jesus is the same today because
[1:18:36] there's something that happens to you as
[1:18:38] an individual once you contact the
[1:18:40] supernatural once you realize that it's
[1:18:44] operating in your myths and it's
[1:18:45] something that you can't be shook from
[1:18:47] but the brown was in a prayer line and
[1:18:49] there's a girl there in a wheelchair and
[1:18:51] he goes through several amazing
[1:18:54] discernments where he's dealing with
[1:18:56] people and and I'm not gonna read them
[1:18:58] because they're long but they're just
[1:18:59] incredible so detailed and one lady gets
[1:19:02] her hearing back and then another
[1:19:04] brother receives his healing after this
[1:19:06] long discernment and brother Branham
[1:19:08] says and I turned around and I was I did
[1:19:09] I seen that crippled girl sitting in
[1:19:10] that chair just as plain as I'm looking
[1:19:12] at this gentleman gentleman sitting here
[1:19:14] rise up out of that chair rise up out of
[1:19:17] that chair only she was dressed
[1:19:19] different than what she was sitting
[1:19:20] there and she went walking down the
[1:19:22] aisle it looked like just the waving her
[1:19:25] hands like that and saying thank God
[1:19:26] thank God
[1:19:27] watched her till it faded out and I
[1:19:29] turned back around I said sister dear
[1:19:31] and he says old friends you'll never
[1:19:34] know how it feels to know when you know
[1:19:38] where you're standing
[1:19:39] there's nothing all demons out of
[1:19:42] torment can't stop it then no sir I've
[1:19:46] seen when doctors were standing at the
[1:19:48] bed and say he can't come in
[1:19:49] that's fanaticism well we can't let that
[1:19:51] in here I said well you step aside and
[1:19:53] just watch the patient for a few minutes
[1:19:55] mom when you watch them perfectly normal
[1:19:59] in just a few minutes it's never failed
[1:20:00] God is my judge and I looked at that
[1:20:03] little girl I said sister Jesus Christ
[1:20:05] the Son of God has heard your prayers
[1:20:06] and healed you stand in your feet no
[1:20:09] nowhere she never made it to brother
[1:20:10] Brandon he turns and he points her and
[1:20:13] he says your prayers has healed you
[1:20:16] stand on your feet and that girl hadn't
[1:20:18] walked since she was eight years old
[1:20:20] and up she got out of that wheelchair
[1:20:21] and there she stood brother Richie
[1:20:23] you were standing there there she went
[1:20:26] through the building glorifying God they
[1:20:27] moved the wheelchair back the glory of
[1:20:29] God swept over the building everywhere
[1:20:31] and the people begin to rise and throw
[1:20:33] their crutches and canes and walking
[1:20:34] what is it that doesn't heal people to
[1:20:38] tell you what's wrong with you now
[1:20:40] listen here's why Satan wants to keep
[1:20:42] you away from it
[1:20:43] to keep you from recognizing it's in our
[1:20:46] midst he said that doesn't heal you to
[1:20:48] tell you what's wrong with you but
[1:20:50] here's what it does friends it brings
[1:20:52] the realization of the supernatural God
[1:20:56] working in our midst just exactly Satan
[1:21:02] doesn't want you to recognize there
[1:21:04] still a supernatural God here in our
[1:21:07] midst because even the realization that
[1:21:10] he's here there the revelation that he's
[1:21:12] in the service the recognition that I
[1:21:15] can go free right now when you get that
[1:21:18] revelation that he's here the King of
[1:21:20] Kings is in this building right now he's
[1:21:22] right next to me and he wants to meet my
[1:21:24] name and he's still supernatural and he
[1:21:26] can heal me he can save me he can bring
[1:21:28] my loved one in tonight when you get
[1:21:30] that revelation it's over it's finished
[1:21:33] and he knows he's got to keep you from
[1:21:35] recognizing that so he said God don't do
[1:21:37] that no more
[1:21:38] I'm here to say it's a lie it's a lie he
[1:21:40] does it he still does it
[1:21:42] he doesn't service after service after
[1:21:44] service he moves it home as a home after
[1:21:47] home and we got many standing up across
[1:21:49] this place and say he still does the
[1:21:51] miraculous but he don't want you to
[1:21:54] grasp it because it builds your faith it
[1:22:03] lifts you up see the body change is
[1:22:06] supernatural we can't be looking to a
[1:22:10] body change and looking away from the
[1:22:13] miraculous at the same time if God don't
[1:22:17] move like that now then there is nobody
[1:22:19] change because it's going to take faith
[1:22:22] and it's going to take the miraculous
[1:22:24] and if he doesn't do the miraculous
[1:22:26] anymore we're not going anywhere
[1:22:27] I would tend to classify the rapture as
[1:22:31] a pretty big miracle that's just me I
[1:22:35] tend to classify that as miraculous so
[1:22:39] God must still do the miraculous he must
[1:22:43] still move in that way and so Satan
[1:22:44] constantly attacks the supernatural but
[1:22:47] there is somebody God's always got
[1:22:49] somebody there is somebody that's gonna
[1:22:52] stand for it there is somebody who's
[1:22:54] going to say he's the same yesterday
[1:22:55] today and forever listen this message
[1:22:58] came with power and demonstration this
[1:23:01] message came healing all manner of
[1:23:02] sickness
[1:23:03] it came delivering all kinds of demonic
[1:23:05] oppression it came in power and
[1:23:08] demonstration it started with the divine
[1:23:10] healing moving and now here we are in
[1:23:12] the midst of a world bound by sickness
[1:23:15] think about that for just a second the
[1:23:19] entire world bound by sickness on the
[1:23:24] hills of God sin and divine healing
[1:23:26] moving in
[1:23:26] that came out of that and Satan's trying
[1:23:29] to mock you she'll believe in divine
[1:23:31] heal I've shut this whole world down
[1:23:33] with sickness with with a little virus
[1:23:37] I've shut the world and you believe in
[1:23:39] the supernatural you believe in the
[1:23:41] power of God to heal any monks and he
[1:23:46] mocks the power of God and he's
[1:23:50] determined to mock you and mock his
[1:23:52] power and what he can do and what you
[1:23:53] say you believe but what I want to ask
[1:23:55] you right now is what is your ear tuned
[1:23:57] to is your ear tuned to the sickness or
[1:24:00] is it tuned to the supernatural is your
[1:24:05] ear tuned to the word or is your ear
[1:24:07] tuned to the doctor that told brother
[1:24:09] Ron he only had four months to live by
[1:24:12] the way we've passed that point as a
[1:24:14] matter of fact he ran out of all his his
[1:24:16] chemo medications is that is that right
[1:24:17] I heard I was told he run out of his
[1:24:19] chemo medications because they only gave
[1:24:21] him three months worth so when he
[1:24:23] reapplied for his grant to get more they
[1:24:27] said well the reason we only gave you
[1:24:28] three months worth is because nobody
[1:24:30] ever lives past that point as our I ear
[1:24:35] tuned to the sickness or is it tuned to
[1:24:38] the supernatural is our ear tuned to the
[1:24:41] sickness is our ear tuned to the doctor
[1:24:43] tell him brother Joe sister Karen may
[1:24:45] live five more minutes
[1:24:46] or is it tuned to the fact that today
[1:24:48] she got up and walked to the sink and
[1:24:50] brushed your teeth what's it to - is
[1:24:54] your ear tuned to the doctor's report
[1:24:57] that told brother Tim prepare for death
[1:24:59] do you even want us to attempt this
[1:25:01] surgery or is it tuned to the fact that
[1:25:03] she's sitting up for hours at a time and
[1:25:05] joking and laughing and telling them I
[1:25:07] want to get out of here
[1:25:08] what is your ear tuned to because that's
[1:25:11] what you will see what your eyes own is
[1:25:14] what you're going to see what you're
[1:25:15] listening to is what you're going to see

[1:25:28] that he's moving in our midst
[1:25:30] the realization taking place that he's

[1:28:17] there's nothing can shake you we receive
[1:28:19] a kingdom that cannot be moved what I
[1:28:24] keep hearing is he doesn't have enough
[1:28:27] Satan doesn't have enough he keeps
[1:28:31] saying all devils oh that means every
[1:28:34] last one he's got all Devils can't shake
[1:28:37] you all Devils can't move him if all
[1:28:41] Devils can't stop you and if all Devils
[1:28:44] can't shake you then it means he doesn't
[1:28:46] have enough to defeat you in it doesn't
[1:28:49] matter if you're a new Christian you say
[1:28:51] I just got saved I hadn't even been
[1:28:53] saved long David was in the army five
[1:28:56] minutes before he killed Goliath he just
[1:29:00] signed up five minutes and he killed
[1:29:05] Goliath firm his foundation was firm you
[1:29:08] say I'm a failure I felt Christ all the
[1:29:11] time it doesn't matter if you're a
[1:29:12] Christian that's fill time after time
[1:29:14] after time and you've allowed the enemy
[1:29:18] to come in time after time and rob you
[1:29:20] again and again they rob Shamgar every
[1:29:22] single year Shamgar sambhar got in the
[1:29:26] bible for being a hero
[1:29:28] being a judge and he was a failure most
[1:29:32] of his life to the point that the the
[1:29:35] Philistines knew that's an easy place to
[1:29:37] go get stuff that's an easy place to rob
[1:29:39] a victory that home right there I can
[1:29:41] bring anxiety anytime I want I can bring
[1:29:44] depression there anytime I want I can
[1:29:45] stir that family up so quick we can go
[1:29:48] there in a heartbeat and steal their joy
[1:29:50] we can show up there Shamgar was a
[1:29:53] failure every single year but not this
[1:29:57] day
[1:29:59] not this day brother Branham says this
[1:30:02] is one of my favorite quotes I love this
[1:30:03] quote about Shamgar he says Shamgar said
[1:30:06] I'm sick and tired of there's any of you
[1:30:07] sick and tired of the winds of the enemy
[1:30:09] tonight let this be you tonight he says
[1:30:11] I'm not a warrior the odds is against me
[1:30:13] no matter how much the odds is against
[1:30:15] you though God's for you if you take his
[1:30:17] word he said there's one thing I know
[1:30:19] I'm circumcised I'm an Israelite that is
[1:30:22] an uncircumcised philistine I know I'm
[1:30:25] right
[1:30:26] I'm a child of God tonight and I know
[1:30:28] disease comes from the devil and I know
[1:30:30] God promised me victory whoa brother I
[1:30:32] wish you felt like I felt right now yes
[1:30:35] sir I feel awfully good look it's my
[1:30:37] god-given privilege yes sir I'm still
[1:30:39] tonight in America where I can preach it
[1:30:42] I can enjoy it thanks to the Lord for it
[1:30:44] he said his righteous Ignat day evening
[1:30:46] nation rose he grabbed that ox go he
[1:30:49] jumped through the window he challenged
[1:30:51] six hundred Philistines he stood there
[1:30:53] and beat their heads in I'm gonna read
[1:30:56] that part again because I like it he
[1:30:57] stood there and beat their heads in why
[1:31:00] not a warrior not at all but he was an
[1:31:02] Israelite he was circumcised and then
[1:31:05] tonight if you're circumcised with the
[1:31:07] Holy Ghost you don't have to wait till
[1:31:08] you're trained to be a warrior god bless
[1:31:10] your heart claim your god-given
[1:31:12] privilege and be
[1:31:14] their heads in amen that's right say get
[1:31:17] out of my way Satan kick him out the way
[1:31:19] I'm the god that's taking over now oh I
[1:31:22] like that beat his head in and then tell
[1:31:25] him I'm the god that's taking over now I
[1:31:28] come in Jesus name
[1:31:30] watch him scatter brother when you use
[1:31:32] that faith on him he will back up what
[1:31:36] was different that day it was a day of
[1:31:38] Revelation what was different that day
[1:31:41] it was a day that he remembered who he
[1:31:43] was these are my promises this is my
[1:31:46] healing I'm a seed of Abraham he's an
[1:31:50] uncircumcised philistine
[1:31:52] he remembered who he was in that moment
[1:31:54] and tonight can be your awakening you
[1:31:58] can come to the remembrance of Who I am
[1:32:00] I'm a son of God I'm blood ball I'm
[1:32:03] blood washed and that devil was on my
[1:32:06] property and when the awakening comes
[1:32:08] and your revelation is sure all Devils
[1:32:12] in hell can't move you all devil 600 600
[1:32:17] it went from oh no here comes 600
[1:32:20] Philistines again I look to the only
[1:32:23] sent 600 what happened it went from that
[1:32:29] to what I think I'm some got a joke they
[1:32:34] only sent 600 and he grabs his ox coat
[1:32:39] it out the window he goes and he kicks
[1:32:41] and he fought and he screamed and he
[1:32:43] bashed Devils heads in was it a battle
[1:32:45] sure it was a battle was it easier
[1:32:47] probably wasn't real easy but when the
[1:32:50] killing was done
[1:32:51] Chambord looked around and said ain't
[1:32:54] send enough when the killing was done
[1:32:57] Shambo looked around and said it's going
[1:32:59] to take a stronger win than this for me
[1:33:01] the effort back off my promises ever
[1:33:03] again it's gonna take a stronger winning
[1:33:06] this for me to ever let my family go
[1:33:07] hungry again I'll never let him Rob
[1:33:10] my prayer life again I'll never let him
[1:33:11] Rob the joy out of my home again I'll
[1:33:13] never let him do it they didn't send
[1:33:15] enough and it's going to take a stronger
[1:33:17] wind than this to keep me off those
[1:33:19] promises it's the same mistake he's
[1:33:25] always made Church he didn't send enough
[1:33:28] when he sent bill I he didn't send
[1:33:32] enough when he threw him in the lion's
[1:33:34] den he didn't send enough when they came
[1:33:36] through the Red Sea he didn't send
[1:33:38] enough when the three Hebrew children
[1:33:40] came to the fiery furnace he didn't have
[1:33:42] enough that day on Calvary he didn't
[1:33:45] have enough there at the Nicean council
[1:33:47] he didn't have enough when they tried to
[1:33:49] bullet out of John he didn't have enough
[1:33:51] down through the dark ages somebody
[1:33:53] always stood in the face of certain
[1:33:55] death he didn't have enough to stop the
[1:33:58] message from going forth in this day and
[1:34:00] he doesn't have enough now there's not
[1:34:03] enough cancers there's not enough brain
[1:34:04] bleeds there's not enough Cove is
[1:34:06] there's not enough demons in hell
[1:34:08] there's not enough depression there's
[1:34:10] not enough autoimmune disease there's
[1:34:12] not enough of anything in hell
[1:34:13] to make me back up I'm telling you
[1:34:15] safety you don't have enough it's gonna
[1:34:18] take a stronger wind than this to get me
[1:34:20] to back up it's gonna take a stronger
[1:34:22] wind than this to get even like tavern I
[1:34:24] put a bow down because we ain't gonna do
[1:34:27] it we are not gonna move he is the same
[1:34:30] yesterday today and forever he is my
[1:34:33] healer he is my
[1:34:35] liver he is brother wrong Tina he is
[1:34:38] sister Karen Taylor he's your healer
[1:34:40] tonight and he can deliver you even now
[1:34:42] I know I gotta close I didn't even get
[1:35:04] to it I didn't even get to our one go
[1:35:08] but I'm not gonna tell you about it for
[1:35:09] a second we're talking about a stronger
[1:35:12] wind
[1:35:14] no wonder Satan hates God so much how
[1:35:18] infuriating it must be to give your all
[1:35:20] every single day and never be enough
[1:35:26] that's gotta be pretty frustrating but I
[1:35:30] gave it my all and you failed again
[1:35:32] sorry I gave everything I had yeah same
[1:35:37] as yesterday now go ahead let you know
[1:35:39] it's that's what's gonna happen tomorrow
[1:35:41] he must be so infuriated because God on
[1:35:44] the other hand is always enough what a
[1:35:50] contrast
[1:35:51] Satan is never enough and yet God is
[1:35:57] always enough and that's why we've been
[1:36:01] taught to look to the unseen because
[1:36:04] Satan's winds stir up things up to these
[1:36:06] eyes look instrumental amount of the Red
[1:36:09] Sea looked insurmountable the Lions Den
[1:36:11] looked insurmountable the Assyrians
[1:36:14] looked insurmountable until other days I
[1:36:16] could see into the other realm then you
[1:36:18] realize they ain't got enough it's not
[1:36:21] way more than them they don't have
[1:36:22] enough should've brought more oh that's
[1:36:27] all you got y'all come back later on
[1:36:28] I'll be here all week I'm not going
[1:36:31] anywhere
[1:36:31] that's the message I want to get to the
[1:36:33] devil or not we're not going anywhere
[1:36:35] we're not running we're leaving one day
[1:36:38] but it's not because you told us to
[1:36:40] we're leaving one day but it's when we'd
[1:36:42] conquered you we're leaving one day but
[1:36:44] is when all hail is under our feet
[1:36:46] but until then he's more than enough to
[1:36:49] keep us in this world
[1:36:50] he's more than enough to protect us he's
[1:36:52] more than enough and seeing this world
[1:36:55] the winds come and they said that they
[1:36:57] they scare us but brother branham said
[1:37:00] that that round is more real than this
[1:37:03] round that realm is more real than this
[1:37:08] round and so what I'm telling you is
[1:37:10] that in this realm
[1:37:12] Satan's wind seems scary in this round
[1:37:16] the situation looks bleak but in the
[1:37:19] rounds of the supernatural the rounds
[1:37:23] that matter the most is the enemy that's
[1:37:26] afraid of the winds because there is a
[1:37:30] stronger wind there is a greater wind
[1:37:33] but let me tell you something church
[1:37:35] that's on our side it's not coming
[1:37:38] against us it's the wind of the Holy
[1:37:40] Ghost it's stronger than any wind
[1:37:43] Satan's God it's stronger than anything
[1:37:45] listen there has never been once that a
[1:37:47] devil has been hit by the power of the
[1:37:49] wind of the Holy Ghost that he stood up
[1:37:51] and said it's going to take a stronger
[1:37:52] wind than this matter of fact when the
[1:37:57] Holy Ghost gets ahold of them they don't
[1:37:58] say nothing they are defeated they are
[1:38:00] shut up they are cast out they are
[1:38:02] destroyed they are run out forever
[1:38:04] because they don't have any power
[1:38:06] against this win Satan says looks like
[1:38:09] trouble water up ahead and Satan
[1:38:10] troubles the water and God just makes
[1:38:12] her way through Satan says looks like
[1:38:14] trouble water up ahead and that water
[1:38:16] just draws us closer to God what can his
[1:38:18] wind do that peace be still won't stop
[1:38:22] what can his wind really do in your life
[1:38:25] Satan troubles the water and Jesus just
[1:38:27] comes walking on it but listen with my
[1:38:29] Jesus troubles the water whew no demon
[1:38:32] can walk on that water when his wind
[1:38:34] begins to blow and the waters are
[1:38:36] troubled like they are here tonight
[1:38:37] demons are scattered the hinges of hell
[1:38:39] are shook enemies are defeated people
[1:38:42] are set free
[1:38:43] lose the thickness he'll when my god
[1:38:45] wind begins to blow and the waters begin
[1:38:48] trouble with his presence no demon of
[1:38:50] hell can stand against them I feel a
[1:38:53] change in the wind coming tonight Church
[1:38:55] there's a change in the wind coming the
[1:38:58] winds of hell all around the Israelites
[1:39:00] during the Red Sea and the winds were
[1:39:02] blowing it seemed like certain death but
[1:39:04] there was a change in the winds about to
[1:39:06] come I see one of them old dad standing
[1:39:08] there with his children and I think he
[1:39:10] probably heard it go by he said there's
[1:39:12] a change in the wind children there's a
[1:39:15] change in the wind and the wind
[1:39:16] beginning to blow the Bible says Moses
[1:39:18] stretched out his hand over the sea and
[1:39:20] the Lord caused the sea to go backed by
[1:39:22] a strong east wind all that night and
[1:39:25] made the sea dry land and the waters
[1:39:26] were divided go to chapter 15 thou just
[1:39:30] blow with my wind and the sea covered
[1:39:33] them and they st. has led in the mighty
[1:39:36] waters there was a change in the wind
[1:39:38] that begin to come there's a change in
[1:39:40] the winds in the world we're living in
[1:39:42] because there's a wind coming to destroy
[1:39:44] the enemy there's a wind coming to lift
[1:39:46] us up there was a wind that changed one
[1:39:48] day in the hunt for room when there were
[1:39:50] a hundred and twenty people gathered
[1:39:51] there and down in hell can you imagine
[1:39:53] the social unrest that was going on in
[1:39:55] the world at that time there had to be
[1:39:57] fear than Jesus has been crucified
[1:39:59] they'd seen him raised up and they knew
[1:40:01] all that at the same time the
[1:40:02] government's in my next to be arrested
[1:40:05] in my next what's going on who's against
[1:40:07] us who's for us what's going on and down
[1:40:09] in hell Satan was sitting there with all
[1:40:10] his devils and they thought they were
[1:40:12] triumphant they thought they had won and
[1:40:14] all of a sudden that Devon the quarter
[1:40:16] said Oh what is it
[1:40:19] there's been a change in the winds the
[1:40:22] winds in the upper room had begin to
[1:40:23] blow and a sound from heaven came down
[1:40:25] like a rushing mighty wind and I'm
[1:40:28] telling you from that day forward his
[1:40:30] winds do not matter anymore there's only
[1:40:33] one wind that bothers us or that we know
[1:40:35] that we know - it's the wind of the Lord
[1:40:37] Jesus Christ as he sweeps through this
[1:40:39] place he'll try
[1:40:40] wind at the enemy he'll drive out the
[1:40:42] precious he'll drive out the winds that
[1:40:44] torment you his wins ain't got enough
[1:40:47] when it comes up against the wind but
[1:40:49] the Holy Ghost I'll say Lord Jesus let
[1:40:51] it blow the night let it pour down in my
[1:40:53] soul let it sweep through this building
[1:40:55] Lord let your winds blow all over me
[1:40:58] because I know you're the same I know
[1:41:00] you heal I know you delivered I know you
[1:41:03] do the miraculous we are a third pull
[1:41:06] people and we are going in a rapture
[1:41:08] because we believe in a miraculous God
[1:41:13] on a literally understanding your feet
[1:41:15] with me and give God praise you know
[1:41:18] blessed be the name of the Lord

[1:41:44] you've been seen in the vision and

[1:41:47] Paul was told he was going to wrong
[1:41:50] shipwreck didn't matter

[1:41:54] didn't matter brother branham had a
[1:41:56] vision of the little boy in Finland
[1:41:58] years before it happened and when he
[1:42:00] came to that moment I didn't get to it
[1:42:02] but he tells everybody he says you can
[1:42:03] inline every devil inhale up and they
[1:42:08] couldn't stop it now Paul was going to
[1:42:11] Rome because he'd been seen that boy was
[1:42:14] gonna raise up had been seen you're
[1:42:17] going in a rapture
