all Lord if you come healings can take place deliverances can take place renewing can take place Lord when the King of Kings Lord is Among Us Lord therefore we invite you father and open our hearts to you I ask you to take complete control we commit this service to your hands in Jesus name amen hey man you turn your Bibles to Hebrews chapter 12. amen it's good to be in the house the Lord with you amen was just with the brother being Pruitt there in Hardy Arkansas but that Derek Paris was able to go with me and we were there for the weekend just had a wonderful time there with other men and the Saints there and he sends back greetings to you all today and amen and looking forward to well yeah looking forward to this weekend brother Andrew and Sister Sarah Beth getting married this weekend it's hard to believe that we're here but we're here and so amen we just asked the Lord to be in that this weekend and amen to God it just blessed them as they unite together amen if you could we wouldn't need some help just moving some tables and chairs down to the gym if you would for that would appreciate it Hebrews chapter 12 and verse 2 looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God Amen we'll let you be seated it's like to speak to you tonight on the light the altar amen I'm glad he's the author amen I'm glad he's the writer I I'm thankful he's the composer of life amen because he's a righteous God he's a holy God he's he's got our best interest at heart amen and you know I would hate to know that the devil had the pen and he was able to write and he was able to to make you what he wanted you to be but amen but God is truly the one in control and therefore we can have great confidence today to know that all things are working together for our good you know as the author God is complete is in complete control of Our Lives therefore he knows the beginning he knows the first breath and he knows the last breath he knows how you will begin and he knows how it's all going to end he knows what needs to be in place in our lives to untangle the not of sin that is in us to make us more like him therefore he also has other mem other characters along that'll come alongside of us be there for some time and then be gone later because he is in control he can put people where he wants them to be he can put them in one chapter in another chapter they be taken out but or or he bring this one or that one but either be good or bad but it's all working for our good you know some of these people help us in our journey some of these people hinder us Upon Our Journey but in every moment God provides a way for us to stay on the right path you know God also knows what lies ahead of us he will even allow trials to come in our life that is to make us stronger and ready to face the next chapter amen you know throw in through the whole story the author our God is with us matter of fact he's not as an author if you would write a book you could make a man certain way have certain attributes and you can have certain people in that book but you the author could never become a part of that book it may be your dreams it may be what you think or you know something that you've been dwelling on but God actually in this book became a part of this book as we read here the author and finisher but he also for the joy that was set before him endured the cross so he became part of the story he became part of the book amen despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God Amen so he knows he's not just a bystander or somebody that's can open a cover and close the cover or write it write a few lines and put it down but God has actually put himself in the story amen so he knows what lies ahead of us he knows what we have to go through amen he isn't just watching our story unfold but he is guiding it he is moving along amen and intimately a part of it I'm thankful he's a part of my life and nothing that happens to you ever takes God by surprise amen but God allowed it as an author to be able to come to you in a certain chapter of your life a certain line of your life that God would put things there amen and direct you a certain way and one thing that makes me very happy to know that amen that God the author knows the end he knows exactly the way that we take and we shall come out as pure gold amen I'm sure if authors characters could talk amen they would like to know you know what is going on what is happening why are you putting me through this why why am I going through this you know why why is it like this you know but amen we know the author therefore we can talk to him actually and express ourselves to him and and he lets us know and understand you know even the author of a book he knows what the villains are planning and he knows how to how to work around it he knows how to how to build a character up to be able to uh you know uh to be able to handle a certain situation that would arise Amen to get this author is working everything out to the good of the character that he has placed in that story and therefore God knows also what the devil is planning he knows exactly all of his tricks he knows exactly all of his trials and stumbles that he tries to put in your way therefore God will get you prepared for it in the previous chapter God will bring you to a point in your life to build you up to lift you up amen that when the Devil comes along with his trial or the Devil comes along with his trap you'll be able to go through it or around it or even over it amen this is the kind of God that we serve amen you know these characters you know maybe maybe you find yourself asking yes these characters with no doubt love to ask in a book why am I this why don't you make me this way why do I look like this why is this you know but unlike the author's characters I know the author of my life and he's already written my entire story amen he sees how my life will intersect with the lives of others and how meetings will change us both and each thread of my story God is weaving it together for the ultimate ending amen every one of us is an important part in the story of Life the Story would be incomplete if one of us is absent so when the dark times come know this God knows how it's all going to work out in the end Hallelujah he has a plan and we are every one of us part of it it doesn't matter whether you feel like you're the main character you're this character that character we're all characters in the story of God and every one of us is important as God writes our life and and when he puts the end on the story it'll be a masterpiece that'll leave us all in all and give him all the glory amen what an author that we have what a God Amen this author puts you in this book not to destroy you not to tear you down not to leave you forsaken but he puts you here to bring you to an expected End Amen this author has already got the end in his mind therefore he knows he's already eroded he's already wrote about the Lake of Fire he's already wrote about the devil and his destruction he's already wrote about your Ascension and your change and your glory he's already wrote about all those things and he's bringing about at his expected him amen Psalms 2 and verse 7 would say I would declare a decree the Lord has said unto me thou art my son and this day I have begotten thee or I have authored thee or I have created thee amen and you are my son ain't you glad that he put you in that story not as a thief or a robber somewhere or somebody that was bound for hell and destruction but in this story God put you here as a son now the devil's all going to try to come and destroy that and bring you down and put marks on you but God put you in the beginning as a son and at the end when it says the end you'll still be a son and it doesn't matter what happens all in between God will have the altar he is the author therefore he puts every comma he puts every explanation point he puts every period he puts everything in your life there is nothing that the devil has any kind of control over you amen he can put things he can try he can try to destroy but God has the right to write your life how he wants to write your life what a God we serve Amen brother Brandon would talk about light he said no life what could come outside of light and we know that amen if you turn the sun off today light would cease or life wouldn't cease to exist life light light produces life they're connecting there can be no life outside sort of outside of light natural or spiritual it must be the only light that can come by the word of God God's word is the light when it's manifested nothing can live natural or spiritual without his light and his word is light and life amen when he sends his light he makes it known to the people and then it's rejected then what about that he said that's what we want to talk about this morning is rejected in this life by them saying rejecting it behold us my servant in whom I've delighted in he's alive he's the light of the world and that light brings life amen so we know that the author the light amen it brings life to the body amen and then it controls it how it grows how it comes and how it is amen and everything is working according to how the composer has put it on the script amen when you may think sometimes we're just going to go our own way amen but no you're going to go the way the composer has wrote your life you think well I'm going to do a certain thing I'm going to be a certain way and I'm going to I'm gonna I'm gonna have a certain this or that a certain job certain death amen you can only do as a composer as place it in your life amen you know it ain't about the you know there's the characters don't get mad at the composer they just act out what the composer has given them to act out amen and no matter how simple or how eat little it may seem to you every part of this book of life is important but we see you know in the Symphonies of of life and we see that we are actually in a great composing a symphony of life and there's different things that are sounding Out brother man would talk about it in the Peter and the Wolf the Russian Symphony he said these he said they have these little figures and he's trying to explain it right quick to Children he said they have these little figures flying around playing out playing it on the drums and the drums knock a certain beat then they change and knock another certain bee and make the drums and sounds and things it plays it out it acts that way so you can understand your little children he said but now to you adults the scriptures are God's Symphony Hallelujah only the composer knows what it really means and it reveals it to those who are listening he reveals it to those that are listening who are interested in knowing what the drama is Hallelujah that are interested in knowing what the drama is but you have to know about a symphony first it's not just something to change in this that and the other it seems like a bunch of Racket and a bunch of B but if you wouldn't understand it you wouldn't know what it was just sound like just a bunch of fuss and a bunch of nothing but to those who know what it is they're watching for it they know what's coming [Applause] amen and so we have these times of Symphonies of the Symphony of God's word that whole drama changes you who are interested in listening for the change you know it's getting close you hear the way the drums are beating amen you want something to happen you know this is a change it's going to break out and it's going to burst in a few minutes here Washington watching for it you can tell it because the way the drums are timing amen he said if you can hear the drums of the finish right now Hallelujah if you can hear the echo the music of the Heavenly word singing itself out and it shall come to pass in the last days I shall pour out my spirit upon All Flesh amen what is it it is the drums of the symphony being poured out it is the author writing the story man can try to change the story and they can try to make it a bunch of intellectual ideas and this that and the other but they ain't the author the author said I'm going to pour out my spirit upon All Flesh I'm gonna amen my son shall prophesy and my daughter shall speak in tongues amen I'm going to do this this is the word of the Lord this is the author speaking you know just going through the Bible reading we're listening this morning to the to Joseph as he would come to his brothers and he would you know it was a man that was put in a script and his brothers didn't like the part he was given but it wasn't up to their brothers it was up to God amen he was given a certain part and and it happened to be a favored part it had to be seemed like the father's favor was all on for him and he always got the best clothes and he got the coat of many colors and and he loves him more than and then he loves us and all of this amen they were angry at Joseph not knowing they were really angry at the composer after one who was writing the script and and Joseph would go to bed and he would come back and he said look I had a dream and in this dream there were you we all were gathering weed and we got our sheaves together and every one of your sheaves bowed over to my sheep well what do you mean you're gonna you're gonna bow down to you who do you think you are he was only telling him what the composer was trying to let them know amen and so he finds himself in the bottom of a pit now in Joseph's mind this man not I'm sure it wasn't the way he thought his his story was ever going to end up or be he never thought a favored son would ever be down in a pit out of the favorite song to be back on on the back of a camel with his hands tied heading off to Egypt sold into slavery that wasn't his thought of a good story but the composer was there writing the story and he was putting Joseph in a pit he was putting Joseph on a camel he was putting Joseph in Potiphar's house and it seemed like he was just a slave but the composer was right in his life and it changed it to where he was not just a slave but he was head of Potiphar's house and man this is getting the stores getting better and all of a sudden there's a villain that comes along potterford's wife and starts accusing him of things and next thing you know the composer is wrote him right down into jail and it seems like my goodness what is going on with my life and all of a sudden the composer wrote two more people in jail and he puts them down there amen the wine uh the man that gave the wine to the king and the man who baked the bread and he said and then they they have dreams and and they want to know what it's all about and Joseph's like well this is what it means and he tells them all you're going to live and you're going to die sure that one guy was like man I want to I want a different different dream but there wasn't in Joseph's hands and it wasn't in his hands it was in the composer's hands and he said well I tell you what you that's going to live when you get to Pharaoh you remember me he forgot why did he forget because the composer made him forget amen do you realize every part of our Lives amen the light is directing you whether you're in a pit or whether you're sold down into slavery or whether it seems like all hell is against you the author still has the pen the author still has the ability to write you right out of that situation Hallelujah and one day this author is going to write us right into a body change right into the change of dimensions and Pharaoh has a dream and Pharaoh has his dream of seven good cows and seven skinny cows and the Seven skinny cows eats up the seven good cows and and it goes on and and he's like somebody tell me what this means and you know all of a sudden the composer and the man finally remembered what Joseph had asked him to do in the jailhouse oh there was a guy down in that jail you know why I'm here because there was an I had a dream and he told me exactly and it came to pass exactly like he said he said go get me that man and he brings Joseph until he writes his life all the way to second in command amen all the way to second in Command right under Pharaoh the composer put him there why because there were some children that was over there in the land and the composer had wrote a verse in their life how they was going to be in a Strange Land for 400 years but with a strong and mighty hand I'm going to bring him back out again Hallelujah and so he had a Joseph to go get a land ready for them Hallelujah I go to prepare a place for you that where I am there you may be also because he knew God I will have a people that'll be in the desert out in laodicea and they're going to need a place to go and I'm going to write it down here in my word and I'm going to fulfill it therefore I'm going to prepare for them before they ever get there he's a composer he knows how to write your life amen the Symphony of God's great job Brahman is playing it changes his Symphony at the junction the composer and those that are interested and listening for the change listening for the change not griping at the change listening at the change you know it's very easy right now to gripe about who's in charge hey I'll tell you what that Biden sorry sap sucker Dome is a box of rocks that's true and they got this woman and vice president and this that and the other and look at Russia what they're the composers put them all there the author has put them in power he said Terry lifts kingdoms the Kingdom's up and he tears kingdoms down amen amen just I it just struck me so deeply as I was lit looking at that again about those three wise men brother Brandon said the reason why they were looking for that light he said because hundreds of years before that Daniel had been exiled down there and he began to tell them about things that were to come he began to explain amen there's a messiah coming there's a deliverer coming and God's going to bring great Deliverance back to Israel again and he left Scrolls down there and he left promises down there and he said there were men there to believe those things the composer was writing these things we see way back Yonder not long ago when that church age was being drawn out and he was writing he you know people get disillusioned by the by the the the Israel of how they went to the Holocaust and it looks and it's very terrible been there been through some of the same streets they walked on in the death camps it's not a fun place really to go but I I've seen all that stuff and and it's very easy to get why would God allow this why would God allow men and women to be marched off of trains and separated families separated women children this way men go this way unable bodies go this way well bodies go this way and some go right straight to the Dead the gas Chambers to a very quick death While others would die a month by month by day by day why would God allow that because there was a composer that was writing a story and there had to be something that would drive them put a drive in them to make them want to go back to a Homeland they had it all there in Germany they had it they had the wealth they had they wasn't they wasn't trying there to go find a piece of dirt nice especially out there in Israel nothing but a desert they didn't want none of that they was comfortable where they was at so God the composer said okay I'm going to bring the world system to this point and you're going to be put in this place so something to begin to fall on the inside of you to say I want a Homeland I want a place for my children to grow up and not have to worry about going growing up and going to a death camp I want my children to better grow up and not have to worry about being put in a gas chamber I want a safety for my children I want peace for my children I want to land for my children and brother Adam picked it up and he said that was nothing but the tender hand of Jehovah writing their story so they would get On Eagle's Wings and go to their Homeland [Applause] Hallelujah and he said that ain't gonna be that kind of force it's not going to put us in our homeland no sir amen but he's right in our lives he's bringing it to a certain point amen I don't know about you but you get something some moments of your life it seems oh wow everything's wonderful but them things start dipping down a little bit you're like I'm so sick of this place I don't want no more of this place I want to get out of here what is it is a composer get for all whoo hallelujah it's a Homeland Where Your Children won't ever die it's a Homeland where they won't ever be put in torture chambers and gas chambers that means the life be sucked out ever but God rich and mercy has went to prepare us a place and he's brought us to a place he's bringing us to a body change we've seen the composer in our day the word wrote in the last days in the days of the seventh angel in the church age the seventh angel Masters will be the last message and we saw the composer write it in Revelations 10. in the days of the message of the seventh angel the mystery to God shall be finished the seventh seal would be pulled back it should be there then all at once it's happening a vision breaks go to Tucson a great noise will take place it'll shake the Earth near to all of you know amen it's been there about months before it happened then it happened appeared in the sky shalom it's changing beats a symphony it's moving another notch Hallelujah and one time he said about the third poll how it come by this way and by knowing the heart and then the spoken word Jesus said greater things than this will go will you do for I go to my father The Works that I do shall you do also but greater than this for I go to my father just as I said a while ago when Mary tried to identify him as Joseph's son he corrected her his word cannot fail he said so heavens and earth will fail but my words will not oh Hallelujah that gives us great confidence in this author if he's writing the words they're not going to fail if he said to him that overcometh in the seventh Church age amen there's got that means there's going to be that's a lot of the composure that's put there for a reason to give you faith that somebody is going to overcome this age it's beating the composer begins to beat The Works that I do shall you do also and greater shall you do greater he promised it will be you notice when he performed his first miracle he took water and turned it to wine he took water which potentially someday might be wine but it was water then when he fed five thousand what did he do he took something that had been like water and he took fish that once swam and was born from an egg and he broke it another fish growed into creation that was of the original creation he took bread that was once wheat was once seed and become bread and he broke bread and he bypassed all the bacon and all the growing and he multiplied it just as it was already but in this day he took something that was nothing that was nothing and said let there be squirrels and there was amen greater than these things shall you do for I go unto my father not take something that's been created break something from it but show amen as he said let there be light the world don't understand that it says it's a bunch of nonsense because they're not you know their methodists don't understand it Baptist Catholics Pentecostals but those who wait on the Lord those that are looking for his star not one man that we have in history of any observative deservatory knowing that the star has passed over but the wise man followed it for hundreds of miles for two years they watched it and followed it it is those who are listening to the symphony there's other beats that are taking place right now it's called A World beat and they're they're beating there's a drum being beat right now of Destruction you hear it every day nuclear power talked about more than it's ever been talked about threatened more than it's ever been threatened amen what are they doing they're beating the Drone amen there's a beat that's going on you see men or women that are filing right into this beat and they're getting sucked in to laodicea and Spirits Sodom and gomorrah's spirits and every kind and they're identifying as a cat and a dog and this that and the other come on somebody they are walking to the beat of the world to Satan's Eden but there's also another Rhythm that's going on amen there's a rhythm that the bride is listening to amen there was preview one was walking the rock what marching the rock and roll and one was marching on with Christian Soldiers one was dressed holy in righteousness and one was dressed and barely anything that would cover her amen what was it it was the church world and the Bride of Jesus Christ they each one had a rhythm but one Rhythm was going to hell and the other Rhythm was going to heaven you say well I tell you right now we don't need that rock and roll church music in our church well then what what is rock and roll music go listen to the world God Church world I'm talking about go listen to The Simple Church right over here in Shreveport Louisiana listen to their music you know what their music is New Year's revolution they play in The Beatles music you know what their music is The Gospel According to Michael Jackson this preview of this woman hardly had any resemblance at all just something holy or righteous Godly I know we're so quick to point where I can roll out to different ones in the secular world now that's rock and roll you need to look a little deeper them people actually are still worshiping God to their best of their abilities and the best of their knowledge and wanting to do something for the Lord sure they may have their music beat up and they may do a few things we wouldn't do or many things we wouldn't do amen or we wouldn't play I don't but I'm going to tell you something amen you tell me who inspired the composer inspired somebody to write these are the days of Elijah who inspired that it was the composer because only the composer knew what was on the book Hallelujah it was a composer that that wrote amen How Great Is Our God come sing with me how great is our God it was the composer gifts and colleagues or without repentance because look what the church world is doing now they're going back to Michael Jackson they're going back to the Beatles they're going back to Elvis Presley and it's unbelievable rock and roll remember the composer knows the end from the beginning he knows all about it that's the reason he can write it so you must begin with him you must begin you want to hear a symphony you must begin with him like in the music of the symphony you know what it says is going to be in the symphony you might begin to listen to the music you know here's a certain certain thing takes place and then it's going to change and then it's going to be somebody just walked in would think of just a bunch of noise and rattling going on but those who know what the beat is those who knows what the beat is and the sound of the trumpet and the drum and the whole thing together in the Rhythm it makes the drama too you can close your eyes and live in it he said man could close his mortal eyes to Earthly sight and live in the presence of Jesus Christ when you see his word begin beating out in the great Symphony that we're now living in changing you must begin on the symphony you must begin on the Rhythm you must get in the rhythm of what's going on he said you had to become a part of the dance Amen to get out of the dance you had to become part of the ball game something that you become interested to get in the ball game you have to become part of the word to know God's Symphony to know it's all working together for your good his Symphony is when it's playing you're marching with the beat of the time you're watching for it the works that I do shall you do also and greater than this shall you do is changing of time we get into the beat the beat of the word amen the beat of the word find his purpose find the hour they're living in we're living in and get into the rhythm of it get into the rhythm of his word amen find out what he said find out what he said about dress and get into the rhythm of it find out what he said about church attendance and get into the rhythm of it find out what he said in his word and get into the rhythm of his word it was a rhythm taking place in Jesus day and the beat would change and he would say unless you drink my blood and eat my body you have no part with me it was a there was a beat that changed and there was something that didn't want to go along with that beat and they walked away so this was a hard save a lot of a lot of make-believers walking away they didn't know the symphony but there was one amen as he looked at those others there was around him and said well you also go they looked and said where else are we going to go only you have the words only you have the words to My Life only you have the Rhythm only you have a sympathy sympathy only you are able to put the periods and the commas and put it only you where else could we go come on little bride where else could we go amen where else can we go to find the word beating exactly in order amen we ain't got to tear part of the Bible out and say it's not inspired we believe it's all inspired because the author wrote it and if the author wrote This Book and he was inspired he's inspired on all of it I know something you know in the world think well he wasn't inspired when he wrote you know wrote put in there mark 16. they shall lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover but I remember that little story of that woman who had heard about that you know it's had a sickness and she heard that there was some that would would pray for her and her son went off some Theological Seminary and he was studied on all these things and and he had heard his mom was sick so he comes home and he finds her just sitting there singing and having a good time he's like Mom I thought she was six he said oh I was he said well what happens to him well there was a little church down there on the corner that they said that they believed in Mark 16 and they would come lay hands on the sick and they shall recover and they come in here and they laid hands on me and I got well praise the Lord he said oh Mom in seminary we learned that that wasn't inspired that woman went to shouting went to glorifying God he said Mama you done lost your mind she said well I just got to thinking if God could heal me on some uninspired what could he do with some inspired come on somebody this word is inspired when he said I'm the Lord God that heals all thy diseases it's inspired amen when he said by his stripes I'm Healed it's inspired [Applause] it says they shall lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover don't get mad at me I'm just marching in tune with the symphony [Applause] he's the author man is not the author man tries to come along and change the script but he ain't the one no no they said well this is a hard saying we can't understand it who can understand it we know you're just a man we with you we sleep with you we went in the woods with you we're By the Waters you're merely a man this is a hard saying they didn't know the beat they didn't know the Rhythm that he was God's manifested he was God manifested In the Flesh for he was a Vindicated word light of the hour and they didn't get it said it was a hard thing we notice again there was Judas the unbeliever that always was waiting around till he found enough fault and he turned to the disciples in just the 12 is and Judas was one of them said you want to go too and Peter said where would he go Lord You're the composer you know how it's going on you're the only one that has the word of life where it can we turn to we couldn't go back to being a Pharisee I don't want to be no sad to see or wrote in whatever it might be you're the one who has eternal life we have no other place to go we joined ourselves to this great Symphony we're listening we're in Rhythm we believe that you are the Son of God the Manifest of Jehovah we're sure of this we don't know what these great trials and troubles and afflictions and things you're saying we're going going to be offered up and all this other stuff and on the third day you're gonna we don't know how it's going to be we're just marching along with the symphony because we know you got it in control God has got it God's able more than able in any situation amen amen he said you know in a symphony they have a sheet in their hand he said they're trying to look back to the beaten all portion of it's already been played out he said that's for what other churches do today they're always looking back on the Sheep music he said but we should be here playing our part right now he said that's what Luther is trying to do they try to look back at what amen what Luther did or what Wesley did the Westlands and they want to look back and Pentecost want to look back or we had it back then but what about now the bait's changing the composer changed the script I know man wants to come in and play and say well you know we still got the tapes and we still got this I didn't take him off the scene the composer did but the script has changed the beat has changed and they're missing it amen they missed the beat amen many people ask why why why must these things happen why does this happen to me why did that when I start in this I've had this trouble here this upset me here and I've lost this why he said I used to ask why is a young Minister first started out why did God take my wife right from under me why did he take my baby right out from beneath right beneath my heart why did he do it I don't know I didn't know but I do now I've just held my hand it is and I keep trusting him because he is a composer he knows every Junction he knows every Tyrant he knows every flip of the page he knows every chapter he knows every line he knows where to get you and molds you on the backside of a desert he knows where to get you in a trial amen that certain things can be manifested in your life he is the composer he's the author God knows when the rhythm of us got to change he knows how the Rhythm goes he knows exactly how it would be well I just I it's just I just didn't see it coming many are the afflictions of the righteous hear the beat many are the afflictions of the righteous but God delivers them out of them all elujah God has moved through history with rhythm and he's moved one inner into something and then right out of it he moved he moved David right down into a Goliath deer right down into a valley to fight Goliath but he moved him right out of it Hallelujah he moved Daniel right down into a lion's den but he moved him right out of it he moved three children down into a fiery fire amen buddy he moved him right out of it oh Hallelujah he moved the children of God down through the Dark Ages to where they would give their life and he moved them right out of it Hallelujah don't you think for a moment he's moved you into this place to leave you here and to walk away from the script but he's going to finish the story he's going to finish every line he's going to replace every promise every one of them will be fulfilled he is the author the author can change the script if he wants to change something he can do it he can change the rhythm of Our Lives praise God for that every one of us coming to this world born in sins our heartbeat had a different rhythm it was beaten according to the world and it was heading down a World's Road dancing to a World's tomb headed for Destruction headed for death headed for hell but the altar came down he said Aaron Oglesby was once born in sin and shaped an iniquity but Aaron Oglesby was my son from the beginning Satan take your hands off of that Satan take your hands off of air in Oglesby come on put your name in The Script every one of us was headed down a wrong path every one of us was headed to hell every one of us was going down and we was but all of a sudden the author with his great pen reached down and said Satan take your hands off of them Satan that's mine Satan that's mine that's my son that's my daughter hallelujah hallelujah and the author comes down and he writes in this service on a Wednesday night she's gonna dance over the pressure she's gonna dance over sugar diabetes she gonna dance over save her spirit all right Hallelujah in this service the bride is going to see who she is her she's an invincible Army that she's not so bound now slave to the devil she never belonged to the devil but the devil belongs let the authorize under her feet and all of a sudden Satan comes on the Wednesday night and he's gloating he's happy and he's having a fire and all of a sudden the author puts a little spot in there and the next thing you know by the end of that service he's laying under somebody's foot he's like what happened the author changed it the author changes amen that's what came inside but he's walking out joyful this one came and bowed down but it's walking up with his head lifted high and it's going on its way to heaven Hallelujah oh my this one walked in suffering thank you but I want you to look past the suffering and look to the glory [Applause] he's here to change the rhythm of your life he's here to put himself in your story [Applause] Satan try to destroy you over and up but the author said no no no you're not taking no you're not Destroyer no there not be your blood clot no no no no no no no no Hallelujah we were all born in sin we were all shaped on iniquity but today we are I mean they're the author we are the pure virtuous sinless Bride of the son of the Living God every man or woman that's born of the spirit of God and washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and believes every word of God stands as though you never sinned in the first place uh Hallelujah oh what a mighty God we serve if I was supposed to die in the morning and a man come took my place I cannot die for that sin somebody took it so the author was looking at our story and he says somebody's got to die somebody's got to come and take the penalty of sin let me put my name in there he shall bruise his heel but then he shall bruise his head let me put mine put me in there unto you was born this dead child a child the author knows how to write it because if he would have come down with a ten thousand Angel salute and a red carpet and come into Caiaphas and said I'm here whatever devil in hell would have known who they were who he was but the author pulled the wool over there villain's eyes and he slipped it right in there going to be born in a stable an old manure pile and I'm going to take on you and flesh and I'm going to become him so he can become me and my first words are going to be wow yeah wow and the villains looking at just I could be anybody else that can't be him there's no way in the world it's impossible that this God Angels come on come on around here let's talk we was there we there's no way that that it is if the author's writing it and he writes it right down in there and he steps out and one day it was Jehovah running down the road falling down and skinning his knees it was Jehovah crying like a baby in a Manger it was Jehovah that was sitting on the side of a rock with a headache it was Jehovah that dealt with every kind of peer pressure it was Jehovah that dealt with those that walked away and left him to where he died on the cross alone Jesus the word took my place he became me that a sinner like I might become him oh let me hold too true to it not the church to the word that spiritual union of Christ in his church when the flesh is becoming word and the word is becoming flesh manifested Vindicated just what the Bible said what happened in this day it's happening day by day we're near the coming of Jesus to be United with his church where the word becomes the word call of the Holy Spirit searching the heart you're standing completely you never sinned in the first place God don't even know you've done it it's in the sea of forgetfulness you never did it wow this author's got the ability to go back and rewrite every bit of your life and take it all away to where you never did it in the first place you were accused of it by the accuser but really from the beginning you were predestinated to be a son or daughter of God and you're standing there washed and
