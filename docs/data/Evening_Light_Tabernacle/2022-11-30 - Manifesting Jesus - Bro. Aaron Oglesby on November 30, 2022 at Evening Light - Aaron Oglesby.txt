your word declares will happen Lord when you move amongst your people Mighty and the miraculous Lord are manifested and and Lord that's what we're looking for tonight not that we have to manufacture it or make it happen lord it's just you manifesting yourself and your people and tonight Lord we want to be willing to allow Lord you to have preeminence and your will to be done in this service we just ask that you'll bless the word and bless your people father in Jesus name we pray amen amen amen it's good to be in the house of God tonight if you have your Bibles with you tonight and you'd like to turn with me to the Book of John the 14th chapter and the ninth verse we're going to read down through the 20th verse and then we'll look over in Matthew 5 for a short reading there as well John 14 and 9. it says Jesus saith unto him have I been so long with you and yet hast thou not known me Philip he that has seen me has seen the father and how sayeth thou then show us the father believeth thou not that I am in the father and the father in me the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works this is something that we're going to key on tonight is that he doeth the works believe me that I am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very work's sake verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than thee shall he do because I go unto my father and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son if you shall ask anything in my name I will do it if you love me keep my Commandments and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth who the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while in the world seeth me no more but ye see me because I live you shall live also at that day you shall know that I am in the father and ye and me and I in you we're also going to look over in the Book of Matthew the fifth chapter in the 14th verse we're just going to read three verses here before we let you have your seats it says ye are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a Candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven amen I pray that God will add His blessings to the reading of the word as you have your seats tonight the last time that we spoke here we we dealt with works as it came even out of this reading where he said you know believe me for for the work's sake and we we talked about how God uses signs and wonders in order to vindicate his presence and we know that that we do not that we're not to go out looking for signs and wonders we're taught better than that we don't follow after signs and wonders that's actually completely backwards but signs and wonders are to follow after us signs and wonders are to follow after those that believe so as Believers tonight we shouldn't have any issue with expecting and believing for signs and wonders we shouldn't have any problem expecting for the power of God to operate in our midst because he to believe for the gifts to believe for the signs to believe for the Supernatural is not to seek after them the way that Azusa did okay they went to seed on those things and made those things their focus and and so doing they laid aside the word of God and their seeking of of the gifts so so we don't seek after them we believe for them we we expect them we believe that signs will follow we believe that that gifts are to operate in the church and why is that tonight why do we believe that we believe that because the word says that those things are going to be in our midst the word says that they're going to be there and as we read through the gospels and we can see that the supernatural operated in the ministry of Jesus Christ and as his bride it is also it is imperative that the Supernatural is part of our ministry because the ministries of the bride and the ministry of the groom cannot be different they they can't be two different Ministries they have to be one and the same brother Branham says God always vindicates his church by signs and wonders it's always been the sign of God a shout of it in in the camp of The King and I love this last part the king is in the camp today as a bunch of people that's wonderful when you recognize what he's saying right there the king is in the camp today as a bunch of people in other words the bride and the groom as one you are him he is you the the king is in the camp today as a bunch of people and so the ministry of the Bride will be just like the ministry of the groom and it will also be a Vindicated Ministry it has to be because God will always always has and always will vindicate his word time and time again he's done so even with the message of the hours we went over last time he Vindicated it and Vindicated it and even some would say over Vindicated it this message that it would call a bride out for his namesake and now in the closing of time through the ministry of the Bride the word of God will once again be Vindicated in other words it's going to be your life in the word operating and manifested through your life that will actually vindicate that this word is the truth we talked about last time how that fulfillment is the greatest Vindication there is it's going to be you the bride who's going to fulfill that there is a Rapture it's going to be you the bride that fulfills to him that overcometh you will vindicate this word in the last day there is going to be a people who will manifest Jesus Christ and that's what I want to speak to tonight about for a little while is manifesting Jesus manifesting Jesus to manifest is to display or show to demonstrate to be evidence of or prove now now I'm not saying it's wrong to tell people about Jesus you should tell people about Jesus there's no doubt about it but nowhere in manifest is the word tell nowhere in manifest is the word tell it is to display and show to demonstrate to be evidence of or proof in other words it says to make evident or certain by showing or displaying so tonight church this goes beyond a church that just happens to have correct Doctrine this goes beyond correct Doctrine this goes beyond good services and good people this has to be more than that this is a people who don't just talk about it they display it this is a people that don't just teach it they demonstrate it it has to be a life to live that you can't just tell people about the works they want to see what you're talking about the proof is in the pudding it's a people that will manifest Jesus how will people in the world ever know if this is the truth how will people in the world ever know if he is the same yesterday today and forever it's because the people who claim to believe that display it to the World the people who claim this message is the truth Manifest this into the world to the point that whether it's ever accepted or to the point that whether they ever receive it or not the manifestation of Jesus cannot be denied they may not accept it they may not receive it but they cannot deny that something is different there they cannot deny that that's a holy life they cannot deny that that's a Victorious Life and that's exactly what this broad is going to do you are going to be the instrument on the earth that Jesus will use to once again vindicate that he is the same yesterday today and forever who's he going to do it through he's going to do it through you he doesn't have hands here but your hands he doesn't have a voice here but your voice he is going to use you as the instrument to vindicate that he is the same yesterday today and forever you are the instrument that he's going to use once again to prove that this word will defeat Satan anywhere at any time you are that instrument you are that people you are that church you are the instrument that he's going to use to tear down the works of the devil It's a Wonderful position and a wonderful place to be in and once again it brings us back to the importance of the Dynamics always being there with the mechanics because without the same dynamics that Vindicated Jesus the church that stands this day and says that we're the bride we're the bride without that same Vindication their claim is false without that same Vindication they cannot claim to be the Bride of the last day you say how you say this even brother Brown would say it was the resurrection power that brought Jesus up out of the Grave that proved he was who he said he was well what about the three and a half years of ministry he said it was the resurrection power it was the resurrection that proved that he was unlike any other man it was the resurrecting power that proved all his claims were the truth and it's going to be that same power of Resurrection operating in abroad that will prove that this bride is who she says she is it's going to vindicate once and for all it's going to manifest once and for all that you are who you say you are brother brother Branham says Jesus said so he's the same yesterday today and forever how dare any man to wipe that out of there The Works that I do shall you do also John 14 12. these signs shall follow them that believe that is the assurance now this is a very strong statement he says that is the assurance when we see a group of people sitting together and those sides manifesting themselves that's the assurance that the abstract is there to vindicate that that is property of God Amen I don't know about you but I want that Assurance I want that Assurance in my own personal life I want that Assurance in my home I want that Assurance in our church I don't want to sit around and wonder I don't want to sit around and go well maybe well that was a good sermon well that was some good things where he said some nice things no I want to see Jesus Christ manifested in our midst I want to see the same signs I want to see the same wonders I want to see the same vindications he says that is the assurance that that is property of God I want that Assurance in my life I want to know just like Jesus said he said in that day you will know and brother Branham takes that and he says that day is this day he says at that day you will know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you not you're going to have to wonder about it not you're going to have to guess well was he there today did he move today no you're gonna know because you're going to see it manifested through his people manifested in his church The Works that I do shall you do also it's a promise tonight it's not a pie in the sky it's not I hope he moves today I hope he'll heal I hope he'll save I hope he'll deliver he said he will do it and not only will he do it but he's going to do it through you you're gonna manifest Jesus I want to see the life and the ministry of Christ manifested in our midst I want to see victories I want to see healings I want to see salvations I want to see people filled with the Holy Ghost I want to see families restored I want to see overcoming lives those are the manifestations of Jesus Christ men and women overcoming the enemy in Satan's Eden I want his presence manifested in our midst oh I know it manifested in the past I know it manifested in the disciples I know it manifested in William branham's Ministry but I want to see it manifested in my life I want to see it manifested in your life I want to see it manifested in our homes we're a people that say we believe that the pillar of fire has returned to the church or we believe that the pillar of fire is Among Us well I'll tell you this we better believe it because without it we're in trouble but as a people who say they believe that then the pillar of fire should put us in action brother Branham says the pillar of fire should put you in action don't ever get to the place evening like Tabernacle will we get numb to the opportunity to come into its presence numb to the opportunity to come to the house of God on a Wednesday numb to the opportunity to come on a Sunday don't ever let it get to the point where his presence that Pillar of Fire moving I missed doesn't wow us doesn't amaze us doesn't bring us to where we have no choice but to worship with all our heart to give him everything we have don't get to the place where it becomes common but let it put you in action day after day after day let it be the energy down on the inside of you that pushes you to take another step to overcome another day to fight for your family to fight for your children to fight for your healing don't let it become common to you let it energize you tonight Pillar of Fire didn't come back to the church and have its picture taken have itself Vindicated so that we could be religious he didn't return to the church once again so that we could be church members he didn't open the seals and restore all the Bible truths just so we could be good people so we could be good men just to make fair and and honest citizens out of us this isn't just to produce good marriages and good homes although it will do those things but this message was sent to produce Jesus Christ on the Earth again in flesh again in a broad body it was sent to manifest Jesus that's got to be the desire of our hearts to produce Jesus once again a people that will continue the ministry of Jesus Christ right up until the day we go home a continuation of the ministry of Jesus Christ a match peace a match peace here on Earth well why is that so important because until there is a match peace here on the earth he's not coming back because when he comes back he's coming back to one that's just like him one that's just like him in every way bone of his bone flesh of his flesh power of his power there has to be a match piece here upon the Earth not just fair and honest and good there's many that can produce that there's a lot of fair and honest and good people there's many things there's many different churches that produce that but he's looking for a church that operates the way he operated a church that overcomes the way he overcame a church that isn't relying on self and our programs and how big we are and what we do and how we did this he's not looking to for for people who rely upon themselves but one who operates just like him because she is him he is in her and she is in him when he moves she moves when he speaks she speaks she has the word and she knows what he wants done with it she is the manifestation of Christ on the Earth again in flesh that's who you are that's who we are it's got to get Beyond just a gathering of people it's got to get Beyond just God sent a prophet it's got to get down on the inside of the inside of the inside that he's in me and I'm in him that I am he and he is me that I am his bride and together we are one and I'm doing the works that he wants done here on this Earth and he's coming back to take me because of that not because I came to church on Wednesday and I paid my tithes and I was a good person that's not what it's about but he needs a mat piece he's looking for somebody that sold out consecrated dedicated this is their life he is their life flow he is their source of energy [Music] foreign that's what we're called here for that's the whole reason that we are here a match piece to continue the ministry of Jesus Christ right through the very middle of Satan's Eden you know Jesus would say I am the light we've been hearing brother Timothy preach about the light it was so wonderful on Sunday he says I am the light and then he turns right around and says you are the light well I thought he was like his well I thought you were the light you are how can that be same life same Ministry same light living out on the inside it's not you with your own light and your ideas and how you think things should be it's you lining up with the word and that word coming on the inside of you and that light shining out to a Dying World and what's it doing everywhere you turn it's just like a lighthouse and it's shining a light on Jesus it manifests Jesus the life Jesus has she has the way he overcame she overcomes it's the same light the same life living out through a bride in this day same Ministry same light back to our opening scripture there in John 14. 14 10 says believeth Thou not that I am in the father and the father in me the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works believe me that I am in the father and the father and me are us believe me for the very work's sake know what he's telling them here is God above you has now become god with you God above you has now become god with you and that's how these works are being done it's the father and me doing the works and he's teaching them here not to be self-reliant not by might not by power but my spirit even Jesus Christ here taking no credit for what's being done I'm not doing this but it's my father doing this then the next verse 14 12 verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also in Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father in other words you're not doing them yet because I'm still here and therefore my life can't enter into you at this point it's still God With Us it's still God With Us verse 13 and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son if you shall ask anything in my name I will do it if you love me keep my Commandments and I will pray the father that he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth who the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you once again God With Us he's saying you know him because well here I am ye knowing because I'm with you right now you know who I am he says he dwelleth with you and shall be notice what this is this goes from present tense to future tense he dwells with you but shall be in you once I go away on the day of Pentecost I'm going to come back and it's no longer going to be a God above you it's no longer going to be God with you but now it's going to be God with you on the inside God and you got above us God With Us and God in us right here he's laying out the entire mystery you can look at this scripture and even see that the godhead explained he says and God is going to be in you future tense and I will not lead you comfortless I'm going to send the Holy Ghost but how's he say it ah will come to you well who's the Holy Ghost then the one that's sitting there talking to him I will come I will be the comforter yet a little while in the world seeth me no more but you see me because I live you shall live also and at that day ye shall know now remember earlier we were reading just a few verses up he's telling them you're going to know that it's I am the father and the father and me now we've done come down and in future tense he's told about the day of Pentecost now the whole thing's different that I am in the father that hasn't changed but now there's a glorious change there's something marvelous here it's just not he's in the father and the father's in him but ye in me and I in you in other words the same way that it's not me doing the works you're going to do works and it's not going to be you doing the works the same way I manifest the father in the flesh you are going to manifest Me In the Flesh the same way it's not me it's not going to be you but it's gonna be me manifesting my very life through you Hallelujah you are going to manifest me in the flesh it's not going to be you it's going to be me Church you don't have to work these things up you don't have to manufacture these things we don't have to work up a Salvation we don't have to manufacture a gift we don't have to manufacture a Deliverance it's him it's him in our midst it's him moving it's him healing it's him saving it's him delivering I don't have to do nothing but get out the way and allow him to manifest his life through me Lord just manifest yourself do what you do let your life live out through my body it's him it's his life manifested through you the anointed man now the anointed people the anointed man now the anointed people he says look God in his body Christ and Christ in his body the bride oh my God made manifest in Christ Christ made manifest in the bride and as God took from the body of Adam the woman and she fell then God has took from the body of Christ his flesh his body which is his word and is bringing a broad out that won't fall by denomination or Creed no sir but she is coming back with the pure unadulterated word of God being manifested if you stop short of the being manifested you missed it you're not just coming back with the word you're not just coming back with a head knowledge you're not just coming back with some books and some tapes you're not just coming back but you're coming back with the word being manifested the word in action the word overcoming the word defeating the devil the word Healing The Sick the word feeling with the Holy Ghost the word being manifested in a broad body laughs so I ask you how can we not preach the supernatural foreign how can we not believe for the supernatural how can we not live in the Supernatural let me ask you this how can you not be Supernatural this bride cannot be some stiff-neck starchy ritualistic Church it can't be it can't be cold it can't be formal it can't be dead how can she be if she is to be him and his works manifested well I am Jesus you're telling me that Jesus is lukewarm you telling me he's cold and starchy you tell me there ain't no fire in his belly you tell me there ain't no energy to get more to go deeper you telling me he didn't have a passion for this word this bride will by no means be a lukewarm if you're cold and you're formal then you start you there's no movement of this Spirit there's no manifestation of God you have no right to claim the title of Bride of Jesus Christ foreign because this bride will be full of the life of Jesus the this bride will have Victory this is this bride will have life this this bride will have worship this bride will have joy this bride will have overcoming power there will be Deliverance in this bride brother Brown says now Christ The Works that I do shall you do also see the same God see the works that I do shall you do also more than this for I go unto my father the church will be a little longer in the light see vindicating his promised word the church will be vindicating his promised word as God did his promises in Christ's body so is Christ doing the same Works in Christ's body the church see now making his mystery known to his broad tree in the last day bringing forth the fruits that was in the tree at the beginning he says there's many different gifts that God has to his church but they're all for the perfecting of the church to bring together in unity the great body of the Lord Jesus Christ and the powers that was in Christ has been given to his church all that God was he poured into Christ and Christ was God manifested on the earth and all that Christ was he poured into his church and all the powers that God had rested in Christ and the fullness of Christ rest in his church so what a people this should be what a people this should be a people that sit there stone-faced we have all the power but we don't believe in praying for anybody we have all the power but we don't believe in prayer lines we don't believe in the opportunity to cast Devils off people who are struggling but we have all the power what are you doing with it what are you doing you find yourself in the place of the one who dug a hole and buried everything and said this is this is this is ours this is ours and he's going to say depart from me because I gave you all this and you did nothing with it I gave you all this and I expected you to manifest me I expected you to show a Dying World I expect you you to show them that I was the same yesterday today and forever I expected you to manifest Jesus and what did you do with it he says what a people we should be and what do we have to do brother Aaron what do I have to do to make all this happen just let it flow just get out of the way just quit hindering the manifestation of Jesus Christ that's all you have to do is let the light shine take the bushel off that you put over it the candles lit the light is shining in this last day just remove the bushel just let it flow let the light out there's plenty of Darkness out there let it light up the world there's people that need that light you don't have to try and manufacture it all we have to do is not fight against it let that life do what that life has always done let that Ministry do what it has always done it's always healed the sick it's always casted out Devils it's always spoke with tongues it's always done those things what are you saying we got to do something new we got to work this up just let the ministry of Christ be the ministry of Christ just let his life flow through your life quit holding it back quit pulling back on the reins there's a Dying World that needs that light there's a world that needs to see it look I'll tell you what we don't see the children of the devil afraid to manifest his works we don't see the enemy fighting against themselves manifesting you know fighting whether or not they should manifest the spirit that they're of they're not ashamed of it they're not afraid to let that spirit that controls them to be manifested to a world we don't have to see them having a problem spreading the works of darkness they don't have a problem allowing the spirit that they are of you know out through their life I'll tell you another thing they sure don't have they don't have a problem worshiping their God with all their heart they don't have a problem giving the devil a hundred percent they manifest his life they vindicate that from the beginning he was a liar they vindicate that from the beginning he was a murderer they Vindicated in their lives they've Vindicated in their laws they've Vindicated in their government I say stand up o people of God stand up o bride of Christ if they can vindicate if they can manifest if they can worship at a hundred percent what about God's people called the Manifest called to the fullness called The Stand and overcome stand and fight stand and Let Jesus Christ be manifested a holy manifestation a glorious manifestation let it be manifested out of your life okay oh they don't back down they don't give up they don't cower to the critics it's time we quit cowering to the critics it's time we quit backing up stand your ground manifest Jesus Christ manifest that he's a Healer manifest that he's a savior manifest his goodness manifest overcoming power manifest Bible Holiness manifest those things in your life laughs if the power of the darkness is strong enough to cause people to manifest that what about the power of the light is it not strong enough to cause people to manifest Jesus Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord it's time we quit talking about it and let it flow but when we serve is greater the one we serve is more powerful the one we serve is worthy of Our Praise he's worthy of a dedicated life he's worthy of a consecrated life quit talking about it and manifest it we've reached the end time Satan has a broad tree and it's being made manifest God has a bride and through that bride he is being made manifest in the flesh I want to tell you if he was Victorious In the Flesh of the groom he's gonna be victorious in the flesh of the Bride you got nothing to fear you've got nothing to worry about he faced it head on and he showed Time After Time After Time that you could defeat Satan with the word he didn't even use some amazing Supernatural Powers he literally just looked him in the face and said it is written it is written it is written I tell you tonight it is written I will have a church without spot or wrinkle it is written that there will be Overcomers it is written that by his stripes you are healed it is written that the Holy Ghost is to you and into your children and to the many others are far off it is written that you can have joy it is written that you can have peace take the word of God manifest the life of Jesus manifest his victory and overcome the enemy tonight oh come on possess the gates of your entity tonight surrender yourself like Samson did when he surrendered his strength and he went there and he took the gates and he took him up to a hill on Hebron oh come on there was a a greater feat of strength one time when Jesus Took the cross of Calvary and he marched it up that hill he could have quit he could have stopped but he kept going he kept going in that same life is on the inside of you tonight and it says keep going take those Gates of depression take those Gates of anxiety take those Gates of fear take those Gates that are keeping you in prison rip them down and take them up calvary's hill tonight and leave them there manifest Jesus tonight Hallelujah okay Jesus manifested once again in the flesh we got to quit looking to our own natural abilities looking to our failures yes we are failures quit looking to your shortcomings to our humanity and wondering how can this be and turn that into be it unto me Mary didn't know how either she just said be it unto me I don't know how but I know it's not going to be me because in that day I will know that he is in me and I in him in the same way it was the father doing the works through him it is him doing the works through me I don't have to worry about it I just got to quit hindering we got to accept what we've been called to be it's believing that all things are possible it's recognizing that the impossibilities have been removed because it's him manifesting the works through us and when he's involved there are no impossibilities listen we as humans can't do the works I totally recognize that it's Christ in his bride doing the works and manifesting his ministry through her whenever we we think that we have to do it then that puts a pressure on us and we think we have to make this happen we have to make that happen and what it causes is carnal impersonations like you have to speak in tongues you have to do this you have to and it causes carnal impersonations there's nothing I have to do but seek more of Jesus Christ there's nothing I have to do but seek more of him and seek his will and be submissive and say Lord take control that's all you have to do and he does the work through you he manifests himself through you there's no pressure it's him it's him doing it it's his life living look I didn't wake up this morning and have to try to be in Oglesby I lived this whole day as an Oglesby everything I did was as an oglesman because that's who I Am Naturally and the life on the inside of me I didn't have to make myself be a Christian I didn't have to make myself do those things you get Jesus on the inside and you just wake up and that life begins to live out of you because that's who you are that's who your DNA is it affects everything you do why you think when you go to the doctor they want to know your daddy's family history or medical history tell us about the medical history of your father I mean I won't tell them that because then they want to start putting stuff on you they want to start telling you well yeah well you know what it's okay if the devil asks me about my father's history I'll tell him all about that I don't want to tell you not necessarily about my natural history there's a lot of failures in my natural history but let me point you to my spiritual history let me point you to my royal family he's an overcomer in that life manifests through me he's a Healer and that life manifests through me he's a savior he's a deliverer oh my he's the mighty conqueror that life manifests through me as I conquer in this day we're here to manifest Jesus he says father now into your hands we commit this service there's not a man on the face of the Earth Lord not none of us could do this it will be you excuse me so as we have spoken the prophets of old were so anointed under that atonement that they saw visions and Jesus said himself it's not me that doeth the works it's my father that dwelleth in me I do that which always pleases him verily I say unto you I can do nothing in myself but what I see the father doing that doeth the son likewise let it be tonight Lord that they will see the works of God manifested through his church a Living Church a breathing Church a church that finds its energy in him that Finds Its source and its power in him you see it's always been about his strength everything down through the Bible has been about history that's never been about the strength of a man even the heroes we read about it was never about their strength it was it was about them yielding themselves to God it wasn't Moses leading it was the pillar of Fire it wasn't Moses providing all the millions and millions of stuff you talked about Sunday that was amazing was it Moses doing that it was God doing that it was those Works being manifested through Moses notice what David says to to Goliath in first Samuel 17 45 then said David to the Philistine thou cometh to me with a sword and with the spear and with the shield in other words you come to me in your strength with your skills and your protection now notice there was a trap laid for David actually Saul did it it was a trap to go face Goliath with the same weapons that Goliath had it was a trap to go face him in human abilities with human armor with human ideas listen you better not ever go out and face the enemy with your ideas or even the ideas of a church you better be going out with the manifested power of the Lord Jesus Christ to face your enemy that is the only way you can go and face your enemy but David turn the Trap down and we have to be like David recognize it wasn't my strength that killed the bear it wasn't my strength that that killed the line it was the the Lord that came into me and took possession of this body it was him that it was a manifestation of the Lord God of Israel that's why David says to him you come to me in human strength you come to me with human skill and with your human protection but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts the god of the army of Israel whom thou Hast defied this is how we have to uh approach every single battle we Face we have to go into it trust in his might we have to go into it trust in his power and his ability because in ourselves we can't do it I can't manifest Jesus in myself this flesh will fail every single time but if I'll lean on him if I'll lean into him a little more if I'll trust him a little more for the situation I'm in for the trial that I'm in look we heard it Sunday whatever hits you're on tonight he's been there before wherever you're standing at tonight whatever you're going through he's been victorious in that situation before he has kept people who thought they were going to quit he has restored joy to those who are battling depression he has filled those with the Holy Ghost who never thought they had hope he's given New Life to those who are going to commit suicide he has done those things before and he'll do it for you brother Timothy says that that fishing God said he didn't just want to take him out there to see pretty things he wanted to take them out there to catch fish he had a goal in mind he didn't just bring you out to heal you he didn't just bring you out to give you a new doctrine he didn't just bring you out this God is going to take you all the way he brought you out to take you in he brought you out in order to Rapture and he will not fail Wherever You Are Tonight lean into him we see it all through the Old Testament as as different ones yielded themselves to God and allowed him to be made manifest through their life it was God's wisdom in Solomon it was God's strength in Samson and then at the end of the Old Testament we see Jesus comes and he completely authenticates the Old Testament and now there is a bride who will be so consecrated so sold out that she will allow him through her to authenticate the new to manifest Jesus Christ once again I say let there be a fresh outpouring of the Holy Ghost tonight let there be a fresh out porn and and bring that life-giving revelation God was manifested in Christ and now Christ is manifested in his bride you got to bring it down Christ is manifested in me to where you become the Living Word manifested what can the devil do with that oh he can do a lot with your flesh he can attack you he can attack your failures and he can attack your shortcomings but what can he do with the Living Word manifested we saw what he can do with it there when Jesus was on the face of the Earth nothing all he can do is be defeated and thought in Time After Time After Time After Time and I say once again the Living Word manifested will defeat Satan time after a Time After Time After Time if we just allow it to manifest itself in our lives he says Church of God is a living article of God on Earth manifesting Jesus Christ I know it's not popular you can't expect to be but we expect to be right oh I like that he says the word has become the church and the church is the word God all that God was he poured into Christ all that Christ was he poured into the church the Holy Ghost now the enemy's got something see then he isn't fighting something back here many people just take the letter the letter killeth the spirit giveth life see see and they take these Creeds and so forth killeth but when you are taking the spirit that's God himself how do you know it's God because he's taken the word and manifesting it see then it's God himself he said all that God was he poured into Christ all that Christ was he poured into the church so I ask you what kind of power does the believing church have well what kind of power did Jesus have according to Matthew 28 18 says he had all power in heavens and earth all power the power that created eyeballs he had it the power that created worlds he had it oh no wonder he said you could create a world and go live on it because the power that created eyeballs you have it the power that created worlds you have it oh come on let's bring it down a little bit the power to overcome Temptation you have it the power to overcome sin you have it the power to say get thee behind me Satan you have it the power to create an atmosphere where lives can be changed you have it then let's don't talk about it let's manifest it let's do something with it let's put it in action let's put the devil on the run tonight and let the life of Jesus Christ manifest through evening lights Tabernacle do something with it First John 3 8 he that committed sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil then I say for this purpose is the bride of Christ manifested that they might destroy the works of the devil we got a job to do we got work to do oh how do we do it just let him manifest himself manifest Jesus tonight a bride manifesting Jesus now just for the sake of balance I want to point out that this isn't just all about what some might call the miraculous the signs and wonders the gifts manifestations of the Spirit you know I preach and believe and advocate for those things because without that element you cannot be bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh you've got to have it there's no question about that whenever he manifests himself in a body the supernatural will accompany that body however I do want to make it clear that we understand that gifts and callings are without repentance and that we've been taught well enough to know that rain can fall on the just and on the unjust gifts can operate and the spirit manifests on those who aren't even his or those who are living backslidden living in a sinful condition we saw that when brother Brown first encountered the Pentecostal people and he dealt with the two men that were dealing with the gift of speaking in tongues and interpretation and he saw that one was a true Christian and one was a total hypocrite we see that in the life of Balaam where brother Brown says just let us take a look at Balaam he was religious he worshiped God he understood the prophet proper method of sacrifice and approaching unto God but he was not a true seed Prophet for he took the wages of unrighteousness and worst of all he led the people of God into sins a fornication and idolatry he says yet who would dare deny that the spirit of God manifested through him in one of the most beautiful portions of absolutely accurate prophecy the world has ever seen wow we're there and you just turned this whole thing upside down no no that's not the case all of this that I just said is true but that doesn't mean we still don't want it don't let the bogus scare you away from the genuine don't let the fact that it's raining in that field make you not want it to rain in this field don't let the scarecrows turn you away the Life of Christ must still be manifested in US and in that life it will produce signs and it will produce wonders and it will produce the miraculous but it will also produce a life well lived it will also produce love it will also produce kindness it will also produce gentleness it will produce sweetness it will produce a life free from sin so we want all those things we've been preaching about but it better go hand in hand with this part of it as well a life free from sin a life full of love not bitterness and cranky and backbiting and two-toned it's got to produce a Christian life so what are you saying I'm saying don't for one moment hang your hat on on a manifestation of the spirit if your life isn't lining up with the fullness of the word there has to be both of those things going hand in hand there has to be a balance there yes it's about the word yes you must line up with the word Jesus is the word but then don't turn around and Rob the power out of the word yes it should be word word word word but in that word there should be Dynamics Dynamics Dynamics Dynamics you cannot separate the two and you also don't want to live a life that's based nothing on Dynamics when there's no anchor holding you when there's nothing that's taken a hold in your soul brother Brown says oh if we Christians if we ministers if we men women Pentecostals and the rest of us if we can't take what God said his church should be if we can't measure up to the stature that he said then we can be condemned of sin now he's at this point speaking of the supernatural of unbelief we try to say that the days a miracle has passed and all these other things and so on and so on then we can be accused of unbelief for there's only one sin and that's unbelief he that believeth not as condemned already see you don't even get to first base if you don't believe I'm gonna skip down a little bit he goes on says that's what God wants that's what God will have a bunch of people that can say what has Jesus Christ promised what has been promised in the last days that hasn't been manifested through US amen if there's anything we're lacking let's do it if there's anything lacking with us let's get back to that let's remember what he required not what we think we ought to have but what he said we got to have see we got to have it that way the way that he said it now if you skip on now he's talking about the supernatural talking about the supernatural that's what he's dealing with here but then at the bottom of this quote he said now let's think seriously now we Pentecostal people I wonder if we receive the Holy Ghost just for entertainment do we want the Holy Ghost to move just so we can say we had a good service he says but there's more than that goes with it there's a life that's got to be lived just because the signs and wonders are manifested out of your life does not mean you are manifesting the life of Jesus Janice and jamboree's manifested signs and wonders there has to be a life that goes with it when Jesus is manifested there will be shouts there will be dances there will be Visions there will be tongues there will be prophecies there will be Supernatural they must be I don't want to be accused of unbelief as he says I don't want to be accused of sin but there will also be a life that follows that Supernatural an overcoming life a Victorious Life a life free from sin free from the world free from worldly pleasures it'll manifest itself in Bible holiness it'll produce women that line up with the word I'm not stopping right there it'll produce men that line up with the word it will produce homes that are ordered properly under the proper headship according to the word it will produce Christians and Overcomers in the layout of cnh well brother Aaron I liked it better when you was talking about all the signs and wonders let me tell you what an overcomer in laodicea is a sign and a wonder you talk about a powerful God you talk about a supernatural God that in this day there's people still standing there's people this day that still have Holiness there's people in this day still standing with morals still standing for this Christianity surrounded by evil there's still a Bible believing people standing that is a sign that is a wonder that is the miraculous the miracle of a holy ghost filled life there's nothing more miraculous than that in this day that is miraculous because in this day there's one standing that's totally different from Eve there's one that's not going to fall the way e failed there's one that's going to stand and overcome and that in and of itself is miraculous you think about it Eve could not stand in God's Own Eden Satan made efall in God's Own Eden and that day Satan has relished that day for thousands of years and yet now the tables have turned and God's got an eve that will not fall and Satan's eaten and I say God has relished this day for eternity he's been looking forward to this day when a people would manifest his life right in the garden of Satan's Eden and would not fall you talk about the miraculous a bride manifesting Jesus called in this day to be the light oh brother Aaron I can't be that light I I can yes you can and yes you are and yes you will be just accept what you've been called to be quit bringing up what you can and can't do he does the works through you it's not me that doeth the work it was his calling and it was his choosing and it will be him doing the work brother Branham says then if you are a son of God or a daughter of God you are in God all the time but he knew what bed and time you would be planted so now you made a creature a Son of God manifested son or daughter of God to meet the challenge of this hour to vindicate the true and living God of this hour the message that's coming forth in this time brother Branham said he knew you all alone but he planted you in a certain time for a certain purpose oh I can't overcome are you telling me that God made a mistake are you telling me that he chose the wrong ones I say not I say he knew there was a sea gene on the inside of you he knew there was something on the inside of you that would stand he knew there was something on the inside of you that wouldn't back up that wouldn't fall that wouldn't denominate this word but would stand true and he said there's one there's one there's one they'll be part of my end time bride they'll stand in Satan's Eden they won't be overcome but they will be the Overcomers of the age as Jesus Christ is once again manifested in flesh Hallelujah I'm going to start bringing this down he says then he had been in the spirit made manifest In the Flesh to take away sins God return back to God's spirit and now when they take this picture today with us and the people of the Lord is the same Pillar of Fire now the only way it can be proven that it's the same Pillar of Fire is it'll do the same works if it is the same Pillar of Fire the spirit of God Jesus said a little while in the world seeth me no more yet ye shall see me for I will be with you even in you to the end of the world Hebrews 13 8 said Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever then if this Spirit doesn't produce the Life of Christ then it isn't the spirit of God now if I stood here with nail scars in my hand and Prince all over my head here in the form of the crown of thorns and told you that the spirit of God was in me that wouldn't make it so my hands could actually be scarred that wouldn't be in evidence but when you can say that the spirit of God is in us then the works of God will be manifested through your life in other words if a tree he's the vine we are the branches now the vine does not bear fruit it's the branches but it gets its energy from the vine now Jesus doesn't have any hands on Earth but yours and mine he doesn't have any or any mouth on Earth but yours and mine then we become energized with the spirit of Christ and if the life that's in the vine is in the branch the branch will produce the fruits that's in the Vine where does our energy come from it says the energy comes from Jesus Christ Lord I say tonight give us some more of that energy energy to say get thee behind me Satan energy to say come out and it'll be oh let me tell you a little bit about that energy that energy kept going there in the garden of the Gethsemane when he knew what laid before him that energy kept going there at a trial when he was innocent yet he was convicted that energy kept going when he was beat and took Lassen after lasting after lasting that energy kept going as he was going up the hill to Calvary that energy kept going when he went down into hell and he defeated every devil every demon everything you would ever face oh I bet he was worn out no sir that energy kept going there was enough energy left that he came up and he resurrected on the third day I'm telling you that's the energy we have that energy says keep going when you're sick keep going when you're tired that energy says push your own little bride press on keep going oh we're going through hell we're in Satan's Eden I bet there's no energy left wrong again devil there's enough energy the resurrection this body there's enough energy to take this bride in a rapture we are being energized by Jesus Christ let that energy pulsate let that energy flow manifest Jesus in your life energize this church Lord energize this broad body energize us for the closing stress energize us to manifest him Hallelujah Hallelujah yeah oh come on now when others deny energize me when others betray energize me when others Fall by the wayside energize me give me the energy to keep going you can stand with us as we bring this to a close there will be a people that manifest Jesus it's the bride that is they'll hear that is now his body on Earth manifesting Jesus once again laughs brother Branham said Moses was the Vindication of the interpretation of the word he said Moses was God's interpretation of his promise then what are you but the interpretation of the promise that I will have a church without spot a wrinkle how can you have a spot if you're him how can you have a wrinkle if you're him quit looking at this in that day you shall know that I am in you and you are in me and we are one it's not you that doeth the work it's not your righteousness it's not the fact that you're wrinkle free or Spot Free and he just wants somebody that will Manna Fest I want to read this quote as I close Allelujah foreign somewhere in here what does it prove what all these things prove when you see a church begin to operate like he operated begin to overcome the way he overcame to do the works that he did it tells us that there's a match piece that's starting to come to Perfection on the Earth and if there's a match piece starting to come to Perfection on the earth it shows us that we're nearing the rapture because when he is fully manifested in a bride then the Capstone can come and then she can receive it but until she gets to that place she can't receive it there has to be a manifestation fully that matches who he is phone of his bone flesh of his flesh because he's coming back for a match piece but brother Branham says what does life in the body show he said his body was not held in the grave recognize with him in the resurrection same as he is now listen which means this his word which he is has begun to be risen the word that down through the age of Luther Wesley C has begun to raise up to its power there it began to move then it moved a little more now it's coming up to identification see watch now the life in the body is a Vindication that the Rapture is at hand when you see the headship and the body becoming one and the fullness of the measure of his manifestation shows that the body is about ready to be received to the headship Church where are we at how close are we I say Lord manifest your life through me more if that's what it takes manifest yourself in me manifest yourself in even like Tabernacle manifest yourself in your bride around the world life in the body shows that the body is rising up come on Church Life didn't come back into the body of Jesus so he could stay in the Tomb but life came in the body so that he could resurrect life came in the body so that he could come back and I say that life has once again come into the body of Jesus so that we can go home in a Rapture it's going home time it's time to manifest what we are and there will be nothing no greater manifestation that you are the Bride of Jesus Christ than the Rapture I'm telling you Jesus was so Vindicated that even those that couldn't accept him had to admit who he was Nicodemus said we know that you're a teacher from God the Centurion said surely this is the Son of God they couldn't accept it they didn't believe it but they had to testify of it and there's coming a day this bride will be so Vindicated they may not accept it they may not believe it but one day you're going to be gone and you know what they're going to say surely that was the Bride of Jesus Christ oh come on many claim to be the Christ many claim to be the Christ but only one manifested God and many have claimed to be the bride but there will come one who will manifest the Lord Jesus Christ I say be it unto me being unto me Lord Lord let me be that one there's been churches churches Brides bride but there must come one it might as well be me it might as well be you God bless you Church let's manifest Jesus [Music] right nothing without you hence
