[36:14] deuteronomy 32 in this evening
[36:17] verse 7
[36:19] amen
[36:21] remember the days of old
[36:24] consider the ears of many generations
[36:28] ask thy father
[36:30] and he will shoot
[36:31] the thai elders and they will tell thee
[36:35] when the most high divided donations
[36:38] there their inheritance
[36:41] when he
[36:42] separated the sons of adam
[36:45] he set the bounds of the people
[36:48] according to the number of the children
[36:51] of
[36:52] israel for the lord's
[36:55] portion is his people
[36:58] jacob is the lot
[37:00] of his
[37:01] inheritance
[37:03] he found him
[37:04] in a desert land
[37:07] in the west holding wilderness
[37:10] and he led him about
[37:12] he instructed him he kept him as the
[37:16] apple of his eye
[37:18] as the eagles steal it up
[37:20] her nest flooded over her young spread
[37:24] the blood abroad her wings
[37:26] take them
[37:28] build them on her wings so
[37:32] somebody let's say so
[37:34] oh so the lord alone
[37:37] did lead him
[37:40] and there was no strange god with him
[37:44] amen may the lord has his blessing for
[37:46] the ridicule of the world we can take
[37:48] our
[37:49] amen
[38:06] so when the most high divided the land
[38:09] as an inheritance
[38:13] when the most high the most high divided
[38:16] the land
[38:18] amen as an inheritance
[38:21] to the nations the most high
[38:24] god of israel
[38:27] he divided the land
[38:30] you see
[38:31] at the babylon babylon tower
[38:34] they had to spread around
[38:37] and the bible says here he sets
[38:40] their boundaries
[38:44] according to the numbers
[38:48] no not of
[38:50] their power
[38:52] not of their
[38:53] intelligence not of their riches not
[38:56] according to their
[38:59] abilities
[39:01] or how many
[39:04] citizens they are going to have
[39:07] but according
[39:09] the bible says
[39:10] to the children of israel
[39:15] so
[39:16] first of all god god had in his mind
[39:20] the sons of israel
[39:23] so before america was born
[39:26] god had in his mind
[39:28] the sons of israel
[39:31] before that he had germany he had in his
[39:34] mind
[39:35] the sons of israel
[39:39] so first he gave to other nations big
[39:44] nice countries
[39:47] with big
[39:49] resources
[39:51] with big
[39:53] possibilities
[39:55] for thailand
[39:57] if you have been in israel maybe you
[39:59] have seen
[40:00] something that you never expect
[40:03] not green land
[40:05] not forests
[40:07] no pastors
[40:09] even god when look to israel said i will
[40:11] give you a country that flows with milk
[40:15] and honey full of water
[40:22] fertile lions but
[40:24] to little
[40:25] israel
[40:27] a small
[40:29] land
[40:31] so but first we have just read here
[40:34] he had he thought first
[40:37] about
[40:38] israel so so israel
[40:41] get the best
[40:43] according to god himself
[40:46] first
[40:48] and then
[40:49] the other nations
[40:51] second
[40:53] isaiah 55 verse 8 said for my thoughts
[40:57] are not your thoughts
[40:59] neither
[41:01] your ways are not my ways declared the
[41:04] lord as the heavens are higher than the
[41:08] earth so are my ways higher
[41:11] than your ways and my thoughts
[41:14] than your thoughts
[41:17] so first
[41:19] he thought
[41:20] about you
[41:23] about your life
[41:27] about my life
[41:29] he had in mind god the creator before
[41:32] you came here he thought all about your
[41:36] life
[41:36] then he placed you and made you
[41:41] the way
[41:42] you are
[41:46] somebody let somebody say hallelujah
[41:49] so the brotherhood said in things there
[41:51] are to be just like your birth here i i
[41:56] said you was prepared
[41:59] god god knew
[42:01] you would be here
[42:03] and now you know
[42:05] even things that your parents done
[42:08] people think that that is isn't the
[42:11] visit from generation to generation but
[42:14] it is
[42:15] you you were all pre-planned by god
[42:20] nothing happens by chance with god
[42:23] he knows all about you
[42:26] somebody say he knows all about me
[42:29] he knows all about me he knows all about
[42:32] you he knows all about it
[42:35] it's all pre-planned
[42:37] pre-planned for many generations back so
[42:40] that you could be here tonight
[42:44] and the prophet asking did you know that
[42:48] amen amen we know that
[42:50] amen blessed be the name of the lord
[42:54] for the lord portion
[42:56] is his people verse 9 says so the lord's
[43:00] portion
[43:02] now the hebrew word he here is
[43:05] inheritance god had inheritance god
[43:10] has
[43:11] an inheritance
[43:14] his territory the same word is territory
[43:17] god has a territory
[43:20] my territory my inheritance my
[43:24] possession is in his people
[43:28] so you are to be his possession
[43:31] his territory
[43:33] his inheritance
[43:35] amen so he founded him
[43:39] he founded us
[43:40] verse 10 says in a desert land
[43:44] in a west land and he instructed us
[43:47] and he kept us
[43:49] as the apple of his eyes
[43:52] only to think about
[43:55] and he places us
[43:58] in a nest
[44:01] he
[44:03] you see
[44:05] first of all before you came here mama
[44:08] eagle has to head a nest for you
[44:13] baba eagle has to prepare first
[44:16] a nest for the little little eaglets to
[44:19] bring them
[44:20] in her nest
[44:22] so the eagle is a special bird
[44:25] it's build special
[44:27] it's bulls special to fly
[44:29] to fly in high places
[44:32] so she built her nest
[44:35] in not in the trees
[44:37] like other birds
[44:39] but the eagle mama eagle likes to fly
[44:42] in high places
[44:45] very high places
[44:47] she first of all she
[44:49] she's looking for a rock
[44:52] yeah she she likes to build her nest
[44:55] on a rock
[44:57] first she need to have a revelation
[45:01] everything has to be according to a
[45:03] vision somebody say vision
[45:06] god's vision
[45:07] mama eagle vision
[45:09] we are here because
[45:12] mama eagle had a revision
[45:15] so she started to build
[45:17] is
[45:19] a nest and
[45:21] an eagle is not made to stay on ground
[45:26] no
[45:27] his eyes are made for great height
[45:31] and can see in deep
[45:34] valleys
[45:37] but before she she have the little
[45:39] eagles she must prepare that nest she
[45:42] must prepare a nest
[45:45] for the eggs for the little eagles so
[45:47] she is looking first she is looking
[45:50] for a proper rock
[45:51] and then after
[45:53] she find that that rock that she feel
[45:57] comfortable with it the legal the big
[46:01] eagles
[46:02] it is the golden eagle
[46:05] love that
[46:07] and
[46:09] hmm
[46:14] she has in her mind
[46:17] the little eagle
[46:19] he had in mind you
[46:22] so she starts to build the nest
[46:25] she looks
[46:26] around and starts to pick up
[46:30] little sticks
[46:31] and thorns
[46:33] and branches
[46:35] from around the places she is flying
[46:37] over
[46:39] and she picked them this this little
[46:43] little rocks and sticks
[46:46] before before you has to come he has to
[46:49] build together some
[46:50] some things that is very necessary for
[46:53] your
[46:54] life
[46:57] so fourth generation before the prophet
[46:59] said before you come mama eagle decided
[47:02] you the place you are going to be born
[47:06] where i have to be born every every son
[47:10] of god where should be born so god
[47:13] started to put in your gene
[47:15] to add in your gene what he wanted you
[47:18] to be in order to fulfill his plan
[47:22] for your life
[47:23] god has a plan for your life god has a
[47:26] plan for my life
[47:28] god has a plan
[47:30] for all of us
[47:31] so before you came here god had already
[47:35] a plan
[47:36] for your life
[47:38] so i'm happy that god
[47:40] had a plan for me
[47:42] before i came here
[47:44] already he had a plan in motion
[47:47] he had a plan in his mind
[47:49] so he placed me he places you exactly in
[47:53] the place where you will fulfill
[47:57] what he had in his mind can you say amen
[48:01] so actually we we are the nest this is
[48:05] the nest that god created
[48:07] exactly the way he wanted us to be so
[48:10] don't be critical the way you look
[48:13] uh the way the the
[48:15] the
[48:17] if you are not so
[48:19] tall or
[48:20] everything is fine
[48:22] so he this is exactly the way
[48:26] he wanted us to be amen so don't be
[48:29] critical on this world on you god looks
[48:32] to you
[48:33] and you look good for him
[48:37] you you look perfect he is happy with
[48:40] you
[48:41] let us also be happy with him
[48:43] so she she built her nest but when the
[48:46] nest is ready for the little little was
[48:48] to come
[48:50] first of all you know what the mama
[48:52] eagle is doing she is looking for a lamb
[48:58] so she is looking for a lamb
[49:00] because you know before the little ones
[49:03] came she want to make a comfortable
[49:05] place
[49:06] she want them to feel good in the church
[49:09] she wants them to as you know a place
[49:11] where she can feed the eagle the little
[49:14] eaglets yeah yeah so she is hunting she
[49:18] is looking for the play from far when
[49:20] she find that lamb
[49:22] she is killing that lamb and before you
[49:25] came here the mama eagle had a lamb
[49:27] slain
[49:29] before the foundation of the world
[49:32] hallelujah to make you comfortable you
[49:34] know so because actually she needed a
[49:37] skin a
[49:39] skin lamp
[49:41] so
[49:42] she prepared the lamb skin and she
[49:45] placed it in the nest
[49:47] then the eaglet can come
[49:49] so the family you can
[49:52] the personality you have
[49:54] the country will come
[49:57] the way we look
[49:58] everything is perfect
[50:01] the prophet said here
[50:04] in a place
[50:06] that
[50:07] job
[50:08] job the oldest book in the bible was
[50:11] supposed
[50:12] to be even written before moses wrote
[50:15] genesis but the oldest book in the bible
[50:17] was speaking of redemption yet
[50:20] redemption was far way before that
[50:23] redemption is one is one of the oldest
[50:26] things in the bible
[50:27] did you know redemption was even before
[50:30] the plan
[50:31] of redemption was laid out before the
[50:33] world was ever formed think of that
[50:36] god for seeing making a way of
[50:39] redemption before he even made the world
[50:43] for the bible plainly says that christ
[50:45] was predestinated foreign and was the
[50:48] lamb of god slain before the foundation
[50:51] of the world that's right way before the
[50:55] world was made god had a plan
[50:58] of redemption
[51:00] blessed be the name of the lord so the
[51:02] eaglets have the same
[51:04] parents
[51:06] but they
[51:07] are different
[51:10] amen not all of us are the same
[51:13] so in our case mama eagle finds some
[51:16] eagles somewhere
[51:18] in the wilderness somewhere in united
[51:22] states somewhere in europe somewhere in
[51:24] africa somewhere in australia and
[51:28] laid them
[51:29] there on the sheepskin
[51:32] and started to feed them
[51:36] so
[51:40] and what a time they had
[51:42] when we came in the message everything
[51:44] was so smooth
[51:46] so nice
[51:47] the songs are so nice the music is
[51:50] sound so good
[51:51] we heard so many nice things
[51:54] we had a good fellowship everybody is
[51:56] like an angel
[51:59] so so when we come in the nest every we
[52:02] have a revival you remember when we came
[52:05] first in the message everybody was an
[52:08] angel a good angel
[52:11] we had really
[52:13] really a good time we know it was the
[52:15] first love
[52:16] and and everything was was really cool
[52:19] and we we could not wait at the gate of
[52:22] the church the doors of the church to be
[52:24] open
[52:25] and
[52:26] really it was uh
[52:27] it was something special and and
[52:31] we came happy to the church and to eat
[52:35] and to rejoice
[52:37] when we say amen saying we had a great
[52:40] time
[52:41] but the problem is that we are not made
[52:44] to stay in the nest forever
[52:47] we have we are in an age of the
[52:50] flying eagle
[52:52] so god is expecting us to fly
[52:55] and fly alone
[52:57] amen we need to fly so little eagles are
[53:02] sitting in the nest and mama eagle
[53:04] always come and a nice sermon is feeding
[53:06] them and and the times goes on and you
[53:10] know what is the problem when you are
[53:11] sitting and eating
[53:14] you gain weight
[53:18] and suddenly the place became a little
[53:20] big squeeze a little bit you don't have
[53:23] enough time like a place like before
[53:26] so
[53:27] slowly slowly because you started to
[53:29] grow
[53:30] it's
[53:32] starting to appear inconveniences
[53:36] you see it was is something slowly
[53:38] slowly changing but it is not because
[53:42] it's because you grow
[53:45] and you grow to a place when
[53:49] the place where god wants you to be
[53:53] he wants you to fly
[53:56] so
[53:57] because we are born to fly
[54:00] you are born to fly
[54:02] we are born to be in the rapture
[54:09] we are waiting for that revelation
[54:12] which is your identity
[54:15] you see the problem with the little
[54:16] eagle
[54:17] is he had spiritual amnesia
[54:21] the
[54:22] the only things that
[54:25] the little eagle
[54:26] needs is to remember who is he
[54:32] and if you remember who you are you have
[54:35] all the abilities
[54:38] that you need
[54:41] to
[54:42] fly
[54:44] everything is in the seat
[54:46] so staying all your life in the nest
[54:49] will produce problems
[54:51] sometimes strives
[54:53] because the eagles start to grow
[54:55] to mature
[54:57] and then features features appear
[55:00] and they started to change they look
[55:03] change the way they behave change they
[55:06] are not anymore in the first love you
[55:08] know they are different
[55:10] so mama once mama eagle wants them to
[55:13] fly
[55:14] and the fly in god's promises
[55:17] to fly
[55:19] in the promises
[55:21] that he allotted
[55:23] for this day
[55:25] mama wants don't to have
[55:27] their own experience
[55:31] it is good to have prophet experience it
[55:33] is good to have my experience but he
[55:35] wants you to have your experiences
[55:40] sometimes when you are too much fitted
[55:44] service after service
[55:46] sometimes we start to complain
[55:50] that's why in verse 11 we read here as
[55:53] the eagle filled up
[55:56] her nest so the lord alone
[55:59] leave them
[56:01] and she starts to flip her wings
[56:04] and and one day she has to pull the skin
[56:08] from under them
[56:11] and for the first time you start to
[56:13] realize
[56:14] that this nest is not so comfortable
[56:20] you are not enough predestinated to
[56:24] you know to be happy with this
[56:26] because you smile like papa you know you
[56:30] sometimes think like mama
[56:32] and we inherit a lot of sticks
[56:36] and when you come first and hear about
[56:39] predestination and wonderful things of
[56:42] god makes you happy but when the
[56:44] sheepskin goes out
[56:46] you start to feel uncomfortable
[56:50] because it is not a problem what is
[56:52] going on it's only a thing that mama
[56:55] wants you to understand you need
[56:58] to take off
[57:03] and you need to fly alone
[57:06] they don't take you by hand to fly you
[57:09] don't need to meet to fly you have the
[57:12] abilities in you to fly
[57:15] you are born to fly
[57:17] you are you only need to know who you
[57:20] are
[57:22] and this is rapturing faith
[57:24] faith is revelation
[57:28] rapturing revelation so rapturing
[57:30] revelation is your identity
[57:33] can you say manly tell eager
[57:36] the message just revealed who you are
[57:40] the message didn't make you
[57:42] what you have not been before
[57:44] the message just brought you your
[57:47] identity
[57:49] telling you that you come from god and
[57:52] you go back to god
[57:55] amen can you say praise the lord
[57:57] amen so this is the day when many
[57:59] inconvenience inconveniences appear so
[58:02] you start to feel that sticks and rocks
[58:06] and amen because you are called to be
[58:10] like him
[58:12] a flying eagle
[58:14] each one of us
[58:16] we are called to be that's why the
[58:18] anointing we have today
[58:20] is a flying eagle
[58:22] so everything have its time
[58:24] but you must
[58:26] fly and fly alone that's why paul said
[58:29] be
[58:30] changed
[58:32] say be changed
[58:33] be transformed
[58:36] in your mind
[58:38] we need to be changed be transformed in
[58:40] your mind change your mind from a lazy
[58:44] eagle to a soaring one
[58:47] be transformed be changed from a
[58:49] lukewarm condition to a person ready for
[58:52] the rapture
[58:54] from a former believer to a manifested
[58:57] son of god
[58:59] we are in an age of the manifestation
[59:03] of the stance
[59:06] not of a church
[59:08] not of a man
[59:11] not even of a prophet
[59:14] we are in the time of the manifestation
[59:16] when the sons of god
[59:18] came
[59:19] in
[59:21] themselves
[59:22] i say this right
[59:25] when the sons of god
[59:27] are
[59:28] coming
[59:29] in
[59:30] themselves they start to manifest
[59:34] are you one of them
[59:37] so we are in the time when the sons of
[59:39] god
[59:40] has to come in in manifestation
[59:44] and you are one of them
[59:47] from a helpless person to a strong
[59:49] believer in christ
[59:51] so i want to show you
[59:53] some igloos that god
[59:56] that we find
[59:58] god finded in the wilderness
[1:00:00] one of them is abraham avenue
[1:00:03] the father abraham
[1:00:05] father abraham was a little eagle
[1:00:09] in babylon
[1:00:10] so he got a lot of troubles
[1:00:12] i don't know if you know about it but
[1:00:15] he had a lot of trouble in babylon
[1:00:17] because god wanted him to let her to go
[1:00:21] to discover himself
[1:00:23] when god said there in hebrew
[1:00:26] come out in the world it's
[1:00:30] means come and reveal discover yourself
[1:00:34] so our journey your journey is to
[1:00:37] discover
[1:00:38] yourself
[1:00:41] this was a little eagle
[1:00:43] that god find having him in babylon
[1:00:46] another little eagle was moses
[1:00:49] moses
[1:00:51] moses rabbenu
[1:00:53] the teacher
[1:00:54] he was an eagle in the wilderness so he
[1:00:57] got a lot of problems he got a lot of
[1:00:59] sticks and rocks and turns and problems
[1:01:02] what was not nothing problem with it you
[1:01:05] know the only things he did
[1:01:07] with his own strengths with his own
[1:01:09] abilities
[1:01:11] with what he tried to do he had a dead
[1:01:14] egyptian
[1:01:16] but god wanted him to be a flying eagle
[1:01:20] and he has to fly to turbulences
[1:01:23] he has to fly to all the problems
[1:01:25] because god knows that he the eagles are
[1:01:28] built in such a way they can fly
[1:01:33] another legal that we find in the bible
[1:01:35] is elijah
[1:01:37] he was also in a cave he was in the
[1:01:40] depressive depression
[1:01:42] and he was hiding himself in a cave
[1:01:44] sometimes eagles are in caves
[1:01:48] but still a small voice
[1:01:52] do you think that it was an audible
[1:01:54] voice
[1:01:56] no it was the inside voice
[1:01:58] the wind in the in the pentecost was
[1:02:01] inside there
[1:02:03] you have something in you that is
[1:02:06] sensitive to that dimension
[1:02:10] hallelujah can you say hallelujah
[1:02:13] hallelujah amen another eagle that we
[1:02:15] find is elijah
[1:02:17] he was in the field
[1:02:19] plowing
[1:02:20] and he could he he could not be
[1:02:23] disobedient
[1:02:25] to the heavenly
[1:02:27] vision
[1:02:28] there is a heavenly vision everything is
[1:02:31] according and heavenly vision and this
[1:02:33] evening was also in the heavenly vision
[1:02:36] and you have been also in the heavenly
[1:02:40] vision
[1:02:42] but i want to pick up one because i knew
[1:02:45] that here are some a lot of young people
[1:02:48] may the lord bless the young people
[1:02:51] hallelujah
[1:02:54] it is it is finded in luke chapter 15
[1:02:57] luke chapter 15
[1:03:00] verse 11.
[1:03:02] we find out the bible jesus give this
[1:03:05] parables
[1:03:09] and he said to them
[1:03:11] luke
[1:03:13] luke 15
[1:03:15] 11 and he said a certain man had
[1:03:19] two sons
[1:03:22] a certain man had two eagles
[1:03:27] and the young
[1:03:29] told
[1:03:31] younger of them said to his father
[1:03:34] father
[1:03:35] give me the portion of goods
[1:03:39] give me the portion
[1:03:41] that followed to me
[1:03:43] actually the hebrew thought here
[1:03:46] is when you ask this you ask the death
[1:03:49] of your father
[1:03:52] so he said
[1:03:54] father
[1:03:55] give me
[1:03:56] a certain man had to start so the
[1:03:58] youngest man told
[1:04:00] give me
[1:04:01] my portion what is strange here
[1:04:04] is the question
[1:04:06] why
[1:04:08] he needed
[1:04:09] his
[1:04:10] portion why this little eagle
[1:04:14] will need
[1:04:16] its portion because he was rich enough
[1:04:20] he doesn't lack anything
[1:04:24] he have anything he wanted
[1:04:27] from his youth they will clean his mouth
[1:04:32] the money the father will give will not
[1:04:34] make him richer
[1:04:36] he all his life he had enough like one
[1:04:40] of us here
[1:04:42] you see
[1:04:43] you just are in a family
[1:04:45] and they take care of you everything is
[1:04:47] fine
[1:04:50] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:04:52] so but he wanted something different he
[1:04:55] didn't want it only to have the riches
[1:04:57] of his father
[1:04:58] this will not satisfy him because we
[1:05:01] find out after he get his portion he
[1:05:03] still remains some more days in the
[1:05:06] house
[1:05:07] he didn't left the house immediately
[1:05:10] so actually he was not greedy for money
[1:05:13] he didn't wanted
[1:05:15] more from his father
[1:05:18] but we understand that it was something
[1:05:20] different what he wanted
[1:05:22] so
[1:05:23] he
[1:05:24] he
[1:05:26] he wanted to have control of his own
[1:05:30] life
[1:05:32] he wanted to take his own decision this
[1:05:35] little eagle here he he he had enough
[1:05:39] with his father leadership
[1:05:41] so he wanted to have control of you of
[1:05:44] his own decision he thought he know
[1:05:47] better
[1:05:49] he saw that he can direct his life
[1:05:51] better than
[1:05:53] his father
[1:05:54] will told him to do things
[1:05:58] so he wanted to
[1:05:59] to win to do what he want when he want
[1:06:04] and how
[1:06:05] he want
[1:06:07] sounds
[1:06:08] you know
[1:06:10] isn't strange that sometimes we do
[1:06:13] likewise
[1:06:15] even if we don't show it
[1:06:17] many times you want to do similar the
[1:06:19] same way
[1:06:21] and verse 12 the bible said the younger
[1:06:24] said of the father give me and he
[1:06:26] divided unto them
[1:06:29] so both of them would have been blessed
[1:06:32] even the youngest also the oldest they
[1:06:35] both of them benefit
[1:06:37] by this what happened you know actually
[1:06:40] the father wants all the eagles to fly
[1:06:44] but some are a little bit
[1:06:46] you know faster
[1:06:48] have another personality at the end both
[1:06:50] of them will fly
[1:06:52] but
[1:06:54] he divided unto them
[1:06:57] and not after many days
[1:06:59] so he was staring in the house
[1:07:02] and and then after he get it he he
[1:07:06] he get his portion his liberty when he
[1:07:10] saw that he have his own possibility to
[1:07:12] control his life to rule his future to
[1:07:15] to to do what he decide to do to
[1:07:18] to
[1:07:19] to make us to do things the way he wants
[1:07:22] to do to to
[1:07:24] everything
[1:07:25] that to apply in his life his intentions
[1:07:29] because he he thought he knew better
[1:07:31] than his father he saw that his father
[1:07:33] make mistakes he saw that this message
[1:07:36] is not 100 the way should be
[1:07:41] so he stood a little bit in the house
[1:07:43] before he took the flight but in his
[1:07:45] heart already he had a desire to leave
[1:07:50] but finally he left
[1:07:52] he left with
[1:07:54] the bible said with all his
[1:07:56] substance
[1:07:59] he took all his substance
[1:08:02] he took
[1:08:04] he took his substance in another land
[1:08:08] he took all
[1:08:10] the substance the father gave him
[1:08:13] he took everything what he have been
[1:08:15] educated everything what he
[1:08:18] how he was trained
[1:08:22] all his dignity all his self-esteem
[1:08:27] he took it
[1:08:28] he took all his substance with him he
[1:08:31] all his blessings from the father i tell
[1:08:33] you the the
[1:08:35] many people who would like to be here to
[1:08:37] have to be bored in a message family
[1:08:39] many will be privileged
[1:08:42] to hear what you hear to know what you
[1:08:44] have to to have a pastor as you have to
[1:08:46] have ministers as you have
[1:08:48] to hear things that you hear to know
[1:08:51] things that you know
[1:08:52] but they
[1:08:53] don't have this privilege so we
[1:08:56] we are you we feel
[1:08:59] we are not feel proud against them
[1:09:02] we just are
[1:09:04] we want to thank the lord for what he
[1:09:06] does already
[1:09:08] you know actually
[1:09:09] judas was also predestinated
[1:09:12] you see the the grace that was given to
[1:09:15] you was not that you have been prayed
[1:09:16] destinated if you have been elected
[1:09:20] before you have been predestinated you
[1:09:21] have been elected so god was storing
[1:09:24] something from himself and placed it in
[1:09:26] you
[1:09:29] can you say praise the lord
[1:09:31] hallelujah
[1:09:35] amen so he took all his substance
[1:09:39] so we we need to add some some things so
[1:09:43] we read in the bible that
[1:09:45] what god blessed nobody can curse
[1:09:50] so we understand that we have been
[1:09:52] blessed from the beginning
[1:09:55] and will remain blessed forever
[1:09:57] you can say amen
[1:09:59] so what god already had what god already
[1:10:02] blessed we remain blessed
[1:10:05] but
[1:10:06] if
[1:10:07] only things that can can do
[1:10:11] if you this space you you are not happy
[1:10:15] with what you have
[1:10:16] how you say it you display the uh
[1:10:20] yeah you don't count it too
[1:10:22] valuable
[1:10:24] what you got
[1:10:26] you can curse yourself
[1:10:30] and the devil knew that
[1:10:33] nobody can curse you
[1:10:35] only if you curse yourself
[1:10:38] so if the devil can make you
[1:10:42] to do things wrong
[1:10:45] then you will curse yourself
[1:10:48] amen
[1:10:50] so he cannot curse israel did israel
[1:10:52] that not does it himself
[1:10:55] he cannot curse you till you don't do it
[1:10:57] alone
[1:10:58] you are blessed because the father
[1:11:01] thought about you
[1:11:03] and cared about you
[1:11:05] and choose you to be his son and his
[1:11:08] daughter
[1:11:10] so before the world began you god
[1:11:12] already thought about you
[1:11:15] so you meet people in the in your life
[1:11:19] somebody are maybe not so
[1:11:24] wealthy or
[1:11:26] you you go to work in a job
[1:11:28] and you look to your boss
[1:11:30] and you thought what wonderful what
[1:11:32] blessed are the people
[1:11:34] you you need to realize
[1:11:36] that they are blessed because of you
[1:11:38] because before that man came
[1:11:41] god had you in your mind
[1:11:43] he chooses your boss
[1:11:46] he choose choose your neighbors
[1:11:48] he chooses every person that you are
[1:11:50] going to come in your life
[1:11:52] so he is going to use them according to
[1:11:56] his purpose in your life
[1:11:59] if you are not listen to him
[1:12:01] he will rise up somebody against you
[1:12:04] is all preplanned
[1:12:06] they are predestinated
[1:12:08] to test you
[1:12:11] they are powerful they they make babylon
[1:12:14] in assyria stronger than israel because
[1:12:16] god knew one day israel will
[1:12:19] go astray
[1:12:21] so he needed somebody wiser and stronger
[1:12:24] to bring them in god's will
[1:12:27] because god possession
[1:12:30] and ghost territory is not the soil
[1:12:32] it's you
[1:12:37] it is the only place that god inherits
[1:12:41] process
[1:12:42] and territory so when you walk you know
[1:12:45] now
[1:12:46] you are his possession
[1:12:48] you are his territory
[1:12:50] you are his domain
[1:12:52] wherever you go god goes
[1:12:56] blessed be the name of the lord so what
[1:12:59] happened with the youngest son was he
[1:13:02] wanted his life in his hand and the in
[1:13:05] enemy release against him
[1:13:09] a spirit unthankfulness
[1:13:13] he was tossed about
[1:13:15] a thousand about spirit making him
[1:13:18] to be restless
[1:13:20] how he became restless like like saul in
[1:13:23] the bible he became unhappy
[1:13:26] unhappy of his church
[1:13:28] he became unhappy of his family
[1:13:32] why happen why the people are unhappy of
[1:13:35] his pastor of his church of his friends
[1:13:37] of his parents even they are unhappy of
[1:13:40] themselves
[1:13:41] because he is a demon
[1:13:44] he is a spirit they are tossing the
[1:13:46] people about
[1:13:47] is a tormenting spirit
[1:13:50] and they make you unhappy anyhow
[1:13:54] it's just a spirit
[1:13:56] sent
[1:13:57] to
[1:13:58] torment you to make you curse yourself
[1:14:02] even if you are elected
[1:14:04] sometimes and many times we do mistakes
[1:14:09] so he left his house he left his church
[1:14:12] he left his brother he left his
[1:14:14] environment he took all his substance
[1:14:18] this little eagle
[1:14:20] with him
[1:14:21] verse 14 says and after he had spent all
[1:14:26] after he spent all his substance
[1:14:29] the only things that give you value is
[1:14:31] this message
[1:14:34] if you go in some other places you will
[1:14:37] find out they will call you different
[1:14:40] but you hear when you come in this
[1:14:42] message they call you eagle
[1:14:44] they
[1:14:45] call you a son of god an elect
[1:14:48] they call you bride
[1:14:50] they call you miss jesus christ
[1:14:52] this is no message as this message
[1:14:55] is the power for the the most precious
[1:14:58] light ever
[1:15:00] ever came in this world
[1:15:02] and after he spent all
[1:15:05] after he spent everything what he get
[1:15:08] after he spent all his
[1:15:10] power
[1:15:12] all his gifts
[1:15:14] like the church in the beginning
[1:15:18] after he lost his first love
[1:15:21] after he
[1:15:23] he he spent
[1:15:24] all
[1:15:26] what the father had
[1:15:29] with a citizen
[1:15:31] in in a foreign land
[1:15:33] in the far away land
[1:15:35] a famine arouse
[1:15:38] in that land
[1:15:40] a famine arouse
[1:15:43] in that land
[1:15:45] when the famine arrives in that land
[1:15:48] we are in the time of
[1:15:50] famine he began to be in want
[1:15:54] he realized that he missed something
[1:15:58] he missed something
[1:16:00] so he was looking around
[1:16:04] looking for
[1:16:07] something
[1:16:12] and he went and joined verse 15
[1:16:15] to a citizen of this country
[1:16:19] after he lose his confidence in himself
[1:16:23] after he lose his position
[1:16:26] after he lose
[1:16:28] his peace after he lost his comfort
[1:16:32] after he lost his self-esteem
[1:16:35] after he lost his dignity
[1:16:37] after he lost
[1:16:39] all
[1:16:40] what the father gave him
[1:16:43] after he
[1:16:44] spent all
[1:16:46] what the message gave him
[1:16:48] he became desperate
[1:16:50] and he went and joined himself
[1:16:53] to a citizen
[1:16:55] we find here that this citizen has no
[1:16:58] name is a no-name citizen citizen
[1:17:02] and that citizen
[1:17:03] look what happened he said send him
[1:17:07] into the fields
[1:17:10] to feed swine
[1:17:13] a son of god
[1:17:15] an eagle
[1:17:17] after he became
[1:17:20] he was not any more thankful what he had
[1:17:23] after he he received all this blessing
[1:17:26] for the father after he gets the
[1:17:28] substance of the father after the after
[1:17:31] the
[1:17:32] the god was opened his heart and giving
[1:17:35] him the best he had the message of doubt
[1:17:39] after he spent all these
[1:17:42] he the fame and the famine came in the
[1:17:44] land and he became
[1:17:46] to be in one
[1:17:48] and he went and joined
[1:17:50] joined himself to a citizen
[1:17:53] and that citizen gave him on the
[1:17:55] commission
[1:17:57] always this citizen with no name was
[1:17:59] satan
[1:18:00] satan was happy
[1:18:02] satan saw him
[1:18:04] and when he sees a daughter of god the
[1:18:06] son of god he this is what he wants from
[1:18:08] the beginning he is not happy with
[1:18:11] somebody else to be worshipped he will
[1:18:13] like a son of god
[1:18:15] a daughter of god to come
[1:18:17] so when he saw coming he was so happy
[1:18:21] so he was he was commissioning him
[1:18:24] and he was sending him into his fields
[1:18:27] to feed
[1:18:28] swines
[1:18:30] so he has to
[1:18:34] make his with his with his abilities
[1:18:37] instead serving god he has to serve
[1:18:40] satan
[1:18:42] and while he was there
[1:18:45] the little eagle
[1:18:47] verse 16 says
[1:18:49] he was looking to the pigs
[1:18:52] now he was thinking and dirty
[1:18:55] he was not anymore
[1:18:57] a message believer
[1:19:00] how he used to be he was not anymore a
[1:19:03] special person he was not anymore a
[1:19:05] privileged
[1:19:06] person he was not anymore the same
[1:19:09] looking it used to be he he after he
[1:19:12] spent all his substance
[1:19:14] after he divided
[1:19:17] the post the inheritance of the father
[1:19:20] after the famine came
[1:19:22] he was there
[1:19:24] in wand
[1:19:26] and he would had a great desire
[1:19:28] looking
[1:19:29] to the pigs
[1:19:32] how he was eating husks
[1:19:35] the swine
[1:19:36] did it
[1:19:38] and no man
[1:19:40] gave him
[1:19:42] you know
[1:19:44] nobody will give you
[1:19:46] because god god don't want you to have
[1:19:48] them because you belong to him
[1:19:53] and he wants you
[1:19:54] he wants me
[1:19:57] he cannot

[1:20:27] saw him
[1:20:28] down there
[1:20:30] and the prophet said while he was there
[1:20:33] in a pig pen

[1:20:43] the angel of the lord beated eliezer to
[1:20:47] rebecca with half an hour before the

[1:21:30] it is the only thing that can make us
[1:21:34] to come back to ourselves
[1:21:36] when he almost
[1:21:38] lost everything when he almost
[1:21:42] started to eat with them

[1:24:32] to my father
[1:24:34] and his father
[1:24:36] saw him
[1:24:37] from about from far
[1:24:39] his father
[1:24:41] verse this is verse 19 and the father
[1:24:45] saw him
[1:24:47] verse 20
[1:24:49] from far
[1:24:51] and had compassion
[1:24:53] and run
[1:24:54] why the father run
[1:25:02] it is a ceremony
[1:25:05] when
[1:25:06] a prodigal son
[1:25:08] a son that lost
[1:25:09] his respect
[1:25:11] his appreciation
[1:25:12] a son that lost everything he had
[1:25:15] he was a son that was not worthy to be
[1:25:17] adopted
[1:25:20] they had a kezzaza ceremony
[1:25:23] when the villages the people in the
[1:25:24] villages will saw him coming they will
[1:25:26] take a pot a clay pot
[1:25:29] and they will wait him in the gate of
[1:25:31] the of the village and when he came in
[1:25:33] they they look and they will spit on him
[1:25:36] and they will break the pot
[1:25:38] and they will say for us you will be as
[1:25:41] this broken pot
[1:25:42] we don't want you
[1:25:44] anything to have with you forever
[1:25:47] but before they saw him
[1:25:50] father saw him
[1:25:53] now in those days
[1:25:55] was a shame shameful things to run
[1:25:58] because they had long long dress
[1:26:01] so he had to lift the dress
[1:26:03] to show his feet
[1:26:05] and the father was a wealthy man but
[1:26:08] he was humbling himself
[1:26:10] god
[1:26:12] was humbling himself
[1:26:14] he was lifting his
[1:26:16] dress
[1:26:17] and he was running
[1:26:19] and in the village the people in the
[1:26:21] village was looking
[1:26:22] the father is running what is wrong with
[1:26:25] the father running
[1:26:26] he saw his father he said the son he saw
[1:26:29] me coming
[1:26:31] he saw me making a decision
[1:26:33] after i made the angel of the lord
[1:26:35] after my
[1:26:37] my conscience came back after my
[1:26:39] remembrance you know how you take people
[1:26:42] out of amnesia
[1:26:43] you have to they take them in the
[1:26:45] familiar places
[1:26:47] you have to to call him by name
