[54:12] time with the young people but today
[54:14] we're at

[54:18] they're not the elect of God but we're

[54:22] than being at home amongst your people
[54:24] those that know you and those that you
[54:25] have conf in so we just going to turn to
[54:28] him this morning and I want to speak to
[54:30] you on created for
[54:33] worship created for worship we find here
[54:37] in Psalms 95 says oh come let us sing
[54:40] unto the Lord and let us Make a Joyful
[54:42] Noise to the rock of our Salvation let
[54:45] us come before his presence with
[54:47] Thanksgiving and Make a Joyful Noise
[54:50] unto him with Psalms for the Lord is a
[54:53] great God and a great king above all
[54:55] gods in his hands are the Deep places of
[54:59] the Earth the strength of the hills is
[55:01] his also the sea is his he made it and
[55:06] in his hands formed the dry land oh come
[55:08] let us worship and bow down let us kneel
[55:11] before the Lord Our God for he is our
[55:14] God and we are his people of his pasture
[55:17] the Sheep of his hand God bless you you
[55:19] can have your seats this
[55:24] morning I'd also like to look at in
[55:26] Genesis 1 and
[55:28] I I prefaced this here I actually
[55:30] brought this scripture out when I spoke
[55:32] to you on the word we bring forth but I
[55:34] want to look at this again just briefly
[55:35] this morning as we get in to kind of
[55:37] help build our our our platform for the
[55:40] message today it says then God said let
[55:41] us make man in our image after our
[55:44] likeness and let them have dominion over
[55:46] the fish of the sea and over the fowl of
[55:47] the air and over the cattle and over all
[55:50] the Earth and over every creeping thing
[55:52] that creepeth upon the Earth and then in
[55:54] verse 27 so God created man in his own
[55:58] image in the image of God created he him
[56:02] male and female created he them then in
[56:07] Genesis 2 and verse 7 for our last
[56:09] scripture reading this
[56:11] morning well it won't be the last but
[56:13] it's going to be the last before we get
[56:14] started so and the Lord God formed man
[56:18] of the Dust of the ground and he
[56:19] breathed into his nostrils the breath of
[56:22] life and Man became a living soul
[56:26] so we find that man was the last of all
[56:29] of God's
[56:31] creations you believe that this morning
[56:34] so God continued advancing in his
[56:36] creation until finally he created one
[56:39] that was in His image and of all the cre
[56:41] creatures that were created man was the
[56:44] only one that looked like God man was
[56:47] the only one that was in the image of
[56:50] God and we find in Genesis 1:28 that God
[56:53] blessed that creation and that that word
[56:56] blessed there means to be praised to be
[56:58] saluted to be adored so God essentially
[57:01] stepped back and and he adored or he
[57:04] poured adoration upon his creation
[57:06] because now this is the one in which I
[57:08] had a purpose of creating so we find
[57:12] that in the beginning before there was
[57:13] ever before anything was ever created
[57:16] God desired to have a family the prophet
[57:18] of God tells us that so you and I were
[57:20] in his thoughts way back then before you
[57:22] ever came forth you was in the thoughts
[57:24] of God before you ever gave your heart
[57:26] to the Lord you were in the thoughts of
[57:28] God before you ever committed the first
[57:29] sin or made the first mistake you were
[57:32] in the thoughts of God so before these
[57:34] things you were in God's thoughts and
[57:36] you were in his mind and God longed to
[57:38] have fellowship with you and and God
[57:40] longed to receive worship from
[57:44] you so we find here see God longed to
[57:47] have worship he desired something or
[57:49] someone that would worship
[57:52] him he desired a people that would love
[57:55] him
[57:56] amen so we look notice now God's desire
[58:00] for for a family was now becoming into
[58:02] manifestation because now in Genesis 2
[58:05] we find that he formed man and he
[58:07] breathed the breath of life into man so
[58:09] now man can worship God so he created
[58:13] all boty life and it was good he created
[58:15] the waters and they were good he created
[58:17] the Earth and it was good but it wasn't
[58:19] until he created man that he blessed his
[58:22] creation so that tells me there's
[58:24] something about man that God Longs for
[58:27] or something that God placed in man that
[58:30] he Longs for that sets man a far and
[58:32] above all his other
[58:34] creatures see only man can love God the
[58:38] way God desired to be
[58:39] loved see man is the only one of God's
[58:43] cre creatures or Creations that has a
[58:45] place or a soul and in that Soul they
[58:48] can love God and they can worship from
[58:51] that soul and from that heart only man
[58:54] is that one that has that so there's
[58:55] something something special about man
[58:57] there's something special about each of
[58:59] you that's here this morning so only man
[59:02] can worship God the way God intended to
[59:04] be worshiped so God created man for
[59:09] worship and he placed in the heart of
[59:12] man a desire to
[59:16] worship God placed in your heart this
[59:18] morning a desire for worship when you
[59:21] was young maybe 8 nine 10 years old how
[59:24] many of you had a desire to serve God
[59:26] but yet you you still strayed and you
[59:28] still did things in the world but yet
[59:30] there was something inside of you you
[59:32] wanted to serve God because God
[59:34] deposited inside of you right there a
[59:37] desire to worship
[59:39] him so when God desire to to he desired
[59:43] to be an object of
[59:47] worship His desire was to receive
[59:49] worship from his creation this word
[59:53] worship here we're going to take our
[59:55] time this morning but we're going to get
[59:56] through this but the word worship here
[59:58] means to prostrate especially
[1:00:01] reflectively in homage or Roy to royalty
[1:00:04] or to God to Bow self down it didn't say
[1:00:08] about exalting self and self ideas and
[1:00:11] me over you but it says to Bow self down
[1:00:15] to crouch to fall down flat humbly Bes
[1:00:18] seits to do reverence to make to stoop
[1:00:22] in our day in our age that's a very
[1:00:24] difficulty to do cuz now man is all
[1:00:26] about himself man's a lover of pleasure
[1:00:28] more than is a lover of God he's about
[1:00:30] who he is what he can do what he can be
[1:00:33] you know he's not in the position or in
[1:00:35] the uh the yeah the position to fa
[1:00:38] favorably bow himself down and to Humble
[1:00:41] himself before another man or another
[1:00:43] creature or God see man it's in man man
[1:00:46] today wants to be lifted up but God is
[1:00:50] calling for man to crouch down to bow
[1:00:52] down to lay yourself prostrate and
[1:00:55] worship him
[1:00:56] and him
[1:00:58] alone and the prophet of God will tell
[1:01:00] us God wants to be worshiped the word
[1:01:02] god means an object of worship and he
[1:01:05] says and it's God trying to condition
[1:01:07] his people so he can get from them what
[1:01:10] he created them
[1:01:12] for so God created you for worship and
[1:01:16] God is trying to condition you so that
[1:01:18] he can get from you what he created you
[1:01:21] for and he created you to worship him he
[1:01:25] didn't create you to worship your job he
[1:01:27] didn't create you to worship your spouse
[1:01:29] he didn't create you to worship the
[1:01:30] church he created you to worship him let
[1:01:34] me just say it like this he didn't even
[1:01:35] create you to worship another
[1:01:38] man but God created you to worship him
[1:01:41] and him
[1:01:43] alone listen what he says here he says
[1:01:45] now in the beginning God take that name
[1:01:48] God in the Hebrew we find it spelled l
[1:01:51] El Elohim which means the all
[1:01:53] self-existing one the all sufficient one
[1:01:56] the strong one there was nothing before
[1:01:59] that there was no air there was no stars
[1:02:02] there was no moisture there was no there
[1:02:04] was no atmosphere there was no atoms
[1:02:06] there was no molecules there was nothing
[1:02:08] before that that's right come on
[1:02:11] Church see it was God the Eternal one
[1:02:15] and in him were attributes to be a
[1:02:17] savior to be a father to be
[1:02:21] God a lot of times we hear Brother bam
[1:02:23] say you know God had these attributes to
[1:02:25] be healer and to be a deliverer and to
[1:02:28] be a savior and to be a father but we
[1:02:30] find here now he has even in this one he
[1:02:32] has an attribute to be God an object of
[1:02:37] worship and see he said then he wasn't
[1:02:39] God then he was just he was God but
[1:02:42] there was nothing else that could
[1:02:43] worship so God is an object of worship
[1:02:46] and there is nothing to worship him he
[1:02:48] wants to be worshiped that's his very
[1:02:51] nature is to be worshiped because he is
[1:02:54] God so we're we're going to look today
[1:02:56] and we're going to find out what really
[1:02:57] is
[1:02:59] worship and I'm not sending text
[1:03:01] messages I'm adjusting my volume just so
[1:03:03] everybody's
[1:03:04] aware I want y'all think I'm socializing
[1:03:07] up here as I preach but I got got to get
[1:03:09] this volume
[1:03:12] right he says here but being that he was
[1:03:16] God then there must be something to
[1:03:19] worship
[1:03:21] him because he loved worship
[1:03:26] I wonder if we can love worship worship
[1:03:29] to him as much as he loves to receive
[1:03:31] your
[1:03:32] worship he loves worship His Own being
[1:03:35] created creatures to worship him but
[1:03:38] then because that he was God he made the
[1:03:40] angels and the angels worshiped him
[1:03:43] notice when he made the Angels they were
[1:03:45] different than you and
[1:03:47] I everybody should have said amen unless
[1:03:50] you're consuming that you're a chair of
[1:03:51] them this morning and you got wings and
[1:03:53] you're ready to fly but notice we find
[1:03:56] in the scriptures that there were two
[1:03:57] Wings over their face two Wings over
[1:03:59] their feet and with two Wings they did
[1:04:01] fly and they were in the presence of God
[1:04:03] day and night crying holy holy holy unto
[1:04:06] God and yet that was creation and yet
[1:04:08] they became uh those that would worship
[1:04:10] God and now he was God now he was to be
[1:04:13] worshiped but yet there was something
[1:04:15] still missing there was something that
[1:04:17] God was still Desiring that the Angels
[1:04:20] couldn't
[1:04:21] provide God was looking for somebody God
[1:04:24] was looking for a man God was looking
[1:04:26] for creation that would love him from
[1:04:28] their own
[1:04:32] desires and many times we wonder what is
[1:04:35] my purpose in life brother Joe why am I
[1:04:37] here why did God create me he created
[1:04:40] you to worship
[1:04:43] him he created you to not just sit on a
[1:04:47] Pew not just to have a nice career and
[1:04:50] make a lot of money or drive fancy cars
[1:04:52] wear nice clothes have a thousand
[1:04:54] friends on Facebook Facebook or
[1:04:56] Instagram or SnapChat or Tik Tok or
[1:04:58] whatever it is but God created you and I
[1:05:02] to worship him and to him
[1:05:05] alone so the first thing he created
[1:05:08] though he created the Angels but there
[1:05:09] was something missing that the Angels
[1:05:11] didn't have see he placed the angels in
[1:05:14] an atmosphere or or uh not an atmosphere
[1:05:18] but the word I'm looking for just sking
[1:05:19] but they couldn't do anything but
[1:05:21] worship
[1:05:22] God but you and I he placed us free
[1:05:26] moral
[1:05:27] agents and that word free moral agency
[1:05:30] not to dumb it down but it means a free
[1:05:32] moral agent is someone who can
[1:05:35] understand right from wrong and
[1:05:36] therefore can be held responsible for
[1:05:39] their
[1:05:41] actions in addition they have free will
[1:05:44] to make their own decisions based on
[1:05:46] their understanding of ethical decisions
[1:05:49] and the prophet of God will tell us
[1:05:51] notice he says now in the beginning God
[1:05:54] know that man will fall therefore he
[1:05:56] could put him on free moral agency
[1:05:58] knowing because he could display his
[1:06:00] attributes to be a father to be a son to
[1:06:03] be a Healer to be a savior and he says
[1:06:05] notice that there was nothing lost there
[1:06:06] could be nothing saved and before there
[1:06:08] was an angel or a molecule or anything
[1:06:10] God was by himself alone but he wasn't
[1:06:13] God cuz God's an optical worship there
[1:06:15] was something in him for worship but
[1:06:17] nothing to worship him but the
[1:06:19] attributes were there and he had an
[1:06:21] attribute to be God and he wanted
[1:06:23] somebody to worship Him
[1:06:26] from a free moral agent
[1:06:29] standpoint he made man gave him free
[1:06:31] moral agency and he fell and then when
[1:06:34] he fell he became a savior and in the
[1:06:36] fall he took sickness so he become a
[1:06:38] Healer see it's displaying God's
[1:06:41] attributes all the time but
[1:06:44] God God created something in
[1:06:47] US therefore he created man in his own
[1:06:50] image for a
[1:06:52] purpose so that you and I can do what
[1:06:54] angels can
[1:06:57] do you know the Angels can't sing the
[1:07:00] song that we can
[1:07:02] sing the Angels can't sing the song of
[1:07:05] the redeemed they can't worship when
[1:07:07] we're on the other side to worship him
[1:07:09] they're going to stand around and watch
[1:07:11] as the host of of the redeemed are
[1:07:13] gathered together and we begin to
[1:07:15] worship God because what he done for us
[1:07:18] that he lifted us up out of the my clay
[1:07:21] he lifted us up out of Le de he took a
[1:07:23] bride in a ratcher and they're going to
[1:07:25] stand back because they don't understand
[1:07:27] what moves us and why we worship God the
[1:07:30] way we worship all that they can do is
[1:07:32] cry holy holy holy unto the Lord but you
[1:07:35] and I can fall down and worship God but
[1:07:38] for what he's done for us and who he is
[1:07:41] and who we are in God and God is
[1:07:43] Desiring your worship and the angels
[1:07:46] can't provide the worship that God
[1:07:48] desires from you this morning only you
[1:07:51] can give God what he desires a heart
[1:07:55] full of
[1:07:59] worship and see you and I have a
[1:08:02] choice the Angels don't have a choice in
[1:08:04] the
[1:08:05] matter you had a choice to come to
[1:08:07] church this
[1:08:09] morning many others had the same choice
[1:08:12] and we see a lot of seats
[1:08:14] vacant but you made your
[1:08:17] choice to come into the house of God to
[1:08:21] worship see we have a choice if we're
[1:08:24] going to serve him we got a choice this
[1:08:25] morning if you're going to worship
[1:08:28] him see every service you come you you
[1:08:30] can go through the formality but that
[1:08:33] not be
[1:08:35] worshiped you can dress you can put your
[1:08:38] smell good
[1:08:39] on you can get your hair all did up did
[1:08:42] up y'all like how I said
[1:08:44] that come all your pumping fashion got
[1:08:46] your new dress
[1:08:48] woo your new suit your new tie your good
[1:08:51] look your new buzz on your haircut you
[1:08:53] can come with all that and still not be
[1:08:58] worshiping oh you may say Amen or you
[1:09:01] may sing the songs but something in your
[1:09:04] heart is
[1:09:05] lacking we're going to get deeper into
[1:09:07] this but notice see worship has to be a
[1:09:11] revelation a worship has to be something
[1:09:13] that's revealed to you what pleases
[1:09:17] God not what pleases you because all of
[1:09:21] us are different and the house said amen
[1:09:26] you know none of you are like me and I'm
[1:09:27] not like a lot of you but yet we're all
[1:09:29] nature different we got different
[1:09:31] personalities some of you are extroverts
[1:09:33] some of you have introverts some of you
[1:09:34] are just
[1:09:36] verts you got it somewhere in between
[1:09:39] but we're all
[1:09:41] different but yet God has required all
[1:09:44] of us in all our differences and how
[1:09:46] we're made notice worship is a denial of
[1:09:51] self well brother Joe it's not my nature
[1:09:54] well I know not your nature but God
[1:09:56] don't care about your nature God is
[1:09:59] Desiring your
[1:10:00] worship God is Desiring you to lay
[1:10:03] yourself down bow yourself humble
[1:10:05] yourself when you come into the presence
[1:10:07] of God and offer him what he
[1:10:10] desires well it's just not in me to
[1:10:13] shout it's not in me to just dance
[1:10:16] around and it's not all about emotion I
[1:10:19] get that we're going to go a little bit
[1:10:21] further but notice worship is a
[1:10:24] revelation we go back to Cain and Abel
[1:10:27] the two brothers and we find that Abel
[1:10:29] offered unto God a more excellent
[1:10:32] sacrifice why because he didn't have a
[1:10:35] Bible that told him what he needed to
[1:10:37] do he didn't have blueprints he didn't
[1:10:39] have somebody there standing over his
[1:10:40] shoulder you need to do this this and
[1:10:42] this but no it was a revelation it was
[1:10:44] revealed to Abel what pleased God and so
[1:10:48] he brought to God what it was and we
[1:10:51] find Cain he followed what his brother
[1:10:53] did he did exactly he presented an altar
[1:10:55] came to church he dressed right he read
[1:10:57] the same scriptures he you know he sang
[1:10:59] out of the same song book but he did
[1:11:01] what he thought pleased God and he did
[1:11:03] he brought the fruit of the ground
[1:11:05] versus the lamb versus blood and we find
[1:11:08] that he God was not pleased with Cain's
[1:11:11] worship so if God only required worship
[1:11:15] then he was unjust to condemn Cain but
[1:11:17] God requires the right kind of
[1:11:21] worship God desires those to worship Him
[1:11:25] to do it in spirit and in truth not in
[1:11:29] formality see true worship has a
[1:11:32] foundation and that Foundation is a
[1:11:34] revelation and it's by faith that we
[1:11:36] walk by faith amen so when you worship
[1:11:39] when your worship is more than just
[1:11:40] coming to the church or going to special
[1:11:43] meetings when your worship is more than
[1:11:45] just professing to be a Christian or a
[1:11:47] good person see your wor got to be
[1:11:48] something that's revealed to you that
[1:11:50] you're a son and daughter of God and you
[1:11:53] know who he is and because you know know
[1:11:55] who he is then you know who you are and
[1:11:58] when you know your relationship with God
[1:12:00] then you can honor offer God a honest
[1:12:03] Heart of
[1:12:04] Worship cuz you're not worried am I
[1:12:06] saved am I not saved am I filled am I
[1:12:08] not filled am I a son or a daughter am I
[1:12:10] not a son or daughter of God you know
[1:12:12] your position you know your place see
[1:12:14] the true worship is to know who God is
[1:12:17] he's not a god of
[1:12:19] History where we find him only on the
[1:12:21] shores of Galilee and he did great
[1:12:23] Miracles 2,000 plus years ago but yet we
[1:12:26] can't reach that God
[1:12:29] today yet he doesn't hear our prayers
[1:12:31] today yet he's not with us today he
[1:12:34] still is among
[1:12:35] us see he's not a god of man's making
[1:12:39] where he's limited by what he can do
[1:12:41] because of man's
[1:12:43] limitations you find today many
[1:12:45] preachers were
[1:12:47] guilty we want to put God in a box many
[1:12:50] people we're Believers we're guils we
[1:12:52] want to put God in a box say he can only
[1:12:54] do thus thus
[1:12:56] does but in the messages identify Christ
[1:12:58] of all ages the prophet of God will tell
[1:13:00] us now we do believe that God can do
[1:13:02] things that's not written in his word
[1:13:04] because he's
[1:13:06] God he does whatever he
[1:13:10] wishes so who are we as man to limit God
[1:13:14] in what God can do just because we may
[1:13:16] have never seen it happen
[1:13:19] before so he's a Creator and he desires
[1:13:23] your worship he Desir desires your
[1:13:26] adoration he desires your
[1:13:30] praise and they that will worship God
[1:13:33] will do it in spirit and in truth they
[1:13:36] don't bring to him what they think might
[1:13:39] please
[1:13:41] him not how many scriptures you
[1:13:44] memorized not how many times you read
[1:13:46] the Bible through and through and that
[1:13:47] is good not how many church services you
[1:13:50] came to before you miss one you know God
[1:13:52] ain't looking at your church attendance
[1:13:53] but you need to attend church
[1:13:55] we go ahead and put that out there see
[1:13:58] it's not an intellectual understanding
[1:14:00] but it's a revelation God has reveal to
[1:14:03] your heart how you can please him how
[1:14:07] you can serve him how you need to
[1:14:09] worship him and it's a spirit revealed
[1:14:12] worship notice when he was met the woman
[1:14:15] at the well we go to John 4 and verse 19
[1:14:17] this
[1:14:19] morning John 4:19 the woman saith unto
[1:14:22] him sir I perceive that thou art a
[1:14:24] prophet so she
[1:14:26] recognized that there was something
[1:14:28] different about this
[1:14:30] man she says our fathers Worship in this
[1:14:33] mountain and ye say that in Jerusalem is
[1:14:36] a place where men ought to
[1:14:38] worship and Jesus said unto her woman
[1:14:41] believe me the hour cometh when you
[1:14:43] shall neither worship or when you shall
[1:14:45] neither in this mountain nor yet at
[1:14:47] Jerusalem worship the father you worship
[1:14:50] you know know what but we worship what
[1:14:53] but we know what we worship for
[1:14:54] salvation is of the Jews but the hour
[1:14:57] cometh and now is when the true
[1:14:58] worshippers shall worship the father in
[1:15:01] spirit and in truth for the father
[1:15:03] seeketh such to worship
[1:15:06] Him verse 24 and God is the spirit and
[1:15:09] they that worship Him must worship Him
[1:15:11] in spirit and in
[1:15:15] truth and I believe that this is the
[1:15:17] hour that Jesus was speaking
[1:15:19] of the hour cometh and now is notice she
[1:15:25] tried to point worship to a mountain
[1:15:27] tried to point it to a certain location
[1:15:29] tried to point it to well you got to do
[1:15:30] it this way and you got to be legalistic
[1:15:33] about it and you can't worship God
[1:15:34] freely and this is what we've been
[1:15:36] taught this is where we've been taught
[1:15:37] but Jesus trying to get her attention
[1:15:39] off of that he's trying to show her it's
[1:15:41] not in a mountain somewhere it's not in
[1:15:44] Jeffersonville it's not in Nashville
[1:15:46] it's not in streetport Louisiana but
[1:15:48] those that worship God must do it in
[1:15:51] spirit and in truth and take the
[1:15:53] location out of it take take the
[1:15:55] denomination off of it take the ideas
[1:15:57] and creas and dogmas off of it and
[1:15:59] worship God the way God desires to be
[1:16:03] worshiped see now is that day now is the
[1:16:06] age where the spirit that was poured out
[1:16:08] on the day of Pentecost has once again
[1:16:10] been poured out on the end time bride
[1:16:12] and the truth that's been lost down
[1:16:14] through Seven Ages has now been finally
[1:16:16] tied all together all the loose sins of
[1:16:19] the scriptures had been tied together to
[1:16:21] make one glorious message and today we
[1:16:24] find finally have the spirit and the
[1:16:26] truth come again now there's a people in
[1:16:29] the land now there's a bride on the
[1:16:31] scene that can worship God not in a
[1:16:34] location but in spirit and in
[1:16:37] truth cuz they see God in his word and
[1:16:40] the truth lines up to the word and he
[1:16:42] says I am the word and I am the truth
[1:16:45] and I am the life that's what we're here
[1:16:47] to worship we're not here to worship man
[1:16:50] and man's ideas but we're here to
[1:16:52] worship
[1:16:53] God and God created you for such
[1:17:00] worship he created
[1:17:02] you brother R would tell us whatever the
[1:17:05] spirit of God leads you to do he won't
[1:17:08] lead you to do anything but what's
[1:17:11] right he's the spirit and God is the
[1:17:14] spirit and they that worship Him must
[1:17:16] worship Him in spirit and in
[1:17:20] truth notice so God likes to be
[1:17:23] worshiped well it's not my
[1:17:26] nature God likes to be
[1:17:30] worshiped well I done heard that song
[1:17:32] Too Many Times God likes to be worshiped
[1:17:36] well I'm not feeling good today God oh
[1:17:40] come
[1:17:42] on God likes to be
[1:17:46] worshiped but if you just knew what I
[1:17:48] was going through it doesn't matter God
[1:17:51] likes to be worshiped
[1:17:55] I wonder sometimes if we can take our
[1:17:57] eyes and our our minds and all the gigl
[1:18:01] and all that out of just coming to the
[1:18:04] house of God and passing notes and
[1:18:05] chatting with our neighbor and maybe
[1:18:07] giggling and laughing because something
[1:18:08] may be funny and just really set all
[1:18:10] that aside and worship
[1:18:13] God not just during the song service or
[1:18:16] during the special or when somebody
[1:18:18] cracks up cracks up cracks and maybe the
[1:18:21] special don't go the way it should and
[1:18:23] we just kind of giggle and laugh that's
[1:18:24] not worship that's not pleasing to God
[1:18:26] at all but God is looking for men and
[1:18:29] women Sons and Daughters to worship Him
[1:18:32] and come in and create an atmosphere
[1:18:34] where it's not on some man it's not on
[1:18:35] some song leader it's not on some
[1:18:37] preacher but you come with a heart so
[1:18:40] full of love and you can't wait to
[1:18:42] worship God and to pour out your worship
[1:18:45] into the presence of almighty God so
[1:18:47] that God can come by and bless you and
[1:18:50] your sacrifice
[1:18:55] I wonder if the message has come too
[1:18:56] common to
[1:18:58] us that your neighbor too common that
[1:19:01] our church is too common that the
[1:19:04] ministry has become so
[1:19:07] common so we don't recognize the
[1:19:11] opportunity that's given us when we come
[1:19:13] into the house of God this ain't about
[1:19:16] me this ain't about Tim puit Timothy
[1:19:19] puit Aaron it ain't about none of you
[1:19:21] it's about
[1:19:22] him and there's one thing that God does
[1:19:24] desires out of each of us you may be
[1:19:27] rich you may be poor you may be Skin and
[1:19:29] Bones you may be fat and happy I don't
[1:19:31] know we you may have hair not hair but
[1:19:33] it doesn't matter we got all our
[1:19:34] differences but God desires one
[1:19:37] thing from every heart in this building
[1:19:39] and those on the stream and those out
[1:19:41] there from his bride he desires
[1:19:44] worship and he Longs for it and those
[1:19:48] that the father seeketh must worship him
[1:19:52] there's no choice they must worship ship
[1:19:54] him in spirit and in truth that's
[1:20:01] right brother R would say this and I
[1:20:03] think this is just so so
[1:20:06] pertinent we can exercise our faith in
[1:20:09] him believe it and not be ashamed to
[1:20:11] tell others about it that Jesus Christ
[1:20:13] raised from the dead lives and Reigns in
[1:20:15] the hearts and we're not ashamed of it
[1:20:17] doesn't that make your face or don't
[1:20:19] does it make your face R to testify the
[1:20:21] glory of Jesus Christ for he is worthy
[1:20:24] of all
[1:20:25] praise don't you believe that that he's
[1:20:28] worthy of all
[1:20:30] praise so God likes to be worship His CH
[1:20:34] his children that we can be free notice
[1:20:37] we can be free and not bound down by
[1:20:41] yolks do you realize today that you can
[1:20:44] let somebody's critical view of your
[1:20:47] worship be a Yol to
[1:20:50] you or you can let some man's idea how a
[1:20:53] service should be
[1:20:57] conducted be a yoke to you and bind you
[1:20:59] and quench the spirit of
[1:21:02] God I understand there's some of us that
[1:21:05] are very emotional there's some of us
[1:21:07] that are not
[1:21:09] emotional but never should we come into
[1:21:11] the house of God and be critical and let
[1:21:13] that become a yoke to quench the spirit
[1:21:16] and the movement of God when God has
[1:21:18] desire and
[1:21:20] worship see that we when we worship God
[1:21:23] has got to be done in the right way not
[1:21:24] fussing over who's right who's wrong my
[1:21:28] interpretation of the scriptures versus
[1:21:30] your interpretation of the scriptures
[1:21:32] God is his own interpreter of the
[1:21:33] scriptures and God does it by bringing
[1:21:35] it to pass we're not fussing over uh
[1:21:38] denominational ideas but we love
[1:21:41] God and when this woman at the well came
[1:21:44] she pointed to a place and a lot of
[1:21:47] times we want to point to something or
[1:21:49] somebody some event something and this
[1:21:51] is where we got it and you know what
[1:21:52] when we leave off from there this is
[1:21:54] where I met God and she's noticing here
[1:21:56] so to her worship was a
[1:21:59] law we have to do it over there in that
[1:22:03] mountain we can only worship God in
[1:22:05] Jeffersonville we can only worship God
[1:22:07] in Tucson we can only worship God at
[1:22:10] even like T we can only worship God if
[1:22:12] you get my
[1:22:15] tapes come on
[1:22:17] now know we try to point to some
[1:22:19] location but but God's omnipresent God's
[1:22:23] everywhere now he ain't worried about
[1:22:25] some specific location the same God
[1:22:28] that's moving here this morning is the
[1:22:30] same God that's moving in Virginia the
[1:22:32] same one that's moving in Ohio he's the
[1:22:34] same one that's moving around the world
[1:22:35] and God is seeking worshippers to
[1:22:38] worship Him in spirit get your minds off
[1:22:40] a location get your minds off your
[1:22:42] favorite preacher get your minds off
[1:22:44] your favorite church and get your minds
[1:22:46] on Christ Jesus and over him a Heart of
[1:22:50] Worship that's what he's hungering for
[1:22:52] this morning
[1:22:54] see this mount gism it was just a little
[1:22:57] away from Saar which is where the
[1:22:59] Samaritans worship and on this mountain
[1:23:01] they built a temple somewhat similar to
[1:23:03] the one in Jerusalem Jacob built an
[1:23:05] altar on this mountain and he worshiped
[1:23:07] God there they said that send ballot by
[1:23:11] the permission of Alexander Great he
[1:23:12] built a temple upon Mount
[1:23:15] Garrison so she can point to this is
[1:23:17] where these things happen this is where
[1:23:20] Jacob built an altar or Jacob built a
[1:23:22] yeah an altar there and send bot he
[1:23:24] built a temple there but God was trying
[1:23:26] to show her get your eyes off a location
[1:23:29] get your eyes off a man and look at the
[1:23:32] one that's in front of you we find in
[1:23:35] John 4:10 Jesus answered and he said
[1:23:37] unto her if thou knewest the gift of
[1:23:40] God if thou knewest the gift of God and
[1:23:43] who it was that saith to thee give me a
[1:23:45] drink thou wouldest have asked of him
[1:23:48] and he would give thee Living Water so
[1:23:51] he's trying to direct her
[1:23:53] attention off of a location get her eyes
[1:23:57] off of some denomination get her eyes
[1:23:59] off some some certain sex some certain
[1:24:01] religious belief some specific tradition
[1:24:04] that's been passed down from generation
[1:24:06] to generation and get her to focus on
[1:24:08] the one in whose pres she's
[1:24:12] in but those that worship God must
[1:24:14] worship and recognize him in his present
[1:24:17] form not just your outward action not
[1:24:21] just your forms and the gifts that you
[1:24:22] bring to God but Spirit allow the spirit
[1:24:27] to
[1:24:28] move don't quench the Holy Spirit when
[1:24:31] it comes by and it nudges you to to do
[1:24:35] something there's some of you that's
[1:24:37] missed the moving of the spirit because
[1:24:39] of your Humanity cuz maybe you're
[1:24:41] worried about what your neighbor going
[1:24:43] to think about it maybe you're worried
[1:24:45] about you know what they're going to say
[1:24:47] on the live stream we don't care what
[1:24:49] they say on any
[1:24:50] stream he desires worship
[1:24:55] when there feels to be a a tongue go
[1:24:57] forth we need to yield learn to yield to
[1:24:59] it that's worship unto God and an
[1:25:01] interpretation is a worship unto God or
[1:25:03] anything that God leads you to do the
[1:25:06] prophet of God said the spirit will not
[1:25:07] lead you to do anything that's wrong
[1:25:09] that's but he's pulling on you to
[1:25:12] worship Him and your worship will be
[1:25:14] different than your neighbor's
[1:25:17] worship Sister Jenny I love you but you
[1:25:19] and I worship completely
[1:25:22] different Say Amen
[1:25:24] amen we worship
[1:25:27] different now the only one closest to
[1:25:29] worship like me in here is probably my
[1:25:31] Rebecca she got a lot of Joe Adams in
[1:25:34] her but we're all different we're all
[1:25:39] unique
[1:25:40] right and we're going to get into a
[1:25:42] little bit more but worship is a denial
[1:25:44] of self yes where it ain't about you yes
[1:25:50] it's about laying yourself down your
[1:25:52] ideas down your Humanity down stepping
[1:25:55] aside from your nature well it ain't in
[1:25:58] me to do that yes it is God put it there
[1:26:02] God placed it there God put in every
[1:26:04] human being a desire for worship God
[1:26:08] created you for that purpose and that
[1:26:10] purpose alone maybe not alone but he
[1:26:12] created you to worship so that you can
[1:26:14] be he could be a loving father he can be
[1:26:16] a faithful high priest he can be a
[1:26:18] wonderful deliver he can be all that you
[1:26:20] have need of and you can worship him not
[1:26:23] with just pray praise and adoration but
[1:26:25] from a
[1:26:26] heart from your heart you know you find
[1:26:30] young people today they want to go to
[1:26:32] Every camp meeting there is and hey
[1:26:33] praise God for that but the heart's
[1:26:35] still not
[1:26:36] right why chase a camp if your heart
[1:26:38] ain't in
[1:26:40] it God is looking for people to worship
[1:26:45] him see worship must be done in spirit
[1:26:48] in a spiritual way not some legalistic
[1:26:52] View
[1:26:56] okay not some legalistic man-made idea
[1:26:59] it can only be this we got to listen to
[1:27:01] Southern gospel
[1:27:02] music oh my goodness you going to have a
[1:27:05] hard time in Africa with Southern
[1:27:09] gospel I've been to Africa they don't
[1:27:11] play southern gospel
[1:27:12] folks they have their own worship and
[1:27:15] let me tell you and it's pleasing unto
[1:27:17] the Lord it's completely different than
[1:27:19] our worship the music is got a holy a
[1:27:22] whole completely different being to it
[1:27:25] but yet God comes down God anoints it
[1:27:27] God shows up God drops down the Holy
[1:27:29] Spirit floods the place there's been the
[1:27:31] presence of the Angel of the Lord the
[1:27:33] pillar of fire in their services and
[1:27:35] you're telling me that it can only be
[1:27:37] done through southern gospel or through
[1:27:39] the reading of the the read him book and
[1:27:41] this book and that book God will be
[1:27:43] praised by somebody with a Heart of
[1:27:45] Worship and when you truly worship God
[1:27:47] the way he desire his presence will fill
[1:27:50] the place his presence will fill the
[1:27:53] place and God will come on The Scene It
[1:27:56] Ain't About location it ain't about our
[1:27:58] ideas it ain't about a certain music or
[1:28:01] a certain genre it's about worshiping
[1:28:03] him the King of Kings and the Lord of
[1:28:09] lords I even got babies screaming
[1:28:12] Hallelujah they know it's the
[1:28:16] truth speaking in tongues we got no
[1:28:18] interpreter for that this morning
[1:28:24] so don't try to put God in a
[1:28:26] box and say we got to do this this way
[1:28:30] and it's got to be this way and it's got
[1:28:32] to be this
[1:28:33] way God can do things that's not even
[1:28:36] written in the
[1:28:39] word that shows he's a bigger God than
[1:28:41] we
[1:28:42] are so why limit why limit
[1:28:47] God so there's a vast difference we're
[1:28:49] going to go on a little further a lot
[1:28:51] further we only got one service today
[1:28:53] that's right
[1:28:57] so we must Worship the Lord
[1:28:59] Jesus not by our physical appearance
[1:29:02] well I looked apart you know I don't
[1:29:05] wear skinny jeans brother Joe not
[1:29:08] wearing necklaces and not wearing
[1:29:09] bracelets and you know I look like a
[1:29:11] mess believer like a real Son of God to
[1:29:13] look you know I don't wear tight tops
[1:29:16] and split skirts I look like a mess
[1:29:18] sister should
[1:29:19] look but if it's not done with the heart
[1:29:22] it deviates from TRU
[1:29:24] worship cuz you're trying to place it on
[1:29:26] a formality and God don't want
[1:29:29] formality God wants a heart that's full
[1:29:33] of
[1:29:35] worship so there's a difference between
[1:29:38] praise and praising
[1:29:40] God we're going to go down this road and
[1:29:43] worship in worshiping God so the Bible
[1:29:46] tells us in Hebrews 13 and verse1 15 if
[1:29:49] you have your Bibles you can turn there
[1:29:50] or they can put it up on the screen by
[1:29:53] him therefore let us offer the
[1:29:54] sacrifices of praise to God
[1:29:57] continually the fruit of our lips giving
[1:30:00] thanks to his name so praise is a thank
[1:30:05] offering see it's a sacrifice the
[1:30:08] sacrifice of praise is the fruit of your
[1:30:11] lips but worship is the fruit of your
[1:30:15] heart two different
[1:30:18] places worship is about love and
[1:30:20] appreciation praise is about an outward
[1:30:23] communication from actions praise is
[1:30:26] joyful recounting of all that God has
[1:30:28] done for you whether you realize it or
[1:30:30] not you can praise God but yet not be
[1:30:33] worshiping God but you can never worship
[1:30:37] God and not be praising
[1:30:39] him did you hear that you can be
[1:30:43] praising God but not be worshiping but
[1:30:46] if you ever found worshiping God you
[1:30:48] will be praising him you will be
[1:30:51] shouting The Joy Bells you will be in
[1:30:54] moved by the spirit of God however it
[1:30:56] leads you cannot worship God but what
[1:30:59] you can't praise him for what he's done
[1:31:01] for
[1:31:01] you the Bible says in Luke 6 verse 45 a
[1:31:05] good man out of the good Treasure of his
[1:31:07] heart bringeth forth that which is good
[1:31:09] and an evil man out of the evil Treasure
[1:31:12] of his heart bringeth forth that which
[1:31:14] is evil for out of the abundance of the
[1:31:16] heart the mouth
[1:31:19] speaketh so if inside of your heart is
[1:31:21] full of love inside of your heart is
[1:31:24] full of goodness inside of your heart is
[1:31:25] full of worship you can't help but the
[1:31:28] Praises of God begin to flow
[1:31:31] out but if it ain't there you'll just
[1:31:34] Praise on and praise on there'll be
[1:31:36] nothing really worshiping God so excuse
[1:31:39] me praise is closely intertwined with
[1:31:42] Thanksgiving as we offer back to God an
[1:31:46] appreciation and appreciation for his
[1:31:49] mighty works on our behalf praise can be
[1:31:52] given to
[1:31:54] another you can praise your pastor for
[1:31:59] faithfulness for all these years of
[1:32:01] being a Godly servant you can praise
[1:32:03] your parents for being good stewards and
[1:32:05] good parents you can praise the paper
[1:32:07] boy for dropping off your paper every
[1:32:10] day see you can praise your friends you
[1:32:12] can praise your boss but you see praise
[1:32:15] doesn't require anything of
[1:32:17] us see it's just a truthful
[1:32:20] acknowledgment of the righteous acts of
[1:32:22] another but worship belongs to God and
[1:32:26] God Alone we find that worship comes
[1:32:30] from a different place within our
[1:32:31] Spirits we look here in Luke 4 and verse
[1:32:33] 8 Jesus answered and he said unto him
[1:32:36] get thee behind me Satan for it is
[1:32:38] written that thou shalt Worship the Lord
[1:32:40] thy God and him only shall thou worship
[1:32:44] so worship only belongs to
[1:32:48] God see worship is the art and I want to
[1:32:51] capitalize on this this morning worship
[1:32:53] is is the art of losing oneself in the
[1:32:56] Adoration of
[1:32:58] another worship is the
[1:33:01] art of losing
[1:33:03] oneself in the Adoration of another how
[1:33:07] many have ever watched a football game
[1:33:09] baseball game some kind of game I know
[1:33:12] y'all trying to be cherubs this morning
[1:33:13] but hey we
[1:33:16] human and your team come from behind 20
[1:33:20] points you didn't just sit there like
[1:33:22] this did you
[1:33:26] no what happened come on somebody
[1:33:29] brother help me out come on now man your
[1:33:31] team was behind 20 points man you lost
[1:33:34] yourself when they started coming back
[1:33:36] and they finally won the game and went
[1:33:39] on to the Conference Finals or went on
[1:33:41] to the championship you completely lost
[1:33:44] yourself there well if we can lose
[1:33:47] ourself in a ball game if we can lose
[1:33:49] oursel out there in the world why can't
[1:33:51] we lose oursel in the house of God why
[1:33:54] can't we lose ourselves into worshiping
[1:33:58] him he's the one that's worthy to be
[1:34:01] worshiped we got to have the act of
[1:34:03] losing ourself and putting God first and
[1:34:09] foremost well it's not my nature I'm so
[1:34:12] sick of hearing my
[1:34:15] nature the art of losing oneself lose
[1:34:20] your nature into an atmosphere of
[1:34:23] worship that's
[1:34:25] Hallelujah well brother tell I'm a I'm
[1:34:27] an
[1:34:28] introvert okay I am too
[1:34:30] 50/50 50% of the time I'm an introvert I
[1:34:33] people out quick I have to go on up to
[1:34:36] the upstairs then there's time I'm an
[1:34:38] extrovert I like to have a house
[1:34:41] full but it's the art of losing oneself
[1:34:45] into the Adoration of
[1:34:47] God and we come we so stuffed amen I've
[1:34:52] been look I I'm not trying to say this
[1:34:54] to be ugly but I've been coming to this
[1:34:56] church for 25 plus years I've still not
[1:35:00] seen some of you ever
[1:35:01] move and I don't mean that to be funny
[1:35:04] amen but what about
[1:35:06] worship God has sent us a Vindicated
[1:35:10] message and it should move you to
[1:35:12] recognize who you are that you can see
[1:35:14] your name on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:35:16] like John saw his name John wasn't
[1:35:19] afraid in the presence of 24 Angels or
[1:35:21] 24 Elders to fall down and worship God
[1:35:24] he had big time men around him or big
[1:35:26] time people and yet he fell prostrate
[1:35:29] and begin to worship God because there
[1:35:31] was a lame that was slain that was
[1:35:33] worthy to be praised and John said I'm
[1:35:35] not going to let somebody else take my
[1:35:37] place I'm not going to let some tree
[1:35:39] clap in my place I'm not going to let
[1:35:41] some bird sing in my place I'm going to
[1:35:44] give God my worship and everything in
[1:35:46] heaven and everything in the earth and
[1:35:48] everything below there they heard I talk
[1:35:51] shouting and screaming and answer and
[1:35:54] worshiping my God because he has he
[1:35:57] alone is worthy and if God can do it
[1:36:00] what about the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:36:03] John is a representation of that
[1:36:06] bride am I'm I'm not saying we got to
[1:36:08] get all emotional worked up but I'm
[1:36:10] trying to show you got to put your
[1:36:12] nature aside and give God what he
[1:36:15] desires and wake up and Worship the
[1:36:19] Lord hallelujah he deserves your worship
[1:36:24] he
[1:36:25] desires your
[1:36:28] worship see
[1:36:31] worship is saying not my will but
[1:36:35] yours be
[1:36:38] done oh well it's not my nature brother
[1:36:40] Joe just not made like
[1:36:42] you well but worship is not about you
[1:36:48] that's right it's not about your makeup
[1:36:51] it's not about your nature it's about
[1:36:56] him and what you are here is what you're
[1:37:00] going to be
[1:37:04] there come on somebody what you are here
[1:37:08] is what you're going to be
[1:37:10] there I'm not even going to ask some of
[1:37:13] you what you think you're going to
[1:37:15] be but let me tell you if I seen them
[1:37:18] streets I can't wait one day I will see
[1:37:20] it I'm not just going to walk brother
[1:37:22] Jonathan
[1:37:24] oh bless God I made it on the streets
[1:37:26] ago I'm going to be dancing like a fool
[1:37:28] on them streets cuz I made it I made it
[1:37:32] through Lea I made it through the muck
[1:37:34] of the world I made it through I made it
[1:37:37] I made it through this world that we
[1:37:39] living in I made it I'm going to worship
[1:37:41] God and what I am there I am here I'm a
[1:37:44] worshiper of the one to God I don't need
[1:37:48] streets are go now but one day what I'm
[1:37:51] doing here I'm going to do there I'm I'm
[1:37:53] going to dance my way I'm going to
[1:37:55] praise my way I'm going to worship him
[1:37:57] because he desires My Worship and I
[1:38:01] created for it and you're created for it
[1:38:03] this
[1:38:06] morning you're created for worship
[1:38:11] amen see
[1:38:14] worship worship gets to the
[1:38:16] heart of who we are praise can be a part
[1:38:20] of worship but worship goes beyond
[1:38:23] praise
[1:38:24] praise is
[1:38:25] easy all of y'all came
[1:38:28] in many of y'all sang when brother Mike
[1:38:31] was leading Us in worship this
[1:38:35] morning but to
[1:38:37] worship all together
[1:38:40] different some of you your mouth ain't
[1:38:43] open
[1:38:45] yet I'm not not trying to be ugly cuz
[1:38:48] worship comes from a different
[1:38:52] place worship is a sacrifice
[1:38:55] yes anybody can sing while everybody's
[1:38:58] singing but what about those certain
[1:39:00] times when you don't feel like it you
[1:39:02] had a bad day you and the MS don't look
[1:39:05] at me brother H you and the misses done
[1:39:07] got in a squabble and them kids and done
[1:39:09] got all turned out man they make you
[1:39:10] want to just put them off on side the
[1:39:12] road that stop
[1:39:13] sign we all been there parents say Amen
[1:39:17] oh yeah some of y'all truthful some of
[1:39:18] y'all got a lying Spirit on
[1:39:21] you but no
[1:39:24] you
[1:39:24] come you can praise God oh yeah but when
[1:39:27] the word's going for we
[1:39:30] just we nod God ain't looking for
[1:39:34] nodders I'm not trying to beat you up
[1:39:36] make you emotional I'm just trying to
[1:39:38] get you to be
[1:39:41] worshippers because worship is the
[1:39:43] denial of
[1:39:45] self deny how you feel deny what you
[1:39:49] think you know sometimes you got to deny
[1:39:51] to even shut your mouth
[1:39:54] cuz some of us just want to open
[1:39:55] up Let It All fly out but true worship
[1:39:59] is knowing when to shut
[1:40:01] up want to just be quiet when just sit
[1:40:05] back and watch God let God do his thing
[1:40:08] I believe God can do more in a church
[1:40:10] service than what we can try to do by
[1:40:12] putting our own little filtrations on it
[1:40:14] and this one on it move this one do this
[1:40:15] one all this let God do
[1:40:19] it but when we're here Church we're
[1:40:21] going to spend two or three hours on on
[1:40:23] a Sunday in the house of God we're going
[1:40:24] to spend two hours on a Wednesday night
[1:40:27] why can't we come with a heart that's so
[1:40:30] glad if you look out there and you look
[1:40:33] at the world you look at the conditions
[1:40:34] that's laying around we got this
[1:40:35] homosexual agenda and this agenda and
[1:40:38] this world generation and people by God
[1:40:40] they don't even know who they are today
[1:40:42] and yet you got your sound mind God's
[1:40:45] put a desire in your heart to worship
[1:40:47] Him can't we just break away from our
[1:40:49] society for a few hours and give God
[1:40:52] what he deserves amen give God what he
[1:40:54] wants from you he created you for that
[1:40:58] purpose see worship gets to the heart of
[1:41:02] who we are worship requires you to deny
[1:41:05] yourself deny how you feel deny what you
[1:41:10] think see to truly worship God you have
[1:41:14] to let go of self
[1:41:16] worship so you got to let go of your
[1:41:19] pride well brother
[1:41:21] Joe now you got to let go of your pride
[1:41:24] got to let go of your
[1:41:25] arrogance news flash can I give you CNN
[1:41:29] just be in it ain't about
[1:41:32] you it ain't about you I know that's
[1:41:35] shocking but it's not about us it's
[1:41:38] about
[1:41:40] him see let go of what others may say
[1:41:43] about
[1:41:44] you I like what brother Timothy brought
[1:41:46] out let go Faith to let go to let go and
[1:41:50] do what when Peter stepped out on that
[1:41:53] Bo that was a step of Faith cuz he
[1:41:56] inside of him he wanted to worship Jesus
[1:41:59] Christ and so we must be willing to
[1:42:02] Humble ourselves before God surrender
[1:42:04] every part of our Lives to his control
[1:42:06] and adore him for who he is not just
[1:42:10] what he does for
[1:42:11] us see worship is a
[1:42:17] lifestyle back when I was 17 18 19 I was
[1:42:22] 2 20 lb 5 foot
[1:42:25] nothing I was a rly
[1:42:29] poly yeah I'm glad y'all didn't know me
[1:42:31] back
[1:42:33] then but when I was in my freshman year
[1:42:35] in college I lost 70 pounds in three
[1:42:38] months he said brother why you telling
[1:42:40] us telling us this because I made a
[1:42:42] lifestyle
[1:42:45] change brother Jackson I don't eat the
[1:42:47] same things I used to eat or maybe I do
[1:42:50] but I don't eat as much because I made a
[1:42:52] change
[1:42:53] I made a conscious effort to keep my
[1:42:55] weight
[1:42:57] off and so worship is a lifestyle it's
[1:43:01] not just some fad that we go through at
[1:43:03] some camp meeting or some special
[1:43:04] services when everybody's there and your
[1:43:06] favorite friends are there and your
[1:43:08] favorite preachers there and all a
[1:43:09] sudden you can get behind
[1:43:12] that no but worship is no matter if
[1:43:14] you're on the Mountaintop you can
[1:43:16] worship God whether you're in the valley
[1:43:18] you can worship God whether you're
[1:43:20] facing a fiery furnace you can worship
[1:43:22] God and say we not Bend we not bow we
[1:43:25] not break down we not give into this
[1:43:27] worldly condition oh but our God is able
[1:43:30] our God is able and we're going to
[1:43:32] worship that God we're not worried about
[1:43:34] you Nebuchadnezzar we're going to
[1:43:36] worship the one true Living God whether
[1:43:39] you're facing a de allance it doesn't
[1:43:41] matter oh King I'm going to see you in
[1:43:44] the morning I'm going to see you on the
[1:43:45] other side I'm going to worship my way
[1:43:47] through this
[1:43:50] Valley whether you're whether you're
[1:43:52] blind like barus you can scream out thou
[1:43:56] son of David have mercy on
[1:43:58] me or maybe you're like the Rich Young
[1:44:01] Ruler or maybe Lazarus and you ain't got
[1:44:03] a penny to your name but you know that
[1:44:06] God supplies all all my
[1:44:09] needs according to his riches and
[1:44:13] Glory see that's worship when you can
[1:44:16] thank God in the bad times you can
[1:44:19] praise God on the good times but worship
[1:44:22] comes from the heart
[1:44:23] and God is seeking those he says in John
[1:44:26] 4:24 the hour cometh and now
[1:44:30] is now is this is the day this is the
[1:44:33] age where the bride of Christ will
[1:44:35] worship him for who he is that's
[1:44:39] right and that's what the father seeks
[1:44:42] so true worship is focused only on the
[1:44:45] father not on self not on specific
[1:44:48] doctrines or
[1:44:50] dogmas denominations it's only f focus
[1:44:53] on the father and notice it's not just
[1:44:57] having the mechanics of it well we got
[1:45:00] the word we got the word we got the word
[1:45:02] we got the word praise God you got the
[1:45:04] word but you ain't got no life in
[1:45:08] it and it's more than just having all
[1:45:11] the spirit all the shout and you're
[1:45:13] running around like a bunch of heathens
[1:45:15] running around just circle circle circle
[1:45:17] and you got nothing you're running
[1:45:19] without a
[1:45:20] message but spirit worship true worship
[1:45:24] is done with mechanics and
[1:45:27] Dynamics amen listen what the prophet
[1:45:29] says he he said mechanics don't run the
[1:45:31] church it's the Dynamics the holy ghost
[1:45:35] that gets into this word it's not
[1:45:37] Seminary that teaches you all the
[1:45:39] Theology and Greek interpretations but
[1:45:41] it's the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost in
[1:45:43] there to set that a fire and to bring it
[1:45:45] to pass and to make it live just exactly
[1:45:48] what was promised the word is for this
[1:45:50] hour not not the the Dynamics it takes
[1:45:54] the mechanics and the Dynamics the word
[1:45:58] and the spirit they are the ones that
[1:45:59] give life am but it's done by a personal
[1:46:04] revelation so true worship can I go on
[1:46:07] yes I can thank you so much First Kings
[1:46:10] 17 and verse 8 true worship is a denial
[1:46:13] of
[1:46:16] self and it's giving God what he desires
[1:46:21] right first First Kings 17:8 and the
[1:46:24] word of the Lord came unto him saying
[1:46:26] arise and get thee to zarap which
[1:46:28] belongeth to zidon and dwell there
[1:46:29] behold I have commanded a widow woman
[1:46:32] there to sustain thee so he arose and he
[1:46:35] went to zapat and when he came to the
[1:46:37] gate of the city behold the widow woman
[1:46:39] was there Gathering of sticks and he
[1:46:42] called to her and he said fetch me I
[1:46:44] pray thee a little morsel or a little
[1:46:46] water in a vessel that I may drink and
[1:46:49] she was going to fetch it and he called
[1:46:50] to her and said bring me I pray thee a
[1:46:52] morsel of bread in thy hand and she said
[1:46:55] as the Lord thy God liveth I have not a
[1:46:58] cake but a handful of meal in a barrel
[1:47:00] and a little oil in a cruise and behold
[1:47:03] I'm gathering two sticks that I may go
[1:47:05] in and dress it for me and my son that
[1:47:07] we may eat and
[1:47:08] die and Elijah said unto her fear not go
[1:47:11] and do as thou has said but make me
[1:47:15] thereof a little cake first how dare you
[1:47:18] ask me when I have nothing
[1:47:23] how dare you ask me to worship God when
[1:47:27] I had a horrible day
[1:47:29] yesterday when my morning has been
[1:47:31] miserable you just don't understand what
[1:47:34] I've been going
[1:47:36] through make me a cake
[1:47:40] first seek ye first the kingdom of God
[1:47:45] and all his righteousness and all these
[1:47:48] things will be added unto you notice she
[1:47:51] had the me which represents Christ the
[1:47:54] word and she had just a little bit of
[1:47:56] oil represents the spirit so she had the
[1:47:59] Dynamics with the
[1:48:01] mechanics and she says I'm gathering two
[1:48:04] sticks so I can create a fire and I can
[1:48:06] mix these two things together and make a
[1:48:08] cake that me and my son are going to eat
[1:48:10] and we're going to
[1:48:12] die see Spirit Worship is not leaving
[1:48:15] them
[1:48:17] separate no but it's bringing the two
[1:48:19] together and mixing it placing it on the
[1:48:21] fire of the word of God God and letting
[1:48:23] letting the Holy Spirit Come and
[1:48:25] energize your worship and we find here
[1:48:27] brother B says many people worship in
[1:48:29] spirit but not in truth and many in
[1:48:31] truth but not in spirit but when you get
[1:48:33] the two of them together then you got
[1:48:34] something when the spirit gets into the
[1:48:36] word she mix it together and when you
[1:48:38] get the spirit of God on you mix with
[1:48:41] God's word something's going to
[1:48:44] happen and she started to go and she
[1:48:46] heard a voice say in your hand fetch me
[1:48:48] a little morsel of bread and she turned
[1:48:50] No Doubt with tears in her eyes she says
[1:48:52] sir that's what I'm out here in the yard
[1:48:54] Gathering these two sticks for I just
[1:48:56] got a handful of meal and a spoonful of
[1:48:58] oil I mixed it together and dressed it
[1:49:00] that I got these two sticks to make a
[1:49:01] fire and bake a cake for me and my son
[1:49:03] and we're going to eat and we're going
[1:49:04] to die she looked at him and he said but
[1:49:07] first make me a cake and sometimes
[1:49:09] that's the way it is on a Sunday morning
[1:49:11] or a Monday or a Tuesday or a Wednesday
[1:49:14] some of you got children that are out
[1:49:15] there in the world but make me a cake
[1:49:17] purse make me a worship purse give me
[1:49:20] what I desire first I'll take care care
[1:49:22] of the wer I'll take care of the
[1:49:24] prodicle I'll take care of the sickness
[1:49:26] I'll take care of the doctor's report
[1:49:28] I'll take care of this sick I'll take
[1:49:30] care of all of that just make me a cake
[1:49:33] first offer me worship
[1:49:39] first he said put God first put God put
[1:49:43] his word first put his Spirit first put
[1:49:45] him first bring me a little cake
[1:49:48] first oh she runs in there and she said
[1:49:53] the spirit he said the spirit called
[1:49:54] back thus sayith the Lord he said the
[1:49:57] mill Barrel will not go empty nor the
[1:49:59] crws ever run dry and why is that church
[1:50:02] cuz when you reach the bottom of your
[1:50:04] Barrel when you reach the bottom of your
[1:50:06] Humanity when you reach the bottom of
[1:50:08] your ability you reach the top of God
[1:50:11] and if you give God what he desire he'll
[1:50:13] feel that Barrel he'll feel that Cru
[1:50:15] he'll give you what you have NE he'll
[1:50:17] not be done but you must deny yourself
[1:50:21] hey give God what he desires first God
[1:50:24] don't want second place he'll take it
[1:50:27] but he wants
[1:50:29] first he wants to be first place in your
[1:50:33] marriage he wants to be first place on
[1:50:35] the job he wants to be first place in
[1:50:38] school he wants first
[1:50:40] [Music]
[1:50:44] place
[1:50:45] see worship is not a conception of God
[1:50:50] man's idea of who he is or
[1:50:51] denominational aspect
[1:50:53] of what they claim God to be but now the
[1:50:57] end time believer can worship God the
[1:50:58] way he desires to be
[1:51:01] worshiped because a father once again
[1:51:04] has poured out his spirit and he's tied
[1:51:07] all the loose sins
[1:51:09] together and now on the scene is a
[1:51:14] bride that's willing to say come and see
[1:51:17] come and see a man who's told me all
[1:51:20] that I've
[1:51:21] done that woman go back to the woman at
[1:51:23] the well there we find the she said but
[1:51:27] Jesus is telling her but the hour comth
[1:51:28] now is when the spirit when the true
[1:51:30] worshippers shall worship the father in
[1:51:32] spirit and in truth for the father
[1:51:34] seeketh such to worship Him He said God
[1:51:36] is a spirit and they that worship Him
[1:51:38] must worship Him in spirit and in truth
[1:51:40] and in truth and in verse 29 she said
[1:51:42] come and see a man which told me all the
[1:51:44] things that I did is not this to Christ
[1:51:48] notice she wasn't afraid to tell her
[1:51:51] testimony she was afraid to tell about
[1:51:53] the prophet of Galilee that met her at
[1:51:55] the well and she took her eyes off her
[1:51:57] Jeffersonville she took her eyes off a
[1:51:59] Nashville she took her eyes off a or
[1:52:01] shet port and she put her eyes on Jesus
[1:52:04] why because her heart had been turned
[1:52:06] her heart had been changed and God
[1:52:08] turned her heart from unbelief to
[1:52:10] believe it and when your heart is turned
[1:52:12] from unbelief to believe it you can
[1:52:13] worship God today when you realize who
[1:52:17] you are and what God has made you to be
[1:52:20] you may have had a dirty life like the
[1:52:21] woman at the well but but God ain't
[1:52:22] looking at the fifth man the sixth man
[1:52:24] God is looking at
[1:52:26] himself just give me worship and I'll
[1:52:28] change your life offer unto me what I
[1:52:31] desire and I'll rewrite your story it's
[1:52:34] not over she ran into the city dropped
[1:52:37] her water pot come see a man telling
[1:52:39] everybody about that was a Heart of
[1:52:41] Worship she wasn't worried about the
[1:52:43] mountain she wasn't worried about
[1:52:45] Jerusalem as a city she was only there
[1:52:47] to worship the one that she just came
[1:52:49] out of his presence
[1:52:53] and the father is seeking
[1:52:56] those that'll worship him the same
[1:52:58] Romans 12 and
[1:52:59] verse1 this says Paul kind of reframes
[1:53:03] this idea of sacrifice as a form of
[1:53:06] worship Paul we find in Romans 12 and
[1:53:08] verse1 I beseech you therefore Brethren
[1:53:10] by the mercies of God that you present
[1:53:13] your bodies as a Living
[1:53:16] Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which
[1:53:19] is your reasonable service and that word
[1:53:21] service is worship you look it up in the
[1:53:24] Greek it is worship that's your
[1:53:27] reasonable worship that you offer this
[1:53:31] body you offer this
[1:53:34] body your ideas and you lay it on God's
[1:53:39] altar because it ain't About
[1:53:42] Us listen what he says here see our
[1:53:46] minds need a complete renovation not
[1:53:48] only does our hearts need to be turned
[1:53:49] but our minds cuz today you know the
[1:53:52] world today that you're
[1:53:55] entitled you're entitled to this you're
[1:53:57] entitled to that everybody gets a
[1:53:59] participation trophy when I played
[1:54:01] Little League ball we didn't get look I
[1:54:02] was fat and dumpy I didn't get no
[1:54:06] trophy well short fat man don't or for
[1:54:09] short fat kid you don't get trophies
[1:54:11] unless you really good but today we give
[1:54:13] everybody a trophy you get a trophy from
[1:54:16] coming to
[1:54:18] church little gold star we're going to
[1:54:20] put it on the board today you showed up
[1:54:22] for service no but Paul is telling us
[1:54:25] it's not about who we are what we're
[1:54:27] entitled to It Ain't About Us it ain't
[1:54:29] about the woke generation it ain't about
[1:54:31] offending this one or that one or this
[1:54:32] agenda versus that agenda God ain't
[1:54:34] worried about agendas he's got one
[1:54:36] desire and that's to be
[1:54:38] worshiped but we find that Satan's
[1:54:40] created a world of self-indulgence
[1:54:42] self-pleasure self- worship but God is
[1:54:44] looking for those that will
[1:54:46] sacrifice those that will present
[1:54:49] themselves as a Living Sacrifice and do
[1:54:51] like Paul Die daily lay yourself on his
[1:54:55] Altar and say not my will but thy will
[1:54:59] be done where your minds have been
[1:55:01] renewed no longer is it about us no
[1:55:04] longer are we thinking like the world
[1:55:06] thinks no longer as our hearts are the
[1:55:09] way they used to be they've been changed
[1:55:11] and we're not looking for personal gain
[1:55:12] or personal attention but we lay
[1:55:15] ourselves on an altar as a service of
[1:55:19] worship you know that the first time the
[1:55:21] word worship was was ever mentioned in
[1:55:23] the
[1:55:24] Bible was mentioned with Abraham and
[1:55:28] Isaac obviously you didn't know
[1:55:32] that Genesis 22 it says and it came to
[1:55:35] pass after these things that God did
[1:55:37] tempt or test Abraham and he said unto
[1:55:40] him Abraham and he said behold here am I
[1:55:43] and he said take now thy son thy only
[1:55:45] son Isaac whom thou lovest and get thee
[1:55:47] into the land of Mariah and offer him
[1:55:49] for a burnt offering upon one of the
[1:55:51] mountains which I was tell thee and
[1:55:53] Abraham rose up early in the morning and
[1:55:55] saddled his ass and took his two young
[1:55:57] men with him and Isaac his son and he
[1:55:59] caved the wood for the burn offering and
[1:56:00] Rose up and he went into the place which
[1:56:02] God had told him and on the third day
[1:56:04] Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the
[1:56:06] place a far off and Abraham said unto
[1:56:08] the young men abide ye here with the ass
[1:56:11] and I and the lad will go Yonder and
[1:56:14] worship and come again into
[1:56:17] you notice Abraham waited 25 years for
[1:56:22] This Promise of Isaac to be
[1:56:25] manifested and now he's being asked to
[1:56:28] sacrifice we just assume the kids 14 15
[1:56:31] years old he's being asked to
[1:56:34] sacrifice but see God was getting to the
[1:56:37] Heart of
[1:56:40] Worship some of us might say you know
[1:56:42] what no God I done waited a long time
[1:56:44] for this one you I ain't putting him
[1:56:46] nowhere I'm not taking him you going to
[1:56:48] have to drag me Kicking and Screaming
[1:56:50] but notice how dare you ask me to to
[1:56:52] sacrifice my son when I waited so long
[1:56:55] and I've only had this few years with
[1:56:57] him I'm not going to do it I'm entitled
[1:57:00] to the
[1:57:01] promise but that ain't how Abraham
[1:57:04] responded to the word to the request to
[1:57:06] go worship because Abraham was created
[1:57:09] for worship Abraham knew to trust God
[1:57:13] and he knew that if God can give him to
[1:57:15] me as one from the dead then God can
[1:57:17] bring him back to me from the de if I
[1:57:19] lay him on the altar of sacrifice and
[1:57:21] I'm going to tell you my brother and
[1:57:22] sister God is still the same God today
[1:57:25] and Abraham's response was that
[1:57:27] immediately he saddled an
[1:57:29] ass he was willing to do what the father
[1:57:32] requested him to do and I wonder about
[1:57:37] us
[1:57:39] notice God gave him the promise and he
[1:57:42] received him as one from the dead and
[1:57:44] God's able to raise him up from the dead
[1:57:47] he rose early in the morning made the
[1:57:49] preparations though he didn't understand
[1:57:51] it
[1:57:53] though he couldn't reason it all
[1:57:55] out he was a worshipper and it was a
[1:57:58] part of his worship and sometimes God's
[1:58:01] going to ask you to do some very
[1:58:02] difficult things that don't make
[1:58:05] sense that you can't reason
[1:58:08] out but it's a part of worship God is
[1:58:12] testing you to see if you truly love him
[1:58:16] to see if you truly will be obedient to
[1:58:19] him see worship is not about about you
[1:58:23] it's a denial of self you don't think
[1:58:26] Abraham had bad
[1:58:28] days oh we see the bright side don't we
[1:58:31] he staggered not praise God Abraham had
[1:58:34] some gloomy
[1:58:35] days how many of you've never had a bad
[1:58:37] day never had a bad day good Lord did
[1:58:41] y'all not hear every hand went up we got
[1:58:44] some angels in the house of God but you
[1:58:47] never had a bad day we all have had bad
[1:58:50] days yes
[1:58:53] oh that was weak I said we all have had
[1:58:56] bad days that's better me and brother L
[1:58:58] he's with me Abraham had some bad days
[1:59:02] he was asked to believe five years went
[1:59:05] by as anything changed nothing changed
[1:59:07] but bless God anyway God's able 10 years
[1:59:09] go by he's still holding on to the
[1:59:11] promise 15 years 20 years 25 years he
[1:59:15] waited and he held on to the promise and
[1:59:17] the Bible said Being not weak in faith
[1:59:20] he considered not the his own body Dead
[1:59:22] when he was about a 100 years old
[1:59:24] neither the deadness of Sarah's W and he
[1:59:26] staggered not at the promises of God he
[1:59:29] didn't waver from the promise he didn't
[1:59:31] waver from the belief that God's able to
[1:59:33] do it and there's the bride in the name
[1:59:35] in the land today she's not going to
[1:59:36] stagger and waver and get away from the
[1:59:39] promise of God that God promised a
[1:59:41] Rapture for the church and there's going
[1:59:42] to be a Rapture for the church and until
[1:59:44] the until that Rapture takes place she's
[1:59:47] going to worship God until the door
[1:59:49] opens up she's going to praise God in
[1:59:51] the hallway say let's worship Him Today
[1:59:53] Church let's not wait for your favorite
[1:59:55] preacher or the special meeting God
[1:59:57] deserves worship
[1:59:59] today and he desires it
[2:00:02] today see Abraham believed when his eyes
[2:00:05] didn't show
[2:00:07] him Abraham believed though it was yet
[2:00:11] manifested it was not yet manifested
[2:00:14] though he fully couldn't understand it
[2:00:17] how is God going to do this I'm an old
[2:00:20] man and my wife look at
[2:00:24] her she's
[2:00:25] old she's
[2:00:27] wrinkled the paps are dry there's no
[2:00:31] possible
[2:00:33] way but he
[2:00:37] believed and now he's being
[2:00:42] asked now he's being asked to offer up
[2:00:45] this
[2:00:47] miracle offer him
[2:00:50] up and and the Bible says he staggered
[2:00:53] not at the promises of God I don't think
[2:00:56] that was just for the 25 years I think
[2:00:59] God they wrote about it because they saw
[2:01:02] him willingly take their his son lay him
[2:01:06] on the altar pull back his hand with a
[2:01:08] knife and the angel of the Lord said
[2:01:11] Abraham stay thy hand now I know that
[2:01:13] thou lovest me now I know that you
[2:01:15] worship
[2:01:17] me and there was a lamb caught in a
[2:01:20] Thicket and Abraham took that lamb or
[2:01:22] that Ram laid him on the Altar and slain
[2:01:25] a lamb in Isaac's place and he named
[2:01:28] that place Jehovah J and I'm here to
[2:01:31] tell you he's still Jehovah jarra for
[2:01:33] you today he's still able to meet your
[2:01:36] needs this this
[2:01:37] morning but see Abraham stagger not at
[2:01:40] the promises of God and it's not about
[2:01:43] how we feel not about the circumstances
[2:01:45] you know he had all the odds against him
[2:01:47] but God's for him deadness of his body
[2:01:50] deadness of Sarah's womb Sarah's
[2:01:52] unbelief was working against him today
[2:01:54] you may have a doctor's report working
[2:01:55] against you you may have all kind of
[2:01:57] things working against you but I'm
[2:01:59] asking you today will you lay it on the
[2:02:01] altar will you lay yourself on the altar
[2:02:05] maybe God's asking you today to to lay
[2:02:07] that relationship on the
[2:02:09] altar maybe that friendship with that
[2:02:11] boy or that girl lay it on the Altar and
[2:02:13] see what God can do about
[2:02:15] it maybe God's asking you to put that
[2:02:18] job on the altar keeping you out of
[2:02:20] church
[2:02:22] put that on the altar whatever it is
[2:02:24] maybe that video game that consumes all
[2:02:26] your time or maybe that social media
[2:02:28] platform that creates a lot of drama in
[2:02:30] your life you're so concerned about how
[2:02:32] many likes you
[2:02:34] get why do you care when he says I made
[2:02:37] you accepted and the Beloved that's the
[2:02:39] only like that
[2:02:41] matters that's the only like that
[2:02:44] matters is I'm accepted amen I heard
[2:02:47] brother Brown just the other day I think
[2:02:49] it was in the meatest man in the city he
[2:02:51] says you know I wasn't there that day
[2:02:53] when he said some of those famous words
[2:02:54] but he goes I I want to be there when he
[2:02:56] says well
[2:02:58] done I want to hear those words well
[2:03:00] done my good and faithful servant you
[2:03:04] worshiped me you served me the way I
[2:03:06] desired to be worshiped can we move
[2:03:10] on so Abraham was fully persuaded I'm
[2:03:13] gonna try to close this out here in
[2:03:14] about the next 15 20 minutes everybody
[2:03:17] good you laugh HL
[2:03:21] says he was fully
[2:03:24] persuaded so if we can be fully
[2:03:26] persuaded that means we can also be
[2:03:28] partially
[2:03:29] persuaded so what does it mean brother
[2:03:31] Joe to be partially persuaded persuaded
[2:03:33] it means that you know partially
[2:03:35] persuaded believers they live in Two
[2:03:37] Worlds they live in a world of
[2:03:39] self-effort self-help fear and doubt and
[2:03:42] they live in a world of
[2:03:44] faith and if Faith ain't working they go
[2:03:46] to plan B they try to help God
[2:03:49] out amen come on somebody we have all
[2:03:54] been partial Believers partially
[2:03:56] persuaded at times we tried to help God
[2:03:58] out some of you were up to 12:30 1:00
[2:04:01] this morning trying to figure it all
[2:04:04] out oh yeah we try to help God do Godly
[2:04:07] things you ain't meant to do Godly
[2:04:09] things God is meant to do Godly
[2:04:13] things but the so we find that a partial
[2:04:16] persuaded believer you know they they
[2:04:18] don't lean on faith the way we lean on
[2:04:20] faith but faith is is a backup plan
[2:04:22] there's always a backup to it if if it
[2:04:24] don't happen then I'm going to help out
[2:04:26] God I'm going to do this but until we
[2:04:28] fully realize that God is our complete
[2:04:30] source of strength he's our complete
[2:04:32] source of provision he's our complete
[2:04:34] source of power and understanding and be
[2:04:37] fully persuaded in church it's no use
[2:04:40] but I'm here to tell you that being
[2:04:41] fully persuaded is a decision and
[2:04:43] worshiping God this morning is a
[2:04:46] decision that each of us must
[2:04:50] make it's a decision that you deny
[2:04:55] yourself what others think about you you
[2:04:59] know that's a lot of us we think we're
[2:05:00] just so concerned about what everybody
[2:05:02] else thinks don't
[2:05:03] we some of us could care less I wish I
[2:05:06] had that attitude sometimes like I ain't
[2:05:09] worried about you
[2:05:11] dummy but some of us ain't nature that
[2:05:14] way you say something it's taken the
[2:05:16] wrong way man it eats to
[2:05:18] you or somebody thinks this about you
[2:05:21] and it gets back to you you get your
[2:05:22] feelings all
[2:05:25] hurt I just ain't going to come back to
[2:05:27] the house of God what did God do to you
[2:05:30] I ain't coming back I ain't coming
[2:05:34] back God didn't do that to
[2:05:37] you no we take it out on God all he
[2:05:42] wants you to do is worship when we get
[2:05:44] our feelings hurt we get sideways we get
[2:05:46] this we get that we're human
[2:05:49] folks but see no matter what
[2:05:53] no matter what your neighbor thinks
[2:05:55] about
[2:05:56] you no matter what those on the live
[2:05:59] stream are going to stream in they may
[2:06:01] see some of you shout and some of you
[2:06:03] jump and some of you cry some of you we
[2:06:06] just going to act
[2:06:08] different and they may get
[2:06:10] critical but true
[2:06:13] worship looks past the
[2:06:16] critics see true worship doesn't worry
[2:06:18] about the critics Abraham made a
[2:06:20] decision to offer his son he wasn't
[2:06:24] worried about what anybody else thought
[2:06:26] about it he had a relationship with God
[2:06:30] and it didn't it didn't make sense to
[2:06:33] his human understanding and it sometimes
[2:06:36] it won't make sense to ours you'd be
[2:06:38] looking like why are they jumping and
[2:06:40] shouting and dancing and running I don't
[2:06:42] feel that well maybe you wasn't in their
[2:06:47] trial maybe if you was in their trial
[2:06:49] and you got their Victory you would act
[2:06:51] the way they're
[2:06:53] acting or maybe let's just say this
[2:06:56] maybe if you could recognize that you're
[2:06:57] in a trial and that he deserves your
[2:07:00] worship and you can set your personal
[2:07:02] attitude aside and your personal views
[2:07:05] aside and give him what he desires maybe
[2:07:07] there'll be an emotion rise up within
[2:07:09] you and you'll do things you've never
[2:07:11] done
[2:07:12] before because
[2:07:14] remember
[2:07:16] worship is surrendering all to
[2:07:19] him I told a young young man last week I
[2:07:23] said lose yourself in
[2:07:28] him he sent me five or six voice
[2:07:30] messages this
[2:07:33] morning lose
[2:07:36] yourself in him he says I didn't know
[2:07:38] what you
[2:07:39] meant he goes but last week I watched
[2:07:43] the Dallas Mavericks play the Denver
[2:07:46] Nuggets and they were down 20 points and
[2:07:49] Dallas is my favorite team and they're
[2:07:51] down 20 points and they had the biggest
[2:07:53] comeback in NBA history and he goes I
[2:07:56] got beside myself brother Joe and it
[2:07:59] goes I understood what you meant to Lose
[2:08:02] Yourself see he lost himself as a
[2:08:06] fan because his team came back from 20
[2:08:09] points to win the Conference
[2:08:14] Final we got more on the line than a
[2:08:16] conference
[2:08:17] Championship we got a Rapture on the
[2:08:20] line we got Souls on the line we got
[2:08:23] sons and daughters on the line we got
[2:08:26] prodal on the line we got others that
[2:08:28] need healing in their body it's on the
[2:08:31] line and all I'm asking you this morning
[2:08:33] is Lose Yourself
[2:08:36] sir in an attitude of
[2:08:39] worship look
[2:08:41] past the critic and give God let go and
[2:08:45] give God what he
[2:08:47] desires we're going to bring this down I
[2:08:51] bring it down
[2:08:53] here before we do
[2:09:00] though the Bible would tell us in
[2:09:02] Matthew 15 and verse 8 this people they
[2:09:05] draw nigh unto me with their mouth and
[2:09:07] they honor me with their lips but their
[2:09:09] heart is far
[2:09:11] away see but in vain that word vain
[2:09:14] there is fruitlessly they do worship me
[2:09:17] teaching for the doctrines and the
[2:09:18] Commandments of men see they made great
[2:09:20] profession they pretend with much
[2:09:22] devotion and piety but their heart is
[2:09:25] far from me they do not seriously or
[2:09:28] sincerely love me nor obey me they don't
[2:09:31] give me their heart oh they can sing
[2:09:33] songs they can go through the motions
[2:09:36] but God is looking at the
[2:09:38] heart he wants this and he knows church
[2:09:42] he knows when you come in the house of
[2:09:43] God and you just give lip service and he
[2:09:45] knows when you come in the house of God
[2:09:47] and You Give a Heart of Worship and
[2:09:49] that's what I want today is for us to go
[2:09:51] back and say God I want to give you a
[2:09:52] Heart of Worship see in vain they
[2:09:55] worship me they they idly unprofitably
[2:09:58] you know Stand By and they just worship
[2:09:59] their worship does not attain to the end
[2:10:02] which Divine worship was appointed
[2:10:04] neither does it please God nor prophit
[2:10:06] themselves for it might be in the spirit
[2:10:08] but if it's not in truth it's still not
[2:10:09] worship and if it's in truth and not in
[2:10:11] spirit then it's still not worship it
[2:10:14] has to be in
[2:10:16] both and he says Jesus said un said when
[2:10:19] he was on Earth he said he said said in
[2:10:21] vain do they worship me now there is
[2:10:23] then a possibility it is so that there
[2:10:25] can be genuine worship of God
[2:10:30] wrong in vain do they worship me
[2:10:33] teaching for the doctrine and the
[2:10:34] Commandments of man notice having a
[2:10:38] formality but not losing theirselves in
[2:10:41] an atmosphere of worship putting
[2:10:43] everybody
[2:10:45] aside today he goes I know we got great
[2:10:48] songs we build great churches we got
[2:10:49] great anthems everything we praise him
[2:10:52] like that but Jesus says in your heart
[2:10:55] you're far from me for you teach for the
[2:10:58] doctrine and the Commandments of Men Let
[2:11:00] the Holy Spirit come in and do something
[2:11:02] in the church showing the presence of
[2:11:04] Jesus Christ they'll kick you out the
[2:11:07] door so we don't want our worship to be
[2:11:10] in vain this
[2:11:12] morning we don't want it to be fruitless
[2:11:14] and void we don't want our worship to be
[2:11:16] merely man-made traditions and ideas
[2:11:18] that's been passed down from generation
[2:11:20] to generation but we find today in many
[2:11:24] churches you can't be free to worship
[2:11:27] God that we have to sit and we have to
[2:11:30] nod and we have to be quiet we have to
[2:11:32] be respectful and
[2:11:38] reverent he said in vain do they worship
[2:11:44] me brother B says I've seen jumping
[2:11:46] spells Joy spells but there was nobody
[2:11:49] hurt or you trying now you trying to
[2:11:51] make make it all emotion not at all he
[2:11:52] says the mountains rung out the sun went
[2:11:54] down everybody took place everything
[2:11:57] took place but there was nobody hurt
[2:11:59] I've seen meetings where the power of
[2:12:00] God was revealed to the people they were
[2:12:02] free from the world the things of the
[2:12:04] world the joy of the Lord filled the
[2:12:05] congregation they stood and screamed and
[2:12:07] cried and shouted to the top of their
[2:12:09] voice for the glory of God I never did
[2:12:12] see anything disorderly they was always
[2:12:15] right in
[2:12:18] order because they had recognized that
[2:12:20] their name and been written on the
[2:12:21] Lamb's Book of Life and I say this if
[2:12:24] your worship lines up with this quote
[2:12:25] then you're in order this morning if
[2:12:28] your worship marries up to this quote it
[2:12:31] may be singing it may be shouting it may
[2:12:33] be dancing where the presence of God
[2:12:35] Falls it doesn't matter don't let some
[2:12:38] cold formal devil come and tell you you
[2:12:39] got to sit there and sit by and be idle
[2:12:41] and quiet and you can't worship
[2:12:44] God some Luke War foral Spirit wants to
[2:12:47] tell tell us today that we can't worship
[2:12:49] we got to be dignified and we got to
[2:12:51] revealed word today and we know we don't
[2:12:53] need none of that nonsense let me tell
[2:12:55] you it may be nonsense to them but it
[2:12:57] ain't nonsense to us it's worship to
[2:13:00] us we find notice everywhere Jesus went
[2:13:04] there was a little bit of
[2:13:07] quietness everybody was
[2:13:10] sleeping church was like a mouse you can
[2:13:13] hear him moving squeaking no the Bible
[2:13:15] says everywhere that Jesus went there
[2:13:17] was
[2:13:18] noise notice the shout of the king was
[2:13:21] in the
[2:13:23] camp that word shout there means Jubilee
[2:13:26] it means a loud noise of rejoicing you
[2:13:28] telling me we got the king in the camp
[2:13:31] and we can't shout about
[2:13:33] it oh my goodness we might as well go
[2:13:36] back to the bar we might as well go back
[2:13:38] to the party
[2:13:40] scene that sounds absurd doesn't it it
[2:13:42] sounds ridiculous doesn't it yeah and
[2:13:44] that's just as about as ridiculous is
[2:13:45] having the king in our midst and not
[2:13:47] being able to shout let me tell you the
[2:13:49] rocks will crowd in your place if you
[2:13:51] won't praise him if you won't worship
[2:13:54] him I don't want no Rock crying in my
[2:13:56] place God gave me hands of worship God
[2:13:59] gave me feet to worship God gave me
[2:14:02] breath in my love to worship God gave me
[2:14:05] a mou to praise him and he's worthy to
[2:14:08] be worshiped I'm not going to let
[2:14:10] somebody tell me to sit back sit idle
[2:14:13] and sit out and don't worship God God
[2:14:15] deserves worship and I've been created
[2:14:18] for such I worship God in the good time
[2:14:21] I'll worship God in the bad time I'll
[2:14:24] worship God in the dark time I will
[2:14:26] worship
[2:14:27] God cuz he is worthy to be worshiped he
[2:14:30] is worthy to be
[2:14:37] praised we got the king in the Camp
[2:14:41] Jubilee that's
[2:14:44] right and where the
[2:14:46] spirit where the spirit of the Lord is
[2:14:50] there's liberty
[2:14:52] not bondage you're free even light
[2:14:55] you're free bride to worship
[2:14:58] him and it's more than just lip
[2:15:03] service
[2:15:07] notice if there ever was a
[2:15:10] people in the land today that should be
[2:15:12] able to shout because the king is in a
[2:15:15] camp there ever was a people that should
[2:15:17] be able to Rejoice because the king is
[2:15:20] among them
[2:15:21] there ever was a people that should be
[2:15:22] able to dance because they got Victory
[2:15:26] it should be this
[2:15:29] bride I will have a
[2:15:33] church without a
[2:15:35] spot without a wrinkle without a blemish
[2:15:40] yes A Perfect Bride brother the hell we
[2:15:44] didn't make ourselves perfect but the
[2:15:46] word has made us what we are
[2:15:49] hallu and if there should be anybody
[2:15:51] that can worship God it should be his
[2:15:58] bride brother Brown would tell us this
[2:16:00] and they speak to the mountains as I
[2:16:01] move quickly
[2:16:03] on he said there was a colored sister
[2:16:05] and we wouldn't use that word today cuz
[2:16:07] it's not fitting but he said there's a
[2:16:08] color such a man she could sing and
[2:16:10] bring the presence of God in he goes all
[2:16:13] day all night the angels watching over
[2:16:16] me he goes oh he goes I always just
[2:16:19] almost had to tie my hand hands and keep
[2:16:22] from R from ruining the meeting jumping
[2:16:24] up and down screaming and running all
[2:16:26] over the place if that was good enough
[2:16:29] for a prophet it's good enough for me
[2:16:31] and if it was good enough for your
[2:16:33] Prophet it should be good enough for you
[2:16:35] well it ain't my nature well you may
[2:16:36] need to see where your name's at that
[2:16:38] your name's in the Lamb's Book of Life
[2:16:40] and all day and all night the angels of
[2:16:43] God are watching over me in the good
[2:16:46] time they're watching over me in my bad
[2:16:48] time the angel are watching over me I
[2:16:51] tell I got to tie my hand Oh Tie My Feet
[2:16:54] why because why he deserves our worship
[2:16:57] what he's done for you brother and
[2:16:59] sister think about the massless grace of
[2:17:04] God he says you can be emotional right
[2:17:07] if you got the right kind of emotion
[2:17:09] with it or behind it the right kind of
[2:17:13] emotion moving your emotion that's right
[2:17:17] so it ain't all emotion but it's okay to
[2:17:20] have it if you you got the right kind of
[2:17:22] emotion see if you got the right kind of
[2:17:24] emotion behind the spirit behind it the
[2:17:26] truth behind
[2:17:28] it so
[2:17:30] worship you have to look past your
[2:17:34] critics we're going to turn this is our
[2:17:36] last scripture reading for
[2:17:38] today 2 Samuel 6 and verse
[2:17:42] 11 the Ark of the Lord continued in the
[2:17:44] house of OED Edom the get tip for three
[2:17:48] months and the Lord blessed OED Edom and
[2:17:51] all of his household and it was told
[2:17:53] King David saying the Lord had blessed
[2:17:55] the house at OED Edom and all that
[2:17:57] pertaineth unto him because the Ark of
[2:18:00] God so David went and brought up the Ark
[2:18:02] of God from the house at OED Edom in the
[2:18:05] city of David with gladness so three
[2:18:08] three months prior to this David tried
[2:18:10] to do God a service without it being
[2:18:12] revealed to him he thought this was
[2:18:15] customary this is what I should do as
[2:18:17] the king and yet it wasn't in God's plan
[2:18:20] God's time and he tried to do something
[2:18:22] and it cost a man usza his life but
[2:18:25] three months had passed and David feared
[2:18:27] God and David got his heart right and
[2:18:29] David wanted to be right with God and so
[2:18:31] he waited and we find here that now God
[2:18:34] gave the green light if we would say to
[2:18:36] go and bring the ark back amen now now
[2:18:39] it's time and David says and so it was
[2:18:42] so that when he bued the Ark of the Lord
[2:18:44] had gone six Paces he sacrificed an oxin
[2:18:47] and fatlings and David danced before the
[2:18:50] Lord with all his might and David
[2:18:52] guarded with the linen ephod so David
[2:18:55] and all the house of Israel brought up
[2:18:57] the Ark of the Lord with shouting and
[2:18:59] with the sound of a
[2:19:01] trumpet notice David danced before the
[2:19:05] Lord why because the word was being
[2:19:07] restored the word was coming back to its
[2:19:10] proper position and here it is he was
[2:19:12] the greatest King that there ever was
[2:19:15] and yet the king set aside his prize the
[2:19:17] king set aside his kingdom ship the king
[2:19:19] satisfi set aside his Royal Roop and he
[2:19:22] got out there with the people and he
[2:19:24] begin to dance and worship why because
[2:19:27] the word was being restored and you're
[2:19:29] telling me today we got the Vindicated
[2:19:32] word being restored to a people back in
[2:19:35] the proper position and we got to sit
[2:19:37] back and be
[2:19:38] quiet we got a right to worship the word
[2:19:41] has come back to a bride the word has
[2:19:44] been restored the spirit has been poured
[2:19:46] out we got a right to dance to shout to
[2:19:49] rejoice
[2:19:51] hallah David wasn't worried about his
[2:19:56] image he wasn't worried about his image
[2:19:59] brother B says when he saw the word as
[2:20:02] it was with tables of stone back he said
[2:20:05] it brought back to his place David
[2:20:07] rejoiced and danced in the
[2:20:10] spirit around and around and
[2:20:15] around he saw the word back in its place
[2:20:18] he said that's what the word needs not
[2:20:20] some s
[2:20:21] some theological mixup but an
[2:20:22] oldfashioned godsent preacher behind the
[2:20:25] pulpit with the word seeing God
[2:20:27] Vindicated its
[2:20:29] proof but you know David danced before
[2:20:32] the Lord and in every church service
[2:20:36] there's going to be a
[2:20:38] Critic I can't believe look at him call
[2:20:42] himself a
[2:20:44] king call himself a
[2:20:47] preacher I'm doing exactly what an
[2:20:49] evangelist does that's right I
[2:20:52] evangelize yes I get excited I get
[2:20:54] excited I'm not a teacher yes and I'm
[2:20:57] not throwing off on teachers so I better
[2:20:58] be to move on but here David was he's
[2:21:02] worshiping he done put his Royal apparel
[2:21:05] aside and put on the Lin and Epi he was
[2:21:07] just like everybody
[2:21:09] else he didn't care about his position
[2:21:12] in the church he didn't care if he did
[2:21:14] the music if he ran this or ran that or
[2:21:17] ran the other it didn't matter to him he
[2:21:19] got right out there among them brother
[2:21:21] stripped his Royal apparel said I'm one
[2:21:23] of you and the word is being restored
[2:21:26] the word is being restored oh they
[2:21:29] probed at it for many years they tried
[2:21:30] to bring it for many years through six
[2:21:32] Church ages and it's not been restored
[2:21:33] yet but in the seventh Church age it was
[2:21:36] time yes and now it's time there there's
[2:21:38] a David in the land today that'll
[2:21:39] worship God because the word's been
[2:21:41] restored but you find David had to look
[2:21:44] past the critic because his old wife
[2:21:46] looked out the
[2:21:47] window yeah his wife
[2:21:51] the one that should know his heart the
[2:21:52] one that should be tender and merciful
[2:21:54] to him and you know just kind of Love
[2:21:55] David but we find in 2 Samuel 6:16 as
[2:21:58] the Ark of the Lord came into the city
[2:22:00] Michael Saw's daughter looked through
[2:22:02] the window and saw King David leaping
[2:22:04] and dancing before the Lord and she
[2:22:06] despised him with her
[2:22:09] heart that word despised means she
[2:22:12] disdained him that means she she
[2:22:15] considered him worthless and she
[2:22:17] regarded him with contempt
[2:22:20] she may have disdained David and
[2:22:22] considered him worthless a worthless
[2:22:24] husband an unfit King but oh God said
[2:22:27] you're a man after my own heart in this
[2:22:29] world may consider you worthless they
[2:22:31] may consider you unfit but God Almighty
[2:22:34] is said that's my bride she'll be one
[2:22:36] that worship me when the world won't
[2:22:38] worship me when the BST won't worship me
[2:22:40] when the Pentecost won't worship me but
[2:22:42] she will she'll worship me she'll look
[2:22:45] past the critic she'll look past the fan
[2:22:48] and she will give me what I desire
[2:22:52] she will worship
[2:22:53] [Applause]
[2:22:56] me I like what brother Brandon would say
[2:22:58] about
[2:23:00] it but let's go into it real quick 2
[2:23:04] Samuel 6 verse 20 David returned to
[2:23:07] bless his and notice now he's done bless
[2:23:09] all the people if you go a few verses up
[2:23:11] but you don't have to go there he
[2:23:12] blessed every man woman gave him flesh
[2:23:15] and piece of Flesh and flag and of wine
[2:23:17] so all the people departed they went
[2:23:19] them to his house and returned to bless
[2:23:21] his own
[2:23:23] house it be like me going home today
[2:23:26] preaching my heart out and my
[2:23:30] wife you took your jacket off you look
[2:23:33] like an idiot up there Jumping All
[2:23:35] Around shouting and screaming spitting
[2:23:42] everywhere notice Michael the daughter
[2:23:45] of Saul came out to meet David and said
[2:23:47] how glorious you can just imagine a
[2:23:50] little snar little snotty little woman
[2:23:52] how glorious was the king of Israel
[2:23:57] today who uncovered
[2:23:59] himself today in the eyes of the
[2:24:02] handmaids and his servants is one of the
[2:24:04] vain fellows Shamel uncovered
[2:24:06] himself how dare you you embarrass me up
[2:24:10] here preaching like that dancing like
[2:24:12] that shouting like that don't you know
[2:24:14] we didn't do that back at my father's
[2:24:17] house I like David's reply David said to
[2:24:21] Michael it was before the
[2:24:24] Lord I said it was before the Lord he
[2:24:27] wasn't worried about the critic it was
[2:24:29] before the Lord and if your worship is
[2:24:31] unto the Lord don't worry about your
[2:24:34] critic it was before the Lord
[2:24:38] notice see it was before the Lord which
[2:24:41] chose me before thy father and before
[2:24:43] all his house to appoint me to be the
[2:24:45] ruler over the people of the Lord over
[2:24:47] Israel therefore will I play before the
[2:24:49] Lord and I will be yet more vow than
[2:24:54] thus if you didn't like that watch this
[2:24:58] that's what your Prophet said he said he
[2:25:00] looked at Michael he said Michael if you
[2:25:02] didn't like that worship let me tell you
[2:25:04] you don't want to criticize on the live
[2:25:06] stream if you didn't like that worship
[2:25:08] and watch this there is a PR in the end
[2:25:11] time and she's been created to worship
[2:25:14] God musicians when you come there on the
[2:25:16] inside of her is a desire she ain't
[2:25:18] worried about the critic she she ain't
[2:25:20] worried about her idea she ain't worried
[2:25:22] about Mak what everybody happen but she
[2:25:24] had a desire to worship God and dancing
[2:25:28] is a part of that worship and shouting
[2:25:30] is a part of that worship and raising
[2:25:32] your hands and rejoicing is a part of
[2:25:34] that worship and crying and tears
[2:25:37] streaming down it's a part of that
[2:25:39] worship some of you May
[2:25:42] Cry tears streaming down your eyes but
[2:25:46] it's not your natural nature but it
[2:25:48] comes from your heart that's worship yes
[2:25:52] some of you introverts you may jump out
[2:25:55] of that shell for a brief moment and
[2:25:57] begin to shout and dance but see it's
[2:26:00] not your nature therefore it's
[2:26:04] worship and some of you
[2:26:08] extroverts you may raise your hands and
[2:26:10] just say God thank you for all that
[2:26:13] youve done see
[2:26:16] worship is not about us it goes
[2:26:19] completely Beyond who we are
[2:26:23] yes yes it goes
[2:26:26] completely beyond what we think beyond
[2:26:28] what we think who we are and it's all
[2:26:31] about him can we get back to the Heart
[2:26:35] of
[2:26:37] Worship where it's not on a
[2:26:40] Doctrine brother said I'd rather be
[2:26:43] right in my
[2:26:45] spirit and wrong in my Doctrine than to
[2:26:49] be right in my Doctrine WR wrong in my
[2:26:51] spirit cuz see from the heart your
[2:26:55] spirit will cry out to God now you can
[2:26:59] be arrogant in your heart in your spirit
[2:27:03] you can be
[2:27:04] prideful you can be
[2:27:06] critical but if you can set all that
[2:27:09] aside and say today I just want to
[2:27:11] worship him he deserves My
[2:27:16] Worship look past my failures my
[2:27:19] shortcomings
[2:27:21] I just want to worship Him CU inside of
[2:27:24] you God created you for
[2:27:27] worship God created you nobody can
[2:27:31] worship him like this
[2:27:33] bride because you're created in His
[2:27:36] image created for a
[2:27:39] purpose to be a son and daughter of God
[2:27:41] and only a true son and a true daughter
[2:27:43] can love the father way he desires to be
[2:27:46] loved what about a church look pastor
[2:27:50] critics deny
[2:27:52] yourself that's worship anybody can sing
[2:27:57] okay maybe not anybody can make a Joyful
[2:28:01] Noise but everybody that's called by his
[2:28:04] name that recognizes he's Papa he's
[2:28:08] father and I'm his son and I'm his
[2:28:11] daughter they have the right to worship
[2:28:14] you can worship past your
[2:28:17] feelings you can worship past what you
[2:28:19] see see you can worship past what you
[2:28:23] think and you can offer God a
[2:28:28] sacrifice what about it today
[2:28:31] church only you can worship God the way
[2:28:35] he
[2:28:36] desires Angels can't take your place
[2:28:40] brother Creed but you got a place that
[2:28:42] they just sit back and watch my look at
[2:28:47] him
[2:28:48] worship my look at those young people in
[2:28:52] Leo deia worshiping me not just in vain
[2:28:56] not just with lip service but from a
[2:29:00] heart young girls young boys nine 10
[2:29:03] years old give their heart to God
[2:29:05] receive the baptism all the Holy Ghost
[2:29:07] give her
[2:29:09] life as a form of
[2:29:11] worship see David worshiped with all
[2:29:14] this heart and I wonder today if we can
[2:29:16] get back to a Heart of
[2:29:18] Worship where it's not about
[2:29:22] us but it's about him he took our place
[2:29:24] he took our Stripes he took our sin he
[2:29:27] filled us with the Holy
[2:29:30] Spirit can't we shout if that's where he
[2:29:34] leads us to can't we Rejoice if that's
[2:29:38] what he's asking of you to
[2:29:40] doen so I'm not asking you to jump and
[2:29:42] run the ows this
[2:29:44] morning because we're going to worship
[2:29:47] different your worship will not be My
[2:29:49] Worship and My Worship will not be your
[2:29:51] worship but all of our worship must be
[2:29:54] unto
[2:29:56] him look past your complexes this
[2:29:59] morning suicide said I'll take you down
[2:30:01] depression said I'll take you down fear
[2:30:03] said I'll take you down all these things
[2:30:05] family strains you know they come and
[2:30:06] they try to haunt us and linger over us
[2:30:08] and try to tell you you're not good
[2:30:09] enough and all that but he deserves
[2:30:11] worship and I believe they there's if
[2:30:13] there ever was a people on the place on
[2:30:15] the planet there is a people right now
[2:30:16] today that this is the hour that that
[2:30:20] the father seeketh those that will
[2:30:22] worship Him in spirit and in
[2:30:26] truth can we worship this morning amen
[2:30:29] let's just Worship the Lord let's just
[2:30:31] stand to her feet this morning and just
[2:30:32] worship when the service is over let's
[2:30:35] offer God let it not be just from your
[2:30:38] lips this morning anybody can do that
[2:30:40] but let us be from your heart Lord I

[2:31:20] cuz he created you for that maybe Satan
[2:31:23] is telling you everything contrary to
[2:31:25] what I'm telling you this morning but if
[2:31:27] you can offer a god a sacrifice of
