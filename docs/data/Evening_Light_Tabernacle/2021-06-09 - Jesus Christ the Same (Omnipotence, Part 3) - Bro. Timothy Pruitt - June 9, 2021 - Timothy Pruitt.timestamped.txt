[43:17] hebrews chapter 13 and verse 8 says
[43:20] jesus christ
[43:22] the same yesterday today and forever
[43:26] amen revelations 1 and verse 10 says i
[43:29] was in the spirit
[43:31] on the lord's day and heard behind me a
[43:33] great voice
[43:34] as of a trumpet saying i
[43:38] am alpha not i was or i may be or i will
[43:41] be i
[43:42] am alpha and omega the first
[43:45] and the last and what they'll see us
[43:48] write in the book
[43:48] and send it unto the seven churches
[43:51] verse 12
[43:52] and i turn to see the voice that spake
[43:54] with me and being turned i saw
[43:56] seven golden candlesticks and the midst
[43:59] of the seven candlesticks one like unto
[44:02] the son of man
[44:03] clothed with a garment down to the foot
[44:06] and gird about the paps with the golden
[44:08] girdle
[44:10] his head and his hairs were white like
[44:12] wool
[44:13] and as white as snow and his eyes were
[44:16] as a flame of fire
[44:18] and his feet like undefined brass as if
[44:21] they burned in a furnace and his voice
[44:24] has the sound of many waters
[44:26] and he had in his right hand seven stars
[44:28] and out of his mouth
[44:30] when a sharp two-edged sword and his
[44:32] countenance was as the sun
[44:34] shineth in his strength when i saw him i
[44:38] fell at his feet as
[44:39] dead and he laid his right hand upon me
[44:42] saying unto me fear not
[44:44] i am not i was not i will be
[44:47] i am the first and the last
[44:50] i am he that liveth and was dead
[44:54] and behold i am alive forevermore
[44:58] amen and have the keys of hell
[45:02] and of death amen we'll let you be
[45:05] seated
[45:13] i'd like to speak to you again on jesus
[45:15] christ the same
[45:17] omnipotence so we've been speaking about
[45:20] omnipotence
[45:21] omnipotence is all-powerful
[45:24] amen it's there's nothing greater than
[45:26] omnipotence
[45:28] amen so as we look here upon these
[45:31] things that we read here in revelations
[45:33] 10
[45:34] amen jesus speaking to john would we
[45:36] give a direct
[45:38] revelation of himself and we can read in
[45:41] the
[45:42] verse 1 these are the things that hold
[45:44] this this is a thing
[45:45] saith he that holdeth the seven stars in
[45:48] his right hand
[45:49] who walketh in the midst of the seven
[45:52] golden candlesticks
[45:54] and we know these seven golden
[45:55] candlesticks we've been taught
[45:57] are the seven church ages and we know
[46:00] that we're in the seventh church age
[46:02] and it's wonderful to know that he's in
[46:04] every age
[46:06] or he's in every day you know you're not
[46:08] you're not going one day
[46:10] there's not one day that he's not been
[46:12] there for you
[46:13] there's not one day that he hasn't been
[46:15] involved in our lives or
[46:17] every showing right here every day i am
[46:20] there
[46:21] in their midst and he said this is who
[46:24] he of whom it says the same
[46:25] jesus is both lord and christ
[46:29] there he is the only one the one and
[46:31] only lord
[46:33] god almighty and beside him there is no
[46:36] other
[46:37] there he is the savior walking in the
[46:40] midst of this church ages throughout the
[46:42] seven ages
[46:43] and the beautiful thing is what he was
[46:45] in the first age
[46:46] he is in all ages to every believer
[46:51] how many believers are here tonight so
[46:53] what he was in the first age of the
[46:55] first
[46:56] believers he is in the last days to the
[46:58] last believers
[47:00] he is jesus christ the same yesterday
[47:03] today and forever what he did once
[47:06] he is still doing and he will keep on
[47:09] doing
[47:10] now we notice that jesus is walking
[47:12] alone
[47:13] in the midst of his church of the of the
[47:14] churches or in the midst of the
[47:16] golden candlesticks there is no one else
[47:19] with him
[47:20] there's no one beside him he is only the
[47:22] only one
[47:23] that is walking in the church or is the
[47:26] power of the church or
[47:27] the life of the church neither indeed
[47:30] can there be any other for he alone
[47:33] brought her salvation he alone purchased
[47:36] her salvation
[47:37] it was his own blood that he paid for
[47:40] her
[47:40] and he owns her his bride he is her lord
[47:44] and his he is her master
[47:46] and she will give him all the glory
[47:49] because he will not share glory with any
[47:51] other man he will not share glory
[47:53] with any other person he he alone
[47:56] deserves the glory and the honor
[47:58] and all the glory he won't give it to a
[48:01] pope he won't give it to an archbishop
[48:03] he won't even give it to his earthly
[48:05] mother mary amen because
[48:07] mary was not with him here he was alone
[48:10] he does not speak and turn to the father
[48:13] for he is the father
[48:15] he does not turn and give orders to the
[48:17] holy spirit
[48:18] for he is the spirit of god the eternal
[48:21] god
[48:21] the eternal spirit the life that is
[48:24] flowing and paul satan
[48:26] in the church of the living god it is
[48:28] his life that has given her life
[48:30] and without him she is nothing without
[48:33] him
[48:34] she has no life salvation is of the lord
[48:37] amen
[48:37] there was no one with him when he tried
[48:39] the fierceness of the wrath of the fiery
[48:42] furnace
[48:42] it was him and him alone it was him
[48:46] who hung on the cross and paid the price
[48:48] for our healing and our salvation
[48:51] it was him and him alone that gave his
[48:53] blood amen
[48:55] he is the author he is the finisher of
[48:57] our faith
[48:58] he is the alpha and the omega of our
[49:01] salvation
[49:02] and we are espoused to him and no one
[49:05] other
[49:06] hallelujah we don't belong to a church
[49:09] we belong to him
[49:10] we don't belong to a creed we belong to
[49:13] him
[49:14] we don't belong to a dogma we belong to
[49:16] him
[49:17] it is jesus alone who is walking in the
[49:19] midst of his church
[49:21] it is god in her it is god working in
[49:24] her
[49:25] it is god living in her it is god
[49:27] overcoming in her
[49:29] it is him and him alone we have only
[49:32] relation one
[49:33] only one relationship to god and god has
[49:36] only one relationship to you
[49:38] and that is jesus christ and jesus alone
[49:42] now we see in here also as we've read he
[49:45] had seven stars in his right hand
[49:47] the right hand of a signifies a power or
[49:51] authority in other words amen don't
[49:54] don't get it wrong the stars are not
[49:55] what has the power
[49:57] the hand has the power amen it's not the
[50:00] stars that has the authority
[50:02] it is the hand that has the authority
[50:04] that hold the stars
[50:06] amen so and we can see here in the right
[50:09] hand
[50:09] of the power or of that hand or the
[50:12] seven stars and we know these seven
[50:14] stars
[50:15] represent seven church messengers and
[50:17] this signifies the very
[50:19] power and authority of god are behind
[50:22] every messenger to every age they go
[50:26] forth in the power and the fire of the
[50:28] holy ghost
[50:29] they are stars why because they reflect
[50:31] the light they are not
[50:33] the light but they reflect the light
[50:36] they don't have no light of their own
[50:39] oh hallelujah amen they they don't have
[50:42] a message of their own
[50:43] this is not william branham's message it
[50:46] wasn't
[50:46] luther's message it wasn't wesley's
[50:48] message it wasn't even paul's message
[50:51] he had met god for himself and god
[50:54] the hand that holds him the authority
[50:57] and the power
[50:58] amen the omnipotence behind him it's his
[51:01] message hallelujah these seven
[51:04] messengers are making god known to the
[51:06] people
[51:07] and he that receiveth him receives him
[51:09] that sent him
[51:11] amen in matthew 18 or matthew 28 and
[51:14] verse 18
[51:15] jesus came and he spake this he said all
[51:17] power
[51:18] is given unto me all power and they can
[51:21] say
[51:22] all power all power is given unto me
[51:25] amen and unto me in heaven
[51:28] and in earth amen and and he says
[51:31] go ye therefore and teach all nations
[51:34] baptize them in the name of the father
[51:36] and the son
[51:37] and the holy ghost teaching them to
[51:39] observe all things whatsoever command

[51:41] then lo i am with you always
[51:46] hallelujah i am with you always so it
[51:50] doesn't matter if a friend's with you
[51:52] he's with you don't matter if mom and
[51:54] dad is with you
[51:55] he's with you doesn't matter if a church
[51:57] is with you
[51:58] he's with you doesn't matter if the
[52:00] prophet is with you
[52:01] he's with you because it's him and his
[52:04] life that's permeating down through the
[52:06] church ages and he said i will never
[52:09] leave you do you realize omnipotence
[52:12] said that
[52:13] omnipotence said i will never leave you
[52:17] yeah though you walk through the valley
[52:19] of the shadow of them
[52:20] i'll fear no evil why because thou art
[52:22] with me
[52:25] hallelujah so there you are
[52:28] he says men full of the holy ghost and
[52:31] faith on fire with the fire of god
[52:34] holding forth the word of truth and
[52:36] there he stands to back them up
[52:40] what stands there omnipotence stands
[52:42] there all power stands there
[52:44] and think of it and now listen to the
[52:46] prophet of god he don't just leave that
[52:48] in a prophet
[52:49] he said and think of it not one believer
[52:51] of any age
[52:54] this is right following what he says
[52:56] about the messengers and he goes right
[52:58] into it he says then think of it
[52:59] not one believer of any age need cry in
[53:02] his heart
[53:03] oh that i might have lived back there in
[53:05] that age or i might be there somewhere
[53:07] else
[53:08] there's no need for that look up
[53:11] behold him who's even now walking in
[53:14] your midst
[53:15] even now in the churches behold him
[53:18] who is even now the same yesterday today
[53:21] and forever
[53:22] behold him who never changes either in
[53:25] essence
[53:25] or ways and where two or three are
[53:28] gathering his name
[53:29] there he is in their midst in other
[53:32] words omnipotence is here tonight
[53:34] omnipotence is here to back you up when
[53:37] you stand upon the promise of god
[53:39] and say this is my promise this is my
[53:42] word
[53:42] god has revealed it to my heart
[53:44] omnipotence is there
[53:46] to back that promise up

[53:52] said not only is he in your midst
[53:54] as a complacent onlooker
[53:58] amen now you may come to a church as a
[54:00] complacent onlooker
[54:02] but he don't ever come to church as a
[54:03] complacent onlooker
[54:05] amen you might come to church to sit on
[54:08] the sidelines
[54:09] and maybe watch somebody shout and watch
[54:11] somebody get a victory but that ain't
[54:13] that ain't his attitude when he comes to
[54:15] church he said
[54:16] he don't because this is what he said
[54:17] where two or three are gathered in his
[54:19] name
[54:20] he don't come to church as a complacent
[54:22] onlooker or is that recording angel

[1:01:38] has no power
[1:01:39] no limits to his power he has no limits
[1:01:42] to his ability
[1:01:43] [Applause]
[1:01:47] brandon would take it in the token he

[1:01:51] attorney
[1:01:53] he said therefore the case is closed
[1:01:56] the case is dismissed oh hallelujah
[1:02:01] i remember when my case got dismissed
[1:02:04] when the devil brought all kind of
[1:02:06] accusations up against me
[1:02:08] but god paid every debt he paid debts i
[1:02:11] could not owe
[1:02:12] and he wiped them all away and he wrote
[1:02:14] on my case
[1:02:15] case dismissed
[1:02:21] there is omnipotence in the building
[1:02:23] tonight that i can pull up your case in
[1:02:25] a moment
[1:02:26] and write with his blood dismissed
[1:02:31] because he said i'm going to ruin what
[1:02:33] runs you
[1:02:35] oh my it's what he was saying psalms 3
[1:02:38] and verse 1
[1:02:39] how o lord how many are they that
[1:02:41] increased this troubles me
[1:02:43] many are they that rise up against me
[1:02:46] many there be the say of my soul
[1:02:48] there's no help from him in god but thou
[1:02:50] o lord
[1:02:51] are a defender a shield
[1:02:54] a final voice my glory and lifter of my
[1:02:58] head
[1:02:59] i cried unto the lord with my voice and
[1:03:01] he hired me
[1:03:03] [Applause]
[1:03:04] oh hallelujah don't don't fail to
[1:03:07] realize your cries have been heard
[1:03:09] [Applause]
[1:03:10] it may not seem like it's nothing going
[1:03:12] on it may not seem like nothing is
[1:03:14] happening
[1:03:15] but god heard your first prayer god
[1:03:18] heard the first
[1:03:19] voice as you would lift it up into
[1:03:21] heaven say father
[1:03:23] i need you and it seems like nothing has
[1:03:25] happened but the answer is on the way
[1:03:33] i laid down and slept and i awakened
[1:03:37] for the lord sustained me i'll not be
[1:03:40] afraid of ten thousand of people
[1:03:42] or ten thousands of demons
[1:03:45] that have set themselves against me
[1:03:47] round about
[1:03:49] because i know no matter how much the
[1:03:50] devil can get my god's got more
[1:03:52] [Music]
[1:03:55] oh yes arise o lord save me o my god
[1:03:59] for thou smitten all mine enemies upon
[1:04:02] my cheekbone
[1:04:03] thou has broken the teeth of the ungodly
[1:04:06] salvation belongeth unto the lord
[1:04:09] thy blessing is upon thy people
[1:04:15] let's look at revelations 3 and verse
[1:04:17] 14.
[1:04:18] this is our it's what he is at the end
[1:04:20] he is or at the beginning he is at the
[1:04:22] end now
[1:04:23] let's go to the end
[1:04:29] these things saith the amen
[1:04:35] the faithful and true witness
[1:04:39] oh hallelujah these things saying
[1:04:42] sayeth amen so it tells you the amen has
[1:04:45] a voice
[1:04:47] the amen has something to say and what
[1:04:50] the amen
[1:04:51] says is amen it ain't so be it and
[1:04:55] it's not it's not even how we use amen
[1:04:58] if you look at amen you know
[1:04:59] as you've been responding to the word
[1:05:01] even tonight you say amen
[1:05:03] that's so be it yes lord it's more of a
[1:05:07] unction of a word of of saying of
[1:05:09] agreement
[1:05:12] but this word here is actually a
[1:05:14] finality
[1:05:16] it's actually almost like a period
[1:05:20] that when he says amen it's finished
[1:05:24] it's not that he has to agree to even
[1:05:27] you and it's not he's saying amen to you
[1:05:29] and he's agreeing
[1:05:30] but what he's saying is it's done
[1:05:33] amen so the amen has a voice jesus
[1:05:37] has given us this description in this
[1:05:39] last days of himself
[1:05:40] as grace's days of grace are winding up
[1:05:43] he's looking from the first
[1:05:44] century right through the 20th all the
[1:05:46] way down to the ending of the age
[1:05:48] and he begins to reveal of his
[1:05:50] characteristics
[1:05:52] and he gives us one look of his supreme
[1:05:54] deity
[1:05:57] his omnipotence his ability
[1:06:00] to put a period and no man can erase it
[1:06:05] no devil can wipe it off when he says
[1:06:07] it's finished
[1:06:08] it's finished when he says it's done
[1:06:11] it's over with
[1:06:13] but it's not over with until god says
[1:06:16] it's over with
[1:06:18] oh my god thus saith that amen jesus
[1:06:22] is the amen of god jesus is let
[1:06:25] so let it be of god a man stands for
[1:06:28] finality it stands for approval
[1:06:31] it stands for prevailing promises it
[1:06:34] stands for unchanging promises
[1:06:36] it stands for the seal of god
[1:06:40] the holy ghost is the amen on your life
[1:06:45] there a man of god on your life the seal
[1:06:47] of god that stamps here and when that
[1:06:50] stamp comes on
[1:06:51] the devil is finished
[1:06:54] he might once could walk through your
[1:06:56] life and destroy
[1:06:57] and make you do all kind of ungodly
[1:06:59] things but when that seal
[1:07:00] that a man has placed upon your life
[1:07:03] that final say
[1:07:04] he's lost his power over you
[1:07:07] i'm looking at a bunch of people tonight
[1:07:09] the devil has lost his power over you
[1:07:12] he's lost his say over you he's lost his
[1:07:15] ability to
[1:07:16] mess up make you go a certain way or to
[1:07:19] do a certain thing but there's an amen
[1:07:21] on your life
[1:07:26] the amen approves of you when that amen
[1:07:29] approves of you you're not you don't
[1:07:31] seek of other people's approval
[1:07:37] because god chose you and if god chose
[1:07:40] you
[1:07:41] that's all that matters it doesn't
[1:07:44] matter if sweet pea likes you or this
[1:07:46] person likes you or that person hates
[1:07:47] you
[1:07:48] it could care less god chose me
[1:07:51] [Music]
[1:07:54] when somebody realizes god's choice on
[1:07:56] their life and god's choosing on my life
[1:07:58] that what makes them willing to forsake
[1:08:00] mama and daddy
[1:08:02] and brothers and sisters and leave their
[1:08:04] whole life and leave everything
[1:08:06] and move to a different place why
[1:08:07] because they realize god chose me
[1:08:12] that's right sister cathy ain't it you
[1:08:14] left everything you knew why
[1:08:16] because you realize i'm not a hutterite
[1:08:18] that was the devil's voice on my life
[1:08:21] that was man-made creeds over my life
[1:08:23] that was man-made dogmas and
[1:08:25] doctrines over my life but one day i
[1:08:27] heard another voice
[1:08:29] i heard a final voice and it started
[1:08:31] something from
[1:08:32] such a cathy's heart to where she left
[1:08:34] mama she left daddy she left everything
[1:08:36] that she ever knew why
[1:08:38] because she now had god's approval
[1:08:45] listen when you realize you got god's
[1:08:47] approval that's why people that got
[1:08:48] god's approval and they realized god's
[1:08:50] approval
[1:08:50] therefore they're not worried about
[1:08:51] anybody else's approval therefore
[1:08:53] they're not worried about being in the
[1:08:54] latest fads and the latest this and the
[1:08:56] latest that
[1:08:58] because they're not seeking man's
[1:08:59] approval
[1:09:02] they got god's approval and that's all
[1:09:04] that matters
[1:09:06] when you see somebody that's going after
[1:09:08] every fad of the world dress
[1:09:10] uh paint this that and the other they're
[1:09:12] seeking an approval
[1:09:14] they're thirsty but they're looking in
[1:09:17] the wrong glass
[1:09:19] but there is a there is a place here you
[1:09:21] can drink
[1:09:23] just like the woman at the whale
[1:09:24] drunkard
[1:09:26] she was one time looking for somebody
[1:09:28] else's approval she tried one man lost
[1:09:30] it one another man
[1:09:31] lost it another man lost it and she went
[1:09:33] to one man after another
[1:09:35] until she came to the seventh man
[1:09:39] and he said i got a drink that if you'll
[1:09:40] drink it you won't ever thirst again
[1:09:42] it'll take it all away from you and
[1:09:44] you'll realize you don't have to seek
[1:09:46] after that approval no more
[1:09:48] i chose you i called you
[1:09:51] you were mine
[1:10:02] it's going down brother brannon would
[1:10:05] bring out the scripture in isaiah 65 and
[1:10:07] verse 16
[1:10:09] said that he who blesses himself in the
[1:10:11] earth shall be blessed
[1:10:12] shall bless himself in the god of truth
[1:10:16] and he that sweareth in the earth shall
[1:10:17] swear by the god of truth and brother
[1:10:19] brown would take it
[1:10:20] and he'd bring it down he said it's it's
[1:10:22] the god of the amen
[1:10:25] it's the truth is the final say or the
[1:10:27] final voice the amen
[1:10:30] amen the amen says i create new heavens
[1:10:32] and new earth
[1:10:34] the amen says the former shall not be
[1:10:36] remembered nor come
[1:10:37] into mind oh amen says be glad and
[1:10:41] rejoice forever in that which i created
[1:10:43] and behold i create jerusalem a joy
[1:10:45] rejoice say honor people with joy and i
[1:10:47] will rejoice in jerusalem
[1:10:49] and joy my people and the voice of
[1:10:51] weeping shall be no more heard in her
[1:10:53] nor the voice of crying he said that's
[1:10:55] the new jerusalem this is a millennium
[1:10:57] we're about to go into that
[1:10:59] but he talks about they say the god of
[1:11:01] truth is the god of the amen
[1:11:04] the god of the amen here's jesus of the
[1:11:07] new testament
[1:11:08] the god of the amen and there's jehovah
[1:11:10] the old testament the god of the amen
[1:11:14] the god of truth the final saying
[1:11:16] omnipotence of the old is now
[1:11:18] omnipotence in the new
[1:11:19] year hallelujah
[1:11:22] oh israel the lord thy god is one god
[1:11:25] the new testament does not reveal
[1:11:27] another god
[1:11:28] it's a further revelation of the one and
[1:11:31] same
[1:11:31] god christ did not come down to make
[1:11:33] himself known
[1:11:34] he did not come to reveal the son he
[1:11:36] came to reveal and make known the father
[1:11:39] he never talked about two gods he talked
[1:11:41] about one god
[1:11:42] and now in this last age we come back to
[1:11:44] the capstone revelation
[1:11:46] the most important revelation of the
[1:11:49] godhead
[1:11:50] in the whole bible that is jesus is god
[1:11:54] he and the father are one there is one
[1:11:57] god
[1:11:57] and his name is the lord jesus christ
[1:12:01] and he is the god of the amen and he
[1:12:04] never changes
[1:12:05] and he never will change oh
[1:12:08] what he says he'll stand upon it what he
[1:12:12] does
[1:12:12] he's done it forever and he'll do it
[1:12:14] through eternity
[1:12:19] none can take from what he says or add
[1:12:21] to it so let it be
[1:12:23] a man aren't you glad you served that
[1:12:26] kind of god
[1:12:28] it's like i've said before i'm i'm
[1:12:30] thankful to serve a god
[1:12:31] don't have a mind of a fickle man then
[1:12:34] one day i love me and the next day hate
[1:12:35] me
[1:12:37] you don't know if you got up on the day
[1:12:38] he loves you or you got up on the day he
[1:12:40] hated you
[1:12:41] if he loved you at the beginning he'll
[1:12:42] always love you
[1:12:44] if he called you at the beginning you'll
[1:12:46] always be his
[1:12:48] he is the amen and he won't change
[1:12:51] it means whatever he said is final it
[1:12:54] means whatever he said in the first age
[1:12:56] the second age the third age
[1:12:58] to all ages about his true church and
[1:13:00] about the false vine
[1:13:01] is exactly true and it won't change
[1:13:05] so what did he say about that he said if
[1:13:07] that first spine would ever ever put out
[1:13:09] another branch
[1:13:10] it'll write another book of acts behind
[1:13:12] it
[1:13:13] amen i believe he meant that
[1:13:17] it means that what he started out with
[1:13:18] in genesis he will finish in revelations
[1:13:21] he has to for he is the amen now we can
[1:13:24] see again why the devil hates these two
[1:13:26] books
[1:13:27] he hates the truth he knows the truth
[1:13:29] will prevail
[1:13:30] he knows what he's in will be he knows
[1:13:33] how
[1:13:34] how he how he fights that but thank god
[1:13:36] he says
[1:13:37] we are on the winning side we
[1:13:40] are on the amen side oh hallelujah
[1:13:46] oh he's faithful
[1:13:49] he don't change his word because of
[1:13:52] circumstances
[1:13:53] he don't change his word because of how
[1:13:55] great a sickness is or how terrible it
[1:13:57] is
[1:13:58] he don't change his word because of how
[1:14:00] bad sin is or
[1:14:01] how how bad unbelief he is his word
[1:14:04] remains the same
[1:14:06] amen to be to be omnipotent he has to
[1:14:09] remain that way he cannot change
[1:14:17] he said some he said sometimes we get
[1:14:19] the idea of god
[1:14:22] though he made a way of salvation wade
[1:14:25] being on the cross
[1:14:27] and his death of christ that talking for
[1:14:29] our sins
[1:14:30] and his resurrection gave us an open
[1:14:32] door to him that
[1:14:34] somehow this god just folded his arms
[1:14:36] and began to stand back and watch
[1:14:42] if it is as he said we've taught of him
[1:14:45] being a great creator who having created
[1:14:47] now lost his personal interest in his
[1:14:50] creation
[1:14:51] he's i'll say that as how too many
[1:14:53] people are apt to think
[1:14:55] but that is the wrong thinking god is
[1:14:58] governing in the affairs of men right
[1:15:01] now
[1:15:03] he is both creator and sustainer this is
[1:15:07] what he would call him in colossians 1
[1:15:08] 16 for by him were all things you say
[1:15:11] all things
[1:15:12] all things created that are in heaven
[1:15:15] that on earth visible and
[1:15:16] invisible whether they be in thrones
[1:15:19] dominion principalities powers
[1:15:21] all things were created by him and for
[1:15:23] him and he is before all things
[1:15:25] and by him all things consist
[1:15:29] only omnipotence could all things
[1:15:31] conspire omnipotence could all things
[1:15:34] consist
[1:15:36] but are all things be created but he's a
[1:15:39] sovereign god and by his own counsel
[1:15:41] he purposed the plan of his salvation
[1:15:43] for his own elect
[1:15:44] the son died upon the cross to establish
[1:15:47] his salvation
[1:15:48] and the holy spirit came to execute the
[1:15:51] will of the father
[1:15:52] he's working all things at this moment
[1:15:54] according to his holy purpose
[1:15:57] according to his will right now he's in
[1:16:00] the midst of it
[1:16:01] all every situation
[1:16:04] every problem every sickness every sick
[1:16:07] thing you're going through
[1:16:08] he's in the middle of it not with his
[1:16:11] arms folded
[1:16:12] and looking on the sideline but he's
[1:16:14] involved in your life

[1:16:18] involved in your life
[1:16:21] he's involved in the trial that you're
[1:16:23] in he's involved in the thing that's
[1:16:25] going on through your mind
[1:16:26] and your mind battles he knows all about
[1:16:28] it
[1:16:33] he said the savior god is working
[1:16:36] amongst him
[1:16:37] his own right now as the great shepherd
[1:16:40] of the sheep

[1:16:45] his very existence is for you
[1:16:52] his very existence is for you
[1:16:56] omnipotence existence is for you
[1:17:04] and his eyes are ever on you
[1:17:08] do you realize you don't get up one day
[1:17:10] the sun don't crack dawn
[1:17:12] one morning that his eyes ain't on you
[1:17:15] the sun don't go down one night that his
[1:17:18] eyes ain't on you
[1:17:21] there's not a minute there's not a
[1:17:23] nanosecond there's not the smallest
[1:17:25] uh uh of value of time
[1:17:28] that is i is not watching you
[1:17:33] omnipotence all powerful

[1:17:56] he won't lie it's true to the word he'll
[1:17:57] back it up he's true to us
[1:17:59] he won't leave not one of us but we'll
[1:18:01] raise us up at the last day
[1:18:03] i'm glad that i'm resting in that
[1:18:05] faithfulness
[1:18:09] philippians 1 6 would say it like this
[1:18:11] being confident
[1:18:12] in this very thing that he which has
[1:18:15] begun a good work in you
[1:18:16] will perform it until the day of jesus
[1:18:19] christ
[1:18:20] hallelujah he's a true witness
[1:18:24] amen he's a true god oh hallelujah let
[1:18:27] me go on down brother brannon would
[1:18:28] bring
[1:18:29] some of these thoughts out in the
[1:18:30] absolute
[1:18:32] talk about the omnipotence of god and
[1:18:34] absolute being the last word or the amen
[1:18:37] or the final word or he said absolute
[1:18:40] means and
[1:18:40] i went and looked it up in the
[1:18:41] dictionary there it means the last thing
[1:18:44] it's unlimited there's nothing else in
[1:18:47] its way it's supreme
[1:18:49] it's ultimate amen he says
[1:18:52] he said it's the amen
[1:18:56] so we serve a god who's never wrong
[1:18:59] [Music]
[1:19:02] we serve a god who don't make wrong
[1:19:04] choices
[1:19:07] oh praise the lord that means when he
[1:19:09] chose you
[1:19:10] he didn't make the wrong choice
[1:19:14] that means when he chose you he saw
[1:19:17] something on the inside of you
[1:19:18] and said that's my son that's my
[1:19:21] daughter
[1:19:22] we serve a god who don't make mistakes
[1:19:27] i want you to understand you are not a
[1:19:29] mistake
[1:19:31] that's the devil's voice over here
[1:19:33] that's trying to tell you you're a
[1:19:34] mistake or you was an accident or you
[1:19:37] were just a happenstance that you're
[1:19:38] even here
[1:19:39] your parents didn't even plan for you to
[1:19:41] be here you're an accident
[1:19:43] that is a lie the devil god saw you
[1:19:47] he saw you before there ever was a devil
[1:19:50] before the devil ever had a voice
[1:19:52] god saw you and he said that was mine
[1:19:54] that was mine
[1:19:55] that was mine that was mine that was
[1:19:58] mine
[1:19:58] and i don't make a mistake i don't go
[1:20:01] back and say i made the wrong choice
[1:20:03] i chose him he's still mine
[1:20:05] [Applause]
[1:20:07] satan raised up in his life and tried to
[1:20:08] destroy him but he's still mine
[1:20:11] drugs came but he's still mine how all
[1:20:13] kind of sin was poured out in his life
[1:20:15] but it's still my well why because you
[1:20:19] was always his
[1:20:21] you was always his you need to tell that
[1:20:23] devil tonight
[1:20:24] i'm here tonight because i always was
[1:20:30] his
[1:20:32] not a mistake i'm not happens chance
[1:20:35] that i'm here
[1:20:35] i'm here because god saw me
[1:20:39] and he put me here for a purpose
[1:20:43] omnipotence chose you
[1:20:48] and he's never wrong
[1:20:51] he showed it in this day in this hour i
[1:20:54] think that's why it's so wonderful the
[1:20:55] pastors brought it out several times
[1:20:58] about the amen how the prophet of god
[1:21:01] would begin to speak the word of god and
[1:21:03] lay things out in the word there's a lot
[1:21:05] of people that didn't agree with him
[1:21:06] lost many friends
[1:21:10] people today are walking away from it
[1:21:14] finding faults and this and that
[1:21:18] finding their little negative spins and
[1:21:21] things that they can kind of spin some
[1:21:23] way
[1:21:27] but god came behind it and he said amen
[1:21:32] he said he's a faithful and true witness
[1:21:36] he don't witness something that's false
[1:21:39] hey man that's why you never
[1:21:40] will receive him while you're living a
[1:21:42] false life
[1:21:44] he only witnessed a true life he only
[1:21:47] witnessed a true repentance
[1:21:50] he'll only witness a true dying out
[1:21:53] amen but he came behind it you know
[1:21:54] brother brown would i just listen to him
[1:21:56] to him this week because he would say
[1:21:58] you know i you know he said you think
[1:21:59] people i know people are saying i'm just
[1:22:00] stalling or i'm just
[1:22:02] saying a few words he said but you know
[1:22:04] why i'm what i'm doing he said i'm
[1:22:05] waiting on him
[1:22:06] he said i don't even know if he'll come
[1:22:08] do this or not he said but he's been
[1:22:10] faithful for me
[1:22:12] [Laughter]
[1:22:14] and god would come behind it and say
[1:22:16] amen
[1:22:18] and vindicate a message that was spoke
[1:22:22] vindicated time after time after time
[1:22:25] even even the people his peers and those
[1:22:27] around him had to witness and say this
[1:22:29] was nothing
[1:22:30] but bible days are here again god is
[1:22:33] once again
[1:22:34] unveiling himself among us
[1:22:38] you know i believe his brother wayne
[1:22:40] brought this out a few years ago
[1:22:42] and it's in the absolutes wonderful
[1:22:43] wonderful sermon in phoenix arizona
[1:22:45] brother brown tells about that young
[1:22:47] lady that had had gotten a lot of peer
[1:22:49] pressure and
[1:22:50] of the way she lived and the way she
[1:22:52] dressed and things and
[1:22:53] and began to be ridiculed and made fun
[1:22:55] of and to where she lost her mind went
[1:22:56] through a nervous break
[1:22:58] break uh uh break down and lost her mind

[1:25:35] as she could be she's been examined by
[1:25:37] the whole staff of doctors
[1:25:39] we're taking her home in the morning
[1:25:45] hallelujah good morning shalom
[1:25:49] amen the doctor's report had a voice but
[1:25:52] it wasn't the final voice
[1:25:54] but when the absolute comes in the room
[1:25:56] the final voice
[1:25:57] falls into the room then every devil has
[1:26:00] to be silenced
[1:26:01] i don't care how hard it is or how
[1:26:03] impossible it seems
[1:26:05] when i've neutered the speaks it shuts
[1:26:07] up every devil
[1:26:09] it's a line it's a lot of the tribe of
[1:26:12] judah
[1:26:12] when a lion roars in the jungle
[1:26:15] everything else begins to shut up
[1:26:16] why because the most powerful beast is
[1:26:19] roar
[1:26:20] it has spoken and let me hear tell you
[1:26:22] tonight oblivious is in the building
[1:26:25] and omnipotence is speaking omnipresent
[1:26:28] is saying you're not going to stay where
[1:26:29] you're at
[1:26:30] you're not going to go down in that
[1:26:32] thing but i've come
[1:26:33] to give you life and life more
[1:26:35] abundantly
[1:26:38] and when it speaks all hell shuts up
[1:26:48] so what happened that lady looked at
[1:26:50] that vision as an absolute
[1:26:56] and if you can ever look to this as an
[1:26:58] absolute
[1:27:00] heavens and earth will pass away but my
[1:27:03] word will never fail
[1:27:06] oh what a place he said it's just like a
[1:27:08] ship a ship has an absolute it's called
[1:27:10] an anchor
[1:27:11] that anchor goes down in the bottom of a
[1:27:13] sea and that water gets a rolling and
[1:27:16] get to
[1:27:16] rocking and the wave starts crashing it
[1:27:18] can only take that
[1:27:20] ship so far even waves have limitations
[1:27:25] it can only do so much it can only go
[1:27:28] far so far why
[1:27:29] because a ship has an absolute it has an
[1:27:31] anchor down there
[1:27:33] you can't see it you can't feel it maybe
[1:27:35] you can't you can't touch it
[1:27:36] but it's there how you know it's there
[1:27:38] because every time i've gotten the sin
[1:27:40] or something starts pulling me one way
[1:27:42] there's an anchor grabs there the devil
[1:27:45] starts blowing me over here there's an
[1:27:47] anchor grabs there
[1:27:48] amen we have an anchor it's not made of
[1:27:50] steel
[1:27:51] it's not made of some kind of man-made
[1:27:53] dogma man-made creed
[1:27:55] we have an anchor and that's the lord
[1:27:57] jesus christ
[1:27:58] and it's all the way tied down all the
[1:28:01] way down
[1:28:01] to the rock of ages and it's grabbing
[1:28:05] hold of that rock tonight
[1:28:06] and hell may be blowing against you and
[1:28:08] sin may be coming against you
[1:28:10] and the devil says i got you and the
[1:28:12] devil says you're going to die
[1:28:14] and the devil says that he's only got so
[1:28:16] much voice left
[1:28:17] [Applause]
[1:28:20] he's only got so many words left he's
[1:28:23] about to his last word
[1:28:25] he's about to come on somebody ah my
[1:28:28] mama
[1:28:29] he's about to his last voice he's about
[1:28:31] to his last moment
[1:28:35] hallelujah his authority's already been
[1:28:38] cast down
[1:28:39] it's already been broke i read about it
[1:28:43] jesus has the keys he don't even have
[1:28:46] the keys to his own house
[1:28:48] i don't know what he's bragging about
[1:28:49] over you tonight but tell them devil you
[1:28:51] ain't got no power
[1:28:52] you're a bluff you come here with that
[1:28:54] you might as well get out of here with
[1:28:56] that
[1:28:56] i ain't taking what you got i'm not
[1:28:59] taking your nonsense no longer
[1:29:01] i have an anchor
[1:29:02] [Applause]
[1:29:08] it's a final voice
[1:29:11] it's an anchor amen
[1:29:15] oh hallelujah
[1:29:18] let me get on down
[1:29:21] god has the final say over your life
[1:29:27] i'm going to say that one more time
[1:29:28] because i want it to hit hard tonight
[1:29:32] god has the final say over your life
[1:29:37] you know we face all kinds of situations
[1:29:38] that look permanent
[1:29:40] like that we're never going to get out
[1:29:41] of and it's never going to work out
[1:29:43] it's easy to get discouraged it's easy
[1:29:46] to accept that it just wasn't meant to
[1:29:48] be
[1:29:48] but let me tell you it's not over until
[1:29:50] god says it's over
[1:29:52] amen the medical report may not look
[1:29:54] good and that's
[1:29:55] but that sickness don't have the last
[1:29:57] words
[1:30:00] god has a final say people may be
[1:30:02] against you you may have opposition
[1:30:05] but people don't have the final say
[1:30:09] come on now i mean no disrespect to the
[1:30:12] doctors or the bankers or the lawyers
[1:30:14] or the experts or the judges they may be
[1:30:16] good people
[1:30:17] but they're not on the throne god is on
[1:30:20] the throne
[1:30:21] and him being for you is more than the
[1:30:24] world that's against you
[1:30:25] [Applause]
[1:30:28] hallelujah amen sister rachel don't
[1:30:30] forget him that's for you
[1:30:32] it's more than those that are against
[1:30:34] you
[1:30:36] hallelujah they don't have the final say
[1:30:38] but my god has the final say
[1:30:42] and god won't let you get into a problem
[1:30:45] that it can't get you out of
[1:30:48] oh this is shouting material here
[1:30:50] tonight there's not a problem god will
[1:30:52] let you get in
[1:30:53] that it can't get you out
[1:30:55] [Applause]
[1:30:56] he wouldn't let the three hebrew
[1:30:58] children go down to a furnace
[1:31:00] if he couldn't get him out of there if
[1:31:02] he was didn't know the fire wasn't going
[1:31:03] to harm them
[1:31:04] king nebuchadnezzar he thought he was in
[1:31:06] control
[1:31:07] he thought he had the final say he
[1:31:09] thought that fire would finish them off
[1:31:11] and that's about all that's what always
[1:31:13] happens the devil thinks he's got the
[1:31:15] final say
[1:31:16] he thinks he's going to finish you off
[1:31:18] he thinks but that's
[1:31:20] at this time he wasn't just dealing with
[1:31:22] ordinary people
[1:31:26] did you hear me man i'm going to need to
[1:31:28] win them brother aaron uh brother
[1:31:30] andrew glover thanks check check mike
[1:31:32] check check one two three
[1:31:36] this time king nebuchadnezzar was not
[1:31:39] dealing with ordinary people
[1:31:41] he was dealing with the children of the
[1:31:43] most high god
[1:31:45] [Applause]
[1:31:47] and it's time the devil knows you're not
[1:31:49] dealing with just ordinary people
[1:31:52] but you're dealing with blood bugs
[1:31:56] you're dealing with children that's been
[1:31:58] paid for
[1:31:59] with the price of god's blood
[1:32:03] and those children came out without even
[1:32:05] a smell of smoke on them
[1:32:08] there's something about you that makes
[1:32:10] you unstoppable
[1:32:13] you have an advantage you said me i
[1:32:15] don't feel like you have an advantage
[1:32:17] god on god not only breathe life into
[1:32:20] you but he's put a protection a defense
[1:32:22] around you
[1:32:23] nothing can touch you without his
[1:32:25] permission you're not at the mercy of a
[1:32:27] bad break or you're not at the mercy of
[1:32:29] sickness
[1:32:30] or an accident or you're not at the
[1:32:32] mercy of people that's against you
[1:32:34] none of that can stop your destiny
[1:32:37] none of that can stop who you are you're
[1:32:39] not going through life by yourself
[1:32:41] god is behind the scenes he's
[1:32:44] orchestrating it to your favor
[1:32:48] first peter 3 says jesus has the last
[1:32:51] word on everything
[1:32:52] and every one
[1:32:56] you may be dealing with sickness medical
[1:32:59] reports may be saying
[1:33:00] you're not going to make it that's one
[1:33:02] word but god has the last word
[1:33:05] a diagnosis is not a verdict
[1:33:11] let me tell that devil that one more
[1:33:13] time a diagnosis is not a verdict
[1:33:16] it's not a final word but the verdict is
[1:33:19] i'm the lord
[1:33:20] god that heals all diseases
[1:33:23] i am the restorer i am the giver of the
[1:33:26] life
[1:33:28] sickness you might have a say devil you
[1:33:31] might have a say
[1:33:32] but i have some good news what you say
[1:33:35] is subject
[1:33:36] to my god what you say is overruled by
[1:33:39] my god
[1:33:41] he has the final say over my life and
[1:33:43] everything that i go through
[1:33:50] instead of considering the circumstances
[1:33:52] you need to look at how big your god is
[1:33:56] and the bigger you make your god the
[1:33:58] smaller your circumstances become
[1:34:00] and the more faith begins to rise in
[1:34:02] your heart listen experts can be wrong
[1:34:06] somebody said it like this they said
[1:34:08] experts built a titanic amateurs built
[1:34:10] an ark

[1:34:18] they can make the most educated guess
[1:34:20] and say what they know
[1:34:21] but still be wrong
[1:34:25] what they fail to add into the equation
[1:34:28] is a see gene of god on the inside of
[1:34:31] you
[1:34:34] omnipotence on the inside of you

[1:46:00] you know i was reading today about
[1:46:01] lazarus it was a man some scholars have
[1:46:04] agreed that the sadducees

[1:46:08] stayed in him three days
[1:46:11] and of course there was arch for enemies
[1:46:12] of jesus

[1:46:33] excuse for this one oh his spirit was
[1:46:35] still there
[1:46:36] no he was gone sunk in
[1:46:41] stink all over his body but omnipotence
[1:46:44] stepped to the wall
[1:46:46] said lazarus come forth
[1:46:50] if he wouldn't have said lazarus there'd
[1:46:52] been a general resurrection
[1:46:56] but he called him he's here to call some
[1:46:59] seeds tonight
