children amen amen we want to welcome you here tonight to the services here for this anniversary weekend in 2017 we finished and dedicated this building to god and uh every year in october we've had some meetings there just in in memorial to the things that god has done i want you to know this church was built on the supernatural it wasn't man made at all it was god that did it and god has seen us all the way through and we want to thank god for his supernatural work in our lives you are seeing supernatural things everywhere you look there's a supernatural god doing supernatural things if you ever meet him you'll never be natural no more you'll be supernatural too amen change in a moment hallelujah what a promise we have as the children of god and we're not going down we're going up we're not sinking lower we got a world that has fallen around us we got people who have stepped out into unbelief and fallen in a bottomless pit just going over and over and over the world that we have is politics his systems is all falling it's a fallen world let me tell you according to revelation 12 even the devil is falling he's being cast down from heavenly places as a people of sins and i believe we're a part of that ascending people brother branham tells us in the countdown we're living in the astronaut age how many believes that tonight of course naturally we know that but now even now even um not just the government sentiment but just common men now are raising up becoming astronauts amen it just tells us where we're at there's a people ready to leave at this dimension amen go into the heavenlies where all things are possible it is the eagle age after all we're not sitting ducks we're flying eagles amen we're rising above the troubles of this world moving on into the heavenlies where all things are possible brother branham said people can't understand it when you talk about a shock coming just wait till that church starts moving up when that great eagle called the church of god redeemed by the blood of jesus christ spreads forth her wings and the power of the holy ghost begins to lift her up off the earth it's going to be a wonderful time well i'll tell you it's already happening there's a people rising on the winds of the holy ghost as the spirit of god has been released by the entire message amen i just say to you eagles tonight set your wings in the promise of god sail higher than you ever went in your life it's time to leave the earthly things and to move in the heavenlies where all things are possible amen amen we want to go to prayer tonight we want to remember the shoats family brother tim schultz he's a pastor in noel missouri he passed away last night and we want to pray for his family and the church there also there's a prayer request for sister khan of connecticut her son passed away last month her husband is in the hospital in critical condition i think that may be a covid related situation and we know we know there's dangers we know there's a devil going to the land that is that is absolutely put a squeeze on on churches or meetings just like this with some of you that are here today i understand hadn't been in church for two years because of it fear drives a lot of things but we're not afraid we were told be not afraid the words out of jesus mouth was fear not that's his words to us tonight we're not going to fear we're going to believe a man a couple of months ago some of you then some of you that came and some of your hearts were here with us as um we had a memorial service for sister karen and we had 500 people gathered from 14 different states in canada not one incident of kogit came out of that so we're believing the same thing for this meeting amen that the holy spirit had just put a wall of fire about us amen cause our faith to rise believe god's promise amen he's the healer we don't need to fear we need just to believe amen let's talk to the lord about these needs father there are many others across the land out on the internet across the way many in this building that's got very great needs desires are in their hearts lord many of them to be here some of them [Music] have not been able to gather with other eaglets for a long long time and things has prevented them from being together but lord you've allowed us to get together and then to be able to bring them into a service like this by the way of the internet we pray your blessings upon them and i would ask lord that you would do what we asked put a wall of fire about those that are here that there be no evil befall any of us that you'll keep us well and safe lord we're your children we just ask you bless your people bring healing lord we hear this brother schultz passing away after some days on the ventilator kobe related his wife lord in a in a rehab in a really needy condition will you be merciful your merciful father i pray god that you'll give comfort where only you can strengthen them in this time in the church there i pray lord also for the khan family that lord their precious family we understand that loves you and loves god's people and lord they have a need don't pass them by lord visit the hospital where brother khan is raise him up lord visit sister khan lord in her need in connecticut lord lift her up out of that condition she's in and bring healing lord spiritually physically and in every way and for your children gathered here many of them with burdens on their hearts many i'm saying i i i've got to rise higher than where i've been i know i need more jesus lord and there's every one of us because we cannot be like laodicea who has says i have needed nothing but oh god we have need of you tonight we open our hearts door we open every part of our lives we just say phyllis let her come lord the wind of the holy spirit and fill every heart lord with a new revival down on the inside may revival spread across the world and across the country as they listen in now lord and

redeemed sons and daughters of god come together like this put our lakes of fire together and i just pray that you'll be blessed in these meetings in a very very special way god will minister to you on a personal level if you don't know jesus i pray that you'll find it but i'll tell you he's not lost you're the one lost let him deal with your heart don't keep wandering out in sin and darkness when we got a savior that can rescue you from the from the terrors of hell that's around you allow him to do a work in your life if you've just been sanctified you need the holy ghost don't leave this meeting without it you make up your mind i'm going to receive what i need from god i've got to have the seal without that seal you won't go in a rapture you'll be left here for the tribulation amen i'll just say it this way if you're only sanctified you're probably in the most dangerous condition of anybody [Music] because you've had sins drop off and dealt with and cleansed and whatever but you haven't been filled up again get the holy ghost that's the most important thing for any person in their lives [Music] young person it would be greater than a new motorcycle or a fancy car [Music] it would be greater than the highest diploma that you could get to get the holy ghost is the greatest thing that a mortal can get is the holy spirit in their lives tonight you'll have opportunities and these services you'll have an opportunity for god to deal with your heart don't pass him by you need a closer walk with god is trying to get closer get what you need you press in don't waste a moment

how appropriately to thank uh you all but i want to say god bless you and and to give you our heartfelt thanks for your support to our youth camp there in august um the church that's the first uh first youth camp they've held and uh brother brother tim was just just such a blessing to back that and all the support of you and the saints and the young people that came and brother timothy coming up and preaching and i don't know you that if you wasn't there and you got to hear it i know you've got a blessing amen that was a powerful time in the lord amen and so brother erickson certainly wanted us to give our greetings to you and to thank you for that and say god bless you and to all the other saints and pastors that supported it so we just want to say god bless you tonight and as it is an honor always to be here with you uh tonight if we could just bow our hearts for a word of prayer tonight in starting this meeting i i just want to take a moment and maybe you could just if you could just lay your hand over on somebody i know you all shaking hands anyhow man so i want you to lay your hand on somebody and and let's ask the holy spirit to come in and take a hold of this meeting right now tonight heavenly father we bow our hearts tonight because you're the almighty god we face the very ground that we've come from father and lord we're asking you tonight that your mercy would be upon us be upon this assembly upon each and every person father lord you have said that we're that where two or three are gathered in your name that you would be in the midst of them the lord jesus we invite you tonight we ask you for your holy spirit to come and take this meeting lord use it for your glory father let the anointing of the lord come upon your word and father that it would move in a special way lord we invite you to the platform tonight before these people before everyone we admit our inabilities lord our inability to say or do anything lord but if you would just come by there'd be such a special thing done in these meetings lord we're inviting you tonight throughout these meetings but father right now while these believers had their hands laid one on the other we pray father that every spirit unlike you would be bound in this building right now lord by the authority of the bride of jesus christ we bind satan on every hand that he'd not be able to lift his head that he'd not been able to do one thing to hinder but father tonight in the name of jesus may the grace of god move over this meeting taking hearts and lives lord bringing such a freedom to your people father now lord we commit this meeting in thy faithful hands in the name of jesus we pray amen and amen god bless you tonight amen if you have your bibles we would like to look into the word of the lord amen we'll be looking in the book of mark the 11th chapter and i want to read here uh from the 12th verse mark chapter 11 and verse 12. it's a very powerful portion of the scripture and i think very pertinent to the day that we're living in knowing that the season and the times are set by the the word being vindicated in the age that it's meant to live amen in mark chapter 11 and verse 12 and on the morrow when they were come from bethany he was hungry and seeing a fig tree far off having leaves he came if happily he might find a thing thereon and when he came to it he found nothing but leaves the time of the figs was not yet and jesus answered and said unto it no man eat fruit from thee hereafter forever and his disciples heard it now i'm going to skip to the 20th verse and in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots and peter calling to remembrance saith unto him master behold the fig tree which thou cursed us is withered away and jesus answered him saying unto them have faith in god for verily i say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou moved and thou be cast into the sea shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe the things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore i say unto you what things soever you desire when you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them now in john the 14th chapter let's look in the eighth verse of course these two scriptures are connected john 14 and mark chapter 11. amen these these two are actually work right hand in hand in the end time john chapter 14 we want to look in the eighth verse philip saying unto him lord show us the father and it sufficeth us and jesus saith unto him have i been so long time with you and yet thou has not known me philip and he saith unto me has seen he that hath seen me have seen the father and how sayeth thou then show us the father believeth thou not that i am in the father and the father in me and the words that i speak unto you i speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works believe me that i am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very work's sake for verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than thee shall he do because i go unto my father and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will i do that the father may glorified in the son if you ask anything in my name i will do it amen we ask the lord to bless his word tonight as you may be seated i want to speak to you just a little bit tonight amen on the faith of god perfectly expressed the faith of god perfectly expressed amen these specific scriptures are very common into the church of the living god in this season as they should be uh we're thankful that these are common readings that these are things that are very known unto the church because this is the basis of where we take our faith these are the basis of why we teach the things we teach why we believe in the supernatural we believe in is because we're not just pulling these things out of the air or just imagining that some great thing could be done or that we're in some imaginary world but this is a reality that god is laid in his scripture and these scriptures are laying here as a promise tonight now i i believe in the perfect faith brother brown is going to read mark chapter 11 and and he'll he'll begin his a text and talk about perfect faith a little bit and he'll say but remember now that perfect faith needs the holy ghost and he'll talk about how the disciples in the beginning didn't have the perfect faith he said actually what they possessed is they possessed a power but they didn't possess a perfect faith and he'll actually use a case where they wasn't able to take care of the case and then the lord was asked why wasn't this case amended and jesus said because of a lack of faith so he showed them that they certainly had the power to do it but now whether they had the faith to operate it and he was showing this was the very case and this and brother branham will take it like this and say now branham tabernacle he said there's the bride today the holy spirit is here with power but you haven't got faith to move it do you see it'll take faith to move that and then he starts out to say it like this if i got a shell that i hand loaded and i'll know what it'll do by ballistics i like the word but i've got the gun i've got to fire the gun the fire has to get to the powder and the powder's got to get to the power but it's got to have the fire to light it off and the same thing the powder's in the shell but it needs faith to charge it and to throw it out that's what it takes a perfect faith to ignite the power of the holy spirit which we have now since he has come upon us faith to ignite these great things faith something that presents it to you see something to ignite it and brother brahm describes the faith he describes the word as such as a ballistics now there's a there's a lot you could study in this but of course ballistics is talking about mostly about rifle shooting and one thing that we have found out about rifle shooting is that you can study the ballistics and they can give you a dope you know uh in modern times now they've got rifles set down to the place where people are shooting elk at a thousand yards away one shot or two shots and they're killing their elk a thousand yards it almost didn't fare but what they've been able to do is they've been able to scientifically keep nailing down the ballistics and they get the barrels better they get the gun better they get the bullets better and what they're able to do is by doing that they're able to keep reproducing the same thing over and over again they're able to tell you before you ever pull the trigger exactly what that gun is able to do and they do it by ballistics and they have proved it around the world you can take 270 maybe begin to shoot it and if you'll set that thing maybe inch or two high at 100 yards it's dead on it 200 then it starts dropping a few inches maybe 18 inches at 300 and and so on until it gets way out in a thousand yards it may be dropping 10 feet or whatever according to the velocity of the bullet but if you can know the velocity of the bullet and you can know that you can know the weight of the bullet and you can know the charge behind it you can accurately pinpoint what that bullet's going to do at a certain place at a certain time and what it's able to do so what that is is a ballistics it is a potential of what something could do but that gun cannot do nothing till you pull the trigger you can carry that 270 around you can say well am i going to do this or am i going to do this i actually have a 28 nosler brother matt mclaren built and he says it'll do a lot of things but amen since all this uh since all this uh the the hikes and the rates of all the ammo and things i hadn't pulled the trigger on it one time in a while because it it it just but yet they it'll do that it'll do exactly what it'll do but i i know one thing's for certain is that that translates when brother brahm talks about it he moves it into the spiritual realm and begins to say that the word is a ballistics of our faith and that the word can be told exactly what it will do in a certain season so so faith is something that talks about long-range so the word all the way back in the days when the apostles was writing it was telling us what it would do in other ages to come and how that they're able to do it now i know for sure that the word will do exactly what it did in that day it will do it again that's brother brahman's point in ballistics that it'll do it again now abraham see brother brahm said the thing is he said maybe you've got a gun and you'll say it'll shoot it's a true shooting gun i have to hang it up on the wall he said oh sure i got a gun he said but what do you do with it see if it just hangs on the wall and that's the faith of the people you say well i'm a christian and i believe god can but what are you going to do about it you've got to put it to work you've got to turn it loose you've got to do something with it now here's what brother brown said he said you've got to get out and hunt up the devil where he says you're still hurting or and you just say he's a liar you put a beat on him you get a scope on him and don't be afraid to pull the trigger because it'll go off as sure as anything amen he's saying to us what we need to do is hunt up the devil and where the devil is saying well you're still hurting or you still got this same problem or this same situation he said if you put the bead right on him and pull the trigger amen this gun will do the same thing in this day that it done in the days of the apostle one thing that we're certain about tonight is that jesus christ remains to be the same yesterday today and forever amen it does not matter the age of the time of the church he is an unchanging god with unchanging ways and whatever he did he is still doing tonight because he is a mighty god and the word is still going to do it amen i think of the prophet talking about pulling the trigger and it's going to hit a target amen i'll tell you something tonight i've got something in my target amen i've got an old devil that's running around the churches of the living god trying to bring fear and havoc and trouble amen we got that old devil right in our target tonight and we're saying to that devil you're not going to get away with it you're you're not going to get away with these things in the church of the living god because there is a bride on the earth that knows who she is what she's doing here and what this word can do amen this word will defeat satan anywhere any place anytime under any condition you can put this word in any form whether it's bridegroom form or whether it's in bribe form it's still just as powerful tonight as it's ever been because it is the word is god i believe tonight we ought to we ought to be able to pull the trigger amen and get the same results it was got in the days of the book of acts because there's one thing for certain no matter what satan is saying no matter what he's doing in this generation amen there is another book of acts church that's on the scene today i'm not just making that up friends amen but the prophet said that if there is ever another original shoot off of the tree of life it will be another book of acts written right behind that church and i believe tonight that there is a book of acts church on the scene i'm not one that believes that it's coming i'm not thinking it's on the road somewhere tonight but i believe we're setting right here tonight i believe we have come together and then to get together against the devil and release the power of god in the church of the living god my goodness amen won't you go ahead and give him some praise amen he's a powerful god isn't he is that powerful god i know the devil fought me yesterday all they said well it'll be the first night after a while i finally said well it might be the first night but this ain't the first meeting we've had it man it might be the first night of this meeting but it ain't the first meeting you've been in and it ain't the first service you've been in and i tell you what i believe some people come to this meet with expectation in their heart i mean we come expecting god to do something we come expecting miracles in the house of god i tell you i don't know what you come for but i come to see the god in heaven perform a miracle in the church of the living god i want to see miracles in this meeting you say brother amen i don't know if you're if you should wish for those things i'm not wishing i'm not hoping i'm standing on bible-based doctrine that jesus said whenever two or three have gathered in my name i will be in the midst of him and he is a miracle-working god if he worked miracles he went 2000 years ago he's still working miracles tonight he but let us get an atmosphere of the holy ghost with the power of god to perform miracles and work many things in the church of the living god i believe healings come i believe revival comes i believe the holy ghost comes i believe people are saved and people are delivered when the angel of the lord comes in the camp of god there's a shout that comes in the camp as the power that comes in the camp amen you don't have to feel sorry for us tonight we are not a helpless hopeless people we are people that have been armed with a ballistic missile i must say of the lord we know what it will do we know what will happen when the church of the living god begins to turn loose as the power that comes from the house of god well go ahead and shut that deadlock [Applause] devil i'm not gonna give him one meeting i'm not gonna give me one sermon i'm not gonna give him one song i believe the church of the living god can put that devil on the run right now if one can make a thousand and two can make ten thousand look what a church of a living god anointed armed dangerous on fire for god look at what we're able to move to that people say to me all the time why in the world why the world you preach about people shouting and praising god i tell you why these people get healed when they praise god miracles happen when they praise god god comes in the room know the spirits are conquered while people are praising god depression leaves when you're praising god you can't be depressed with your hands up amen amen you can't be depressed while you're praising amen so if you've been fighting depression just stop praising the lord there ain't no devil can hold you there in [Applause] this is the church of the living god it's time to remind the devil who you are what you have come here for we didn't come here just for another meeting we come here to ring the heavens with waves and power of the pride of jesus christ anointing gifted the preacher who do you think you are i tell you who i am i'm an ash 238 talking baby that has been filled with a holy ghost that has been given a message of deliverance and power i've been told i've been led to believe that the angels of the lord will be in the building tonight i've been led to believe that if i preach the message heaven will back up what's being spoken in the house of god i billion believe god led me to believe this message will create an atmosphere if we can believe right now the atmosphere that's going on in this building they might not be one sick person leave the meal you say can't happen on the first night tell me god created on the first day when there was nothing he made something and there might not be nothing going on in your house tonight but amen let the grace of god come in the church tonight shake it off let the power of grace manifest itself in power it'll manifest itself in life you don't have to worry about god all you've got to do is praise amen and worship and let him come and answer it he's the god that answers it you don't have to make miracles happen you don't have to make healings happen it's not your word it's not your promise amen it's not your reputation but it is god's it's god's word and it's god's authority and we stand on the word of god tonight i think it's time to climb up climb jacob's ladder take another step up amen let the ladder of god climb until every reason is gone every reason to disbelieve every reason to fear every reason to misunderstand let it go tonight and say god i didn't come here to reason the word i come here to buy the word i come here to eman the word [Applause] it means place be our god and let everything that has breath praise ye the lord when that bride recognizes who she is when that bride sees who she is ain't no devil gonna stop her praise ain't no devil gonna stop the joy that's ringing in her heart people say to me all the time so well brother wayne what about this person what about this person hey man somebody swell somebody believed for healing and they passed away i told them i said well i'll tell you this you'll never master that man or that woman he said what do you mean brother brown said however they went to sleep it's the way they'll wake up [Applause] however they went to sleep was the way they'll wake up can you imagine an old saint amen like paul with his head on the chopping block and they went to cut off his head he said oh death where is thy sting and wave where is thy victory and one of these warnings on the resurrection amen paul will come back out of the ground the same way he went down he's coming back again you will never stop her you'll never stop the church of the living god it's too far now she's going too far she's over the hump brother she's broke out in gravity she's in another dimension of power in another dimension of faith you won't stop her now now you won't weigh her down you can tie what you want to to her and she'll just keep her moving you can do what she wants she's just going to keep them moving [Applause] oh yes sir said preacher what are you saying i'm saying that you've got to rely on what god made you god made you a believer god made you to believe for these things god made you to worship i can't help how i am i can't help what i do i can't help it no more than a grasshopper can help me in a grasshopper or a butterfly being a butterfly or a deer being a deer there is something made them what they are and there's something made you who you are and it was god that made you and when he made you he didn't just make a human brother kenny he put a part of deity that on the inside of that human being that's why that you're another kind of creature that's why you're a believer that's why you believe when there's nothing else to believe but you believe anyhow that's why well glory to god amen i think we come to have church i believe it if you recognize your position do you know that ain't nothing can hold you if you only recognize your position tonight hey nothing can stop you amen if you only recognize because one thing you'll find out god christ and the word are all the same amen and then brother bram said and you and christ and god and the word are all the same thing amen you become the word when you receive the word and when the word of god came into you i hope you're hearing me when the word of god came into you amen do you know that it is an unfailed word what is coming to you it's not the words of a man but it's the words of god what you've received from the lord is something you can stand on it's something that you can stand do you know you're not anointed to come here tonight to fall you wasn't anointed to come to this place tonight to stumble and fall but god anointed you to rise god anointed you to stand when everything else was fallen that's why you're still standing in the most wicked age that ever was you're standing in the most terrible time that ever was you're still standing you know why you're standing because you can't fall eve fell from the word but the blood is the word you can't call because you are the word and heavens and earth can pass away but my word it shall never fall you have been ordained and predestinated of god to stand in this wicked age oh understand what an hour at a time by the way how could you say with a word because before you were you were thought and you're not just the thought of a man you're the thought of god and god's thoughts are eternal [Applause] come on now god starts your eternal he said by the way now i can't see that if you see that you will see many things if you see his thoughts or eternal you'll see why you feel the way you do tonight if you'll see his thoughts are eternal you'll understand the predestination behind your life there is nothing that can change in time what god did in eternity [Applause] there's no buttons the devil don't have any buttons in time to change what god did in eternity and we have come from eternity in a place called time but god has activated a gene that's on the inside of us and has anointed us to go back to the eternal realm and we come out of and there ain't no devil can change what god did there here he said by the way what are you saying i'm saying you're out of his reach hey man your your body's not out of his reach your spirit might not be out of his reach but your gene seed is outside of the reach of the devil that gene comes from god amen who sent it into your soul to stabilize you in an unstable world in an unstable time that there would be a gene of life on the inside and when the holy ghost begins to quicken that you you will never be that word unless first you were thought is that right unless you were thought you can't be that word now what kind of thought were you to begin with a premeditated thought of god and being a premeditated thought then that means that god had you in him before the world began yes amen you'll be seated if you won't stand tall that's okay i don't want to make you feel uncomfortable you ain't me i'm i hey we'll preach like this all night i love this you see what it is it's the very thought of god that has come down on the inside of you and the whole thing is only god materializing ain't nothing out of cater ain't nothing going wrong it's god materializing but he's materializing in the season he planned to materialize him then you know you say you say well brother wayne how in the world are you living that kind of life i'll tell you how i'm living it's by the faith of the son of god it's not our life we are living it is the life from the faith of the son of god you see you've got to have faith in what the word says you are now that's what jesus relied on he didn't rely on whether he was hungry or whether he was full he didn't rely on whether the devil was tempting him or not he relied on what god made him and you've got to have faith in what the word says you are amen and when the word of god comes into you it's made manifested because you are a believer and the believer is i love this quote and the believer is the faith of god that moves you the faith of god is what a believer is in other words you're not just here amen by yourself the faith of god is in you the faith of god that created the world is in you the faith of god that spoke when there was nothing and created a world is what's inside you tonight it's not a different faith it is the faith of god that said i will have a bride without spot a wrinkle and he spoke it but here it says tonight it's not something coming this is not something on the way this is the faith of god expressed this is the word made manifested when you think about what is a bride she is the manifestation of the word she is a living oracle of god what is that word bride well just look around a little if you want to see the face of god you're looking at the face of god when you look at the bride of jesus christ you see where it's at tonight that's why things cannot move you because you have been tied to an absolute of word that made you the faith of god i think of paul in acts 20 and 24 when he said none of these things move me well there was a lot going on in paul's day but paul wouldn't be moved by none of it because paul was a prisoner paul was a prisoner how many times you ever hear paul start out a sermon and say i paul a prisoner of jesus christ an apostle under the gentiles in a couple of the books he starts it out that way i paul a person brother man preaches a whole message on me i paul a prisoner well do you know before you can ever really have power you've got to become a prisoner before you can ever really have power in your life you have to become a prisoner to that faith of god that is on the inside of you it has to become a prisoner to that or a time post amen as paul was a man a prisoner of theology but when the light of god come over him it broke the shackles of theology and enacted a spirit or a gene that was in him that tied him to the vindicated word of the age he was living in do you see he was a powerful man once you become a prisoner of god i think of the scripture when joseph was in the scripture you see joseph before he ever went into any kind of a trouble before he ever had any kind of problems god showed joseph he would reign in power but before he could ever reign in power he had to first become a prisoner it looked like he was going down but truly the way up is down the more humble you can become to the word the more exalted god can put a man amen joseph because of him becoming a prisoner was exalted in the kingdom of pharaoh to where he was able to exercise authority and power because of being a prisoner hey man i think of this often i think of oh brother paul i think of his i think about his testimony and how paul was when when uh when he was walking that road you know it must have been a shock to paul when he got saved and realized that he had been persecuting the very thing that he that the thing that he thought was the worst actually was the thing that was the salvation of his life when he realized he was persecuting jesus christ which was that pillar of light how paul must have felt it meant when the when the shackles dropped off of his eyes and and he became as paul would call it he moved from being the prisoner of gamalia to being a prisoner of christ now i i was i was looking at this the other day and i was thinking about poor old paul amen when he become when he become a prisoner and he had to show back up and preach and he had to go back over and all the other apostles and and their other clean lineages and where they come from and i think about old paul you know sometimes i tempered felon he meant he was guilty of killing the very people that he was now going to go preach i mean i imagine it must have been some long nights for paul it must have been some some agonizing times for paul to come to grips with who he had been and what god had made him do you realize what kind of prisoner he was to even admit that he was an apostle of jesus christ what kind of prisoner had he become what did he have to master before he could acknowledge that he was an apostle of jesus christ he had to master everything in his life to be able to acknowledge to what god had made and sometimes what god makes you amen it seems big but it's hard to acknowledge what god makes you because sometimes people assume that that's some kind of a puffed up maybe they didn't deserve it or something you know but paul was a a powerful man with a powerful revelation i i was just uh i was just thinking about him the other day when brother adam would say things like he never done it in the first place how many likes that quote well if you don't like that quote you ain't read it hey man he said but but you ever notice brother philippe said as though you've never done it in other words justification is though that you've never done really you've done it but you're getting treated like you've never done it hey man i've heard stories about men who spent their lives in prison who were completely innocent i've heard stories where people were put in jail nearly went to the death row and come to find out they wasn't guilty of nothing and one day they just turned them loose hey man i i've heard that i was i was on the airplane the other day and i was sitting here thinking over some of these things i i was just sitting over there writing you know how you do on the airplanes i'm just sitting alone thinking about some of these quotes brother brown said you never done it in the first place i was thinking about it like that and about these men who get out of jail because they was innocent and this and that and i just sitting there contemplating my life where i come from and what i had been in a minute i just stopped and the people around me probably thought i was crazy because i just talk it out loud you know i just stopped myself lord i i i i just don't fit that description very well because i wasn't innocent and somebody turned me loose amen i'm guilty i i deserve all the punishments that i get i've done everything that they said that i did i went all the places they said i went i i was exactly who i was supposed to or who i was being at that time and i was sitting there contemplating that the lord got to thinking about it hey man the more i thought about it the worse i felt and i said after washable lord how in the world then can a prophet announce it's as though as i never done it i said you're going to have to help me see it in the scripture because i just don't understand i don't really don't from my own personal experience lord i don't understand how that you could that you could give me the grace and the pardon that you give me with a man that i was i'm sitting here discussing it with the lord and it was almost an audible voice brother aaron i heard him say to me he said you are a barabbas i was sitting on that plane and i could hear that i literally could hear a voice he said you are a barabbas and i thought for a minute i thought barabbas oh i don't know who barabbas was y'all know who barabbas was barabbas was a prisoner he was a prisoner for different reasons he was a prisoner because of his sins and he was a prisoner because of things he'd done wrong he was a prisoner from the problems that he done a thievery and murder he was he was a really bad man and they put him in prison brother joel they put him in prison and you know that barabbas was scheduled to be executed the very day jesus was being crucified how many knows he was going to be he was executed he was already under judgment he had already had an executioner sentence upon him he was already in the prison waiting execution and while he was up there laying in the cold i love how brother branham says it he said that he said that a roman jailer come walking up the the sidewalk that morning he said that bartimaeus is laying over there cold and shivering hungry scared he said he's worried about today he's trying to prepare himself for a cross no way to do it at all knows he deserves it he said he's laying there in the corner and he can hear a soldier coming up the the sidewalk there the walk and he said he could hear the clink of the armor and the slap of the sword he said when that big roman soldier come to the door and looked over and he said barabbas was kind of shuttering and he laid there the big door began to open brad was raised up off of the ground he said i guess i'm ready i guess i'm ready to go and the man took a hold of him and got his hands and started taking the the shackles off his hands and built down and started taking the shackles off his legs and bravo said what are you doing why why are you taking these things off i'm supposed to go die and that roman he put his arm around barabbas and he said come here i want to show you something and he walked him over to the side he said you see down there you see them three crosses down there that can only be three men today that will be crucified and we have a law here in israel you know very well that there's called a passover pass and on the day of passover amen they give him one free person that can go completely free in the honor of the passover and he says he said well what's that got to do with me sir he said well do you see that man hanging in the middle down there his name is jesus and he's an innocent man and he never done nothing to nobody i i said in his trial the other day he had nothing against him at all but they they decided to crucify him and he's going to take your place up there on that cross and bravo said but what does that mean to me sir he said i'll tell you what it means to you it means you're free listen wait a minute you mean i'm free he said so i'm telling you you're free to go but but i don't have i don't have to do anything i don't have to i don't have to do anything there's nothing required of me at all he said no sir you're not understanding that man's paying your penalty the penalty is being paid but that man's paying it and when barabbas realized that he was completely free he walked off of that hill amen i don't know what first church he started but i would imagine he was a preacher and i was a preacher of grace and mercy he probably had a jailhouse ministry he probably was effective among all the other prisoners brother later on i sat there on that i sat there on that plane i started i just immediately got my computer up and typed in i am barabbas and sure enough brother branham said i am a barabbas i said well praise god the prophet was a barabbas too and i started reading that story of the roman soldier setting it loose and when i was sitting and reading that story it just dawned on me that the power of the gospel is so powerful that even when a roman soldier was preaching it it still gave liberty even when a man who wasn't called to preach was telling the story that there was people still went free well let me tell you something nice amen this message of the cross this message of the resurrection has got so much power and it will set every person at liberty it'll set every child free it'll set every heart free you don't have to be bound and imprisoned with lust and undrivingness and drugs and alcohol there's a god here tonight amen [Applause] but let me tell you as god has liberated you he took your place at the cross no needs you to be bound tonight you can be completely free right here in the house of god you can be free to rejoice you can be free to dance you can be free take your liberty and enjoy god come on and i'm not trying to put nobody up i'm trying to give somebody enough liberty to shake loose i've been so loyal to seeing spirit it's so heavy thing that you got to carry around all the time but we don't have to carry ain't that anymore we have bear the name of jesus christ i'm a barabbas and i am a free man i've been freed by the holy ghost but i have become personal to another but as a prisoner of jesus christ healing is mine joyous mind love is mine peace is my deliverance is mine as a prisoner of christ holy ghost feelings and power has been given to the church [Applause] you know paul paul being a prisoner i thought about poor paul i thought about him and i thought about his writings in the book of romans can you imagine when paul who was a seed of abraham the stalk amen he said he was born on the eighth day amen he actually was circumcised he was a very he was a very eloquent man taught very eloquently and was humbled down to follow this message and while he was following this amen he had killed me and and he had persecuted the church and i imagine long nights but when god inspired the man to write the book of romans it's a powerful thing in romans 4 7 when paul begins to pen and saying blessed are these whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered for blessed is the man to whom the lord will not impute sin he's writing about the seed of abraham paul is writing about the seed of abraham have you ever thought about this paul is the seed of abraham and he's writing about himself concerning his former life and he was saying god has blessed me and the blessing on me is he has forgiven my iniquities amen and he's covered my sins and he will not impute my iniquity against me do you know what that means that means god didn't have a book marking down paul's wrongs but under paul's conversion his book was thrown in the sea of forgiveness and deliverance come to paul's life amen he was able to write that blessed is the man whom the lord will not impute sin he was speaking of what david said concerning the seed of abraham who could have preached that better than david who could have preached it better than david king david who failed his family who fell his life with all of his struggles and all the troubles that were there remember that remember that king david amen who was exposed under the ministry of nathan and had to be repented he even himself said he deserved death but god rich in mercy had a prophet say back to him david you'll surely not die remember the grace that was extended and david wrote a disgrace in the book of psalms which which paul would be speaking of psalms 103 and psalms 32 i'll tell you it's a secret and a powerful thing i know you know the scripture but i'd like to quote it to you psalms 103 and 1 said david bless the lord o my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name bless the lord o my soul and forget not all of his benefits who forgiveth all that iniquity and who healeth all thy diseases he blessed the lord him that don't forget the benefits now amen he's a healer of diseases but he forgiveth all hey can you say it with me he forgiveth all thine iniquity you say preacher what are you saying i'm saying there's a reason to bless the lord tonight i'm saying that david was instructing you on the way to praise god no matter the circumstances of your life no matter the situation no matter the troubles there is a secret coming from david having unstoppable worship have an unstoppable praise david knew how to praise god anywhere anytime under any situation if there was a man who should have quit praising the lord it was david but david said i'll bless the lord because of the goodness of the lord not because of the goodness of david not because of what david could do or what david couldn't do he blessed the lord because the goodness of god and let me tell you if we would start blessing the lord because of his goodness if we would start praising the lord because of his goodness i tell you what would happen that would be an eruption of a stimulated praise from the house of god because god is so good that you can never praise god enough to make up for what he's done for you and i there ain't nobody like jesus there ain't nobody done anything for us like jesus he said preacher amen i i think i think uh that you're a little bit crazy well you think i'm crazy if you want to amen but i am a free man amen i might be what people think i'm a fanatic but i'm not i have found a channel to worship god in every circumstance of my life i have found a way to put the lord before me and worship god at all times amen what is it it's something that can deny the natural senses and receive the holy spirit i'll tell you what it is it's a super sense that god gives you do you know that god gave you the same sense in you that he created the world with the same thing he created the world with is on the inside of you then that god that stood there when there was nothing and said let there be and it came forward out of nothing indivisible light the same god that did that the way he did that is on the inside of every believer here tonight that has the baptism of the holy ghost that supersense is god it's the faith of god in you that's the part of god that comes into you and gives you a super sense super because it is able to go over all your natural senses it moves past all your natural senses look at this amen when we look at this tonight amen the prophet of god said in looking to the unseen he said what we need to do is not think for ourself but let our mind amen and let the mind of christ come into us we are not to think for ourself and we're to call to contrary to anything except what he said as though it was not no matter what our eyes claim to be we do not live by what we see we live by what we believe that's how the church is alive by what we believe that's how we live it's not what we see but by what we believe amen it is there in ii corinthians when paul said for this cause we faint not though our outward men perish the inward man is renewed day by day for our light affliction is but for a moment but it worketh far more exceeding an eternal weight of glory while we look not at the things which are seen but we are at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal so there is a way to break the sound barriers of this world the prophet of god said we can break the barrier we can get past the barrier he said but we're going to do it he says see we can shout the victory of a living god once we pass the barrier by looking to the unseen the way to get past a barrier in your life is to look to the unseen [Applause] whatever barrier comes up in your life whether it's a sin barrier whether it's an unbelief burial whether it's a reasoning or a doubt or some feeling that's come upon you there is a way to get past the bearer and it's by the unseen world now when you look at this you'll find out that god has a way to get it by but natural man is bound to the senses of man but the spirit of god amen gives you a super sense now really you can't really believe until you're regenerated you can't really believe until you've been filled with the holy ghost see he sees people say well brother wayne i think i did but listen what a prophet said he said listen you're only taking what somebody else said what you've learned by intellectual what you've learned by the natural senses but when the sixth comes in the holy spirit it takes away all the reasoning these six senses of these five senses and you lift up into the sixth one amen it'll take it'll make you believe things that you can't see that you can't taste you can't smell it you can't hear it it does something for you then you can say jesus christ amen because you have witnessed it it's not an intellectual teaching it's what you have experienced you see the faith of god produces an experience in your life to believe god regardless to believe god whatever's taking place you said brother wayne the situations around me are so dark that you've got something in you that you can literally create a world and go live on it if there was not a law that possessed to keep you from doing it the authority and power to create a world is in you right now you don't have to go somewhere and get it if you're a believer you don't have to go somewhere and store it up you don't have to go somewhere and collect it from a certain guy in a certain place as a believer who has received the holy ghost the same sense that was in god that created the world is in that believer and the power that could create a world is in you right now you say right now i said right now man is omnipotent man is all-powerful man is unlimited when he comes in contact with god you say well i know some powerful things but there is nothing more powerful than a believer who is in contact with his god a believer in contact with god has the ability to create by the spoken word a believer who comes in contact with god has a faith on the inside of them that can believe every word that god has spoken do you know there's things anointed for this aid that other ages have not been able to express do you know that there are words that are anchoring in you that could not anchor in any other generation even when brother branham was preaching the message perfect faith go look it up he's preaching along and he comes to mark the 11th chapter and he talks about jesus they've been cursing that victory and then he turns around he says and if you say unto this mountain he said then that puts you right back in the scripture see he says now it's pretty deep he said and he's passing right over you because it can't anchor and i thought isn't that something because that's exactly what happened in the days of isaiah when isaiah was prophesying to a congregation and he said a virgin shall conceive brother brother said that word that come out of that prophet's mouth circled the earth for 600 years waiting for our heart to anchor into and when it found that little woman mary the word anchored in that heart now i want to say something maybe some of them are sitting there that day maybe it did anchor in a few but that word was being spoke right then and a prophet maybe didn't know it but god knew that there was a future generation coming that that word of mark 11 was going to anchor in their souls it cannot anchor everywhere you said brother wayne if it's a word why couldn't it anchor jesus explains it he said the word was put in as a seed and it fell into ground he said and some were some were ground of thorns and thistles and some with rocks it shows you that the word is broadcast over a great big area he said but sure as it fell among them he said it also fell among good ground and brother man said what is good ground he said that's pre-prepared ground he said that ground was prepared before the foundations of the world do you recognize something tonight that god for ordained you before the world began to believe this word as sure as god spoke it he knew that there would be a bride it would fall into in the last days you said brother wayne how do i know i'm that bride because there's something in your heart that's expressing it and believing it and it's falling on the inside of you it's expressing and falling on the inside of you it's a seed in a good ground now if you like that in the bible i can show it to you in the book of romans brother bram said romans 8 28-34 ephesians 1 1-5 and that's what works his faith expressed it falls into that ground of the bride says she's pre-prepared and ordained before the world begin to actually come into the church amen now you say preacher what are we supposed to do i think it's powerful because brother branham turns around and says to us he said and i believe there's a church on this road tonight now he's saying that in perfect faith there's a church on the road you say how could he be saying it back there there's a church on the road because he was creating it right there he was he was sending forth a word that would bring a church in the future that would be a church of the faith of god it would be a spoken word seed bride you wouldn't just be another church you would be the word of god spoken into a generation and activated by the power of the living god you didn't just show up you didn't just crawl into the church but the god of all heaven foreword danged you and sell you and brought you into the house of god no man come to me except my father draw him is that what he said is that what he said amen then jesus said i do nothing unless i see it with my father and my father worketh and i worketh to it are you hear me no man comes unless my father then worked it out and god has already worked it out of how you was going to get here and how you would be sitting in the seat tonight are you hearing me barnabas god worked it out he worked it out so you can shout and you can preach so you can believe but you can have faith while that devil all better ready to get out of here i feel like it's a really bad night for the devil a really bad night for the devil amen because see a prophet was showing us she's on the road people say on the road that that bride's been on the road the whole time but what's this prophet now stepping in position identifying the season and the people for this promises of this age you said prove it by the bible i'm glad you asked go over to the book of joshua and look in the sixth chapter and see if there wasn't some walls around a little woman named rahab [Applause] a bride type come on she was a gentile being redeemed under joshua's ministry she never even come up in the first two polls she never even intended across the jordan she wasn't even in the scripture but when the jordan was crossed and joshua went dividing the land there was a gentile for an adoption anointing come on church y'all know the law she didn't deserve it she was a prostitute she was a gentile she was in a walled city law said she couldn't even come out under the jubilee but god worked it out god worked it out with joshua he said joshua you march around these walls and they walked around the walls but on the seventh day amen on the seventh time all the trumpets sounded together and with one voice the walls begin to come down listen if you can't come out from behind the wall and you belong to god he'll tear the wall down god worked it out with joshua turn out the wall and bring my people out of there you're in a jailhouse of sin god will tear down the jailhouse i know you'll do it as paul as barnabas they were locked away but they got to please him like you're praising tonight and the walls got to shake it i got all my shouting shoes the walls started coming down the earth started quaking the gentile in the story began to say he was going to kill himself didn't say it out loud paul never saw him paul he was out of the reach inside of paul but in the middle of that dark jail he screams out to a roman soldier soldier boy [Applause] don't take your life believe on jesus christ and that same voice that was in the days of paul has sounded out in this day and right up there amen in washington or bc there was a soldier coming the back of brother man's meetings remember that soldier boy don't take your life believe oh jesus christ and the walls will come down you say walls yeah they were walls i guess it's okay to say what it was it was walls he said what was wrong with a man he had had a homosexual relationship with a man one time and was confused whether he was homosexual or not and the devil was telling him you're not normal you'll never be normal but when he got under the presence of that ministry of the son of man he looked back to where he come from and he said you're a real man son you're not that kind of person at all turn around and go home to your family and the man started coming down the sidewalk i'm free i'm free i'm free well let me tell you if that man could sing in that day what about the church of the living god he fixed up this meeting he fixed up his service here the walls of jericho as they crumbled to the ground the power of god released come on way out we have never seen him cross the jordan we have never seen the red sea she didn't but she believed it all the same she never saw the battles but she believed it all the same you know why because she was a believer amen and she was your type come on bride you might not have been there when the bridge fell but you believe it come on i wasn't there when the prophet did those things but i believe it anyhow because i am a believer so brother wayne what are you actually saying i'm saying that this bride has been being worked out to come to this age that we're living in right now and god has done some very outstanding things amen to get you to the position you're sitting tonight god has done some very outstanding miracles to let you set where you're sitting to let you believe what you believe i am not a fanatic i am led to believe what i'm saying i am led to believe that there is an angel that accompanies this message i have led to believe that that angel is right here in the building tonight i'm led to believe it's the same angel that was in the deal of lines with danger that was at the red sea crossing with moses that was the same angel that was with joshua at the walls and he's sitting in the building tonight to deliver the children of god from sicknesses and diseases i am led to believe that god is a god of miracles i am led to believe that there is no weapon born against us that little hospital i'm not going to give satan an inch around i'm not going to give him one inch of my ground i'll fight that devil i'll fight him in the car i'll fight him on the parking lot i'll find him in the church but i will never surrender i'll never back up i'll never step aside no sir you're a miracle church you're a [Applause] [Music] circumstances don't talk to me about circumstances until you explain to me how lazarus could be four days in the grave and come out of there don't talk to me about circumstances until you explain to me you've got to explain to me how job can say though the skin works eat this body in my flesh shall i see god circumstances abraham was 25 years and he couldn't have a child but he did not stagger he meant he didn't stag her you know i didn't stagger because he was persuaded he was persuaded that god was more than able to work it out he could give him a new body he could change his life circumstances oh come on church you're not a people where it matters with circumstances we won't even consider the circumstance no sir there's a super sense in you that will be blind to anything that's contrary to the word of god i won't even look at it i won't even measure it i won't believe it i won't ask for to let any faith because circumstances is not what i'm talking about i'm talking about the faith of god expressed perfectly in a bride who stands in the evilest age it ever was and defies satan on every inch of ground and he tries to take [Applause] we got nurses sitting here to find satan in his hospitals we've got policemen to find satan in in the cars aiming out on the streets even what are we doing there's a people of god that are defined that old devil you know you know what we're really dealing with amen i know satan wanted to put it on circumstances but somebody's going to ignore them because they have a different report to believe [Applause] if that's the only report we had was a medical one we'd just have to shut up and sit down but we got a different one we got another report we believe we have been delivered of god a report that has been paid for in the blood of jesus christ [Applause] oh i know the devil don't like this one if you can watch a pressure come these days you kill this one brother man said he went into a hospital room with a young man dying of diphtheria and that young man's name was bob bosworth it was brother bosworth's son and he was dying of diphtheria and brother adam went and prayed for him at the request of the mother and father natural brother and pray he said the boy is healed that's the safe the lord and the woman raised up and started hugging my husband and they started hugging one another and saying thank god thank god our boy is going to live and the nurse began to say what are you doing praising god at this kind of moment amen everything says they're dying amen but he says oh but wait a minute honey you have been trained to only look at your instruments but i have been trained to look at the word of god the word says he's healed the word says he's healed he said preacher i know about somebody that claimed that i know about this and i feel this and i in those channels of reasoning in those channels of memory you will be a defeated being but if you'll step out of your reasoning and get back into the word of god there'll be a faith that'll come into your heart there'll be no devil there'll be no power there'll be nothing that can defeat you because there's a victory there's a victory in the word of god faith is your victory it masters every circumstance it is the conqueror have everything of your life you are not a helpless hopeless group of people god has so fixed this up but the devil is defeated before he ever got started i'll shout that devil down not here satan not an evil light tabernacle not in the house of the lord amen there's a group of people that believe [Applause] it's a preacher i'll tell you we've been having some hard times around here all right i got that come on it's a hard time it's a hard time for everybody this is the darkest evilest corruptest age it's ever been there's more trouble going on right now than in the history of mankind according to daniel the 12th chapter be greater trouble since the days of beginnings according to matthew 24 it'll be brother ramsey and it's in its fruit now and it's in his fulfillment now and it ain't done nothing but got darker since 1960 but somehow satan has tried to convince you that if he can get it dark enough he can whip you if he can get the valley low enough he can defeat you he is a dumb devil because god has already fixed this meeting up god's already fixed some things and put it together and he's already got a miracle in the making right here in the church of the living god he said by the way in these kinds of times this is where god really likes to work god really likes ask them hebrew boys god don't even move till it's a very mass moment but when he moves he moves [Applause] i tell you this i i'm a bible reader and that's why i find something i think is pretty good the other day i was reading along there in the bible and i got to reading about a battle that happened with ahab and he whipped about i believe there's a bunch of syrians he whipped amen and they was way high on the mountain whipped all these syrians after the bible was over they was all putting their stuff up and they thought man this is all done we're going to pack up everything's good amen and here comes along the prophet and he begins to prophesy and he says to ahab he said look now don't put up all your weapons he's coming another battle don't put up your weapons they come in another battle he said what do you mean is coming another battle well the lord heard your enemy as it went off of the mountain and while it was going off of the mountain it said that israel was only strong on the mountain and their god is only the god of the mountain but if we could get them in the valley that we could whip them down there and the prophet said to him because they have said this because they have spoken this amen i will be the god in the valley the same as i am the god on the mountain god's gonna do it again let me prophesy to you god's gonna do it again the same god that with that devil when you were a mile high he's the same god and with that devil when you're in the bottom of the lowest valleys of your life i heard him i heard that old devil he said well i'll tell you what evening light something else when they're up on the mountain but you let letting kobed come along you let a few trials come along you let them miss a few services and have a few hard times we'll get them in the valley they won't be so strong then we'll get them then we'll just destroy them at that moment amen and because the devil has said that and because the devil has thought that amen i can hear the word of the lord coming back to the church of the living god and i am not just the god of even light when she's on the mountain but i'm the god of eating in life even when it's in the valley listen to me believers you have maybe in a hard time in your life maybe you don't go to church here maybe you're visiting here but the devil has decided in this age that he could destroy the church but god has chosen this age to put the devil in his place put the devil in his place do you know where that is actually you know the place the devil belongs according to ephesians the first chapter and the second chapter that satan has been put under the feet of jesus christ and if satan is not under your feet he's out of place so i think it's time for the church to put satan back in his place tonight put him back where he belongs stomp on the head of that devil and say i'm a serpent stopper i'm a servant loser i'm a holy ghost field child i'm the living god i may be in the valley but i can still whip to them i may be in the valley but i can still look for them who are you you're the church of the living god [Applause] let our musicians come tonight i think we ought to give that devil a weapon i think our singers already seen him out of here i think our worshipers are to pull out their pull out for instance and begin to clap our hands and begin to open the lips and begin to worship and praise until the devil can't even stand the sound satan if you're going to attack the church you're going to have to hear our testimonies you're gonna have to hear our praise you're gonna have to hear our rejoicing you're gonna have to hear our praise you can't whip this bride she's already conquered she's already over the devil tonight [Applause] glory to god i know we ought to be sounding retreat but i don't know the sound i know we ought to be saying back up and sit down but i don't know the sound only thing that i was taught i was trained by a prophet and the only thing he taught me to say was charge take this land you're more than able to do it no giant no weapon no water no territory no circumstances no devils can take the church of the living god challenge the devil don't know what to do with you he's through everything he's got at you [Applause] he don't have anything else [Music] i'm still here i want him to see it i'm still here whether i'm in the valley or whether i'm on the mountain i am the nightmare that the devil wakes up and thinks about even the weakest christian when it begins to play hell begins to tremble [Applause] glory to god lord of god i know you got one brother [Music] you can log [Music] take away my vision from these eyes [Music] me [Music] [Music] me that i can see [Music] tell me what kind of a man [Music]
