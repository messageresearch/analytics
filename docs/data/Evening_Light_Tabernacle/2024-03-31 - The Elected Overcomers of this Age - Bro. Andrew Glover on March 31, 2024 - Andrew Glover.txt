almighty God and amen this morning we do want to just bring a greeting from our pastor brother sea Martin the Saints there at Faith Tabernacle amen send their greetings this morning and amen if we could this morning let's just look here in the scripture for the at the Book of John the 16th chapter and the 33rd verse amen the Bible said these things I have spoken unto you that in me you might have peace in the world ye shall have tribulation but be of good cheer now we read acts 27 yesterday speaking of where Paul said I believe God be of good cheer for it shall be exactly as I've told thee acts 27 is connected to John 16:33 in the world you shall have tribulation but be of good cheer now why are you going to be of good cheer for I have overcome the world so he's not overcoming the world but he's already overcome so you're walking in what he has already done he has already overcome the world now you are walking in his overcoming power be of good cheer for I have overcome the world now in the Book of Revelation the thir chapter The Book of Revelation the third chapter we want to look here in the third verse in the in the 20 Revelation 3 sorry Revelation 3 and verse 21 amen I know you know these scriptures by heart it's the age that we're living in we're in this age but we're not a part of the conditions of this age we've been called out by the Holy Ghost Revelation 3 and 21 now to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am sat down with my father brother B says notice the arrangements of this in his throne now he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches we ask the Lord this morning to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here today amen I want to for just a few moments this morning to speak to here and if I title this today I want to speak to you on the elected Overcomers of this age the elected over Overcomers of this age I want to say this morning I believe that we are elected to go home and overcome amen I do not believe this revival is ending this morning but I believe there is a generation sitting before me this morning that will carry this revival home and the fire of God will burn amen greater and stronger than it ever has before now I want to read this quote to you from 1956 in the message faith brother B says and I'm here standing just yielding myself and the Holy Spirit are moving and this is what you call Heavenly places in Christ Jesus but remember amen that Satan's always skeptic at the sons of God Amen remember that Satan is always skeptic at the sons of God you know he always does that someone with a skeptic idea and when they do that he's just trying to interfere but brother BR says but Christians always overcome amen I love that this morning amen that Christians always overcome how many sons of God have I got here this morning how many children of God Amen how many Christians have we got here this morning amen then Christians always overcome now that word always is a very small word but it packs a powerful definition it means at all times it means on All Occasions it means for all future time amen forever repeatedly and annoyingly amen so when something is always being done it's not just being done on one occasion or at one time amen but it's actually being done over and over and over Amen to the point that actually becomes annoying now amen I just want to say this I believe that you are leaving here this morning amen with the grace of God upon your life amen and the power in you to overcome the world is going to become annoying to the devil because you're not just going to overcome Amen on Friday night or Saturday night or Saturday morning or Thursday night but this overcoming amen is going to become a way of living living for every believer amen you're going to overcome on Monday you're going to overcome on Tuesday you're going to overcome on Wednesday you're going to overcome Amen in school you're going to overcome around your friends amen because you have been elected to be an overcomer now amen Christ spoke of an elected people for the last day and the prophet said we see the hours that were in this stage and we see what it was amen and the Holy Ghost is rebuking the AIDS that put him out but in all of that did you notice to him that over cometh see amen even in that worldly Wicked Church age amen him that overcometh we find here that God has always had Overcomers amen he had Overcomers in every age the always over time every age there's been on the earth God has always had somebody he could put his hand on as a witness amen though sometimes just one amen but somebody overcome amen I love what the prophet of God says I pray father that you'll let every one of us be Overcomers tonight amen Overcomers of unbelief Overcomers of anything within ourselves that we might overcome ourselves amen that Christ might live in US amen we've got to overcome ourselves amen that Christ might live in US amen now you know that we're living in the time amen when the entire nation that we're living in is focused Amen on a presidential election right they're trying Amen to elect some man to put him into office amen they can change their future he can change the direction of their of the economy he can change everything about amen they they they don't want to put somebody in there amen that's going to continue things the way they've been amen they're wanting to elect somebody to bring a change you know what the proud of God said we've not come here tonight amen to elect a man amen but we have come here to elect a man and that is the man the Lord Jesus he said I'm trying to build a platform for him tonight that in the coming nights of this campaign that we might rejoice and praise His name because we have elected him Amen in our hearts to be our savior to be our God and to be our healer amen let me say this I believe that there is a bride here this morning amen that has elected Jesus Christ amen not just to be their savior not just to be their healer amen but they have elected him to be the Lord of their future amen they've elected him to be the god of their salvation listen amen if you ever get the Holy Ghost just around you amen and just on you to in you amen there ain't a devil big enough there ain't amen can I preach this morning there ain't a giant tall enough amen that can defeat you because the one that's in you amen has already overcome the world listen we may be in the world but we are not of the world Amen but be of good cheer for I have overcome the world Amen and the one that's in you has overcome everything in your future and if he overcome then so shall you come on Caleb amen we're we're following Joshua right amen and we're going to take our mountains we're going to take our lands we're going to take our healings we're going to take our victories we're going to we're going to overcome we're going to tear down amen I believe it I believe the Bible said that Caleb amen was a type showed us from from the Bible that Caleb was a type of the end time people amen that follow Joshua the leader in numbers 13:30 the Bible says that Caleb stealed the people before Moses and he said let us go up at once and possess it now watch what he says amen for we might be able to overcome it there is a possibility that we can overcome it amen amen amen there is a way that we might scheme up that we might be able to overcome amen not my Bible says amen that we are well aable we are well able to overcome it now look at this word overcome it means to endure it means to have power it means to be able to gain to accomplish to be able to endure it means to be able to reach to Prevail over or against something it means to overcome it means to be the Victor to have ability to have strength now think about this amen Caleb was an overcomer but can I say this Caleb did not start overcoming amen the day that he took his Mountain Caleb did not start overcoming amen the day that he be to walk in the inheritance amen that Moses said he could have amen but from the time that Moses said amen there is a mountain for you to have until he put his foot up on that mountain amen Caleb overcome listen friends and the way he overcome was he endured amen every day with the promises of God listen I say I am looking at a young generation amen that's not going to start overcoming on the morning of the Rapture or when they get into heaven amen but I believe you've been enduring you've been pers fearing you have been believing the promises of God in the face of every devil you've been reaching beyond what Satan has said about you you've been reaching beyond what people have thought about you listen you've been enduring and if you can just hold on Amen you're going to take your mountain and devils in hell to defeat you and do it listen Joshua and Caleb took the land amen because they believe the word no matter what and then no matter what they believe the word if they felt good they believe the word if they didn't feel good they believe the word why because they were elected to overcome and to possess the promises that God had given them in 1 John chap 2: 13 the Bible says I write unto you fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning amen I write unto you young men amen because ye have overcome the wicked one I want you to notice how John is writing this amen I write unto you little children amen because you have known the father now now can I can I break something down to you amen John is writing this as if it's already happened amen he's writing this amen as if you've already overcome he's writing this as if you've already met the father amen and and now now think about this amen how could John write that Amen in past tense amen and when John wrote that young men you wasn't even born come on Church am me you weren't even born when John rofan he goes on the 14th verse and says I have written unto you fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning I have written unto you young men how many young men have I got here this morning amen he wrote unto you young men amen because you are weak and you cannot hold on and you cannot persevere no that's what they ought to see a Bible says but my Bible says because ye are strong amen and the word of God abideth in you and ye have overcome the wicked one are y'all catching what is saying he's saying that there is a generation amen that's going to be strong look at this word strong it is of one who has the strength of the Soul Amen to sustain the attacks of the devil amen I want to put hell on notice this morning amen you can throw everything you've got against us amen but we are the elected Overcomers amen by the word of almighty God we have not come from a church we have not come from a denomination amen but we have stepped from the genes of almighty God into this generation listen I did oh God Amen I'm only catching up in time with what God seen me doing in eternity amen and God sent John to write unto me and say I'm going to overcome leosia I'm going to overcome lukewarmness I'm going to overcome depression I'm going to overcome anxiety I'm going to overcome complexes amen and here's how I'm going to do it because the word of God Amen is abiding in my soul I I am not a Christian by my flesh I am not a Christian by my spirit come on church amen you got to be a Christian from your soul where the first attack of the devil is going to knock you out come on church amen we got a bunch of Flesh Christians in the world we got a bunch of spirit Christians amen but I'm talking about some soul Christians y y'all realize the prophet of God said he said there's three kinds of Believers he said there's a make believer an unbeliever and a genuine believer he said there's three kinds of believers in every church now think about that one amen there's three kinds of Believers in every church can I say this to you there's three kinds of Believers in every believer come on now amen do you realize your flesh is an unbeliever your flesh is what didn't want to get out of bed this morning your flesh is what's trying to put you to sleep right now your flesh is what don't want you to raise your hand and say amen amen your flesh is what didn't want Michael to sing amen your flesh is what saying the sound system too loud your flesh right now is what's saying oh hurry up we've been here all weekend are you hearing me your flesh is an unbeliever your flesh will work against you your flesh will war against you amen listen your flesh is a come on it's a product amen of a hybridized affair amen your flesh is an unbeliever so you cannot serve God based on your flesh amen can I go a step further amen you got a spirit amen and if everything's good and there's no trouble there's no situation amen you'll serve God as a Spirit Christian but the very minute that something bad happens amen your spirit can drop from the highs of highs into the lows of lows amen your spirit is a make believer amen your spirit will make you believe everything's going good and then when something goes bad God's against you amen but can I say this we are not flesh Christians we are not Spirit Christians but we are soul Christians amen We Believe from our soul we worship from our soul we preach from our soul we sing from our soul we confess the word of God Amen from our soul when our flesh don't want to praise our soul Praises anyhow when our spirit says I'm too low amen our soul Praises anyhow and I want to say this this morning it's your flesh amen that says you're not going to make a Rapture it's your flesh it says God can't change your body but you know what I say there is a soul on the inside of you as a Believer and there is an anointed word that is laying across that soul and that word is bringing your flesh into subjection to the promise of God and some of these mornings between 6:00 and 9 there's going to come A Change across your body and your flesh won't stop it and your spirit won't stop it because there is a soul that the word of God has been laid into and it is strong enough to sustain the attacks of the devil I love what John goes on to say in 1 John 5:4 he says whatsoever is born of God Amen how many here is born of God are you ready for this overcometh the world now that's not a possibility young people that is a promise whatever is born of God overcomes the world that is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith amen I'm going to preach in a minute I'm just laying some Foundation right now look at this word world it is the ungodly multitude it is the whole mass of men amen alienated from God and therefore hostile to the cause of Christ so the entire the entire massive humanity is alienated from God but they're not just alienated but they're actually hostile amen towards the cause of Christ but now watch this brother the whole circle of Earthly Goods amen endowments riches advantages Pleasures which allthough hallow and frail and fleeting now think about this the world is full of riches advantages Pleasures but they're hallow they're frail and they're fleeting amen they stir desire now watch what they do and they seduce from God Amen and are obstacles to the cause of Christ so there are things in the world that the devil will put before you amen that'll be Hollow they'll be frail but listen they'll still be strong enough Amen to seduce some amen and pull them from the cause of Christ amen but I want to say I am not talking to that category of people this morning I am talking to the sons of God who have been born by the word of God and here's what the Bible said who is he that overcometh the world Amen but he that believeth Jesus is the son of God and I want to climb up on the highest of highest this morning and say Lord Jesus Is God there is no God above him there is no God beside him there is no God with him amen he is God and he is God alone we might as well preach this morning we're here amen I believe I'm talking to some Overcomers amen now watch this quote the prod God said now Faith is a conqueror amen faith is an overcomer it isn't just a peacemaker it overcomes amen faith is the victory that overcomes the world Amen what does it do what is Faith what is the conquer amen conquer and victory is the same are you ready for a prophetic definition Amen to conquer it means that to beat down are you with me to override to hand cuff and throw into prison now you are a generation who's going to beat down the advantages of Leota you're going to handcuff the desires of leosa come on Church you're going to override amen the things of worldism and Fashions and ideas of ungodly things you are this generation and you know what you're going to do you're going to throw it into prison now can I say this amen before you got to Jesus Christ amen you was in that that condition those things had beat you down those things had overrode us those things had throwed Us in prison those things had handcuffed us he said what does conquer mean it means the sin that once ruled you amen you rule it now well glory to God Amen some of you all come here to this camp and things were ruling your life amen things were ruling your joy they were ruling your Victory amen but this morning I can say by the word of God Amen that is strong in the soul of the believer amen I believe church of living God we have beat down that devil we have overrode that devil we have handcuffed that devil we have pH that devil in prison are you ready for this he said oh my it means you have overcome it amen you have whipped it and you are greater than it is amen I want to say this morning you're greater than depression you are greater than suicidal Spirits you are greater than demons and tormenting things you are greater this morning you say preacher how can you say I'm greater because the word of God abideth in your soul and here's what the word of God says greater even Kat is he that is in you than he that is in the world listen I don't care what devil overrode you I don't care what Spirit beat you down amen if Jesus Christ the son of God has arisen from the grave and it's taken preeminence in your soul there ain't no devil big enough There Ain't No Mountain High Enough there ain't no Spirit B enough Amen to defeat God in overcoming through his bride people worry about well how amen amen now now now now think about this I think brother Ron or brother Danny W mention it amen that people worry about what are we to overcome they get so focused on what are we to overcome now right here this morning as you're preparing Amen to go home you're already thinking about what you got to overcome well I've got to overcome this and I got to go overcome this worldly relationship and well thank you Lord it's in the building I might as well preach amen amen amen since when did we start allowing Believers and unbelievers to come on church I might as well preach I'm here am amen a prophet of God said a Believer marries an unbeliever under no conditions amen and some of you may have to go home and end some relationships but if you want to keep this revival amen burning in your soul you're going to have to separate from everything that's hallow everything that's frail everything that will seduce you amen away from the cause of Christ you're going to have to separate because God's word calls amen for a total separation from unbelief both things can stay the same when the Overcomer comes in you may have to overcome some friendships you may have to go home and tell some coaches I ain't wearing shorts on the basketball court no more well glory to God we might as well preach you might have to go home and tell some coaches I ain't wearing pants on the basketball court it's okay to preach a little bit are you hearing me you're an overcomer the the word of God is abiding in you and listen now comes the fight the fight ain't when you're at Camp amen the fight is when you leave and every devil raises its head and tries to tell you you didn't get nothing it was just an emotion it was just a sensation amen that's where the battle begins that's where you've got to override that devil you got to beat that devil down you got to handcuff that devil and throw that devil in prison and say I know what I got in the presence of the Lord it was More Than A Feeling it was more than an emotion it was more than a sensation but I got a deposit of the baptism of the Holy Ghost In My Soul the Overcomer is now living in me and I can overcome on every occasion I can overcome in every day I can overcome all my future listen I want to say this I'm looking at your future this morning and all I see is overcoming all I see in your future is overcoming I see overcoming on you and it looks real good defeat don't look good on you because you're not a defeated Christian you are a son and a daughter of God you are an overcomer now you have to separate from some things but the problem of God said now it's not the actual thought of how much what we are to overcome but how we are to overcome see if I if I took here this morning now look if I if I put up a list here of things and said now here's what you got to overcome he mean you got to overcome this and overcome this and overcome this well you know and then I start telling you how to overcome those things amen now listen there may be things not up there that you have to overcome that others don't right but can I say this if I can tell you how to overcome then it don't matter what you got to overcome as long as you know [Applause] how as long as you know how to overcome it don't matter what it don't matter when it don't matter where as long as you know how to overcome the word of God is the way we overcome re say we must never let the spirit of Revival die see what does overcome mean overcome means to keep life in you amen it means to keep life in you said watch the thing you have to overcome is yourself your idea your thing and surrender yourself to him he overcome for you he knows the way we don't now look friends I believe they're taping this and if it's on tape whatever you do who is listening now or who will listen Hereafter the the hour is very late and you have good intention but be caught inside don't struggle now don't struggle it's not him that willth or him that runthe and walk on with a perfect satisfied faith that what God has promised you is able to perform not joining one denomination another denomination running this that or the other amen trying this just yield yourself to God and walk with him amen peaceful quiet not interrupted amen just keep on walking with him listen friends I'm talking about you amen you if you're going to overcome you're going to have to walk with God you're going to have to walk with God on your good days you're going to have to walk with God on your bad days you're going to have to walk with God when you feel like walking come on Enoch amen some days you're not going to feel like walking but you got to walk amen you got to keep on walking because there's a word spoken over your life you've got to take a Rapture you've got to overcome you are the elected ones to do it listen we're not talking about it brother said watch he said we're not talking so much about on my Throne amen is in my Throne he said Christ is the ruler the throne ruler at this time of the complete domain of God so will the church be with him the bride be with him and his throne in his entire domain see a throne is over a domain and a domain reaches just as far as its boundaries does and this is from eternity to Eternity can I say this as a Believer we have a dominion and according to Romans 6 for sin shall not have aen dominion over you for ye are not under law but under grace can I say this our Dominion is the dominion over sin amen and it is enforced through the power that is in the spirit of Christ that indwells us amen every Kingdom on Earth is going to be torn down amen but ours will remain Hallelujah every Kingdom on the Earth is going to be tored down amen but ours will remain now can I say this to you this morning amen the scripture speaks of us amen as Kings and Priests amen but listen it speaks of us as kings in the future tent amen so in the future according to Revelations 1 amen we're going to be Kings and Priests under God but in Revelation 1 15 the Bible says from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness the first begotten of the Dead the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and wased us from our sins and his own blood and hath made us amen Kings and Priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen but said now watch this he hath made us can we say that together he hath made us he said there's certain truths that we need to emphasize on and this is one of them that he hath made us listen you did not make yourself an overcomer amen he made you an overcomer you did not make yourself saved he saved you because salvation is of the lord it's of his doing listen we are going to be Kings upon the Earth with him when he sits on his throne so now what do we do do we just look at the future and say someday some hour amen sometime Amen Brother Jay we're going to be a king amen someday the power is going to come and we're going to be a king I say what a prophet said he said we're going to be kings in the future he said but right now amen We Are Spiritual Kings and we Reign Over a spiritual Kingdom amen right now we reign with Christ and we have Dom dominion over sin over the world over the Flesh and the devil and we are showing forth his praise and His glory we are showing forth himself for it is Christ in US amen willing and doing of his good pleasure yes indeed even now we are seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus can I say this the Overcomer is the heir of all things amen you are the heir of everything that God has ordained you to be heir of now I want to say this to you this is the age of the Overcomer this age you're living in is the age of the Overcomer Canan does not represent the age of the Overcomer or Millennium rather it only represents the age of the Overcomer this is the dispensation of overcoming because in Canaan amen they killed and they burned and they took cities now listen people say well Canaan represents the Millennium brother said no he said that was there were still Wars there were still killings they burned to cities there will be no death in the Millennium so can I can I can I give you a charge this morning we are not waiting for the Millennium to start fighting Hall we are not waiting for the Rapture to start fighting amen now is the time to fight this is the age of the Overcomer this is the time Amen to burn cities this is the time Amen to tear down the devil's Kingdom this is the time Amen to crucify the flesh this is the time to praise God well I want to just go ahead and say it this morning amen after all we've seen God do this weekend amen if there's ever been a time to praise God Amen right now is the time to praise God you say well when we get over in the Millennium we're going to praise God no I'm just warming up here amen I'm just warming up here amen I'm not waiting to get in the Millennium and start praising God can I say something to you sometimes you're going to have to learn how to fight with your praise sometimes you're G to have to learn how to fight that Devil with your praise when you don't feel like praising when you don't feel like worshiping when you don't feel like getting in the service when you don't feel like backing the word of God come on young people am amen you want to talk about taking some cities amen go back in your home churches and when your pastor standing there and he's laboring in the word and he's tying things together and he's trying to feed your soul amen don't sit there like a bup on a pickle amen waiting for him to make a good point amen get behind the man of God and tear down that City tear down that stronghold fight against that Spirit that's trying to hinder the Holy Ghost amen from coming in your church this is not just a camp meet religion this is a home Church religion and you know what I want to say get mad at me if you want to okay but if we can shout our shoe Hills off at youth camp we ought to be able to shout in our home churches if we can dance at youth camp we ought to be able to dance at home we ought to go home and burn down every no praising God devil and let the power of the Holy Ghost amen burn in the church once again by the generation of elected Overcomers I believe it I believe if you're going to win you're going to have to learn how to praise come on church if you're going to whip the devil sometime or another you got to let your praise be your weapon there's going to be times you don't know what to do so all you can do is just throw up your hands and start praising God y'all know what I'm talking about me remember brother talked about it he talked about custards I think it was custard Last Stand he said there was a he said there was a there were they were coming against the native right Native American Indian remember said the government told him he said whatever you do don't go among them right now I think it was the Sue they said don't go among the Sue right now he said because it's a sacred time for them they're in a feast it's a time of worship but you know what the proud of God said he said custard got drunk brother Nathaniel and he went right on among the Sue and you know what we know today is custard as custards Last Stand are you hearing me amen he picked the wrong time to go among the sue you know why because they were in worship they were in a dedication they were in a feast and the devil come among them and brother said he whipped them amen and it was Custer Last Stand can I say this to you amen the devil has pick the wrong time to come amongst the Bride of Jesus Christ he has picked the wrong time to come among our meetings he has picked the wrong time to come into our churches because we're not here as a bunch of church members playing Church Hallelujah amen our Revival does not end when the Music Stops our Revival does not end when the music quits playing amen our Revival is a word Revival and it burns on the mountain and it burns in the valley it burns in the good times it burns in the bad times we are not in just a church service we are in a spiritual Feast where the King of Kings we are feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man and it is releasing a strength on the inside of us to overcome every devil to overcome every idea to overcome every tradition you know what I say I say release your worship release your weapon release your praise release the anointing of the Holy Ghost upon the lives of the children of God and let him just show forth his Praises he made you to praise him now think about this the part of God said like this the time we have to fight to win the battle and to overcome the things of the world now is the time you know we're living in a very special time amen I'm I'm getting ready to go to war so stay with me we're living in a very special time it's called adoption time the Bible speaks of it Romans 8:14 for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God verse 15 for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby ye cry Abby father ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry AB by father now if you're crying father you know what that means that means you have claims on him as a child and him is your father if you are saying father come on church if you're saying father that means you have been moved amen from the fear and scare that you don't know who you are well I might as well just read you what a prophet of God said he said I'm only saying this amen not to mix up Doctrine but to straighten it out that we might get away from this fear and scare that you don't know who you are you are not going to be sons of God but see you but now you are the sons of God listen this is not in the future this is not way out there somewhere someday some hour no but right now you are the sons of God see can I say what a prophet said brother Titus he said you always were a Son of God if you ever was a Son of God you always were a Son of God well I might as well draw my sword and preach here you say preacher why are you bogging down on this point amen because somewhere sometime you've got to come to a victory on the Battle of whether I'm a Child of God or not testing one two it's still working somewhere sometime you've got to settle it either you're a Son of God or you're not a son of God listen you say preacher why are you why are you bogging down here because you got bigger battles to fight than just waking up every day wondering if I'm a Child of God or not you got bigger cities to burn down you got bigger Giants to take land from somewhere sometime you got to settle whether you're a child of God or not well glory to God he said brother if I wake up feeling good I'm a Child of God but if I wake up feeling bad I don't know you realize the devil will have you running in circles well one day I'm saved the next day I'm lost one day I'm going to make it the next come amen do you realize that can become Youth Camp Cycles you go from one Youth Camp to another Youth Camp amen am I a Son of God am I child of God I don't know I made a mistake I failed God Amen can I preach to you this morning amen amen if your failures are bigger than your God you need to get a new God come on if your failures are bigger if our mistakes are bigger than our God we need to find a god bigger but you know what I say there ain't a big M there ain't enough big mistakes there ain't enough strong things my God is greater than every failure he's greater than every mistake my God is Jehovah little help and be good amen my God is Jehovah you know what my God is he is my father listen somewhere or another you got to settle it I am a child of God can I say this to you how many how many children of God we got here do you realize as a child of God you're in Christ Jesus can can I can I drop something to you that'll help you I pray as a Son of God you don't go in Christ and out of Christ so brother Nathaniel you don't go in one day and come out the next and then go back in at Louisiana and come back out when you get home and then go back in at Ohio and then come back out a Son of God come on you don't go in your father and out of your father you come out of your father and you are a manifestation of the seed of your father come on church and no matter what Devil Comes against it you cannot change the fact amen that you was in your father you was a part of your father can I say this as a Son of God you don't go in Christ and you don't come out of Christ you go in Christ and you stay in Christ now come on but I will say this but you do go up and down some days you go up on the mountain and some days you go in the valley listen you've never questioned whether you was a child of God or not when you was on the mountain there's never been one day when you were shouting and the anointing was all over you that you said oh I wonder if I'm a son or daughter of God no but the minute you went in the valley the minute you went in the valley was the very minute you begin to say well I don't know if I'm a Son of God I don't know if I'm a child well glory to God the minute you made a mistake was the very minute you said listen when you was walking from one Victory to another you never said am I son or daughter of God but the minute you made a mistake was the very minute the devil begin to say you're not a child of God but if you are under an adoption word the prophet of God said you are his already by predestination the seed was there you was belonging to him before the foundation of the world listen I think it's high time Amen to draw our sword and with that devil on my good day I'm a child of God and on my bad days I'm a Child of God when I am on the mountain I'm a child of God and when I'm in the Valley I'm a Child of God if I'm in church I'm a Child of God if I'm in the hospital I'm a Child of God if I'm at Youth Camp I'm a Child of God if I'm at school I'm a Child of God if I'm with my friends I'm a Child of God wherever I go and wherever I be I am a predestinated seed word born child of the Almighty God and there ain't no devil in hell there ain't no Spirit there ain't no world there ain't no Leia can change who I am are you hearing me can't change amen amen I'm have to borrow something here brother brother Jude would you come here real quick amen I'm have to borrow something amen amen I heard brother it be a blessing to you I pray I'm trying to get this point over I got to move the last point and then I'm going to close cuz brother Danny he left his watch up here for me is that yours brother Danny oh you didn't I'm closing see this young man right here what's your name Jude what's your last name who's your daddy okay this is Jude his daddy's Aaron okay we got that okay will you do me a will you do me a favor just fall down right there lay lay down now I'll get back up what's your name who's your daddy what's your name who's your daddy so that didn't change you he belonged to his daddy before he fell and when he got back up he still was a son of Aaron OG speak come on church thank you buddy are you hearing me amen we might have fallen but before we went down we was a Son of God and our fall did not change our identity I want to put hell on notice we are a new generation of Overcomers we're not marching out of dry quiek Louisiana as a bunch of hopeless helpless confused individuals we know who we are we know where we come from we know who our daddy is and no matter what tomorrow holds or the next month holds or the next week holds we will still be a Son of God on the morning of the rapture we will still be a son of God because we have come from the genes of God and the fall didn't change it the persecution don't change it the negativity don't change it say what you want to devil it is settled in heaven and now it is settled in my heart I come from God I belong to God and I'm going back to God and there ain't no devil can change who I am there ain't no fa can Glory are y'all hearing me amen I'm saying something to you the Bible said make your election sure make your election sure for if you do these things you might fall for if you do these things come on Church you might slip up and something take you out if you do these things you shall never fall glory to God if you make your calling and your election sure you shall never fall can I say this you are not elected based on your family you are not elected amen based on your home You're Not Elected based on your church listen can I say this You're Not Elected based on your own character or your own mistakes you are elected by the for knowledge of God wherein he decided to elect to choose to pick out now watch what he done he elected you before the foundation of the world and he desired that you would receive certain blessings in other words before you got here God decreed you would receive the blessings you're receiving from before the foundation of the world listen in other words it's got your name on it come on church it's got your name on it and there ain't no devil and there ain't no Spirit there ain't no unbelief are you hearing me I tell you why that's so real to me amen I borrowed that example from brother brother Wayne Lawson but when I use that Jude I tell you why I use that because it made such an impact on me this is why amen because no matter how low you go you're still a Son of God don't you ever forget that young people there was something deposited in you before the fall before you went down and that's why you can rise back up on your two feet and say the Lord give us and the lord taketh away but blessed be the name of are you hearing me you are elected to be an overcomer can I say this you've got a position I I'm not going to read it to you I'm going to preach it to you you got a position in this adoption your election amen goes with your predestination which goes with your adoption which brings you into your position and the last thing the devil don't want you to do is recognize who you are and recognize the position you hold and recognize the entitlements that God has bestowed upon your life as a son or daughter of God you know what the devil wants to do he wants to keep you living in limbo he wants to keep scaring you he wants to keep he wants to keep bluffing you but sometime or another you got to get the Seal of the Holy Ghost be on your flesh be on your spirit on your soul and when the Devil comes on Monday when the Devil comes on Tuesday because he's always a skeptic of the sons of God but when that Devil Comes you will always overcome can I say this to you I think it's time to get some confidence of God Amen back in our worship I think it's time to get rid of condemnation and get rid of guilt and get rid of things and baggage you've been carryed I think it's high time young people Amen to step from instability into the stability of the message amen make sure you're anchored to something amen that goes beyond the feelings of the church goes beyond the emotions of the crowd make sure you're anchored to the anchor and make sure the anchor is anchored can I say this to you make sure you're harnessed to an absolute message come on come on I'm going to preach to you now cuz there's going to be times that me and brother Ron and brother Danny ain't going to be around you but you're still an overcomer because you don't need me you don't need any other preacher to Hold Your Hand you have got the message of the hour delivered to you it is a constant message listen can I say this the message never changes it's there on your good days it's there on your bad days when you need a little shot in the arm you don't need some preacher to say something over you or speak a word over you or see a vision over you you need the message of the hour to rise up in power and absolute Authority and whip that devil down beef that devil down handcuff that devil and say devil God give me this position now do you realize if you don't know who you are you can't enjoy something do you know if you're not sure you can stay there you can't enjoy something but if you ever get a revelation I have a right to be here amen I'm going to share something with you a few years ago we we went to a to a to a gospel music concert and we got there a little bit late brother Michael and and we didn't have tickets you know so we got there they were all sold out well I knew somebody at the door and I just asked him I said hey I said is there any way you could get us in they said well sure I said how they said well we got passes I said okay you got passes he said yeah he said now listen here's the pass he said it's not a ticket he said there's a difference between a pass and a ticket I didn't know this he said this pass would allow you to get through the door it allow you to get in there but when you get in there any seat you see open you can take it I said man we don't even have to pay we don't have to pay nothing he said no it's a pass I said man we didn't have to buy no tickets we got here late it's packed out and we still going to get a seat brother we still going to get a seat so you know what we did we went in and picked out some seats but he said this to us he said any seat you see and you sit down in he said now listen somebody has a ticket to that seat now you can sit there with a pass but if somebody walks up there with a ticket and they identify the number on the back of the chair with the number on the ticket you got to go so there was a pass and then there was a ticket so we went in there brother Miguel and we sat down and man we were so nervous because we didn't know at any time who was going to show up there was a fear around us there was a scare I mean we went to church and we didn't know if we could raise our hands we didn't know if we could believe the word we didn't know if we could say Amen we didn't know if there actually was a truth about our life we we were we were sitting there in fear we were constantly looking around amen we weren't hearing what the singers were saying we weren't enjoying the music because at any minute somebody could show up and say I got a ticket to this seat get out it's my seat you know what we did the next year the next year we went back but we made sure we had a token and I mean a ticket we made sure we had a ticket and you know what I did I didn't need a pass I just walked right in the door I took my ticket I found my seats I sat down there in that seat and I enjoy the singing you know why because now I have an assurance I belong here it belongs to me it's my position it's my seat and there ain't nobody can move me well I want to say this to you let every critical devil criticize let every unbelieving devil will H but you are not here as a trespassing bride you are here as The Virtuous sinless spotless bride of almighty God he give you the token come on Church sit down in your position sit down in Authority sit down in Praise sit down in anointing sit down in power sit down in Revelation sit down in joy unspeakable and full of Glory come on amen amen start enjoying church again amen let's enjoy church again let's get away from all the fear and there come on church amen well I would praise God but I would praise my father but the devil told me and the devil said and the devil told me amen can I say this he is a liar the devil is a liar you were not born of the spirit of error you were born of the spirit of truth and you have been given a right by the baptism of the Holy Ghost to sit down in your position as a Son of God as a believer of this time word can I say this to you sit down in your position don't sit there and say well you know so and so said and oh oh god well brother when I get back home I'll praise God as long as I'm good enough can I ask you something amen since when did we start basing Our Praise on when we got good enough come on come on Church well I praise God if I got good enough can I say this to you amen you're not praising God Because of Who You Are you're not praising God because of how good you are how good you've been how good you believed you're praising God simply on this one fact of who he is come on Church you're not praising him because of who you are you're praising him because of who he is he is an overcomer and he has come down on the inside of you you are a habitation of the spirit of God where Jesus Christ is walking in you he's talking in you he is overcoming through you what are you saying brander I'm saying that we're going to have some rough days when we leave here we're going to have some rough days but we are anchored to the pillar of fire we are anchored to the message of the hour can I say this to you make sure that what you're anchored to amen is anchored to something make sure what you're tied off to is tied off to something make sure that when oh God make sure when wind begins to blow and Mondays begin to come and bad days begin to come make sure you don't start backing up and saying well devil you were right bless your name bless his name I don't bless that old devil's name amen I take the word of God and I say you are a defeated being you are a liar get behind me Satan I know what I got at Camp come on Church the devil ain't I said this before I'm going to say it again amen amen if I'm going to rob somebody and brother Joe I just got $5 and you got $2 I ain't going to come rob you I ain't going to come pick on you I'm going to go pick on somebody that's got something more than I've got I'm going to go find somebody that's got $10 or $20 and listen let me say this to you the very evidence the reason that Devil's picking on you and trying to rob from you is because you've got more than he's got listen he was in heaven and he got cast out he was oh God he was created there and he was cast out out but you were born in sin you were shaping iniquity you come in the world speaking lies but God by the blood of Jesus Christ redeemed your soul back to God and performed the ministry of reconciliation and now you're going back to where the devil can't get back to well I feel like shouting on that point devil get out of my way I may have bad days I may have up days I may have down days but I'm going where you can't go I'm going back to the paradise of God I'm going to the Tree of Life I'm going to sit by the Crystal River I'm going to feed at the marriage supper of the Lamb amen young people change your confession and whip that Devil with a word of whip that Devil with a word of authority and power in your life what are you saying I'm saying this amen I don't know if you can give it to me or not the picture there of the pillar of fire if you can't it's okay brother said this he said we today are God's spiritual church where the spiritual law amen written on the tables of our heart the one in Sam Houston Coliseum 1950 if you got it thank you are you hearing me right there we today are God's spiritual church with a spiritual law written on the tables of our hearts can I say what else he said and we are LED in a spiritual form we are led by something that does not change now that right there is a very powerful picture and the devil hates that picture if he could destroy it he would have done done it proper not proper English forgive me if he could get rid of that he would have already got rid of it but you know why he can't get rid of that is because he can't get rid of you you came from the logos of God you came out of the pillar of oh God come on Church you came out of the pillar of fire somebody say well I don't like that picture well I pray God deliver you that devil I love that picture because that is my headship you say brother Andrew that's a man no the problem is your thinking ain't gone no higher as high as your thinking is gone is the fact there's a man in that picture but there is a God above that man come on church can I say this to you there is a God above that man can I say this to you and the man below that God is a microphone for the god that's above him are y'all hearing me this right here is a microphone are you hearing me this is a microphone you know where it's not brother Thomas it's not above my head it's not above my head it's underneath my mouth this microphone is communicating what I'm thinking it is speaking what I'm thinking Church of the Living God William Mary and brandom amen was the seventh angel he was not our God he is our Prophet but I'll say this he was the microphone of this generation and what he said ought to be held from every propit it ought to be said by every preacher it ought to be believed by every believer and you know what I do I rebuke that ungodly unbelieving devil that will try to squash amen the words of authority over this generation Satan are an offense to me what he said is what God was thinking I don't have time to read the close to you I'm going to say this he I'm going to say this brother said a prophet can't even speak his own thoughts so whatever he said was not what he was thinking and you know what he said he said you are the sinless Spotless bride of Jesus Christ he said you are an invincible Army can I tell you where that come from that didn't come from William brandom that didn't come from Jeffersonville that came from the pillar of fire young people amen leave and go home with these words in your heart I am an elected Overcomer who has been spoken over by the same PF fire that led Moses and led Paul has returned in this generation can I say this and anything that says anything different than what a prophet of God said you ought to throw it in the trash you ought to throw it back in the hell it come out of stand with the word of God stand with the message of the hour stand with the power of God that released you from the fear and scare I didn't know who I was but the pillar of fire did I didn't know where I come from but the pillar of fire did I didn't know where I was going but the pillar of fire did and God so loved me that he sent a microphone to pick up the faults of the pillar of fire and here's what the prophet of God said people who follow the pillar of fire will certainly have a rough time but they're ready for the translation at that time huj so just keep on walking keep on being led in a spiritual form you'll be ready for the translation at that time can I say this and some musicians are coming let me say this to you on the morning of the Rapture you're not going to wake up and say you know I just really don't know if I'm a Son of God or not I just really don't know he say preacher you're getting way out there am I brother B said when the bride knows who she is the rapture will go when she moves from Pentecostal confusion into word adoption she'll know who she is in the face of every confusion now come on young people come on you're living in an age where boys don't even know if they're boys no more come on amen amen amen you're going Beyond some battles amen you're going Beyond in my son of God or amen you're going Beyond
