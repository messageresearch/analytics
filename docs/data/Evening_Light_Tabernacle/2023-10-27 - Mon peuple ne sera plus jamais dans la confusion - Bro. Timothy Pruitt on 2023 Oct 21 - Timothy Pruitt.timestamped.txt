[31:17] sends many
[31:19] greetings we have some saints from the
[31:21] church of Geneva brother
[31:23] labor brother from
[31:28] gr Brother David ion is
[31:33] here he couldn't make
[31:36] it amen and from the north the south
[31:40] east and the
[31:41] West God bless you all if I didn't
[31:45] mention your name or your country
[31:47] forgive me but we welcome
[31:50] you amen and of course we want to
[31:53] welcome our precious brother Timothy
[31:56] puit
[31:58] he came with his whole
[32:00] family
[32:03] amen so there is a little change in
[32:08] plans brother Peter mentioned
[32:11] it for those who didn't receive the news
[32:16] yet our precious brother Billy
[32:19] Paul went to be with the
[32:22] Lord and if he would ask him
[32:26] now leave me
[32:29] there amen 88 years a precious brother
[32:35] amen we love them and certainly want to
[32:37] keep them in our
[32:39] prayers amen keep keeping them we keep
[32:42] them in our
[32:43] prayers we don't have any news about the
[32:45] funeral and so on maybe brother FR have
[32:49] but you know the the word of God tells
[32:52] us if one of the members is
[32:55] suffering the whole body body
[32:58] suffers amen and that's what we are
[33:00] seeing
[33:02] now when somebody is
[33:04] suffering going through
[33:06] hardship the whole body is
[33:09] suffering amen but we are a blessed
[33:12] people amen also there's a change in
[33:15] plan as I
[33:17] said for those who didn't hear it a
[33:20] precious brother Donny
[33:22] Reagan his daughter sister ER Parker
[33:27] went to be with the
[33:29] Lord she was young 42
[33:32] years leaving behind her two sets of
[33:38] twins 16 and 18
[33:41] years but God doesn't make
[33:44] mistakes and certainly we want to uphold
[33:48] them so our precious brother Tim
[33:52] puit was torn
[33:54] apart he was coming here
[33:58] but then his best friend brother Donny
[34:01] Reagan they're best friends for many
[34:03] many
[34:04] years and in moments like
[34:07] these you need your
[34:09] buddies so he will be doing or being
[34:12] part in the funeral service
[34:17] tomorrow so if we can keep them all in
[34:19] our
[34:20] prayers amen maybe you never met brother
[34:23] Tim never met Brother Don but we're the
[34:27] same
[34:28] family amen so
[34:30] certainly as I said God Don't Make
[34:33] Mistakes I know the load is heavy for
[34:36] our precious brother
[34:39] Timothy but God knows
[34:43] everything when we lose
[34:46] control he never loses
[34:48] control listen was as I was just
[34:53] thinking and seeking Lord may I have
[34:55] some some words words of of
[34:58] encouragement even when I sent out the
[35:01] invitation the Bible verse came to my my
[35:05] mind we all know it by
[35:07] heart Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[35:11] today and
[35:13] forever brother BR says in the evil age
[35:16] that we are living in
[35:18] now we are here to prove to
[35:22] Satan that we are not like the first
[35:25] Eve
[35:28] [Music]
[35:29] hallelujah amen and she will be tried
[35:32] the bride will be Tried by the
[35:35] word amen every bit of the
[35:39] word the first Eve got confused on one
[35:46] word that he's the same
[35:48] yesterday today and
[35:51] forever but not the second
[35:54] bride saints of God
[35:57] we see
[35:59] prophecy being manifested before our
[36:03] eyes amen Israel is in the
[36:07] Homeland the bride has made herself
[36:11] ready brother BR says the uniting time
[36:14] and sign
[36:17] finishing God is uniting his
[36:20] bride she's coming together from the
[36:23] East the west north and south
[36:27] there's a uniting time and it's on right
[36:32] now Hallelujah that's what these
[36:35] meetings are
[36:37] about what is she uniting
[36:40] for the
[36:43] Rapture amen maybe we lost a beloved
[36:46] brother a precious
[36:49] sister soon and very
[36:51] soon we'll be together amen even brother
[36:55] Brenham when he saw his
[36:57] daughter who are you young
[37:00] sister amen soon and soon very soon
[37:04] we'll spend eternity
[37:06] together that's why we are uniting
[37:09] together
[37:10] now what with the word of
[37:14] God Amen for all heavens and earth shall
[37:17] pass
[37:18] away but my word shall never
[37:21] pass and we are uniting
[37:24] with listen Saints

[37:42] once delivered to the
[37:45] Saints and thank God we have a message
[37:48] of
[37:49] restoration to bring the faith of the

[37:58] convention May these meetings be

[48:16] for you the rain the former rain the
[48:18] latter rain in the first
[48:24] month and the floor shall be full of
[48:26] Wheat and the fats shall overflow with
[48:30] wine and
[48:35] oil and I will restore to you the years
[48:37] that the Locust has eaten the canker
[48:39] worm theer the P worm my great Army
[48:43] which I
[48:50] sent and you shall plenty and be
[48:53] satisfied and praise the the name of the
[48:56] Lord your God that has dealt wondrously
[48:58] with you and my people shall never be
[49:09] ashamed and you shall know that I in the
[49:11] midst of Israel and that I am the Lord
[49:13] your godone else and my people shall
[49:17] never be
[49:24] ashamed amen amen God bless you be
[49:27] seated
[49:30] well if you notice he says this word
[49:33] this this phrase two times my people
[49:36] shall never be
[49:41] ashamed now God doesn't make
[49:44] mistakes he doesn't
[49:47] stutter or just repeat himself for no
[49:50] reason but when he says something and he
[49:53] says it again it has a meaning to
[49:58] it and he has a reason for saying
[50:01] it he wants to put an emphasis on it
[50:05] that my people shall never be
[50:08] ashamed I would like to speak to you
[50:10] that on that this
[50:12] morning my people shall never be
[50:16] ashamed in other words they will not be
[50:19] put into
[50:22] confusion or another meaning or be
[50:24] disappointed
[50:27] amen for he says I will restore all the
[50:30] devil has stole from
[50:34] you amen I believe that we have received
[50:38] a message of
[50:42] restoration it's a message that says I
[50:44] will restore your
[50:46] health I will restore your
[50:49] peace I will restore your
[50:51] joy I will restore your
[50:54] children man all the years the devil has
[50:58] taken and made a wasteland out
[51:01] of I'm going to send my
[51:04] rain and from that dry and Barren Earth
[51:07] life will spring up
[51:10] again amen I believe God is not going to
[51:13] leave you where he
[51:15] found amen you might feel Barren
[51:18] today
[51:20] lifeless amen but God has a
[51:23] rain that rain is his
[51:25] word and he sends his
[51:30] word amen and so the Devil comes and he
[51:33] tries to kill harm and
[51:36] Destroy he tries to take
[51:39] life he tries to strip off the power of
[51:42] the
[51:43] church but God says I will have a
[51:47] bride I will have a church I will have a
[51:51] people amen so no matter what the devil
[51:53] does or what the devil say
[51:56] says I will have a
[52:00] people amen another word another meaning
[52:02] to this word of
[52:04] shame it means a drying
[52:07] up of a land or a
[52:11] stream amen this is why he said I'm
[52:13] going to send my
[52:15] rain because the land is
[52:17] dry amen the moisture has been taken
[52:21] from but I'm going to send a rain amen
[52:24] and when when a land dries
[52:27] up uh you know if it's a wet land you
[52:29] know
[52:30] wet so it begins to dry the fish begins
[52:34] to
[52:35] Die the vegetation begins to
[52:39] die and from that from that death comes
[52:42] a
[52:44] stink because of all the rotting
[52:49] matter and it gives off a real bad
[52:53] odor and this is what your life
[52:56] was when it was dried up it
[52:59] stunk it gave off a bad
[53:02] order but God sends his
[53:05] rain and from that Dy land amen Life
[53:09] Starts springing up amen life comes
[53:13] forth and what was
[53:16] withered is now coming to life what was
[53:19] ashamed and
[53:21] Confused is now brought back to his
[53:24] right mind
[53:27] now we want to find out why was this
[53:29] land in this
[53:31] condition and we can read in Joel 1 and
[53:34] verse
[53:36] 10 it says the field is wasted and the
[53:40] land mourneth for the corn is wasted and
[53:43] the new wine is dried up and the oil
[53:52] languishes be ye ashamed oh ye husband
[53:55] men how oh ye Vine dressers for the
[53:58] wheat and for the barley because the
[54:00] Harvest of the field is
[54:07] perished the the vine is dried up and
[54:10] the Fig Tree languisheth the pomegranate
[54:13] tree the palm tree the apple tree and
[54:15] all the trees of the field are withered
[54:17] because Joy is withered away from the
[54:19] sons of
[54:24] men
[54:28] see Winds of different doctrines had
[54:30] blow through the
[54:33] land and the husband men or the men that
[54:36] was over the
[54:39] land they allowed those winds to kill
[54:42] the movement of the
[54:45] spirit they allowed it to dry up the
[54:48] flow of the word of
[54:51] God Fields were
[54:53] perished but said my
[54:56] floor my floor will be overflowing with
[54:59] a
[55:00] harvest so it doesn't matter what man
[55:03] decrees or what man
[55:06] says God's word says I'm going to have a
[55:10] bride I'm going to have a people I'm
[55:13] going to have a bride without spot
[55:15] without
[55:16] R amen and it's going to overflow with
[55:20] wheat the wheat is the word of God and
[55:24] it's going to over flow with
[55:27] wine there will be
[55:29] word and there will be stimulation
[55:33] Revelation hallelujah amen Amen brother
[55:36] Bram taught what the wine and the oil
[55:38] represented in the
[55:40] Bible he spoke about it in the third
[55:43] seal he said the oil simplifies the Holy
[55:47] Spirit the wine symbolizes stimulation
[55:50] of re
[55:52] Revelation he said I almost w woke up
[55:55] the neighborhood when the Lord showed me
[55:59] that stimulation of
[56:02] Revelation all and wine is always
[56:05] represented
[56:07] together amen amen he said when the
[56:10] truth of the promised word of
[56:13] God the wheat amen has been truly
[56:16] revealed to his
[56:18] Saints those that are filled with oil
[56:22] they will get
[56:23] stimulated amen wine is a
[56:27] stimulation he says Glory I right now
[56:31] stimulated with joy stimulated with
[56:35] shouts this wine has the same
[56:38] effect on a man who drinks natural
[56:42] wine he said because when the Revelation
[56:45] has been given of the truth of
[56:48] God and the True Believer filled with
[56:51] all and the Revelation is revealed the
[56:55] stimulation becomes so
[56:57] great it makes him behave himself
[57:04] unnormal amen un normally in other words
[57:08] you're not going to be
[57:11] normal amen I don't know about you but I
[57:14] don't care about being a normal
[57:19] person amen I don't want what the world
[57:22] says is
[57:23] nor that is normal to be you know your
[57:26] hair all different
[57:28] colors and to dress all kind of ways and
[57:31] to live all kind of way that might be
[57:34] their
[57:35] normal I am
[57:38] unnormal this is not my
[57:40] home this is not my land this is not
[57:44] where I belong I'm going to where I
[57:48] belong Hallelujah and when I get there
[57:52] I'll be
[57:53] normal hallelujah amen shout on the
[57:56] hills of
[57:59] glory amen amen he said if you want
[58:01] scripture for
[58:03] that he said just start reading acts
[58:06] two when the promise of the Holy Ghost
[58:09] was poured out on
[58:11] them he said you know maybe one of them
[58:13] said we he told us to wait here for our
[58:17] ministry maybe Mark said to
[58:20] Matthew well we've already got it don't
[58:23] you think so we already got it we ought
[58:26] to just go
[58:28] preaching and said no we're not we we
[58:31] ain't there we haven't got it yet and he
[58:34] said I can see Peter wait a minute the
[58:37] scripture says you stay there
[58:41] until you stay there until Joel's
[58:44] prophecy comes to
[58:46] pass until Isaiah's
[58:49] prophecy with stammering lips and with
[58:51] other tongues speak to
[58:55] this is the
[58:57] refreshment this is the wine that's
[58:59] being poured
[59:01] out what is wine in the B refreshment
[59:05] this refreshment comes from the presence
[59:08] of almighty
[59:10] God Amen wine representing stimulation
[59:13] of
[59:13] Revelation and when the Holy Ghost fell
[59:17] they seen the fire of God upon and that
[59:20] begin to stimulate them first thing you
[59:22] know is stimulated them
[59:25] to people thought they were
[59:29] drunk come on now they thought they were
[59:33] drunk I want you to understand God wants
[59:36] us to have more than a head
[59:39] knowledge more than
[59:41] education it's more than degrees we can
[59:44] hang on our
[59:45] wall but it's a life of Jesus Christ
[59:49] coming into the believer to fill you to
[59:53] change you
[59:55] to move you from who you
[1:00:00] was hallelujah amen amen you so well you
[1:00:04] know Mary received it without
[1:00:07] sensation no if you read that brother
[1:00:09] Brandon was talking
[1:00:11] about when when when Mary met the
[1:00:15] angel amen that wasn't when she received
[1:00:17] the Holy
[1:00:19] Ghost that was when she got
[1:00:21] pregnant but if you'll read what he said
[1:00:23] about her receiv the Holy
[1:00:26] Ghost she was in the upper
[1:00:29] room and she got
[1:00:32] drunk and she came out
[1:00:35] staggering just like all of the
[1:00:37] others hallelujah amen amen listen we
[1:00:41] want more than just the head
[1:00:44] knowledge we want more than just
[1:00:47] scriptures we want more than just
[1:00:49] quotes but it's a live
[1:00:52] voice it's a live voice
[1:00:55] amen a live voice that tell Satan take
[1:00:59] your hands off of
[1:01:00] God a live voice that'll look that devil
[1:01:04] in the eye say devil I'm not going to
[1:01:07] serve you no but I'm going to serve a
[1:01:12] Liv I want to serve
[1:01:15] him

[1:01:20] some uh
[1:01:22] education but we're here to bring you to
[1:01:24] a place that can stimulate
[1:01:27] you Amen to a place of
[1:01:30] Revelation amen you'll go home he said I

[1:01:37] God amen

[1:01:46] the
[1:01:47] inside hallelujah amen amen but you
[1:01:51] notice amen he said it in the he said he
[1:01:54] said touch not the oil and the
[1:01:57] wine in the third seal brother Bram said
[1:02:00] who said that he said the lamb said that
[1:02:04] it wasn't just the four Beast that said
[1:02:07] the lamb said so if the lamb
[1:02:11] said don't hurt the old and the
[1:02:15] wiow don't stop it up let it flow let
[1:02:20] stimulation of Revelation begin to flow
[1:02:23] into every heart every life hallelujah
[1:02:27] amen if I can get you to understand
[1:02:30] you're not just some trotting down

[1:02:40] price call by the name of Jesus
[1:02:43] Christ it'll start stimulating you it'll
[1:02:46] start changing your
[1:02:49] thoughts hallelujah amen he said that's
[1:02:51] the reason I like these four gospel
[1:02:53] conviction
[1:02:56] is that what we're in a Full Gospel
[1:03:00] convention I want the full
[1:03:04] gospel he said you hear people cry and
[1:03:07] Shout praise the
[1:03:09] Lord you hear people cry and shout and
[1:03:12] praise the Lord God and because they've
[1:03:14] come into
[1:03:15] Fellowship Divine fellowship with the
[1:03:18] Holy
[1:03:19] Spirit whenever you get rid of
[1:03:23] that you gone back to
[1:03:26] Babylon and you might as well bury
[1:03:29] yourself when we get to the place we get
[1:03:33] away from the Shana
[1:03:35] Glory that Praises of God that fresh
[1:03:40] anointing that breaks down all religious
[1:03:44] barriers makes us one with Christ Jesus
[1:03:48] free from all
[1:03:49] condemnation that's what we need
[1:03:53] to he said I found in these conventions
[1:03:56] in places where men and
[1:03:58] women they are not
[1:04:00] ashamed they are not ashamed of the
[1:04:03] Gospel they're ready to testify about
[1:04:07] sing about it shout about it he said
[1:04:10] I've even heard them
[1:04:12] speak he said you don't hear it much

[1:06:19] desert and he said in Arizona in the
[1:06:21] United States in
[1:06:23] Arizona
[1:06:24] there's not much rain so everything's
[1:06:27] dried

[1:06:48] come to a place there's a lot of
[1:06:52] rain and there's no sticker on it he

[1:17:34] meeting back at the first of the year in
[1:17:37] in in
[1:17:39] Canada and uh sister Ruth and sister
[1:17:41] Katie was with me brother Kelly
[1:17:44] hilderbrand Kelly H and the first night
[1:17:47] I was to
[1:17:49] minister and I was you know didn't know
[1:17:51] what to preach so so they had went with
[1:17:53] the sister uh sister hildbrand to shop a
[1:17:56] little
[1:17:57] bit and I was in the hotel
[1:18:01] room I'm just praying God I W you know
[1:18:04] there as these brothers know you can
[1:18:06] there's a lot to
[1:18:07] preach but you want to preach the
[1:18:10] right and so I was just asking God to
[1:18:13] direct me to the right
[1:18:15] place so I began to read about the woman
[1:18:18] who touched him
[1:18:21] daughter had the blood
[1:18:24] and as I begin to read it the presence
[1:18:26] of the Lord fell
[1:18:28] into it's almost like the room just lit
[1:18:31] up so I take I took that thought on who
[1:18:34] touched
[1:18:35] me and I preached it that
[1:18:37] night well there was a young man who had
[1:18:40] been raised up in the
[1:18:42] church and they had a lot of issues and
[1:18:44] things I don't know the whole story and
[1:18:47] he left when he's about I think 12 or 13
[1:18:49] years
[1:18:50] old now he's in his 30s
[1:18:53] and he's married and his wife he marries
[1:18:57] gets diagnosed with
[1:18:59] Ms
[1:19:03] yeah yeah and so he he he's asking God
[1:19:07] to be
[1:19:08] merciful and so he he comes he said look
[1:19:12] he said I know where God's
[1:19:14] at she she was not a message believer at
[1:19:18] all wouldn't really really
[1:19:20] anything of course Christianity
[1:19:24] he said but we've got to we've got to
[1:19:25] get to
[1:19:26] God and I know where he's at so he came
[1:19:30] to that
[1:19:31] first and before he came he went into
[1:19:34] his
[1:19:35] bedroom and he knelt down he said Lord
[1:19:38] I've left you a long time
[1:19:40] ago and I've been away from you but if I
[1:19:44] can just touch the
[1:19:47] of if I can just touch you tonight I
[1:19:51] know you can make her well
[1:19:53] and here I come and I begin to speak on
[1:19:56] who touched

[1:20:01] answer he heard the cry he heard the
[1:20:05] heart and he was already

[1:20:38] a broken
[1:20:41] heart and save as such as be of a
[1:20:44] contrite

[1:21:27] it and you trip over
[1:21:30] something and and it drops and it breaks
[1:21:33] into the
[1:21:34] pieces they actually they they don't
[1:21:36] take that and throw it all
[1:21:38] away but they have this technique called
[1:21:44] kugi and it's it's actually a repair of
[1:21:48] Pottery by putting the pieces together
[1:21:53] using
[1:21:54] gold and they say actually the latter
[1:21:59] the latter of uh the the latter form of
[1:22:01] the vessel is worth more than the
[1:22:07] former because of the gold that's placed
[1:22:09] in the
[1:22:12] cracks I got to thinking about that we
[1:22:16] were also broken

[1:23:42] Unique one of a
[1:23:45] kind cuz when we fall we don't all break
