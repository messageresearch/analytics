[49:03] oh God may you strengthen a Believer
[49:05] today Lord
[49:07] you see the attack of the enemy Lord
[49:09] cancer on the loose Lord sickness is on
[49:12] the loose
[49:13] but oh God when we see the enemy coming
[49:15] in like a flood you said you'd raise a
[49:17] standard Lord this word is a standard
[49:19] and we're your people father we believe
[49:21] this word and we're thankful for the
[49:23] message you've given us in this hour
[49:25] Lord we just invite you this morning you
[49:28] would come and be the voice you would
[49:30] come and be the preacher God anoint the
[49:32] lips to speak only the things of life
[49:34] but not only the lips oh God but may
[49:36] your known our ears to hear what this
[49:38] Spirit would have to be said
[49:40] we love you now father we commit this
[49:42] service to your care in Jesus name if
[49:44] you have your Bibles this morning
[49:49] amen
[49:51] well
[49:52] let's have church
[49:55] I don't know if that scared you but it
[49:56] scared me
[49:58] my mama's if I was not nervous enough
[50:01] so we just want to greet you this
[50:03] morning you know uh many months ago I
[50:06] knew I was going to be taking this Labor
[50:08] Day service and the Lord put this
[50:09] thought on my heart many months ago and
[50:11] I've been studying on it and this today
[50:13] is actually the wrapping up of all the
[50:15] services that I did on the word we bring
[50:17] forth and I want to speak to you this
[50:19] morning on manifested Sons and I believe
[50:21] that's what God's whole intention was
[50:23] even in the back part of his mind before
[50:25] there was ever an earth there was ever a
[50:27] molecule ever expressed God had you and
[50:30] I in his thoughts and he was looking for
[50:32] this day that there would be a time that
[50:34] he would have sons and daughters of God
[50:36] that would manifest his very same spirit
[50:38] and I believe we're living in that day
[50:40] today and if you have your Bibles we're
[50:42] going to turn to Romans 8 and verse 12
[50:44] and as you're turning there just want to
[50:46] say God bless you brother Adam sister
[50:48] Bethany it's good to have you with us
[50:49] this morning
[50:51] welcome home Adam
[50:54] you always have a place here at evening
[50:56] light Tabernacle you and your family we
[50:58] we certainly miss you but we know you're
[50:59] blessing where you are and we wouldn't
[51:01] try to steal the blessing from the
[51:03] little church there but we're just glad
[51:05] that they could share you this weekend
[51:06] with us and we trust that something to
[51:08] be said that will bless you and your
[51:09] family today and and for each of us that
[51:11] are here we look here and we find in
[51:13] Romans 8 the Bible says therefore
[51:15] brethren we are debtors not to the flesh
[51:18] to live after the flesh for if ye live
[51:21] after the flesh you shall die but if you
[51:23] through the spirit do mortify the Deeds
[51:26] of the body ye shall live for as many
[51:29] are led by the spirit of God they are
[51:31] the sons of God for ye have not received
[51:34] a spirit of bondage again to fear but
[51:36] you have received a spirit of adoption
[51:38] notice we're not have received we've not
[51:41] received a spirit of bondage or or
[51:43] slavery to fear anymore but we've
[51:45] received the spirit of adoption and that
[51:47] word adoption there is the placing of
[51:49] sons
[51:50] notice where about we cry Abba Father
[51:52] and here in verse 16 and the spirit
[51:55] which is the holy spirit itself bear
[51:58] witness with our spirit that we are the
[52:01] children of God and if children then
[52:04] heirs Heirs of God and Joint heirs with
[52:07] Christ it's so be that you suffer with
[52:09] him that you may also that you may be
[52:12] also glorified together for I reckon
[52:14] that the sufferings of this present time
[52:16] are not worthy to be compared with the
[52:18] glory which shall be revealed in US
[52:20] verse 19. and this is what we're drawing
[52:23] our context this morning for the earnest
[52:25] expectation of the creature waited for
[52:28] the manifestation of the sons of God God
[52:31] bless you you can have your seats this
[52:33] morning
[52:36] and I like brother brother Mike we just
[52:39] want to say appreciate each and every
[52:40] one of you being here I know that
[52:41] there's meetings going on around the
[52:44] United States today some there in Dallas
[52:46] with brother Danny and brother Ron so I
[52:48] appreciate each of you that are here
[52:49] this morning I know we're a little bit
[52:51] smaller group than normal but I believe
[52:52] that we're not necessarily worried about
[52:54] the size of the congregation it's the
[52:56] quality and I believe you're a quality
[52:58] people who love this word and love the
[53:00] message so if you'll just get behind the
[53:02] message this morning I promise you I'll
[53:04] only preach what the Lord lays on my
[53:05] heart
[53:07] so we look here in verse 17 the Bible
[53:09] says if children how many of us are
[53:11] children now we're offspring of God as
[53:13] children then heirs and Heirs of God and
[53:16] join air so notice we're just as Eternal
[53:18] as God is we're joint heirs with him
[53:21] we're just as mortal as God is Immortal
[53:23] we get to enter into his joy we get to
[53:26] sit down with him in his throne we get
[53:28] to partake of him and his glory we get
[53:31] to uh inherit all things that he and
[53:34] Harris notice he shares his kingdom with
[53:37] us
[53:40] so we're joint heirs with him everything
[53:42] that he has done he has done it with the
[53:45] mindset that he's going to share his
[53:48] kingdom with his church with his bride
[53:50] and you are that bride you are that
[53:53] church and we find here but here's where
[53:56] I want to focus on this morning is
[53:57] Romans 8 19 for the earnest expectation
[54:01] that phrase Earnest expectation it
[54:04] signifies the lifting up of the head and
[54:07] the stretching of the body how many
[54:10] turkey hunters do we have in here this
[54:11] morning
[54:13] come on somebody I'm the only one
[54:16] okay well we got one or two in the
[54:18] turkey hunting let me just say this is
[54:20] what happens when you start going you
[54:21] get out there early in the morning it's
[54:22] about that before Daybreak and you just
[54:25] sit there and you're listening and all
[54:26] of a sudden you may do a hoot owl call
[54:27] and you're expecting you start listening
[54:30] you start stretching that ears like that
[54:32] extra six inches is going to help you
[54:34] hear any better but you're stretching it
[54:36] out trying to hear the call of that
[54:38] gobbler back on the other end
[54:40] and this is what we're saying here is
[54:42] that that the earnest expectation
[54:44] reaching out listening with a Earnest
[54:47] desire the creature waves for the
[54:50] revealing or the manifestation of sons
[54:52] now this Earnest expectation is a very
[54:55] great earnestness of desire and
[54:58] expectation of a Hemet longing after
[55:02] notice all of creation has waited for
[55:04] this moment and now here the earnestness
[55:07] is waiting it's all come down through
[55:09] seven Church ages now it's come down to
[55:12] the final Church age the final voices
[55:15] sounded out and there's a people in the
[55:18] land who's under an Earnest expectation
[55:21] with their ears outstretched to hear
[55:23] what the spirit of God is saying to this
[55:26] age
[55:27] notice their Earnest expectation here of
[55:31] the creature waited for the
[55:33] manifestation notice the manifestation
[55:36] of that word means the appearance or the
[55:39] revealing of the sons of God no longer
[55:42] are we going to kick the can down the
[55:44] road and wait for Sons to come notice
[55:46] we're living in the moment we're living
[55:48] in the day we're living in a time where
[55:51] there will be sons of God that will be
[55:53] manifested they will declare to this
[55:56] generation that we are the sons of God
[55:59] how do you know because the very same
[56:01] Spirit the very same life the very same
[56:04] power the very same anointing will begin
[56:07] to flow out through them and they are an
[56:09] under an Earnest expectation to reveal
[56:13] to this generation that we are sons of
[56:15] God
[56:16] that we are the manifestation of all the
[56:20] prophecies we are the Fulfillment we are
[56:22] the culmination it's come down to this
[56:25] moment brother sister and no longer is
[56:27] God waiting for you to come you are here
[56:31] oh my
[56:34] God I told myself I got to just slow
[56:35] down and calm down this morning
[56:37] notice the creature he says is watching
[56:40] as with an outstretched head waiting for
[56:43] the future unveiling now this is Paul
[56:46] Paul is speaking this in Romans and he
[56:49] was speaking about what they were going
[56:50] to be doing they were waiting through
[56:52] seven Church ages for the revealing
[56:55] we're in the end
[56:57] we are in the revealing of the sons of
[57:00] God the manifestation we're not looking
[57:02] for another messenger we're not looking
[57:04] for another age we're not looking for
[57:07] sons of God to be manifested we are the
[57:09] sons of God that are being manifested
[57:12] Romans 8 in verse 21 it says because
[57:14] notice now because the creature itself
[57:18] also shall be delivered from the bondage
[57:20] of corruption
[57:22] the creature itself also shall be
[57:25] delivered from the bondage of corruption
[57:27] into a glorious Liberty of the children
[57:29] of God for we know that the whole
[57:32] everything all types of creation groanth
[57:35] and travaleth in pain together until now
[57:39] and not only they but ourselves also we
[57:43] which have the first fruits of the
[57:45] spirit even we ourselves grown within
[57:48] ourselves waiting for the adoption to
[57:51] with the change or the Redemption of our
[57:54] bodies
[57:55] so all of creation is waiting
[57:58] all of creation is groaning
[58:02] all of creation is waiting for man to
[58:06] get back in a perfect condition
[58:09] so we understand that in the beginning
[58:11] God created man
[58:13] in his own likeness in his own image and
[58:16] God took that perfect creation and he
[58:18] placed him in a perfect garden
[58:20] there was no sin there was no
[58:22] thunderstorms there was no heat waves it
[58:25] wasn't 105 degrees it didn't get below
[58:28] zero it was a it was a perfect condition
[58:30] and brother Brown would tell us in the
[58:31] fellowship through reconciliation of the
[58:33] blood he said in the beginning when God
[58:35] made man in his own image he put him in
[58:38] the garden of him he had a perfect
[58:40] Fellowship
[58:43] in the late of the afternoon the evening
[58:45] time when the Twilights was falling I
[58:47] could see great Jehovah come across the
[58:50] top of the palm trees and the Roaring of
[58:52] the Thunder when Adam and Eve gathered
[58:55] out there in the great open air
[58:56] Cathedral and they worshiped God and
[58:58] have fellowship and they talked with him
[59:01] The Lion and the Tigers all coming up
[59:03] around in Perfect Harmony
[59:06] notice this Eden notice this condition
[59:10] notice wouldn't that be a wonderful
[59:12] place to live a biting place where
[59:14] there's no sickness
[59:16] come on somebody no sorrow
[59:20] no way of ever being upset everything's
[59:23] in Perfect Harmony God in harmony with
[59:26] this creature and the creature in
[59:28] harmony with this maker he said what a
[59:30] perfect time a complete Fellowship
[59:32] that's the way God intended
[59:36] see man in the beginning when he was
[59:38] made he God made him God made him a God
[59:42] he was absolutely a God for he was in
[59:45] the image of God being a Son of God and
[59:48] then he was an heir of all that God is
[59:50] and man was given a domain domain was
[59:54] the earth he says you have power over
[59:55] the fish you have power over the fowls
[59:57] of the air over everything he could
[59:59] speak and everything obeyed him because
[1:00:01] why he was a God he said he wasn't
[1:00:03] Universal God but he was a God now and
[1:00:06] he had rulership in Dominion he was a
[1:00:08] king or a king ruler and that was man
[1:00:11] but we find When sin first came in the
[1:00:14] Garden of Eden man was in a perfect
[1:00:16] State until he fell
[1:00:19] and then he marred his Perfection he
[1:00:22] marred his inheritance with God his
[1:00:25] Fellowship was cut away from God and he
[1:00:27] goes brother Brown says in the
[1:00:29] fellowship with God he says now I can
[1:00:31] see little Eve with her those beautiful
[1:00:33] eyes now after sin had set HIM Tears
[1:00:36] filled them
[1:00:38] they run down her cheek I can see Adam
[1:00:41] with those strong eyes as he looked
[1:00:43] across Eden the soft winds blowing where
[1:00:46] he had to make Beast obey him in the
[1:00:49] winds and the ways to obey him
[1:00:50] everything else had to obey him he had
[1:00:53] full rulership over the Earth
[1:00:55] but he realized that he had lost his
[1:00:57] fellowship with God and the tears to
[1:01:00] show him that now he was mortal
[1:01:03] tripped off his face and they run down
[1:01:05] over his bosom and they dripped into the
[1:01:07] into Eve's head noticed
[1:01:09] man was in a perfect condition
[1:01:13] creation was in a perfect condition
[1:01:16] botany life Beast life everything was in
[1:01:19] a perfect condition until sin fell until
[1:01:23] sin came more the program and from this
[1:01:27] time botany life has been waiting for
[1:01:30] the manifestation of sons Beast life
[1:01:33] animal life has been waiting for the
[1:01:35] manifestation of souls until sons of God
[1:01:38] will get back to a perfect
[1:01:40] Eternal condition to where there's no
[1:01:42] death there's no sorrow there's no pain
[1:01:44] nothing but Perfection and all of
[1:01:47] creation has been groaning
[1:01:51] has been lamenting groaning waiting for
[1:01:54] the moment waiting through seven Church
[1:01:56] ages that they would finally come a
[1:01:59] people that would finally come one that
[1:02:01] they will be what the manifestation of
[1:02:04] all that's been declared that God will
[1:02:06] send forth the bride they will take God
[1:02:08] at his word and they will become the
[1:02:11] very word made flesh and all of creation
[1:02:14] has been waiting look church when you
[1:02:16] look outside and you see the trees
[1:02:18] bending over because of the heat they're
[1:02:20] waiting on you to get back in position
[1:02:22] when you look at the grass out there
[1:02:24] that's dying because of the heat they're
[1:02:26] waiting on you to get in position oh
[1:02:28] everything is waiting on this bride to
[1:02:31] give it her Godly position so that she
[1:02:34] can manifest himself through you in this
[1:02:37] hour
[1:02:39] everything's waiting
[1:02:41] everything has been waiting on us
[1:02:46] notice and I believe there's a place in
[1:02:48] the Bible that those on the other side
[1:02:51] are waiting
[1:02:54] that they without us
[1:02:57] can't be made perfect
[1:02:59] we are
[1:03:01] the finishing of the work
[1:03:03] come on somebody we are quit kicking the
[1:03:06] can down the road Quinn looking at your
[1:03:08] mistakes quit looking at your family and
[1:03:10] start looking to what the word I am the
[1:03:12] finished product I'm everything that God
[1:03:15] declared that I was going to be I may
[1:03:18] not be in full manifestation yet but I
[1:03:20] believe the word the word's already been
[1:03:22] spoke over me and I'm going to manifest
[1:03:24] everything that he says I'm going to
[1:03:26] manifest I'm going to say Amen to the
[1:03:29] word I'm going to believe the word I may
[1:03:31] not understand it I may not be able to
[1:03:33] figure it all out but that's not what
[1:03:35] God is asking us to do he's asking you
[1:03:37] to believe because every bit everybody
[1:03:40] all the creation is waiting for this
[1:03:43] moment for this people that come to
[1:03:45] their Revelation that I am a son of God
[1:03:48] oh I say glory to God this morning what
[1:03:51] a people we should be
[1:03:54] everything is hinging on you this
[1:03:56] morning

[1:04:35] God's gonna say yes that's you I've been
[1:04:37] longer for this moment I've been waiting
[1:04:39] for this hour to Sons and Daughters of
[1:04:42] God they step out of the time element
[1:04:44] and they step into eternity into a
[1:04:46] glorified body oh well body a miraculous
[1:04:49] body oh that's what he's been longing
[1:04:51] for the manifestation of the sons of God
[1:04:54] God is
[1:04:57] Safeway no longer father we're here
[1:05:00] we're here to Manifest this word we're
[1:05:02] here to declare we're not a denomination
[1:05:04] but we are Sons and Daughters of God
[1:05:10] the Amplified Bible would tell us in
[1:05:12] Romans 8 19 it says for even the whole
[1:05:16] creation
[1:05:17] all nature waits expectantly in Longs
[1:05:21] earnestly for God's son Sons to be made
[1:05:24] known
[1:05:25] they wait for the revealing
[1:05:28] and the disclosing of their sonship
[1:05:33] the scriptures 2009 interpretation
[1:05:37] that's a that's a translation just says
[1:05:39] for the intense longing of the creation
[1:05:42] eerily Waits
[1:05:44] for the revealing of the sons of Elohim
[1:05:48] anxiously looking with outstretched
[1:05:50] heads
[1:05:52] looking
[1:05:53] oh my
[1:05:56] God Obama says now all the creation is
[1:05:58] groaning
[1:05:59] everything is growing look at the trees
[1:06:01] how they struggle look at the flowers
[1:06:04] how they struggle for life just for the
[1:06:07] frost to tear them down look at the
[1:06:09] trees how they struggle to hold their
[1:06:10] branches out to sing glories unto God
[1:06:13] everything all nature all animal all
[1:06:16] birds hey flies from the enemy quickly
[1:06:18] and gets away everything groaning and we
[1:06:21] ourselves said Paul we've grown too with
[1:06:24] them for we are waiting for the
[1:06:26] Redemption of our bodies
[1:06:29] see everything is waiting on the sons of
[1:06:32] God to get back in the right position
[1:06:36] see man is God's highest form of
[1:06:38] creation
[1:06:39] and when God created man he created him
[1:06:41] in his image and God had an intention in
[1:06:43] the beginning to have a family but we
[1:06:45] find the fall came in marred the plan of
[1:06:47] God or so the devil thought that it did
[1:06:50] but God knew that he had attributes that
[1:06:52] laid on the inside of him to be a Healer
[1:06:54] so he had to have man to come into a
[1:06:56] fallen state so he can heal the body and
[1:06:59] he had all these different attributes
[1:07:00] and ever since the fall the all the
[1:07:03] creation has been waiting to get back
[1:07:05] into an Eden experience
[1:07:08] come on Church
[1:07:09] botany life is waiting on the
[1:07:11] manifestation of sons animal life is
[1:07:13] waiting on a manifestation of sons and
[1:07:15] it bodily life and animal life were
[1:07:17] waiting for the manifestation of
[1:07:18] something then what about Sons
[1:07:21] then what about us this morning what
[1:07:23] about us who are created in the image of
[1:07:25] God shouldn't we be under an Earnest
[1:07:27] expectation
[1:07:29] shouldn't we be coming to every Service
[1:07:31] as if this may be the service that I
[1:07:34] catch the Revelation and maybe not only
[1:07:36] for me but for my child maybe for that
[1:07:38] Wayward loved one maybe this is the
[1:07:41] service where I quit worrying about it I
[1:07:43] don't have no more fear anymore I'm
[1:07:44] resting in the Eternal plan of God that
[1:07:47] they are sons of God they are Daughters
[1:07:49] of God and they may go a long time
[1:07:51] before they ever recognize that they are
[1:07:52] a son but the word's already been spoken
[1:07:55] over them and they're going to come back
[1:07:56] oh that seat may be empty this morning
[1:07:58] but it ain't gonna always be empty
[1:08:00] because why because we got a promise
[1:08:02] prodigals will come home I say Oh Glory
[1:08:05] to God this morning that's our word
[1:08:07] that's our promise don't you let go of
[1:08:09] that don't you let the devil take that
[1:08:11] promise from you this morning
[1:08:13] we got a word
[1:08:16] and we're going to manifest that word
[1:08:19] notice there's an Earnest expectation in
[1:08:22] the heart of every believer this morning
[1:08:24] for the manifestation
[1:08:26] to reveal that I am a son of God
[1:08:30] I am
[1:08:32] I'm a son to go back to where the sons
[1:08:34] of God back in speaking terms with the
[1:08:37] father
[1:08:38] oh my
[1:08:39] think about that back till we step out
[1:08:41] of these old dying decaying bodies on
[1:08:43] mortality and we step into an immortal
[1:08:45] body
[1:08:47] well I feel like brother Jewel Forney
[1:08:48] won't it be a time
[1:08:50] man I looked at my hands and my hands
[1:08:53] look new
[1:08:54] I looked at my feet and my feet did too
[1:08:57] won't it be a tie
[1:08:59] oh won't it be a glorious oh this is
[1:09:01] what we've been longing for sure I don't
[1:09:03] know about you but ever since I became a
[1:09:05] Christian I've been longer for that day
[1:09:07] I heard about a Rapture but every day
[1:09:09] that we've surpassed or we go through is
[1:09:11] one day closer until we meet that body
[1:09:13] change how won't it be a time would it
[1:09:16] be a time when we step out of these
[1:09:18] decaying bodies and we step into a
[1:09:20] glorified body no more pain no more
[1:09:23] sickness no more disappointments no more
[1:09:25] just struggles oh won't it be a time
[1:09:27] Church manifesting sons of God
[1:09:32] oh my
[1:09:36] God Paul will tell us all the creation
[1:09:40] all the creation is waiting
[1:09:43] groaning under an expectancy to see the
[1:09:46] Divine end
[1:09:48] the divinely appointed end
[1:09:52] see the scriptures have been pointing to
[1:09:54] this day
[1:09:57] all the scriptures have been pointing to
[1:09:59] your arrival
[1:10:01] well we thought maybe 40 years ago or 50
[1:10:04] years ago that that was it
[1:10:06] no God still had seeds planted
[1:10:09] and those seeds had to come up and
[1:10:10] manifest him
[1:10:13] because you see back in when brother
[1:10:15] Branham preached the message when he
[1:10:16] came and he was the Forerunner and he
[1:10:18] and he spoke those words those seeds a
[1:10:20] lot of it fell on dry ground or it fell
[1:10:22] in the ground waiting for your arrival
[1:10:24] waiting for the moment that there will
[1:10:26] be Sons and Daughters of God they will
[1:10:28] catch that word and that word would
[1:10:30] catch their spirit and that Spirit would
[1:10:33] change their lives and they will be an
[1:10:35] end time people with an end time word
[1:10:37] for an end time prophecy and they will
[1:10:39] be the Fulfillment of everything that
[1:10:42] I'd ever spoken it went over a lot of
[1:10:44] people's heads in the 50s and 60s but it
[1:10:47] didn't go over our head
[1:10:48] no why because you are seeds you can be
[1:10:51] reborn not because the sea came as a
[1:10:55] product of God but we understand or we
[1:10:57] understand that it's the seed that comes
[1:10:59] predestinated from God
[1:11:01] and because you are seeds you can't be
[1:11:04] reborn again and receive this message
[1:11:07] but we find all the creation is groaning
[1:11:10] and waiting with an expectancy for that
[1:11:13] divinely appointed in
[1:11:16] Jeremiah 29 and verse 11. we're very
[1:11:19] familiar with this
[1:11:21] he says this is Jeremiah speaking but
[1:11:23] he's speaking under the anointing of the
[1:11:25] spirit and he says for I know the
[1:11:27] thoughts that I think towards you
[1:11:28] saith the Lord
[1:11:31] thoughts of peace and not of evil to
[1:11:34] give you an expected end
[1:11:38] see this word expected here is a thing
[1:11:41] that God has long notice God has longed
[1:11:44] to give you an unexpected end
[1:11:47] God has been waiting on that day that he
[1:11:50] would have a bride God has been waiting
[1:11:53] on that day that when he would come that
[1:11:55] he would find faith that he would find
[1:11:57] the people that would believe his word
[1:12:01] notice not a nation that's going to come
[1:12:03] to a Devastation or come to an end but
[1:12:06] he's going to bring him a future and a
[1:12:07] hope and this word in here is a reward
[1:12:10] so God has been longing for the day that
[1:12:13] he was going to bring his people to
[1:12:15] their reward
[1:12:16] oh my church
[1:12:18] we're here
[1:12:20] come on let your face know you're here
[1:12:23] let your neighbor know you're here we're
[1:12:24] here we have arrived
[1:12:28] now I know I shared this to your life
[1:12:29] but I'm going to share it again because
[1:12:30] it fits perfectly where I'm at today but
[1:12:32] at our youth camp brother Donnie was in
[1:12:34] the back and he began to prophesy and he
[1:12:37] interpreted and his prophecy to the
[1:12:39] brothers he says I have waited for this
[1:12:41] time for so long to show my Majesty
[1:12:46] see God knew the expected end and here
[1:12:49] he comes through a man of this hour one
[1:12:51] that was going to be a manifested Son of
[1:12:53] God and he would bring him up into a
[1:12:55] Heavenly place that he would catch the
[1:12:57] inspiration from God and he said I've
[1:12:59] been waiting for so long to show you my
[1:13:02] Majesty to show you my sovereign power
[1:13:04] my authority to show you the Splendor of
[1:13:07] my quality and my character and he would
[1:13:10] tell him to preach the gospel
[1:13:12] notice we're in charge to preach the
[1:13:15] gospel to manifest the word of God not
[1:13:18] with just teaching of it through
[1:13:20] Theology and through psychology but make
[1:13:23] the word do what it says it will do
[1:13:25] that's the expectation of Sons of
[1:13:27] daughters of God
[1:13:29] and he says I will be with you my sons
[1:13:31] be not afraid of the Devils go back and
[1:13:33] be charged in the spirit this is the
[1:13:36] time
[1:13:38] you have been longing for
[1:13:41] notice God's been waiting for this time
[1:13:45] from the very thought that he had of you
[1:13:47] in the beginning
[1:13:48] when he spoke those thoughts
[1:13:50] God knew there was going to be seven
[1:13:52] Church ages God knew there was going to
[1:13:54] be a people in the final age and when
[1:13:56] you came under the anointing of the
[1:13:58] spirit and that see gene on the inside
[1:14:00] of you came to life now you've been
[1:14:03] longing for that same Revelation that I
[1:14:05] am the Fulfillment of all the prophecies
[1:14:08] I am the Fulfillment of all the
[1:14:10] scriptures we are here Church
[1:14:13] we've been waiting for it he's been
[1:14:15] waiting for it I said the wait is over
[1:14:17] we are the manifestation of the sons of
[1:14:20] God we are the ones that God has
[1:14:22] prophesied about we are the ones that
[1:14:24] are no longer coming we are here and
[1:14:26] we're ready to take a body change
[1:14:30] think about the world that we live in
[1:14:33] what if it went another 5 10 15 20 years
[1:14:36] think of where we would be
[1:14:39] as a society
[1:14:42] the world continues to deteriorate
[1:14:46] continues a downward spiral into
[1:14:50] depravity and God has longed for the day
[1:14:54] to bring his people
[1:14:56] to a reward an expected end
[1:15:00] see God has desired plans for those that
[1:15:03] trust him it's not an expectation of
[1:15:05] Destruction it's not an end to where we
[1:15:08] cease to exist but it's a future
[1:15:11] it's a hope
[1:15:13] notice it's a promise of a new body a
[1:15:15] body like his own glorious body a
[1:15:18] promise of eternal life never to grow
[1:15:20] old
[1:15:21] and that's where the old people say
[1:15:22] shout amen come on I know you got it in
[1:15:25] you
[1:15:26] never to grow old never to mention the
[1:15:29] word cancer ever again
[1:15:31] never a down moment of discouragement
[1:15:33] never a time without peace and joy
[1:15:37] oh won't that be a time
[1:15:40] oh this is not Pie in the Sky I've seen
[1:15:42] Castles in the Air this is reality this
[1:15:45] is where we are headed Church
[1:15:46] we're on the cusp of a body change we're
[1:15:49] on the cusp why because we even now in
[1:15:52] these sinful conditions not that we're
[1:15:54] simple but our bodies have not yet been
[1:15:56] born again our bodies have not yet
[1:15:58] received their adoption but our souls
[1:16:01] have received the adoption and the
[1:16:02] prophet of God said we got the earnest
[1:16:04] oh church we got the earnest what is
[1:16:07] that declare but we got in part we're
[1:16:09] going to come into the Fulfillment of a
[1:16:11] can total body change where we fully
[1:16:14] manifest Sons and Daughters of God
[1:16:18] Hallelujah
[1:16:20] y'all excuse my joy this morning I've
[1:16:23] been waiting months to preach this to
[1:16:24] you oh hallelujah it's unexpected here
[1:16:27] it's a desireity and it's in God's plan
[1:16:29] it's in God's his desires his purpose
[1:16:32] was to have a bride and the bride is
[1:16:35] here
[1:16:36] his purpose was to have a church without
[1:16:38] spot let me tell you she's not spotted
[1:16:40] up and she's not wrinkled up in the bed
[1:16:42] of some denomination but she's a perfect
[1:16:45] Church she's a perfect body oh she's in
[1:16:48] love with the perfect Savior and a
[1:16:50] perfect God
[1:16:52] it's time that when the sons of God
[1:16:55] begin to manifest his majesty
[1:16:59] to manifest our own ideas and our own
[1:17:01] thoughts for to manifest him
[1:17:04] to manifest his word we're living in the
[1:17:07] day where there'll be fully adopted Sons
[1:17:10] to be fully adopted
[1:17:14] though you got the Holy Ghost you're not
[1:17:16] fully adopted well there's coming a day
[1:17:18] Church
[1:17:19] where we'll be fully adopted
[1:17:22] oh my travel like a thought Hallelujah
[1:17:26] come on somebody won't that be nice
[1:17:30] may run out of gas on the way to church
[1:17:32] you have a bad day but there'll be a
[1:17:34] time you ain't got to worry about gas
[1:17:35] we're going to travel like a thought
[1:17:40] man I tell you I'm looking forward to
[1:17:42] that day Romans 8 19 for the earnest
[1:17:46] expectation of the creature waited for
[1:17:48] the manifestation of the sons of God
[1:17:51] brother Brown would take Romans 8 19 and
[1:17:53] he will preach the adoption series from
[1:17:55] it
[1:17:58] notice the seventh angel
[1:18:00] the seventh messenger will take one
[1:18:02] scripture and he'd begin to preach the
[1:18:05] adoption series
[1:18:07] the adoption series is the placing of
[1:18:10] the sons in their position
[1:18:13] notice there's been denominational ages
[1:18:16] there's been the Dark Age there's been
[1:18:17] this and there's been the Reformation
[1:18:19] age but all that did not Place Sons and
[1:18:22] Daughters of God in their position but
[1:18:24] God knew in the end time he was going to
[1:18:27] send that final voice and he was going
[1:18:29] to be the mouthpiece to this age and
[1:18:31] what was he going to do he was going to
[1:18:32] take all the loose sins from all the
[1:18:35] previous ages and he was going to tie
[1:18:37] those loose ends up and he was going to
[1:18:38] come with one great message and it was a
[1:18:41] message to the church that you had you
[1:18:44] wasn't always this you wasn't ever a pig
[1:18:46] but you always was a sheep and because
[1:18:49] you always was you always will be you
[1:18:52] always was my son but now Hallelujah I'm
[1:18:55] gonna place you as a Son of God I'm
[1:18:57] going to put my stamp of approval and
[1:19:00] I'm going to give you the Holy Ghost and
[1:19:01] you're going to be sealed in until the
[1:19:04] day of your Redemption
[1:19:06] noticed
[1:19:09] now this is not merely Romans 8 19 is
[1:19:11] not a future events where we get our
[1:19:14] glorified bodies though part of that may
[1:19:16] be but this is the placing of sons in
[1:19:18] their position of power and authority
[1:19:20] now
[1:19:21] the power and authority over the enemy
[1:19:24] now
[1:19:26] it's time where this Fallen Humanity
[1:19:29] this is a time where Fallen Humanity has
[1:19:31] been so filled with the Holy Ghost where
[1:19:34] once sin nature controlled you now you
[1:19:36] control sin nature when Once those
[1:19:39] thoughts controlled you and dictated how
[1:19:40] you did now you control those thoughts
[1:19:44] now where you had those complexes and
[1:19:46] those mind battles and all these
[1:19:48] generational curses that would come down
[1:19:50] and influence your decisions now through
[1:19:53] the power of the Holy Ghost as
[1:19:54] manifested Sons now you influenced that
[1:19:58] decision you pull down the strongholds
[1:20:00] you pull down and you bring in and you
[1:20:02] bring everything subject to the word of
[1:20:04] God I am a son and because I am a son
[1:20:07] I'm going to reject this thought I'm
[1:20:09] going to reject this lie I'm going to
[1:20:11] reject this feeling I'm going to reject
[1:20:13] this complex well because I am a Son of
[1:20:15] God and I got the earnest I got the down
[1:20:19] payment
[1:20:22] oh my
[1:20:24] adoption number two he says we're now
[1:20:27] coming to this great hidden Mystery
[1:20:29] that's been hid since the foundation of
[1:20:31] the world and now being revealed in the
[1:20:34] last days to the sons of God you believe
[1:20:37] that to be true that the sons of God are
[1:20:39] manifested
[1:20:42] do you believe that to be true that's
[1:20:44] not just a question on tape
[1:20:46] do you believe that to be true that the
[1:20:48] sons of God are to be manifested see now
[1:20:51] the whole of creation is groaning
[1:20:53] waiting for the manifestation of the
[1:20:55] sons of God but he says now Paul is
[1:20:58] going first or going to first place to
[1:21:01] church exactly where it belongs
[1:21:05] see now it's in the promised land that
[1:21:07] don't mean that you're immune from
[1:21:08] sickness doesn't mean that you're immune
[1:21:10] from troubles but it does spell this he
[1:21:12] says now let this sink deep it says that
[1:21:15] it's yours just to rise and take it
[1:21:17] so saying even though you had the Holy
[1:21:19] Ghost it doesn't mean that you're immune
[1:21:21] from sickness or you're immune from
[1:21:22] failures you're immune from
[1:21:24] disappointments but he says let this
[1:21:25] sing deep it means that it is yours you
[1:21:27] don't have to stay in that sinful
[1:21:29] condition or that that complex condition
[1:21:31] or or whatever it is you're gonna rise
[1:21:33] and take the promise take the word apply
[1:21:36] the token to your experience apply the
[1:21:38] token to your home apply the token to
[1:21:40] your marriage and believe that what God
[1:21:42] said you can have it
[1:21:45] he says you give me a church tonight A
[1:21:47] group of people perfectly perfectly in
[1:21:50] the promise of God with the holy ghost
[1:21:52] walking in the spirit he goes I'll
[1:21:54] challenge any disease or any Affliction
[1:21:56] or anything there is
[1:21:59] oh my come on Church
[1:22:03] notice with the Holy Ghost
[1:22:06] or you got the Holy Ghost how many you
[1:22:08] got the Holy Ghost this morning
[1:22:10] then we can challenge any sickness we
[1:22:13] can challenge any any Affliction we can
[1:22:15] challenge anything that there is and not
[1:22:18] only challenge it but know that we're
[1:22:20] going to come out on the other side more
[1:22:22] than Abel more than conquered I ask you
[1:22:25] this morning is anything too hard for
[1:22:26] our God if he could take a 90 year old
[1:22:29] woman and he could turn it back to a
[1:22:31] young woman that she desires of a king
[1:22:33] what can he do for us manifested Sons
[1:22:36] and Daughters of God filled with the
[1:22:38] Holy Ghost got his life on the inside I
[1:22:40] said I'll watch out Satan we're coming
[1:22:42] for you
[1:22:45] we're coming to take back all that
[1:22:47] belongs to us
[1:22:51] he says when we walk in Christ we have
[1:22:53] spiritual blessings outside of Christ we
[1:22:56] have Sensations I don't want Sensations
[1:22:59] so I like to jump
[1:23:01] I get emotional
[1:23:02] well because I know there's something on
[1:23:04] the inside I heard our prayer Our
[1:23:05] pastoral last life I don't know if any
[1:23:07] of you watched the service but I watched
[1:23:08] it last night he says you know you take
[1:23:10] this Outlet over here that Outlet's got
[1:23:12] power in it
[1:23:13] you don't see that power and you don't
[1:23:16] really feel that power you can plug
[1:23:17] something in it and it Powers it up he
[1:23:19] said but if you ever stick your finger
[1:23:21] in that outlet you will get emotional
[1:23:24] what is it because you were recognize
[1:23:26] that the power from the socket come
[1:23:28] inside of you and let me tell you you

[1:23:36] a hold of you it'll shake you it'll make

[1:25:39] waiting on me I'm getting in position
[1:25:44] oh no to this waiting for the church to
[1:25:46] become in his position who are the sons
[1:25:49] of God when Adam where was his domain it
[1:25:51] was the earth he had domain over the
[1:25:53] Earth is that right he wasn't Lily
[1:25:55] Elohim then he was Jehovah see that is I
[1:25:58] am God I've made some lesson ones under
[1:26:01] me I've given them dominion and in their
[1:26:03] domain the Dominion under them is the
[1:26:06] earth man had dominion over the Earth
[1:26:08] and all the creation is waiting for the
[1:26:10] sons of God to be manifested otherwise
[1:26:13] they're waiting for the sons of God to
[1:26:15] have dominion once again
[1:26:19] to take your position
[1:26:21] in rulership over the Earth
[1:26:24] how about let's start with this Earth
[1:26:27] how about let's bring this Earth under
[1:26:29] subjection
[1:26:31] to the word of God
[1:26:32] bring this Earth show that I am a son by
[1:26:36] bringing this Earth under control not
[1:26:38] just with mouth oh well I'll go to
[1:26:40] brother Tim's church or I believe God
[1:26:42] sent a prophet and yet this Earth
[1:26:44] doesn't line up with this message I'm
[1:26:46] talking about this Earth this mess is
[1:26:48] all lining up together said Clarity yes
[1:26:51] I am a son and daughter of God because
[1:26:54] my life lines up with it and not only my
[1:26:57] life lines up with the word but his
[1:26:59] spirit is Flowing out of my life and
[1:27:02] it's manifesting itself declaring that
[1:27:05] yes I am in fact a son and daughter of
[1:27:08] God
[1:27:10] is that okay this morning notice God is
[1:27:12] trying to place his church in position
[1:27:14] to manifest himself
[1:27:19] God is trying to place his church in
[1:27:22] position to manifest himself getting one
[1:27:25] that he can work through like this and
[1:27:28] say there's my spirit flowing freely
[1:27:32] and we got churches today they want to
[1:27:34] throw off on our church and they want to
[1:27:36] criticize because we are free because we
[1:27:38] invite him
[1:27:40] to have rulership and Dominion to flow
[1:27:43] freely
[1:27:44] and I'm not going to get into that this
[1:27:46] morning but notice he says he wants to
[1:27:49] be in a place where his Spirit can move
[1:27:51] freely he says how do you judge him by
[1:27:53] the way that he stays with the word
[1:27:54] write with the word that shows that you
[1:27:58] know all men is by the way that he stays
[1:28:00] with word if they speak not according to
[1:28:02] the word then there's no life in them
[1:28:04] says the Bible lead them away
[1:28:08] he says now tell me my brother
[1:28:10] tell me my sister when will was there a
[1:28:14] time that the sons of God was ever to be
[1:28:16] manifested outside of this time now
[1:28:19] adoption series four part four
[1:28:22] when were there ever a time in history
[1:28:24] that that manifest the time to deliver
[1:28:27] all nature the nature itself is groaning
[1:28:30] waiting for the time of the
[1:28:32] manifestation why before the atonement
[1:28:34] was made before the Holy Ghost was ever
[1:28:36] poured out before all the Old Testament
[1:28:39] on down there there couldn't have been a
[1:28:41] manifestation it had to wait till this
[1:28:44] time
[1:28:45] see now all things have been brought
[1:28:48] coming shaping up to this headstone to
[1:28:51] the manifestation of the sons of God
[1:28:53] coming back and the spirit of God coming
[1:28:55] into these men so perfectly until their
[1:28:59] ministry will be so close like Christ
[1:29:01] till it would join him in the church
[1:29:04] together
[1:29:07] their Ministry in the ministry of Christ
[1:29:10] will be so close together
[1:29:13] because why because they are manifesting
[1:29:16] him
[1:29:18] for he opened blinded eyes they opened
[1:29:21] blinded eyes for he healed the lame they
[1:29:23] healed the lane where he raised it in
[1:29:25] they raised it he's talking about
[1:29:26] raising it yeah out of your dead dark
[1:29:28] denominational views
[1:29:30] you have come to life
[1:29:33] you don't think Jesus got excited about
[1:29:35] his word
[1:29:37] and that's where we get excited they
[1:29:39] showed through David's life when David
[1:29:41] saw the Ark of the Covenant coming home
[1:29:43] he didn't just sit there and look at it
[1:29:45] like a wart on a pickle I'll puckered up
[1:29:48] as we spoke about the other night no
[1:29:50] David was excited the word is coming
[1:29:53] back to his rightful position and I'm
[1:29:55] telling you Sons and Daughters of God
[1:29:57] the word has returned and we are the
[1:29:59] people now that we welcome the return of
[1:30:02] the word that should do something for us
[1:30:04] I'm not telling you to jump up and down
[1:30:05] and bubble the head but I'm telling you
[1:30:07] it should excite you something should
[1:30:09] excite you because why the same Ministry
[1:30:11] of Christ and he said David is a man
[1:30:14] after my own heart so God saw him David
[1:30:16] if he could have responded God would
[1:30:18] have jumped he would have shout why
[1:30:20] because the word was coming back to a
[1:30:22] people the place the people in their
[1:30:25] Homeland and I'm telling you we are here
[1:30:27] there's a people in the land today
[1:30:28] that's been positionally placed back in
[1:30:31] the homeland of the word of God no more
[1:30:33] denominational views no more man-made
[1:30:35] ideas no more traits being handed down
[1:30:38] and traditions being had now we are back
[1:30:40] home church we are the people of the
[1:30:43] open book we are the people of the
[1:30:45] promised land we are the people that are
[1:30:47] manifesting sonship
[1:30:53] the time is now
[1:30:56] we're not waiting on it
[1:30:58] I'm not looking for another special
[1:30:59] meeting to come so I can get in my
[1:31:01] sonship so I can get in my position
[1:31:04] no the time is now now all things have
[1:31:07] been brought coming shaping up to the
[1:31:09] headstone to the manifestation of the
[1:31:11] sons of God coming back and the spirit
[1:31:13] of God coming into these men so
[1:31:16] perfectly
[1:31:18] until their ministry will be so close
[1:31:21] like Christ
[1:31:23] notice so close like Christ that it'll
[1:31:26] join them together join him in the
[1:31:29] church together see all the creation
[1:31:32] has been waiting
[1:31:34] for the seventh angel
[1:31:36] they've been waiting on him to come and
[1:31:39] take the Loose Ends and tie it all
[1:31:41] together
[1:31:42] because it's been prophesied
[1:31:44] in the days of The Voice
[1:31:47] oh that's not tomorrow
[1:31:50] that's not next year that's not another
[1:31:52] messenger coming it's our day
[1:31:55] that voice had already spoke now we are
[1:31:58] the Fulfillment John take the book John
[1:32:01] eat the book John digest the book John
[1:32:04] and prophesy again John
[1:32:07] John the type of the Bride who is now
[1:32:10] coming to position
[1:32:15] see the book's not going to stay in his
[1:32:16] hands for there's going to be a people
[1:32:18] that's going to be a match piece
[1:32:21] so what was in that book is now in them
[1:32:23] and what was on his lips is now on
[1:32:25] theirs
[1:32:26] notice now all the creation been waiting
[1:32:28] until man will start displaying the
[1:32:31] attributes that God placed there before
[1:32:33] the foundation of the world
[1:32:35] some of you will cry some of you will
[1:32:37] shout some of you will scream some of
[1:32:39] you will dance some of you won't do
[1:32:40] nothing
[1:32:43] but God still placed attributes of
[1:32:45] himself on the inside and whatever those
[1:32:47] attributes are they're going to manifest
[1:32:50] now I got a son over here tall well I'll
[1:32:53] say taller not a really a tall family
[1:32:55] are we stand up Joseph
[1:32:58] he's about five foot nine
[1:33:00] okay five foot eight
[1:33:03] there you go
[1:33:05] I went to the doctor the other day I've
[1:33:07] been swearing I've been five foot six
[1:33:08] and a half for 20 plus years or actually
[1:33:11] long run out of 48 so probably about 30
[1:33:14] years I've been five foot six and a half
[1:33:16] I got my bubble deflate this little
[1:33:18] nurse come over there and she said get
[1:33:20] on the scale I'm like you're really
[1:33:21] gonna weigh me she said I got to that
[1:33:23] wasn't so bad brother Mike I'm not that
[1:33:25] bad but when I she measured my height
[1:33:26] five foot five and a half
[1:33:30] I'm like no that ain't right she said
[1:33:32] look it's right but I'm gonna put you
[1:33:34] down for five six I said you got it
[1:33:38] said you made my day I said I've been
[1:33:40] going all this time through my life
[1:33:41] thinking I was five foot six and a half
[1:33:43] you cheated me by a whole winch well at
[1:33:45] least she gave me a half an inch back
[1:33:46] but this is my son we don't look alike
[1:33:49] he's good looking
[1:33:51] got beautiful blonde hair
[1:33:53] I got none
[1:33:55] he's got big muscles modern failing me
[1:33:58] and you look at us and you may not you
[1:34:00] can sit down you may not see the
[1:34:02] attributes of the father inside the sun
[1:34:06] because maybe we don't look exactly
[1:34:08] alike but if you get close enough to us
[1:34:10] and you're around us you'll see some of
[1:34:13] the same attributes that I possess begin
[1:34:16] to flow out through his life now y'all
[1:34:19] know my daughter Rebecca everybody knows
[1:34:20] Rebecca she's a little Joe Adams right
[1:34:22] because the very same nature the very
[1:34:24] same Spirit almost inside of me is
[1:34:27] inside of her and she's a little fiery
[1:34:30] thing I mean she gives everything she
[1:34:32] got why because it's not about
[1:34:33] impersonation it's about something on
[1:34:36] the inside now manifesting what's always
[1:34:39] been there and it's pointing back that's
[1:34:41] Joe's son that's Joe's daughter and what
[1:34:44] does the father saying when you begin to
[1:34:46] manifest those attributes you're not
[1:34:48] some Son of some denomination but no
[1:34:51] that's my son that's my attribute that's
[1:34:54] my daughter because the very attributes
[1:34:56] on the inside begin the flow out they
[1:34:59] take the word they hang on to the word
[1:35:01] they say Amen to the word that's not
[1:35:03] about the truth what are they doing
[1:35:06] they're reflecting the attributes of the
[1:35:09] father
[1:35:11] see there's people today they can
[1:35:13] impersonate
[1:35:15] we know Andrew Glover if you ever been
[1:35:16] around Andrew he's very good him
[1:35:18] impersonation
[1:35:22] Andrew's good
[1:35:24] some people have it I don't have it my
[1:35:26] son's pretty good at it but he can
[1:35:28] impersonate voices
[1:35:30] but you take people they can learn how
[1:35:33] somebody articulates a word or how they
[1:35:35] drag out a word or maybe they they learn
[1:35:38] how to do the hand motions
[1:35:41] and how they jump you know
[1:35:43] had to be anointed to do that more I
[1:35:44] said watch it
[1:35:46] don't do all that dancing on that
[1:35:48] platform
[1:35:49] but you find they can just impersonate
[1:35:51] because they study the life they study
[1:35:53] how they they articulate and how they
[1:35:55] move and how their mannerisms but I'm
[1:35:58] not talking about impersonation because
[1:36:00] see that impersonation is only a fake
[1:36:02] replica replication of that person but
[1:36:05] you take somebody that's born again
[1:36:06] who's born of The Same Spirit it ain't
[1:36:09] something that's got to be trained it
[1:36:11] ain't something got to be studied it
[1:36:12] ain't something that's got to be taught
[1:36:13] no it come down freely because it's
[1:36:16] always what's in there it always was it
[1:36:19] always will be and let me tell you on
[1:36:21] the right atmosphere under the right
[1:36:23] anointing it begins to show itself and
[1:36:26] you can declare there's a manifested son
[1:36:28] there's a Manifesto daughter what is it
[1:36:31] it's about manifesting sonship
[1:36:36] how can we take a young Mariah Pruitt
[1:36:38] who lost all our hair without alopecia
[1:36:41] and she'd come in a prayer line and she
[1:36:43] brought some bobby pins and said when I
[1:36:44] come through the other side I'm gonna
[1:36:46] put these back in my hair what was that
[1:36:48] she was manifesting something that was
[1:36:51] already there it was a promise of
[1:36:53] restoration and God restored her glory
[1:36:56] what am I telling he wouldn't sit and
[1:36:58] train it she didn't put a wig on and
[1:37:00] make it up no God began to restore and
[1:37:03] what am I telling you the same
[1:37:04] attribution the father is in you this
[1:37:07] morning that's
[1:37:17] you ain't gotta work it up it's going to
[1:37:20] work itself out
[1:37:21] it's going to come out freely
[1:37:23] what's in you will come out of you
[1:37:27] if all you could think about is the
[1:37:29] world the things of the world and
[1:37:30] pornography and bitterness and
[1:37:33] hatefulness and grudges that's just
[1:37:34] going to flow out oh but if you ever
[1:37:37] become a manifested son there'll be
[1:37:39] peace in the valley there'll be joy
[1:37:42] unspeakable and full of Glory every
[1:37:43] healing they'll be Deliverance they'll
[1:37:45] be the manifestations of the word of God
[1:37:47] you won't put it back but someday gone
[1:37:49] by no he said you can lay hands on the
[1:37:51] sick and they shall recover
[1:37:54] you can cast out Devils you can speak
[1:37:57] with new tongues we can have the
[1:37:58] manifestation of the nine gifts of God
[1:38:00] in the church and he said they should be
[1:38:03] in operation in every local assembly
[1:38:06] but people today want to put them back
[1:38:09] we don't need that anymore we got the
[1:38:10] revealed word
[1:38:12] it must not be too revealed
[1:38:15] if you can't even keep the Simplicity of
[1:38:17] it
[1:38:19] let me move on notice manifest of sons
[1:38:22] manifesting the attributes of the father
[1:38:24] his life his word his attributes his
[1:38:26] glory his person The Works that he did
[1:38:28] we do
[1:38:30] well you're just trying to be brother no
[1:38:32] I'm just trying to be God
[1:38:33] that's what I'm called to be to manifest
[1:38:35] him and what he did I can do
[1:38:39] it's a supernatural that he displays you
[1:38:42] can display
[1:38:44] he healed the sick we can heal the sick
[1:38:47] he casts out Devils we can cast out
[1:38:49] devils see we're waiting waiting for the
[1:38:52] time that Fallen man filled with the
[1:38:55] spirit of God will again we'll begin to
[1:38:58] manifest
[1:38:59] the authority over the enemy
[1:39:02] that's what he's been waiting on
[1:39:04] and when he gets that bride ready and
[1:39:06] she's completely in one mind as brother
[1:39:09] Aaron taught one Accord one purpose One
[1:39:12] Vision singleness of heart God's gonna

[1:39:32] service is over we got a promise we got
[1:39:35] something to look to what is it the word
[1:39:37] being restored we know what to look
[1:39:39] forward to in the moment in the
[1:39:41] twinkling of an eye oh we're gonna be
[1:39:43] changed oh let me tell you see it's got
[1:39:45] to take his hole it can't hold you any
[1:39:47] longer all the depression and all the
[1:39:49] anxiety and all the frustrations of the
[1:39:51] world they can't hold you any longer
[1:39:53] while we're Sons and Daughters of God
[1:39:55] manifesting his word
[1:40:00] notice we're not to manifest our own
[1:40:02] ideas
[1:40:03] but we're to manifest his word his
[1:40:06] attributes his purpose his plan
[1:40:09] that's what we're an attribute notice in
[1:40:11] Mark 16 and verse 17.
[1:40:20] the Bible says in these signs
[1:40:22] shall follow them that believe now
[1:40:24] brother Brown didn't say that
[1:40:26] but Jesus did
[1:40:28] so Jesus is telling us giving us
[1:40:30] something to look forward to this is how
[1:40:33] you will know that they're believers
[1:40:35] notice these signs shall follow them
[1:40:37] that believe in my name they shall cast
[1:40:40] out Devils they should speak with new
[1:40:41] tongues on and on and on and the word
[1:40:43] signs here is Miracles and Wonders by
[1:40:45] which God authenticates the men sent by
[1:40:48] him
[1:40:49] and also it's it's by which men proved
[1:40:52] that the cause that they are pleading is
[1:40:54] God see it's going both ways
[1:40:58] signs follow Miracles and wonders follow
[1:41:00] them it declares that hey this man is
[1:41:02] sent by God but is also declaring that
[1:41:04] that man is declaring that God's word is
[1:41:06] truth
[1:41:07] and this is what happens when you
[1:41:09] believe and program says this in the
[1:41:11] message the unchangeable word of God how
[1:41:13] many believe that his word is
[1:41:14] unchangeable the Bible says these signs
[1:41:17] these signs shall follow them that
[1:41:19] believe God makes a distinction he gives
[1:41:22] a mark on the people if he believe
[1:41:24] notice now if he believes then these
[1:41:27] signs shall follow them that believe
[1:41:29] that's right the believer not they that
[1:41:32] they say they believe or not those that
[1:41:33] suppose that they believe but the real
[1:41:35] believer and he says I want to belong to
[1:41:39] a church that's got them signs and
[1:41:41] wonders following it
[1:41:44] oh that takes all the skepticism out of
[1:41:46] those that don't want the signs and
[1:41:48] wonders they don't want the supernatural
[1:41:50] in their men but your Prophet did
[1:41:53] I want to belong to a church that's got
[1:41:55] them signs and wonders following that's
[1:41:57] where I want to have my fellowship right
[1:41:59] under the blood of Jesus Where Angels
[1:42:02] and powers and the Holy Ghost and God
[1:42:04] works back and forth through his church
[1:42:05] through his people showing signs and
[1:42:08] wonders
[1:42:10] he goes I think for me this is another
[1:42:11] message it wasn't so from the beginning
[1:42:13] I think that for me I want to worship
[1:42:15] and to worship with a church who
[1:42:18] believes the Full Gospel and preaches
[1:42:20] every word of it and practices every
[1:42:23] word of it
[1:42:26] go back to the Full Gospel back to the
[1:42:28] power of God back to the Holy Ghost back
[1:42:30] to the beginning and receive it like
[1:42:31] they did at the beginning
[1:42:34] and he says now and it will bring forth
[1:42:36] the same results that it did in the
[1:42:39] beginning
[1:42:40] because he's not he's unchangeable
[1:42:43] so the way they acted in The Upper Room
[1:42:46] not Azusa we're going to be on Azusa
[1:42:48] for how they acted in the upper room is
[1:42:50] how we're to act
[1:42:53] Mary was up there the mother of Jesus
[1:42:55] she had to come out drunk on the spirit
[1:42:59] well that ain't my nature well it may
[1:43:01] not be your nature but you get drunk one
[1:43:03] time your nature may change it may be
[1:43:05] altered because you come under the
[1:43:06] influence of something greater than you
[1:43:08] in your own mind
[1:43:10] notice what he says today it reminds me
[1:43:13] many get upset by trying to find great
[1:43:16] big places and beautiful pipe organs
[1:43:18] those things are all right but if a
[1:43:19] church has got a million dollar gold
[1:43:21] cross on the top of it it's got a
[1:43:22] million dollar gold organ and in that
[1:43:24] church the Holy Spirit has to ride away
[1:43:26] praise God he goes I like to belong to a
[1:43:28] church like that he goes but I don't
[1:43:30] care what it's got if the Holy Ghost
[1:43:32] isn't there it's no place for me
[1:43:36] see I want to be where they preach it
[1:43:39] like it fell at the beginning
[1:43:41] oh my
[1:43:43] God I want to be there like that brother
[1:43:45] Robin you're welcome to even like
[1:43:46] Tabernacle you're welcome right here
[1:43:48] this morning because we're preaching
[1:43:50] what you preach and you preach what Paul
[1:43:52] preached and you said they can preach it
[1:43:54] you'll be where they preached it like in
[1:43:55] the beginning will come we welcome you
[1:43:57] and even like Tabernacle we welcome you
[1:43:59] to come and change Hearts we welcome you
[1:44:01] to change look church we don't have our
[1:44:03] own messes we are preaching the message
[1:44:05] of Malachi 4. we are preaching a message
[1:44:07] of Revelations 10 7 and 8. we are
[1:44:09] preaching this word and this word is the
[1:44:12] Vindicated truth
[1:44:14] notice what he says I don't care what is
[1:44:16] God if it's got the Holy Ghost if the
[1:44:18] Holy Ghost is that there it's not a
[1:44:20] place for me I want to be where they
[1:44:22] preach it like a fellow at the beginning
[1:44:23] that's where I know that they got it at
[1:44:25] the beginning that's the only thing I
[1:44:27] know about the word goes back to the
[1:44:29] beginning he says God's infinite he
[1:44:32] cannot change man changes time changes
[1:44:34] Kingdom changes worlds changes churches
[1:44:36] change but Christ Remains the same
[1:44:38] yesterday today and forever he can never
[1:44:40] change he's just like that as he was at
[1:44:42] the beginning and the same holy ghost
[1:44:44] that fell on the day of Pentecost is the
[1:44:47] same Holy Ghost of today
[1:44:49] Henry says now this is in 1954 he goes
[1:44:52] and I'll admit it it's been trampled on
[1:44:53] it's been made fun of it's been
[1:44:55] misinterpreted misrepresented and
[1:44:57] everything else like that he goes That's
[1:44:59] the only the devil counterfeiting but
[1:45:01] there is a real genuine baptism of the
[1:45:03] Holy Ghost that brings the same results
[1:45:06] that they had at the day of Pentecost
[1:45:09] brings the same results
[1:45:13] he said Martin Luther had mechanics and
[1:45:16] Dynamics
[1:45:17] John Wesley had them in his day
[1:45:20] Pentecostal had him with their day but
[1:45:22] what about our day
[1:45:24] oh we got the mechanics man we got the
[1:45:26] word nobody's had the word like we've
[1:45:28] had the word
[1:45:29] but there's more to just the word than
[1:45:31] just the word
[1:45:33] because the letter killeth but the
[1:45:35] spirit is what gives life to the word
[1:45:38] notice what he says and I bring this all
[1:45:40] through the message
[1:45:41] so I don't think I'm coming up with my
[1:45:43] own ideas this morning my brother Tim's
[1:45:44] idea or some of these men who are who
[1:45:46] are you know preaching like this but
[1:45:48] this is what the prophet thought this is
[1:45:50] what God thought about it and he says
[1:45:52] now what about our day this is another
[1:45:54] time the church should be fully grown
[1:45:56] now ready to meet Christ
[1:45:59] God has sent back the Holy Spirit which
[1:46:01] is Jesus Christ which is the same
[1:46:03] yesterday today and forever then he is
[1:46:06] still the same messiah in the Life of
[1:46:07] Christ is in the church vindicating his
[1:46:10] word that that's how God was in the
[1:46:13] earth in the form of Jesus being the
[1:46:15] word to make the word live
[1:46:18] and the Holy Spirit is today in flesh
[1:46:21] making the word live
[1:46:23] in every promise and every Wonder
[1:46:27] see that great Jehovah God that created
[1:46:29] all things brought himself down to live
[1:46:31] in the heart of you and I
[1:46:35] great Jehovah God
[1:46:37] stepped out of Glory came down
[1:46:40] took on the form of sinful flesh paid
[1:46:42] the price of redemption pay for your
[1:46:45] inheritance came down so that you can
[1:46:47] have his spirit
[1:46:49] so that you can be a manifested son and
[1:46:51] daughter of God
[1:46:53] he said the gospel is not all together
[1:46:55] by the word the word was made manifest
[1:46:58] that's the gospel the gospel came not in
[1:47:01] word only but through Power and
[1:47:03] demonstration of the Holy Spirit go into
[1:47:05] all the world and demonstrate the power
[1:47:08] how do you know that that man is sent
[1:47:10] from God because the word that he's
[1:47:13] preaching is being Vindicated it's
[1:47:15] declaring that what he is speaking is
[1:47:17] the truth because the signs the Miracles
[1:47:20] the Wonders are following after his
[1:47:22] ministry
[1:47:24] it declares whether you're a Believer or
[1:47:26] not here today
[1:47:27] because you're believing for the
[1:47:28] supernatural how does sister Atlanta all
[1:47:31] of a sudden one day in the back leaning
[1:47:32] on the Everlasting arm jump up out of
[1:47:34] the Pew back there and begin to run
[1:47:36] around and run it showed that she was a
[1:47:39] believer in the Supernatural ability of
[1:47:41] God to take cancer from her Satan put a
[1:47:44] death sentence on her but God took it
[1:47:46] away and God showed that through a sorry
[1:47:49] daughter of God he was going to manifest
[1:47:51] his word that not even cancer would
[1:47:54] stand before your prayer let me tell you
[1:47:56] even like Tabernacle we believe the
[1:47:58] power of God we believe the anointing of
[1:48:00] the Holy Spirit we have seen witness
[1:48:02] after witness after witness let me tell
[1:48:05] you what more does God's got to do to
[1:48:07] shake us we are the supernatural power
[1:48:09] of God we are the people that are
[1:48:11] manifesting this word
[1:48:14] if other churches don't want to manifest
[1:48:16] it God give it to us let us be the
[1:48:18] Fulfillment this morning
[1:48:22] I'm not here to kick any other Church
[1:48:23] down but let me tell you I'm not going
[1:48:25] to look at them and say it ain't for me
[1:48:26] let me tell you you don't want to
[1:48:28] believe in it that's fine with you and
[1:48:29] your congregation but for me and my
[1:48:31] church for me and my family we're gonna
[1:48:33] take God in his word we're gonna believe
[1:48:35] this message we're going to believe for
[1:48:37] the supernatural we're going to believe
[1:48:38] for a body tank we're going to believe
[1:48:40] when we lay hands on the sea that they
[1:48:42] shall recover we're gonna believe it why
[1:48:45] because we witness it time and time and
[1:48:48] time again
[1:48:50] police ain't hair restored we've seen
[1:48:52] osworth's story we see cancer leaves we
[1:48:55] have seen the manifestation of the sons
[1:48:57] of God those that declare this is who he
[1:49:01] is
[1:49:02] we're not waiting on it it's here
[1:49:09] Philbin says now
[1:49:11] and the gospel is not all together by
[1:49:13] the word the word was made manifest is
[1:49:15] the gospel the gospel come not in the
[1:49:18] word only but through Power and
[1:49:19] demonstration of the Holy Ghost go into
[1:49:21] all the world and demonstrate the power
[1:49:23] of the Holy Spirit to All Nations now
[1:49:26] instead of that
[1:49:28] we begin to teach theology
[1:49:33] we begin to see God doesn't want
[1:49:35] believers to merely teach theology
[1:49:39] but those that are to believe or to to
[1:49:41] believe that the word that has been
[1:49:43] spoken will be made manifest
[1:49:48] that we can still have altar calls and
[1:49:51] young people
[1:49:52] not just young people but even those
[1:49:54] that have needs can meet God at the
[1:49:56] altar and have their needs met
[1:49:59] it was at an altar when my
[1:50:01] daughter-in-law when I was preaching a
[1:50:02] youth service there in in Pony Oklahoma
[1:50:04] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:50:06] what if she was not given that altar
[1:50:10] what if she wasn't given that
[1:50:11] opportunity but see there's still men
[1:50:14] that preach you can have an altar call
[1:50:15] experience God's still casting this
[1:50:17] saying for the sheep saying and for the
[1:50:20] fish saying it for those predestinated
[1:50:22] ones
[1:50:24] what about those that come into a prayer
[1:50:26] line
[1:50:28] and they know they come through there
[1:50:29] with some kind of faith that when they
[1:50:31] get to the other side their promises
[1:50:34] waiting on them
[1:50:35] you know brother man preaches a message
[1:50:36] and he brings up this young boy who had
[1:50:38] polio and he said you know he they try
[1:50:41] to get him on the uh to get them to the
[1:50:42] prayer line and he couldn't get there he
[1:50:43] could never get it but he said that this
[1:50:45] young boy finally they put him on the
[1:50:47] platform and brother Brown had a chance
[1:50:48] to talk to him and he says brother Brown
[1:50:50] he says do you got a word for me he says
[1:50:51] yeah this is this what happened to you
[1:50:53] he said yeah that's right he said you
[1:50:54] know you got Paul little said yeah
[1:50:55] that's right he says what about my
[1:50:57] healing he says by his stripes you are
[1:50:58] healed he didn't see a vision of him he
[1:51:01] didn't declare this he said only what he
[1:51:03] did he he recited the word by his
[1:51:07] stripes you are here and that young boy
[1:51:09] stricken with polio in a wheelchair he
[1:51:12] went back home and he began to confess
[1:51:13] by his stripes I am he wasn't
[1:51:16] manifesting the the preacher's word he
[1:51:18] wasn't manifest in a prophet's word he
[1:51:20] was manifesting God's work and a group
[1:51:22] of preachers came down there and said
[1:51:24] you're causing over approach he said let
[1:51:27] me tell you she goes if you were sitting
[1:51:28] where I'm sitting if you was in the
[1:51:30] chair that I'm in would you try to rob
[1:51:32] me of my only hope let me tell you
[1:51:34] church this is the only hope of the
[1:51:36] Bride is preaching the power he's
[1:51:39] preaching a supernatural he's teaching
[1:51:41] the anointing of the Holy Ghost why do
[1:51:44] we want to rob it why do we want a
[1:51:46] stupid from the people you may have an
[1:51:48] author call experience this morning you
[1:51:50] may have hands laid upon you and God
[1:51:52] meet you why would you take that strip
[1:51:54] it from the people
[1:51:56] don't Rob the mother only hope
[1:52:03] he goes bro bam says now
[1:52:06] and I'm trying to wrap this up but I'm
[1:52:08] going to keep on preaching because we
[1:52:09] ain't got for one service a day
[1:52:12] he goes we have so much of the mechanics
[1:52:14] and not the Dynamics
[1:52:17] this is after the opening of the seals
[1:52:20] so just cool your jets it's all good
[1:52:24] signs of this time 1963 November 13th
[1:52:27] now my body is a mechanics but my body
[1:52:30] will not operate without the Dynamics of
[1:52:33] the spirit now how many of you ever woke
[1:52:35] up and you just lethargic
[1:52:38] sluggish can't hardly move come on come
[1:52:40] on somebody you old people raise your
[1:52:42] hand
[1:52:44] if ain't nobody ever felt lethargic you
[1:52:46] know when you get older boy this body
[1:52:47] starts dragging you can't hardly make I
[1:52:50] tell my wife all week man I'm tired I'm
[1:52:52] tired she goes man what's wrong with you
[1:52:54] you got coping I said I don't know but
[1:52:55] I'm tired
[1:53:00] what are we fine here see that's just my
[1:53:02] body that's just the mechanics but there
[1:53:04] has to be a spirit that will come and
[1:53:07] anoint the mechanics and raise that body
[1:53:09] off the bed or raise that body off the
[1:53:12] couch or raise that body out of the
[1:53:14] chair and get that body to function the
[1:53:16] way that that body was supposed to
[1:53:18] function let me say we've got so much on
[1:53:20] the mechanics the mechanics the
[1:53:22] mechanics the word the word the word the
[1:53:24] word the Brian knows what he wants done
[1:53:26] with the word yeah she won't he wants
[1:53:28] the spirit to anoint that word to make
[1:53:30] that word live that's what the bride
[1:53:32] knows that's what the bride expects
[1:53:34] that's what God is doing he's
[1:53:36] manifesting himself through a bride that
[1:53:38] knows what he wants done with the word
[1:53:41] he says now my spirit operates my body
[1:53:44] brings it into control he goes like an
[1:53:46] automobile with no gasoline in it man
[1:53:49] with no fire and power no matter how
[1:53:51] many how I find the Dynamics or the
[1:53:53] mechanics is fixed up the cylinders the
[1:53:55] points the plugs whatever more it's got
[1:53:58] to have a current you've got to take
[1:54:00] those together
[1:54:02] so you got to take the mechanics and you
[1:54:04] got to take the Dynamics
[1:54:06] and you got to marry them two together
[1:54:09] and when you put the two together
[1:54:11] oh my you give a good crank on it's
[1:54:14] going to fire up may there be hands
[1:54:16] being clapped amens being shouted
[1:54:18] somebody May stand to their feet oh I
[1:54:21] heard the other day and Wednesday night
[1:54:22] service poor little sister said oh I
[1:54:24] wish somebody would have stood up she
[1:54:25] was I felt like running around what was
[1:54:27] there was a spark hitting the gasoline
[1:54:29] that was on the inside something was
[1:54:32] igniting on me inside let me tell you
[1:54:34] that's what happens when the spirit
[1:54:35] comes to the mechanics
[1:54:39] he said unto the church becomes both
[1:54:41] Dynamics and mechanics and the spirit of
[1:54:43] God that moved him through the things
[1:54:45] that he did if he hit on 16 cylinders so
[1:54:49] will the bride
[1:54:50] for he said in John 14 12 he that
[1:54:52] believeth on me in the works that I do
[1:54:53] shall he do also see I'll give him
[1:54:57] charge of my Dynamics in his mechanics
[1:55:00] that's the world will not be able to
[1:55:02] withstand that it'll raise him up in the
[1:55:04] last day see the mechanics without
[1:55:06] Dynamics is no good and neither is the
[1:55:08] Dynamics well that's mechanic he said
[1:55:10] you can scream jump up and down all you
[1:55:12] want to but if you deny the word it
[1:55:14] won't do you any good
[1:55:16] you scream jump shout and all that but
[1:55:18] you you got all the spark but you ain't
[1:55:20] got no gasoline
[1:55:22] he goes it only works as they come
[1:55:25] together if you just want if you just
[1:55:28] won't move no matter how good the
[1:55:29] mechanics is until the Dynamics come
[1:55:32] when the Dynamics come that's fire is
[1:55:34] made to connect with the octane in the
[1:55:36] gasoline and when that explodes it
[1:55:39] causes a combustion and that combustion
[1:55:41] moves every motion
[1:55:44] well why do you jump I guess I got lit
[1:55:48] why do you save it I guess there's a
[1:55:50] spark on the inside some of y'all see me
[1:55:52] when I fly out of that chair
[1:55:54] man I'll tell you it's just something
[1:55:56] I'm thinking man you look stupid but it
[1:55:57] don't matter it's just flying out why
[1:56:00] because the spark is hitting the
[1:56:01] mechanic because the word is there the
[1:56:04] word is being preached but not only is
[1:56:05] the word being preached there's a spirit
[1:56:07] that comes out and anoints the word and
[1:56:09] I can't stay in my seat I jump up like
[1:56:12] popcorn like oh hallelujah it's here
[1:56:15] he's here what the spirit anointing the
[1:56:18] word and making the word live make it a
[1:56:21] word say yes that's nothing but the
[1:56:23] truth
[1:56:25] and if they could do it for me it can do
[1:56:27] it for you if it can do it for Hattie
[1:56:29] right he could do it for you this
[1:56:30] morning he can do it for your kids he
[1:56:32] can do for your son he can do it for
[1:56:34] your daughter he can do it for your
[1:56:36] loved one he's still the same God
[1:56:39] and he's still manifesting himself
[1:56:44] notice now
[1:56:48] First Corinthians 12 and verse 25.
[1:56:51] he said there should be no schism
[1:56:54] in the body
[1:56:55] but that the members should have the
[1:56:57] same care one for another
[1:57:00] and whether one member suffer all
[1:57:02] members suffer with it if one remember
[1:57:04] be honored then all members Rejoice with
[1:57:06] him
[1:57:07] now you are the body
[1:57:10] you are the body
[1:57:12] and the members in particular
[1:57:14] and God had sent
[1:57:16] some in the church notice what he placed
[1:57:18] in the church
[1:57:19] he plays first apostles
[1:57:22] secondarily prophets thoroughly teachers
[1:57:25] Miracles then Gifts of healings helps
[1:57:27] governments diversities of tongue then
[1:57:29] we find in Ephesians 4 and verse 11 he
[1:57:32] gave some Apostles some prophets some
[1:57:35] evangelists some pastors some teachers
[1:57:37] for the perfecting
[1:57:40] to bring the church to manifestation for
[1:57:43] the perfecting of the of the Saints for
[1:57:46] the work of the ministry for the
[1:57:48] edifying of the body
[1:57:50] and then the message of this morning
[1:57:52] church age brother Brown says God never
[1:57:54] intended a church to be run by man
[1:57:57] God runs his church he runs it through
[1:57:59] the gifts of the Spirit and the gifts of
[1:58:02] the Spirit is in the church to correct
[1:58:04] the spirit or to correct the spirit he's
[1:58:06] got five ministerial offices in the
[1:58:09] church notice five ministerial offices
[1:58:13] prophets minister teachers ministers
[1:58:17] evangelists ministers pastors ministers
[1:58:20] missionaries ministers all of them are
[1:58:23] ministerial offices
[1:58:26] for for the perfecting or the
[1:58:28] manifestation to bring the church to her
[1:58:31] perfection
[1:58:32] see God placed in there so what we need
[1:58:35] today we need to know any teachers
[1:58:40] come on church we need anointed teachers
[1:58:42] that will teach the hidden Mystery
[1:58:44] truths of this word
[1:58:47] but what we don't need is for those
[1:58:49] teachers to incorporate psychology as a
[1:58:52] replacement
[1:58:53] to the anointing of the Holy Spirit what
[1:58:55] we don't need is for teachers to preach
[1:58:57] at the days of Miracles has passed what
[1:58:59] we don't need is for preachers or
[1:59:00] teachers to say that we don't need an
[1:59:02] altar call experience or we don't need
[1:59:04] prayer lives anymore because we have the
[1:59:06] word
[1:59:07] what we need for teachers to do is teach
[1:59:10] the fundamental truths of this message
[1:59:12] and lay the foundation
[1:59:15] and what we don't need is for evangelist
[1:59:17] to throw darts at those teachers because
[1:59:19] why because they're preaching about
[1:59:21] these things what we need to do is marry
[1:59:23] the three the other five gifts together
[1:59:24] because it's for the perfecting of the
[1:59:26] body look don't get don't disagree with
[1:59:29] me because because you can't in your
[1:59:31] ministry bring the power of God down
[1:59:33] you're not called to do that you're
[1:59:35] called to teach it you're called the
[1:59:37] lady the foundation the Evangelist is
[1:59:39] called this take the mechanic of what
[1:59:41] you've been teaching and marry it up
[1:59:42] with the spirit of God and let the
[1:59:44] spirit of God move in the church and
[1:59:47] perfect the body of Jesus Christ
[1:59:50] but we find today we got teachers we got
[1:59:52] pastors we got preachers and we got
[1:59:54] advantage and we're all fighting one
[1:59:55] another
[1:59:57] and it should never be that way we need
[1:59:59] both mechanics and we need Dynamics
[2:00:02] look I tried to teach my goodness y'all
[2:00:05] see how that works out
[2:00:07] man I wish I could dig deep and find
[2:00:09] those mystery truths but it just ain't
[2:00:10] in me
[2:00:12] but I'm not complaining
[2:00:14] I'm not throwing off and saying we don't
[2:00:16] need teaching we need it the body needs
[2:00:19] it our young people need the foundation
[2:00:22] of this message
[2:00:25] so we need both teaching preaching we
[2:00:28] need Apostles we need pastors we need
[2:00:30] teachers we need it all why because he's
[2:00:32] the same yesterday today and forever
[2:00:35] He's Able today to deliver like he did
[2:00:37] yesterday he's able to heal like he did
[2:00:39] yesterday he's able to save what we
[2:00:41] don't need is just intellectual talks
[2:00:44] Phil Raph says now he says now our
[2:00:46] intellectual talks which is fine but I
[2:00:48] only will he goes I only wish I could do
[2:00:50] that but that ain't what counts from the
[2:00:51] sight of God it's the Holy Spirit God
[2:00:54] never did ordained such he ordained any
[2:00:56] commissioned a church to go and preach
[2:00:58] the gospel and the gospel is not an
[2:01:00] election the gospel came not in word
[2:01:02] only but through Power and demonstration
[2:01:04] manifestations of the Holy Spirit that's
[2:01:07] what brought the gospel
[2:01:09] and that's what we need today
[2:01:11] quit fighting we just need to preach the
[2:01:13] gospel
[2:01:14] you ain't got to believe it if you don't
[2:01:16] want to believe it you can spit the seed
[2:01:17] out if you want to spit the seed out
[2:01:20] but we're going to preach the
[2:01:21] manifestation of the gifts
[2:01:23] we're going to preach the power of the
[2:01:25] Holy Ghost we're going to preach the
[2:01:27] anointing that is to follow the
[2:01:28] Believers signs and wonders the
[2:01:31] miraculous the supernatural will follow
[2:01:33] it's a Vindication it's proof that he's
[2:01:35] here
[2:01:37] can I say it like this you are proof
[2:01:39] that he is here
[2:01:40] because he is manifesting through your
[2:01:42] life through your being in your low
[2:01:44] moments in your dark valleys he's
[2:01:46] manifesting himself the same
[2:01:49] that he's still God
[2:01:51] notice preach the gospel not word only
[2:01:54] but making the word manifest
[2:01:58] well if I said someone said not long ago
[2:01:59] brother Brandon preach the gospel he
[2:02:01] said I do that doctor
[2:02:02] he goes not Divine Healing he said
[2:02:04] preach the word he says well the word is
[2:02:06] what I preach sir he said brother Brown
[2:02:09] he said the gospel is the word of God
[2:02:11] and brother man says I said not all
[2:02:13] together see the Bible said the gospel
[2:02:15] come to us not in word only but through
[2:02:17] Power and demonstration of the Holy
[2:02:19] Ghost to preach the word that letter
[2:02:21] killer but the spirit give his life so
[2:02:23] we want to we want to preach the gospel
[2:02:27] we want to preach it we want to manifest
[2:02:29] it we want to declare that it is the
[2:02:33] same that he is the same we're not we're
[2:02:35] waiting on somebody else to come we are
[2:02:37] here it is here so signs follow signs
[2:02:41] following is the Dynamics of the
[2:02:44] mechanics it is proof that the word
[2:02:47] works
[2:02:48] and brother bam says this he says now
[2:02:50] our ministry has changed it over they
[2:02:52] want to say that there's real believer I
[2:02:54] tell you he loves the Lord he goes to a
[2:02:56] church every Sunday he draws or he pays
[2:02:58] his dues in the church and he treats his
[2:03:00] neighbor right he goes That's Just moral
[2:03:02] acts the holy spirit in the man
[2:03:04] demonstrates the power of the
[2:03:05] supernatural that's what makes him a
[2:03:07] Believer it's God vindicating that he is
[2:03:10] a believer
[2:03:12] and brother Branham was contending for
[2:03:14] the faith that was once delivered
[2:03:18] you see he fought against the Same
[2:03:19] Spirit In which we're fighting against
[2:03:21] today
[2:03:22] Church of Christ spirit says the days of
[2:03:24] Miracles has passed we don't need that
[2:03:26] anymore now we have the word
[2:03:28] he defended and defended and defended
[2:03:30] his stance on Divine Healing on laying
[2:03:33] on the hands on witnessing you know all
[2:03:36] these things brother random defended it
[2:03:38] until his last day his last breath until
[2:03:40] 1965.
[2:03:43] he continued to contend for the faith
[2:03:46] that was once delivered to the Saints
[2:03:49] so notice here
[2:03:51] we're waiting for the fullness of
[2:03:54] adoption
[2:03:55] for the fullness of the manifestation
[2:03:57] that's when our bodies will be changed
[2:03:59] from these vowel creatures that we are
[2:04:00] and we'll have a body like his own
[2:04:02] glorious body
[2:04:04] for we shall see him like he is we shall
[2:04:06] be like him when he appears we appear in
[2:04:09] his likeness
[2:04:10] we will have a body like his a glorious
[2:04:13] body all the trials and struggles of
[2:04:15] life will fade off
[2:04:16] in the in the least Miss in the blow
[2:04:19] away to to be no more he goes Earthly
[2:04:22] Tabernacles were are now groaning
[2:04:24] waiting for the earnest the earnest for
[2:04:26] the Salvation fooling for the fullness
[2:04:29] to come he says what is the earnest it's
[2:04:31] a little down payment that holds it
[2:04:34] and we have the earnest the holy spirit
[2:04:36] is declaring that there's more to come
[2:04:39] is to claim that now that you have
[2:04:41] authority over sinful Humanity but one
[2:04:43] day you're going to have complete
[2:04:44] dominion over this body because this
[2:04:47] body will be redeemed and no longer in a
[2:04:50] sinful condition notice he says I don't
[2:04:52] condemn good looks I don't condemn their
[2:04:54] hospitals good things they do I think
[2:04:56] that that's wonderful God's blessing to
[2:04:58] the poor suffering Humanity I don't
[2:05:00] condemn all these other things they're
[2:05:01] doing fine that's just right they're
[2:05:03] just great organizations and millions
[2:05:04] and millions of dollars he goes I sure
[2:05:06] had that rather than them bootleg joints
[2:05:08] in the corner anytime I certainly honor
[2:05:10] them as Minister standing in the Pulpit
[2:05:12] but when it comes to gathering together
[2:05:13] at the end of the dispensation it'll be
[2:05:16] waiting for the manifestation of the
[2:05:18] sons of God in that dispensation
[2:05:22] so we have attained an inheritance
[2:05:23] Church
[2:05:25] what is the inheritance
[2:05:27] he believes says what is an inheritance
[2:05:29] he says somebody has to leave you
[2:05:30] something so we have obtained an
[2:05:32] inheritance and how do we get it by
[2:05:34] predestination what is the inheritance
[2:05:36] it's a new body
[2:05:39] it's a new body
[2:05:41] suffering Humanity will suffer no more
[2:05:43] decay in humanity will Decay no more a
[2:05:46] new body the body by which God intended
[2:05:48] you to come with in the beginning
[2:05:50] we're going back to that body
[2:05:54] back to the manifestation of the sons of
[2:05:57] God he says inheritance by
[2:05:59] predestination I inherited something
[2:06:01] what is inheritance there had to be
[2:06:02] somebody to leave me an inheritance why
[2:06:04] you say Jesus left you an inheritance I
[2:06:07] beg your pardon Jesus never left me and
[2:06:08] inherited Jesus never left you an
[2:06:10] inheritance he only came down and paid
[2:06:12] for your inheritance brought you to
[2:06:14] brought you to your inheritance he put
[2:06:16] your name on the Lamb's Book of Life
[2:06:18] before the foundation of the world and
[2:06:20] give you your inheritance
[2:06:23] see God chose us
[2:06:25] he goes That's our inheritance God chose
[2:06:28] us
[2:06:30] that makes the ugly day look much better
[2:06:33] I got an inheritance you may have looked
[2:06:36] in the mirror this morning all
[2:06:37] disappointed but man when you realize
[2:06:39] God chose me that's my inheritance that
[2:06:41] means I'm not going to a devil's hell
[2:06:43] I'm not going to a sinner's grave I got
[2:06:45] a promise that I'm going to step over a
[2:06:47] body I'm gonna step into a new body oh
[2:06:50] Church no matter how bad it gets how
[2:06:51] about how low we get we got a promise
[2:06:53] that there's a new day coming why
[2:06:55] because we're here to manifest Sons and
[2:06:58] Daughters of God and he says I am the
[2:07:00] vine and you are the branches
[2:07:03] I'm Divine and you are the branch he
[2:07:05] that abideth and me and I and him the
[2:07:07] same bringeth much more or bringeth
[2:07:09] forth much fruitful without me you can
[2:07:11] do nothing and the message blind bought
[2:07:13] a mess he said Jesus Christ is the same
[2:07:15] yesterday today and forever he's got to
[2:07:19] be the same in principle the same in
[2:07:21] power the same in every way only in the
[2:07:24] Corporal body and he's using us
[2:07:28] oh he's the same in every detail brother
[2:07:32] Derek every detail except the Corporal
[2:07:36] body and he's using us
[2:07:40] wipe the frown off your faith us

[2:07:46] son Jesus the Same Spirit the same
[2:07:49] anointing the same power the same
[2:07:52] Authority everything the same only the
[2:07:55] body is different

[2:08:01] any hands but your hands
[2:08:03] he don't have any mouths but your mouth
[2:08:05] so be careful what you say
[2:08:08] he don't have any feet but your feet
[2:08:11] be careful that you leave your feet
[2:08:13] stuck in one place
[2:08:15] and don't move when he wants you to move
[2:08:17] with them see we are the branches he is
[2:08:20] a vine
[2:08:21] and as the branch we're not going to
[2:08:23] manifest the denominational view as a
[2:08:25] branch we're not going to manifest a
[2:08:26] man-made idea as a branch we're not
[2:08:29] going to manifest cold formal powerless
[2:08:30] religion but as a branch we're going to
[2:08:32] manifest the power of God we're going to
[2:08:35] bring forth fruit and that fruit as
