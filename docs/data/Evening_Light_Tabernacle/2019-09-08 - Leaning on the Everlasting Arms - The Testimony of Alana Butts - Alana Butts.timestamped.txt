[0:37] we made an appointment with my primary
[0:40] care physician who had ordered the
[0:42] allergy testing to start with and she
[0:45] just I told her about my cough that was
[0:48] going on and that had gotten worse I
[0:51] told her about the fatigue that was
[0:53] bothering me the aversion to food and
[0:55] about
[0:57] just overall malaise that I was dealing
[0:59] with and she automatically just ordered
[1:01] a chest x-ray I showed her the lumps on
[1:04] my chest and she thought it might be in
[1:05] the rib cage at the bone and so um she
[1:09] decided to order chest x-rays and wanted
[1:11] it kind of a strange angle that actually
[1:13] shows the bone structure as well and
[1:16] fell so I went to the hospital and had
[1:19] that done and David was in there with me
[1:21] when I had the x-ray done and when he
[1:25] saw the x-ray he was very alarmed
[1:28] because the hole right long area was
[1:31] totally white and being in the medical
[1:35] field himself he seen x-rays many x-rays
[1:39] before and he knew that this was not
[1:41] just a little cough problem anymore and
[1:45] so um the next day the doctor called me
[1:50] in she said Elana
[1:52] she said I'm looking at your report of
[1:54] your x-ray and she said I do not like
[1:58] what I'm what I see here and she said
[2:02] there's a mass in your lung and um she
[2:06] said it looks like cancer she said now I
[2:10] want you to see an oncologist but and I
[2:13] she said I can't say for sure that it's
[2:16] cancer I've been wrong twice this year I
[2:18] sent somebody to an oncology and call
[2:20] oncologist who thought it was I thought
[2:24] it was lung cancer and it turned out
[2:25] that it was not it was a strange
[2:27] infection she said so I could be wrong
[2:29] on this but I do want you to be prepared
[2:31] that it's quite possible that this is
[2:33] what is going on here and so you can
[2:37] imagine the shock that we felt at
[2:40] something that we felt was probably just
[2:42] going to be a routine checkup and some
[2:45] pneumonia or something like that and so
[2:48] this was a Friday and we had the weekend
[2:51] to digest this information and so we let
[2:55] family and friends know I called my mom
[2:58] and told her and she she said Elena she
[3:01] said you can tell me these things before
[3:03] they escalate to a point like this and I
[3:04] said mom you've known everything that
[3:06] has happened
[3:06] and I said you know as much as I've
[3:08] known but I didn't realize either I had
[3:10] no idea it happened so gradually I
[3:13] didn't realize that these symptoms were
[3:15] all together pointing to something that
[3:18] potentially is serious
[3:19] so anyway and we we told people in the
[3:23] church and they began praying and things
[3:25] and um we didn't get very much sleep
[3:29] that night as we considered the
[3:31] possibilities of course your mind just
[3:33] tends to go very extreme in a case like
[3:39] that and so David was up walking the
[3:42] driveway 3:30 the next morning and it
[3:46] was actually very hard to look at each
[3:48] other um during that weekend because you
[3:52] know that it could be something very
[3:54] serious that would take you away from
[3:57] each other and um
[4:02] it was something that's actually
[4:03] indescribable unless you've gone through
[4:05] it but I just I just felt like God is
[4:12] God and I felt like this time I could
[4:16] trust him and from the beginning I made
[4:18] a decision that I was going to look to
[4:20] the Word of God and that I was not going
[4:22] to fear this thing and of course you
[4:25] cannot stop the thoughts that come into
[4:27] your mind at a moment like this but when
[4:29] they would come in I would say but the
[4:31] Word of God says he's a healer of all my
[4:34] diseases and so um Saturday the next day
[4:38] we sat down with our children in the
[4:40] living room and we told them we said
[4:44] they've all been raised in a Christian
[4:47] home they you know from the day they
[4:49] were born and we said this is what the
[4:52] doctor is found it could be an infection
[4:54] and it could be cancer and we believe
[4:56] we're believing for it to be an
[4:57] infection but we said if it's not God is
[5:02] still God and we're making a choice to
[5:04] just believe him we're not gonna fear
[5:07] this thing we said all the shouting and
[5:09] praising the Lord that we do in church
[5:11] all the singing that we do it's all
[5:13] about this moment we've not had huge
[5:16] trials in our family and if this is our
[5:18] moment we're going to trust God and
[5:20] we're gonna be real soldiers and do it
[5:22] with all our heart and so we were
[5:24] talking to them and David said some
[5:26] things to them along the same lines and
[5:29] the Holy Spirit just came down in that
[5:30] room such tremendous annoyed
[5:34] and it brought that comfort to my heart
[5:36] and I've always wondered you know we
[5:40] have lady and a couple in our church who
[5:43] has who lost a child and through
[5:47] sickness and heart problems and I
[5:49] wondered at the time how do they walk
[5:51] through this with such dignity and in
[5:54] that moment I knew how you do it because
[5:57] God is the comforter I never felt such
[6:00] peace in my life as I felt at that
[6:02] moment
[6:04] so we just talked with the family and
[6:06] prayed together and then everybody went
[6:09] away and then David went outside and
[6:11] proceeded to mow all 20 acres of our
[6:14] property I was concerned about the trees
[6:16] and everything as he just digested all
[6:20] of this and started to fight his own
[6:21] battle which is unique to somebody who
[6:23] works in the medical field but I was
[6:27] texting a friend later on and I told her
[6:29] I said I can walk through anything if
[6:31] that presence is with me like it was
[6:33] today so I did not know what was ahead
[6:37] of me but I met it and this time there
[6:40] was an anchor that have been missing the
[6:43] year before
[6:44] [Music]
[6:54] so next I was scheduled to start seeing
[6:56] an oncologist and so I did that
[6:59] I went to my first appointment and he
[7:02] asked me of course about all my symptoms
[7:04] and all of that and I just as as we were
[7:08] there he just said I don't think you had
[7:10] lung cancer and I said oh so you don't
[7:12] think I have cancer he said no I don't
[7:13] think you have lung cancer he said your
[7:15] symptoms don't fit that he said perhaps
[7:17] lymphoma he said perhaps tuberculosis or
[7:21] some infection like that we really don't
[7:22] know and so we're gonna start running
[7:24] some tests so they did a whole series of
[7:28] blood work you know vials for blood work
[7:31] and and started doing some testing and
[7:34] ordered a CT scan and that showed up
[7:38] that I had a lymph node swollen under my
[7:41] arm which turned out to be 2 to 3
[7:42] centimeters in size but I didn't know
[7:45] about it was deep enough and so he
[7:47] ordered a he ordered a biopsy of that
[7:51] lymph node now as I said I've never
[7:54] really had any procedures done or
[7:56] anything and just the thought of that
[7:58] was very unnerving to me and I just I
[8:00] told people I don't do pain you know
[8:03] they sound uncomfortable I don't do pain
[8:05] you know and so um it was everything
[8:09] from the ground up was a new experience
[8:12] to me and it was very frightening at the
[8:14] onset and I just said god I'm looking to
[8:17] you for everything that I go through you
[8:19] will be with me whether I feel it or not
[8:21] these different hospitals that I'm being
[8:23] sent to in different clinics they're all
[8:26] they all have their own atmosphere and
[8:28] many of them are not atmospheres of
[8:30] faith and you kind of feel like you're
[8:32] you know the only one in there but that
[8:35] that believes but somehow I just believe
[8:40] the Lord would be with me and now and
[8:42] then I did had a really nice experience
[8:44] with somebody who was a Christian the
[8:46] lady who drew my blood at the oncologist
[8:48] as she drew it she said we're just gonna
[8:51] pray that every one of these comes back
[8:53] negative and it would just be a very
[8:54] positive thing in your day as you were
[8:56] fighting your mind battles they did the
[8:59] biopsy under my arm they did
[9:02] a bronchoscopy where they went down and
[9:06] biopsy inside my lung and did some took
[9:10] some cultures out of there to test for
[9:11] infection
[9:12] they were very perplexed by my case
[9:14] because my symptoms didn't specifically
[9:17] match cancer or infection and meanwhile
[9:21] I was just feeling worse and worse all
[9:23] the time Mike off had gotten very bad
[9:26] and then I started to have a weight in
[9:28] my stomach almost like when you're
[9:31] expecting a baby that is so I felt like
[9:33] I needed to stretch out like this a lot
[9:35] of the time and at this time I can only
[9:38] figure that it had something to do with
[9:39] my lung not wanting to expand properly
[9:42] but my appetite was just I had no
[9:47] appetite whatsoever as they did these
[9:49] different tests everything came back
[9:51] negative they just were as I said very
[9:56] perplexed by it and finally they decided
[9:58] that I needed to have a lung surgery
[10:00] called of that done where they go in
[10:02] from the side and they take pretty
[10:05] impressive wedges out of your lung
[10:06] incident test that for infection and for
[10:11] any sort of cancer and so meanwhile my
[10:16] mom having found out that I had the mass
[10:17] in my lung decided to come visit and she
[10:20] lives in Canada where I am originally
[10:22] from and so she decided to come stay
[10:24] with me if only to cook because if I
[10:27] cooked my own food it made it that much
[10:28] harder to eat it so um she came and
[10:31] stayed with me and started helping with
[10:33] the housework and helping with the
[10:35] children because I was just becoming
[10:38] less and less able to care for myself
[10:40] and just losing interest in life in
[10:43] general and so um she came and stayed
[10:46] with me and and so when I had the
[10:50] surgery she stayed with the children and
[10:52] the surgery went very well and they did
[10:55] some testing during the surgery and
[10:56] found out that there was nothing
[10:58] everything was coming back negative
[11:01] and so after my um after the surgery was
[11:05] over I had a follow-up appointment this
[11:07] by now were into December from October
[11:10] to December they were doing all this
[11:12] testing I'd seen a couple of
[11:14] pulmonologists different pulmonologists
[11:16] and was kind of being passed around from
[11:19] one facility to another while I did
[11:21] testing the day that I went in to have
[11:25] my surgery done of course this was a
[11:27] bigger deal even than the other
[11:28] procedures that I'd had done and
[11:30] naturally I wasn't looking forward to it
[11:33] and I read a sermon by William Brennan
[11:37] which is something that I do regularly
[11:39] because I I feed on those sermons
[11:42] they're a lifeline to me they're so
[11:44] inspired by God and and he was speaking
[11:48] about Satan and he said Satan following
[11:50] you along that great big king kingly
[11:53] priestly Goliath trying to scare the
[11:56] liver at of you but you're fortified by
[11:59] the word and as I went in for this
[12:01] surgery
[12:02] I said yes that is exactly what it is
[12:04] this Goliath is trying to scare the
[12:06] liver out of me and I refuse to bow to
[12:08] that and I have the Word of God that is
[12:11] going to protect me no matter what I go
[12:13] through and that is what I told people
[12:15] when they'd ask how I was doing I would
[12:17] say I feel rotten I have no appetite
[12:20] and God is with me and God is my healer
[12:22] and that was my confession throughout
[12:24] this entire ordeal and it wasn't what I
[12:28] always felt but it's what I always
[12:30] believed
[12:31] so um a week after my surgery I had a
[12:35] follow-up appointment by now we were
[12:36] into well into December and so when I
[12:41] went there the doctor said he said we've
[12:44] sent your the cultures and biopsies and
[12:47] things off to the University of Michigan
[12:49] for a second opinion on them and he said
[12:52] I don't think you have cancer he said
[12:54] maybe you'll have just an interesting
[12:56] infection named after you and it was
[12:59] kind of a light-hearted conversation but
[13:01] it's very positive he said those results
[13:03] will take about two weeks to get back or
[13:05] could take up to two weeks
[13:07] and so I left and the very next day I
[13:11] had an appointment at another hospital
[13:12] and this was a follow-up from a previous
[13:16] bronchoscopy that I'd had done it was a
[13:19] lesser test and we already had gotten
[13:22] all the results back from that and
[13:24] everything had been negative on
[13:25] infection and so we actually thought
[13:28] about not showing up for that
[13:29] appointment and just calling and
[13:30] cancelling it because we were past that
[13:32] into the bigger surgery but decided just
[13:35] to keep the appointment and these this
[13:37] pulmonologist had been in contact with
[13:39] the surgeon who had just done the major
[13:41] surgery and they'd been talking back and
[13:43] forth about the results so David and I
[13:46] went to this appointment at a hospital
[13:48] and the appointment it the wait was very
[13:52] long the children were at home waiting
[13:54] for supper and hours were passing I felt
[13:56] as sick as a dog I would get up and walk
[13:59] around to feel a little better and then
[14:00] I'd sit down trying to feel a little
[14:02] better and I was just feeling bad by
[14:04] this time I was having severe sweats
[14:06] where I would just soak through a whole
[14:09] layer of clothes just when everybody
[14:11] else was freezing and so I was sweating
[14:13] profusely when the doctor came in he sat
[14:16] down and he said so you've you've gotten
[14:19] your results that you have Hodgkin's
[14:20] lymphoma and I just stared at him I said
[14:23] no i said i think that was being
[14:25] considered but they've sent the results
[14:27] off to the university of michigan and it
[14:29] will be a few weeks before we get them
[14:30] back and he said no these are the
[14:32] results from the University of Michigan
[14:34] they just came in and he said you have
[14:36] Podge consumed FOMA and he had assumed
[14:38] that we knew this
[14:40] and I was just in shock I could just
[14:43] feel my face just turning hot you know
[14:46] moving up and David was just staring at
[14:49] him and he started to talk about what
[14:52] Hodgkin's lymphoma was classical
[14:54] Hodgkin's lymphoma and he said it's the
[14:58] good news is that it's treatable he said
[15:00] you should regain back lung function and
[15:03] he said we treated with chemotherapy and
[15:06] radiation and he said your doctor your
[15:09] oncologist has been informed and about
[15:11] that time David's phone started ringing
[15:13] and it was already my oncologist calling
[15:15] him and we were just stunned and he said
[15:20] you have any questions and I said well I
[15:23] just need some time to digest this so I
[15:25] guess I just need to think about it
[15:27] before I come up with questions and he
[15:30] said I'm sorry to deliver this news to
[15:32] you week before Christmas and I said
[15:34] well no you can't help that we drove
[15:36] home and
[15:38] he said you can you talk to the kids cuz
[15:41] you tell them what you want them to know
[15:42] I said okay we went in and we told the
[15:46] kids we said the doctors have talked to
[15:48] us and they've told us I do have cancer
[15:50] and we said this changes nothing we said
[15:54] what we told you about this situation at
[15:56] the beginning is what we hold to right
[15:58] now is that God is a healer we are not
[16:01] going to fear this thing we said mama
[16:03] mama might get really sick for a while
[16:05] and we need you guys to be the very best
[16:08] you can be but you know things might
[16:12] look a little rough around here for a
[16:13] while but we're gonna just work together
[16:14] and we're just gonna trust God that
[16:18] everything's gonna be okay
[16:19] and my mom had actually gone back home
[16:21] when I'd had this lung surgery after it
[16:24] was over she'd gone back home we thought
[16:26] oh we were gonna get I was gonna take
[16:28] some antibiotics and everything was
[16:30] gonna be fine and so she had not planned
[16:32] to come back but we we called her and
[16:36] let her know what was gonna happen what
[16:38] was happening and told the family in the
[16:40] church and in and so that just opened a
[16:45] whole new chapter for us
[16:56] the oncologist wanted to meet with us
[16:59] right away after after receiving this
[17:02] diagnosis so the next day we met with
[17:04] him and he sat down and he gave me the
[17:07] papers with what drugs I would be
[17:09] receiving he told me that I would
[17:12] probably require radiation because the
[17:15] tumor in my lung was about seven
[17:18] centimeters big and he said with that
[17:21] tumor burden that's how he referred to
[17:23] it
[17:24] he said usually we do radiation but
[17:27] because of its location you would
[17:29] actually be injuring the breast as well
[17:31] and a lot of times women will end up
[17:33] having breast cancer from the radiation
[17:35] years down the road if they're young
[17:36] enough to live that long and he already
[17:40] had three patients who had that problem
[17:42] from having had radiation so he was
[17:44] hesitant to do that but yet felt like it
[17:48] might be necessary
[17:49] regardless he said I would need the full
[17:52] regimen of chemotherapy for Hodgkin's
[17:54] lymphoma he said it was Stage four
[17:57] because it was already in an organ and
[18:00] he said that would include 12 treatments
[18:02] two weeks apart and it was four separate
[18:05] drugs he said they'd recently switched
[18:09] out one drug because it was better on
[18:12] the lung than what the previous drug had
[18:14] been and this was a very recent
[18:16] development although it it had been
[18:18] studied for a few years but that was
[18:20] good news to me because my problem was
[18:22] literally in the lung and I didn't need
[18:23] more problems in my lung as well but he
[18:27] just said I'm gonna sit down and tell
[18:28] you what you can expect with
[18:29] chemotherapy and he said when you've had
[18:31] enough you tell me because this is very
[18:33] overwhelming information and I
[18:36] understand that and we can pick up
[18:38] another time if you know when you've had
[18:41] enough so he started to write down the
[18:44] side effects that I would deal with and
[18:46] how I would feel this day and you know
[18:49] just launched into it and it was just
[18:53] surreal really you picture other people
[18:56] going through this sort of thing but you
[18:57] never picture yourself in that situation
[19:00] but somehow
[19:02] when I came away from that appointment
[19:04] for some reason I actually felt a little
[19:06] better I guess unknown can be more
[19:09] fearful than being told exactly what to
[19:12] expect and he was a very gentle very
[19:15] gentle doctor and very kind and
[19:18] understanding and so he just explained
[19:20] what to expect and I realized that he
[19:21] does this every day and anyway somehow I
[19:25] came away not feeling like I was gonna
[19:27] make it I I don't know how to explain
[19:31] the fact that you can feel like you're
[19:33] on a runaway cart while you also feel
[19:36] like God is in control and so after that
[19:42] I was put through a series of tests I
[19:45] had to have my lungs tested to see if
[19:48] they could stand up to chemotherapy they
[19:52] did a heart test as well they I met with
[19:55] a doctor to have my port put in which
[19:58] they would use to put the chemotherapy
[20:00] into my body and all of this was just of
[20:04] course very a lot to take in in just a
[20:07] couple of days especially when I thought
[20:09] I was going to go on antibiotics for an
[20:11] infection and so um that we received the
[20:15] diagnosis on Tuesday met with the doctor
[20:17] on Wednesday before Christmas and had
[20:20] appointments the next day and so by
[20:24] Friday it was a first day for me to be
[20:26] home quietly since my diagnosis I hadn't
[20:30] really had a good cry about it I hadn't
[20:31] had time to think much about it but that
[20:33] day I had some time to myself and it
[20:35] started to sink in as to what was ahead
[20:37] of me and I was feeling very sick
[20:40] already and I just felt like I would not
[20:44] be able to fight you have to fight
[20:47] through chemotherapy and I thought I
[20:49] don't have fight in me I'm already sick
[20:52] and tired of being sick and tired and so
[20:55] I was overwhelmed by what was ahead of
[20:57] me and frankly I started to become
[21:00] frightened and I was just thinking about
[21:03] it and I just thought I cannot do this
[21:05] I said Lord I know you're gonna be with
[21:07] me you said you would be but I don't
[21:08] want to go through it and so the next
[21:11] morning David was doing some work in the
[21:13] garage and I went out and that's what I
[21:14] told him I said David I just I started
[21:17] to cry I said I don't want to go through
[21:19] this I know God is gonna help me I don't
[21:22] doubt that for a second but I just don't
[21:23] even want to go near it he said I wish I
[21:26] could take some of it from you and I
[21:28] said I wish you could too
[21:29] I was that desperate at that point but
[21:32] um he just held me for a few minutes and
[21:34] I had a little cry and I went back in
[21:37] the house and I picked up my phone and
[21:39] there was a screenshot that Naomi will
[21:42] send a girl in our church and sent me
[21:44] and it was a little quotation from a
[21:47] sermon called hear his voice and it said
[21:49] don't be scared honey God is watching
[21:52] you the devil may try to do something to
[21:54] you but God's greater and it was taken
[21:57] from the sermon where William Branham
[21:59] was talking about Marion putting Moses
[22:02] in the bulrushes and that's what I felt
[22:05] that's how I felt at that moment too is
[22:08] that I was launching out into something
[22:09] way out of my control and way out of
[22:14] just beyond anything that I felt like I
[22:17] was prepared for but yet when that came
[22:20] through on my phone phone I knew that
[22:22] was God that caused her to send that to
[22:25] me and I felt it was supernatural just
[22:28] like reading about the girl healed of
[22:30] Hodgkin's lymphoma I knew that was a
[22:32] supernatural moment because we serve a
[22:35] supernatural God and he will be there
[22:38] for you in whatever you go through and
[22:39] in your most desperate dark times he's
[22:42] to help you and I felt that found that
[22:44] for myself it just gave me courage once
[22:49] again to know that he was gonna be with
[22:50] me so this was Saturday the following
[22:53] Monday was Christmas and it was the
[22:55] strangest Christmas of my life I felt as
[22:57] sick as a dog I saw on social media
[23:00] everybody's celebrating with their
[23:01] families and I felt so strange I felt
[23:03] like nothing in my life was recognizable
[23:05] anymore nothing in my body was
[23:08] recognizable anymore and I almost didn't
[23:11] know how to interact with my family
[23:12] because I thought what if I am to be
[23:14] taken away from them there's there's all
[23:17] these thoughts that go through your mind
[23:18] you know but I just when I'd have these
[23:21] thoughts I would just turn from them and
[23:22] say God you are my healer you said you'd
[23:24] be with me I don't know where this is
[23:26] going to take me but you said you would
[23:28] be with me and that's I kept going back
[23:30] to that and kept going back to that I
[23:32] thought I'm gonna be a real soldier and
[23:34] a real child of God and I put my trust
[23:37] in the fact that he loves me whether I
[23:39] was feeling it at that moment or not
[23:41] he's his promises to his children are
[23:44] full of love and compassion and so
[23:47] that's what I trusted and in those
[23:48] moments where I think life was very
[23:51] overwhelming the day after Christmas I
[23:54] went in for surgery to have my port
[23:56] inserted into my shoulder area and when
[24:02] I got up that morning on my phone there
[24:04] there was a scripture I because I have
[24:07] the Bible app and it was Isaiah 41:10
[24:10] feared though not for I'm with thee be
[24:13] not dismayed for I am thy God I will
[24:15] strengthen thee yea I will help thee yea
[24:18] I will uphold thee with the right my
[24:19] right hand of righteousness
[24:21] and I felt like God gave me that
[24:24] scripture for that day and that is a
[24:26] scripture that carried me through my
[24:28] chemotherapy I posted it all over my
[24:31] house and read it daily many times a day
[24:33] sometimes I will help thee that when I
[24:36] needed help I'd say God I'd hold him to
[24:38] it I said God you said you would help me
[24:40] and I am looking to you for that help I
[24:42] need it this moment and that day that
[24:46] marine when I went in for surgery
[24:50] Beth Adams a girl in our church sent me
[24:52] that same scripture she also had the
[24:54] Bible app and it popped up on her phone
[24:56] and she sent it to me and I said out of
[24:58] the mouth of two or three witnesses it
[25:00] was like God in an audible voice with
[25:02] telling me I've got this and we're gonna
[25:04] be okay
[25:07] [Music]
[25:15] the next day was Wednesday I was
[25:17] scheduled for a PET scan and that shows
[25:20] where cancer is located in your body
[25:21] because they knew it was in the lung but
[25:23] they didn't know where else and they
[25:25] didn't do it prior to this time because
[25:27] insurance will not cover it unless they
[25:29] already know you have cancer and so I
[25:33] went from my pet skin and I came home I
[25:38] was there a few hours and I came home
[25:40] and I was resting from that because they
[25:42] give you valium and David came home from
[25:45] work he said doctor the doctor wants you
[25:47] to come in and start chemotherapy today
[25:49] and I was like here we go okay let's go
[25:54] so I got up right then and we left the
[25:57] children at home and we went in for my
[26:00] first chemotherapy appointment every
[26:04] treatment I took David and I just prayed
[26:06] over it
[26:07] we we'd always said if it ever came to
[26:10] the time when we had cancer or anything
[26:13] we probably wouldn't take any more
[26:14] therapy we we discussed it a few times I
[26:17] would hate to go through that it just
[26:18] wouldn't be worth it but when it was
[26:20] when I found out I had cancer there was
[26:23] no question in my mind that I was to
[26:25] take the chemotherapy I did not feel
[26:28] like I was to take the radiation and I
[26:29] felt from the beginning that that was
[26:31] not an option for me and I didn't tell
[26:34] the doctor that but I told other people
[26:35] I won't be taking the radiation I'm
[26:37] gonna trust God with that part that
[26:39] he'll take care of that so we prayed
[26:42] over the chemotherapy treatment that it
[26:44] would go right to its mark and do it it
[26:46] was supposed to do and that I would not
[26:48] have to deal with horrible side effects
[26:50] and I always am amazed that in the Old
[26:54] Testament God would say to the
[26:56] Israelites the diseases that come upon
[27:00] the other nations will not come upon you
[27:02] and the things that they deal with it's
[27:04] different for you and I felt
[27:06] I'm his every every bit his child as
[27:08] much as what those people were and so I
[27:11] can have expectations that I get special
[27:13] treatment not because I'm better than
[27:15] anybody else but just because I'm his
[27:17] child and that is not unique to me it's
[27:20] just unique to his children and that's
[27:22] something that I begin
[27:23] to just believe for myself so they told
[27:28] me each treatment is gonna you're gonna
[27:30] feel a little worse they put a little
[27:33] bit more of the medication in every time
[27:35] your body it's very foreign to your body
[27:37] and your body's not gonna like it and so
[27:40] they said you could feel progressively
[27:42] worse with each treatment a lot of
[27:45] medications to help me get through the
[27:46] treatments the stomach problems that
[27:48] they expect you to have the nausea to
[27:51] ward off any vomiting and things like
[27:54] that they tell you're gonna feel very
[27:56] fatigued
[27:58] you know they just prepare you for all
[28:00] sorts of things and they actually don't
[28:01] prepare you for everything
[28:03] only the top five and so um I went home
[28:07] and it started a whole new cycle for me
[28:11] because not only was i dealing with
[28:12] lymphoma
[28:13] I was also dealing with the chemotherapy
[28:14] treatments and so by this time I was so
[28:19] sick that I was talking very little
[28:21] around the house if the kids wanted to
[28:25] know can I can we go here can we do this
[28:26] I'd say ask Abigail ask daddy that's
[28:28] about as much as I wanted to say I did
[28:30] not want to make decisions I'd lost
[28:32] interest in all of that I cared about my
[28:35] kids but I could not I felt too sick to
[28:37] even make basic decisions with regards
[28:40] to them and Dana like I said there is
[28:43] all sorts of other things that started
[28:44] happening literally from the moment the
[28:47] chemotherapy goes into your body you
[28:48] start to notice things and I just began
[28:53] turning these things over to God you
[28:55] know they said watch for tingling and
[28:56] numbness in your fingers and in your
[28:58] toes for neuropathy and so when I'd
[29:01] start to feel the tingling I'd say God I
[29:04] can't do anything about this but you
[29:06] said you would help me and you said
[29:07] you're a healer and I'm praying that you
[29:09] will take care of my extremities my lung
[29:13] by this time felt like it was made of
[29:14] lead it felt like there was no expansion
[29:16] in it it got worse I would get up at
[29:19] night and I would when I would breathe
[29:22] in those first few breaths when I got
[29:23] out of bed at night it felt like the
[29:26] breath came out in in three pieces it
[29:29] was like
[29:30] and before it would really start coming
[29:33] out normal and I felt like it was
[29:35] scraping over bones I don't really know
[29:37] what to this day what was happening but
[29:39] it felt like it was scraping over
[29:40] something inside and it was very
[29:42] frightening in itself and I just thought
[29:44] I am NOT gonna worry about this
[29:46] I cannot worry about this God you
[29:48] created my lung I believe that you're
[29:49] gonna heal it and I would go to the
[29:52] restroom do what I had to do and go back
[29:53] to bed and just go back to sleep and
[29:56] that's what I did all day every day when
[29:59] I had to eat a meal which was one of the
[30:02] most horrific things that I dealt with
[30:04] during this entire time was having to
[30:05] make myself eat and I would say God just
[30:09] get me through this meal help me to get
[30:11] it down because I've got to keep this
[30:12] weight on by the time I was at the end
[30:16] of my first treatment I was I had
[30:18] dropped about nine pounds from my pre
[30:22] fitness weight which on my frame who was
[30:25] very significant and worrisome I no
[30:28] longer was recognizing my body the way
[30:30] it felt even sitting on a chair was
[30:32] uncomfortable and it was overwhelming
[30:36] and I said god I'm looking to you to
[30:38] help me with my meals to help me gain
[30:40] weight I was some at 2,000 calories a
[30:44] day I was still losing weight I had to
[30:47] get over 2,000 I had to get 2,000
[30:49] calories to maintain weight at least and
[30:52] to gain it was more like 2300 calories a
[30:54] day and I was doing nothing so my body
[30:57] was just working through an unbelievable
[31:02] rate and my mom spent a good part of her
[31:04] day trying to get fat into me she would
[31:07] pour oil over my lasagna she would give
[31:10] me glasses of orange juice with oil in
[31:12] them I would have cereal with heavy
[31:14] whipping cream on them we would just do
[31:16] anything we could to make to get extreme
[31:19] amounts of calories in small amounts of
[31:22] food because I could not take in large
[31:24] amounts of food so um my bathroom
[31:28] started to look like a pharmacy with all
[31:31] the medications that the doctor given me
[31:32] I've never been one to take more than
[31:34] one ibuprofen at a time thankfully I've
[31:37] been very healthy and rarely needed it
[31:39] and I hate it to even take any of the
[31:42] medications to keep things moving in my
[31:44] body and keep them functioning properly
[31:46] but I just said God even if I take these
[31:50] will you just take care of my body you
[31:52] know in the same way that I believe you
[31:53] are with the chemotherapy the first the
[31:59] first treatment left me you know it was
[32:02] very difficult on my body because of the
[32:04] lymphoma symptoms at the same time I
[32:06] missed the first three church services
[32:08] which were very difficult for me I hated
[32:10] to see the family go off and leave me at
[32:12] home but I just began to pray that the
[32:16] Lord would help me to be able to go to
[32:17] church and and that those were the only
[32:21] church services I missed the whole time
[32:23] I went through chemotherapy I made it to
[32:25] every single service after that
[32:27] sometimes I would be laying on the couch
[32:29] at 2 o'clock on a Wednesday evening and
[32:31] the kids would say mom you gonna go to
[32:33] church and I'd say I'm sure gonna try my
[32:35] stomach is hurting so bad but I'm gonna
[32:36] try and but about 3 o'clock I'd feel a
[32:39] little better and I'd get up and get
[32:42] ready for church and heat a little
[32:43] something and I was able to go and I
[32:46] usually felt terrible while I was there
[32:48] but I it was such a lifeline for me and
[32:52] the things that would form ministered
[32:54] wouldn't minister to me so deeply I
[32:57] didn't care who was around me but they'd
[32:59] minister that God is God is bigger and
[33:03] that you can speak to your Mountain I
[33:05] would stand up and I'd showed that's me
[33:07] Lord that's me
[33:09] I felt that so deeply because I'm his
[33:12] child
[33:13] and these things that were being
[33:14] preached applied to me in my situation
[33:16] and I knew it and I claimed it from my
[33:18] own and I knew that God was moving in my
[33:22] life and even though I had many doubts
[33:25] and many fears and may thoughts passed
[33:27] through my head you're not gonna make it
[33:29] to your 41st birthday you know and you
[33:32] got cancer for your 40th birthday and
[33:33] you're not gonna make it I had thoughts
[33:35] upon thoughts and that changed nothing
[33:37] I'd say Satan you are a liar
[33:40] those are your thoughts I believe the
[33:42] Word of God and I didn't always feel
[33:44] spiritual I didn't sometimes the text
[33:46] would come through and somebody would
[33:47] give me a scripture and I'd read
[33:49] not just put it down I couldn't even
[33:51] digest it and later on I'd go back and
[33:53] read it and say yes Lord that is true
[33:55] and it would encourage me the people in
[33:57] the church would send me cards with
[33:59] scriptures in them I would lay on the
[34:01] couch and just have them on the table
[34:03] and read them over and over till I had
[34:04] to memorize and the text that came
[34:07] through
[34:08] sometimes it was supernatural the things
[34:10] that it said would be exactly what I'd
[34:12] been dealing with and so how can you
[34:14] doubt a God who speaks to you like that
[34:16] and who is so present in your worst
[34:19] moments
[34:20] [Music]
[34:30] gradually it got to the place I got
[34:34] through that first treatment it was very
[34:37] difficult but by the second treatment
[34:40] [Music]
[34:42] brother Tim our pastor sent the text to
[34:47] David and I and it was a scripture
[34:49] second chronicles 20 verse 15 and in it
[34:54] it says the battle isn't yours but God
[34:56] and I thought about that and I thought
[34:59] how can the battle be his if I'm the one
[35:01] fighting I'm the one who's down here
[35:04] just working away at overcoming this
[35:07] thing and getting through this how can
[35:08] this battle be God but I saw in the Old
[35:12] Testament where the Israelites dealt in
[35:16] a physical realm things that we deal
[35:18] with in a spiritual realm and I saw how
[35:20] they just had to call on God and say
[35:22] look what they're saying about us look
[35:23] with the enemy feint about us and he'd
[35:25] say go to sleep I've got this don't
[35:27] worry about it and the next morning they
[35:28] get up and their enemy was dead like
[35:30] they just all be dead on the ground and
[35:32] I thought God if you'd do that for them
[35:35] you do that sort of thing today because
[35:37] you'd never change the word says you
[35:39] never change and so I said God I'm
[35:43] looking to you to fight my battle well
[35:46] that evening I got a card from a sister
[35:49] in our church Mary Katherine she had
[35:50] told me when I first got sick she said I
[35:52] will be sending you cards ready get
[35:53] ready with scriptures and written
[35:55] encouragement in them and that evening
[35:58] she sent me I received a card and it had
[36:01] the exact same scripture 2nd chronicles
[36:04] 20 verse 15 the battle isn't yours but
[36:06] gods and she wrote declare war on the
[36:09] devil no no retreat and I said
[36:12] you're telling me that you're gonna
[36:13] fight my battle and I don't know how
[36:15] you're gonna do it I don't understand
[36:17] because I feel like right now I'm the
[36:18] one who's going through all this stuff
[36:20] but if you tell me you're gonna fight my
[36:22] battle I believe you have something
[36:23] supernatural for me and from that moment
[36:26] on I didn't just believe for a healing I
[36:28] started to believe for something over
[36:30] and above something miraculous and the
[36:33] only thing that I could think of that
[36:35] would be him taking on my battle it was
[36:37] for him to take away the chemotherapy
[36:39] completely and I thought the only way
[36:42] that that's gonna happen would be for me
[36:43] to get a clear PET scan and I say god I
[36:46] don't want to put you in a box perhaps
[36:48] there's other another way you can do it
[36:50] because you're that kind of God you can
[36:52] come up with something but I knew that
[36:54] after four treatments I would have a PET
[36:56] scan and then I'd have no more PET scans
[36:59] until after the good thing 12 treatments
[37:02] were complete I said maybe you have
[37:04] something else for me but all I know is
[37:06] I'm believing for something supernatural
[37:07] and that you're taking on my battle
[37:11] meanwhile I I started my second
[37:15] treatment and I began to lose my hair
[37:17] the doctor told me that by the third
[37:19] treatment I would have no hair left and
[37:22] so right before church on a Wednesday
[37:25] night I was brushing my hair and the
[37:26] first the hair brush came out full of
[37:28] hair and I just looked at that I took a
[37:32] picture of it I said this is gonna mean
[37:34] something to me like this is the
[37:36] beginning of something you know that
[37:38] I've never had to deal with before and I
[37:41] looked at it it seemed very surreal
[37:43] I already had this aversion of food and
[37:46] all of a sudden this was turning my
[37:48] stomach to be losing this kind of hair
[37:50] and I just could already look at it but
[37:53] hearing this a melon rider so every time
[37:56] I brush my hair after that it would fall
[37:58] out I would braid it and I touch up here
[38:00] and it would all just come loose and it
[38:02] would be stuck in the braid but would
[38:04] just be loose I couldn't even keep my
[38:05] hair tidy during that time and so for
[38:08] the next week and a half my hair was
[38:10] just falling out constantly
[38:11] it became bald in the front and in the
[38:13] back first and so I started to wear a
[38:15] headband around it just to get me
[38:19] through and I'd have it just braided in
[38:20] the back loosely mom and I actually had
[38:23] a very funny moment one night I was
[38:26] getting ready we were about to go to bed
[38:28] but we were talking for a minute and I
[38:30] was sitting in the living room and I
[38:31] sneezed and my head just fell forward
[38:34] and we just laughed we said don't sneeze
[38:37] to her the whole braid is gonna fly off
[38:38] you know so we just giggles a little bit
[38:41] about that and then we thought this is
[38:42] really sick that we're finding us the
[38:45] least bit amusing but we did anyway one
[38:50] morning during this time I got up and
[38:52] written on the chalkboard
[38:53] was a scripture of debt every hair on
[38:56] your head is numbered
[38:57] my husband did rib met his encouragement
[39:00] to me it stood by my side in all of this
[39:04] I told the Lord when I was going through
[39:09] this I said would I come out will you
[39:12] help me to be the best place that I can
[39:16] be because of the way that he'd stood by
[39:18] my side and it all backrubs many times a
[39:21] day when my back would ache so bad from
[39:23] the chemotherapy he waited on me hand
[39:25] and foot and he wrote scriptures on the
[39:29] chalkboard to encourage me that he'd
[39:31] read that morning when he got up to go
[39:32] to work and I believed that every hair
[39:37] on my head if indeed number I knew that
[39:40] [Music]
[39:50] thankfully my treatments were actually
[39:52] better than what most people experience
[39:54] they were horrific every day was a
[39:58] battle and every day was different the
[40:02] way chemotherapy cycles work as you deal
[40:04] with different symptoms at different
[40:05] times in your cycle and so you never
[40:09] knew with what was ahead of you although
[40:11] you did recognize a bit of a pattern and
[40:13] after you'd had a couple of cycles of
[40:15] chemotherapy I was at the in the process
[40:19] of losing my hair it took about a week
[40:21] and a half for most of it to come out I
[40:24] I was avoiding washing it for a while
[40:28] because my scalp hurt a lot and because
[40:31] I knew that it was going to make a huge
[40:33] mess when I washed it because I knew a
[40:34] lot was gonna come out but finally I'd
[40:37] had enough and I washed it one day on a
[40:39] Thursday and when I was done I began to
[40:42] brush it and most of the remaining hair
[40:44] came all out in the next 30 minutes and
[40:47] it was a horrific process to really
[40:52] realize the finality of it I did not
[40:55] recognize myself in the mirror because
[40:56] there were strands still hanging down
[40:58] just at the back I looked like something
[40:59] out of a horror movie and it was a
[41:03] definitely a difficult process but I
[41:06] made a decision to ask one of the ladies
[41:08] in our church to come shave my head my
[41:11] scalp was quite tender at this time and
[41:13] she came over it saved mom and David
[41:16] emotional
[41:19] situation of having to be the ones to do
[41:21] it so the sister came over because she
[41:24] had done it once before to another for
[41:26] another that you had cancer and so I had
[41:34] a piece in my heart but my body hadn't
[41:37] quite caught up with me and I sweated
[41:39] the whole time I was having my head
[41:41] shaved soaked through the entire set of
[41:44] clothes she prayed before we did it and
[41:47] it was a beautiful prayer and very
[41:49] comforting and then she shaved my head
[41:52] while my mom cleaned the hair up off the
[41:53] floor and we cried together and it was
[41:57] over another short while and then I felt
[41:59] so much better it was behind me I felt
[42:01] clean bald head is better than a few
[42:04] strands let me tell you it's a lot less
[42:06] frightening I felt clean and good and I
[42:09] felt like I could move on so I began to
[42:12] wear hats I bought several different
[42:14] colors and things to go with my
[42:15] different outfits and I knew that God
[42:18] would restore my hair so as the days
[42:22] went on and I dealt with the things that
[42:24] you deal with in chemotherapy there's
[42:26] not a part of your body that doesn't
[42:28] ache itch hurt tingle burn there is
[42:34] literally not one part of my body that
[42:36] in some way was not affected by the
[42:38] chemotherapy or the lymphoma and so each
[42:42] day
[42:43] came down two hours and sometimes
[42:45] minutes to just get through that working
[42:48] to try to get through my food trying not
[42:51] to look too miserable I had stomach
[42:53] pains that were kind of unique to this
[42:55] kind of chemotherapy and the doctor did
[42:57] try different things with it but
[42:59] sometimes only certain positions would
[43:01] relieve the pain a little bit
[43:03] so as funny as it sounds coming at this
[43:07] time one of my kids would walk by my
[43:10] room and I'd be crawling around on the
[43:12] floor and they're like mom are you okay
[43:14] and I'm like just pray for mommy and I'm
[43:16] sure it had to be very frightening for
[43:18] them to see me act so strangely you know
[43:21] and there were a few nights I literally
[43:24] slept in a recliner upside down with my
[43:26] legs up the back of my head I'm the foot
[43:28] of the recliner because it was the only
[43:30] position I could get comfortable in
[43:31] until all the blood drained in my head
[43:33] and then I had to change position but
[43:36] there was all sorts of non dignifying
[43:41] things that take place during
[43:43] chemotherapy and thankfully the Lord was
[43:46] with me at all and I would tell him
[43:48] about my symptoms over and over again I
[43:51] would say God I can't do anything about
[43:53] my leg long but you're my healer I can't
[43:55] do anything about neuropathy but you are
[43:57] my healer and I'd say I'm sorry if I'm
[44:00] repeating this too much but it makes me
[44:01] feel better to tell you about it and
[44:03] that way I won't have to overburden my
[44:05] husband with it and worry him more and
[44:08] he listened I knew he did and I felt
[44:10] displeasure when I would trust him with
[44:13] the things I was going for I would feel
[44:15] him draw close and I told my dad who is
[44:18] not a Christian I said dad that healing
[44:20] angel is so close sometimes I can touch
[44:23] it I can almost touch him that's how
[44:25] much I believed that he was there but it
[44:28] did not make the situation easy it does
[44:31] not keep thoughts from coming in my mind
[44:33] lest anybody think that I'm
[44:35] super-spiritual or anything somebody
[44:37] said to me oh you'll make it through
[44:39] you're strong and I thought you have no
[44:41] idea I'm this weak as a kitten right now
[44:44] I feel like I couldn't I feel it's a
[44:47] weak as a kitten but God said he would
[44:49] be strong when I'm weak and that's what
[44:52] I was depending on anyway I told people
[44:54] I said this is Micah live I'm picking up
[44:56] stones and I'm about to cut his head off
[44:58] they're just something began to rise up
[45:01] in me and the more I fed it the more it
[45:03] rose up and the more pulsated and came
[45:05] out and it wasn't just me there was a
[45:07] whole church behind me rallying around
[45:09] me they'd have people say to me I have
[45:12] my doubts too and then the Lord said
[45:14] this to me or show me this or this song
[45:16] came to me and I say I know it were in
[45:18] it together and we're believing together
[45:19] and God is going to work one day my mom
[45:24] was working in the kitchen and I came
[45:25] into the living room to get something
[45:27] and she was there and I started to walk
[45:29] back to my bedroom and I turned around
[45:32] and I said mom I said I believe God is
[45:36] working in my situation I was thinking
[45:39] about that scripture brother Tim had
[45:41] sent about the battle and Mary Katharine
[45:43] had sent about the battle is the Lord's
[45:44] I said I believe God is working in my
[45:46] situation she said I do too I said no I
[45:49] mean something supernatural I believe
[45:51] God is gonna do something supernatural
[45:53] and tears came to her eyes and she said
[45:54] I do too we would share scriptures all
[45:57] of us would share scriptures the kids
[45:59] would write things on the board devil
[46:01] how a liar you are and we'd right yes
[46:02] that amen and things like that and we'd
[46:05] feed on that and I had cards from the
[46:07] church all strung across our fireplace
[46:09] and I'd stop and read them during the
[46:12] day and it would encourage my hurt all
[46:14] over again
[46:15] the church was bringing food by and
[46:18] doing many things to help me they had a
[46:20] food train we actually had a humorous
[46:23] moment one day when we looked at the
[46:24] chalkboard and it said appetizers it was
[46:27] a little chart that appetizers and main
[46:29] courses and it said soup soup soup soup
[46:31] soup soup soup soup which delaney or
[46:34] eleven-year-old had written on there and
[46:36] that week we'd had a lot of Sara
[46:38] podcasts but we all kind of giggled at
[46:40] that
[46:41] we had some funny moments it wasn't all
[46:44] just heaviness after I lost my hair I
[46:49] well always on Sundays
[46:52] I'll start getting ready for church and
[46:53] inevitably about the time I closed my
[46:55] bedroom door there's gonna be a knock
[46:56] from one of our five children and so I
[46:59] thought one day I thought I'm gonna get
[47:00] them so I shut the door and sure enough
[47:03] a minute later there was a knock on the
[47:05] door I said come in on bald and there's
[47:09] this pause and silence and then a little
[47:11] boy said oh that's okay and I was like
[47:13] oh didn't work you know but yeah but we
[47:17] did get a laugh out of that I did have a
[47:19] few bald jokes that I was allowed to say
[47:22] but the kids and David were not
[47:24] [Music]
[47:34] in thinking about um God fighting my
[47:37] battle I began to realize my mom had to
[47:39] leave to go back to Canada on February
[47:41] 28th she works in the accounting
[47:44] business and it was gonna be the start
[47:46] of tax season and so she was not gonna
[47:49] be able to stay and I started thinking
[47:51] about this
[47:52] it was also getting closer to the time
[47:54] of my my PET scan which they do after
[47:58] four treatments it's a way of monitoring
[48:00] how well your body is responding to
[48:02] lymphoma to the treatments for lymphoma
[48:05] they may also use it to decide whether
[48:08] they're gonna do radiation or how much
[48:10] and so um it's just a way of checking
[48:13] your progress and after that they just
[48:16] continue the rest of your treatments no
[48:17] questions asked and do a PET scan
[48:19] finally after your twelve treatments so
[48:22] it was approaching the time I'd had four
[48:24] treatments
[48:26] thankfully I had not that had the severe
[48:28] nausea and vomiting and things like that
[48:30] my fourth treatment I was going through
[48:33] a little Gethsemane not looking forward
[48:36] to it you know a couple of nights before
[48:39] that I thought I do not want to go
[48:41] through this next treatment I felt like
[48:43] I was still kind of recovering from the
[48:45] last one and and then I thought I don't
[48:49] have to accept that the first one's
[48:50] gonna be worse they told me they'll get
[48:52] progressively worse but I just thought
[48:54] I'm not going to sign up for that I'm
[48:56] gonna believe that this is gonna be the
[48:57] best treatment and believe it or not it
[49:00] was it was my easiest one I can honestly
[49:02] say that so um we went to church well to
[49:08] back up on Saturday February 17th I was
[49:12] getting ready for bed and my heart was
[49:14] so full of the goodness of God the
[49:16] things he'd done for me many of which
[49:19] that I've relayed to you and it was just
[49:22] overflowing
[49:24] okay and I was by myself and I thought
[49:26] God how can I ever thank you for your
[49:28] presence in all of this I know you're
[49:31] gonna do something supernatural for me
[49:32] but even beyond that just the way you've
[49:35] helped me and comforted me and sent
[49:36] things to me I know it's you and I know
[49:39] you're real and it just my heart was so
[49:41] full and I didn't know how to express it
[49:43] and I said how can I show people now
[49:45] while I'm sick I want to be able to show
[49:48] them how thankful I am to you and how
[49:50] grateful and that you're there for
[49:52] people when they go through a hard time
[49:53] I said I want to be able to express that
[49:55] somehow but I can't other than just in a
[49:58] text tell somebody God's healing my body
[50:00] and I believe his word or whatever so my
[50:03] heart was just very full in the next day
[50:06] February 18th we went to church in our
[50:09] pastor preached that God will do extreme
[50:11] things to get his people to believe and
[50:14] I knew I knew if it's true I knew it was
[50:17] for me and my heart was so full what was

[54:10] Holy Ghost let him lift you up today to
[54:14] rise with him after service we were just
[54:17] worshiping and thanking God I had to sit
[54:20] in an isolated area of the church the
[54:22] mezzanine seating so that I wouldn't
[54:24] have to wear mask during that time it
[54:27] mask is very warm and I just was it
[54:33] prevented me from having to I could
[54:35] interact at a distance so I was sitting
[54:39] up in the mezzanine sitting with my
[54:40] family and brother Tim was singing
[54:45] leading singing and he changed his song
[54:47] to leaning on the everlasting arms and
[54:50] something welled up in me my heart was
[54:53] already so full and it just welled up
[54:55] that that's what I've been doing it's
[54:57] leaning on the everlasting arms and what
[54:59] a fellowship and a joy divine and you
[55:02] know it's overwhelming to my heart and a
[55:05] little voice that meets that very busy
[55:07] I didn't know what I was gonna do I
[55:10] stepped out of my seat and I went down
[55:13] the steps to the methane feed and that
[55:16] Joey just started to come out of me and
[55:18] I began to leap and go around the church
[55:21] and there was such a determination
[55:24] people think my vote in my face was
[55:26] almost fears that I was so determined to
[55:29] serve God and to show the devil
[55:33] [Music]
[55:34] [Applause]
[55:34] [Music]
[55:47] [Applause]
[55:48] [Music]
[55:55] [Music]
[56:01] what you don't see on the video is the
[56:05] real atmosphere that was there you don't
[56:07] see the response as people say to
[56:09] rejoice with me after as they started to
[56:12] see what was going on there was a whole
[56:15] atmosphere there that you can sense some
[56:17] of it but not nearly like it was there
[56:19] and even after it was all over the
[56:22] worship that came out of my mouth as
[56:25] they dismiss people it was just flowing
[56:28] out of me such an expression of
[56:30] beautiful words that were just coming
[56:32] out of me and thanks to God for all that
[56:34] he was doing in my life
[56:35] [Music]
[57:40] [Music]
[57:47] [Music]
[57:55] so many things had improved but I still
[58:00] had many symptoms my lung still felt
[58:02] like it was made of lead but I was not
[58:05] looking at that I said god you're my
[58:07] healer I don't know what you have in
[58:08] store for me I did not know even what
[58:11] the results of the PET scan would be but
[58:13] I just believed that God was in control
[58:15] and that he had something supernatural
[58:16] and I felt like this could be it because
[58:18] Mom was about to leave it just all lined
[58:20] up and because I believed I just
[58:22] believed God was moving so why not now
[58:25] I guess maybe was what I was thinking so
[58:28] I was I went into that PET scan and
[58:30] trying to read you know the lady who
[58:33] does the PET scan you're trying to read
[58:34] her reaction and she just acted the same
[58:36] as she went when she came out I guess
[58:38] you're ready for your burger she said
[58:40] you know because you can't eat before
[58:41] PET scan and I couldn't read anything
[58:43] from her reaction so that was fine and I
[58:46] went home
[58:48] and the next day I met with my
[58:50] oncologist and David was with me and she
[58:54] went into the appointment and when he
[58:56] came into the room the doctor came in he
[58:58] said he was seen your skin and we said
[59:00] no he said um he said the cancer is gone
[59:03] he said the cancer is gone this is
[59:05] dramatic he said here come look and he
[59:08] took us over to a computer and showed us
[59:10] a side by side to scan showing the mass
[59:14] of my lung that from the scan they'd
[59:17] taken two days after Christmas and then
[59:20] this was February the 19th skin and
[59:23] every spot of lymphoma every lymph node
[59:26] that was affected was totally clear the
[59:29] seventh centimeter tumor was totally
[59:32] clear from cancer the report was
[59:34] absolutely beautiful it was clear and he
[59:37] said this is dramatic and I thought yes
[59:41] because sometimes God is very dramatic
[59:44] and so on
[59:47] I just I thank God to this day that he
[59:51] spared me all those treatments I've been
[59:55] in contact with another woman who's
[59:57] going through this exact same regimen
[59:59] and the vomiting and the nausea that
[1:00:02] that poor lady is dealing with
[1:00:04] I'm no special person I should have gone
[1:00:06] through that and yet God spared me
[1:00:08] that's paint every night before I go to
[1:00:12] bed I think in force very few
[1:00:15] because that was so very sick I was so
[1:00:18] very tired of nothing and he gave me a
[1:00:21] special treatment just because I'm his
[1:00:23] child and because I believed him became
[1:00:27] that something that he promises to
[1:00:29] anybody who will believe him
[1:00:31] I took him at his word and he was right
[1:00:34] there to meet it and so the recovery
[1:00:39] actually has been rapid every day I've
[1:00:42] felt better and it was amazing how
[1:00:45] quickly my energy came back once the
[1:00:47] chemotherapy was over I wondered I
[1:00:52] wondered how long it would take for my
[1:00:54] lung to start expanding again and
[1:00:56] there's just been it's improved by leaps
[1:01:00] and bounds and all the chemotherapy
[1:01:05] side-effects are totally gone you know I
[1:01:08] sometimes I'm going through my day doing
[1:01:11] the normal things of life and I can't
[1:01:13] believe that I feel normal and that I've
[1:01:14] I have food cravings that I'm hungry
[1:01:18] I haven't had not had that in almost two
[1:01:21] years a year and a half to two years I
[1:01:22] had not felt normal in many of these
[1:01:26] areas and I just thank God for his
[1:01:29] beauty and for His grace to me and I
[1:01:32] know that he extends it to anybody else
[1:01:34] who believe it's work
[1:01:40] [Music]
[1:02:11] you
