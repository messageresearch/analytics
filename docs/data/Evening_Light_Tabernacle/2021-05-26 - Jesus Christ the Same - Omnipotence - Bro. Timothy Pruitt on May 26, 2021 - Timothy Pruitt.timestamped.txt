[40:11] today and forever amen we'll let you be
[40:14] seated
[40:18] as we've been stating it's wonderful to
[40:20] serve a god
[40:22] who's the same today that he's not
[40:24] different today than he was yesterday
[40:27] or he's not thinking different today as
[40:28] he was yesterday
[40:30] you know he didn't get up today in a bad
[40:32] mood and think different thoughts about
[40:33] you but
[40:34] he's the same today amen and i'd like to
[40:37] speak to you tonight on jesus christ the
[40:40] same
[40:41] omnipotence omnipotence is one
[40:44] who has unlimited power or authority
[40:49] one who has unlimited power or authority
[40:52] you know it's hard for us as men limited
[40:55] creatures
[40:56] to comprehend unlimited things
[40:59] to comprehend something that's truly
[41:02] unlimited in its power
[41:04] or unlimited in its abilities even
[41:06] though
[41:07] man through scientific achievements has
[41:09] tried to obtain it
[41:10] they've fallen very short from it you
[41:12] know every
[41:14] because everything that man can make has
[41:16] limitations
[41:17] you know man-made cars they can only go
[41:20] so far
[41:20] they can only go so fast uh they can
[41:23] only last so long
[41:25] man-made airplanes can only go so fast
[41:28] they can only go so far
[41:29] they can only last so long man-made
[41:31] rockets the same story
[41:33] even man has broken to the nuclear realm
[41:37] but still things powered by nuclear
[41:39] power
[41:40] were only last so long
[41:43] it's limited because we are limited
[41:46] beings
[41:46] as far as humanity speaking human
[41:48] speaking yet man will
[41:50] begin to exalt himself because of his
[41:52] accomplishments
[41:54] and as great as they are they're still
[41:56] limited
[41:57] you know it's amazing to me even in
[41:59] man's great accomplishments how long
[42:02] it took man to go from a horse and buggy
[42:05] to an automobile
[42:06] it would be almost uh hundreds of years
[42:09] at least that
[42:10] that they would go riding in an ox car
[42:12] or a drone cart or a horse-drawn buggy
[42:15] until finally something would take place
[42:17] and that was the same brain as a man's
[42:19] always had
[42:20] the materials was always there but
[42:23] something
[42:23] happened for a man's abilities to be
[42:26] illuminated
[42:27] and i believe it was god allowing it to
[42:29] happen because it's to bring about an
[42:31] end time
[42:32] amen because in the time we have to have
[42:34] the things that we have to do what we do
[42:36] but every part of it is still limited
[42:38] you know and i know man in their
[42:40] greatness of thinking and the greatness
[42:42] of mine and
[42:43] and their education and things that they
[42:45] get into uh
[42:46] they begin to think how great they are
[42:48] but really we ought to think how little
[42:50] we really are
[42:51] in the grand scheme of things because
[42:53] when he speaks
[42:54] when because there because with god
[42:57] there is absolutely no limitations
[43:01] the only limits god has is what man
[43:04] limits him to you know if brother brown
[43:07] would talk about how our faith
[43:08] limits god how much our faith can be
[43:10] released that's how much god can do
[43:13] so really amen in this service there's
[43:15] no limits to what god can do
[43:18] in every service that's why brother
[43:19] branham would speak about it he said i
[43:21] believe god's to heal
[43:22] every person here tonight i believe
[43:24] god's here to deliver every person here
[43:26] tonight
[43:27] because there's no limits to his ability
[43:29] to heal there's no limits to his ability
[43:31] to deliver there's no limits to his
[43:34] ability whatsoever and when he speaks
[43:36] unlimited power
[43:38] is released when he speaks i mean a man
[43:41] can speak the greatest man on earth
[43:43] right now would be known as
[43:45] as a president maybe the united states
[43:47] or or some
[43:48] great leader somewhere but his speech
[43:50] has limitations
[43:52] it can only go so far it can only do so
[43:55] much
[43:55] but when god speaks it has unlimited
[43:58] power
[43:59] and therefore nothing can stop it
[44:01] because there's nothing greater than
[44:02] what he says
[44:04] nothing can destroy it when omnipotence
[44:06] speaks
[44:08] miracles take place we have seen the
[44:10] miraculous of omnipotence
[44:13] every day of our lives amen the earth
[44:15] that we live on the sun
[44:17] the moon the stars all hang in place why
[44:20] because omnipotence spoke
[44:22] and it put it there you know i got to
[44:24] look at about it you know and of course
[44:26] science always takes you back to a big
[44:29] bang theory you know it's a big bang
[44:30] that two
[44:31] particles happen to meet and the
[44:33] vastness of what we have here
[44:35] they happened to get together somehow
[44:37] and a big explosion took place
[44:39] and it put out all the things that we
[44:41] got today now i agree with him it was a
[44:43] big bang but it wasn't the bang they're
[44:45] thinking about
[44:46] it was let there be and the explosion
[44:49] took place amen
[44:50] you know today scientists say the milky
[44:52] way galaxy which is what our
[44:55] earth abides in apparently or as far as
[44:57] they can figure
[44:58] is about 100 000 to 150 000 light years
[45:03] in diameter now one light year is 5.8
[45:06] trillion miles
[45:09] that's quite vast and that's just the
[45:12] galaxy and then they say
[45:13] that their best guess is the known
[45:15] universe is 98 billion
[45:18] light years in diameter now one light
[45:21] year is 5.8 trillion miles
[45:24] but they're willing to admit that as far
[45:26] as they can see with their best advances
[45:29] in science and come to the conclusion
[45:32] that there actually
[45:33] is no limitation to galaxies and to the
[45:35] stars
[45:37] amen they say it was a big bang but it
[45:39] was when omnipotence spoke
[45:42] and creation took place and and the very
[45:45] thing that you can look out at night and
[45:47] you can see and
[45:48] and the vastness of it is speaking of an
[45:50] unlimited god
[45:52] that has unlimited resources it has
[45:55] unlimited
[45:56] abilities and that doesn't change today
[45:58] just because the world gets more
[46:00] advanced and the things and it takes
[46:02] away from the things of god
[46:04] and the and the miraculous things of god
[46:06] god don't change
[46:08] he's still just as powerful today as
[46:10] he's always been
[46:11] this is why he would even put in his
[46:13] word the word the word all because
[46:15] in all it means all things it means
[46:18] everything
[46:19] it means everything that can be it's all
[46:21] i mean you can't get
[46:22] no further really than the word all
[46:24] because it's almost like an
[46:26] unending word so to speak and he was he
[46:28] would say it in his word and i love it i
[46:30] love it i mentioned it many times but
[46:32] he said i'm the lord god that heals all
[46:34] thy diseases
[46:36] now only omnipotence could say that and
[46:38] back it up
[46:40] because because to be able to say you
[46:42] can heal all diseases
[46:43] means you have to have the power to heal
[46:45] all diseases
[46:47] amen man cannot heal disease only god
[46:49] can heal
[46:50] man can assist man can do whatever the
[46:52] best of his knowledge amen
[46:54] but only god can speak the word all and
[46:57] back it up because he is
[46:59] unlimited therefore no matter what satan
[47:01] kind i love how he did it because he put
[47:03] a trap for satan
[47:04] because satan is constantly coming up
[47:06] with new diseases news afflictions
[47:09] news viruses new troubles knew this knew
[47:12] that
[47:12] but it's all included in all amen you
[47:15] can take him right back to the word here
[47:17] and he can come up with a new one you
[47:18] say well
[47:19] it fits right here amen even in sin he
[47:22] said he
[47:22] he he he cleanses all iniquity
[47:26] amen so there's no sin no nothing too
[47:28] great that this god can't do i
[47:30] i don't know about you that makes me
[47:32] rejoice because i realize no matter how
[47:34] bad my past was
[47:36] no matter how many failures i have no
[47:38] matter how many problems and situation
[47:40] it all goes in all that god is able to
[47:43] rewrite my life
[47:45] mercy is great enough god is great
[47:47] enough his power is great enough
[47:49] his blood is great enough amen to cover
[47:52] all
[47:52] sin hallelujah
[47:56] so when when omnipotence speaks the
[47:59] miraculous goes forth
[48:01] omnipotence is all-powerful and it takes
[48:04] the miraculous
[48:05] to show that omnipotence is there
[48:08] amen what if he would have spoke and
[48:10] nothing happened then he would not be
[48:12] omnipotent but something happened
[48:15] and then a clinker went forth and this
[48:17] one went out and that went to where even
[48:19] today
[48:20] man and his greatest abilities say we
[48:22] can't even get to the end of it all
[48:26] we can't even get to where where we can
[48:28] say yes that's the end of it we can't
[48:30] amen if i firmly say this is all of it
[48:40] then how in the world if science can't
[48:42] get to the end
[48:43] of the universe we live in how in the
[48:46] world can men get to the end of the
[48:48] miracles
[48:49] and say days of miracles are past and
[48:52] put limitations on god
[48:54] and say god don't move that way no more
[48:57] and when science can't even get to the
[48:58] end of things
[48:59] how does man get to the end of his word
[49:01] and say that's it and put a period there
[49:04] god is unlimited
[49:07] and it's time the church of god takes
[49:10] the limitations
[49:11] off of god i believe it's time we take
[49:14] the limitations off our services
[49:17] and say god you're a god you move how
[49:20] you want to move
[49:21] i just want to be there i want you to
[49:23] touch me i want to be part of it
[49:26] but i'm not going to put limitations on
[49:28] what you can do
[49:30] i'm not gonna put how many how many
[49:33] limitations on how many miracles
[49:35] you can perform in a day or service or
[49:38] in my life
[49:39] and what you can do i'm not putting
[49:41] limitations there
[49:42] on an unlimited god but i need this
[49:45] unlimited god i need him to move in my
[49:48] life
[49:48] i need him to touch my body
[49:52] i need him to speak so the miraculous
[49:55] can come forth
[49:57] i need him to say the words of god to my
[50:00] heart
[50:00] so i can believe all things are possible
[50:04] did you hear his word all things are
[50:06] possible
[50:10] hallelujah when omnipotence speaks the
[50:13] miraculous takes forth
[50:14] and we must have the miraculous
[50:18] amen we must have the miraculous
[50:21] you know i believe brother adam will say
[50:23] it like this he said i believe
[50:24] that the church is now standing on the
[50:27] threshold
[50:28] of the greatest vindication of
[50:30] omnipotence the world
[50:32] has ever known think about that
[50:35] statement right there
[50:37] i just read to you the world's trying to
[50:39] re figure out his omnipotence and his
[50:41] limitations by looking at the stars and
[50:43] the universe
[50:44] and they still haven't got there yet and
[50:46] the prophet of god said we're getting to
[50:48] the place
[50:48] that we're going to see the greatest
[50:50] vindication of omnipotence that the
[50:52] world has ever known
[50:55] hallelujah he said i believe as a
[50:57] minister of the gospel
[50:59] we're living now where is this going to
[51:00] take place he goes on to say it
[51:02] we're living just at the near appearing
[51:05] of the second time or the second coming
[51:08] of the lord jesus
[51:12] and you know he would go on in the
[51:13] sermon the junction of time
[51:15] he would begin to talk about junctions
[51:17] and at every junction
[51:18] the voice of god would speak and
[51:21] omnipotence would follow
[51:23] would show the miraculous omnipotence
[51:26] would speak
[51:28] and and it would move and it would save
[51:30] and it would touch and
[51:31] it didn't matter how many men had tried
[51:33] to deny how many men said it wasn't so
[51:36] how many men said god lost his power how
[51:39] many rose up and said he ain't here no
[51:40] more when omnipotent spoke the
[51:42] miraculous took place
[51:49] amen he said well you see him he first
[51:52] time he'd come as a baby
[51:54] he said but this time he's coming as the
[51:56] king of glory
[51:57] and he's going to take vengeance upon
[51:59] all who will not obey the word of god
[52:02] he said we would believe that with all
[52:03] this great turmoil
[52:05] we're living in today and as we look
[52:07] around on every hand
[52:08] pick up the newspapers and now the
[52:10] internet just still still stand still
[52:13] you can drop our everyday hustle and
[52:15] bustle this neurotic age
[52:17] and look out and face facts we see
[52:20] beyond any shadow of doubt
[52:22] something is just about to happen
[52:27] the junctions a junction is about to
[52:29] take place amen you know
[52:33] when junctions are the old are into a
[52:35] new a junction or another dispensation
[52:38] and every one of them he shows his power
[52:41] and every one of them has a display
[52:43] of his omnipotence or a display of his
[52:46] ability
[52:47] amen that in the middle of all the
[52:49] naysaying in the middle of all the
[52:50] things that were going on
[52:52] even in noah's day when men with science
[52:54] was at his height
[52:56] was that his very pinnacle and men were
[52:58] doing unbelievable things
[53:00] and they they say doing things that we
[53:01] haven't even got to today
[53:05] now it's mind-blowing but that's what
[53:07] that's that's what they say
[53:11] doing things that we're not even into
[53:14] beyond where we're even at
[53:17] and men were saying god's no more and
[53:20] they were they were as
[53:21] as jesus would say there was a given in
[53:23] marriage and drunkenness and all the
[53:25] things that were taking place
[53:26] until where god said i'm done with it
[53:29] and a dispensation was to take place
[53:31] and a changing amen when the earth would
[53:34] be up they come up
[53:35] be baptized by water amen but in that
[53:38] omnipotent spoke
[53:40] and noah found grace in the eyes of god
[53:43] and omnipotence spoke and it saved noah
[53:46] in the flood
[53:47] it saved noah in his trouble it saved
[53:49] noah and god
[53:50] showed the great miraculous signs of the
[53:53] god
[53:53] of heaven i mean think about all the
[53:56] things that took place
[53:57] amen when when a man would all of a
[53:59] sudden get up come out one morning and
[54:01] get his cup of coffee and he'd look his
[54:03] wife in the eye and he said god spoke to
[54:05] me last night
[54:06] he said well he did we ain't heard from
[54:08] god in a long time he said well
[54:10] it may be so but let me tell you god
[54:11] spoke to me well what did he tell you
[54:13] he told me to go get some gopher wood
[54:16] and go and do this and he went through
[54:17] all and build an ark
[54:20] an ark what's an ark an ark is a boat
[54:23] it's a place
[54:24] where when the waters of judgment is
[54:26] going to come and it's going to fall
[54:28] rain from heaven
[54:29] what rain from heaven amen what are you
[54:31] talking about this has never happened
[54:33] before
[54:35] this is impossible what do you do and he
[54:37] takes it and he begins to do it
[54:38] and then brother adam said that was a
[54:40] sign of the miraculous
[54:41] that in the middle of all that doubt
[54:44] there was a man that heard from god
[54:49] ah hallelujah what about a sign in this
[54:51] generation
[54:52] in the middle of all the doubt and the
[54:54] confusion there's a people that say
[54:56] i've heard from god and judgment is
[54:59] coming upon this earth
[55:01] and you better get into the ark
[55:07] he said that was one of the greatest
[55:09] miraculous things that took place
[55:11] the show of omnipotence that a man was
[55:14] out there beating a nail in some wood
[55:18] hello i mean that's kind of mind-blowing
[55:21] when you think about the universe
[55:22] versus a nail and some wood
[55:26] but omnipotences spoke and the
[55:28] miraculous has taken place
[55:30] and it was during a time that people's
[55:32] hearts had waxed cold
[55:34] and got away from god and women were
[55:36] becoming an idol
[55:39] sons of god seen the daughters of men
[55:41] that they were fair
[55:42] and it become a sexual thing and jesus
[55:45] said before noah's time at the end
[55:47] they were given marrying and giving in
[55:49] marriage
[55:50] and the great turmoil that was going on
[55:53] the miraculous was taking place
[55:57] because omnipotence spoke and he said
[55:59] these things are going to happen again
[56:01] in this
[56:02] day as jesus prophesied it to be so
[56:05] he said as it was in the days of noah so
[56:07] shall it be
[56:10] so there's great turmoil again there's
[56:12] evil spirits that are entered into
[56:14] people
[56:15] and doing the same works that they did
[56:17] in that day
[56:18] he said but notice not only that he said
[56:21] when all hell turns loose
[56:23] all heaven turns loose
[56:26] oh hallelujah and let me tell you right
[56:29] now
[56:29] while we were on this subject hell is
[56:32] limited
[56:33] [Applause]
[56:36] all hell can turn loose but it's got
[56:38] limitations upon it
[56:39] but when all heaven turns loose it has
[56:42] no limitations
[56:45] there is no limit to what god can do
[56:48] there is limits to what satan can do
[56:52] hallelujah satan already had you one
[56:54] time but he had limits upon him
[56:56] he can only take you so far he can only
[56:59] do so much
[57:00] but when god gets a hold of you when god
[57:03] grabs your life
[57:04] there's so many there's no limitations
[57:12] he said when the enemy comes in like a
[57:13] flood the spirit of god raises the
[57:16] standard of it so it shows
[57:17] that in every junction both forces are
[57:20] at work
[57:21] but one has limits one has no limits
[57:25] hallelujah
[57:27] amen it showed because
[57:31] in the middle of all of that as we just
[57:33] heard amen
[57:34] in it was walking with god and he was
[57:37] not
[57:39] because god took him
[57:44] showed there was no limits to god he
[57:46] could take a man
[57:48] and change his whole molecule make up to
[57:50] where he just
[57:51] took him
[57:54] he said at the same time evil was
[57:56] appearing
[57:58] angels were appearing
[58:01] we've been hearing that right so don't
[58:03] get your eyes just on the evil
[58:05] realize when evil's appearing there's
[58:07] angels also appearing
[58:09] amen angels being moved into men
[58:14] moving in men angels appearing on earth
[58:17] this is a very beautiful type of the day
[58:19] noah was preaching a message that seemed
[58:21] so crazy
[58:22] to the world sounds like our message
[58:27] people that are crazy it's idiotic
[58:31] it's old-fashioned it's old folky ideas
[58:36] it's really quite opposite of what noah
[58:38] know it was kind of on the cutting edge
[58:40] of technology
[58:43] and they didn't see it then amen here he
[58:47] was right at the very edge of
[58:49] the only thing that could save you was a
[58:51] boat
[58:54] and here noah was preparing the ark and
[58:56] brother of adam said that's the miracle
[58:58] he said that how a man upon dry land
[59:01] where water had never come
[59:03] rain and never fallen was putting nails
[59:06] in some wood
[59:07] preparing a heart to float on the mighty
[59:09] sea where there was no sea
[59:13] amen but by faith noah was warned of god
[59:18] and no matter how foolish it seemed or
[59:20] how fanatical it seemed
[59:22] it was a miracle in itself to see a man
[59:24] hammering away
[59:25] something that seemed so fanatic
[59:27] fanatical
[59:29] and it's repeated again when men are
[59:31] pounding away at the gospel of the lord
[59:34] jesus christ
[59:35] and they're preaching the baptism of the
[59:37] holy ghost and they're getting people
[59:39] ready for the coming judgment
[59:41] or a shield from it anyways he said a
[59:43] modern church people are laughing
[59:45] and making fun and saying there's
[59:47] nothing to it and days of miracles are
[59:49] passed but i say preacher
[59:51] keep on putting the nails in
[59:54] keep on hammering away the appeal have
[59:57] to have the holy ghost
[59:58] the token they go in the rapture keep on
[1:00:01] hammering away
[1:00:02] that jesus christ is the same yesterday
[1:00:04] to tell him forever
[1:00:05] keep hammering he heals he delivers
[1:00:08] he's safe he does it all
[1:00:13] amen we got to keep hammering at it i
[1:00:15] don't care who walks away
[1:00:17] who laughs and who makes fun they did it
[1:00:19] before
[1:00:20] but they did it again but there's a no
[1:00:22] one that's going to stay right there
[1:00:24] and say this is my word i've heard from
[1:00:26] it and i'm gonna keep hammering
[1:00:30] hallelujah till that last board gets in
[1:00:33] place
[1:00:34] and he says come on in
[1:00:43] hallelujah that's not just on preachers
[1:00:45] that's also on your father's at home
[1:00:47] keep hammering keep hammering bible
[1:00:51] holiness
[1:00:54] keep hammering caught in this
[1:01:05] he says we know we're working not only
[1:01:07] was performing the
[1:01:08] miracle but then while it was having it
[1:01:11] he was also looking for a miracle
[1:01:14] hallelujah and the church today he says
[1:01:17] is laboring
[1:01:18] away under the task of preaching the
[1:01:20] gospel signs and wonders following
[1:01:22] but they're also preparing for a miracle
[1:01:25] the rapture of the church they're going
[1:01:27] away to home
[1:01:29] preparing people getting them to the
[1:01:30] light unburden them from the things of
[1:01:33] the world
[1:01:33] getting their soul set on the presence
[1:01:35] of god and when jesus does appear in the
[1:01:37] second time in glory
[1:01:38] those who are ready who are ready will
[1:01:41] rapture and will be caught up together
[1:01:43] to meet him in the air and to be with
[1:01:45] him for eternity
[1:01:48] my god
[1:01:52] but as it wasn't noah's time so to be
[1:01:54] now
[1:01:56] eating drinking marriage giving in
[1:01:58] marriage
[1:01:59] all these things you see are signposts
[1:02:03] evil getting increasingly worse
[1:02:05] signposts
[1:02:09] but supernatural miracles hanging right
[1:02:11] before us today
[1:02:12] signpost the second coming of the lord
[1:02:16] jesus christ speaking of the saints
[1:02:17] speaking or pointing towards
[1:02:19] the second coming of the lord jesus
[1:02:20] christ and we're at a junction again
[1:02:24] but as noah began to warn people and
[1:02:26] preach many of them laughed at him and
[1:02:28] scoffed at him because his message
[1:02:30] seemed entirely
[1:02:32] out of reason or may i say it like this
[1:02:36] even maybe out of season
[1:02:39] out of the time that you would expect it
[1:02:41] because why would a man build an ark
[1:02:44] when there's never been no rain and he's
[1:02:46] on dry land he's not even by the ocean
[1:02:48] perhaps
[1:02:50] he's on dry land putting this thing up
[1:02:53] why because god said so
[1:02:57] amen he said why
[1:03:00] he said he said and then he said today
[1:03:03] he said how people today when they
[1:03:05] should
[1:03:05] then they say they got the best doctors
[1:03:07] in the world we got the best clinics
[1:03:09] we've ever had
[1:03:10] we got more knowledge than we ever had
[1:03:12] we got more abilities than we ever had
[1:03:16] why do we need divine healing he said
[1:03:18] today we need divine healing worse than
[1:03:20] we ever needed it
[1:03:23] and as the day goes on and on it'll be
[1:03:25] more and more needed
[1:03:28] but noah just went right on the morning
[1:03:30] folks it's going to rain
[1:03:33] he'd get turned down it's going to rain
[1:03:35] people didn't even know what rain meant
[1:03:38] it was a new word didn't even know what
[1:03:42] rain meant
[1:03:42] never rain before there's people in the
[1:03:44] world today he said after 2
[1:03:46] 000 years of gospel preaching they don't
[1:03:48] even know what it means to be born again
[1:03:56] oh my god and that's the truth
[1:04:01] oh yeah well you know just you're saved
[1:04:03] once always saved
[1:04:05] you believe the message you're saved and
[1:04:08] they bring their baptist ideas and their
[1:04:10] methodist ideas and their pentecostal
[1:04:13] right into the message but
[1:04:16] when he said you must be born again
[1:04:19] and he said even after 2 000 years of
[1:04:21] gospel preaching
[1:04:22] people still don't know what that means
[1:04:25] and even after
[1:04:26] a hundred and years or 120 years people
[1:04:28] still didn't know what rain
[1:04:30] meant
[1:04:36] they don't know what omnipotence means
[1:04:38] they don't know a god
[1:04:40] that is omnipotent they don't know a god
[1:04:43] that can transform a soul from a
[1:04:44] straight center
[1:04:46] to an angelic position hello somebody
[1:04:50] amen the kingdom into the
[1:04:54] in the gods kingdom as sons and
[1:04:55] daughters of god they don't understand
[1:04:57] it
[1:04:58] they never have been there they don't
[1:04:59] know
[1:05:02] maybe they've been taken up too much in
[1:05:04] the things of the world and
[1:05:05] infatuated with and flirting in the
[1:05:07] glaring don't realize that's an evil
[1:05:09] spirit
[1:05:10] and but it's a great marking signpost
[1:05:13] for the people this day to watch and be
[1:05:15] ready
[1:05:16] because jesus said when those things
[1:05:17] come to pass look up
[1:05:20] your redemption draweth nigh we're at a
[1:05:23] junction
[1:05:28] but here's another miracle
[1:05:31] omnipotence all-powerful
[1:05:35] gave the plan and the day came he said
[1:05:38] noah
[1:05:39] get in the ark
[1:05:42] and out came two by two every animal
[1:05:46] what did that some
[1:05:50] you know i've seen one time as a child i
[1:05:52] believe it was a movie of noah
[1:05:53] walking through the ark playing some
[1:05:54] flute and all the animals was following
[1:05:56] that music
[1:05:57] baloney
[1:06:03] no no it was omnipotence it was back to
[1:06:07] to the point really where god came down
[1:06:09] in such a way to where it was almost
[1:06:10] back and i i i
[1:06:12] just say it like there's an eating
[1:06:13] condition
[1:06:16] omnipotence moving showing his power
[1:06:20] over all nature
[1:06:21] to where it says quick he could quicken
[1:06:23] a lion's heart and say get in the ark
[1:06:27] amen and that he listened he sure did we
[1:06:30] went right in there
[1:06:31] some people got more ain't got enough
[1:06:33] sense of the line or a mule or a donkey
[1:06:35] or whatever
[1:06:37] a donkey yeah even a donkey can hear the
[1:06:39] voice of god
[1:06:41] yeah we've seen that in the bible and
[1:06:43] but the voice of god omnipotence can
[1:06:45] speak
[1:06:46] he spoke and how many how many went on
[1:06:48] the ark
[1:06:49] but how many heard how many heard the
[1:06:51] message
[1:06:54] people now how many went on the ark
[1:06:58] how many heard the message
[1:07:02] a bunch shall we say thousands i don't
[1:07:06] know how many it was
[1:07:11] and then i i wonder how many i this
[1:07:14] i said this before but it still blows my
[1:07:16] mind that when you witness
[1:07:18] animals walking on the ark two by two
[1:07:22] where's man's thinking at that moment
[1:07:26] because apparently something's going on
[1:07:27] in their mind because
[1:07:29] they they they're they're looking at the
[1:07:31] supernatural realm and they're not
[1:07:32] perceiving what that is
[1:07:34] that's exactly what can happen in the
[1:07:35] service the supernatural god fall in
[1:07:38] and it may not be animals walking two by
[1:07:41] two but it may
[1:07:42] be an old street prostitute or some
[1:07:43] sinner they may find their moment in
[1:07:45] christ or
[1:07:46] somebody be healed or delivered and they
[1:07:48] don't know what that
[1:07:49] is that's omnipotent speaking that's the
[1:07:52] all-powerful god
[1:07:54] moving in hearts it ought to do
[1:07:58] something
[1:08:03] but he said one of the greatest miracles
[1:08:05] was omnipotence that gave the plan
[1:08:08] and the magnificent said build it this
[1:08:10] long build it this high
[1:08:12] do it this way and it'll keep you
[1:08:15] if you'll follow my plan it'll keep you
[1:08:17] and the waters begin to come and the
[1:08:19] dell used floods
[1:08:21] plagues and every kind of thing was
[1:08:22] falling you know it was just rising
[1:08:25] above it all
[1:08:26] right amen here brother said the miracle
[1:08:29] was in the middle of the flood
[1:08:31] noah was tucked away in the ark of
[1:08:33] safety
[1:08:34] thunder was going on flags were falling
[1:08:37] rain was falling
[1:08:38] noah was resting noah had found play
[1:08:42] a place in the middle of the storm that
[1:08:44] he could find in the omnipotent god
[1:08:49] mercy jesus
[1:08:53] he said those that want to laugh at you
[1:08:55] and make fun of you today but maybe
[1:08:56] maybe because the way you act cause you
[1:08:58] dress because you don't cut your hair
[1:08:59] because whatever
[1:09:01] they don't realize you're tucked away
[1:09:05] in omnipotence
[1:09:08] don't realize you're restless resting
[1:09:11] safely as you can be in omnipotence
[1:09:13] and nothing can harm you
[1:09:18] the water begins to come the people
[1:09:19] began to scream cry holler
[1:09:21] carry on instead of the ark just staying
[1:09:23] there it floated right up
[1:09:25] all the time packing noah and cradled
[1:09:27] him along the waves
[1:09:29] sure it was a signpost and god swept the
[1:09:32] world clean of sin
[1:09:33] and he was going to start a new one and
[1:09:35] signs and wonders appeared
[1:09:37] before he did it
[1:09:43] it was another a time of junction was
[1:09:46] that abraham
[1:09:48] when god would call abraham out from
[1:09:50] among his kindred and say hey
[1:09:51] i have your land i have your place that
[1:09:54] you can go to
[1:09:55] omnipotence spoke to him
[1:09:58] and he called him out of his own people
[1:10:00] to walk with god
[1:10:03] oh my how we can take testimony after
[1:10:05] testimony of people that are sitting in
[1:10:07] this building
[1:10:08] they don't have daddies that believe the
[1:10:09] message
[1:10:11] they don't have ken folks that believe
[1:10:13] the message but omnipotence spoke to him
[1:10:15] and said come walk with me
[1:10:19] hallelujah this was abraham get out of
[1:10:21] him come out of that
[1:10:23] place and come walk with me abraham and
[1:10:25] he told he said i'm going to make you a
[1:10:27] father
[1:10:27] of many nations amen only the way he
[1:10:30] could speak it
[1:10:30] is he had to perform it or otherwise he
[1:10:34] wouldn't be omnipotent
[1:10:35] he wouldn't be all powerful if he
[1:10:37] couldn't do what he said he would do
[1:10:39] and then not only that he told sarah
[1:10:41] that she was going to bear her son
[1:10:42] and though she was bearing odd
[1:10:44] omnipotent spoke
[1:10:46] and it came to pass oh hallelujah
[1:10:50] that tells me that he's still omnipotent
[1:10:52] today
[1:10:53] and if he's still omnipotent today
[1:10:55] because he said he's the same
[1:10:56] yesterday today and forever then if he
[1:10:59] spoke against
[1:10:59] baroness and baroness had to flee
[1:11:02] tonight he's still the same
[1:11:03] god
[1:11:06] amen i can witness him to be the same
[1:11:08] god because i see a people sitting here
[1:11:11] that was one time unfruitful and barren
[1:11:14] and
[1:11:14] omnipotent spoke over your life and said
[1:11:16] you will bring forth fruit
[1:11:19] you will bring forth eternal life
[1:11:25] and they were changed back from an old
[1:11:29] man and woman
[1:11:30] to be able to bring forth seed again
[1:11:34] we see another one it was a junction
[1:11:39] for 400 years of prophecy it went forth
[1:11:41] and laid dormant
[1:11:45] seemed like it was uh god just moved off
[1:11:47] the scene
[1:11:49] nobody heard from him his people went
[1:11:52] off into slavery
[1:11:53] his his uh seed his elect
[1:11:58] his people had went off into slavery
[1:12:02] been lured into egypt been made slaves
[1:12:06] and it seemed like god had forgotten him
[1:12:09] but he never forgot first thing
[1:12:13] he he came down a supernatural sign to
[1:12:16] show again he was omnipotent and that he
[1:12:18] lived
[1:12:19] and maybe the priests and the rabbis and
[1:12:21] forces of that day thought that god
[1:12:23] no longer existed just like you may do
[1:12:26] today
[1:12:29] but god is still omnipotent no matter
[1:12:31] what your thought says
[1:12:35] he still performs miracles no matter
[1:12:37] what your doubt says
[1:12:40] amen they thought he'd gone out of
[1:12:41] existence but right in the middle of all
[1:12:44] that chaos in the middle of all that
[1:12:45] struggle
[1:12:46] in the middle of all that trouble he
[1:12:48] comes down to a lowly humble
[1:12:50] family of levi and he gives him a son
[1:12:54] and said his name will be moses
[1:12:57] and omnipotence spoke and said this will
[1:12:59] be my deliverer
[1:13:03] prophecy came to fulfillment
[1:13:07] and it goes out and it seemed like
[1:13:09] nothing was yet still happening
[1:13:11] the boy got put in the nile but
[1:13:13] omnipotence was always there
[1:13:16] amen crocodiles would come look sniff
[1:13:18] the basket but omnipotence was there
[1:13:21] amen until it was taken right to the
[1:13:22] pharaoh's daughter and raised up in the
[1:13:24] house of pharaoh
[1:13:26] god right under the nose of satan
[1:13:28] raising his own destruction
[1:13:31] oh hallelujah right under the nose of
[1:13:34] satan
[1:13:34] god was raising his own leader to lead
[1:13:37] his people out of bondage
[1:13:39] amen it seemed like it was went to
[1:13:41] nothing when he killed two egyptians but
[1:13:43] god got him out on the backside of a
[1:13:44] desert
[1:13:45] so he could hear from god for himself
[1:13:47] that omnipotence could speak to him
[1:13:50] and show him the miraculous
[1:13:56] and he came and he showed it to him
[1:14:00] showed him the days of miracles wouldn't
[1:14:01] pass no more put his hand in this
[1:14:04] in his bosom that came out leprosy put
[1:14:06] his hand back in there and it came out
[1:14:08] clean
[1:14:08] he would throw a rod down it would turn
[1:14:10] to a serpent he'd pick it back up and it
[1:14:12] turned to a rod
[1:14:13] he was showing him and all the way
[1:14:14] through the ten plagues i'm omnipotent i
[1:14:17] can create flies out of nothing
[1:14:18] i can create frogs out of nothing
[1:14:22] amen god showed right there he don't
[1:14:24] have to have anything to work with
[1:14:28] he also shows it today he don't have to
[1:14:30] have anything to work with
[1:14:33] amen he wants somebody that's willing
[1:14:37] amen and here he was amen brother adam
[1:14:39] said you know they had the word
[1:14:41] they had joseph's bones them things are
[1:14:44] all right
[1:14:45] there were signs yes that god still
[1:14:46] lived and but still beside the word they
[1:14:49] had
[1:14:49] but besides all of that they had an
[1:14:51] omnipotent god
[1:14:53] who would not fail them who was the same
[1:14:56] yesterday today and forever
[1:14:58] and he stood in the midst of them
[1:15:02] he attached himself to their struggle
[1:15:08] and he became their their deliverer
[1:15:11] and he destroyed egypt and changed the
[1:15:14] whole scene
[1:15:18] performed miracle after miracle sign
[1:15:21] after sign
[1:15:25] he said it's amazing he said a man can
[1:15:29] think he can comprehend
[1:15:31] an unlimited god he said to do that
[1:15:35] you have to come in contact for yourself
[1:15:38] with his omnipotence
[1:15:43] then when you do that you're in contact
[1:15:46] with supernatural realms
[1:15:48] you're in contact and your life will
[1:15:50] change your thinking will change
[1:15:52] your mind will change you'll be made
[1:15:54] different your sickness
[1:15:56] is finished
[1:15:59] god's great power moves in when moses
[1:16:03] saw him at the burning bush he saw an
[1:16:04] omnipotent god
[1:16:06] he saw the miraculous and he went down
[1:16:08] there to take those signs to set god's
[1:16:11] people free
[1:16:13] he now saw it for himself his mama told
[1:16:16] him about it his daddy had told him
[1:16:17] about it but now he met
[1:16:19] god for himself
[1:16:25] this is why people fall off the side
[1:16:27] roads
[1:16:28] young people especially maybe older
[1:16:31] folks alike
[1:16:32] because they've been told about it
[1:16:35] they've been preached about it
[1:16:37] they they they they've heard about it
[1:16:40] all their life
[1:16:41] been raised up in it but they haven't
[1:16:44] seen it for
[1:16:46] themselves i'm not talking about seeing
[1:16:49] it for themselves in somebody
[1:16:50] else that's awesome too i mean
[1:16:54] yes sir you can see god is omnipotent we
[1:16:56] saw it many times in our own
[1:16:58] congregation when god would come down
[1:17:00] and heal the sick but what about god
[1:17:02] being omnipotent in your life
[1:17:07] amen this is where he wants to get to
[1:17:10] and so therefore he would come in
[1:17:12] another junction and there's others but
[1:17:13] i'll
[1:17:14] move on down because we're running out
[1:17:15] of time he'd come in one of the greatest
[1:17:17] junctions in man's history
[1:17:19] was when he came down to be a savior
[1:17:23] and jesus and and what happened it was
[1:17:25] in a dark time again it was
[1:17:27] in a political unrest it was do you
[1:17:30] notice what happens
[1:17:31] it always comes junctions happen in
[1:17:32] those times
[1:17:35] moses
[1:17:39] all the noah's abrahams
[1:17:43] oh now jesus political unrest
[1:17:48] you know things that are going on that
[1:17:50] they can't make sense or heads or tails
[1:17:52] out of and
[1:17:53] and then even there when they're
[1:17:54] expecting him to come but when he comes
[1:17:56] they're not expecting to come that way
[1:17:59] they're
[1:17:59] looking forward to when you're going to
[1:18:01] get where what you're doing you're
[1:18:02] healing a few people where
[1:18:03] that's wonderful signs and things are
[1:18:05] taking place but when's the romans
[1:18:10] leaving that was looking for a temporary
[1:18:13] deliverance
[1:18:15] instead of eternal deliverance hey man
[1:18:18] that's what god wants you to have more
[1:18:20] than just a temporary deliverance
[1:18:22] god wants you to have something that's
[1:18:24] eternal and eternal is omnipotence
[1:18:27] amen that's what the holy ghost is is
[1:18:29] eternal therefore
[1:18:31] the holy ghost is omnipotence amen
[1:18:35] but it would come in a time when the
[1:18:37] miraculous
[1:18:39] would seem so far away it would seem so
[1:18:42] impossible
[1:18:43] laws and judges and and people that were
[1:18:46] there and all the things that were
[1:18:47] taking place
[1:18:48] and the priests and their ideas and and
[1:18:50] things were saying well days and
[1:18:51] miracles were passed there hadn't been a
[1:18:53] prophet for hundreds of years
[1:18:59] and at the same time an angel appears to
[1:19:02] a priest
[1:19:04] angels start appearing things start
[1:19:07] taking
[1:19:08] place the vast majority are missing it
[1:19:11] they expect them to come with a a salute
[1:19:14] from heaven and coming down stepping on
[1:19:16] red red robes and or purple robes and
[1:19:18] red carpet
[1:19:19] and walk down to caiaphas and say i'm
[1:19:21] here give him my sword
[1:19:22] i'm going to drive the romans out that
[1:19:24] wasn't the way he came
[1:19:26] angels started appearing it appeared to
[1:19:28] zechariah zachary
[1:19:29] zacharias and it appeared to a little a
[1:19:31] virgin named mary
[1:19:33] and it appeared to some shepherds on a
[1:19:34] hill amen things began to take place but
[1:19:37] the vast majority was missing it
[1:19:41] not even knowing omnipotence was about
[1:19:43] to come in human flesh
[1:19:50] and you know what omnipotence first
[1:19:51] words were on earth
[1:19:54] wow
[1:19:59] a cry of a baby this is why brother
[1:20:02] brandon would pick it up and he said you
[1:20:04] know
[1:20:04] he said people missed it because it was
[1:20:06] they missed him being jehovah because it
[1:20:07] was jehovah
[1:20:08] has a baby it was jehovah as a teenager
[1:20:11] running down a road falling
[1:20:13] and skinning his knees
[1:20:16] it was jehovah and human flesh
[1:20:19] the greatest one of the greatest
[1:20:21] junctions ever happened before
[1:20:23] and god about to show his omnipotent
[1:20:26] power
[1:20:31] and angels come and begin to prophesy a
[1:20:34] prophet comes on the scene
[1:20:35] and they thought he was crazy
[1:20:40] i know some people as they say are
[1:20:41] getting offended about creepy john
[1:20:43] let me tell you he wasn't exactly sane
[1:20:45] sounding kind of person
[1:20:47] man is out in the wilderness and eating
[1:20:49] wild
[1:20:51] honey and locusts and all that kind of
[1:20:52] stuff and all no doubt all kind of
[1:20:54] stories circulating about him
[1:20:58] and he wasn't exactly uh how a normal
[1:21:00] person would operate
[1:21:03] because he wasn't normal
[1:21:07] and let me let you just in on something
[1:21:08] you ain't normal either
[1:21:13] at least i hope you're not normal to
[1:21:15] this world
[1:21:18] matter of fact it ought to put a
[1:21:19] rejoicing in my our heart to realize
[1:21:21] i am not normal compared to this world
[1:21:25] but i am normal compared to where i come
[1:21:28] from
[1:21:28] [Applause]
[1:21:32] hallelujah i've said it before amen when
[1:21:35] you go overseas you go to romania i've
[1:21:37] been to russia
[1:21:38] and you go over there i'm not normal i
[1:21:40] don't talk normal i don't look normal
[1:21:42] i don't act normal i have funny
[1:21:44] mannerisms i have all kinds of stuff
[1:21:48] and even in the united states there's
[1:21:49] places i ain't normal
[1:21:53] let's just be honest you don't have to
[1:21:55] cross
[1:21:56] too far in line we just go out over to
[1:21:58] mississippi and you won't be normal no
[1:21:59] more ain't that right
[1:22:03] hey that's why brother joe's the way
[1:22:05] he's in he's not from louisiana he's
[1:22:06] from mississippi
[1:22:11] amen but the weight reason i am the way
[1:22:13] i am
[1:22:15] and let's get beyond the humanity
[1:22:18] amen be the reason we're not the normal
[1:22:21] as far as far as the world's considered
[1:22:23] normal
[1:22:25] let me tell you what's normal to the
[1:22:26] world anymore is a man thinking himself
[1:22:29] to be a woman racing with women
[1:22:32] and that's considered normal
[1:22:36] let me tell you what's considered normal
[1:22:38] to the world is a woman to cut off her
[1:22:40] hair and
[1:22:40] wear men's apparel and think herself to
[1:22:42] still be a woman
[1:22:44] that's considered normal it's considered
[1:22:46] so much normal that even when we look at
[1:22:48] it
[1:22:48] we don't even hardly don't hardly turn
[1:22:50] their stomach no more because we've seen
[1:22:52] it so much
[1:22:53] it's become a sense of normality about
[1:22:55] it
[1:22:57] but the man does the other side it won't
[1:23:00] be too long and that'll be normal
[1:23:05] it's the truth
[1:23:09] but i'm not normal when it comes to this
[1:23:10] world
[1:23:13] i don't ever plan on being normal john
[1:23:16] the baptist wasn't no jesus wasn't
[1:23:18] normal
[1:23:19] amen when he went in amen and turned
[1:23:21] over their
[1:23:22] theirs carts and destroyed their temple
[1:23:24] that wasn't a normal thing to do
[1:23:30] when he went in he would go to the pool
[1:23:31] of bethesda and he would heal that man
[1:23:33] that wasn't a normal kind of day
[1:23:36] when he would go there and he'd heal a
[1:23:37] blind man or or read another day about
[1:23:40] the withered arm he'd come into this
[1:23:42] into the synagogue and he said stretch
[1:23:43] forth your hand and it would stretch
[1:23:45] that wasn't a normal kind of service to
[1:23:47] them
[1:23:48] it ought to be but it wasn't
[1:23:52] it ought to be normal in our churches to
[1:23:55] have healings
[1:23:57] it ought to be normal in our churches to
[1:23:59] have baptisms
[1:24:01] it ought to be normal in our churches to
[1:24:03] have somebody
[1:24:04] fall at an altar and say god i'm sorry
[1:24:08] it ought to be normal in our churches
[1:24:10] for people to worship god
[1:24:12] with all their hearts
[1:24:15] it ought to be normal to get beyond
[1:24:17] what's normal
[1:24:18] [Applause]
[1:24:26] that was all free the unbelievers waxed
[1:24:29] worse
[1:24:31] they downed it they fussed at it john
[1:24:34] the baptist they fussed at it jesus they
[1:24:36] fussed at it
[1:24:37] tried to get away finally would kill
[1:24:40] anyone that said anything
[1:24:42] but god moved on in the miraculous just
[1:24:44] the same for he's omnipotent
[1:24:46] he has to if he's god
[1:24:49] amen here he would come down as god
[1:24:53] to where and he would begin to express
[1:24:55] himself the omnipotence made flesh
[1:24:58] dwelling among us as a human
[1:25:02] you can't be normal and do that walking
[1:25:06] among us
[1:25:07] as he walked on the sea of galilee one
[1:25:09] night yonder little as he was out there
[1:25:11] on this old boat tossed about
[1:25:13] he acted like he didn't even pay any
[1:25:14] attention to it he was tired
[1:25:17] but something was about to happen and
[1:25:19] but when he put his foot upon the
[1:25:21] braille of that boat
[1:25:22] and he said peace be still he said i'll
[1:25:24] tell you the very creator of heavens and
[1:25:27] earth
[1:25:27] laid in that boat and all nature had to
[1:25:30] obey it
[1:25:32] just like it did with noah
[1:25:35] because it was the same omnipotence
[1:25:37] speaking and when omnipotence speaks
[1:25:39] miraculous takes place
[1:25:42] i remember the leper full of leprosy
[1:25:44] went to him one day and said lord if thy
[1:25:46] will make me clean
[1:25:47] he touched him and said i will be thou
[1:25:50] clean i've never just spoke
[1:25:52] and the miraculous took place and the
[1:25:54] leprosy
[1:25:55] vanished oh hallelujah
[1:25:58] i believe he's still that same kind of
[1:26:00] god
[1:26:02] listen we don't have to have treatment
[1:26:03] after treatment after treatment
[1:26:04] omnipotent speaks
[1:26:07] and it can vanish it's done it before
[1:26:11] it'll do it again
[1:26:15] when omnipotence speaks miraculous
[1:26:18] happens
[1:26:18] he healed the sick he raised the dead he
[1:26:21] opened the eyes of the blind
[1:26:22] proven to the people a junction is right
[1:26:25] here
[1:26:27] something is taking place
[1:26:39] he says in john 17 he looked up and said
[1:26:41] father

[1:26:50] ready
[1:26:52] the crossroad is here the world's been
[1:26:55] warned
[1:26:56] how will no any of these apostles when
[1:26:59] they've done signs and wonders

[1:27:02] back and forth the time is here
[1:27:05] the time has come brother brennan would
[1:27:08] bring it right to our day said brother

[1:27:22] answering
[1:27:22] and the miraculous has taken place we
[1:27:25] are at a junction
[1:27:29] hallelujah amen we had a junction in
[1:27:31] brother branham's day

[1:27:42] thousands have missed it
[1:27:44] millions have missed it

[1:27:55] going on wars and rumors of war there
[1:27:57] was all kinds of things going on

[1:28:18] and signs began to go forth and the sick
[1:28:20] were healed and the blind could see
[1:28:22] and all the things that would happen why

[1:29:50] doctor may be looking through x-rays or
[1:29:52] cat scans

[1:29:55] something greater he said
[1:29:57] those things are limited they can only
[1:29:59] find certain things but god can look at
[1:30:01] you
[1:30:02] and say it's this and it's that and it's

[1:30:19] what happened here when a little frail
[1:30:20] 90 pound year where a little woman came
[1:30:22] running around this building
[1:30:24] omnipotence had spoke to her
[1:30:27] and said why do you have to dread what
[1:30:29] do you have to fear
[1:30:30] you're leaning on the arms of your
[1:30:32] beloved

[1:31:12] omnipotence has spoken
[1:31:20] amen we was put here right in our midst
[1:31:22] the sign of a little girl that had lost
[1:31:24] her hair

[1:37:06] unlimited power
[1:37:10] he said his power is still the same
[1:37:13] tonight
[1:37:14] as it was the day he poured it out upon
[1:37:17] the church
[1:37:20] so every preacher that says it ain't go
[1:37:23] back and don't preach no more till you
[1:37:25] get christ
[1:37:29] hey that's exactly what somebody just
[1:37:31] sent me that from spurgeon i thought
[1:37:32] well that's good enough to use
[1:37:34] he said if christ ain't in your sermon
[1:37:36] he said you go home and don't say
[1:37:38] another word till you get christ in
[1:37:39] there
[1:37:41] and people that say the power ain't the
[1:37:43] same they ain't got christ
[1:37:45] the people that says his power is
[1:37:46] limited don't have christ
[1:37:48] the same the people that say that god
[1:37:50] don't heal no more god don't save no
[1:37:51] more mercy is over
[1:37:52] they don't have christ they might have a
[1:37:55] creed they might have a dogma they might
[1:37:56] have their own idea
[1:37:58] but they don't have jesus christ the
[1:38:00] same yesterday today and forever
[1:38:05] he said you people has tasted the realms
[1:38:07] of the golden cup of his blessings
[1:38:09] i mean it's been on that cup how could
[1:38:12] you believe anything else
[1:38:13] but what the holy ghost is here tonight
[1:38:15] to heal everyone
[1:38:18] let's take the limits off of him amen he
[1:38:21] said you how many has been drinking from
[1:38:23] that golden cup of his blessings
[1:38:25] he said how could you believe anything
[1:38:27] else but what the holy ghost is here
[1:38:29] tonight
[1:38:30] to heal everyone and
[1:38:33] to feel everyone whoa
[1:38:36] hallelujah if he's the same yesterday
[1:38:39] today and forever
[1:38:41] his power is the same he's unlimited
[1:38:44] his powers is just the same today as it
[1:38:47] ever was
[1:38:49] let him speak and let us be silent
[1:38:53] [Music]
[1:38:57] and he can speak
[1:39:01] hallelujah he said see
[1:39:06] he says in order to preach the gospel
[1:39:08] before you can make it a gospel
[1:39:09] to preach then you've got to have the
[1:39:11] power and demonstration the holy spirit
[1:39:13] to prove that is the gospel
[1:39:15] he said the letter killeth the word the
[1:39:18] letter killeth
[1:39:18] but the spirit maketh alive so it's not
[1:39:21] just a ritualistic affair
[1:39:25] but it's an absolutely real
[1:39:28] living reality of the resurrected christ
[1:39:31] jesus christ living among us that the
[1:39:33] faith that i'm going to try my best to
[1:39:35] contend for today
[1:39:37] that that jesus is the same yesterday
[1:39:39] today and forever
[1:39:41] and his power is unlimited
[1:39:47] he said if you can limit god you can
[1:39:48] limit christ and if you can limit the
[1:39:50] church today and its possibilities
[1:39:52] you are limiting god but all things
[1:39:54] whatsoever you desire when you pray
[1:39:56] believe to receive it and you shall have
[1:39:59] it
[1:40:03] he said brethren when when the brethren
[1:40:06] receive the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:40:08] and they begin to think this is the
[1:40:09] summit this
[1:40:11] is the all of it uh this
[1:40:14] quote about sent me into a into a
[1:40:17] world whatever i don't into another
[1:40:20] realm he said but brother that's wrong
[1:40:24] there is no summit to god's power
[1:40:31] that's why the next service can be
[1:40:33] greater than the last service
[1:40:36] in our mind and our limitations we have
[1:40:38] a great service and we think man there
[1:40:39] ain't no way
[1:40:40] it could be any better than this and the
[1:40:42] next service have you seen it at
[1:40:43] meetings the next service god called
[1:40:46] well there ain't no way it's gonna get
[1:40:48] any better than that
[1:40:51] his power is unlimited it is
[1:40:54] us that has that thinking in our mind
[1:40:56] that services can only be so good
[1:40:58] they can only be so great things can
[1:41:00] only go so far
[1:41:01] things can only be so much but there is
[1:41:04] no summit
[1:41:06] to god's power i want you to tell you'll
[1:41:09] never get to the top of it
[1:41:11] you'll never get to the end of it you'll
[1:41:13] move on and on
[1:41:15] and on it's the unlimited resources of
[1:41:18] god
[1:41:19] that hasn't even been tapped into yet
[1:41:23] hello hello
[1:41:28] mercy jesus i mean we it was great
[1:41:31] powers being demonstrated in that day
[1:41:34] it could never be no greater than that
[1:41:37] that's your limitations
[1:41:40] it can never be no greater than the
[1:41:42] profit that's your limitations
[1:41:47] it can never be no greater
[1:41:52] we put limitations and he's telling us
[1:41:55] there's never
[1:41:56] an end to the unlimited resources
[1:42:00] of god that hasn't even been tapped
[1:42:03] into yet blessings and powers
[1:42:06] that we know nothing about
[1:42:11] mercy jesus amen it had never has been
[1:42:15] revealed to archangels
[1:42:17] and is laying just ahead for his church
[1:42:19] that will believe
[1:42:20] for i has not seen ear has not heard
[1:42:24] neither has entered into the hearts of
[1:42:25] man what god has in store for them
[1:42:28] that love him he said so what do we need
[1:42:31] to do
[1:42:31] we need to keep moving up we need to
[1:42:34] keep claiming our rights
[1:42:36] as god opens the gates and swings the
[1:42:38] welcome mat out
[1:42:39] let's move on to deeper depths never
[1:42:42] organize ourselves
[1:42:44] or get to a place where this is it and
[1:42:46] we believe this and that's all
[1:42:48] let's believe this plus how much more we
[1:42:50] can hear from god
[1:42:53] he said i think that's the way it ought
[1:42:54] to be every more motive of every man or
[1:42:57] woman that loves the lord jesus
[1:42:58] is to receive all that you can
[1:43:03] help somebody is to receive all
[1:43:06] that you care from the hand of his
[1:43:09] bountiful
[1:43:10] mercies that's my heart
[1:43:13] if that's the heart of a prophet it
[1:43:14] ought to be our heart
[1:43:17] amen he says another place
[1:43:28] he said if you could ever get real good
[1:43:29] fundamental faith against pentecost to
[1:43:31] people or fundamental doctrine with the
[1:43:33] pentecostal people
[1:43:34] or vice versa he said i'd like to see
[1:43:37] what that meeting would be
[1:43:39] when the people realize that you're not
[1:43:43] you will be you not it's not you will be
[1:43:46] you are present tense right now
[1:43:49] sons and daughters of an unlimited god
[1:43:56] you're pushing it way off the millennium
[1:43:58] somewhere all the blessings out to the
[1:44:00] millennium
[1:44:01] and that's how we read those scriptures
[1:44:03] what we just read eye has not seen years
[1:44:05] i know it does pertain to part of that
[1:44:07] in the in the eternals
[1:44:10] but i also believe we're at a junction
[1:44:13] we're at the blending
[1:44:16] of time of an eternity of two
[1:44:18] dispensations
[1:44:19] of two realms
[1:44:22] eyes have not seen and ears have not
[1:44:24] heard
[1:44:27] but we keep pushing it off somewhere he
[1:44:30] said
[1:44:30] we don't need divine healing off in the
[1:44:32] millennium we need it right now
[1:44:36] we won't be sons of god we're now sons
[1:44:39] of god heirs joiners with jesus
[1:44:41] and everything that jesus died for at
[1:44:43] calvary is your possession
[1:44:44] now satan don't like that if people
[1:44:47] would only realize
[1:44:48] and just be willing to take god at his
[1:44:49] word well
[1:44:51] it's unlimited did you hear that
[1:44:55] well it's unlimited he said i was
[1:44:58] speaking with a doctor here a lot long
[1:44:59] ago
[1:45:00] he was talking to me said oh you're a
[1:45:01] minister it's just sorry i've studied
[1:45:03] stuff
[1:45:03] that stuff for about four years i said
[1:45:05] you did one well what hindered you
[1:45:06] he said i got to find out there wasn't
[1:45:08] nothing to it and he said you studied it
[1:45:10] for just four years
[1:45:12] to be a minister and you come to find
[1:45:14] out is i got tangled
[1:45:16] up he said that's where it is he said
[1:45:17] you got an x-ray machine
[1:45:19] you can look at the human body and so
[1:45:21] forth well that's wonderful that's a
[1:45:23] tree of knowledge
[1:45:25] that was in the garden of eden man been
[1:45:27] eaten from that tree from eating since
[1:45:29] since eden he said but it's got
[1:45:31] limitations
[1:45:32] it can only do so much
[1:45:36] the tree of knowledge has limitations
[1:45:39] i don't care how much education you got
[1:45:41] it has limitations
[1:45:47] he said well i i'm just i i just know it
[1:45:51] all
[1:45:52] man you sound like well
[1:45:57] you know it's kind of like this men
[1:45:59] think begins to think of themselves so
[1:46:00] big
[1:46:02] and they'll take some precious metals
[1:46:05] and they'll put it
[1:46:06] make little pieces out of it little
[1:46:09] gears and little things
[1:46:11] and they'll place it all in this little
[1:46:13] case
[1:46:14] put this nice dial over it and put a and
[1:46:17] it keeps time
[1:46:19] but eventually it quits eventually it
[1:46:23] stops
[1:46:24] but they've done something they made
[1:46:25] some achievement a watch
[1:46:28] that's a watch is the mechanism of man
[1:46:32] and god would take dust
[1:46:36] elements and he would form a body
[1:46:40] that does incredible things has been
[1:46:41] doing incredible things since you've
[1:46:43] been sitting in your seat
[1:46:46] sales and all kinds of things and all
[1:46:48] the way down and the sinews and all the
[1:46:50] things that works and
[1:46:51] just the what what it takes to even take
[1:46:53] a step
[1:46:55] all the muscles it takes all the things
[1:46:57] sinews it takes the bone structure
[1:46:59] the heart to beat i mean it's it's
[1:47:02] you start looking as almost an unlimited
[1:47:04] thing
[1:47:06] the billions of sales or however many
[1:47:08] there are
[1:47:10] and man made a watch and he thinks he's
[1:47:14] something
[1:47:15] and a watch is man's mechanism but god
[1:47:18] makes a man
[1:47:20] and he's the mechanism of god
[1:47:24] does that even in that ought to show you
[1:47:25] how much more billions of times
[1:47:28] uncontainable times past god's knowledge
[1:47:31] is of man
[1:47:33] but yet man gets a little education he
[1:47:34] said i've learned something
[1:47:37] and you know i'm not even talking about
[1:47:38] a formal education necessarily that's
[1:47:41] that's one thing but you can have some
[1:47:43] except we say it educated rednecks
[1:47:46] hard knocks and he thinks he's something
[1:47:50] because he's done this and he can do
[1:47:52] this and he's a macgyver he figured it
[1:47:53] all out
[1:47:59] and his life is that he lives 90
[1:48:04] something years
[1:48:05] is that
[1:48:09] without god
[1:48:12] but with god in there it's no longer no
[1:48:16] longer limited
[1:48:20] he said this is where it is he said this
[1:48:22] for this this man has got on this tree
[1:48:24] of knowledge
[1:48:25] he said but it's limited it's limited it
[1:48:27] has limitations
[1:48:29] he says you can believe science as far
[1:48:31] as science can go
[1:48:33] and you can take it off as far as it
[1:48:35] will go
[1:48:36] he said but what you need to do when you
[1:48:38] get to the end of it is step
[1:48:40] off of it onto the tree of life
[1:48:44] then it's unlimited he said see
[1:48:47] god in god you will never exhaust god's
[1:48:50] love and mercy
[1:48:51] oh my my my you will he said well i hate
[1:48:54] to bother you so much father
[1:48:55] i hate to bother you tonight he wants
[1:48:58] you to bother him
[1:49:00] he loves you to bother him don't ever
[1:49:03] think that you could ever ask too much
[1:49:04] of god
[1:49:05] you say you but the scripture says you
[1:49:07] have not because you ask
[1:49:08] not and you ask not because you believe
[1:49:10] not he wants us to ask
[1:49:12] and believe that our joys will be full
[1:49:15] he wants you to ask abundantly
[1:49:18] ask for big things don't limit your
[1:49:21] faith to some little mustard seed
[1:49:24] [Applause]
[1:49:25] we use that scripture as a almost as a
[1:49:27] crutch was just a little mustard seed he
[1:49:29] said don't even limit it to a mustard
[1:49:31] seed
[1:49:33] he said get on out there to some other
[1:49:35] kind of faith move out
[1:49:37] and ask big things big things are just
[1:49:41] as easy to receive as little things
[1:49:43] you just have to believe that's all
[1:49:47] and you've got faith you know exactly
[1:49:48] how to use it it'll be all right
[1:49:51] you can never run out
[1:49:54] so what you're scared about
[1:49:58] the bible says jesus was the lamb of god
[1:49:59] slain
[1:50:01] from the foundation of the world all
[1:50:03] this hope builds on our heart
[1:50:05] burns in our heart how it gives us hope
[1:50:07] way back before the foundation of the
[1:50:08] world
[1:50:09] when satan perverted to evil god being
[1:50:12] infinite
[1:50:13] looked down to the stream of time and
[1:50:15] saw the end for knowledge
[1:50:17] if you don't know all things you have a
[1:50:18] limited god and you made him finite just
[1:50:21] like you and i
[1:50:22] but god is unlimited god's power
[1:50:25] god's knowledge god's everything he is
[1:50:29] omnipotent way back before the
[1:50:31] foundation of the world
[1:50:32] when satan come to destroy god already
[1:50:35] was looking
[1:50:36] to see how he was going to counteract it
[1:50:39] he already had the answer for it
[1:50:43] he goes and goes into brother brown goes
[1:50:45] on a sign i'm bringing it down my
[1:50:46] grandfather wrote an aux
[1:50:48] cart i wrote i ride in a ford v8 my son
[1:50:51] will fly in the jet plane
[1:50:53] that's what we're removing he said
[1:50:54] that's what religion ought to be
[1:50:56] the coming of the lord is hand the
[1:50:58] church ought to be moving on
[1:50:59] into the powers of god own into the
[1:51:02] powers of god
[1:51:04] science can only climb so far then it
[1:51:06] drops off but we've got untapped
[1:51:08] resources
[1:51:09] that's never been touched to the power
[1:51:11] of unlimited god
[1:51:12] and we ought to be moving on into it as
[1:51:14] hard as we can go
[1:51:16] brothers and sisters we're living a
[1:51:18] million miles below our privileges
[1:51:20] tonight
[1:51:20] as christians as sons and daughters of
[1:51:23] god he said i feel ashamed of myself
[1:51:25] when i look out there
[1:51:26] and i see institutions and sickness and
[1:51:28] troubles going on right now
[1:51:30] our church ought to be walking the
[1:51:32] street
[1:51:33] healing the sick raising the dead
[1:51:36] casting out devils
[1:51:37] doing signs and wonders making the whole
[1:51:39] world realize
[1:51:40] jesus christ is alive
[1:51:49] mercy
[1:51:55] he would come down into revelations
[1:52:04] and he'd say dear don't fear john
[1:52:08] don't fear little flock all that i
[1:52:11] am you're in there too

[1:54:03] but lord the lord there was one
