[0:01] [Music]
[0:20] I came
[0:22] [Music]
[0:24] scarred. I came in pieces.
[0:29] might have looked strong, but I really
[0:34] came in
[0:38] weakness. I came beat
[0:43] down at the end of my rope and without
[0:48] hope I
[0:53] came. I never knew how
[0:58] broken. I never knew how deeply
[1:05] scarred. I never knew the
[1:09] layers that covered up my
[1:14] heart. I never knew how
[1:18] empty. No, I never knew how lost.
[1:24] Until I came to
[1:26] [Music]
[1:28] Jesus, I never knew how
[1:33] broken. Down and
[1:37] out. Nowhere to
[1:41] [Music]
[1:42] turn, wandering
[1:46] aimlessly with no lesson learned.
[1:52] At the
[1:56] bottom, I surrendered
[1:59] everything that I was to
[2:06] him. I never knew how
[2:11] broken. I never knew how deeply
[2:15] [Music]
[2:17] scarred. I never knew the
[2:21] layers that covered up my
[2:27] heart. I never knew how
[2:30] empty. No, I never knew how
[2:36] lost till I came to Jesus.
[2:42] Never knew how
[2:45] broken a rejected
[2:50] king round in thorns.
[2:57] Israel showed through from the stripes
[3:01] [Music]
[3:05] he can
[3:08] be. On that ruged cross he died for all
[3:14] the
[3:19] lost. I never knew how
[3:22] [Music]
[3:23] broken. I never knew how deeply
[3:30] scar. I never knew the
[3:34] layers that covered up my
[3:39] heart. I never knew how
[3:43] indeed. No, I never knew how
[3:48] lost until I came to Jesus.
[3:54] Never knew how
[3:56] [Music]
[3:57] broken. I never knew how
[4:01] empty. No, I never knew
[4:04] [Music]
[4:06] how until I came to
[4:11] Jesus. I never knew how
[4:15] broken until I came to Jesus.
[4:21] I never knew how broken.
[4:27] [Applause]
