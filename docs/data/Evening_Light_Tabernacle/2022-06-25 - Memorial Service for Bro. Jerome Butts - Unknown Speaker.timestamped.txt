[25:17] [Music]
[25:41] we're here today to
[25:43] remember my papa who was a very funny
[25:46] man
[25:47] he
[25:48] was he could be stern and serious
[25:51] but he also really liked to laugh
[25:54] so i'm going to try to make you smile
[25:55] today
[25:56] um by sharing some short memories from
[25:59] our family
[26:01] uh little moments
[26:03] that made up a man's lifetime and legacy
[26:07] i'm going to start with a story
[26:09] of how our family began
[26:12] jerome butts met linda carroll farmer in
[26:15] a small town in mississippi
[26:18] and
[26:18] of course when they saw each other for
[26:20] the first time had no idea that they
[26:23] would be spending the next 57 years
[26:24] together
[26:26] um part of that is because
[26:28] like the rest of us they cannot see
[26:30] their future
[26:31] but also there was the small
[26:33] inconvenient fact that papa was dating
[26:36] nana's friend sander at the time
[26:39] it kind of slowed things down just a
[26:41] little bit
[26:43] didn't slow things down for long
[26:45] and
[26:46] later on things had rearranged nicely
[26:48] i'm told with the help of a lady named
[26:50] sister bertha and on november
[26:54] 27 1964 jerome butts married linda
[26:58] carroll farmer
[26:59] with sandra serving as the maid of honor
[27:06] uh something about papa was he had a
[27:08] very soft spot for animals
[27:11] the last few years if you knew papa you
[27:13] knew about his dog frankie
[27:15] he was absolutely crazy about that pug
[27:18] and i'm convinced he shared more
[27:19] pictures of the dog than he did his
[27:20] grandkids
[27:24] um
[27:24] papa could bark and sound
[27:27] a lot like a dog which caused a lot of
[27:29] grief for nana
[27:31] as my mom remembers
[27:33] papa would go into the backyard of their
[27:35] house
[27:36] start barking and howling
[27:39] and getting every dog in the
[27:40] neighborhood barking and howling along
[27:42] with him
[27:43] proving that he was a wonderful neighbor
[27:48] um but he had a soft spot for some
[27:49] animals
[27:50] my mom remembers a time when he rescued
[27:52] a baby bird
[27:54] took care of it
[27:55] and managed to train the bird to come to
[27:58] him whenever he whistled
[28:00] he tried um hunting a few times he spent
[28:03] several years getting hunting licenses
[28:05] going out waiting for the deer
[28:08] but whenever he saw them he would lift
[28:10] his gun aim
[28:12] but then bring the gun back down he said
[28:14] the deer were too pretty to kill
[28:17] um so after
[28:18] a few years of that he stopped buying
[28:20] the hunting license
[28:24] uh something you may not know about him
[28:26] was he had a very interesting set of
[28:28] scars on his leg
[28:31] papa served for six years of active duty
[28:34] with the national guard but as far as i
[28:36] know he never actually saw any
[28:38] action
[28:39] but
[28:41] he had a pistol at home
[28:43] and one day he was practicing with the
[28:44] gun and as i understand he was aiming
[28:46] across the street
[28:48] a car started driving by so he put the
[28:50] gun down
[28:51] and shot his leg
[28:54] the bullet went in and out
[28:56] a couple times from what i understand
[28:58] um and because papa was a big prankster
[29:02] when he went inside the house and showed
[29:03] nana told her that he had shot himself
[29:06] she was like oh jerome that's just
[29:07] ketchup
[29:09] but as he liked to say it was ketchup
[29:11] that wouldn't stop
[29:13] so they they did take care of it
[29:17] um papa was a hard worker
[29:20] i remember
[29:21] many days being at his house when he
[29:22] came home from work
[29:24] um
[29:25] he would clean up
[29:27] eat a bowl of cereal
[29:29] and treat his various cuts and scrapes
[29:32] with something called merthyalate
[29:34] which he told me was monkey's blood
[29:37] which you know i
[29:39] kind of questioned the myth the science
[29:41] of that but i recently learned that
[29:43] merthyolite actually had mercury in it
[29:45] so the monkey's blood might have been
[29:46] better
[29:49] we could talk a long time about the
[29:51] things that papa was
[29:53] there are also a few things he wasn't
[29:56] for example he was not a patient driver
[29:59] he had an absolute intolerance for
[30:01] drivers who were in his way or who were
[30:03] doing things differently from you
[30:05] and you definitely didn't want him in
[30:07] your passenger seat if you were the one
[30:09] driving
[30:11] he was also probably not the best
[30:13] teammate
[30:14] he was fiercely competitive a trait that
[30:17] he shared with his dad
[30:18] and his siblings
[30:22] aunt denise said you really didn't want
[30:24] to be on his volleyball team
[30:26] however he also had a soft spot
[30:29] in sports as my friend rebecca remembers
[30:32] he always pitched her a ball she could
[30:33] hit during the church softball games
[30:39] andrew remembers papa taking him and
[30:41] cody to the pond
[30:42] walking with him through the woods and
[30:44] how papa was always trying to pinch him
[30:45] with his toes
[30:48] joshua remembers all the cold water
[30:50] bottles to the neck
[30:52] delaney the tug of a ponytail
[30:56] emily remembers the tickling sessions
[30:59] and how abigail would get them out of
[31:00] those tickling sessions by squealing so
[31:02] loud that nana would finally tell him to
[31:04] quit
[31:07] abigail remembers how nan and papa would
[31:10] sweetly tolerate the
[31:12] musical productions in the living room
[31:16] everyone remembers how much he loved
[31:17] solitaire
[31:20] i have lots of little memories of papa
[31:23] how he
[31:24] loved to show off the frog in his arm
[31:27] he usually smelled like motor oil or old
[31:30] spice
[31:32] he would take pictures of pictures
[31:35] and he'd love to show them to you even
[31:37] if they were your pictures
[31:42] if you lost papa and walmart you could
[31:44] always find him in the tv section
[31:46] watching whatever was playing
[31:51] when he really laughed his eyes and nose
[31:53] would scrunch up and he would grin real
[31:55] big
[31:58] he was so excited when emily was born
[32:00] and he found out that she had crooked
[32:02] pinkies just like him
[32:06] his hair was thin and wispy on top and
[32:08] would blow around at the slightest
[32:10] breeze
[32:11] it had to be covered with either a hat
[32:13] or a can of hairspray to keep it from
[32:15] waving at you constantly
[32:19] he drove us crazy on facebook
[32:24] we're not going to say much about that
[32:28] one day we uh had a moment of panic when
[32:30] the grandkids started getting requests
[32:32] from him on snapchat
[32:34] um turns out he really just liked the
[32:36] filters that made him look like a dog
[32:39] and he quickly um got tired of the app
[32:43] he loved to pester people
[32:45] especially his mama
[32:47] and nana
[32:51] he was so proud of his family he loved
[32:54] to tell other people about their jobs
[32:57] their accomplishments their talents
[32:59] even their dental records were deemed
[33:01] worthy of his boasting
[33:04] he especially loved to hear his family
[33:05] sing and play in church
[33:10] and this past monday morning after
[33:12] getting the news that he had died
[33:14] i was getting ready to go to nana's
[33:16] and the church bells down the road
[33:18] started playing the song god be with you
[33:21] till we meet again
[33:23] and that was just perfect
[33:26] um
[33:27] we loved papa so much
[33:29] he was our patriarch and we will miss
[33:32] him
[33:32] terribly
[33:35] but we know that we will meet him again
[33:38] he'll be laughing
[33:40] and god will be with us until that day

[33:52] wonderful man
[33:53] now i can't leave facebook alone

[41:38] old or young doesn't matter
[41:40] the bible says make your call in an
[41:41] election sure and it doesn't matter the
[41:43] age but
[41:45] i got my notes here i'm a short-winded
[41:46] speaker so y'all don't get too excited
[41:50] but i didn't want to let this
[41:51] opportunity pass without saying just a
[41:53] few words about my dad
[41:55] probably one of the greatest men that i
[41:57] know that's lived on earth and
[42:00] have no doubt that he's
[42:02] probably the last of some of the great
[42:03] generations that's lived here
[42:06] uh
[42:07] when mom called me
[42:09] monday morning to
[42:11] tell me about dad
[42:12] as soon as i saw her number on the phone
[42:14] i knew it knew what it was because mom
[42:15] never calls me but
[42:17] but this
[42:22] sorry mom
[42:25] but i just immediately had the scripture
[42:26] come to mind it's first kings two and
[42:29] three i'll
[42:30] the first part what came to mind is when
[42:32] i got home i looked it up but i read the
[42:34] amplified version it said i go the way
[42:36] of all the earth
[42:37] be strong and show yourself a man
[42:40] keep the charge of the lord your god
[42:42] walk in his ways keep his statutes his
[42:44] commandments his precepts and his
[42:46] testimonies as it is written in the law
[42:48] of moses that you may do wisely and
[42:50] prosper in all that you do and wherever
[42:52] you turn
[42:53] this is how i want my life to be lived
[42:56] and i believe dad led lived his life
[42:58] exactly like that
[43:00] one of my earliest memories
[43:02] of dad was in the old old church
[43:05] uh in a service maybe brother james the
[43:07] one you talked about this morning where
[43:08] dad gave his heart to the lord was i can
[43:10] actually still see the picture
[43:12] see the color of the paneling behind my
[43:14] dad as he had his hands up in the air
[43:16] sliding down the wall
[43:20] just surrendering his all to the lord
[43:22] maybe the same service that brother
[43:24] jimbo was drunk out on the ramp i'm not
[43:26] sure
[43:28] but i do remember that too
[43:31] as kristen said all who remember my dad
[43:33] remembers his real gentle spirit of all
[43:35] the countless messages i've gotten over
[43:37] the past few days
[43:40] time after time after time they just
[43:42] said what a gentle man your dad was what
[43:44] a christian man your dad was
[43:48] just a sweet gentle nature
[43:51] he wasn't always gentle
[43:52] as some of my siblings can attest except
[43:55] maybe liz and lorian who could get by
[43:56] with murder but
[44:01] when lauren would get in trouble she'd
[44:02] say dad don't use the belt and he
[44:04] wouldn't use anything so
[44:06] i don't i'd never worked for me
[44:09] but he could be a real disciplinarian
[44:11] but i can honestly say every spanking i
[44:13] got i deserved probably not nearly what
[44:15] i needed but everyone was done in love
[44:17] and i appreciate that
[44:19] i learned so many skills from my dad
[44:20] probably wore the paint off many fenders
[44:23] of cars just watching him work on him
[44:24] and handing him tools and
[44:27] just learned a lot of skills that served
[44:29] me to this day
[44:32] i can look at a nut and tell you what
[44:34] size wrench goes on it pretty much right
[44:35] now
[44:37] he was a hard worker and like kristin
[44:39] said his hands were always beat up
[44:41] just from the type of work he is as a
[44:43] machinist
[44:44] and i always thought he was one of the
[44:45] strongest men that i knew just big
[44:47] forearms
[44:48] burly and uh
[44:52] anything he wanted to take loose
[44:54] or i wanted to loose i could take it to
[44:56] him and he could get it loose
[44:58] but over the past 15 years or so as i
[45:00] remodeled a couple of houses and he
[45:02] would come over to help me many many
[45:03] times
[45:04] i noticed he didn't have the same
[45:06] stamina the same strength and i remember
[45:08] thinking then that
[45:10] dad's getting old
[45:13] uh
[45:14] and it surprised me because you know
[45:15] your dad's supposed to be
[45:17] strong forever
[45:20] but even as a a weak
[45:22] older man he was always willing to help
[45:24] out even when he was building the church
[45:25] here he'd come and he couldn't do much
[45:26] but he could sweep and he did that
[45:28] countless times and
[45:30] just helped out any way he could and
[45:32] there's an old song that comes to mind
[45:35] about
[45:36] dad's hands and i'm not going to sing it
[45:37] because that would really mess you all
[45:39] up
[45:41] but i
[45:42] sing a few quotes with my daddy's hands
[45:44] or sing tell you a few lines i remember
[45:46] daddy's hand silently folded in prayer
[45:49] and reaching out to hold me when i had a
[45:50] nightmare
[45:52] you could read quite a story in the
[45:53] callison lines years of work and worry
[45:55] had left their mark behind
[45:58] daddy's hands were soft and kind when i
[46:00] was crying daddy's hands were hardest
[46:01] still when i'd done wrong daddy's hands
[46:03] were always gentle
[46:05] but i've come to understand there's
[46:06] always love in daddy's hands
[46:09] and he did he worked hard to supply
[46:11] everything that we had needed we weren't
[46:13] rich by any means but we never lacked
[46:16] and uh
[46:17] he just put family first
[46:20] all the time
[46:22] uh
[46:24] was a very
[46:26] selfless man when it come to his family
[46:29] and i'm i'm going to close with a quote
[46:31] from brother branham out of the law
[46:32] having a shadow
[46:34] he said death has set in this old mortal
[46:36] body here it's creeping it and turning
[46:38] it great taking it down
[46:40] but bless god every adam and every light
[46:42] and every light meter within this body
[46:44] will return at the resurrection to its
[46:46] perfection hallelujah death has no reign
[46:48] over righteous hallelujah the soul of
[46:50] man never dies
[46:52] when my spirits turn loose yonder with
[46:54] the king of spirits at the resurrection
[46:55] it'll scream
[46:57] and every atom that ever made this body
[46:59] when it was as strong and the best it
[47:01] was will zap to its place again yes sir
[47:04] thank you
[47:09] man thank you buddy
[47:11] amen wonderful let's sing this song when
[47:13] we all get to heaven what a day of
[47:15] rejoicing that'll be
[47:17] but after through as brother philip and
[47:19] brother jeremy and sister say did he

[59:39] pillars here in our assembly
[59:42] as i mentioned today at the graveside
[59:44] that you know it was some 40
[59:47] uh
[59:48] 45 years ago that brother jerome
[59:51] had a
[59:52] a life-changing experience
[59:54] there actually it was 40 46 years ago
[59:58] there and um
[1:00:00] in the year was um
[1:00:02] 1975 when uh the butts family consistent
[1:00:06] of
[1:00:07] lovitt and louise and karen dinette
[1:00:10] and tim all came into the
[1:00:12] the church building one
[1:00:14] tuesday night and i had my first chance
[1:00:17] an opportunity to minister to them that
[1:00:19] night
[1:00:20] and uh then later on just within the
[1:00:23] next few days of i think it was the
[1:00:24] following sunday
[1:00:26] jerome linden laurie and david and
[1:00:29] stephen came and denise so you know we
[1:00:32] um we had this um
[1:00:34] uh wonderful
[1:00:36] addition that became a part of our
[1:00:38] church
[1:00:39] and um brother jerome held a very
[1:00:42] important position
[1:00:44] of deacon with honor and he fulfilled it
[1:00:47] in every way
[1:00:49] and he performed
[1:00:50] he performed well in that office and was
[1:00:54] faithful
[1:00:55] in fact he was
[1:00:56] maybe a little bit too faithful
[1:00:58] sometimes
[1:00:59] but he was faithful
[1:01:01] one particular time that we all still
[1:01:04] remember and
[1:01:05] laugh about today was
[1:01:08] um
[1:01:09] you know i had it was in the early 80s
[1:01:11] and i was um had advanced into the
[1:01:15] computers and and it prepared a sermon
[1:01:18] on
[1:01:19] we're using a computer and had a nine
[1:01:21] print uh nine hole uh print uh feeder
[1:01:24] feed printer there and you know it's the
[1:01:27] kind that every page is connected and on
[1:01:30] the sides were the little holes there
[1:01:32] that pulled it through the printer and
[1:01:34] so before i went to the pulpit that day
[1:01:37] i had taken the side tabs off and and
[1:01:41] discarded them but i had forgot
[1:01:44] to
[1:01:45] uh disconnect every
[1:01:47] paper from the one in front of it or
[1:01:49] behind it
[1:01:50] and um so as i as i um
[1:01:54] came up to speak i found that i had a
[1:01:56] sermon and it was a big fan fold page
[1:02:00] paper like this you know and and uh so i
[1:02:03] i tore up the first page and put it
[1:02:06] there in front of me and
[1:02:09] and as i did i noticed it was picking up
[1:02:12] on my lapel microphone
[1:02:14] you know so
[1:02:15] i said i i don't want to make that kind
[1:02:18] of noise every every few minutes you
[1:02:20] know ripping on this so brother jerome
[1:02:22] was sitting there close and i handed him
[1:02:25] my notes and i said here take these to
[1:02:27] the back room there and tear these apart
[1:02:29] for me
[1:02:31] so
[1:02:31] in a few minutes um he came back and sat
[1:02:35] down and
[1:02:36] and uh
[1:02:37] he
[1:02:38] you know was
[1:02:40] looking like a job well done
[1:02:42] and uh
[1:02:43] i looked over at him and i said
[1:02:46] where are my notes and he said
[1:02:49] you told me to take them back there and
[1:02:51] tear them apart or tear them up
[1:02:54] the man had taken my notes and shredded
[1:02:56] them into pieces
[1:02:59] like i said he was faithful
[1:03:01] to a fault
[1:03:02] [Laughter]
[1:03:04] amen but anyway you know it was
[1:03:07] moments like that that
[1:03:09] was
[1:03:10] very special very precious
[1:03:12] in our memories today and
[1:03:14] and um
[1:03:15] we are so thankful for brother jerome
[1:03:17] and his life his testimony
[1:03:20] his service to the lord and he's a great
[1:03:23] friend great brother
[1:03:25] i want to read the scripture of john 14
[1:03:27] verse 1
[1:03:29] that's because we want to take our
[1:03:31] consolation today from the word of god
[1:03:34] that's where we get our comfort from
[1:03:36] and the bible said let not your heart be
[1:03:39] troubled
[1:03:40] you believe in god believe also in me
[1:03:43] in my father's house are many mansions
[1:03:46] if it were not so i would have told you
[1:03:48] i go to prepare a place for you
[1:03:51] and if i go i and prepare a place for
[1:03:53] you i will come again
[1:03:56] and receive you unto myself that where i
[1:03:59] am there you may be also
[1:04:02] so you know when we come to these
[1:04:04] moments like today
[1:04:06] it really makes us long
[1:04:08] for another world
[1:04:11] a place
[1:04:12] called heaven where there's just no more
[1:04:14] suffering people
[1:04:17] as i went to brother jerome's bedside in
[1:04:20] the last few weeks and went several
[1:04:22] times in the last month but just um as
[1:04:25] early or late as uh saturday before he
[1:04:28] passed on monday i was there and spoke
[1:04:31] with him we got to share our last i love
[1:04:33] yous and say our goodbyes and i talked
[1:04:36] to him about
[1:04:38] you know where he was going and the
[1:04:40] darkness that would enfold the light
[1:04:42] that would come and to move toward that
[1:04:44] light and
[1:04:45] and um i i i reminisced you know at a
[1:04:49] moment and i think it's special in a
[1:04:51] moment like this that when his daddy
[1:04:53] brother butts was crossing over
[1:04:56] just um
[1:04:58] just a few days before he would sat up
[1:05:01] in the bed in the in the rehab room of
[1:05:03] his hospital and he would cup his hands
[1:05:06] to his mouth and and he would he would
[1:05:09] yell out
[1:05:12] and look out into the distance somewhere
[1:05:14] and calling to someone well it alarmed
[1:05:17] the family my wife karen called me and
[1:05:19] said daddy is
[1:05:20] really um acting strange and we don't
[1:05:23] know what to think said come come
[1:05:25] quickly so i was coming back from
[1:05:28] shreveport and i
[1:05:30] i rushed over into the hospital room
[1:05:33] and i spent a few minutes with them and
[1:05:35] then asked to
[1:05:36] if i could just have a few moments
[1:05:38] private with him and everybody left and
[1:05:41] i sat down with him and i said papaw i
[1:05:43] said
[1:05:44] you know i
[1:05:46] i know you're nearing that shore and i i
[1:05:49] know in this moment
[1:05:52] uh
[1:05:53] they're they're telling me you're seeing
[1:05:55] things or something is happening and i
[1:05:58] want to know about it he said well
[1:06:00] yeah he said uh he said don't you see
[1:06:03] the big white bird standing right behind
[1:06:05] you and and i looked and i said no
[1:06:09] i don't see any birds but
[1:06:11] you know i don't doubt they're there i
[1:06:12] said what it is is you're blending
[1:06:14] dimensions you're still here but you're
[1:06:17] already beginning to see the other side
[1:06:21] and i said but
[1:06:23] who are you calling to
[1:06:25] and
[1:06:26] and uh he said why it's my brother my
[1:06:28] sister uh estelle and iyuna and they're
[1:06:32] they're right right over there and
[1:06:34] they've been calling to me
[1:06:36] and i said well what are they saying and
[1:06:38] they he said they're saying come on over
[1:06:41] here
[1:06:42] and he said i was replying to them and
[1:06:45] answering them and so you see
[1:06:47] you know
[1:06:48] heaven is not a place of fiction
[1:06:51] heaven is a real place
[1:06:54] and it is a place where there is no
[1:06:57] sickness no sorrow no pain or death it's
[1:06:59] not a place
[1:07:00] like said of you know playing harps at
[1:07:03] all or sitting up on a cloud and
[1:07:06] our or an eternal church service where
[1:07:09] that we just sing and shout and you know
[1:07:11] do some kind of mindless chance forever
[1:07:15] no heaven is a real place
[1:07:18] and it's just the same as this is a real
[1:07:20] place in fact
[1:07:22] it's really more real than here
[1:07:24] because this is only a shadow or the
[1:07:27] negative of the positive there
[1:07:30] so heaven is a real place that we're
[1:07:33] going to where we will go to enjoy we're
[1:07:36] going to live we're going to
[1:07:38] a real eternal life where we will work
[1:07:41] where we will communicate with one
[1:07:44] another
[1:07:45] for some of you that wasn't there this
[1:07:47] morning i referred to
[1:07:49] brother ron spencer having a recent
[1:07:51] dream of his father-in-law
[1:07:53] uh who's passed over just just uh came
[1:07:56] to him in a dream the other night and
[1:07:58] and uh he was a young man and he said
[1:08:00] ronald is really wonderful over here
[1:08:02] said um why
[1:08:04] he said i'm getting to meet new people
[1:08:06] all the time
[1:08:08] and he said you know that
[1:08:10] those young people that were killed in a
[1:08:12] plane wreck here the other day said are
[1:08:15] here some years back now where uh
[1:08:18] some of some acquaintances that we knew
[1:08:20] that the young people were using a small
[1:08:23] plane and flying into the grand canyon
[1:08:26] and and crashed and uh all four of them
[1:08:29] were killed and and said you know i i
[1:08:32] i've been talking to them and hearing
[1:08:35] their story you see heaven's not a place
[1:08:39] uh that is just a fiction it's not a
[1:08:41] place of
[1:08:42] boredom it's not a not a place of of an
[1:08:46] eternal church service where we just
[1:08:47] sing
[1:08:48] countless songs but rather it's a place
[1:08:51] where we live in a body without sin or
[1:08:55] sickness or pain
[1:08:57] and we'll be there with many others
[1:08:59] people that we love and finally upon a
[1:09:02] restored earth will live in a place of
[1:09:04] gardens and rivers and mountains
[1:09:07] and untold adventures
[1:09:10] and this is what heaven is
[1:09:12] so referring to the coming heaven
[1:09:15] or the
[1:09:16] to the coming of heaven which will be on
[1:09:18] the earth the bible said we will be
[1:09:20] there
[1:09:21] and are offspring with us
[1:09:24] so you see it's a place that we will
[1:09:26] gather with our families and be a part
[1:09:30] of a great eternity laying ahead and
[1:09:33] this life that we're living in is only a
[1:09:36] preparation a place of preparation for
[1:09:39] that life this is at best temporary
[1:09:43] and we know that jesus will return to
[1:09:45] the earth in a visible body for a church
[1:09:47] that has redeemed the bride and take her
[1:09:50] out of here and regardless of what comes
[1:09:53] or what goes or fashions or or what
[1:09:56] people say or the popular trends
[1:09:59] you know
[1:10:01] they can go on in total darkness if they
[1:10:03] want to and believe anything they will
[1:10:05] waste but jesus christ
[1:10:07] will return again
[1:10:10] and we'll be caught up to meet the lord
[1:10:12] in the air think of that missing people
[1:10:15] that they won't be able to see you
[1:10:17] anymore the world will not but you'll be
[1:10:19] getting together with the rest of the
[1:10:20] group and we're looking forward to that
[1:10:23] time
[1:10:24] for those
[1:10:25] that we speak of as dead or not dead
[1:10:28] they are only asleep
[1:10:31] and that's only referring to their body
[1:10:33] because there there's no soul sleeping
[1:10:36] they're just active talking
[1:10:39] walking enjoying one another embracing
[1:10:42] hearing one another's story
[1:10:45] sharing the most wonderful moments
[1:10:48] together
[1:10:49] and
[1:10:50] they're they are enjoying life
[1:10:53] a greater life than this life
[1:10:56] and you see when it comes to temporary
[1:10:59] of course this life is temporary because
[1:11:02] god meant it to be so
[1:11:04] because we cannot live in this life of
[1:11:06] evil and sin in this world
[1:11:09] uh and and continue to live in eternally
[1:11:12] in in these bodies of decay and of
[1:11:15] humiliation
[1:11:16] so god puts a time limit upon these
[1:11:19] bodies
[1:11:20] but he puts no time limit upon his
[1:11:22] children
[1:11:23] because we will be with him through the
[1:11:25] eternal ages
[1:11:27] but who what is
[1:11:29] temporary is satan
[1:11:32] satan is temporary he is not eternal his
[1:11:36] kingdom his life of sin and death and
[1:11:38] sorrow it will all end and it will give
[1:11:41] way to a place of peace and joy and love
[1:11:45] that is what is in the kingdom of god
[1:11:48] also sin is temporary it will have a sin
[1:11:52] one day evil
[1:11:54] will all come to an end
[1:11:56] sickness is temporary
[1:11:58] cancer
[1:12:00] and aging is only temporary and now
[1:12:04] you know the the condition that
[1:12:06] tormented brother jerome is now dead
[1:12:10] the cancer that he once fought is now
[1:12:12] dead the old age problems that's all
[1:12:15] gone but he is not he is alive he's in a
[1:12:19] new body he is young he is whole he can
[1:12:23] be felt and he can be touched
[1:12:26] and that's
[1:12:27] it there is absolutely no end to a child
[1:12:31] of god
[1:12:32] we came from god and we're going back to
[1:12:35] god we were eternal in his thoughts and
[1:12:38] we are eternal now
[1:12:40] we are not temporary beings but this
[1:12:43] life that we now live in is temporary
[1:12:46] and as i said god meant it to be so
[1:12:49] now originally mankind lived in paradise
[1:12:54] and this present world this earth in his
[1:12:58] fallen condition
[1:12:59] it's a poor and dim reflection
[1:13:03] of that paradise
[1:13:06] you see that paradise was actually
[1:13:08] heaven on earth
[1:13:10] from for man man enjoyed heaven
[1:13:15] until sin entered the picture
[1:13:17] man was immortal but when sin came
[1:13:21] human life became temporary because a
[1:13:24] merciful god will not allow us to live
[1:13:27] in the state of decay
[1:13:30] and trouble and sorrow so he only allows
[1:13:33] it for a certain time
[1:13:36] and some of us have that time with long
[1:13:38] days upon the earth
[1:13:40] and others with a much shorter time
[1:13:43] but you cannot stay in this mortal life
[1:13:46] forever
[1:13:47] you see god did not bring sin and
[1:13:49] sickness no you can't blame that on god
[1:13:53] sin and sickness and the sorrow it
[1:13:55] brings it came by man's own choice
[1:13:58] he chose to partake of knowledge
[1:14:01] and through that he would come to know
[1:14:03] both good and evil
[1:14:06] but when god made it everything was good
[1:14:08] till man messed it up
[1:14:11] you see
[1:14:12] as we reflect upon that we remember in
[1:14:15] the beginning the bible tells you he
[1:14:17] made the light and said
[1:14:20] it was good
[1:14:21] he would make them the waters and then
[1:14:24] separate the waters and the earth and
[1:14:27] the dry land the gathering together
[1:14:29] the waters called the seas and god said
[1:14:32] that's good
[1:14:33] and then he would look again and begin
[1:14:35] to bring up all kinds of seed now it was
[1:14:39] not an evolution but it was like an
[1:14:41] evolution god would start with the
[1:14:43] smaller things of life and he would
[1:14:45] create and be and bring it up from from
[1:14:49] nothingness and from smallness into
[1:14:52] greatness and from one to greater
[1:14:54] species until finally he would make man
[1:14:57] so he would make the grass and the herbs
[1:15:00] of the fields and the trees and and god
[1:15:02] said that's good
[1:15:04] and and then he he would he he made the
[1:15:07] lights to rule the days and and and
[1:15:10] separated light from darkness and let
[1:15:13] light shine upon the earth removing the
[1:15:15] the great cover that was upon the earth
[1:15:18] and the waters then he would call
[1:15:20] out of the waters to come
[1:15:22] abundant life and there would be fishes
[1:15:25] and there would be
[1:15:27] um
[1:15:28] fowls of the air then that would fly in
[1:15:30] the heavens and beasts of every kind and
[1:15:32] ever as as he did this he looked at it
[1:15:35] and he said it's it's all good and and
[1:15:39] then
[1:15:40] six times he would say it is good and
[1:15:43] finally after everything that he had
[1:15:45] created he was so satisfied
[1:15:48] with the goodness of what he had created
[1:15:51] and saw everything that he made and then
[1:15:54] he said behold
[1:15:55] it is very good
[1:15:58] you see god made everything on earth
[1:16:00] perfect
[1:16:02] maybe good
[1:16:04] made it for his children to enjoy
[1:16:07] just like heaven will be
[1:16:09] in fact earth was as it was an extension
[1:16:13] of heaven
[1:16:14] so eden was a paradise
[1:16:16] of perfection it was literally
[1:16:19] heaven on the earth
[1:16:21] and in god's eating there was no death
[1:16:24] there was no grace
[1:16:26] there we
[1:16:28] we were never to have to experience the
[1:16:30] heartache of separation that would be
[1:16:32] caused by death
[1:16:34] yet
[1:16:36] there was that potential that life could
[1:16:38] be turned to death
[1:16:40] and the earth turned to satan's rule
[1:16:42] where death would reign
[1:16:44] that potential was there
[1:16:47] but it was not there without a warning
[1:16:50] from god first that saying that they
[1:16:53] were not to partake of the knowledge of
[1:16:56] the tree of good and evil
[1:16:59] because by partaking of that knowledge
[1:17:02] they would come to know death
[1:17:04] they would come to no
[1:17:05] sorrow
[1:17:07] they wouldn't come to know
[1:17:08] heart-wrenching pain
[1:17:10] and taken of this knowledge would become
[1:17:12] the reason
[1:17:14] that we would need doctors and hospitals
[1:17:18] and medicines to try to alleviate the
[1:17:20] suffering and the pain of mankind
[1:17:23] but the fruit of knowledge itself would
[1:17:24] cause the sorrow that we would feel
[1:17:27] today and its fruit would cause every
[1:17:30] grave upon the earth
[1:17:32] and the tears of sorrow we would lay our
[1:17:36] loved ones
[1:17:37] and but god was diligent he did his part
[1:17:40] he didn't make a man
[1:17:42] um as the animals without a choice he
[1:17:45] put a soul with him and that soul is a
[1:17:47] choice chamber
[1:17:49] and so he had the ability to choose
[1:17:52] and he could choose between life or
[1:17:55] death
[1:17:56] and he chose the knowledge of evil of
[1:17:59] good and evil which would bring about
[1:18:01] death instead of
[1:18:04] life
[1:18:05] and he left life
[1:18:07] to experience
[1:18:08] all kinds of
[1:18:10] evil
[1:18:11] all kinds of sorrow and trouble
[1:18:14] you see
[1:18:15] god did not want men to die
[1:18:18] god never wanted us to have to have a
[1:18:20] service like we've had today when we
[1:18:23] planted a seed in the soil and
[1:18:26] and talked about a resurrection god
[1:18:28] never wanted that for man he never
[1:18:30] wanted us to ever have to talk about
[1:18:33] somebody in in past tense in this life
[1:18:36] he he wanted it to be an endless joy
[1:18:39] that's the way he made it
[1:18:41] and so he didn't want man to die it was
[1:18:44] never his will
[1:18:45] he didn't want to make the man to
[1:18:47] experience pain suffering
[1:18:49] but yet he didn't force his will upon
[1:18:53] man
[1:18:54] but rather he left it to his choice
[1:18:58] and for a time we don't know how long it
[1:19:01] could have been millions of years it
[1:19:03] could have been a thousand
[1:19:05] it could have been a day we don't know
[1:19:07] but for a time man enjoyed heaven on
[1:19:10] earth
[1:19:11] in god's eden where everything was good
[1:19:14] think about it never a fear
[1:19:17] never a worry never a problem
[1:19:20] never talking about how bad the weather
[1:19:22] was
[1:19:24] never talking about oh it's too hot or
[1:19:26] is too cold or this is miserable it was
[1:19:29] all one great big joy
[1:19:33] and so he
[1:19:34] man enjoyed heaven on earth
[1:19:36] where everything was good but then
[1:19:40] they chose
[1:19:41] knowledge and took of the tree of death
[1:19:44] and now every human would have to be
[1:19:46] born
[1:19:47] in bodies that are mortal and because
[1:19:51] they are mortal
[1:19:53] they get injured
[1:19:54] or sick
[1:19:55] and they die
[1:19:57] our first parents would
[1:19:59] enjoy
[1:20:01] life like that for many
[1:20:03] who knows how long
[1:20:05] but then
[1:20:06] they would have to come to know them
[1:20:09] because of their choice
[1:20:11] the pain of separation
[1:20:14] when jealousy turned to hate and
[1:20:16] produced the first murder where one
[1:20:18] brother
[1:20:19] killed another and their son abel died
[1:20:21] and
[1:20:22] and then they would become the first
[1:20:24] tears to at a graveside
[1:20:27] the first funeral the first separation
[1:20:31] and the first of a long line of death
[1:20:33] and dying
[1:20:35] so you see there was two trees man was
[1:20:37] made to give a choice of one or the
[1:20:40] other the tree of life
[1:20:42] which would represent christ
[1:20:44] or the tree of death which would
[1:20:46] represent satan and his knowledge and
[1:20:49] when man refused
[1:20:52] to obey god and his warnings and took a
[1:20:54] bite from that tree of knowledge
[1:20:57] then deaths and then entered in
[1:21:01] and man has tried with his knowledge to
[1:21:03] bring back health and happiness and
[1:21:05] peace and but everything that comes from
[1:21:08] that tree
[1:21:10] of knowledge also has evil with it
[1:21:13] even as we try to help mankind with
[1:21:16] medication and
[1:21:17] and science tries to do it all has its
[1:21:20] evil side effects
[1:21:21] we make travel easier with cars and
[1:21:24] trucks
[1:21:25] but with it comes poisonous gases that
[1:21:27] pollutes the atmosphere and the air that
[1:21:29] we
[1:21:30] breathe and horrible accidents will
[1:21:32] happen that will shorten our life
[1:21:35] men bit off the tree of knowledge bit
[1:21:38] off gun powder and it killed his brother
[1:21:41] has been off the tree of knowledge and
[1:21:43] and bit off um nuclear bombs by which he
[1:21:47] will threatens now to to destroy all
[1:21:50] life upon the earth
[1:21:52] but there was another tree in the garden
[1:21:55] and it was not a tree of death
[1:21:58] it was a tree of life
[1:22:00] and when jesus came he came as the fruit
[1:22:04] from that tree of life
[1:22:06] and even as he was life he was a giver
[1:22:09] of life
[1:22:10] and he said i am the bread
[1:22:13] that came down from god out of heaven
[1:22:16] that if a man will eat of me
[1:22:18] he will never die
[1:22:21] for he says in john 6 47 verily verily
[1:22:24] i've seen you he that believeth on me
[1:22:27] hath eternal life i am that bread of
[1:22:31] life
[1:22:32] he would say in verse 50 this is the
[1:22:35] bread that cometh down from heaven that
[1:22:37] if a man may eat thereof
[1:22:39] may eat thereof and not die i am the
[1:22:42] living bread which came down from heaven
[1:22:44] if any man eat this bread he shall live
[1:22:47] forever and the bread that i will give
[1:22:50] is my flesh which i will give for the
[1:22:52] life of the world
[1:22:54] so here jesus comes
[1:22:56] that after man had brought sin to the
[1:22:59] earth and defiled his purity
[1:23:01] god immediately would start bringing
[1:23:05] reconciliation to man and all this time
[1:23:08] since the fall of man
[1:23:10] um
[1:23:11] from life
[1:23:13] there god has been working to bring
[1:23:15] heaven back to man again
[1:23:18] and so in the very instance of the fall
[1:23:22] when
[1:23:23] when man was going out of the garden and
[1:23:26] leaving heaven's atmosphere
[1:23:29] cursed and sent out because of
[1:23:32] disobedience
[1:23:33] at that same time god released a plan
[1:23:37] that he would become the seed
[1:23:40] he would be the seed of the woman who
[1:23:44] would bruise the head of the serpent and
[1:23:47] he would deliver man from the from the
[1:23:50] fear of death and that's why jesus came
[1:23:53] that when man couldn't bring heaven down
[1:23:56] upon the earth
[1:23:58] god came to earth and brought heaven
[1:24:01] down and while upon the earth jesus
[1:24:04] showed and revealed his plan of
[1:24:07] reconciliation and everything he did
[1:24:10] when he attended funerals he raised the
[1:24:13] dead when he
[1:24:15] you see when he met a blind man he
[1:24:17] opened the eyes of the blind to show
[1:24:20] i am the restorer
[1:24:22] i am the one who
[1:24:24] brings life and from that life i'm
[1:24:27] restoring sight he healed the leper to
[1:24:30] show he is the lord over the most
[1:24:33] dreaded diseases
[1:24:35] and as a man jesus faced every trial and
[1:24:38] hurt that is known to man and he came to
[1:24:41] bear the penalty of sin to make a path
[1:24:44] to heaven
[1:24:46] and as the promised seed he was bruised
[1:24:49] he was ground to make bread so that we
[1:24:52] could eat and partake of the fruit of
[1:24:55] the tree of his life and live forever
[1:24:59] and jesus came to make the way
[1:25:02] back from man to live eternally
[1:25:06] he came to make the way back to life
[1:25:09] again a life of heaven and it was this
[1:25:12] clear path to life
[1:25:15] and from death that jesus made for us
[1:25:19] but however
[1:25:22] when brother jerome when his old house
[1:25:24] could no longer sustain him
[1:25:27] because it was broken down by age and
[1:25:29] illness
[1:25:31] jesus was there to receive him and give
[1:25:33] him a complete health
[1:25:36] and a new house
[1:25:39] one not made with hands
[1:25:42] one that this body at best only reflects
[1:25:45] a poor image of
[1:25:48] and i must say to the family here at
[1:25:50] this moment this time
[1:25:52] you have your right to your time of
[1:25:54] mourning but it may need not be for
[1:25:56] years and years
[1:25:58] it can be difficult i'll tell you from
[1:26:00] experience
[1:26:02] it'll come sometimes very difficult with
[1:26:04] waves of emotion sometimes it'll creep
[1:26:07] up and spill over at the most
[1:26:10] unexpected times
[1:26:12] but you know like an eagle blown down in
[1:26:14] a storm we don't have to stay down
[1:26:18] we can
[1:26:19] right now plan to rise again to rise
[1:26:22] above our grief
[1:26:24] i'll just tell you
[1:26:25] may not comfort us much but actually
[1:26:28] millions times millions have been
[1:26:30] exactly where you are today
[1:26:33] and at some point you have to open the
[1:26:35] door to allow the fresh winds of joy to
[1:26:38] blow through your wings
[1:26:40] where you can fly in the heavens again
[1:26:44] and i've had to do the same thing
[1:26:46] after it just experienced the loss of my
[1:26:49] own wife jerome's sister some nearly 11
[1:26:52] months ago now
[1:26:54] and sometimes
[1:26:55] people get some odd ideas you know jesus
[1:26:58] he just came and took our loved one from
[1:27:00] us that's a cruel god that would take a
[1:27:02] young child or our loving parents or a
[1:27:05] grandparent that we loved our spouse and
[1:27:07] just jerk them out of our arms
[1:27:09] and take them into heaven that that's a
[1:27:12] cruel god to take him away from us god
[1:27:14] doesn't do that
[1:27:17] god does not come and forcibly take our
[1:27:19] loved ones from our families
[1:27:21] and from our beloved friends but rather
[1:27:24] when our bodies can no longer work
[1:27:28] when the heart quits beating
[1:27:30] jesus is there to receive them
[1:27:33] to give them a new body a body from
[1:27:36] heaven
[1:27:37] one that can't die one that will never
[1:27:39] get sick one that will never sorrow or
[1:27:42] ever have pain
[1:27:44] i go to prepare a place
[1:27:47] these are the words of jesus this place
[1:27:49] will be heaven for you
[1:27:51] so
[1:27:52] that when your mortal frame can no
[1:27:54] longer sustain life anymore i'll receive
[1:27:58] you
[1:27:59] into a mansion now sometimes we think
[1:28:01] mansions all will be gold knobs and all
[1:28:04] beautiful sitting up on a hill and
[1:28:06] radiant and oh my everything is just
[1:28:09] exclusive and and more more beauty than
[1:28:12] you can ever wonder the real mansion
[1:28:15] is a new body
[1:28:18] the real mansion
[1:28:20] that he went to prepare for you
[1:28:22] a way to enter out of
[1:28:24] mortal life
[1:28:26] into immortal life and to live
[1:28:30] in a mansion
[1:28:31] this house we live in at best is a pest
[1:28:35] house
[1:28:36] it is far from a mansion
[1:28:39] it decays and as the song would say
[1:28:43] you know
[1:28:45] about the old house we're living in is
[1:28:48] needing repair and the windows and and
[1:28:51] the shutters are letting in the cold
[1:28:52] cold air
[1:28:54] and and you know the whole thought of it
[1:28:56] is is that
[1:28:58] this body here can only sustain life for
[1:29:01] just a little while and it's only a
[1:29:04] temporary dwelling place and i want to
[1:29:06] say thank god it's only temporary
[1:29:09] thank god that there is a door called
[1:29:12] death that we
[1:29:13] can enter into
[1:29:15] that no longer has to scare us as
[1:29:18] believers
[1:29:19] but we can enter in there knowing that
[1:29:22] we will or enter into life into the joys
[1:29:26] of
[1:29:28] of that has been prepared from the
[1:29:31] foundation of the world
[1:29:34] that day of brother jerome's passing i
[1:29:35] can think we can all envision that
[1:29:37] glorious entrance
[1:29:39] that happens as the saints eagerly await
[1:29:42] to welcome the new arrivals
[1:29:46] i think of jerome how many times that i
[1:29:48] saw him
[1:29:49] exhibit his
[1:29:51] his uh
[1:29:53] his little trait that he had a lot of
[1:29:55] times you know and get out off from work
[1:29:58] he would show he still had some energy
[1:30:00] left after the day was over and walking
[1:30:03] out with
[1:30:04] from from his work he would jump up and
[1:30:06] click his heels together
[1:30:09] i can just imagine the other day
[1:30:12] about eight o'clock in the morning
[1:30:14] when he drew this last breath
[1:30:17] he stepped over there into that
[1:30:19] bluegrass field
[1:30:22] and looked around for a moment and
[1:30:23] realized where he was and the kind of
[1:30:26] clothes he had on
[1:30:27] he no longer was wearing the rags
[1:30:30] the old chattered garment
[1:30:33] of age
[1:30:34] with gray hair he was young again his
[1:30:37] hands were new
[1:30:39] he could look down his feet was new
[1:30:42] i can imagine all of a sudden he just
[1:30:43] jumped up and clicked his heels together
[1:30:46] amen
[1:30:48] you see
[1:30:50] when brother branham went beyond the
[1:30:52] curtain of time and
[1:30:53] he saw that wonderful place he said they
[1:30:55] were coming to him by the millions and
[1:30:57] they were screaming with the light and
[1:30:59] and many of them were just clapping him
[1:31:01] on the back saying we knew you were
[1:31:03] coming
[1:31:04] you you finally arrived
[1:31:07] and i think of it when my own wife
[1:31:09] pastor 11 months ago
[1:31:12] you know
[1:31:14] just the night before that she passed
[1:31:17] there
[1:31:18] she had been laying comatose and
[1:31:20] unresponsive for
[1:31:22] two weeks had moved a muscle
[1:31:25] and had been
[1:31:26] you know had not talked had not opened
[1:31:28] her eyes and not responded
[1:31:30] for
[1:31:31] right at two weeks
[1:31:33] and in the middle of the night i get a
[1:31:35] call from
[1:31:36] the hospital there and said mr pruitt we
[1:31:38] have to inform you we found your wife on
[1:31:41] the floor
[1:31:42] and i said
[1:31:45] no how did that happen
[1:31:47] they said we don't know
[1:31:49] i said where the rails up yes they were
[1:31:51] all up except the end one on the end of
[1:31:54] the bed
[1:31:55] and to get down there she would have to
[1:31:57] scoot down to the end of the bed
[1:31:59] and then throw her feet on the side
[1:32:02] and she said it was as if she stood up
[1:32:05] and put her feet on the floor
[1:32:08] and having her
[1:32:09] the little socks on
[1:32:11] slid there on the floor and sat down and
[1:32:14] laid over and that's how we found her we
[1:32:17] just been out of the room 10 minutes
[1:32:20] you see she was reaching
[1:32:22] for that supernatural realm
[1:32:25] no doubt she was already seeing the
[1:32:28] other side and
[1:32:29] and was already moving out of her bed
[1:32:32] reaching moving toward that
[1:32:35] you see
[1:32:38] just a few days before her passing
[1:32:41] one of our brothers here
[1:32:43] had a he's a very solid christian never
[1:32:46] wanted to make up stuff
[1:32:48] and whose words can be trusted but about
[1:32:50] six o'clock in the morning he was
[1:32:52] awakened
[1:32:53] and there as he was awake a man came
[1:32:55] walking into his bedroom holding a
[1:32:58] parchment
[1:32:59] paper in his hand of an official
[1:33:01] document
[1:33:02] and the angel said
[1:33:04] this is the status to certify that karen
[1:33:08] pruitt is to be ushered to the other
[1:33:10] side
[1:33:12] and so what does this tell us
[1:33:14] it tells us that his eyes on the sparrow
[1:33:18] in the smallest details of life
[1:33:21] so i know that he watches me he's got
[1:33:24] our lives in his hands
[1:33:26] he has us in his control
[1:33:28] our days are numbered here upon the
[1:33:30] earth and he limits the time of our
[1:33:33] suffering here
[1:33:35] you see
[1:33:36] you see
[1:33:38] satan could not drown noah in the flood
[1:33:42] until the purpose of god had been
[1:33:44] finished
[1:33:45] he couldn't burn the hebrew children
[1:33:48] up until the purpose of god was finished
[1:33:52] he could not kill job with boils and and
[1:33:56] troubles until the purpose of god had
[1:33:59] been finished lions could not eat daniel
[1:34:02] until god's purpose had been finished
[1:34:04] and neither could death and old age take
[1:34:07] abraham
[1:34:08] until the purpose of god is finished and
[1:34:11] neither can he take you
[1:34:14] or me
[1:34:15] until god's purpose of our life here is
[1:34:18] finished
[1:34:20] and our brother jerome his life was
[1:34:22] certainly not without purpose nope
[1:34:25] god used him as a vessel to support me
[1:34:27] as this pastor to support this church to
[1:34:30] help us to herald the message around the
[1:34:32] world he helped to make this church what
[1:34:35] it is today
[1:34:37] and yet today is not the end
[1:34:40] life must go on
[1:34:41] this church must go on as i preached to
[1:34:44] you recently that we're at a junction
[1:34:46] this is part of that junction the family
[1:34:49] must go on
[1:34:50] and today
[1:34:52] we are still here as mortals but brother
[1:34:54] jerome is not he has entered the realms
[1:34:57] of the immortal
[1:34:59] you see jerome had a terminal disease as
[1:35:02] we all do
[1:35:04] think of it
[1:35:05] you'd be shocked if the doctor told you
[1:35:08] you're terminally ill but i'm telling
[1:35:10] you today
[1:35:11] you've got a terminal situation going on
[1:35:15] the current
[1:35:17] death rate of your condition
[1:35:20] called mortality is 100
[1:35:25] and unless jesus comes
[1:35:27] we are all going to die
[1:35:31] and we don't like to think about it but
[1:35:33] you see we are forced to have to think
[1:35:35] about our own mortality and and of
[1:35:38] course that means that worldwide three
[1:35:40] people die every second
[1:35:42] that means 180 die every minute
[1:35:46] that means nearly 11 000 every hour
[1:35:49] and since the bible is right about what
[1:35:52] happens to his after death
[1:35:54] it means that more than 250 000 people
[1:35:58] every day either go to heaven or hell
[1:36:02] so we got to be prepared
[1:36:04] we got to be prepared to leave this
[1:36:06] realm
[1:36:07] of mortality
[1:36:09] and to enter
[1:36:10] the realm of the immortal
[1:36:13] and it's going to happen by death
[1:36:15] or by rapture
[1:36:18] so what will you have done with your
[1:36:19] life
[1:36:21] you know
[1:36:23] brother drum gives me a whole lot to
[1:36:25] work with
[1:36:27] unfortunately i have buried some
[1:36:30] that didn't give leave me much to say
[1:36:35] but brother jerome gave me a life that i
[1:36:38] could we could talk about hours of a
[1:36:40] christian life and christian examples
[1:36:42] and
[1:36:43] and i'll tell you this
[1:36:45] you want to see
[1:36:46] you want to see his testimony you want
[1:36:48] to see his works look at his family
[1:36:51] look what god has done with him look at
[1:36:53] the heritage
[1:36:55] look at the testimony you are written
[1:36:57] epistles
[1:36:58] of his life and his testimony
[1:37:01] but the time will come where you will
[1:37:04] also have to give an account
[1:37:06] what will you do
[1:37:07] today with the rest of your life
[1:37:11] we ought to be able to walk out of here
[1:37:14] inspired by this man and his ministry to
[1:37:16] press on higher
[1:37:18] to pick up the torch that he left us by
[1:37:21] his departure that he was forced to lay
[1:37:23] down
[1:37:25] and
[1:37:26] we
[1:37:27] must now run to the finish line we got
[1:37:29] to finish the race
[1:37:32] as i spoke with brother jerome one of
[1:37:34] the last times that i
[1:37:36] spoke with him i you know he was failing
[1:37:38] to thrive the doctor said and i did
[1:37:41] everything i could to kind of encourage
[1:37:43] him and say jerome you know
[1:37:45] you know i need you you know you've been
[1:37:46] my support you've been a strong arm
[1:37:48] you've been an encouragement and i still
[1:37:50] need you
[1:37:51] and the church needs you you're you you
[1:37:54] you've been a blessing to us
[1:37:56] you got to just
[1:37:58] kick yourself in the rear
[1:37:59] and and get going and you know drink
[1:38:02] water eat food do whatever you got to do
[1:38:05] get stronger get a goal in mind walk
[1:38:07] toward a perfect a well person
[1:38:12] but you see
[1:38:14] jerome had decided
[1:38:16] i'm ready to go
[1:38:20] he was fighting his last few battles
[1:38:24] his life was short
[1:38:27] short
[1:38:28] yeah it's too short even when we die at
[1:38:30] 79.
[1:38:32] but life is like that is but a vapor
[1:38:36] but james said you don't know the least
[1:38:39] thing about what may happen tomorrow
[1:38:41] or what's the nature of your life
[1:38:43] you're just a wisp
[1:38:45] a vapor a puff of smoke a mist that is
[1:38:48] visible for a little while and this
[1:38:50] disappears from this realm into midair
[1:38:53] it's gone
[1:38:56] all our strength finally turns to
[1:38:58] weakness
[1:38:59] yeah that man that was so strong
[1:39:02] to work all day on the job walk out and
[1:39:04] click his heels together
[1:39:07] since turned to vapor
[1:39:09] the bible said you've made my days a
[1:39:11] mere hand breath
[1:39:13] the span of my years is nothing before
[1:39:15] you
[1:39:16] each man's life is but a breath
[1:39:20] he says again remember how short my life
[1:39:23] is how empty and futile
[1:39:25] is this human existence no one can live
[1:39:28] forever speaking of here on the earth
[1:39:30] all will die
[1:39:32] no one can escape the power of the grave
[1:39:34] and so that reminds us that life passes
[1:39:37] quickly
[1:39:38] don't put it off
[1:39:40] don't put off what is really important
[1:39:44] you need to know that every moment slips
[1:39:46] quietly into the past
[1:39:48] and that should inspire us to make the
[1:39:51] most out of every second of our life
[1:39:53] because we're going to give an account
[1:39:55] you see even limited in regret and the
[1:39:58] should haves and the could haves and the
[1:40:00] woodhouse
[1:40:01] it should give us courage to make the
[1:40:03] best
[1:40:04] and to give the best of me every day
[1:40:08] but as we think about for a moment
[1:40:11] i want to just close
[1:40:13] you know as we as we think of this
[1:40:16] because we
[1:40:18] we are
[1:40:20] we we are really living in the very
[1:40:24] climax of this world's history
[1:40:28] and
[1:40:29] the present earth where we live is an
[1:40:32] in-between world
[1:40:34] it is touched by both heaven
[1:40:38] and hell
[1:40:40] and earth leads directly to heaven
[1:40:44] or directly to hell
[1:40:47] this life affords you
[1:40:50] a choice between two
[1:40:53] you say
[1:40:54] oh
[1:40:55] that was adam he shouldn't have done
[1:40:57] that but you see before you
[1:41:00] is set
[1:41:01] the tree of life
[1:41:03] or the tree of knowledge
[1:41:06] or death
[1:41:07] and you today
[1:41:09] have the right to choose between death
[1:41:12] and life
[1:41:14] which tree
[1:41:16] you will eat up
[1:41:18] jesus said if you eat of me you will
[1:41:21] never die
[1:41:23] because his
[1:41:25] the fruit from his tree
[1:41:27] brings us into immortal life and
[1:41:30] the fruit from the tree of knowledge
[1:41:32] only brings more sorrow
[1:41:34] and more death
[1:41:36] and finally
[1:41:38] an eternal separation from god
[1:41:41] and in
[1:41:42] to life completely
[1:41:45] for the soul that sinneth the bible said
[1:41:48] it shall die
[1:41:50] so for the believer
[1:41:52] this wretched life is the closest you
[1:41:55] will ever come to hell
[1:41:57] think of that
[1:42:00] the wretched life that we have
[1:42:02] is the closest you'll ever come to hell
[1:42:05] but for the sinner
[1:42:08] this is the closest you will ever come
[1:42:11] to heaven
[1:42:13] think of that the best of this life
[1:42:15] center is
[1:42:16] the only taste of heaven
[1:42:19] you'll ever have
[1:42:21] this present earth before it's renewed
[1:42:24] and the new jerusalem comes down upon it
[1:42:26] is an in-between world and it's touched
[1:42:28] by both heaven and earth and hell and in
[1:42:31] this dimension in this realm demons come
[1:42:34] and they inhabit people
[1:42:38] and in this realm spirits a spirit comes
[1:42:41] to inhabit people it's called the holy
[1:42:42] spirit
[1:42:44] so you're going to be possessed by one
[1:42:46] or the other
[1:42:47] and you can choose who's the king in
[1:42:49] your life
[1:42:51] so in this realm
[1:42:53] angels come
[1:42:54] angels have been seen in this realm not
[1:42:56] through the bible just in the bible days
[1:42:59] but in this day angels have been seen in
[1:43:01] this realm and they they can live they
[1:43:03] can walk they can experience things in
[1:43:05] this dimensions
[1:43:07] it's their spirits the bible said he
[1:43:09] made his angel spirits
[1:43:11] and there's one particular spirit that
[1:43:13] comes to live within us it's called the
[1:43:15] holy spirit
[1:43:17] and that's what we receive when we're
[1:43:19] born again so in this present world it's
[1:43:21] an in-between world and is touched by
[1:43:24] both heaven and hell
[1:43:29] so you've got to make a choice
[1:43:31] you're here presented a choice between
[1:43:34] life
[1:43:35] or
[1:43:36] death and you cannot go on pretending
[1:43:40] that this world is the only world we'll
[1:43:42] ever know
[1:43:44] that we'll ever live in because one
[1:43:46] breath
[1:43:47] from here
[1:43:48] is another world
[1:43:50] and that's how far away our loved one is
[1:43:52] he's just one breath
[1:43:54] away
[1:43:56] never forget you're that close
[1:44:01] you say well i can't see it i can't feel
[1:44:03] it it's but it's beyond the senses the
[1:44:06] human senses around the mortal but it's
[1:44:08] not that far away one breath
[1:44:11] and this life is only a temporary life
[1:44:15] but let me tell you
[1:44:18] you know there
[1:44:21] there is
[1:44:22] not just
[1:44:24] a heaven
[1:44:25] but there is a hell
[1:44:28] people don't want to hear about that
[1:44:31] but it's
[1:44:32] bible and you're going to go to one
[1:44:35] place or the other
[1:44:36] and it is never god's going to send you
[1:44:39] there you're going to choose to go
[1:44:43] it lays within your choice
[1:44:46] there was a man
[1:44:47] he was a an atheist a self-declared
[1:44:50] atheist he was a a great artist he made
[1:44:53] sculptures he he had his phd
[1:44:56] and an art and he was a teacher a
[1:44:58] professor
[1:45:00] his name was
[1:45:01] harold storm
[1:45:04] and he was very successful in what he
[1:45:06] did
[1:45:07] and um he was in france with his
[1:45:09] students and he was very vain very proud
[1:45:12] he was an atheist let everybody know
[1:45:14] there was no god
[1:45:17] when while he was in france
[1:45:20] on one of his tours with his artwork
[1:45:24] he took a
[1:45:26] a problem within his stomach
[1:45:28] and his bowels were cut off and he was
[1:45:30] dying
[1:45:33] and as he was dying there
[1:45:35] they were trying to get emergency
[1:45:37] surgery but
[1:45:39] be in france
[1:45:41] they
[1:45:43] and the way that it was running at that
[1:45:45] time
[1:45:47] it was a holiday and the doctors went
[1:45:49] home
[1:45:51] and the life
[1:45:53] the life given surgery that he would
[1:45:55] need to extend his life was now
[1:45:59] the chance was gone he only had a short
[1:46:01] window that this operation would have to
[1:46:04] be done
[1:46:07] and so
[1:46:08] he was in such pain and agony and as he
[1:46:11] was he was dying and he told his wife
[1:46:13] goodbye
[1:46:15] and he just turned his face to the wall
[1:46:18] as it was and
[1:46:19] and and could not and his wife was could
[1:46:22] not look upon him and was
[1:46:24] sitting there crying
[1:46:26] and and he was dying he was drawing his
[1:46:28] last breath
[1:46:30] and suddenly
[1:46:32] he was outside his body
[1:46:35] and he was looking down at his body and
[1:46:38] he was well he was fine he was
[1:46:40] wasn't sick at all and he saw his body
[1:46:43] laying there but he felt fine
[1:46:46] so he
[1:46:47] he went over to his wife and tried to
[1:46:50] speak to her
[1:46:51] and said i quit crying and i'm i'm fine
[1:46:54] i i'm i'm i'm fine now
[1:46:57] and she didn't hear him she just went on
[1:46:59] crying
[1:47:01] and he screamed at her and she could not
[1:47:03] hear and he began to curse her and say
[1:47:05] all kinds of vulgar things and she never
[1:47:07] heard there was a man in the in the
[1:47:10] company bed in the room that was also
[1:47:12] waiting on the surgery and he went over
[1:47:14] to him and he began to try to talk to
[1:47:16] him and he couldn't see him and he
[1:47:18] didn't couldn't rouse him but he said i
[1:47:20] was alive and i looked around and
[1:47:24] and
[1:47:25] i was frustrated because
[1:47:28] my wife couldn't hear me and this man
[1:47:30] and and i screamed at him and i was i
[1:47:33] said you know i i
[1:47:36] i
[1:47:36] i must walk out and see and he walked to
[1:47:40] the door and he found that there was a
[1:47:41] company of men that and women that had
[1:47:44] come
[1:47:45] there and said we're we're going to
[1:47:47] we're going to take you now you're to go
[1:47:49] with us and he said oh good he said i'm
[1:47:51] sick
[1:47:52] you know and i need this surgery and i
[1:47:54] must have it it'll spare my life and
[1:47:56] i've been waiting here yes you know
[1:47:59] follow us and we know all about it and
[1:48:02] they begin to follow me and they kept
[1:48:03] going and going and going he said surely
[1:48:06] we'd have got to the operating room but
[1:48:07] now they're moving out of that realm and
[1:48:09] to another and to another into another
[1:48:11] and they'll keep going and and and the
[1:48:13] further he goes he's and he begins to
[1:48:15] realize there's something wrong
[1:48:17] uh you know you're not
[1:48:19] what are you doing where where are we
[1:48:21] going and then they begin to mock him
[1:48:23] and curse him and make fun of him
[1:48:27] and and
[1:48:28] he
[1:48:29] he he began to protest no i'm not going
[1:48:33] with you another step and they began to
[1:48:34] punch him and pull at him and tear him
[1:48:37] tear at him
[1:48:39] and and and they pulled him down into a
[1:48:41] place of darkness
[1:48:45] and he said in this place of darkness
[1:48:48] every one of these began to tear at me
[1:48:50] and he said i was i was could handle
[1:48:52] myself i was like a could like a boxer
[1:48:55] and i was landing some blows at them and
[1:48:57] hit him back and everything else but
[1:48:59] dave was tearing at me and they tore
[1:49:02] pieces of me and they tore my eyeballs
[1:49:04] out and they tore other body parts off
[1:49:06] and and finally i was just
[1:49:09] just a mass of wretched humanity laying
[1:49:14] in the floor
[1:49:17] haunted
[1:49:19] by all of the horrible things
[1:49:22] that i'd done
[1:49:25] and in the moment
[1:49:27] he began to hear a voice that said to
[1:49:29] him
[1:49:30] pray
[1:49:32] and he says
[1:49:34] i don't believe in god
[1:49:36] i'll tell you what you get in that place
[1:49:39] you'll be a believer
[1:49:43] i don't believe in god
[1:49:45] and the voice said back to him pray
[1:49:49] and he said well i don't know how to
[1:49:50] pray i've never prayed in my life or
[1:49:53] when i was a kid maybe i might have said
[1:49:55] a bedtime prayer and you know how how
[1:49:57] can i pray what what's what shall i say
[1:50:00] and and he began to he began to think of
[1:50:03] anything you know uh god bless america
[1:50:06] my country's history and and uh
[1:50:10] you know all kinds of things uh
[1:50:13] trying to think of something about god
[1:50:15] that he could mention and he noticed
[1:50:16] when he would mention the name of jesus
[1:50:19] or speak about god it would terrify
[1:50:22] these these uh ones that was torment him
[1:50:25] around him
[1:50:28] and so he began to say it louder and he
[1:50:31] began to call out jesus
[1:50:34] jesus
[1:50:37] and as he began to call out jesus they
[1:50:39] moved further away from him
[1:50:42] and and he said
[1:50:45] if i ever wanted to believe in jesus
[1:50:49] it was now
[1:50:51] ever i ever wanted to believe that he
[1:50:53] was real i wanted to believe now
[1:50:57] and i cried out jesus
[1:51:00] help me
[1:51:02] come to me help me save me
[1:51:05] and he said from a distance
[1:51:07] i saw a light approaching
[1:51:10] and he said that light became greater
[1:51:12] and greater
[1:51:13] and out of it stepped a man
[1:51:16] and he picked me up
[1:51:18] and he took me and he put me all back
[1:51:21] together
[1:51:22] all of my broken pieces
[1:51:25] and he held me like a child
[1:51:27] to his bosom
[1:51:29] and from there
[1:51:31] he was carried through dimensions
[1:51:34] faster than
[1:51:36] than you could think
[1:51:38] into a realm
[1:51:40] of eternal bliss
[1:51:42] into realm where he saw a new jerusalem
[1:51:46] we saw redeemed people
[1:51:49] people just like him
[1:51:51] who had accepted the pardon
[1:51:54] of almighty god
[1:52:04] he could then say
[1:52:05] jesus
[1:52:07] loves me
[1:52:10] it became personal to him
[1:52:13] rising up from out of that
[1:52:16] he would live to go through the surgery
[1:52:19] and then become a preacher of the gospel
[1:52:23] telling others
[1:52:24] of the horrors
[1:52:26] of the land
[1:52:28] that we don't want to go to
[1:52:32] and of the choice
[1:52:34] that heaven offers
[1:52:38] i want you to think about it today
[1:52:42] you have a choice
[1:52:46] a man
[1:52:47] like jerome
[1:52:49] our brother
[1:52:50] can be a witness to you
[1:52:52] there is a christian life
[1:52:55] there is a power of overcoming
[1:52:58] there is a joy in serving god and there
[1:53:01] are
[1:53:02] benefits
[1:53:03] that come
[1:53:05] by serving him
[1:53:07] all the benefits
[1:53:09] are not in the land beyond
[1:53:11] but they're right here
[1:53:14] the choices that he made has had effects
[1:53:17] upon now generations of his family
[1:53:22] the choice you make
[1:53:24] well how
[1:53:25] consequences
[1:53:27] from this moment on
[1:53:29] and i'd like you to bow your head with
[1:53:31] me just a moment
[1:53:34] because i want to encourage you today to
[1:53:36] choose life
[1:53:40] you do not have to keep going down the
[1:53:42] path
[1:53:43] of sin
[1:53:45] you cannot don't have to go on
[1:53:48] pretending that everything is all right
[1:53:52] you can have that encounter with god as
[1:53:54] jerome did
[1:53:55] now 46 years ago
[1:53:58] where he gave his life to the lord and i
[1:54:00] baptized him in christian baptism the
[1:54:03] only way
[1:54:04] the only name that you can be saved in
[1:54:06] the name of jesus christ and i buried
[1:54:09] him in his old past
[1:54:11] in the name of the lord jesus christ and
[1:54:13] a watery grave and that old man had died
[1:54:17] and he rose again a new creation in
[1:54:19] christ
[1:54:20] out of that watery grave which was
[1:54:22] typing the death burial in the
[1:54:23] resurrection and water baptism
[1:54:26] and he rose to live a new life
[1:54:29] and i want to ask you today
[1:54:32] i want to invite you today
[1:54:34] to make your calling your election sure
[1:54:38] because one moment
[1:54:40] one day
[1:54:41] you will come to this very place
[1:54:45] one breath away
[1:54:47] where will you be
[1:54:51] maybe
[1:54:52] in this moment
[1:54:56] the bible said draw nigh to god he'll
[1:54:58] nigh to you perhaps in this moment
[1:55:04] and i won't even look myself i'll just
[1:55:07] let you have a private moment
[1:55:09] and look down here at the pulpit myself
[1:55:12] but maybe you just like to make just a
[1:55:14] little move toward god just
[1:55:16] maybe it's not much but just a hand that
[1:55:19] would just raise toward him and say god
[1:55:23] today i make that right choice
[1:55:26] right here as we
[1:55:28] conclude this service
[1:55:30] and we speak about this legacy and the
[1:55:33] heritage
[1:55:34] that this great man left
[1:55:36] and the testimony of his life
[1:55:39] and the power of his god i want to know
[1:55:41] that christ too
[1:55:43] and i want to have him in my life i want
[1:55:46] to have the peace and the joy that all
[1:55:48] comes with it i want to surrender my
[1:55:50] life to him
[1:55:52] maybe today you'll just slip up a hand
[1:55:53] to him right now as we pray
[1:55:57] father
[1:56:00] in the name of jesus
[1:56:03] that name that is above all names that
[1:56:06] we have taken on lord
[1:56:09] by being obedient to your word having
[1:56:12] repented of our sins as the scripture
[1:56:14] said
[1:56:17] when peter was asked those words how
[1:56:20] what must we do to be saved
[1:56:23] repent
[1:56:24] and be baptized in the name of jesus
[1:56:26] christ for remission of sins
[1:56:29] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:56:30] holy ghost
[1:56:32] but this promise is to you to your
[1:56:34] children to them that are far off
[1:56:37] even as many as the lord our god shall
[1:56:39] call
[1:56:41] lord i don't know
[1:56:42] if you called any today
[1:56:45] but i pray lord if there was a hand
[1:56:47] lifted up towards you
[1:56:50] lord that today will be a day that
[1:56:53] they choose life and they move from this
[1:56:55] realm into
[1:56:57] a realm of coming to know you as lord
[1:56:59] and savior king of their life
[1:57:02] and their lives can be changed forever
