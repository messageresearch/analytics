chivalry or another drives a foreign car but lord when it comes down to you may we have one mind and one accord we want you oh god we want the reality of god in our lives and the holy spirit to move ever need supply we pray in jesus name thank you father don't pass us by now speak to us and may we welcome you in jesus name amen amen god bless you if you're to turn with me to genesis chapter 18 i'd like to read from one down through the eighth verse and then we'll read from the book of hebrews but genesis 18 verse 1 and the lord appeared unto him in the plains of mamrie and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day and he lift up his eyes and looked and lo behold and lo three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself down toward the ground and said my lord if i now if now i have found favor in thy sight pass not away i pray thee from thy servant let a little water i pray you be fetched and wash your feet and and rest yourselves up under the tree and and i will um fetch a morsel of bread and comfort ye your hearts and after that ye shall pass on for therefore you come to your servant and they said so do as thou has said and abraham hastened into the tent unto sarah and said make ready three three measures of fine meal kneaded and make cakes upon the heart and abraham ran unto the herd and fetched a calf tender and good and gave it to a young man and he hastened to dress it and he took butter and milk and the calf which he had dressed and set it before them and he stood by them under the tree and they did eat and then over hebrews chapter 13 we'll read two verses there verse 1 and 2. let brotherly love continue be not forgetful to entertain strangers for thereby some have entertained angels unaware amen god bless you as your seater we're going to speak today on entertaining angels before the end time the bible said the days of lot would repeat and in that day god sent angels to get lot of course out of sodom that represented the church and god sent the angels to get the elect to believe in you see sarah had to get on board she had to get on board with the promise and start believing and because she had languished now for years and years and years and seemingly had given up on the promise but god had to get his people to believe them that's what god wants people to do in this age he wants people that will believe him and abraham was watching and all of all the experiences uh that he'd ever had in prior times he was about to be crowned with an experience where he was going to be changed to receive the promised son you look also in second timothy 4 and 8 it talks about those that it says paul said there's a crown laid up for me of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give me of that day and not to me only but to all them that also love his appearing so you see he appears to though that love his appearing now honestly sarah was out kind of out of sorts at this time she was not believing she was not expecting as abraham was he was sitting in the tent door he was looking out she was back in the tent and um and she she was maybe not having the same kind of expectation but the thing about it is is god will always get his elect on board some are expecting and watching and looking and anticipating and some maybe get caught up in laodicea in the age that we're living this time where it's lukewarmness that predominates the age that we have to fight against so hard and some will get caught up in that but nevertheless no matter where you're caught today and what snare you've been snared under god is here to deliver you and to get you on board you believe in remember those that were there in the scripture or actually in the vision of brother branham that they were out of step with the word and and how to step with the tune of the gospel you remember the preview of the bride and how that happened and and he saw some of them get out of step he never did say no no no you're not bribed so therefore you're you're rejected because you got as a step no they were bribed and they had to get in the step so you see the prophet's voice streamed out saying get back in line and that's what we want to do today if i know my heart i believe i know yours that that you want to be in line you want to be in step with what god is doing in this day in this hour and now brother branham would uh say uh concerning this visitation to abraham as he compared it with the days of sodom and he said he said the day of visitation is here and i believe that we are here in the one of the greatest outpourings of the holy spirit where that he is emptying out on all that he promised into this age remember all that was in god he poured into christ till it was the fullness of the godhead bodily and then you know again all that was in christ he pours into the church and he has been doing this to the through south 2000 years in the seven church ages but in the last days he pours out his fullness so what an hour that we're living in what a day there's not quite ever been a day like this day to to the gentile ages for we we are privileged people called for a specific time a specific purpose now in this we we see that god would be working through human flesh we have been through it of god changing his mask and him getting the calcium the polish the dust of the earth and and blowing into it and stepping into it but of course we know that god doesn't do it that way now not that he isn't the same because he still uses dust but he has got your dust that he is redeemed so therefore god is still stepping into dust you that just received the gift of the holy ghost that was god stepping into dust that was the holy spirit coming into you where god would be tabernacled in man you see god wants more than a tabernacle in heaven or a tabernacle that we build with hands this isn't worthy for him and our bodies wouldn't be worthy for him except that he sanctified it and then he cleansed with cleansing he could fill it with the holy ghost now so again the day of visitation is here but many think oh but god doesn't send angels anymore but but you see he does because he is still manifest himself the holy spirit is that angel that's what i want to get to you amen the holy spirit is that angel the holy spirit is that person amen so you see there there again when when you received the gift of the holy ghost you were entertaining an angel you were bringing the angelic spirit of god into your life to come and abide with you what a wonderful thing that is brother brother branham would say this let me just quote it as it says the day of visitation is here you say oh god doesn't send angels anymore the holy spirit is that angel the holy spirit is that person the holy spirit jesus said he the holy ghost when he comes he will do the works that he did he'd be with us even in us and he would bring things to our remembrance that he taught and would show us things to come the works that i do shall he do also now we're living in that day we're living in the time so we're living in the very time as it was in the days of sodom and go we've got several classes of people you have the sodomites who absolutely go totally into sin you have the luddites who is the church that goes through the tribulation and then you have the bride the elect royal abraham the called out group that got that sign and he recognized it now so again it is the the dispensation of the holy ghost that we are in and it is continued on his community it's been on and will continue on by the administration of angels to the church but but they're but there are ordained saints of god sent from god to carry the thing out every man well there's a special calling back through the ages uh angels says visit man now not a worship of angels like brigham brigham young did and so on like that uh you know joseph smith but a an angel will testify to the truth of god you see it will declare god it won't have some kind of mythical something that no one understands it'll speak of jesus christ it'll testify jesus christ and produce jesus christ to the people amen so god still has angels and they visit the people now again it's angelic beings who are the attribute of god and they're sent forth to minister to the church through the people oh my how short we are of the real apostolic church today of the blessings of god we fall real short amen we ought to be a people who knows our god who does exploits amen the pillar of fire is among a man in demonstrating himself and showing himself alive and filling with the holy ghost the bible said in hebrews chapter 1 verse 14 that are not they all ministered spirits sent forth the minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation so they are actually there to minister to us brother branham would talk about them and he would he would pray he said god give us an outpouring of the holy spirit and he said may the angels of god come down into this city and the cities round about and throughout the country and visit homes and stir people amen visit homes and stir people don't you want the angels to visit your home amen don't you want the holy spirit to stir your heart amen to get you ready to cause your faith to advance and to get to the point that you realize there is nothing too hard for the lord amen that he is able to do its seed and abundantly above that which you're able to think or ask you see now god has always used angels in his work and there and of course there's never been one that is worshipped where he wouldn't stand for it a true angel doesn't stand to be worshiped whether he's an angel in the pulpit ministering the word he doesn't want worship he's not about kingdom building he's not trying to be the next great prophet and listen to me and follow me and i've got the word and this and that but he he's pointing you to christ get you in love with jesus christ amen the lisa the last thing we want around here is a bunch of little tim pruitt's amen we want sons and daughters of god we want them filled with the holy ghost we're not trying to reproduce another man we are wanting jesus christ manifested in human flesh that's what we want to see in the church [Applause] there was a man came to brother branham one of the theologians of the day and said brother adam you keep talking about that angel that visits you that's an error so in that scenario said god doesn't lead the church anymore by angels said that daniel and the prophets and them of the old testament they had the angels but the holy spirit leads the church and that's the last day he said that's that's true but they're still angels but he said that's not that's new testament doctrine brother branham he said oh sure there is sure it is you know to me theologian ought to know better than this but sometimes they get so blinded by their creed or their idea or their dogmas or their church their church theology because it ain't accepted here you know then they're blinded by it they don't even read the bible when the bible is very plain you know there the virgin mary was in the in the new testament an angel appeared and the man said oh but that was before the holy spirit come well he said what about philip did he had the holy ghost well there the angel of the of the lord there appeared to him and translated him and then and and gave him instructions what about saint paul did he have the holy ghost well sure he did well then what about peter did he have the holy ghost well what about peter when he was in prison a real angel a real angel not a mystic figure but something that reached down loosed his bonds opened the gates and then he went and escorted him out of prison is that right amen paul there after four day 18 days with no no moon no stars no nothing there hopes was gone the storm had taken them over and they were about to die and they they were hopeless and about that time the angel of god dropped down and said i was visited tonight by the angel of god who stood by me and said there'll not be one loss stay with the ship amen i just want you to know that same angel is screaming out to you today don't leave the message don't leave the ship stay with the good old gospel ship stay with the word amen because all that stay with the ship won't be lost hallelujah amen what about on the isle of patmos with john there was angels jesus said i jesus has set mine angel to testify these things if he was so interested in an angel being present to testify to john of the initiation of the book of revelation what about his fulfillment certainly there would be angels and let me just say something you sisters is not just men god sent an angel to hagar to the mother of samson to marry the mother of jesus they meant to women at the tomb of jesus announcing the resurrection and it's not just a great people that angels come not just to the educated and the fluent and the rich and the ritzy but it's to the poor and the humble to shepherds on the field the angels came and when angels came to not just astute christian but wayward sinners wayward men like jacob who had just cheated his brother and to moses a wayward prophet who had forgot about his commission and his calling angel still came amen even appeared to balaam a false prophet warned him don't you curse my people he appeared to gideon to deliver god's people from bondage to isaiah showing him the throne in the temple to ezekiel giving him revelations of glory to daniel saying you are greatly beloved i'd like to hear that wouldn't you amen to hear from the angel of god saying you are greatly beloved amen i believe that's what god is trying to tell you through the message of the hour you you're not forsaken you've not been forgotten maybe sometimes your prayers have been hindered but let me tell you this you are greatly beloved of the lord and i want you to understand the revelation of the last day you must get on board amen i'm gonna have a pride it should be without spot or without a wrinkle or without a blemish and i'm not gonna leave a one behind not a hump behind everyone is going our sons our daughters our grandchildren hallelujah husband our wives our loved ones everyone are going blessed be the name of the lord to john on the isle of patmos there are anointing angels with faces like a lion oxen a man an eagle i happen to be and so do you happen to be anointed by the flying eagle angels contend with the devil a man michael did over the body of moses angels fought and contended with the devil and when he was when when the angel was hindered by satan who was bringing a revelation to michael the archangel michael or to daniel rather the the archangel michael came and appeared and helped him angels appeared to zachariah in the bible opening his eyes to the seven golden lamp stands angels have appeared to you in this day and revealed to you what they mean the meaning of the seven golden candlesticks the meaning of the seven cities the meaning of the ages the meaning of the even the names of the angels to the church somebody help me preach amen angels are absolutely connected with this message in revelation 12 he leads in the fight where angelic battles become humans angels strengthen jesus on two occasions is that right there after his great trial in the wilderness angels came and ministered to him thereafter come on somebody at gethsemane angels came and strengthened him for the cross angels and if he would do it to the bridegroom come on somebody wouldn't the angels come and strengthen the bride as she goes through the most difficult age that there's ever been [Applause] you can count on angels to have your back hallelujah you can count on angels to walk this road with you you are not here alone amen he is there to guide you to lead you to show you and in the last days when things get so difficult daniel 12 1 and when things get so hard at that time at that time michael shall stand up the great prince was stranded for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time and at that same time thy people shall be somebody said delivered that's what the rapture is as a deliverance amen everyone that shall be found written in the book oh hallelujah angel's always present there when elisha was surrounded by all kinds of of evil men wanting to destroy him there he gazer looked out and saw the army and was troubled with all that was around and and he he said elisha laid his hand on his on the haze and said well there's more of us than them and he said well i don't see anything but the the evil out here i don't see anything but trouble he laid his hands on him and said open this boy's eyes lord and he saw that already right there beside him was angels of fire and horses of fire oh man chariots of fire round about elixir amen brother branham would always point out he said they didn't just come there they were there all the time the angel of god encamps about those who fears him and delivers them [Applause] angels have a lot of lot to do in guidance to our prepared place he said that behold i sent an angel before you to keep you in the way when your feet would have stumbled he gave charge over you he gave an angel charge over you lest you dash your foot against the stone amen to bring you into the place that i have prepared angels anoint men to preach yes amen since my youngest ministry there are man there have been people in the audience and said brother tim there was someone standing right there by you why you ministered i said he said in revelation 14 6 i saw another angel fly into the midst of heaven having everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth and to every nation intended and tongue in people what do you have an angel flying with the everlasting gospel anointing men to preach i don't mean to indicate that i'm the only one or that i'm the only one that an angel has stood by but no god anytime a man is anointed to preach it is with the everlasting gospel brought by an angel by an anointing [Applause] now it is coming he will send angels with the great sound of the trumpet and gather the elect from all directions amen let's not forget the mighty angel of revelation 10. amen is that right amen a specific special anointing for the last day for a special class of people now this same angel appeared in this day and gave direction and leadership and we we would see him in in the brother branham's ministry as i i've said many times people have problems with with brother branham and what he preached and and the doctrines that he brought will blame it on the angel the opening of the seven seals we have them because an angel interrupted his human thoughts somebody help me preach now amen if you see this is not the message of a kentucky preacher this is the message of almighty god to this last generation a divine gift administered by an angel you see brother branham saul said that he said now anyone knows that the pillar of fire that led to children of israel was the angel of the covenant is that right bible readers which was jesus christ moses esteemed the reproach of christ notice the reproach of christ greater than the treasures of egypt it was jesus christ he was in a pillar of fire that was the same angel that was in the bush of burning that same pillar of fire and he's been the guiding angel through the years and i want you to say i wanted to say brother branham said when i leave he will still be here hallelujah i'm glad for that but you know god does some wonderful things many times he he will visit your home and he will come right down to your place and you want your home to be a place that angels are welcome where the holy spirit is invited where he is the unseen guest at every table somebody help me preach now you remember zacharias and elizabeth here god appeared to zechariah to give them the promise of john the baptist being born human lives but the bible was saying they were living up right before the lord keeping all the statues and commandments of the lord living in perfect obedience to the word in the light that they had so you see they they had a home prepared for angelic visitation amen the bible the bible tells us this that that angels will visit our home oh i remember that day most profound day when the angel visited my home and my wife was laying there blind and unable to see i remember that day when bethany put the baby down little drew who had never walked crawled and was 18 months old and he was sitting there at the end of the bed set him down there unable to get up on his own and the angel of god came down through opened up my wife's eyes and healed a little baby true where he ran all over the all over the house those are the kind of things when angels visit a home amen brother brad i'm talking about visiting a home and wanted they couldn't eat her oatmeal her stomach burned the other had a growth and that growth disappeared because angels visited home because somebody didn't give up on a promise we ought not give up on our promise today that we can have him to visit this house that he can come by your view that he can bring a healing to your life that he can deliver you from your sin that your evil habits will be controlled by the angel of his presence the bible said when the angels when abraham saw the angels appearing abraham ran to meet them and bowed himself to the ground i want to just look at some of these thoughts for a little while today on entertaining angels because they're present and they must be welcomed amen we must have a place invited amen and the bible said about abraham he bowed himself before the ground which is a sign of submission reverence humility of recognizing greatness he was looking out the tent door he was under expectation that's what i'm trying to get you to do is move from the back to the front i don't mean on the front pews i'm talking about in your tent amen word that you come forward there in your experience where that you're not back here in a bad mood wondering if life is going to be the way it is and will we ever get out of this cycle of revival and death and will there ever be any hope is there any hope at all laying back there hopeless but getting out sitting there at the door and looking what's he going to do next hallelujah what's he going to do next he he put healing there for sister atlanta he put hair back on the head of sister mariah he there made a little baby drew to walk and there he puts back a blood brain bleed and gave us many more years all of these things in it but what's he going to do next we should never get to the place that we're so satisfied that god moved back then we should stay in this service in this time let it move my way praise the lord he bowed himself to the ground you know sometimes we get questioned about the ones that fall down before him now in our prayer lines that don't happen today that ain't message is in god that's only the devil for sure the devil can do that the devil can speak in tongues and man the devils can impersonate any gift that there is yes somebody help me preach now amen so yeah there can be impersonations but you know this happened in the methodist outpouring of sanctification happened all the time it was a regular occurrence in 1946 the angel of god appeared to brother branham he and sent him out with a gift of divine healing and in those meetings he found resistance of the angel's message of divine healing even among the pentecostals one assembly of god ministered there a pastor in in i believe it was in little rock did this happen and usually southern people are hospitable right and kind and and you know we're not trying to put ourselves above everybody else of the yankees that might be around or listening in or other countries but southerners are usually hospitable people you know we we don't call a minister by his first name we say brother amen we we show respect and honor we we we say yes sir and no sir even my grandkids expect me to say yes sir no sir to them but you see you you know they're because we train them when they're young you know to to show respect yes ma'am no ma'am respect i think that's good amen and so as we as we think of that that this man and this pastor in little rock when he found out he was asked to borrow some folding chairs for the meeting they run out of seats and he said anybody that believes that divine healing stuff and that angel stuff listen this was a pentecostal and he said anybody believes any of that or going to that meeting no they ain't going to sit in my chairs brother branham says the worst i was ever treated by an assembly of god preacher now that was the move of god at the time 1946 that that's the move that ff bosworth came out of that's the move that jack cole came up out of that's the move that a.a allen came out about that's the move that oral roberts came out of i'm just trying to show you give you a picture in those meetings he found resistance to the angel's message of divine healing you know it kind of made some of the pastors mad well you know they left my meeting to go there hear that hillbilly that fanatical talking about an angel and and so you know they the old formal established churches you know had got to a place where they no longer believed in miracles because they weren't happening in their churches so to excuse themselves being boy to the power of god they felt with they had superior knowledge of the word and they were too advanced for the supernatural and they thought the supernatural was only for an infant church one that was in its beginnings it wasn't for a mature church those that really had the word and were perfect and mature didn't need the supernatural you see if you were really establishing the word you were true dignified to receive childish things now during this during his rest between revivals you as you know brother branham would have a a breakdown from being eight days and nights in the prayer line giving himself because he promised to pray for everybody and the prayer line never ended because people drove out for miles to get people in there in that prayer line and during his rest between the two revivals brother branham went up to british columbia and he was tired and weary after hours upon hours and the prayer lines and spent days away from the pressures of the meetings refreshing himself miles miles from civilization civilization he was there in the pristine forest of british columbia hunting it was there that he had been got out and was on a horse they had about 20 22 horses out there and packed out other ministers that went along and they were thousand miles from a hard top road and he got to chasing a grizzly on a horse not something i would do but apparently something he enjoyed doing and he said i wanted to get up to see what the old fellow looked like i'd want to get a better view of him and he said i i got turned around back there in the mountains kind of lost my way and i was way out after dark and the moon had come out and i could see kind of see but it was cloudy and i saw a snowstorm was coming and i found my direction on which way to go back and because there was no roads or nothing for hundreds of miles and it was late and he said i as i was traveling through he said i come up over an old burnover and he said that where the fire had burnt down all the wood and everything like that those big trees standing split all split and sap all burnt out of them and everything to bark you standing there it was a big stately looking tree and i looked there and the first thing i know it was the spookiest looking place i had ever come to and i looked and i thought look at that moon shining on them old white trees it just looked like my what is that looked like a graveyard and a lot of tombstones so he said it you know it was kind of spooky for him and he wanted to ride on but something spoke to him and said stay here just for a minute and i i but i'm hungry argue that i'm i'm starved and i'm ready to go and i got miles to go you know i got about five mile more miles go over another mountain what do you want me to stop here for and so but i stopped for a minute and he said the wind started blowing and he said there's a wind come down from heaven them trees went [Music] and i said talk about lonesome spooky place i said lord what in the world do you want me to stop here for and and he said that but you wanted me to stop here and i i want me to stand here for a while maybe i better just pray a little while and i got down and prayed a little bit and the wind come back through and and moved back through them old stately um tombstone-looking trees that were dead and said as he howled through them and i said i thought of what joel said now his mind goes to the scripture and he's placed in this experience with the scripture what the palmer worm left the caterpillar eating what the caterpillar ate the cankerworms ate and he said this was once a great forest it was green trees but there come a great fire and burn all the things and now just like a big bunch of churches great big spires sticking up like that just look like a bunch of tombstones a thousand degrees below zero walk in there and say amen and they turn around and the pastor get a deacon and take him outside the door why do you interrupt me when you're hollering a man and then brother braden said well you interrupt me when you don't holler amen and he's saying i'm looking around there and no spirit in it just as dead as a tombstone and he said that's the way it is with these big formal churches no doubt sure methodist baptist all of them big churches one time but now what makes that wind make them sound so mournful and i got to thinking that they'll come one day suddenly from heaven like a rushing mighty wind and filled all the house where they were sitting and i said god can send down an old-time pentecostal revival and all the churches has to do uh do is mourn when it hits them they're stiff they're dead they can't move they come there's no such thing as divine healing oh divine healing is gone the days of miracles pass oh there's no such thing as gifts of the spirit just pouring the holy ghost out just moving through their members say oh don't believe that fanaticism we are churches look here we got ritual we're recorded but brother you're dead the devil's fire has burned all the bark off of you you ain't got no lively yet no left yeah just a big bunch of ritualistic tombstone and the only thing you can do is just moan and cry and go on remember what they're moaning and crying is because they're they're saying days of miracles are past there's no more healing god doesn't move like he used to and and he thought it said i thought well lord that's really what it is said you know that as the the palmer worm left the caterpillar ate what caterpillar left and the locust state with the lutherans left the method is saying and what the method has left the baptism satan the baptist left nazarene and what nazarene left the pentecostal state and the whole thing is lead down and he said you know till the church don't know what to believe anymore and he said um because what the lutherans left what the method has come and taken what they had and the baptist took what they had now retake what they had built from holiness took what they had the pentecost had taken what they had look at the board tree i said oh god what to do now he's realizing what he is seeing is exactly what he's been experiencing out in this campaign he is seeing oh dead morgues of churches when the wind is blowing and the angel is moving and the holy ghost is sweeping through they are resisting it because the life is gone and he said then i saw over in the second chapter of joel he said i will restore saith the lord and i said god what what could you restore surely you know these these old dead trees won't come back to life surely these tombstones won't come back to life surely that's not going to be that and he said they're just an old dead thing an old stump and the moon shining on it they're a tombstone dead is 12 o'clock midnight the wind comes through and you know and i thought well you can't make that thing move lord because it hasn't got any life in it so how are you going to restore it he's the first thing that won't let you preach this kind of gospel in the pulpit and he said that's right oh that guy he's a holy roller don't want nothing to do with him that's right the members would bring you in and i'll have to consult the board and the deacon and all this and and it goes through all that no no no right down the road don't tell me he said i've been there remember this he would face rejection over and over and over again with the greatest vindication divine vindication ever given to the gentile ages now so he said again he said um um he said i thought lord what are you going to restore and he tied his horse and sat down on the log and listened to them going and he's contemplating well how are you ever going to bring revival how are you ever going to bring a restoration and he said i looked down there and i began to hear as the wind blowed i began to hear also frolic frolic frolic frolic and he said i saw some little mini trees that was coming up underneath them and i said there you are lord i will restore saith the lord right in that same forest come up and under growth what they call backwash today what they call fanaticism today and i said look at the difference when the wind hits these here they say but when it hits these little green ones they've got life in it it just frolics and jumps up and down and oh holy ghost old-fashioned holy ghost revival i will restore saith the lord hallelujah amen so you see again he said he said god is restoring down here now from this undergrowth is coming up a bunch of people that's frolic and carrying on like the methodist church used to you methodists used to have divine healings power of god shouting well i was burying you students from there and he talks about them he said when they first come here the methodist was called holy rollers that's where you got your background and they'd go in there and preach the same old gospel i'd preach and they'd fall out under the island on the floor and lay there all night long under the power of the holy ghost that get pictures of water and throw them in their face and phantom with fans if you just let them along they'd come through just as sure as the world come through in other words to the real baptism of the holy ghost he said oh god wants to restore the faith that was once delivered to the saints and he even pointed back to there in that movie and said god wants that restored amen he said there he said uh you know there that same russian wind when they were in the upper room come from heaven filled all the house where they were sitting they said oh i don't know whether to do this or not if i go outside they'll make fun of me if i say anything what's why he said to go out no sir the holy ghost met them that little bunch of cowards they got life and went down through the through the windows and doors and out to the streets and acted like a bunch of maniacs and staggered and screamed and hollered and everything else like a bunch of drunken people and left until the ritualistic church of that day said these men are full of new wine he said listen you that are so dignified that the sowing circle in your church and got social standing in louisville new albany jeffersonville the blessed virgin mary was in there and god almighty required a blessed virgin mary and wouldn't let her come to heaven until she got that experience how are you going to get there with anything short of it [Applause] hallelujah well it used to be that way when the holy ghost moved upon the methodist it used to be that way even in the pentecostal meetings only by the way it used to be that way on the day of pentecost and he used to be that way in brother brannon's meetings when he met morris reed head who was seeking the baptism of the holy ghost that had missionaries everywhere and realized i need the power of god in my life amen he said i laid hands on him prayed for him in that room and he fell under the power of god and the little coffee table there broke the glass out of it and he received the baptism of the holy ghost and his preaching divine healing today on the field amen do you know brother branham prayed for churches to have that same kind of experience i wish i could read the whole quote time won't let me but here in this part he says may in the morning when they gather for sunday school class may great signs and wonders be accomplished may the holy spirit fall in the building a revival start slain under the power of god laying across the floors everywhere let me tell you again it happened in the prayer lines somebody else's brother brought him a question brother branham as i went through the prayer line a short time ago anointed hands were laid on me and prayer was made for my unsaved husband i was slain by the power of the lord is this a definite sign that he will be saved so even there they testified in brother brethren's prayer lines when anointed hands was laid on them they were slain by the power of god oh yeah so you say ah but brother tim i thought this never happened in brother branham's meetings as far as you know in the prayer line this sister was slain in the spirit she wanted and she wanted to know if that was a sign that her husband would be saved and brother adam said it was not a sign he would be saved but that it was a blessing that she received and by the way he didn't rebuke it and say that only happens when the devil comes but he said that was something extra god gave you it was a sign the holy ghost the holy spirit is hearing you he knows you he's with you and the holy spirit has given you a blessing amen well if the holy spirit is giving it i'll take that blessing anytime sure there's fanaticism sure there's impersonation sure there's actors but there's intellectual actors too the appearance of angels is investigating angels of judgment and jesus is looking for faith amen they came to investigate they stopped first with abraham amen found sarah didn't have faith well we got to fix that first before we can go on down to sodom and send them down there we got to fix the faith of abraham get that and sarah the church the bride jesus is looking for faith the angels of ezekiel 9 are looking for those who signed crime for abominations that done in the city so they're looking for people that are are contrite in spirit they're humble in heart that have a humility about them that wants the word of god to have preeminence is that right amen so again again brother branham would talk about these that they now some of them they can't identify some of them are just hoaxes we know that some of them are just foolishness but he said you know with the rise of all of these mystic lights and things going around he said he like it was in the days of sodom and gomorrah because of his sex affair he sent angels down to investigate it i wonder if angels aren't investigating in america who is now put into law of same-sex marriages i wonder if angels aren't looking there and all looking as as young men and well young women are addicted to porn and every kind of sex sin that is going on i wonder with the adulteries and the fornications and everything else you know if angels are not investigating that amen oh the song says all day all night angels are watching over me they're watching what you do they're looking into man's affairs they're looking into this church what kind of church is it is it a spirit-filled church is it a people that are lukewarm is it a people that has passion a desire a longing that are watching friends appearing what kind of people are in that church they're investigating walking down seeing who it is that they can bring back into faith that they can lift up a little higher that they can give some guidance to their life somebody with me now he said he sent down angels to investigate angels had come to earth in the last few years they've been seen amongst people i mean blood i mean honest blood washed people who knows it they've even stood and had their pictures taken that's right angelic beings has visited taken word back to the father that sin is heaped up to the stars it can hardly shine amen if you want the honor of an angel visiting your home you got to have your home ready that's what i say about a church amen if you want your home church to have the honor of an angel of we've got to have it ready amen prepared and under the blood you can't walk with the world and expect god to walk with you amen we don't want to offend him in our dress we don't want to offend him in our attitudes we don't want to offend him in any way we want him entertained feel welcome somebody with me amen because you cannot mix god and the world together they will not miss god is holy and separated from the world and the only thing he'll ever see you is when he looks through the blood but you see today they take away taken the church the commandment the teaching the bible explained it away therefore you make the commandments of god of none effect there again you take the word of god and i'm just quoting this for a minute it wasn't so from the beginning take the word of god explain it away some sort of creed and then you cry where is the god of the bible and i just say we need him if there was ever a time we needed god it's in this age in this time amen down through the ages they needed him but i'll tell you you are not without life this morning i need him for myself i need him for my life i need him for direction for me i need him i need his blessings i need his healing touch i need his anointing hallelujah amen i stood last sunday here and i preached there on a restored tree with restored fruits and there i witnessed the anointing greater than i want to have in months and months and let me tell you i feel that same anointing this morning it's an angelic anointing it's the anointing of his presence that will break every chain that will bring peters out of prison amen that will cause men and women to walk righteous that will translate the blood of jesus christ but when you explain him away when you say days of miracles have passed no such thing as the holy ghost elected on the day of pentecost we get it different today i don't know what that is but i don't want it amen i want the same holy ghost at saint paul peter james john mary that required mary to have the same experience i want that same kind of holy ghost experience amen all but the days of miracles have passed no such thing as a holy ghost no such thing as divine healer no such thing as the visit of angels no such thing as miracles and when you do that you explain all the supernatural away from the bible and take god right out of the church you see you got to have an attitude of believing so brother tim why have you been preaching the way you have well i'll tell you because we got to have an attitude of believing well we don't want an atmosphere in here of the holy ghost and people getting saved and all that that's what i heard a preacher say that's not me i want that kind of atmosphere i want that atmosphere where he comes down weighs down changes lies cleanses from sin sets people on fire invigorates them what we're what we want is the character of christ what do you think the character of christ is it is the holy ghost it is the power of god and the salvation the the holy ghost there cleanses you from sin gives you a new nature causes you to rise up in christ jesus amen you got to have an attitude to believe it you're going to have to believe in angels before they can help you god can't work against your unbelief that's why he had to change sarah's heart amen sunday a couple of weeks ago i preached on under the oak tree you know it's too hot sodom the atmosphere is heated up the smoke is out of hell the stench of sin is heavy amen but in a moment like that there was another atmosphere being created under an oak tree and i believe god has restored an oak tree in this day oh i don't mean evening like tavern i could i i'm not trying to make it you know that's for him no more i'm saying that oak tree is a pride around the world and wherever you are you can create an atmosphere you don't have to come here to be saved you don't have to be here to have revival you've got to have got to have revival and he's not just here he's everywhere he'll meet you there sometimes the most inopportune times but he'll meet you brother branham said you know our our revivals have failed and our healing campaigns have failed and billy graham crossed across the nation and he said it's a big ecclesiastical machine and god's filled it full of carbon for you she's chugged chub pump pump chug chug pump pump gasoline run out he poured water in it everything's gone flat tires on every side and then he then he said the ecclesiastical machine is stopped oh god don't ever let us stop progressing amen like i've said about this car brother branham left us one that would drive it would drive down the healing to miracles to signs to wonders to the real holy ghost amen it'll take you places come on somebody it'll take you in a rapture [Applause] amen but he's a brother the lid has come off of hell and streams of demons is pouring from everywhere it's conquered the nations it conquered politics till it's rotten to the core it's conquered the churches until they know nothing but denomination you say are you christian i'm methodist you're christian i'm pentecostal let me add i belong to a message church that don't mean no more i said the other day than a pig a hog or a horse or something that has nothing to do with it you're a christian when you are born again and filled with the holy ghost not until that and you're yielded completely to the spirit if you're not yielded to the spirit then you're not born again you don't have the holy spirit you might speak in tongues and jump inside and jump and run paul said i can move mountains with faith i can heal the sick i have knowledge of the bible i can go to seminary and learn all this stuff everything i'm nothing yet hallelujah oh my talk about the lid off the cattle demons going around powers of the devil under the name of christianity teaching for doctrine the commandments of men theological seminary doctrines leaving the bible alone hallelujah who is able to who is strong enough who is wise enough who is powerful enough to tame this legion stripping the clothes off of our women in the name of preachers methodist baptists and even pentecostals and message painting their faces like jezebel and bobbing their hair wearing pants just like men or preachers not enough get up about it to tell them about a devil possessed it was legion that tore his clothes off of him who is this roaring devil i just want to say again it's hot hell has enlarged its mouth sin is encroaching our churches holiness and holiness is done away with without no without which no man shall see the lord and is crept in young women with skirts that are so tight i'm not meddling i'm preaching now i'm talking about devil streaming loose and the hell is hot and little one you said and let me quote your prophet and you wear little skirts that's so tight going down the street so tight till the skin's on the outside and call yourself holiness women is that the way a daughter of god would act you know clothes above the knees topped off with painted nails are you with me now amen you look like a bunch of perverted frenchmen with maybe bean holes on your hands and fingers and nails come on we used to believe in holiness we used to believe in righteousness shouldn't we still amen he said look at the modern wounded one today little skinned down dressed in every form she can't move without sinning walking tripping down the street with all the makeup and cosmetics a max factor can put on her nearly fixing her hair like some little girl wear a skirt just up above her about above her knees if she's got on any at all but you look at her she's pretty satan knows how to do it he's the author of beauty that type of beauty which results in sin beauty that results in sin and i see i see as the lid comes off the kettle i see a new style raisin up out of hell of these leggings the worldly women found they can wear them and show every form of their body they leave nothing to your imagination it's all their skin tight ever crack every crevice hey mountain and those you know who do try to be a little more modest they wear t-shirts just to kind of to cover their bottom but you see that's one thing for the world to do that but now he's coming in with our girls with a skirt that barely covers the knee if at all and they sit and expose their thigh or their crotch and they think they're covered because they got leggings on no they're not covered and for people that are expecting a unappearing how can we when the angels don't visit places where holiness modesty and righteousness does not abound and while i'm at it you know brother brethren said you sisters you know sure if you want to wear a little necklace your husband gave you something special like that you don't want to wear it that's fine that's great but don't look like you like you walk down to a dime store with the magnet on and now you know there's one around this ankle and one around that toe and one around the prophet of god gave you some leeway where you could wear a nice little necklace but you see the devil don't want to stay that way [Applause] any woman that dresses that way ain't looking for his appearance they're looking for men and their approval rather than god's approval [Music] amen like it or lump it that's the way i preach it here amen line up or leave you don't matter to me i never preached for money i never preached for popularity we want to preach we want a place where the spirit of god can abide amen women look holy we're men are righteous why do you think all this tatted up business is going on it's because the mark of the beast is happening they're marking their beast but look at it leggings young girls wearing them barely cover their knees got leggings down to their ankles sit over there in a chair expose all the way up to their crotch and crotch and you know all the you know all their thigh all their legs everything else and they think they're covered you're not you can't move without sinning in verse two i know you want me to get off of that all right so let's just go a little further in verse two the bible said he ran to meet him abraham ran i want you to look at the passion and that's one thing we must never do is lose our passion for the truth for righteousness for holiness for the word of god for the spirit of god you see abraham knew as he passed by he must be persuaded to stop it ain't enough to see him he got to stop him it ain't enough to see him passing by he got to stop here let me detain him let me constrain him let me say i want to entertain you stay a little while don't be so quick to walk on by come on in i want to talk it over with you oh hallelujah is there somebody here today say i want to talk it over with him a man he must be persuaded brother branham talks about young men he said we'll give their lives for their country you know and fight their battles they can be great men of courage and it used to be that way they'd join the army they didn't care if it was america you know if it was vietnam they didn't understand what was going on i'm american if it's american doing it we're gonna go out and we're gonna defeat their enemy they'd go out and they'd take their train and stick their head up like a hero and get it blowed off they didn't care they would give their lives for the country and he goes on he said but a man sell them will you ever find one that'll lay down his life for the cause of christ he won't even crawl out of his shade tree to go to church and he won't even get out from behind the television long enough to attend a wednesday night prayer meeting it's a shame it's a disgrace that's the reason angels don't visit the churches that's the reason angels don't visit homes we got to get down to deep sincerity of the thing the angels of god are here on earth tonight just the same as they have always been the holy ghost has been here ever since the resurrection of jesus they're coming forth of pentecost and he's appeared through the all the ages down down getting a remnant of people together the rest of it is cannon fodder i just tell you that's it now is fodder that mix with smoke out of torment yes sir it'll take a born-again experience washed in the blood of the lamb sanctified filled with the holy ghost or they'll never make that rapture that's according to the word verse 3 he said now look my lord if i've now found favor in thy sight that's what we want we want to find grace let me find favor it would be a favor amen it would be it would be an honor to have you come visit our service for you come drop down for a little while and let us just entertain you for a while oh don't pass from my from that servant i pray you let let a little water and pray you be fetched and wash your feet and rest under the tree let a little water be fetched let's watch those feet that's been walking through that hot sand let me wash the feet of jehovah let me have a servant's heart a servant's attitude let me provide a welcoming atmosphere that welcomes the presence of the almighty like rebecca when she was there you know and she looked up and she saw the camel train coming of eliezer she didn't know that strange man she didn't know she did not know that that camel said so that she saw coming was the one she's gonna ride on to meet her new bridegroom and go to her new home she didn't know that but there there again there was something something there when she saw him there was something that she was hospitable she was welcoming you and she said let me give you some water and i'll water your camels also well you know that was about that was about 10 camels the bible said and 10 camels each one can drink 30 gallons and they'd been a couple of weeks across the desert they were thirsty and so it would take 300 gallons of water 300 gallons of water to water those tin camels and there she would have to walk down a few stairs and bend over to fill her jar lift that heavy jar of there about five gallons and she'd do that 60 times um i don't know how many people would would entertain strangers like that but here she was entertaining an angel unawares because the angel lord he said the angel of god will go before you and eleazar was only just the face are you with me she was ready to do the heavy lifting she had the heart of a servant you see she's typing the bride whatever it takes i don't have to understand it all i just know i just know that there's something about that man something strange there he says and i'm going to be careful to entertain this angel entertain this stranger because in doing so we'll entertain the angels unaware brother branham said that eleazar had prayed and i think the bible tells you to say that eliezer prayed and said lord direct your servant you know there may it be the one that offers to water and give me water and my camel's water may it be the one he prayed the prayer he knew what it would take in order to get back somebody helped me preach in order to get back home the camels had to be watered amen and he said he prayed and he said brother madam said i believe the angel of the lord he he beat him to rebecca a half an hour and he moved on her heart and spoke to her and said get to the water amen hallelujah and rebecca came to the water of life at the evening time oh hallelujah for at the evening time it shall be light hallelujah oh now light was coming up on her purpose and her calling hallelujah amen it's a time that the angel lord in the supernatural is revealing himself to rebecca's today amen to the bride of isaac somehow another she was moved to go to the waters oh hallelujah he said the angel of the lord in the message goes and wounds rebecca to come to the waters of life you wonder what attracted you to this message it was the angel of god seeking you out come on now seeking you out he found you there may you was in a strange land maybe you were there in a baptist methodist presbyterian catholic home but he found you and one thing i like about him he don't leave you where he found you oh hallelujah he was about to elevate her a man from a lonely position to a mother in israel hallelujah to be the wife to isaac amen eliezer started praying let that angel go before me and i'll tell you here come rebecca right there to meet him you see no more than your heart goes to hunger than thirsting for god some kind of holy ghost revival will break out i mean some people want to just chalk it up brother tim is you trying to stir everybody up all the time you're just stirring them up you know you're just whipping up a crowd no no no you don't get the picture it's the angel of god moving upon the people calling for revival because it's revival hour it's revival time it's holy ghost time it's going home time it's rapture time it's time that we are loaded on those camels and going home hallelujah he said i think of the beautiful rebecca that evening watering the camel's watering the very thing that was going to take her to her bridegroom and that's what it is water and the camel represents power and the church of the living god today is rejoicing and watering the power of the holy ghost in a packer someday and take her yonder to meet her isaac in the air hallelujah amen and he said what is watering the very power that we are watering now with praises see that's why i try to get you to do it all the way from the front view to the mezzanine because the very power will water now with praises with thanksgiving and glory and power and might is this very holy spirit that attack us to jesus someday hallelujah again he said unlike rebecca watered the camel the very camel she watered she wrote unto me to bridegroom that very god we preach about the very word which is god the very god that's in the word will rise us up someday by the baptism of the holy ghost and our critics will be killed by the same power that raises you to glory oh my rise up and ride on it you people that are sick amen you may not be physically sick but are you sick of sin are you sick of the evil age are you sick of all the hell around us are you sick of all of it then rise up and ride on it and give praise to the holy spirit like the woman who washed jesus feet he saw her chance when she saw he had a need we're all times worried about our need word about our feelings well he preached he hurt my feelings i'm not worried about your feelings any man baptist churches where they worry about feelings methodist church they're worried about feelings can't say nothing about gays because it'll hurt somebody's feelings can't say nothing about the evil and it'll hurt somebody's feelings i'm not worried about your feelings i'm worried about his feelings is somebody with me amen but we get worried about our need what about his need god is an object of worship and so he has a need to be worshiped he created angels to worship him he created you to worship him abraham bowed his head to the ground and said let me wash your feet let me get some water let me wash the dirt off of you you've been walking through the hot sands oh my now here's sarah over here she's in a bad mood she's still in a bad mood now remember it wasn't she wasn't bright it wasn't she wasn't in the promise she just wasn't with it yet some of you get in a bad mood but it isn't because you're not bright some of you get your feelings but it isn't you're not bright amen you're sarah amen but we're trying to get you on board to believing to acting upon what you believe amen and you know again sarah's in a bad mood and and and here comes abraham shaking the curtains saying listen we got we got strangers here i ain't in no mood for strangers it's hot out there and i ain't sticking my head out that tent door listen sarah you are going to make unleavened bread abraham it's too hot to cook come on come on now it's too evil of these to have a fire it's impossible to have a pillar of fire in our church are you with me hey man it's true let me let me tell you friends it's got to have fire even for the passover to cook the lamb to cook the unleavened bread and man it can't be a half cooked meal it's got to be fully done oh it's too hot too hot to make unleavened bread well but they can't sarah you know better than that you can't offer any leaven in bread offered to angels it must be unleavened bread of sincerity and truth and in order to bind to serpent death and have our chains and have our son amen we're going to have to bind the serpent death and the only way to do that is to come with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth let me just tell you like many of you today my whole life since a young boy has been a feast to the lord abraham was making a feast that's what your life is to be your life is to be a feast to god and and you know a call to the feast to feast is a fast with the lord you see it's unleavened bread and since i've been feasting i've been fasting putting away ungodliness as a boy i even put away my education i did you know why i thought about it you know when when i quit school at in the 10th grade and and there you know even in my last year i got a double study hall i took spoken word books and i read spoken word books to the study hall underlined them so i could preach as a 15 and 16 year old boy preacher and have something to preach on because i wanted the people fed the word of god amen so you see you know i i could devote myself to the ministry and entertain elohim amen you know sometimes you think it's impossible when we ask you take it fast from facebook take them fast from twitter and instagram and take a fast from the news come on the holy ghost does not feed on news that's not what he relishes he wants your best take a cab young and tender amen don't get the crippled one that now now listen boys you know these strangers have come up you know just to hide the identity i'm going to tell you about a home that i knew about the mother had made a a dish of goulash that's all i know to call it goulash something and and they they had made that and and and there they you know the family they ate it and then the cat got in it ate some too then all of a sudden company comes so the kids mom and dad's out of the home mom they don't know about it so the kids quickly warm up the goulash that the cat's been eaten in sometimes that's the way we do you know we we just kind of get a little warm up about something not giving our best we come to a service sometimes on wednesday night we well actually you can have some real goods wins tonight a lot of times you know it's sunday you want to drag you know i worked all week brother tim give your best amen you see he doesn't feed on creeds and dogmas amen the serpent has got to be bound so you know the serpent is hot on people's trails and to find him you've got to be more sincere and here abraham ran it shows his eagerness to entertain and he's restrained them luke 24 13 tells about two that after jesus had risen went to a village called emmaus verse 28 and they drew near the village where they whether they went and he made as though he would have went further but they constrained him and said abide with us you see jesus the resurrected one had been walking with him all day and and saying should not christ have suffered these things and going over the scriptures and showing how the christ would be and it comes down to evening time and when it comes down the evening time you know they they're going to turn in and then and he says they say come in abide with us and the bible says he made his though he would have went further that's the way he will do a lot of times in his service he'll make like he's just going to bless somebody else but if you will constrain him you can get him to come near your pew you can get him to speak to your heart amen but it's going to take somebody to beg him that constrains him now you must come in no don't pass me by past me not o gentle savior hear my humble cry well on others you're calling don't pass me by. amen he wants to see your emotions he wants to know how much you believe in him how bad you want it amen amen oh brother we got to be that kind of begging people brother brandon said amen people that signed cried for the abomination the old mourner's back in the church amen where instead of being taken out that there's weeping and crying at the altar and i believe i believe in every bit of this shouting and jumping and running but i think it ought to be for ran by real mourning and dying out and crying and weeping your way to calvary and sorry for your sins for you jump up and run and shout amen you know it's not the emotion we're interested in it's him we're interested in abide with me oh you said but i couldn't ask him to come in i've been kind of a gambler i don't care what you've been he'll come your way so i've been sweethearted don't matter what you've been god's trying to work his way into your heart amen somebody's got to be crying even this cry even so kind lord jesus amen that's got to be our hearts cry amen i drove through mending this word this day and seeing the signs elect this and that one to the other and knowing that there could catastrophes being come here and then the city government turned around and bring every kind of evil into the city and i'm thinking oh god you know what it's going to be and how it's going to be how will it happen and i just begin to say lord whatever that it takes for our will to break whatever it takes for us to be crying even so come lord jesus no matter what the elect in the senate where they turn it back to republicans or turn it back the presidency back to a republican everyday say well we'll have a few more good years let me tell you friends we got to get to the point that we say i'm sick of this world i'm sick of sin i'm sick of the evil even so i've learned jesus that heaven becomes more appealing than staying here do you remember this woman matthew 26 16. matthew 26 16 13. verily i say unto you where so ever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world let me stop right there this gospel has not been preached since the first stage of the day of pentecost there was a falling away we come and we have it restored the gospel is now being preached wherever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world there shall also do this all there shall also this that this woman had done be told as a memorial of her so when the gospel is preached in the last day this woman who washed jesus feet in simon's house and entertained christ that that's going to be one of the themes of the last day message oh yes and he did and when the seventh angel began to restore the message back to the gospel again this story reminded us again that we are in the appearing of christ and while he is here he must be invited and welcomed and given service just as it is this day so it was or that day so is it in this day they wanted brother branham to draw a crowd they wanted for entertainment but they would leave jesus in the corner neglected brother branham preached the sermon all over and over again he started out with a message called pride and that was the first time he preaches on jesus with dirty feet then he preaches that title that jesus with dirty feet the unwelcome christ three times he would even preach that over in europe because it's not just america that he's unwelcomed in it's the whole world he's unwelcomed in he would preach again twice at least the worst center in the city washing jesus feet one of the meanest man in town he'd entitle it twice the meanest man i know the meanest man in santa maria and then the last time he would preach it would be jesus keeps all of his appointments he will show up even when he knows he will not be he will he is rejected even now today among many churches that call himself message the worst center in the city was not the prostitute and the meanest person was not the prostitute the worst sinner in the city and the meanest man i know are those who invite jesus and leave him there with dirty feet and i want you to say to you this is more than a story because jesus said this story or this this will be told as a memorial what this woman has done it'll be an end time sign of what will happen in the last days that christ will not be welcomed down or you say well brother tim um all that was just pre-seals and we have advanced higher than that no it wasn't he was still declaring that in the sermon in 1964 saying jesus will keep all his appointments he's got an appointment for this age he's showing up in this church he's showing up around the world there's investigating angels of judgment and they're looking for entertainment somebody to welcome them jesus had been invited but it wasn't for the right reason simon the pharisee just wanted him to show off to use him to draw a crowd and to make fun of him to find out his faults and his flaws and be able to pick at something you see the brother brandon said you see anybody like that hates you your calls for christ and bring you in it's either to get you a lot of money off of you or do something or use in some way they they won't believe the message they got you there for something else i think about brother branham being invited to places and showing up and and it flashes where william brown and will be here praying for the sick and they'll show up and they wouldn't let him out on the stage and say uh william branham i had some sickness in his home and had to go back home he's not here but we got programming that's what he saw that when and there in the third pull of his ministry and he has the tent vision and he sees that the thing you know the crowd is there and they're gathered and said somebody just missed the crowd and and he complained why did you why was the crowd just missed in the vision he said oh we've done take off we've already taken up the offering you see it became about money it became about building ministries and i just want to say message brothers and message pastors it's not about building your ministry it's not about money it's not about who has to find his church and oh how many listens to me on the internet you see it's not about that it's about christ and welcoming him and recognizing his messiahship and when jesus arrived they didn't wash his feet now that was a custom in that day when and it must have been a testament and um abraham's day and apparently jesus wants us to have that custom in our day you see the custom was when you arrived to wash your feet you're dirty from walking the paths and the roads where animals walked and dropped their dung along the road the long robot of the galileans would would have picked up the stink and the smell you'd be embarrassed to walk on this expensive persian rugs and sweaty from the journey with dirty feet and grime between your toes but that's what god did in abraham's day when he changed his mask and his fullness came in jesus god took on the stink of humanity to come and dwell with mortals now the lowest poorest paid man got the job to wash the feet and when i think about this when jesus showed us of his greatness he didn't do it with a struck out chest with degrees but he put aside his garments took a towel and girded himself and washed his disciples feet he took the lowest place to wash the dung and the dirt off of their feet so you see they would they would draw up a big basin of water you know and then you know they would take and maybe kneel down and watch the feet wash all the dirt and the dung and the dust and the stuff off your body take a towel wash them and take your sandals and set them up on a little mantel there at the entrance of the door and and then get a another another pair of fine satin silk slippers that are soft and compliments of the host put them on makes that maybe it makes them feel more comfortable then your feed is washed and they pass you to another place and another man will meet you at the door he's got a little picture in his hand of some real very fine oil of spikenard or something real costly and there he would take and take him and wipe that upon on your face and wipe it with the towel all the grime and stuff off and a little on your hands there around your neck and create a smell that where you can feel refreshed and you know when you're other round you're not worried about who stink your feet is washed or you're quashed you're washed your hands are clean your face is clean and you're anointed but the pharisee he was careful to to wash dr jones's feet he was careful with the celebrity he was careful with all these other but he he let jesus sit there with dirty feet and he was never kiss welcome because that's what the host would do after your feet had been washed and your you were anointed and you're dressed with a new pair of slippers and you walk in and then you're welcomed by the host and he brings you embrace you and he kisses you on this side and kiss and gives you a kiss welcome and there jesus was in the home of simon and he was miserable sitting there no doubt the pharisees were talking about and testifying about the different things that had happened the politics and what was happening whispering about you know yeah well you know simon's got this jesus here you know he's just not like type you know and but jesus sat there with dirty feet unanointed face no kiss welcome and jesus wants to be kissed the psalmist said kiss the son lest he be angry i wonder sometimes of our our failure to kiss him welcome doesn't make him angry when he gathers among church members you know they they will let him say i'm anointed with dirty feed and be embarrassed while they're having their big time with their programs and everything else how was it a flunky like that could have passed up an opportunity how could it been that that even the man the herald that had taken the message to him your master one or my master simon wants to invite you to a feast how was it that he passed up an opportunity to say lord when i've got your attention i'm a sinner forgive me of my sins i wonder if how it can be that we can have a service i'm bringing it down to home and he will pass by and you won't say god i need a touch lord don't just believe me where you found me but lord i need my sin my unbelief maybe you hadn't been drinking and smoking and lusting or whatever but every one of us wrestled with doubts and fears not belief and we can let god i need it all washed away i need a real cleansing lord i need a purging of the holy ghost but there was a woman there was a woman passing by there that wasn't invited and she looks over there and she sees him that man that healed the sick that man that pardoned others of their sins that if he could look at jesus said he's that one oh my he's that one that forgave that other woman of seven devils oh if he could forgive her he could forgive me oh if we ever get past in our experience the amazing grace and its sweet sound that saved the wrecks like me that we can lose our experience of saying i was once lost but now i'm found i'm so glad lord i'm founded i'm so glad you found me i was a wretch i was a nobody i was lost when you get in your presence i don't know how she did it but first she went up and she got that money that she put away from her payment for her prostitution but it was all she had god don't really care what you got he just wants you to come you see you'll be a worse sinner being a pharisee then you will be a prostitute when you let jesus sit with dirty feet so there it was you know there again you know she see whether she got no she walked in and she said i want the best remember abraham get a cap young and tender we're going to give the best listen god would take any part yeah he would even take pharisees invitation jesus keeps all of his appointments if you give him 20 he'll take that 20 if you give him 30 he'll take it he'll take that 30. if you only give him sunday morning twice a month he'll take that if you just you know if you if you just give him church attendance and yet some people think church attendance is here well i'm there every time but look the devil is too. look at your life look at what you're living you ain't give him your heart you might give him church attendance you got that part well i tithe to be a lot of tithers in hell i want to give my best so she goes and gets the alabaster box full of ointment she prays all she has but it's not good enough even for this angel i'm entertaining the messiah jehovah god somehow she gets in and she gets in and she begins to put that ointment on her feet on his feet begins to kiss his feet and she's just kissing away on it and her tears her tears are coming down out of her face and it's aaron is getting water and is washing away and she don't have a towel so she just takes her long hair and she starts trying to wipe it off with her tears off his feet and she she's getting hysterical and brother brandon said when you get in his presence it makes you hysterical he said i've got hysterically any man that gets in his presence that believes him and has faith in him it'll make you hysterically on the day of pentecost when they come in the form of the holy ghost they got hysterically and when you really believe and you know and recognize it's your opportunity and you're in his presence and you're sure of it you get hysterical you get to where you don't care what everybody else thinks you get don't care whether everybody's calling you a holy roller somebody's watching on the internet the foolishness of them people dancing and shouting and screaming and getting hysterical and speaking another tone you don't worry about it it's your jesus and he's got dirty feet i want you to think of it for a moment because you see jesus is not going to come from his throne of glory and let you wash his feet but he's coming and he's appearing in dirt and he'll bring a prostitute to this altar to get in that dirt and you know what he expects when he comes in that dirt for you to welcome that not reject it come on now oh well they got hysterical and they shouted and they danced everybody was a sinner coming to christ and jesus had dirty feed and i'm going to watch the sin and the world and the unbelief off of that life [Music] you see i spoke about dress a while ago because your works express your faith that's what brother branham said and in this quote he said now let your hair grow out expresses what you believe or not that's god's word there's no scripture in the bible but that's the truth why do you do it you've noticed too much hollywood and pentecost that's what's the matter and we find out that's the truth it's too much hollywood you watch these things and pattern yourself a lady said this to me with a little tight dress on i said won't you take that to off being a sister and she said why brother branham they don't make any other clothes and that's when he said but they make sewing machines you don't have an excuse i hope you're listening to me i hope you're i hope you're understanding something here god wants to come and dwell among his people the last quote that i read of the the 1965 and the message communion when brother branham talks about anonymized sapphira and that day returning he said god is going to dwell among his people so there's somebody some oak tree somewhere some believe in church some believe in people some believe in homes that's going to invite jesus in and wash his feet hallelujah they're not ashamed of him hey man they they they are they love him with all her heart they love his appearing oh brother tim i'm no prostitute that's what brother branham said no i'm no prostitute i don't all together mean sexually prostitution on a higher level you can prostitute your time how much time do you give him prostitute your selfish motive going around well i belong to this church i'm better no you're not you can prostitute yourself other than sexually the holy spirit will speak to your heart and you say i want nothing to do with that you blind pharisee prostitute what's the matter with you committing adultery with the world that's what you're doing oh you say i belong to church and so cold and different oh you say petty prayers he said i hate that pharisaic thing oh you pray and make every calm and just come and just perfect and every period just so perfect you pray so beautiful you can't talk to god like that amen you're listening to what you're saying and punctuating your prayer oh god help you to turn loose once and pray but what attitude do you take toward the lord when he wants to come and bless you i don't believe that stuff no that's fanaticism you don't find something something to criticize he wants to see he's waiting but he'll take a place in the corner one thing i don't want for evening light tabernacle is jesus in a corner i want him to have the preeminence i want him welcome i want him anointed i want him anointed even with my tears i want him anointed with my prayers hey man i want to i want to invite him with everything i have listen let me just say this to you and i'm closing trying to but as i as i'm closing for the next 30 minutes i just got this to say to you you know brother branham also preached this in two other sermons at least he preached it in the laodicean church age when he preached the church ages and end time evangelism when he preached that sermon why because end-time evangelism is going to include washing jesus feet but why the laodicean age now listen who was the messenger to laodicea was it not the seventh angel do we know his name don't we know that is william branham the seventh church age messenger isn't that the truth so he comes in and he is now the vehicle the voice to speak the message of his age and he takes you right into revelation chapter 3 of christ on the outside of the door and he says the most pathetic sight i ever saw in my life for christ to get down to the last age and not in the church rejected standing on the door and knocking i want you to hear me message churches across the land and even in my tabernacle today the last place he will be rejected will be in message churches that's where the last places he will sit with dirty feet i don't want that holy roller stuff days of miracles have passed no such thing as divine healing anymore oh you're majoring on a minor oh oh and churches become like tombstones burn over had a fire of yesterday but they're dead lukewarm cold formal and don't know it right think about it oh well but it'll it'll hurt you know very pharisees looking over at him and saying oh i'll tell you that woman getting hysterical if he knew what kind of woman that was you don't you know that's going to ruin his reputation listen jesus reputation is made when he's among sinners he isn't hurt by sinners it's made in the presence of sinners and washing his feet she takes that alabaster box and she snaps the tops of it and breaks it with her glory and her tears of repentance she pours it all on her feet god have mercy upon us in this last generation it will be preached as a memorial just like as it was in the days of sodom remember lot's wife so shall it be in this laodicean church age remember the pharisee remember the harlot remember defeat jesus with dirty feet which one are you going to be which one are you going to be will you welcome him will your heart burn when you see tears of repentance when you see him come down and bless somebody when they bring joy to your heart will you get a little enough hysterical that tears that come out of your face will you sign cry for the abomination how long has it been since you talked to the lord how long has it been since you just really had that time of breaking up where that your sins were so washed away where he can say to the pharisee simon when i came in you provided no water to wash my feet you gave no oil to mask the stink of my body you you there didn't give me a place of welcome but this woman that's what i don't want him look to me this man this woman this church this bride somebody helped me preach i mean these people i mean they have not ceased since i came in have not ceased they sought me out they knelt at my feet they surrendered their law they washed the dirt off of me they anointed me with oil and i say to this woman your sins which are many are all forgiven hallelujah that's what i want you to say of me your sins are all forgiven washed clean purged without spot without a wrinkle without a blame as washed in the blood of the lamb hallelujah let the musicians come amen mayo to see the last place he's rejected all that was the pentecostals yeah they did methodist did baptist did but don't you dare the cycle of revival and death has to break we cannot go on perpetuating another age there's not another messenger there's not another age i just wonder what we think on this would you just bow your heads maybe you are guilty of neglecting jesus you know your prayer life isn't right your home life isn't right you know it's been a long time since you knelt are they at his feet michael where are you get that song how long has it been i want you to sing it i want you to think of this just for a moment maybe you've been a little cold in your spirit maybe but [Music] just been a little lukewarm there's just no real crying out in the spirit no no tears of repentance [Music] no surrenderance to god it's just been a long time since you were tender in your heart and sweet and your spirit oh you you can uh identify with sarah getting in a bad mood all out of sorts [Music] but what about you and your walk with god [Music] what about you young girls young boys you're tempted to the world and sin you just want that to all go you just want to make a real renewing of the of your trust in the lord what about you church member [Music] you've

song on the podcast just a few miles down the road and you just feel the power of god behind it and the sisters ain't here to sing it this morning but so the room grew still as she made her way to jesus she stumbled through the tears that made her blind she felt such pain some spoken anger she heard folks whisper there's no place here for her kind still on she came to the shame that flushed her face until at last she knelt before his feet and though she spoke no words everything she said was heard as she poured out her love for the master from her box of alabaster i've come to pour my praise on him like oil from mary's alabaster box so don't be angry if i wash his feet with my tears and i dry them with my hair because you weren't that you wasn't there the night he found me you did not feel what i felt when he wrapped his love all around me and you don't know the costs of the oil in my alabaster box therefore i cannot forget the way life used to be i was a prisoner in the see it's a sin that had me bound and i spent my days pouring out my life without measure into a little treasure box i thought i'd found until the day when jesus came to me and he healed my soul with the wonder of his touch so now i'm giving back to him all the praise he's worthy of i've been forgiven and that's why i love him so much hallelujah hallelujah you've been forgiven much therefore you can love much oh there's nothing wrong with pouring out your praise and giving him the glory and the honor and the position and the place he deserves hallelujah no one else may know the cost but you know they wasn't there the day he found you and he wrapped his arms around you and he pulled himself to you oh amazing grace where would i be if it wasn't for his touch for his mercy and his grace hallelujah hallelujah if not for grace we just sing that song jesus draw me close jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] fade away oh [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] oh let the world around me live over i'll
