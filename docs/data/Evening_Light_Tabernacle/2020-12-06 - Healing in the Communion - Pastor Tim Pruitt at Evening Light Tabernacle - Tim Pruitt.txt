father in the name of jesus that we we come now before your throne of grace some weeks ago i shared with the congregation that i had something very special for this service tonight i asked lord that you would bless us together and anoint the service lord as we gather in your name lord we believe your word and we accept your promises they are yeah amen they are yes yes always yes and we say yes to them because they're our promises we're asking god tonight as we come to you the deliverer the delivering god the healer god the saving god that you'll come and meet the needs of your children tonight as we pass by this table and we each one take our portion of the bread and the wine i pray lord that each one will receive that healing they are desiring in their hearts and lives some of it may be emotionally spiritually physically whatever the situation is you're the need supplier and we believe and we confess we ask in the name of jesus as we read the word together tonight may our hearts be just enjoined with the word until us in the word become the same until we believe the word just as is written and we speak it as it is to be spoken in jesus name amen god bless you thank you we're going to turn to psalms 105 and verse 37 i have one verse of scripture for um from this psalms here there's a lot more that we could read of course and then we will turn to the familiar scripture in first corinthians 11 verse 23 but for now psalms 105 verse 37. i want to just say while you're turning there thank you very much for the wonderful thanksgiving christmas dinner that we had today we so appreciated all of your participation in it we got the best cooks in the whole wide world ain't nothing like southern cooking i guess you heard me say that right there ain't nothing like it amen so we certainly appreciate you and your contribution and this time that we've had to share together i didn't get to speak to every person but i'll tell you i love every one of you god bless you psalms 105 verse 37 he brought them forth also with silver and gold and there was not one feeble person among their tribes read it with me will you he brought them forth also with silver and gold and there was not one feeble person among their tribes first corinthians 11 23 for i have received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said tahit this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup which when he accepts say in this cup is the new testament in my blood this do you as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body and for this cause many are sweet and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened to the lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat terry one for the other amen god bless you you can have your seats now as we come to this particular service tonight it's something that i've had on my heart for a long time to share with you and to speak about we're going to be speaking on healing in the communion and i want to first of all read about four different quotes from brother branham before we go into the the scripture and the teaching of the word so that you will know that what i am ministering on tonight is something that is supported by the messenger and um brother branham would say this in jubilee year he said now we're going to have communion services in a few minutes how many believes in communion thank you that's what jesus christ asked us to do to take the broken parts of his body and do it until he returned again and if you believe this to be the truth and you'd like to have this little time of fellowship with us around the word of god here we'd be happy for you to stay with us and have this time if not we're going to dismiss just in a few moments we'd like you to stay with the with the rest in the house so that you'll be able to see the way we take the communion this is not only this is this is far also for divine healing did you know that when israel ate the type the lamb they passover they journeyed 40 years in the wilderness and come out without one feeble person in their midst think of that not one feeble person 40 years the communion a sign of believers and then he tells us in the message comforter he it's a in his prayer he says father we realize that when this was first ordered back yonder in the wilderness and back in egypt the paschal lamb was slain they journeyed 40 years and there wasn't a feeble one among the 2 million that came out you kept them in health while they taken the passover oh god heal every sick person that comes forward granted lord save every sinner fill every believer with the holy ghost and may the comforter abide until he's made flesh among us in the person of jesus christ again for we ask it in his name also in um another message the uh it's called the ordination he said you know that communion has divine healing in it when the israelites and type took the communion in march 40 years and when they came out of the wilderness there wasn't one feeble one among them two and a half million people there is power of healing in the communion and then in the message contest which will be in my final quote that i'll read tonight and we realized that in the communion there is strength israel took the communion first down in egypt and walked 40 years without their shoes wearing out or their clothes getting thread pair and out of two million people there wasn't a feeble one among them when they come out of the wilderness lord let us remember that tonight as we approach this great hour in jesus name we pray so all of these different quotations show us that that brother branham established that he believed there was there was um divine healing in communion i think of brother ron spencer when i shared with him my my text for tonight he's he shared back with me that his mother went through the communion with lying one time and she had um she had lumps in her breast and there went to the communion line claimed her healing and and um you know god completely totally did away with all the lumps in her breast because god's a healer amen and so tonight we're going to be speaking about healing divine healing in the lord's supper now god has an attitude towards sickness and he showed that attitude in jesus christ and and he showed that everywhere that jesus went he healed the sick he cast out devils he brought deliverance to god's people you see god places no value on sickness and he doesn't want you to suffer sickness for his glory sickness does not glorify god any more than sin glorifies god now its deliverance from sickness is what glorifies god when you are when you are delivered that brings glory to god but your sickness don't give god glory i hope you understand the difference now paul told the church at corinth that many were sick and weak and sickly among them because they were not discerning the lord's body and then he tells us the reason for this is and this is why again there's still so much sickness in the church today is because the church is not discerning the lord's body and just simple that you know it's not that god is purifying or glorifying his church through affliction it's not that god is testing his children's faith that's not the reason for it the reason we're having sickness in the church is because we're not discerning the lord's body this is what the bible teaches that we're failing to discern and realize what christ did for us at calvary now jesus told us to cast out demons of afflictions he did not tell us to live with them amen and since sickness is a demon it doesn't glorify god you ever hear of a demon glorifying god no so it doesn't glorify god for us to live with demons jesus commissioned us to cast them out that is the work the principal work of the church is to cast satan out amen now there there are two basic parts to the communion we have right here before us and there are two parts to it there is the bread there is the wine and so that and and the and of course for the passover there were two parts of the passover there was the blood of the lamb and the body of the lamb all right so sickness is due though when we when we fail to be taught about the body of christ that is represented by the bread like we have been taught about the blood of christ that is represented by the wine now we all know about the blood we know it cleanses us from sin is that right we understand the necessity of the wine representing the blood but do we understand what the bread is about do we understand why the bread i mean we have the part of the blood which is the life of the grapes that is squeezed out to make the wine and representing the life that was squeezed out of christ which is the holy spirit amen that that cleanses us from all sin are you with me but but again are we understanding what the bread is about are we really comprehending and accepting our deliverance as as was given by the sacrifice of jesus christ now why is it that there's so many um christians in the church that that is sick or infirm and suffering from the very diseases and the sicknesses that jesus christ our substitute has already paid for us amen he paid it in full did he not amen so again he he suffered that so we could be healed now i understand it's our mortality that why we are sick and as long as we're mortal there's going to be sickness but at the same time they we're dealing with something here to say there is also a remedy for that sickness and that's divine healing is that right now paul would say it was the lack of understanding of the lord's body as represented by the blood and so we're i'm disposing the question do we really comprehend are we coming with revelation of what the bread means you see the there the church at corinth it was a very small church probably maybe 15 20 people i'm not sure what the number of them we hear that ephesus ephesians church was 12. but how many corinthians was i'm not sure but it wasn't a large church perhaps it it was not not nearly the size of our congregation here today but there were many that was weak and sickly members many of them were sick and others were dying prematurely now you know the church in the wilderness in contrast was a much larger church it was a congregation of about 3 million now if you didn't like big churches you wouldn't want to be a part of moses church hello amen so he had about 3 million yet in this church there was not one feeble person among their tribes how many believes that amen i believe it the bible has said not one feeble member among their tribe three million and yet here are two churches one in the old testament the other in the new testament wonder under law the other under grace one under the covenant of the blood of bulls and goats and another under the covenant sealed by a much greater blood the blood of christ amen this blood is a tremendous blood it's a tremendous worth the blood of millions of sheep and goat could never take away sin can only cover sin it could not take away sin somebody with me but the blood of jesus christ can take away the sin of the whole world so in comparison there there is the worth of the blood of god the blood of jesus christ was what's a way in estimate worth because it covers the sins of the whole world of every individual now so again yet there was not one sick or feeble person among these three million people who lived under the old covenant they were and that old covenant was established with the blood of bulls and goats and yet on the other hand there was many that was see sick and weakly among the that small church of corinthians and they lived under a new covenant and it was established by the blood of jesus christ it was a greater covenant it was a greater blood it was a greater power but yet these christians were not enjoying the benefits of what the covenant provided now surely there was something that was lacking at the corinthian church i mean something it may have no doubt is even lacking today when when we see the sick is not healed i'm going to say to you it is very very wrong for the sick not to be healed very wrong when we bring up the sick before us i'm quoting brother branham i told you i wouldn't read another but here's one when we bring up the sycamore before us and we and they fail to be healed he says we need to call a solemn fast call an assembly something's wrong somewhere god made a promise god's got to stick to that promise and he will do it so this is this is what he he lays it out when we have the sick and they're not healed i mean we need to qualify solemn fast because we're not coming right at the promise amen now for 400 years the children of israel had lived down in egypt egypt had made slaves out of god's people they had many many difficult years of of slavery and these years passed while they served as slaves down in a healing nation and spent long hours crying in prayer for deliverance but one day it came time the iniquity of the amorites became full amen it was time now for god to cleanse that land and bring another people in and god heard their groanings and god remembered the covenant that he made with abraham with isaac and with jacob and god looked upon the children of israel and god had respect toward them you remember that in the bible god chose a man by the name of moses to whom he said i have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in egypt and i've heard their cry but the reason of the task masters and i know they're sorrows and i am come down to deliver them and i'll tell you when god comes down something's going to happen that's why when we've been preaching about revelation 10 one you know it's god coming down for a specific purpose here in this end time amen so god said so moses said come now therefore and i'll send you to pharaoh that you may bring my people out of it out of egypt well i want you to know tonight god still hears the prayers of his people amen oh yes in fact to the the the matter if you remember this morning and as we were reading of revelation 5 the saints those 4 and 20 elders was holding prayers golden vows full of odors which were prayers of the saints but if we'd have studied a little further and look in revelation 8 we would have seen the seventh seal and the prayers are poured out and they're mixed with incense and they come in the presence of god god had a you see there were prayers that were prayed and none of them goes unanswered yet some could not be answered in their time many had prayed even the last prayer that john the revelator prayed he prayed even so come lord jesus well he couldn't come in that age and time he had you in mind so there was there was many generations of his offspring that he would see and so he held them up they were stored and shown is stored up in a vial or a bowl and they're held there until that he breaks the silence under the seventh seal and what he does he pours out the prayers of the saints for his coming and it is mixed with the the the incense and then it comes up into the presence of god and god then starts with with with the bible says with thunderings and lightning and earthquakes upon the earth and an upheaval begins as the seventh seal opens breaking the silence of his coming and the coming of the lord begins to be in motion and friend you are living in that time where the coming of the lord is in progress but it's only now in this day that he can answer those prayers so now they're mixed with the prayers the prayers are mixed with the incense and rise up into his presence received by god and in response to it he sends elijah the prophet as promised in malachi 4 to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers to prepare a people for the coming of the lord i say glory to god god has not forgotten his people you're in a day you are living in a day of god's remembrance he's remembering every promise that he ever made and he's going to bring the past that which he has prophesied and said through the word down to the ages now but god still hears the prayers of those in bondage he speaks his same words to everyone who needs to deliver it says i am i am come down i am here to deliver did we see that in the prophetical ministry of brother branham we saw god present here to deliver amen then our message must not be any different from that god is here for the purpose of deliverance now moses would obey god's call to deliver god's people he showed many signs and wonders down in egypt and the final step came and god said to him i want you to speak to the children of israel and what i want you to do is tell them to take every one of them every man a lamb and kill it i want you to take the blood and i want you to strike it on the two sides of the of the post and the upper door posts of the house and then i want you to eat the flesh of the lamb it is the lord's passover so this would be you know some one of the final things that god would do before they left egypt he would give them the token of his blood and that blood would be the protection against the death angel that was in the land are you with me now again we are here now in another end time and god has provided a token of his blood somebody with me amen this token of his blood is to protect us from the death angel amen i'm not talking about covet 19 i'm talking about sin and the unbelief of sin are you with me no but it is a time where the token must be displayed it couldn't be just kept in a pot in the house it had to be displayed on the doorpost everyone entered that house would have to come under the token of that blood the sign of that blood that sign would say there is a lamb that died in this house a lamb has already provided the atonement and death is already here now brother branham said this about the token again i forgot to have another one but here's another one from the token where he says when peter and john passed through the gate called beautiful there were laid a man that had been crippled lame from his mother's womb and said silver and gold have none but such as i have i give you in the name of jesus christ and nazis rise up and walk and they talk to them and they knew that they were ignorant and unlearned men and they but they had taken them notice to them they had been with jesus you see the token was there displaying such as i have now we get an understanding of the displaying of the holy ghost the token must be on display there must be have somebody have something to give to those that are suffering and in need to bring deliverance are you with me now so that token was their display in such as i have see a poor fallen brother laying there crippled and disfigured and everything and the same light that was in christ was in them such as i have in the my name you shall cast out devil not i will you will if you say this mountain not if i say but if you say to this mountain amen oh brother the hour of that token to be displayed is at hand we can see it we know we're at the end we've brought up all kinds of messages to show the the signs and wonders and now we're here and we come we come back for what the church has got to do the token has to be displayed so there has to come a time when the blood of christ is on display come on where the life of jesus christ is on display in a people and it will be manifested by the signs and wonders that follows them that believe now so we are in a time of displaying the token understand it must be displayed now they had applied the blood but they also ate the flesh there were two things they were commanded to do apply the blood the lamb and eat the flesh of the lamb now most don't realize the this eating of the lamb it's just as important as the partaking of the blood so the destroyer would pass through egypt and slay the firstborn in every family which was a type of spiritual death which comes to every person outside of god's covenant and and again you know the destroyer would pass through but they were protected under the blood but i want you to know there was not just one step there were two steps just like with this communion there's not just one element there's two elements there is blood and there's bread now get these down get these things in mind we're pointing out about the communion tonight these two steps that israel had to do first there was to be a lamb slain its blood was to be applied to the doorposts of every house it was identified them as being under god's covenant of protection god said the blood shall be for you for a token where you are and when i see the blood i will pass over you how many remembers that amen and the plague shall not come upon you to destroy you you see this represents and type our identification by faith with the blood of jesus christ the lamb so now we're being justified by faith by his blood we are safe from the wrath that is to come amen so that's number one but number two second thing is every israelite had to eat the lamb's flesh amen and this was for a different reason this was not for protection from sin nor the death angel this was for physical strength for the journey eating the lamb was for physical strength eating drinking the or applying the blood was to protect him from the death angel but eating the lamb was for the strength for the journey amen for physical strength if the deliverance from slavery then meant healing for the body also did delivery tonight from the slavery of sin must provide for healing also you can't have one without the other amen if you've got if you got the wine you got to have the bread to go with it if you got the blood of the lamb you got to have the body of the lamb to go with it so you see there has to be divine healing that is included in the promise now if it was in the passover then and we now have a greater lamb and a greater passover then healing must be provided in this passover eating the lamb's flesh had nothing to do with the passing of the destroyer the blood was the sign of the token when i see the blood i'll pass over you you see the destroyer had no authority to touch that house amen israel was beginning a journey and as they started that journey which is a type of our own christian journey amen god planned that his children for that journey would be well and to be strong for this journey and i want you to know tonight that's still god's plan god wants you to be well god wants you to be healthy god wait god wants a people that believes his word and proclaims that word for our own healing and deliverance it's god's desire for you said third john 1 and 2 said beloved i wish above all things that might prosper and be in health even as i soul prospers god wants you to be well it's the wrong thinking god wants you to suffer god wants you to be healed amen so while this is for god's glory it might result in god's glory but god don't get any glory out of you being sick god gets glory when you're healed amen now the lamb's body when they ate it it became their body think of that what happened to what happened to the flesh of that animal here they eat the lamb by the justin the food it sent right into the bloodstream and its chemical essence becomes flesh of our flesh and bone of our bone and skin of our skin and body of our body it becomes a part of us the flesh or the body of the lamb slain in egypt was eaten and when it was eaten it became a part of every israelite it became their flesh their bones their skin their body it's a type of the body of jesus christ who became the slain lamb now paul said that we by faith we we have become members of the body of his flesh and of his bones we partake of that same body of christ and type every time we take the bread of the communion service if you listen to brother branham in the great shining light he said thou shalt say in thy heart disease move from my child and this is the way i want you to approach the communion tonight you'll be saying in your heart disease you move from my child disease move from my body in the name of the lord jesus and don't doubt and right there good germs take on new armor and new weapons and the enemy begins to back up he is defeated because christ in the drinking of his murder at calvary defeated the devil and every one of his power and he stripped him of everything he had and he's nothing but a bluff somebody ought to said hallelujah amen what what did he said when you when you begin to pray and believe and you begin to say disease move from my child move from my body he said good germs amen begin to take on new armor and begin to get in a new weapon and the enemy begins to back up you know god designs your body to heal itself that when cancer comes in it's to have is to have the the the different i don't know the medical terms but i'll just use for the term just uh just for a lay boy's explanation the antibodies in your body begins to work begins to throw out the the bad sails begin to conquer them come on amen that's exactly what happens and when we begin to pray god begins to cause a something to stir within your body that awakens your own immune system to throw out that disease that's what's going to happen tonight when you come to this communion god's going to anoint your body to start throwing out the disease and the affliction that's bothering it [Applause] now faith recognizes that fact it claims the promised benefits because jesus was beaten for me in death which which bore all our physical infirmities our pains our diseases and weakness like i said at calvary you know when he when he was took those stripes when he was beat on the head with a rod amen for everyone that had a headache or that has a headache or is troubled with headaches are you here tonight amen jesus took the beatings on his head and received headaches in your stead so that you could be healed you say i've got back pain he took stripes on his back so that your back could be healed you say i've got footprints he took the nails in his feet so that by what he suffered at calvary you could be free from the sickness that wants to come against your body for by whose stripes we were healed [Applause] is that the word or isn't it the word now the israelites would eat the lamb's body they would begin their journey the very next day and as they journeyed their sickness vanished their infirmities disappeared they were physically strong and whole oh granny's sitting there in the corner there laying on her death bed and about to be you know there's planning her funeral because she wouldn't make it on this journey she took a bite of that lamb the strength of that lamb came in her and she got up shouting i ain't going to take nothing for my journey now i'm going to this promised land with the rest of you i'm telling you there was not one feeble one among them no one was sick no one was feeble no one was weak every one of them among them was strong and well and healthy they'd eaten the lamb's body and that body had become a part of their own body and three million people and there wasn't a feeble one among them that i read that in the bible you've got to believe that if you believe jesus rose then you know that same power happened that 3 million went on their journey and not a feeble one that's an incredible brother branham would preach a sermon called dr moses and he said i wonder what kind of prescription was in his bag he said every time they got sick he just reached in there and brought it out i am the lord god that heals all thy diseases i will put none of the diseases upon you that is put upon the egyptians you say well brother tim well you know y'all you got the covid and and yeah i had it had it for about a day my wife had it about six hours we got rid of it in a hurry amen i couldn't wait to see its tail run out of the house amen but i but we believed right we still profess right amen and i'm just going to say if your loved one is laying there sick and dying in the hospital right now he's the lord god that heals all diseases amen you need to claim that for them amen so they're there but but again he said i will put none of these diseases on you i want you to know god didn't give me covert 19 but god took it off god doesn't give you infirmities but god would take them away amen god doesn't give you hereditary traits of sickness but he'll take him away amen god declared he would let no disease to come upon them as long as they were obedient to him and that's still his promise and he further promised he says the number of your days i will fulfill it's not a great promise it's even greater the older i get because the devil can't kill me till god's ready for me he can't take my life until god says your time's up amen and so he said the number of your days i will fulfill and that's still his promise in spite of how many at corinth died prematurely and then even more today are dying prematurely but all of god's promises are ready there for us to claim when we believe it now they must become ours personally again now to every believer born again child of god with death come stealing at your door prematurely the angel of god stands between you in the sickness and if you want to run right on to it that's your business but you don't have to he's standing between you and death and brother branham was paralyzing or are paralleling rather they did where israel was there at the red sea and here comes here comes the enemy right in behind them and going to destroy their life and what happened god stood between them and death the egyptians the pillar of fire was there between them and the egyptian and he says the angel of god stands between you and sickness amen and he said when death comes stealing to the door prematurely the angel of god stands between you and sickness now if you want to run right on to it that's your business but you don't have to that's why i said don't give up on the harvest because you'll reap if you think not now remember israel was not only applied the lamb's blood the doorpost which was a type of salvation from sin but they also ate the lamb's body and that is a type of healing from sickness you know sickness and sin that come from the fall they're kind of like twin evils sin said in the soul sickness said in the body sin and sickness there is designed to tear down to kill to destroy god's creation that's what they that's that's the work that they do but god provided in the ins to oppose this sin and sickness these twin evils god provided for us twin mercies and those twin mercies is salvation from sin and healing from sickness those are god's twin mercies amen and these mercies are to to give you the abundant life of jesus christ where you for your journey that you can enjoy god's blessings now when jesus became our substitute he bore our sins and our sickness he did this in order that we might be delivered from them and from their power and man he shed his blood for remission of sins and he put away our sickness and our infirmities so that we need to never suffer them again think about that jesus paid it all come on somebody you got to know this is the truth amen god when he provided that the atonement it was for sin and sickness alike he was not only to deliver there from the destroyer for the israelite but he was also the healer of their their diseases and in malachi malachi 3 and 6 he says i'm the lord thy god and i change not so if god provided in that exodus wouldn't god provide it in this exodus wouldn't his attitude be the same as when he walked on the shores of galilee toward sickness what shouldn't our attitude towards sickness be the same the bible said he healed them all is it wrong for us to think that god wants us to be well is that error every israelite would put the blood on the doorpost they were protected from the death angel the destroyer every israelite who ate the lamb's body were freed from sickness and were made well and strong and healthy this this has always been god's plan you know it's his plan for redemption for restoration salvation we we're to be brought back and restored listen the church has long forgotten that god is not just a savior he's a healer you know when david gave a praise unto god what is it psalms 104 or something like that he said bless the lord of my soul and forget not all his benefits he said who he forgives all your iniquities that's the sin question and who heals all your diseases there's a sickness question provision has been made for deliverance for both sin and sickness by the same atonement we sang the song when i come out one of my favorites one that stirred my heart as a young boy where that i made one of my first moves for christ when i realized he was wounded from my transgressions he was bruised for my iniquity we were singing in in children's church he was wounded for my transgressions he was bruised for my iniquity and it so overwhelmed me the realization of what he did for me that i wept and cried and gave my heart to him isaiah prophesied in isaiah 53 that most wonderful scripture of redemption he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquity all of that that's the sin question and with his stripes we were healed there's the sickness question so again we see in the atonement in the promise of atonement there was deliverance from both sin and sickness now of course you know when you're delivered in your soul from sin it's once and for all right you never lose your salvation but in your body it's mortal and until we get a new one we're going to be attacked all the time and it'd be like paul was you know where a messenger of satan would come and buffered him and so that means time after time after time he come and attacked and he attacked and he attacked and you get healed tonight and you'll get attacked again but he's still the lord and heals all when jesus began to preach the gospel of the kingdom he proved he was the healer of sickness as well as a forgiveness forgiver of sins how many knows that's what they wanted to crucify him over was he forgave sins to the man who was sick with the palsy you know what that was he was a paralytic and there with being unable to walk a paralytic jesus said to him son your sins are forgiven so he provided forgiveness we believe that don't we they didn't believe it then but we believe it now don't we and but he also said now to prove that i'm able to forgive sin said take up your bed and walk so you see the very proof of him able to save from sin is in divine healing because if he can heal your body he can certainly heal your soul now jesus ministered for three years and all of those three years he it was engaged in healing the sick and forgiving the sinful over and over and over again he would say god's sins are forgiven they would ask him you know in a very the only time that he was ever questioned about god's will for healing and there was a leper that come to him and said lord if it be your will will you heal me of my leprosies that i will be thou clean he showed right there that's his will his will is that the lepers be clean the crippled to walk the blind to see the death to hear to heal all manner of diseases and sickness then come that crucial time there at calvary that we preach about so much and the world preaches about he become our substitute he became oh i hate to say it but he became sinful with our sins the bible said he who knew no sin became our sins so that we could become his righteousness think about that how many believes tonight that your sins were laid on him at calvary that he paid for your sins you believe that but i want you to notice that not only would he become sinful with our sins but he who never had to be sick i'm letting that sink in because remember he in order to suffer for us he took on the form of the seed of abraham the likeness of man he didn't have to be sick he would be made sick for you just like he was made sin for your sins he was made sick for you both sin and sickness had to be taken away or put away but first the penalty for both had to be paid he would have to pay it you remember when man sinned immediately sickness came in he lost his immortality so redemption would have to include the redemption of the soul and the redemption of the body now we know jesus christ a worthy lamb he was the only one that could do this he did it the bible said he would do this because god so loved the world if i could make that personal god so loved you i mean you know really it's no good value to you as long as just to the world but it's got to become personal god so loved you he gave his only begotten son it was because of his love his love constrained him to bear your sins and bear your sickness at the passover the taking of the bread and the wine and you know he he tried to show his disciples what would be the effects of his suffering and that he would uh undergo and paul would relate it later you know when he and explain it even in more detail he says the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed he took bread and when he had given thanks he'd break it and said to take heat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me and after the same manner he also took the cup and when he accepts saying this cup is the new testament or the new covenant in my blood you know as often as you drink it remember me remember remember why you have this atonement because i dearly paid for it i paid it where you wouldn't have to be a sinner and i paid it so that when you're sick you could be healed probably this disciple sitting at the table with him didn't even know what was going on they didn't understand him when he spoke those words they didn't they didn't comprehend there was a lot of things they were missing a lot of hardness of their heart and unbelief and literally little could they expect what was coming but it came and it came for a reason it was for your deliverance in mind jesus would go to that awful place of calvary he would take beatens on your behalf the sufferings of christ was tremendous and i'm trying to get to you today it was for a purpose it would be the lamb dying in your place you were the guilty and you were the one deserving of death but the lamb died in your place same with israel israel had done just as many sins perhaps it doesn't really matter all sin and fall short of the glory of god israel they were they were a sinful people as well they were worthy of judgment and death but god provided the lamb to die in their place it wasn't because that they were innocent that they lived it was because that god allowed the innocent sea of the lamb to be accounted to them and so there was a death in their dwelling that's why the death angel would pass over now you know they're there again at calvary at the hands of cruel men terrible mocking jesus our lamb was beaten he was spit on bruised tortured his body there there would be deep furs that would be plowed in his back until parts of his bones of his spine and his ribs would show through he was lacerated with awful stripes of the by the roman lash you know only on his body there were stripes by which isaiah said by these stripes you were healed and peter would would agree with this and he would he would say the same thing by these rights he took this so you can be healed now this was not a sacrifice for our sins this was for the bearing of our sickness he would die for our sins but he would be beaten for our healing the stripes were laid on his body that very day think of this for a moment the day that he healed peter's mother-in-law of a fever that same evening in matthew 8 16 when the evening was come that brought him many that was possessed with devils and he cast out spirits with his word remember me preaching about speaking the word and healed somebody helped me preach all that were sick and that it might be fulfilled what was spoken by isaiah's the prophet saying himself took our infirmities and bear our sickness so they they they they striped him and bruised his body and the stripes by which were healed and they nailed him to a cross they pierced his side his his blood would run down to the ground and his blood was shed for many for the remission of sin do we believe that tonight amen but that blood was shed for sin not for the healing of sickness jesus our lamb suffered two weights he is he set his blood on the cross for our salvation from sin we got that amen we believe that but he bore the stripes on his body for healing from sickness he was atoning for both at the same time his blood shed for sin his body offered for your sickness now i know you've been here a long time today but haunted in just a few moments jesus would suffer intense agony at calvary until even even god himself the the father would turn away from him reject him the sinner bearing your sins he would scream out my god my god why hast thou forsaken me he became forsaken so you wouldn't have to be forsaken but you know in that excruciating pain and suffering that he that he bore down there at pilates hall and when he was beaten with fists and hands there with the jews and all that happened and he got all them those horrible roman lashes though he bore our sickness he was literally made sick for us so that by his stripes we could be healed keep this in mind let me emphasize it jesus was not only made sin for us he was made sick for us the bible said this is why he could be a proper mediator because there's nothing you go through that he couldn't say i've been through it you say i've faced rejection brother tim from from those my children from my family from this from that one from the i felt suffered rejection he did you say brother jim i i i go through i you know i've been called bad names and then and as a christian i take ridicule i i he did he did everything that he might be a proper mediator that he wouldn't be somebody who had sympathy with you but he had empathy with you in other words he could say i know how you feel i've been through that myself so that he could pull from god for you the deliverance you need i want you to my bear in mind and i preached on it before and we don't have time to preach everything that i could preach on this subject but jesus was also the scapegoat as the escaped goat would they would place all the sins of israel upon it and take it out in the wilderness and leave it alone by itself and his caretaker slip away and leave it there to be torn by the wild beast even so jesus went to hell for us and he was torn and ripped by all the demons of hell but on that resurrection morning he changed from being the victim hallelujah he changed from being the victim in hell to the mighty conqueror and he rose up from the grave free from the sin of man and the sickness he had borne and he showed that he is the mighty conqueror over every sickness listen when he come out of the grave there was no there was no crippledness there was no staggering there was no bleeding come on somebody there was no there was nothing left of the sickness it was gone because when he raised and he triumphed he was healed of all of death and he rose up the mighty conqueror over all of it not crippled not maimed not torn not bruised not sore he didn't walk with the men on the way to emmaus and say i know uh brothers i went to a pretty rough thing yesterday in my back here and i've been laying on a hard stone there in this grave he wouldn't didn't say none of that did he he walked among them whole healed delivered he was triumphed over cancer he was triumphed over pain he was triumph over every infirmity he rose victorious when it was all ended it was time for him to leave the earth and returns to the father and sets down as our sacrifice and all things are finished he had completely delivered mankind both spiritually and physically from all satanic bonded and gave us a deposit on each one even the holy ghost you have is not redemption in fullness it's a deposit on your inheritance and i'll tell you if the deposit is this good just think what heaven's going to be but he didn't just give you a deposit within your soul he gave you divine healing as a deposit on your resurrection that just as sure as your body is healed you will also raise from the grave this is what paul is trying to teach us in first corinthians that we've read about in the 11th chapter about the elements of this communion of the lord's supper two elements by which we're to remember the sufferings of christ he said remember this i want you to remember what you remember when you passed by i paid for your sins i want you to remember when you take this bread i healed your diseases i want you to remember i gave my body for your healing that when you take this bread you are to remember i took your punishment paul tells us when you eat this bread and drink this cup you show the lord's death till he comes he interprets these two these two emblems the cup of blessings this is in first corinthians 10 16 he speaks of the cup of blessings which we bless is it not the communion of the blood of christ and the bread we break is it not the communion of the body of christ so jesus blood was shed when he bore our sins so that we would not have to bear them but we could be saved from them and delivered from the power of sin aren't you glad for that tonight what a wonderful savior what a wonderful redeemer how we glorify god in that but jesus body was also stripped and striped when he bore our sicknesses so we would not have to bear them but could be healed delivered set free from the power of sickness we have divine healing deliverance from the power of sickness because jesus took your stripes that's why we've got to understand when we come by this communion table tonight we've got to discern the lord's body we've got to look at this bread which he said is my body and realize what it represents when we're taking it we're taking the emblem by his stripes by his broken body he bore my infirmities so i could walk away from this communion table healed this is the gospel this is what brother branham preached about the communion this is why i said there's healing in the communion amen then then we are free from sickness just like we're free from sin amen i believe tonight you can walk through here receive the communion and be just as free from sickness as you are sin amen but close because sickness is not for god's glory amen no more for god's glory than sin is for god's glory amen we you know that sin and sickness was both done away with when jesus blew it all the bible said he and and the psalmist said he paid it all every bit when he was pierced scourged beaten on our behalf this is a different kind of prayer line tonight i'm not going to lay hands on you you're going to take the bread and you're going to hold it up and you say you're going to hold it up and you're going to say you were wounded for my transgressions this is why i have the blood bruised for my iniquities this is why i have the blood but by these stripes on this body i'm healed satan has no more claim because i have a deposit of eternal life because jesus paid it all we understand about the blood but are we understanding about the bread do we eat it as a token of that passover lamb just like the israelites takes of the body of the lamb before before the journey we we we're here today we're to give sacrifice our thanks rather for the sacrifice that jesus paid on our behalf brother var is his body that was offered us but friends let's just don't take it there they just don't take it for the sin part you know most of us we well know that jesus was pierced for us that he died in our place that he paid for our sins that he was paid and full by the blood of the lamb we're sure of that but we don't realize the benefits that we could receive because his body was beaten for us and why the stripes was laid on him who heals all diseases and because that we're not discerning the lord's body that our healing is just as paid for as our sins many are sick and weakly among us tonight when you come through this communion service i want you to discern the bread you understand the wine oh the wine the wine represents his life oh the fruit of the vine the grapes of the vine squeezed out and the light squeezed out so that you could drink it it's called the blood of the grapes that's the wine but now when we understand that we understand that was for our sins it is a type of the holy ghost it is wine it's alive it is it's it's fermented it has a life in it and man it it it bubbles up it is there it has a power in it why brother when i was a when i was a kid my mother was making the wine for the communion you you take the the the wine as it would ferment and screw the lid down on it too tight in a few days it explodes and it's there all over the city's ceiling because there's power in that wine it has to have room to expand to give out and when you receive the holy ghost there's power in that blood and it's a a la it's something that stimulates it's something that invigorates us or something that empowers it changes your thinking it changes your attitude it's a relaxing time that's the wine but what about the bread too often we have forgotten or failed have been told about the benefits that we received because his body was beaten for us each part of this communion tonight i've torn apart this bread i broke it already in my home as my wife would bake the bread i took it and i separated each piece the body that was whole of that whole loaf is now many pieces it was torn pulled apart cut apart for each one of you i did it with you in mind but he did it with you in mind and this is why that he would take this and he would do it for you to be healed so you see we got the blood of christ and we're going to come down and we're going to pick up this this little cup and each one of us will have our portion they're individual cups each each cup gets individually filled each believer has their own portion each believer has their own feeling are you with me i know i know there'll be those across the internet and saying you know brother tim you're using cups and the bible said cup well so you know i've actually had people who's watched our communion service especially some of the overseas brothers who write me and said aren't you aren't you ridiculous kind of denomination you know drinking out of them multi-cups i said well that's what brother branham did but you don't know that so i'll just show you two in in the quotes but nevertheless i said you know it's strange we get all all nervous about a cup and then when it comes to foot washing the bible said he took a pan and a towel and poured water and he washed all of them's feet in the same water using the same towel in one pan so i guess if we must have one cup we'll only have one pan tonight and one towel to wash everybody's feet in no takers that's the way i feel about the cup now so you see again you know we will everyone take our portion and we will look into that and we will think of the blood the blood the blood the blood and it's cleansed me from all sins and my sins are gone but i want you to lift up that body that bread and i want you to look at it and say he gave this body so i could be healed he took my weapons and bore my pains that i can walk past this communion line and be healed of all of my sickness are you ready for your healing tonight are you ready to say in this cup it represents forgiveness of sin and in this bread represents the healing for my body and i'm going to step from this table tonight healed because if they could take natural lamb i'm bringing it home to you if they could take natural lamb and eat natural lamb and for 40 years not a sequin among them then i can take this bread natural bread that we bless tonight i can take that and know it just as it will go out and into my bloodstream and it will equip all kinds of little antibodies down in my body to go out and do its work all through my body and nurture cells and build them up i know brother when it represents the body of my lord jesus amen every bit of it's going to go to its place and i'm going to be healed in this way i discern the lord's body we've read this communion scriptures tonight i'm inviting the brothers to come i want the musicians just to come for just a few moments i want us to sing that song again he was wounded for my transgressions it means so much to me isaiah 53 is one of the most sublime scriptures in the entire bible he was wounded for my transgressions he was bruised for my iniquities the chastisement of my peace was on him in other words he took the weapons the punishment that i should have got [Music] and with the stripes [Music] we are healed can we believe as brother branham did that there's healing and communion can we believe as our message taught us that we can come right through this communion line tonight and as we take of the sacraments [Music] be healed it's his promise [Music] are you ready to walk in that healing tonight he said brother tim what if i come through and i don't feel a thing it has nothing to do with how you feel [Music] it has to do with what god said the mountain was moving and only one grain of sand is moving it's moving [Music] and it's going to move because we believe his word now what we're going to do for those that are guests here we we don't have a close communion if you're believing christ and you want to come take communion with us you're welcome to come that's what we believe [Music] so it's not something just for our church if you're your visitor here and you want to take the communion that's fine [Music] we have an open communion but what we do have tonight we're going to also obey the word of god and we're going to wash one another's feet [Music] and we have a place set up over on this side for the for the ladies right over here in the hallway we have a place right over here on this side for the men men's restroom facilities over here women's over there so there's no reason for the men to go where the women are the women who go where the men are this is a very wonderful place god's and god could do us he provided so well for us so abundantly we got a wonderful place [Music] every time we drive up to this place we ought to thank god for it he's our shady guy he's more than enough they ain't hardly a thing in this building they need a testimony of the grace of god his blessings to us [Music] but as we take the communion the the deacons will usher you by the row and as they do the first that's going to come through the lines will be the musicians and the sound booth up there so that they can get back for the after service you'll file down here you walk out the men will go go back out these doors right here and the men will go to the my right and the women over to the left there's there's towels and now you can't wash every person's feet so just find someone that you can do it it's a remembrance that we're here to serve i mean he's here to serve amen humble ourselves down to serve these are the three ordinance that's left to us water baptism and we must be baptized in his name there's nobody anywhere in the bible that was ever baptized any other way than in the name of jesus christ he's got to be baptized in his name then we have communion and foot washing these are three ordinances left to the church and we do this till he comes [Music] till that meeting in the air and that corporal body where we meet the lord we do this till he comes amen don't worry about your right i got you one i said don't worry about your right i got you one [Music] amen god provides every need [Music] let's power hits jesus here is fragments of bread unleavened representing a sin a sinless body of our lord representing a sinless bride of jesus christ [Music] unleavened bread it's called the bread of haste where people lay aside the leaven to make the journey lord jesus before me also is the blood of the grape representing your blood your life that was poured out for us i pray in the name of jesus that you'll bless us tonight lord i'm looking forward to my healing in this communion because i know you were wounded for tim pruitt's transgressions and you were bruised for tim pruitt's iniquity and the weapons tim should have got you took for me and by your stripes tim fruit is healed i take it personal tonight i pray that every person will do the same bless i pray in the name of jesus the bread and the wine as we partake of it tonight and every saint that comes through here in jesus name amen we're going to sing this course just as a moment i want you to get your mind on it now he was wounded for our transgressions and he was bruised and surely [Music] amen one more time he was wounded [Music] for our iniquities [Music] is [Music] just give us some music from up there brother tim for the day bible said and let everyone wait for the other i want you just to take that moment lift up that bread to god that wine to god says this represents the forgiveness of my sins and healing for my diseases amen and i want you to walk out of here a whole person as the miraculous power of god goes to work bringing you that deliverance thank you you foreign foreign so um foreign worshiping you worshiping you [Music] there's nothing else [Music] worshiping you you make it easy
