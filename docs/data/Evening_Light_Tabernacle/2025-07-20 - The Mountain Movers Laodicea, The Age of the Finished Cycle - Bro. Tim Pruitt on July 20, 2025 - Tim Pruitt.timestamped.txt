[27:44] name above all names, Lord. And and I
[27:46] know there's coming a day when every

[28:06] consecrated, I pray you'll forgive us of
[28:08] that, Lord, and just draw us closer
[28:10] today and increase our faith, Father.

[29:10] to step aside and Lord, may you speak
[29:12] today to us, Father. May the words,
[29:14] Lord, find a good ground today. May we
[29:17] not reject it, turn away from it, or
[29:19] harden our hearts. But today, Lord, may
[29:21] we allow it to take root in our life.

[29:25] brother Joe, both out today ministering.
[29:27] May you use them, Lord, for your glory.

[50:13] Be glorified
[50:18] in
[50:19] everything
[50:22] I say
[50:24] and do

[51:37] &gt;&gt; Let's just dedicate our hearts to him
[51:39] right now as we pray. Father, it's in
[51:43] the name of Jesus that we come.
[51:46] How wonderful it is, Lord, that we can
[51:49] come before you today.
[51:52] the awesome God
[51:54] &gt;&gt; who became one of us
[51:57] &gt;&gt; and ascended back into glory there
[52:00] &gt;&gt; to be our very approach to the throne of
[52:03] grace. Lord, we thank you for that
[52:06] welcome that we receive today.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; And we're just saying, Lord, in our
[52:10] lives, be glorified
[52:12] in your church. Be glorified.
[52:15] May you just bless your people today
[52:18] with your presence. May you anoint us,
[52:21] oh God, with your grace. Speak to
[52:23] hearts, speak to lives, Lord, ever need
[52:26] supply. Father, I pray in the name of
[52:29] Jesus that you'll just come today and
[52:34] speak to hearts, speak to lives as only
[52:37] you can. But we ask it in Jesus name.
[52:42] Amen. Amen. God bless you.
[52:46] Amen. Thank you. We appreciate the Lord
[52:48] and his goodness to us,
[52:50] &gt;&gt; his grace on our lives, his goodness and
[52:54] his mercy.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Good to see each one of you here
[52:58] today. Amen. And Sister Vicki, nice to
[53:01] have you back in church after being um
[53:06] infirmed there for so long. And the Lord
[53:09] is now bringing a restoration. We thank
[53:12] the Lord for that.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wednesday night, we saw Sister
[53:16] Lisa here. So, we know the Lord's
[53:19] working, doing things, and his grace is
[53:22] abundant, his protection upon you.
[53:24] Brother Peter, God bless you. Thank you
[53:27] for coming today. And and uh he's
[53:30] already professing he's healed. So,
[53:33] Amen. After being in the emergency room
[53:35] last night after losing his car, uh we
[53:38] just pray that God will help help him.
[53:40] Now, you know, life kind of throws some
[53:43] disappointments along the journey, but
[53:46] uh the Lord is gracious and helps us in
[53:49] every situation, and I know he'll do
[53:52] that for you today. Amen. God bless you
[53:54] as we worship the Lord together. And uh
[53:58] we're going to be today we're going to
[54:00] be speaking on um Leodosa the age of the
[54:05] finished cycle. And um and as you know
[54:08] we have been speaking on the mountain
[54:10] movers which is from Zechariah 4 and7.
[54:14] Who art thou oh great mountain? Thou
[54:16] shalt become a plain and the headstone
[54:18] shall be brought forth with shoutings
[54:20] crying grace grace unto it. And I
[54:23] believe there's a lot of grace in this
[54:25] age.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; But for our service today, we're going
[54:28] to be looking here at Revelation 3:14.
[54:32] And it says, "Unto the angel of the
[54:34] church of the Leodysians, write these
[54:36] things, say the Amen, the faithful and
[54:38] true witness, the beginning of the
[54:40] creation of God. I know thy works that
[54:43] thou art neither cold nor hot. I would
[54:45] that thou work cold or hot. So then,
[54:47] because thou art lukewarm, and neither
[54:50] cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of my
[54:52] mouth, because thou sayest, I am rich,
[54:55] and increase with goods, and have need
[54:58] of nothing, and knowest not that thou
[55:00] art wretched, and miserable, and poor,
[55:03] and blind, and naked. And then he
[55:07] continues right on saying um I counsel
[55:11] thee to buy of me gold tried it in the
[55:14] fire that thou mayest be rich and white
[55:17] raignment that thou mayest be clothed
[55:19] and that the shame of thy nakedness do
[55:21] not appear and anoint thine eyes with
[55:23] eyes is that thou mayest see. As many as
[55:26] I love I rebuke and chasen. Be zealous
[55:30] therefore and repent. Behold, I stand at
[55:34] the door and knock. If any man hear my
[55:37] voice and open the door, I will come
[55:38] into him and will suck with him and he
[55:41] with me. To him that overcomemeth will I
[55:44] grant to sit with me in my throne. Even
[55:47] as I also overcame, and am sat down with
[55:51] my father in his throne. He that hath an
[55:55] ear, let him hear what the spirit saith
[55:59] unto the churches. Then we're going to
[56:01] go to Revelation 4:1. After this, I
[56:04] looked, and behold, a door was opened in
[56:07] heaven, and the first voice which I
[56:09] heard was as it were, of a trumpet
[56:11] talking with me, which said, "Come up
[56:13] hither, and I will show thee things
[56:16] which must be hereafter." Amen. God
[56:19] bless you. You can be seated. I believe
[56:22] there's a people within the Leodysian
[56:25] age
[56:26] who are the overcomers within the age.
[56:30] It'll be this age that sees this
[56:33] headstone that we just read about from
[56:36] Zechariah.
[56:38] Jesus Christ will come to the body and
[56:42] um it will be by grace that she will
[56:45] overcome because God's great favor is
[56:48] upon our lives. Now the seven church
[56:51] ages um uh you know are the seven
[56:55] churches rather that were addressed by
[56:57] Christ in revelation. They were gentile
[57:01] churches located in Asia Minor and these
[57:04] churches are not merely meant to be
[57:07] historical but they are prophetic and
[57:10] dispensational.
[57:12] And each one were unveiled a phase in
[57:16] the mystery of God's redemptive work
[57:18] among the Gentiles. Now I want you to
[57:21] understand uh the book of revelation is
[57:24] our book. It is for the end time people
[57:27] and it is our message and so many of
[57:31] these things which were symbolic in the
[57:34] scripture are now made known in this
[57:37] last day. And so God would actually
[57:40] write things in the book of Revelation
[57:43] that would um be in symbolic form and he
[57:47] wouldn't really just totally clarify his
[57:50] plan at that time because he left it to
[57:53] the last days and it would be then
[57:57] revealed to the end time people. Now God
[58:00] did this on purpose. He knew his coming
[58:02] would be ages later. Seven in fact,
[58:06] seven ages later. And so he actually
[58:10] wanted every person in every age to go
[58:14] down with it expecting the Lord to come
[58:17] and watching for his appearing.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; So he wanted everybody to be in a state
[58:22] of readiness.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; In fact, with his um coming, he always
[58:27] uses the word watch. So watch is
[58:31] associated with his coming. And so we're
[58:34] living in a rapture hour and is a time
[58:37] of watchfulness and and so um it's a
[58:41] time where there is an unveiling or a
[58:44] making known of God's redemptive plan.
[58:47] He's letting us know where we are in
[58:50] time and where what he has been doing
[58:54] through the ages so that we could of
[58:57] course have a even a greater level of
[59:00] expectancy than other ages have had.
[59:04] Now, of course, as we mentioned that
[59:07] these um about these churches um and and
[59:11] there's things that we want to point out
[59:13] about them as brother Brandham tells us
[59:15] in the Ephesian church age. Now, I think
[59:18] there's something else you ought to
[59:19] know. The seven churches were addressed
[59:22] by John are in Asia Minor and they're
[59:25] all gentile churches. Now, this is a
[59:27] very important part. He does not speak
[59:30] to the church at Jerusalem, which is
[59:33] mostly Jewish with perhaps a few
[59:35] Gentiles in it. The reason is that God
[59:38] has turned from the Jews to the
[59:40] Gentiles.
[59:42] And thus the whole of the church ages,
[59:45] all seven church ages is God dealing
[59:48] with the Gentiles and calling out a
[59:51] Gentile bride to himself. And that makes
[59:54] the church ages and the fullness of the
[59:57] Gentiles the one and the same thing. So
[1:00:01] whatever God does for the Gentiles, he
[1:00:05] will do it in these seven ages. Now,
[1:00:09] this is going to be important especially
[1:00:11] as we come along into this Leodysian age
[1:00:14] so that we will know and identify the
[1:00:18] hour that we're in and know um that we
[1:00:24] in other words prepare us that we can be
[1:00:27] watchful in this hour
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; instead of just slumbering on thinking
[1:00:31] that time's just going to go right on
[1:00:33] because we are now at the end of the
[1:00:36] ages. So notably the church in Jerusalem
[1:00:40] which was primarily Jewish in its early
[1:00:43] days is not mentioned and there's all of
[1:00:46] these seven or gentile churches and this
[1:00:49] uh mission was intentional. It was by
[1:00:52] the time of John's writing God had
[1:00:54] already turned to the Gentiles to take
[1:00:57] out of them a people for his name's
[1:00:59] sake. You find that in Acts 15:14. Thus,
[1:01:03] the entire span of the seven church ages
[1:01:07] represents God's dealing with the
[1:01:10] gentile world, specifically with his
[1:01:13] gentile bride. And when the Leodysian
[1:01:16] age ends, the gospel again turns to the
[1:01:20] Jews. And that's where we are. As you
[1:01:23] can already see, it is poised to go back
[1:01:26] there the as we have received the last
[1:01:30] message and the Jews are now back in
[1:01:32] their homeland in order to receive their
[1:01:35] Messiah. Right? So, and and so we're
[1:01:39] we're right here at the time where it's
[1:01:41] about to turn to the Jews, but it has
[1:01:43] not yet. God is still finishing up the
[1:01:47] time of the Gentiles. That's why we are
[1:01:50] still in the Leodysian age. And this is
[1:01:53] why the church ages and the fullness of
[1:01:56] the Gentiles spoken of in Revelation or
[1:01:58] Romans um 11:25 are one and the same
[1:02:02] prophetic timeline. And just as a church
[1:02:06] began with a spiritfilled bride at
[1:02:09] Pentecost, it will conclude with a
[1:02:13] spiritfilled bride. washed in the blood,
[1:02:16] filled with the spirit, clothed in the
[1:02:18] revealed word of her day. So I want you
[1:02:22] to understand it's like the planting of
[1:02:24] the wheat. It begins with the grain, it
[1:02:27] ends with the grain. So we are here
[1:02:29] again at a completed cycle or the
[1:02:32] finishing cycle. So, as you're seeing
[1:02:35] this, we're we're going to understand
[1:02:38] again from brother Brandham telling us
[1:02:40] the seven church ages set forth in in
[1:02:43] Revelations chapter 2 and three, it
[1:02:46] takes in the whole span of the fullness
[1:02:49] of the Gentiles or the whole time which
[1:02:52] God is dealing with the Gentiles under
[1:02:55] salvation. When the gent when the
[1:02:58] Leodysian in age ends, there will be no
[1:03:01] more Gentiles saved. As long as the
[1:03:04] Leodysian the seventh age is going on,
[1:03:07] there are still opportunities for people
[1:03:10] to in the Gentiles to be saved. Then it
[1:03:12] will turn back to the Jews. And we're
[1:03:15] living right now in this. And I want you
[1:03:17] to notice these two quotes. the it's
[1:03:20] very clear the seven church ages
[1:03:23] represent the fullness of the Gentiles.
[1:03:26] God's dealing with the Gentile world are
[1:03:28] confined to these ages. He he does not
[1:03:32] deal with the Gentiles out of this
[1:03:34] prophetic timework or framework. It is
[1:03:38] um within these ages that God calls out
[1:03:41] a bride from each generation, a people
[1:03:45] for his name to be united with him. So
[1:03:48] God will have a bride out of every
[1:03:51] generation or every age. Now in every
[1:03:55] age, God will address both the true and
[1:03:59] the false vines. This is very important
[1:04:01] when you're reading the about these
[1:04:04] seven churches or you're reading our
[1:04:07] part of the book of in the book of
[1:04:08] revelation of the leodysian age. You see
[1:04:11] he's not addressing us completely as the
[1:04:15] bride. He's also addressing the false
[1:04:18] vine. He is speaking to both of them.
[1:04:21] Though there's only one message, it
[1:04:24] comes through the messenger to both
[1:04:27] groups. And the spirit speaks to them as
[1:04:30] if they were one church. And that is why
[1:04:34] the letters to the churches in
[1:04:36] Revelation are directed to a singular
[1:04:39] body. Yet within that body are two
[1:04:43] distinct spiritual seeds. Remember now
[1:04:46] as as the son of man went to sew the
[1:04:49] seed, he swed the good seed, right? And
[1:04:53] then his enemy came and swed a tear and
[1:04:56] he said, "Let them grow together.
[1:04:59] They're all going to be in the same
[1:05:01] field. They're all going to be under the
[1:05:03] opaces of the same church that will all
[1:05:06] be in the same framework of the of the
[1:05:09] church. And Jesus will address both of
[1:05:12] them as though they were his own." Now
[1:05:14] you might ask why does God even refer to
[1:05:18] the churches including the false vine as
[1:05:21] his churches? Well the answer is
[1:05:23] sobering is because these individuals
[1:05:26] are in name Christian
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; and they profess Christ. They assemble,
[1:05:32] they worship, and they claim the
[1:05:35] promises, but they do in vain. As Jesus
[1:05:38] said in Mark 7:7, "How be it in vain do
[1:05:41] they worship me, teaching for doctrines
[1:05:44] and commandments of men." So these are
[1:05:47] nominal Christians, believers in the
[1:05:50] flesh, but not of the spirit. You see,
[1:05:52] they bear his name, but not his life.
[1:05:56] They belong to the outward church, but
[1:05:58] they're not part of the body of Christ.
[1:06:01] The true believer, by contrast, has been
[1:06:04] baptized into Christ by the Holy Ghost
[1:06:09] and made a living member of him.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. So yet, even so, it is God's
[1:06:16] divine order now that the wheat and the
[1:06:19] tears grow together. And the false is
[1:06:23] not to be uprooted prematurely. God
[1:06:27] allows them to continue all the way to
[1:06:29] the end. So you're going to see two
[1:06:31] vines in every church age. And this is
[1:06:34] important in this age to know there are
[1:06:36] two vines and they're both coming to
[1:06:39] maturity in this last day because this
[1:06:42] is the final climax where the harvest of
[1:06:46] all of it comes. Now, so you see um
[1:06:49] there God will let them grow together
[1:06:53] until the harvest and then their time of
[1:06:55] binding and burning will come but not
[1:06:58] yet.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; Right? It's important to understand that
[1:07:02] these church ages consist of these two
[1:07:04] vines, one true and one false. The true
[1:07:07] bride, the true bride, listen to me
[1:07:09] close, the true bride in the Leodysian
[1:07:13] age is not the Christ rejector.
[1:07:18] Amen. The one who shuts him out, the one
[1:07:21] who leaves him knocking on the outside
[1:07:22] is the false vine,
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; not the elect.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. It is she who is lukewarm,
[1:07:30] self-sufficient,
[1:07:31] void of the spirit. She's the one that
[1:07:34] says that Christ says, "I'll spew you
[1:07:37] out of my mouth." Declaring, "You will
[1:07:39] not speak for me. You are not my voice.
[1:07:42] You are your own voice."
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. But it's not so with the true
[1:07:48] bride. She hears his voice. She opens
[1:07:50] the door. She welcomes him in.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; And well, while the false church boast
[1:07:56] of her riches and need of nothing, the
[1:07:59] bride of Christ humbly receives what he
[1:08:02] offers.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; You see, he offers gold tried in the
[1:08:05] fire, white raignment to cover her. Isab
[1:08:09] to see clearly in a deceived generation.
[1:08:13] I want you to know God makes provision
[1:08:16] so there can be a victorious bride in
[1:08:20] the end time.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. He the church that he started out
[1:08:24] with when he said on this rock of the
[1:08:27] revelation of who I am, I will build my
[1:08:31] church and he said the gates of hell
[1:08:33] will not prevail against it. I want you
[1:08:36] to understand the bride in Leodysa does
[1:08:39] not go down in defeat. She leaves here
[1:08:43] in total victory
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; now. So you see she overcomes the spirit
[1:08:49] of the antichrist because she walks in
[1:08:51] revelation.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that revelation is
[1:08:55] supernatural. It's not intellectually.
[1:08:57] It comes from a new birth that allows
[1:09:00] him to understand spiritual things
[1:09:03] because you can only understand
[1:09:05] spiritual things by the new birth. Jesus
[1:09:08] said to Nicodemus, you know, you must be
[1:09:10] born again in order to see or understand
[1:09:13] the kingdom of God.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; So you see, it takes a new birth in
[1:09:17] order for us to see or to understand. So
[1:09:20] it is not an intellectual understanding
[1:09:23] or knowledge or learning. It is a
[1:09:26] revelation that must come from the new
[1:09:28] birth which is the spirit. Now the eyes
[1:09:31] have the spirit of course removes the
[1:09:34] smoke of deception. And brother, there's
[1:09:37] more of it than ever in this last day.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 9 depicts that the a
[1:09:44] great star falling from heaven. Notice a
[1:09:46] fallen star. He's given permission or a
[1:09:49] key to open the bottomless pit. And when
[1:09:51] he does, all the smoke of blinded
[1:09:54] delusion comes out.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; And of course, it it permeates the age
[1:09:58] and it permeates everywhere. is it
[1:10:01] taints, you know, the um everything. It
[1:10:05] gets in every crack and crevice of
[1:10:08] humanity.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; And you see, but the is of the Holy
[1:10:12] Ghost removes the smoke of deception so
[1:10:16] that we can see the word clearly.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for Isab?
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, she the bride does not
[1:10:25] blend with the system. She rises above
[1:10:27] it. She reflects Christ. enough the
[1:10:31] culture around her.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; She is not lukewarm. She's on fire with
[1:10:36] the life of the word.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Now this Leodysian age that we have read
[1:10:40] about. It is being the first age is the
[1:10:44] very hour that the rapture will take
[1:10:46] place.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. It is the age that Christ calls
[1:10:51] his bride to come up. You see, she is
[1:10:55] lifted. She is lifted from the
[1:10:58] lukewarmness from the compromise from
[1:11:01] the self-satisfied religion of Leodysia
[1:11:05] and but not physically removed from the
[1:11:08] era immediately but spiritually
[1:11:11] separated. Amen. Awakened by the voice
[1:11:14] of the final messenger. That's what I'm
[1:11:16] telling you. His his his fan is in his
[1:11:19] hand and he is thoroughly purging his
[1:11:22] floor and he has taken even you as the
[1:11:26] bride of Christ and separating the chaff
[1:11:29] from the grain.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Understand that even you should say Lord
[1:11:33] let your spirit flow through me today
[1:11:36] and separate all the chaff out of my
[1:11:38] life.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Remove it all Lord because none of
[1:11:42] that can go in the rapture.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now this is why the the promise to
[1:11:49] the overcomer in Leodysia is so powerful
[1:11:52] and so significant. It says to him that
[1:11:56] overcomemeth
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; will I grant to sit with me in my
[1:12:00] throne.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. What is that? That is the bride's
[1:12:04] reward.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; And her reward is union with her husband
[1:12:10] king.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. is not at the end of the future
[1:12:14] era, but it's the close of this one. The
[1:12:16] rapture occurs within Leodysa, not
[1:12:19] beyond it.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; And until that moment, the bride is here
[1:12:24] in this Leodysian age, but not in his
[1:12:27] spirit.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Until the rapture, the bride re
[1:12:31] remains within the framework of
[1:12:34] Leodysia, but not conformed to it.
[1:12:37] She is under the influence and the
[1:12:40] ministry and the message of the seventh
[1:12:44] angel.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; And that seventh angel calls her out and
[1:12:48] awakens her and prepares her for the
[1:12:51] coming of the bridegroom. That's what
[1:12:53] this message is about.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; Our end time message is about awakening
[1:12:57] a people. Not letting you go on in sleep
[1:13:01] and slumber, but awaken you
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; where you can see clearly your day and
[1:13:07] your hour. You must recognize your hour
[1:13:10] of visitation.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; Remember, she hears his voice. She trims
[1:13:14] her lamps. She anoints her eyes. And she
[1:13:18] makes herself ready.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; I want you to get it. You got something
[1:13:23] to do.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. You got something to do. You
[1:13:28] got to make yourself ready.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; Examine the fire in your life.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; Examine whether or not there's oil.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; Examine examine your life and and and
[1:13:42] rub this. Get the sleep out of your
[1:13:44] eyes.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Rub eyes out in it.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; You're going to need an abundant supply
[1:13:49] of it
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; because smoke after smoke is coming from
[1:13:53] every kind of direction that you can
[1:13:55] look at. I mean, look where I mean, it
[1:13:58] is so smoky. You can't they can't even
[1:14:00] tell a man for whether a woman is a man
[1:14:03] or a man is a woman. And they can't even
[1:14:05] call them what they are.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; We're we're in a day and hour where
[1:14:11] there's confusion everywhere. And it's
[1:14:14] because of the smoke of this society, of
[1:14:18] the lukewarm age that we're living in.
[1:14:20] But God has given you eyes
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; so that you can see in this hour that
[1:14:26] you will not be a blind le oysia
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; but you will recognize your day and his
[1:14:33] message.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Now I want you to get it. The call that
[1:14:36] says come out of her my people in
[1:14:39] Revelation 18:4 is not about leaving
[1:14:42] geography or time but about leaving
[1:14:45] mixture, leaving compromise, leaving
[1:14:48] spiritual death. It is a call to
[1:14:51] separation, sanctification, and
[1:14:54] readiness.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Come out of her, my people.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; To be clear, the call to come out of
[1:15:00] Leodysa is not a call to leave the age.
[1:15:03] For the bride is not yet removed from
[1:15:05] Leodysia itself, but rather from its
[1:15:08] spirit, its systems, and its deception.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:15:14] And when we're caught up to meet the
[1:15:15] Lord, then she is removed from the age
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; and from its judgment.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; She is raptured at the climax. For while
[1:15:25] the age spirals toward apost apostasy,
[1:15:30] the bride ascends into glory.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. And she is clothed, she is
[1:15:36] refined, she is anointed, and she is
[1:15:39] united with Jesus Christ on his throne.
[1:15:41] The rapture will take place in the
[1:15:44] Leodysian age. You are in the age of the
[1:15:47] rapture.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; Now, brother Bradom tells us this in the
[1:15:52] as before he leaves just days before he
[1:15:55] leaves and that where he says we find
[1:15:57] here that Enoch was the seventh from
[1:16:00] Adam which was a type of the church
[1:16:02] ages. All the rest of the six men before
[1:16:06] him died but Enoch was translated. Enoch
[1:16:09] was raptured. the seventh showing it's
[1:16:12] the seventh church age that takes the
[1:16:14] rapture. Now there's no doubt we are in
[1:16:18] the seventh church age. We all know it.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; Now there seems to be a bit of confusion
[1:16:24] today as to whether we are in the
[1:16:26] seventh church age. And you say,
[1:16:28] "Brother Tim, why is that even
[1:16:30] important?" Because if you if you teach
[1:16:32] this incorrectly, you build a platform
[1:16:35] for these eight day messengers.
[1:16:39] And also, you know, you you you allow
[1:16:43] people to to believe there's another age
[1:16:46] and to be led out from under the seventh
[1:16:49] angel in his message.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; So, it's important that we understand
[1:16:53] that there are no more ages.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; We are in the last age.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is the age that the
[1:17:01] rapture takes place. Now again um the
[1:17:04] seventh age church age it's the seventh
[1:17:07] church age that takes the rapture all
[1:17:09] the other six died but Enoch was
[1:17:12] translated because he was not found God
[1:17:15] took him. Isn't it wonderful that even
[1:17:17] in the book of the beginnings in the
[1:17:19] seed chapter of the Bible that God maps
[1:17:23] it out
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; and he shows that the seventh one from
[1:17:27] Adam
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; will take the rapture. Enoch walked with
[1:17:31] God and was not for God took him. What
[1:17:35] was it? He was prophesying of you
[1:17:37] coming. He was prophesying of your age.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; You are in the pro the prophecy of the
[1:17:45] Bible.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Enoch represents you.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; Now, so you see all the other six ages
[1:17:52] went down to death, but Enoch was
[1:17:54] translated for he was not found for God
[1:17:57] took him. Enoch raptured was a type of
[1:18:00] all the rest of them dying. But the end
[1:18:02] time bride will be called out. The
[1:18:04] rapturing without death will be called
[1:18:06] out of the seventh church age which we
[1:18:10] are now bearing record of that age. Oh
[1:18:14] my. Let's dig in deep real deep. So you
[1:18:17] know to me this is very important.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; It's important one thing to go back over
[1:18:23] some of this. I know maybe to some of
[1:18:25] you you want to yawn and say this is
[1:18:27] hoham. I learned this many many years
[1:18:30] ago, but I'm telling you right now, we
[1:18:32] got we got new people that are just now
[1:18:34] hearing.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; We got people that have been here for
[1:18:38] years that are just now hearing.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; So, you know, today I pray that it'll
[1:18:44] open up your understanding. But we are
[1:18:47] now bearing record of that age.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; I want you to hold that thought. If
[1:18:52] you're lukewarm, wretched, blind, and
[1:18:54] naked, then you are bearing witness to
[1:18:58] the false vine that exists within
[1:19:00] Leodysia.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; This bride will not be lukewarm.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may claim the name of Christ.
[1:19:08] You may claim the message. You may claim
[1:19:10] Evening Light Tabernacle is your home
[1:19:12] church. But your life is testifying
[1:19:14] against you. You see the very condition
[1:19:18] of spiritual poverty and the blindness
[1:19:21] is the evidence that you belong to the
[1:19:23] vine that has rejected the word and shut
[1:19:27] Christ outside the door.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Tim, in a message
[1:19:32] church, yes, sir."
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; As brother Brandham said, "And how can I
[1:19:35] overcome?" He said, "That old rotten log
[1:19:37] laying there in the very source of
[1:19:40] life." And he said, "You can sit right
[1:19:42] in the church where the spirit of God is
[1:19:44] moving and the and the Holy Spirit is
[1:19:46] flowing and rock twice as quick.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; It's important that you keep that life."
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, but if your faith has been
[1:20:00] purified,
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; is if if it's been refined by the fire.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you have been turned back
[1:20:07] to the apostolic faith of the fathers,
[1:20:10] then you are bearing witness of the true
[1:20:13] vine
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; in this final age.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many is bearing witness
[1:20:18] of that vine?
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh yes, sir. That's the gold tried
[1:20:23] in the fire. A tested, proven, enduring
[1:20:27] faith. Amen. It's not a man-made
[1:20:30] religion, but it's a spirit-born
[1:20:33] revelation. And that kind of faith
[1:20:36] identifies you as a part of the
[1:20:38] overcoming bride, the elect who has
[1:20:41] heard the voice of the last messenger
[1:20:44] and turned back to the word.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; What a wonderful hour we're living
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; again.
[1:20:55] If we look here, so no, now notice Enoch
[1:20:58] the type here. He's also typed in the
[1:21:01] seventh church age. Can you think of it?
[1:21:04] The seven church age. Notice at the
[1:21:06] sounding of how many believes there's
[1:21:09] been seven messengers for seven
[1:21:10] churches. Oh, we all believe it if we
[1:21:13] believe the Bible. If we don't believe
[1:21:15] the Bible, of course, we don't believe
[1:21:17] it, but there has been.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; How many knows that's in Revelation
[1:21:22] chapter 1, the last verse? said. Then he
[1:21:25] goes on to tell us that
[1:21:29] that we're living in the seventh church
[1:21:33] age. And when the Bible said that this
[1:21:36] seventh church age, when the messenger
[1:21:38] of the seventh church age begins to
[1:21:40] sound this message that the mystery of
[1:21:43] all these things that's been twisted up
[1:21:45] down through the age would be revealed
[1:21:47] in that time. Here we see it. the son of
[1:21:50] man coming among his people and doing
[1:21:53] exactly confirming his message as he
[1:21:56] said he would do. Here we find it in
[1:21:58] this last age now. So I want you to get
[1:22:00] this. The son of man Christ is revealed
[1:22:03] in the leodysian age.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; This is where he's revealed now. And the
[1:22:08] seventh watch
[1:22:10] like the seven like the seven watch one
[1:22:14] of them of of one come. He didn't come
[1:22:17] the first watch, second, third, fourth,
[1:22:20] but in the seventh watch. That was Enoch
[1:22:24] the seventh which was translated. And
[1:22:26] Noah being a type of the remnant of the
[1:22:28] Jews is to be carried over. Look at
[1:22:29] there. Noah even types the Jews
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; because he goes, they go through the
[1:22:35] tribulation waters
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; over into the millennium. So you have
[1:22:40] the whole thing, the whole picture, the
[1:22:43] whole thing mapped out for you right
[1:22:45] there in the first chapters of the book
[1:22:48] of Genesis
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; where he lays the seed of what he's
[1:22:52] going to do in the end time.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Right? He will have an Enoch who will
[1:22:58] take a rapture. He will have a Noah who
[1:23:00] will go through the tribulation.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; And those are the Jews and they will
[1:23:04] cross over into the millennium. Now, so
[1:23:07] Noah being a type of the remnant of the
[1:23:10] Jews is to be carried over. Now, the
[1:23:12] Bible in the Bible time talking about
[1:23:14] watches, the nights were not divided
[1:23:17] into hours in Bible times. Now, we're
[1:23:21] going to look at this for a moment
[1:23:22] because we're going to talk about the
[1:23:23] watches of the night. And and in ancient
[1:23:28] time, the Jews originally divided the
[1:23:32] watches in into three. And so we see the
[1:23:35] first watch with sunset to 1000 p.m. and
[1:23:39] second watch 1000 p.m. to 2 am and third
[1:23:42] watch 2 am to sunrise. But when you get
[1:23:46] over into the New Testament, you will
[1:23:48] find it talking about a fourth watch.
[1:23:51] And that's because they were under the
[1:23:53] Roman system. And under the Roman
[1:23:55] influence, they had this four watch
[1:23:57] system that they adopted. And there were
[1:24:01] segments of time from from sunset to
[1:24:05] sunrise. And the and during this time,
[1:24:07] the sentinels would would keep guard.
[1:24:10] And and while the while the world lay in
[1:24:13] darkness, it was really important to
[1:24:16] have watchmen
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; that was watching in the night
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; because you never knew when the enemy
[1:24:22] came. And and it was that in the final
[1:24:26] watch in the New Testament which was the
[1:24:29] fourth watch before the dawn that Jesus
[1:24:32] came walking on the water. So he come
[1:24:35] there and for deliverance remember
[1:24:38] brother Brandham preaching testimony on
[1:24:40] the sea and whatever and how we're there
[1:24:43] in that in that in that very time where
[1:24:46] some have went off without him and
[1:24:48] others he's in the boat but he's asleep
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; right and it's condition of the end time
[1:24:54] well it's in the last what or the
[1:24:56] leodysian age that Jesus comes to
[1:24:59] deliver walking on the waters
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; amen to deliver us in this time uh you
[1:25:05] know that where it's the darkest hour
[1:25:08] before before the light. Now night began
[1:25:13] when Jesus left the earth.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; Now I want you to get this because since
[1:25:19] the departure of the son Jesus Christ
[1:25:23] the church was plunged into darkness.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; So we have been in a time of darkness.
[1:25:34] for now 2,000 years are seven churches.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; All right? So, the church has been
[1:25:42] there. Now, when when he when he he left
[1:25:47] the earth, it became dark cuz he is the
[1:25:50] day star or the sun,
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; right? What is the day star?
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Let the day star rise in your heart.
[1:25:59] Remember that in the Bible? What is
[1:26:00] that? That's the sun. It's the star of
[1:26:03] the day. It's what brings the light of
[1:26:05] the day. Now, he's the day star, but the
[1:26:09] church is depicted here as candlesticks
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; or lampstands,
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; And you don't use them during the day,
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; use them at night.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when he left, the church
[1:26:27] became God's light on the earth. Amen.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; And as Revelation 1:20 explains, the
[1:26:33] seven stars of the angels of the seven
[1:26:36] churches and the seven candlesticks
[1:26:39] which thou saw us are seven churches. So
[1:26:41] the the candlesticks represent seven
[1:26:43] ages and the seven stars or seven angels
[1:26:47] are messengers.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; So there are seven messengers. And of
[1:26:53] course,
[1:26:54] excuse me,
[1:26:58] it's during the night when the the sun
[1:27:01] is absent that you see the stars come
[1:27:03] out.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; So, it's nighttime and there are stars
[1:27:08] out. Specifically, there are seven
[1:27:10] stars.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; Right? And there are seven lampstands.
[1:27:16] So, seven lights in the heavens bearing
[1:27:21] the the the light of God down to the
[1:27:24] earth, shining back upon the earth.
[1:27:26] They're really no light of their own.
[1:27:28] They are reflectors
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; of the sun.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; But the sun is absent, but it's shining
[1:27:35] on them and they're shining back a
[1:27:37] reflection of Christ back on the earth.
[1:27:40] So, what was Luther's message?
[1:27:41] Justification. What was that? A
[1:27:43] reflection of Christ. What was
[1:27:45] sanctification? A reflection of Christ.
[1:27:47] What is his message? A reflection of
[1:27:49] Christ.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; So you see as we see now then the our
[1:27:56] night of this church ages is not divided
[1:27:59] in four watches or three watches. It's
[1:28:02] divided in seven watches.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; Okay? Because there are seven church
[1:28:09] ages. So this night watch is divided in
[1:28:12] seven watches.
[1:28:15] And each age had a
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; watchman,
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; had a messenger,
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; And he would warn of the coming dangers.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; And he would tell what hour it was and
[1:28:30] the relationship of of the light of the
[1:28:32] sun and he would reflect back God's
[1:28:35] glory upon the earth
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; bringing God's message to his people.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; It's all laid out in the Bible.
[1:28:42] See, we have been in this time of
[1:28:44] darkness. And and now prophetically,
[1:28:47] we're living in this last watch or the
[1:28:51] seventh age.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; It is the very edge of night before the
[1:28:57] rising of the sun of righteousness.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; And that's what prompted our messenger,
[1:29:03] our watchman to preach messages like
[1:29:06] shalom.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; What was he a watchman?
[1:29:11] And he's saying, "The morning cometh.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; The night is still here, but the
[1:29:16] morning's coming."
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; Right? There's another day coming.
[1:29:19] Shalom. I'm already saying good morning,
[1:29:22] church.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; Because the light is about to dawn.
[1:29:26] We're in the last days. Good morning.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, that yep, even peaked over the
[1:29:34] horizon. But here he's coming out
[1:29:36] announcing the coming day.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's telling the time.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; He's telling the hour that we're in.
[1:29:44] Amen. And he preaches other messages
[1:29:46] like it is the rising of the sun.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're about to enter into a new
[1:29:53] dispensation. The the night is coming to
[1:29:56] end and the sun is now rising.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; Ain't that awesome? Where we're living
[1:30:02] at. Amen. The Now, the term watch
[1:30:05] doesn't just describe time. It speaks of
[1:30:08] responsibility. It speaks of vigilance
[1:30:11] of those who stand in the night and look
[1:30:13] toward the east for the first light of
[1:30:16] the sun.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; And long before the day dawns and the
[1:30:20] sun comes up, there appears and the
[1:30:24] morning star in the horizon.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want you to understand the
[1:30:29] morning star, you know, is most commonly
[1:30:32] referred to as as the planet Venus and
[1:30:36] it always appears in the eastern sky
[1:30:39] just before the dawn.
[1:30:43] And often when the night is still at its
[1:30:46] darkest, seem like just before dawn, it
[1:30:49] gets the darkest ever.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; That's the age that we're in.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; But in that time, the morning star
[1:30:55] appears.
[1:30:57] in the eastern sky and then this
[1:31:00] luminous celestial body. It it serves as
[1:31:04] a harbinger of the coming day as a sign
[1:31:07] the night is nearly over
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; and the sun is about to rise.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now listen, this is how it works.
[1:31:16] Naturally speaking, as we said, the
[1:31:19] morning star Venus rises just before the
[1:31:22] sun, often visible at the coldest,
[1:31:26] darkest part of the night.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. You notice it usually reaches its
[1:31:32] coldest temperature just before dawn.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; And it's it gets the darkest ever just
[1:31:39] before dawn. and its brightness and that
[1:31:43] morning star pierces through the
[1:31:45] lingering darkness and it acts as a
[1:31:48] signal that daylight is approaching.
[1:31:50] That's naturally. Now the sun isn't
[1:31:52] visible yet. The appearance of the
[1:31:55] morning star though means it's close.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; The night cannot last much longer.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now Jesus said in Revelation
[1:32:09] 22:16, he said, "I am the root and the
[1:32:12] offspring of David, I am the bright and
[1:32:14] the morning star."
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; So we know who the morning star is.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; So Jesus as a morning star, he appears
[1:32:22] before the full dawn of the millennial
[1:32:25] day,
[1:32:26] before the sun rises in full glory.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now his coming through the word
[1:32:34] revealed
[1:32:35] through the the revealing of the word
[1:32:38] the Holy Spirit is poured out and the
[1:32:40] bride is awakening. It is like the
[1:32:42] morning star signaling the eternal day
[1:32:46] is near.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; So I want you to understand the revealed
[1:32:49] word that we've received the Holy Spirit
[1:32:53] being poured out in this last day.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; The awakening of the bride,
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; it is all like the morning star.
[1:33:01] signaling that that um the eternal day
[1:33:05] is near. The morning star ministry in
[1:33:09] the bride rises while it's spiriously
[1:33:12] dark before the world recognizes the day
[1:33:15] is breaking. Now it is said by Peter and
[1:33:20] he said um you know where where or
[1:33:24] excuse me it's it says by in in
[1:33:27] revelation where he says Jesus said I'm
[1:33:29] the root and the offspring of David the
[1:33:31] bride and morning star. Let's go to the
[1:33:33] next slide now. And and second Peter
[1:33:36] 1:19 says until the day dawn
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; and the day star rise in your heart. You
[1:33:44] see that's what happens to you.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; You see you you you're you were
[1:33:50] sometimes darkness
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; but now you are light in the world.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; What happened there? There you're
[1:33:59] darkened soul back as midnight. There
[1:34:03] came a dawning of a new day
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; and the sun rose in your heart.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. And what's it do? It
[1:34:12] dispels the darkness. It gets rid of the
[1:34:15] shadows.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; All the the evils of the night is gone
[1:34:19] away. Sin, it's darkness. It's
[1:34:22] wickedness all flees away when the light
[1:34:26] dawns in her soul.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You take a woman like the
[1:34:30] woman at the well there so dark, so
[1:34:33] black. Amen. And and her predestinated
[1:34:37] sea so hidden. Amen. And covered up with
[1:34:40] sin. of prostitution and life of even
[1:34:45] religious doctrines and things that
[1:34:47] covered her up until she was black as
[1:34:50] black could be. But the same one at the
[1:34:52] beginning that said, "Let there be
[1:34:55] light."
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Had a divine appointment for her
[1:34:58] life.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; And he had a need to pass by her way.
[1:35:01] And that day dawned within her soul and
[1:35:05] she could say, "Come see a man who told
[1:35:07] me everything I did. Isn't this the very
[1:35:10] Christ? The light had dawned within her.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching to men and women today
[1:35:16] that light has dawned within your soul.
[1:35:19] You are no longer darkness anymore. Sin
[1:35:22] has vanished. The works of darkness has
[1:35:24] fled away. You are new creature in
[1:35:26] Christ. Hallelujah. Evil spirits can't
[1:35:30] hang around anymore because you are a
[1:35:32] living vibrant testimony of the day.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:41] And that means till the day dawn that
[1:35:44] means a personal revelation of Christ
[1:35:47] before the rapture. Remember that's what
[1:35:49] the new birth is to you. It's a
[1:35:51] revelation of Christ personally to you.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and so before the day of the
[1:35:58] world sees the son return in judgment,
[1:36:00] the son of man reveals himself just
[1:36:03] before Sodom burns.
[1:36:06] The bride receives this light first.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why God sent you a message.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; You receive the light first
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; before it ever dawns in the millennium.
[1:36:21] You've already got the light.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; That dispelled the darkness
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; of the past ages.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, so the bride receives as like
[1:36:33] first a forast of the coming glory
[1:36:36] before he appears to the rest of the
[1:36:38] world. So the book is opened, it is
[1:36:41] seals removed, exposing the errors of
[1:36:45] the dark night of the ages and revealing
[1:36:48] the true Christ of the revealed word. So
[1:36:51] the morning star heralds the morning. It
[1:36:56] says to those watching, hold on.
[1:37:00] The night is almost over.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen, that's the message
[1:37:05] from the morning star
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; to you today right here in Leosia. No
[1:37:09] matter how dark it is,
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; hold on, my child.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Hold on. Joy comes in the morning. Amen.
[1:37:18] The darkest hour means dark. It's just
[1:37:21] in sight. It won't always be darkness.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the light the light has
[1:37:28] sprung up.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; And there the morning star comes out
[1:37:35] heralding. Now remember it's Venus, you
[1:37:39] know, in the natural, but in the
[1:37:40] spiritual Jesus of course is that
[1:37:43] morning star, but it it also represents
[1:37:45] the messengers.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; And here is it shines his message. It is
[1:37:51] because the sun is approaching that it
[1:37:55] gets so bright.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; And I want you to know the reason we've
[1:38:00] had the bright day of a of a message in
[1:38:03] this day, somebody help me.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is because the light has shown
[1:38:08] upon a messenger who beam back a message
[1:38:12] back to the earth saying it will not
[1:38:14] always be dark.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; The ages will not be perpetuated.
[1:38:19] There's not another age coming. You have
[1:38:22] received reached the end time. You are
[1:38:25] here in the last days.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:31] Now, so in this time of darkness, the m
[1:38:34] morning star is rising in the hearts of
[1:38:37] God's elect. It's the word in power
[1:38:41] manifesting itself among us with
[1:38:44] raptured faith. Amen. It's and and when
[1:38:48] that star rises in full manifestation,
[1:38:51] it won't be long now until we're caught
[1:38:54] up and the day breaks eternal.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. I look around and I see
[1:39:02] aged ones among us. And I'm getting into
[1:39:05] that bracket myself aware that I'm older
[1:39:08] now.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not old, but older.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; And as we approach that, we've been
[1:39:14] along the road a long time. Amen. We've
[1:39:17] waited a long time.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; But I want you to know, friends, joy
[1:39:21] lays just ahead.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; Don't give up now.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; Don't lay down your sword. Don't get
[1:39:28] weary and welloing.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; Press the battle more than you've ever
[1:39:33] pressed. If you've ever fought, fight
[1:39:35] like you've never fought. Put every bit
[1:39:38] of energy, everything that you have into
[1:39:40] this last battle because we are here
[1:39:43] before the breaking of the day.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham tells us about the
[1:39:54] seventh watch. It's the watch of the
[1:39:58] resurrection. Oh, listen now. The hour
[1:40:01] we're living, oh God, the world is
[1:40:03] falling apart. There hangs in the
[1:40:07] hangers bombs. It hangs the things to do
[1:40:10] just exactly.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, we're here. It's a dark hour.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; Sodom is about to burn. The church is
[1:40:18] ready.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; She's sealed in, ready to come.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; There will be a big outpouring of the
[1:40:24] spirit. Yes, sir. To grab that church
[1:40:27] and take her into the skies.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; Say, "I ain't expecting nothing, Brother
[1:40:32] Tim. Open your eyes.
[1:40:34] get under expectation.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; There will be a big outpouring of the
[1:40:38] spirit. We're in it.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; That's him moving among us. That's him
[1:40:43] healing our sick. That's him dealing
[1:40:46] with the lost. That's him calling those
[1:40:48] that are prodicals. That's him.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. What is he doing? It's his
[1:40:53] outpouring to grab a church and take her
[1:40:56] into the sky. This is the final burst of
[1:41:00] the latter rain culminating in a
[1:41:02] lightning charge of the chains of the
[1:41:05] body
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; because see the church the word the
[1:41:11] bride and Christ's ministry is where in
[1:41:14] his bride which his body the celestial I
[1:41:18] meant to say the supernatural body of
[1:41:20] his or on the spiritual body on the
[1:41:22] earth his spirit is in there living his
[1:41:26] life right out until him and the church
[1:41:28] becomes one in the wedding. See, they
[1:41:31] become one. He takes them just a little
[1:41:34] minority in the last day. And then all
[1:41:37] those virgins that slept down to the age
[1:41:41] they all rose.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; Now, that's on the seventh watch,
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; the seventh church age.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; So, I want you to get it. The re the
[1:41:52] resurrection takes place
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; in this age.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; You are in the age of the resurrection,
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; the seventh age. Amen. So notice he said
[1:42:05] at the last or the at last end time le
[1:42:08] oysia at that end of when that little
[1:42:11] just a little group of them went in. But
[1:42:13] it brings all the resurrection of those
[1:42:16] who died in their ages living to that
[1:42:18] word that was ordained of God preached
[1:42:21] to happen in that day.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; Oh my, what an hour that we're living
[1:42:25] in.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. My goodness. All those virgins
[1:42:30] about to rise.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. What is he saying? Arise
[1:42:35] and shine. Thy light has come
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; and the glory of the Lord has risen upon
[1:42:41] you. Amen.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brethren, we're not in
[1:42:45] decline.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; We're where the Holy Spirit is being
[1:42:48] poured out.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Where he says, "The glory of the
[1:42:52] Lord is risen upon you. For behold, the
[1:42:55] darkness shall cover the earth and gross
[1:42:57] darkness the people, but the Lord shall
[1:43:00] arise upon thee, and his glory shall be
[1:43:04] seen upon thee." Oh, talk about it now.
[1:43:07] We're glorified with our soul. But wait
[1:43:09] till that day when we get glorified
[1:43:11] bodies that match the glorified soul.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. In the prophetic timeline of the
[1:43:20] gentile church of the seventh church
[1:43:22] ages, night fell when the sun, the day
[1:43:26] star departed the earth. And when the
[1:43:29] sun goes down, the stars come out.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; You don't see them out now. But when you
[1:43:36] when the when the when the the sun goes
[1:43:39] down, stars come out.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; And when the sun left, when Jesus left,
[1:43:46] stars came out.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; The seven stars, the seven messengers
[1:43:50] were set in place, one for each watch of
[1:43:54] the night to hold forth the word in a
[1:43:58] dark world darkened by sin and error.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; Think about what I'm saying. Brother
[1:44:04] Brandon would preach it like this.
[1:44:05] Watchmen, what of the night?
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; You see, that's what we wanted to know.
[1:44:11] Where are we in time?
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; What is the enemy doing? What do you
[1:44:15] see? Oh, watchmen.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; Oh my. God gave us a prophet with an
[1:44:22] eagle eye in this day that could all
[1:44:24] look all the way back and trace him all
[1:44:26] the way down to the ages, all the way
[1:44:29] down to now.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; What an age that we're living in.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; The seven stars of the seven angel
[1:44:37] messengers of the seven churches. You
[1:44:40] are the light of the world, said Jesus.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; Neither do men put a light a light a
[1:44:46] candle and put it under a bushel, but on
[1:44:48] a candlestick.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; He puts a he takes his light, sets it on
[1:44:52] a candlestick.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; Not only did he say, "I am the light,"
[1:44:56] but he said, "You are the light." Yes.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; And if his word is in you, bearing
[1:45:02] record of itself, then you are the light
[1:45:05] of the world. And I want you to know, we
[1:45:07] are the light
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; in this time of darkness.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; The seven golden candlesticks, his elect
[1:45:14] church, each burning in its appointed
[1:45:17] age, have given light through the long
[1:45:20] cold night of the church ages.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; And now we have come to the final watch.
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:29] And you're the light in it.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; You're the light in it.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham talked about this
[1:45:40] in souls in prison now. And he he said
[1:45:43] and he likened you. You sisters where
[1:45:45] they look and why you got that little
[1:45:47] bun on your back and here you are what
[1:45:49] them long skirts and unpainted faces.
[1:45:51] And he says you know that they don't
[1:45:54] think she's anything. But he said, "You
[1:45:56] just remember this.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; You just remember this. Just like the
[1:46:01] moon holds back the tides."
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; And he said, "It can't. The tide can't
[1:46:06] come in or go out without eternity's
[1:46:08] head."
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "So are you, little
[1:46:12] sister, holding the wrath of God off
[1:46:14] this earth."
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; But you're not going to be here forever.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; You're about to be lifted up out of
[1:46:20] here. And when it happens, chaos will
[1:46:23] will come upon the world that we live
[1:46:25] in. Sin, darkness, unbelief
[1:46:29] will take its toll.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; Now, so we've come to the final watch,
[1:46:34] the seventh, the last, the darkest. But
[1:46:37] this is also the watch of the sunrise.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; Son of man revealing himself
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; for you that fear my name. How many
[1:46:46] fears his name?
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; How many reverences him? How many loves
[1:46:50] his word? To you that fear my name shall
[1:46:53] the son of righteousness arise
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; with what? Healing in his wings.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, the rays of that light
[1:47:04] that comes up in the morning and you see
[1:47:06] that comes up like rays for coming out
[1:47:10] moving the darkness back. What's it
[1:47:12] doing? Bringing healing.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's dispelling the darkness. the
[1:47:19] fears of the night.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, are you with me?
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. During the night, you were there
[1:47:26] and you were looking there at that old
[1:47:28] ghost on the post and you were there all
[1:47:32] worried and scared and fearful and
[1:47:34] afraid. Amen. But when the light shines,
[1:47:37] it shows it ain't nothing but an old
[1:47:39] coat.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It dispels the fear. It
[1:47:46] takes away the darkness.
[1:47:49] Hallelujah. It causes you to rise in
[1:47:51] faith. It brings healing in his wings.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Healing for the sick soul, healing for
[1:47:56] the sin sick body.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, you that fear my name.
[1:48:02] Do you know that's the first verse of
[1:48:04] Malachi 4. It's actually the second
[1:48:07] verse. To you that fear my name
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; shall the son of righteousness arise.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; What did he do? sent Elijah the prophet
[1:48:15] to turn the hearts of the children back
[1:48:17] to the faith of the fathers. You see,
[1:48:20] rising with healing in his wings. And
[1:48:24] this very watch, the bride watch, the
[1:48:27] midnight hour, a cry has gone out.
[1:48:29] Behold, the bridegroom cometh, go you
[1:48:33] out to meet him.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, it's the hour of awakening.
[1:48:42] You you know you were awakened.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; What happened the you see the moment
[1:48:47] when when the watchmen are crying from
[1:48:50] the towers warning of the approaching
[1:48:52] dawn and return to the bridegroom for
[1:48:54] his bride. You were awakened by a
[1:48:58] midnight cry and the day star was rising
[1:49:02] in the hearts of the elect. And the
[1:49:04] light of full restoration is breaking on
[1:49:07] the horizon.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. friends, the world will get darker
[1:49:11] and darker, but not you.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Your light, your your life is
[1:49:17] about to get brighter and brighter and
[1:49:19] brighter and brighter.
[1:49:22] Amen. And the glory of the Lord rises
[1:49:25] upon you.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's the church that you
[1:49:29] are part of. Not a fallen church, not a
[1:49:32] wretched church, not a blind people, but
[1:49:34] an awakened people. A people who know
[1:49:37] their God and do exploits. A people who
[1:49:40] are called for his name.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; The seventh watch is not a watch of
[1:49:47] despair. It's the watch of transition.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; The very moment. The very moment when
[1:49:55] the dead in Christ shall rise first.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; The living bride shall be changed.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; And the full redemption of the body
[1:50:04] takes place.
[1:50:06] That's the hour that we're living in.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; And friends, all of this happens in your
[1:50:13] age.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; It all happens in the seventh church
[1:50:20] age.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; It's the seventh watch. And we're not
[1:50:24] waiting for another watch.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; The night is almost over.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; And we're not looking for another star.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:35] Oh, there's been a lot of stars out
[1:50:37] there, but they're falling stars and
[1:50:39] they're foaming out their own shame. And
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; you know, this one over here, he's the
[1:50:43] apostle to bring clarity to the message.
[1:50:45] Here, this one over here, he's the
[1:50:46] teacher to to to say what brother
[1:50:48] Brandham couldn't say. And all the we
[1:50:50] we're not looking for another star.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are the final watch of the
[1:50:56] night and the dawn is near.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; Can I say let our hearts be stirred? Let
[1:51:02] every lamp be trimmed for the son of
[1:51:05] righteousness is rising. When Jesus
[1:51:08] comes for his bride, the long night of
[1:51:11] the Gentile church ages end. And the
[1:51:15] times of the Gentiles will be over.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; That's when it will be brought to pass
[1:51:21] the scripture. Let him that is filthy be
[1:51:24] filthy still. Let him that is holy be
[1:51:27] holy still.
[1:51:29] The Gentiles will be locked forever
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; in that state.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; No more grace.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; The gospel turns to the Jews.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you see,
[1:51:44] but you
[1:51:46] are not of the night. You're all
[1:51:49] children of the light
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; and children of the day. We're not the
[1:51:53] night nor of the darkness. So it says,
[1:51:56] "Therefore let us," now here's our admon
[1:51:59] admonition, "let us not sleep as do
[1:52:04] others,
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; but let us watch
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; and be serious,
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; be sober,
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; be sincere,
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; be dedicated,
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; this is the trumpet call to the bride in
[1:52:19] the last hour. We're living in the final
[1:52:22] watch of the night, the last moments
[1:52:25] before the dawning of the eternal day.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; While gross darkness covers the people,
[1:52:32] the bride is not slumbering.
[1:52:36] Oh no, I hope you're not one of those
[1:52:39] that just keeps hitting the alarm clock.
[1:52:42] Shut up. And it'll sound again. Shut up.
[1:52:46] Let me sleep a little longer.
[1:52:50] Reminds me, you know what we do so
[1:52:52] often. You know, we don't want to we
[1:52:55] don't want to hear the alarm. We don't
[1:52:57] want to respond to it.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; We want to sleep on a little longer.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; I wonder how many of you have been
[1:53:05] hitting the alarm.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; Turning off the voice
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; that is calling on awakening.
[1:53:13] It's
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; time, friend, to listen to the voice.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; Get up.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. It'll be too late one day.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; You will miss your hour of visitation.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; You see, the night is filled with
[1:53:28] spiritual slumber. Churches are sleep
[1:53:32] informality.
[1:53:34] Souls are intoxicated by worldliness.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; You know what I'm talking about.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. The hearts are weighed down by
[1:53:42] apathy.
[1:53:44] Sleep has blinded the eyes. It's
[1:53:47] drowsiness making them lukewarm.
[1:53:50] It's the condition of the last age. And
[1:53:53] Jesus warned us of it.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; I want you to see his sobering warning.
[1:54:01] Take heed to yourself lest at any time
[1:54:06] your hearts be overcharged with surfing
[1:54:08] and drunkenness. and cares of this life
[1:54:12] so that they come on you unawares. For
[1:54:15] as a snare shall it come on all them
[1:54:18] that dwell on the face of the whole
[1:54:20] earth.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; These words
[1:54:24] from Jesus are not addressed to the
[1:54:27] world alone. These are words to his
[1:54:29] disciples.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; Notice what he said. Take heed to
[1:54:33] yourselves. He's speaking to his
[1:54:35] disciples. to the church to those who
[1:54:38] profess to follow him. It's a warning of
[1:54:42] spiritual dullness.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; It's a hearts that are weighed down and
[1:54:47] is not necessarily by just sin,
[1:54:52] you know, in its obvious form, but
[1:54:54] excess,
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; distraction,
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; indifference.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; Do you hear me? Amen.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; A great burden, the prophet said, of the
[1:55:06] last age is the pressure of riches,
[1:55:10] self-living and nervous tensions in a
[1:55:13] complex age that we seem unfitted to
[1:55:15] live in.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; You see, in this Leodysian age, this
[1:55:21] scripture right here takes on a very
[1:55:23] piercing re revelance to us because
[1:55:26] Jesus describes Leodysia similar. He
[1:55:29] said, "You're rich. Increase the goods
[1:55:32] have a need of nothing."
[1:55:34] Now, our temptation is different than
[1:55:38] other ages.
[1:55:40] Other ages, you'd proclaim to believe in
[1:55:43] Christ, you would die for it.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; You would be taken to the stake. I mean
[1:55:50] for owning a Bible, for translating the
[1:55:53] Bible,
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; they were burned,
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; killed, tormented, tortured.
[1:56:00] You see, they were tempted by the
[1:56:02] pressures of persecution
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; where they were burned at stake and
[1:56:07] their families tortured and starved and
[1:56:10] they faced hunger and tribulation. They
[1:56:13] literally ran for their lives.
[1:56:17] But this is not where we're tested.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; This is the age where our test is in a
[1:56:25] different area.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; It's the age of excess.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; It's an age of abundance.
[1:56:35] is a age of endless entertainment
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; of information
[1:56:43] and information overload.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; You know how it is.
[1:56:51] You got to know what next thing did
[1:56:53] Trump do?
[1:56:56] What's Israel happening now? What's
[1:56:58] happening there? What's happening the
[1:57:00] the stock? Is it going to crash today?
[1:57:02] What? You know, it's information
[1:57:04] overload. That's
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; And we're caught up.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yet with all, you see, we're we
[1:57:11] we're And then we get self-reliant,
[1:57:15] you know, yet with all this complexity
[1:57:18] and advancement,
[1:57:20] it's really marked by a spiritual
[1:57:22] apathy, a lukewarmness
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; where that the hearts of many are
[1:57:27] overcharged.
[1:57:29] Look at that word, overcharged.
[1:57:33] They are burdened, bloated,
[1:57:36] and dull.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; Pay heed to yourselves.
[1:57:45] This is personal. He didn't say, "Watch
[1:57:48] what the world's doing."
[1:57:50] You watch yourself.
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; He said, "Watch your own heart." In an
[1:57:56] age where everybody is looking outward
[1:57:59] at politics, at news, at social media,
[1:58:01] at global events, the real danger is
[1:58:05] within.
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; The slow hardening,
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; the quiet drifting,
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; the unrecognized wake that settles down
[1:58:16] on the soul.
[1:58:18] And the first thing you know, you're
[1:58:21] overcharged and heavy, drowsy, dulled,
[1:58:26] spiritually dullled.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Brandham said, "Christ the
[1:58:32] mystery. Why do you hunger, church? Why
[1:58:35] do you thirst? It's the father trying to
[1:58:38] reveal these hidden mysteries to you,
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; but you let so many things get it out of
[1:58:44] you.
[1:58:46] And he names all kinds of things that we
[1:58:49] allow.
[1:58:53] Your hearts be overcharged with
[1:58:55] sobriety.
[1:58:57] Surviety means indulgence, gluttony,
[1:59:01] not just with food now, although there's
[1:59:04] plenty of that, but anything that
[1:59:06] satisfies the flesh and numbs the
[1:59:09] spirit.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; This age is is saturated with pleasure.
[1:59:19] Yeah, we, you know, saturated with
[1:59:21] comfort and luxury.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; Even now we we want to go to the best
[1:59:28] camp
[1:59:29] that's got the best facilities
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; because why? We've gotten used to luxury
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; and we let that elevate over spiritual
[1:59:43] things
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; endless options that we have for
[1:59:49] self-satisfaction.
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; Even good things become dangerous when
[1:59:55] they dull the spiritual senses.
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; It's not just evil that overcharges the
[2:00:00] heart. It's excess that does it.
[2:00:06] Let that sink deep in you.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; This is what aligns us with the
[2:00:10] scripture that says lovers of pleasure
[2:00:13] more than lovers of God.
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; You know what? What does that look like
[2:00:17] today? Entertainment
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; instead of prayer.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; Camp meetings for social purposes
[2:00:25] instead of true conc consecration.
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; Emotionalism instead of the Holy Ghost.
[2:00:34] eloquent services and empty altars.
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; And a God who's spoken of but never
[2:00:41] enthroned.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; You see, loving the idea of God
[2:00:49] but not the demands of his word.
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; Loving the blessings but not the
[2:00:55] brokenness.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; They want revival but not repentance.
[2:01:02] They're content with form,
[2:01:04] but the power, the transforming,
[2:01:07] correcting word anointed fire is denied.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; That's the tragedy of Leodysia.
[2:01:15] I'm rich. I'm increased with goods and I
[2:01:17] have need of nothing.
[2:01:20] You see, they're satisfied with their
[2:01:23] buildings,
[2:01:25] their music,
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; their brands.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; I'm in the message. Amen.
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; Or subbrands. I'm in Peruia or I'm in
[2:01:34] Thunders or I'm in
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; Return or I'm in Third Pull or I'm in
[2:01:39] Open the Word.
[2:01:41] I'm And they're satisfied with brands
[2:01:44] and programs.
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; But Christ is on the outside
[2:01:51] knocking,
[2:01:53] not raining.
[2:01:56] You see, that's the condition
[2:02:00] of the Leodysian church.
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; But there's another church in Leodysia.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; And she's not in this darkness.
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. She has revival
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; because of repentance.
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. She has a love for him.
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; Having put away the deeds of evil. Come
[2:02:21] on, somebody. You say, "But I love him."
[2:02:23] Well, then keep his commandments.
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. To you, his commandments are not
[2:02:28] grievious.
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; You love to obey him in his word.
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're not satisfied with just a
[2:02:36] good church.
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; You're not good satisfied with just a
[2:02:40] good preacher in the pulpit.
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. A good sermon now and then.
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; An emotional high. You're not satisfied.
[2:02:48] You There's a deep calling into the
[2:02:50] deep.
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want more, God. I want more.
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; I want to experience you in a greater
[2:02:57] way than I ever had. Don't let this be
[2:02:59] just another servicemen.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; Let this be a time where it's a real
[2:03:06] true meeting where I meet with you
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; and my life is changed in your presence.
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; Overcharged hearts
[2:03:20] weighed down. The heart is heavy, dull,
[2:03:23] sluggish.
[2:03:24] Ah, not because of outright sin. Good
[2:03:27] moral people, nice people, good
[2:03:30] neighbors,
[2:03:32] but too much of everything else.
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; The soul becomes numb and distracted and
[2:03:39] unable to feel the urgency of the hour.
[2:03:42] And I fear more than anything as the
[2:03:45] delay goes along, as men say, the Lord
[2:03:48] delays his coming
[2:03:50] and we're in a time where of waiting, I
[2:03:54] fear more than anything
[2:04:00] that we become numb,
[2:04:04] too interested in
[2:04:07] staying here
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; rather than our eyes on leaving.
[2:04:13] And this is a very spirit that causes
[2:04:17] the foolish virgins to slumber.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; They're drunk on the world.
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; They are and and they're just
[2:04:24] spiritually drowsy
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; and they've become too lazy from the
[2:04:29] comforts and and and from religion
[2:04:31] without power.
[2:04:34] You see, and the Bible said of
[2:04:36] drunkenness and and it's not just
[2:04:38] literal intoxication, but of a stupified
[2:04:42] numbed condition, a soul that is no
[2:04:46] longer alert in Leodosia, where people
[2:04:50] are intoxicated with entertainment and
[2:04:53] drunk on self-love and dull from, listen
[2:04:56] to me now, dull
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; from repeated exposure to truth.
[2:05:03] Amen.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; Without response.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; And when this happens, two things
[2:05:12] happen.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; First, the Holy Ghost becomes grieved.
[2:05:17] And then the conscience becomes seared
[2:05:20] and hardened.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; And first thing you know, conviction is
[2:05:24] hard to find.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; And I want you to hear this.
[2:05:29] It is it is possible to be so saturated
[2:05:35] with religious noise
[2:05:38] that the still small voice of God is
[2:05:41] drowned out
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; and the cares of this life.
[2:05:58] Did you see that?
[2:06:01] Legitimate responsibilities of life,
[2:06:04] work, family, finances can weigh down
[2:06:08] the heart if they're not balanced with
[2:06:10] spiritual priority.
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; Satan doesn't have to make you fall.
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; He don't have to push you out into
[2:06:19] drugs.
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; He don't have to make you commit
[2:06:22] adultery.
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; You see, he only has to make you busy.
[2:06:30] Satan, Satan just chokes out the word,
[2:06:35] not by persecution, but by cares.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; Leodysa is a distracted age. It's It's
[2:06:41] not hostile. It's just indifferent.
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; Kids were It don't care. That's right.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; They're numb.
[2:06:55] And so he says, "So that that day
[2:06:59] come upon you unawares."
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; And this is a tragic results. The coming
[2:07:05] of the Lord catches them off guard.
[2:07:09] And the people who should have known,
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; who saw the signs,
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; were so weighted down, they lost their
[2:07:17] alertness and they quit watching.
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; It didn't come with warning for them.
[2:07:23] And it it came as a a trap, a snare,
[2:07:28] sudden, unexpected, for as a snare shall
[2:07:30] it come on all them that dwell on the
[2:07:32] earth. And let me tell you, this is
[2:07:34] global. This is not just happening here
[2:07:36] in America. This is happening around the
[2:07:38] world.
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; You see, no one is immune to the spirit
[2:07:42] of the age and and the snare is not
[2:07:46] persecution.
[2:07:48] Oh, we we often worried about that.
[2:07:51] &gt;&gt; Get our backpack ready.
[2:07:53] you know, store up some food. We're
[2:07:56] going to be that hunted, persecuted
[2:07:58] little group. The snare is not
[2:08:00] persecution.
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; It's comfort,
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; pleasure, spiritual laziness.
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; The very ease and prosperity of Leodysia
[2:08:10] is the trap.
[2:08:12] And the enemy has disarmed the church,
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; not by fear,
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; but by lulling them to sleep.
[2:08:28] But to the bride,
[2:08:31] Jesus says these words, "Watch."
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; Watch ye therefore and pray always.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; Come on now. That you may be accounted
[2:08:43] worthy.
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, there's somebody going to escape the
[2:08:48] things that are coming on the earth.
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; But How are they going to do it? By
[2:08:52] watchfulness and prayer.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, I tell you, it's time we bring
[2:08:56] prayer back
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; into our lives.
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; Communication with God and fellowship
[2:09:02] with him.
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; That sweet abiding
[2:09:06] at communion.
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, the bride age is not
[2:09:10] about apathy. It's about an awakening.
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; So, I'm in the bride age. Then you're
[2:09:16] awake.
[2:09:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. You you you have you have cast out
[2:09:21] the the the slumber and the works of
[2:09:23] darkness.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; It's a season of vigilance of keeping
[2:09:27] the lamp trim. It's a the the your oil
[2:09:31] is full and the eyes are on the eastern
[2:09:34] sky.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; And I'm speaking spiritually here, not
[2:09:38] literally.
[2:09:41] &gt;&gt; You with me? Amen.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; Because to our eyes beyond the eastern
[2:09:45] skies mean we are looking for his
[2:09:47] coming.
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; We are seeing his glorious appearing.
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are reflecting and receiving
[2:09:53] the light of the morning star.
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; We're walking in truth and in the light
[2:09:58] and there's a flame that's burning high.
[2:10:01] &gt;&gt; And while Leo to see a boast of wealth
[2:10:04] and spiritual bride pride, the the pride
[2:10:07] humbly recognizes the need for Isab.
[2:10:11] Amen.
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; For revelation
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; to see what others can't see.
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; Do you realize you see things others
[2:10:18] cannot see?
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Things are revealed to you that
[2:10:22] others it's never been known to them.
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; You are you have been let in to know the
[2:10:28] mysteries of the kingdom of God where to
[2:10:31] others it's not given.
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; Oh friends, we ought to be on fire then.
[2:10:36] It ought to light our hearts
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; that God has chosen us of all people to
[2:10:42] reveal his truth to us
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; to make known the hidden mysteries.
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh my.
[2:10:52] The bride sees the need for Isab
[2:10:56] revelation to see what others cannot
[2:10:58] see. She hears the knock at the door.
[2:11:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. She opens to him.
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; She feeds at a table
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; that's got a seven course menu.
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; For all the seven seals are open.
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; Come on. Did not he invite us in this
[2:11:18] age. Open the door
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; and I will come in and I will s with
[2:11:23] you.
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen church. He provides
[2:11:28] the bread. He provides the wine. He
[2:11:31] provides the party. He provides it all.
[2:11:34] He's got a whole seven course menu. All
[2:11:36] you got to do is open the door.
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I say open the door. Let him
[2:11:43] in. He wants to bring He wants to suck
[2:11:46] with you. He wants to bring you into
[2:11:48] fellowship.
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; He wants you to bring you into love
[2:11:52] relationship.
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:12:00] She feeds at the table of the seven
[2:12:03] seals eating open book. The revealed
[2:12:07] mystery of Christ
[2:12:09] in an age when the whole world all
[2:12:13] around us is caught in this entire time
[2:12:17] snare.
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; And the devil set it for us.
[2:12:22] But God gave us a way out.
[2:12:24] You're going to escape.
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; Thank you,
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; the snare.
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you this morning, you're
[2:12:32] going to overcome Leodysian spirit.
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; You're going to overcome the
[2:12:37] lukewarmness. It's not going to drag you
[2:12:40] down. No sir, you're going to defeat it.
[2:12:44] You are an overcomer.
[2:12:46] You are not called to defeat. You are
[2:12:48] called to victory.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; Glory to
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; You're called to rise above it. Not live
[2:13:00] entangled in the cares of this life, but
[2:13:03] anchored in the hope of his coming.
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; Have you spiritual appetite for the
[2:13:12] eating of the book?
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; I hope you've been feeding. Have you
[2:13:17] been Have you appetite for the
[2:13:19] previously sealed mystery truths?
[2:13:22] You know, they're not sealed anymore
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; and they're not mysteries anymore.
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; Eating the book
[2:13:32] means taking or receiving
[2:13:36] the full revelation personally.
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; This is what you are commanded to do.
[2:13:43] After the seventh angel sounds,
[2:13:46] you are told to take the book and eat
[2:13:48] it.
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:13:51] I
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; I'm quoting you Revelation 10. You are
[2:13:54] familiar with that, right?
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; So, as you're then then eating eating
[2:13:58] the book means taking and receiving the
[2:14:01] full revelation personally, not not just
[2:14:03] hearing it,
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; but consuming it, digesting it, and then
[2:14:07] becoming one with the word.
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; Let it become an action in your life.
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, it's sweet in the mouth.
[2:14:16] It's full of glory and spiritual delight
[2:14:19] when it's first received, but then it
[2:14:22] becomes bitter in the belly
[2:14:25] because of the responsibility,
[2:14:28] the burden that comes with that
[2:14:30] revelation is heavy
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; and the weight of a divine calling
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; and like rich food. And I'll tell you,
[2:14:40] the food we got is rich. You
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; said, "Brother Tim, sometimes you're
[2:14:45] preaching over my head. I'm trying to
[2:14:47] I'm trying to preach something to you
[2:14:49] for you to reach toward
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; to get out of your shallows. Get out of
[2:14:54] off of the surface, to get down in the
[2:14:56] depths of the word. Go from the surface
[2:14:58] to the depths."
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen. So, I preach
[2:15:02] things to challenge you
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; to believe.
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; To believe for the impossible.
[2:15:08] &gt;&gt; To realize the mysteries are for you.
[2:15:11] Don't sit down and shut you shut down
[2:15:13] your ears and say I'm not going to get
[2:15:15] this. Inspire you.
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; This is the reason it's given to call a
[2:15:20] bride in this last day.
[2:15:23] &gt;&gt; But like rich food, it'll set heavy on
[2:15:26] the stomach.
[2:15:29] &gt;&gt; The depth of the word can just like that
[2:15:33] if it's not rightly handed handled.
[2:15:35] There's too much. Too much without
[2:15:38] action
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; can lead to lethargy
[2:15:42] and to drowsiness.
[2:15:44] It'll cause the soul to slumber.
[2:15:48] &gt;&gt; People get so full. Brother Brandham
[2:15:50] warned us of this.
[2:15:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, he said he he even he
[2:15:56] even said uh to to the the time that he
[2:15:59] saw so many miracles
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; that he said it was like a baby there.
[2:16:05] that was he he heard about in the store.
[2:16:07] Maybe he saw it. Whichever one, I don't
[2:16:10] remember the details exactly clearly,
[2:16:11] but he saw talked about a baby in the
[2:16:14] store and the mother was going to the
[2:16:16] store and she was rattling keys and
[2:16:19] rattling bells and and trying to show it
[2:16:22] things and and all of a sudden it's
[2:16:25] dawning on her said, you know, I I I my
[2:16:29] my child, there's something wrong with
[2:16:31] it. I show it things that ought to
[2:16:33] attract a little baby like this. But he
[2:16:36] just stares in space. And he said, "God
[2:16:39] has done so much
[2:16:42] &gt;&gt; in this generation until people stare in
[2:16:45] space.
[2:16:47] &gt;&gt; No longer attracted
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; by the things of God."
[2:16:55] So watch what he says.
[2:17:00] We need an awakening,
[2:17:03] &gt;&gt; a realization of where we are in this
[2:17:05] hour.
[2:17:07] Because you can get the rich food of the
[2:17:09] word and if it's not rightly handled
[2:17:14] too much without action, it causes leth
[2:17:18] lethargy and drowsiness and the soul to
[2:17:22] slumber. You know how it is. You've ate
[2:17:26] and it's heavy on your stomach.
[2:17:28] I got to get up and walk around a bit.
[2:17:31] &gt;&gt; I've ate too much. Maybe that's why you
[2:17:33] hit for the door so often during church.
[2:17:40] &gt;&gt; But nevertheless,
[2:17:44] that was free.
[2:17:47] &gt;&gt; Take it or leave it. But nevertheless,
[2:17:50] you know, it gets to the point where
[2:17:53] this is a danger when the church feasts
[2:17:55] on revelation
[2:17:58] but then fails to prophesy again.
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:18:04] &gt;&gt; The true revelation has to live.
[2:18:08] &gt;&gt; Come on. It has to stimulate. It has to
[2:18:11] put you into action.
[2:18:13] too full, too satisfied, too content to
[2:18:16] move, to indulge with the knowledge of
[2:18:19] the revelation without putting into
[2:18:21] action. And faith without works, without
[2:18:23] action is dead.
[2:18:25] &gt;&gt; And just as natural food makes one
[2:18:27] sleepy, rich revelation without
[2:18:30] obedience can dull the senses and
[2:18:34] silence the commission.
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; But the instruction is clear. We have
[2:18:42] been told to prophesy again.
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; Remember Leoa,
[2:18:48] you're not talking for me.
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; I'll spew it out of my mouth.
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; You no longer speak for me.
[2:18:56] &gt;&gt; But then to a bride, he gives a book and
[2:18:59] that book is unsealed. It is open. And
[2:19:01] he says, "So you speak
[2:19:06] &gt;&gt; prophesy.
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; Prophesy, son of man. Amen. These bones
[2:19:11] shall live. Prophesy the wind will come.
[2:19:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The bride in this final
[2:19:18] prophecy, she'll have the wind of the
[2:19:20] spirit.
[2:19:21] &gt;&gt; There will be bones come together. Amen.
[2:19:24] Those dead men will live again.
[2:19:27] &gt;&gt; Are you with me, church? People that's
[2:19:29] been asleeping dead in the pew for years
[2:19:31] and years and years will rise. Why?
[2:19:33] Because the bride will prophesy again.
[2:19:37] Amen.
[2:19:39] &gt;&gt; I tell you, be part of the prophecy.
[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't just eat the book. Be part
[2:19:44] of the prophecy.
[2:19:46] &gt;&gt; Let it speak out of your life. Let it
[2:19:48] speak boldness. Let it speak holiness.
[2:19:51] Let it speak the joy of the Lord. Let it
[2:19:53] speak the shout of the king. Let it
[2:19:55] speak with dance with with a praise,
[2:19:58] with worship. Let it speak.
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; I say, let it speak. Oh, little pride.
[2:20:04] Let it speak.
[2:20:07] We have hate it. We have consumed it.
[2:20:10] Now speak it.
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:16] &gt;&gt; You must speak. You must declare. You
[2:20:19] must act.
[2:20:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, Brother Tim, I'm
[2:20:25] receiving the word. My loved ones coming
[2:20:27] back." Then speak it.
[2:20:30] &gt;&gt; Quit talking the negative stuff. Quit
[2:20:32] looking at the darkness. You are the
[2:20:34] light. Be the light.
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; Shine the light.
[2:20:38] &gt;&gt; Speak it.
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; My child is coming home.
[2:20:43] &gt;&gt; My loved ones are going to be saved.
[2:20:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. I've got enough of the lamb. I've
[2:20:49] got a big lamb in my house.
[2:20:51] &gt;&gt; I've got enough lamb for my children.
[2:20:53] I've got enough lamb for my
[2:20:55] grandchildren. Amen. And here in this
[2:20:57] time of darkness, when there's a knock
[2:20:59] on the door, I know they're coming home.
[2:21:03] I'm about to hear sis come in the door
[2:21:05] and say, "I come home, mama. I've come
[2:21:08] home, daddy. I've come home to eat the
[2:21:10] lamb."
[2:21:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, sis, you can't come in like there
[2:21:16] you are. Like you're dressed. That's all
[2:21:18] right. I'll put off those works of
[2:21:20] darkness.
[2:21:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll put that off. Amen. Oh, the
[2:21:25] taskmaster of sin took me out. And
[2:21:27] there, while he had me out there, he
[2:21:30] took and cut off my hair and painted my
[2:21:32] face, made me live like a and
[2:21:35] dressed like a harlot.
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; But oh, I've come home, mama. I'm
[2:21:38] knocking on the door.
[2:21:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. I'm coming under the
[2:21:44] token. I'm coming back home. What about
[2:21:46] that boy? I've been in drugs. I've been
[2:21:48] in alcohol. I've been in tobacco. But
[2:21:50] I'm coming home. I tell you, it's home
[2:21:53] time and come.
[2:21:54] It's home timing. Coming time right now.
[2:21:58] He's timing.
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; He's appearing among us. He's healing
[2:22:02] the sick. He's casting out devils. He's
[2:22:05] saving the lost. He's moving in his
[2:22:08] church.
[2:22:12] &gt;&gt; And there's a bride under the token.
[2:22:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh yeah.
[2:22:19] &gt;&gt; The very purpose of consuming the book
[2:22:22] is that the bride might be the voice of
[2:22:25] the bridegroom.
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; There's somebody living that must call
[2:22:30] the dead.
[2:22:34] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Exactly right. The first that
[2:22:37] went down will be the last to come up.
[2:22:40] &gt;&gt; The la the first church age will be the
[2:22:42] last to rise. And the last church age
[2:22:44] will be the first to rise. And the last
[2:22:47] that we buried will be the first that
[2:22:48] comes up.
[2:22:50] [Applause]
[2:22:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it'll be you, the
[2:22:55] bride's voice, that calls the
[2:22:57] resurrection.
[2:22:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't mean you out here waving a
[2:23:01] wor
[2:23:03] some kind of wand in a graveyard. That's
[2:23:05] not what I'm talking about. I'm talking
[2:23:07] about your life matching the word of the
[2:23:10] hour and being a voice in this
[2:23:12] generation. And when he lives out his
[2:23:15] voice in full boldness and upright, the
[2:23:18] dead in Christ will start appearing
[2:23:19] among us. Oh, I'm looking for that
[2:23:23] appearing.
[2:23:24] &gt;&gt; I'm looking for that appearing even this
[2:23:26] morning. May he appear among us
[2:23:29] &gt;&gt; in his power and his glory
[2:23:32] &gt;&gt; and bring the saints with him.
[2:23:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:41] The revelation must be a living
[2:23:42] prophecy.
[2:23:44] We're not called to be spiritually
[2:23:46] bloated with knowledge.
[2:23:48] We're called to be voices,
[2:23:51] &gt;&gt; to prophesy again,
[2:23:55] &gt;&gt; like the first church did,
[2:23:58] saying what the messenger of this age
[2:24:00] said, declaring it before many people's
[2:24:04] nation, tongues, and kings.
[2:24:06] The bride has eaten the book.
[2:24:10] She has received the mysteries.
[2:24:14] Have you done it?
[2:24:16] &gt;&gt; How many have embraced them?
[2:24:18] &gt;&gt; How many loves these mystery truths?
[2:24:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. We've received them. But now you
[2:24:24] must move. You must speak. You must
[2:24:26] shine. You must warn. The sweetness,
[2:24:30] the sweetness that you taste must become
[2:24:34] a voice, a witness.
[2:24:38] &gt;&gt; The heaviness
[2:24:40] must become a holy burden
[2:24:44] &gt;&gt; to put the word in action.
[2:24:48] as he said to Ezekiel, "Son of man, eat
[2:24:52] this roll and go and speak."
[2:24:56] To eat and not prophesy is to fall
[2:24:59] asleep under the weight of the
[2:25:00] revelation.
[2:25:02] &gt;&gt; But to eat and rise again with fire in
[2:25:04] your bones is the call of this hour.
[2:25:08] &gt;&gt; The bride must not be found resting in
[2:25:11] truth, but running with it.
[2:25:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is your time to run.
[2:25:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. The more light you receive, the
[2:25:21] more responsible you are to walk in it
[2:25:24] and speak it. Thou must prophesy.
[2:25:28] &gt;&gt; Thou must speak the word. This is our
[2:25:30] commission since Leodysa spewed out of
[2:25:32] his mouth. We've been given a word and
[2:25:35] we're to digest it and speak it.
[2:25:37] Proclaim it. Then let it live.
[2:25:40] &gt;&gt; I say let it live.
[2:25:43] &gt;&gt; I say let it live. It'll cast out
[2:25:45] devils.
[2:25:47] &gt;&gt; It'll cast out the drugs, the alcohol,
[2:25:49] the tobacco. It'll cast out the
[2:25:51] distorted life and the adulterous
[2:25:53] spirit. It'll cast out the spirits of
[2:25:56] fornication and pornography. It'll heal
[2:25:58] all the sick.
[2:26:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. It will fill with power. It will
[2:26:03] transform lives.
[2:26:04] &gt;&gt; It will seal unto the day of redemption.
[2:26:08] And it will keep you in the hour of
[2:26:10] temptation.
[2:26:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:14] Like the prophet Jeremiah said,
[2:26:17] you remember Jeremiah,
[2:26:19] he grew weary and sometimes we grow
[2:26:22] weary.
[2:26:24] &gt;&gt; And I'm telling you, I've preached for
[2:26:26] now 55 years and sometimes I feel
[2:26:30] weariness.
[2:26:32] We may grow weary and we may even want
[2:26:36] to stay silent.
[2:26:38] And to be honest with you, I've wrestled
[2:26:41] all week on this sermon
[2:26:46] because sometimes things aren't easy to
[2:26:49] preach.
[2:26:53] So we may grow weary. We may even want
[2:26:56] to stay silent.
[2:26:58] But this word that I've eaten, it's too
[2:27:01] alive.
[2:27:02] &gt;&gt; It's too powerful,
[2:27:04] &gt;&gt; too burning to keep inside. Amen.
[2:27:06] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Jeremiah said his
[2:27:09] word was in mine heart as a burning fire
[2:27:12] shot up in my bones and I was weary with
[2:27:15] forbearing and I could not stay. He said
[2:27:19] I got tired of trying to keep it quiet.
[2:27:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the way I feel this
[2:27:24] morning. I'm tired of being quiet.
[2:27:27] &gt;&gt; It's time to be the voice.
[2:27:29] &gt;&gt; It's time to speak. You say we believe
[2:27:32] in the third pull. Well, then speak.
[2:27:35] It's the hour to speak to your mountain.
[2:27:37] Your mountain must hear your voice.
[2:27:44] &gt;&gt; That's the testimony of the bride in
[2:27:45] this hour. She's eaten the book. She's
[2:27:47] received the revelation. And now it's
[2:27:51] fire in her bones.
[2:27:55] &gt;&gt; We cannot remain silent.
[2:27:57] We burn with a holy fire. Consumed by
[2:28:01] the word, compelled to speak. Listen to
[2:28:04] me now. We're in an age where it's risen
[2:28:08] of so much. And what what gives that
[2:28:11] rise to hoarders?
[2:28:16] &gt;&gt; Hoarders.
[2:28:18] &gt;&gt; Some of you are hoarders.
[2:28:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You got one, two, three. I mean,
[2:28:24] you can't even keep all the stuff you
[2:28:25] got in your house.
[2:28:26] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[2:28:28] you you've had to rent all these rental
[2:28:31] buildings and everything else because
[2:28:33] you're harder.
[2:28:38] &gt;&gt; And all it's doing is costing you money.
[2:28:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, it ain't doing you one bit of good
[2:28:44] &gt;&gt; and you just keep paying the bill on it.
[2:28:48] &gt;&gt; You're hoarders. Uh, you know, some
[2:28:50] people gets to be so hoarders that they
[2:28:52] can't even they they there's even just a
[2:28:54] little trail that they get
[2:28:56] &gt;&gt; right down through their house.
[2:28:58] &gt;&gt; They live in that kind of filth.
[2:29:01] &gt;&gt; But let me just tell you, this bride is
[2:29:04] not called to be a hoarder of
[2:29:06] revelation,
[2:29:08] &gt;&gt; but a voice to this generation.
[2:29:10] &gt;&gt; The spirit and the bride must work in
[2:29:13] unison. What she is eaten, she must now
[2:29:16] speak. What is burned in her bone now
[2:29:19] must blaze from her lips.
[2:29:22] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[2:29:24] &gt;&gt; It don't do any good just to keep it
[2:29:26] down in here. It's got to come out of
[2:29:28] your mouth. It's got to be an action in
[2:29:30] your life. It's not It is not the hour
[2:29:33] to fall asleep at the table. That's
[2:29:35] right.
[2:29:37] &gt;&gt; How many times have we seen pictures and
[2:29:39] little videos of babies sitting there
[2:29:41] and they get full and and first thing
[2:29:44] you know they're laying down right in
[2:29:46] their plate of food.
[2:29:48] &gt;&gt; It's their sleep at the table.
[2:29:51] &gt;&gt; This is not a time to sleep at the
[2:29:53] table.
[2:29:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:54] &gt;&gt; It's the hour to rise from it.
[2:29:56] Empowered, instructed, and on fire.
[2:29:59] &gt;&gt; The book is now open.
[2:30:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:02] &gt;&gt; Every promise is yours.
[2:30:07] Come on, church. Amen. When when Abraham
[2:30:10] was given a land and he said, "Here's a
[2:30:12] border." He went around from place to
[2:30:14] place to place to place. What was he
[2:30:16] doing? He was walking in every place and
[2:30:18] claiming that place as his own.
[2:30:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:22] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, you the book is open.
[2:30:25] You can walk. Go claim your divine
[2:30:27] healing. Go claim your lost loved one.
[2:30:29] Claim salvation for your family. Claim
[2:30:32] Come on. Walk through the land. Amen.
[2:30:34] You'll barely see what's in the book.
[2:30:38] &gt;&gt; Discover it.
[2:30:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:30:42] &gt;&gt; And expand your borders.
[2:30:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:47] &gt;&gt; Expand your borders. You've been where
[2:30:50] you are too long.
[2:30:52] &gt;&gt; You need some elbow room.
[2:30:56] &gt;&gt; We had to do that here at Evening Light.
[2:30:58] We had a place that were in the country
[2:31:00] I was satisfied with. I was happy with
[2:31:02] it, but it got where, you know, uh we we
[2:31:05] were landlocked. We couldn't expand.
[2:31:10] &gt;&gt; We couldn't fit in that building today.
[2:31:13] &gt;&gt; Why? We had to expand our borders.
[2:31:16] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to tell you, God's wanting
[2:31:18] you to have more than what you've had.
[2:31:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not the hour to fall asleep
[2:31:23] at the table. is the hour to rise from
[2:31:25] an empowered instruction on fire because
[2:31:28] the word the book is open and the word
[2:31:31] must be eaten and now the bride must
[2:31:35] prophesy again.
[2:31:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:37] &gt;&gt; I'm going to try to bring this down real
[2:31:38] close. But we you see, but we're not of
[2:31:42] that order.
[2:31:44] &gt;&gt; We are of the day.
[2:31:46] &gt;&gt; We belong to the light.
[2:31:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. I know some of you as I preached
[2:31:53] it just got droopier and droopier and
[2:31:55] droopier and droopier. Now I'm trying to
[2:31:58] get you back up.
[2:32:00] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to point you to what we where
[2:32:02] we are. We're not of the false vine.
[2:32:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:32:05] &gt;&gt; We've been warned and we have taken heed
[2:32:08] to ourselves.
[2:32:10] &gt;&gt; We have listened for the bridegroom
[2:32:12] call. We have been awakened.
[2:32:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. We belong to the day.
[2:32:19] We belong to the light. That's right.
[2:32:21] &gt;&gt; The bridegroom call has wakened us out
[2:32:24] of religious sleep
[2:32:26] &gt;&gt; and said, "Go you out to meet him.
[2:32:30] &gt;&gt; Leave the world behind. Trim your
[2:32:33] lamps." They make them burn bright.
[2:32:37] &gt;&gt; And the Bible said, "And then all those
[2:32:39] virgins arose and trimmed their lamps."
[2:32:43] &gt;&gt; Now, you see, in ancient times, oil
[2:32:46] lamps had a wick that had to be trimmed
[2:32:48] regularly.
[2:32:50] So the flame could burn clear and
[2:32:52] strong,
[2:32:54] not dim or smoky.
[2:32:57] A neglected wick would flicker. It would
[2:33:01] smoke and yeah, it'd eventually go out.
[2:33:06] even if there was still oil in the lamp.
[2:33:10] And just like
[2:33:13] trimming that charred part of the wick,
[2:33:17] &gt;&gt; the wise virgins cut away the flesh
[2:33:21] to burn out remnants of yesterday's
[2:33:23] fire.
[2:33:26] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[2:33:28] &gt;&gt; That's something you need to do today.
[2:33:30] Trim those burnout remnants of
[2:33:34] yesterday's fire off.
[2:33:37] &gt;&gt; It's time for a bright shining light.
[2:33:40] &gt;&gt; You can't live on the remnants of
[2:33:43] yesterday's revival.
[2:33:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:33:46] &gt;&gt; Charred beliefs of the past burn over
[2:33:49] stumps must be cut off. Amen.
[2:33:53] &gt;&gt; You can't rely on past experiences or
[2:33:56] emotions,
[2:33:57] &gt;&gt; but you must daily examine your lives.
[2:34:03] &gt;&gt; Repented and remove everything and
[2:34:07] anything that would hinder the
[2:34:08] brightness of the flame. The Bible said
[2:34:12] in in Corinthians, he said, "Let us
[2:34:14] cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of
[2:34:17] the flesh and spirit, perfecting
[2:34:20] holiness in the fear of of God." I want
[2:34:23] the musicians to come.
[2:34:27] I don't know, maybe you can
[2:34:30] play that song. How long has it been? I
[2:34:32] just feel to play that this morning.
[2:34:35] You see, the flame
[2:34:38] must be maintained.
[2:34:40] The revelation
[2:34:42] kept alive.
[2:34:45] A trim wick burns better when there's
[2:34:48] fresh oil.
[2:34:51] &gt;&gt; The wise virgins had oil in their
[2:34:54] vessels with their lamps.
[2:34:56] The Bible said the wise also took oil in
[2:35:00] their jars with their lamps. You see,
[2:35:03] they had a refilling coming.
[2:35:08] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to tell you this morning,
[2:35:09] even in your life,
[2:35:11] &gt;&gt; wherever you are, and I'm even talking
[2:35:15] to myself,
[2:35:18] there's a refilling for you. Amen.
[2:35:22] [Music]
[2:35:26] [Applause]
[2:35:29] [Music]
[2:35:31] &gt;&gt; The wise virgins maintain their walk in
[2:35:34] the word and in the spirit.
[2:35:37] They're not content
[2:35:39] with formal religion,
[2:35:42] but they're feeding on present truth.
[2:35:46] They're keeping their understanding
[2:35:48] clear and their hearts burning.
[2:35:53] The word is a lamp unto their feet and a
[2:35:57] light to their path.
[2:36:00] [Music]
[2:36:03] Don't be drunk with wine, which is
[2:36:06] excess,
[2:36:07] &gt;&gt; but be filled with the spirit.
[2:36:13] Trimming the lamp was a sign of
[2:36:15] watchfulness, readiness.
[2:36:19] The foolish virgins had oil at one time,
[2:36:22] but they had neglected their lamps.
[2:36:28] The little splash of baptism they
[2:36:30] received at a at a camp meeting
[2:36:33] wasn't enough
[2:36:36] because they never got connected with
[2:36:38] the source of life.
[2:36:41] [Music]
[2:36:46] You can come here today and get a real
[2:36:48] high in this service,
[2:36:51] but it's not enough
[2:36:53] &gt;&gt; unless you get connected.
[2:37:00] &gt;&gt; Connected to the source of life.
[2:37:04] You see, they become satisfied where
[2:37:06] they are we're at.
[2:37:08] They let their experience
[2:37:10] burn low,
[2:37:13] but the wise knew the hour was late,
[2:37:17] and they stayed vigilant.
[2:37:20] And the Bible said, "Blessed is the
[2:37:22] servant whom the Lord when he cometh
[2:37:26] shall find doing so."
[2:37:29] She's prepared.
[2:37:31] [Music]
[2:37:33] The trimming of the lamp represents the
[2:37:36] final preparation of the bride before
[2:37:38] the coming of the bridegroom.
[2:37:40] I wonder, could you trim yours this
[2:37:42] morning?
[2:37:49] Could you trim yours?
[2:37:51] Does your lamp need something trimmed
[2:37:54] off?
[2:37:58] Is there something you could surrender?
[2:38:01] [Music]
[2:38:08] It's the time where ever predestinated
[2:38:11] soul is called to cast off the dead
[2:38:16] works.
[2:38:17] Fill their vessels with the oil of the
[2:38:19] spirit
[2:38:21] to keep that flame of revelation and
[2:38:24] love burning bright. This is not the
[2:38:27] hour to coast or to sleep a rest on your
[2:38:31] past reputation.
[2:38:33] It's the hour of watching and trimming.
[2:38:40] Behold, the bridegroom cometh.
[2:38:43] That's his call this morning.
[2:38:45] [Music]
[2:38:47] &gt;&gt; Those that had oil
[2:38:50] rose up and trimmed their lamps, made
[2:38:52] themselves ready.
[2:38:55] Well, I'm one. Brother Tim's got oil.
[2:38:58] I've got the Holy Ghost.
[2:39:01] They're the ones who rose up and trimmed
[2:39:04] their lamps
[2:39:07] &gt;&gt; and got a refilling.
[2:39:11] The others, the oil had run out.
[2:39:16] You see, they had got just some little
[2:39:19] Pentecostal shout or dance or camp
[2:39:21] meeting high.
[2:39:25] and it didn't last.
[2:39:28] But those who really had oil in their
[2:39:31] vessels,
[2:39:33] they had a refilling coming.
[2:39:40] &gt;&gt; How many can say, "I have the Holy
[2:39:42] Ghost. I have oil in my lamp."
[2:39:46] &gt;&gt; You're blessed
[2:39:48] &gt;&gt; because you have a refilling coming.
[2:39:53] [Music]
[2:40:00] You can experience him in a great and
[2:40:03] greater living way
[2:40:05] &gt;&gt; than what you ever have.
[2:40:12] The danger of this hour
[2:40:14] is not just deception
[2:40:17] but spiritual drowsiness.
[2:40:20] Too many are asleep with their open
[2:40:22] Bible,
[2:40:24] asleep with
[2:40:27] full tape libraries
[2:40:30] and other message paraphernelia,
[2:40:32] sleep in churches,
[2:40:36] even sleep under sound preaching.
[2:40:39] And they're lulled into comfort,
[2:40:42] unaware that the harvest isn't ripe and
[2:40:44] the judge is at the door.
[2:40:50] Let him deal with your heart this
[2:40:52] morning.
[2:40:54] How long
[2:40:57] has it been
[2:40:59] since you
[2:41:05] soul
[2:41:07] in your heart
[2:41:10] in secret?
[2:41:14] How long
[2:41:17] since you prayed?
[2:41:20] How long since you stayed
[2:41:24] on your knees
[2:41:27] till the light

[2:41:34] How long

[2:41:41] felt steady?
[2:41:44] How long

[2:41:54] Can you call
[2:41:56] him your friend?

[2:42:03] since you knew
[2:42:06] &gt;&gt; that he came?

[2:42:14] &gt;&gt; How long
[2:42:16] has it been?
[2:42:18] Since you saw
[2:42:21] with the Lord, maybe you just want to
[2:42:22] get up out of your seat.
[2:42:26] &gt;&gt; Your heart
[2:42:28] didn't see.
[2:42:29] &gt;&gt; Just say, "Lord, here I am."
[2:42:33] How long
[2:42:36] since you separate?
[2:42:38] How long
[2:42:40] since you stay
[2:42:43] &gt;&gt; on your knees
[2:42:45] till the light
[2:42:48] shone through?
[2:42:52] How long

[2:42:57] since your mind
[2:42:59] felt at ease?
[2:43:02] How long
[2:43:04] your heart knew no burden?
[2:43:11] Can you call
[2:43:14] him your friend?

[2:43:50] How long
[2:43:52] since you knew

[2:43:57] answer you?
[2:44:00] and
[2:44:01] &gt;&gt; they want to dedicate their lives to
[2:44:02] him.
[2:44:04] &gt;&gt; They want to make a full surrender.
[2:44:08] &gt;&gt; May it be God
[2:44:10] &gt;&gt; today in the name of Jesus.
[2:44:12] &gt;&gt; Has it been
[2:44:14] since you woke
[2:44:17] with the dawn
[2:44:19] and felt
[2:44:21] that the day
[2:44:24] is worth living?

[2:44:39] You knew
[2:44:41] he cared
[2:44:43] for
[2:44:46] your children. We have dedicated our
[2:44:50] [Music]
[2:44:54] glory
[2:44:56] &gt;&gt; with the Lord.

[3:02:24] [Music]
[3:02:32] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[3:02:34] [Music]
[3:02:54] Amen.
[3:02:57] Amen.
[3:03:00] God bless you. We we come this afternoon
[3:03:04] with our with our brother Luke and he
[3:03:06] he's informed me that he is 10 years old
[3:03:09] and I said that's a perfect age to be
[3:03:11] giving your life to Jesus. You know, we
[3:03:14] encourage young young people to give
[3:03:16] their heart to the Lord as as soon as
[3:03:18] possible before the enemy can come and
[3:03:20] get a hold of it and scar it up. And you
[3:03:23] know, the scripture even tells us Jesus
[3:03:25] said, you know, to forbid not the little
[3:03:27] ones to come unto me. Let them come. If
[3:03:29] they want to come, we don't want to
[3:03:31] hinder it. We want to encourage it and
[3:03:32] say, "Give your heart to Jesus." Amen.
[3:03:35] And and so he's done that. He he's he's
[3:03:38] repented and he said, "I've given my
[3:03:39] life to Jesus." And we believe we
[3:03:42] believe that the Lord is going to come
[3:03:44] and be in his heart and be in his life
[3:03:46] and go with him all the days of his
[3:03:48] life. We're not just doing this out of a
[3:03:50] tradition, but we have a promise.
[3:03:52] &gt;&gt; And we believe that the Lord's going to
[3:03:54] watch over him all the days of his life.
[3:03:57] Amen.
[3:03:58] &gt;&gt; So, so my brother Luke, we're going to
[3:04:00] put your hands right up here. There you
[3:04:02] go. You know the drill. Good job, buddy.
[3:04:06] The Lord sent me into the world and he
[3:04:08] and he told me to baptize those that
[3:04:11] believe in the name of the Father and of
[3:04:13] the Son and of the Holy Spirit. And in
[3:04:16] obedience to that divine command, I
[3:04:19] baptize you in the name of the Lord
[3:04:20] Jesus Christ.
[3:04:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:04:32] To be in the house of the Lord today.
[3:04:35] Amen. Well, as our brother Andrew leaves
[3:04:37] us in another song of worship, you can
[3:04:39] consider yourself dismissed. We love
[3:04:42] you. God bless you.
[3:04:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, these are the days of Elijah
[3:04:50] declaring the word of the Lord.
[3:04:54] [Music]
[3:04:56] And these are the days of the seven
[3:05:00] angel righteousness being restored.
[3:05:06] And though these are days of great
[3:05:10] trials,
[3:05:12] of famine and darkness and sorrow.
[3:05:17] Till we are the voice in the desert
[3:05:22] crying, prepare ye the way of the Lord.
[3:05:27] Behold, he comes
[3:05:30] riding on a cloud. Shining like the sun
[3:05:36] at the trumpet sound.
[3:05:38] Lift your voice is the year of jubilee.
[3:05:44] out of sight until salvation
[3:05:48] come.
[3:05:49] [Music]
[3:05:51] These are the days of a single
[3:05:56] trials becoming.
[3:06:02] These are the days of your servant David
[3:06:07] rebuilding the temple of grace.
[3:06:12] And those are the days of the harvest.
[3:06:18] The filling wide by your word.
[3:06:23] And we are the laborers in your venure.
[3:06:30] The word of the Lord. Behold, he comes
[3:06:36] riding on a cloud, shining like the sun.
[3:06:42] at the drunken sound. Lift your voice.
[3:06:47] The year of jubilee
[3:06:50] and out of silence till salvation
[3:06:54] come.
[3:06:55] [Music]
[3:06:57] There's no God like Jehovah. There's no
[3:07:01] God like Jehovah. There's no God like
[3:07:04] Jehovah.
[3:07:06] There's no God like
[3:07:08] There's no God like Jehovah.
[3:07:11] There's no God like Jehovah. There's no
[3:07:15] God like the whole
[3:07:21] riding on the cloud.
[3:07:23] Shining like the sun
[3:07:26] at the trumpet sound.
[3:07:29] Lift your voice.
[3:07:32] Hear our jubilee
[3:07:34] out of sight. God bless you.
[3:07:40] Behold, he comes
[3:07:43] riding on the cloud,
[3:07:46] shining like the sun.
[3:07:48] At the trumpet sound,
[3:07:51] lift your voice. It's the year of
[3:07:55] jubilee.
[3:07:57] Out of science till salvation
[3:08:02] [Music]
