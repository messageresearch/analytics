all things are possible to them that believe a man let's let him speak to our hearts today and reveal himself to us father were your children how we feel your presence this morning Oh God the winds of the Holy Spirit rippln out to the wings and the feathers of your illegal it's sitting out there on there over on the branches somewhere Oh God let me just move a little greater let me lift out their wings and take a jump into the moving of the Holy Spirit may this be a moment Lord they are lifted up above all the shadows of doubt fear and unbelief and they concede herself in the promise of Jesus I prayed that you bring healing and deliverance in your name that mighty name of Jesus that the name of Jesus every knee has to bow and every tongue confess Lord we believe you today we look right now into a perfect man perfect woman a healed man healed woman we take a step toward that we take a step toward what you thought of us you didn't think of a sick and crippled and weary and full of doubts and fears believe you you saw us overcoming you saw us shouting in victory you saw us with joy in our hearts because we can declare our enemy is dead that man that we have risen up above the fears in the darkness of the world I pray God you speak today now Lord anoint my lips I to stand here Lord feeling this full spirit Oh God want to move right into that channel now moving to by the winds so the Holy Spirit lifted but not my own power but your power use the speed Lord reveal yourself I pray in Jesus name thank you lord amen amen god bless you and it good to be in the house of the Lord amen well you seem to be getting a little bit comfortable there Amen able to enter in not feeling all uptight and hey man it's good to be in the house of the Lord and be able to fellowship with God and with his people and knowing that um he said he would be here in our midst today and so we're just looking to him to speak to hearts and lives and let him speak to your heart hey man god bless you Philippians chapter 2 and verse 5 and I just want you as you turn to this scripture once again I want to you to let the Holy Spirit really speak to your heart today you just to pray Lord will you just speak to me in a very very real and living way Lord uh not my faith anoint my heart to believe dissolve ever doubt and remove all confusion let me see perfectly what your wheel is for me in my life and I can take my position in the scripture in the Word of God a man's of today we want to just put our home everything into this you know we you know it's it's we've come together to make him welcome to honor him to wash his feet and then to do him a service and you do him a service by in turn and and by worshiping him and and give an honor to his words so Philippians 2 and 5 let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God that made himself of no reputation took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in the fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient to death even the death of the cross a man god bless you can be seated a man I don't know if you realize the depth of this text this morning but I hope that when we leave from here today that we have realized the depth of this text and understand a little more about what Paul said when he said let the mind that was in Christ being you and knowing that if that mind comes in us then it changes our character we have become sons by having the mind of Christ which is this character because your mind actually makes your character the things you think upon and and the things that you believe I'd like to look at Colossians chapter 3 and verse 9 for another scripture reading this morning from which we were taking our text and taking this further and he says you put off the old man with his deeds and I put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him and then once again of Romans chapter 12 and verse 2 and be not conformed to this world do not pattern like the world but be you transformed and that word transformed as Metamorpho from which we get the word a word metamorphosis where is a change is like the changing of an amphibian for example of frog will would change from being a water dwelling animal born in the water breathing the air in the water and he will change to becoming an animal that can come out on the land and breathe the error of the land so it's a metamorphosis that he goes through same thing with a caterpillar you know that changes into a beautiful butterfly it goes through a metamorphose a change same thing happens to you we are changed from glory to glory as we behold the word so he says be not conformed to this world don't pattern like the world maybe he transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove that which is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God so again the mind of the renewed mind proves the will of God it goes to manifest God's will again we are renewed in the knowledge of after the image of him that created us and then Ephesians 4:22 that you put off concerning the former conversation or the manner of life the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust and which and be renewed in the spirit or the attitude of your mind notice again a renewed mind and that you put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness so again we are seeing a creation in the image of God because this is what the new birth does it it creates us in God's image so again the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the mind of Christ how many has received the Holy Ghost in your life all right then you have received the mind of Christ and that mind of Christ it molds your character it causes you to believe and so then we then we find it finally I want to use this scripture here 1st Corinthians 2:16 for who has known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ so again Paul is saying we have that mind and that mind then comes through that new birth experience that gives us the mind of Christ so let this mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus and of course then that that means centers where looking at this he humbled himself to become a man now we in turn have taken the exalted thoughts of man and who we think we are as human beings and we are humbling ourselves to reach something higher which is God because it's really higher a man but man has made his self exalted his self above everything that is called God but God is calling you now to to be lifted up above everything of man into the thinking of God a man for you to realize it's it's not a robbery to be a son of God and man to me to become his child to be his offspring to be of his species to be of his kind so if we have the mind of Christ and we're going to have the same attitude toward the word that he did and Jesus did not use his own reasoning to defeat the devil he put down his own human thoughts and he took the father's word a man and he stayed with the father's word this was his mind no matter what the VIS no matter what his father's word would take preeminence right when he met the devil it was not his own power nor his gifts that he used to defeat the devil he used the mind of God the word the word will defeat the devil anywhere any place any time because it is the mind of God and the mind of God is higher than the thinking of man and it is higher than than than anything that that arm that Satan can exalt it is higher than anything the mind of Christ is the greatest level of intelligence that there he is that's why we've spent a little time last sweet just talking about you may have your PhD you have your learning as a man but it is miniscule compared to the knowledge of God that at least in the kingdom of God is a with the mind of Christ the baptism of the Holy Ghost has a higher intelligence than what anything the world or man can produce so now so again the mind of Christ be with you what kind of mind that that he have he had a mind to stay with the world the fathers were defeated the enemy every time a man so when the enemy attacks and reasons what are you going to do hey man if you're born again you must stay with the word because again we are in a day an hour where the mind of man is exalted a man but we are we are saying we're putting down our own mind and I don't think and to receive his thinking now the mind of Christ is the supernatural so the supernatural is super over natural so whatever you have in the natural of man this is super or it's higher it's a greater than the natural are you with me and brother Maddon told us in the seventh seal he said when the supernatural comes in that's the mind of Christ a man so so again that's the message that we have received this is what sets us apart from any denomination Daria's is because we have received God's mind God's thinking about this word because God is his only interpreter and man we've had man's interpretation that made the Methodists we've had the man's interpretation that made the Baptist we had man's interpretation that made the Catholic but no man's interpretation made this message are you with me hey man it was the thoughts of God a Manning to prove that in for God to make sure you knew it was his thoughts he let it come through a seventh grade Kentucky preacher and man they couldn't do it that couldn't even use proper grammar in order to to put down the mind of man and insult the mind of God and he was so time after time this is my mind this is my word and man I know your thoughts I know your heart I know your your condition where you came from what your name is what your address you everything that comes from the mind of God showing it it had to be more than human thinkin and my water just reminds you to I pull what Peter said we have not followed cunningly devised fables a man but we have been eyewitnesses of his majesty in our generation hey man now this message we received as I said was not from the mind of man those even those seals were opened by the supernatural I was high you know was taken some thought sir this man and that man and I was going to say well that's the best I know about it what I read in this book or that book in about that time he came in the room and man what was it God want us to know and how they establish this message is God's mind [Music] it's beyond to thinking of man it's higher than Bob Jones it's higher than any of them these the societies of manner or the the educational facilities you're up man you know it didn't come from a school of what they call higher learning it came from God never forget this is where our message comes from it came from God a mouth and God would come along and confirm it service after service this is me speaking cuz only I'd the word can discern the thoughts and then this real heart and it's without fail is always perfect to give you a blessed assurance to give you a positive faith that when you know it's said it and the message you know it's right now brother branham sitting in white Christ speak I think if any man or boy or girl and I think in an intellectual conception of what they think the word is and so forth will never be have a full foundation until they have met that light that brings the word to a reality I think the church in his practice no matter how intellectual and fundamental it may be that church can never thrive until the supernatural is made known among that people and they see it's something that they can talk to and that will talk back to them that vindicates this written word hey man so again brother Branham would say this in God and God Commission in Moses when a man becomes born again of the Spirit of God he becomes an offspring or a son of God and then he has the same kind or the same type of mind that God has I wonder can you can you humble yourself down for a moment to realize you know in this industry of surrendering your life that God is exalting you by giving you a greater mind a greater thinking than what you ever had before than what you could every cell with having all of the knowledge that the world has to offer when a man becomes born again that mind that was in Christ in us and we believe for the unseen for the miraculous and just anything it allows you to believe for the impossible a man when we have the Holy Spirit it comes to us and speaks us concerning these things and that's a whole purpose of these meetings your Christian friends it is for no other purpose before God but that your faith in God might be stimulated to a place to believe him for the salvation of your soul and for the sealing of your body so the whole message that was given was to stimulate our faith to believe God for salvation of our soul and healing of our body now only the mind of Christ can know your past and mine your present and your future is that right and my brother branham would tell us this in future home he said how many of you wonder then that discernment comes I'm going to tell you it's a it's a word that I say and it isn't my thinking because I don't know I don't know of the thinking of it how can I tell you who you are and where you come from when I don't know you how can I tell you that you know what you did ten years ago when I never seen you in my life how can I tell you where your doing were you were you what your new ten years from now how do I know the future but it's somebody else's thought hey man let the mind that was in Christ being you let the mind that was in Christ being you than it is that you're thinking it's his thinking through you and you're not expressing your own words you're expressing his words hey man so what was God showing us through this side it was showing us that we are at a junction and man were again the mind of Christ is operating to the body now why am I saying that because this was the day where the true Holy Ghost has returned again a man not a justification not a sanctification not just some baptism of it but the very person of Christ coming into the believer giving them the same mind of Christ and we saw it exemplified in the prophets ministry to show you the mind of rice is here and according to the Bible it's to be in you amen now like brother Breton said in anointing once at the end time I wasn't the one that appeared on the river I was only standing there when he appeared I'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things that happens as perfectly as they are I'm only one that's near when he doesn't I was only a voice that he used it wasn't what I knew it's what I surrendered myself to and man that he spoke through it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was a manifestation of the Son of Man and then it wasn't the angel his message it was a mystery that God unfolded it's not a man it's God and the angel was not the son of man he was a messenger from the Son of Man the Son of Man is Christ and he's the one day you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word on the son of man hey man now that's what we have received we have received the mind of Christ and that we have the mind of Christ we know about the sin in the garden would we learn that from the mind of Christ man because the mind of Christ we baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ where did we learn that from the mind of Christ come on a man because of the mind of Christ we believe in one Lord one faith one baptism it meant that our God is not three person but one person and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ and man we had the mind of Christ he's the one that opened those seals he is those seals for the whole Word of God is Christ and Christ is the seals it was open what was the seals in revealing Christ his mind now Jesus spoke and he used the mind of God now he was born he was born a human just like you and I are human safety wasn't sexual birth but he was a man right any man but what was he using he was using God's mind he surrendered his self to the will of God to the mind of God now I'm gonna share some things with you from the word became flesh in India trip report we're brother Branham talked about some of these things and I think they're very crucial to some of the thoughts I want to bring this morning he said what Jesus no wonder when he come off that he'll that night and he looked around that tree for food and there was no fruit on the tree and he said no man either from thee and he went on in the next day coming back the tree had withered listen brother Branham God's mind the mind it was in the beginning that that was a thought before it was a word that expressed Jesus Christ and that same one was expressing that word back so your Jesus was expression of the word can I cannot say it to you if you're born again you are the expression of the word man if you're not born again yet hopefully you have a seed in you that is already and going to be expressed Amen but but again God had it in his mind before the world began of what Jesus would do that tree and here he was the word expressing the word back and every word in the Bible is God's thoughts laid in seed thorn that it received a needy human being and spoke by the same thought that materialized the Bible brings the things that pass see what I mean how powerful could the church be the Bible's a leftist my that was in Christ being you as a man thinketh in his heart so is he now your thoughts if they become an expression this is like God said let there be a world before it could be a word it had to be a thoughts and God in creation created the world by thought first and then he's spoken and the thought became material see what I mean and money sent out that same spirit that said there let there be light and there was light said let there be trees and that those trees and if that same mind that was in Christ being you how much more could it say let there be no cancer and it would be gone let the blind eyes be open and it would be so see it's your thought jesus said but you said but that was Jesus he's away men he said how faith in God for verily verily I say to you if you say to this mountain be moved and plucked up and cast in the sea and don't doubt in your heart but believe what you say will come to pass you'll have whatsoever you said a man what power has been given to the church I said you can express it by mental conception of this is where we're going today because you actually have two minds or two conscience a conscience and a subconscious and receiving a mind of Christ is most of time the contrary to what the human mind is but you've got to believe bring the human mind in subjection to the mind of Christ to where they're saying the same thing now this is gone cutting it a little deep here so I want you to hold real tight because I think the Lord will reveal some things to you that I've been praying about for the last few weeks and I believe the Lord will just give us the key part give me the utterance Lord now you can express it by mental conception but if it becomes a real revelation of God that you see it before it happened and express it in Word form and that word takes ahold and becomes material a thought Express oh my how could how God could have your heart your mind is so in filled with God's Spirit until your thoughts become his thoughts say that's only perfect impossible for a prophet maybe for business but every one of you have the mind of Christ come on hey Mel there you are when your mind and you're leading in your guiding becomes a direct place our direct inspiration of the Holy Spirit moving in your mortal being what kind of people should we be if the very Holy Spirit has so embodied you are empowered that you don't use your own pops and you don't use your own mind and you don't use your own opinion but the Holy Spirit has you so built under your thoughts and your beings is God's Spirit expressing itself through you what kind of a people our church would we be a man a church that only express God stops a man the people who were able to express his thoughts his thoughts about a situation a man his thoughts about your salvation his thoughts about your healing your deliverance a church that could express his thoughts what kind of people would we be this morning at Branham tabernacle was so filled with the presence of God that when what you wouldn't even use your own line you didn't even use your own thoughts you didn't have no alternative of your own but just led by the spirit and they that are sons of God are led by the Spirit of God then when the human element goes out oh listen human element goes out and the Spirit of God feels that vacancy were you into yourself then when the church is in its power of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus will walk in his steps his power in his thoughts in his being it is me moving you see what I mean then your tops will become words and words will become material that's when the church in its power a man I believe its own it's rose that when the church will be so wrapped in Christ how many would say the day so wrap me in Christ the Holy Spirit mankind's so far away from themselves that they don't see themselves they don't see their failures they don't see their humanity they don't see their weaknesses they see themself as a son of God but by the blood last by the blood righteous as he is righteous holy as he is holy why do yes he is worthy somebody help me preach now hey man the thing that Darren there's thoughts so far away from themselves until they don't see themselves they don't have no thoughts but to serve God no ambitions but just to serve Him no trying to be exalted look here on gods man of the hour but just to serve Him hey man they refuse the things of the world and that moved in the spirit that live in the spirit that walk in the spirit and fulfilled the law Christ then the love of Christ in the human heart moving in the Holy Ghost that wonderful church will go forth with power and deity because deity will be revealed in human beings by the Holy Spirit bringing the past that thought of their mind that's a high calling now this actually happened as a prophets folks worlds into existence let me say that again this actually happened as a prophet spoke swirls into existence hey man that's that when he spoke engage Haddie ride her children it was the mind of God through operating through a man that spoke to a storm and man they gave resurrection life to fish that was more than God given life to a little insignificant fish can we see that was God sang to us Amen the fish has always been the sign of a God the Christian Church it was a sign that by word a message that God was putting life back into a church no longer if no matter how dead and gutless said it was I men stripped of its life and its power and laying dead upon the water the resurrection life is here the player turns back to life again and the power the Holy Ghost moving her a man a church said looks hopeless been dead for ages I want to say she's coming to life hey man I'm saying to you you're coming to life those are people beginning to realize who they are that can say like Paul we have the mind of Christ now God was and began doing extreme things extreme things to show us the power of his word did you hear me that was extreme speech in a squirrel out of nothing speaking resurrection life to dead fish hey man come on speaking speak into a storm speaking the tumor out of a wife come on God was doing extreme things to show us what God could do when the thoughts of God comes into the subconscious of man and it comes on his lips that it's the same as deity speaking that Satan cannot stand before that man don't you want to be that kind of a people that Satan cannot stand before a member calls the Word of God can sue in the heart of man so that word this book out and it defeats the enemy the fifth seal brother Brennan said I believe I'm gonna I'm not gonna speak this in his name I'm gonna speak it in the revelation of my faith well that's pretty good to me man he said what happened in Sabina Canyon the other day what happened in Sabina Canyon a sword came in his hand right so in the word had come the message had come if the Kings sword it wasn't tonight the night Knights in the end and may make great men out of people man what was it to do it was to tell use a two-edged sword it's it's the cottage to devours defeat the enemy with its overcome with its the word and says I believe the hours approaching when missing limbs will be restored and the glorious power of the creator I believe if he can make the squirrel appear that has no and here's a man or woman just a part missing and that's a complete animal his health hey man what's he saying you know here again if God could take him create a whole animal I mean he can he can put an arm back put an eye in the socket he's God her mouth and he's gonna do that in the church in this day hallelujah hey man I I mean listen if you can't believe it for now you can at least believe it's for the body change kinky so it's still gonna happen in this day [Applause] come on I mean even Jack Cole said I'm a sitting area stuffer and what's wrong and Branum there any any praise for a man who has no eyeballs this is in three days there be eyeballs in your head and by that evening you'll be seeing and then he witnesses these and I was there I went back because he said I wanted to see if this was true any and he says he said it william branham he's he's a man of are they to changing a dispensation and we're here in the dispensation were that there's a bride gonna be without spot wrinkle words she gonna be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye a mint but the thing about it is how can we have pay for for that until we can start believing in the church for divine healing now brother madam said he said now listen not with her selfish motive let your objective be right for anything out said let your motive be right for anything out side of the right motive and right objective God can't use it you know if you're sick this morning and you know if you need you know there's many many people there's that want to be healed but they don't have the right motive and objective even someone to be saved but they want to be saved so they won't go to hell or so they can be accepted in the society of the church then why the right motive and objective somebody with me a man but when it comes to the word we gotta have the right motive and objective I'm gonna live for you long I'm gonna raise my children or serve you I'm gonna use my gift for you I'm gonna be a way you want me if you'll let me to live if you I'll be a testimony I'm not the grace of God I'll glorify your name I won't be ashamed to get up and give glory but don't listen he said let your objective be right your motive be right Jesus said once if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt but believe what you said is being done you can have what you say what could move a mountain stop him in what can move a mountain can you he told him more than man say to this mountain and believe that it's being done and he says only deity Kenda the mountain only God can do it so we beat old man that he could do it if it had to be God speaking through the man is that right hey man so you did then and the only way a man could know it was God without it to be the right objective and the right motive if your objective is right and your motive is right then it's not you speaking anymore it's so father that dwelleth in you take no thoughts what you will say in that hour for it's not you that speaks it's severe to my father that dwelleth you heat death the speaking it ordered for the father to speak through you that you're gonna have to have the mind of Christ and if you have to hold a notes you have the mind of Christ again law of grace now I'm gonna bear bear' mine did is what takes to move a mountain mortal man can't do that so it had to be the father speaking in the man and man a man could not create squirrels but it had to be the father thought manifested in a man right a man we're talking about a people in this day have in that mind that mind of Christ now you see when God speaks it has to be so there's no way at all to get away from it God said let there be and there has to be and a word is its expression of a thought God taught it in his mind and he's spoken in its existence and we have faith in our heart the faith of God in our heart and we can see it clearer it becomes a faith and then we speak it and it comes into existence the same thing calls the mind of Christ is in the man that's what makes the healings and so forth when you give that perfect revelation just what you're doing then you know how to walk cuz that's the Christian walk a people walking by revelation this is my allow the reach of you and then you're a supernatural people you're a super church come out I mean you've been born of the supernatural so it's not out of the region this is what God spoke about a people doing now again it wasn't a mind of a man let me just stop for a minute let me just bring it down to our moment I'm it wasn't a mind of a man when brother Gary spoke about the needs of the church they're laying in the hospital three weeks without eating dine condition doctor said he was dying and the holy spirits fell and healed him and gave us God's mind to build his church hey man that was the mind of God and I'm looking out here we got a building falling we got people spread all the way up into the mezzanine separated different places why why God knew this moment was coming he knew we would need that mezzanine and his mind provided for even before we even knew about it come on it was the mind of God it was a mind of God that drop down that day and healed my brother Gary raise him up and gave us that unction I know it wasn't my mind my mind was already made up I wasn't that I would never move from where I was I was happy I figured I would live out the rest of my life there the rest of my preaching life anyway just stay right there I never had any plans it didn't have no ambitions I know people think I did but the devil lies on me a lot and he's got a lot of fake news and I'm not even President Trump but I'm trumping that out he's a faker but you see but it wasn't a mind of man it was a it was had to be the mind of God look what happened every step we moved everything we did every place we turn we did something that was impossible everybody in the whole community said it's impossible to build a building like this and not owe a dime on it but it's a whole different because of the mind of God or um I'm trying to teach the mind that God is already working among us we can look right here in our own mix it was the mind of God that led you here come on man the very mind of God they've moved on your heart to bring you to this place and set you here under this ministry was a mind of God - Janet many of you aren't even looking for God but God was looking for you and it was his mind that moved up on your life it was a mind of God that led us to Japan and man then it was a mind of God who spoke to money for it hey man come on man and God hadn't ceased providing closes his mind somebody with me oh man it was mind of God that day that sent me to Virginia to pray for a wrong Spencer when he laid in the hospital dying from burns I wish I had a picture of him laying in there all wrapped up and in in that in that condition right now to show you it was an impossible situation but the mind of God sent me all the way across into Virginia to pray the prayer of faith for that man that God raised him up hallelujah hey man it was the mind of God that saw drew walking mmm before he can even pull up good boy could even crawl and this kid this child jumps up out of the middle of the floor and runs for his first time I know my eyes beheld it and that didn't come from the mind of a man that came from the mind of God it was a mind of God that gives life to the bearing and I want to say it's already in an accident hey man it wasn't the mind of man when we stood there in the hospital I hope you hear me what's not the mind of a man when we stood in ICU room waiting there with my wife having a brain bleed and saying she'll be in ICU room tonight she'll be in a regular room tomorrow night and the next night should be home hey man you see you know God has shown us once more he's not able to just do it once he can do it again once he saw the church after do the same thing again you're looking over at the negative oh you don't she had another baby oh oh oh I'm saying going to God he did it again he did just what he did it again it's the channel getting open so the thoughts of God can flow through the body not just through my body I'm talking about the church body hey my brother branham would take him right with his pen the Holy Spirit your unction the mind of Christ writing something to us hey man and then he and we'll read some of that in a moment let me just read this from greatest battle he said when your mind when your mind accepts the life within the Word of God that act of acceptance will bring God's life into you it's not just your thought that does it but rather it's the Word of God brought into you through the channel of your thoughts see your mind it sets it and grasp it and your spirit controls your mind and when your spirit catches the Word of God the spirit of that word brings life into you hey man the light the mind of Christ is when faith speaks I want you to turn with me to very pivotal scripture in this in this sermon today it's to Romans chapter 10 and verse 6 and I want us to look here of the mind of Christ the mind of Christ is when faith speaks a math this is no son this is not some little name it claim it sermon this is not some little charismatic message Amen this is a message that God gives from his mind hey man looky here Romans ten six but the righteousness which I'll which is a faith speaketh on this wise say not in thine heart who shall ascend into heaven that is to bring Christ down from above or whose son is sin underneath that is to bring up Christ again from the dead so I want you to notice something here faith speaks then we read that faith speaks and one's faith speaks there are things it says Amen faith does not say where is God faith says here is God are you with me now hey man faith does not say where is God who he's power in the heavens and who can bring him down or he went into the belly of the earth is he really raised from the dead you see Paul wasn't aptitude but by revelation he knew that Jesus had raised from the dead somebody help me preach mm for he man about the road to Damascus hey man and he said I am Jesus so he knew he had raised from the dead and he could preach the resurrection because he had met the Christ that raised I want to know have you met the Living Christ have you met the Christ so you don't have to bring up from the grave well you don't have to wear it wonder did he really raise but he's here sewing in your life I am the resurrection I am the life he had raised from the dead and he's for your justification I know he's risen I've met him oh my road to Damascus when I was going the wrong way and wasn't I got knocked off of my high horse my ambitions my pride come on somebody and fell down in the face of the dust and he he revealed to me I am Jesus faith does not look for Jesus it does not try to bring him up or to bring him down from heaven faith sees Jesus so faith does not say has he risen did he really rise is he is he the same yesterday today and forever gives his words still the truth if that faith does not say he's way up in the heavens and I can never reach it I like it I'll excessive that's not what this says this is what makes sense what's this mercy but what this face say is anybody with me what does faith say the word is nigh thee hallelujah somebody help me now don't work who is the work he's the word Jesus or God is the word the word has all power the world created the earth by the thoughts about the word is 90 not up in the heavens knock down that you got a raise but right here even in my mouth what's the and in thy heart [Music] what came into you when you were born again the word the Holy Ghost is the word the word is the Holy Ghost the word is in you a man it is in your heart that it is the word of faith not the word of doubt not the word of confusion not the word of a thousand voices but the mind of Christ is in you the word of faith that we preach and if we're back to preaching Paul's gospel we are preaching the Word of Faith now we got a lot out there that has dinner identified themselves as word of faith but they're not word of faith you are the word of faith all right amen so watch this the face says I have his word in my heart by the Holy Spirit the abiding presence is always there he never leaves me or forsake me he's with me of my good times he's with me in my bad time he there with me when I'm healthy he's with me when I'm sick it don't change he is that the Word of God is mighty and I have his word in my heart and if the word of bites and lives in me come on hallelujah then I can put it up on my lips and ask what I will hallelujah this is what he said if you abide in me and my words abide in you do you have this word of mine in you Amen Jesus would say to their menu you are up your father the devil because his word is not abiding in you but now I'm going to ask you how many have his word abiding in you all right now don't think it robbery think it's what God's requiring a people who knows who they are a man they says I have his word in my heart I can put it on my lips I can ask what I will that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth what's now the Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation so when I believe with the heart and the thoughts did of my mind confess his promises I'm gonna get deliverance but the whole secret of it is is believing from the heart because there's a lot of people making confessions that are empty confessions I believe these are crisis and son of God the savior of the world and therefore oh you're safe now I believe they're saved no you're not saved until you believe it in your heart and that is a revelation and it shows them when that character comes in by a change of your life we said o'clock wasn't so busy hallelujah I need a calendar today I won't preach plum in the gym but I'm gonna preach a good part of this maze let's look at it for a moment with the heart verse 10 man believeth unto righteousness with the mouth confession is made in the salvation when I believe with the hearts and the thoughts enter my mind confesses promise I have delivered I have salvation deliverance for the scripture says whose ever believeth on him shall not be ashamed so if we get our believing right from the head to the heart and by revelation now listen this is a problem many believe in him they believe he raised him to death yeah but that's a mental assertion and it comes from a mental knowledge of reading the Bible or having the story told but mother of dad in Sunday school or somebody cozy a man but when it's believed from the heart it is a personal revelation that he died for my sins and he took my sins to hell and when he raised he raised to give me his righteousness and you must have the same personal revelation for your sickness Jesus said have faith in God let's go to mark 11:23 let's examine this form I have faith in God where is our faith to be placed in in God not in our ability but my words your words are like my words they're just human words but if we could every find the mind of God and speak his mind so the further the first thing it says in verse 22 is have faith in God so put your faith there verse 23 for verily I say to you that whosoever shall say to this mountain be removed be thou removed and be cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but believe that those things which he said shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore I say to you what so what thing soever you desire when you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them hey man now so believe to believe from the heart now you and I know already it takes deity to move a mountain a man and Jesus are saying here that with with the born again man there is D and with deity there's power and it's the same as brother Branham telling us when he said you know you've got enough power in yet to go make another world and live on it if you have just a little touch of God cuz there's no weak spots or little heavies fire big heavy spots in God but the little each touch of God is omnipotent a man so believe from the heart now it takes needy to move a mountain now won't you stop for a minute did you ever think about it that mountain Jesus pointed to and said any of you if you can say to this mountain be thou removed and cast mercy and not if they don't doubt in the heart but believe you can have whatever you say do you know that mountain steel is there today no believer has ever moved it somebody help me preach even Jesus didn't move it that's where we need sila right here's pause and think on this let me think let's go back over it again the mountain Jesus pointed to and said you'll say to this mountain be removed and castellón see and not doubt in your heart but believe that you can have whatsoever you say that mountain still stands and to Jake and no believer has ever moved it not even to believe of Jesus well the will of God was never revealed to move that mountain brother branham said if God showed me to go out and raise George Washington from the dead I called the whole world to come and watch it that's how certain he was if the mind of God spoke then it was going to happen but you know he never raised George Washington from the dead huh but the same as a mountain was moved when Lazarus was raised from the dead after being dead for days that was a huge mountain it was the same as moving a mountain come on a man the same has moved a mountain when squirrels were created [Music] come on mmm went a little who was give his life when a storm of smoke out in jigs out of existence when Hattie writes children were saved actually when you were saved it was the same as moving the mountain hallelujah a man that God should love a sinner such as I where is he would reach down for me when you have to move mountains out of the way for my salvation it was the same as moving that bastard then he was born into a mountain had to be moved when the tumor was built out of me - Brandon's body thousands of miles away that's the same as moving a mountain come on now when Atlanta was healed of cancer that was the same as moving the mountain I met with drew up that was the same as moving a mountain wouldn't there I of grew hair on that bald head that was the same as moving a mountain when Gary's safety was raised off of a dead bear that was moving a mountain a man with Jude Oglesby shriveled kidney came to life and begin to function normally that was moving a mountain hallelujah amen those were your possibilities made possible all I'm gonna tell you there that day you can receive that revelation in your heart of the will of God for your life man if you're if you're lost then he wants to save you that is power is sufficient that is black steel claims that is power still works hallelujah this kal-el effect you can be saved from the finest sin if God can lead your soul to believe it hey man now lead your soul brother branham talks about the woman who touched to him of God of Christ's garment using God's gift by her faith you understand the woman he said Jesus never turned around and said you know I've got power sai healty he said thy faith hath saved thee as I faith her faith did it you've got the word in you and you bet by his word you got his faith in you all that God he is he's in you it makes his character and my Jesus was Satan's I faith have saved me not my faith your faith now he says I don't know how I can make it clear to you not no more than be said that same God not just not here just with me he could if he would just be with me I'm not with you it would never take place it takes you and I together you've got to have faith I gotta have faith and the gift is like pulling out of a little gear into high gear see it's just knowing this shifting gear that's a gift it's still the same person but just shifting your soul into the presence of God and just see what he will say now you may not be gifted like brother branham loss but I'm gonna tell you the same thing can happen your soul can shift into the presence of God I'm talking about your your conscience your subconscious your your soul if I have time I'll get into it a little deeper but it but I just want to press this him for a moment shifting yourself into the presence of God see it was the mind of God that struck her soul Amanda said that's not gift come on the mind of God in her recognize the gift in him and said if I just touched the cume of his garment and when she did that moved her Mountain now said brother Tim if it takes hearing the voice of God well I I've never had a vision I've never heard the voice of God audibly I've never even had a spiritual dream but there's not listen to me real close there's not a true Christian here but what God has revealed something to you by unction it was the unction of the Holy Ghost that led you to an altar the unction of the Holy Ghost that led you out of the colony hey man come on it was the unction of the Holy Ghost who struck you as he says he talked about sitting on a log changed your life why the mind of Christ King Mia when that man came in your character changed your attitude change your spirit change you as a new man the same thing happened to you if you been born to give you see it was you you heard the voice of God it may not have been it may have been through a preacher but your iDevice the preachers a gift he's a gift of God to speak the word where that you can hear the voice of God hey man 10 it is say it a man when sister Therese winters came up having a mountain or life that she couldn't move of a cigarette habit then her mama couldn't get rid of in her own life that is that there was an addiction there that was impossible to overcome but by see by an option or the Holy Ghost came to the altar and from that day owners never smoked again what was that the mind of Christ [Music] revelation struck her I don't have to be bound I'm not a child of the devil I don't have to be a slave no more I'm free the same thing happened to you hallelujah gave you God's mind about your life you know that's true now listen church age book no man knows the things that God saved the Spirit of God and he to whom the Spirit of God reveals him we need to call on God for revelation more than anything else in the world revelation a man we've accepted the Bible we've accepted the great truths of it but it's still not real to most people because the revelation by the Spirit is not there the word has not been quickened the Bible said in 2nd Corinthians 5:21 that we become the one righteousness of God by our union with Jesus Christ did you get it says we are the very righteousness of God himself by being in Christ it says that he Jesus became sin for us it does not say he became sinful but he became sin for us that by our union with him we might become the righteousness of God if we accept the fact and we must then he literally became sin for us by his substitution for us then we must accept the fact that we by union with him have become the very righteousness of God to reject one is to reject the other to accept one is accept the other now we know the Bible says that we just saw it on the board it can't be denied but the revelation of it is missing it is not real to the majority of God's children it's just another good verse in the Bible but we need to have it made alive to us and that will take Revelation some thing if it's healing salvation whatever it is this is justification you become his righteousness you're justified you see it takes revelation because faith is a revelation if you're looking in Hebrews 11 and you see all of the places is by faith by faith by faith by faith by faith Moses my faith in it by faith Abel by faith it was all all of that is by revelation this is why even after you receive the revelation of the new birth then you must continue to be a people that receives revelation and I'm not even talking about revelation of deep mystery I'm talking about the mystery of God being revealed in you now Christ in you is your hope of glory a man that you have the mind of Christ that you are God's child a man and because you're his child his life is in you his word is in you and you can think his thoughts [Music] now it takes revelation because faith is a revelation look at Cain in the Garden of Eden now he's religious as he could be he brought flowers and put on put him on the altar bought fruits in the field and laid him there he believed in God he works of God he sacrificed to God he built a church to God he was just as religious as he could be but no faith no revelation he did all of this come on without revelation he believed in God without revelation he believed in worship without revelation now when I said he had no faith I'm not saying Cain didn't believe in God you know that God would accept his offering he believed that God would and he was believing God's couldn't accept his God was surely accepted as a man he put his heart into his offering but with revelation and Abel rolled him back a rock and made him a church or worse the place when Abel came he came by faith a man by spiritual revelation he saw was not fruits of the field that caused us to sin somebody helped me was an apples that they hate a man it wasn't fruits it calls him to leave the garden it was the light the separation light so he women got a lamp and he offered a lamp amen the revelation spiritual revelation was was three was revealed to him now this is the thing you know this is why faith is so elusive is because we think we're having faith when we're believing with our mind and we are agreeing that the word is right but faith is not an imaginary thing a man faces of direct revelation see if you only accept Christ as your Savior by your intellect you haven't got it yet and then you cannot see Jesus as the Christ until the Holy Ghost is revealed it to you no man can call Jesus of Christ except by the Holy Ghost otherwise they're just saying words but they're not saying it they they they they they not seeing it from the heart oh man you it's just the intellectual faith if we can just get my point down to you man brother man and say if you can't see this you'll see the greatest thing you've seen in years not because I'm standing you're saying it but if you can understand how that how it is that faith is not something just mentally perceived but it's a revelation a revelation of God by faith not the intellectual but by his heart now of course that's why we got to posin spirits that are at work at the world today in this evil age both of them are religious aim at one come worship in my beauty and knowledge and education and science and and the other by faith of the revelation of the Word of God so welcome both of them brother Brad and center standing right in this building this morning they're right here both Heights oh man the church world cannot receive revelation they are receiving its truths by their intellect and this is why the word will not work for them it doesn't change them it doesn't heal them or deliver them and let me say neither will it rapture them amen because the rapture itself is a revelation now this is very very important it must be revealed to you salvation is always a revelation whether it's healing or whether it's the soul body or spirit it's all the same thing if they've revelation now let me let me just read it to you from Hebrews 4 2 to back up what I said about the denominational world in Hebrews 4 - for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it so to those them are hearing it to both of its freaks but what the word don't profit them because it's not mix with faith it's not coming by revelation now the word alone will not save you or rapture you it must be mixed with faith it must be received by revelation hey man that's why a lot of the lot of the people around the message only make the message of personality cult because it's all a mental belief when it becomes in the heart you know it was not a man at all that was God and then you're following Jesus Christ and you're in love with him not a man a man now again again that brother brother Brandon said a revelation what his faith is God by the Spirit revealing something to you that he's going to do are then he promised and if you only hear faith cometh by hearing but hearing is not faith somebody write that down faith cometh by hearing but hearing is not faith I need some he said about ten times where you can get it man faith comes by hearing but hearing is not faith my loaf of bread is purchased for twenty-five cents but twenty-five cents is not the loaf of bread hey man huh it's a two dollars for three dollars and twenty-five cents today by the way hearing only brings the word that produces faith but faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen then you see you hear the word God reveals it to you that it's the truth and by the Spirit revealed truth confirms your faith to God and that's when God works that's when salvation is made when is believed from the heart hey man now you see you can have all the work brother Brendan said you can know it from A to Z and it'll never work for you you've seen men throw take that word and try to make it work brother glory to God it just won't work you won't get food with the word no no sir no matter no matter what you profess the word of testifies of itself no matter what you claim that word gives testimony that's right no Satan knew the word he knew it from a tizzy watch now Satan knows the word he has enough titles to stretch it across four or five pages a paper you know he must have read the Bible because he quoted to Jesus and it's written by man and man he said he had enough of titles to stretch across for my papers dr. Reverend elder pH ll QD and the alphabet never away his degree would have been in the Bible he knew every word of it he knows every word of it sure he does so Satan said now I know the word Anderson I know he knew the word when he came to Eve so he had it by head knowledge but it wouldn't work but jesus knew it by faith in the revelation of God's Word in his own predestinated a life he's a real hope that's a plug to your heart jesus knew he was Satan was wondering a man he knew he was a predestinated creature of God that God Himself was manifesting to him it wasn't him during the earth it was a father that dwelt in him and you know that you know that yourself you you have overcome things that you knew you didn't have the power to do it that you could not have done it on your own a man a man now so again you can have a nature given faith you can have a nature given patients or virtues or temperance and brother men set and the biggest part of our faith is mental faith by here in the world it brings us a mental recognition of God a man but he said if this coming from above oh brother if it ever strikes this this is there's a real spiritual godly spiritual faith there wonders faith does that faith only recognizes the word you see the mental assertion are the mental faith it also recognizes what the doctors see it also recognizes what science is say it also recognizes what the world is saying but when your faith comes from God it only recognizes the Word of God hallelujah amen then that's the thing you favor have him stranded not at the promise of God through unbelief the Bible said he considered not his own body now death or the deadness of Sarah's womb he didn't consider circumstance he only considered what God said and it didn't matter if his wife was 90 years old it didn't matter it didn't matter if he was a hundred years old it didn't matter it didn't matter that it never happened before a man God had said the mountain was gonna move and he was agreeing with what God said that's why Isaac was born of faith a supernatural birth and ever child a true child of Abraham is born of the supernatural now so now again when we get that faith of the the gates of Hell cannot prevail against us what is faith faith is something that's revealed to you a man that is not yet but you believe it will be a man you know you can you can go to a lot of processes now your Christian that has nothing to do with your soul you're born again but even healing is salvation on the body so just like you get a salvation in the soul you've got to believe for salvation or healing for the body it has to become a personal revelation you believe that God can but you've got to come to place and knowing that God will that he's done it for me you understand that there's there's a many a Christian go to heaven early because they never get that revelation for their healing now your hope you're not getting tired on me I'm trying to bring some things down to you you see again it has to be by revelation God revealed to me a man you can take them and put them in your mind and that's good that's what you have to do you have to take them in the womb of your mind just keep just take that word in just keep taking that word in keep taking that word in keep taking it when you don't even feel like and you just keep taking it and keep taking it in but there comes a time that becomes a revelation hey man sister Lana can tell you she took that word in she took that word in she just kept taking there's Sunday she couldn't even a soar bit but she still tried to take it in still trying to take it in what was she doing she was she was there nothing let letting that word come circle around her heart circle around her conscience looking around there and believing it's starting to you know I know it's true I know it's gonna be righteous if for somebody it can be right for me you know I have a right to to live I have children to raise I have a husband to see about and what happened sitting there what day in the service a man he became real to her hey man it was a revelation and when it was a revelation she said I pray and around the building she went rejoicing hallelujah and I see the same thing happened to you when you got saved concerts you know the same thing happened hey man you were new believer I can't be saved I believe it's right I believe God's intimacy I believe that I can I can be delivered I believe this and you're hearing the word and you're hearing the word but one day one moment it might not have been at the altar it may have been in your seat it may have been in a prayer console but it was somewhere it got down in your heart country God has saved me he's delivered me that revelation came that's what the church was built upon this revelation [Applause] [Music] midlist was said to brother Branham well we can we refuse all revelation he's and then you have to review Jesus Christ because he is a very revelation of God to man a man who said except you believe I'm here you'll dine your sin a man and if you can't believe that he can't believe that he says you're lost you put him a third person a second person or any other person besides God you're lost I wonder what these two Lord people would say to that one your prophet said you're lost and I say you're lost and man cuz it's not Revelation now faith is a revelation from God this room works his faith expressed faith is a revelation this is where I want to stay there just a moment it's a revelation he has revealed to you by His grace it's nothing you did you didn't work yourself up into faith you ever have faith it's given to you by the grace of God and God reveals it to you therefore faith is a revelation and the whole church was built among Revelation now even your new birth experience on the day of Pentecost that was a revelation he said like they did on the day of Pentecost said laughed and said these men are full of new wine they know it was the great thing of us there to those who has happened until why it was God revealing himself to the individuals that's what happened when you got the holding us here was God revealing himself to you as a individual while others laugh these were adjusted it was an individual revelation which is faith faith that's revealed if it wasn't faith then it wouldn't even be there it was faith a man notice he talks about David by faith we could talk about again by revelation by revelation David knew come on he he knew he had been anointed he knew the Holy Spirit was upon him he knew by revelation that he killed a bear that he killed a lion he knew the power God was upon him somebody help me a man even said they're dying on the other side didn't believe it and he said neither will the cancer I mean he laughed and said and my dog you send the kid out of here to find me he said I'll pick you up on the end of my spear and let the birds eat your flesh he said well I had everything for his side but said it didn't shake David why it was revealed to him he had faith in what he was doing he knew what he was going to do and he did it because it was revealed to him and he knew where she was standing and if God just would just spits out it and write down in your heart that you're not gonna be laying in that bed you're not gonna be sitting in that chair you're gonna be well that could be anything changed your mind hey ma'am but he said until that's happened every preacher in the world could pray I don't say it wouldn't help you it would it encourage you but until that faith see healing powers in you a man it doesn't come from the preacher it comes by revelation by faith not by power not by night but by my spirit saith the Lord my spirit my grace reveals to you there's nothing can take it away by faith revelation Amen hallelujah Amen just like the woman that was washing his feet I have to get to Jesus she saw him with the different eyes she saw him by revelation she saw beyond that the criticism Amen she saw him by beyond the scoffing of the world the society around somebody happened we preach hey man get with me now just for the next little bit she knew that there was all the words of the prophets and it was vindicated in Jesus Christ is that right she heard he was on earth and now she sees him and she's seen the word made flesh the Messiah oh man she heard about what he'd done to others and something became to be revealed in her heart he can do it for me too and when she begin to give it to the pulsation of her faith of the revelation of who he was and the time she was living that he was a lab for such sinners as she was she went forth of service needs and when she humbled down to worship him and serve his need he said your sins which are many are all washed away hallelujah and he said that's way genuine healing comes when it's revealed to you he was wounded for your transgressions he was bruised for your iniquities with his trucks you were healed when it's inspired to you to see his presence that is here the son of man revealing himself and now he's revealing himself in bribe for hallelujah Oh hallelujah let me say that yeah hallelujah he's here the son
