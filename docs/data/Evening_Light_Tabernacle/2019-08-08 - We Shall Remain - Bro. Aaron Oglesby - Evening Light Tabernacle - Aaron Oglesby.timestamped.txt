[46:51] places we can grab ahold look out of all
[46:53] the promises of God know that we can
[46:55] find that solid rock to take our stand
[46:58] upon this morn and say I will not be
[47:00] moved
[47:01] lord have your way I pray Lord Jesus

[47:20] morning thank y'all very much
[47:22] you'll be turning to the book of
[47:24] Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 11 been up
[47:32] late the last few nights for some reason
[47:34] haven't been able to sleep I've been
[47:36] seeing three and four o'clock every
[47:37] morning but the good thing about that is
[47:41] I've been able to watch brother Tim and
[47:43] Timothy services there in Canada and
[47:45] they have been so powerful so amazing
[47:49] how I watched as the Holy Spirit has
[47:51] just moved through that place and
[47:52] witnessed people just crying out to God
[47:55] and worshiping God and brother Tom ray
[47:57] got up and said I see people here crying
[47:59] out to God and worshiping God that I've
[48:01] never seen moved before and that just
[48:05] thrilled my heart because I'll know as
[48:06] we get closer and closer and closer
[48:08] they're still seed out there they may
[48:10] not have moved yet but they will move
[48:13] they're still seed out there they may
[48:15] not have taken a step yet but they will
[48:17] take a step we believe that with all our
[48:19] heart we're thankful that the Lord's
[48:21] using the men of God and just pray for
[48:24] them as they're out pray for brother
[48:25] Craig as he's still out we want to read
[48:29] here in the scripture Ephesians 6 verse
[48:31] 11 we'll read down through verse 14 it
[48:35] says put on the whole armour of God that
[48:37] you may be able to stand against the
[48:40] wiles of the devil
[48:41] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[48:43] blood but against principalities against
[48:46] powers against the rulers of the
[48:47] darkness of this world against spiritual
[48:50] wickedness in high places
[48:52] wherefore take unto you the whole armour
[48:55] of God that you may be able to withstand
[48:56] in the evil day I believe we're in that
[49:00] evil day and having done all to stand
[49:04] stand therefore having your loins Girt
[49:07] about with truth and having a
[49:09] breastplate of righteousness I also want
[49:12] to look in 1st Thessalonians 4 in verse
[49:15] 14 1st Thessalonians 4 in verse 14 these
[49:20] are some very familiar scriptures that
[49:22] were reading this morning and we're
[49:24] going to bring a very simple thought to
[49:26] you this morning my heart my desire
[49:28] you know as I prayed I want what the
[49:31] Lord wants I want to say what he wants
[49:33] but what just kept one up within me is
[49:35] that I want us to be encouraged in the
[49:37] Lord today I want us to be encouraged in
[49:40] where we stand I want us to know that
[49:42] our foothold is sure that our God cannot
[49:44] fail and if you're in him you cannot
[49:47] fail 1st Thessalonians 4 verse 14 for if
[49:51] we believe that Jesus died and rose
[49:53] again even so them also which sleep in
[49:56] Jesus will God bring with him for this
[50:00] we say unto you by the word of the Lord
[50:02] that we which are alive and remain until
[50:03] the coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[50:05] them which are asleep for the Lord
[50:08] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[50:10] shout and the voice of the Archangel and
[50:12] with the Trump of God and the dead in
[50:14] Christ shall rise first then we which
[50:18] are alive and remain shall be caught up
[50:21] together with them in the clouds to meet
[50:24] the lord in the air and so shall we ever
[50:27] be with the Lord amen may God and His
[50:32] blessings to the reading of the word you
[50:33] may have your seats what a wonderful
[50:40] promise we read here in the scripture
[50:42] that we are going to be caught up
[50:45] together with them and the clouds to
[50:48] meet the Lord I believe that's all
[50:51] that's what we're all living for today I
[50:53] believe that's the reason that we press
[50:55] on today I believe that's the reason
[50:56] that we get up each and every day and
[50:58] take another step we're looking for that
[51:00] fulfillment of that promise we're
[51:02] looking for the new body and the body
[51:03] change and that sweep to come in and
[51:05] come across our our body we're looking
[51:08] for that day when when we brush in our
[51:10] teeth maybe and we look up in the mirror
[51:12] and standing there with this as one of
[51:13] our loved ones gone on before what a day
[51:15] that'll be what a day when somebody
[51:17] walks past and you and you recognize
[51:19] them and you go was that was that who I
[51:22] think it was and then you'll feel that
[51:23] sweep begin to come across your body
[51:25] that's the day I believe that we're all
[51:27] living for I believe that we're right
[51:29] here at the rapture of the church I
[51:31] believe that we're that that the shout
[51:33] has gone forth I believe that it's lamp
[51:35] trimming time I believe it's exodus time
[51:38] I believe we're right here in the past
[51:40] so
[51:40] / and and it's so important as we've
[51:42] heard preached over and over again to
[51:44] make sure you're under the blood make
[51:46] sure that your life is ready and I know
[51:47] today that preaching to a congregation
[51:49] like this that there's people here in
[51:51] all walks of life there we're all in
[51:54] different stages of our walk with the
[51:56] Lord but I'm going to preach to you this
[51:57] morning not as if you're a beginner not
[52:00] as if you're backslidden not as if
[52:02] you've way on down the road but we're
[52:04] preaching to all of us as though we're
[52:06] seed of Abraham bottom line it doesn't
[52:08] matter where you at we're seed of
[52:09] Abraham and what you need to do today is
[52:11] just take another step and claim your
[52:13] promise and say I'm seed of Abraham
[52:15] that's who I am it's not about I was
[52:17] saved last week or I'm struggling or I'm
[52:19] up and down I'm telling you today your
[52:21] seed of Abraham and Satan hates that
[52:23] revelation in your heart he doesn't ever
[52:26] want you to come to the point that you
[52:27] realized I am gods I belong to God
[52:30] because once you get that first step and
[52:32] you recognize that then there's no power
[52:34] in hell that can keep you from obtaining
[52:35] the promises that he has for you because
[52:38] you begin to recognize it's mine it's
[52:40] always been mine it belongs to me
[52:43] because I am seed of Abraham and that's
[52:45] who we are today and that's how we're
[52:46] going to approach this but as I said I
[52:48] believe this shout is gone forth and
[52:50] we're right here on the cusp of the
[52:52] coming of the Lord but it's at this time
[52:55] not that we get close to the coming of
[52:57] the Lord and things begin to get easy
[52:59] that's not how this is going to work as
[53:01] we get here right to the coming of the
[53:03] Lord that's when the battle is going to
[53:04] rage harder than it's ever raised before
[53:06] okay but I'm telling you today that no
[53:09] matter how the battle rages no matter
[53:11] what happens we shall remain and that's
[53:15] what we're going to preach on today
[53:16] that's our that's our topic we're gonna
[53:18] preach on we shall remain Satan's
[53:21] Kingdom has reached its zenith the
[53:23] height of the tree of knowledge of good
[53:26] and evil has has come to full maturity
[53:29] it's more evil than it's ever been in
[53:31] the world all around us but we are not
[53:33] to be dismayed by the power of Satan's
[53:37] Kingdom because we are specifically
[53:39] called to tear satan's kingdom down we
[53:41] are not to be dismayed by the maturity
[53:44] of the tree of knowledge of good and
[53:45] evil because I'm telling you at the same
[53:47] time there's another tree that has
[53:49] reached maturity the tree of life
[53:51] been revealed to us in a way has never
[53:53] been revealed before it's reached full
[53:55] maturity you can see the entire picture
[53:57] the the broad tree has been restored
[54:00] back let the cankerworm and the
[54:02] Caterpillar and all those had eaten it's
[54:04] been restored back so it's not just the
[54:06] tree of knowledge of good and evil that
[54:08] has reached its full potential but
[54:10] there's a broad tree that's reached its
[54:12] full potential there's a broad tree
[54:14] that's going forth in the power and the
[54:16] glory of her mate the Lord Jesus Christ
[54:19] we're not worried about the evil in the
[54:21] world we're not caught off guard by how
[54:23] bad things are we expect those things
[54:25] those things are reaching their height
[54:27] those things are reaching their maturity
[54:28] but the bride of Jesus Christ is also
[54:31] reaching her height
[54:32] she's also reaching her maturity where
[54:34] she recognizes the power that she has to
[54:37] operate in the Lord Jesus Christ we're
[54:40] not to be worried by the evil because we
[54:43] have a promise that when the enemy comes
[54:45] in like a flood the Spirit of the Lord
[54:47] will raise a standard up against it
[54:49] we're told here in Ephesians 2 put on
[54:52] the whole armour of God to round
[54:56] ourselves with the Word of God to make
[54:58] it a cloak that wraps around us so that
[55:01] we're able to stand against the wiles of
[55:04] the devil
[55:05] what are wild wild our cunning arts
[55:10] deceit craft and trickery look he
[55:15] doesn't usually just show up and say I'm
[55:17] the devil and here's what I'm here to do
[55:19] to you he's very cunning
[55:22] he's full of tricks he's full of this
[55:24] seat - were many times were caught up in
[55:26] a snare were caught up in a trap and
[55:28] it's not - we're days or weeks or months
[55:31] into it which here we go oh the devil
[55:35] laid a trap oh I see we're on this step
[55:39] because we didn't recognize it because
[55:41] we stepped into a situation of deceit we
[55:44] stepped into a situation of trickery
[55:46] because that's how he works it's the
[55:48] wiles of the enemy now it's not always
[55:50] the devil that gets us in bad situations
[55:52] a lot of times it's that other d-word
[55:54] decisions decisions that we make and
[55:57] things that we do without going to the
[55:58] Lord and prayer without taking things to
[56:00] him we just think well things are going
[56:02] good hey that looks good oh yeah let me
[56:04] just take that job or just let me do
[56:05] this or let me move here and let me do
[56:07] that and we end up in a world of trouble
[56:09] because we make decisions without
[56:11] seeking the leadership of the Lord so it
[56:15] says put on the whole armour of God that
[56:17] you can with style.the withstand the
[56:19] cunning hearts withstand the deceit
[56:21] withstand the craft withstand the
[56:23] trickery so that the scripture here does
[56:26] identifies our enemy as the devil that's
[56:30] who our enemy is today listen it's not
[56:33] flesh and blood all right no matter what
[56:37] your situation is today you need to
[56:38] remember something your enemy is not
[56:41] flesh and blood your enemy is not your
[56:43] brother your enemy is not your sister it
[56:45] doesn't matter if it's your brother or
[56:47] sister that has made you mad that is not
[56:48] your enemy your enemy is not your
[56:50] husband today your enemy is not your
[56:52] wife your enemy is the devil and if we
[56:56] can get our focus back on that and get
[56:58] our guns and get our arrows and get our
[56:59] weapons and our Barb's and our hurtful
[57:01] things turned away from flesh and blood
[57:03] and point them back to who our enemy is
[57:06] the devil we might be getting somewhere
[57:08] but it's hard to press forward and it's
[57:11] hard to take another step it's hard to
[57:12] grow in the Lord when the enemy is there
[57:14] and we're fighting each other our enemy
[57:17] is not our brother our enemy is the
[57:20] devil our enemy our principalities and
[57:23] powers and rulers of darkness and
[57:25] spiritual wickedness in high places
[57:27] that's who our enemy is and he is a
[57:29] formidable foe the scripture goes on to
[57:33] foreshadow the difficulty of the coming
[57:36] battle when it says having done all to
[57:38] stand now they didn't say you know when
[57:41] you get through standing it's gonna it
[57:42] says having done all that means you're
[57:46] going to have to do everything in your
[57:48] power to stand that means you're going
[57:51] to have to give it everything you've got
[57:53] that means when it seems like you've
[57:55] been forsaken when nobody's standing
[57:57] with you when you don't have any streets
[57:59] left in your body Oh having done
[58:03] everything you know to do to stand it
[58:05] says
[58:06] and therefore when you've given
[58:09] everything when you've sold out when
[58:11] you've given every single effort you can
[58:13] give see this isn't a halfway battle
[58:15] Church this isn't a halfway battle that
[58:18] win this isn't play-fighting this is all
[58:20] or nothing
[58:22] this is everything or nothing the enemy
[58:25] is not coming at you halfway you can't
[58:27] stand and face the enemy halfway he's
[58:29] not coming at you with little little
[58:31] bitty jabs and little bitty things and
[58:33] just seeing if this will bother you a
[58:34] little bit or that'll bother you a
[58:36] little bit that's not how he's coming
[58:37] he's coming at you
[58:39] I went through deceit and trickery and
[58:41] when he gets you where he wants he's
[58:42] coming with the full assault he's coming
[58:44] to destroy you he's not coming to play
[58:47] games and you can't play games with him
[58:48] it's all or nothing haven't done all to
[58:51] stand haven't done all to stand
[58:53] everything within your power Jesus said
[58:56] that the gates of Hell will not prevail
[58:59] against his church brother Brandon would
[59:01] look at this and say this is
[59:02] foreshadowing showing that the gates of
[59:05] hell would be against it the gates of
[59:08] hell won't that shows that the gates of
[59:10] hell will be against it what what bring
[59:12] it down just a step further it's not
[59:14] just the gates of hell or against the
[59:16] church it's not just the gates of Hell
[59:18] there gets to a world-wide body a group
[59:20] of people known as the bride of Jesus
[59:22] Christ
[59:22] the gates of hell or against you the
[59:25] gates of hell or against you as an
[59:28] individual your individual wall
[59:30] your a relationship with the Lord your
[59:32] relationship with your brothers and
[59:33] sisters your family relationship your a
[59:36] relationship with your children he's
[59:38] against you in every aspect of your life
[59:40] that you can think of he wants to
[59:42] destroy it the gates of hell or against
[59:46] you what does this mean the gates of
[59:50] hell is not speaking of some iron gates
[59:53] or some big you know dark black iron
[59:58] gates that enters into the gates and
[1:00:00] those gates of hailer against you it's
[1:00:02] not even talking about a doorway or an
[1:00:03] entrance into hell the greek word
[1:00:06] underlined our English translation for
[1:00:09] gates is pool a and gates here is
[1:00:12] actually a good translation for the word
[1:00:15] pool a however in Strong's Greek
[1:00:17] concordance and in the Greek lexicon of
[1:00:19] new tests
[1:00:20] it indicates that Poulet in antiquity
[1:00:22] was used to indicate authority and power
[1:00:26] the word typically refers to an exit
[1:00:31] that people go through so here in this
[1:00:33] sense it means all the authority and
[1:00:36] power that proceeds out of hell so what
[1:00:41] is against you every demon power every
[1:00:43] power of Darkness every single thing
[1:00:46] that the devil can conjure up everything
[1:00:49] that can come forth out of Hell is
[1:00:51] against you and yet it tells you it
[1:00:54] doesn't tell you now when you see this
[1:00:56] coming you better duck and run because
[1:00:58] that's a lot of power when you see this
[1:01:00] coming you better duck and run because
[1:01:02] I'm not sure you can withstand it it
[1:01:03] says having done all to stand you stand
[1:01:07] there for I've been done all to stand
[1:01:09] Satan you've hit me a bunch of times I'm
[1:01:12] worn out I'm beat down but in Jesus name
[1:01:15] I press on I will stand therefore
[1:01:18] regardless of the attack of the enemy I
[1:01:20] don't care how dark it is this one left
[1:01:23] that ones ridicule and this one's
[1:01:25] talking about the message in making
[1:01:27] videos by Allah but I'm going to stand
[1:01:29] right here and then I will stand some
[1:01:32] more when I've done all to stand this is
[1:01:36] an all-in battle this is all or nothing
[1:01:39] life or death heaven or hell everything
[1:01:43] is on the line and the gates of hell are
[1:01:45] after you this morning what do i do what
[1:01:50] do I do brother Aaron the gates of Hell
[1:01:51] are after me how do I stand you got to
[1:01:55] put on the whole armour of God that's
[1:01:58] the only way you're going to be able to
[1:01:59] stand it's the only way brother Brendan
[1:02:02] would say and as the battle rages you
[1:02:04] become a real target look when you
[1:02:07] weren't in the battle you weren't a
[1:02:09] target there wasn't anybody shooting at
[1:02:11] you
[1:02:12] there weren't any fiery darts being
[1:02:13] thrown your way you weren't in the
[1:02:15] battle but brother Brown says now when
[1:02:17] you're in the battle you become a real
[1:02:19] target so there's only one thing to do
[1:02:22] you got to put on the whole armor of
[1:02:23] faith stand true to God
[1:02:27] stand true I want us to think about that
[1:02:30] all day we will stand
[1:02:31] true no matter what I will be found
[1:02:34] standing true if there's a theme today
[1:02:36] if we will remain it's that we will
[1:02:38] stand true we will remain true no matter
[1:02:41] what doctrines come what doctors go we
[1:02:43] will stand true upon the unadulterated
[1:02:46] Word of God you must stand true to God
[1:02:49] and march forward that's all God's army
[1:02:52] does not retreat Church we cannot
[1:02:54] retreat if you retreat you're just going
[1:02:57] to get shot in the back and you're going
[1:02:58] to end up dead anyway
[1:02:59] alright if I die let it be known that I
[1:03:03] died facing the enemy if I went down let
[1:03:05] it be known that I went down standing up
[1:03:07] no matter what you nettle no I stood
[1:03:10] there it doesn't matter I will remain it
[1:03:12] doesn't matter if I go by the way of the
[1:03:14] grave they will say he remained in his
[1:03:16] day he stood the test of time he was
[1:03:19] true to the word I will face the enemy
[1:03:21] at all cost never turn your back upon
[1:03:24] the enemy God's army does not retreat it
[1:03:27] goes on many of them drop off to the
[1:03:30] side and start this that or the other
[1:03:31] but the army of God marches forward
[1:03:34] we're going right on and on he says all
[1:03:38] we have a word for us at this time it's
[1:03:41] hold fast persevere
[1:03:44] don't give up put on the whole armor of
[1:03:46] God use every weapon he has given us he
[1:03:50] says use every gift that our disposal
[1:03:53] with the people that don't believe in
[1:03:54] the gifts I don't know what they're
[1:03:55] gonna do with that he said use every
[1:03:59] gift at our disposal God gave those
[1:04:01] gifts for it reason he doesn't do
[1:04:05] anything without a purpose use the gifts
[1:04:07] at our disposal don't be afraid to
[1:04:09] operate a gift if it's in your life as a
[1:04:12] matter of fact you'll be held
[1:04:13] responsible for not using the gift if he
[1:04:16] gave you that and you don't use it use
[1:04:18] every gift at our disposal
[1:04:20] he says use every weapon use every gift
[1:04:23] and look ahead with joy because we're
[1:04:26] going to be crowned by him who is king
[1:04:28] of kings and Lord of lords that's enough
[1:04:31] for me to go on with joy knowing at the
[1:04:33] end of this at the end of the battle at
[1:04:35] the end of the fight at the end of the
[1:04:36] hardships I'm gonna be crowned by him
[1:04:38] who is king of kings and Lord of lords
[1:04:41] I'm telling you it'll be
[1:04:42] worth it all I'm telling you whatever
[1:04:43] your struggle is today will be nothing
[1:04:45] it will not be remembered you won't even
[1:04:47] care that day when he says well done my
[1:04:50] good and faithful servant that's reason
[1:04:52] enough to stand that's reason enough to
[1:04:54] go forward and joy and having done all
[1:04:57] to stand stand even in lights
[1:04:59] hibernacula when you feel defeated stand
[1:05:05] when you feel beat down stand when you
[1:05:10] feel like you've given everything you
[1:05:11] have to give stand when you feel like
[1:05:16] you can't go on stand if you'll do this
[1:05:21] you have a promise the gates of Hell
[1:05:24] will not prevail against you the gates
[1:05:29] of hell we sum that up that's anything
[1:05:31] and everything the devil can throw at
[1:05:34] you so you can take your story which I'm
[1:05:36] sure is an awful one I don't say that to
[1:05:38] to minimize what you're going through my
[1:05:41] goodness human trials are tough the
[1:05:43] battles we go through are tough they're
[1:05:46] hard and sometimes they get us beat down
[1:05:48] but I'm telling you that that battled
[1:05:50] that trial that you're going through
[1:05:52] that fits right in there in the gates of
[1:05:54] hell that's where it come from and I'm
[1:05:56] telling you it shall not prevail against
[1:05:58] you lift your head up this morning seed
[1:06:00] of Abraham lift your head up your
[1:06:02] Redemption draweth nigh lift your head
[1:06:04] up and march on lift your head up and
[1:06:06] take another step the gates of hell
[1:06:08] shall not prevail against you
[1:06:12] [Applause]
[1:06:18] be all in half of the armors not going
[1:06:25] to save you look you can be a pretty
[1:06:28] good Christian you can put on a lot of
[1:06:29] the things the word tells you to put on
[1:06:31] and you can die in battle because half
[1:06:34] of the armor will not save you half way
[1:06:37] fighting is not going to defeat the
[1:06:38] enemy a half way life and Laodicea is
[1:06:40] not going to overcome half way in
[1:06:43] anything in this Christian walk is a
[1:06:45] backslidden lukewarm cold informal life
[1:06:49] and it's not going to take you in a
[1:06:51] rapture
[1:06:51] matter of fact it's not even going to
[1:06:54] allow you to keep holding on as times
[1:06:55] get tougher and as the squeeze gets
[1:06:58] tighter and twice tighter as the as the
[1:07:00] spirits press in harder and harder if
[1:07:02] you're not sold out if you haven't given
[1:07:04] everything you will fall away but I'm
[1:07:08] talking to seed of Abraham this morning
[1:07:10] I'm talking to men and women who will
[1:07:12] remain I'm talking to men and women that
[1:07:15] on that day they can say I stood true if
[1:07:20] surrender is an option in your heart you
[1:07:23] will eventually take it understand that
[1:07:26] if surrender is an option in your heart
[1:07:29] you will eventually take it you must be
[1:07:31] determined I will not give up I will not
[1:07:34] back down I will remain and thinking of
[1:07:37] this was surrender being an option y'all
[1:07:41] know I enjoy history and reading things
[1:07:43] in history and my mind goes back to the
[1:07:46] start of the Texas Revolution and the
[1:07:49] Battle of the Alamo and most of you know
[1:07:50] the story well it's something that many
[1:07:52] of us are taught in history books are
[1:07:54] told stories of how that Colonel Travis
[1:07:57] they're realizing that their days were
[1:07:59] numbered and that defeat was almost sure
[1:08:02] how he drew a line in the sand and he
[1:08:05] asked all the men there who would join
[1:08:06] him who would come across that line who
[1:08:09] was willing to stay and fight even
[1:08:11] though the odds look so terrible and
[1:08:13] what I love about the story is if you
[1:08:15] actually listen to the speech that
[1:08:16] Travis gave that they record as what he
[1:08:19] supposedly said after he drew the line
[1:08:21] in the sand was it
[1:08:23] doesn't matter if any of you cross this
[1:08:26] line
[1:08:27] I'll hold no hard wheel against you but
[1:08:30] understand it doesn't matter what you do
[1:08:34] I'm staying it doesn't matter if I have
[1:08:37] to face this entire Mexican army by
[1:08:40] myself I'm staying and he told them that
[1:08:43] no matter is not what happens retreat is
[1:08:45] not an option in my heart and if we can
[1:08:48] get that out of two down in our heart
[1:08:50] this morning look if daddy doesn't go
[1:08:52] I'm going if mama doesn't go I'm going
[1:08:55] if my brother don't go I'm going if my
[1:08:57] sister don't go I'm going but let me
[1:08:59] tell you I'm gonna fight for you the
[1:09:00] whole time I'm gonna try to bring you
[1:09:02] along with me but at the end of the day
[1:09:04] you got a crew look across that line
[1:09:06] yourself at the end of the day you got
[1:09:08] to make the decision because if it's in
[1:09:10] your heart to surrender if it's in your
[1:09:12] heart to retreat then when you're
[1:09:14] surrounded and the battles not going the
[1:09:16] way you thought it would go you will
[1:09:17] turn and run but when it's not an option
[1:09:20] when you put the line in the sand you
[1:09:22] say I will stand right here
[1:09:24] and when I've done all to stand I'm
[1:09:26] going to keep standing
[1:09:27] then when the fiery darts of the enemy
[1:09:29] come when you stand for Jesus Christ he
[1:09:32] will stand for you you will be
[1:09:34] victorious but you got to stand through
[1:09:37] the moments that look bleak you got to
[1:09:39] stand through the moments that look dark
[1:09:44] Travis had already made up his mind I
[1:09:46] don't care if y'all go I don't care if
[1:09:49] y'all stay I'm staying
[1:09:51] it's the kind of determination that we
[1:09:54] as the Bride of Christ must have before
[1:09:57] this in late February 1836 Travis wrote
[1:10:00] a letter I love this this letter you
[1:10:03] actually see it if you ever visit the
[1:10:05] Alamo there's a plaque there with this
[1:10:07] letter it's just considered a great
[1:10:09] moving letter that he wrote it's now
[1:10:12] considered a great piece of history just
[1:10:15] days before the final stand of the Alamo
[1:10:17] he says to the people of Texas and all
[1:10:21] Americans in the world fellow citizens
[1:10:25] and compatriots
[1:10:26] I am besieged can you say that this
[1:10:28] morning
[1:10:29] I am besieged by a thousand or more of
[1:10:33] the Mexicans under Santa Anna
[1:10:36] I have sustained a continual bombardment
[1:10:38] and cannonade for 24 hours and have not
[1:10:42] lost a man we have sustained bombardment
[1:10:45] we have sustained cannon fire we have
[1:10:48] sustained sickness we have the sustained
[1:10:50] depression there's been all kind of
[1:10:52] things come against us but I'm just
[1:10:53] letting y'all know out there we're still
[1:10:55] standing I'm just letting y'all know out
[1:10:57] there we hadn't give up I'm just letting
[1:10:59] you know that we're still in here
[1:11:00] fighting he says the enemy has demanded
[1:11:04] a surrender at discretion otherwise the
[1:11:07] garrison are to be put to the sword
[1:11:09] if the fort is taken Satan says you
[1:11:11] better surrender you better give up
[1:11:14] right now
[1:11:14] look quit now and I'll let you live
[1:11:17] that's a lie Satan cane tall for life
[1:11:19] Satan can't offer anything but death and
[1:11:22] that's the thing those men inside the
[1:11:23] Alamo knew that even surrender meant
[1:11:25] certain death
[1:11:26] so look surrender is not an option
[1:11:29] because even surrender brings that the
[1:11:31] only option is to stand and have victory
[1:11:34] victory is the only option for the Bride
[1:11:36] of Christ you won't like stand and fight
[1:11:38] you want to turn a life stand and fight
[1:11:40] you want your healing stand and fight
[1:11:42] your retreat is not an option he says
[1:11:45] the garrison are to be put to the sword
[1:11:47] if the fort is taken I have answered the
[1:11:50] demand with a cannon shot whoo I like it
[1:11:53] surrender boom take that for an answer
[1:11:57] you think we're going to surrender this
[1:11:59] morning devil boom but lower the boom
[1:12:02] moaning this morning he's got you
[1:12:04] surrounded he says here's your chance
[1:12:06] you can surrender I say I will not
[1:12:09] surrender I will be a part of the alive
[1:12:11] and remain I won't back down boom fire
[1:12:15] boom cannon add in this morning of faith
[1:12:17] many know I'm still standing I'm still
[1:12:20] standing
[1:12:21] Oh answer the devil this morning he says
[1:12:25] I've answered with the cannon-shot
[1:12:27] and our flag still weighs proudly from
[1:12:30] the walls
[1:12:31] I shall never surrender or retreat I'll
[1:12:34] say the banner of Jesus Christ still
[1:12:36] weighs proudly from these balls we shall
[1:12:40] not surrender nor shall we ever retreat
[1:12:43] Oh glory our flag stay away from these
[1:12:48] walls
[1:12:50] oh we're surrounded by thousands 200
[1:12:55] million do you surrender flag still
[1:13:05] waves proudly from these walls give the
[1:13:10] devil an answer he don't expect this
[1:13:12] morning then I call on you in the name
[1:13:17] of Liberty of patriotism and everything
[1:13:20] dear to the American character to come
[1:13:22] to our aid with all dispatch the enemy
[1:13:25] is receiving reinforcements daily and
[1:13:27] will no doubt increase to three or four
[1:13:29] thousand and four or five days if this
[1:13:32] call is neglected now understand he was
[1:13:35] under no grand illusion that they were
[1:13:37] about to be saved this man stood with
[1:13:40] this courage all these men knowing they
[1:13:45] would not be saved
[1:13:47] think about that knowing that when they
[1:13:52] just have to cross that line they had
[1:13:55] just a few breaths left they had a few
[1:13:58] days left and they were willing to do it
[1:14:00] for a little old building out in the
[1:14:03] middle of the desert because it was
[1:14:07] about honor is about principle it was
[1:14:11] about what they believed was their
[1:14:12] god-given rights listen we ain't waiting
[1:14:15] on reinforcements to show up they're
[1:14:17] here this morning we're not waiting on
[1:14:19] somebody to come and bail us out last
[1:14:20] minute this Adams race was bailed out
[1:14:23] 2,000 years ago
[1:14:24] Adams race the price was paid 2,000
[1:14:27] years ago we're not waiting on
[1:14:29] reinforcements we're surrounded by
[1:14:30] reinforcements how do we not have the
[1:14:33] courage to stand when others stood in
[1:14:35] the face of death when others stood with
[1:14:37] no greater reward than to die certain
[1:14:43] death he says if this call is neglected
[1:14:48] I am determined to sustain myself as
[1:14:51] long as possible and die like a soldier
[1:14:54] who never forgets what is due to his own
[1:14:56] honor and that of his country victory or
[1:15:01] death who had to stir something up
[1:15:04] within me I'm telling you victory or
[1:15:07] death victory or death he says PS the
[1:15:14] Lord is on our side
[1:15:19] [Music]
[1:15:23] there's more to the story the Lord is on
[1:15:26] our son he's here today he's in this
[1:15:30] building now you've been beat down in
[1:15:32] sinners and surrounded and attacked all
[1:15:34] week the devil says surrender surrender
[1:15:36] surrender yes the Lord is on our side
[1:15:41] hallelujah hallelujah you can't fall you
[1:15:45] can't lose you can't back up the Lord is
[1:15:48] on your side and if God be for us who
[1:15:51] can be against us hallelujah listen we
[1:16:04] know how that story ended
[1:16:06] they fought courageously for 13 days but
[1:16:09] in the end they all died with that
[1:16:13] letter began to circulate actually
[1:16:15] before the Alamo fell the letter began
[1:16:18] to circulate
[1:16:18] they said it went to New Orleans it
[1:16:21] quickly went up towards New York through
[1:16:23] DC into Boston all those places and it
[1:16:27] so began to rally the hearts of people
[1:16:29] begin to rally the hearts towards this
[1:16:32] place called Texas that most people had
[1:16:34] never been it would never go but they
[1:16:37] said it was just too far away for them
[1:16:39] to get there in time but they say the
[1:16:42] majority of Sam Houston's army that
[1:16:47] would defeat Santa Anna just weeks later
[1:16:49] at the Battle of San Jacinto was made up
[1:16:52] of people who had read that letter whose
[1:16:54] hearts were stirred and they said if
[1:16:56] they can do that if they can do that
[1:16:59] I'll go fight with people like that
[1:17:00] I'll go fight what does it do to people
[1:17:03] around you when you stand in the midst
[1:17:04] of a battle what's it done for this
[1:17:06] church when people go through the
[1:17:07] deepest darkest times when cancer
[1:17:09] strikes and you see somebody square
[1:17:11] their shoulders back and say I won't
[1:17:12] surrender I won't back down it begins to
[1:17:15] wail up something within you on the
[1:17:17] inside you begin to want to draw your
[1:17:19] sword and say I'll fight with somebody
[1:17:20] like that I'll stand with people like
[1:17:22] the people that even in like tabernacle
[1:17:24] I'll stand no matter what the situation
[1:17:26] they were fighting for nothing more than
[1:17:28] a state for a piece of land we're
[1:17:30] fighting for the souls of men and women
[1:17:32] fighting for eternal life I'll stand
[1:17:35] with people like that
[1:17:36] what to do when you see somebody stand
[1:17:38] in the face of a John what happened when
[1:17:40] David killed Goliath you raised that
[1:17:42] hand the children of Israel got fired up
[1:17:45] they drew their swords and Men who the
[1:17:47] day before were cowards hiding in their
[1:17:50] tent they charged the battlefield they
[1:17:52] charged the enemy they chased the
[1:17:54] Philistines you stand against your glass
[1:17:57] stand against your enemy and say I won't
[1:17:59] back down and watch your rally the
[1:18:01] troops stand there for a Travis wrote to

[1:18:25] endtime message all over the world no
[1:18:28] matter where you may be take your stand
[1:18:31] upon this message it's worth standing

[1:19:01] the line and say here I will stand here

[1:19:39] that pulpit like those other guys sorry
[1:19:49] glory to God they did it for Texas what
[1:19:58] greater calls them the cause of Christ
[1:20:01] who cares what the cost is though it
[1:20:05] costs me my life I'll stand for the
[1:20:06] cause of Christ though it cost me my
[1:20:09] life I'll fight for my children though
[1:20:12] it cost me my life I will fight for my
[1:20:14] marriage though it costs me my life I
[1:20:17] will fight for everything God has given
[1:20:19] me listen let me tell you something
[1:20:21] Christians do not quit
[1:20:28] Christian's do not give up they will do
[1:20:33] whatever it takes to keep fighting but
[1:20:36] this looks like it's gonna be years of
[1:20:37] fighting okay
[1:20:39] the Lord's on your side he will
[1:20:42] strengthen you he will give you the
[1:20:43] courage he will give you what you need
[1:20:45] to make it through those years of
[1:20:47] fighting what greater causing the cause
[1:20:50] of Christ I'm telling you it's time for
[1:20:53] some people in this church I don't mean
[1:20:55] this negatively I mean this genuinely
[1:20:57] for all of us we're at the moment - if
[1:21:01] some of us need a line in the sand
[1:21:03] moment what am I gonna do am I gonna
[1:21:08] stand and go all out or am I gonna be
[1:21:11] halfway am i gonna stand and go out or
[1:21:14] am I going to continue to be one that
[1:21:16] sees all the problems and faults within
[1:21:18] the church am I gonna stand and go all
[1:21:21] out listen I guarantee you I guarantee
[1:21:25] you that those 189 men and the Alamo
[1:21:28] didn't all love one another it was some
[1:21:32] rough people inside those walls but when
[1:21:36] it came down to it a bunch of men who
[1:21:40] were rough tumble frontiersman and I
[1:21:43] don't know maybe some of them knew Jesus
[1:21:45] I don't know but I guarantee you they
[1:21:49] didn't all love one another and they
[1:21:50] said I'll die with you I'll fight with
[1:21:53] you I'll stand with you for Texas and
[1:22:00] all we got to do is lay aside some of
[1:22:02] our bitterness and lay aside some of our
[1:22:04] dislike lay aside some of our problem
[1:22:06] and fault-finding so we can stand for
[1:22:08] the cause of Christ I say shame on us if
[1:22:10] we can't shame on us if we can quit
[1:22:13] playing the part of the accuser and quit
[1:22:15] seeing everything through the eyes of
[1:22:17] the accuser and finding fault in
[1:22:18] everybody the problem is people usually
[1:22:21] start seeing faults and everybody else
[1:22:22] to keep from addressing the majority of
[1:22:24] faults within them selves
[1:22:28] how do you know that because I've done
[1:22:31] it I'll always be real with you cuz I've
[1:22:37] done it when I find myself focused on
[1:22:41] what's wrong with everybody else and
[1:22:43] what's the reason everything is
[1:22:45] everybody else's problem I realize I'm
[1:22:47] not where I need to be with God I
[1:22:52] realize I need to get down on my knees
[1:22:55] because when Peter was looking at Jesus
[1:22:57] he didn't see the waves they were there
[1:23:01] listen let's be honest your problems
[1:23:03] were there my problems are there but if
[1:23:07] my eyes are on Jesus if they're on
[1:23:10] things of above if I'm busy fighting the
[1:23:13] enemy I don't got time to worry about
[1:23:15] what your problem is because your
[1:23:17] problem really ain't hindering me anyway
[1:23:21] my problems hinder me my flesh hinder me
[1:23:26] if those men can lay it aside and say
[1:23:28] I'll fight for Texas I think we can lay
[1:23:30] things aside so I'll fight for the
[1:23:32] kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ I'll
[1:23:34] lay aside my problems my issues the way
[1:23:37] I've used situations my own thinking
[1:23:39] about how things ought to be and who
[1:23:41] this and who that and why is that person
[1:23:43] getting to singing in church why do you
[1:23:45] care get your eyes back on Jesus and
[1:23:48] let's march forward that was free it's
[1:23:56] time for a line in the sand
[1:23:59] listen there's a promise given 1st
[1:24:01] Thessalonians 4:17 then we which are
[1:24:03] alive and remain shall be caught up
[1:24:05] together with them in the clouds to meet
[1:24:07] the Lord in the air and listen to
[1:24:09] brother Branham hear he says you're
[1:24:10] always pointing out how wicked the
[1:24:11] world's getting but you fail to see how
[1:24:13] powerful the church is at getting at the
[1:24:15] same time she's rising up standing over
[1:24:19] the field oh she's a little flock but
[1:24:21] brother God's with her that settles it
[1:24:24] right there we could dismiss and go home
[1:24:25] and say this week's gonna be awesome
[1:24:27] God's with me God is with me he said
[1:24:31] God's with her and she's going now
[1:24:33] listen these words there's no question
[1:24:34] she's going to triumph just as certain
[1:24:38] as Christ rose from the dead amen
[1:24:40] God's church shall never fail the gates
[1:24:43] of hell shall not prevail against it
[1:24:45] it showed they'd be against it but they
[1:24:47] cannot prevail the church is going to
[1:24:49] triumph through the blood of Jesus
[1:24:51] Christ to the victory march I'm positive
[1:24:54] this one thing God will have a church
[1:24:56] tonight without spot wrinkle or blemish
[1:24:59] amen I'm so happy about them I'm so
[1:25:03] happy about that today God will have a
[1:25:05] church that's not up for debate that's
[1:25:07] not up for question you are seed of
[1:25:10] Abraham you're a part of that church
[1:25:12] let's quit going well if this happens
[1:25:14] and if I get that you're a part of that
[1:25:17] church he's talking to you today let's
[1:25:19] throw the doubts away let's throw our
[1:25:21] little complexes away
[1:25:22] let's throw I'm not good enough away
[1:25:24] look that I'm not good enough usually
[1:25:26] just an excuse to not enter all the way
[1:25:28] in throw it aside step on in you're good
[1:25:30] enough you're bought with the price
[1:25:31] through the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:25:32] sanctified justified he filled you with
[1:25:34] the Holy Ghost he's talking about you
[1:25:37] just deal with it just accept it and say
[1:25:39] I'm going to accept it I will triumph I
[1:25:41] will overcome I will remain he's talking
[1:25:44] about me this morning but you must be
[1:25:47] determined to remain the scripture
[1:25:50] doesn't just mean that everyone's still
[1:25:53] breathing and left alive is going to be
[1:25:55] caught up to meet the Lord everybody
[1:25:58] who's alive and remain every single day
[1:26:00] has got oxygen and still here is going
[1:26:01] in a rapture that's not what it means we
[1:26:04] could look at the word alive there
[1:26:06] physically or spiritually but we're
[1:26:09] going to focus today on those who remain
[1:26:13] to remain means many things it can mean
[1:26:16] unused it can mean leftover it can mean
[1:26:22] stay behind and we don't want to be any
[1:26:24] of those I don't want to be unused I
[1:26:26] don't want to be leftover and I
[1:26:28] definitely don't want to stay behind I
[1:26:29] read something that just blew my mind
[1:26:31] when I was studying for this service and
[1:26:33] I don't take it as the gospel but a lot
[1:26:36] of times I'll read different Jewish
[1:26:37] historians and histories and traditions
[1:26:39] and things and by some estimates certain
[1:26:44] Jewish historians write that only to
[1:26:48] out of every five Israelites left Egypt
[1:26:52] that the others chose to stay think
[1:26:56] about that that the others remained
[1:27:01] that's not the kind of remain we're
[1:27:03] talking about this morning I'm not
[1:27:06] telling you that you need to remain
[1:27:08] where you are I'm telling you you need
[1:27:12] to remain on the journey which means
[1:27:15] you're moving you're pressing your
[1:27:18] standing true you are remaining that's
[1:27:21] what we're talking about today the other
[1:27:23] synonyms for the word remain is to
[1:27:25] endure to last to abide to go on to
[1:27:29] carry on to persist to stand to hold out
[1:27:33] and to prevail we must be alive and
[1:27:37] standing you must be alive and standing
[1:27:42] for truth to go in the rapture you must
[1:27:44] be alive and enduring to go in the
[1:27:47] rapture you must be alive and prevailing
[1:27:50] you must remain our battle vs Satan we
[1:27:55] know is not a new battle and I want to
[1:27:57] take a minute and just go down through
[1:27:59] history for a moment down through the
[1:28:01] ages down through the church ages and
[1:28:03] I'll try to go as quick as I possibly
[1:28:04] can but our battle versus Satan is not a
[1:28:06] new battle and it's not even a battle
[1:28:08] that began on earth we know that this
[1:28:11] battle began in heaven when Satan began
[1:28:13] to exalt his own will over the will of
[1:28:15] God it's a battle of wills God has a
[1:28:18] will that will always be fulfilled one
[1:28:21] way or the other
[1:28:23] Satan has a will God has plans Satan has
[1:28:29] plans and it's a battle of wills and
[1:28:32] plans and what can what's going to come
[1:28:33] to pass
[1:28:34] Satan had a will that was separate from
[1:28:36] God's will and he began to desire glory
[1:28:38] and he began to desire honor that
[1:28:40] belongs only to our guitar God and he
[1:28:43] kind of became impressed with himself I
[1:28:45] mean he was a big deal in heaven he was
[1:28:47] beautiful he was in charge of a lot of
[1:28:48] things and he kind of became impressed
[1:28:50] with himself so remember that the next
[1:28:52] time you started to think too highly of
[1:28:53] yourself where that kind of thinking
[1:28:55] comes from
[1:28:56] the next time you stand a little bit too
[1:28:58] long in the mirror I'm just saying some
[1:29:01] of us don't have that problem I sprint
[1:29:04] past mirrors as fast as I can which
[1:29:06] isn't very fast but I I don't like to be
[1:29:10] in a mirror too long but remember that
[1:29:12] if you start to think too highly of
[1:29:14] yourself that that's where that sin
[1:29:15] originated that pride began to build up
[1:29:19] in Satan's heart that he was he was more
[1:29:21] beautiful that he was more powerful that
[1:29:23] he deserved honor and he deserved glory
[1:29:25] and so that's where the sin began and
[1:29:28] and there's over time this sin would
[1:29:31] come down to earth and these battles
[1:29:33] would become human battles Satan began
[1:29:36] to glory in himself and we know that God
[1:29:38] hasn't cast out and brother Brandon
[1:29:40] would say in the greatest battle fault
[1:29:41] the great first battle that was ever
[1:29:44] fought begin in heaven when Michael and
[1:29:46] his angels fought against Lucifer and
[1:29:47] his angels it first started the first
[1:29:50] battle was in heaven so sin did not
[1:29:51] originate on earth it originated in
[1:29:54] heaven and then it was thrown down from
[1:29:57] heaven cast out of heaven to the earth
[1:29:59] and fell on human beings then battles
[1:30:01] from angels become human battles and
[1:30:04] Satan come to destroy God's creation now
[1:30:08] this is what Satan's plans and Satan's
[1:30:11] will is so we talked that he had won
[1:30:14] here it is Satan come to destroy God's
[1:30:17] creation when God had created it for his
[1:30:20] self he Satan come to destroy this
[1:30:22] that's what his purpose is to destroy it
[1:30:26] then the battle began here on earth and
[1:30:29] it began in us and it has been raging
[1:30:31] ever since
[1:30:32] so Satan's cast down and we know that
[1:30:34] according to Scripture he comes into the
[1:30:36] Garden of Eden even the scripture
[1:30:38] replaced him there in Ezekiel 28 13 it
[1:30:40] says thou has been in Eden the garden of
[1:30:43] God every precious stone was not
[1:30:45] covering the sardius topaz the diamond
[1:30:47] the barrel the Onyx the Jasper the
[1:30:50] sapphire the emerald the carbuncle and
[1:30:52] gold the workmanship of that tablets and
[1:30:55] of that pipes was prepared in thee in
[1:30:57] the day that that was created so he
[1:31:00] comes down into the Garden of Eden and
[1:31:02] wants his desire how do I get back how
[1:31:07] do I get back into a position of power
[1:31:09] I've lost it all I have nothing now how
[1:31:11] do I get back in how do I destroy God's
[1:31:14] creation how do I assert my authority
[1:31:17] over his creation how do I destroy his
[1:31:20] sons and daughters and he wants to
[1:31:21] destroy God's plan anger is built up in
[1:31:24] him and all he can think of is destroy
[1:31:25] destroy he wants his own kingdom he
[1:31:28] wants his own children and right off the
[1:31:31] bat it looks as though he was successful
[1:31:34] see that's what we said at the very
[1:31:36] beginning of the services Satan has
[1:31:38] plans and many times he executes those
[1:31:41] plans seemingly to perfection
[1:31:43] there are times you can look back and go
[1:31:47] Satan put this trap for me and I walked
[1:31:50] right into it and he executed that plan
[1:31:53] to perfection but he can't dictate the
[1:31:57] results he has plans but he can't
[1:32:02] dictate the results because God's plans
[1:32:04] and God's will will always come to pass
[1:32:07] brother Branham said through mercy God
[1:32:10] will change everything to make his will
[1:32:13] come to pass so the perfect will of God
[1:32:16] may have been is going to go just like
[1:32:18] this and end up where I wanted it but
[1:32:23] because Satan executed a plan and the
[1:32:25] permissive will of God then makes things
[1:32:27] do this but it still ends up right where
[1:32:34] he won't in his will is going to come to
[1:32:38] pass no matter what so right off the bat
[1:32:41] it looks as if Satan has been successful
[1:32:43] it looks like I all has been lost and
[1:32:45] Eve falls to the whispers of the enemy
[1:32:47] and it seems like it's over just when
[1:32:50] things were starting it seems like it's
[1:32:52] all over and it seems like Satan has
[1:32:54] accomplished his goal and he's become
[1:32:56] the Prince of the power of the air and
[1:32:58] and man has forfeited all that God gave
[1:33:00] him the book has now gone back into the
[1:33:03] hand of the original owner sickness
[1:33:06] death and dying now has reign over the
[1:33:10] whole earth but we learn a very
[1:33:12] important lesson early on in the story
[1:33:14] right off the bat what we learn is we
[1:33:17] serve a determined God we serve a God
[1:33:21] who is so
[1:33:22] termen when this happened he didn't give
[1:33:23] up on his plan we serve a god who's so
[1:33:26] determined that no matter what the devil
[1:33:27] has done to you he is not giving up on
[1:33:30] you this morning listen the devil thinks
[1:33:32] he's beat you down and put you in a mud
[1:33:34] hole and gods never gonna find you there
[1:33:36] God knows right where you're at this
[1:33:37] morning he has not given up on you he
[1:33:40] has not given up on you because you are
[1:33:42] seed of Abraham he has not given up on
[1:33:45] you because he paid the price for you he
[1:33:46] paid redemptions price he went to
[1:33:48] Calvary for you it doesn't matter this
[1:33:50] morning the stain of sin that it's upon
[1:33:52] your life it doesn't matter how far you
[1:33:54] feel like you've gone it doesn't matter
[1:33:56] what the devil is whispering in your ear
[1:33:59] right now know this God has not given up
[1:34:03] on you he is not giving up on this bride
[1:34:06] he is not giving up on you as an
[1:34:08] individual he is not giving up on your
[1:34:10] children neither should you give up on
[1:34:12] your children neither should you give up
[1:34:14] on your Christian walk neither should
[1:34:15] you let your weapon down and give up I'm
[1:34:17] telling you today God has not given up
[1:34:20] on you and God never gives up on his
[1:34:23] plans look Adam and Eve had just sold
[1:34:25] the world into sin and slavery I don't
[1:34:29] know what you've done but you didn't do
[1:34:31] that I don't know what you're guilty of
[1:34:36] today but you didn't do what they did
[1:34:38] and God didn't just cast them out and
[1:34:42] kick them out and say stay out I can't
[1:34:44] stand it you've ruined everything
[1:34:46] there's no hope for you you're gonna go
[1:34:48] in hell it's what you deserve I've made
[1:34:51] this perfect Eden for you but see that's
[1:34:53] what Satan wants you to think what
[1:34:55] happens when you stumble and you fall
[1:34:56] and he begins whispering in your head
[1:34:58] trying to make you think it's God see I
[1:35:00] gave you this perfect message and you
[1:35:02] couldn't live it and I gave you this and
[1:35:03] I've sent on this and you can't stand
[1:35:05] what's wrong with you you're no good
[1:35:06] you've crossed the line you're never
[1:35:08] gonna be safe that's not God that's not
[1:35:10] how God speaks to his children that's
[1:35:12] not how God speaks to Abraham said yes
[1:35:14] he will correct you but he'll tell you
[1:35:16] get back up my son get back up my
[1:35:18] daughter because I've made a way yeah
[1:35:20] that's not what I intended for you but
[1:35:21] it's okay get back up repent of it keep
[1:35:24] walking I've made a way that's how God
[1:35:26] operates so no matter what you've done
[1:35:28] you haven't done anything near as bad
[1:35:30] what Adam and Eve had done Adam and Eve
[1:35:33] but just given satan access back into
[1:35:35] and into the heavenly realms back to
[1:35:37] their seat of authority and look what
[1:35:40] our God says brother Brown says look at
[1:35:42] that now I see his shoulder stooping
[1:35:45] around his big body here comes an old
[1:35:46] bloody sheepskin running down those big
[1:35:48] manly legs tears is dripping off his
[1:35:51] cheeks padding on the top of Eva's head
[1:35:53] as she leans over on his bosom little
[1:35:56] Eve crying the tears padding down is
[1:35:58] mixed with blood running down her bosom
[1:35:59] what's the matter
[1:36:01] something's happened they can cry now
[1:36:04] they're mortal now they're dying now
[1:36:08] there you are I see God say depart out
[1:36:11] of my presence but he couldn't stand it
[1:36:14] I can see Adam start walking away and as
[1:36:16] he did I can hear something going what's
[1:36:19] this old bloody sheep skins better
[1:36:21] Brown's doing this flopping against his
[1:36:24] legs as he was going out I can see God
[1:36:26] who covers all space and time who has no
[1:36:28] beginning or ending I can see it all
[1:36:30] bottled down like a funnel coming down
[1:36:32] like this and one four little letter
[1:36:34] word l.o.v.e he couldn't see his
[1:36:38] children depart from him now why he had
[1:36:41] made the Covenant conditional with Adam
[1:36:43] but now he makes it unconditional said I
[1:36:46] will put enmity between the woman's seed
[1:36:48] and he would bruise the Serpent's head
[1:36:51] and so forth and he promised a savior
[1:36:53] right after the fall right after the
[1:36:56] great sin that cast us all into sin and
[1:36:58] slavery of Satan and he doesn't cast
[1:37:01] them down you haven't gone too far this
[1:37:03] morning you haven't done too much this
[1:37:05] morning a grace of God won't forgive
[1:37:07] won't repair won't fix won't lift you up
[1:37:09] to where he wants you to be he says but
[1:37:12] then when I see when poor little Eve
[1:37:14] looked over in the face of Adam and
[1:37:16] knowed that she had caused the fall of
[1:37:18] the human race she threw her arms are on
[1:37:21] Adam who was not deceived and listen I
[1:37:24] can hear them as they start going out
[1:37:26] come come bloody sheepskins beating
[1:37:28] against them their legs God the whole
[1:37:31] universe I can see it begin to come down
[1:37:33] like a funnel into the four-letter word
[1:37:35] l.o.v.e he just couldn't see them he
[1:37:37] loved them so well - he couldn't see
[1:37:40] them go and he said he put in between
[1:37:42] between her seed and the surf
[1:37:43] seed in that same clumping of them sheep
[1:37:46] skins that bloody beating again Stephen
[1:37:48] Adam as they went out of the Garden of
[1:37:49] Eden then the same blood of the Sun beat
[1:37:52] against his legs as he went to Calvary
[1:37:54] under with our sins upon him and the
[1:37:57] blood beating from his body carrying up
[1:37:59] yonder into Calvary Church he was
[1:38:03] determined that his plan wouldn't fail
[1:38:05] he was determined that you wouldn't fail
[1:38:08] when all seemed lost when darkness was
[1:38:11] all around when there was no way out
[1:38:12] sick succeed he said I will give my life
[1:38:15] for Aaron Oglesby I will not give up on
[1:38:18] him I will give my life for Joe Adams I
[1:38:20] will not give up on him I'll give my
[1:38:22] life for Sherman Thomas I won't give up
[1:38:24] on him I will give my life for whosoever
[1:38:27] will I will not give up on them this
[1:38:30] morning he is not giving up on you
[1:38:32] because his plan and his will will
[1:38:35] remain he says our God is a determined
[1:38:41] God God is determined when God makes up
[1:38:43] his mind to do anything it has to be
[1:38:45] that's a short quote but it's powerful
[1:38:47] when God makes up his mind to do
[1:38:49] anything it has to be so what are we
[1:38:52] worried about what are we worried about
[1:38:55] it has to be I'll have a church without
[1:38:58] spot or wrinkle it has to be Satan's
[1:39:03] full of lies and fears that he loves to
[1:39:05] put on people and one of the biggest
[1:39:07] ones that he loves to spout is that one
[1:39:08] you've gone too far you've gone too far
[1:39:11] and he'll tell you that you've crossed
[1:39:13] the line and he'll tell you that there's
[1:39:15] no help for you and God listen it's a
[1:39:18] liar he wouldn't even be telling you
[1:39:20] that God never talks to people that way
[1:39:23] listen if you had gone too far you would
[1:39:25] have zero desire for God you would not
[1:39:31] be here this morning or listening to
[1:39:33] this service if you'd gone too far you
[1:39:36] would have no desire forgotten to be
[1:39:38] honest with you
[1:39:39] sometimes that can't even be the perfect
[1:39:41] predictor because I'm telling you most
[1:39:43] days I bet Legion didn't have a desire
[1:39:45] for God but all it took was one moment
[1:39:48] listen your loved one hadn't gone as far
[1:39:51] as Legion went you haven't gone as far
[1:39:53] as Legion went all it takes is one
[1:39:56] moment of him or her going god I need
[1:39:58] you one moment and he'll cross seas for
[1:40:00] that soul one moment and he'll cross
[1:40:03] seas for you you haven't gone that far
[1:40:05] your daughter your loved one hasn't gone
[1:40:07] as far as Mary Magdalene went they
[1:40:10] haven't reached the depths of sin that
[1:40:12] Mary Magdalene went but she hadn't gone
[1:40:14] to for one moment in his presence and
[1:40:17] everything changed one moment his but
[1:40:19] you don't know the sin they're in
[1:40:21] you don't know the lifestyle they're
[1:40:22] living you don't understand I know how
[1:40:24] Mary Magdalene lived and I know that he
[1:40:27] made her the very first living witness
[1:40:29] when he rose from the tomb she was the
[1:40:31] witness that came out said he's alive
[1:40:33] he's alive and I'm telling you your
[1:40:35] young person your loved one one day they
[1:40:37] may come home and say he's alive mama
[1:40:40] he's alive he made it real to me he's
[1:40:44] alive in my heart he can make your loved
[1:40:46] one a living witness that he's risen
[1:40:49] from the tombs it doesn't matter how far
[1:40:52] they go they have not crossed the line
[1:40:53] you have not crossed the line there's
[1:40:56] grace for you still brother Branham says
[1:41:06] Satan cannot keep revelation down when
[1:41:09] the spirit wants to give it that's good
[1:41:12] right there he cannot keep revelation
[1:41:15] down when the spirit wants to get listen
[1:41:17] darkness upon darkness upon darkness
[1:41:20] upon darkness can't keep the light of
[1:41:23] God's word from shining when it's time
[1:41:25] when it's time to shine that light or
[1:41:27] pierce every darkness it'll cut through
[1:41:29] every doubt every fear and unbelief
[1:41:31] listen darkness upon darkness upon
[1:41:33] darkness can't keep your promise from
[1:41:35] coming to pass when it's time you're
[1:41:37] holding on to something just keep
[1:41:38] holding on if it's God's will and I
[1:41:41] believe it is he will not withhold any
[1:41:42] good thing from you you just keep
[1:41:44] holding on when it's time darkness upon
[1:41:46] darkness upon darkness cannot hinder it
[1:41:48] from going forth light shining in
[1:41:51] darkness and darkness don't know what to
[1:41:53] do with it
[1:41:53] darkness can't stop light it's not
[1:41:56] [Music]
[1:41:58] we serve a determined God he wants to
[1:42:00] determine people we realize of course
[1:42:03] that it's only through our trust and
[1:42:05] faith in him that we're able to remain I
[1:42:07] understand that I understand that it's
[1:42:09] all through him I understand that it's
[1:42:12] all his promises
[1:42:13] I understand it's all his strength when
[1:42:14] we're weak he is strong I understand
[1:42:17] that but there's a part that you got to
[1:42:18] play there's a certain grip that he
[1:42:20] expects out of his people there's a
[1:42:22] certain determination a certain resolve
[1:42:24] he expects you to have a backbone
[1:42:26] because he'll move on the scene for you
[1:42:28] when you've done all to stand okay when
[1:42:31] you don't stand he has no opportunity to
[1:42:33] move but when you've done all to stand
[1:42:35] when you've showed your backbone you've
[1:42:36] shown your resolve then he will move on
[1:42:38] the scene for you every time and I'm
[1:42:40] telling you today whether you realize it
[1:42:41] or not every single one of you have that
[1:42:43] grit every single one of you have that
[1:42:45] resolve every single one of you have
[1:42:47] that backbone it takes longer to show up
[1:42:49] in some people than others
[1:42:50] it took many years for it showed up in
[1:42:52] my own life all right once again I know
[1:42:54] what I'm talking about there's times you
[1:42:55] don't realize you have it there's times
[1:42:57] you don't know what's within you there's
[1:42:59] many times Shamgar let him take all his
[1:43:01] crops because he didn't know what was
[1:43:03] within him but on the day that the
[1:43:05] revelation struck on the day that had
[1:43:07] dropped down within his heart that I am
[1:43:08] a seed of Abraham remember your seed of
[1:43:10] Abraham when it struck down in his heart
[1:43:12] that I am a part of the covenant people
[1:43:14] and you're a part of the covenant people
[1:43:16] then the odds didn't matter the amount
[1:43:18] of devils didn't matter
[1:43:19] the sickness didn't matter none of that
[1:43:21] mattered because he had a promise that
[1:43:23] he had a covenant and now there was
[1:43:24] something that welled up within him that
[1:43:26] he didn't even know was there
[1:43:28] and today you may not even know the
[1:43:30] courage that you had you may not even
[1:43:32] know the backbone you had but it's there
[1:43:34] it's there I believe that for you even
[1:43:38] if you can't believe it right now I
[1:43:40] believe it's there sometimes this old
[1:43:43] flesh gets in the way and sometimes it
[1:43:45] takes longer to show up but that
[1:43:48] predestinated seed deep down on the
[1:43:51] inside of you it's the real you and it
[1:43:54] won't let you quit you feel like you
[1:43:56] have no courage but for some reason you
[1:43:58] can't ever quit you feel like that you
[1:43:59] can't do anything right but for some
[1:44:01] reason you can't ever quit it won't ever
[1:44:03] let you give up it won't ever let you
[1:44:04] even though this flesh wants to and
[1:44:06] you're like I'm tired I can't go on your
[1:44:08] mind as a grin yep that's right you're
[1:44:09] tired you can't
[1:44:10] I don't know if I can go on and yet you
[1:44:12] get up and you go on you get up and you
[1:44:14] take another step you get up and you
[1:44:16] keep pressing on you get up and you
[1:44:18] remain because there's something inside
[1:44:19] of you it's a predestinated seed gene of
[1:44:22] God that will not let you quit it will
[1:44:24] not let you fall it will not let you
[1:44:26] fail you will remain till the end you
[1:44:29] can't help it I'm glad it's not relying
[1:44:33] on me I'd have probably quit a long time
[1:44:34] ago but I can't help it something keeps
[1:44:36] holding me something keeps dragging me
[1:44:39] along something keeps building up on the
[1:44:41] inside of me that says that's true
[1:44:42] that's true
[1:44:43] keep walking keep fighting that's true
[1:44:46] there's victory just ahead if there's a
[1:44:48] rapture just ahead but I don't know keep
[1:44:50] going keep fighting it's pushing me and
[1:44:53] it's welling up on the inside I can't
[1:44:56] help it something deep down says keep
[1:45:01] walking keep fighting and that's what
[1:45:04] we've seen in the elect down through the
[1:45:05] ages someone there's someone go real
[1:45:07] quick now and skip over but Satan's
[1:45:10] always tried to destroy the seed of God
[1:45:12] in every age and the seed just kept
[1:45:16] moving on see just kept moving on it
[1:45:19] remained through every circumstance in
[1:45:20] Noah's time Satan made it so evil that
[1:45:23] God said I'm gonna destroy a man who I
[1:45:25] created for it repents me that I've even
[1:45:28] made them you think it's bad in this day
[1:45:30] and that day one man remained one and
[1:45:35] against all odds against every ridicule
[1:45:39] he stood he remained right there with
[1:45:42] his ark right there with his message
[1:45:44] this is truth he was outnumbered he was
[1:45:47] scoffed at he remained the plan of God
[1:45:50] will always continue despite Satan's
[1:45:53] efforts look we could point to many that
[1:45:55] stood through tough times and remained
[1:45:58] true despite all the devil through Adam
[1:46:00] David stood in the face of a John Daniel
[1:46:05] stood in a strange land all alone stood
[1:46:08] in the face of the lion's den' threat of
[1:46:11] death he remained true separated from
[1:46:13] all the other believers even into the
[1:46:16] lives then he went the three Hebrew
[1:46:18] children stood even under penalty of
[1:46:20] death they would not bow to an
[1:46:24] they wouldn't bow to an image even
[1:46:26] though that image was made in the image
[1:46:28] of a prophet they weren't gonna stand
[1:46:30] and bow to an image of a prophet they
[1:46:33] weren't gonna worship a prophet it
[1:46:35] didn't matter how holy he was and how
[1:46:36] how wonderful God had used the man and
[1:46:39] how respected he was they were to have
[1:46:40] no other Idol no other God before their
[1:46:43] God and they weren't going to bow before
[1:46:46] the image of a prophet and then I say
[1:46:48] the same goes for people today we serve
[1:46:51] one true Living God and we're not going
[1:46:54] to bow before any idol regardless of
[1:46:56] what that idol may be brother Branham
[1:46:58] says the time came for Shadrach Meshach
[1:47:00] and Abednego just show their colors show
[1:47:03] their face so they turned their back to
[1:47:05] the image they said our God is able to
[1:47:07] deliver us from the fiery furnace but
[1:47:09] nevertheless we will not bow down to the
[1:47:12] image there it was it was time the
[1:47:14] season was there so the time came that
[1:47:16] when he was going to throw them into the
[1:47:18] fiery furnace burn that religion out of
[1:47:20] them that's what the devil tries to do
[1:47:22] all the time burn you up on something
[1:47:24] make you sicker when you're prayed for
[1:47:27] make you think you've lost your
[1:47:29] experience some of you that's had a new
[1:47:32] experience with God you hadn't lost your
[1:47:34] experience you did get exactly what you
[1:47:36] said you got that's the devil lyin to
[1:47:37] you some of you that's been walking with
[1:47:39] God all these years and he's telling you
[1:47:41] all of a sudden you don't have the Holy
[1:47:42] Ghost that's the devil lyin to you you
[1:47:45] keep walking you keep trusting you do
[1:47:47] not back off the promise God gave you do
[1:47:49] not back off your testimony if you said
[1:47:51] you were healed you're healed you stand
[1:47:53] there you said the Lord filled me with
[1:47:55] the spirit you're the one who knows the
[1:47:56] devil don't know you were there you were
[1:47:59] there when it happened you remember how
[1:48:01] your life changed don't let him talk you
[1:48:03] out of anything he tries to burn us out
[1:48:06] on things he tries to make you think
[1:48:07] you've lost your experience he's lying
[1:48:09] to you
[1:48:10] the time comes when you have to stand on
[1:48:13] God's Word and stand alone that comes
[1:48:16] for every one of us there will come a
[1:48:19] time when you must stand alone and maybe
[1:48:23] it's just you and the devil standing
[1:48:25] there because when it comes time for
[1:48:27] those battles you have to know that you
[1:48:30] know that
[1:48:31] you know when the hour gets dark brother
[1:48:34] Gary that anchor holds dawning when you
[1:48:37] have to stand alone the anchor will hold
[1:48:39] I promise you the anchor is held down
[1:48:42] through the ages it held all the way
[1:48:45] down it held for no it held for Daniel
[1:48:46] and held for the three Hebrew children
[1:48:47] it held for Shamgar
[1:48:49] and it'll hold for you today he said
[1:48:52] there's got to be a time when you've got
[1:48:53] to separate yourself between your
[1:48:55] feelings and your faith that time is
[1:48:58] tonight I believe that as time that we
[1:49:01] separate our feelings from our faith the
[1:49:03] Word says so that settles it that's the
[1:49:06] end of it his word will be fulfilled on
[1:49:08] and on it goes time after time we see it
[1:49:11] when everyone else quits the seat of God
[1:49:13] presses on when everything seems to be
[1:49:15] against you and the odds are stacked
[1:49:17] against God's children when it's the
[1:49:19] darkest hour there's always someone who
[1:49:21] says I will remain God will always have
[1:49:26] his hand a person he can put his hand on
[1:49:28] God will always have a testimony upon
[1:49:30] the earth God's plan will always march
[1:49:33] forward and it doesn't matter what Satan
[1:49:34] does somebody's going to end or
[1:49:36] somebody's going to persevere the elect
[1:49:38] of God will always stand against the
[1:49:41] power of darkness but in the end Satan
[1:49:42] doesn't give up he never gives up and we
[1:49:45] come on down through history and time
[1:49:47] after time Satan feels like he was so
[1:49:49] close to overthrowing God's program so
[1:49:51] close he was right there oh I thought I
[1:49:53] had oh oh I thought I had him he's
[1:49:55] always right there right on the edge but
[1:49:57] our gods always one step ahead of him
[1:49:58] our gods always one step ahead of our
[1:50:01] God knows the end from the beginning
[1:50:02] that dumb old devil ain't figured out
[1:50:04] yet that wait this God knows what I'm
[1:50:06] about to do wait a minute this God knows
[1:50:08] exactly the turn I'm fitting to make he
[1:50:10] knows and so he keeps his hand upon your
[1:50:12] life even though you don't see that turn
[1:50:13] coming God knows that turns coming God
[1:50:16] keeps his hand upon unit Satan looked
[1:50:19] like he had it all defeated so close to
[1:50:21] causing everything to cave-in only to
[1:50:23] have somebody stand in his face I'm
[1:50:26] proud to be one that's standing in his
[1:50:27] face and his own even standing for
[1:50:29] righteousness but we come down to a
[1:50:31] crucial time about two thousand years
[1:50:34] ago when it seemed like mankind could
[1:50:36] not go on when it seemed like Satan
[1:50:39] finally had the world in total and
[1:50:41] complete disarray and I love these
[1:50:43] quotes right here
[1:50:45] now Adams race was all in bondage there
[1:50:48] they were without hope without God
[1:50:49] without chance without mercy without
[1:50:51] anything that could help them the great
[1:50:53] enemies of the lower region of the loss
[1:50:55] had them shut up in darkness there was
[1:50:57] not a way out there was no one could
[1:51:00] help nothing could be done it looked
[1:51:03] like a total complete loss that is worse
[1:51:07] than the situation you're in
[1:51:10] Adams race was backed into a corner
[1:51:13] where the law and the judgments and the
[1:51:14] prophets and everything that had been
[1:51:16] sent had failed nothing could be done
[1:51:19] human race was doomed the great armies
[1:51:21] of hell was marching on will trained and
[1:51:24] in their ranks every man to his place
[1:51:26] they backed Adams children into a corner
[1:51:28] where they could go no further
[1:51:30] they sent the law they couldn't keep it
[1:51:32] they sent judgments they wouldn't listen
[1:51:34] to it they plunged right on they sent
[1:51:36] prophets and they stoned them nothing
[1:51:38] could be done but in glory one day the
[1:51:41] most precious thing of heaven stepped
[1:51:43] out before the angels of God and said
[1:51:45] this day I will give my life for the
[1:51:48] sons of Adam this day I will do
[1:51:50] something that will break the ranks of
[1:51:52] the enemy I'm so glad that than when
[1:51:55] there was no hope for me he said this
[1:51:56] day I'll step up for you
[1:51:58] this day I'll break the hold of the
[1:52:00] enemy upon your life this day I'm gonna
[1:52:02] step forward this day I'll give my life
[1:52:05] and it says I can just see him go to the
[1:52:07] door Satan walked to the door and said
[1:52:10] so you finally got here did you yes I'm
[1:52:12] here I thought I had you when I killed
[1:52:15] Abel I was sure I had you when I threw
[1:52:17] Daniel in the lion's den when I behead
[1:52:19] it John I thought I had you when you was
[1:52:21] on the cross I thought I had you but
[1:52:24] finally you've arrived this is clearly a
[1:52:26] case of him not realizing what he was
[1:52:29] getting this was clearly a case of him
[1:52:32] not realizing what he was in for because
[1:52:35] this idiot celebrating the fact that his
[1:52:38] kingdoms just been destroyed he's

[1:52:42] the greatest whoopin anybody has ever
[1:52:44] taken in the history of the world he is
[1:52:47] celebrating the fact that he just

[1:52:58] glad you're here look that's what I'm

[1:53:28] on the cross and it paid for that sin
[1:53:30] yes sir I come down to take over give me

[1:53:36] the keys from death and he'll said give

[1:53:49] Satan by the neck threw him on the

[1:55:33] [Music]
[1:55:35] I'm not sure how well versed y'all are
[1:55:38] on civics but this is not a democracy
[1:55:41] this is a monarchy which is ruled by a
[1:55:44] king and the King makes the decision and
[1:55:46] the King says you're sealed the King
[1:55:49] says you're saved the King says I have
[1:55:51] forgiven you the King says I have healed
[1:55:53] you the key says you can go free the
[1:55:55] King says you don't have to be in
[1:55:56] bondage anymore Satan doesn't get a vote
[1:55:59] about your life there's only one vote
[1:56:02] there's only one voice there's only one
[1:56:04] that matters and he says you're free
[1:56:05] this morning
[1:56:06] he says you're victorious this morning
[1:56:08] he says you're an overcomer this morning
[1:56:10] and he's the only one that matters it's
[1:56:14] the only voice that matters passed down
[1:56:17] the lies of Satan cast down those lies
[1:56:20] his vote doesn't count
[1:56:23] it's voter fraud

[1:56:29] is a monarchy and our King says you're
[1:56:32] saved and you will remain blessed be the
[1:56:35] name of the Lord you will stand true you
[1:56:45] are going to overcome because every time
[1:56:48] Satan tries to put something on you our
[1:56:50] God is right there to give us the
[1:56:52] strength we need to overcome it listen
[1:56:55] his plans mean nothing when the Lord has
[1:56:57] other plans
[1:56:57] Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan has
[1:57:00] desired to have you that he may sift you
[1:57:02] as wheat there's his plans but I have
[1:57:07] prayed for thee that thy faith fail not
[1:57:09] oh man how wholesome he prayed for it
[1:57:12] for Peter I wish he had prayed for me he
[1:57:14] did he prayed for you even in several
[1:57:17] places in scripture Luke 22 excuse me
[1:57:19] John 17 I pray for them
[1:57:22] I pray not for the world but for them
[1:57:24] which thou has given me for they are
[1:57:26] thine well he was talking about the
[1:57:28] disciples okay I'll give you that verse
[1:57:30] 20 neither pray I for these alone but
[1:57:33] for them also which shall believe on me
[1:57:36] through their word
[1:57:37] he has prayed for you Satan has desired
[1:57:39] to sift you as wheat but my God has
[1:57:41] prayed for you and I'm telling you Jesus
[1:57:44] didn't pray a prayer that wasn't going
[1:57:46] to be answered if he prayed a prayer I
[1:57:48] guarantee you you can count on it he has
[1:57:51] prayed for you you will stand you will
[1:57:53] remain because you belong to him Satan
[1:57:58] has been thwarted at every single turn
[1:58:07] they don't give up and here we are in
[1:58:10] his Eden and once again he's being
[1:58:12] thwarted by the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:58:14] he's being thwarted by little ladies
[1:58:17] saying I'm gonna press on he's being
[1:58:19] thwarted by somebody when Satan says I
[1:58:21] will destroy you says your words don't
[1:58:23] matter to me
[1:58:24] well you're sick your words don't matter
[1:58:26] to me you're gonna take this depression
[1:58:27] I will not take that depression because
[1:58:30] we stand and we remain see what Satan
[1:58:34] says hold zero wait let me show you in
[1:58:35] the scriptures Isaiah seven and five
[1:58:37] because Syria Ephraim and the son of
[1:58:41] Romania have taken evil counsel against
[1:58:44] them they've taken evil counsel against
[1:58:46] it let us go up against Judah and vex it
[1:58:49] try to make them be vexed and let us
[1:58:53] make a breach therein for us and set a
[1:58:55] king in the midst of it even the son of
[1:58:58] Tibia thus saith the Lord God it shall
[1:59:02] not stand neither
[1:59:06] shall it come to pass all these plans
[1:59:09] they made to go up in vex Judah and they
[1:59:11] get all these people together and we're
[1:59:13] gonna do this and we're gonna take evil
[1:59:14] counsel thus saith the Lord God it shall
[1:59:18] not stand
[1:59:19] neither shall it come to pass Satan said
[1:59:21] you're not going to make it he's going
[1:59:22] to destroy you your children go to hell
[1:59:24] I'm gonna bring you down to an early
[1:59:25] grave thus saith the Lord it shall not
[1:59:28] stand
[1:59:28] neither shall it come to pass Satan's
[1:59:31] whispering lies and telling you all
[1:59:32] these things it shall not stand neither
[1:59:35] shall it come to pass because I'm
[1:59:37] speaking to a people tonight this
[1:59:40] morning that shall remain from the very
[1:59:44] day of Pentecost Satan began his attacks
[1:59:46] destroying trying to destroy the Church
[1:59:48] of God I'm going to skip all these but
[1:59:50] what I had was quote after quote from
[1:59:53] each church age showing where the false
[1:59:55] vine would stand up against the true
[1:59:57] vine and try to destroy it and every
[1:59:59] time it would get so close it would get
[2:00:02] so close to there's only a sliver of
[2:00:03] light there's only a few left remaining
[2:00:06] and and early on in the church we see
[2:00:08] grievious wolves come in among the
[2:00:10] church because Satan has his plans false
[2:00:13] doctrines began being preached different
[2:00:15] trinity doctrines false baptism
[2:00:17] hierarchies set up to rule over the
[2:00:18] people and in each age you see that the
[2:00:21] deeds of the Nicolaitans and things down
[2:00:24] through the Ephesian and as and pergamon
[2:00:27] all the way down and each one and yet
[2:00:29] the seed would always remain true
[2:00:31] brother Brent says with so many
[2:00:33] dishonouring God turning him into three
[2:00:36] gods and changing his precious name to
[2:00:37] titles one would wonder if the signs and
[2:00:40] wonders that attend such a great name
[2:00:43] would still be visited amongst the
[2:00:45] people indeed those signs were modely
[2:00:48] and warned
[2:00:49] we manifested though certainly not in
[2:00:52] the false-9 there were men like Martin
[2:00:55] man who stood true were greatly used and
[2:00:59] God bore witness both by signs and
[2:01:01] wonders and gifts of the Holy Ghost that
[2:01:03] that name was still as effective as it
[2:01:06] always has been and ever will be when
[2:01:08] the Saints honor him through the word
[2:01:11] and through faith he says the name of
[2:01:14] Jesus is just as effective as it's
[2:01:17] always been
[2:01:18] regardless today of your circumstance if
[2:01:20] you're willing to stand the name of
[2:01:22] Jesus is still effective when you're
[2:01:25] willing to remain the name of Jesus is
[2:01:28] still effective if you're willing to
[2:01:30] honor the name of Jesus and stand for
[2:01:32] truth God and the Spirit of God will
[2:01:34] move in your life the Spirit of God will
[2:01:37] move in our church if you're willing to
[2:01:39] stand for what Malachi 4 was sent to do
[2:01:42] Malachi 4 was sent to turn our hearts
[2:01:44] back to the original Pentecostal fathers
[2:01:46] there's many people today that are
[2:01:48] fighting against going back to that and
[2:01:50] they don't want to see those things move
[2:01:51] they don't want to see the spirit move
[2:01:53] they don't want to see the signs they
[2:01:54] don't want to see to see the wonders but
[2:01:56] if you're willing to stand for it you'll
[2:01:58] see those things move in our church and
[2:02:00] in your home individually and in your
[2:02:02] own in your own personal life and when
[2:02:05] our heart has turned back to the
[2:02:06] original Pentecost so so why then don't
[2:02:08] some see the moving of the Spirit why
[2:02:11] don't some believe in the moving of the
[2:02:13] Spirit because they haven't remained
[2:02:15] with what the word said about it they go
[2:02:19] to church they're religious but they
[2:02:21] haven't remained Judas remained until it
[2:02:27] was time to go to Pentecost and then he
[2:02:30] remained where he was he couldn't remain
[2:02:33] on the journey all the way up to
[2:02:34] Pentecost and listen while brother
[2:02:36] Branham had identifies the Judas spirit
[2:02:38] and that spirit of Judas will come right
[2:02:41] up and believe the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:02:44] like Jesus said the Devils believe in
[2:02:47] tremble he'll come right up and teach
[2:02:50] sanctification just as pure a holy life
[2:02:55] as it can be the Judas spirit will live
[2:02:59] just as pure
[2:03:00] and holy life as can be that's a
[2:03:04] shocking statement but listen but when
[2:03:08] it comes to the baptism of the Holy
[2:03:10] Ghost and the gifts of the Spirit he'll
[2:03:14] deny it and show his true colors every
[2:03:17] time brother Brennan said there's that
[2:03:20] spirit there's that spirit of Judas you
[2:03:24] have to remain with the word in every
[2:03:26] aspect I'm not saying every single
[2:03:29] person in this church has to run around
[2:03:30] the church shout and jump and speak in
[2:03:32] tongues we're not all wired that way
[2:03:34] we're not all gifted that way that's not
[2:03:36] what we're preaching we're not preaching
[2:03:37] emotionalism what we are preaching is a
[2:03:40] willingness to let God move how he sees
[2:03:42] fit a willingness to say God if that's
[2:03:45] how you want to move I by no means I'm
[2:03:48] going to get in the way I by no means
[2:03:50] I'm gonna try to put the brakes on I'm
[2:03:52] not going to be a spiritual fire
[2:03:54] extinguisher and sit there and try to
[2:03:56] quench everything going on in the church
[2:03:57] I want to remain true to what your word
[2:04:00] says and the word says those gifts will
[2:04:02] be amongst believers so lord I believe
[2:04:04] there amongst our congregation and when
[2:04:06] you want to use them Lord I'm ready to
[2:04:08] see you use them Lord if there's a gift
[2:04:10] in me that I'm not using Lord I want to
[2:04:12] use it lord I want to be willing and and
[2:04:15] malleable to do whatever it is you want
[2:04:18] to do that's what we're preaching a
[2:04:20] willingness to allow God to move and if
[2:04:23] we've learned anything
[2:04:24] God's will is going to be done
[2:04:26] regardless so you don't want to stand on
[2:04:29] the tracks when the train's coming
[2:04:31] because it's going to happen one way or
[2:04:33] the other and you want to be on the
[2:04:35] train not getting run over by the train
[2:04:39] make sure you're on the right side like
[2:04:41] brother Branham said when those people
[2:04:43] were dancing in his church and he said I
[2:04:45] thought they're gonna make my church
[2:04:46] into a tavern and he was going to say
[2:04:48] something but then he didn't and he said
[2:04:50] because what if they're right the
[2:04:53] Prophet said what if they're right and
[2:04:57] we need to take that approach sometimes
[2:04:59] when we criticize because if you are
[2:05:01] criticizing and they are right you're
[2:05:04] not criticizing them
[2:05:06] you're criticizing the moving of the
[2:05:08] holy spirit and the word speaks very
[2:05:10] bluntly indirectly about the punishment
[2:05:12] for that so hold your peace and hold
[2:05:14] your tongue when something maybe you
[2:05:16] don't understand because maybe they're
[2:05:19] right
[2:05:20] we move on so what about now we've
[2:05:24] talked about down through the ages we've
[2:05:26] talked about how the three Hebrew
[2:05:28] children stood how Daniel stood how
[2:05:29] Jesus came right at the moment of
[2:05:31] darkness but what about now
[2:05:34] Satan's Eden what about you down through
[2:05:38] every age Satan has waged a war and in
[2:05:40] every age someone has stood and every
[2:05:44] age despite the odds someone stood when
[2:05:46] it looked hopeless someone stood people
[2:05:49] would give their lives people will be
[2:05:50] burned at the stake people would stand
[2:05:52] no matter what nothing can move them off
[2:05:54] their testimony and because of that
[2:05:57] those people will be there I know we're
[2:05:59] talking about today those who are alive
[2:06:01] and remain but there are many of people
[2:06:03] that have gone by the way of the grade
[2:06:04] and they remained they remain true and
[2:06:07] because of that they're going to be
[2:06:09] there and their reward will be just as
[2:06:10] great brother Branham says what
[2:06:12] difference does it make if I'm living
[2:06:14] here or if I'm buried out yonder for if
[2:06:17] I'm already for I am already paid the
[2:06:20] penalty of death I'll be there before
[2:06:22] any man that's living that's right I say
[2:06:25] this 2nd Thessalonians 5th chapter I say
[2:06:27] this to you in the commandment of the
[2:06:29] Lord we which are alive and remain to
[2:06:31] the coming of the Lord shall not hinder
[2:06:33] or prevent those that are asleep for the
[2:06:35] trumpet of God shall sound and the dead
[2:06:36] in Christ shall rise first so what
[2:06:38] difference does it make if I died in the
[2:06:40] time of Noah if I died in the time of
[2:06:43] Abraham if I died in the time of the
[2:06:45] Apostles or if I died two weeks ago or
[2:06:47] if I died right now what difference
[2:06:50] would it make
[2:06:51] I'll be there in a moment in a twinkling
[2:06:54] of an eye so even those that go by the
[2:06:56] way of the grave we know those
[2:06:58] testimonies of the people even within
[2:06:59] our own church that have gone and we can
[2:07:01] look at and say they remained they
[2:07:03] remain true they stood strong and we
[2:07:05] know they're going to be there and
[2:07:06] they're gonna be the ones that we even
[2:07:07] see before our bodies are changed but
[2:07:10] now those people have stood those people
[2:07:12] have remained and now it's our turn now
[2:07:14] it's our turn to stand and our battle is
[2:07:17] not going to be a flowery bed of ease
[2:07:19] no like I said early on that we've
[2:07:20] reached the height of Satan's Kingdom
[2:07:22] and I know the odds don't look good when
[2:07:25] we look around we see 200 million demons
[2:07:29] released from the river Euphrates we see
[2:07:32] the most evil age ever upon the face of
[2:07:34] the earth but the word said he was
[2:07:36] coming back for someone who is alive and
[2:07:39] remain so someone is going to remain in
[2:07:42] this evil day and as we've seen down
[2:07:44] through the ages it doesn't really
[2:07:46] matter how evil it is and it doesn't
[2:07:48] matter how dark the night when God is
[2:07:50] determined to do something it's going to
[2:07:52] happen so someone is going to over come
[2:07:54] to him that overcometh will I grant that
[2:07:57] means somebody's going to overcome
[2:07:58] somebody will remain because that's who
[2:08:00] he's coming back for and it's going to
[2:08:02] be those that are the seed of Abraham
[2:08:03] it's those that have been quickened to
[2:08:05] life and I'm preaching to you this
[2:08:06] morning because I believe that's who you
[2:08:08] are he said I'm gonna have a church
[2:08:10] without spotted wrinkle and he said that
[2:08:13] church would remain and I'm telling you
[2:08:16] tonight God's Word will be fulfilled
[2:08:19] that's not something to debate that's
[2:08:21] not something to argue about that's a
[2:08:23] fact Satan has tried from the beginning
[2:08:26] to stop the fulfillment of God's Word
[2:08:28] and from what I can tell it never really
[2:08:30] seems to work out well for him all right
[2:08:32] look at Israel over there if you want to
[2:08:33] talk about odds how do they stand there
[2:08:35] there's no reason for Israel to exist
[2:08:38] there's no reason logically for them to
[2:08:41] exist they have endured hardship like no
[2:08:43] other nation they have been endured
[2:08:46] Holocaust they have endured hatred they
[2:08:48] have endured attacks they are surrounded
[2:08:50] literally on every side that by people
[2:08:53] that want them to die and yet they
[2:08:55] remain because they're God's people and
[2:08:57] yet they remain because it's God's plan
[2:09:00] they remain because it's God's will and
[2:09:02] that's the exact same thing that goes
[2:09:04] for you today why are you even here
[2:09:06] against all odds here you stand in
[2:09:08] Laodicea against all odds when you're
[2:09:11] surrounded by 200 million demons why are
[2:09:13] they even still standing why are they
[2:09:15] even still here how is it even possible
[2:09:17] because you're God's people and it's
[2:09:19] God's will for you to be here it's God's
[2:09:22] plan that you would stand and nothing
[2:09:24] can come against that it's God's plan
[2:09:27] and if it's God's plan if God's on our
[2:09:29] side then nothing
[2:09:30] is going to deter that plan then odds
[2:09:33] don't matter numbers don't matter I will
[2:09:36] remain you I'm talking to you now
[2:09:41] against all odds stand here today and
[2:09:45] overcome her because it's God's plan
[2:09:48] look I'm preaching to a bunch of Caleb's
[2:09:51] today people that have stood and an
[2:09:54] enduring hardships you've stood when
[2:09:57] everybody else fell away and died in the
[2:09:59] wilderness you stood through trials and
[2:10:01] tribulations you stood through tests
[2:10:03] that many of us maybe could never even
[2:10:05] imagine we wouldn't even want to go
[2:10:07] through some of the things you've gone
[2:10:09] through you may not want to go some of
[2:10:10] the things that we've gone through we've
[2:10:11] all gone through so much but we're
[2:10:13] kaleb's at the end of the day here we
[2:10:16] stand through it all I still remain
[2:10:18] through it all I'm still sharpening my
[2:10:20] sword through it all I'm still saying
[2:10:22] give me my Mountain through it all I'm
[2:10:24] still saying give me my children through
[2:10:26] it all I'm still saying give me my
[2:10:27] healing through it all I'm still saying
[2:10:29] give me my new body
[2:10:30] give me my rapture give me my victory
[2:10:33] because I'm a caleb there's something
[2:10:35] within me that will not back down
[2:10:37] there's something within me that won't
[2:10:38] quit there's something within me that
[2:10:40] sisterís remained
[2:10:41] just remain keep pressing home then why
[2:10:44] do we listen to the devil's whisperers
[2:10:49] I'm going to ask that as we begin to
[2:10:51] bring this down why do we listen to the
[2:10:54] devil's whisper we've seen down through
[2:10:57] the ages he's Thornton he's Thornton
[2:10:59] he's Thornton in your life how many
[2:11:01] times have you seen it he's been
[2:11:02] thwarted
[2:11:03] he's been thwarted he tried to destroy
[2:11:05] you he's been through it he tried to do
[2:11:06] this he's been thwarted and in
[2:11:08] situations right now where it seems like
[2:11:10] he's executing a plan to perfection let
[2:11:13] me remind you he does not dictate the
[2:11:15] outcome let me remind you that that
[2:11:18] battle is not over and just because it
[2:11:20] looks right now that he's in control of
[2:11:22] the situation he does not control the
[2:11:24] outcome it will turn out for your good
[2:11:27] it will turn out for God's plan so why
[2:11:31] do we listen to his whisper you you've
[2:11:33] seen the anchor hold down through the
[2:11:35] ages you've seen it hold in your life
[2:11:37] look if we based it off of odd you say
[2:11:40] these odds aren't good if we based it
[2:11:41] off we wouldn't even be here to begin
[2:11:43] with
[2:11:44] is not about odds it's about if God be
[2:11:47] for us who can be against us you
[2:11:51] shouldn't be here and yet you are and to
[2:11:53] me I believe within my heart that it
[2:11:55] absolutely torments the devil that we're
[2:11:57] still here I think it absolutely drives
[2:12:00] him crazy that he can't make you fall
[2:12:02] but I'm telling you today that Satan's
[2:12:04] temptation is not stronger than God's
[2:12:06] election Satan's temptation is not
[2:12:09] stronger than God's election Satan's
[2:12:12] Eden will not overcome God's
[2:12:14] predestination
[2:12:15] I believe that predestinated seed will
[2:12:17] overcome the flesh every single time
[2:12:20] your flesh may be rising up and that's
[2:12:22] where Satan's attacking that's what he's
[2:12:24] pointing at but his temptation cannot
[2:12:26] overcome God's election and because of
[2:12:29] that you're going to remain but Satan
[2:12:31] continues to war and I call him the
[2:12:33] Whisperer he's always whispering in here
[2:12:35] here he's always whispering and there's
[2:12:38] a battle raging at all times there's
[2:12:40] been a battle raging in some of your
[2:12:42] minds even during this service raging
[2:12:44] for the minds of men there's depression
[2:12:46] and anxiety and fear listen he tells you
[2:12:49] you're not going to make it look he's
[2:12:52] been telling you some of you he's been
[2:12:54] telling you that you're going to quit
[2:12:55] and that you're not going to make it for
[2:12:57] the last 30 years and yet he's been
[2:13:03] telling you you're going to give up he's
[2:13:07] been telling you you're going to quit
[2:13:08] when are we going to quit giving
[2:13:10] credence to what he says because what
[2:13:12] his plans are for you don't matter
[2:13:14] Satan is 2019 and here I stand it's 2019
[2:13:20] and I ain't going anywhere it's 2019
[2:13:24] it's evil everywhere but I have a God
[2:13:27] who stands beside me and I will remain
[2:13:31] I will not quit I will not back down I

[2:18:33] a corner he loves to talk to you when
[2:18:35] when he's seen you struggling in the
[2:18:37] night he loves to talk to you when he
[2:18:40] sees you go through a little cold spell

[2:19:17] there's no help for you in God there's
[2:19:20] no help for you but something whispers
[2:19:22] deep down in your soul says but Thou O
[2:19:25] Lord or a shield for me you're the glory
[2:19:30] and the lifter of my head and the devil
[2:19:33] sitting over there on your shoulder
[2:19:34] having a good time not realizing that

[2:19:37] inside of you
[2:19:38] something's starting to well up he don't
[2:19:40] realize he's no more into an ambush and
[2:19:42] he's sitting there thinking he's having
[2:19:44] a good time you're not gonna make it
[2:19:45] there's no help for you and God but Thou
[2:19:47] O Lord are a shield for me the glory and
[2:19:51] the lifter of my head and he's sitting
[2:19:54] there and I say we catch the devil off
[2:19:55] guard a little bit this morning in a day
[2:19:57] that he thinks not I say we begin to
[2:19:59] worship the Lord and we begin to praise
[2:20:01] the Lord and we say Lord you're the
[2:20:03] lifter of my head Lord lift up my head
[2:20:06] from my sorrows lift up my head from
[2:20:08] looking at the trouble and you begin to
[2:20:10] praise and you begin to worship and you
[2:20:12] begin to lift up the king of kings and
[2:20:13] the Lord of lords and you begin to say
[2:20:15] thank you Lord that I'm still standing
[2:20:17] in 2019 thank you Lord that I can't fail
[2:20:20] thank you for saving me thank you for
[2:20:22] healing me thank you for giving me the
[2:20:24] baptism of the Holy Ghost and as you
[2:20:26] begin to praise the Spirit of God begins
[2:20:28] to move and it begins to lift up your
[2:20:30] head and you're no longer seeing your
[2:20:32] failures and your faults but you lift up
[2:20:34] your head and you say I will remain I
[2:20:37] will stand I will press on because he's
[2:20:41] been so good to me he's done so much for
[2:20:43] me how can I not stand for him he's the
[2:20:47] glory and the lifter of your head let
[2:20:51] the Spirit of God begin to move in your
[2:20:53] life begin to praise him in a moment
[2:20:55] when the devil thinks not in a moment
[2:20:57] when he thinks he's got you bound down
[2:20:58] and beat down just let your voice come
[2:21:00] out and say thank you Jesus thank you

[2:21:18] walls fall

[2:21:22] that's not scriptural
[2:21:23] Joshua praised him then the walls fell
[2:21:25] Paul and Silas began to praise and then
[2:21:28] the chains fell off you want to have
[2:21:30] some freedom you want to have some joy

[2:21:42] the walls will fall then the chains will
[2:21:44] come off you have a part to play I'm
[2:21:49] bringing this to a close
[2:21:50] I'm skipping to the end Church in the
[2:21:55] evil time if you stand for him he will
[2:22:00] stand for you when no retreat is an
[2:22:04] option when your attitude is victory or
[2:22:07] death then he'll stand for you let us
[2:22:11] not forget who we serve we serve a God
[2:22:14] of War I do believe he's the God of
[2:22:18] peace within our souls and he brings us
[2:22:20] that peace but when your enemy in camps
[2:22:22] about you he is a God of War I believe
[2:22:26] in Hebrews 13:8 I believe he's the same
[2:22:28] yesterday today and forever and if we
[2:22:31] believe that let's look at Exodus 15 and
[2:22:33] 2 I can see the children of Israel
[2:22:37] standing at the Red Sea knowing that not
[2:22:42] all of them had came out some of them
[2:22:44] we're still in Egypt I can hear the
[2:22:47] whispers Satan was whispering in their
[2:22:48] heart I've told you you should have
[2:22:50] stayed they got all them garlic pots and
[2:22:54] they're eating real good and you about
[2:22:55] to dine this the ocean you stupid
[2:23:00] while you following this guy anyway and
[2:23:03] he's got the stick
[2:23:05] he's got stick I mean look at you good
[2:23:08] decision good call you decide to leave
[2:23:10] all that and here you are and now you're
[2:23:13] gonna die dummy I know you laugh but
[2:23:19] sometimes the devil tells you some funny
[2:23:21] stuff he says some stuff to me before
[2:23:23] that I was like really do you for real
[2:23:27] right now I was dumb and then sometimes
[2:23:33] he tells you things that makes you think
[2:23:36] and he's sitting there whispering to him
[2:23:38] you're gonna die look at the odds look
[2:23:44] at Pharaoh's army there's nowhere for
[2:23:47] you to go sometimes we feel that way but
[2:23:53] in the time of trouble he will hide you
[2:23:56] in his pavilion at the very last moment
[2:23:59] he's gonna snatch us out of here and
[2:24:01] he's gonna take us in a rapture the odds
[2:24:04] don't matter we serve a God of War
[2:24:07] Exodus 15 - they're backed up against
[2:24:11] the Red Sea there's nowhere to go and
[2:24:13] according to the enemy they're about to
[2:24:15] die the Lord is my strength and song and
[2:24:18] he has become my salvation he is my god
[2:24:22] and I will prepare him a habitation my
[2:24:25] father's God and I will exalt him the
[2:24:29] Lord is a man of war the Lord is his
[2:24:33] name no matter the situation you're in
[2:24:35] this morning hold on to this Pharaoh's
[2:24:38] chariots and his hosts has he cast into
[2:24:41] the sea his chosen captains are also
[2:24:43] drowned in the Red Sea the depths have
[2:24:46] covered them they sank into the bottom
[2:24:49] as a stone that right hand O Lord has
[2:24:51] become glorious in power my right hand O
[2:24:54] Lord have dashed in pieces the enemy and
[2:24:57] in the greatness of mine excellency thou
[2:24:59] has overthrown them that rose up against
[2:25:01] thee now sin is forth my wrath which
[2:25:04] consumed them as stubble and with the
[2:25:06] blast of thine nostrils the waters were
[2:25:08] gathered together in the flood stood
[2:25:09] upright as a heap and the
[2:25:11] depths were congealed in the heart of
[2:25:13] the sea the enemy said I will pursue I
[2:25:15] will overtake I will divide this ball my
[2:25:18] lust shall be satisfied upon them I will
[2:25:21] draw my sword my hand shall destroy them
[2:25:24] let's look once again his plans don't
[2:25:26] matter his plans for your life mean
[2:25:29] nothing
[2:25:30] these are his plans here's what he's
[2:25:32] going to do to you he's going to pursue
[2:25:34] he's going to overtake his hand shall
[2:25:37] destroy you
[2:25:38] but thou dis blow with I wind the sea
[2:25:40] covered them they sank as led in the
[2:25:43] muddy waters who is like under the old
[2:25:45] Lord among the gods who is like the
[2:25:48] glorious in holiness fearful and praises
[2:25:50] doing wonders now stretches out that
[2:25:52] right hand the earth swallowed them thou
[2:25:55] and thy mercies had led forth the people
[2:25:57] which thou hast redeemed thou has guided
[2:25:59] them and not strengthened to the holy
[2:26:01] habitation the people shall fear and be
[2:26:04] afraid sorrow shall take hold of the
[2:26:07] inhabitants of Palestina then the dukes
[2:26:09] of Edom shall be amazed and the mighty
[2:26:12] men of Moab trembling shall take hold
[2:26:14] upon them all the habitants of Canaan
[2:26:16] shall melt away fear and dread shall
[2:26:19] fall upon them in the greatness of that
[2:26:21] arm shall they shall be as still as a
[2:26:23] stone till thy people pass over Oh Lord
[2:26:27] till the people pass over which thou has
[2:26:30] purchased until we go in a rapture he's
[2:26:33] going to hold it back until we leave
[2:26:35] here the people that he has purchased
[2:26:37] thou shalt bring them in and plant them
[2:26:39] in the mountain of mine inheritance in
[2:26:41] the place o Lord which thou has made for
[2:26:44] thee to dwell in in the sanctuary O Lord
[2:26:46] which thy hands have established the
[2:26:48] Lord shall reign forever and ever
[2:26:51] that's my god that's who I serve the
[2:26:55] enemy said I will destroy them and they
[2:26:57] sink to the bottom of the ocean like lid
[2:26:59] and he says and I will keep them at bay
[2:27:02] until I take you over and establish you
[2:27:05] in the mountain of your inheritance
[2:27:07] Church we shall remain we shall not be
[2:27:13] moved like a tree planted by the water
[2:27:16] we're going to stand there
[2:27:17] we're going to be strong and no matter
[2:27:19] what comes we shall remain and done with
[2:27:26] my notes I want to close with this
[2:27:28] little story musicians you can come I
[2:27:35] had to skip a lot because well I'm slow
[2:27:40] sorry they pick on me and call me
[2:27:43] long-winded and I guess when I was I was
[2:27:49] thinking about the star-spangled banner
[2:27:54] and I was studying and and I was
[2:27:57] thinking about Fort McHenry and Francis
[2:28:00] Scott Key and you know Francis Scott Key
[2:28:02] had went out to a British ship to try to
[2:28:05] negotiate the release of his friend who
[2:28:08] had been taken prisoner and actually his
[2:28:10] tactics work and the British agreed to
[2:28:13] release them but because they had
[2:28:17] knowledge of the impending attack they
[2:28:20] wouldn't release him until the battle
[2:28:21] was over they said you're gonna have to
[2:28:23] stay here and they actually let him
[2:28:25] return to their own ship but under
[2:28:28] watchful eye of the British ship and
[2:28:31] Francis Scott Key their PIN words that
[2:28:36] became very famous to us we know it as
[2:28:39] the star-spangled banner but he would
[2:28:41] write later on he said it seemed as
[2:28:42] though Mother Earth had opened and was
[2:28:46] vomiting shot and shell in a sheet of
[2:28:49] fire and brimstone
[2:28:51] sounds like the day we live in all hell
[2:28:55] had opened up fire and brimstone it was
[2:28:58] a it was a marvelous and yet terrifying
[2:29:00] sight as he sit there and watch he would
[2:29:04] write but when darkness arrived he can
[2:29:07] only see red erupting in the night given
[2:29:11] the scale of the attack he was certain
[2:29:13] the British would win and the hours pass
[2:29:16] slowly but in the clearing smoke of
[2:29:19] dawn's early light Church I know
[2:29:23] different things excite different people
[2:29:26] but when I was reading this and this
[2:29:28] thought was coming to me
[2:29:30] how to run away I was thinking about all
[2:29:35] the saints down through time in the
[2:29:36] grandstands looking over the banister
[2:29:38] and I was thinking about down through
[2:29:41] the church ages every now and then
[2:29:43] there'd be a flash of light where the
[2:29:47] brown described it even as a roman
[2:29:48] candle there'd be a flash of light and
[2:29:51] they would say they're still there
[2:29:53] they're still there they're still
[2:29:56] standing and it'd go dark oh they're
[2:30:02] still there they're still a people
[2:30:04] remaining
[2:30:05] they're still the people standing for
[2:30:07] truth did you see that did you see that
[2:30:12] Martin's age they're still standing and
[2:30:16] then a prophet would come on the scene
[2:30:19] and Laodicea light did you see that that
[2:30:26] was the biggest burst of light we've
[2:30:27] ever seen oh my that was glorious
[2:30:30] [Music]
[2:30:31] but now here we are 42 years into the
[2:30:35] hour of darkness 42 years passed 1977 42
[2:30:40] years passed the time were it was so
[2:30:41] dark the prophet of God couldn't see
[2:30:43] past and they're looking are they still
[2:30:47] there are they still holding on there's
[2:30:52] got to be somebody
[2:30:53] there's got to be somebody down there so
[2:30:55] dark it's so dark
[2:30:58] Oh but in dawn's early light on that
[2:31:04] bright morning when the victory in the
[2:31:24] flag waves high from the walls we didn't
[2:31:28] surrender we didn't give in we stood in
[2:31:32] the darkness night we stood we shall
[2:31:35] remain we won't give in on that
[2:31:40] brightened clown this morning they're
[2:31:42] gonna see you they're gonna see you
[2:31:47] Oh God let me remain this morning let me
[2:31:51] stay true against all odds let me stay
[2:31:54] true another scarf and turn away I want
[2:31:57] to remain blessed be the name of the
[2:32:00] Lord I will remain thank you Lord Jesus
[2:32:13] how we love you Lord Jesus how we thank
[2:32:17] you Lord for the Spirit of God that's
[2:32:18] giving us the strength to hold on to
[2:32:21] remain in this last day so we will not
[2:32:25] back up Lord today the line in the sand
[2:32:28] driven drawn by the Holy Spirit we see
[2:32:31] it clearly and we choose to step over
[2:32:32] and say we shall remain how we love you
[2:32:38] how we thank you Lord God for all that
[2:32:40] you've done for us we commit it all into
[2:32:43] your hands and we thank you Lord God
[2:32:46] that by your power by your light we
[2:32:50] shall
