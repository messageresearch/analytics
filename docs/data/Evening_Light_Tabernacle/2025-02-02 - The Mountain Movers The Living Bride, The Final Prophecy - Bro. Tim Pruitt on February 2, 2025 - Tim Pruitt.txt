worst disease there is but I'll tell you what there is a God that is here this morning that can come and change the heart that can set it in the right direction amen that can that can inoculate you

today well it's Jesus on the inside working on the outside oh what a change in my life it's Jesus only inside working on the outside oh what a change in my my life where Let Jesus on the inside working on the outside oh what a change in my life and oh what a change in my life will it's Jesus on the inside working on the outside oh what a change in my life come on sing it now it's Jesus on the inside working on the outside oh what a change in my life where is Jesus on the inside working on the outside oh what a change in my life and no water change that's in my life let's give the Lord a hand clap of Praise hallelujah amen I'm glad to have him working on the inside amen but if he works on the inside he's got to bring this outside under control amen because he comes to live on the inside of you Revelation 10:1 for a scripture reading this morning pray for me I've been just a little bit under the weather since coming back from California but we're good today and going forward in the Lord we're going to be speaking on the living bride the final prophecy and as you notice our theme is on the mountains and movers and it comes from Zechariah 4 and seven who says who art thou a great Mountain Thou shalt become a Plaine and the headstone shall be for brought forth with shouting crying Grace Grace to it then Revelation 10:1 and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was up on his head and his face was as it were the Sun and he h and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his little hand the little book open and he set his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the earth and he cried with a loud voice and as when a lion roar and when he cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and then verse seven but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he's declared to his servants of prophets and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel that standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings amen God bless you going to let you take your seats if you will turn with me to First Corinthians chapter 15 we're going to read from the 51st verse 1 Corinthians chapter 15 verse 51 behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump that's not Donald Trump either at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this Mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptible shall I put on incorruption and this Mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory oh death where is thy sting oh grave where is thy Victory The Sting of death is sin the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you what a wonderful hour to be serving God I would I would rather live in this day than any day that there could be God has called us to a very very special time in this hour it's it's the day where that there is a bride who will be alive and remain at the coming of the Lord it'll also be the bride who will have the final prophecy and and you will see it here even is spoke of in in the the scripture and we didn't read it but in Revelation 10: 7 said in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God would be finished but yet as we see the finishing of the Mysteries and the coming down with the book we find that there is a final prophecy because she must prophesy again and so the final prophecy will be the bride's voice um the voice of God will be in her and it will be the final voice to the final age and of course we want to know what will be her message her message will be the resurrection message actually that is the message that Jesus had when he came it was his message of where he said I am the resurrection and the life and and so our message will be the same I I'm not dead but I am alive forever more never to go back to the tombs of religion and yet the message movement it will die and become a Mor and we go back to the tomb sealed there with Creeds but not the message the message will never die it will live on and neither will the bride die because she will not go down into death but the Bible tells us that I'm going to show you you mystery we are not going to all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye so you see the story of the Bride ends here upon the Earth with the with the spirit and the bride speaking in unison if you notice in Revelation 22:17 it says and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth come so if you if you see what what it is you see the spirit and the bride is speaking together it's the last voice amen it's the last voice before the change you see you see the bride speaks the same word as does the spirit she is a word bride proven she has the spirit she's not like vasai in the days of Esther who had her own feast and refuse to come to the Feast of the king but the bride is in harmony with the bridegroom and the spirit and the bride say come notice they are speaking in unison it is not one Speaking one thing and the other speaking something else but they're both saying the same thing the spirit and the bride say notice it's they are they are speaking together not a part now that's not always been with the church there's been many a time that the church world has spoke and it has not been in unison with the spirit the spirit was speaking one thing and the church was speaking something else but in this last day it is prophesied it is written in the Bible that there is be a people on Earth who will be saying the same thing that the spirit said the spirit and the bride say come now let me just tell you that call come if you'll just search it through the Book of Revelation you know it is the call for the Rapture amen Revelation 4 shows you at the end of the leoan age that there is a door open in heaven and a voice saying come up hither and I want you to know that's the call of the bridegroom coming through the Bride come come out of her my people be you separate sayeth the Lord come into the word be a part of that word take that book and eat it become one with it now I want you to understand that we must do the works that Jesus did Jesus said so John 14:12 The Works that I do shall you do also and so we must be those who fulfill the New Testament even as Jesus fulfilled the Old Testament amen so here we are at the the last day and we must do what Jesus did in his day and what Jesus was he was the voice of the Resurrection I want you to notice in John 11:24 you remember Lazarus had died he was in the Tomb she come to him and said Lord if you know our brother if you had have been here our brother would have lived and he see he said well he he will he will live he will rise again said and so in verse 24 she said Martha said to him I know he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day and Jesus said I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live amen so you see there no notice now I I want you to see the authority that was in his voice you see there was so much power within his voice had he not said Lazarus come forth then all the dead would have come forth but he you know again because that was the power that was in his voice the power was shown when he called Lazarus and he comes forth out of the Grave when he's been there 4 days amen and now notice Jesus before the resurrection he becomes the resurrection and he declares I am the resurrection and the life amen now so what happened in the groom must also happen in The Bride for the same word that speaks of the groom speaks also of the Bride so there must be a resurrection in the end time and Jesus was the resurrection and so here in this end time there must become a people that is become the revelation of the hour and if the Revelation the unfolding of the hour is the resurrection they must become the resurrection now you know that already because you've already experienced the resurrection is that right you were dead in sins and trespasses and you're given voice that you're no longer that dead thing amen that life that you once lived in the flesh you no longer live that anymore but you live by the faith of the Son of God notice so I want you to see this that there must be a people become the revelation of the hour that they can come to the point that they can say I am the resurrection I am the embodiment of the Resurrection Resurrection Life and resurrection power Works within me now for the spirit quickens my mortal body you know one time you lived in sin you know the life you lived but the Holy Spirit came to make you alive that's what the word quickens mean make you alive you were dead but now you're alive I said you were dead but now you're alive and it what's it do it quickens your mortal body you that you once wanted to live Unholy dirty lives have now been quickened to Holiness to righteousness to the power of God it brought a change in you amen now for the spirit now quickens your mortal body that that's a that's the evidence you've turned Heavenly now notice as we look at this we may wonder and Ponder well why is the bride his voice because in the Book of Revelation chapter 3 when it speaks of the leodan age he tells you very clearly that the church world has been spewed out of his mouth is that right because that you are lukewarm neither cold nor hot because you say I am rich and increased with goods and I have need of nothing yet you're miserable wretched blind naked and don't know it and he he goes on to say I will spew you out of my mouth now what's he talking about he means that the church is no longer his mouth piece they no longer speak for him it's his own mouthpiece amen I mean come on look at even what the church world says you know you just you just take a scripture or two just take First Corinthians 11 about what the scripture says Paul saying a woman should have uncut hair a man should should have cut hair and what would they say oh that don't apply to me so did she get from that she's her own mouth because she's no longer God's mouth I'm just taking a simple scripture what about water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ amen she becomes her own mouth or she'll say I'd rather do what Jesus said than what Peter said but I want you to understand that was Jesus speaking through Peter that was the Holy Ghost upon a man of God Amen that was the spirit of Jesus that had returned on the day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost amen the spirit of Christ and he had come and Peter there with the with the keys to the kingdom said repent every one of you here's the way to get in repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost but the church becomes its own mouthpiece so therefore it refuses what the word says so God is turning on her I I'm just giving you just a couple incidents I mean it's full of it in the scripture so God's turning on her he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of God will be in her amen you know here again we have a lot of debate about where the voice of God is but I want you to understand the seventh angel has sounded his message amen the mysteries of God are finished but where are we in this time you see we are in a time where the voice of God will be in The Bride for it says in that last chapter of of Revelation it said the spirit and the bride say come so once more and I'm quoting brother Brandon once more the world will hear direct from God as at Pentecost amen you see Jesus had went away his voice was no longer being preached through the man Jesus no longer was he on the seashore speaking the Beatitudes but now he was speaking in the form of a Ministry of a bride form come on and on the day of Pentecost his Spirit came in them and they became the voice of God for their age now I want you to understand of course they will repudiate that they'll deny it they'll turn it down but the voice of God is in the bride in leoda this church is peed out of God's mouth no longer speaks for him but the bride under their messeng under their messenger is the final voice for the final age I quote this from we would see Jesus he doesn't have any hands but ours he doesn't have any voice but ours how many knows that you mean some of you don't know that sure you do what do you say I'm the vine you're the branches the bran the vine doesn't bear the fruit it energizes the branch the branches bear the fruit it energizes the branches and and John 15 I'm the vine you're the branches we lay hands on the sick he uses our eyes to see Visions he he uses our lips to speak he uses us to pack the gospel it's given to his church and he's in his church manifests himself and the people can see him as he works in his church amen now so you see this is what he does he uses Ministry even as brother brandham tells us in the message look he said God could have chose to preach the gospel by the son by the Moon by the Stars by The Wind by nature but he chose men to preach the gospel amen and that's where the voice of God will come from men preaching the gospel you say well brother Tim then I won't have the voice of God because I'm not a preacher every one of you are the voice of God you everyone are preaching a sermon every one of you are given a life testimony are you with me so you are The Voice voice of God that is here in this age that is speaking out if you want to know what God thinks about the scripture amen it's going to be manifested in you is that right you want to think know what God thinks about Holiness it's going to be manifested it's going to be displayed it's going to be ministered in a bright body now so you see that's where the voice of God has come from of course you can judge whether it's the voice of God by whether it's according to the word cuz God can't be across contrary to his word notice as we look at this and I'm going to read again from the church age book Revelation 22:17 the spirit and the bride say come the corn of wheat the bride wheat that fell in the ground at NAA has come back to the original word grain again I love that she's come back to the Head she come back to the Capstone the finished praise God forever yes listen to the authenticated prophet of God who appears in this last stage what he says from God the bride will say and the spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing and what they say will have already been said in the word and they are saying it now now come and he says come out from among her and be you separate now you know that's Revelation 18 amen the cry is going out the cry is going out how long will the voice cry we don't know but one thing we know it won't be long cuz this is the last age so after this voice that cause the people to come up hither there will not be another voice to the Gentiles that's right they the prophet and the bride and the spirit say the same thing and they have the same message come come out and that's what we're saying we're saying come out of those tombs amen get rid of the restraints don't be bound down by ideas and Creeds of man throw off those chains come on Church it was the spirit that was in Jesus that broke the seals of the Tomb right it wasn't the Romans taking them off it was an external job it wasn't the disciples do it and we can't do it for you it's going to take a work of the holy spirit in ever life I'll tell you he'll break the chains of sin the Yoke of Darkness amen he will break every fed he will take the Creeds off of you and that's what we're trying to say in this day our call is come come yes come out of the Tomb come out of those restrictions come into the freedom of the Holy Spirit Come where the spirit of God is moving we're not talking about come to evening light Tabernacle we're talking about come out of the Tomb you know a lot of people you know have asked me about California so brother Tim you just went and preached to California don't them people believe the message why are they still there I don't think sometimes we hear what the word said that's right and the word never said leave California it said flee flee and run to the horns of the altar come out of that of that that sin that you're in and repent amen it you know I tell you what the it ain't going to matter where you are when the earthquake takes place if you're a Believer you're sealed in with God you'll go up with him but if you're not a Believer you're going to be left behind it's just that simple that's right it is not a physical location you got to be in it's in Christ you've got to be [Applause] in so we've got a lot of ideas a lot of times it is a physical place and even brother brandham was asked question answers 64 you know brother brandham should we all move here should we all go to tuon should we go some say go here some say he says get into Christ your physical location you can sit right here in this church and rot die right on the vine dry up right and be in the tombs bound down by sin say well Set Me Free this morning brother Tim no it's you that's got to invite him in and open the door and he will he will then break the seals off your life now so that's what we're saying come out of the tombs get rid of the restraints yes I know I know sometimes people get upset because we worship God and and we might shout or and and and get exuberant in our worship or dance in the spirit but we're just saying come out break the chains amen the things that's been holding you down break them get it where you're free in the spirit get it word that you can receive the word and it change your life and transform you now Jesus became the voice or the manifestation of the scriptures and so must the bride the voice of the word will be spoken through her the last prophecy I read it to you this morning Thou shalt prophesy again I I accentuated you again and and and with with Revelation 21 where he says the spirit of the Bride say come so the Jesus became the voice or the manifestation of the scripture and so must the bride the voice of the word will be spoken through her now watch what Jesus would say he would say some very peculiar things for example destroy this Temple and I'll raise it up again in three days now he's walking right among the temple the beautiful structures of uh of all of that you know the and and the disciples were showing him the wonders of the temple and Jesus pointed from there and he and he pointed to the to the real Temple God was no longer in that form of religion he was now in a person Jesus Christ and he said destroy this Temple and I'll raise it up again in three days well they said it was so many years that they took building this Temple how are you going to raise it up in three days but Jesus was talking about his own flesh you see why because he was to fulfill the scripture he said I will not leave his soul in Hell neither will I let my Holy One see corruption is't that wonderful scripture we know that corruption sets in in 72 hours so before 3 days he had to rise so he knew he would raise in 3 days cuz he could look in the scripture listen he looked at what was thought as a remote Psalm a forgotten neglected scripture but Jesus saw himself in it I want to ask you this morning can you see yourself in it it are you with me amen can you can you can you see yourself in can you see that he's not going to leave this bride in hell do you know do you know hell is about to to come through in this Dimension is pressing harder every day demons streaming loose everywhere Spirits like you've never seen evil horrible things going on in the world that we're living in worst time than ever before yes sir and do you know hell is about to be created on this Earth I can show you in Revelation CH 12 when the bride goes up Satan comes down that's right let me tell you he don't descend he's cast down right he says in Revelation 9 I saw this star fall from Heaven it was not a it was not a descending Christ descends but this one Falls and in Revelation 12 he shows he is cast down when as the bride goes up and so if he comes down then what's he going to do he has but a short time and he establishes his full Eden in that short three and a half years of tribulation you ain't seen nothing yet and you don't want to see that but God says okay come on come on into this Dimension bring all your kingdom and all your powers loose all your spirits and bring them right down into this last age because when I get you here I'm going to pull my bride out and then I'm going to pour out the vials of judgment upon the Earth and I'm going to plague the beast in his system and at the end Satan will be bound for a thousand years amen we we we're looking for restraints being put on the devil we're looking for a Time on the Earth where there'll be a millennial Reign and arrest for God's people but I want you to notice he said I will not leave his soul in hell that's right he ain't going to leave this briide here and he will not allow us to go down and Decay for he says neither shall my Holy One see corruption so don't you see no matter what's going on in this world you've got a you've got a promise of a scripture that you are part of a resurrection amen now Jesus was a fulfillment of types we could go through many of them but he would look back and he would see another obscure prophet and he would liking himself to him man by the name of Jonah and he said as Jonas is in the belly of the well three days and nights so will the son of the son of man be in the heart of the Earth you see he saw himself there he saw himself in that prophecy amen because he was a fulfilling of the type and we can look back to Jesus and see the bride and the groom but because Believe It or Not Jesus is your type he was foreshadowing a bride coming now you say but how do does that apply to me you know you just read about he'll not leave his soul in Hell or Holy One seek corruption well listen to this what about Jonas and the w three days restoration from the brigh tree just as he sure as he raised Jesus out of the Grave under three days under three dispensations or three sections he's going to raise the church to its fullness and power again and he said notice after three days of first treat talking about the groom restored as at the beginning having the same signs wonders Jesus come back the same Jesus doing the same things at the end of the third day the signs appeared not at the end of the first day brother I hope you're getting it at the third day is when the real manifestation of Christ was made known at the end of the third day notice not at the first day Day dead for the second day still dead Luther Wesley at the beginning of the third day there was a rumor around you know what was going on the Holy Spirit was being poured out at ausa Street there was a rumor going around and he said nothing on the first day that was Luther nothing on the second day that was Wesley and on the third day the dispensation of the Holy Spirit there was a rumor around that he was the same yesterday today and forever but at the end of the third day that's where he made himself manifest and made himself known come right back among them come among his people and said look at me I'm the same one Hallelujah do you realize there'll be a bride in this last day that'll say look at me I am the same one the one that went down 2,000 years ago amen that said that that the and was in the tombs of Luther and Wesley and still dead and distill forms and then there was a then there was a rumor that he's alive but at the end of the third day he shows and he says I'm the same Jesus I'm the same bride that I was at this beginning there's a people on earth going to be able to say that amen now so there were dead forms till they got to Pentecost then there was a rumor around that he was now here in this last day he's right with us moving right among us at the end of the third day he appeared and showed all of them his resurrection sign that he's living the same yesterday today and forever living fruits of his presence are you getting it was manifested at the end of the third day when he appeared to all of them his church why they got it all together then at the end of the third day and here he goes and some of them didn't get the message you know it seem like no matter how hard you try some people don't get the message no matter how hard you preach it some people didn't this don't click with them they go right along let me just take a minute on this Apollos was there a man a devout man a mighty preacher knowing only the baptism of John this is way over the book of Acts chapter 18 and and here he's preaching about John about God sending Elijah a book about God sending a message and he said the Messiah is here somewhere we don't know we don't know him now a't that strange he had been positively identified by the prophet and that's the world we're living in today there are many people still searching for a messiah they're looking here for this leader to raise up or this or this savior to come their world is falling apart and they're looking for somebody else with some great power to some great Charisma some great knowledge that will lead him higher because they don't recognize the one that was pointed to I want you to get this because God sent us an Elijah in this day and he told us the Messiah is here now it ain't him through it it ain't even a preacher that I can name it's the word it's the anointed word come on and he pointed us to the word and said here's your savior here's your Messiah here's the one that's going to save you in this last day I'm sending you a message of Deliverance but people miss it so they're always looking for somebody else to raise up some somebody with a shiny something and and here these men were they were in this very time and here apsis sincerely preaching and he's missed the very purpose of Elijah yet he can say I'm in the message man I tell you what he put that Jezebel in her place man yes he did he told old her herodes you know her wrong called her out called her out in the street and shot her she had her had his head cut off because of it he preached marriage and divorce my he was a mighty preacher and you talk about bringing high mountains down he did making low valleys and bringing them up making a level plane the plane's level but we're looking for the Messiah how many people are in that condition today that they have not yet seen who we were poed to Jesus Christ the anointed word did you get into Acts chapter 19 and some of his followers were there and Paul said okay you're Believers have you received the Holy Ghost and they said we hadn't even heard there is such a thing is the Holy Ghost what are you talking about listen these were followers of Elijah they believe the Forerunner but it not even received the baptism of the Holy Ghost they had missed the very purpose of him coming they missed the token itself they missed the very experience that would have introduced them and made the word real to them is't that amazing these people people were sitting on the church pews they weren bad people no doubt they were tithe payers and good members and maybe get the pat on the back from Good Old Apollos for being good good people they wern't Christians CU they didn't know Christ but here in John and and Paul said well how was you baptized well we got baptized by John he saidwell have you not heard to be baptized taken on the name of Jesus Christ have you not heard they said no we've not heard that and he baptized them all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and the Holy Ghost Came Upon them and they were filled with the spirit and they spoke in tongues and prophesied they had an experience when they begin to realize what the message was really all about somehow another we get confused we think the message is about a man the man is not the message the the message is is Christ that's who the message is amen the messenger is is a man and God uses him and God bless him and thanks be to God for him but if you never come to know Christ you've lost everything so he lifts real instructions about where he wanted his people to meet him after his resurrection he said go to the city of Jerusalem and wait there until you're endued with powerful on high don't go out and priest don't go have Divine Healing campaigns don't don't go start churches until you until you get endued with power from on high so you see he had a designated place he wanted them to meet them do you know there is a designated place that we are to meet him we are to meet him in the air we're in the world is the air it's that Dimension Between Heaven and Earth as he comes here and we go there amen and the blending of Dimension you're going to have to leave the Dominion of sin and dimension of sin that you're in you're going to have to rise up above that you're going to have to come into the dimension where all things are possible to them that believe so you see again he had a he has a designated place for us to meet him and that is to meet him in the air and there is it's a physical place we're going to go where we shall be changed but you know there were men going the opposite direction after all these instructions and even the angel coming back with an instruction go tell my disciples that I will meet them in Jerusalem go tell I mean here's the message from the angel and here are two men and they're going down the road to emus in the opposite direction how many times will people hear direct instructions from God and go the wrong direction and as they went they were talking about their unbelief they were talking about out how disappointed they were because things had not turned out the way they thought you know it's 2025 we thought it' been over a long time before they were walking along and saying you know um you know how could it how is it even possible that this wasn't the one how I mean my goodness he healed the sick he raised the dead and we we thought sure he would deliver Israel see they had the wrong expectations he certainly would deliver them but he would be their savior from their sins but here they're walk in the opposite direction after getting Divine instructions from God go to Jerusalem now they're going to amas but I want you to know just like Apollos just like those in Acts chapter 19 they were elect of God and God wasn't going to leave them squandering around in unbelief and I'm telling you what the Holy Spirit even today is going after those going in the wrong direction and you might be purposely going in the wrong direction but here you'll come walking among you and tell you where you are going wrong and say look it's been me it's been me it's been me all the way down from Genesis all the way down through revelation through the seven Church ages till now it's been me and he unfolded the scriptures concerning himself you know what they had to do he made like he would pass them by and they had to compel him come in with us comes up with us you want Jesus in your life you have to compel him you have to say Lord Don't Pass Me By come into my life come into my heart come into my being change me in your presence don't let whatever it is don't leave me where you found me don't let me keep walking on down to amus when I've been called to The Upper Room amen and may maybe we're not called to the upper room but we're called to the place we're going upward are you with me amen so here they here at there he he on the inside he showed them the sign of the Resurrection he did things like he did before you know if we want to see loved ones loss that are going the wrong direction we're going to have to let them see things that he did before he healed before he filled with the Holy Ghost before he opened the eyes of blind before I'm talking about spiritual blindness too amen he was a deliverer come on we got to have a living God he's got to show himself alive otherwise they have every right to give go in the wrong direction but notice remember he was the first fruits of those who slept even as the Old Testament remember we've been through it of the waving of the sheath and that was when the crops would come to harvest and before they could partake of it a sheep of grain was taken and would be waved before before the people and and so you know they waved before God actually and as as a sign as a great sign of the of the of that of the completion of the Harvest and so we remember he was the first fruits of the Old Testament and there even as the Old Testament type of the waving of the first ripen grain for the Harvest to be accepted by God even so as the priest were going that morning to the temple on the first day of the week at the same time Jesus rose from the dead as a fulfillment of that type think about that and then on the day of Pentecost which is seven weeks later representing seven Church ages Here Comes again another Shea waving because we come to another crop that was a the first was The Barley now this is the wheat and we come to the wheat Harvest where the wheat comes to Total maturity are you with me now listen there again then must be the waving of the sheath God picking up a group of people I want you I want you to get this and waving them before the world and says this is my bride and away he'll go with her now in the rising of the son brother Bron says as Christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth all so although typed in many places he was the first fruits of those that slept in the bride coming of Christ I want you to see this stop for a minute that's where we're at we're in the bride coming of who Christ 2,000 years he came in Groom form but in this day he comes in briide form and he must manifest himself completely in Bride form before a Rapture can take place so if you're looking for the great meeting in the air that's wonderful but it can't happen until there comes a bride who is manifested so I want you to see this in the coming to Christ coming out of the church there will be a sheath waved again at the last day what another first fruits waving of the sheath what was the Sheep the first to come to mature the first that proved it was a wheat that proved it was sheath Hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm talking about it was waved over the people and for the first time there will come forth for the bride age for a resurrection out of dark denomination nationalism get a picture now in 3 days it would rise come on starting with Luther Wesley ausa street but here at the end he would show himself alive notice for a resurrection where out of dark denominationalism Hallelujah will be a message that the full mat of the word has turned back again in his full power and is being waved over the People by the same signs and wonders that he did back there I don't know what you're expecting but this has to come to pass amen oh I can hear brother brandham say in 1963 if the church could only be in the Glorious presence of God someday God will turn loose his power into it and things will take place I don't know brother I don't know if you're ready for that but I'm ready for it I've seen too much play in church I've seen too much of just turning the pages of the calendar here we've come already now to to February the now the 2nd and now the month of January is gone but even more it's more of a milestone than that yesterday I I marked 55 years of ministry where me a young boy 15 years old began a Ministry 55 years ago but I'm telling you I'm just tired of marking time amen there's got to be a people that that could be so in the glorious power of God presence of God that someday God could loose his power into it and he says the church is ready now listen church we know the world is is ready for his burning he tells us the hour is we're living oh God the world's falling apart they hangs in the hangers bombs their hangs in the the things that to do just exactly they've already moved the clock again saying it's closer to midnight than ever and he goes on to said the church is ready she is sealed in ready to come and there will be a big outpouring of the spirit yes sir to grab that church and take her into the disguise exactly because the church the word the bride and Christ his ministry is in his bride which his body is his body the supernatural body of his here on Earth his spirit is in there living his life out until him and the church becomes one in the wedding they become one Hallelujah a big outpouring of the spirit H oh he says this God's Little Flock that believes this word the mechanics its mechanics is ready to we have received the word it's ready for the Dynamics to set it a fire with the Holy Ghost fear not little flock it's your father's Good Will to give you the kingdom the Holy Ghost will strike a little church that's come out from the world women that wears long hair Nazarite to prove they're separated themselves from the world you say what can we expect what do we expect well I want you to hear the prophet's word and from the token I'm looking for a Break Forth of the spirit of God in these last days that we're now living for another surge of the holy spirit in the church for a rapture in faith just before it comes and everything is setting straight in order for that and I believe we're at the time that the word should have preeminence I believe the time to lay aside our Creeds our thoughts and come back to the word hallelujah a people coming back recognizing the Messiah United with the word having the full gasoline power amen the Thousand octane power of the Holy Ghost word in you to be lit by the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost for another surge of the Holy Ghost how many's ready for that Amen in the indictment he says may there come a Revival of the just and a great power come among the church just before it's going and he says let me read it again May there come forth a Revival of the just and a great power come among the church just before it's going and it's not hard to pray that because you promised it and we're looking Lord for that third pull that we know that's in our that we know that will do great things for us in our midst amen we know by now what the third pull is it's the opening of the word it's the revealing of those seals amen and but but friends many people have received what they call uh the opening of the word and they're still dead in sins still chained with unbelief still haven't come out so he says what we need today is an opening of the word that lives oh we're talking about a living bride in the Finish pull now she's a word bride she's in his very image she has to fit him the Capstone is Christ and the living bride must be exactly like him they must fit together and this this is is coming in Bride form now we can go through it and maybe we will before this sermon is over it depends on whether you drag me to death this morning but nevertheless you know I mean I'm I'm pressing through because of physically you know I I'm handicapped with my with my throat my voice but I want you to get this this morning so enter in with me pull like you never pulled before as I say it many times help me preach are you ready all right so his coming today is in Bride form he has to come in Bride form in order for him to come back cuz he's coming for a wife a bride who had made herself ready are you with me so his coming has to be manifested you said but we got the word brother Tim he's the Messiah and he's come in word form but oh wait a minute yeah Paul's Paul come along to them down there and said okay here's the Christ but you got to get more than the word you got to get the spirit have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed are you with me amen so you see his coming was it comes in word form first one of the questions asked me in California why do we need a prophet that's a good question why did we need one because we've had thousands of years of misconstrued ideas and yet we were given a Bible like giving a road map but we didn't know where we were we didn't know what we were to do we didn't know what age we were in it took a SE to come in here and point in the scripture and said here's where you are this is the age that you're in this is what's happening your age to bring us back to the journey and say we've come all the way from the original Pentecost is a seed buried in the ground come up like a plant and what stage are we in we're back to grain again you see we had a message but I want you to remember his message is a message of Resurrection I'm not dead but I'm alive and the bride must have that same message it must be that same Easter message a resurrection message we're not a dead people that's right but we are alive and we'll never go back to the tombs of religion again that's right we'll never be yolked with Creeds and dogmas sealed up in some tomb somewhere never again never again that that reminds me of Israel they're over there they say never again never again will there be another Holocaust never again never again will We Stand By and let people go our people go down into furnaces and die in a holocaust and murdered and slaughtered never again we'll rise up an army we'll become a Nation we'll have a we'll have power amen we'll we'll be a formidable weapon and you touch one of our people we're coming after you the bride's got to be the same way amen never again never again never never never go back to where the Holy Ghost can't move never never again where the shout of the king is not in our midst never never again where the freedom of the spirit isn't that we can't dance in the spirit never never again will we have it amen where the power of God can't move in the house of God never [Applause] again so his coming must be in bright form and this I'm going to describe to you and I've done this before but well bear with me for a minute but I'm going to describe for you the church that brother brandham dreamed of one that was fundamentally with the word and had the faith and the Dynamics to go with it that's what he dreamed of brother brandham did not dream of intellectual speaking brother Bram did not dream of a church that would have to rely on psychology to solve the church's problems take young boys and put them through seven steps or seven weeks of of training on how not to look at pornography you don't need any training like that you need the Holy Ghost you get him on the inside of you he changes your nature right then and there that's all you need amen is a Divine vaccine oh no I shouldn't say that word I got censored the other day and took our sermon off of YouTube on account of it but nevertheless you see his coming today is more than word it's more than a message but it's now the word made flesh see that's what we didn't understand we started out many many years ago we thought my goodness we received the message God had sent a prophet he had Vindicated that we had the message we're ready to go home we weren't we didn't realize there was something different cuz God wasn't going to Rapture a bunch of tapes come on he wasn't going to take a bunch of books to Heaven that's right he wasn't going to take pictures of the prophet and pictures of a pillar of fire pictures of a man who had a pillar of fire his chance would have the pillar of fire amen and so we did not understand so we thought glory to God we're ready for the rapture we weren't right that's right the word we had received had to take on flesh that's right somebody had to take the book and eat it and once they ate it keep it down and digest it and once they digest it speak it and become the final [Applause] voice so this is his coming his coming is in bright form so while I went to meeting in there we're going to get it but only if you become Christ in bright form so you see there was a church brother brandom dreamed this was his dream Church the one he wanted to present to Christ like Paul would in his age and say I would present you as a Chase virgin this is the kind of church Paul would say of his I fear lest by any mean the serpent would begal you as he begal Eve take your virginity away you just become a harlot and it did it became the horror in the Book of Revelation but you know we're in danger of doing the same thing because you see every movement winds up organizing come on taking on a denom ational spirit and when they do they become a daughter to the hor called harlots and they're as guilty as their mother so now his what he dreamed of having was one that was fundamentally with the word and had the faith and Dynamics to go with it so he said in my travels I find two classes of people now I'm finding one like this and one like this one of them is fundamentals positionally they know by the mechanics that they are to be sons and daughters in God so one of them Knows by the word mechanically they know the mechanics they know what the Bible said it positions them now I'll tell you what they get so strongly positioned and root rooted in that fundamental part that Christ saves and he saved me from my sins I'll tell you how rooted they are I spoke with a man who was a Baptist man and he said brother Tim I would like to talk with you today I need a little advice I said okay he lights one cigarette off of another while we're sitting there talking I mean take literally takes that one that's lit down to the stub and sucks on it and starts another he says now I am a Christian and he says I have made my confession you know I'm Baptist I've made my confession in Christ I have been saved I believe right now if the Lord would come I would just be changed in a moment and I'd meet the Lord in the air it'd be a wonderful thing and here just 3 weeks before I knew that he had been arrested for drunk driving and that he was now asking me a question about being married for the third time to somebody else's wife but he was so sure listen they had taken the words of the Bible and it so put placed him fundamentally until he was so sure that I'm a Son of God didn't matter what kind of sin he was living in he was a child of the Living God and going to heaven would go in the Rapture if he come this moment now I'll tell you what there's some of you that don't have that kind of assurance and you're now not even living kind of life but you know you're doubting you're quibbling you're wondering you're you know back and forth and up and down this man had been so placed in the word I'm saved I have been baptized I've joined the church I've I've received Christ as my savior I made my profession of faith and I'm going to heaven fundamentally of course he had no Dynamics to make him live it so he had no power over his tobacco his drunkenness his womanizing but he was going to heaven now so you see one by they're fundamentalist they positionally know by the mechanics that they are to be Sons and Daughters of God now you know we do the same thing we place you what do we do we place you and we say you were chosen before the foundation of the world if there's one going to be in that Rapture you're going to be that one and the job of the ministry is to so fundamentally place you in the word to give you an assurance your sins are forgiven your past is over that you're a child of the Living God but friends it takes more than belonging to a message church and being told you were chosen before the foundation of the world you got to have the Dynamics to go with it you got to have the real true genuine Revelation from God I am God's son that's right that's right now he said so the next I find is the Pentecostals day with the baptism of the Holy Spirit but I said the fundamentalist Fundamentalist positionally know where they are at but they don't have any faith in the word so there's no power to go with it the Pentecostal has got a lot of faith but they don't know who they are so you got one that positionally don't know who they are don't realize what comes with their sunship yet they got a lot of faith they'll go out and pray for the sick and it happens see Miracles take place and everything else but they don't know POS positionally in the word what God's doing in this hour but he said it's like a man that has money in the bank but could not write a check and one who could write a check but had no money in the bank if you could just get them two together now this is Brother Brandon's dream Church to have them both together no so he was talking to a man about you know about the baptism of the Holy Ghost and about the Pentecostal Believers and the man said well what makes him act like that it's letting off the steam I don't think it have to be necessary but they got to give vent somewhere now they would just take all that Steam and could know how to direct it fundamentally in the word the big regime of God would start to move it on come on now now that's like some of you will dance in the spirit and the next day doubt your salvation don't hang up on me I'm still preaching amen but but again you know if you take that Steam and put it in the word and say I know who I have believed I know that I am called I know I'm the Bride of this age and Satan cannot stand before me I'm a child of the most high God you got to have faith in your position but he said that's where Satan got in it to make it all mechanics and no Dynamics or back all Dynamics and no mechanics see we got to put it together we got to get the power of the Holy Spirit but we got to come back with the word to feed the machine we can't feed it on Creed it won't burn it chokes up the flu it will not burn it it was made for the word of God man shall not live by bread alone but by every word not just part of it every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God so this is Brother brandom's dream church and I just want to say as a veteran that for these past 60 years we've got the mechanics down the first principles the core doctrines predestination ET security the original sin all these mystery truths buddy we we've expounded the shields the Thunders the trumpets the vials but by and large we have neglected the Dynamics now listen I I'm not trying to paint with a broad brush so don't paint yourself in there if that's not you but I'm just saying as a whole the message movement has neglected the Dynamics just like you said and I've quoted it often God of this evil age instead of tearing for the baptism of the Holy Ghost let science prove to her that the Holy Ghost was only for the disciples instead of keeping Divine Healing going when she ought to be now raised from the dead doing great Miracles she has let Satan under his leadership a religious man take the word of God and try to say it was for another age you say they're not doing that brother oh yeah it was for the Divine Healing move that was only back for them and that's not now we got the word now we're we come to Perfection we don't need that anymore and she's believed it and the Bible said the things that I do you shall do also he said go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature we're still creatures these signs should follow every one of them that believe she denied every bitt it she denies all the supernatural she's swapped it for his intellectual conception of the Bible and this is happening and let me just tell you that's just not my assessment that's the prophet's assessment let me read from uh from the rising of the sun he said you say the power is in the gasoline brother brandom and I want you to remember the gasoline rep represents the word the power is in the word brother Brandon you see that's what we hear all the time the word the word the word the word the word and he said but I don't have care how much power is in the gasoline unless there is a spot there to manifest that power unless there's a power there to confirm that that's gasoline it might as well be water J you so we got the word brother Tim we got it I tell you we we know it we got to know it back and forth and whatever but if you don't have the spark if there ain't something igniting that word if ain't some something that is bringing to life that word and you're filled with the Holy Ghost you're ined with power from on high you've got God living in your life you have overcoming power even ain't there your word might as well be water no matter how much you theologians claim how well you got your church set brother we do our church orders and everything how much education you got and we've educated people how much like the Bible until that wave sheath until the Holy Spirit comes on that person to Quicken that word the gasoline represents the word is the truth but without the spirit it won't move that's right and here's where he here's where he stresses it now so this ain't me we have put too much stress on the mechanics let that sink in we have put too much stress on the mechanics and nothing on the Dynamics it needs the dynamic power of God the resurrection power of Jesus Christ upon the church to manifest and bring to pass that this is gasoline it might be in a gasoline can but it can still be water but the only proof of it is put this life on it and it'll prove whether it's gasoline or not so if you want to know if it's really word is it Healing The Sick is it casting out devils amen is it filling people with the Holy Ghost is the power of God living in the church giving overcoming lives somebody help me preach amen if if not if not I I tell you what put the spirit on it and you'll find out that's right if it just SPS around and says days of Miracles are passed or this only happened when the prophet was here you got water you got water in your tank now the Pentecostals had a lot of faith but didn't know who they were they lacked the full the full gas of the word they yet they have true Visions I'm talking about true Visions true tongues yeah true prophecies true Miracles there were great men Godly men men like John G Lake from South Africa or that's where he had his Ministry men of Faith men of power like Smith Wigglesworth like Daddy Bosworth Godly men men with faith I mean Daddy Bosworth would bring people in a prayer line with without a gift when I say without a gift I'm talking about some manifestation in his hand or discernment and would stand there and just preach the word in such a way way and then have some somebody come up and he would rebuke a death spirit and somebody's he said it's one of the easiest spirits to make turn loose men of power led by the spirit men of Faith but now lacking the fundamentals listen the word to come so they they had lot of spark but they were missing the word watch now I you know last week on our trip to California our brother Jonathan sorus he took us to Angeles Temple where Amy simple M ferson built America's first mega church that would set over 5,300 people and during those days it was jam-packed and she would die in 1944 at the age of about 52 or three and of course she spread the message of Pentecost to the world she owned the first big radio station which was kfg that broadcaster Services as far away as austral now that was a powerful gun big gun radio that had that kind of broadcast would reach Australia I don't know what their rules were in that day but apparently they didn't have any and the spread the isusa message around the world this right here is the opening to the parsonage of her home right here on the big complex I stood behind the pulpit where she preached while I was there it's a beautiful Pulpit it's was hand carved by Gypsies and was a gift to her and behind that desk there were men of Faith Like Smith Wigglesworth preach behind that very desk and where brother Ram preached the isua Jubilee and the lamb and the Dove and plus the he had sermons that he preached there that wasn't even in recorded we don't even have tapes of them but he talks about having been there and and there you know in there brother brandham well you know even spoke of this himself and uh you know he says you know they they've shown me around and he said I've seen on it we would see Jesus and it's their carv in the wood right there he said this is mighty nice so he's standing behind this very desk and he's preaching the isua Jubilee of 50 years since the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on isua street they have a commemoration and brother bram's one of the speakers I stood behind this desk and I thought about the men of God Mighty Men even going in that woman that woman being a oh yeah maybe she's doing God's service without his will I you know I'm I'm not the judge of all of that of why and where and how come but let me just tell you I mean you know there were the things there on displays of braces and shoes from people with INF infantile paralysis and braces that was removed and all kinds of crutches and things that was there paraphernalia people that were healed as this woman ministered to them and laid hands on them because of Faith so well that was Pentecost that was the zeusa street brother Tim I'm just saying if they're the Shu and they're the twin what ought we to be like yes here they were with the word they [Music] knew and they had Faith to believe in it to make that part of the word work now I just read you what brother brand something we ought to be doing but here here this woman and God would would honor This Woman's prayer that ain't all that ain't all you know I we all we know all know of Tommy osbor we've heard of him many times of brother Bradon speaking about him Tommy osbor his great faith healing you know he had a sister that prayed for the sick too and she would have a boy come in her prayer line that had a cold his mom said to him said go up and have her pray for you CU she had a prayer line she' preached and then she had a prayer line has happened in the Assembly of God Church as she has this prayer line and prays for this boy says Sun boy um what do you want well I got a cold I want you to pray for her and she said yeah but what's what's the matter with your eye so well it's blind so well God heals blind eyes too and so she laid hands on him and prayed for him what she did what the boy didn't tell her is that he had had his eye knocked out and taken out because of an infection when he was a a young boy and had no eyeball and he walks back to the Pew by his mama and he's sitting there mama I can see she said I know you can see you know and if you can't see good move around he said no mama that ain't what I'm talking about I can see out of my Blind Eye she said well wait he said mom said wait a minute boy you know you can see out that eyee cover that eye and he can see and he can describe and everything else and this boy Ronnie coin he would he's on YouTube you can go look him up there you can see him as a as a young boy preacher and he's reading little fine PR off of social security numbers and and everything else things you wouldn't do today but anyway all kinds of stuff that he would read off of a card while his eyes bandaged up Way Big you know what it's impossible and doctors examine him and make the decision this boy can see without an eyeball what happened a woman's prayer not trying to knock down you ladies I'm telling you I'm trying to tell you God will even hear your prayer but somebody that will believe are you with me listen we walked into the auditorium looked into there 5,300 seat it was the first mega church in America message went out around the world to bringing the Pentecostal isusa Street message all the way down and then a couple of blocks from there we drove by when able to tour it but we got just a couple of blocks later we went to the Bonnie Bray House and in Los Angeles and this little humble house was where the holy ghost first fell on the west coast out there they were D in Los Angeles just just a few blocks away from Angeles Temple now back in 1906 and in this place so many crowded in there until the ports fell in and then they mve the meetings to the USA Street and that building onusa Street burned with in in a fire so I can't show you the picture of that it wasn't there but the Holy Ghost experience began earlier than 1906 for about 1903 two or three there was Charles parum in his Bible School in Kansas he'd experiened an outbreak of the Holy Ghost with speaking in other tongues brother William Seymour was a student of Charles parum brother Seymour moved to be the pastor in in LA and he began to teach about the coming of the Holy Ghost and how that he believed it was a restoration hour and how that acts 2 and 4 and the spirit fell and their expectations of the Holy Ghost to fall and they got under the conviction of that word and there there they they began as he began to preach and teaching on the Holy Ghost they rejected him in his church and so he started a home meeting right here on Bonnie bra street in the asb's home a little black family he was a black man and the little black family had this home that was other black people across the street just before leaving for a prayer meeting on April the 9th 1906 Seymour's friend Edward Lee began to speak in tongues after Seymour had laid hands on him and prayed for him well they went from there a couple of blocks up the street to the Arbury home with Bonnie Bray at 7:30 p.m. prayer meeting and there was a handful of africanamerican saints gathered together that wanted encounter with God in a greater Manner and they had a song and a few prayers and several testimonies released and testimony was shared of how that Lee had spoken tongue just two hours before and then he began to re preach from Acts 2 and 4 when the day of Pentecost was fully come suddenly there came a sound of of a mighty rushing wind and and and the pillar of fire come in and and then something happened that they'd all been waiting long for God crashed into that meeting like never before and somebody began to speak in tongues and several began to be baptized with the Holy Ghost and spoke in tongues there was a little girl from across the street who was a cousin to the Asberry her name was jeie Moore she lived across the street she was resting on a stool when suddenly she fell to the ground and began to speak in tongues she's known now as the first woman of the LA to to speak in tongues during this time she recalled it was like a vessel broke inside of her and water surged through her entire being when this rust came to her lips she spoke in six different languages that she'd seen earlier in a vision these tongues were interpreted into English following this release Genie who had never played a piano before walked over to the piano and played it under the anointing while singing in other tongues and yeah Satan got in there yes he did but just because Satan got in there I'm asking you are we going to keep God out because we're afraid Satan might get in I just tell you don't throw the baby out with the bath water in other words don't don't discard something that's valuable getting ready is something that's unwanted why bind the Holy Spirit and not let him work because we're afraid of what the devil might do can you imagine there's men today that will not testify the miraculous power of God because of what they saw in Pentecost when men would take that and and bring glory to themselves and so for that reason they will not testify of the glory of God I'll tell you the Bible said to declare his Mighty works let the generations know that's Amen Let Let our children know there's a real God there's a living God that's right so oh we dare not tell of the Miracles in this church I tell you we dare we dare not refuse to tell we will tell amen we will tell the stories we will declare he heals cancer we will declare he heals alpia we declare that he heals oure diseases we will declare he's the same yesterday today and forever that crippled boys can walk amen that blind eyes can [Applause] see why bind the Holy Spirit not allow him work because of fear what the devil's going to do don't be a to see you and reject Christ who's knocking at your door and not allowing him in with Pentecost just because Satan also knocks don't reject the voice of God because Satan has a voice but let me go on with this we had a long day today and I'm not going to make it easy so yes as I quote the prophet in it was a mixture of the unrighteous partaking of spiritual blessings and manifesting in the Holy Ghost let me read that again so yes in it was a mixture of the unrighteous partaking of spiritual blessings and manifesting in the Holy Ghost in it also was devil power as me were under the control of devils yet no one seemed to realize it and then to prove it was not real it was not the real now listen it was not the grain nor the complete restoration but it was a continuation of reformation and these people he said before the second generation had appeared organized and wrote their unscriptural doctrines and built their own fences as ever other group ahead of them did they just become another denomination another daughter of the what did they lack they had faith and they demonstrated power but not the word because the book was not open but I want to introduce to you today that there is a real bride who has both word and Power amen listen brother Brandon said what seemed to be the answer came as many begin to speak in tongue manifest gifts of the Spirit and then it believed it was then believed this was indeed the long way to Restoration it was not for the latter rain can come only after the former rain which is the spring or teaching rain and the latter rain then the the lattering then is a harvest rain how could it be the real thing when the teaching rain had not come the prophet messenger who was sent to teach the people and turn the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal fathers had not yet come thus what was thought to be the restoration and the final quicking of the Rapture had not come but we do we know who we are and we know whose we are and we know the mechanics better than any other age we know correct water baptism we know godhead we know serpent seed we understand the symbols in the Book of Revelation we know because the Silence has been broken we have received the prophet messenger who was sent to teach the people and turn the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal fathers and he has come and he's gone and he sounded his message and we received it and I want to say we have eaten it amen and it is sweet as honey thus the restoration and final quickening under Rapture has come we're no longer waiting on it now let me just make clear before I close this morning you can't go anywhere without the mechanics of the word we're not in any way trying to say we don't need the word like they say we don't need the spirit but we're saying we must have the word we must have all the word but we also must have the spirit because you can't run without it you see without the that gasoline of the word that has the power and let me just say this word has all the power in it even brother Brandon we talked about the third phase of his ministry which would be the opening of those Seven Seals of revealing of the Mysteries he showed first the power of it it would heal the sick it would create it would resurrect it would speak to storms and it would save your children that's the power that lays in this word hallelujah but it's got to have somebody with faith to believe it right Dynamics to come to the mechanics and make that word live amen Because unless there's a spark to manifest the power of the word it might as well be water and if you got gas and it's mixed with some water like the Dynamics comes on and is a sputters days of Miracles are pass age of the Apostles have cease all these things it don't happen like that in our day oh that was only for the prophet in his ministry it'll it'll hit that water and it'll just splutter and you'll go nowhere you just you know just make a noise but never never go forward you see again we're in the age where the true church returns to be and the bride she was at Pentecost so we know there must be a necessity a return of dynamic power because to have the 100% pure word without the spirit is like having 100% pure gasoline and no spark so now brother bram's dream and hopes of having a group it's going to be fulfilled his dream of having a church that had the faith that took the faith the Pentecostals demonstrated and the knowledge of the fundamentals who positionally know by the mechanics that they are to be Sons and Daughters of God getting Pentecostal faith into a people who positionally know by the word who they are let me ask you something we talk about the word that came what was the semblance you remember there in sabben Canyon as he had his hands lifted up praying about those seven angels going to come to him wondering it would be the end of his life and there was a sword came in his hand and was glistening in the Sun and he looked at it where in the world did this sword come from I'm miles away from civilization and here I had my hands up and this sword drops into my hand and the voice spoke to him and said said this is the King's sword it is that third pull oh he said a sword he said you use it to night men with now let me just say to you that's what we wanted to do with the sword is night men and make them rulers and this is a Joshua and this one's an Aaron and and we taking the word and nighted men and made Kings out of them amen but I want you to understand that's not why the sword was given the sword was given it's the word and it is given there to defeat your enemy Amen to put the two-edged sword in your hand said well brother Tim brother brandham got that that sword in his hand let me just tell you something Moses went up on the mountain and there was ten commandments put in his hands but that was not Moses Ten Commandments amen he was only representing all of Israel who was getting the word of God and when brother Brandon went into being a canyon there and received the king's sword he was not getting that for himself he was getting after for every member of the Bride where you would have a weapon against the enemy but it takes a hand of Faith to use it no matter how powerful it is you got to have a hand of Faith to use it the seven Thunders what were they given for just to give us more knowledge brother Brandon talks about him in the fourth seal we had him the Antichrist coming last night with his great sword to kill we find that he gets killed with the sword too the sword of the word God's word sharp two-edged sword slays him puts him right down wait until them seven Thunders utter their voices to that group who can really take the word of God and hand it there it'll slice it'll cut and they'll close the heavens they can shut this or do that whatever they want to Glory he'll be slayed by that word that proceeds from his mouth it's sharper than a two-edged sword she that's the bride she is a mouth of God wait a minute where does he hold the sword his sword was in his mouth and where would the word be in the bride in her mouth that's right Hallelujah I'm talking to a people this morning that's going to speak to their mountains I'm talking about a people who's going to demonstrate the power of the word I'm talking about a people who knows they're God and will do exploits hallelujah what an age we're living in church and to think you have been called to be the final voice to the final age to God to speak through a people like he's never spoke before let's stand our feet let the musicians come now I've labored along this morning I've done it with a bit of a horse throat all these ministers know when you have something like that to kind of holds you back it's harder to press through hard harder to to to yield to that vein of anointing but I hope the message got through amen I hope here is I've sacrificed and labored and came here maybe not at my best this morning but given my best I hope in return you're receiving the word and you're saying oh God let me become a voice to that word let it live out of my life let it change me in your presence Lord bow your head just for a moment play very softly maybe this morning you know a little bit about the message fundamentally you know this you know that but you know the overcoming power isn't in your life there's still sin there's still drinking they're still smoking maybe you even been baptized in his name maybe you hadn't really surrendered your life but this morning are you're here in this presence you want to make a full surrenderance to God say Lord here I am don't let me Le from here the same I hear there's a power fundamentally I believe Lord I know it's true but I want that spark to come ignite the word within me and make make it live I want to be changed in your presence I want you to fill me with your presence Lord with your power would it be somebody raise their hand to God and say would you remember me brother Tim as you pray I don't want to go back the same God sees your hand he sees your hand you know you don't have to be in bondage you might been in the tombs of sin chained down by Devils lived among the tombs like the maniac just one moment in his presence is all it takes Jesus will break every fed every F you don't have to go back and live in sin any longer you can be a real man a real woman a real child of God surrendered to his holy spirit just ask him to Lord that spark that spark fundamentally I know it's right fundamentally I'm convinced but today I want your Holy Spirit to Quicken it to me father in the name of Jesus take these words this morning make it real to your children manifest your glory to them Lord we've labored today in the word Lord we've laid it down the best we know how father you know I'm not trying to take them back to some ofua Street you know Lord that's not it we don't want to be the Shu we've been called to be the grain but Lord let us have that resurrection power within us let us be that church your Prophet dreamed of having a people who fundamentally know who they are and a people who have the faith to go with it I ask it in Jesus name Amen brother Timothy's going to lead us in song for a few moments as we just worship and I'll come and serve the communion God bless you thank you for being here today if somebody wants to leave now you want to be dismissed don't want to stay for the communion service you can go you don't have to leave you can stay right there in your seat be with us right through it all but if you need to go right now would be a time to slip out quietly and let the Holy Spirit just dwell with you in a real special way today [Music] amen Fe me to I want I want no more here my fill it up and make me whole here's my cup Lord here myup
