[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh I know [Applause] [Applause] [Music] I know [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh [Music] amen we praise God tonight for an opportunity to serve Him amen when greets you tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus and God bless you Saints and all of those that are streaming from around the world wherever you are we pray God's blessings his protections in this hour and surely the coming of the Lord draws nigh and we should live in a state of preparedness this is truly the time to be in Passover like I spoke about some months ago the blood the Holy Ghost must be applied upon the doorpost to the Church of the home and upon every individual it's more critical more important right now than ever right now the world as we know it has stopped people are looking at shortages and this has caused a lot of fear and panic people are afraid they'll be without essential goods the word about their jobs tomorrow the preparedness though that is really needed is the token the Holy Ghost applied the bien Passover means that you're in communion with Christ and I think right now we can realize the symbol means even more than ever we have walked before the sacred desk we have taken up the the bread and the wine right now I think it's really really important what communion means [Music] you're here quarantined from the world applying the blood eaten the lamb is roasted with fire it's an hour that you should pray like you've never prayed pray for the many needs not only for the virus situation but also those with cancer and other diseases and for the bride around the world may this just be a real wake-up call to every one of us this a very critical our my concern is also for the little children and I encourage you to gather those in your arms and explain to them that in all of this God is in control and that we believe that this too will pass perhaps we never know the normal that we have known might be some something new something different but God will see us through it for the rest of us we should take nothing for granted we don't know but what the services that we have had in the past might just be a fond memory or the random spoke of that and we know even himself that nothing is the same where he was standing speaking to his local congregation and said one day this might be a fond memory and certainly today we look back over those meetings were fond right now we look as we've had the council youth camp his camp could be a fond memory services like we've had in the past I've become the fond memory what's important in this hour is that we have the power to bind the serpent of death to do this we must be more sincere so I think an hour like this calls for a greater sincerity than ever and I'm calling on you that are here listening with me this evening joining us with this service that you take this time in this moment to become more dedicated more consecrated to God than ever before and that that you realize that God is asking for a greater sincerity because in order to bind the serpent we must be more sincere I'm asking you to pray to talk to the Lord to get in communion fellowship if the Holy Ghost is not in your life seek it with all your heart and then then when we come back together let us come taking nothing for granted but valuing one another and valuing our services and all that it entails because it has suddenly become something very very very precious so make your call in your election sure we're gonna go to prayer tonight I would like you to join your hand you're yourself together with others take care of someone by the hand maybe there's sickness in the hall maybe there's situations there you have need of right now our brother Darrell Baxter has injured his back I'd like I'd like those there or near by him just to lay hands upon him now as we pray our brother Rob Spencer's and I see you and he's going to start gamma ray upon his head with a brain tumors there in chemo right away he's he needs a miracle did you know there's something more serious than that which could threaten the death of the body and that is eternal life is the greatest thing we could seek after and if you're needed but tonight seek him with all your heart while he may be found and knock well it shall be open to you and I believe right now the doors of mercy and grace are open for you and your need we don't have any of your prayer requests but tonight if right there by you if there's someone that's got a need you can just be get out right now and say I've got this need today I want you to pray for me and you lay hands upon them right now as we pray and we're gonna believe we're gonna bind the serpent we're gonna believe God for miracles amen because our God there's a miracle working God he's here to minister to you and meet your need tonight father as we bow before your throne of grace we want to thank you for this opportunity to serve you as our voice goes out of round the world those that are listening in gathered with us tonight I pray Lord that their just will not be a gathering of believers but there won't be a gathering together of the Holy Spirit meeting together with every individual and every family that is under the sound of my voice wherever reaches around the world Lord in the waking moments overseas our Lord at those who will archive later and those that are streaming now may the Holy Spirit from near and be there gathered wherever two or more gather together in your name may you be in the midst I pray you'll go right now to that to that very side and brother brother Rob they're in the IC review room may the Holy Spirit hovering here be the angel of your presence come close that touches body and healing Lord we send the word tonight and we also speaking to Satan on our adversary Oh Satan you have no right to God's people to God's property so we bind your power in the name of Jesus Christ and claim the blood that was shed we call upon the Lord to come and answer this request tonight to bring healing and deliverance in the mighty name of Jesus made it go into areas where gamma-ray cannot go may it reach into the body even if through barriers the chemo cannot reach may the Holy Spirit go in there and vanish ever doubt and fear and sickness and disease I pray Lord for our brother Darrell leathers injured his back that you'll bring a healing touch to him tonight may the Holy Spirit just reach out and touch him and even now Lord as we pray that the power of God will

able to enjoy the service I bring you remove fear from your people tonight and put a real faith in the hearts to believe you as we are asking it in the name of Jesus and Lord for this flag that is strike in the world as we know it we pray God as your prophet would pray you raise up vaccines and you anoint doctors - doctor medicine to help but more than that Lord made a wall of fire beeper about your people tonight Lord upon the high health care professionals ever that are helping the sick I pray a wall of fire would be upon them and then the 19 of the Spirit would go with them that as they lay hands on the sick they too will recover and Lord you'll protect them from the diseases that is hearing in the land today as we buy that serpent in the name of Jesus Christ and ask for your glory

[Music] he-man let's Apsara his father or Jesus were so thankful that we can come to you and our times of me situations Lord sometimes we don't know Lord we've never been in on before but God you know you know their hearts cry you know the needs you know the situations among us or do you know the panic that's in the land situations and sickness every word Lord the devil would like us to think that he's hanging on every tree that he's everywhere but we may be surrounded but we're surrounded by here or we're surrounded by your presence Lord we're surrounded by the great I am the one who can make a way where there seems to be no way the one who can take a piece of bread and make another piece up here the one who can lure to make food fall out of heaven whatever it is Lord that your people needed you were able to provide Lord we believe you're still that same God today Lord that whatever we have need of whether it be a physical need a financial need and a food of whatever it is Lord we know that you're able to provide Lord God we just ask that you strengthen your people Lord all over the world situations Lord panic pandemics but Lord there's nothing too hard for you but I'm thankful that even though we have a new name to face in this hour the Lord the word said you're the Lord God that heals all our diseases Lord we're looking to the blood of Jesus has still yet powerful still yet can cleanse the vilest sinner still yet can heal the sick still yet we will raise the dead Lord a blood that has not lost any power a blood Lord that still just as powerful today as the first moment came down out of that precious body Lord God we're so thankful we can have that kind of confidence nor do we have a confidence in you because you've never found one yet you never left one yet you never let one fall yet there's not even a sparrow that can fall without you knowing about it you know the things that we're in the situation we're in and you're mindful that tonight or do we commit this service to you everything Lord the word the songs Lord has touched her heart Lord we just asked it was strength and your people would pray in Jesus name Amen any man man we could turn on our Bibles to Exodus 14 a man I'd like to just continue on a thought that have been on the Lord is a man of war and yeah it just seems like every time I go to try to maybe look at something else there's always something that comes up and it just keeps me going down this way so we're going to continue because I believe he is a man of war and I believe he's a God that's mighty in battle and no matter what you may be facing no matter what you may be going through no matter what situation you find yourself presently in never forget who he is because that don't change him he's still the same yesterday today and forever so Exodus 14 and verse 8 and it says the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt and he pursued after the children of Israel and the children of Israel went out with a high hand but the Egyptians pursued after them all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh and his horsemen and his army and overtook them in Kampen by the sea and when Pharaoh drew nigh the children of Israel lifted up their eyes and behold the Egyptians marched after them and they were sore afraid and the children of Israel cried unto the Lord and they said unto Moses because there was no graves in Egypt has thou taken us away to die in the wilderness wherefore has thou dealt thus with us to carry us forth out of Egypt is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt saying let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians for it been better for us to serve the Egyptians and that we should die in the wilderness and Moses said to the people fear you not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord which he will show you today for the Egyptians whom you've seen today you'll see them again no more forever but the Lord shall fight for you and you shall hold your peace and the Lord said unto Moses wherefore cries down to me speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward but lift up thy rod and stretch out their hand over the sea and divide it and the children of Israel shall go and dry land to the midst of the sea and I behold I will hearken the hearts of the adju harden the hearts of the Egyptians and they shall follow them and I will get me honor upon Pharaoh and upon all his hosts upon his chariots and upon his horsemen and the Egyptians shall know that I am the lord that I have gotten the honor upon Pharaoh and upon his chariots and upon his horsemen and the angel of God went before the camp of Israel and removed and went behind them and the pillar of the cloud went before their face and stood behind them and it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel and it was a cloud and darkness to them but it gave light by night to these so that no one came near the other all night and Moses stretched out his hand over the sea and the Lord calls the sea to go back by and strong east wind all that night and made the sea dry land and the waters will divide it and the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground and the waters were a wall unto them on the right hand and on their left and the Egyptians pursued and went in after them in the midst of the sea and all Pharaoh's horses his chariots and his horsemen and it came to pass and in the morning watch the Lord looked in the morning watched the Lord looked upon the hosts the Egyptians to the pillar of fire and out of the cloud and troubled the host of the Egyptians and took off their chariot wheels that they drive them heavenly so that the Egyptian said let us flee from the face of Israel for the Lord fight us for them against the Egyptians and the Lord said unto Moses stretch out their hand over the sea and the waters may come upon the Egyptians upon the chariots and upon their horsemen and Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared and the Egyptians fled against it but the Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea and the waters returned and cover the chariots and the horsemen and all the host of Pharaoh that came unto the sea after them and there remained not so much as one of them hallelujah hey man we'll let you be seated just looking over some things today as we're facing the trials and the things that were going through his brother Tim talked about that the world that we lived in live in is not the world we lived in just a few days ago and there's trouble all around us and people in complete pandemonium and panicking and worried about where to go and what to do or what's the future or what's next and the only future that I can guarantee is a future in glory amen a future that's out of this world and I'm looking for that place and I'm looking for that lamp but you know brother Branham speaking about these things and I want to bring a few things of the things he may have faced in his day and and and what happened there he said when trouble begins to face you sickness on ever ham the angel of God comes up and it stands and goes between you and the sickness the angel of God amen this to go between you and the sickness to stand in the way and all the time challenging you to take God at His Word and this is what we read here as the children of Israel came to this place you know they'd already witnessed a God standing between them and the death angel is here as it would leave that to the Egyptian or even leave ship and start their journey towards the promised land they would they would already realize it was a God who could come and stand between them as he would tell them to put the blood over the doorpost and put the blood over the lintel and the doorpost I meant us to show a man the blood of a lamb that had been slain and there was to be inside see God would quarantine the children of Israel even in time of their plagues and the time of the death angel and he would put him in the place of safety and that was behind the blood and and and you know as they would as the death angel would begin to go through the land there was something that would stand between them and the Death Angel there they were told not to go into the streets that were told to not go into the land but to stay were the place that God had provided them and that he had given them something or a remedy or a token to stand between them to show the death angel that he had no right to enter into their promise or enter into their house and I'm thankful Eve today that we have the not a physical blood but we have a token the Holy Ghost that is upon our lives to stand there as the death angel is going through the land whether it be a virus or whether it be spiritual death which is worse than any kind of physical death but that there is something there to stand against him in our time of struggles in our time of rent that we can have a refuge we and so I said God had given Israel the promise and as we come here he told him that he was going to go to they're going to take them from here and take them to a land flowing with milk and honey and I've said this before God didn't mention to them about the Red Sea he didn't tell him about the dry dry of the bitter waters he didn't tell him about no food he didn't say nothing about no water he didn't say anything about the trials or tribulations that they were going to face he said I'm going to take you out and I'm going to take you in because God has the answer to every situation that we face this is nothing new to God plagues are nothing new to God sickness is nothing new to God there's nothing here that we're facing in this hour that God don't have the answer for or God don't have the remedy for God doesn't have the Amen the cure for God yet as I said God is a Lord God that heals all our diseases and so he told them I'm going to take you out and I'm going to take you in God had given Israel promise they were going to the land hallelujah and we have the same promise he said I'm going to take you out and he as many as taken us out of life's of sin and darkness and delayed taking us out of darkness of a man's creeds and dogmas and brought us out amen out of those things into a promise to show us that there is a land flowing with milk and honey there is a land of no death there is a land of no sorrow there is a land of no panic there is a land of no pandemics there is this land and that's where we're headed to we're not headed to a great financial you know benefits here or there setting the other whatever the government may have been able to give up their their benefits and god bless them for whatever they're trying to do but that's not our goal that's not what we're looking for we're looking to leave this place amen we have the same promise we're going to Atlanta but here came Pharaoh and all of its men to try to run Israel down and try to destroy them understand when the enemy comes it does not go unnoticed by God God knows about it he sees the plagues he sees the things that are going on this earth he he sees the atmospheres that we're in and he's seen the Israelis seen him coming before he even got there and what happened when he arrived when it when Pharaoh and his army arrived the angel of the Lord was there to carry them to the promised land he rose up from the camp and he went stood between them and the danger and he still does that I don't know he's still the same God today he's here to stand between you and the plagues that are falling he steer'd a stand between you in the sin of this world he's here to stand between you and the tormenting spirits and the demons have told me that comes against the children of God it seems like we're up against the flood here and it seemed like flooding on every side but he said when they play enemy comes in like a flood I will raise a standard against in that day Michael shall stand up hallelujah he will make a way for every sick person he will make a way he's already made the way and he's standing right here between you and trouble hallelujah what kind of confidence can we have tonight and he says I know he's here right now because his word declares he's here that's why we can have this confidence it doesn't matter if we get down to having two or three people he said where two or three are gathered there I'll be it doesn't matter what's going on around us he's here it doesn't matter if we're in financial trouble don't forget he's here if you have physical trouble he's here if you have food or need of food he's here he's the provider he's Jehovah Jireh he hasn't changed his name he hasn't changed his attitude he's still here I know the devil wants us to food feed on the fear of this world and there is a lot of propaganda out there and a lot of fear-mongering and all those saying but turn your eyes back to the word his word declares he's here hallelujah and he's here standing between you and the trouble and yeah miss psalmist David would say though I walk to the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil why for thou art with me there is a people on this earth that God is with he said I will be even in her we're in the midst of her he showed himself in the seven candlesticks he showed himself all the way down through the Bible he is with her Amen though I walk to the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod or that staff for thy word it is a comfort to me hallelujah the same angel is in the building right now the same angel are in your car right now or in your home right now or in your hospital room not right now and he's doing exactly what Jesus did in that day he's here to confirm just what he did then he is now and he will always be the same the angel of God moving to the forefront to stand between us and the sickness to stand between us and death no wonder David would say it yea though I walk to the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil well like that pretty much entails every bit of it if it's evil I'm gonna fear none of it hallelujah hey man at the Red Sea the angel of God went and stood between them and the enemy the angel of God is standing here tonight between every individual and the enemy this is a direct quote between every individual and the enemy I know what I'm speaking of I know while I'm standing here on the platform before you to deny I know that God has consented condescended down from glory and is standing here right now between you and the enemy so we're to fear no evil and he's here standing between every individual hey man if you're only dared to move out on God's Word see if he don't move before you not to now he said he came between the camp and the Egyptians and he's coming between you and your sickness hallelujah he's coming between you and your cancer he's coming between you and your problems he's coming between you and your situation this is the angel that I've been speaking about he is not surprised by what we're in he's not surprised by what sickness you're facing he's not surprised by whatever you're going through this angel knows all about it hallelujah he was a light to one and a darkness to the other the Israelites Hector Moses prayed this is a quote again they could lay down in peace Alleluia notice all night the Egyptians could not enter into the camp of the Israelites in the darkness of the night the enemy still could not come in and destroy why there was an angel there hallelujah he says we see that Moses stretched out his hand over the sea and the Lord caused us go back by strong east wind all that night now it wasn't something that happened in just a moment it wasn't something that just and it can do that gods that kind of God but the scripture said and now all that night he meant it the wind blew and and he said in that moment they had accepted the light and they seemed that it was darkness to their enemy and so in the except in that light they could sleep all night while they were sleeping God was sinning a wind and blowing down across the sea opening up a way of escape see God has promised a way of escape hey man it don't matter what we're going through God has sent a promise I will make a way of escape he made a way of escape for the children of Israel he made a way of escape for Daniel in the lion's den he made a way of escape for the three Hebrew children he'll make a way of escape for his bride in this day he's not in the business of leaving you by yourself and leaving you to fight alone he said but no I am the captain of the Lord's host and I am here to lead in the battle hallelujah he's here hey man he says God was right there opening up the way all the time every man or woman tonight that it would just accept Jesus Christ the Holy Spirit Wilde you're asleep while you're resting in the promise he says maybe you're clearer crippled maybe you're blind maybe you came here maybe you can't see maybe you're sick maybe you're heart trouble maybe it's cancer something maybe you're dying except the light tonight hallelujah except the pillar of fire tonight and rest except the promise and rest hello yeah we need to accept the promise and rest just as that as the door was covered with the blood and there might have been somebody in the house worried and fretting but their father knew he had obeyed the prophets words and he done exactly what he said and he can turn and saying you just rest it's gonna be alright I've done what he said hallelujah there's a people here on this earth that I was done what the word said we've accepted the Lamb of God he's coming to our life he's changes by his blood we've done what he said now rest on his promise he's not going to leave us here [Music] hallelujah when you're crippled blind came here was sick heart trouble cancer or died it don't matter he's still God he don't change who he is that's what he said would tell the children of Israel he said the Lord will fight for you and you are to hold your peace now I've always and it doesn't you know it does have a meaning of just keep here and keep yourself you know don't say nothing don't don't don't don't say any kind of thought don't don't worry about it I've got this but what is he saying he said if you speak you speak the word only don't speak fear don't add to fear don't don't fear don't don't don't don't don't dwell on thoughts of fear or thoughts of things that's going on you speak the word only and the word will follow it the word hold your peace our peace is a peace that passes all understanding our pieces of children of God have is not just a temporary peace into our peace is not determined on whether we're having a good day or a bad day but whether we got money in our account or we don't have money in our account or whether we're sick or whether we're good our peace is not a temporary peace that's not the peace God is speaking about he said I will give you a peace that passes all understanding or that stays you with you no matter what your mind thinks but what somebody else says or what the world is saying or what they're going through you can still have peace because the Word of God is spoke and he said I'm not going to leave you but I want to stand between you and your enemy hallelujah and he said what will happen if you accept that tonight and read a win will begin to blow he said it'd be like a rushing mighty wind on the day of Pentecost it'll move right down through there and open up away for you and you'll pass right through that Valley of sickness I don't know your brother Ron rest tonight brother Timothy Andy's rest tonight sister shall rest tonight whatever if you're in a man of middle of the war or seemed like there sings on all sides rest resting the promise rests in a God that will never leave you or forsake you rest on the garnish and I'm the Lord God that heals all that diseases and while your sleep God's still working who loved it so even when I don't feel him he's working even when I don't see him he's working I might be asleep I might not even know it's happening but God is still blowing a win against your enemy it's the same wind that's here with us today it's the same way that opened up the Red Sea it's the same wind that rushed through that 120 it's the same man that's in our midst even now I say God blow in our homes blowing our cars blowing I work blow let us know that you are here hallelujah I'm just gonna be honest with you this is all a little different what we're facing but my motto right now is show no mercy ain't givin the devil an ounce of mercy I'm gonna come want to punch him and keep on punching him hey man kids to catch time we rise up and we start believing the promises of God it doesn't deny that God's promise is not determined whether we're in quarantine or whether we're in five hundred groups of people it does not determine it does not have no effect on God's Word God's Word will still come to pass hallelujah you know that wind to blow right through you and you'll pass right through the valley of sickness back to the land of health again hallelujah you pass right through the land of cold formal shackled down in different religion back to the Holy Ghost again filled happy rejoicing and a heart full of joy hallelujah God the Great Holy Spirit is standing right here tonight between us and death and life standing here tonight between sickness and health right here the same holy spirit that you feel now every born-again person it's bound to feel the Holy Spirit you can't help it if you got it in life and you know that it's there how many nodes are there a man here it is moving even now hallelujah but the random would speak a bleep about the plague of polio and he would say this he said we know that thou can remove this thing hallelujah thou can remove this thing and I pray God that there be an old-fashioned meeting started a prayer meeting all around the city may the churches fall on their faces and people and go to screaming out to God and I believe you will stop the plague hallelujah he said that's what--that's we want to say that with our hearts are bleeding for these people these Christians in that city those poor little children look God hates in the day that when all the curses are going away and there'll be no more sickness in no more sorrow we're headed to that land but we feel for those poor fathers and mothers tonight I don't feel for them knowing and experience of it I feel that Lord their poor hearts are crushed be merciful God I pray that the plague will leave this very night hallelujah I pray that the play will leave this very nice may there not be one more case broke out man stop now and may the enemy be turned back and cast into destruction may the angel of God stand over the city hallelujah I say God standing over every house standing over every home saying that whatever city that we know that when he stands every demon will scatter hallelujah every demon will scatter and when he's we see him stand and they see him lower the car listen this devil realized he ain't got it all what he thinks he has just a moment when that angel stands up he begins to tremble you think you might experience fear you ought to feel what the devil feels when you see Michael stand out and he pulled his sword for the God's people come on somebody and he stands against that cancer and he said cancer begins to tremble and run out of the temple hallelujah amen when he stands against sugar diabetes sure but whatever the case may be high blood pressure when he stands demons begin to tremble hallelujah I'm looking for a time that demons are going to tremble more than they ever have before because there's a people that's standing up on the Word of God and we ain't backing down we're not backing up we're going forward in Jesus name in Moses day as he was born alligators were fat because there's been fed all his children they were fat eating them little babies and he said no alligators just eating on him he said but yet during that time God put upon a mother's heart to place her baby right in death don't you see it was a type of Christ he went right into death but Aaron every one of my old alligators would come up to that little bitty Ark going down the river you know why they couldn't get to it why they couldn't eat that little baby there was an angel sitting there saying get away from here hallelujah he would just move a finger just stare at them with them angry eyes and said get away from here I don't know you don't think animals can't see into other realms we got we got it in the Bible where a donkey saw into another realm he saw an angel standing there hey man amen he was sitting on the basket he said and it was lined up down all the riverbanks because there was a promise floating down the river God had to make sure that promise was going to be fulfilled it didn't matter how many devils tried to stop it or how many Devils try to destroy how many Devils tried to kill it there was angels guarding that Ark it was standing between there that little baby that was helpless that bail baby they couldn't do nothing there's a crunk would've got ahold of that no one nothing the baby could do he was a baby he didn't have a gun he didn't have a bow he didn't have a rock he didn't happen to arms strong enough he had nothing he was helpless and you may feel helpless and I but don't forget your God ain't helpless your God ain't out of answers he knows every answer he knows every hard cry and he's able yes more than able he'll look at that cancer and said get out of here hallelujah and then when that happened he said see what happened God gives his angels charge to watch over his people don't you get scared honey hello holiday I'm honey I'm honey don't you get scared honey God is watching you the devil may try to do something to you but God is greater we need to remind the devil tonight God is greater hallelujah that that one may try to do something to you but God is greater alligators have to run away from that little basket when they saw the angel move he would say in Psalms 46 God is our refuge and strength a very present help a very present help in trouble therefore will not we fear we were not yet no mean won't take precautions no different than we would take precautions when it's snow and ice out on the highways Amen people want to make the statement well people are going to do this because they're scared and they're afraid no we're doing this because we're Christians and the president has asked that we do this this is not a religious persecution they're shutting down bars for heaven's sake they're shut down sporting events are shutting down and bet losing billions of dollars willing to lose it hey man and I just feel as Christians we ought to do our our civic duties to try to help in the time of need at a time of struggle a man I believe that ought to be what we do you know somebody maybe you've seen there somebody shared this with me if I can if I can bring it up real quick here but about Martin Luther how that how that he handled himself in the time of plagues I know I got to hear somewhere he up to me Haywood he would take his stand when he was you know as we know one of the messengers seven church ages he said I also ask God mercifully this was during the the black death plague he said I shall ask God mercifully to protect us hey man then I shall fumigate help purify the air administrate medicine and take it I'll so avoid places in persons where my present is not needed in order not to become contaminated contaminated and thus perchance inflict & purtz loot others and so calls their death as a result of my negligent if God should wish to take me he shall surely find me and I've done what he's expected of me Helen that sounds like a real messenger to me and so I'm not responsible for either my own death or in doing so I'm not responsible for either my own death or death of others if my neighbor needs me however I shall not avoid place or person I shall go freely as stated above see this is such a god-fearing faith because it is neither brash nor fool hardly and does not tempt God hallelujah amen so we're not facing where we he's a very present help in trouble so he knew we would be in trouble but in the trouble he's helped therefore we will not fear we will do what was necessary we'll take precautions we'll do what we have to do but we're not going to fear this thing the worst thing same thing can do upon us fins up inject you with a bunch of fear amen it's not fear that we're leaning on we're leaning on the everlasting ain't words of our lover hey men of what God's Word has spoke to us though the earth be removed and though the mountains be carried in the midst of the sea though the waters thereof roar and be troubled though the mountains shake with a swelling thereof there is a river hallelujah the streams were up shall make glad the City of God the holy place of the Tabernacles of the Most High and God is in the midst of her glories in the midst of her and she shall not be moved God shall help her the Lord who fights for us the Lord is a man of Lord that's what he was saying leads to invited fate rolling he said I want to have my honor upon them I want to show them Who I am in battle you think that doesn't learned it already but there's dumb enough to follow after but here they are Psalms 91 and verse 1 as we read heads we've read Sunday he that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide in the shadow of the Almighty I will say of the Lord he is my refuge in my fortress my god in him will I trust amen I'm gonna trust what he says before FoxNews says it or CNN says it or anybody else says it hallelujah I'm gonna trust what he said sure surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the Fowler and from the noisome pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor the arrow that flies by day nor the pestilence that walk in darkness nor for destruction that wasteth at noonday a thousand may fall at thy side and ten thousand at thy right hand but it shall not come nigh thee only with on I shall behold and see the reward of the wicked because thou has made the Lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge it's a charge it's a battle it is you ever heard or charge he will give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways they shall bear thee up in their hands lest a desk that's a foot against a stone thou shalt tread upon the lion in the adder and the young lion and dragon shalt thou trample under feet because he said it's love upon me therefore will I deliver him and I will set him on high because he had known my name he shall call upon me and I will answer him I trust what he says I will be with him in trouble I will deliver him and honor him with long life eternal life that's the life I'm longing for I mean I don't care nothing buddy live in Haiti or Haiti five if I do so beer but I'm looking for a long ride that long life is not this life that long life is eternal life and show him my salvation Noah in the day of turmoil I don't know I know who he represents but there's also four aspects of it that represents us where the Branham would take it and he would use it we're not the people that's gonna go through the tribulation but that don't mean we're not gonna go through hard times we're not exempt from hard time we're not exempt from economic downturns we're not from sickness and things is going on but we have a word he was he was given a specific instructions specific instructions how to build the ark he was told what would to take he was told what to put in it how he was to pitch it and it was to soak it with a resin and this actually brother Brennan would talk about he said means to atone this pitch means an atonement over Leviticus the same word was used for pitch in Genesis and lividity's because it uses a tone to make an atonement and now a tone is to stand between so this art was given to him to stand between him and the judgments that was against the world and the pitch that he was to pitch it with the gopher wooden art and that pitch would keep out or atone the believer from the wrath no it could not get into the wrath the waters of judgment neither could the waters of judgment get into Noah because there was a Tolman that stood between him and judgment and he said the believer in Christ is also safely secured not upon the merits of ourselves but his obedience to walk into the place or the art provided Amen wasn't when the only thing Noah had to do was get in the ark he didn't even have to shut the door God did that but walk in he said that's all the believer does is walk by faith in Christ and God takes care of the rest of it he that hears my words and believeth on him that sent me hath eternal life and shall not come into the judgment there's something a buffer our atonement that's been paid it's something that stands between you and the sin of this world and the wrath that's to come on this world he said let the judgment rock if it won't sue he said I imagined some time the art would seem to be standing on his in who I've been in a boat before in some pretty good waves and I didn't enjoy I couldn't imagine the ways that Noah went through and how bad it was and the turmoil that he went through but God had told him to get in the ark and if he done everything God said God said you'll make it through I made an atonement I made in a way of escape I've given you a place that you can go in the times of these as issues that are taking place he said imagine sometimes the ark was standing on in upside-down seemed like everything else seemed to be falling apart but Noah was safe that pitch stood between him and the judgment and he said today the blood of Jesus stands between us and all the judgment hallelujah every man comes in the world born in sin shaped iniquity comes the world speaking lies undone unlovely ungodly away from God and the alienated without hope without Christ dying going to a sinner's grave ready for judgment but then the word comes along sharper than II to it tonight cuts the tree down hears it out cuts out the stickers and all the thorn cuts the best part out of it that's real pliable and puts it in the hands of the Builder Christ then evil his life is now poured out at Calvary through the shedding of the blood and he made an atonement to protect the man that's in the Ark of safety my man just says well I believe the word I'll just take this he said but without the blood you're left to the world no matter how much you're in the heart how much arc or how much bones you got you've got to get the pitch the Holy Spirit and soak it all in this is the time to be doing that I said Lord let me draw closer to you let your Holy Spirit just wave over me and let me just let it go about you know you begin to realize things ain't so everything so world ain't what it used to be things are going on don't mean that miss world don't mean nothing there's a world in a moment okay as we've seen can be flipped on its ear there's no safe place in this world there's no 401k safe there's no bank safe there's nothing safe I mean for goodness sake we found that toilet paper ain't safe but we know a tree that was cut down and he was beaten he took the stripes he took the judgment Oh God a man of war that he might have his glory upon Satan's Kingdom he took the thing that the liquid of water and blood and then of spirit could come out of his body so that we could be sealed to the day of our Redemption that we could stand the test that we could stand when all hell is against us that he would make a way of escape a blood was released to stand between you and affliction to stand between you and sickness there is a blood they don't matter what the devil in what his name is this blood is greater whatever disease this blood is greater he's still the Lord God that heals all diseases hallelujah the next arc that was spoken of as we talked about was Moses the Bible declared that that little basket to be in art notice it was provided by a mother the one that gave him the birth not through some seminary not something through some theological experience but the one who gives the believer birth prepares an art for him hallelujah this art that I got wasn't prepared by even like tabernacle he wasn't prepared by some man he wasn't prepared by some theologian or some intellectual conception this art was prepared by the one who gave birth to me he built it specifically for Laodicea he knows exactly what we're going through and the Ark was a type holding down through Noah holding down through Moses holding down there every situation through the Bible as a buffer and something to hold against the plagues and the storms and the bastion against the boat but let me tell you this boat will hold this Ark will hold she's not going down she's going up in desires Hill into the glory of God that mother would weave that Ark with some flak stalkers little corn stalks that they would have push it across the river never no one if she's if she was gonna see her baby again or not and she slide slammed it with pitch same word pitch to atone the little baby Moses laid in the basket pushed out into the judgment of waters he said water always means the sickness thickness and multitudes of people a little fellow out there probably a little cover over his face out in the Ark out of the Nile and reeds and bushes bullrushes and alligators and everything all around the Nile the rains and the storms have blowing through there the gales but a little rock art riding it out little Moses looking up towards a little starlit skies night wind to blow and Howlin he said well what was happening he was directing that boat to this right place oh now the jumping crocodiles going on in the basket but he was safe protected standing between wasn't atonement between him and all the gates and the gales and heavy winds the devil could sin nothing would upset that little heart he floated right through it and he said I could see the great Holy Spirit standing above it he said I can see the angels of God sitting near with her sword strong nothing is going to touch it he said I can see the devil trying to sink the ark with Noah in it and Noah's singing Jesus keep me near the cross or whatever was all the Devils in hell couldn't sink it because it was built according to God's instruction and there was an atonement standing between the judgment and mercy and every believer today now matter how hard they may seem how hard life may see as long as you're in Christ Jesus there's nothing present nor future can keep you from reaching the goal of Jesus Christ the devil's can try to come and turn every Dale and hair loose on you but God's got an atonement standing between you and the devil we see the church going in this great exit to see the pillar of fire before him standing for God performing miracles and science and he's here still tonight with all the same redeeming powers the same resmii he's here to make every sinner whole amen take back ever backslider he's here to heal every sick person he's here to fool in full gospel full power and full demonstration hey man he said what is it he said you need to eat the whole lamb you roast it with the Holy Ghost no one will that is good eating but the Holy Spirit has divined it to us it's real good taste and see that the Lord is good Amen our Lord Jesus is here and his love and power and his great redemptive blessings and all how he stands between the church and sin he stands between you and judgment he stands between you and sickness he is standing even now hellooo yeah he says when that pillar of fire moved and he went and stood between the children of Israel in Egypt and the Egyptians he said I want you to solisten think about this he said every let this soak in every believer born-again child of God when death comes stealing to the door prematurely the angel of God stands between you and the sickness he's now if you want to run right to it that's your business but you don't have to he's standing between you and death hallelujah he's standing between you and death he said notice the children of Israel he God came and stood between them and the danger he's still the same God today a man nothing let's call him spot surprise he knows what is going on and he's here to stand between we can see when he stood with the prophet of God as as that maniac would make a challenge and he would challenge him and he would come and spit in his face and and make the challenge and say you know you're a hypocrite your deceiver you stand up here and act like before these people impose yourself to be a man sent from God I'll show how much your sinful my break every bone in your frail body tonight well physically speaking he was certainly able to do it he weighed nearly 300 pounds I suppose about 6 foot 2 and arms big he said his eyes were say his teeth scissor together I kept on speaking he rushed towards me to run me over and said I'll break every bone in your body he said you better know what your heart or what you're talking about them times there's no chance there for you to bluff yourself you better just let God have his way hallelujah so you just just blood don't Bluff he said you better let God have his way he promised me when he sent me he would take care of it and it's up to him to do it and he will do it in every battle hallelujah he will do it in every battle so I turned around him and I stood there for a few minutes a second or two and I called I called he called me a snake in the grass and he spit right in my face and I started to say something like I wouldn't do that my friend I was gonna say that but instead the angel of the Lord came whirling in and he stood between us and he said tonight you'll fall over my feet and you'll bow to the name of the Lord Jesus and it wasn't me that was God so both made prophecies both make challenges both spirits now who was right was the next thing and he said I'll show you whose feet I bow to and he run behind he drawn his big old fist everybody just felt behind of course all those demons sitting there that was their legion it was love watching and he sure I serves I'm talking to spiritual people that was Legion and then I went to the fella like the life from the days of oh he's I show you feed off all over and as he drew back I said Satan come out of the man and he made a big scream threw up his hands and his eyes went that way and felt till the police had to take him off my feet and they thought he was a dead man and he said as he was raised he delivers and no sorry worship that spirit he won't give it up but I would you have him move him off my feet and so when they got there I turned to the audience and said as I was saying what was he saying faith is the substance of things hoped for went right back to the word not to fear not to worry not to wonder if there's anybody else there but right back to the word as I was saying faith is the substance of things hoped for and while I was speaking a man sitting the wheelchair raised up a lady on the stretcher jumped up and the next in a few minutes there was people healed all over the building and the next morning had to get a big truck people see and only believe walking behind the big truck full of stretchers and wheelchairs and everything what was it the chief of that tribe of demons had made the challenge and lost I want to give news to the devil you're gonna lose because you're not challenging just the bride of Jesus Christ you're challenging the captain of our Lord's host and he accepts your challenge and when the Spirit of God struck the building everyone was healed hallelujah he would say in Zechariah's we bring this down and Zachariah to one I lifted up my eyes again and looked and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand then said I whither goest thou and he said unto me to measure Jerusalem to see what is the breadth thereof and what is the length thereof and behold the angel that talked with me went forth and another angel went out to meet him and said unto him run speak to this young man saith Jerusalem shall be inhabited in all hallelujah Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein for I saith the Lord will be unto her a wall of fire round about a wall of fire and about and will be the glory in the midst of her holiday we're not looking to some man's glory we're looking to the glory of the Lord we're looking for him to show up in our homes we're looking for him to show up in our search we're looking for the glory of God to come upon his people to give them wisdom to give them understanding to know what to do he cain't Daniel understanding he gave the three Hebrew children understanding he's not going to leave us without understanding he's gonna let us know what's gonna happen cuz he said I'm gonna pour out my spirit and the young men shall see visions and the old men shall dream dreams hallelujah he's gonna give us understanding he's gonna speak because he is the Lord the man of war ho ho come forth and flee from the land of the North sent the Lord Frey's spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven sent the Lord deliver that simple Zion that dwellest with the daughters of babbling for dust saith the Lord of hosts after glory hath he sent unto me unto the nations who
