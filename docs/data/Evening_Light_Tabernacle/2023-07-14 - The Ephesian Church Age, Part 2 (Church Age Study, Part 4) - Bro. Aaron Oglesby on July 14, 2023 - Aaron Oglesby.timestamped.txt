[17:02] tonight Lord and help our eyes to be
[17:03] open Lord into a greater way we ask you
[17:06] to come now and take control in Jesus
[17:09] name amen
[17:11] amen I I like to Echo what what brother
[17:15] Joe had said about the importance of of
[17:19] the contents in in the in the church age
[17:21] book every every major doctrine that we
[17:24] believe is in that book and and and one
[17:27] thing I just want to reiterate is that
[17:30] that these Services what I'm really
[17:31] hoping that they'll do is just be to to
[17:34] come behind and reinforce and strengthen
[17:37] what it is you've already read so I
[17:39] would like to ask that you do your best
[17:42] to make sure you've read
[17:44] um each portion Before We Gather and
[17:46] that's really was my desire in all this
[17:48] is that each one of you can say I I have
[17:50] read the church age book I've dug into
[17:52] it I found these truths for myself and
[17:55] and I promise you not just in these
[17:57] youth services but on Wednesdays and
[17:59] Sundays as you sit here and hear the
[18:00] word come forth you're going to begin to
[18:02] recognize and see things that you've
[18:04] been reading for yourself and you'll be
[18:06] able to place those things in the
[18:08] scripture and it won't just be what my
[18:10] daddy believes this or my mama believes
[18:12] this or this is what brother Tim says
[18:14] but you'll be able to know oh I know
[18:15] where that comes from because I've read
[18:17] it for myself so so thank you for those
[18:19] of you that have made sure to keep up
[18:21] with the reading and if you hadn't been
[18:23] I would just like to encourage you to do
[18:24] so so we're going to start
[18:27] tonight by reading the message to the
[18:30] Ephesian church again we started the
[18:32] Ephesian Church age last time and do the
[18:34] length of it we broke it into two parts
[18:36] and so tonight we'll be covering the
[18:38] second part of that and we're going to
[18:40] start with the message to the Ephesian
[18:42] age and it says unto the angel of the
[18:45] Church of Ephesus write these things
[18:47] saith he that holdeth the Seven Stars in
[18:50] his right hand and who walketh in the
[18:53] midst of the seven golden candlesticks
[18:56] just like that song We were singing how
[18:58] we know he's with us this right here
[18:59] shows that he's in the midst of the
[19:02] seven golden candlesticks so we know
[19:04] that he's still here all the way till
[19:06] the end of time we can take solace in
[19:09] that he says I Know Thy works and thy
[19:11] labor and thy patience and how thou
[19:13] can'tst not bear them which are evil and
[19:16] thou has tried them which say they are
[19:18] Apostles and are not and has found them
[19:20] liars and has borne and has patience and
[19:23] for my name's sake has labored and has
[19:25] not fainted never the less I have
[19:28] somewhat against thee because thou has
[19:30] left thy First Love remember therefore
[19:34] from which thou are fallen and repent
[19:36] and do the first works or else I will
[19:38] come unto thee quickly and remove thy
[19:40] Candlestick out of his place except thou
[19:44] repent but this thou Hast that thou hate
[19:48] us the Deeds of the Nicolaitans which I
[19:52] also hate
[19:53] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[19:56] the spirit saith unto the churches to
[19:58] him that overcometh will I give to each
[20:00] of the tree of life which is in the
[20:02] midst of the paradise of God Amen I pray
[20:06] the Lord without his blessings to the
[20:07] word as you take your seats
[20:11] every time I go through the church age
[20:13] book and begin to read and study I'm
[20:15] amazed at how much more I come across
[20:18] and how much more is opened up to to me
[20:21] so I'm thankful even for myself to be
[20:23] going through this again and having the
[20:25] opportunity because the word is just so
[20:27] rich and there's just so much in it and
[20:29] you never can you never can get get it
[20:32] all out it's just so much for us to to
[20:34] dig into and we last time just to
[20:37] briefly review we we talked about how
[20:39] brother Branham said there was a key
[20:40] that allowed him to to determine who The
[20:44] Messengers were and to go through these
[20:46] Church ages and he said the key is is
[20:48] the Revelation that God never changes
[20:52] and that his ways are as unchangeable as
[20:56] he is and he tells us that the lord gave
[20:59] him this key and it allowed him to
[21:01] discover the messengers at each age and
[21:04] this is the very scripture that is at
[21:06] the core of the message Hebrews 13 8 and
[21:09] that is that God never changes he is the
[21:12] same yesterday today and forever and so
[21:15] what he did in the first age he'll have
[21:17] to keep on doing until the very until
[21:20] it's done until the last age so he
[21:23] teaches us that the kind of man that God
[21:26] chose in the first age and how he
[21:28] operated and how the the ministry
[21:31] manifested through that that ministry
[21:33] will be how God does it in each and
[21:36] every age and so it was that key that
[21:38] allowed him to determine who the The
[21:40] Messengers were to each age and we
[21:43] learned that Paul was the messenger to
[21:46] the Ephesian Age and and we talked about
[21:48] how that that Paul being the messenger
[21:50] we dealt not only with Paul but with
[21:52] Pentecost and how that it was the
[21:54] pattern for every Church going forward
[21:57] brother Branham says the true church
[21:59] will always be the one that tries to
[22:02] follow in the steps of her Founders at
[22:05] Pentecost so we talked about that and we
[22:08] also talked about and we introduced
[22:10] among other things that there were two
[22:12] Vines there's a True Vine and there's
[22:14] also a false Vine and that's where we're
[22:17] going to pick up this time with with the
[22:20] seed of nicolaitanism the seed
[22:23] of nicolaitanism and in Revelation 2 and
[22:27] 6 we just read this it says but this
[22:30] thou Hast that thou hatest the Deeds of
[22:34] the Nicolaitans which I also hate
[22:40] so after God has told them what he has
[22:43] against them in the earlier verses and
[22:45] how they had left their first love and
[22:47] and how they must repent or else they're
[22:49] going to have their light taken away
[22:50] he's kind of he's come down on him a
[22:52] little bit he says I got this against
[22:54] you and you've done this and you've done
[22:55] this but then he comes back around he
[22:57] says but I want to compliment you on
[22:59] something I want to tell you what it is
[23:01] that I like about you here and he says
[23:03] that you hate the Deeds of the
[23:06] Nicolaitans and he says so do I not only
[23:10] do you hate them but so do I so we have
[23:12] that in common and he's complimenting
[23:14] them here and I think it would behoove
[23:16] us if God hates this and he likes it
[23:19] when we hate it too it would behoove us
[23:22] to find out what these were and make
[23:25] sure that we hate it to find out what
[23:28] these Deeds of the Nicolaitans are to
[23:31] stay as far away from it as possible and
[23:33] if need be to preach against that thing
[23:35] with all our might because God hates it
[23:38] and it's obvious that we're not to have
[23:40] the these Deeds within our church within
[23:42] ourselves within the move of God Amen
[23:46] so he says here whatever starts in the
[23:50] early Church Must continue in every age
[23:53] until it is finally blessed and exalted
[23:56] by God or destroyed as an unclean thing
[24:00] in the Lake of Fire so we learned a key
[24:02] earlier that that God is unchangeable
[24:04] and in his ways but this is another key
[24:07] concept to watch as we go along and that
[24:10] that the seeds that are planted early on
[24:13] will continue to grow and manifest as we
[24:16] go down Through the Ages so things that
[24:19] are just seeds will grow and become
[24:21] deeds and become doctrines and as you go
[24:23] through the ages they will manifest
[24:25] fully as we continue he says thus we see
[24:29] seeds in Ephesus that will continue and
[24:33] will become a doctrine that will go
[24:35] right up to and into the Lake of Fire
[24:39] amen so so so if it's of God it's going
[24:43] to grow and it's going to be blessed and
[24:45] it's going to be exalted
[24:46] like he says in this first quote he said
[24:49] but if it's planted by the wicked one
[24:51] it's going to be destroyed in the Lake
[24:53] of Fire remember we talked about last
[24:55] time the parable of the wheat and the
[24:58] tares and we covered that and it says
[25:00] but while men slept his enemy came and
[25:03] sowed tears among the wheat and went his
[25:06] way
[25:07] what was this these were seeds that were
[25:09] planted that were not planted by God
[25:12] they were planted by the wicked one they
[25:15] were planted by his enemy seeds not of
[25:18] God and these seeds are going to grow
[25:19] together
[25:21] all right the wheat and the tares are
[25:23] going to grow together all the way up
[25:25] until they manifest what they are
[25:28] and The Good Seed will be taken into the
[25:30] Garner
[25:31] and the tares are going to be bundled
[25:33] for the burning so what we see is the
[25:36] seeds of the Nicolaitans right here
[25:38] aren't fully manifested you're not
[25:40] exactly sure what they are they're still
[25:42] in seed form
[25:43] they're not fully manifested yet in the
[25:46] Ephesian age but the seeds are planted
[25:48] in the Ephesian age and they quickly
[25:51] began to grow and begin to manifest what
[25:55] they are and more importantly who they
[25:58] are of
[25:59] and that's what we're going to deal with
[26:01] not just what are they but who are they
[26:03] of what do these seeds come from and
[26:07] brother Brandon would tell us that the
[26:09] word nicolaitan comes from two Greek
[26:11] words Nico meaning to conquer
[26:14] and Laos meaning the laity
[26:17] so there in that early age you had some
[26:20] thing or some person or some Authority
[26:23] brother Branham would say
[26:25] that was going about trying to conquer
[26:28] the laity now just so we understand what
[26:30] that means what is the laity
[26:32] you are
[26:33] the laity just means the people
[26:36] the The Everyday People of the church
[26:39] something was going around trying to
[26:41] control the people trying to take away
[26:44] freedom from the people there in that
[26:47] very first age
[26:48] and God said there in verse he says but
[26:50] this thou has thou hate us the Deeds of
[26:54] the Nicolaitans which I also hate so
[26:57] just uh not in detail but to say this
[27:00] what is this that he's hating he's
[27:02] hating people trying to exert authority
[27:05] over his people
[27:07] he's hating men trying to come in and
[27:09] control his people and take authority
[27:11] upon themselves to try to to rein in
[27:14] people's worship to try to take people's
[27:16] freedom to try to take it to where it's
[27:18] not about a spiritual Revelation anymore
[27:20] but what we tell you to do he says I
[27:23] hate this and that first age hated it as
[27:26] well and I want to say again when we
[27:29] whenever we buy the word see how that
[27:32] Spirit acts when I say that Spirit I'm
[27:34] talking about nicolaitanism we when we
[27:37] see how that acts then we as the True
[27:39] Vine must hate it too
[27:43] and that's what it is when he says Thou
[27:45] hate us the Deeds of the Nicolaitans
[27:46] he's speaking to the True Vine and the
[27:49] True Vine will never be able to sit back
[27:51] and take that nicolaitan Spirit they'll
[27:53] never be okay with that lukewarm formal
[27:56] Spirit but the True Vine will hate the
[27:59] Deeds of the Nicolaitans
[28:03] the true and the false Vine and we
[28:06] talked about this just a little bit
[28:08] just a little bit last time that there's
[28:10] is two two parts
[28:13] that intertwine but are completely
[28:15] opposite two different plants and God
[28:18] did not plant the tares we see that in
[28:21] the in the in the wheat in the Terrors
[28:24] Parable that we talked about Satan
[28:26] planted those tares right amongst the
[28:30] good seed of God now keep your mind
[28:32] where we're at we're at the very
[28:34] beginning the first church age and
[28:37] brother Brandon would type it to like
[28:38] the Genesis of the church he said that
[28:41] first age was just like the Book of
[28:43] Genesis so we're right at the beginning
[28:45] and Satan comes in and plants Terrors
[28:48] amongst the good seed of God
[28:50] and so now we have two kinds of plants
[28:52] or
[28:53] people
[28:55] two types of people because when I tell
[28:57] you that there's two different vines in
[28:59] the church you know we're not looking
[29:00] around looking for Greenery
[29:03] we're talking about two different types
[29:04] of people and so there's two different
[29:07] plants or people from two different
[29:10] seeds that grow up together
[29:14] they come up together all right and the
[29:17] same was true in the Ephesian church and
[29:19] as we already said if it was true in the
[29:21] Ephesian Church it must be true all the
[29:25] way till the very end so it's still true
[29:27] today
[29:28] it was true in every other age and it's
[29:31] true today but it was there in the
[29:32] Ephesian church it was made up of good
[29:34] seed
[29:35] and bad or the True Vine and the false
[29:39] Vine those are there and two Vines
[29:43] make up the church listen to brother
[29:46] rounds he says religion and the
[29:48] spiritual world are made of those two
[29:50] trees which had their roots in Eden both
[29:54] the tree of life and the tree of
[29:57] knowledge of Good and Evil stood in the
[30:00] midst of the garden and no doubt their
[30:02] very branches intertwined each other
[30:05] what a thought
[30:07] so close together
[30:09] so close together that their branches
[30:12] would intertwine and and and Seed from
[30:16] both of these
[30:17] make up the church now when we say the
[30:20] church that's one thing I want you to
[30:22] remember is we're talking about all the
[30:25] church not like just this church
[30:28] but all the church Christendom
[30:31] you're talking about the church not just
[30:33] evening like Tabernacle so those two
[30:36] Vines make up the church and within
[30:40] those within the church as we said that
[30:42] there are two Vines a false find and a
[30:44] true vinyl don't let this worry you
[30:46] don't let this make you afraid and scare
[30:49] you well how do we know what's true how
[30:51] do we know what what's right how will we
[30:53] know how how do we understand what is
[30:56] what and what is true and what that's
[30:57] false and I want to remind you tonight
[30:59] that the elect or the True Vine will
[31:03] never be deceived so don't let that fear
[31:06] come in of all my be accidentally taken
[31:09] over here to the falls and this is going
[31:10] to come now listen the True Vine will
[31:13] never be deceived brother Branham says
[31:17] in only the elect will really know which
[31:19] is the true Spirit only the elect will
[31:22] not be deceived Matthew 24 24 for there
[31:26] shall I Rise false Christ and false
[31:28] prophets and shall sow great signs and
[31:30] wonders and so much that if it were
[31:34] possible
[31:35] if it were possible it shall deceive the
[31:39] very elect and I know we've covered this
[31:41] before but sometimes people look at that
[31:43] and they're like it's going to be so
[31:45] close I'm so worried about it it's going
[31:47] to be so close and they allow that
[31:48] scripture to actually bring fear when in
[31:51] reality it should do just the opposite
[31:53] because when you read it it tells you
[31:55] you cannot be deceived you're not going
[31:58] to be deceived you're going to recognize
[32:00] truth truth is going to call your name
[32:02] you're not going to fall you're not
[32:04] going to stumble you're predestinated
[32:06] not to fall
[32:08] if it were possible you could be
[32:10] deceived but it's not it's not possible
[32:16] so when God speaks to the church
[32:19] he is speaking to both the True Vine and
[32:23] the false Vine he's addressing both of
[32:25] them
[32:26] brother Brown says when he speaks he
[32:28] when he says the church
[32:29] he's talking to everybody that's in the
[32:31] church
[32:33] and he's calling them both the church
[32:35] and so so very early on just a few years
[32:40] Beyond Pentecost
[32:42] the false Vine begins to entangle itself
[32:45] with the truth now keep that image as we
[32:48] had in the garden of the image of the
[32:49] branches so close together think about
[32:52] that so close and so the false Vine
[32:54] begins to entangle itself with the true
[32:57] and it begins to fight truth it begins
[33:00] to to fight Revelation it begins to
[33:03] fight the moving of the spirit it begins
[33:05] to try to reign in the way people
[33:07] worship and early on it's fighting the
[33:10] True Vine and it's going to continue to
[33:13] do that all the way up until it's
[33:16] destroyed in the Lake of Fire young
[33:18] people you will be in a battle all the
[33:20] way up until the Lake of Fire which
[33:23] we're not going into by the way but it
[33:25] says that's where the false Vine will go
[33:27] because it hates the life that's in the
[33:29] True Vine it hates the life that you
[33:31] have and if you don't have it if that
[33:33] seed hasn't been quickened its very goal
[33:36] is to keep it from being quickened in
[33:38] your life so it fights you to such you
[33:40] won't get it and then once you get it it
[33:43] hates you even more and it fights you
[33:44] even more so you're going to be in a
[33:47] continual battle but let me remind you
[33:48] tonight we're the winners you are going
[33:51] to make it you are going to overcome and
[33:53] you're not going to stumble and fall
[33:54] short amen
[33:58] he tells us that that first church began
[34:00] to drift
[34:02] and it began to lose its first love
[34:05] and even before we go into it right now
[34:08] I want you to think about you
[34:11] at your highest point in your
[34:13] relationship with the Lord when I say
[34:14] that I mean the way you felt
[34:17] the Zeal you have
[34:19] where are you at how you felt after that
[34:21] camp experience or maybe that experience
[34:23] right here or that experience at home
[34:24] wherever it was when you so fell in love
[34:27] and you knew he loved you and you loved
[34:29] him I want to ask you are you still
[34:31] there or better yet are you even beyond
[34:34] that
[34:35] or have you slid back from that place
[34:38] is that love burning just as strong as
[34:41] it was at first when it was your first
[34:44] love when it was more important than
[34:46] anything else
[34:47] when it was more important than your
[34:49] entertainment or your day-to-day when it
[34:51] was what you thought about when you
[34:53] couldn't go through a day without prayer
[34:55] when you couldn't go through a day
[34:57] without feeding
[34:58] on the word where are you at right now
[35:01] in relation to where that place was
[35:04] because they began to fall from their
[35:06] origin or fall from their birth
[35:09] and the Bible tells us that they left
[35:11] their first love and I want to tell you
[35:14] tonight don't let that happen to you
[35:16] don't let yourself begin to fall back
[35:18] don't don't lose the passion you have
[35:20] for the word don't lose the excitement
[35:22] for coming to the house of God don't
[35:24] even let a Friday night use service just
[35:26] be a I wish he'd get done so we could go
[35:28] to the gym
[35:30] but let the passion be there that I know
[35:32] this is life I know I gotta have this I
[35:35] know I need more and let it be what
[35:37] drives you and pushes you because as you
[35:39] slide back from that place and cool off
[35:41] you become an easy target
[35:45] don't let things begin to creep in
[35:46] things of the world that you know don't
[35:49] please God don't let those things creep
[35:51] in even if they're not quote unquote
[35:53] things that would send me to hell
[35:55] I've often said it's time that we quit
[35:57] looking at things and asking the
[35:58] question is this right and wrong and ask
[36:01] the question does this please God
[36:04] is this something that pleases him
[36:06] brother Branham goes into it in this
[36:08] chapter where he talks about do all that
[36:10] you do in the name of Jesus
[36:12] and if you can't don't do it
[36:15] but where are you at
[36:17] they had fallen from their first love
[36:19] from their origin they're at Pentecost
[36:22] but when you begin to lose that daily
[36:24] seeking of A Closer Walk
[36:27] that that day that daily seeking of a
[36:30] deeper experience and for more
[36:32] Revelation than you become vulnerable to
[36:35] the Grievous wolves that Paul talked
[36:37] about
[36:38] because you've drifted away from the
[36:40] shepherd
[36:41] you've drifted away from the one that's
[36:42] going to protect you from the ones that
[36:44] want to kill you
[36:46] wolves that come in with enticing words
[36:50] and they begin to lead you astray from
[36:52] Holy Spirit leadership
[36:56] brother Branham says they began to
[36:58] follow man's leadership instead of the
[37:00] leadership of the Holy Spirit
[37:04] he tells us that it was the same thing
[37:06] that had happened to Israel when they
[37:08] came out of Egypt and he says the way of
[37:11] God excuse me I accidentally changed
[37:13] slides he says the way of God was to
[37:16] lead by The Cloud of fire prophetic
[37:19] utterance Miracles and signs and
[37:22] god-given wonders this was to be
[37:24] accomplished by God selected and God
[37:27] ordained and God equipped and God sent
[37:30] men with the now here we go here's the
[37:33] difference the Nicolaitans will say see
[37:36] they're supposed to be led by by men
[37:38] but he finishes that by saying with the
[37:41] whole Camp being dominated by a holy
[37:45] ghost move
[37:47] the whole Camp being dominated by a holy
[37:51] ghost move
[37:54] he says that is exactly how the first
[37:56] church age started and it will get worse
[37:59] and worse until the holy spirit is
[38:01] completely rejected and God Must Destroy
[38:05] the people what happened to Israel they
[38:09] came out they seen signs they'd seen
[38:11] wonders they seen the hand of God opened
[38:12] the Red Sea but then they began to want
[38:14] rules and regulations
[38:16] they began to want a king like the
[38:18] others and they wanted to fit in with
[38:20] the world and when they did that they
[38:22] lost the pillar of fire leadership and
[38:25] the same thing is what's happening in
[38:28] that first age as they began to look
[38:29] more like the worldly church as they
[38:31] began to get away from the move of the
[38:33] spirit when they began to get a little
[38:35] embarrassed by people jumping and
[38:37] shouting and saying we don't need all
[38:39] that is they got cold and they got
[38:40] formal they began to lose the leadership
[38:43] of the pillar of Fire
[38:45] and the people in the Pulpit began to
[38:48] tell them you don't need that you don't
[38:49] have to have that and they took and they
[38:51] vested it all upon themselves
[38:54] and you end up with the people who
[38:56] aren't in the word for themselves so
[38:57] they don't know when they're being led
[38:59] astray
[39:00] that's what we're saying in reading this
[39:02] church age book I want you when you hear
[39:04] something to come across this desk I
[39:06] want you to go yes I know that's in the
[39:08] word because I've been feeding on it for
[39:10] myself but if you don't feed and you
[39:12] don't dig and you don't look you can be
[39:14] told anything
[39:17] do you know how many brother Branham
[39:18] said there is out there that brother
[39:20] Branham never said
[39:25] don't fall away because then you become
[39:27] a target of the leadership of man that
[39:29] will lead you away from the move of the
[39:31] Holy Spirit but stay fervent stay in
[39:34] love continue feeding
[39:36] but Israel fell away just like this just
[39:38] like the first age and that nicolete and
[39:41] spirit Spirit began to teach against the
[39:44] experience
[39:45] any body who teaches against the
[39:49] experience of the new birth is under a
[39:52] nicolaitan spirit
[39:54] and that is nicolaitanism
[39:57] it began to teach against the experience
[40:00] of the new birth it's hard against the
[40:02] moving of the spirit and slowly the
[40:05] power of God in their midst was lost
[40:09] young people you've been blessed to be
[40:11] raised up in a time and not only in a
[40:13] time but in a place to where it is
[40:16] fostered and and we accept the moving of
[40:18] the spirit and we want the moving of the
[40:20] spirit and we look for the moving of the
[40:22] spirit don't ever take that for granted
[40:24] I say in the first stage that was lost
[40:26] but we live in a time where it's been
[40:28] restored and you need to make it a cry
[40:30] within your own heart that it will not
[40:32] be lost again on my watch I Won't Let It
[40:34] Go by the wayside I won't take it for
[40:36] granted but when I come on Wednesday
[40:38] night I'm looking for a move of the
[40:40] spirit when I come on Sunday I'm looking
[40:42] for more of God I'm asking God move in a
[40:44] mighty way move in a miraculous way
[40:46] because if you get to where you're
[40:49] comfortable with services without the
[40:51] moving of God
[40:52] and you get to a place where that's okay
[40:55] and you quit expecting it it quits
[40:59] happening
[41:02] I'll just speak for my own home when we
[41:04] go several listen we we understand let
[41:06] me make it very clear
[41:08] there are many different ways in which
[41:10] the spirit of God moves
[41:13] and every one don't have to be what we
[41:15] would call one that makes everybody jump
[41:17] shout dance Rejoice but those are good
[41:20] I like those
[41:23] but the spirit of God moves in every
[41:25] service if we allow him to it's not
[41:26] always the same way
[41:28] but you know what I'm talking about when
[41:30] I say there are times where it seems
[41:32] like it's just ready to break out in the
[41:34] place and you can almost feel it and
[41:36] maybe it doesn't
[41:38] and then maybe it goes that way for a
[41:40] few services and me and my wife me and
[41:42] sister Lydia will be talking like I'm so
[41:44] ready for that I'm so ready for that
[41:46] outpouring I'm so ready for that
[41:48] manifestation and and we'll even begin
[41:50] to pray you know Lord don't let it be me
[41:51] that's hindering it don't let it be me I
[41:53] felt it there I sensed it there it was
[41:55] ready to move there was people ready to
[41:57] be delivered what's holding it back
[42:00] but never get to the place where you can
[42:02] go service after service after service
[42:03] and just be like
[42:06] that was fine we came together we sang
[42:09] some songs we preached and we went home
[42:10] no but why do we come here to draw
[42:13] closer to experience more to go deeper
[42:16] to have a greater relationship with the
[42:18] Lord Jesus Christ if you've Fallen away
[42:21] from your first love get back to that we
[42:24] live in a time where it has been
[42:26] restored and we must be willing to fight
[42:28] for that fight for the Holy Spirit fight
[42:31] for for the experiences fight for altar
[42:33] cause fight for prayer lines fight for
[42:35] deliverance fight that the spirit of God
[42:37] can have freedom I want to say it again
[42:39] it's not that we come here looking for
[42:41] you to act any certain way during a
[42:43] service but that you have the freedom to
[42:46] act how you feel led to when the spirit
[42:48] falls upon you the freedom to worship
[42:51] completely and holy however you feel led
[42:53] to do it
[42:57] what are you saying
[42:59] tonight I'm saying fall in love again
[43:02] fall in love again brother Brandon would
[43:04] he would say he would say you know they
[43:06] they waited too long
[43:08] they waited too long because the
[43:09] scripture says repent he says apparently
[43:12] they waited too long to do it it says
[43:14] remember therefore from which Thou Art
[43:15] Fallen
[43:17] where did you come from this is Brother
[43:19] Brown I'm talking from Pentecost you
[43:22] fell down to where you are now
[43:24] backsliding repent and do the first
[43:27] Works go back to Pentecost again or else
[43:30] I will come unto thee quickly
[43:34] apparently they'd slid away from from
[43:36] where things were in the upper room and
[43:38] from from where they had originated at
[43:46] Deeds to doctrines
[43:51] he says see how it started out in the
[43:53] early church
[43:54] it was called Deeds then it became a
[43:57] Doctrine it became the standard it
[44:00] became the unbending way and it finally
[44:02] took over and God was pushed aside what
[44:07] do you think is happening when people
[44:08] say we don't need the moving of the
[44:10] spirit
[44:12] we don't need his gifts
[44:14] think about it in a very
[44:17] carnal way for a minute I understand
[44:19] that that gifts don't save you we
[44:21] understand all that but just think for a
[44:23] minute boys
[44:25] you like a girl and she supposedly likes
[44:27] you
[44:28] and every time you bring her a gift that
[44:31] you got just for her just because you
[44:33] wanted to bless her
[44:35] she said I don't need that give that to
[44:37] somebody else
[44:39] that's that's for the denominations and
[44:42] they take your gift and give it to
[44:43] another girl
[44:45] we don't need your gifts
[44:48] how are you going to feel about that
[44:49] relationship
[44:53] you got a fiance that you know that's
[44:56] going to be your bride
[44:58] and you bring them something they go
[45:00] that's that's old fat get that away from
[45:03] me I don't want that
[45:10] I ain't got to tell you how to feel I
[45:11] think you know how you'd feel
[45:14] think about when when when when Ellie
[45:17] easier came to find a bride and went and
[45:19] went to the well and all the gifts that
[45:22] he brought yeah it wasn't the bridegroom
[45:24] but it was gifts from the bridegroom
[45:27] and what if she said you brought me this
[45:31] tongues that's the least of the gifts
[45:33] why do I want that
[45:35] think about the attitude we have towards
[45:37] the gifts
[45:40] and Christ is just pushed aside
[45:44] so what it was in this first age the
[45:46] actions of a few began to take hold and
[45:49] people began to surrender their rights
[45:51] listen a lot of it goes on with what's
[45:54] said in the Pulpit no doubt there's
[45:55] pulpits that will be held accountable
[45:58] but don't you ever surrender your rights
[46:01] don't you ever back up off the freedom
[46:03] that God has given you and your right to
[46:05] freedom of worship and freedom in the
[46:07] spirit don't you ever give up your
[46:09] rights because apparently they're in the
[46:11] first age even though Jude had called
[46:13] out to him and said contend
[46:15] apparently most of them didn't contend
[46:18] they let it go and now God's leadership
[46:20] was pushed aside and man's leadership
[46:22] was fully instituted
[46:24] no notice when we say this we're not
[46:26] talking about God called men leading by
[46:29] the spirit
[46:30] and leading by the word
[46:32] we're talking about the Grievous wolves
[46:34] that would come in and take authority on
[46:37] themselves and Lead according to their
[46:39] desires and Lead men away from the Holy
[46:42] Spirit and Lead men unto themselves
[46:47] and then with that as few as many begin
[46:50] to give up their rights the false Vine
[46:52] began to come in and squeeze the life
[46:55] out of the church
[46:57] that's why a church with no leadership
[46:59] of the spirit and no moving of the
[47:02] spirit will be void of the works of the
[47:04] spirit because the life that produces
[47:07] the works of the spirit is not allowed
[47:09] to operate in that place
[47:11] that's why they don't see it because
[47:14] they don't allow it to move the life
[47:16] that produces those things isn't allowed
[47:18] to operate
[47:19] and brother Brown says the True Vine
[47:21] hated the formal Deeds of the
[47:24] Nicolaitans and so did God
[47:29] he says oh it started so small so
[47:32] quietly so inoffensively it looked so
[47:35] good
[47:36] stop right there
[47:38] that's why you take it back to the word
[47:42] it looks so good but is it in the word
[47:45] well you shouldn't do that because we've
[47:47] moved beyond that but is it in the word
[47:50] either way whether somebody tells you
[47:51] you should or shouldn't take it back to
[47:53] the word and find out whether you should
[47:55] or shouldn't
[47:56] always take it back to where he said it
[47:58] looks so good it seems so sound then it
[48:01] caught a hold like a python
[48:03] brother Aaron why are y'all constantly
[48:05] talking about this why are you
[48:07] constantly well listen read the church
[48:09] age book and ask the prophet why was he
[48:11] constantly talking about it
[48:15] because I promise you we don't emphasize
[48:17] it any more than the prophet did
[48:21] but why because if it ever takes a hold
[48:24] if formalism ever takes a hold it
[48:28] squeezes the very life out of you like a
[48:30] python it squeezed out the very breath
[48:32] and killed all the
[48:35] spirituality that there was in the
[48:38] church
[48:39] nicolaitanism kills the spirituality
[48:43] it kills the moving of the spirit it
[48:46] kills the atmosphere of worship and
[48:48] therefore it kills the opportunity at a
[48:51] birth
[48:52] and if you get to the root of it and
[48:53] we'll try to bring this back around at
[48:55] the end that's exactly what it's trying
[48:57] to do
[48:58] it doesn't want you to have the new
[49:02] birth
[49:03] how would you like to be held
[49:05] accountable as one who believed that
[49:07] that you were teaching God's word and
[49:10] yet you were keeping people from the
[49:12] very birth they had to have to go in a
[49:14] rapture
[49:16] and yet that spirit's fighting against
[49:19] the New Birth
[49:21] young people we can't let it in
[49:24] that's why we're constantly on it that's
[49:26] why we're constantly pointing it out
[49:28] that's why we're constantly talking
[49:30] about the moving of the spirit and the
[49:31] freedom of the spirit and the new birth
[49:33] and weeping your way to Calvary and have
[49:35] an experience for yourself because we
[49:37] can't let that in and it starts so small
[49:39] it starts so innocent he says it looks
[49:42] so good
[49:45] you know it usually starts with trying
[49:46] to protect the people from fanaticism
[49:50] it starts under the guise of protection
[49:53] and guarding against what they call
[49:56] emotionalism
[49:57] and it ends up in a place where only the
[50:00] pastor is spiritual it ends up in a
[50:02] place where only the pastor has a gift
[50:04] and life is robbed Joy is robbed freedom
[50:07] is robbed and brother Branham says and
[50:10] you were ridiculed and attacked for the
[50:12] Liberty that you have in Christ
[50:15] think about it
[50:17] he says see how the church began to get
[50:20] formal during that time they begin to
[50:22] kind of break down the people under the
[50:25] inspiration of the Holy Ghost now pay
[50:27] attention what he's saying here and
[50:29] think about this they begin to break
[50:31] down the people who were under the
[50:33] inspiration of the Holy Ghost and begin
[50:36] to cause people to kind of make fun of
[50:38] them
[50:40] when you find that it's someone under a
[50:43] nicolaitan spirit
[50:46] that would make fun of people under the
[50:48] inspiration of the Holy Ghost
[50:55] church we can't let that come in
[50:57] may it be that I'd even like Tabernacle
[51:00] that's never accepted
[51:02] that service is without the moving of
[51:04] the spirit of the spirit or something
[51:06] that we say no we will not have that but
[51:09] he'll always be welcome to move here how
[51:10] he sees fit break out on our services
[51:13] when he sees fit to pour the gifts out
[51:16] in people's lives and we will accept
[51:17] them now I may never once speak in
[51:20] tongues in my life and that's fine I
[51:21] know it has nothing to do with my
[51:22] salvation but I say Lord if you want me
[51:24] to I'm sure willing Lord if you want me
[51:27] to operate under a gift of the Holy
[51:28] Spirit I'm sure willing because I'm not
[51:30] going to reject and push aside the
[51:32] spirit of Christ in any way now look all
[51:35] of this goes that it doesn't mean that
[51:37] we don't believe in rulership and
[51:38] headship in a church
[51:42] but like the prophet said he said I
[51:44] believe that the church is to be ruled
[51:46] over by men that God sends to take
[51:49] charge but that rule is by the word and
[51:55] that is not men really ruling that's the
[51:58] spirit of God
[52:00] so it's not men ruling it's the spirit
[52:03] of God ruling but in order for that to
[52:05] happen you've got to have men that are
[52:06] surrendered to the spirit of God Amen
[52:11] rulership of man he says see what was
[52:13] happening back there that false fine was
[52:15] getting a hold and it was teaching that
[52:18] rulership by man was right it taught
[52:20] that the church had to be governed and
[52:24] he says the Ephesians hated that and any
[52:27] True Believer will hate it too
[52:31] Believers will hate when men quench the
[52:33] moving of the spirit
[52:35] Believers will hate cold and formal
[52:37] worship Believers we will hate when they
[52:40] see men trying to control the freedom of
[52:42] worship in a congregation
[52:44] brother Brown says they got the people
[52:46] to obey them until the time came that
[52:49] their way of worship and I want you to
[52:51] pay close attention well the way we
[52:53] worship doesn't really matter brother
[52:54] Aaron you know as long as the word
[52:56] listen to what brother Brown says he
[52:57] covers all this about the Nicolaitans he
[53:00] covers it all and then when he sums it
[53:02] up how's he sum it up
[53:04] they got the people to obey them until
[53:06] the time came that their way of worship
[53:09] did not in any way at all resemble the
[53:13] early days after Pentecost
[53:16] apparently the way we worship matters
[53:19] and it should resemble the way it was at
[53:22] Pentecost because he says what they did
[53:25] is they pulled them away from that
[53:27] worship
[53:28] it pulled them away from that passion
[53:31] and the moving of the spirit
[53:34] Paul here is speaking to the Elders of
[53:36] the Ephesian church because Paul being a
[53:39] prophet saw it coming
[53:40] he saw this coming and he says in Acts
[53:43] 20 and 27 for I have not shunned to
[53:46] declare unto you all the counsel of God
[53:48] take heed therefore unto yourselves and
[53:51] to all the flock over which the Holy
[53:53] Ghost hath made you overseers to feed
[53:55] the Church of God which he hath
[53:57] purchased with his own blood
[54:01] for I know this that after my departing
[54:04] shall Grievous wolves enter in among you
[54:06] not sparing the flock and brother Brown
[54:10] says here is Paul's wolves the Deeds of
[54:13] Nicolaitans
[54:15] when you operate under the spirit of
[54:18] nicolaitanism you are one of the Wolves
[54:20] Paul spoke of
[54:23] brother Brown says that's Paul's wolves
[54:25] the Deeds of the Nicolaitans
[54:28] and he says also of your own self shall
[54:32] men arise speaking perverse things to
[54:34] draw away disciples after them notice
[54:36] what makes it so dangerous
[54:39] because these wolves are
[54:41] of your own selves
[54:45] listen
[54:47] God bless every Church there is I wish
[54:50] there was more of them
[54:52] but y'all ain't being deceived by the
[54:54] nominational message
[54:57] what makes these wolves dangerous
[55:00] of your own selves shall men arise
[55:04] people that can talk the same talk you
[55:06] talk quote the same quote you quote
[55:10] believe the godhead the way you believe
[55:12] the godhead
[55:13] there's the wolves
[55:16] he says therefore watch
[55:18] and remember that by the space of three
[55:21] years I cease not to warn everyone night
[55:25] and day with tears
[55:29] brother Brown says he knew they would
[55:31] Implement a way of worship that excluded
[55:33] the people from any part in the Holy
[55:36] Spirit Ministry
[55:38] and even right today among those who
[55:40] claim to be free and full of the Holy
[55:42] Spirit there's not too much freedom in
[55:45] the laity
[55:46] wow
[55:49] he says in the best we can see is a few
[55:51] preachers with inspired preaching while
[55:54] the flock just sits there and tries to
[55:58] exorbit it
[55:59] listen Paul cried out against it and if
[56:02] he was here today he'd cry out against
[56:04] it again
[56:05] he would cry out just the same and he
[56:07] would say back to the leadership of the
[56:09] spirit back to Pentecost back to what
[56:12] the word actually teaches quit saying
[56:14] the word the word the word and actually
[56:16] do what the word teaches you to do the
[56:18] holy ghost in the ministry the holy
[56:21] ghost in the people the holy ghost in
[56:23] the worship the Holy Ghost dominating
[56:25] the whole camp
[56:27] not a man dominating
[56:30] the holy ghost manifested in a people
[56:32] doing the same things and acting the
[56:35] same way that it always acted
[56:40] what I want from evening like Tabernacle
[56:43] is that it be said of us just like God
[56:45] said of them they hate the Deeds of the
[56:49] Nicolaitans
[56:50] they hate that seed they they hate the
[56:53] way it manifests itself they hate the
[56:55] Deeds of the Nicolaitans
[57:00] we're going to move on now to verse 7.
[57:04] the voice of the spirit
[57:07] let me find some water real quick
[57:14] it says he that hath an ear let him hear
[57:16] what the spirit saith to the churches
[57:21] now we know
[57:23] because we're
[57:26] this is pretty simple to say but we know
[57:28] that this isn't talking physically
[57:30] because everybody in here has an ear
[57:33] everybody does
[57:35] but it's saying he who will lend his ear
[57:37] this is Brother Branham he who will lend
[57:39] his ear
[57:40] and want to know the words of truth will
[57:44] find the spirit of God enlightening him
[57:47] if your ear is open to the word not just
[57:50] saying I believe the word but it's
[57:51] actually open to it
[57:53] the spirit of God will make the word
[57:55] real to you now that is a work of the
[57:59] spirit now it's worth noting here that
[58:01] it says churches
[58:03] unto thee churches so it wasn't just
[58:06] talking to Ephesus
[58:07] it wasn't just a message to Ephesus here
[58:10] but it but it's a message to the first
[58:13] age but it's for each and every age each
[58:15] and every Church anybody down Through
[58:17] the Ages that has an ear let him hear
[58:20] what the spirit saith
[58:22] the rest of the verse says to him that
[58:25] overcometh will I give to eat of the
[58:29] tree of life which is in the midst of
[58:32] the paradise of God this is the promised
[58:34] reward
[58:36] brother Brown tells us that this is a
[58:38] future reward but it's for the
[58:40] Overcomers of each and every age if you
[58:43] overcome your reward is to eat of the
[58:47] Tree of Life
[58:48] the Overcomers from Ephesus all the way
[58:50] down to the Overcomers of laodicea your
[58:53] reward is that you will be able to eat
[58:55] from the Tree of Life Now notice and I
[58:59] want you to pay close attention as we go
[59:01] forward from here because I want you to
[59:02] be able to tie some things together in
[59:04] scripture yourself without me having to
[59:06] just explain it completely I think if
[59:08] you'll open your ear right now you'll
[59:10] recognize some of this notice the reward
[59:12] is to eat
[59:14] of the Tree of Life
[59:17] your reward will be will be eternal life
[59:20] but what I want you to notice is the
[59:21] language used it's the same language
[59:24] that Jesus would use that made everyone
[59:27] turn away from him
[59:29] think about it what was in John 6 53
[59:31] then Jesus said unto them verily verily
[59:34] I say unto you except you eat the Flesh
[59:36] of the son of man and drink his blood
[59:39] you have no life
[59:41] in you
[59:43] to eat
[59:44] from the Tree of Life and we'll come
[59:46] back to this and connect this as we go
[59:48] on the tree of life
[59:51] is mentioned six times in the scripture
[59:53] in this context three times in Genesis 2
[59:56] and 9 3 and 22 and 3 and 24 then also
[1:00:00] three times in the Book of Revelation in
[1:00:02] Chapter 2 and 7 22 and 2 and 22 and 14
[1:00:05] not going to go to each one of these
[1:00:06] places
[1:00:08] but the Tree of Life what is it or
[1:00:11] should I say who is it
[1:00:15] who is the Tree of Life in all six
[1:00:18] places the tree is symbolizing the exact
[1:00:20] same thing and that is the Lord Jesus
[1:00:23] Christ
[1:00:25] go ahead and get that right now the Lord
[1:00:27] Jesus Christ is the Tree of Life
[1:00:30] throughout the scriptures often what
[1:00:32] you'll find is that is that tree
[1:00:35] symbolize people
[1:00:37] it's just like that in Psalms one
[1:00:38] brother Joe read this Wednesday night it
[1:00:40] says blessed is the man that walketh not
[1:00:42] in the counts of the ungodly nor
[1:00:43] standeth in the way of Sinners nor
[1:00:45] sitteth in the seat of the scornful but
[1:00:47] his Delight is in the law of the Lord
[1:00:49] and in his law doth he meditate day and
[1:00:51] night and he shall be like a tree
[1:00:55] planted by the rivers of water that
[1:00:57] bringeth forth his fruit in this season
[1:01:00] so this person is like a tree and this
[1:01:03] person will bring forth
[1:01:05] fruit
[1:01:07] that bringeth forth fruit in his season
[1:01:09] his Leaf also shall not wither and
[1:01:11] whatsoever he doeth shall prosper and
[1:01:14] like I said what we see here and as we
[1:01:16] see in other places in the scripture is
[1:01:17] trees referring to people
[1:01:20] and if there was a tree that was the
[1:01:22] tree of life then that tree had to be
[1:01:25] Jesus because he alone is the source of
[1:01:28] life
[1:01:30] he alone is the source of life so you
[1:01:32] can't have Jesus as the source of life
[1:01:34] and then there's this mystical tree that
[1:01:36] also is the source of life
[1:01:39] it's not two different things
[1:01:42] we're going to do that what we're going
[1:01:43] to do here is look at quite a few
[1:01:45] scriptures
[1:01:47] just to establish that there is no other
[1:01:50] source of eternal life outside of Jesus
[1:01:53] all right further showing you what am I
[1:01:55] trying to do I'm showing you that the
[1:01:57] tree of life was Jesus okay so first
[1:02:00] John 5 11 and this is the record that
[1:02:04] God hath given to us eternal life and
[1:02:06] this life is in his son
[1:02:10] it could just have easily said and this
[1:02:13] life is in the tree of life it would
[1:02:14] have been the same thing
[1:02:16] but it's in his son verse 12 he that
[1:02:19] hath the son hath
[1:02:20] life
[1:02:22] so who is the Tree of Life
[1:02:24] Jesus all right we're going to keep
[1:02:26] going with this
[1:02:28] now look John 6 31 our fathers did eat
[1:02:32] Manna in the desert at his as it is
[1:02:34] written he gave them bread from Heaven
[1:02:36] to eat then Jesus said unto them verily
[1:02:38] verily I say unto you Moses gave you not
[1:02:41] that bread from heaven but my father
[1:02:43] giveth you the true bread from heaven
[1:02:45] for the bread of God is he which cometh
[1:02:48] down from heaven and giveth life unto
[1:02:52] the world then said they unto him Lord
[1:02:55] Evermore give us this bread
[1:02:57] and Jesus said unto them I am the bread
[1:03:01] of life the same way that he's a loaf of
[1:03:04] bread
[1:03:06] he's the tree
[1:03:09] you follow
[1:03:10] so he is the the bread of life he is the
[1:03:12] Tree of Life
[1:03:13] moving on
[1:03:15] John 6 47 barely verily I say unto you
[1:03:18] he that believeth on me hath everlasting
[1:03:21] life I am that bread of life
[1:03:25] I am the living bread which came down
[1:03:27] from heaven If any man eat of this bread
[1:03:29] he shall live forever and the bread that
[1:03:31] I will give is my flesh which I will
[1:03:34] give for the life of the world
[1:03:37] it says whoso eadeth my flesh and
[1:03:40] drinketh my blood hath eternal life and
[1:03:44] I will raise him up at the last day for
[1:03:47] my flesh is meet indeed and my blood is
[1:03:52] drink
[1:03:52] indeed now notice not only does this
[1:03:56] establish that Jesus is the source of
[1:03:58] life I want you to pay attention because
[1:04:00] it also hearkens to the symbolism of
[1:04:03] eating
[1:04:06] in order to have life you must eat
[1:04:09] you must partake of what Jesus is
[1:04:12] offering you
[1:04:13] you must partake of the fruit of the
[1:04:16] Tree of Life what Jesus is trying to
[1:04:18] give you that is the fruit that was on
[1:04:20] the tree of life
[1:04:22] and so if it's if it's hearkening back
[1:04:24] to to the symbolism of eating it doesn't
[1:04:26] take a big leap to recognize that this
[1:04:30] is the exact same type of type of
[1:04:31] language being used in Genesis when it
[1:04:34] speaks of eating in the garden
[1:04:38] Genesis 2 17 but of the tree of
[1:04:40] knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt
[1:04:42] not eat of it for in the day that thou
[1:04:45] eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die
[1:04:47] and just as We Know
[1:04:49] I believe we know and if not hopefully
[1:04:51] we will in a minute that you didn't
[1:04:53] literally eat Jesus
[1:04:57] we also know that they didn't literally
[1:04:59] eat fruit in the garden from a literal
[1:05:02] tree to cause the fall
[1:05:05] otherwise if that was the case then
[1:05:07] you'd have to literally do what Jesus
[1:05:09] was telling you to do there
[1:05:14] nah
[1:05:16] but they reckon they thought it was
[1:05:17] crazy because they didn't understand
[1:05:18] that and they said this man's
[1:05:20] accountable
[1:05:23] they walked away there's no there's not
[1:05:26] enough of him
[1:05:29] how could we all do this
[1:05:33] but just says that we know that they
[1:05:34] didn't mean literally eat him they
[1:05:36] didn't literally eat this fruit it's
[1:05:38] interesting to me that when when people
[1:05:40] read this account of Jesus saying Eat My
[1:05:43] Flesh and drink my blood they
[1:05:45] immediately understand that he didn't
[1:05:46] mean it literally
[1:05:48] but when you apply that to to Genesis
[1:05:51] they can in no way fathom or apply that
[1:05:53] to that language in the garden
[1:05:55] they can read that every time goes well
[1:05:57] that's not really what it meant you know
[1:05:58] it was a symbolism and then but then you
[1:05:59] try to explain that in the guard and
[1:06:01] they're like
[1:06:03] really
[1:06:05] how big a leap is that
[1:06:07] it's the exact same language with the
[1:06:08] exact same symbolism
[1:06:12] he says this is that bread which came
[1:06:14] down from heaven not as your fathers did
[1:06:17] eat Manna and are dead he that eateth
[1:06:19] this bread shall live forever
[1:06:23] so Jesus makes it very clear in John
[1:06:25] chapter 6 through 8 that he is the only
[1:06:28] source of eternal life he is the bread
[1:06:31] of life in chapter 7 he declares that
[1:06:33] he's the source of rivers of Living
[1:06:35] Water in chapter 8 he declares that
[1:06:37] before Abraham was I am so if he is the
[1:06:40] source of life if he's the bread of life
[1:06:42] if he's the rivers of life and if like
[1:06:45] Peter declared he was the only one with
[1:06:46] the words of life then Jesus is the Tree
[1:06:50] of Life
[1:06:51] amen
[1:06:53] so
[1:06:54] brother Branham says now since the
[1:06:56] record cannot change be taken from or
[1:06:59] added there unto then the record stands
[1:07:02] that the life is in the Sun
[1:07:05] since this is so the tree in the garden
[1:07:08] has to be
[1:07:11] Jesus
[1:07:13] now that's going to take us to our next
[1:07:15] little leap here
[1:07:18] brother Branham says all right
[1:07:20] if the tree of life is a person
[1:07:23] then the tree of knowledge of Good and
[1:07:25] Evil is a person also
[1:07:28] it can't be otherwise it wouldn't be
[1:07:31] symbolism and Jesus is it's really Jesus
[1:07:35] and then the other is a tree
[1:07:37] if one is Jesus then the other has to be
[1:07:39] a person also
[1:07:41] we spoke about the two Vines we've
[1:07:43] talked about the true and the false and
[1:07:44] what we're fixing to find out is the
[1:07:45] source of those Vines why is there a
[1:07:48] false fine
[1:07:49] why was the evil one able to to spread
[1:07:52] seed Amongst the Wheat where did the
[1:07:54] tares come from
[1:07:55] you know many believe that the two trees
[1:07:57] in the garden were just trees
[1:07:59] but we've already established that the
[1:08:02] only source of life was Jesus and that
[1:08:04] only in eating that tree or partaking of
[1:08:07] him can one live and so if the tree of
[1:08:10] life is a person then so it is the tree
[1:08:12] of knowledge of Good and Evil is equal
[1:08:15] speaks when he's speaking of Satan he
[1:08:17] specifically says thou has been in Eden
[1:08:22] The Garden of God
[1:08:24] so we know that he was there as equal
[1:08:26] points that out and makes it clear
[1:08:29] so we're going to delve into this just
[1:08:30] for a second the truth
[1:08:32] of the garden
[1:08:35] we know that the sin in the garden
[1:08:37] wasn't literally eating a fruit
[1:08:40] but it was a sexual act that occurred
[1:08:42] when the serpent beguiled Eve
[1:08:45] Genesis 3 1 says now the serpent was
[1:08:48] more subtle than any beast of the field
[1:08:51] which the Lord God had made
[1:08:55] now
[1:08:57] I want you to pay close attention
[1:08:58] and don't get it in your head like many
[1:09:01] do that the serpent was a snake but
[1:09:04] brother Aaron you have a snake up there
[1:09:06] yes post curse
[1:09:11] because we're going to look down at
[1:09:13] verse 14. if you think the serpent was a
[1:09:15] snake pay close attention to this
[1:09:18] and the Lord God said unto the serpent
[1:09:20] because thou Hast
[1:09:25] the east of the field upon thy belly
[1:09:28] shout thou go and thus shalt thou eat
[1:09:32] all the days of thy life now I'm not
[1:09:36] trying to be jokey but can you imagine
[1:09:38] if the serpent was already a snake
[1:09:41] and in all of God's infinite wisdom the
[1:09:44] best curse he could come up with is that
[1:09:46] you're going to keep being a snake
[1:09:50] I can just see this everyone you got me
[1:09:55] wow
[1:09:57] no he completely changed him upon thou
[1:10:00] Valley shout thou go
[1:10:02] this was the greatest curse that God
[1:10:05] could put upon him he wasn't going to
[1:10:06] curse him to continue being what he
[1:10:08] already was
[1:10:10] he took him from an upright creature
[1:10:13] that obviously could talk think about
[1:10:15] this and this is just me rambling
[1:10:17] forgive me for a minute
[1:10:19] but if I wanted to
[1:10:23] deceive you
[1:10:26] do you think that my best course of
[1:10:28] action would be to send an animal to you
[1:10:30] that you know cannot talk and have it
[1:10:31] begin talking to you
[1:10:34] yeah what's the first thing you think
[1:10:35] Eve would have done when that snake was
[1:10:37] like
[1:10:41] what's up
[1:10:48] let me think about it I mean I mean
[1:10:50] really
[1:10:52] I'm
[1:10:53] that's not the sense that it's not going
[1:10:55] to work
[1:10:57] he chose something that could reason
[1:11:00] that could walk that could talk as a
[1:11:03] matter of fact some before you get into
[1:11:05] your head like you know this is so crazy
[1:11:08] you know it was this ugly beast yes it
[1:11:11] could walk and it could talk but it was
[1:11:12] a beast like an ape I don't know brother
[1:11:15] Branham said he was beautiful
[1:11:19] as a matter of fact I have the quote
[1:11:21] here
[1:11:29] she saw the serpent he was beautiful
[1:11:32] handsome far better than her own husband
[1:11:38] he was the most subtle of all the beasts
[1:11:40] of the field and he was probably a
[1:11:43] fairer man
[1:11:45] than her husband
[1:11:47] so close to human and yet not you
[1:11:50] wouldn't have been able to tell
[1:11:52] you'd have thought
[1:11:54] and I know I'm talking to young people
[1:11:57] so I'm just gonna
[1:11:59] say it you'd have thought that dude
[1:12:02] right there looks better than Adam
[1:12:04] that's a better looking man you wouldn't
[1:12:07] have thought
[1:12:08] that's a good looking animal
[1:12:12] that there is a good looking Beast no he
[1:12:17] was attractive
[1:12:18] he looked like a man brother Brown said
[1:12:21] looking better
[1:12:22] than Adam
[1:12:24] so close to human and yet not
[1:12:27] beautiful muscular subtle seductive wise
[1:12:33] and cunning
[1:12:35] the scripture says in verse 13 and the
[1:12:37] Lord God said unto the woman what is
[1:12:40] this thou Hast done and the woman said
[1:12:43] the serpent beguiled me and I did eat
[1:12:46] now we're not going to break out the
[1:12:48] Webster's Dictionary and break it all
[1:12:49] down but beguiled means seduced
[1:12:53] she was seduced
[1:12:55] brother Brown said that's one of the
[1:12:56] mysteries of God that has remained
[1:12:57] hidden but here it is revealed it
[1:13:00] happened right back there in the midst
[1:13:02] of Eden when Eve turned away from life
[1:13:04] to accept death
[1:13:07] and through this act Satan is able to
[1:13:09] introduce himself and his
[1:13:11] characteristics into the human race
[1:13:15] brother Brandon says now why did this
[1:13:17] have to be
[1:13:18] why was it that the seed of the serpent
[1:13:20] must come this way Man was created for
[1:13:23] God man was to be the temple of God the
[1:13:26] place of God's rest was man the temple
[1:13:30] Satan knew this all along and he also
[1:13:34] wanted to indwell man even as God does
[1:13:36] but God had reserved to himself that
[1:13:39] right Satan cannot do that God Alone
[1:13:41] appeared in human flesh Satan could not
[1:13:44] and cannot do that he does not have
[1:13:47] creative Powers the only way for Satan
[1:13:51] to accomplish what he wanted to do was
[1:13:54] to enter the serpent
[1:13:56] in Eden
[1:14:02] Genesis 3 15. now what I'm going to do
[1:14:04] there's quite a few scriptures here they
[1:14:06] don't go together
[1:14:07] is I want to scripturally back up what
[1:14:09] I've just explained to you just so it
[1:14:10] just isn't I want to show you in the
[1:14:12] scriptures
[1:14:14] just to back this up because people want
[1:14:16] to argue the doctrine of the serpent
[1:14:18] seed but this scripturally here tells us
[1:14:21] without debate that the serpent had a
[1:14:24] seed verse 15 I will put enmity between
[1:14:27] thee and the woman and between thy seed
[1:14:29] and her seed
[1:14:31] between thy say he's talking to the
[1:14:33] serpent
[1:14:36] so I don't care if you ever end up in a
[1:14:39] discussion about it you might not can
[1:14:40] explain it all out and show every
[1:14:42] scripture there is because there's a lot
[1:14:43] of them but you can go to Genesis 3 15
[1:14:45] and say all I know is the scripture says
[1:14:47] the serpent had a seed
[1:14:50] and it says it shall bruise thy head
[1:14:53] he's talking about the woman's seed
[1:14:54] which everyone knows is Christ
[1:14:56] and thou shalt bruise his heel which
[1:14:59] means the Flesh of Christ where he
[1:15:01] touches the earth now you tell me I'm
[1:15:04] not sure but there at Calvary was he
[1:15:06] crucified by a bunch of snakes
[1:15:12] he was crucified by men
[1:15:15] the tares
[1:15:19] the tares that were planted Amongst the
[1:15:21] Wheat
[1:15:24] he says
[1:15:26] the certain the certain when the word
[1:15:28] seed here means lineage of people
[1:15:32] so between thy lineage is what he's
[1:15:35] saying to the serpent
[1:15:37] that lineage and the woman's lineage
[1:15:39] it'll bruise the hill of the seed of the
[1:15:42] woman which which we know was Christ I
[1:15:44] want to look at First John 3 12.
[1:15:46] not as Cain who was of that Wicked one
[1:15:52] and slew his brother and wherefore slew
[1:15:54] he him because his own Works were evil
[1:15:57] and his brothers
[1:15:59] righteous now it says here that Cain was
[1:16:02] of who
[1:16:04] Wicked one
[1:16:06] was Adam Wicked
[1:16:09] oh the scripture actually talks about
[1:16:11] him as the son of God
[1:16:12] never declares him as wicked so Cain was
[1:16:15] not of Adam
[1:16:17] says Cain turned out in the character
[1:16:20] like his father a bringer of death a
[1:16:24] murder where did that nature in Cain
[1:16:27] come from
[1:16:28] one who hated the word of God one that
[1:16:31] was full of bitterness and jealousy and
[1:16:33] anger enough to murder
[1:16:37] where did that come from
[1:16:39] his father
[1:16:41] Matthew 12 33
[1:16:44] it says either make the tree good and
[1:16:48] his fruit good we're back to that again
[1:16:51] or else make the tree corrupt and his
[1:16:53] fruit corrupt for the tree is known by
[1:16:56] his fruit o Generation of Vipers
[1:17:01] how can ye being evil speak good
[1:17:06] this is Jesus talking to the Pharisees I
[1:17:07] want to show you some more
[1:17:11] John 8 39.
[1:17:14] this one here I I love how this lays it
[1:17:17] out it says they answered him and said
[1:17:18] unto him Abraham is our father
[1:17:21] Jesus said on them if you were Abraham's
[1:17:23] children you would do the works of
[1:17:25] Abraham
[1:17:26] so he's ultimate Jesus is questioning
[1:17:28] their lineage
[1:17:30] he's saying you didn't come through the
[1:17:32] seed line you think you did
[1:17:35] but now you seek to kill me a man that I
[1:17:38] told you the truth which I've heard of
[1:17:40] God this did not
[1:17:43] Abraham ye do the Deeds of your father
[1:17:49] now notice here they catch the reference
[1:17:52] they know exactly what he's talking
[1:17:54] about
[1:17:56] they catch the reference and they know
[1:17:57] he's pointing back to the garden and
[1:17:59] saying you are on that act
[1:18:02] took place in the
[1:18:05] their response then they said unto him
[1:18:08] we be not born of fornication
[1:18:12] we're not born of that act in the garden
[1:18:16] you can't put that on us we have one
[1:18:19] father even God
[1:18:21] and Jesus said unto them if God were
[1:18:23] your father you would love me for I
[1:18:26] proceeded forth and came from God and
[1:18:27] neither came I of myself but he sent me
[1:18:29] why do you not understand my speech even
[1:18:32] because you cannot hear my word ye are
[1:18:36] of your father the devil
[1:18:39] and the lust of your father you will do
[1:18:42] now look another reference even to Cain
[1:18:44] he was a murderer
[1:18:47] from the beginning and Abode not in
[1:18:50] truth
[1:18:52] you are of your father the devil
[1:18:56] and so from this you find two lines of
[1:18:58] man
[1:19:00] brother Brown says of course students
[1:19:01] for a long time have set forth two lines
[1:19:03] of men one of which was The Godly line
[1:19:05] found in Seth and the other the ungodly
[1:19:08] line as founded by Cain and it is
[1:19:11] strange but true these same students
[1:19:13] have never told us how it was that Cain
[1:19:16] was the kind of person he was while Abel
[1:19:20] and Seth were of the spiritual and godly
[1:19:23] line
[1:19:24] how were Abel and Seth God-fearing
[1:19:27] spiritual men and yet Cain was so
[1:19:29] different
[1:19:30] so full of hatred wickedness and
[1:19:32] violence
[1:19:34] one tree of life is Jesus
[1:19:37] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[1:19:40] Satan and what did that tree of
[1:19:43] knowledge of Good and Evil produce It
[1:19:45] produced exactly what God told them it
[1:19:47] would produce
[1:19:49] and it manifested itself in Cain and
[1:19:52] immediately produced
[1:19:53] death not only death to the human race
[1:19:56] but there was an immediate manifestation
[1:19:59] It produced death and came because Cain
[1:20:03] was of that Wicked one
[1:20:06] looking at the two lines the tree of
[1:20:08] knowledge
[1:20:10] produced people that were clever
[1:20:12] smart
[1:20:13] lots of Commerce invention
[1:20:15] but then we know and brother Brown talks
[1:20:17] about it with all the things that come
[1:20:19] off the tree of knowledge of Good and
[1:20:21] Evil everything it produces that's good
[1:20:23] also has evil
[1:20:25] look at the inventions gunpowder think
[1:20:28] of the death brought about by that
[1:20:29] invention
[1:20:31] bombs cars we love cars we all
[1:20:35] in some ways partake of the tree of
[1:20:37] knowledge of Good and Evil how many of
[1:20:39] y'all
[1:20:39] even I didn't walk here how many of
[1:20:41] y'all walked here
[1:20:43] no you came in a car
[1:20:45] but do you know how many people die
[1:20:47] every year in a car
[1:20:49] oh it's it's a tree of knowledge of good
[1:20:53] and evil medicine's a wonderful thing
[1:20:57] but do you ever read the side effects on
[1:20:59] some medicines
[1:21:01] it's good
[1:21:03] and it's evil
[1:21:05] so with everything that comes off that
[1:21:07] tree you have good and you have evil
[1:21:09] brother Branham tells us though that the
[1:21:11] people in this lineage the false fine
[1:21:15] those that come down like that are very
[1:21:17] very religious
[1:21:20] now pay attention as we bring this and
[1:21:22] begin to wrap this up
[1:21:23] he says they are very religious they
[1:21:26] believe in God they are like their
[1:21:28] father the devil and their ancestor Cain
[1:21:30] because both of them believed in God
[1:21:34] they go to church they mingle with the
[1:21:36] righteous as do tears mingle with the
[1:21:40] wheat
[1:21:41] very religious
[1:21:44] and this is where we're going to Loop it
[1:21:45] back around to nicolaitanism
[1:21:47] because that's where we came from where
[1:21:49] did that false find come from that that
[1:21:51] began to Institute this nicolaitanism
[1:21:54] because from them the false Vine we see
[1:21:57] the nicolaitan religion come forth
[1:22:00] you have the True Vine and the false
[1:22:02] Vine and the false Vine is always
[1:22:04] spreading poison always spreading
[1:22:06] negativity listen here's the deal
[1:22:10] if all you have to Rally people around
[1:22:13] is negativity
[1:22:16] and in our churches in the message it
[1:22:19] shouldn't be about what everybody else
[1:22:21] has wrong
[1:22:24] because when you have something worth
[1:22:26] presenting
[1:22:27] I can just present it
[1:22:30] I don't got to make it look better by by
[1:22:32] showing you all the faults in everybody
[1:22:34] else
[1:22:35] and if all you have to Rally people
[1:22:37] around is negative stories and
[1:22:39] accusations you can trace that right
[1:22:42] back into the heavens
[1:22:46] where Lucifer rallied people with his
[1:22:48] complaints
[1:22:50] and always remember this just because
[1:22:52] people agree with you doesn't make you
[1:22:55] right
[1:22:57] because there was a whole lot of angels
[1:22:59] who agreed with the Devil
[1:23:01] that always you know kind of makes me
[1:23:03] smile when people are throwing their
[1:23:05] complaints out and they name drop and so
[1:23:07] and so agrees with me too
[1:23:10] man
[1:23:12] what why does that matter
[1:23:14] if you're Gathering people or you're
[1:23:16] using negativity for your ministry
[1:23:19] that's not the ministry of the True Vine
[1:23:22] they're always spreading negativity
[1:23:23] under the guise of religion and
[1:23:25] spirituality to destroy the true seed of
[1:23:28] God just as Cain killed Abel
[1:23:32] it tells us to him that overcometh will
[1:23:35] I give to eat of the tree of life which
[1:23:37] is in the midst of the paradise of God
[1:23:42] man had fallen and sin nature had
[1:23:45] entered into the human race
[1:23:47] and God couldn't have man living
[1:23:50] eternally in a sinful condition
[1:23:53] and so the way to eternal life was
[1:23:55] blocked and guarded
[1:23:57] brother Brown it says he says right here
[1:23:59] was guarded by a cherubim with the
[1:24:01] Flaming sword due to the fall
[1:24:04] but but now because the seed of the
[1:24:06] woman that that is promised there in the
[1:24:09] garden has actually come forth and has
[1:24:11] come down through time and has crushed
[1:24:13] the head of the seat of the serpent at
[1:24:15] Calvary there is now a way made to once
[1:24:18] again partake of the Tree of Life
[1:24:21] brother Brown says what a thrilling
[1:24:23] thought it is that tree of life in the
[1:24:25] Garden of Eden which could not be
[1:24:27] approached because of the fall of Adam
[1:24:30] is now given to the Overcomer the
[1:24:33] Flaming sword of the Guardian cherubim
[1:24:36] has now been sheathed and the angel that
[1:24:40] once guarded the way and and wouldn't
[1:24:42] let you back into the garden and
[1:24:44] wouldn't let people get to the tree
[1:24:45] brother Brown says that same Angel is
[1:24:48] now pushing people saying get back to
[1:24:50] the Tree of Life get back to eternal
[1:24:52] life go partake of Jesus go get all you
[1:24:55] can it's a free Fountain and it's
[1:24:57] flowing and there's access made to it
[1:24:59] you once couldn't go but he's saying now
[1:25:01] you can go because it was a perfect
[1:25:03] sacrifice it was a perfect lamb and now
[1:25:06] every Overcomer from every age is given
[1:25:09] this as a reward
[1:25:11] eternal life and constant fellowship
[1:25:14] with Jesus Christ
[1:25:18] brother Brown says get back to God
[1:25:20] repent before it is too late see the
[1:25:23] handwriting on the wall it is writing
[1:25:25] judgment as the sacred vessels were
[1:25:27] desecrated and thus brought the wrath of
[1:25:29] God now the sacred word has been
[1:25:31] desecrated and the spirit grieved and
[1:25:34] judgment is here and even at the door
[1:25:36] repent repent go back to Pentecost back
[1:25:40] to the leadership of the Holy Ghost back
[1:25:42] to the word of God for why will ye die
[1:25:47] look at this for just a minute
[1:25:50] that subtle spirit will come in and
[1:25:51] quote quotes
[1:25:53] it'll twist it this way and that
[1:25:55] anything
[1:25:57] to keep the people living in the same
[1:26:00] birth of the sin of the garden
[1:26:05] see it's always been about birth
[1:26:08] that's what it was about with Cain
[1:26:10] it was about birth
[1:26:12] that's what it was about all the way up
[1:26:14] to Jesus and his virgin birth it's about
[1:26:16] birth
[1:26:17] and even today that Spirit questions the
[1:26:20] new birth
[1:26:21] because that Spirit doesn't have a
[1:26:23] problem with the first birth because
[1:26:25] that's where its roots are found
[1:26:29] of course they don't think you have to
[1:26:30] be born again they're okay with the
[1:26:32] birth that their roots are found in
[1:26:35] their roots are found at the sin of the
[1:26:37] garden so they don't need a new birth
[1:26:39] they're okay with the birth
[1:26:41] that was there at the beginning
[1:26:43] but today
[1:26:45] there's been a restoration today there's
[1:26:48] a voice that cries out to the elect of
[1:26:49] God and it says You must be Born Again
[1:26:53] Church I'm not okay with my first birth
[1:26:56] and you can't be okay I don't care how
[1:26:58] good you are how bad you are no matter
[1:27:01] where you're at on that Spectrum you
[1:27:03] must be born again why was that Jesus's
[1:27:05] very first Doctrine because something
[1:27:07] was wrong with our first birth you must
[1:27:10] have a new birth you must be born by the
[1:27:13] spirit of God and why is that even
[1:27:15] possible because he came and took and
[1:27:17] came through a virgin birth so the curse
[1:27:19] of sin had no claim on his flesh and so
[1:27:22] now you must be born again I don't want
[1:27:25] my roots found in the act in the garden
[1:27:28] I don't want my flesh to be what
[1:27:30] controls me I want to lay this down and
[1:27:32] I don't want to have any tie to the
[1:27:33] center of the garden I only want my
[1:27:35] birth to be tied back to Calvary tied
[1:27:37] back to Pentecost tied back to the upper
[1:27:40] room I say yes Lord I want the new birth
[1:27:42] give me the new birth change me change
[1:27:45] my flesh change my spirit change
[1:27:47] everything about me because my roots are
[1:27:50] Eternal my roots are in heaven they're
[1:27:52] not found in the fall they're in the
[1:27:54] Garden of Eden
[1:27:56] Hallelujah you must return to Pentecost
[1:28:00] you must have the Holy Ghost
[1:28:03] and if you don't
[1:28:06] why will you die he's saying why won't
[1:28:09] you go back you know this is death why
[1:28:11] I'm not just return to Pentecost
[1:28:14] why will you die
[1:28:17] because you're too prideful
[1:28:19] because you don't want to accept it
[1:28:20] because you don't want to change your
[1:28:22] ways because you're stuck in Traditions
[1:28:25] he says You must have the Holy Ghost and
[1:28:28] if you do not
[1:28:30] you will die
[1:28:32] then I ask you this question
[1:28:35] let's go all the way back to the garden
[1:28:37] where it said if you do this you'll die
[1:28:42] and now we see if you don't go back to
[1:28:44] Pentecost you'll die
[1:28:46] then you tell me
[1:28:48] what type of voice it is that would
[1:28:50] contrast that and say
[1:28:52] you don't have to go back to Pentecost
[1:28:56] you won't die
[1:29:00] it's the voice of the serpent
[1:29:04] that would tell you shortly
[1:29:08] surely
[1:29:09] you won't die
[1:29:11] just believe
[1:29:13] there's a True Vine
[1:29:15] and there's a false fine
[1:29:17] and since the fall
[1:29:21] they've been worn at one another and all
[1:29:24] the way to the end
[1:29:26] they will be at War
[1:29:29] Return To Life
[1:29:31] brother Brown says how tragic it is that
[1:29:33] this first age did not listen to the
[1:29:35] spirit instead it listened to man
[1:29:39] but thank God in the last age there will
[1:29:42] be a group rise up the true Bride of the
[1:29:45] last day and she will listen to the
[1:29:48] spirit now listen I'm just going to put
[1:29:50] it out there it's going to tell you what
[1:29:52] the true bride is going to do
[1:29:55] it says in that day of gross Darkness
[1:29:58] the light will return by the pure word
[1:30:00] and we will return to the power of
[1:30:04] Pentecost to welcome back the Lord Jesus
[1:30:08] Christ
[1:30:09] they go together if you're not returning
[1:30:11] back to Pentecost you're not welcoming
[1:30:13] back the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:30:16] brother Aaron these are your opinions
[1:30:19] these are taken straight out of the
[1:30:22] message
[1:30:24] this is the word of the Lord for this
[1:30:27] day
[1:30:30] the false Vine got in and introduced the
[1:30:32] leadership of man
[1:30:33] subtle at first just like the serpent
[1:30:36] Rob the power robbed the life
[1:30:39] made it seem so good and seemed so
[1:30:41] reasonable
[1:30:42] but the elect will not be deceived
[1:30:45] the elect will know the truth
[1:30:48] they will return to the power of the new
[1:30:50] birth which breaks the curse of sin
[1:30:54] as we wrap up the Ephesian Church age
[1:30:57] I just want to tell you return to
[1:30:59] Pentecost
[1:31:01] return to the new birth
[1:31:03] leave the old birth behind
[1:31:06] forget it all
[1:31:08] and come to the Fountain of Life the
[1:31:10] power of the new birth amen let's bow
[1:31:13] our heads together
[1:31:15] Heavenly Father we thank you so much for
[1:31:17] the truth that we see in your word Lord
[1:31:19] Lord we thank you how plain and how
[1:31:21] obvious you've made it Lord Lord but
[1:31:23] even I stand in here saying that
[1:31:25] recognize that it's plain and obvious
[1:31:26] because we had a Prophet come and make
[1:31:28] it that way to us thank you for that
[1:31:30] Lord thank you for the revealed word
[1:31:31] Lord thank you that the elect will not
[1:31:34] be deceived and Lord when we see people
[1:31:36] maybe that are straying or people that
[1:31:38] that don't see it exactly the same
[1:31:40] that's not that we're calling them
[1:31:41] anything Lord Lord I know if they're
[1:31:43] your elect you'll get a hold of them and
[1:31:45] Lord they'll be there and Lord that's
[1:31:46] that's my desire Lord I just want to see
[1:31:49] people saved Lord I just want to see
[1:31:51] people make it but Lord the more I study
[1:31:54] this message the more I realize the way
[1:31:55] that's got to happen is by the new birth
[1:31:58] and the way that's got to happen is by
[1:32:00] returning to Pentecost Lord the very
[1:32:02] thing the message came for to turn us
[1:32:04] back to the father faith of the fathers
[1:32:06] Lord may we be a people that are willing
[1:32:08] to contend
[1:32:09] may we be a people that won't give up
[1:32:11] our rights and lay down no matter who
[1:32:13] comes and says it makes fun and calls us
[1:32:16] fanatic maybe comes and says we don't
[1:32:18] need that anymore Lord we can go back to
[1:32:20] the word we can go back to the message
[1:32:23] and read where the messenger said the
[1:32:25] true bride will return to the power of
[1:32:28] Pentecost to welcome back the Lord Jesus
[1:32:31] Christ
[1:32:32] Lord I ask Lord right now with this
[1:32:34] young people before me with their heads
[1:32:35] bowed at their be any that have left
[1:32:37] their first love
[1:32:39] Lord if there be any that have fallen
[1:32:41] back lord away from that point I'm not
[1:32:42] saying they've gone out into the world
[1:32:44] or or just given up but if they've slid
[1:32:47] back
[1:32:48] from that place that passion that real
[1:32:51] zeal
[1:32:52] Lord may they find a place of repentance
[1:32:55] and Lord may they come back to that
[1:32:56] place and even go beyond it go further
[1:32:58] press deeper call out for more
[1:33:01] Lord I pray tonight that the words we've
[1:33:04] spoken Lord will find a resting place
[1:33:06] though we commit these people these
[1:33:07] young people and each one that's
[1:33:09] gathered into your hands lord they're
[1:33:10] your people
[1:33:11] though they're not for me or any other
[1:33:13] man to rule over they're to be ruled by
[1:33:15] the Holy Spirit Lord I pray that each
[1:33:17] one of them will know you and come Lord
[1:33:20] God to that experience of the upper room

[1:33:24] them in this time into your hands
