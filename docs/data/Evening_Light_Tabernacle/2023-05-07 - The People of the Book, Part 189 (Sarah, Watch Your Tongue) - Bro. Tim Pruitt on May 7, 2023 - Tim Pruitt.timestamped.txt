[55:17] today and be in his presence and I just
[55:21] want to say we love the Lord today and
[55:24] thankful for each one of you that are
[55:26] here with us and last night I had a
[55:29] little special treat I spoke to the
[55:32] Church of the Rising Sun in Japan in
[55:35] their morning service it was last night
[55:38] for me but morning for them and their
[55:40] lovely group and I wonder if we have
[55:43] that picture there that they have now
[55:46] rented a place that they have us that is
[55:50] set aside for worship and we continue to
[55:52] support the work in Japan and and some
[55:55] of the translation works that has went
[55:59] on there for some time and I think we
[56:01] got like 300 we went from zero to 347
[56:06] sermons of brother branham's in the in
[56:09] the language of Japan so that the
[56:11] message can go to them and and can deal
[56:14] with hearts and lives we thank the Lord
[56:17] for that amen
[56:21] so we are we appreciate
[56:24] um those that have went and uh carried
[56:27] the word and the burden of the word and
[56:29] helped out in that in that and see that
[56:32] we have a part invested in this an
[56:35] extension of us even in light Tabernacle
[56:38] that are there on the other side of the
[56:40] globe and they are they're
[56:43] um doing everything they can to get in
[56:45] step with the gospel of Christ and
[56:47] brother
[56:48] um brother fedemar uh he's a Filipino
[56:51] from the Philippines but he resides
[56:54] there in Japan and he has taken on the
[56:56] Pastoral ship there and as you can see
[56:59] it's kind of a multinational group I
[57:01] think they have Portuguese and African
[57:03] and as well as Japanese and Chinese and
[57:06] so but you know that's the way it is God
[57:08] has um no barriers as far as One race
[57:12] there's one race and that's the god race
[57:14] amen and that's what we want to face
[57:17] upon is um the god race that's what we
[57:20] focus on now the Bible said for these
[57:23] truths that we have to to commit them to
[57:27] Faithful Men And The Gospel that God has
[57:30] given us God has uh also raised up
[57:33] Faithful Men that surround the ministry
[57:36] that help us and I don't know if you
[57:38] noticed it or not but some of you that
[57:40] sit in the mezzanine on that front row
[57:43] seat there you know it was really Jam
[57:45] close and and we had already tried to do
[57:49] something to make it comfortable but I
[57:52] want to thank brother Jim Morgan for his
[57:53] skills and expertise and reworking that
[57:56] for more a foot and leg room it just
[57:59] turned out so beautiful I'm so proud of
[58:01] it thank you brother Jimbo God bless you
[58:04] also the Baxters and the Mitchells have
[58:06] made some beautiful trolleys to store
[58:09] and transport to chairs in the
[58:11] fellowship hall and uh they're just
[58:13] beautiful with the most awesome
[58:16] craftsmanship and to know we got welders
[58:20] like brother Mark brother Jonathan
[58:22] Mitchell and and uh and these these
[58:25] families are just always giving and what
[58:27] a blessing they are to the body of
[58:29] Christ so I want to say thank you from
[58:31] the depths of my heart not only that but
[58:34] every one of you that do a part here
[58:37] whether you're an unseen person up in
[58:39] the mezzanine and on our I mean and the
[58:43] the audio Booth or the video Booth you
[58:46] know without you well we couldn't
[58:47] there's a lot we could not do and so we
[58:50] want to thank you and there's no one
[58:51] there's no one great among us but the
[58:54] Lord Jesus amen and so we love him with
[58:58] all our hearts so will you turn with me
[58:59] to Genesis Chapter 18 and verse 9 for
[59:03] our scripture reading this morning and
[59:06] and praying that God will bless you in a
[59:09] mighty way today and that he will anoint
[59:12] his word to us I see there's some of you
[59:14] back back from different trips and
[59:16] things that where you've been and I pray
[59:18] that you came back refreshed from the
[59:21] the meetings that you were in or
[59:22] wherever you have been so may you just
[59:26] come and bring your lick of fire and put
[59:28] it together with ours this morning and
[59:29] let's press home for the kingdom of God
[59:32] Amen Genesis Chapter 18 and verse 9 and
[59:36] they said unto him where is Sarah thy
[59:39] wife and he said behold in the tent and
[59:42] he said I will certainly returning to
[59:45] thee according to the time of life and
[59:47] lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son
[59:50] and Sarah heard it in the tent door
[59:53] which was behind him now Abraham and
[59:57] Sarah were old and well-stricken in AIDS
[1:00:00] and it ceased to be with Sarah after the
[1:00:03] manner of women so the Bible does
[1:00:06] acknowledge circumstances
[1:00:09] amen these were the these were the
[1:00:13] circumstances that Sarah and Abraham
[1:00:16] were old and well-stricken in age I can
[1:00:20] imagine that I'm not quite that old but
[1:00:23] I can imagine how that would be you know
[1:00:26] and it ceased to be with Sarah after the
[1:00:28] man or women therefore Sarah laughed
[1:00:32] within herself saying after I am waxed
[1:00:37] old shall I have pleasure my Lord be an
[1:00:40] old also and the Lord said unto Abraham
[1:00:44] wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I
[1:00:48] have a surge he bear a child which among
[1:00:50] is anything too hard for the Lord
[1:00:54] at the time appointed I will return unto
[1:00:58] thee according to the time of life and
[1:01:02] Sarah shall have a son listen this is
[1:01:05] not going to be your ability
[1:01:07] this is going to be me doing this
[1:01:11] and then Sarah denied Sam I laugh Notch
[1:01:15] for she was afraid but and he said nay
[1:01:18] but thou did his life
[1:01:21] may God bless you as you're seated
[1:01:24] I am going to speak this morning maybe
[1:01:27] it's a little odd text but I'm going to
[1:01:29] speak on Sarah watch your tongue
[1:01:34] you see Sarah within her heart or with
[1:01:37] inner self
[1:01:40] um she was thinking things that was out
[1:01:43] of step with what God's word had said
[1:01:47] God had just said something very clearly
[1:01:50] and precisely and here in the very face
[1:01:53] of God she doubts and she not only just
[1:01:56] doubt but within herself she actually
[1:01:59] laughs and that word is scoffs
[1:02:02] she actually mocks our laughs you know
[1:02:05] within ourselves he doesn't do it in a
[1:02:08] show it's just something that is uh that
[1:02:11] she's with inner self that she is
[1:02:14] thinking and she mockingly laughs you
[1:02:16] know and and thinking just how
[1:02:19] ridiculous can this be
[1:02:21] you know how how impossible in Earth and
[1:02:24] these thoughts get called out by God
[1:02:27] because brother Branham tells us that
[1:02:29] the angel of God
[1:02:31] told him to let us know that our
[1:02:35] thoughts are louder in heaven than our
[1:02:39] words are on the Earth
[1:02:41] so you want to really keep your your
[1:02:44] words uh pure but you also want to keep
[1:02:47] your thinking right
[1:02:49] you see thinking right is your duty to
[1:02:51] God and then doing right is your duty
[1:02:54] yourself and then after that you know
[1:02:56] you'll come out right so but Sarah in
[1:02:59] her heart is um is scoffing and she's
[1:03:01] doubting in the face of God and and then
[1:03:04] not only that but you know see basically
[1:03:06] uh when does she's confronted with the
[1:03:09] word saying but oh yeah this is your
[1:03:12] problem this is what you're doing she
[1:03:15] denies it in the face of God and
[1:03:17] basically calls God a liar
[1:03:21] and and I want you to understand God is
[1:03:24] Holy and he cannot stand sin
[1:03:27] and unbelief is the root of sin
[1:03:33] and and so again
[1:03:36] um as brother Branham refers to this and
[1:03:38] I'm gonna read about three quotes from
[1:03:40] that word that he refers to this very
[1:03:42] situation and he says the church is
[1:03:45] going to be there without spot a wrinkle
[1:03:48] in other words not one sin or one doubt
[1:03:51] no unbelief
[1:03:53] see and he says the grace of God will do
[1:03:57] that
[1:03:58] now if you notice this in this very
[1:04:00] thing the grace of God
[1:04:03] overrode Sarah's unbelief
[1:04:07] amen it overrode her even lying in the
[1:04:11] face of God and basically call him a
[1:04:14] liar that his word wasn't true
[1:04:16] right Grace over wrote it
[1:04:20] I want you to understand not only are we
[1:04:22] needing rapturing faith we need Rapture
[1:04:25] and Grace
[1:04:28] amen because of our own inabilities to
[1:04:32] believe our own human weaknesses to to
[1:04:35] lift ourselves up into the promise of
[1:04:38] God
[1:04:39] so he said it'll take Grace like he
[1:04:41] talks to Abraham when Sarah doubt him
[1:04:44] well then he would have slain Sarah
[1:04:46] right there for doubting because that's
[1:04:49] the worst sin there is is unbelief and
[1:04:52] the only sin so brother Branham explains
[1:04:55] to us that those others are attributes
[1:04:57] of sin smoking drinking lion cussing
[1:05:00] everything else he said is not sin
[1:05:02] that's the attributes of sin there's
[1:05:04] only one sin and that's unbelief
[1:05:06] and you and I are even though we are the
[1:05:10] redeemed children of God that we still
[1:05:14] need the blood
[1:05:16] and we still need the grace of God
[1:05:18] Amanda to keep us from sin and keep us
[1:05:22] from sinning and producing the
[1:05:24] attributes of sin but here again we
[1:05:28] every one of us are sinned by
[1:05:32] disbelieving the word of God by by not
[1:05:34] reaching and grabbing and claiming it as
[1:05:37] our as our own by doubting what God Said
[1:05:41] now I want to I want to deal with this a
[1:05:44] little bit because you're not alone with
[1:05:46] with the dealing with doubts and
[1:05:48] unbelief you're not by yourself the
[1:05:51] greatest prophets there has been great
[1:05:54] men of God to the ages this great woman
[1:05:57] of God doubt it disbelieved questioned
[1:06:01] wondered pondered that's human
[1:06:05] and I want you to understand you're
[1:06:07] going to be a human still for a long
[1:06:09] time until your body's changed and as
[1:06:12] long as you're in this body you're going
[1:06:14] to be fighting against imaginations
[1:06:16] against strongholds of the enemy against
[1:06:20] doubt against fear against unbelief of
[1:06:24] all kinds and you are going to have to
[1:06:26] constantly battle against it
[1:06:30] you're going to have to watch out and
[1:06:32] keep changing your thinking taking those
[1:06:35] thoughts captive bringing them subject
[1:06:37] to the word of God
[1:06:38] now she doubted she left within herself
[1:06:41] and when the angel discerned her through
[1:06:43] the tent is that right but why couldn't
[1:06:46] he take Sarah because she was part of
[1:06:49] Abraham
[1:06:51] she he went out to take Abraham too and
[1:06:53] we're a part of Jesus we're in the body
[1:06:56] of Christ
[1:06:57] our unbeliefs are excused if we do it
[1:07:00] ignorantly like she did for she was
[1:07:02] scared
[1:07:03] now notice what he said he said we are
[1:07:06] in Jesus we are in the body of Christ
[1:07:09] and that's why that sin or or say
[1:07:15] judgment should not strike us or will
[1:07:17] not strike us is because we're in Christ
[1:07:21] amen we're part of the promise we're
[1:07:24] part of a Redemption plan and God cannot
[1:07:28] abandon his Plan of Redemption
[1:07:33] hallelujah amen he cannot predestinate
[1:07:36] you and you are predestinated to Rapture
[1:07:40] come on you are predestinated to sit
[1:07:43] with him on his throne you are called of
[1:07:47] God to be an overcomer and God is
[1:07:50] predestinated you to that
[1:07:53] I want you to understand your destiny
[1:07:56] has been set and there's nothing in
[1:07:59] between here and there that is going to
[1:08:01] keep you from fulfilling your destiny
[1:08:07] Hallelujah because even in our
[1:08:11] weaknesses Grace is going to override it
[1:08:15] you are highly favored of the Lord and I
[1:08:18] want you to see yourself as highly
[1:08:21] favored
[1:08:22] called blessed chosen ordained
[1:08:26] consecrated dedicated sons of God
[1:08:29] Daughters of God
[1:08:31] that's who you are
[1:08:33] I don't care what the devil has been
[1:08:36] telling you I don't even care what
[1:08:38] you're all thinking is thinking amen I'm
[1:08:41] weak I'm not able I can't do it
[1:08:44] I have this inability look at my
[1:08:47] circumstances look at it it's impossible
[1:08:50] you've got to come back and look at this
[1:08:52] Grace over Brides your impossibilities
[1:08:56] [Applause]
[1:09:05] brother Branham said our sins would ruin
[1:09:09] us we're talking about Christians
[1:09:12] amen we're talking about Christians our
[1:09:16] sins would ruin us if we wasn't part of
[1:09:19] Christ
[1:09:21] he can't strike the church
[1:09:23] because we are Christ
[1:09:26] see Sarah and Abraham were one in Christ
[1:09:28] and his church is one our sins are
[1:09:31] covered by his blood by his faith not
[1:09:34] ours we're trusting in his finished work
[1:09:38] remember what he says to Sarah I'm going
[1:09:41] to do this
[1:09:42] I will return and I will give you a son
[1:09:46] this is not your abilities
[1:09:50] remember the only thing that should that
[1:09:52] gave her strength was when she does him
[1:09:56] faithful not that I can do this not that
[1:09:59] I'm the one able but my God is able
[1:10:03] [Applause]
[1:10:07] if not for Grace
[1:10:11] where would we be
[1:10:14] and we need it for rapture
[1:10:19] I need Grace
[1:10:21] he said let me give you a little Grace
[1:10:23] here brethren
[1:10:24] I need a little Grace
[1:10:27] amen
[1:10:29] that minute God would have killed Sarah
[1:10:32] for disbelief in that angel
[1:10:34] remember
[1:10:35] unbelief is sin
[1:10:39] and you approach and stand in the front
[1:10:41] of God remember with sin there will
[1:10:45] repel you or put you from his presence
[1:10:50] and he said God would have killed Sarah
[1:10:52] for disbelieving that angel he didn't
[1:10:54] look at that angel went down and told
[1:10:56] Lot's wife not to look back and see what
[1:10:58] happened to her for her unbelief see but
[1:11:01] he couldn't take Sarah because she was
[1:11:03] part of Abraham
[1:11:06] amen and today I believe the unbelief
[1:11:09] with the real true church true church
[1:11:11] she has unbelief but he can't touch her
[1:11:15] we're in Jesus you can't take the church
[1:11:18] without hurting Christ he couldn't take
[1:11:20] Sarah without hurting Abraham so Grace
[1:11:23] covered it
[1:11:27] now you know it's one thing about God he
[1:11:29] can't change his mind
[1:11:32] if he sent Jonah down down to Nineveh he
[1:11:37] couldn't he couldn't raise up Moses or
[1:11:39] get Elijah or hit somebody else
[1:11:41] he ordained children to do this job
[1:11:45] amen
[1:11:46] amen if God's ordained you to uh this
[1:11:49] day and this hour he can't call up
[1:11:51] somebody else
[1:11:53] ain't nobody can take your place
[1:11:57] amen you cannot be replaced God had
[1:12:01] thoughts of you before the world began
[1:12:03] and he cannot replace you with somebody
[1:12:06] else
[1:12:07] because that you are a failure in fact
[1:12:10] of the matter is Grace has got to take
[1:12:13] and change your life from failure to
[1:12:16] power
[1:12:22] God could not change his mind he had
[1:12:25] already told Abraham Sarah's going to
[1:12:27] have a child
[1:12:28] he'd already chosen Sarah
[1:12:31] nothing else could be done
[1:12:33] so therefore God has to go to work God
[1:12:36] has to give Grace God has to give
[1:12:38] forgiveness God has to give pardoned
[1:12:43] so you see see
[1:12:46] um God has said he will have a bride
[1:12:47] without spot or wrinkle
[1:12:49] and she will be a woman of faith
[1:12:53] amen you're called by Prophet that
[1:12:56] little faith woman
[1:12:58] and God of this evil age when he's
[1:13:00] talking about the evil age he talks
[1:13:01] about you then he said that little faith
[1:13:04] woman
[1:13:05] amen see you are you are people of faith
[1:13:12] now
[1:13:14] he will have a bride without spot a
[1:13:16] wrinkle and when he comes he says I'm
[1:13:19] looking for faith when I come back I'm
[1:13:21] looking for faith
[1:13:22] what do you think God's not going to get
[1:13:24] what he expects
[1:13:28] if God expects something don't you know
[1:13:31] it's going to come to pass
[1:13:33] so if he said I'm expecting faith when I
[1:13:36] come back
[1:13:37] then he's going to have faith somewhere
[1:13:40] and if you don't find Faith then he's
[1:13:42] got to bring the faith
[1:13:47] Hallelujah if you're locking this
[1:13:49] morning then the only one you can't add
[1:13:52] a foot to your statue you can't do
[1:13:54] nothing on your own that God will have
[1:13:57] to add it to you
[1:13:58] and all you've got to do is just yield
[1:14:01] yourself to God and say God I'm Yours
[1:14:05] they can change my life
[1:14:08] now God gets what he expects
[1:14:11] now
[1:14:13] there's so many times
[1:14:15] like Sarah we're still faithless she's
[1:14:18] still looking at herself instead of God
[1:14:21] of whom there is nothing too hard for
[1:14:24] looking at her circumstances
[1:14:27] this finally this last quote on that
[1:14:29] subject from birth pains why did Sarah
[1:14:31] laugh
[1:14:32] concerning this baby and circumference
[1:14:35] and said she didn't but you did
[1:14:37] and he would have killed her right there
[1:14:40] if she wasn't a part of Abraham so would
[1:14:43] God slay us if we wasn't a part of
[1:14:46] Christ but the mercies of Christ holds
[1:14:49] us all together us doubters and
[1:14:51] perversions in the word
[1:14:56] amen so you got to realize if you wasn't
[1:14:59] a part of his thoughts if he wasn't a
[1:15:02] part of his plan his word you see it
[1:15:05] might be different but God has to
[1:15:07] fulfill his word
[1:15:09] amen God cannot go back on his word so
[1:15:11] instead of killing you or just
[1:15:13] abandoning his plan God has to get us on
[1:15:16] board he's got to get you to believe him
[1:15:20] so he would send signs and wonders and
[1:15:23] miraculous send a message to Guinness
[1:15:26] believer to start changing our thinking
[1:15:30] and what I want you to do today is start
[1:15:32] changing your thinking about yourself
[1:15:36] about who you are as a Son of God or a
[1:15:39] daughter of God you're not some
[1:15:41] downtrodded something
[1:15:42] [Applause]
[1:15:45] your sons and daughters are the most
[1:15:47] high God
[1:15:49] you're the Queen of Heaven
[1:15:51] you're a princess
[1:15:53] amen now you see it and to do that we
[1:15:57] must change we must have the right
[1:15:59] attitude toward the promise and our
[1:16:01] thinking has to be corrected and our
[1:16:04] hearts have to be turned but and it's so
[1:16:07] important about what we think and what
[1:16:11] we say
[1:16:14] Proverbs 18 21 says death and life are
[1:16:18] in the power of the tongue
[1:16:20] and those who love it will eat its
[1:16:23] fruits
[1:16:24] so death and life
[1:16:26] is in the power of your tongue
[1:16:29] and and you you will eat the fruit of
[1:16:32] what you say
[1:16:35] are you with me amen you you if you're
[1:16:39] prone to negativity you're going to eat
[1:16:41] its fruits
[1:16:43] your tongue has the power to bring death
[1:16:45] or life
[1:16:47] and and if your confession will line up
[1:16:50] with God's word instead of your problems
[1:16:53] then you will eat the fruit of life and
[1:16:55] the blessings that comes from the word
[1:16:58] but as long as you're thinking you know
[1:17:01] well it'll never happen for me
[1:17:03] I can never be blessed
[1:17:05] you know into everything bad always
[1:17:07] happens to me
[1:17:09] I can't I can't ever be prosperous I I
[1:17:12] can't ever walk in Victory as long as
[1:17:15] you're thinking that you're going to eat
[1:17:18] the fruit of that
[1:17:20] but you've got to have the mindset amen
[1:17:24] that I can do all things through Christ
[1:17:27] that empowers me
[1:17:31] you got to cast down your imaginations
[1:17:34] you gotta cause and anything anything
[1:17:37] any hot thought that exalts itself
[1:17:39] against the word of God and here Sarah
[1:17:42] have thoughts
[1:17:45] that it exalted itself her problem her
[1:17:49] age her inability
[1:17:54] and she exalted that over what God Said
[1:18:01] the Bible said in Proverbs 6 24
[1:18:04] gracious words are like honeycomb
[1:18:07] sweetness to the soul and health to the
[1:18:10] body
[1:18:11] so you see saying the right thing having
[1:18:13] the right attitude about the word is of
[1:18:16] vital importance and it can't be over
[1:18:19] emphasized
[1:18:21] you want to be very careful even in your
[1:18:23] relationships well in your home with
[1:18:26] your with the husband and wife you want
[1:18:28] to be very careful about what what your
[1:18:32] words are because again it can bring
[1:18:35] either sickness or it can bring Health
[1:18:38] to a marriage
[1:18:41] if you're always down and always fussing
[1:18:45] and always a bickering about this or you
[1:18:49] know pointing out at the thoughts
[1:18:52] are pointing out you know the the
[1:18:55] limitations are you know I always down
[1:18:58] in the mouths about you will cause a
[1:19:01] health bad Health to your home to your
[1:19:05] marriage to your children
[1:19:08] and not only that you will pass that on
[1:19:10] to another generation
[1:19:15] you know some people are like oh Eeyore
[1:19:16] you know ain't nothing ever going to
[1:19:18] happen to me ain't nothing good ever
[1:19:21] happens for me oh I can ever get the
[1:19:23] blessings of God you know everybody's
[1:19:25] down on me and oh well me
[1:19:29] and they go through life for the whole
[1:19:32] mentality
[1:19:35] and then you pass that on your kids they
[1:19:37] learn to be negative just like you
[1:19:41] you want to watch what you say
[1:19:45] amen what's your tongue
[1:19:48] because gracious words are like
[1:19:51] honeycomb
[1:19:53] they they are their sweetness to the
[1:19:56] soul and help to the body it'll energize
[1:19:59] you
[1:20:00] have you ever had somebody say something
[1:20:03] nice about you something good about you
[1:20:05] and it just energizes you you know it it
[1:20:08] just makes you want to even be better
[1:20:12] that's where you all need to do with
[1:20:13] your children tell them how good they
[1:20:15] are
[1:20:16] how wonderful they are
[1:20:18] you know how proud you are of them
[1:20:23] amen tell your daughter she's beautiful
[1:20:26] she needs to hear it from her daddy
[1:20:28] you're beautiful you are loved
[1:20:33] you're special
[1:20:36] you're God's daughter you're chosen
[1:20:39] you're blessed
[1:20:41] your sons need to hear it

[1:20:47] failure don't tell your kid that tell
[1:20:49] them you're going to rise up above any
[1:20:52] problem any crisis any situation you're

[1:21:07] it's Health to the body it's healthy the
[1:21:10] marriage a lot of marriages are ruined
[1:21:13] by negative comments
[1:21:16] can come from the husband or the wife
[1:21:20] a lot of children are warped
[1:21:22] it can never be good enough they're
[1:21:24] always hadn't overcome some something
[1:21:26] you know from that was put on them a
[1:21:30] cloud of doubter unbelief
[1:21:33] don't do that speak Faith to your
[1:21:35] children
[1:21:36] speak Faith to yourself speak Faith to
[1:21:39] your spouse
[1:21:42] amen amen oh yeah I'm not saying ignore
[1:21:45] circumstances yeah things are tight but
[1:21:47] he said he'll bless me
[1:21:50] yeah yeah you know I mean I got this
[1:21:53] deal today you know warn your people uh
[1:21:55] you know that somebody was you know I
[1:21:57] guess in good faces trying to say better
[1:21:59] warn your people that the economy is
[1:22:01] going to collapse and it's all going
[1:22:03] into failure well what good can you do
[1:22:05] about it my Jesus said don't even worry
[1:22:07] about tomorrow he said you got enough
[1:22:09] evil for today why why worry about
[1:22:12] tomorrow don't even think about it
[1:22:15] there ain't nothing you can do to change
[1:22:17] it anyway
[1:22:19] come on so what can you do you can walk
[1:22:22] in Grace
[1:22:25] let me tell you if you stay in the
[1:22:27] promised land of faith in God's word God
[1:22:32] will even bless you during family
[1:22:36] when the economy is bad
[1:22:40] when banks are falling everywhere
[1:22:43] gotta make you to prosper
[1:22:51] brother John it is the word amen he told
[1:22:55] Isaac remain in this land he was tempted
[1:22:58] to go down to Egypt because of the
[1:22:59] famine remain in this land and he
[1:23:03] planted during a drought
[1:23:05] and God blessed a hundredfold
[1:23:10] when everybody else had crop failures
[1:23:13] Hallelujah
[1:23:15] people had blessings because they stayed
[1:23:18] in the land of faith and believing
[1:23:32] now even redeemed Sons I mean great men
[1:23:36] of God even I'll use brother Branham for
[1:23:39] example I'm going to use him a little
[1:23:40] bit here
[1:23:41] and when he's thinking of Mark 11 22
[1:23:45] and and he's thinking about it he has to
[1:23:47] have his thinking corrected he has the
[1:23:49] wrong thoughts
[1:23:51] you see because any of us can have the
[1:23:54] wrong thoughts thus the wrong attitude
[1:23:56] toward the scripture
[1:23:58] and he was looking at Mark 11 22 and 3
[1:24:01] and saying you know well that's was that
[1:24:04] was before the atonement so you know it
[1:24:06] really doesn't apply to us because it
[1:24:08] would have to come through the atonement
[1:24:10] and Jesus said that before the atonement
[1:24:12] and things like that and God had to
[1:24:15] correct his thinking to show him that
[1:24:18] the lips of a man can be anointed to say
[1:24:21] the right things
[1:24:24] remember how do you write
[1:24:26] amen you remember even when the fish was
[1:24:29] giving back his life you we've heard the
[1:24:32] story of most of you young people I
[1:24:34] guess would know I hope you have read
[1:24:36] the uh the supernatural books because
[1:24:38] they should they're they're available
[1:24:40] for for all of our young people to know
[1:24:43] of what God did in this generation
[1:24:46] but you know in their brother Branham
[1:24:48] was out fishing they ran out of bait and
[1:24:51] so they were trying to catch some little
[1:24:53] little fish forbaden and so
[1:24:56] Lyle well Woods one of one of the
[1:25:00] Banks's brother was was fishing with him
[1:25:02] in the Bowden he used too big of a hook
[1:25:05] and and it swallowed the the hook and he
[1:25:08] just jumped it out right this entrance
[1:25:10] right out through his mouth and flicked
[1:25:12] it out into the water and said oh a
[1:25:15] little fishy you you've shot your last
[1:25:17] wad
[1:25:19] but you know and and um brother Branham
[1:25:23] is standing or there he's already had a
[1:25:26] vision or a word from God saying you're
[1:25:29] going to see the resurrection of a small
[1:25:31] animal
[1:25:33] and so he already has this word but he
[1:25:35] don't know where it's going to be he
[1:25:36] thought maybe a little Joseph had
[1:25:38] squeezed the cat and a little kitten
[1:25:40] there and dropped it and and it died and
[1:25:42] he thought maybe that was it but it
[1:25:43] wasn't you see I want you to get
[1:25:46] something even prophets probe wonder how
[1:25:50] is this going to happen
[1:25:53] where does this fit in when is this
[1:25:55] going to take place
[1:25:58] and so he said I later he would say I
[1:26:02] would have said none well no more spoke
[1:26:05] to that fish than nothing if something
[1:26:07] hadn't spoke to him to me first
[1:26:09] but he said what was it he spoke that
[1:26:12] secondarily now the brother random
[1:26:15] teaches us and I'm probably going to do
[1:26:16] a sermon on this about the written word
[1:26:19] and defeating the Devil with the written
[1:26:21] word
[1:26:22] but God gives us first the written word
[1:26:26] but secondarily he gives his prophets
[1:26:29] and with that prophets he gives visions
[1:26:32] and also secondarily way of God speaking
[1:26:35] is through Apostles prophets teachers of
[1:26:37] answers and pastors
[1:26:38] actually this morning as I preach and if
[1:26:41] I under the inspiration I am prophesying
[1:26:46] amen I'm speaking forth the word of God
[1:26:48] the Bible calls it Oracles of God or God
[1:26:51] used in a man to speak through his lips
[1:26:53] putting something on his heart to deal
[1:26:55] with yours
[1:26:57] amen so you see he spoke those
[1:27:00] secondarily by the Holy Spirit through
[1:27:02] the human lips and become the creative
[1:27:04] power of almighty God because God said
[1:27:07] so
[1:27:08] and it taken that way how much more
[1:27:10] could he through if taken that way how
[1:27:13] much more could he do the written word
[1:27:15] of the Lord God that was spoken through
[1:27:17] human lift as it was so it Falcon
[1:27:19] believe how simple just don't doubt it
[1:27:22] so he said if you take the word take
[1:27:25] just the Bible scripture
[1:27:27] just what is written in the word of God
[1:27:30] amen that it's actually greater than a
[1:27:33] secondary way
[1:27:35] a prophecy or a vision or a prophet
[1:27:39] speaking
[1:27:40] amen because it is first God's primary
[1:27:44] way of speaking you through your Bible
[1:27:46] that's why you ought to get in love with
[1:27:48] your Bible and read it and and take it
[1:27:50] for yourself
[1:27:53] God's speaking to you
[1:27:55] now
[1:27:56] so now that's why why we think on these
[1:28:00] things we meditate
[1:28:02] on the word of God let the meditation of
[1:28:05] my heart be acceptable in thy sight oh
[1:28:08] God
[1:28:09] now Psalms 19 verse 14 let the word of
[1:28:13] my mouth
[1:28:14] I want to read it to you and the
[1:28:16] meditation of my heart be acceptable in
[1:28:19] my sight O Lord my strength and my
[1:28:23] redeemer are you with me
[1:28:26] amen
[1:28:29] so again let the words of my mouth the
[1:28:32] meditation what I think on be acceptable
[1:28:36] because you're going to know my thoughts
[1:28:38] are louder in heaven
[1:28:40] that my words are on Earth
[1:28:43] so you know you're sitting there you're
[1:28:45] thinking all these dark thoughts and
[1:28:47] unbelief
[1:28:49] what's going through the halls of Heaven
[1:28:54] that's why you need a shield of blood
[1:28:57] but that's also why you need to stop for
[1:29:00] a moment and quit thinking those kind of
[1:29:02] thoughts
[1:29:05] amen
[1:29:06] but think on things that are acceptable
[1:29:09] in his sight oh Lord my strength and my
[1:29:11] redeemer so be careful what you think
[1:29:13] about
[1:29:15] maybe you guard your tongue but you're
[1:29:18] sinning with your thoughts
[1:29:20] maybe you had don't even say it
[1:29:22] but this is what you're dwelling on or
[1:29:24] what you're thinking about
[1:29:27] what you're meditating on now let's talk
[1:29:30] about what we have been prophesied to be
[1:29:32] we have been prophesied to be a super
[1:29:36] Church
[1:29:37] it's a much that all the Bible
[1:29:40] prophecies will be fulfilled in us that
[1:29:42] speaks of the bride and you must think
[1:29:45] of yourself as a super Church
[1:29:50] come on now to be a super Church
[1:29:54] you gotta think of yourself
[1:29:56] as a super Church
[1:29:59] he called us bride
[1:30:01] he said we are blessed
[1:30:04] he calls us sons and daughters
[1:30:06] it is he the Bible said it is he that
[1:30:09] has made us and not we ourselves
[1:30:12] a lot of people say well don't call
[1:30:14] yourself the brides you know you keep
[1:30:16] saying bride bride bride you know you're
[1:30:18] trying to make yourself some I'm not
[1:30:19] making myself nothing he made me
[1:30:25] he put the engagement ring on my finger
[1:30:28] before the foundation of the world
[1:30:30] he chose me before I turned back and
[1:30:35] chose him
[1:30:36] [Music]
[1:30:38] come on
[1:30:39] he loved me first
[1:30:42] when I was still unlovable by the way
[1:30:47] and he gave himself for me
[1:30:49] so brother Bradham talks about the super
[1:30:51] race he says now this is what I'm trying
[1:30:54] to say unto you the law of reproduction
[1:30:57] brings forth of his kind now if God
[1:30:59] planted word in this day through a
[1:31:01] prophet how many beliefs he did
[1:31:02] then of course then the law of
[1:31:05] reproduction says then there's got to be
[1:31:06] a word bride that comes forth
[1:31:08] so these last days the true church Bride
[1:31:11] Comes The Headstone he said will be a
[1:31:13] super Church a super race as it nears
[1:31:17] the great headstone there will be they
[1:31:20] will be so much like him until they will
[1:31:23] be in his very image in order to be
[1:31:25] United with him they will be one they
[1:31:28] will be the very manifestations of the
[1:31:31] word of the Living God that means they
[1:31:33] will be more than theology but they will
[1:31:36] actually be the word in action
[1:31:40] listen brother Branham the blood of
[1:31:43] Jesus so thoroughly cleanse us that
[1:31:47] there's no trace of sin
[1:31:50] I'm talking to the sinless virtuous
[1:31:53] bride of Christ
[1:31:55] even though you know you know you were
[1:31:59] doubting and you know you've been
[1:32:01] thinking wrong and you know you've been
[1:32:04] scoffing and saying I mean no not me
[1:32:06] never I I can't never do it
[1:32:09] I'm too little I'm unable I'm not
[1:32:12] equipped I'm not good enough I've got a
[1:32:15] past
[1:32:17] you see you see but the blood of Jesus
[1:32:21] Christ cleanses you from all sins
[1:32:26] and the complete word of God rests
[1:32:29] within you
[1:32:30] that the command of their own voice is
[1:32:33] creative power because in them is the
[1:32:36] Holy Ghost
[1:32:38] think about that the words that you
[1:32:41] speak have creative power
[1:32:45] amen and the and this this Holy Ghost is
[1:32:49] a Creator and he makes things come to
[1:32:51] pass because he speaks the word and the
[1:32:54] word spoken becomes God in action
[1:32:57] so there again when you start speaking
[1:33:00] the word it puts God into action
[1:33:03] so the third poll we know is the opening
[1:33:06] of the word we talk about it sometimes
[1:33:08] we know there was the speaking of the
[1:33:10] squirrels the healing of of um meet of
[1:33:13] Branham and the the um the common of the
[1:33:17] storm all the other things that went
[1:33:18] along with it how do you write and the
[1:33:21] salvation of her two boys
[1:33:23] but so that all of that shows the power
[1:33:26] that lays within the word
[1:33:29] amen
[1:33:31] and
[1:33:32] so it is the opening of the word it is
[1:33:35] the revealing of the Mysteries
[1:33:38] but it's not just restored truth
[1:33:42] and revealing Mysteries but there is a
[1:33:45] super anointing that comes with it
[1:33:51] now I want to get with the word
[1:33:55] stay with me now with the word that we
[1:33:59] have received comes a super anointing
[1:34:03] with the third pull came a super
[1:34:06] anointing
[1:34:09] now but of course
[1:34:13] we're human
[1:34:15] we're still here in these bodies
[1:34:18] we still think a lot like humans
[1:34:20] and we don't always think God thoughts
[1:34:24] and we doubt and we flushed her we get
[1:34:27] agitated and worry and fear
[1:34:33] now
[1:34:34] and not only that we have some more
[1:34:37] problems we have changed the message
[1:34:40] into lecturing
[1:34:43] and sorry to say but that's what too
[1:34:45] many Pizza many message preachers have
[1:34:48] done that have left the word of
[1:34:50] preaching the power and they're just I'm
[1:34:54] just going to say it this way
[1:34:55] unsophisticated lectures
[1:34:58] mix and psychology with the message
[1:35:02] now I call them unsophisticated because
[1:35:04] must have never went to school
[1:35:09] most of them aren't theologians so
[1:35:12] they're not sophisticated
[1:35:14] I'm not a sophisticated preacher either
[1:35:18] I was called of God I would sing Bible
[1:35:21] School Jesus did
[1:35:25] and all the prophets somebody help me
[1:35:27] preach I didn't go to it like Paul did
[1:35:30] who studied under chameleon had to
[1:35:31] forget all he knew
[1:35:34] that he might learn Christ
[1:35:37] now but it but let me just say let me
[1:35:40] just say this to to these message
[1:35:41] preachers preaching Psychology today if
[1:35:44] you're going to teach psychology
[1:35:46] then at least go to college for it
[1:35:51] you know these ignorant preachers who
[1:35:53] want to read a book and then try to
[1:35:54] implement implement it changing by
[1:35:57] changing Behavior patterns of people
[1:36:00] that's what somebody reading a book on
[1:36:02] doing surgery and going to move my
[1:36:04] remove my gallbladder
[1:36:07] or do a heart bypass
[1:36:09] and think they can implement it
[1:36:12] you know brother Jonathan wants to be a
[1:36:14] doctor
[1:36:15] that's his goal and his ambition but I
[1:36:18] don't want him moving my gallbladder yet
[1:36:21] he might be very smart and very studied
[1:36:24] and he might have read a few books on
[1:36:26] biology and how to do it but he ain't
[1:36:29] experimenting on me
[1:36:32] and I don't want no preacher
[1:36:35] using his
[1:36:37] book rat theology or psychology on me
[1:36:42] and trying to
[1:36:45] reform my nature
[1:36:48] amen but I want somebody who's
[1:36:50] experiencing the Holy Ghost who has met
[1:36:54] God that can lead me to Christ and have
[1:36:57] a baptism of the holy spirit that
[1:37:00] changes lives
[1:37:04] that's what I want
[1:37:06] so if you're going to teach a new birth
[1:37:08] I say experience it first
[1:37:11] so you know what you're talking about
[1:37:14] amen
[1:37:16] I can't help you with psychology I know
[1:37:18] nothing about it
[1:37:20] but I can help you with a new birth
[1:37:22] because I've experienced it
[1:37:26] amen
[1:37:27] not only that I've had many successful
[1:37:30] operations
[1:37:37] amen this room is full of many
[1:37:40] successful operations
[1:37:48] and three kinds of Believers brother
[1:37:50] Brandon said then there are those with
[1:37:52] the talents that is the great organizers
[1:37:54] worldly wisdom they preach the gospel
[1:37:56] claim to smart man intellectual listen a
[1:37:59] man that's trained in that field he's
[1:38:01] not a preacher he's a lecturer and
[1:38:02] that's the problem today we have
[1:38:04] lectures Jesus said never said go and
[1:38:08] train and do this he said go and preach
[1:38:10] the gospel and these signs shall follow
[1:38:12] the preaching see that's not learned to
[1:38:15] make a lecture who can stand and just my
[1:38:17] put them uh flowery things in and make
[1:38:20] you feel like you're sitting in the
[1:38:21] presence of an archangel that isn't it
[1:38:23] Heaven forms of godliness you see that's
[1:38:26] a lecture not the Holy Spirit In Action
[1:38:28] some little fellow that wouldn't know
[1:38:30] his ABCs might come down with the power
[1:38:32] of Faith with the word and make the Holy
[1:38:34] Spirit do things that that man knows
[1:38:36] nothing about and deny it see there you
[1:38:38] are
[1:38:39] then he goes on and tells us and today
[1:38:42] the church
[1:38:43] ought to be
[1:38:45] Jesus Christ in action upon the Earth
[1:38:47] because I live you shall live also my
[1:38:51] life in you the works that I do you'll
[1:38:53] do also see the church has to get to
[1:38:55] that place too and he promised it would
[1:38:58] do it and it will and it's got to come
[1:39:01] that way so you see that's what takes
[1:39:03] place we've got to be that way so Jesus
[1:39:06] Christ in action is what God will have
[1:39:09] and has in a bride
[1:39:12] amen do you realize we are an invincible
[1:39:16] Army
[1:39:20] that's what he made us
[1:39:22] by the anointing on us what about David
[1:39:25] he was invincible
[1:39:28] because of the anointing
[1:39:30] he could break the Yoke of the
[1:39:32] Philistine because of the anointing
[1:39:35] I want you to understand with this
[1:39:37] anointing you can do all things
[1:39:40] when you start letting the word start
[1:39:42] anoint your thinking
[1:39:45] anoint your thoughts anoint your words
[1:39:48] and then you begin to speak words that
[1:39:50] energize that bring Health that bring
[1:39:53] life that brings power
[1:39:56] but we're we like Sarah we doubt we
[1:40:00] fluster we get unnerved
[1:40:02] Sarah kind of got a nerved and lied in
[1:40:05] the face of God
[1:40:06] basically called him a liar
[1:40:12] so I was cerebral at him well
[1:40:15] sorry to tell you but brother Branham
[1:40:17] also doubted and flustered
[1:40:20] so do I
[1:40:22] so does every human
[1:40:26] so does every man of God
[1:40:29] I have a daughter of God Jesus brother
[1:40:32] Branham was as human as we are
[1:40:36] Amen brother Branham said about prophets
[1:40:38] they're not infallible men they make
[1:40:40] mistakes
[1:40:43] you're not infallible either you make
[1:40:45] mistakes I make mistakes
[1:40:50] and if you ever hear the account of the
[1:40:52] squirrels
[1:40:53] you will hear an account of a man
[1:40:56] questioning wondering doubting and
[1:41:00] having to be convinced
[1:41:04] I encourage you to listen to this I want
[1:41:06] you to write it down take a note on it
[1:41:08] even if you had to grab your phone to do
[1:41:10] it speak to this mountain in San Jose
[1:41:12] California November 23 1959 I want you
[1:41:15] to listen to that that's homework
[1:41:17] requirement of everybody
[1:41:20] I'd played the whole tape this morning
[1:41:22] if I could have the time
[1:41:25] but then speak to this mountain you will
[1:41:27] hear Brother Branham over and over and
[1:41:29] over and over telling of of the creative
[1:41:32] power of God
[1:41:34] while he is still doubting questioning
[1:41:38] wondering and yet when God can get him
[1:41:42] in obedience he is speaking creation
[1:41:50] but what is it was God showing us
[1:41:52] through the prophet that even though we
[1:41:55] get flustered and doubt
[1:41:58] that God's grace overrides our Humanity
[1:42:06] you see we have a part in this to play
[1:42:09] there's something we got to do
[1:42:11] we got to believe in order for it to
[1:42:14] happen
[1:42:15] and we don't believe that we're able we
[1:42:17] believe he's able
[1:42:19] this is what gave Sarah Street she
[1:42:21] judged him faithful he's the faithful
[1:42:24] God he's the able God there's nothing
[1:42:27] too hard for him this is too hard for me
[1:42:32] but not too hard for him
[1:42:36] now
[1:42:38] so we have a part in play you see God
[1:42:41] could not bring forth the promised son
[1:42:42] without Sarah
[1:42:44] he couldn't get another woman
[1:42:46] he had to get Sarah to believe that she
[1:42:49] was the promised woman and if God said
[1:42:51] I'll have a bride without spot or
[1:42:54] wrinkle or blemish
[1:42:56] and you try and you try and you try and
[1:42:59] you try and you try listen I want to
[1:43:01] tell you how much he expects out of you
[1:43:04] he said these words be ye therefore
[1:43:08] perfect
[1:43:11] how perfect Lord as perfect as your
[1:43:14] father in Heaven
[1:43:19] now that's the legalistic side of the
[1:43:22] coin
[1:43:24] whether they call it heads or tails it's
[1:43:27] the legalistic side
[1:43:29] and I can look at you and ask you he
[1:43:32] said be you therefore perfect are you
[1:43:34] perfect
[1:43:35] have you made mistakes
[1:43:38] is there imperfection in you
[1:43:40] why don't you try a little harder
[1:43:44] what's the matter with you anyway he
[1:43:46] said be you therefore perfect you're not
[1:43:48] going to make Heaven unless you are
[1:43:51] now let me flip the coin
[1:43:53] on the other coin is not legalism it's
[1:43:56] Grace
[1:43:58] and Grace says you can't be perfect
[1:44:02] so I'm going to make you perfect
[1:44:05] and I have to declare you're perfect in
[1:44:07] my sight
[1:44:08] you're loved in my sight amen is by as
[1:44:12] far as I'm concerned you're perfect
[1:44:15] you're my bride You're My Chosen me
[1:44:17] you're my left
[1:44:20] makes up for your life
[1:44:23] so therefore you become this perfect
[1:44:26] as your heavenly father
[1:44:28] is perfect
[1:44:33] Hallelujah
[1:44:35] but you see we have a part in this to
[1:44:38] play
[1:44:40] we have to be a people in action
[1:44:43] a people who is casting down imagination
[1:44:45] every hot thing that exalts itself
[1:44:48] against the word of God
[1:44:50] amen so brother Brandon said why did
[1:44:53] Jesus stand there and say to Mary and
[1:44:55] Martha take away the stone he was God
[1:44:57] and he could say Stone be no more and it
[1:45:00] would have been no more
[1:45:01] but she had to do something
[1:45:04] and when when he's why do you stand
[1:45:06] there and look upon the Harvest and you
[1:45:08] believe he's the lord of the Harvest he
[1:45:09] said to his disciples you pray to the
[1:45:12] Lord to the Harvest that he will send
[1:45:14] labors into the Harvest in other words
[1:45:17] you ask me to do what I'm going to do
[1:45:20] God put you in partnership with him for
[1:45:24] you to speak what his will is
[1:45:29] in order to bring that will into
[1:45:31] existence
[1:45:34] he said we're buddies it's a church we
[1:45:37] got to do something ourselves you've got
[1:45:39] to do something you got something to do
[1:45:41] here's the gospel I know it but if you
[1:45:43] just sit there don't preach it what good
[1:45:45] is it going to do you've got to do
[1:45:46] something
[1:45:47] you got something to do you got to make
[1:45:49] an effort you say well I believe God can
[1:45:51] heal but I just don't know stand up and
[1:45:54] let the word become your word and
[1:45:56] believe it don't reason it just believe
[1:45:59] it
[1:46:01] but you've got to believe
[1:46:05] and then that falls into an atmosphere
[1:46:07] of faith and has got to produce
[1:46:12] now I want you to get understand the
[1:46:14] word of God has C is a seed and it has
[1:46:17] power in it
[1:46:18] life within it
[1:46:20] but the only way it can come forth a
[1:46:23] seed has to be in the right atmosphere
[1:46:29] and it has to be in the atmosphere of
[1:46:31] Faith to produce
[1:46:34] now
[1:46:35] when we we all probably if you're
[1:46:39] message Believers have been around very
[1:46:41] long you probably heard of brother
[1:46:43] Branham having a vision
[1:46:45] of the silver Grizzly and how that came
[1:46:47] to pass just exactly
[1:46:51] but then again he had another vision of
[1:46:54] a
[1:46:55] of a brown bear
[1:46:57] and he he saw it and and how big it was
[1:47:01] and described it and and everything else
[1:47:03] and said I I was with some young fellows
[1:47:06] and so on like that and and I I got this
[1:47:09] Mammoth brown bear now that's the vision
[1:47:13] now I want to show you something here's
[1:47:15] the vision
[1:47:20] come on
[1:47:21] the word of God is your vision
[1:47:23] it speaks of you
[1:47:25] amen now brother Branham because and he
[1:47:30] calls it because of frustration and
[1:47:32] doubting and not acting like a servant
[1:47:37] he said the vision came
[1:47:39] and came to pass just exactly
[1:47:43] but he said I was not standing there
[1:47:46] because my faith would not move me up
[1:47:48] into that place
[1:47:53] so brother Branham never collected that
[1:47:55] bear though he had a vision of it
[1:48:02] now and he would stand in the message
[1:48:05] count down
[1:48:06] and he'd say and and in his presence
[1:48:09] there's three of them right there in a
[1:48:11] row right after he comes off of that
[1:48:12] hunting trip and he says I apologize
[1:48:15] before God and the people are being
[1:48:17] stupid
[1:48:20] and making many mistakes
[1:48:24] he looks at what he has done his
[1:48:26] misdivision
[1:48:28] he is disobeyed the word of God because
[1:48:32] he disobeyed it didn't walk with the
[1:48:34] vision he wasn't blessed you know God
[1:48:36] gives a vision of your healing but if
[1:48:37] you don't walk with it
[1:48:40] if you don't accept it as your own if
[1:48:43] you don't if you don't move up into that
[1:48:45] it's going to happen for somebody
[1:48:48] and it could happen for you because it's
[1:48:51] for all believers
[1:48:55] but you can sit there and doubt and say
[1:48:57] well maybe next time
[1:48:59] maybe another day make excuses well my
[1:49:02] problem's worse it's too hard you know
[1:49:05] nobody like mine has ever overcome this
[1:49:10] and the message count down
[1:49:12] brother Branham said
[1:49:14] he said I've gone on 32 years of
[1:49:16] ministry I've tried to stay true to the
[1:49:18] word I don't know one thing I've had to
[1:49:19] alter on because I've read it out the
[1:49:21] Bible and just what the Bible said and
[1:49:24] Let It Go like that and I hadn't had to
[1:49:26] take it back or rearrange because I said
[1:49:28] it just the way the Bible says it and I
[1:49:31] find out if God has spoken anything then
[1:49:34] we must go with that word
[1:49:36] in order to make it be fulfilled
[1:49:40] now he's referencing missing his vision
[1:49:42] we've seen that as I told you last night
[1:49:44] of a vision recently that he just
[1:49:46] apologized for being stupid
[1:49:49] I'm just quoting what he said
[1:49:52] and he says um that and he apologized
[1:49:55] for that and he said and he said we must
[1:49:57] go with that word in order to be
[1:49:59] fulfilled we just seen that as I told
[1:50:01] you last night of a vision just recently
[1:50:03] I had to be there and warn him to be
[1:50:06] there and telling me six months before
[1:50:08] to be on that spot and stand there and
[1:50:11] saying go down there three times with
[1:50:13] them and I just walked on with the other
[1:50:16] men and the vision passed right through
[1:50:19] exactly God's part and I was left
[1:50:22] standing
[1:50:24] so we want to remember you've got to
[1:50:26] stay on the word just stay right with
[1:50:28] the word and where the word leads you go
[1:50:30] right with that word and it'll bring you
[1:50:32] all out
[1:50:35] so then in the night service and in his
[1:50:38] presence
[1:50:39] he's praying he's repenting he said my
[1:50:41] hands up Lord
[1:50:42] what will I do now father I have got so
[1:50:45] many things I do wrong
[1:50:51] I've just confessed my sin this morning
[1:50:53] before the churches I confessed it to
[1:50:55] you on the top of the mountain the other
[1:50:56] morning when it was blowing and snowing
[1:50:59] up there on the top of the mountain to
[1:51:01] how I cried out and ask you to forgive
[1:51:04] me for my stupidity
[1:51:06] and I had dreaded to come before my
[1:51:08] brother who I have some of them regard
[1:51:09] me as your Prophet servant and Lord how
[1:51:12] I hated it come before them and tell
[1:51:14] them of a stupid act that I would do a
[1:51:17] thing like that but God is good for my
[1:51:19] soul that I confess my sins and not hide
[1:51:22] them so to be honest with you and right
[1:51:24] before the people I've confessed it Lord
[1:51:26] I'm wrong I'm all together wrong and I
[1:51:28] pray forgiveness
[1:51:33] this is a prophet
[1:51:36] because Elijah was a man of light
[1:51:38] passion as we all are
[1:51:41] come on
[1:51:43] he had his ups and downs
[1:51:45] he had his faults his failures
[1:51:48] he had his shortcomings
[1:51:51] and then and of course the squirrels the
[1:51:53] same way that I just told you to go and
[1:51:55] listen to is very plain you'll you'll
[1:51:58] hear a man say you know questioning
[1:52:01] wondering second guessing himself
[1:52:03] pondered was that the voice of God
[1:52:05] wasn't it not the voice of God am I
[1:52:07] imagining this or what is it
[1:52:11] and and so he doubted he disbelieved it
[1:52:13] he become flustered
[1:52:16] but I want you to know this though that
[1:52:18] Grace overroot it
[1:52:21] to show us that in this third poll that
[1:52:25] in spite of our frustrations and our
[1:52:28] doubts and our fears and our unbelief
[1:52:31] that God comes along with Grace and
[1:52:34] overrides it and sends a super anointing
[1:52:41] now
[1:52:44] so with the third pull comes the super
[1:52:46] anointing with this word comes a super
[1:52:49] anointing
[1:52:50] it's more than a theology
[1:52:53] and he said that as he was speaking
[1:52:56] there of them squirrels when I spoke he
[1:52:59] said hey here come I'll call it a super
[1:53:01] anointed swept over again and I was
[1:53:03] almost off my feet and said say what you
[1:53:05] will and it shall be given to you
[1:53:08] I want you to know that God was
[1:53:10] anointing a man with words that would
[1:53:13] create
[1:53:16] and he would tell the experience of his
[1:53:18] experience to the right family where
[1:53:20] brother and sister ride and their grown
[1:53:22] children Edith and Hattie and Shelby
[1:53:24] were present there with banks woods and
[1:53:27] they're sitting around the table and
[1:53:28] they're talking about how he said that
[1:53:31] was Saint Jehovah jira trying to get his
[1:53:34] promise over to me trying to in other
[1:53:35] words trying to show the power that's in
[1:53:37] this word and that he that I could speak
[1:53:40] by me just like Abraham spoke his need
[1:53:44] down at the foot of the mountain and he
[1:53:46] said the Lord will provide himself a
[1:53:49] sacrifice and by words he created a ram
[1:53:58] God providing the sacrifice
[1:54:01] through his words
[1:54:03] get the problem get the picture
[1:54:05] through his words
[1:54:07] amen and here Abraham looks at it there
[1:54:11] he said yeah there's the fire and and
[1:54:13] there there's the wood but where is the
[1:54:16] sacrifice Isaac asked and he said the
[1:54:18] Lord himself will provide that
[1:54:22] and God provided a realm listen we talk
[1:54:27] about speaking squirrels into existence
[1:54:28] it's been done through the Old Testament
[1:54:30] somebody helped me preach you know that
[1:54:33] a ram was spoken to existence what do
[1:54:36] you think would happen when he when
[1:54:37] Moses took his rod and and he and he and
[1:54:40] he hit the uh and and called for flies
[1:54:42] or or he called for mites or or Lucas or
[1:54:46] whatever he was creating
[1:54:51] under the blood of bulls and goats well
[1:54:54] how much more then when you're in the
[1:54:57] path of Duty
[1:54:58] do you have the right to take the word
[1:55:01] and speak your need
[1:55:03] [Applause]
[1:55:08] laughs
[1:55:11] little Hattie hadn't said a word she's
[1:55:13] just sitting there listening
[1:55:15] but all of a sudden
[1:55:18] she spoke out
[1:55:19] loud
[1:55:21] the what's not words watch your mouth
[1:55:23] Sarah
[1:55:25] what are you going to say Hattie
[1:55:28] you know be easy to sit back there and
[1:55:30] say well you know yeah God can do that I
[1:55:33] guess but he don't do that today
[1:55:36] oh brother Branham you're just trying to
[1:55:38] make yourself some Prophet or something
[1:55:40] you know you made all this stuff up
[1:55:42] nobody even witnessed this
[1:55:45] she could have said a lot of things
[1:55:48] but when he said this is that all I know
[1:55:51] it would have to be is Jehovah Jireh and
[1:55:54] little Hattie was inspired to say that's
[1:55:56] nothing but the truth
[1:55:59] she just simply agreed
[1:56:02] and she spoke it out loud
[1:56:05] and when she spoke it he said I heard
[1:56:08] her voices it swept from my ears and he
[1:56:11] said there come that super anointing
[1:56:14] over me and it come again and said the
[1:56:17] first time it ever happened on a human
[1:56:19] being and I said I the I give you now
[1:56:23] what you ask you have pleased the Lord
[1:56:26] with what you said
[1:56:31] don't you want to please God with what
[1:56:33] you say
[1:56:35] it'll cause the super anointing to come
[1:56:40] the right attitude that where you're
[1:56:42] sitting this morning hearing the word
[1:56:44] preached can actually move God on your
[1:56:47] behalf
[1:56:50] or that you receive your need Matt
[1:56:53] because of the attitude and the response
[1:56:58] back to the word of God that's why it's
[1:57:00] so important to get the right kind of
[1:57:02] atmosphere in the church
[1:57:06] amen
[1:57:08] amen
[1:57:10] with that when that little fish was
[1:57:12] raised brother Brandon says because him
[1:57:13] boys said the right thing they were
[1:57:15] sitting there on the boat and they said
[1:57:16] you know
[1:57:17] um we remember when that that old woman
[1:57:20] up there the little old lady up there on
[1:57:22] the hill she's about 90 years old and
[1:57:24] when we were little Jehovah's Witness
[1:57:25] boys we used to go around to give us
[1:57:28] bread and butter remember that old
[1:57:29] homemade bread said we ought to go up
[1:57:31] there and tell her we got saved
[1:57:34] and he said that was the right thing
[1:57:36] please catch this it's just the way you
[1:57:40] say things sometimes it changes the
[1:57:42] whole setup they said the right thing
[1:57:45] for just them the Holy Spirit dropped
[1:57:48] upon me from the heaven somewhere and
[1:57:50] said I said thus saith the Lord
[1:57:53] and brother Branham there in that
[1:57:55] atmosphere were the right things were
[1:57:57] being said
[1:57:59] that please God brought an atmosphere
[1:58:01] that brought creation and life
[1:58:06] it brought salvation to two boys
[1:58:13] so you got to get in the spirit
[1:58:15] because the words that you say bring an
[1:58:18] atmosphere and so do the thoughts you
[1:58:21] think
[1:58:22] the thoughts you think will create an
[1:58:26] atmosphere around you you're thinking
[1:58:29] dark thoughts there'll be a dark shadow
[1:58:31] hanging right around you
[1:58:35] amen I don't want you to miss this so
[1:58:37] wake up
[1:58:39] so brother Branham talks about it and he
[1:58:41] talks about atmosphere I want to just I
[1:58:44] want to talk about this because brother
[1:58:45] Branham knew the importance of getting
[1:58:48] an atmospheres
[1:58:50] he knew the importance of worship
[1:58:53] a lot of times people think well you
[1:58:55] know well brother Tim the way that y'all
[1:58:57] worship God and the way you're doing uh
[1:58:59] brother random would have never done
[1:59:00] that you don't even know brother Branham
[1:59:03] you're judging it by your own Baptist or
[1:59:06] Catholic ideas
[1:59:09] from preconceived denominational uh idea
[1:59:15] brother Brandon said and I want you to
[1:59:17] get this and speak to this mountain he
[1:59:20] said each night you'll hear this on tape
[1:59:22] when you listen to it he said the holy
[1:59:24] spirit is here wherever you go he's
[1:59:26] always there just remember he's right
[1:59:29] here
[1:59:30] he knows what you're thinking
[1:59:32] he knows your attitude toward the word
[1:59:35] amen and you're the right mental
[1:59:38] attitude toward any Divine promise will
[1:59:40] bring it to pass
[1:59:41] I can get you thinking right this
[1:59:43] morning
[1:59:44] amen the word will come to pass for you
[1:59:46] healing will be yours Deliverance will
[1:59:50] be yours Victory will be yours
[1:59:53] so listen he said he said well he's
[1:59:57] always there you'll never get away from
[1:59:58] him David said no matter where he made
[2:00:00] his bed God was there because the angels
[2:00:03] of God are encamped about those that
[2:00:06] fear or reverence him just think they
[2:00:09] are they just take their Camp they sit
[2:00:11] right down by you and watching you all
[2:00:13] the time if you get this realized for a
[2:00:14] moment you are in the presence of angels
[2:00:19] Sarah do you realize who you're talking
[2:00:21] to
[2:00:24] are we just another denominational group
[2:00:28] is that what we are no we are people
[2:00:31] that the pillar of fire visits this
[2:00:33] church
[2:00:36] amen that the angels of God in Camp
[2:00:39] about those that believe him
[2:00:41] that we are in the presence of angels
[2:00:44] this morning
[2:00:48] what's now
[2:00:52] brother Bradham used an old term we
[2:00:53] don't use it anymore but you'll get it
[2:00:55] in a minute we kind of changed it in
[2:00:58] this day made it a little more
[2:00:59] politically correct but I'm going to use
[2:01:01] it just so he said it
[2:01:02] and he sat down
[2:01:05] he said in our country down in the south
[2:01:08] we have a lot of colored people that's
[2:01:10] very spiritual
[2:01:12] and they come to my meeting sometimes
[2:01:14] and they sing a little song for me
[2:01:16] and I remember there used to be a little
[2:01:18] maybe an old colored sister
[2:01:21] ah if she couldn't sing that and just
[2:01:24] bring the spirit of God into the midst
[2:01:27] of the people
[2:01:29] she sung and brought the spirit of God
[2:01:33] into the midst of the people
[2:01:38] creating atmospheres
[2:01:41] and she sang all day all night the
[2:01:45] angels are watching over me
[2:01:48] and oh if she couldn't sing that
[2:01:51] and then brother Brandon says but you
[2:01:53] know I was a start your old Baptist and
[2:01:55] I just sat there and looked at it and
[2:01:57] grimaced
[2:01:59] that ain't what he said
[2:02:00] he said so I just almost had to tie my
[2:02:04] hands to keep from ruining the meeting
[2:02:05] just jumping up and down and screaming
[2:02:07] and running all over the place now you
[2:02:10] didn't think I did that did you but I do
[2:02:13] I don't but he does it in me and I
[2:02:16] believe that anybody felt the way I did
[2:02:18] they'd do the same thing it's just an
[2:02:21] experience
[2:02:27] so this little sister singing would
[2:02:31] bring the spirit down and brother
[2:02:33] Branham would respond to that
[2:02:36] by screaming and shouting and jumping
[2:02:39] all over the place and running all over
[2:02:42] the place
[2:02:45] that's your prophet
[2:02:47] that's my prophet
[2:02:50] so when it is open in prayer
[2:02:52] he prays like this
[2:02:54] dear God we are grateful to thee for the
[2:02:57] privilege of knowing the his personal
[2:02:59] savior knowing we have passed from death
[2:03:01] into life
[2:03:02] then that Spirit of Christ dwells in us
[2:03:05] and around us and among us and we're as
[2:03:06] people is called by his name and the
[2:03:09] angels Were Watching Over Us day and
[2:03:11] night they never leave they're encamped
[2:03:13] about and we can expect God to do most
[2:03:15] anything at any time because the
[2:03:18] presence of the angels of God who are
[2:03:20] commissioned by him to watch over us and
[2:03:22] care for us and father we pray that the
[2:03:25] angels will take their place tonight by
[2:03:27] the sight of each believer and all
[2:03:29] around down to the building
[2:03:32] you see because he taught us over and
[2:03:34] again the right thinking
[2:03:38] brings the angels to the Forefront
[2:03:43] the right thinking
[2:03:46] makes you realize their intent about us
[2:03:48] but it brings them it makes them known
[2:03:52] so when you get to thinking on him
[2:03:55] when you get your attitude right when
[2:03:58] you have the right atmosphere about you
[2:04:00] it draws the presence of the Angels to
[2:04:04] become manifested among you in power
[2:04:09] come on Church your brother Brandon told
[2:04:12] us he said you know empty senses because
[2:04:14] of sin in the beginning we were blinded
[2:04:17] to the Supernatural and and and whatever
[2:04:20] you know with with our first sense but
[2:04:23] he said when we leave from here said
[2:04:26] you know I and that's what I've always
[2:04:28] said there's not going to be an atheist
[2:04:31] there's never an atheist after death
[2:04:36] everyone who believes in God
[2:04:39] a little bit too late
[2:04:41] but everyone believes in God
[2:04:43] one breath Beyond here all these Earthly
[2:04:47] senses fade away that blinds us from
[2:04:49] seeing the supernatural Realm that
[2:04:52] angels are presents
[2:04:54] and brother Brandon said he he said
[2:04:56] things that you don't know nothing about
[2:04:57] now you see it plainly when you cross
[2:04:59] there that Veil
[2:05:01] you don't understand it now because
[2:05:03] you're bumping into it and you haven't
[2:05:06] got that sense you just say I feel real
[2:05:08] strange here look how it looks to me
[2:05:10] like I just want to cry or shout or
[2:05:13] something it's the angels of the Lord
[2:05:16] what amen you think sometimes that's
[2:05:19] just flesh brother Brandon said it was
[2:05:21] the angels of the Lord
[2:05:23] that was causing them to shout or cry or
[2:05:27] worship
[2:05:28] because they were bumping into the
[2:05:30] angels
[2:05:32] and when you begin to realize he's
[2:05:35] present that things begin to happen
[2:05:40] and when Hattie said the right thing
[2:05:44] there was a super anointing swept on me
[2:05:46] and said tell her she's found Grace in
[2:05:48] her in God's sight
[2:05:51] tell her whatever she asks
[2:05:53] said he knew what he would ask he knew
[2:05:55] God knew she wouldn't ask for a million
[2:05:57] dollars
[2:05:58] or new home
[2:06:00] he knew what he would ask he'd ask for
[2:06:02] her two sons
[2:06:06] so therefore he gave it there she could
[2:06:09] have asked but God knew what she was
[2:06:11] asked for
[2:06:12] and and he said he said there
[2:06:16] um by the will of God and by the power
[2:06:18] of God I give you in the name of Jesus
[2:06:19] Christ your desire and her two boys
[2:06:21] shook under the power of God and the
[2:06:24] whole building trembled and Banks felon
[2:06:27] just played and Shelby grabbed and had
[2:06:29] he screamed until you could hear her for
[2:06:31] two blocks
[2:06:33] that's what happened
[2:06:35] in a third pool Ministry
[2:06:40] amen oh I know we want to point out well
[2:06:43] when Jesus opened the book and you know
[2:06:45] and that was a greatest anointing ever
[2:06:47] gave and just precious words proceeded
[2:06:49] out of his mouth
[2:06:51] but when the third pull there was
[2:06:53] manifested to human being a super
[2:06:56] anointing came over there and a woman
[2:06:58] screamed out
[2:07:00] rejoicing that could have been hurt for
[2:07:03] two blocks
[2:07:04] you can't put God in your little box
[2:07:07] [Applause]
[2:07:11] I'm not saying you got to scream I'm not
[2:07:13] saying you gotta dance but don't put him
[2:07:16] in your little box and say we can't
[2:07:20] [Applause]
[2:07:24] because if you experience what I
[2:07:27] experience
[2:07:29] if you know what I know
[2:07:32] if you have happened to you what has
[2:07:34] happened to me
[2:07:35] you'd be shouting too
[2:07:38] come on amen that's exactly right now
[2:07:41] brother Branham after that experience he
[2:07:44] would he would go back and look in the
[2:07:46] Bible and he said look at look at kid
[2:07:48] look at Caleb there saying you know I'm
[2:07:50] 80 years old Joshua put this sword in my
[2:07:53] hand 40 years ago and I'm just as good a
[2:07:56] man today as I was then and brother
[2:07:58] Brandon said God be merciful to me I'll
[2:08:01] see examples in the Bible
[2:08:04] and he said I took my wife by the hand
[2:08:06] across this Bible and her little Bible
[2:08:09] and I said honey
[2:08:11] I have been too negative
[2:08:15] the Holy Spirit condemns me
[2:08:18] when I said I think of them squirrels
[2:08:20] out yonder I think I've had you right
[2:08:22] back there in these little boys
[2:08:25] I think of what God did so and he was
[2:08:27] God that could create Hallelujah I
[2:08:29] thought he told he said told me that
[2:08:31] years ago I'll not leave y'all never
[2:08:33] forsake you no man will stand before you
[2:08:35] all the days of Life I'll be with you
[2:08:37] and from this hand of discernment to
[2:08:39] come to know that you know the secrets
[2:08:41] of the heart and after that it'll race
[2:08:43] Higher and Higher and a year after that
[2:08:46] proved perfect around the world and here
[2:08:48] comes this other great ministry far
[2:08:50] beyond it I said honey I take your hand
[2:08:52] but God's help and Grace let me never be
[2:08:56] negative again
[2:08:58] let me walk forward to this revival tear
[2:09:02] to preach like never before
[2:09:04] let me go here to verse sanctify myself
[2:09:06] and make away from the people from that
[2:09:09] my own sins my own neglecting will be
[2:09:11] under the blood my own shortcuts be
[2:09:13] under the blood that I might walk out
[2:09:15] and say follow me people that's right I
[2:09:18] hate to see a guy said you go do it I
[2:09:20] hate to see somebody that but I like to
[2:09:22] see somebody that'll lead the way
[2:09:25] you see
[2:09:27] at some point
[2:09:29] you got to stop the negativity
[2:09:33] amen
[2:09:35] it ain't even spiritual
[2:09:38] to be able to find something
[2:09:41] negative about somebody else
[2:09:45] you're just fulfilling the job of the
[2:09:49] accuser of the brethren
[2:09:54] so don't judge your spirituality on your
[2:09:57] criticism
[2:10:03] now
[2:10:05] watch this for a moment
[2:10:07] brother Brandon said it's strange that
[2:10:10] this is taught to people they say well
[2:10:13] I'm weak you know a lot of people think
[2:10:15] that's spiritual that's real humble I'm
[2:10:18] going to be humble I I'm just a poor old
[2:10:21] weak Christian
[2:10:23] just barely make
[2:10:25] no no nobody think nothing of me I don't
[2:10:31] you talked me into it
[2:10:34] if you think that about yourself that's
[2:10:36] probably true
[2:10:41] well I'm weak you know there's many of
[2:10:45] you are so negative about yourself
[2:10:54] you look at yourself and your
[2:10:56] shortcomings and and whatever and and
[2:11:00] you know I heard of a blind woman
[2:11:03] and she got her site
[2:11:05] I
[2:11:06] something happens you actually raise
[2:11:08] this window up and thought she had
[2:11:10] latched it and popped her on the head
[2:11:12] and her side came
[2:11:14] and she hadn't seen herself in 20 years
[2:11:18] and she went and looked in the mirror at
[2:11:20] herself and all she could see was one
[2:11:21] great big old nose after her
[2:11:25] and she thought she was so ugly because
[2:11:27] of this big old nose
[2:11:29] and after a while she came to realize
[2:11:31] her nose wasn't any different from
[2:11:33] anybody else's
[2:11:35] but you see that's the way it is
[2:11:37] sometimes you know we look there and we
[2:11:39] find some little blemish some little
[2:11:41] flaw or I'm not this or some inadequacy
[2:11:44] you got to realize friends yes you got
[2:11:47] inadequacies
[2:11:49] but you see grace makes up for those
[2:11:51] inadequacies
[2:11:55] amen
[2:11:58] listen when Abraham lied
[2:12:02] oh God help me as I go here for a minute
[2:12:04] when Abraham lied abimelech had to get
[2:12:07] him to come pray for him
[2:12:10] and who just lied to him because God
[2:12:13] said that's my prophet
[2:12:15] and you're cursed until he prays for you
[2:12:19] you mean a man that just lied to me yes
[2:12:22] that's my Prophet I still respect his
[2:12:26] office I still respect this gift and
[2:12:28] besides that he's under a blood
[2:12:30] sacrifice
[2:12:35] take that devil
[2:12:43] they did this they did that they did
[2:12:45] that
[2:12:47] but we still got the power to tell you
[2:12:49] to leave devil
[2:12:51] we still got the power to cast you out
[2:12:54] to cast down your reason to cast down
[2:12:56] your doubting to cast down your fear
[2:12:59] well I'm weak my faith isn't very much
[2:13:03] I'm not a very good Christian
[2:13:06] that's just what the devil wants you to
[2:13:10] say
[2:13:11] you're just talking his language right
[2:13:14] then
[2:13:16] you must never say that
[2:13:20] don't never let your testimony be
[2:13:23] negative let it be positive all the time
[2:13:26] I'm saved
[2:13:29] amen I I have God in my heart
[2:13:33] amen I believe him with all my heart do
[2:13:36] you believe in Divine Healing with all
[2:13:38] my heart let your testimony and always
[2:13:40] your thoughts and everything never
[2:13:42] permit a negative thought to come in
[2:13:44] your mind if you can help it
[2:13:47] and when it starts that don't entertain
[2:13:49] it
[2:13:53] entertain angels
[2:13:55] entertain the word entertain the
[2:13:58] thoughts of God but don't entertain the
[2:14:01] negativity
[2:14:05] you say well I can't help them talks
[2:14:07] from coming well be like the farmer that
[2:14:09] said he couldn't stop the birds from
[2:14:10] flying over his place but he is short
[2:14:12] stop them from roosting
[2:14:13] amen so that's a good thing you can't
[2:14:15] help the thoughts when they come but
[2:14:17] don't entertain them just pass it on no
[2:14:20] Jesus Is My Savior all things are mined
[2:14:23] by God and I'm going to keep them and
[2:14:25] I'm going to testify them
[2:14:27] and God can only bless you as you
[2:14:30] confess he's done it for you
[2:14:33] amen
[2:14:35] ye can only bless you as you confess so
[2:14:38] I confess I'm saved
[2:14:39] I'm Healed I've delivered I'm free from
[2:14:43] bondage
[2:14:45] I'm free from that complex I'm free from
[2:14:48] family traits I breed from the past I'm
[2:14:52] free from sin I am a child of the most
[2:14:54] high God I can walk through this wall
[2:14:57] with my shoulders back in my head held
[2:14:59] high
[2:15:09] but all true men of God
[2:15:11] and women of God have these moments
[2:15:13] we're like Sarah we get frustrated and
[2:15:16] we doubt
[2:15:17] and it seems like the longer the weight
[2:15:21] the more opportunity is given to doubt
[2:15:24] and disbelieve the promises
[2:15:26] we will get stirred enough to hope for
[2:15:28] deliverance
[2:15:30] and then go back into despair
[2:15:32] and we will give them lip service and a
[2:15:36] mental Ascent to the promise for healing
[2:15:38] or Deliverance but in a heart we begin
[2:15:42] to doubt
[2:15:44] we doubt and don't realize our position
[2:15:46] in Christ it's like Sarah doubted her
[2:15:48] position in the family of Abraham
[2:15:53] yes
[2:15:54] we want the position of being the bride
[2:15:57] of Christ but we don't believe we are
[2:15:59] what he said we are
[2:16:02] that we are the super Church
[2:16:05] the word said of us there's been Brides
[2:16:07] brides churches churches Brides bride
[2:16:09] but there's got to come one
[2:16:11] Hallelujah there's got to come a real
[2:16:12] bread there was must be one come that's
[2:16:15] not only the mechanics but the Dynamics
[2:16:17] of it that makes the church live and
[2:16:19] move in power of his resurrection
[2:16:22] see
[2:16:24] we are sometimes very content and
[2:16:26] satisfied having the the mechanics and
[2:16:30] the doctrines and the Mystery truths but
[2:16:32] never take our position of authority
[2:16:35] that goes with it
[2:16:38] you know there there again you know he
[2:16:41] tells Moses when he comes to an obstacle
[2:16:43] did you ever notice what God told him
[2:16:47] said and and he goes down to Egypt and
[2:16:49] said now you will go down to Egypt and
[2:16:53] you will bring these people out and you
[2:16:55] will come back here and worship me here
[2:16:57] on this mountain
[2:17:03] hello
[2:17:04] do you realize he just told Moses his
[2:17:08] destiny
[2:17:10] that you're going to be successful in
[2:17:12] what you're going to do
[2:17:14] that no weapon formed against you is
[2:17:16] going to prosper
[2:17:18] that I have set your destiny for you to
[2:17:20] go there and bring these people
[2:17:25] back to this mountain
[2:17:27] amen so what did Moses do praise God the
[2:17:31] Pharaoh got in a way he called down
[2:17:33] plagues
[2:17:34] amen he tormented the devil until the
[2:17:37] devil said get out
[2:17:40] come on it's time you turn the table on
[2:17:43] the Devil he's tormented you enough
[2:17:46] he told you how unworthy you are how no
[2:17:49] good how unfit how impossible it is for
[2:17:52] you to be the bride of Christ he's told
[2:17:54] you all of these things
[2:17:56] but God said you're going to be in a
[2:17:59] meeting in the air
[2:18:00] and I'm anointing You by a prophet to
[2:18:03] sit on the throne
[2:18:04] do you realize come on church amen if a
[2:18:08] Red Sea got in his way he wasn't to cry
[2:18:10] out to God and say God why did you get
[2:18:12] me in this horrible Jam you didn't tell
[2:18:15] me I was going to have a Red Sea in my
[2:18:17] way an impossible situation
[2:18:20] God had said I'm going to bring you back
[2:18:24] to this place
[2:18:26] he didn't say he didn't tell him the
[2:18:28] obstacles he just said I'm going to do
[2:18:29] it now what was Moses to do God said why
[2:18:33] are you crying to me hadn't I told you
[2:18:37] haven't I shown you my power
[2:18:39] haven't I described but I show you my
[2:18:42] love haven't I shown you my grace then
[2:18:45] speak
[2:18:47] [Applause]
[2:18:49] you see you're crying you're mourning
[2:18:51] you're seeing the wrong things to God
[2:18:53] quit saying that and speak positive
[2:18:59] go calling for the impossibilities to
[2:19:02] become possibilities
[2:19:04] he swim flow from this way west wind
[2:19:06] blow this way you don't move the Red Sea
[2:19:09] let's make a path right through it
[2:19:15] remember is speak and go forward but
[2:19:19] instead of speaking the word we speak
[2:19:22] the problem
[2:19:25] the Egyptians
[2:19:27] they're right here on that trail they're
[2:19:29] coming to kill us and they're mad now
[2:19:31] we're in all the firstborn are dead
[2:19:33] they're armed they got their chariots
[2:19:35] they got their best man they're gonna
[2:19:37] kill us all
[2:19:42] look at here where hemmed in this
[2:19:44] mountain this way and then surrounding
[2:19:46] this sea in the other
[2:19:47] it's impossible God said go forward
[2:19:50] I'm telling you this morning I don't
[2:19:52] care what your impossibilities are go
[2:19:55] forward to your promise
[2:19:58] amen you might be bearing like Sarah was
[2:20:01] but go forward to your promise you may
[2:20:03] be unable to do it but go forward your
[2:20:05] promise you may be a Barren Soul or bear
[2:20:07] in turn but go forward to your promise
[2:20:09] you can have Revival
[2:20:12] you can have the spirit of God move
[2:20:15] you see in your tongue is the power of
[2:20:17] binding or losing
[2:20:19] Jesus said whatsoever you're buying on
[2:20:21] Earth and be bound in heaven whatever
[2:20:24] you loose on Earth will be loose in
[2:20:25] heaven
[2:20:26] your words
[2:20:28] are you even an unspoken attitude can
[2:20:31] bind the promises of God and make them
[2:20:34] ineffective for you or your words can
[2:20:38] release
[2:20:39] the promises of God to you
[2:20:43] God told Moses to speak to the Rock
[2:20:46] instead of obeying
[2:20:49] Moses spoke to the people and called
[2:20:51] them rebellious
[2:20:52] you see God said to Moses speak to the
[2:20:55] Rock get and get the answer and said
[2:20:57] Moses spoke the problem
[2:20:59] and because of that he didn't enter the
[2:21:01] Promised Land
[2:21:03] what Moses did is an example of Idle
[2:21:06] Words
[2:21:07] instead of using his words to work for
[2:21:09] him and get an answer Moses spoke the
[2:21:11] problem and didn't enter into the
[2:21:13] Promised Land
[2:21:14] so when I ask you are you speaking The
[2:21:16] Word of Promise are you speaking your
[2:21:19] problem
[2:21:22] which one is bigger to you which one is
[2:21:25] God to you
[2:21:26] come on you make the medical report your
[2:21:29] God
[2:21:31] the medical for the medical report said
[2:21:34] this said that statistics said this now
[2:21:38] you're making all of that God make the
[2:21:40] word god
[2:21:43] put him in his proper place
[2:21:47] brother Brandon said when you get to
[2:21:49] thinking about Divine Healing get them
[2:21:51] thinking about Christ keep him on your
[2:21:53] mind if there be any praise any virtue
[2:21:55] the Bible said think on these things
[2:21:58] and if any thought comes by well maybe
[2:22:00] it couldn't be so maybe get your mind
[2:22:03] off your mind right quick think on
[2:22:05] things that's positive never let a
[2:22:08] negative thought pass through don't let
[2:22:10] it stop anyhow if it starts to keep your
[2:22:13] thoughts positive
[2:22:15] Jesus
[2:22:19] don't think sitting in a wheelchair that
[2:22:22] you're hopeless
[2:22:23] and helpless you are not
[2:22:27] don't let that negative thought ever
[2:22:29] pass through don't let it anchor you
[2:22:32] can't help from it go into your mind but
[2:22:33] don't let it stop
[2:22:36] amen and he said like the birds he said
[2:22:38] farmer keeping the birds away he said
[2:22:40] take a double barrel shotgun
[2:22:43] you know what you need to do every
[2:22:45] morning is load your gun
[2:22:49] hey man it's got two barrels all the New
[2:22:51] Testament
[2:22:52] take a promise from each one of them and
[2:22:55] arm yourself
[2:22:56] and when the Devil comes by burn his
[2:22:59] hide
[2:23:02] amen this time you put the enemy on the
[2:23:04] Run instead of running from your enemy
[2:23:07] amen
[2:23:09] brother Brandon said there's no negative
[2:23:11] thoughts at all in Christianity
[2:23:13] everything is past tense it's already
[2:23:15] finished healing's not what a man can do
[2:23:17] is what God's done it's a finished work
[2:23:19] salvation is not what a man could do or
[2:23:21] what the church can do it's a finished
[2:23:23] work and your faith in that finished
[2:23:24] work that Christ completed everything
[2:23:26] that was brought before the uh
[2:23:30] brought in the fall Christ redeemed it
[2:23:32] back in his atoning death vicarious
[2:23:34] suffering at Christ
[2:23:36] so you see there again
[2:23:39] we we got to change our thinking
[2:23:42] and some of us are worse about this than
[2:23:45] others
[2:23:46] just by Nature
[2:23:48] just by Nature
[2:23:50] you're maybe born
[2:23:52] with your nature that way some are
[2:23:55] Melancholy by Nature
[2:23:58] and it seems
[2:24:00] and really it seems sometimes that the
[2:24:03] more spiritual and gifted
[2:24:05] that that we are the more
[2:24:07] we realize they're inadequates because
[2:24:09] the devil sure knows how to point him
[2:24:11] out
[2:24:14] and just like Sarah we look at the
[2:24:15] circumstances I'm too old Abraham's too
[2:24:18] old
[2:24:20] this was really going to happen why
[2:24:22] didn't happen years ago
[2:24:24] When We Were Young
[2:24:26] you know we can't have a true
[2:24:28] Pentecostal experience and so we can be
[2:24:30] happy we're just an intellectual
[2:24:32] conception just given a mental sense of
[2:24:35] the truth you know God's never going to
[2:24:36] move
[2:24:38] but God is going to prove to his elect
[2:24:41] in this day that there is nothing too
[2:24:43] hard for the Lord
[2:24:46] and he was challenging Sarah to start
[2:24:48] believing that God is faithful
[2:24:53] that he's a faithful God
[2:24:55] amen that he says that he feels and that
[2:24:59] he can do exactly like he did at
[2:25:01] Pentecost and he gives overcoming power
[2:25:05] wow you said brother Tim you speak about
[2:25:07] that a lot well brother Brandon said
[2:25:09] himself God help me if I die pop her in
[2:25:12] the Pulpit I'll speak of the original
[2:25:14] Rock I'll speak of the original
[2:25:15] experience I'll speak of the Original
[2:25:17] Scriptures and give them the baptism of
[2:25:19] the Holy Ghost repent every one of you
[2:25:21] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[2:25:23] Christ for the mission of sin and you
[2:25:25] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[2:25:26] the ever-present of the flowing Waters
[2:25:29] from the rock is still with us it'll
[2:25:31] bring forth the same thing it'll bring
[2:25:32] forth visions and bring forth healers
[2:25:34] let it bring forth prophecy it'll bring
[2:25:36] everything it did
[2:25:39] but our unbelief
[2:25:41] and our down deep heart confession
[2:25:44] is the main cause of our sin
[2:25:47] and if it wasn't for Grace
[2:25:49] God would just abandon his program
[2:25:52] but he can't go back on his word
[2:25:55] amen because our unbelief would send us
[2:25:57] to hell
[2:25:59] listen God Is So holy brother Brandon
[2:26:02] describes him that if there was a
[2:26:05] hundred billion sons look toward him
[2:26:09] what's there in the eternity way back in
[2:26:13] eternity he said when a hundred billion
[2:26:15] Sons would look back to him that's how
[2:26:19] holy he is Where Angels look dirty in
[2:26:23] his sight that's Jehovah
[2:26:27] amen and still he become a little baby
[2:26:30] over a manure Pile in a manger and that
[2:26:33] stood Jehovah and he's here he's here
[2:26:35] tonight through his grace into his blood
[2:26:38] and he cleanses his church and puts us
[2:26:40] in a position to receive all these
[2:26:43] blessings that he paid for
[2:26:46] so therefore we forgot to realize
[2:26:48] friends that yeah Angels even look dirty
[2:26:52] in his sight
[2:26:53] but he's got a blood covering for you
[2:26:56] [Music]
[2:26:59] yes he knows your thoughts this is why
[2:27:02] we need Rapture and Grace this is why we
[2:27:05] need the mercies of God otherwise listen
[2:27:07] with the demon spirits of unbelief that
[2:27:10] has been released in this day we would
[2:27:12] all be unbelievers
[2:27:15] but God is predestinated I said we're
[2:27:18] not going to go through the tribulation
[2:27:21] so therefore he's turned us from every
[2:27:23] imperfection to bring us into a perfect
[2:27:26] place for a perfect rupture
[2:27:29] amen as I listen to sermons of brother
[2:27:32] branham's I often would hear him say he
[2:27:34] would pray God forgive me of my sins
[2:27:37] I know it wasn't drinking or porn or
[2:27:40] adultery but just unbelief our own human
[2:27:43] weakness
[2:27:45] our inabilities
[2:27:47] to grasp the promise of God
[2:27:50] I want to emphasize this moment
[2:27:54] we take the scripture that said
[2:27:56] Paul said
[2:27:58] I keep my body under subjection
[2:28:01] that after preaching to others that I
[2:28:03] would become a Castaway
[2:28:06] and a lot of people are worried about
[2:28:08] becoming a Castaway somehow you know if
[2:28:12] I fail if I the flesh gets in the way
[2:28:14] God's going to cast me away God cannot
[2:28:17] cast you out
[2:28:21] get that thought out of your mind
[2:28:24] he cannot cast your way
[2:28:28] he can remold you
[2:28:31] and remake you but he'll never Throw the
[2:28:34] Clay Away
[2:28:37] come on now
[2:28:39] now Paul wouldn't see him now I keep my
[2:28:42] body under subjection or else I'm going
[2:28:44] to be lost I you know a lot of people
[2:28:46] say am I going to be the Judas am I
[2:28:49] going to be the betrayer am I I'm scared
[2:28:51] I'll turn out I'll turn out I'll be the
[2:28:53] I'll be the next Judas I'll be the next
[2:28:55] betrayer I've failed somehow don't think
[2:28:58] that
[2:29:03] because Paul wasn't saying that you're
[2:29:05] going to be a Castaway you're going to
[2:29:06] be like Judas
[2:29:08] be cast away but rather where God can't
[2:29:11] use us
[2:29:13] what borrowed Judas listen Paul nothing
[2:29:16] he had opportunity to repent
[2:29:19] and you got opportunity to repent
[2:29:22] and you may have been a Judas but you
[2:29:24] don't have to remain to do this
[2:29:30] how many times is it that God can't use
[2:29:33] us because of our unbelief
[2:29:37] you have to keep your thoughts under
[2:29:39] subjection
[2:29:40] or God's not going to be able to use you
[2:29:44] in other words he'll have to set you
[2:29:46] aside
[2:29:47] until you come back to believing again
[2:29:51] now
[2:29:53] you know that
[2:29:54] even the greatest of men have worried
[2:29:57] and wrestled with the thought of or the
[2:29:59] fear of being an impersonator afraid
[2:30:02] I'll just be an impersonator you're not
[2:30:08] yet you say well I know his presence
[2:30:10] like brother Branham said you know they
[2:30:12] they tried to tell him you're just an
[2:30:13] impersonator too that's what you are
[2:30:15] brother Brandon you're just trying to
[2:30:17] impersonate something and he said I know
[2:30:20] his presence and I know I love him and
[2:30:22] how could I be a devil and and love the
[2:30:25] Lord Jesus the way I do how could my
[2:30:27] heart bleed for him and he knows my
[2:30:29] heart
[2:30:31] and that's what I say you know your
[2:30:33] heart your heart bleeds for him
[2:30:35] you love him
[2:30:37] how could you be in Judas and loving the
[2:30:39] way you do
[2:30:41] how could you be a failure and yet you
[2:30:44] love him the way you love him
[2:30:46] he's not going to turn you away he put
[2:30:48] that love in your heart
[2:30:53] now
[2:30:54] sure we asked for things and brother
[2:30:56] Branham said himself I pray many times
[2:30:59] and he said I feel like I'm orphaned
[2:31:02] because there's sometimes I have to
[2:31:04] solve things out by myself
[2:31:06] and he said I I'm looking at something
[2:31:09] here and he won't give me a vision and
[2:31:11] he and and I
[2:31:14] and he just lets me alone I'm sitting as
[2:31:16] an orphan like this morning and I don't
[2:31:18] know which way to turn so I'm committed
[2:31:20] to the Lord
[2:31:22] your eyes you we know we get in that
[2:31:25] situation we don't know which way to
[2:31:27] turn we don't know what to do but we
[2:31:30] know this if we'll keep our hearts right
[2:31:31] God will lead us
[2:31:33] it will be positive about who we are in
[2:31:36] Christ God will give direction for our
[2:31:39] lives
[2:31:39] like I said many will struggle with a
[2:31:41] with that Melancholy nature of this
[2:31:44] demons that attack us
[2:31:46] with anxiety and worry and depression
[2:31:51] there's many prophets of the Bibles
[2:31:56] there was of that temperament
[2:32:00] so don't take any offense to it
[2:32:02] and it can be a weakness
[2:32:04] and it can get you in trouble
[2:32:08] it can make you a Castaway not in a bad
[2:32:10] sense it's your loss but where God can't
[2:32:12] use you
[2:32:15] because you took too much emphasis on
[2:32:17] your weakness instead of the emphasis on
[2:32:20] his power
[2:32:24] but you see if you'll surrender that to
[2:32:26] God your nature to God you'll be
[2:32:29] sensitive to the spirit and leaning on
[2:32:31] him and looking to him to to him for
[2:32:34] guidance but if it's been in the wrong
[2:32:36] direction you'll always be timid and
[2:32:38] like that Holy boldness to make the
[2:32:41] necessary steps
[2:32:44] so you always have to fight against
[2:32:46] these thoughts every one of us you're
[2:32:49] going to fight against thoughts of
[2:32:51] unworthiness or I'm going to be a
[2:32:53] failure or I'm going to be a Judas or
[2:32:55] I'm going to be a betrayer I just
[2:32:57] encourage you this morning just fall in
[2:32:59] love with Jesus
[2:33:01] with all your heart but even more than
[2:33:04] that
[2:33:06] accepts his love
[2:33:13] he will not cast your way to hell you're
[2:33:17] saved
[2:33:18] never to be lost again
[2:33:23] come on Church
[2:33:25] you're sealed by a spirit that there's
[2:33:28] nothing the devil can do to unseal you
[2:33:34] you know checking your life over and
[2:33:36] over and over and over is good but I'm
[2:33:40] just going to tell you God don't want
[2:33:42] his sons and daughters living at the
[2:33:44] altar
[2:33:47] checking your life over and over living
[2:33:49] with condemnation but he wants you to
[2:33:51] live above the altar
[2:33:54] my goal in preaching is never just to
[2:33:57] get you to the altar sure if you need to
[2:33:59] come to altar get there get that settled
[2:34:01] but after that writes about the altar
[2:34:05] you see live above the Altar and walk in
[2:34:08] obedience with power
[2:34:12] let me ask you something would you want
[2:34:15] your children I'm in overtime I'm sorry
[2:34:17] I was going to be good today
[2:34:19] but would you want your children living
[2:34:21] in fear that anytime they displease you
[2:34:23] in some small way
[2:34:25] that you're going to quit loving them
[2:34:29] that you're going to kick them out of
[2:34:30] the house
[2:34:32] you're going to abandon your
[2:34:33] responsibility as a parent to them
[2:34:36] no I'm sure you you wouldn't want that
[2:34:39] and neither was does God want that kind
[2:34:41] of relationship between his sons and
[2:34:43] daughters
[2:34:44] he wants you walking with your head up
[2:34:47] confident in his love
[2:34:49] assure that he loves you come on
[2:34:51] somebody that he will never leave you or
[2:34:53] forsake you
[2:34:55] that even in your darkest trial he's
[2:34:57] going to go with you
[2:34:59] amen if necessary he'll carry you
[2:35:02] but he's not going to abandon you
[2:35:05] hey man if necessary he'll correct you
[2:35:07] like you will your children but cast you
[2:35:10] away never
[2:35:13] you would be grieved if you thought your
[2:35:16] children thought that of you
[2:35:18] so does it grieve the heart of God
[2:35:20] when we act or prey in unbelief
[2:35:26] quit asking God
[2:35:29] oh God won't you just kill me if I'm
[2:35:31] going to be a failure just just kill me
[2:35:32] would you want your children saying that
[2:35:38] confess rather your sonship
[2:35:41] Jesus taught us to pray like this what
[2:35:43] he told us how are we going to come come
[2:35:46] boldly
[2:35:47] before the throne of grace
[2:35:50] amen come bone before the throne of
[2:35:53] grace

[2:36:06] littlest gift of chocolate every service

[2:36:15] amen I may be Pastor I may be head of
[2:36:19] the church this may be my private office

[2:36:27] amen come on now you've got children
[2:36:30] he may be busy he may be God he may be
[2:36:34] holy he may be all of that but you're
[2:36:36] his children
[2:36:38] come boldly
[2:36:46] before what a throne of grace
[2:36:49] for instance
[2:36:53] rejection help
[2:36:57] in your time of need
[2:37:04] they don't come down sneaking and you
[2:37:06] know is he going to take me out this
[2:37:08] time you know is he Gonna Roll me up
[2:37:10] like a ball and kick me down the Halls
[2:37:12] he's going to say get out
[2:37:14] my grandkids don't do that they come in
[2:37:16] boldly
[2:37:18] I'm trying to tell you to do like that
[2:37:20] come boldly Before the Throne of God
[2:37:25] confess your sons your sonship
[2:37:28] this is how Jesus taught us to pray
[2:37:31] in the example prayer he said you pray
[2:37:33] this way our father
[2:37:37] what is that relationship
[2:37:40] so that's the first approach to God is
[2:37:43] acknowledging relationship between a son
[2:37:46] or a daughter and a father
[2:37:50] and what's he say about being a father
[2:37:52] he said if I know how good if you being
[2:37:54] evil or being human being being a human
[2:37:57] know how to give good things to your
[2:37:58] children want thy Heavenly Father give
[2:38:01] the Holy Ghost to anyone that asks it
[2:38:04] he's not going to give you something
[2:38:05] evil in return he's going to bless you
[2:38:07] every way he can
[2:38:09] watch now so he said Jesus taught us say
[2:38:12] our father begin every prayer recognize
[2:38:16] and acknowledging God is our father
[2:38:18] and I want to say he's a good father
[2:38:24] father we're positioning ourselves as
[2:38:26] Sons that's relationship
[2:38:30] even in the story of The Prodigal the
[2:38:33] father never rejected
[2:38:36] the Wayward Son
[2:38:39] he never
[2:38:41] he never downgraded him to a servant
[2:38:45] status
[2:38:47] in fact when he came back into his
[2:38:50] presence he put him back in position as
[2:38:54] a son
[2:38:55] put a thickly garment upon him and a
[2:38:59] ring on his finger and place him in
[2:39:01] authority and threw a party for him
[2:39:03] [Applause]
[2:39:05] God's going to bring a party when you
[2:39:07] recognize yourself as a son we're going
[2:39:09] to have celebrations
[2:39:11] because you're going to start having
[2:39:12] Victory after Victory after Victory
[2:39:14] because of the Ring of authority on your
[2:39:16] finger
[2:39:18] dressing yourself as a son and taking
[2:39:20] your position
[2:39:21] amen this declares
[2:39:25] the restoration to sonship is the heart
[2:39:27] of God
[2:39:29] then he said Hallowed be thy name
[2:39:32] thy kingdom come what is this worshiping
[2:39:34] him and acknowledging him as king
[2:39:39] with supreme power over everything
[2:39:44] so you come to him as a king knowing you
[2:39:47] can't ask too much
[2:39:49] of a king
[2:39:52] declaring you on his will
[2:39:55] and submitting to his will
[2:39:57] and then saying
[2:40:00] making your petitions now
[2:40:02] give us this day Our Daily Bread
[2:40:06] and this is a confidence the Bible says
[2:40:08] that we have in him if we ask anything
[2:40:10] according to his will and I want to say
[2:40:13] his will is his word
[2:40:16] if he says in his word he'll bless the
[2:40:18] barren women with children that's his
[2:40:20] will
[2:40:22] that's his vision for you if he says
[2:40:24] he'll bless you coming in and going out
[2:40:26] that's his vision for you if he said I
[2:40:28] bless you in the field or I bless you
[2:40:31] there in the city that's his vision for
[2:40:33] you
[2:40:34] so it's not hard to start praying the
[2:40:36] will of God and asking for the blessings
[2:40:38] of God because I know if I ask anything
[2:40:41] according to his will he's going to do
[2:40:44] it he wants to help me he wants to
[2:40:47] deliver me he wants to save
[2:40:49] he won't salivate me
[2:40:53] and then Lord forgive me as I forgive
[2:40:55] others
[2:40:57] let me offer the same thing that I've
[2:40:59] received to others leave me not into
[2:41:01] temptation don't ask to be tried
[2:41:04] don't ask for temptation
[2:41:06] but deliver me from the evil put your
[2:41:08] protection around me I need it Lord I
[2:41:12] don't want to walk another step without
[2:41:13] you I can't find the way alone and then
[2:41:16] you come right down there as you come to
[2:41:20] the end of your prayer and you say for
[2:41:22] thine is the kingdom the power the glory
[2:41:26] unending
[2:41:29] let's Stand Together
[2:41:31] I want you to walk in Victory with the
[2:41:34] mindset of victory
[2:41:35] I want you to walk in faith without
[2:41:37] doubting him
[2:41:39] about wondering whether he's a bad
[2:41:41] father whether he'll fail you or cast
[2:41:44] you away
[2:41:45] your Earthly father May abandon you
[2:41:48] he may have treated you like trash and
[2:41:50] said every kind of negative thing about
[2:41:52] you maybe you've lived under that lie
[2:41:55] but don't believe it no more you've got
[2:41:58] a new father
[2:41:59] and here is his words they're exceeding
[2:42:02] great and precious promises
[2:42:04] he'll be a father to the fatherless
[2:42:06] he'll be a lover to those who need love
[2:42:10] he'll give Grace and strength to the
[2:42:12] weary he's there for you he cares for
[2:42:15] you
[2:42:16] but you've got to care enough to receive
[2:42:19] his care
[2:42:20] I want you to Bow your heads with me
[2:42:22] just for a moment
[2:42:25] and I want you to separate from your
[2:42:28] your feelings from your faith
[2:42:30] you may not feel like a conqueror you
[2:42:33] may not feel well
[2:42:35] you may not feel Worthy
[2:42:37] but I want you to separate right now
[2:42:39] your feelings
[2:42:41] from your faith
[2:42:43] and I want you to accept what he's
[2:42:45] offered to you freely
[2:42:50] and I want you to say God
[2:42:53] I've been too negative
[2:42:56] Lord I have an expected blessings
[2:42:59] I didn't feel like I was worthy enough I
[2:43:02] didn't really feel like I was good
[2:43:04] enough and maybe it's for others but
[2:43:06] I'll never get it
[2:43:09] maybe I've had a little bit of an Eeyore
[2:43:11] attitude and oh nothing Good's ever
[2:43:14] going to happen to me and everything bad
[2:43:16] always happens to me
[2:43:18] I want you to start looking that your
[2:43:20] future is going to be better than your
[2:43:22] past
[2:43:25] that your past failures
[2:43:28] that from this day on you're going to
[2:43:29] walk in Victory
[2:43:31] that you're going to go from Victory to

[2:43:37] your life I'm prophesying over you now
