much we appreciate you the things you've done in our lives how great you every time we've had need of you you've been there for us lord standing with us lord touching our hearts and lifting us up lord in moments of trials and temptations god what a mighty god you are we just asked lord you'd come tonight and meet the needs tonight father meet it in a way only you can meet him lord lord a man's way of meeting needs many times is just temporary but lord you can meet a need for eternity lord we just ask father that you would continue to walk in our midst you know those are around us lord they're watching in the needs in their hearts father those that are sick lord god may you be merciful i pray we commit this time in your hands in jesus name amen amen turn to hebrews chapter 13 if you would and also exodus 17 amen it's good to be in the house of the lord amen it's good to be home amen always good to be home we had a wonderful time while we were away at brother ray erickson's assembly that put on the they call it i guess the true word tabernacle camp and it was their first year uh to have youth camp but really you wouldn't have been able to tell it it was such a well-run camp and and my just the atmosphere that was created was a wonderful place to be and uh i wish you could have been there amen i wished all of us could have been there but uh you know we got to experience the other side of things most of the time we experience buses coming in and people coming in and and we got to experience that part of it traveling there and and ministering at a camp and our young people you know maybe being in dorms without their favorite people and and we definitely found out one thing there's worse food than louisiana youth cat i'll just say that but so we're blessed people amen but uh you know it was a wonderful time in the lord but andrew spencer uh ministered there with me and us together and the lord just moved in some tremendous ways and we're just thankful for that because you know without him this it means nothing all the miles and all the money and all the everything it means absolutely nothing if he doesn't come by but when he does it means everything because he does he has eternal benefits and and there's eternal things that have been done and i know our young people i've listened to a lot of the testimonies that were sent to me and and things and god you know what what a what a testimony would make you do it'll make you real happy that the lord would reach down and touch and change lives and that's a wonderful thing it also makes you real mad at the devil because of house what a slime ball he is what he would do to our girls and to our boys and and what he would tell them and their minds and and and and their dark places that they go through i hate him amen and he hates me but that's all right amen but to know that in the middle of all that god can come and and restore and rewrite and make it as though you've never done it in the first place my whatever awesome god we serve so we would definitely love to thank brother nathan erickson and brother ronnie long and brother ray and for the wayne lawson all the ones that was there we know what it's like to put a camp like that on and and it doesn't go without sacrifice and we sure thank them for what they've done to make it available for our youth because this church will reap the benefits of that meeting your homes will reap the benefits of that meeting amen so we're thankful for that hebrews 13 and verse 8 jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever exodus 17 and verse 5 and the lord said unto moses go on before the people and take with thee of the elders of israel and thy rod wherewith thus modest the river take in thine hand and go and behold i will stand before thee there upon the rock of horeb and thou shalt smite the rock and there shall come water out of it that the people may bring may drink and moses did so in the sight of the elders of israel amen will let you be seated last time i spoke on this thought of jesus christ the same spoke on the living bread tonight i'd like to speak to you on the living water amen the living water you know we know that israel has always been a historical example of the church because they're natural israel and we're spiritual israel because israel was a people that of god until they came out of egypt and brother brown said when they came out of egypt there was not just the people of god there was the church of god because they were separated from the rest of the world and he said when we are separated from the rest of the world then we become the church but as long as we are entangled with the rest of the world we are not in the church now we might be in the church but we're not in the church because if our heart is in the things of the world and the love of you know the love of the world and the things of the world then the love of god is not even in us as the bible would say amen so it takes a separation amen to become the church or the bride of jesus christ but as long as our our our foot is you know maybe one foot in the church or one foot in the world we're not in the church you know we're we're maybe a part of a certain lifestyle or a part no different than maybe the baptists or even the mennonites or something like that amen because we have have desires in our life that are still there amen and i'm not talking about temptations i'm talking about desires amen temptations is something different in many ways because the devil will come and he'll tempt you but that don't mean that's what you desire to do amen because when there's desires there says there's a longing there's a lust there's a want for the things of the world more than the things of god but we know as a people of god we have to separate ourselves come out from among those that are unclean deal not with them be not partakers of their sin yoke not up with the unbelievers but separate yourself from the things of the world and when israel was in egypt they were the people of god but when they was called out or had an exodus of coming out then they were called the church because they had separated themselves unto god from the rest of the world and you know the very word church means they're called out amen the exodus means to come out amen each one of us as christians has had an exodus in our life we've had a time where we're called out from amongst our associates we're called out from the people that we once fellowship with and became a different people or peculiar people to walk as a different people act in a different way walk a different walk talk a different way it was the exodus of our life every one of us has had to have that young people you're not by yourself when you come to the lord and you realize there's things that's been in your life you got to live by leave behind you must leave behind you must cut it completely off as as joshua would say as they entered it even into the uh the promised land he said get you a sharp knife and let's have a circumcision let's cut off the things of the world let's cut off everything and i i believe there's if there's ever a perfect time for young people right now to do that is right now it's time that you look in your life and you begin to look at it and judge it not according to your desires or your wants or or your thoughts but according to the word of god and anything that is not of the word of god cut it off amen because if you're not careful that thing will lay there and it may seem very innocent but it'll begin to get bigger and bigger and bigger until it pulls you right back in now we've seen that happen in the children of israel that left amen the the egyptians and he left egypt and and they get on our you know in some difficult times and they begin to look back at what they left they begin to you know lust after the pots the the garlic of egypt and the things of egypt why because their heart never left egypt their body may have left egypt but their heart didn't leave egypt so we want a complete separation from the things of the world amen a complete separation and sometimes you got to delete phone numbers sometimes you got to get a whole different phone number amen sometimes you got to just completely cut yourself away because that's not who you are that's not where you're going to be that's not where you're going back to i'm going on with jesus and i i know there's many here tonight that made that declaration in this weekend of meetings we have had amen you've made a declaration i'm going on with him i'm leaving that old past behind amen well if you're going to do that i say it do it with your whole heart amen put both feet into the word of god and your heart unto the word of god and everything have an exodus in your life if you're ever going to have an exodus out of this body into a new body you got to have an exodus out of the world into a new life amen so the you know israel gave us that example when god called them out they had an exodus they had a coming out among the people of the world to become a separated nation of peculiar people they they walk it they began to walk under the shadows of the mercy seat they lived and began to walk by the pillar of fire god brought them from egypt to the land that he had promised by the pillar of fire hallelujah what what what a what a an honor to be identified as a people who are led by the pillar of fire not led by our emotions not led by our desires not led by our humanity not led by our thoughts and our thinking but led by the pillar of fire now it ain't just a pastor that's to be led by a pillar of fire or a deacon board or trustee board or a church it's individuals young and old say god i want to be led i don't want to be led by my passions i don't want to be led no more by what i want or my desires or my humanity i want to be led by the pillar of fire i want to be led by the holy ghost in my life and in making the decisions and i'm yielding myself and saying god not my will but thy will be done this is an exodus and they were given a spiritual leader it was moses he was an anointed man for the hour a great man a great prophet of god he had been called from his mother even before the time he was born a prophecy had laid there god ordained him before the foundation of the world to be a leader to that generation to bring this exodus to a people and amram began to seek after the lord and in the moment of the prophecy begin to come to be fulfilled and and the angel began to spoke and spoke to amram and told him what was about to take place and little moses was born and they you know they feared not the commandments of the king or his threats they knew that god had his hand on moses and that settled it no matter what the king said what the political world said what everything else said they knew god has his hand on moses so they wasn't scared to turn him loose in the midst of the crocodiles they amen they wasn't scared of that yet moses was put right in a little ark set right among the crocodiles sent right down the river because they didn't fear that they knew god had his hand on moses oh hallelujah well now if we could just know the same thing that our great leader the holy spirit god has sent him and he's our leader he's our leader it's not a man that's leading it's the holy spirit that's leading it's men that have said have come under the unction and the the power of the holy ghost and no matter what the world says no matter how much they want to laugh at us they want to make fun of us we're following our leader amen no matter what they say we're following the holy ghost no matter how much they make fun of us we're following the pillar of fire no matter how much they want to call us a bunch of holy rollers and fanatics we're following the pillar of fire and where it leads i'm going to go we must follow him he's been sent to us to lead us and guide us he said a little worthwhile and the world will see you not me no more but you shall see me for i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world oh hallelujah to think about that we're privileged people because there's a whole a whole millions and maybe even billions of people that can't even see him many of them even deny his own existence but even those that that even say there is a god many of them cannot see the pillar of fire that's leading the church [Music] listen it wasn't just moses with a rod and maybe that's all the egyptians saw and they was looking out their windows that morning and peeping out their curtains after the death angel had passed and they got brave enough to come out and they saw amen these millions of jews or israelites come walking out and moses in front with a rod but what they failed to see it wasn't just a rod it wasn't just moses it wasn't just a bunch of people it was our amber light that was burning it was a pillar of fire that was leading them and people are not careful all they see in our services and maybe it's a song and somebody gives a dance or or this goes on and this word goes forth and they think it's just a bunch of this or that amen but listen it's more than that what they fail to see is the amber light the spirit of god that is moving among us when a fellow receives christ as a savior let me let me back up for a minute sorry so we must follow this leader do what he says this leader will never take us off the path he will keep us right on the path of the scriptures at all times but he'll never go to one side for something or this side for something he'll say right straight on the road of the scriptures oh i love that on the road to the scriptures you know but could you imagine the joy that was in the camp as they would walk out of egypt and they would begin to make their journey towards the promised land to shout and things that were going on he said it's just like when a fellow receives christ as a savior everything is on the housetop but before this man can come into the baptism the holy spirit this person he must go through a sanctifying process and it's a testing time and things are done and chastisements and and all this is going on he's wondering what's happening and he says all but all things are working together for the good of them that love the lord then we're sons and daughters of god but then after all of that he comes and seals us with the holy spirit until the day of our redemption he said but when they were down in egypt god sent moses he stretched forth a rod and flies and lice and things come forth and he showed it all the way and while they were there things were taking place in egypt but over in goshen nothing was going on it was sunshine there was no clouds no flag struck them it was a glorious time he said just like you did when you first got saved oh everything the birds sang different everybody was sweet nobody was out to get you everybody loved everybody but then the trying time comes all of a sudden the car breaks down and dishwasher quits ain't talking about your wife i'm talking about the dishwasher the dishwasher quits everything was just going dandy when you first got saved and things were happening what's going on he says sanctifying time it's a time god is making you to lay aside the weights that so easily beset you he said you a man had to stop you smoking stop your drinking stop going to the pool rooms and your all-night car parties and those things had to sanctify yourself now that might not be what you're dealing with it might be social media in this day we're living in and things that have been distracting you and and and the things that's been going on you he said you're women that let your hair grow out lengthen your dress act like you're different than you was sanctifying times so many will go through that process and rebel and say i don't want to go no further but not a child of god a child of god when he starts he looks straight at calvary because he knows this is for my good [Applause] hey i don't understand you know as a young man you looked at your daddy when he pulled out that belt or that whooped off that switch off a tree and he began to whoop your hive for something you've done he's telling you it's for your good and you're trying to figure out how in the world and stripes on my back and a belt against my bottom and stinging going on for my good but it was for your good it showed you that was the wrong thing to do that was not where you're supposed to be that was not who you're supposed to where you're supposed to go amen this is exactly the chastisement of god come in our lives is for our good everything he does is for our good every situation that happens he allows to take place is for our good but you know in the process of time in israel when there's great crowding in time when the people begin to fall away then in their chatting well we wish you were back down in egypt our souls loathe us this light bread he said in other words in the modern day time it would be like this oh every wednesday night we got a prayer meeting we got service every sunday morning back to church what did we hear the same thing the preacher stands up and preached songs go back says see you're just going in as a line of duty he said you need to come as a worshiper a worshiper goes in there to worship to express himself before his god to praise god for his goodness to every word he hangs on to it just like a love affair you know if you was to go with a girl because you knew it was a duty or your mama wanted you to go with this certain guy wanted you to go with a certain boy you know you didn't get nothing you didn't feel the feeling you feel around certain people you know you know they want you to go with somebody i'm going to try not to use no examples mercy but you got you know you got this maybe a certain mom got her eye on a certain boy for a dollar and said what do you think about this one yeah no but for mama's sake you try it you know yeah but you know what he he just does dumb stuff he just says the dumbest jokes and it don't do nothing for you there's no connection there you of course when you go back the other way i mean the boy tries to do it rather out of his father's or her mother's desire and and you know you know i see her she don't ever have her hair fixed she just don't have that sparkle in her eye she just don't have you know that that's not he said see it bores you he said why because it's not a love affair he said but if love is there you don't care what it is how it is what's taking place you want to be with him and he said it's the same way with god you won't say why does he preach so long oh hallelujah you know your parents were laughing at your kids and i just smoked their hides why does he preach so long why what about all this stuff and everything see the problem is you're not in love when you really hang on to every word because it's a living water i gotta have a drink [Applause] hanging onto every word and by the way all that was a direct quote i can give it to you of church that might be what he's been talking to you about hanging on it's eternal life every word of god he said it's a joy to go to church under any circumstance whoa hallelujah whether it's hot cold and different whether people are fussing growling whatever they're doing it's a joy to hear the word of the lord then when you know you're in that place you know you're in love with christ you love to go to church wow i feel like there's a few streaming things just clicked off he said well honey here's sunday morning again i guess we have to wash up the young ones and get down there mine's boresome so you're not in love but if you're in love you can't wait till sunday morning comes you just get got to get down there with them people of god because they don't bore you they are your brothers and your sisters he said that's the way israel was supposed to be but it had become a burdensome thing to them this old light bread it was angel's bread it was the creative power of god they were eating what do we care about this light bread our souls loathe to this stuff everything's wrong there's no man that falls out every night we rather have garlic leak out of egypt hey man if they would if they had facebook it had been all over facebook i'm gonna just be honest with y'all y'all have a dangerous preacher up here tonight amen you see their hearts wasn't ready for the journey hello somebody their hearts wasn't ready for the journey so when a man or a woman begins to complain about going to church they get so tired of going to church they're not ready for the journey there's something wrong somewhere israel in her testing time she got to quarreling and fussing with one another loathing over the bread and they wanted to go back to egypt and they began to complain about their leader they was afraid he was leading them the wrong direction he showed himself already over and over he was the leader god had proved it but well maybe we're just acting a little bit fanatically maybe we've started off on the wrong foot see there was chatting against god and against moses god and his leader listen when you unders i want you to understand sometimes when you speak about a man who's delivering his heart and it may go a little long but you're not chatting against just the man you're chatting against the leader as well amen so we've got to get to a place i don't know whether the word means this or that i don't know about the holy spirit that said we come to this place i'm a little skeptic i don't know about what others are doing well go on back to egypt going back to egypt but if you're really determined to stay on the road of the scriptures stay with the pillar of fire stay with the holy spirit stay with the word of god it'll keep you all the way hallelujah and don't be afraid of it too many people are afraid of the holy ghost matter of fact but really what they're afraid of is how they're going to react in the presence of the holy ghost he said it won't hurt nothing it'll just help you if you are hurt mercy i i i was listening to this sermon on on the mower the day that the day that my mom had passed away he said it won't hurt you he said oh help you if you are hurt it'll heal all the hurts the holy spirit will oh god let the holy spirit heal our hurts maybe you've been holding grudges and stuff in your heart against somebody right now you ought to say lord let the holy spirit come over my life let me let all that stuff go because you can't carry that where we're going it'll take you back to egypt you cannot take the burdensome of bitterness and and anxieties and fears like that and things that you've held on from through family generation you can't take that with you where we're going but they found themselves in horeb it was a dry place a desert and the driest of places and the worst of it seemed like impossibilities it was going to be a place to find water he said see when we get out of fellowship with one another in church and out of fellowship with the holy spirit it brings us to dry places that's why it's important to come to church he said because you get out in the desert nothing's alive everything's got stickers how many's ever been in the desert it seemed like everything in the desert to hurt you you got stickers of every kind on you you don't even have to touch them and they'll touch you jump right on you amen that sounds like some people i know been in the desert too long he said but see what that was that was a precious little tender leaf but it hadn't had no water so with no water it becomes a dried up hardness around it until it's so tight it becomes a sticker and when you see somebody like that maybe it's a precious soul that if they could get some water it'd be tender again but instead of that it wound itself up to it's a sticker and starts punching at everything finding fault with everything but the only thing it needs is just water it just needs a revival a breaking up a refreshing from the lord and it'll unfold its little self if you'll just put it in the water and that's where them all that live in that place has to suffer in the conditions of that place and those who desire to live in that kind of atmosphere where everything's just punching and fussing and quarreling and stewing you'll just live under that atmosphere that's all we don't have to live but you don't have to live there and it's definitely not necessary to stay there this horub was a place where god was discouraged with people because they had wandered they'd moved around went the wrong way and bickering and fighting and fussing and moaning and groaning he brings them to this place he says brother brandon said it would be a beautiful lesson for us he said because we can get so out of cater and so world bound and it will cause god to take the judgments of the world and to smite his own son with it at calvary that we might go free now in order for them people to get some water after they got over there it was this dry place was made of calvary and there god told moses they said take a rod go up there and stop standing with you on the rock and this rock was christ and moses with that rod when he brought the judgment upon the nation of israel took the same rod and smote the judgments of god upon the rock he took the sins of the people onto this rod which should have smote the people but instead of smiting the people he smoked the rock oh hallelujah and the rock through a work of god brought salvation to a perishing people that was dying without water and that's what god did when he took his wand of judgment and he wound up my sins and your sins and he wound him around his rod and he struck christ and from him might come forth waters which means his spirit the holy ghost might be released from his body that we could have life dried and stagnated and hardened there was some of you that were so hardened in your life you thought there'd be no way you'd ever live for god but god didn't take the rod and smite you he took the rod and smote the rock so that waters could come trickling down in the and over into texas and up in arkansas and down in louisiana the holy spirit trickling into homes and places amen to where you thought there ain't no hope for me ain't no way i could ever make it but god didn't smite you he smoked the rock and out of it came the spirit of god and it began to woo over your life and here you're in this hardened condition and little droplets began to fall on you and god began to minister moisture into your life to where you could open up and you could become exactly what god wanted you to be in the first place hallelujah from the waters of life brother randall said i've seen so many intellectual drawings listen to intellectual drawings so one of the most critical ones i ever seen was this little rock laying on top of a hillside and moses was supposed to have smitten and israel was down there with a tea cup getting a drink out of a little sprinkle that fell down from this rock he said now that's just somebody's idea but when this rock broke forth its waters there was over 2 million people besides ox camels and everything else that drank in the tubs of water that come from it it was a gushing stream it was showing it was signifying something his holy spirit is not just a little sprinkle here and a sprinkle there and a sprinkle here it's a gusher it's a moving of the holy ghost it's a it's a mighty flowing river listen you might can't stand still under a sprinkle but you're getting a flowing river you can't stand you can't stand against it it'll move you it'll touch you it'll do things to you amen it'll it'll uh it'll do things in your life amen why because it's a moving stream of life it'll make you act in ways you never thought you would act it'd make you shout it'll make you dance it'll make you speak in tongues because it's not just a little sprinkle on the top of your head it's a gusher of the holy ghost it's god moving through his people and changing lives forever listen you don't have to come to church with a teacup and just worry about you're gonna get something tonight god's got something for you every service he got something for you every day he got something all you got to do is say god i want another drink i want more of you [Applause] amen and he's never going to run out that's the way they try to make christ the holy spirit just a little sprinkle just enough to make you believe there's a god but it's an abundance of water my cup runneth over it's a gusher of the holy spirit but people are afraid of it now listen what he says he said well i'm a little afraid i'll do this or that or if i happen to go a little too deep i can show you someone that went too far he said true but you'll never but you never point to one that didn't go far enough how about the just about you only want to point to those that go far too far but why don't you just look at those that don't go far enough he said we've had some people that got into the flesh and got on the wrong foot because of that because of not good leadership and so forth they continued on that foot and they went into fanaticism he said then the whole world the devil points to them and says see that see that fanaticism he said let me stand this morning and point back to the tens of million times more than that never even made a start oh my goodness you know that's what they want to do at our youth camps they want to point to fanaticism and when they don't they come back and they don't do this and they don't they don't know they're so confused well they don't point to any and their meetings that don't even make a start criticizing and making fun and carrying on i don't have time for it because i'm not going to look at those that don't take make a start i'm going to look at those as making a start and going on with jesus sure they may get off on the wrong foot but what was it that started them down that path it was a movement of the holy ghost people want to you know they want to clamp down on our services and and they up in that area especially want to clamp down on worship and clamp down and and things of of the holy ghost and say it ain't soul or you can have your sprinkle i'll take the gusher you can have what you want all you want but i'm going to have all i want if that's as far as you want to go fine i'm happy for you i wish you'd go further but i'm going on with jesus amen he said some people has upon their hearts and mind that all israel drank and they packed up their camels and tied their hitches on their horses and so forth and took their kids and journeyed on somewhere else and left the rock there wrong the rock followed them the water followed them oh my goodness oh listen young people you ain't got to worry about that you left that rock up there in ohio amen you that's here tonight you ain't got to worry about it the rock was here sunday no it's there where they're with you every day amen it ain't you following the rock the rock is following you oh he said what a beautiful type the beautiful hole and the anchor for the believer that knows that that rock that was once smitten that water that once poured from calvary goes with us wherever we are it's not go back to a certain place or go to a certain camp i'll say or to a certain church but he's with you wherever you go we did have water day before yesterday we got water right today because the rock is christ and he's the same yesterday today and forever that rock followed israel they never followed the rock the rock followed them israel would go on their journey and have one thing to do keep a straight course go to the promised land the rock was following them and the water was in the rock was with them god took the judgments and placed them on christ did you notice there was a cleft in the rock from then on a scar in his side the rock that it had clefts where moses smoted christ had a cleft he was wounded for our trans christian and by his stripes were healed and from that life comes waters of life that we so enjoy today he said the life of christ stays with the church christ does not leave the church i'll be with you always even to the end of the world i'll never leave you forsake you it's the people that leaves christ not christ leaving the church because the bible plainly says the rock and water followed israel the same god that goes with this church this morning let's drink from this fountain wherever you make a footstep god will be right there the rock will be right with you the water that gives you the life is still there i'll be with you even at the end of the age he said people in the testing times drop away like israel did they think god's left them but the rock never left israel israel left the rock so if you find yourself without god and go back to where you left him it was right there went right with them to the end of the road it followed them and i love this part i shouted on my lawnmower it was never out of speaking distance it wasn't out of here in distance and it wasn't out of sea and distance and neither is christ with the church today he is never i say never out of speaking distance whenever you have need of water from the rock say god i want another drink hey you know how to cure a hangover take another drink hey man you know how to go you just get drunk all over again that's what a good drunk does amen why because we're not even worried about whoever makes the beer we're not without him on that because they're going to run out one of these days and it's going to burn in hell but we have an inexhaustible fountain of life take another drink he said well brother timothy i i feel a little down since they got off the bus take another drink i ain't talking about drinking facebook and instagram and whatever you've been drinking on before it's time to kick them drinks to the curb put them out and let the trashman take them or let a fire burn them and drink from the everlasting waters i love this he said some of you have backslid some of you've done things wrong you've lost the joy and your water's dried up he's still in speaking distance of you he follows you he knows every move you make he's longing to hear you call on him god is waiting for you to call on him you're never out of speaking distance though we've done wrong we've sinned we've turned our backs we've done things we ought not to do yet he's still with us man that ought to shut that devil's mouth up when he tells you god's left you god cannot leave you because his word says he won't matter of fact his word says i'm following you surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life amen he's not just with you at a camp he's not just with you in a church service he's with you every day of your life he's with you in your dark places he's with you in the hallways he's with you in your bedroom he's with you no matter where you may go tell the devil to shut up my god is with me he's following me he's walking with me and when i have a need all i got to say is god i have a need and take another drink hallelujah that is alive and devil god has never left you alone in your bedroom god has never left you alone on your job god has never left you alone anywhere his word says he followed him to a desert place he followed them through hills and valleys and every kind of things he went through he was right there with them mercy when they got thirsty they knew the water was near oh my when you begin to think about the power that has been revealed in this day and the word that has come down in this day and all the things that jesus did and how he worked and how he fulfilled things in his life you think he's going to get down to this place say see you later my power ain't big enough it ain't strong enough it ain't it ain't gonna be a hug i to skip a few things here but israel lost their faith they got off the path to begin to lust after the flesh pots they'd stay with faith believing that god was going to take them to the land there would have been nothing hinder them he had already opened up the seas plagues had fell upon their enemies their enemies was dead laying behind them walking over into the land still couldn't have faith to go onto the promise but joshua and caleb said we're more than able so i told brother ray i said brother ray brother ray erickson he's i believe in his in his 80s you wouldn't know it just a courageous heart a line that has stood against formulism and every kind of spirit of hell that wants to come steal the worship out of churches and the praise of god the shout of the king in the camp has stood sometimes seemingly by himself but stood and i told him i walked up to him at the end of those meetings or sometimes right there maybe in the middle of it wherever and i said brother ray i want to thank you for being a true caleb if i've ever seen one in my life it's you that'll look at all this and say boys we're more than able we're not just able we're more than able we've got to have that heart we've got to look into these things and realize hey the world's getting worse and things are going on and things are crumbling very quickly and it seems like things are getting tighter and tighter and anxiety is getting more and more fear more and more demons on every hand more and more we've still got to look at and say we're more than able because he gave me the faith to stand up out of the muck of this world and put me up on a rock and i know he didn't do all this to leave me i know he didn't do all what he's done to go off somewhere in the wild blue yonder and say have a good time no he's there with us he's fighting every step of the way he's the lord the man of war he's god rich in mercy he's going to reach down to the lowest of places and down in that mario clay where that last seed is he's ready to reach down and grab it out and say children it's time to go home amen we got to be ready because that rock is walking with us and we're going to continue to drink from the rock of eternal life and it's going to continue to work in our bodies until we take every inheritance that god has given the church of the living god and there's got to be men that'll say we're more than able [Applause] back off terrible you're not coming into this place got to be men that say not we will be we are now sons of daughters of god and the ever-living presence of the holy ghost is with us there's got to be men that'll stand for the holy ghost baptism for the experience to come into a heart to change them brother william he found out brother ray stood for that amen he looked over at him and said i feel to go over there and tell him he didn't really know who he was at the time brother ray hadn't been up on the front you know his grandson is running the camp and things pretty much and other ministers he's in the back so not everybody would know who he was and he's come to the front and praying for the needs on a friday night brother william feels it to my heart i need to go to him and say i need the holy ghost he found out that man believed in the holy ghost he lived he believed in the experience that it took to receive it he believed amen just as brother brandon would talk about the smiting of that rock was a a symbol of or or significant to the holy spirit coming out of him and coming on the day of pentecost and he said we don't have to smite it again the first time it was smith it'll work every time amen but you just got to go back and take original drink of the original power and i don't mean go back as to go back 2 000 years ago i mean go back to that same source that they went to when that holy ghost come out of him on calvary came back on the church on the day of pentecost the same holy ghost is present this morning it's that rock followed the church all the way down through the church ages amen it went all the way down it give us a promise that's a reason walking before the sick people when he commissioned me yonder i believed it god said so that's how visions have happened god promised it god cannot lie believe it you got to believe it god got to be something there to open that damper to open that thing to let you in on it what we need today is not pray for more power he said you got enough power to make a new earth what we need is faith to use that power what you need is to control that life and live such a godly life that when you ask god anything you know he'll bring it to pass we have confidence of god of that we know if we keep his commandments he will withhold no good thing from us if we walk with him and god is walking with us stay the course they had they had the pillar of fire to keep the core stay with the pillar of fire stay with it we stay with the word and the word will produce the signs jesus said these signs shall follow them that belief they wandered off israel wandered off wandered off the path and they lost their water supply and he said i wonder if that ain't what the church has done today they wandered off the path and they've lost they go into isms and they've adopted things and they adopted apostle creeds and where do you find that in the bible they adopted catechisms and adopted denominations instead of an experience they adopted shaken hands instead of a born-again experience they adopted sprinkling instead of water baptism they opted they adopted an evil form father son and holy ghost when there's no such a thing as the bible it's in the name of jesus christ there's one thing to do if you want the same water come back to the same path and get back on it he ain't left he's still there but we'll take creeds instead of christ we don't want it you know they don't want tongues they won't they don't want shouting spells they don't want none of that but it's in there they want some dried eye confession organized a little bit but they lose their water that's exactly what pentecost did they begin to organize they begin to break up fellowship we can't fellowship with you because you don't sing the same songs we say you don't believe the same thing we believe and they begin to cut off fellowship but they've lost their water i'll just say it somebody said why i don't think i've ever seen two ministers stand so hard against formalism and starchness and and stand so strong for worship than we have in this last weekend a meeting somebody was telling brother wayne he said well he said do you not know where you're at he said these men got poked in their eye by that nonsense they was ready to fight i had a young man come running to me at the end of the service he said i was one of them exactly what you were talking about where i thought i had it all figured out and we was taking this song out and we was taking that song out we was taking this out he said i didn't realize how bad a shape i was in until god come down in a moment and supernaturally delivered me and he said i want to be a voice to you brother timothy that says thank you thank you for preaching this he said even though i've been delivered by such a supernatural visitation he said that spirit still tries to come back and he says try to come into every church around here and try to push its way in he says stand with against it with all your heart he said because i'm one of them that's set free he knew what it was like to be thirsty [Applause] he knew what it was like to not have water and once he got a drink of it oh hallelujah some of you also you know what it was like out in the world you try to quench your thirst with every kind of thing out there we can name a whole bunch of stuff but when you found this water you found something that could quench the most inward desire of your heart this is what i've been longing for this is what i've been wanting this is what i've been desiring i've been looking for this and it changed everything and you spoke and you said this is that this is my heart's desire this is what i wanted and i said god i want another tree christ was smitten once he said that's that original experience that's that original way on the day of pentecost repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of jesus christ he said there is no other way musicians can come he said every man in the bible was baptized in the name of jesus christ every man in the bible that's got the holy ghost come god's way exactly the same thing they had the same experience the same signs following them the same works followed them they lived by the rock they got the same water mercy so much stuff here but you have been put in an inexhaustible fountain of life you don't ever have to worry about him running out of water you don't have to ever worry about him running out of refreshing from the presence of god you don't have to have to take it easy on service because you're afraid it may not be there nick no drink drink here's what brother brown will talk about the inexhaustible he said when you plant a tree in the ground the only thing he has to do is drink and when it goes to drinking it has to drink more than its portion and it begins to drink and drink and drink you know it is when you plant them you gotta water them like crazy keep watering it some of your new christians started on a new path keep watering it keep drinking listen to sermons listen read your bible pray fellowship together around goodly things godly things keep drinking the more you drink the more it pushes out is that's the way we are we're planted in christ jesus through the inexhaustible fountain of life and we start drinking the more we drink the more you'll push out it'll bring out all the elements of christ and all the elements that's in that tree that ever was in you is already in you the gift that god has called you to the trouble of his you won't drink don't you believe he's in the entire inexhaustible fountain of life come to me all ye into the world and drink the devil don't care how much you count as long as you don't drink it could care less how many times you walk into this door if you're not drinking [Music] if you're not feeding on the word he could care less there's a fountain open flowing freely just drink till you can't drink no more i've seen what it'll do to somebody that really gets a drink we go to another one he says could you imagine talking about the inexhaustible god and exhausting god's love talking about exhausting god's love and power and beneficiaries could you imagine a little bitty fish out in the middle of oceans out now wait a minute i better consider something here about to drink this water sparingly because i might run out a little fish in the middle of a big ocean he said that could easily more easily be done than you can ask too much of god he's the inexhaustible fountain of life whatever you have need of ask him and believe it he provided in the redemptive blessings when he died at calvary and gave a promise to you for everything you ever need have need of between here and in the journey it's yours if you'll ask could you imagine a little mouse saying well i can only eat so many grains a day because i'm going to run out and he's in the great gardens of egypt he said that's the way people act as christians get up morning eat a little grain god bless my family keep us close amen i've ate my grain i've done my religion for the day you're afraid of running out he said i like to lay down and drink a while he said just have a real spiritual gastronomical jubilee just drink till you just can't drink no more he said why don't you do that tonight why don't you open up your life and say father i want to take another drink say well i've been drinking all weekend well take another drink i took one just a few moments ago god poured out it take another drink there's one feeling many refillings many outpourings let's just open up our hearts i want to just open you up your hearts and just talk to them for a moment say lord i need another drink i need another drink lord i i want to drink from that inexhaustible fountain of life yes lord open up yourself say lord i remember the day you saved me i remember what you done for me i wouldn't mind drinking so much so i got back to that moment that feeling of how you moved through me lord and how you touched me how you lifted me up out of that myri clay you

wilderness he's here for you it's time some of you young people go home and throw your water pots away with the woman at the well she thought that was everything important was a water pot but when he gave her that drink she left that water pot she left it behind said come see come see a man who's told me all things you know there was a presence in that meeting that told you things that wasn't
