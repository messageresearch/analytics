[17:18] time also have a prayer request for
[17:20] brother Jonathan Middleton

[17:25] brother Joel C
[17:27] he's uh brother Danny steaman's

[18:13] we want to believe for these needs amen

[18:29] take these knees before the Lord just
[18:31] remember this coming week he's going to
[18:33] make a few announcements about it but we
[18:35] have the the Ohio camp coming up me and
[18:38] sister Ruth are actually flying out
[18:39] today this evening so that's the Lord
[18:42] for traveling mercies but also for his
[18:45] mind we need his mind because you know
[18:48] Satan is putting out his mind out onto
[18:51] the world and so to battle that we have
[18:53] to have the mind of Christ and so we
[18:55] want the mind of Christ to come and take
[18:58] over the meetings and and the right
[19:00] words to be said because our young
[19:02] people need victories and we're looking
[19:04] for great victories and and I say our
[19:07] young people yes the young people at
[19:08] this church but young people all over
[19:10] the world and so we just asked God to
[19:13] come brother Ron Spencer brother Andrew
[19:15] Spencer will be there as well so just be
[19:18] remember those meetings starts Thursday
[19:20] beginning through Sunday morning if you
[19:23] remember those in prayer we'd appreciate
[19:24] it
[19:25] foreign
[19:28] as we go to the Ohio camp we just we
[19:32] want to ask the whole church that you
[19:35] would just bind together and and prayer
[19:37] and be remembering the the youth that
[19:39] are coming like brother Timothy said our
[19:40] youth but the Youth of the message but
[19:43] specifically you know your child and you
[19:45] know the young people of this church and
[19:47] you know each night Thursday and Friday
[19:49] and Saturday if it comes on your heart
[19:51] just go to prayer for the meetings go to
[19:53] prayer for the the ministry that you
[19:55] know we don't put all our hope and in
[19:57] youth camps and things like that
[19:58] everything we need we can get today we
[20:00] understand that we're not trying to put
[20:02] off but but when the effort goes in and
[20:04] and the young people they come with
[20:07] expectations
[20:08] and they make the effort to go to the to
[20:10] these camps and we just ask that you'd
[20:12] bind together in prayer and remember but
[20:15] I do want to uh just instruct the youth
[20:17] and that are going to Ohio in the next
[20:19] day in the coming days leading up to
[20:21] Wednesday to be checking the youth uh
[20:24] page frequently for announcements and
[20:26] directions the main thing you need to

[52:43] be appreciative amen God bless you thank
[52:46] you let's turn to Romans chapter 9 and
[52:49] verse 27 we got a wonderful day ahead
[52:53] for us where we're going to be having
[52:55] our our time of of um the word this
[53:00] morning and then then the the communion
[53:04] and the the foot washing that we will
[53:06] have and we will then have our
[53:08] fellowship meal together or we can just
[53:11] Fellowship together so it's just going
[53:13] to be a great time in the Lord and
[53:16] um so let's turn to Romans chapter 9
[53:19] verse 27
[53:21] Isaiah's also cried concerning Israel
[53:25] though the number of the children of
[53:27] Israel be as the sand of the sea
[53:30] a Remnant shall be saved
[53:33] for he will finish the work and cut it
[53:36] short in righteousness because a short
[53:40] work will the Lord make upon the Earth
[53:43] and as Isaiah said before except the
[53:47] Lord of this sabbath hath left to
[53:51] succeed we have been as sodama and been
[53:56] made like unto Gomorrah amen may God
[53:59] bless you can be seated
[54:01] got a little thought this morning that I
[54:04] want to
[54:05] press upon your hearts today of
[54:07] possessing the land of promise
[54:11] and so we're going to be looking at that
[54:14] as I believe that we're a people
[54:16] in one of the greatest ages that there's
[54:18] ever been
[54:20] and it's a it's the age of the Rapture
[54:23] where we transcend dimensions and go
[54:26] into the Realms of the Supernatural and
[54:29] so to do that we of course have to be a
[54:31] supernatural people a super race as we
[54:35] near him and of course as brother
[54:38] Branham told us in how can I overcome he
[54:41] he talked about how the Realms are
[54:44] already blending and he said we see this
[54:47] age that we live in it's one of the
[54:50] grandest ages of all ages this laodicean
[54:54] church AIDS is the grandest of all the
[54:56] church ages because it is the ending of
[54:59] time and the blending of Eternity
[55:03] and then it's the greatest sinful age
[55:05] it's more sin in this age than there was
[55:08] has ever been and the powers of Satan is
[55:11] many times harder to fight than it was
[55:14] in any other in any AIDS here so you see
[55:18] it's a time where the blending of times
[55:21] or the blending of Realms where the
[55:24] creatures of time enter into eternity
[55:28] and then it that calls of course for a
[55:32] supernatural people a people who have
[55:35] more than the mechanics more than the
[55:38] Theology of the word in right Doctrine
[55:40] but also the Dynamics certainly the the
[55:44] mechanics must be in order that's true
[55:47] you know the the the truths of the word
[55:50] had to be restored and the correct
[55:52] doctrines put in place and there is
[55:55] certainly in a great importance that we
[55:58] place upon that because we must be
[56:01] correct on the word of God
[56:03] and so but the mechanics must be in
[56:07] order just like a a rocket just leaving
[56:09] the Earth and enter into Heaven's
[56:11] atmosphere that without the mechanical
[56:14] Parts being in order to the rocket
[56:17] itself would never launch
[56:19] but it takes the Dynamics then to come
[56:22] with the mechanics and push it from the
[56:25] Earth's atmosphere into the heavens
[56:28] now the world is in a race in one age we
[56:31] have moved from the snail pace of of
[56:34] horse and buggy and um we have come now
[56:38] to where that mind moves into Realms of
[56:41] outer space propelled by fire and lifted
[56:45] by air and unseen Force man travels
[56:49] Beyond his ability across the the globe
[56:52] and and and then into the other Realms
[56:56] Beyond this this um atmosphere of the
[56:59] earth and it's a natural types of
[57:02] spiritual that we too should also be
[57:05] working in the Supernatural Realm
[57:09] and lifted by the spirit an unseen Force
[57:13] into Realms
[57:15] um Eternal and so we where we will meet
[57:18] Christ in the air you know it will rise
[57:21] to meet him lifted by the holy spirit
[57:23] leaving the Earthbound Realms and and
[57:27] the life of sin and shame and the
[57:29] Troubles of this Earth I'll tell you
[57:32] what it's going to be a wonderful day
[57:33] when it's all over
[57:35] and this of course says we speaking
[57:38] about this land the promise I want you
[57:41] to say that we are a blessed people
[57:44] today
[57:45] because we have returned to the land the
[57:48] promise yet it's not without opposition
[57:51] because this is a populated land like
[57:54] the Israelites found filled with
[57:56] Canaanites and amorites and Hittites and
[57:59] jebusites it was it was already others
[58:02] that had camped down upon there but God
[58:05] had said to them their time was up
[58:08] amen and I want to just say it's the
[58:10] time is up for sin the time is up for
[58:13] the wickedness of this world the time is
[58:16] up for the devil in his Reign we're
[58:20] living in a time where God has declared
[58:22] the iniquity of the Amorite is full amen
[58:25] it's time now you know to lift the bride
[58:28] out of here and take her into her
[58:30] possession and pour out the wraths upon
[58:33] the Earth
[58:34] so we're we're here in a wonderful
[58:36] moment in time we're blessed to be here
[58:39] of all ages now as I said this land
[58:43] promised to us is also inhabited with
[58:47] demon powers to resist us and that must
[58:51] be conquered
[58:53] but we battle against unseen forces of
[58:57] demonic Powers whose job is to keep us
[59:00] from that Heavenly atmosphere of Faith
[59:03] where all things are possible so you see
[59:06] Satan in his army is to is there to beat
[59:09] you down
[59:11] pointing out your human flaws your human
[59:14] failures trying to get you to ignore the
[59:18] real work that is done in your soul he's
[59:21] always haunting you with memories of
[59:23] your past trying to to cower you down
[59:27] where did you you can't possess all that
[59:30] God has called you to be so the devil
[59:33] will do everything he can to try to to
[59:37] destroy you he's a thief he comes to Rob
[59:40] and to kill and destroy and there when
[59:44] he comes there he comes there and he'll
[59:46] point out your human flaws your human
[59:49] weaknesses he'll do everything he can to
[59:52] disqualify you and say you have no right
[59:56] to this land and your position in the
[59:59] land you see the devil he will work
[1:00:01] overtime to do that
[1:00:03] are you with me amen because that's his
[1:00:05] work and so this is the most greatest
[1:00:08] sinful age is more sin in this age than
[1:00:13] that there ever has been and the powers
[1:00:15] of Satan is many times harder to fight
[1:00:18] than it ever was in any other age so you
[1:00:21] see there it is it is a wicked age it's
[1:00:23] a horrible age that we're living in
[1:00:26] demon powers coming against even more
[1:00:28] the Bible said in the Book of Revelation
[1:00:31] that has been released into this
[1:00:33] Dimension to come against us in this day
[1:00:36] and and so you see he is there because
[1:00:39] he does not want you to possess the
[1:00:42] promises of God he wants to keep you see
[1:00:45] you know thinking with a slave mentality
[1:00:48] where that you are still in bondage
[1:00:51] where you you're still having to bow to
[1:00:54] Satan and you still are expecting his
[1:00:56] whips and his beatings and everything
[1:00:59] else but you see I want you to know he's
[1:01:03] there with the opposition but I want you
[1:01:05] to know you've got a job to do because
[1:01:08] there's still a lot more land for you to
[1:01:10] conquer
[1:01:12] and there's still a whole much more you
[1:01:15] got to take back from the enemy that the
[1:01:17] enemy has stolen from you
[1:01:20] you've got to take your inheritance
[1:01:23] amen now what rule what Canaan
[1:01:26] represents
[1:01:28] you see is the Holy Ghost in his
[1:01:30] fullness
[1:01:31] so when we're talking about the lamb the
[1:01:34] promise we're talking about the fullness
[1:01:35] of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:37] so again that's what his fullness means
[1:01:40] or what it means you know Canaan
[1:01:43] represents the Holy Ghost in his
[1:01:45] fullness and I want you to know it's in
[1:01:47] reach of all who wants it
[1:01:52] it's in reach of all who wants it
[1:01:56] now you say fullness brother Tim what do
[1:01:59] you what do you mean I I mean that
[1:02:01] there's still much more to be conquered
[1:02:04] and let me say you know the you know
[1:02:07] there is there's much in this land I
[1:02:09] will we can say oh there's many gifts of
[1:02:12] the Spirit they're speaking of the
[1:02:14] tongues in this land of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:17] but that's only a gift
[1:02:19] and many people will stop there
[1:02:21] amen the ensues of Street movement claim
[1:02:24] to have fully entered into the Holy
[1:02:27] Ghost but they only just barely tapped
[1:02:30] into the anointing
[1:02:34] and I want you to know the whole land
[1:02:36] lays before you
[1:02:38] I want you to know every promise of
[1:02:40] God's word lays in front of you not just
[1:02:43] one or two you don't have to cherry pick
[1:02:46] you can have you you don't have to
[1:02:48] ration it
[1:02:49] hey man you just don't have to take part
[1:02:52] and leave some and take some and leave
[1:02:54] some no you it's all there for you
[1:02:57] I want you to understand you know it's
[1:03:00] there it's unpatter resources
[1:03:03] things that you have not yet experienced
[1:03:06] in God that he wants you to experience
[1:03:09] you know again there's many things in
[1:03:12] that land for example Holiness in our
[1:03:14] behavior and dresses there but many have
[1:03:17] stopped just being sanctified
[1:03:20] and then then you then others will say
[1:03:23] but it's the word but they tell me story
[1:03:28] if the water finished and the seals are
[1:03:30] open and the fullness of the word has
[1:03:33] come and yes and that means every Divine
[1:03:37] promise of God Is Ours
[1:03:40] that's what that means now just as
[1:03:43] Jericho had to be conquered and and its
[1:03:46] walls torn down as they were holding
[1:03:49] back and sealing back the the rest of
[1:03:52] the land do you see the walled off
[1:03:54] mysteries of God had to be restored and
[1:03:59] and and so it had to be broken down the
[1:04:02] seals had to be open the mysteries of
[1:04:05] God had to be revealed in this age but
[1:04:08] that was just to open up the rest of the
[1:04:11] promises
[1:04:12] Jericho is in all that we want to
[1:04:14] conquer
[1:04:16] there's a town of AI there's other towns
[1:04:20] you know that that has to be taken and
[1:04:22] we cannot be just satisfied with knowing
[1:04:25] the Theology of the Mysteries and leave
[1:04:28] of faith and working of Miracles and
[1:04:31] Divine Healing and overcoming power
[1:04:36] you see now when we're talking about
[1:04:39] this
[1:04:40] let's understand what we're possessing
[1:04:42] Israel was going into their Promised
[1:04:45] Land
[1:04:46] and and as they were going into that
[1:04:49] land that land lay before them was
[1:04:52] Canaan and and that they were taking a
[1:04:56] physical land
[1:04:58] but now for us Canaan does not represent
[1:05:01] somewhere in the distant future in the
[1:05:04] millennium
[1:05:05] but it represents the age of the
[1:05:08] overcomer
[1:05:09] now because in Canaan they killed they
[1:05:13] burned cities that you know they
[1:05:16] um they conquered but there's not going
[1:05:18] to be any death in the millennium
[1:05:21] so you see it it isn't that but it
[1:05:23] doesn't but what it is it is it
[1:05:26] represents the Holy Ghost and all the
[1:05:30] spirit of God decrees for the believer
[1:05:34] so every promise of God belongs to you
[1:05:38] now and it's laying before you for the
[1:05:42] taking
[1:05:44] amen whatever it is it's laying before
[1:05:47] you for the taking
[1:05:49] and God wants it possessed
[1:05:53] God has declared go take the lamb
[1:05:58] now
[1:05:59] and of course it shows where the
[1:06:02] churches come like Israel did in the
[1:06:05] same way as a justification by faith
[1:06:08] when they believe Moses and left Egypt
[1:06:11] and then sanctification along the line
[1:06:13] of of the pillar of fire and the
[1:06:15] atonement of the sacrificial lamb in the
[1:06:18] in the wilderness but then entering in
[1:06:21] to the promised land
[1:06:24] and I want you to know now in one sense
[1:06:27] every age has entered into its portion
[1:06:31] but I want you to understand no other
[1:06:35] age has stood where we stand
[1:06:39] we're living in a time to possess it all
[1:06:44] this is where we're at
[1:06:47] amen a time where every promise even the
[1:06:52] rapture
[1:06:53] all the way to the Rapture the change of
[1:06:56] your body is authority to you it lays
[1:06:59] right before you
[1:07:02] now
[1:07:04] so what is what is the New Testament
[1:07:06] what is the land promised to New
[1:07:08] Testament Believers it's the Holy Spirit
[1:07:12] for you said in Joel 28 that they'll
[1:07:14] come to pass in the last day I'll pour
[1:07:16] out my spirit upon All Flesh
[1:07:19] amen your sons and your daughters have
[1:07:21] prophesying on my hands made my man's
[1:07:23] servants my maidservants will I pour out
[1:07:25] my spirit and they shall prophesy also
[1:07:29] wonders in the heavens above and in the
[1:07:32] earth beneath and pillars of fire and
[1:07:33] smoke and vapor and there and Peter
[1:07:36] would would declare this is that
[1:07:39] on the day of Pentecost when he when he
[1:07:42] proclaimed repent every one of you and
[1:07:44] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:07:46] for the remission of sins to take back
[1:07:49] all the trespasses and you shall receive
[1:07:53] the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:07:55] now so there were three stages of this
[1:07:58] journey that Israel was taken
[1:08:01] three stages we're justified by faith
[1:08:04] Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:08:07] forsaken the land of Egypt sin and all
[1:08:10] of it leaving behind us Sanctified to
[1:08:12] the offering of his blood and washed
[1:08:14] from our sins becoming pilgrims and
[1:08:17] sojourners and claiming we're seeking a
[1:08:20] land a city that's coming our promise
[1:08:25] but I want you to know that's still the
[1:08:27] wilderness
[1:08:30] and what if you're there you're just
[1:08:32] still on your journey
[1:08:35] you're headed the right direction you've
[1:08:37] left Egypt you've been justified by
[1:08:40] faith you believed on the Lord Jesus
[1:08:41] Christ you proclaim the message is true
[1:08:44] you set out on a journey but you're not
[1:08:46] there
[1:08:47] the Wilderness was never given to them
[1:08:50] for them to live in
[1:08:53] it was given them to pass through
[1:08:56] and God wants you to pass through
[1:08:58] justification and pass through
[1:09:01] sanctification and enter into the land
[1:09:04] of promise
[1:09:07] now that's what God wants for you he has
[1:09:09] a land prepared and you can't stay in
[1:09:12] the wilderness
[1:09:14] now there may be more wonderful things
[1:09:16] and experiences that happens in the
[1:09:18] wilderness Journey you may get an
[1:09:20] angel's bread come down from heaven you
[1:09:23] may get water from a rock you may be
[1:09:26] baptized in the Red Sea you may you may
[1:09:29] have wonderful experiences there
[1:09:33] amen but that's not what you're to dwell
[1:09:37] and that's what happens to a lot of
[1:09:39] people is they stop right there and they
[1:09:41] don't go all the way into the full
[1:09:43] possession
[1:09:46] now
[1:09:47] so Israel in the wilderness so generous
[1:09:51] they were not to rest there you know
[1:09:53] stay there they would travel day after
[1:09:55] day following the pillar of fire but
[1:09:58] they've finally come to the promised
[1:10:01] land
[1:10:02] where they will settle down in other
[1:10:05] words possess the full promise
[1:10:08] the full promise of the Holy Ghost
[1:10:11] remember we're not going to a physical
[1:10:13] land we're going to a spiritual land
[1:10:18] and that land is the Holy Ghost
[1:10:22] now and let me just say when you go
[1:10:25] beyond the curtain of time it's just
[1:10:27] more of the same
[1:10:30] amen you enter into Divine love which is
[1:10:33] the Holy Ghost
[1:10:35] so everything that is possessed but by
[1:10:38] for the believer what God wants you to
[1:10:40] have is to be filled with the spirit
[1:10:44] amen now so this this uh land that they
[1:10:48] they could look as they would arrive
[1:10:50] there and say you know we have come to
[1:10:53] the where Abraham walked we're here
[1:10:56] where Isaac was here and Jacob there
[1:11:00] poured oil upon the stone here and saw a
[1:11:03] ladder come down here or what this is a
[1:11:06] place where Israel Jacob became Israel
[1:11:09] and and the twelve Sons were born
[1:11:12] This Is Our Land
[1:11:16] this is our ancient land and we're
[1:11:18] coming back to possess it
[1:11:22] and whether you know they can say it I
[1:11:24] want to walk where Abraham walked I want
[1:11:27] to Journey down to Gere or I want to go
[1:11:29] over here to this place I I want to
[1:11:32] worship on this mountain there I want to
[1:11:34] do that I want to possess everything
[1:11:36] that they have
[1:11:39] I want to be where Jacob you know as I
[1:11:43] said saw the latter come down from
[1:11:45] heaven
[1:11:45] I want to be there in this land
[1:11:48] now but this ancient land of the Holy
[1:11:51] Ghost that we have returned to is where
[1:11:53] Jesus trod
[1:11:55] amen where the Holy Spirit fell where
[1:11:59] Paul preached were the principles of the
[1:12:02] word were given
[1:12:03] and we have returned back to the land so
[1:12:06] we can get back in the same position
[1:12:08] Paul was Peter was Jesus was back to the
[1:12:13] original gospel
[1:12:15] and that's why we have returned it's our
[1:12:18] land
[1:12:20] but well now we've been out of it for
[1:12:22] seven churches
[1:12:27] seven Church ages
[1:12:30] but we're coming here for a reason
[1:12:33] because we've got to come back to this
[1:12:35] land of the Holy Ghost
[1:12:37] to receive the Messiah
[1:12:41] Jesus has got to come back for a people
[1:12:46] amen
[1:12:48] well I think about it when when uh when
[1:12:51] um Caleb said give me this mountain
[1:12:53] what's he went with his own Mountain
[1:12:56] well how come he wants that well you
[1:12:59] know those big giants on it all of that
[1:13:02] is dairy and Hebron and there there is
[1:13:05] there at the foot of this mountain is a
[1:13:08] graveyard what's so important about this
[1:13:10] graveyard
[1:13:12] why do we want this graveyard
[1:13:15] well Abraham was buried there and Isaac
[1:13:18] was buried there and Jacob was buried
[1:13:21] there and we're going to bring Joseph's
[1:13:23] bones back and be buried in the Promised
[1:13:26] Land
[1:13:27] so why do we want why do why do want
[1:13:30] this so graveyard
[1:13:35] Army where job was buried
[1:13:38] right here in this Promised Land are you
[1:13:41] with me amen so again he said because I
[1:13:45] saw a vision
[1:13:47] and I know that my redeemer lives and in
[1:13:51] the last day he'll stand upon the Earth
[1:13:53] and I want to be buried where he comes
[1:13:57] so the rest of them were buried down
[1:13:59] and so Caleb said give me this
[1:14:03] now there's Giants on it and I want you
[1:14:06] to know there's Giants on the
[1:14:07] resurrection
[1:14:09] there's Giants standing on your body
[1:14:11] change
[1:14:12] there is Giants standing on the Rapture
[1:14:15] doing everything he can to keep you back
[1:14:18] from your inheritance
[1:14:21] but the reason we're coming back to this
[1:14:23] land is not just to possess it and have
[1:14:27] a good church called the evening like
[1:14:29] Tabernacle we want to come back to this
[1:14:31] lamb to welcome back Jesus Christ to the
[1:14:34] Earth
[1:14:37] amen give me a little more sound up here
[1:14:40] now
[1:14:42] this ancient land of the Holy Ghost
[1:14:46] as I said that we have returned to is
[1:14:49] where Jesus trod
[1:14:51] where Jesus left and ascended
[1:14:55] and where the Holy Ghost fell where Paul
[1:14:59] preached
[1:15:00] now
[1:15:02] and I want you to know that
[1:15:05] this journey into this land Begins for
[1:15:09] all of us
[1:15:11] if you know that where we come we leave
[1:15:14] Egypt behind us
[1:15:17] we start following the pillar of Fire
[1:15:21] we start out you know with a
[1:15:23] justification by faith I believe the
[1:15:26] land is for me
[1:15:29] I'm an Israelite I'm not just a slave
[1:15:32] I'm not going to stay down here and be a
[1:15:35] slave to the devil the rest of my life
[1:15:38] I'm not going to push drugs and alcohol
[1:15:40] and sex sins that would ruin my life
[1:15:44] it's it's made a slave out of me but
[1:15:47] that's not who I am that's who the devil
[1:15:50] tried to make of who I am
[1:15:53] I'm a child of the most high God and I'm
[1:15:56] going to go to where where that place
[1:15:59] where it's our land where we're not
[1:16:01] slaves we're freedom rings
[1:16:05] well I can have my own place my own
[1:16:07] house raise my own family raise virgin
[1:16:10] daughters and virgin Sons come on this
[1:16:14] is what I want to do I want a holy place
[1:16:16] and be a holy nation and A peculiar
[1:16:19] people
[1:16:21] so you start out on this journey
[1:16:23] you know where that you're you come
[1:16:27] separated by the Washings of the water
[1:16:30] by the word Believing on the Lord Jesus
[1:16:33] Christ and then being justified by faith
[1:16:36] you become a partaker in your peace with
[1:16:38] at God through Christ and you baptize
[1:16:42] them in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:16:44] Christ and uh you know to and that that
[1:16:47] that sets you out on your journey
[1:16:51] I want you to know many times people
[1:16:54] will stop there
[1:16:55] I believed and I was baptized
[1:16:59] and that's the end of the journey
[1:17:04] that's not where that's not where you
[1:17:06] were to arrive at you're still out in
[1:17:07] the wilderness
[1:17:10] it's a stage and a step toward the
[1:17:13] promise but you haven't received the
[1:17:15] promise
[1:17:18] now so again as you're looking there
[1:17:21] you're you're headed toward a promise
[1:17:23] that God made and what was the promise
[1:17:25] that God made he made you a promise of
[1:17:28] the Holy Ghost and all its properties
[1:17:33] to you to your children to them that are
[1:17:35] far off even as many as the Lord Our God
[1:17:38] shall call
[1:17:40] now once believe in the message
[1:17:43] except in the pardon and forgiveness of
[1:17:45] sin you've started a journey
[1:17:48] amen but your journey is not complete
[1:17:52] till you get to the land
[1:17:57] and then that land is the land of the
[1:18:00] Holy Ghost
[1:18:02] now in the in the message adoption
[1:18:05] brother Bradham speaks of this give me
[1:18:08] another microphone this this one is
[1:18:11] um I feel like it's not not carrying it
[1:18:14] so get me another microphone
[1:18:20] Timothy said get comfortable
[1:18:36] how many here to have church
[1:18:40] amen let's go forward then it sounds
[1:18:42] better thank you anyway Israel you know
[1:18:45] I had not received the promise getting
[1:18:47] out into the Wilderness just leaving
[1:18:48] Egypt wasn't enough
[1:18:50] you see they were on a journey and
[1:18:53] that's where that we've seen other
[1:18:55] others who have started out in the past
[1:18:58] in these seven churches we we've seen
[1:19:01] like Nazarene Pilgrim Holiness and all
[1:19:04] of them fell because you know they they
[1:19:08] didn't go all the way into the promise
[1:19:11] say they just built a camp out in the
[1:19:13] wilderness
[1:19:15] and because Israel when they came to the
[1:19:19] came to the place of cadius barnia and
[1:19:22] I've got a lot of things to say about
[1:19:24] that wave I don't get to it today I'll
[1:19:26] get to it but but when the spies came
[1:19:29] over and said the land is great
[1:19:32] and they brought back evidence but there
[1:19:34] was others that went and said we can't
[1:19:36] take it
[1:19:38] but Joshua and Caleb they stood out and
[1:19:41] said but we're more than able to take it
[1:19:44] God gave us a promise we can have this
[1:19:47] we can have what God said it is our
[1:19:51] promise
[1:19:52] This Is Our Land
[1:19:56] well but we didn't realize it would go
[1:19:59] on you know there was that was all of
[1:20:01] this and they were just happy with their
[1:20:03] twos works of Grace of justification and
[1:20:07] sanctification and they wouldn't move
[1:20:09] any farther
[1:20:10] how many people sit right there even on
[1:20:13] message pews that they've gone through
[1:20:15] repentance and baptism and done those
[1:20:18] kind of works but that never went on to
[1:20:21] real experience
[1:20:23] to going into the lion and discovered
[1:20:26] all the promises
[1:20:28] that lays in that land
[1:20:31] now as we're looking at instead of
[1:20:33] people going home brother Bradham said
[1:20:34] receiving the Holy Ghost and I'm quoting
[1:20:36] him speaking with tongues receiving the
[1:20:38] power of God the baptism of the Holy
[1:20:40] Ghost signs wonders and miracles they
[1:20:43] felt like it would break down their
[1:20:45] tradition of Doctrine so you see
[1:20:48] Pilgrim holiness
[1:20:52] and these moves of methodism wouldn't go
[1:20:55] any further
[1:20:57] that looked right at the promised land
[1:20:59] and said we cannot take it
[1:21:03] and we must never stop at justification
[1:21:06] or sanctification but we must go on into
[1:21:09] the fullness of God
[1:21:11] you know don't stop it just believe it
[1:21:14] on the Lord Jesus Christ and being
[1:21:16] baptized
[1:21:17] I've been just saying I believe the
[1:21:19] message and so that that is the Holy
[1:21:22] Ghost no that is not the Holy Ghost
[1:21:24] that's just being able to read
[1:21:28] that you're intellects that you think
[1:21:30] wealth in a mental ascent
[1:21:33] that's not the Holy Ghost
[1:21:35] amen you said well the evidence is
[1:21:38] believe in the word yeah you believe the
[1:21:40] word that says repent every one of you
[1:21:42] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:21:44] Christ and you shall receive the gift of
[1:21:47] the Holy Ghost for this promises to you
[1:21:49] so yeah you will believe the word and
[1:21:52] when you believe the whole word of God
[1:21:54] that said repent be baptized or receive
[1:21:56] the holy ghost that entitles you to the
[1:21:59] token
[1:22:02] that entitles you to the land
[1:22:05] now
[1:22:06] but you know we must stop we must not
[1:22:09] stop because he cleaned us up from sin
[1:22:13] but we're pressed on to a position a
[1:22:16] position in the Holy Ghost and take in
[1:22:18] our place in that land
[1:22:21] now you see that's our adoption that's
[1:22:23] ours that's spiritual maturity receiving
[1:22:26] the Holy Ghost and coming into the
[1:22:28] fullness of its promise as he just
[1:22:30] mentioned speaking with tongues
[1:22:32] receiving the power of God the baptism
[1:22:34] of the Holy Ghost signs wonders and
[1:22:37] miracles with baptism after baptism
[1:22:39] until we're changed in a moment in a
[1:22:43] twinkling of an eye
[1:22:45] now I don't know what people think we
[1:22:48] are entering into
[1:22:49] so well adoption brother Tim for
[1:22:52] maturity well that's the token that's
[1:22:55] the Holy Ghost that's the promised land
[1:22:58] and that promised land is the Holy Ghost
[1:23:01] now in 1961 on February the 11th there
[1:23:05] was a man came to brother Branham
[1:23:07] by the name of Danny Henry
[1:23:11] it was in a Full Gospel business meeting
[1:23:13] and brother Branham had just preached
[1:23:16] and this man came up and sort of
[1:23:18] embarrassed him you know because he
[1:23:20] grabbed him and hugged him and and said
[1:23:22] brother Branham said you know that could
[1:23:24] be the the 20th 23rd chapter of
[1:23:27] Revelation which there's not many that
[1:23:29] many chapters so that would be a an
[1:23:31] addition to the Bible
[1:23:33] and so you know brother Branham you know
[1:23:36] said no I just tried to preach what was
[1:23:38] in the Bible but this man was all
[1:23:40] excited you know because of of what he
[1:23:43] had heard and and how it had blessed him
[1:23:45] he wasn't criticizing but and so as he
[1:23:48] as he did the Holy Spirit fell upon him
[1:23:50] and he began to speak in French
[1:23:53] and he didn't know French
[1:23:56] but there were three at least three
[1:23:58] witnesses there who were French that did
[1:24:01] write down what he said
[1:24:04] so they interpreted they heard what he
[1:24:06] had said in the French language because
[1:24:08] they were as french-speaking people
[1:24:10] and it said because thou has chosen the
[1:24:13] Narrow Path
[1:24:15] because I had chosen to narrow path the
[1:24:17] harder way thou has walked of thine own
[1:24:20] choosing and brother Branham as he's
[1:24:22] looking at this he says you know he says
[1:24:25] um you you've got to make choices
[1:24:27] yourself
[1:24:29] Moses had had made his own choice and he
[1:24:32] didn't have to do it be and neither did
[1:24:34] I have to take this path he said I could
[1:24:37] add big buildings out yonder like some
[1:24:39] of them's got I could have a vehicle all
[1:24:42] across the television who would sponsor
[1:24:44] me when I'm tearing down the very
[1:24:46] Foundation but one thing I don't have to
[1:24:49] bow down to nobody's feet but the Lord
[1:24:51] Jesus Christ is right yes I preached
[1:24:53] what the Bible says I don't have to
[1:24:55] compromise with their organization
[1:24:57] because I belong to them I made the
[1:25:01] choice
[1:25:03] and you know that's the same thing with
[1:25:05] you you've got to make a choice
[1:25:08] it lays in the lap of every person this
[1:25:11] morning where are you going what what
[1:25:14] will you stay where you're at or you
[1:25:16] just Camp down where you are are you
[1:25:18] willing to go on into the fullness of
[1:25:22] the promise
[1:25:23] there is more for you than what you've
[1:25:26] experienced there's more for you than
[1:25:29] what you got
[1:25:31] say my brother Tim we're in the land
[1:25:32] Hallelujah we got the Holy Ghost and
[1:25:35] there's more of that Holy Ghost to be
[1:25:38] experienced
[1:25:39] until you are changed
[1:25:47] but people get happy where they're at
[1:25:49] and they want they will Camp down at one
[1:25:51] place and and they won't even fight to
[1:25:53] help somebody else get where they're
[1:25:55] going
[1:25:57] you know I've heard people say you know
[1:25:59] say in brag that they were so mature
[1:26:01] they didn't have to go to church
[1:26:04] it was only for the babies well if
[1:26:06] you're so mature then how come you're
[1:26:07] not giving birth to babies
[1:26:10] how come you're not out out there
[1:26:12] helping the babies mature and to grow in
[1:26:14] the Lord if you're so mature
[1:26:19] I'll tell you what you become is Granny
[1:26:21] grump
[1:26:22] amen you're way past Baron you're way
[1:26:25] you're way past value for anything
[1:26:28] time for you to cross over and get on
[1:26:30] over somewhere else because you're no
[1:26:33] value at all anymore we move on into God
[1:26:38] come on I'm not talking about because
[1:26:39] you're a certain age I'm talking about
[1:26:41] spiritual conditions
[1:26:45] amen so you see again you know you again
[1:26:50] in this land we can preach what the word
[1:26:53] sells we can believe what the word says
[1:26:57] we can experience what the word says we
[1:27:01] don't have to bow down to some system of
[1:27:03] man
[1:27:06] so brother said I was given he said I
[1:27:10] was given two signs he said of
[1:27:12] confirmation like Moses and he said so
[1:27:15] you know he said Moses had to make his
[1:27:18] choice
[1:27:19] and that's easy to understand because
[1:27:21] thou has chosen the Narrow Path the
[1:27:24] harder way that has walked of your own
[1:27:26] choosing you see a lot of this God don't
[1:27:29] make the decision for you and nobody
[1:27:32] else can
[1:27:34] you can sit in your Molly grubs all you
[1:27:36] want to and nobody can get you out of
[1:27:38] them
[1:27:40] you can sit there and feel sorry for
[1:27:42] yourself and you know why if you were in
[1:27:45] a bar you'd be down in your beer
[1:27:49] you know what because why because and
[1:27:51] nobody can help you you've got to get up
[1:27:53] and get out of that yourself
[1:27:59] amen nobody else can deliver you out of
[1:28:01] it you've got to do some fighting
[1:28:04] this land is worth fighting for the
[1:28:07] promises of God are worth fighting for
[1:28:09] your marriage is worth fighting for your
[1:28:12] children are worth fighting for
[1:28:15] come on now amen the power of God in the
[1:28:18] churches worth fighting for a holy ghost
[1:28:21] meeting is worth fighting for
[1:28:24] and it's a bike
[1:28:28] it's not going to just be handed to you
[1:28:29] on the silver platter
[1:28:32] you've got to choose
[1:28:35] you got to make a choice
[1:28:37] you got to make a choice in this service
[1:28:40] whether or not you're going to go
[1:28:42] further with God or whether you're going
[1:28:43] to try to remain the same and slide back
[1:28:47] I heard
[1:28:49] now
[1:28:51] this man was speaking in this French
[1:28:54] language
[1:28:55] and then the interpretation said thou
[1:28:59] has walked of your own chosen but thou
[1:29:02] hast thou Hast picked the correct and
[1:29:07] precise decision and it is my way
[1:29:11] amen if you're going to make a choice
[1:29:14] would you like God to say about you you
[1:29:16] did my way
[1:29:19] amen You Came the way of the word you
[1:29:21] did what the word said you obeyed what
[1:29:23] the word said
[1:29:25] well God won't give me the Holy Ghost
[1:29:27] brother Tim well if you'll obey what he
[1:29:29] said he will
[1:29:32] otherwise it makes God a liar
[1:29:35] God said if you'd repent you turn from
[1:29:37] your sins you would be baptized in the
[1:29:39] name he'd give it to you he says well I
[1:29:42] hadn't got it yet well you still hadn't
[1:29:43] repented it there's still something
[1:29:45] wrong in your repentance
[1:29:47] amen
[1:29:49] he's sitting there dawdling around and
[1:29:51] just saying well it's got to just be God
[1:29:54] if he wants to give it to me he'll have
[1:29:56] to give it to me that's Cain's attitude
[1:30:01] this is the best I got take it or leave
[1:30:03] it that was Cain
[1:30:07] amen
[1:30:08] now so he goes on to say he says he said
[1:30:12] to our house because thou has picked the
[1:30:15] correct and precise decision is my way
[1:30:18] and because of this momentous decision a
[1:30:21] huge portion of Heaven Waits thee and
[1:30:25] and of course you know he said that then
[1:30:28] he goes on himself that say that this in
[1:30:30] itself will give and make to come to
[1:30:32] pass their tremendous victory in the
[1:30:35] love divine so what in the world does
[1:30:37] that mean
[1:30:38] you see Divine love
[1:30:41] is the Holy Ghost brother Bradham
[1:30:43] referring to this and standing in the
[1:30:45] Gap he said now in the love divine
[1:30:48] Divine love how can that be divine love
[1:30:51] if it isn't the Holy Spirit the holy
[1:30:54] spirit is divine love
[1:30:56] so he said I'm not giving you a greater
[1:30:59] portion in heaven and so you're going to
[1:31:01] have more than everybody else
[1:31:04] but I'm going to give you a person
[1:31:06] because of your decision I'm going to
[1:31:09] give you a portion of Greater portion in
[1:31:12] the Holy Ghost
[1:31:16] amen so that tremendous portion and the
[1:31:19] love divine is the Holy Ghost and the
[1:31:21] Holy Ghost is the Lamb which we have
[1:31:23] entered
[1:31:26] we have arrived
[1:31:28] and for the seventh angel
[1:31:30] messenger that was a tremendous victory
[1:31:33] for him and for all of us
[1:31:37] because again it wasn't a big portion of
[1:31:41] Heaven up there but no it was a greater
[1:31:44] portion of the Holy Ghost given to this
[1:31:46] age so that the Seven Seals the
[1:31:49] mysteries of God would be open to us so
[1:31:53] that would end open up the entire word
[1:31:56] of God every promise of God and he said
[1:31:59] this in this tremendous victory in the
[1:32:02] Divine love so you know in the Holy
[1:32:05] Ghost now without a vision or aware that
[1:32:09] he saw himself looking there and he saw
[1:32:12] a map of Palestine
[1:32:14] and there as if he's coming down to to
[1:32:18] down the the map that he was standing on
[1:32:22] he said I'd come two-thirds of the way
[1:32:27] and we had come to the Jordan and he
[1:32:30] said praise God on the other side is
[1:32:33] where all the promises lay
[1:32:37] now I want you to understand you know
[1:32:39] the message of Luther did not bring us
[1:32:42] into the Promised Land
[1:32:44] the method method the Methodist message
[1:32:46] did not bring us into the promised land
[1:32:49] it was a step closer
[1:32:51] and Azusa Street got close enough to
[1:32:54] speak in tongues
[1:32:56] but it wasn't the Promised Land
[1:32:59] I want you to know this message is what
[1:33:02] brings you into the Holy Ghost and to
[1:33:05] its fullness
[1:33:07] it provides for you the token not a gift
[1:33:10] but the literal life of Jesus Christ
[1:33:16] now
[1:33:17] so you see he looked at him he said
[1:33:19] we've come we've come two-thirds of the
[1:33:22] journey that's as far as Pentecost had
[1:33:25] come that's as far as Luther had come
[1:33:27] that's as far as Wesley is coming I'm
[1:33:29] talking about Pentecost Azusa Street
[1:33:32] but now he said as he gets through to
[1:33:35] his message on Paradox where he tells
[1:33:37] him this vision
[1:33:39] and in the in between that Vision he
[1:33:42] sees that on that Journey there on the
[1:33:46] path on the highway is is a big mamba
[1:33:49] snake
[1:33:50] and is out to get and to kill and
[1:33:53] destroy because the devil will do
[1:33:55] anything he can to keep you out of the
[1:33:57] promise
[1:34:00] and he said every time it would come to
[1:34:02] me it would just slow down and come
[1:34:03] slower and slower until it would stop
[1:34:06] but after others it was chasing them
[1:34:08] around and they were just one step ahead
[1:34:11] of it
[1:34:14] and he said you've been given power to
[1:34:16] bind her loose
[1:34:20] and because of the power that was given
[1:34:22] to him he said then Satan that I might
[1:34:25] know the power that I have been given I
[1:34:29] bind you in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:34:32] amen and what happened there they he
[1:34:35] turned and he and he turned into a like
[1:34:39] a uh that snake turned into something
[1:34:42] Glass and its tail wrapped around its
[1:34:45] neck and blue smoke fell flew out of it
[1:34:48] and he said it Formed like an and sign
[1:34:54] and he said that meant
[1:34:56] anything beneath him
[1:35:02] and everything beneath him
[1:35:06] are you with me listen we are living in
[1:35:09] the day where there's got to be a people
[1:35:12] who binds the serpent death and her
[1:35:15] changed in a moment in a twinkling of an
[1:35:18] eye
[1:35:19] and when you do that you'll bind
[1:35:20] everything beneath him
[1:35:24] now
[1:35:25] so he said we won't be the Highland that
[1:35:28] runs back in the wilderness we'll cross
[1:35:30] Jordan the separation God break to us
[1:35:34] the seals that's on the back of the book
[1:35:37] so he knew then that that cross and
[1:35:40] Jordan would bring us in to the fullness
[1:35:43] of the Holy Ghost and the seals of God
[1:35:46] would be open the the book would be open
[1:35:49] come on Church
[1:35:51] I mean you know I was just at a meeting
[1:35:53] there in Germany and and there's a man
[1:35:56] who went around you know a preacher went
[1:35:58] around and said this guy this guy's
[1:36:01] preaching some weird Doctrine he's
[1:36:03] preaching that we have an open book
[1:36:09] I said well I sure wouldn't want to be
[1:36:11] preaching the book was closed
[1:36:14] this is no weird Doctrine this is a this
[1:36:17] is a Bible truth this is what God done
[1:36:19] in this day
[1:36:20] amen God saw that one that we entered
[1:36:23] him to the Holy Ghost and a huge portion
[1:36:25] of heaven was given to the prophet of
[1:36:28] God and that was that the Seven Seals
[1:36:30] would come off the book and it would
[1:36:32] open to us all the land
[1:36:35] every promise in the Bible all the way
[1:36:38] to a rapture
[1:36:39] [Applause]
[1:36:44] wow you can sing it again and say
[1:36:46] there's never been a day like this day
[1:36:48] to me
[1:36:49] we're living in an awesome hour an
[1:36:52] awesome time
[1:36:54] amen
[1:36:56] now
[1:36:57] so he he tells us this will be the
[1:37:00] tremendous victory in the love divine
[1:37:03] now listen because that this Prophet
[1:37:05] would not build the way of denomination
[1:37:07] because he would not sell his gift for
[1:37:10] money
[1:37:10] because he did not become popular now
[1:37:13] the church World criticizes him today
[1:37:16] say he didn't know how to handle money
[1:37:18] he didn't know how to use his gift he
[1:37:22] didn't understand his position all of
[1:37:24] these Yaya that they have about him but
[1:37:26] that was the very thing that God used
[1:37:30] because he wouldn't sell it
[1:37:33] because he didn't try to be the most
[1:37:35] popular though he had the greatest gift
[1:37:38] amen though he wouldn't sell it out to
[1:37:41] denomination and we'll fly you here and
[1:37:43] we'll fly you there and you can you can
[1:37:46] speak to the masses and uh we'll get you
[1:37:48] to listen to the the up and UPS will
[1:37:50] come and listen to you and all of that
[1:37:52] and and it won't be down to the the down
[1:37:55] and outs it'll be to the up and upset
[1:37:57] we'll get you in and we'll provide for
[1:37:59] you and you'll have a salary and a plane
[1:38:01] and you'll be the great man in our
[1:38:03] organization
[1:38:06] you know that's what the devil will do
[1:38:08] he'll offer you everything
[1:38:11] he'll offer you boys some little Jezebel
[1:38:14] that'll never make a mother to your
[1:38:16] children
[1:38:17] he'll offer you you girls some little
[1:38:20] Snicker Fritz there that that is not no
[1:38:22] more interested in the house of God or
[1:38:25] worshiper the Holy Ghost and nothing
[1:38:27] that'll never be a leader in the home
[1:38:30] amen that ain't all the devil will offer
[1:38:33] you jobs pulled you away from the house
[1:38:35] of God
[1:38:36] take you away from fatherhood ruin you
[1:38:39] come on do everything he canceled that
[1:38:42] these are Thief he comes to Rob and to
[1:38:44] kill and destroy
[1:38:59] so therefore instead of going with them
[1:39:02] God gave him a greater portion
[1:39:06] of the Holy Ghost
[1:39:09] which would open up the Seven Seals
[1:39:12] and the mysteries of God in the Book of
[1:39:14] Revelation would be revealed to us
[1:39:17] and we would know what the Thunders
[1:39:19] uttered they are the revelations
[1:39:21] contained in the Seven Seals
[1:39:25] it's surprising to me sometimes you know
[1:39:27] even this week I had a a preacher asked
[1:39:30] me you know you know one says the
[1:39:32] Thunders are this and one said they're
[1:39:33] that and brother Tim what's your opinion
[1:39:36] my opinion I I don't have an opinion
[1:39:39] I know what the prophet of God said
[1:39:42] you well all the seals aren't opened and
[1:39:45] then you still got well the seventh
[1:39:47] ain't opened well then you still got a
[1:39:49] strap on your Bible
[1:39:50] you still don't know the mysteries of
[1:39:52] God you still have got a closed book
[1:39:59] you know what caused that is because if
[1:40:01] people didn't get into the word and eat
[1:40:04] the book
[1:40:06] [Applause]
[1:40:14] kind of reminds me of brother Daniel
[1:40:16] Williams one time I won't tell you the
[1:40:18] whole story
[1:40:19] but anyway I'll tell you this part of it
[1:40:21] just to cut it short but there was a man
[1:40:24] that
[1:40:26] that came to him and said you know the
[1:40:29] seals aren't open brother Tim the
[1:40:30] seventh seal isn't open
[1:40:32] oh
[1:40:34] he said uh yeah it's it's open I said
[1:40:37] why don't you get me your seal book
[1:40:40] so he comes and brings him a seal book
[1:40:43] and he looks at it and there's two
[1:40:45] places marked in the whole book
[1:40:48] and he says
[1:40:50] preacher's visual book
[1:40:53] yeah no no that's not what I mean is
[1:40:56] this the one you study out of yes
[1:41:00] you know and then he looked at he said
[1:41:02] you just got a couple of places marked
[1:41:04] where somebody else told you what was in
[1:41:06] it and he closed it back and he handed
[1:41:08] it back to him and he said don't you
[1:41:10] argue with me again until you read this
[1:41:13] book
[1:41:18] amen you know read it eat it digest it
[1:41:22] you you will you will find out yeah
[1:41:24] brother brennerman you'll said some
[1:41:26] things in the original seventh seal and
[1:41:28] he said he felt checked about releasing
[1:41:31] it and so he held it back made a
[1:41:33] different ending that he would release
[1:41:34] but then after his death the whole the
[1:41:37] entire bit of it was was uh it was given
[1:41:40] to us the original seventh seal so
[1:41:43] brother Brandon can say God would not
[1:41:45] permit it so therefore it wasn't
[1:41:47] revealed because God wouldn't permit it
[1:41:50] because he made a new ending to it
[1:41:52] because he said it would send thousands
[1:41:54] of my friends from me you know why
[1:41:57] because he'd think he was trying to make
[1:41:58] himself the seventh angel
[1:42:03] so he made a new ending to it
[1:42:06] but friends that's not our excuse
[1:42:07] anymore there's over a hundred different
[1:42:09] quotes where brother Madam tells us all
[1:42:11] the Seven Seals have been revealed
[1:42:16] but it still winds up to be a question
[1:42:18] and a point of the dissension because
[1:42:21] people that is their Cadence Barney
[1:42:28] and they look at it and say we can't
[1:42:30] take it
[1:42:32] and we can't go into that and it's not
[1:42:34] for us and we can't possess it it's
[1:42:37] their Cadence barnia
[1:42:41] so they wander around and around and
[1:42:44] around make a camp out in the wilderness
[1:42:46] rather than going on into the Holy Ghost
[1:42:53] now
[1:42:55] kadish barnia happens more than once
[1:43:00] for many of you today your face in the
[1:43:03] Kadesh barnea
[1:43:04] I got some whole messages to preach on
[1:43:07] it
[1:43:08] but you're at a place where you've got
[1:43:10] to make a choice
[1:43:13] you're either going to be talked out of
[1:43:15] it by the devil because of some
[1:43:17] circumstance and say well it ain't for
[1:43:20] me or you're going to go all the way
[1:43:23] you've got to decide what are you are
[1:43:25] you one of those that's going to perish
[1:43:27] in the wilderness are you a just for a
[1:43:29] Caleb
[1:43:31] you got to decide it is the promise for
[1:43:33] me for my children
[1:43:36] amen this is our inheritance This Is My
[1:43:39] Land This is my possession and I'm going
[1:43:42] to take it
[1:43:46] every sick person is at their own
[1:43:48] Cadence barnia
[1:43:51] they don't go on into it and and
[1:43:54] fight and take their possession well
[1:43:58] they'll be graduated to the other side
[1:44:03] but nevertheless barnia
[1:44:08] but now I want you to know
[1:44:11] Joshua had a Ministry and his ministry
[1:44:14] was to divide inheritance that God had
[1:44:16] left for Israel and so his part his job
[1:44:20] was to give us the land
[1:44:24] and and of course
[1:44:27] because of his love being accepted in
[1:44:30] the Beloved here in the land I want you
[1:44:33] to understand it's a land flowing with
[1:44:35] milk and honey
[1:44:38] yeah I know they're they're demons there
[1:44:41] there are devils there they're camped
[1:44:43] out jebusites and and websites and every
[1:44:46] other thing
[1:44:48] are you with me
[1:44:50] amen but we have been accepted in the
[1:44:53] Beloved and we're here in the land of
[1:44:55] the Holy Ghost and there are gifts
[1:44:57] because of his love there is healing
[1:45:01] because of his love there are Miracles
[1:45:03] and joy and peace and happiness all
[1:45:06] because of his love
[1:45:09] is all in the Holy Ghost
[1:45:11] let me show you this in the Bible Romans
[1:45:14] Chapter 14 verse 17 you can put it on
[1:45:16] the screen for everybody to see
[1:45:19] for the kingdom of God is Not meat and
[1:45:22] drink you know because they're they're
[1:45:25] about over here arguing over what kind
[1:45:27] of meats we can eat and whether or not
[1:45:29] this is kosher and that is not and he
[1:45:30] said if the kingdom of God is not meet
[1:45:32] and drink but here's what the kingdom is
[1:45:35] it is righteousness peace and joy where
[1:45:39] and the Holy Ghost amen so all of the
[1:45:43] promise of God lay in the Holy Ghost
[1:45:48] and you're saying I don't need more of
[1:45:50] it oh yes you do
[1:45:51] [Applause]
[1:45:57] the whole land is yours
[1:46:00] why would you just be satisfied with a
[1:46:02] little bit
[1:46:04] you're not a slave anymore that has no
[1:46:07] right to own land
[1:46:09] you have a right to ever Divine promise
[1:46:16] so here's our domain this is our Kingdom
[1:46:18] right there
[1:46:19] the kingdom of God is righteousness
[1:46:22] peace and joy in the Holy Ghost
[1:46:26] so that's the kingdom that's our domain
[1:46:30] that's our Dominion that means
[1:46:33] that's what we're King over
[1:46:37] amen king of righteousness king of Peace
[1:46:40] king of joy
[1:46:43] king of your complexes
[1:46:47] king of your hindrances
[1:46:49] King over what the devil said about you
[1:46:52] you're King
[1:46:54] amen you're not a slave you have been
[1:46:57] brought here's a royal Nation a holy
[1:46:59] priesthood
[1:47:04] so you see that's our borders and within
[1:47:07] the borders of our land is the power of
[1:47:09] God
[1:47:12] overcoming life
[1:47:14] miracles
[1:47:16] signs wonders
[1:47:20] and once in the Holy Ghost
[1:47:25] and you take apart I say you know
[1:47:28] Jericho gets open and you see now the
[1:47:31] whole book is open well you don't stay
[1:47:32] there at Jericho
[1:47:36] we'll just major on this no you go on to
[1:47:39] the next
[1:47:41] amen you go in your expand your borders
[1:47:45] and man expanded from sea to Sea
[1:47:48] all that the word of God says you can
[1:47:50] have you do it
[1:47:51] and then there there again once in the
[1:47:54] Holy Ghost we keep expanding and there
[1:47:58] we will even meet death itself and death
[1:48:03] will be swallowed up in Victory
[1:48:07] I'm preaching to a people that will meet
[1:48:10] death himself not some little demon
[1:48:14] not some little devil not some little
[1:48:17] complex not submit them
[1:48:21] physical problem come on
[1:48:24] sickness or ailment but death himself
[1:48:27] and we'll defeat him
[1:48:33] for the Bible said death will be
[1:48:35] swallowed up
[1:48:37] in Victory that's how complete
[1:48:41] he has given the land
[1:48:44] to even death itself will be taken
[1:48:50] wouldn't you like to get it around your
[1:48:52] hands around its neck and squeeze it
[1:48:54] real hard until it gasped like you've
[1:48:56] seen some of your loved ones gasp
[1:49:04] somebody's going to do that
[1:49:08] might as well be me
[1:49:11] for this reason I've come
[1:49:13] that's the way you feel
[1:49:15] should be
[1:49:16] there in the Holy Ghost we're going to
[1:49:17] be changed in a moment in the twinkling
[1:49:19] of an eye you think that's going to be
[1:49:21] less of the Holy Ghost no it'll be more
[1:49:23] of the Holy Ghost
[1:49:24] amen the the Dynamics of this church
[1:49:27] will be a refillment of the Holy Ghost
[1:49:30] you know I I don't care what part you
[1:49:33] have taken and how far you've Advanced
[1:49:35] there's still more to advance and that's
[1:49:36] what I keep saying advance
[1:49:46] so there in the Holy Ghost will be
[1:49:47] changed in a moment the twinkling of an
[1:49:49] eye with the refilling of the Holy Ghost
[1:49:51] we will be caught up to meet him in the
[1:49:54] air with the dead in Christ from The
[1:49:56] Seven Ages
[1:49:59] so
[1:50:01] there again brother Bradham talked about
[1:50:04] this
[1:50:05] he said Joshua and Caleb had that faith
[1:50:08] they looked at the adversary
[1:50:11] and they had that faith
[1:50:14] said we're more than able to conquer
[1:50:16] this anything
[1:50:18] the others looked at it and said we're
[1:50:20] like grasshoppers
[1:50:22] in their sight
[1:50:24] I don't know how they knew that
[1:50:26] must have went up and asked what do I
[1:50:28] look like Oh I'm a grasshopper
[1:50:31] well no you know it was in their
[1:50:34] imagination
[1:50:36] you know some people need something
[1:50:37] their imagination cleansed
[1:50:40] because every time that they listen to
[1:50:42] something even repeat I don't even know
[1:50:44] how to get along with their own wife or
[1:50:46] husband
[1:50:47] because their imagination goes so wild
[1:50:50] you know what I'm saying he said this
[1:50:52] about me and never was said she said
[1:50:54] that way and it was never that it was
[1:50:55] imagination
[1:50:57] brother Tim meant this how do you know
[1:50:59] what I meant
[1:51:03] you let some devil sit on your on your
[1:51:06] shoulder and twist what I say and then
[1:51:08] tell me what I meant
[1:51:11] it wasn't what I meant what the devil
[1:51:13] said
[1:51:14] to you
[1:51:16] but you see Joshua and Caleb they had
[1:51:18] that faith that we're more than able to
[1:51:20] conquer anything that would come before
[1:51:22] us and he said that's the trouble with
[1:51:25] the church we can conquer every disease
[1:51:26] we have the power in us we are Sons and
[1:51:30] Daughters of God nothing can stand
[1:51:32] before us the only thing he wants is to
[1:51:35] find somebody who will believe it
[1:51:38] I say don't let this come this far and
[1:51:41] leave the the systems of the world
[1:51:44] denominationalism and embrace the
[1:51:46] message and embrace the truth and
[1:51:48] believe this and believe that and then
[1:51:51] stop
[1:51:52] short
[1:51:54] of recognizing Who We Are
[1:51:57] and our sonship
[1:52:00] he wants somebody who will believe it he
[1:52:03] wants to believe he will believe that
[1:52:04] what God's already done for you
[1:52:08] not we will be we are now and the ever
[1:52:11] living presence of the spirit of God is
[1:52:14] in us now so again
[1:52:17] so God brings him to this land
[1:52:20] and they stand to Kadesh

[1:59:06] brother Tim make up my mind for me not
[1:59:10] I won't do it
[1:59:11] won't help
[1:59:14] you're the one
[1:59:16] who has to choose the narrow way
[1:59:19] the harder way
[1:59:21] God's way
[1:59:25] now
[1:59:27] here's a tip
[1:59:29] and I got this tip from Brother Branham
[1:59:32] who said I'll give you a little tip
[1:59:37] sometimes you might be sitting out there
[1:59:39] with a cancer
[1:59:40] or you might be sitting there with this
[1:59:42] disease and you think why me being a
[1:59:45] Christian would it be be in this way why
[1:59:49] would I be sitting like this if I'm a
[1:59:51] Christian sometimes God lets the things
[1:59:54] get so dark that you can't see up around
[1:59:57] or anywhere else and then he comes and
[2:00:00] makes a way through it for you that you
[2:00:03] might say this day this scripture is
[2:00:06] being fulfilled that he promised to do
[2:00:09] he let the children the Hebrew children
[2:00:12] walk right into the fiery furnace but
[2:00:15] then they said our God is able to
[2:00:17] Deliver Us from this firing this
[2:00:19] fruitness but nevertheless will not bow
[2:00:22] to your image
[2:00:23] amen and when they walked out of there
[2:00:25] the smell no smell of the furnace was
[2:00:28] upon them and they could have said this
[2:00:30] day this scripture is fulfilled so God
[2:00:34] allows circumstances in our life so we
[2:00:38] can be inspired to say this day
[2:00:42] it's promise this word is true and it is
[2:00:47] fulfilled
[2:00:49] Hallelujah
[2:00:51] now
[2:00:53] Joshua knew what God had said
[2:00:56] he was Seed of Abraham
[2:00:58] and he said you know he looked up and
[2:01:01] said I believe God has given us this
[2:01:03] land
[2:01:04] and we're more than able to take it
[2:01:07] and because he stood the test against
[2:01:09] that whole group of Israelites listen
[2:01:11] all his brethren
[2:01:13] him and Caleb stood together and all the
[2:01:16] rest of them argued against it
[2:01:20] you know and then they went out and
[2:01:21] spread the the bad report
[2:01:24] you know first said that they'll survive
[2:01:26] yep the land's there
[2:01:28] it's as good as God said
[2:01:31] it's flowing with milk and honey
[2:01:34] but you see in this Modern Age we can't
[2:01:36] take it
[2:01:38] you see it ain't for us
[2:01:40] yeah you know and and here they bring
[2:01:43] back fruit you know three three
[2:01:46] evidences of that land of how good it
[2:01:49] really was
[2:01:51] and they even disbelieved the evidence
[2:01:56] and then he said
[2:02:00] so they they stand there and and hear
[2:02:02] Joshua stands a test
[2:02:06] and as they give this evil report
[2:02:09] the whole congregation now the whole
[2:02:12] church
[2:02:13] comes under the spirit of depression
[2:02:19] and say would be God we would have died
[2:02:21] in the wilderness
[2:02:24] and then they begin to say lead us and
[2:02:27] make us a captain and take us back to
[2:02:29] Egypt
[2:02:32] you see because they wanted the land but
[2:02:35] they didn't want to have to conquer
[2:02:41] now no matter how big you are or how
[2:02:44] what the opposition is what the doctor
[2:02:47] said God gave the promise and God is up
[2:02:49] to it
[2:02:51] come on if God gave it God's going to
[2:02:53] back up his word
[2:02:54] amen and here Joshua and Caleb said keep
[2:02:57] still
[2:02:58] everybody shut up
[2:03:00] they're bread for us
[2:03:02] we can take it
[2:03:05] our God is bigger than them
[2:03:08] amen what we have is greater than what
[2:03:11] they have oh but they have walls our God
[2:03:14] is greater
[2:03:15] and God would prove them walls would
[2:03:18] fall flat
[2:03:19] the moment that they testified and
[2:03:23] shouted
[2:03:24] maybe God's waiting on you to start
[2:03:26] shouting
[2:03:29] maybe God's really waiting for you to
[2:03:31] start quitting right quit your
[2:03:32] negativism and start being positive
[2:03:35] about the word of God and quick take the
[2:03:37] cane out and say I can
[2:03:41] but you don't know how long I've had
[2:03:43] this problem you don't know it's been in
[2:03:45] my family you don't know I don't care
[2:03:47] what I don't know I know what I do know
[2:03:49] and I know God gave me this land and I'm
[2:03:52] taking this land
[2:03:54] Hallelujah the promises to you to your
[2:03:57] children amen says not only for me but
[2:04:00] if I break the cycle it will break the
[2:04:03] cycle for my children
[2:04:06] Hallelujah why pass this unbelief down
[2:04:09] to another generation
[2:04:11] [Applause]
[2:04:17] so what do you do when he come down to
[2:04:19] that River Jordan he possessigated his
[2:04:22] enemies

[2:04:29] believing and if you'll start believing
[2:04:31] the devil will get scared

[2:04:38] believing
[2:04:40] Hallelujah the moment that you start
[2:04:42] realizing that amen I'm not waiting on
[2:04:45] the power I've Got The Power you shall
[2:04:48] receive power after the Holy Ghost has
[2:04:50] come upon you and I have the Holy Ghost

[2:06:06] but the devil in his camp in Jericho was
[2:06:09] having sleepless nights

[2:09:21] years ago when I had
[2:09:23] my surgeries
[2:09:26] it was back in 1978
[2:09:33] I went to an old doctor
[2:09:36] when I was 12.
[2:09:38] he looked at my feet and what he would
[2:09:40] have to do
[2:09:41] to do a surgery on him
[2:09:44] and he swore and he cursed thinking
[2:09:46] about what he had to do
[2:09:50] when I was about
[2:09:52] 24 23
[2:09:54] I went back to the same old doctor
[2:09:56] because he was a gutsy old man
[2:09:58] he would take risks nobody else would
[2:10:03] a guy had crashed on the side of the
[2:10:06] road in a motorcycle and brought him up
[2:10:08] to the hospital
[2:10:10] oh Dr over Dyke said send them back to
[2:10:12] the scene of the accident
[2:10:14] pick up every piece of bone you can
[2:10:17] everybody else all the other doctors
[2:10:19] said I just cut his leg off he said no
[2:10:21] go back and pick up every piece of bone
[2:10:23] you can find bring me every fragment
[2:10:26] he cleaned them up and laid them down
[2:10:28] right in that thing and they all grew
[2:10:30] back together and the man kept his leg
[2:10:32] he was a gutsy old doctor
[2:10:36] by the time that I'm I went to him for
[2:10:38] surgery he'd had a heart attack
[2:10:41] and he didn't smoke any more because
[2:10:43] there in the office he'd light one
[2:10:45] cigarette off another when I was 12.
[2:10:48] but he said
[2:10:50] he had a heart attack and he said in the
[2:10:52] ambulance
[2:10:54] I flicked that cigarette out the
[2:10:55] ambulance door and I never smoked
[2:10:57] another one
[2:11:00] but anyway
[2:11:03] he gave me a 50 chance of keeping my
[2:11:06] feet
[2:11:09] said because of infection or whatever
[2:11:11] sits on
[2:11:13] he said but I'll tell you what
[2:11:15] a prosthetic be better than what you got
[2:11:18] in their condition
[2:11:21] so
[2:11:22] I didn't know
[2:11:24] I didn't know what you know what to do
[2:11:26] you know I was looking at this as a very
[2:11:28] serious thing
[2:11:30] you know he got feet and you don't want
[2:11:32] to lose him
[2:11:34] and
[2:11:36] so
[2:11:38] you know I was praying about it
[2:11:41] you love this story
[2:11:43] my friend
[2:11:48] brother vermilion's back there listening
[2:11:50] he knew brother the Lakers
[2:11:53] brother Liquors
[2:11:54] received a word from the Lord from for
[2:11:56] me
[2:11:58] he drove 500 miles over across to
[2:12:02] deliver
[2:12:03] that message
[2:12:06] and it was Romans 16.
[2:12:09] and it said the God of Peace will bruise
[2:12:13] Satan under your feet
[2:12:21] I took that Word of Promise and I went
[2:12:23] there and I had that surgery and when I
[2:12:26] came out of the walking cast that old
[2:12:28] doctor that was hard as he could be he
[2:12:31] looked at me and said Son don't you ever
[2:12:34] thank me for for what I've done he said
[2:12:37] I that did nothing said listen you have
[2:12:40] laid in that hospital nine days
[2:12:44] and your feet your leg swelled up so
[2:12:47] much
[2:12:49] my old ticker would go and beat like
[2:12:51] this every time I looked at you
[2:12:54] said I just knew I was going to have to
[2:12:55] cut it off because infection and
[2:12:57] whatever would get in it and your foot
[2:12:59] soiled up so big we had to cut the cast
[2:13:02] Open and hold it there
[2:13:03] and said but look son look at you
[2:13:06] walking down this aisle
[2:13:09] he throwed up his hands he said

[2:20:15] the will and say we will have every
[2:20:17] promise that God gave

[2:20:22] Jesus paid for it
[2:20:26] we're going to possess
[2:20:28] the land of our inheritance
[2:20:31] but you
[2:20:33] are at your own Kadesh Borneo
[2:20:37] some of you young people could be going
[2:20:39] to the camp
[2:20:41] and you'll be looking there and you'll
[2:20:43] see others bring back fruit
[2:20:47] victories

[2:21:11] go and I've seen them fall and they will
[2:21:13] not stand well you got look at one here
[2:21:15] the 50-something years and I'm still
[2:21:18] standing
[2:21:21] a young person in this generation in
[2:21:24] this age and this time but you are now
[2:21:27] at your cadish barnia
[2:21:29] you got to make your own decision
[2:21:33] it lays in the lap of every man every
[2:21:35] woman what will I do with this Jesus
[2:21:38] called Christ
[2:21:40] because he's on your hands and you can't
[2:21:43] wash it off
[2:21:45] pilate couldn't and you couldn't
[2:21:52] so the best thing to do is take it
[2:21:54] and place him in your heart
[2:21:57] I want you to Bow your heads with me
[2:22:03] went to musicians to come
[2:22:10] it's okay days Barney a moment anytime
[2:22:13] you see a promise of God
[2:22:15] and you have to decide
[2:22:18] like Joshua and Caleb
[2:22:21] whether what you are seeing is true or
[2:22:24] whether what God's word says is true
[2:22:29] where the circumstances are too big
[2:22:32] your problem's too large
[2:22:38] I can never break this addition
[2:22:39] addiction I can never get over this
[2:22:41] problem
[2:22:47] if I were to listen to the devil he that
[2:22:50] disqualified me many years ago
[2:22:52] he'll do everything he can to disqualify
[2:22:54] you
[2:22:56] he'll do everything he can to try to
[2:22:58] find some blemish some fault some this
[2:23:01] some that one why you're unworthy not
[2:23:03] able
[2:23:05] if I don't listen to him there wouldn't
[2:23:06] be a church called the evening light
[2:23:08] Tabernacle
[2:23:21] if you listen to him
[2:23:23] there won't be a Rapture for you
[2:23:31] if you listen to him you'll go right on
[2:23:33] a slave to that addiction
[2:23:36] Satan
[2:23:38] destroying you in your marriage your
[2:23:40] home destroying your kids
[2:23:43] he's a thief he comes to Rob and to kill
[2:23:46] and destroy but Jesus said I come to
[2:23:48] hell I give life
[2:23:50] an abundant life
[2:23:54] why don't you ask him today
[2:23:57] Lord let me come into the abundance
[2:23:59] abundance
[2:24:01] of the Holy Ghost
[2:24:04] to the fullness
[2:24:08] of my destiny
[2:24:11] that you promised me in the Beloved
[2:24:16] God bless you he sees your hands
[2:24:19] would there be somebody here today say
[2:24:21] brother Tim I'm
[2:24:24] there's an addiction in my life there's
[2:24:26] a
[2:24:27] situation there that I I've never been
[2:24:30] able to overcome
[2:24:33] it's I drink
[2:24:36] I use alcohol
[2:24:38] I do this I do that
[2:24:42] you know the reason for it is because
[2:24:44] God Made You to thirst after him
[2:24:48] and you're thirsting for a living God
[2:24:52] a cold Creed of some denomination ain't
[2:24:54] gonna satisfy that longing
[2:24:56] you're going to have to meet Jesus
[2:25:01] in the time in the time that your
[2:25:03] Cadence barnia today where you're forced
[2:25:05] to make a choice

[2:25:14] longer
[2:25:15] I want to be free
[2:25:17] would there be somebody raise their hand
[2:25:19] to God and say that's me I want to be
[2:25:21] free

[2:25:29] amen he sees you
[2:25:31] your little heart
[2:25:34] my soul thirst for Living God

[2:25:56] I pray that every man woman boy and girl
[2:25:59] will come into that Fellowship
[2:26:01] [Music]
[2:26:02] into that Joy divine
[2:26:05] where they can realize if God is on my
[2:26:08] side
[2:26:09] if he had not been on my side if he had
[2:26:12] not left a remnant
[2:26:15] [Music]
[2:26:18] we'd all be consumed
[2:26:20] but Lord you've left a remnant
[2:26:23] you've left a people who want to serve
[2:26:25] you who wants to give their lives to you
[2:26:27] I pray that you'll Minister them in a
[2:26:30] special way today
[2:26:31] ever a heart of her life
[2:26:34] I pray that those addictions and things
[2:26:36] that they're gotten that's holding on
[2:26:39] their lives will be broken
[2:26:41] that today they can say
[2:26:43] I'm willing
[2:26:45] I'm willing to take God to this word I'm
[2:26:47] willing to fight through until I see
[2:26:50] victory
[2:26:51] in Jesus name
[2:26:53] I ask it For Your Glory prepare our
[2:26:56] hearts Lord as we come to the communion
[2:26:58] table
[2:27:00] in Jesus name
[2:27:03] amen
[2:27:05] amen God bless you
[2:27:09] we're going to be coming to the
[2:27:10] communion here just in a moment brother
[2:27:12] Timothy is going to come lead a couple
[2:27:14] of songs
[2:27:17] we have to do things just a little
[2:27:18] different and
[2:27:20] because of the size of our audience
[2:27:25] and those who participate
[2:27:30] so you know when we were just a little
[2:27:32] home Church
[2:27:34] are there and the old
[2:27:37] Lebanon Primitive Baptist building
[2:27:42] we just stand around in a circle and I
[2:27:45] take the the one glass and
[2:27:48] platter bread and walk around and serve
[2:27:50] communion
[2:27:53] then things change
[2:27:56] things
[2:27:57] different things are needed
[2:28:01] and we have to change we do it like
[2:28:03] brother Branham did
[2:28:05] it's in it's in the message
[2:28:07] we used the multiple cups
[2:28:10] and the broken bread
[2:28:14] I loved it in the old church where we
[2:28:16] could while we was waiting on the
[2:28:18] sisters to come back from their foot
[2:28:19] washing us Brothers could gather around
[2:28:21] lay hands on one another
[2:28:23] pray over different needs till everybody
[2:28:25] gathered back in that was wonderful
[2:28:29] we moved here we have to do things a
[2:28:30] little different
[2:28:33] so as you know
[2:28:34] that when we do have the communion here
[2:28:36] in a minute
[2:28:37] you'd be ushered down the aisle by the
[2:28:41] by one of the ushers
[2:28:45] and you'll the deacons will be holding
[2:28:48] the bread the wine
[2:28:50] I will be standing there as the guard to
[2:28:52] the table
[2:28:54] watching each one of you as you come
[2:28:56] through
[2:28:59] that's why we were instructed to do
[2:29:03] then you'll go out and go to foot
[2:29:05] washing so well it's not night
[2:29:11] it's not enough
[2:29:14] it's dark enough
[2:29:16] the world we're living in is dark enough
[2:29:20] when you leave from here and from this
[2:29:22] church you're going to have to go out
[2:29:23] into the darkness
[2:29:25] but you can go out with a song in your
[2:29:27] heart
[2:29:29] knowing that greater is he that's in you
[2:29:31] than he that's in the world
[2:29:34] so God bless you as we prepare for that
[2:29:37] moment

[2:42:46] surely
[2:42:47] [Music]
[2:42:58] is
[2:43:01] [Music]
[2:43:05] one more time
[2:43:12] for us adventurous
[2:43:19] foreign
[2:43:24] [Music]
[2:43:40] foreign
[2:43:45] [Music]
[2:44:00] for I have received of the Lord that
[2:44:02] which also I delivered to you
[2:44:05] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[2:44:07] which he was betrayed took bread and
[2:44:10] when he had given thanks he break it and
[2:44:13] said take eat this is my body
[2:44:16] which is broken for you this do in
[2:44:18] remembrance of me
[2:44:20] and after the same manner also he took
[2:44:23] the cup
[2:44:24] when he had stopped saying
[2:44:27] this cup is a new testament in my blood
[2:44:31] this new year is often as you drink it
[2:44:33] in remembrance of me
[2:44:36] for as often as you eat this bread and
[2:44:38] drink this cup
[2:44:40] you just show the Lord's death till he
[2:44:42] come
[2:44:44] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[2:44:47] and drink this cup of the Lord
[2:44:48] unworthily
[2:44:50] shall be guilty of the body and the
[2:44:52] blood of the Lord
[2:44:55] but let a man examine himself and so let
[2:44:58] him eat of that bread and drink of that
[2:45:00] cup
[2:45:01] for he that eateth and drinketh
[2:45:03] unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation
[2:45:05] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[2:45:08] body
[2:45:10] and for this cause many are weak and
[2:45:12] sickly among you and many sleep
[2:45:15] for if we would judge ourselves we
[2:45:17] should not be judged
[2:45:19] but when we are judged we're chastened
[2:45:22] of the Lord that we should not be
[2:45:23] condemned with the world
[2:45:25] wherefore my brethren when you come
[2:45:27] together to eat tarry one for another
[2:45:31] and if any man the hunger let him eat at
[2:45:34] home that you come not together
[2:45:37] under condemnation
[2:45:40] as far hits together now father
[2:45:43] today I commit this wine and bread
[2:45:47] and to you is a representation of your
[2:45:51] blood and body
[2:45:53] and we Lord by representation take this
[2:45:56] as a token
[2:45:58] identifying ourselves
[2:46:02] with the sacrifice
[2:46:04] and realizing that your body itself was
[2:46:07] not broken
[2:46:09] but there on the day of Pentecost
[2:46:12] the spirit of God was
[2:46:14] torn
[2:46:16] from you
[2:46:17] and they're divided among the people
[2:46:21] so when we hold this bread in our hands
[2:46:24] we're remembering I am a part of this
[2:46:26] body
[2:46:27] I have a place where I fit
[2:46:30] in the body of Christ
[2:46:32] and when we take this wine which
[2:46:34] represents the life
[2:46:37] of the grape
[2:46:39] that has been squeezed out
[2:46:42] Lord we realize your life was squeezed
[2:46:44] out for us
[2:46:47] and you were wounded for our
[2:46:49] transgressions
[2:46:51] the sins that we committed
[2:46:53] for our iniquity you took the bruising
[2:46:57] and the chastisement
[2:47:00] the whippings that we should have got
[2:47:02] you took them for us
[2:47:04] thank you Lord thank you for what you've
[2:47:07] done now may all our sins be under the
[2:47:10] blood of Jesus
[2:47:12] Lord may we oh God is take this today
[2:47:16] and eat and drink of this bread and this
[2:47:19] wine remembering
[2:47:22] what we are a part of
[2:47:24] and that we're to drink deep of the
[2:47:26] spirit as the Bible said be not drunk
[2:47:28] with wine which is excess but be filled
[2:47:31] with the spirit
[2:47:33] but Lord as we take this little portion
[2:47:36] just
[2:47:37] to remind us
[2:47:39] of how your life was squeezed out
[2:47:43] that you gave your your blood for us
[2:47:46] that we are people that you valued and
[2:47:49] that you love so much
[2:47:52] I asked Lord you're blessed now
[2:47:55] this portion and the people as they come
[2:47:58] today in Jesus name
[2:48:01] amen
[2:48:03] amen
[2:48:05] I want you to remember
[2:48:07] as you come
[2:48:09] originally this was a Passover meal
[2:48:13] and people would take of what they had
[2:48:17] they would bring it
[2:48:19] and this was in memory of the Passover
[2:48:22] and then they would Gather in homes and
[2:48:25] places and
[2:48:26] some would have much and some would have
[2:48:29] little and Paul would say said well
[2:48:32] you're shaming those who have nothing
[2:48:36] because they have very little and
[2:48:38] the others have
[2:48:40] lots of abundance that they have brought
[2:48:43] to this meal
[2:48:45] so he said I received something from the
[2:48:47] Lord we're not going to do this as a
[2:48:50] meal anymore we're just going to take
[2:48:52] the bread and the wine
[2:48:54] and we're going to remember
[2:48:56] in doing so
[2:48:59] the death of the Lord because with this
[2:49:02] part we're going to do in remembrance
[2:49:06] this is just for a moment
[2:49:08] you will take this
[2:49:11] 10 minutes from now it'll be out of your
[2:49:13] mouth
[2:49:15] The Taste maybe we might be gone
[2:49:18] [Music]
[2:49:20] the communion that you're really
[2:49:22] supposed to have
[2:49:24] is a communion Lord
[2:49:28] that's the fellowship
[2:49:31] we will go from here and have a
[2:49:33] fellowship meal
[2:49:34] we will enjoy the fellowship of others
[2:49:38] that Fellowship of sweet and it's good
[2:49:40] it's all because of Jesus we have one
[2:49:42] another
[2:49:44] so we're thankful for each one of you
[2:49:47] you're everyone part important to the
[2:49:49] body of Christ
[2:49:52] but then
[2:49:53] that me all will be gone
[2:49:57] maybe in days to come you'll even forget
[2:49:59] what you even ate The Taste will be gone
[2:50:02] from your mouth
[2:50:04] but that's not really the fellowship
[2:50:06] meal
[2:50:08] no more than this is really the
[2:50:10] communion God wants
[2:50:12] he wants your fellowship
[2:50:16] so as you come down through here and you
[2:50:19] take of the bread and the wine I want
[2:50:21] you to remember
[2:50:25] that you're a part of this body
[2:50:27] and that you're an important part
[2:50:30] each part will fit together to make a
[2:50:33] loaf
[2:50:34] all torn from the same loaf
[2:50:37] we are of one body
[2:50:41] we'll take out the blood the wine the
[2:50:44] blood of the grape
[2:50:47] and we will drink of that
[2:50:50] but let's remember what it's all about
[2:50:54] let's remember it's an action to cause a
[2:50:57] reaction
[2:50:59] like Elisha through the stick in the
[2:51:03] water and iron floated
[2:51:04] like he had salt in a cruise and poured
[2:51:07] in a bitter stream
[2:51:09] like Moses cut down a tree which would
[2:51:13] represent Christ and the cross
[2:51:15] make bitter water sweet
[2:51:18] it was an action to cause a reaction
[2:51:21] this in itself is no good unless it
[2:51:25] causes a reaction
[2:51:27] and that reaction should be to remember
[2:51:31] Passover
[2:51:33] communion Is Not For a Moment
[2:51:37] you have entered in
[2:51:39] Passover
[2:51:41] every day it should be eating the lamb
[2:51:45] every day it should be drinking of his
[2:51:47] life
[2:51:49] every day it should be a day of worship
[2:51:53] communion
[2:51:55] this communion that you're having right
[2:51:58] here is not the communion that he wants
[2:52:01] it's only representing
[2:52:04] we're doing this to cause us to stop
[2:52:07] remember
[2:52:10] the price he paid
[2:52:13] remember the part you're to be
[2:52:17] now when you're apart from each other
[2:52:20] remember you can't go out in the world
[2:52:22] and be like them
[2:52:25] then we'll go to foot washing
[2:52:33] that moment of
[2:52:35] taking your shoes off and submitting
[2:52:37] yourself to another to wash
[2:52:39] somebody else in humility watching yours
[2:52:42] is an ordinance
[2:52:44] but it's not what God wants
[2:52:48] it only is representing what God wants
[2:52:53] he wants you to remember
[2:52:57] that as you associate with one another
[2:53:00] you got a job to do and that's to serve
[2:53:04] you're not really here to be served
[2:53:08] you hear to serve
[2:53:12] so the really part of foot washing that
[2:53:15] is important isn't you getting your feet
[2:53:17] washed
[2:53:19] you watching somebody else's feet
[2:53:24] and Jesus
[2:53:25] would have this discussion with his
[2:53:27] disciples and he would say
[2:53:33] I'm going to wash your feet and Peter
[2:53:35] said oh no oh no
[2:53:37] you know it wasn't mine
[2:53:40] no I'm not going to let you stoop down
[2:53:42] and be that humble and watch mine no ah
[2:53:46] Jesus said you don't know what I'm doing
[2:53:50] but I'll tell you this Peter if I don't
[2:53:52] wash your feet you have no part with me
[2:53:54] and he said oh if it's that way he
[2:53:56] didn't wash my heads my hands and my
[2:53:59] whole body will just wash everything and
[2:54:00] Jesus said no
[2:54:02] I'm only going to wash your feet
[2:54:05] because he that has been washed is
[2:54:07] already clean
[2:54:10] because in that day in the bath houses
[2:54:13] they would wash the bodies
[2:54:15] and clean but then they would have to
[2:54:18] walk from that
[2:54:20] through the trails the dusty roads and
[2:54:23] whatever else and there were the animals
[2:54:25] had dropped their droppings and so on
[2:54:27] was there in the dirt and the grime
[2:54:30] and so
[2:54:33] they had all been washed
[2:54:36] Jesus had breathed on them and said now
[2:54:38] you're clean to the word that I speak to
[2:54:40] you
[2:54:41] they'd had Washings
[2:54:44] you've been washed
[2:54:45] you've been cleansed by the Holy Ghost
[2:54:47] and Washed by the Water of the word
[2:54:50] but now
[2:54:53] since that time you had to walk through
[2:54:56] the path of life
[2:54:59] a lot of Filth and dirt all around you
[2:55:02] and your feet get dirty
[2:55:05] [Music]
[2:55:06] you just keep remembering
[2:55:09] you do need your feet washed
[2:55:11] [Music]
[2:55:13] just keep remembering you got to get
[2:55:15] humble enough that when the word Goes
[2:55:17] Forth you'll let it wash the dirt off
[2:55:19] your feet
[2:55:20] just remember you're here to serve to
[2:55:23] encourage somebody along the road
[2:55:25] along the way and wash the dirt off
[2:55:27] their feet said brother don't listen to
[2:55:30] that kind of stuff
[2:55:31] don't don't repeat that gossip
[2:55:34] don't do that don't live that long and
[2:55:37] you wash the dirt off you encourage
[2:55:40] somebody along the road
[2:55:42] you're here to encourage one another
[2:55:45] remember what this is about
[2:55:49] [Music]
[2:55:51] remember the blessing that God has given
[2:55:53] you
[2:55:55] by allowing you
[2:55:58] to have a part
[2:56:01] by making you a part of this body for
[2:56:04] making you peace of the bread
[2:56:07] remember
[2:56:09] without the others it's not a whole loaf
[2:56:14] we need one another
[2:56:17] so encourage one another
[2:56:19] love one another
[2:56:22] bless one another at a fine build up one
[2:56:25] another
[2:56:27] and when you hear someone being torn
[2:56:29] down
[2:56:30] lift them up
[2:56:32] encourage
[2:56:34] strengthen
[2:56:35] take a load off
[2:56:38] now
[2:56:41] what we're going to do
[2:56:44] is the ushers are going to come and by
[2:56:46] the road they'll bring
[2:56:47] you down in two lines and you'll come
[2:56:49] from this way and you'll go out down
[2:56:51] these aisles
[2:56:53] so you'll be taken down this aisle and
[2:56:55] down this
[2:56:57] and and when you do you take your
[2:57:01] communion in the bread you go right
[2:57:03] straight out to these doors and the men
[2:57:06] will go to the right to this hallways
[2:57:07] here and the women will go that way to
[2:57:09] where they're set up there and then
