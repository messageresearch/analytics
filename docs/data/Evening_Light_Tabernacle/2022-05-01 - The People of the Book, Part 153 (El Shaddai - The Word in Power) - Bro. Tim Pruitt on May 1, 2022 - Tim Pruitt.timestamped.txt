[45:55] [Music]
[45:57] i think about life's journey
[46:03] and
[46:06] ones that go with us in life's journey
[46:09] one that we join with in battle
[46:12] ones that we fight together with against
[46:15] the enemy
[46:19] on wednesday night
[46:21] while i was in service i got
[46:23] notification of
[46:25] that brother harold hildebrandt
[46:28] has crossed over on the other side
[46:32] he has been suffering with parkinson for
[46:34] some time
[46:37] um
[46:39] for a long time he suffered with
[46:41] parkinson's over a decade i think
[46:45] and the other day with just a
[46:48] little cold maybe not feeling the best
[46:50] but
[46:51] just pitched over and left us
[46:54] just one breath away is another
[46:55] dimension
[46:57] he's not dead he's still living
[47:00] he's just out of our reach and out of
[47:02] our sight for the time
[47:05] of course you can see there
[47:08] on the right was brother donnie reagan
[47:10] brother harold hildebrand with a buried
[47:12] coffee and i'm not sure who that other
[47:13] person is
[47:16] but as we think about it
[47:19] i kind of put it in your
[47:22] in your view because many of you younger
[47:24] ones don't remember brother harold
[47:26] perhaps
[47:28] he wasn't
[47:29] you know active in the ministry for the
[47:31] last
[47:33] 10 years or so
[47:35] because of the parkinson's or preached
[47:37] very limited
[47:38] and his home church still tried to be
[47:41] the pastor right up to the end
[47:44] they just had an 80th birthday
[47:46] celebration for him
[47:48] but the harold and i
[47:50] traveled all over africa together in
[47:53] nigeria and cameroon
[47:56] and tanzania and kenya and uganda
[48:01] i saw the great work that he did
[48:03] firsthand
[48:07] brother john laid testified of going to
[48:09] his church and in his church they would
[48:11] reprint
[48:13] books that you couldn't get
[48:15] and supplied all of africa actually all
[48:17] the world
[48:19] even we benefited from them we received
[48:21] some of the books and was able to share
[48:24] them with believers
[48:27] and
[48:29] this is over in uganda
[48:31] where that
[48:33] the believers there are just now
[48:34] receiving
[48:36] the new books that we have
[48:39] on the original sin and the five comings
[48:42] of elijah and jesus the name above all
[48:44] names
[48:47] we just sent funding for that
[48:50] what are these for these are for
[48:51] outreach
[48:53] things that i've written there to try to
[48:55] help them displace it in the scripture
[48:58] if you don't have them we have them at
[48:59] in our library i found that they not
[49:02] only help for outreach but they also
[49:05] strengthen the faith of believers
[49:07] because you can just place it right in
[49:09] the word
[49:10] this man brother harold was a pioneer
[49:13] started out many years ago in home
[49:15] meetings in edmonton
[49:18] grabbed the message
[49:19] took it around the world he heard the
[49:21] great commission
[49:22] that this message must be preached
[49:25] a lot of the footprint of the message in
[49:28] many foreign countries
[49:30] was on account of brother harold
[49:32] hildebrand
[49:33] he's the one who's helped establish
[49:36] hundreds of churches across the world
[49:40] but now he's stepped over into another
[49:42] dimension
[49:44] we remember him preaching our youth camp
[49:47] and also preaching
[49:49] in our labor day meetings the ones we
[49:51] held in
[49:52] mendon in the
[49:54] civic
[49:55] auditorium
[49:56] the ones we held in our church
[50:00] he was a powerful preacher
[50:03] a man of god
[50:06] god used him in a special way
[50:09] i just want to take a moment just to bow
[50:12] our heads and
[50:14] just
[50:15] stop here just for a moment and just
[50:17] think
[50:19] of god sending
[50:21] and using this servant
[50:23] to bless us with
[50:26] i remember him being
[50:28] with us
[50:30] brother daniel williams
[50:32] funeral and
[50:34] the memorial service there and
[50:37] the wonderful things that he said
[50:41] i remember
[50:49] daniel's love for him
[50:51] [Music]
[50:52] now they're together
[50:54] on the other side
[50:57] they are waiting on us to come to
[51:01] that place that god has ordained for us
[51:07] they're waiting
[51:11] what for
[51:13] for us to get to the point
[51:16] where the rapture can take place where
[51:18] they can come back here they're longing
[51:20] on to take on bodies again
[51:22] [Music]
[51:24] they were made for the earth
[51:26] and they're coming back to earth and
[51:27] taking earthly bodies and
[51:29] with us go away for a
[51:32] marriage supper and then come back for a
[51:35] wonderful millennial honeymoon
[51:38] spend eternity together
[51:42] this is what heaven's all about
[51:46] this is a place of reparation
[51:49] god's been so good to you
[51:52] i wonder what will be said of your life
[51:54] when you stand at the end
[51:57] what will be said of me
[52:01] have i made enough efforts have it done
[52:03] enough
[52:05] brother branham would look back at his
[52:06] own life and he said
[52:09] 50 years old i've done nothing for the
[52:11] lord
[52:12] [Music]
[52:16] great men have went before us
[52:19] done great things

[52:25] tighter now

[55:23] quickly so you can be seated you've been
[55:25] standing a little while
[55:27] genesis chapter 17 and verse 1
[55:31] and when abram was 90 years old and nine
[55:34] the lord appeared to abram and said unto
[55:36] him i am the almighty god
[55:39] walk before me and be thou perfect
[55:42] and i will make my covenant between me
[55:44] and thee
[55:45] and will multiply thee exceedingly and
[55:48] abram fell on his face and god talked
[55:50] with him saying
[55:52] and then drop down to verse 21 but my
[55:55] covenant will allah establish with isaac
[55:58] which sarah shall bear unto thee at this
[56:01] set time in the next year
[56:03] and he left off talking with him and god
[56:06] went up from abraham
[56:08] amen may you be
[56:10] be seated
[56:12] we thank god for his word today
[56:15] amen it's just
[56:17] so wonderful to see one of you today and
[56:21] we're looking to the lord to speak to
[56:22] our hearts and reveal himself
[56:26] brother timothy and i will be going to
[56:27] the memorial service we'll leave out
[56:29] thursday and
[56:31] and um i will be speaking that memorial
[56:34] service on saturday and be with the
[56:36] church there on sunday timothy will also
[56:38] be ministered
[56:40] in the area to with brother jerry fury
[56:43] and and um
[56:45] you know we only had a little short
[56:46] window of coming back home
[56:49] and um and then leaving to go to
[56:52] cloverdale for their 50th
[56:54] anniversary so
[56:56] we changed our tickets and so we'll be
[56:58] gone for the next couple of weeks
[57:01] but don't worry we've got a great
[57:02] ministry here
[57:04] i did want to announce to you that um we
[57:07] have done some very
[57:09] uh serious prayer and um
[57:13] thinking about what we could do as a
[57:15] church body
[57:16] and um
[57:18] to do greater things for the lord as we
[57:21] believe we're here in the end time
[57:24] we
[57:24] have um we have moved to support brother
[57:28] joe adams and his ministry he's going to
[57:31] be going full time
[57:33] and representing our church as he goes
[57:35] forth
[57:36] also brother aaron oglesby is going to
[57:38] be finishing up the school year and then
[57:40] he'll be going full time in the ministry
[57:42] as well
[57:43] we're also supporting him
[57:45] and there in order that
[57:48] um you know honestly you can't live on
[57:51] what offerings you get out by going out
[57:54] and preaching but they'll not only just
[57:56] be going out i've asked them to
[57:58] also be aware that we need them here
[58:02] amen and we're going to be
[58:05] using them utilizing their ministry and
[58:07] also
[58:08] already brother joe has moved out since
[58:11] he's already stopped work
[58:14] you know you
[58:15] you don't wrap your mind around
[58:18] exactly what is happening here you know
[58:20] when you when you
[58:22] when you can turn down um two hundred
[58:25] thousand dollar plus salary to go full
[58:28] time for the lord and
[58:29] you don't make even uh uh you know near
[58:33] near that just something to pay your
[58:35] expenses and
[58:36] and uh
[58:37] you know hardly to progress so you know
[58:40] again we
[58:42] we um
[58:43] we're just admire that kind of um you
[58:47] know work brother brother aaron is
[58:49] leaving a work that he has um
[58:51] um just a few years from retirement from
[58:55] that he could take a retirement
[58:57] um
[58:58] uh pay and so you know there's a lot of
[59:00] things that are being given up
[59:02] to press the battle for the last laps
[59:06] and we also are wanting to do everything
[59:09] we can to encourage the bride of christ
[59:12] i will be going out again
[59:15] more that than what i have and and
[59:18] trying to strengthen encourage preaching
[59:21] conventions and
[59:22] yet at the same time prayerfully using
[59:24] our time and so we as a church body were
[59:28] we're wanting to affect the world or
[59:31] wherever that the lord would lead
[59:34] and there's just lots and lots of work
[59:37] to be done
[59:38] as we finish the race now a lot of that
[59:41] work we can do right here and when i say
[59:43] that we are reaching around the world
[59:47] um japan will listen to this message
[59:50] in the archives it's because they're
[59:53] their times are different and also the
[59:55] um
[59:57] we we have a wonderful work there of
[1:00:00] course they're
[1:00:01] they don't belong to us they belong to
[1:00:03] god but we have helped established and
[1:00:05] got a picture from them today
[1:00:08] a wonderful work they're doing there a
[1:00:10] revival fire is going through uganda
[1:00:13] where there is hundreds upon thousands
[1:00:17] of
[1:00:17] churches now that are just embracing the
[1:00:21] message
[1:00:22] and they uh they need establishing in
[1:00:25] the present truth and that's why then i
[1:00:27] wrote this booklet on the godhead
[1:00:30] and i i'd like you to show that all
[1:00:32] these books that they're printing right
[1:00:34] there
[1:00:35] on um that we have we have put out on
[1:00:38] the five chemins of elijah this one
[1:00:41] establishes that god uses the spirit of
[1:00:43] elijah five times and it um identifies
[1:00:47] the comings of elijah and their
[1:00:50] ministries and where that they go
[1:00:53] um around around um in the end time
[1:00:56] where they fit in the end time picture
[1:00:59] and of course this is as i said one
[1:01:01] jesus name above all names on
[1:01:03] on the godhead and on water baptism and
[1:01:06] this is on the original sin
[1:01:08] which is again the um
[1:01:11] about the tree of knowledge of good and
[1:01:13] evil and what really happened in the
[1:01:14] garden and so we have done that to
[1:01:17] establish them where that
[1:01:20] um because because for example you know
[1:01:23] we have some wonderful things brother
[1:01:25] branham taught but we don't have it all
[1:01:27] in one
[1:01:29] one picture you got to get it from many
[1:01:31] tapes
[1:01:32] so we took those concepts and just
[1:01:35] placed it in the scripture
[1:01:36] and used the scripture to show this is a
[1:01:39] bible doctrine
[1:01:41] and so again the these are very
[1:01:44] important to the people there and we are
[1:01:47] we are helping them to get established
[1:01:49] this is an area
[1:01:51] that uh have not been established in the
[1:01:54] message that
[1:01:56] that brother bazabosi has going there
[1:01:59] and helping them to get further
[1:02:01] established in the present truth
[1:02:04] so there's a lot of things that are
[1:02:05] happening a lot of places that are
[1:02:08] calling many people that are desiring
[1:02:11] and um you know even um
[1:02:13] uh
[1:02:15] you know this this wonderful tent
[1:02:17] meeting brother
[1:02:18] ron spencer was in last night and of
[1:02:21] course they've had other ministers the
[1:02:23] brother jonathan martin brother wendell
[1:02:25] martin different others
[1:02:26] that have ministered i don't know their
[1:02:29] lineup of ministry but andrew glover i
[1:02:31] know ministered there in the tent
[1:02:33] meeting largest
[1:02:35] gathering of people in north america
[1:02:37] that brother ron has ever seen to come
[1:02:40] and hear the message
[1:02:41] so again you know it's a a great revival
[1:02:46] that is going on a stir
[1:02:48] um you know the devil thought he would
[1:02:50] do something with covet and shut us down
[1:02:52] it backfired on him
[1:02:54] there's a great hunger in the hearts of
[1:02:56] people
[1:02:57] let's get out to the meetings you know
[1:03:00] these things were spoke about um for
[1:03:03] example brother biscuit would talk about
[1:03:05] how he got on a motorcycle and drove all
[1:03:08] day and freezing weather and and then
[1:03:10] stop it you know at a house where he saw
[1:03:13] a light and pull up there and a man
[1:03:16] invite him in and he spend the night
[1:03:18] there some guy doesn't even know and you
[1:03:21] know and then he feeds him a meal and
[1:03:23] puts him on the road to go again he
[1:03:25] drives again all the day there was a
[1:03:28] burning in the hearts
[1:03:30] to
[1:03:31] to get into those meetings and they
[1:03:34] talked about the holy spirit of god
[1:03:37] fallen in those meetings and and one
[1:03:39] side speaking you know of of um the lord
[1:03:43] being mighty in battle and you know and
[1:03:45] then the other side waving back and
[1:03:48] forth just waves upon waves of the glory
[1:03:51] of god
[1:03:52] and i you know i i i know we have the
[1:03:55] word today
[1:03:57] we have the message
[1:03:58] and i believe that we can have those
[1:04:00] same things
[1:04:01] that are happening that happen back
[1:04:04] there happening right here
[1:04:06] because we are here in one of the
[1:04:08] mightiest revivals you say when did this
[1:04:10] revival start it started by the opening
[1:04:13] of the word with a prophet coming with a
[1:04:16] message
[1:04:17] and even brother branham told us in 1965
[1:04:20] the move is on for the bride that's thus
[1:04:23] saith the lord
[1:04:24] we've had 56 years of of of just
[1:04:28] absorbing the message and
[1:04:30] and and get it in our you know all of it
[1:04:34] you know at our fingertips and where we
[1:04:36] could hear it and where we could
[1:04:37] research it where we could comb through
[1:04:39] it we've had 56 years of that
[1:04:42] but i tell you what we are right now in
[1:04:44] the final stages and i believe the word
[1:04:47] that we have been hearing has become
[1:04:49] flesh
[1:04:50] and so because it's become flesh it's
[1:04:53] going to be made manifest
[1:04:55] now so again um today we're going to be
[1:04:58] speaking on el shaddai the word in power
[1:05:02] we have been ministering on this subject
[1:05:05] of el shaddai
[1:05:06] because the appearing of god as el
[1:05:10] shaddai
[1:05:11] was um a a picture of a type a shadow
[1:05:16] that was prophesying of the last days
[1:05:20] now they didn't know they were
[1:05:21] prophesying
[1:05:23] they didn't realize that this was
[1:05:25] something that god was showing in type
[1:05:27] that he would do
[1:05:29] in the latter days
[1:05:31] and then the appearance of god as el
[1:05:33] shaddai was a personal experience with
[1:05:36] god to abraham and it was more than an
[1:05:40] anointing yet it wasn't an anoint an
[1:05:42] anointing
[1:05:44] this experience anointed and raised his
[1:05:47] faith to look for the promised son
[1:05:51] and of course this anointing that we
[1:05:53] have been anointed with in this last day
[1:05:55] by god's sin and a prophet
[1:05:58] has um has raised our faith to look for
[1:06:01] the promised son now it's not just god's
[1:06:04] sin and a prophet
[1:06:05] but it is that we also have been brought
[1:06:08] into a personal experience
[1:06:11] with god himself
[1:06:13] now you know again when this happened
[1:06:16] with abraham and expectation
[1:06:19] seized him
[1:06:20] as he pondered over the things that
[1:06:23] almighty god had said
[1:06:26] now we also as a royal seed of abraham
[1:06:29] have had the appearance of el shaddai
[1:06:33] the outpouring of the holy ghost in this
[1:06:35] last day is raised faith to believe for
[1:06:39] the long-awaited promised son to appear
[1:06:43] now as we speak of that i want you to
[1:06:45] understand
[1:06:47] we are anointed there's no shame in
[1:06:49] being anointed
[1:06:51] in fact of the matter is great favor to
[1:06:53] be anointed
[1:06:54] if you look there when jesus would open
[1:06:57] the scripture he said he said the spirit
[1:06:59] of the lord is upon me
[1:07:02] and it has anointed me to preach the
[1:07:04] gospel
[1:07:05] so again we are here in the last day
[1:07:08] where that spirit that was anointing
[1:07:11] jesus now came and anointed the church
[1:07:14] on the day of pentecost
[1:07:16] it is a continual anointed we could go
[1:07:19] and say well it anointed wesley and
[1:07:21] anointed luther and it anointed azusa
[1:07:25] street but now that anointing is resting
[1:07:28] upon a people in this last day
[1:07:31] now so
[1:07:32] you know sometimes the thought is oh but
[1:07:35] you know we don't want to be anointed
[1:07:37] because we don't want to be the anointed
[1:07:39] ones at the end time but i want to say
[1:07:42] yes we do
[1:07:43] we have better be the anointed ones at
[1:07:45] the end time we are the anointed ones at
[1:07:49] the end time
[1:07:50] the anointing wasn't sent from the for
[1:07:53] the chair
[1:07:54] it was sent for the wheat
[1:07:56] and we want the anointing
[1:07:59] we want to be anointed preachers with
[1:08:02] anointed sermons
[1:08:04] we want anointed singers who sing
[1:08:07] anointed songs we want anointed people
[1:08:11] and anointed churches and an anointed
[1:08:14] word we want men and women who know how
[1:08:18] to get in the spirit
[1:08:20] you see we are
[1:08:22] our name is not unbelief we're not going
[1:08:25] down in defeat
[1:08:27] we are that faith woman who like sarah
[1:08:30] this princess is a mother and she's
[1:08:33] bringing forth the king line and we are
[1:08:36] we are united as a princess to our lord
[1:08:39] the king
[1:08:41] and so you know sarah received strength
[1:08:43] by judging him faithful who had made the
[1:08:47] promise but she had to quit putting
[1:08:50] limits on god
[1:08:51] we must not ever put limits on him as
[1:08:54] brother bradham said jesus christ is the
[1:08:56] same yesterday today and forever his
[1:08:59] power is unlimited but it's limited to
[1:09:02] your faith do you believe it that's
[1:09:04] confirmed among thousand times thousands
[1:09:07] of people so his power is unlimited but
[1:09:10] yet it's limited to your faith your
[1:09:12] faith can limit god
[1:09:14] your lack of taking hold of the promise
[1:09:18] is the only thing is going to limit god
[1:09:20] from fulfilling the needs that's in your
[1:09:22] life
[1:09:24] amen so it's like but it's like god told
[1:09:27] gary walker when he went through his
[1:09:29] great trial of a of the horrible wreck
[1:09:32] he said if you could see the bigger
[1:09:34] picture you would sign up for this
[1:09:37] and i want you to know whatever you're
[1:09:39] going through if you could just see the
[1:09:41] bigger picture
[1:09:43] it is it is an opportunity for god to
[1:09:46] work it is an opportunity for us to
[1:09:49] exercise faith
[1:09:51] it is an it is an opportunity for god to
[1:09:54] fulfill his word to show himself in a
[1:09:58] miraculous miracle working power so you
[1:10:02] see well you know again we we want to
[1:10:05] look at the bigger picture you look at
[1:10:07] the problem you look at the issue and
[1:10:10] you know you know we look at brother ron
[1:10:12] and the horrible trial that he has been
[1:10:15] through but you know when he preached
[1:10:17] last night with such power and showed
[1:10:20] the world a miracle
[1:10:22] are you with me i mean if he dies
[1:10:24] tomorrow he's been one of the greatest
[1:10:26] miracles that you've ever witnessed amen
[1:10:30] because because again god has shown
[1:10:32] himself in power over and over and over
[1:10:37] again
[1:10:38] amen so you see we want to see the
[1:10:40] bigger picture of things
[1:10:43] and and again you know this was abraham
[1:10:46] he was walking with god but he couldn't
[1:10:48] see the bigger picture
[1:10:50] why and god was trying to expand his
[1:10:53] vision by the visitation of el shaddai
[1:10:57] and and even with with sarah
[1:11:00] god rebuked sarah when she laughed when
[1:11:02] she snickered at the thought of the
[1:11:05] impossibility of a 90 year old having a
[1:11:08] baby
[1:11:09] you saying and god rebuked her saying is
[1:11:13] there anything that is too hard for the
[1:11:16] lord
[1:11:16] i tell you sometimes we need a rebuking
[1:11:20] doubting snickering at the old woman to
[1:11:23] church to have signs of life
[1:11:26] amen
[1:11:27] snickering that she might speak in
[1:11:29] tongues or prophesy or see evidence of
[1:11:33] the holy spirit working in our lives
[1:11:36] that the young people in all the life
[1:11:38] can receive a true experience
[1:11:40] of the baptism of the holy ghost that's
[1:11:43] miraculous
[1:11:44] amen but you see why would we doubt and
[1:11:47] snicker that the old woman the church
[1:11:50] can come to such a place that she could
[1:11:53] be changed in a moment in a twinkling of
[1:11:56] an eye that she too can receive the
[1:11:59] promised son that has been looked for
[1:12:01] for many many years that many have given
[1:12:04] up all but we're not giving up on the
[1:12:06] promise amen we're not giving away up on
[1:12:10] what god said there is to be a
[1:12:11] resurrection in our day
[1:12:14] and all the dead in christ arise there
[1:12:16] is to be a change in the body
[1:12:19] all of these things are are laying in
[1:12:21] here the greatest of the miracles that
[1:12:24] has ever happened i want to expand your
[1:12:27] vision and let you see we are here on
[1:12:30] the verge of the greatest miracles ever
[1:12:33] happened the chains of the body the
[1:12:35] resurrection of the dead
[1:12:40] we're not just skeletons come to life
[1:12:42] but dust gathers together every cell and
[1:12:46] comes back
[1:12:54] what hour are we living in
[1:13:00] el shaddai gives a promise
[1:13:03] i'm going to give sarah baby
[1:13:09] what does that mean
[1:13:11] why is it that god would even do this
[1:13:15] you think it was just to make a jewish
[1:13:18] race no the jewish race was was a
[1:13:21] natural seed and when they were
[1:13:23] prophesying
[1:13:25] god used them to prophesy of a royal
[1:13:28] seed
[1:13:32] now
[1:13:33] so again
[1:13:34] how in the world is all of this going to
[1:13:36] happen
[1:13:38] these are maybe the questions that
[1:13:41] that abraham would have when god just
[1:13:43] suddenly abruptly
[1:13:45] left him
[1:13:46] and went up
[1:13:48] and left off talking
[1:13:52] i told you what's going to happen
[1:13:54] it's up to you now to believe it
[1:13:59] now there was a lot of things to stagger
[1:14:02] at
[1:14:04] and i'm telling you there are a lot of
[1:14:06] things in our age to stagger out
[1:14:10] how in the world will god get a people
[1:14:12] to the place they need to be in this
[1:14:15] evil age
[1:14:17] and god lets it happen the worst stage
[1:14:19] ever
[1:14:24] the time where sodom repeats
[1:14:28] the time where evil abounds
[1:14:30] like never before
[1:14:34] and in that moment
[1:14:36] el shaddai comes
[1:14:38] what is elsa it is the baptism of the
[1:14:41] holy ghost it is an outpouring of the
[1:14:43] spirit
[1:14:45] brother branham told his clothed crick
[1:14:47] clearly el shaddai is the holy ghost
[1:14:51] and this is where in type that abraham
[1:14:54] receives the holy ghost now we know the
[1:14:57] holy ghost was not yet given
[1:14:59] but god is showing up of a greater event
[1:15:02] that is going to happen when a people
[1:15:05] receive not a part of the spirit of god
[1:15:10] enough to justify your sanctify your
[1:15:12] speaking tongue but the entire spirit of
[1:15:15] god coming down into a people
[1:15:24] this is unusual service
[1:15:27] i feel the holy ghost all over me
[1:15:30] i want you to be really
[1:15:32] intent let the holy spirit speak to you
[1:15:36] by
[1:15:37] how in the world is this old woman
[1:15:40] going to have this child
[1:15:43] it will be by drinking from el shaddai
[1:15:48] you know by baptism after baptism of the
[1:15:50] holy ghost
[1:15:53] i don't care who you are it's time for
[1:15:55] another baptism
[1:15:58] amen we must drink until our bodies are
[1:16:01] changed
[1:16:02] we can drink divine healing we can drink
[1:16:05] miracles we can drink anything
[1:16:07] any promise it's all there there is no
[1:16:10] lack we must not stagger at god's
[1:16:12] promise nothing is too big for you to
[1:16:15] believe for
[1:16:17] instead of doubting we got to turn to
[1:16:20] praise
[1:16:22] amen and we will praise him because he's
[1:16:24] more than enough
[1:16:26] and i said why shouldn't we we've had
[1:16:28] enough miracles just built in this
[1:16:30] church building to see that god is more
[1:16:32] than enough you see if god is your
[1:16:35] partner you better have big plans
[1:16:38] amen because we are here in the
[1:16:41] continuation of the book of acts
[1:16:44] abraham considered not the cancer or the
[1:16:47] brain bleed or the seizures or the old
[1:16:50] age or the sickness
[1:16:53] i'm telling you right now you don't even
[1:16:55] have to consider your old age well it's
[1:16:57] just normal for me to be this way no it
[1:17:00] ain't normal that it don't have to be
[1:17:03] your normal you can be a healthy well 90
[1:17:07] year old it doesn't matter
[1:17:12] it is it should be normal to believe for
[1:17:15] the impossible it should be normal to
[1:17:18] believe for divine healing it should be
[1:17:21] what we do
[1:17:28] i heard of a couple of skirt ladies that
[1:17:30] was in a in a place i got a testimony
[1:17:33] from a lady kathy jeffers and her her
[1:17:36] aunt was given a testimony of how she
[1:17:38] went into a cracker barrel
[1:17:41] and there
[1:17:42] they you know she carried her her aging
[1:17:45] uh family member i think it was a mother
[1:17:47] and and and there she was in in there in
[1:17:50] the cracker barrel and then and uh they
[1:17:53] were trying to have a meal together her
[1:17:56] sister and the aged mother and she
[1:17:59] dropped dead the aids mother just
[1:18:00] dropped dead right at the table
[1:18:04] and here in this in this um
[1:18:06] in this moment
[1:18:08] you know they begin to scream out we
[1:18:10] need somebody who can pray
[1:18:12] and and she said a bunch of these these
[1:18:15] she called them holy rollers
[1:18:18] holy rollers with long dresses come over
[1:18:21] and laid hands on her and she raised
[1:18:23] back to life again
[1:18:26] said they had pair they had people there
[1:18:28] that were trained to know whether
[1:18:30] somebody was dead or not and took her
[1:18:32] vitals and she was gone
[1:18:35] but you see these skirt ladies come
[1:18:36] running over there and laid hands on her
[1:18:43] amen you know and and and then you know
[1:18:46] they carried them out and the ladies
[1:18:47] went right back to eating their lunch
[1:18:49] she cracked a barrel as if this is
[1:18:51] something we do every day
[1:18:54] and i'll tell you what this ought to be
[1:18:56] the attitude of the bride of christ
[1:19:01] that even among our ladies they know we
[1:19:03] can lay hands on the sick and they shall
[1:19:06] recover we know what to do
[1:19:10] because of who we are
[1:19:12] [Applause]
[1:19:16] a people filled with the holy ghost of
[1:19:18] people prayed up
[1:19:20] are people who know their god and does
[1:19:22] exploits
[1:19:28] a people that only consider what god
[1:19:30] says
[1:19:34] who turns bad situations
[1:19:39] from unbelief to a praise
[1:19:43] he staggered not at the promise of god
[1:19:45] through unbelief but he was strong in
[1:19:48] faith giving glory to god
[1:19:50] so the devil wants to cut off our praise
[1:19:53] yet that's the way uh that's the way of
[1:19:56] giving voice to our victory
[1:19:58] we overcome by the blood the lamb and
[1:20:00] the word of our testimony
[1:20:02] amen when we drink from our shady eye it
[1:20:05] brings the praise out of our life
[1:20:08] come on now listen when the lamb opened
[1:20:11] the book in heaven heaven worshiped and
[1:20:14] sang a new song
[1:20:15] amen whatever they do in heaven we ought
[1:20:18] to do the same thing on earth when the
[1:20:21] book is open to you
[1:20:24] you're going to sing a new song and have
[1:20:28] a new worship and you're going to
[1:20:30] worship the lamb
[1:20:32] hallelujah
[1:20:37] it seems that human nature
[1:20:40] needs both order and freedom
[1:20:42] amen that's kind of human nature we want
[1:20:45] both order
[1:20:47] and freedom
[1:20:49] and many of us
[1:20:50] handle the split and our needs by
[1:20:52] keeping order in our religious life
[1:20:56] and leaving freedom to ball games and
[1:20:58] political rallies
[1:21:03] that's the way we split it up
[1:21:05] we're going to order in church
[1:21:09] but we want freedom at a ball game
[1:21:14] amen
[1:21:15] my goodness we ought to have freedom at
[1:21:17] church
[1:21:19] and there ought to be a praise come
[1:21:20] forth from the church
[1:21:22] there's got to be an amen to the word of
[1:21:24] god there's going to be a response had
[1:21:26] he right you don't sit there and just
[1:21:28] nod your head you respond and say that's
[1:21:31] nothing but the truth
[1:21:33] and that's a way to get god to move back
[1:21:36] to you
[1:21:42] but you know
[1:21:43] let me just tell you from the bible how
[1:21:45] they handled the split
[1:21:48] how that they
[1:21:50] they handled it
[1:21:52] as human nature as i said needs both
[1:21:54] seems to need both order
[1:21:57] and freedom
[1:21:58] so they get freedom at ball games
[1:22:00] freedom at political rallies
[1:22:03] but all we got this sanctimonious
[1:22:06] nobody's supposed to say nothing in
[1:22:08] church let's read it from psalms 150
[1:22:15] let's see how to handle it in the bible

[1:22:21] where praise god in his sanctuary

[1:36:39] going to have our isaac
[1:36:42] laughter is coming
[1:36:44] the bride will bring forth
[1:36:54] you know why
[1:36:55] because el shaddai
[1:36:58] who represents all the word
[1:37:01] all of god
[1:37:07] it represents an open book
[1:37:11] exposing the breasts of the old and new
[1:37:14] testament
[1:37:15] all the bible
[1:37:18] from genesis to revelation
[1:37:21] divine promises
[1:37:24] lay it there and it's not exposed to
[1:37:26] everybody
[1:37:28] you say the seventh seal brother jim is
[1:37:30] not revealed is not revealed to many
[1:37:32] people
[1:37:34] amen but it has been revealed to the
[1:37:36] bride of christ
[1:37:38] are you with me amen nothing is held
[1:37:41] back because why you have been brought
[1:37:43] into the secret place
[1:37:46] where god comes and gives you his own
[1:37:49] life
[1:37:53] now all the word is heading up into her
[1:37:56] brother branham says this in god of this
[1:37:58] evil age he types it like the grain of
[1:38:01] wheat heads up into the grain again
[1:38:04] where it started from
[1:38:09] the grain of wheat heads up to the grain
[1:38:12] again
[1:38:13] where it started from
[1:38:17] let me stop there for a minute
[1:38:20] do you know we're fulfilling all the
[1:38:22] types
[1:38:25] or every promise that spoke of a bride
[1:38:27] is being fulfilled in you
[1:38:32] you are you are the absolute fulfillment
[1:38:36] of all scripture
[1:38:40] everything that spoke of the bride of
[1:38:41] course since they spoke about the harlot
[1:38:43] that ain't us
[1:38:44] there's things spoke about tribulation
[1:38:46] saints that ain't us
[1:38:48] there's things spoken about foolish
[1:38:49] virgin that ain't us
[1:38:52] but every word that spoke of the bride
[1:38:56] is being manifest in bride form today
[1:39:03] luther only represented a part wesley
[1:39:05] represented a part it was portions of
[1:39:08] the spirit
[1:39:12] think about that for a moment
[1:39:15] you see
[1:39:16] we will say
[1:39:18] there when they when they come into that
[1:39:20] place
[1:39:21] they began with the cross
[1:39:24] and that's where a lot of people are
[1:39:27] a glory in the cross
[1:39:30] you know the cross the cross and the
[1:39:32] message you know jimmy swaggart if you
[1:39:34] ever hear hear him speak he'll talk
[1:39:36] about some mysterious thing that they
[1:39:38] got on the cross
[1:39:40] revelation on the cross i know what it
[1:39:42] is
[1:39:43] you know when you come to the cross you
[1:39:44] live any kind of dirty life and you're
[1:39:46] forgiven you're okay because you're at
[1:39:48] the cross
[1:39:51] so i know his secret it's a dirty one
[1:39:55] but that's the dirty secret of most
[1:39:57] denominations
[1:39:59] that's why we're at the cross
[1:40:02] and god forgives us of our sins and
[1:40:04] jesus paid the price
[1:40:09] and we glory in the cross
[1:40:14] but i tell you there's things of his
[1:40:15] revealing of his purchasing work you
[1:40:19] know that he began at calvary expands to
[1:40:22] his claimant work
[1:40:24] where he claims the title deed
[1:40:27] for every believer
[1:40:30] because you are the names in the book
[1:40:34] are you with me it's a revelation of god
[1:40:38] personally to you where he comes into
[1:40:40] you and and he opens the book
[1:40:43] he looses the seals
[1:40:46] he unbuttons himself
[1:40:55] why
[1:40:56] because he's got a child
[1:40:58] and that child needs strength
[1:41:02] now that child's 100 years old
[1:41:06] but it's got a nurse to a body change
[1:41:11] we might be 2 000 years old
[1:41:15] hello sarah
[1:41:17] but we got to nurse your body change
[1:41:20] amen we got to start believing i mean
[1:41:23] come on if we can't believe her divine
[1:41:25] healing brother branham said i can't get
[1:41:27] the church to even believe for divine
[1:41:29] healing which is just just healing a
[1:41:31] portion of your body how am i ever going
[1:41:33] to get you to believe you're going to be
[1:41:35] changed from head to foot
[1:41:37] and you'll travel like a thought
[1:41:44] so he says like the grain of wheat heads
[1:41:47] up in the grain again where it started
[1:41:50] from you know
[1:41:51] so
[1:41:53] we got a couple of types there
[1:41:55] one type is the latter rain
[1:41:58] the latter rain comes as the moisture it
[1:42:01] is the pouring out of the spirit
[1:42:03] he said my range shall fall as doctrine
[1:42:06] but that doctrine is is not just
[1:42:10] law or word only it is spirit and life
[1:42:14] the words that i speak are spirit
[1:42:19] and light
[1:42:22] so you cannot separate the word from the
[1:42:24] spirit
[1:42:25] say well we got the word well if the
[1:42:28] spirit isn't there you don't have the
[1:42:29] word
[1:42:32] amen you say well i got the spirit if
[1:42:34] the word isn't there you don't have the
[1:42:36] spirit
[1:42:39] it takes both of them to make up the
[1:42:42] word the word is spirit and life
[1:42:48] it is also doctrine
[1:42:51] and god brothers doctrine
[1:42:54] and it was a latter rain
[1:42:56] hello
[1:42:58] amen and the and the and the rain fell
[1:43:00] upon us
[1:43:02] it was the anointing of the mighty angel
[1:43:06] like a change of picture it was coming
[1:43:08] down as the anointing of the mighty
[1:43:10] angel
[1:43:11] the son of man the word revealing
[1:43:14] himself and pouring himself out into a
[1:43:16] people
[1:43:21] so it is the latter rain we are part of
[1:43:25] that latter rain because the latter rain
[1:43:28] matures the grain
[1:43:30] for the harvest
[1:43:32] it causes to come back
[1:43:35] to the head again
[1:43:37] that's what this message produces
[1:43:39] another book of acts church
[1:43:46] amen
[1:43:47] now we got another type
[1:43:50] and that other type is we lay in the
[1:43:52] presence of the sun and ripen
[1:43:57] and they're still talking about
[1:43:58] immaturity
[1:44:01] in other words we mature
[1:44:04] by the light of the word
[1:44:08] it has nothing to do with baking out the
[1:44:10] holy ghost
[1:44:12] and tongues and interpretation and
[1:44:14] prophecy and all the other
[1:44:16] manifestations of god it has nothing to
[1:44:19] do with oh divine healing is a greenness
[1:44:22] that's not greenness
[1:44:25] that's the life
[1:44:28] are you with me amen the greenness was
[1:44:31] your immaturity but god sent a message
[1:44:34] to bring you the full word where you're
[1:44:37] not you're not just a partial you're not
[1:44:40] just a little tiny you're not this just
[1:44:42] a shock you're not just a blade you're
[1:44:45] you are you you're not just a sprout but
[1:44:48] you are the grain again
[1:44:54] and he says the word bride like the
[1:44:57] wheat heads up into the head again
[1:44:59] is heading up into the person of the
[1:45:02] word
[1:45:05] it's heading up into the person of the
[1:45:07] word
[1:45:08] of god
[1:45:11] amen the word bride heading up in the
[1:45:15] person of the word of god making
[1:45:18] manifest in this evil age we're living
[1:45:21] in
[1:45:22] so what is happening the word bride is
[1:45:25] heading up in the person of the word
[1:45:30] the word now taken on flesh
[1:45:35] the full word back again
[1:45:38] the person of the word it is the person
[1:45:42] it is heading up to uh and into is not
[1:45:45] brother branham
[1:45:48] never did he point to us
[1:45:50] as him being the uh as him being the
[1:45:52] fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:45:55] amen neither did he point to us any kind
[1:45:59] of personality called leader
[1:46:02] but he did say that the full word would
[1:46:04] be in the church
[1:46:06] she is heading up in the person of the
[1:46:09] word is anybody with me now
[1:46:12] heading up in the person of the word
[1:46:16] that's who the bride is she is the
[1:46:19] person or the body of the word
[1:46:26] this bride is the person of the word
[1:46:28] made manifest manifesting all the word
[1:46:32] every promise
[1:46:34] every gift
[1:46:35] all of his righteousness
[1:46:37] all of his holiness which without no man
[1:46:40] can see the lord
[1:46:42] now look right after expressing himself
[1:46:45] as god almighty he appears to abraham
[1:46:47] and sarah as elohim
[1:46:50] the self-sufficient one
[1:46:52] the eternal one and he deserves
[1:46:54] sarah's heart
[1:46:56] showing the sign of the son of man that
[1:46:58] the word was here in full power
[1:47:09] every time there was a discernment made
[1:47:12] telling who you are where you come from
[1:47:15] what your problem was
[1:47:17] what your what your future holds
[1:47:20] everybody every bit of that was the
[1:47:23] proof it was the sign the word was now
[1:47:27] present because it discerns the thoughts
[1:47:29] and intends the heart only the word
[1:47:33] so it showed us that the son of man was
[1:47:35] present
[1:47:38] not in brother bran a man of pride
[1:47:41] amen brother branham said i challenge
[1:47:44] you to believe that jesus christ is
[1:47:46] revealed in the form of the son of man
[1:47:49] in human flesh through the bride's body
[1:47:54] this is where the word is on display
[1:47:58] amen the sign of the son of man was
[1:48:00] operated through the prophet but you are
[1:48:04] the the you are jesus christ revealed in
[1:48:07] the form of son of man and human flesh
[1:48:10] in the bride's body each one of us
[1:48:12] making up a part
[1:48:15] and you're manifesting the fullness of
[1:48:17] the word not apart
[1:48:22] the bride manifested the son of man
[1:48:24] christ
[1:48:25] his full person his full person
[1:48:29] in bright form
[1:48:36] i want you to get it
[1:48:39] his full person
[1:48:42] not in jesus the man of
[1:48:44] galilee that's where everybody's
[1:48:47] pointing back to
[1:48:49] they're pointing back the man of galilee
[1:48:51] what jesus did what jesus said and all
[1:48:53] of those things are wonderful acts
[1:48:56] and wonderful words
[1:48:58] but that is not who is here today the
[1:49:00] man of galilee is not walking into our
[1:49:03] church
[1:49:04] he's not preaching from our pulpits
[1:49:07] amen i'm talking about the flesh of
[1:49:09] jesus christ but i want you to know that
[1:49:12] the full person of the word is being
[1:49:15] manifest in bright body he is not in the
[1:49:19] form of jesus he is in the form of a
[1:49:22] bride
[1:49:24] don't you understand this is the bride
[1:49:27] coming of christ
[1:49:31] this is what reveals sarah was
[1:49:33] reflecting the bride coming upright a
[1:49:36] woman made new
[1:49:38] restored
[1:49:40] fixed
[1:49:43] i don't mean neutered
[1:49:45] i'm being repaired
[1:49:47] i've been made new
[1:49:51] amen but just a few days later here's a
[1:49:54] young king wants to marry her
[1:49:58] you say why in the world was that story
[1:50:00] in the bible why did they record that
[1:50:02] god wanted you to know the extent of
[1:50:06] sarah's transformation
[1:50:08] because it would reflect the extent of
[1:50:11] your
[1:50:12] transformation
[1:50:14] where you would be made
[1:50:15] young again
[1:50:23] so the bride is manifesting the son of
[1:50:25] man christ
[1:50:26] his full person
[1:50:28] in bride form that
[1:50:32] can you say amen to that
[1:50:34] amen so again
[1:50:36] that makes us
[1:50:38] living
[1:50:39] word of god
[1:50:41] living epistles
[1:50:44] we got epistles written in the bible
[1:50:47] but you are the word written in flesh
[1:50:53] that's who the bride is
[1:50:55] now it makes us a people born of the
[1:50:58] word
[1:51:00] that has power
[1:51:02] amen the living word the living bride a
[1:51:05] word that vibrates with power
[1:51:07] a bride that pulsates with life
[1:51:13] i i just want to get it to you they eat
[1:51:15] the book
[1:51:17] but they don't just eat the book they
[1:51:20] become the book
[1:51:23] amen you eat of things it becomes part
[1:51:26] of your body it nurses cells in your

[2:19:27] faithful

[2:19:31] weakness but he's faithful
[2:19:40] we're meeting devils
[2:19:41] we're casting them out
[2:19:44] we saw it there on the prayer line what
[2:19:47] was it about six years ago a demon there
[2:19:49] when i anointed a young girl you know
[2:19:52] where it came in through the eye
[2:19:55] looking at porn
[2:19:58] she invited the devil to come live with
[2:20:00] her
[2:20:01] and it tormented her
[2:20:05] she comes through the prayer line just
[2:20:07] on the seemingly you know just
[2:20:09] just praying maybe a little tear come
[2:20:12] down
[2:20:13] walking down eyes closed
[2:20:17] and i took the oil and anointed her
[2:20:20] and she turned into a beast
[2:20:25] she hunts down in her face grotesque
[2:20:29] and a dark
[2:20:30] horrible voice
[2:20:32] growling out of her eye won't come out i
[2:20:34] won't come out
[2:20:37] she slept at me every way she could
[2:20:41] but she could make no connection
[2:20:49] we had it the other day
[2:20:51] what was it when you walked in
[2:20:54] in the room not this time but the other
[2:20:56] time and when you walked in the room
[2:20:58] where a devil there had a girl rhythm on
[2:21:02] the floor
[2:21:03] what did he say to you
[2:21:07] he began to scream out when they saw
[2:21:09] aaron no
[2:21:10] no no
[2:21:16] talking about the power that's in the
[2:21:17] church
[2:21:21] i loved it the other day
[2:21:23] you know when at camp
[2:21:25] when a girl came out with a counselor
[2:21:28] she's really troubled
[2:21:30] it was early sunday morning
[2:21:32] this child young girl
[2:21:35] one of our campers so full of anxiety
[2:21:38] and and they and the counselors sought
[2:21:40] prayer for her
[2:21:42] and took her outside and
[2:21:44] met brother joe adams
[2:21:47] and there he could take encourage her
[2:21:50] not to fear and was just going to have a
[2:21:52] short word of prayer for her
[2:21:54] and he laid his hands on her shoulder
[2:21:57] and immediately her voice changed
[2:22:00] and said i don't like you
[2:22:06] and i'm not coming out
[2:22:09] those were the words they said listen
[2:22:12] when the devil says to me
[2:22:14] i don't like you
[2:22:20] you don't know the kind of a feeling
[2:22:23] when the devil says to you i don't like
[2:22:26] you
[2:22:27] [Applause]
[2:22:30] i don't like him either
[2:22:33] the feeling is mutual devil
[2:22:37] i don't like you either but i love it
[2:22:39] when they tell me i don't like you
[2:22:43] no no no no no
[2:22:46] not you
[2:22:47] come on
[2:22:53] so i don't like you
[2:22:55] and i'm not coming out growling
[2:22:58] just a young girl about 13.
[2:23:01] brother joe just said to the spirit i
[2:23:03] don't like you either
[2:23:05] and you're coming out in the name of
[2:23:07] jesus christ and with it just a simple
[2:23:10] prayer the girl relaxed and began
[2:23:12] praising god for her freedom
[2:23:24] amen you didn't even think pastor for a
[2:23:26] week it's just a prayer
[2:23:29] you can listen you can resist the devil
[2:23:32] and he will what
[2:23:34] flee from you
[2:23:37] i'm talking to a people the devil don't
[2:23:39] like
[2:23:43] hallelujah the devil don't like no
[2:23:45] praising around here the devil don't
[2:23:47] like me glorifying god the devil don't
[2:23:49] like me preaching messages like this
[2:23:53] but i'm glad to be a man the devil don't
[2:23:56] like
[2:24:07] another fell out in the prayer line
[2:24:09] was writhing slithering on the floor
[2:24:13] we had them through the prayer line we
[2:24:15] didn't learned a thing or two
[2:24:17] we don't work with them 45 minutes and
[2:24:19] hold up 400 people we got others to pray
[2:24:22] for
[2:24:23] the ushers took her to the back room
[2:24:25] we recognized it in a demon spirit as it
[2:24:28] walked out brother ron
[2:24:30] discerned exactly where the where the
[2:24:32] problem was in her life
[2:24:35] where where the devil attached itself
[2:24:38] wasn't something
[2:24:40] she did
[2:24:41] somebody else did it to her
[2:24:44] don't you realize things you go through
[2:24:47] many times the devil will try to attach
[2:24:49] himself to that wound
[2:24:52] you say i'm going through grief don't
[2:24:54] let the devil attach say well brother
[2:24:57] tim my hormones are real high cause i'm
[2:24:59] in menopause don't let the devil attach
[2:25:01] to you
[2:25:10] we're not his slaves
[2:25:12] we were not ordained to be his slaves
[2:25:15] he was ordained to be our slave
[2:25:19] that's why he has to go when we speak
[2:25:24] their brother joe followed him out we
[2:25:25] continued the prayer line
[2:25:27] sister lydia's sister jessica went in
[2:25:29] there to pray with them
[2:25:31] it was a real strength and help and they
[2:25:34] were stranded restraining the girl
[2:25:36] because otherwise she'd come right out
[2:25:38] slithering on the platform devil showing
[2:25:41] out
[2:25:42] scaring everybody else and
[2:25:45] packing unbelief you know what they do
[2:25:47] they come and they sound in your ear
[2:25:49] because they say i'm not coming out
[2:25:52] and so they come in there and they
[2:25:54] attack you right here saying
[2:25:56] they're gonna they're gonna show you up
[2:25:58] in the whole front of that whole youth
[2:26:00] camp
[2:26:01] they're gonna make a fool out of you
[2:26:03] comes right in your ear
[2:26:09] but then you with boldness you meet him
[2:26:12] i heard your boast
[2:26:14] now let me tell you who my trust is
[2:26:17] it's not in
[2:26:18] me and you might can show me up but you
[2:26:21] can't show my god up
[2:26:22] [Applause]
[2:26:24] hallelujah because my god is showing up
[2:26:27] and when he shows up he shows out
[2:26:36] brother joe worked with this girl nearly
[2:26:38] an hour
[2:26:40] and she'd come to herself every once in
[2:26:42] a while
[2:26:43] and she would cry and help me
[2:26:45] help me i i want it out i want to be
[2:26:47] free i i'm so tired
[2:26:51] and go right back under his control
[2:26:54] moaning
[2:26:55] banging her head against the wall
[2:26:57] literally
[2:26:58] froth at the mouth
[2:27:01] these demons are real
[2:27:03] they push our kids into porn
[2:27:07] they push them into drinking
[2:27:10] they push them in the line
[2:27:13] they begin to push them into cutting
[2:27:15] themselves
[2:27:16] hating their own selves even to suicide
[2:27:23] but they have a right to stay there
[2:27:28] as long as the sins are unconfessed and
[2:27:30] unrepented of
[2:27:34] it doesn't matter the greatest preacher
[2:27:36] in the world brother branham had a man
[2:27:39] come and pin his feet to the floor they
[2:27:41] said is he delivered no he worships that
[2:27:43] spirit he won't give it up
[2:27:47] you can worship it
[2:27:50] and obey it
[2:27:51] and he can be your god
[2:27:53] he'll destroy your home
[2:27:56] your life
[2:28:00] there's a man up there just just a year
[2:28:03] ago was delivered of
[2:28:05] constant drinking he tried
[2:28:07] everything but what did he do he lost
[2:28:09] his whole childhood
[2:28:12] he lost his young adulthood
[2:28:15] he was a slave to satan all that time
[2:28:20] but he didn't lose his soul
[2:28:23] because one moment in the presence of
[2:28:25] god changed everything
[2:28:30] hallelujah
[2:28:31] amen every desire of it went away one
[2:28:34] moment
[2:28:36] in the presence of god
[2:28:39] you say brother tim well i don't like
[2:28:41] this message well it transforms lives
[2:28:45] and it makes real daddies
[2:28:47] and real mothers and nice families
[2:28:51] and good
[2:28:52] children and wonderful churches
[2:28:56] and good people
[2:28:57] who don't lie and steal why do you hate
[2:28:59] the message must be the devil in you
[2:29:01] hating it
[2:29:03] i don't like the message
[2:29:09] you know why because the message won't
[2:29:11] let you be a devil
[2:29:16] amen
[2:29:18] amen
[2:29:19] i'm kind of enjoying this
[2:29:21] i usually stand two hours
[2:29:25] you see they have a right to stay there
[2:29:27] as long as their sins unconfessed and
[2:29:29] unrepented of you see
[2:29:32] brother brandon said of a woman who had
[2:29:34] cheated on her husband hid it all of
[2:29:37] that lived many years with her husband
[2:29:39] you know and and it was that secret
[2:29:41] thing and it began to trouble her the
[2:29:44] devil found the place
[2:29:46] you see right there root
[2:29:50] put her into prison

[2:30:19] in the back end of the gable end of the
[2:30:21] soul
[2:30:23] all day he said it was there
[2:30:25] and all the all the all of her days they
[2:30:27] could pour a gallon of oil on her
[2:30:30] and kick and stump and cast out devils
[2:30:33] as much as they wanted to it'll never be
[2:30:35] able to find the cure till you find the
[2:30:37] cause
[2:30:40] and you say well psychology no
[2:30:42] psychology won't find the cause
[2:30:47] the cause is sin
[2:30:51] you
[2:30:52] find the calls first then you find the
[2:30:55] cure
[2:30:56] it was right there i left god
[2:31:00] it was right there
[2:31:02] i started disbelieving it was right
[2:31:04] there at this spot in my life
[2:31:08] i became friends with this boy
[2:31:11] and he pulled me out
[2:31:19] there was more than one demon
[2:31:21] she'd have a moment of deliverance and
[2:31:23] another would rise up and finally
[2:31:24] matthew mcgary came to reinforce
[2:31:27] and started praying with her began
[2:31:29] talking with her very strong
[2:31:32] and as i was leaving the platform we
[2:31:34] prayed for 400 people brother donnie was
[2:31:37] limp

[2:31:42] me i stood there for four hours praying
[2:31:45] for people
[2:31:46] i was exhausted
[2:31:49] and as i walked by the room i just
[2:31:50] pointed
[2:31:52] and i said god
[2:31:54] let them find what it is
[2:31:57] that's holding her from deliverance
[2:32:00] and at that very moment
[2:32:02] she began to repent
[2:32:05] of all the things that were holding her
[2:32:08] and when she repented
[2:32:10] it came out
[2:32:13] her countenance changed her speech
[2:32:16] changed the moaning cease the writhing
[2:32:18] stopped everything else stopped she was
[2:32:21] at peace
[2:32:23] amen the smile come over her face the
