[34:13] God.

[34:24] Yes, [music] he is.
[34:27] Yes, [singing] he is.
[34:30] And God, my [music and singing]
[34:32] savior.
[34:35] And God my
[34:40] [music] God [singing]
[34:42] my deliverer.
[34:46] Yes, [music] he is.
[34:49] Yes, he is.
[34:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Come in and say that he's
[34:57] your savior. [music]
[34:58] &gt;&gt; He's your healer, your deliverer,
[35:01] &gt;&gt; satisfying portion. He's everything that
[35:04] we have need of and so much more.
[35:06] [music] Amen. Let's just go to him in
[35:08] prayer today. Father, we come to you,
[35:10] Lord, with our hearts open before you.
[35:13] Let's ask once again [music] that you
[35:14] just come and touch us by your presence,
[35:17] Lord, and ministers to us, Lord, by your
[35:20] your word, Lord, and strengthen us,
[35:22] Lord, in this [music] time that we're
[35:24] living in. As Father, you just meet our
[35:27] needs according to your riches and
[35:28] glory, Father. Lord, we know that we can
[35:31] have a need that's too great for you or
[35:33] a situation [music]
[35:34] that's too hard for you. But Lord, we
[35:37] know every need that we have, you're
[35:38] more than able and have plenty in
[35:42] abundance, Lord, to answer and to meet.
[35:44] We love you with all of our hearts. We
[35:46] commit [music] our time to you, this
[35:48] moments to you, service to you in Jesus
[35:51] name. Amen. And amen. Turn your Bibles
[35:55] to John chapter 10.
[36:05] Amen. It's good to be in the house of
[36:07] the Lord.
[36:11] Amen.
[36:14] I um we just got in last night from
[36:16] Europe, so I'm a little bit in between
[36:19] here and there as far as time changing
[36:21] and things. So, I pray everything can
[36:23] come out the way it's supposed to come
[36:25] out. Amen. words in your mind sometimes
[36:28] just don't want to flow. So, but we just
[36:30] trust in the Lord and he give us the
[36:33] ability. We had a wonderful time there
[36:35] and wonderful meetings and bringing
[36:37] greetings from brother David mayor and
[36:39] his church and and uh had a wonderful
[36:42] time together with the saints there and
[36:44] amen. We're looking for a wonderful time
[36:46] tonight.
[36:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. John chapter 10 and verse 11 says,
[36:50] "I am the good shepherd and the good
[36:52] shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.
[36:55] But he that is in hierland and not the
[36:57] shepherd who own the sheep who's on the
[37:00] sheep or not seeth the wolf coming
[37:02] leaveth the sheep and fleth and the wolf
[37:05] catches them and scatters the sheep. The
[37:07] hireland fleth because he is a hireland
[37:10] and carth not for the sheep. But I am
[37:13] the good shepherd and know my sheep and
[37:15] have known of mine. As the father
[37:18] knoweth me, even so know I the father
[37:20] and I lay down my life for the sheep.
[37:23] and other sheep I have which are not of
[37:25] this fold. Them also I must bring and
[37:27] they shall hear my voice and there shall
[37:29] be onefold and one shepherd. Therefore
[37:32] doth my father love me because I lay
[37:34] down my life that I might take it again.
[37:37] No man taketh it from me but I lay it
[37:39] down myself and I have power to lay it
[37:42] down and have power to take it again.
[37:44] This commandment have I received my
[37:46] father. There was division therefore
[37:49] among again among the Jews for these
[37:51] sayings. And many of them said, "He hath
[37:54] a devil and is mad. Why hear ye him?"
[37:57] Others said, "These are not the words of
[37:58] him that hath a devil. Can a devil open
[38:01] the eyes of the blind?" And it was at
[38:03] Jerusalem, the feast of the dedication,
[38:06] and it was winter. And Jesus walked in
[38:09] the temple and Solomon's porch. And then
[38:11] came the Jews round about him, and said
[38:14] unto him, "How long dust thou make us to
[38:16] doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us
[38:18] plainly. Jesus answered them, I told
[38:21] you, and you believe not. The works that
[38:24] I do in my Father's name, they bear
[38:26] witness of me, but you believe not,
[38:28] because you're not of my sheep, as I've
[38:30] said unto you. My sheep hear my voice,
[38:34] and I know them, and they follow me. And
[38:37] I give unto them eternal life, and they
[38:40] shall never perish, neither shall any
[38:43] man pluck them out of my hand. My father
[38:46] which gave them to me is greater than
[38:49] all and no man is able to pluck them out
[38:53] of my father's hand and I and my father
[38:56] are one.
[38:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll let you be seated this
[39:00] evening. So like take a few moments
[39:04] speak on faith to hear.
[39:07] Amen. We'd also read several scriptures
[39:10] and there's a a lot of scriptures about
[39:12] ears and hearing. Maybe we'll go through
[39:14] a few of them tonight. But looking at
[39:17] Luke chapter 8, he talks about the seeds
[39:19] that were sown and those that fell on
[39:21] good ground and sprang up and bear fruit
[39:25] a hundfold.
[39:26] And when he said these things, he cried,
[39:28] "He that hath an ear to hear, let him
[39:32] hear." And also in Revelations 3 and
[39:35] verse 22 and we can read we could read
[39:38] all of the different ones where he would
[39:39] come down to the conclusion of the age
[39:42] and he would end it with he that hath an
[39:44] ear let him hear what the spirit saith
[39:47] unto the churches. Now as we know
[39:50] everyone today has ears. We he's not
[39:54] speaking about the ears that's on the
[39:56] side of your face but he's talking about
[39:58] a spiritual ear to hear
[40:00] &gt;&gt; and the ability to hear. And we we see
[40:02] these groups, two different groups that
[40:04] Jesus was speaking to. And one that
[40:06] heard what he was saying and one that
[40:08] heard him but did not hear what he was
[40:10] saying because they said, "Tell us
[40:12] plainly." And he said, "I've already
[40:14] told you. I've already you've already
[40:16] heard the words that I'm speaking, but
[40:18] my sheep are going to hear my voice and
[40:21] they're going to know that voice and and
[40:23] they're going to follow after me." And
[40:25] and he he says something that's very
[40:27] wonderful. He says, "I know them, but
[40:29] they're also going to know me." And and
[40:32] you know, there's many voices in the
[40:34] world today and and and things that are
[40:36] going on around us and trying to drown
[40:39] out the very voice of God. But I think
[40:41] it's interesting because how how you can
[40:44] even be trained to certain voices. As a
[40:46] child, you was raised up came up and you
[40:48] begin to listen to certain voices uh
[40:51] certain, you know, out of a whole room.
[40:53] You could hear people talking, but then
[40:56] somebody say your name, maybe your mom
[40:57] or your dad. You could recognize that
[41:00] voice out of all the other voices that
[41:02] were going on around you. And and out of
[41:04] all the things that was going on in your
[41:06] life, many of you had heard all kind of
[41:08] voices of the world and things that were
[41:10] going on around you and situations and
[41:13] and and noise as it were. But there came
[41:15] a voice that spoke to you one day and
[41:17] you recognized that that this wasn't
[41:19] just some other ordinary voice. This
[41:22] wasn't just something that was making
[41:23] noise, but it was a voice and something
[41:26] on the inside quickened you. Amen. To
[41:29] that voice. And and Jesus, as we read
[41:31] here in John chapter 10, said, "My sheep
[41:33] know my voice." And a voice, this voice
[41:36] is, of course, calling out through his
[41:39] word when he is speaking. And he said,
[41:41] "My sheep know my voice." My voice has
[41:44] been proven to them to be true. It's
[41:46] been vindicated. That is my voice. and
[41:49] they are not subject to follow any other
[41:52] voice. Amen. There's only one voice that
[41:55] we're to follow and that's the voice of
[41:56] the shepherd. Now, I don't know how
[41:58] many's ever saw that video that's been
[42:00] put out and I would love to had it
[42:02] tonight, but there's a video of a
[42:04] shepherd that's standing on the edge of
[42:05] a field and there's sheep out there and
[42:07] others are calling to them. Others are
[42:09] saying, you know, all the different
[42:11] maybe saying exactly what he says, but
[42:13] those sheep are just looking at the
[42:15] grass or eating or doing whatever. But
[42:17] when that voice of that shepherd begins
[42:19] to call, every one of those sheep pop
[42:21] their heads up and they look to where
[42:23] that voice is coming and they they begin
[42:25] to run towards that voice because that
[42:27] voice they can trust. That voice has
[42:30] been vindicated to know that that voice
[42:32] is what's calling me to food or calling
[42:34] me to shelter or calling me and I don't
[42:36] have to listen to all those other voices
[42:38] out there. And I I believe that's a
[42:41] wonderful thing when we can come to the
[42:42] place and we realize we don't have to
[42:44] listen to all the other voices out
[42:46] there. There's voices of pleasure.
[42:49] There's voices of of news and all all
[42:52] the other things in the world. We don't
[42:54] have to listen to those voices mean
[42:56] nothing to us. But when he calls my
[42:58] name, I'm going to pick my head up and
[43:00] I'm going to look to what he has to say.
[43:02] Amen. Amen. They they not need to listen
[43:05] to any voice out there that's that's
[43:07] contrary to that voice or contrary to
[43:10] that word. The sheep doesn't even
[43:12] understand those voices. He said no more
[43:14] than a eagle understands the clucking of
[43:16] a chicken. Amen. He don't understand
[43:18] what it's saying. He don't It has means
[43:21] nothing to them. Amen. Because that that
[43:24] voice there's a voice there that is
[43:26] calling that that speaks and something
[43:28] on the inside that resonates. Now I I I
[43:31] I I say this to be a little bit
[43:33] humorous. It's not against anybody, but
[43:35] you know, just coming from overseas, you
[43:37] hear a lot of voices and you hear a lot
[43:39] of ruckus as it were, and you hear a lot
[43:41] of you walking through the airports
[43:42] there, the train stations or the city,
[43:44] and you hear all this noise around you.
[43:46] And honestly, after a while, it gets on
[43:48] your nerves. You can't wait to hear a
[43:50] voice that you can understand. A voice
[43:53] that something that, yeah, I know what
[43:54] they're talking about. I I I know there
[43:57] may they're talking about the weather or
[43:58] they're talking about this or you know
[44:00] because you know honestly a lot of those
[44:01] voices you don't know if they're talking
[44:03] about the weather or they're talking
[44:04] about you or who they're talking about
[44:06] and it becomes something that really
[44:08] gets on your nerves after a while but
[44:10] when you come back and you get to a
[44:12] place that hey I recognize that I
[44:14] recognize that language I recognize that
[44:16] and it's something that's comforting to
[44:18] you. Amen. And that's exactly what
[44:20] happened when the voice of God began to
[44:22] speak to you. It becomes something. Hey,
[44:25] I recognize there's something familiar
[44:27] about that voice. Amen. That be beyond
[44:29] all this other stuff. And I I think it's
[44:32] a wonderful thing when the voice of the
[44:34] world becomes a strange thing to us that
[44:37] we don't even understand what they're
[44:39] talking about anymore because our voice,
[44:41] our ear has been tuned to a different
[44:44] voice. Amen. Just as the eagle cannot
[44:46] understand what the chicken says, that's
[44:48] not something that he he's concerned
[44:50] with because it's not a voice that
[44:52] resonates. that eagle in that chicken
[44:54] yard one day he heard a voice and that
[44:57] voice maybe he had never heard it his
[44:59] whole life but something resonated on
[45:01] the inside of him and that's exactly
[45:04] with a Christian maybe you went a long
[45:06] time without hearing the voice of God
[45:08] and without knowing or acknowledging but
[45:10] all of A SUDDEN THAT VOICE called your
[45:13] name and it caused you to turn and it
[45:15] caused you to move towards him he says
[45:17] you know somebody begins to say
[45:19] something that says well I I believe it
[45:22] isn't this way anymore more. I don't
[45:23] believe God heals like that. I don't
[45:25] believe that. I believe the days of
[45:27] miracles are passed. I don't believe in
[45:29] divine healing. I don't believe in none
[45:30] of that. He said, "But a genuine
[45:32] bornagain Christian, that will never
[45:35] stop in his ears." Amen. That'll never
[45:38] stop in his ears. He don't even
[45:40] understand that kind of language.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; Cuz it's not the language of heaven.
[45:45] It's not the language of God. BECAUSE IF
[45:47] GOD said in his word, he heals, he still
[45:50] heals. If God said in his word, he
[45:52] delivers, he still delivers. Amen. So if
[45:55] another voice comes telling you THAT THE
[45:57] DAYS OF MIRACLES are passed, YOU KNOW
[45:59] THAT'S just a clucking of a chicken
[46:01] somewhere THAT DOESN'T EVEN OBTAIN TO ME
[46:03] THAT LANGUAGE is not is NOT MY LANGUAGE.
[46:06] I HAVE A HEAVENLY language and that
[46:08] language HAS A POWER INSIDE OF IT.
[46:12] [cough]
[46:12] &gt;&gt; But we see here a genuine bornagain
[46:15] Christian that'll never stop in his
[46:18] ears. He don't even understand that. It
[46:20] doesn't even obtain to him. He said,
[46:22] "How could a man that believes in God
[46:24] read the Bible and see that he's the
[46:26] same yesterday, today, and forever will
[46:29] ever accept such a thing as that?" I
[46:32] don't understand him.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; And I have to say, "Amen, brother
[46:36] Brandham. I don't understand them
[46:37] either." Amen. They want to get up
[46:39] behind pull pits today and say, "God
[46:40] doesn't heal like he used to. He doesn't
[46:42] fill with the Holy Ghost like he used
[46:44] to. That language does nothing to me.
[46:47] You might as well be speaking French or
[46:49] be speaking some foreign language
[46:50] because that is a foreign language to
[46:52] the bride of Jesus Christ.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because she has an ear to hear
[47:00] what the spirit is saying.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; He said [clears throat] just like a
[47:03] baby, you know, a little baby can come
[47:05] and be born and you put him on his
[47:07] mother's bosom and he begins to nurse
[47:10] from her and and he leans his head on
[47:12] her for a few days. In a day or two, you
[47:14] take him away from his mother and you
[47:16] give him over to another mother, he'll
[47:18] begin to kick them little feet up in the
[47:20] air and yell, "Why? It's not his
[47:22] mother." He already has something in him
[47:25] to know who his mother is because he's
[47:28] part of his mother.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. A nature has been provided in him
[47:32] to know who his mama is. And if a nature
[47:36] has been provided that way for a baby to
[47:38] know, AMEN, FROM THE TIME THAT it's
[47:40] born, who its mother is, KNOW ITS
[47:42] MOTHER'S VOICE, HOW MUCH MORE IS A SON
[47:45] OF God who's been born of THE SPIRIT OF
[47:47] GOD, they will know THE VOICE OF GOD
[47:50] WHEN IT SPEAKS.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; AND THEY'LL KNOW WHEN IT'S NOT THE VOICE
[47:53] OF GOD WHEN it speaks.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE VOICE OF GOD IS HIS WORD.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; He'll know who his mommy is. He knows
[48:05] because he's born of the word, he'll
[48:07] understand the word. You put him in a
[48:09] strange place, certainly he's out of
[48:10] place, he'll get out of there as quick
[48:12] as he can. Somebody said, "Now wait,
[48:15] dear. This is your mama now." No, it's
[48:17] not his mama. Because he had a way of
[48:19] knowing that who his mama was because he
[48:22] was part of his mother. And this other
[48:24] mother, no one else can take her place.
[48:27] He knows his own mother. He knows his
[48:30] her voice. He knows her touch. He knows
[48:33] everything like that. that he said God
[48:35] has made everything after his kind. And
[48:37] you know he said he goes into talking
[48:39] about cattle and he talks about how you
[48:41] used to drive them and he said you can
[48:43] separate a mama from her baby. And he
[48:45] said out of all those other mooing and
[48:47] carrying all they can somehow find out
[48:50] go right back to where his mama is. Find
[48:53] this calf in the middle of a bunch of
[48:55] other calves. Why? Because there's a
[48:57] nature on the inside of them that they
[48:59] can hear and they can understand and
[49:01] they can go. Even though there's a
[49:03] thousand cows out there, that calf will
[49:05] go right to his mama. They can be
[49:07] mooing. They can be making some of the
[49:09] same sound, but there's a nature on the
[49:11] inside of that mama or that CALF TO GO
[49:14] RIGHT TO each other. And it's the same
[49:16] way. Amen. With the bride of Jesus
[49:18] Christ, she'll hear the voice of God and
[49:20] there'll be a pull on her that there
[49:22] ain't nothing the world can do to stop.
[49:25] It can't PULL HER AWAY FROM IT. WHY? CUZ
[49:27] THERE'S A VOICE THAT'S pulling her.
[49:29] THERE'S A VOICE THAT'S CALLING HER.
[49:31] THERE'S A VOICE THAT HAS CALLED YOU BY
[49:33] NAME.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; And there's something on the inside,
[49:38] amen, that begins to respond. A deep
[49:40] that calleth into the deep.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham talks about, he
[49:45] talks about how in a deaf spirit, he
[49:47] talks about how you could wrap a a
[49:50] transparent band around this hand and
[49:52] cut off the blood flow. And he said,
[49:54] "What would happen?" He said, "It would
[49:55] start turning purple and maybe turn
[49:58] white after a while." He said, "What is
[50:00] it?" is cutting off the blood flow. And
[50:01] he said that's exactly what it is with a
[50:03] with a de with a deaf or a blind uh
[50:06] somebody deaf or blind said there a
[50:07] spirit that got in there and it cut off
[50:10] the blood flow. It it's a transparent
[50:13] band. He said that's been put upon that
[50:15] ear and upon that. He said now doctor
[50:17] can't see it. A doctor may try to
[50:19] operate or whatever but they can't see
[50:21] what's really there. He said but when
[50:23] Jesus called he he called it a deaf
[50:25] spirit or a blind spirit. He told him
[50:28] what it really was. and he called it and
[50:30] he said if you can get that band broke
[50:32] off of there then the blood can flow and
[50:34] hearing can be restored again and he
[50:37] said it's exactly the same way or it's
[50:39] exactly the same way that when the de
[50:41] when a when a person is bound by sin and
[50:44] bound by unbelief what is it spirit
[50:46] sitting there but the word goes forth
[50:49] and when the word goes forth the
[50:51] anointing goes with it and the anointing
[50:53] breaks the yoke
[50:56] &gt;&gt; IT BREAKS THAT TRANSPARENT BAND THAT'S
[50:58] sitting there now with our eyes, WE
[51:00] CAN'T SEE A demon sitting there. But by
[51:02] our our knowledge of the word and by the
[51:04] knowledge of what God has told us IN
[51:06] THIS AGE, THAT'S A DEMON sitting there.
[51:08] BUT WHEN THE WORD GOES FORTH, faith
[51:10] comes by hearing,
[51:13] &gt;&gt; HEARING THE WORD OF GOD AND THAT PERSON
[51:15] HEARS THAT WORD FOR THE FIRST TIME, WHAT
[51:17] HAPPENS? IT BEGINS. ANOINTING GOES WITH
[51:20] IT AND IT BREAKS THE YOKE OFF THEIR LIFE
[51:23] AND THEREFORE BLOOD CAN FLOW AGAIN AND
[51:25] FAITH CAN COME TO THE BODY TO BELIEVE. I
[51:28] WASN'T A DRUNKARD. I'M NOT. THAT'S NOT
[51:30] WHO I AM. I'M NOT A CHILD OF SATAN. I AM
[51:33] A SON OR DAUGHTER OF ALMIGHTY GOD. WHY?
[51:36] BECAUSE THE WORD SAID I AM.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; NOT BECAUSE MY FEELINGS says I am. NOT
[51:41] BECAUSE ANYTHING ELSE SAYS I AM. I AM
[51:44] BECAUSE HE SAID I AM.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; So when a born a Christian's born again,
[51:52] he's part of the word. He becomes and
[51:54] and another mama or another boy who will
[51:56] not follow. He's part of the word. He
[51:58] stays with the word. And so if the
[52:00] trumpet gives an uncertain sound, you
[52:03] know, he's not going to listen to it. He
[52:05] knows the sound of the word.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. WHAT A BLESSED people we are
[52:12] to know the sound of the word.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; And when you know that you listen,
[52:16] that's why brother Tim or anybody else
[52:18] really, we're not here to preach what
[52:20] what is wrong. We're here to preach what
[52:22] is right.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; So that when you see what is wrong, YOU
[52:25] HEARD WHAT IS RIGHT. SO YOU'LL KNOW
[52:27] THAT'S WRONG.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHY? BECAUSE FAITH HAS COME TO
[52:33] YOUR HEART TO SAY, "THIS IS RIGHT." HOW
[52:35] DO YOU KNOW IT'S RIGHT? IT'S BEEN
[52:36] VINDICATED BY THE WORD OF GOD.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN. He knows the sound of the word. He
[52:46] knows that he was ordained. He was in
[52:48] the gospel. He He knows He know He kn
[52:51] knows that he was born by the spirit of
[52:53] God. He knows that the spirit of God
[52:55] will not ever deny the word of God.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. [sighs]
[53:02] &gt;&gt; So therefore, a stranger, he's not going
[53:04] to follow.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; Not going to follow after that because I
[53:07] know that ain't the word.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to follow after somebody
[53:12] that's saying days of miracles are
[53:13] passed.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; Because I know that's not the word.
[53:16] Amen.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to follow after somebody
[53:19] that says we're in another age or a
[53:21] different AGE OR I'M NOT FOLLOWING after
[53:23] that.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; I'M FOLLOWING AFTER THE WORD.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; Notice how his own predestinated sheep
[53:34] followed him right to the greatest days
[53:37] of the of the days of the greatest
[53:38] theologians they ever had.
[53:41] Here they were because they knew him.
[53:43] They knew what the word had promised for
[53:45] that day. They knew what the Messiah was
[53:47] to be like. The theologians didn't know
[53:50] what the Messiah was to be like.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; They looked for him to come out of a sky
[53:54] with a trumpet salute and come down with
[53:56] red carpet and come into the halls of
[53:58] Caiaphas and say, "Here I am." But he
[54:00] came in a manger.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? It came ex totally opposite
[54:05] of their thinking or what they thought
[54:07] or what how it was going to happen. But
[54:09] when the sheep heard their voice, they
[54:11] followed after him.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. He come after Simon. He said,
[54:15] "Follow me." That's all he said. He
[54:16] didn't tell him anything was going to
[54:18] happen. He didn't tell him. HE SAID,
[54:19] "FOLLOW ME."
[54:22] &gt;&gt; THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THAT VOICE
[54:23] THAT QUICKENED something on the inside
[54:25] of Peter. IT JUST START DROPPED HIS
[54:27] FISHING POLE AND STARTED FOLLOWING HIM.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Understanded others
[54:37] seen the same things done as many others
[54:39] did, but they called it an evil spirit.
[54:42] They heard the same words but they
[54:44] called it be elabub.
[54:46] Jesus Christ came in the fulfillment of
[54:48] the word of promise and they were too
[54:50] blind to see it. Why? They were leaning
[54:53] on what the priest said or what the
[54:55] church said instead of what the word
[54:57] said.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; And Jesus re rebuked them for it. He
[55:00] said, "Search the scriptures in them you
[55:02] claim you have eternal life and but they
[55:05] are they that testify me. The very
[55:07] scriptures that you reading are telling
[55:09] you who I am. AMEN.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; THE VERY WORKS THAT I'M DOING are
[55:13] telling you who I am. But they could
[55:15] THEY COULD BE TOLD OVER AND over and
[55:17] over and over, but they could not hear.
[55:22] [clears throat]
[55:25] &gt;&gt; You know, it's amazing how how sometimes
[55:28] you can talk and parents will know what
[55:30] we're talking about here. You can say
[55:32] something and people and they they
[55:34] acknowledge. Yep. Yep. but they really
[55:37] ain't hearing it,
[55:39] &gt;&gt; right?
[55:40] &gt;&gt; How many's had that experience?
[55:42] &gt;&gt; Probably on both ends of the spectrum
[55:44] there. You know, you're sitting there,
[55:46] you're talking with somebody and before
[55:48] you know it, you really realize, I ain't
[55:50] heard a word they're saying.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; And I have said yes to a lot of things I
[55:54] don't have a clue what I said yes about.
[55:58] You're hearing, but you ain't hearing.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. There's a lot of kids that
[56:02] hear, but they don't hear. Because if
[56:05] they heard, they wouldn't have got that
[56:06] whooping.
[56:08] [laughter]
[56:09] &gt;&gt; Right. They wouldn't have got spanked.
[56:10] They wouldn't have GOT CORRECTED BECAUSE
[56:12] OH, YEAH. YEP. YES, MA'AM. YES, SIR.
[56:13] YES. YES, SIR. And they go right on and
[56:15] and as though it never even happened.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; And even though they acknowledge they,
[56:20] you know, THAT'S WHY IT'S more than just
[56:22] a head knowledge and Yeah. Okay. No,
[56:24] it's something. Listen, we want more
[56:26] than just an amen in church.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; Come on. We want more than just
[56:31] acknowledge. Yep. That's the truth. Yep.
[56:33] Yep. No, it's a revelation that comes
[56:35] from it. And the revelation IS A LIFE
[56:37] THAT'S LIVED.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT'S NOT IT'S NOT JUST ACCEPTING
[56:43] SOMETHING BECAUSE SOMEBODY SAID
[56:45] SOMETHING. IT IT'S ACTUALLY SEEING, HEY,
[56:47] THIS IS THE TRUTH. AND THEREFORE, MY
[56:49] LIFE IS GOING TO LINE UP TO WHAT THE
[56:50] TRUTH SAID. AND I'M NOT JUST GOING TO
[56:52] SAY, "YEP, YEP, YEP." And go outside.
[56:53] What did he say? I don't know.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; I don't have no idea.
[57:00] Hey, listen.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; I can't tell you how many times how how
[57:04] many times a preacher gives his title,
[57:06] five minutes later, you can't even
[57:08] remember what it was. Did you hear it?
[57:10] Yeah, I heard it.
[57:12] [laughter]
[57:14] I dare ask anybody what my title is.
[57:18] All right, there we go. Somebody heard
[57:20] it. [laughter]
[57:22] But what is it? Many times we we we fall
[57:25] because there's so many other things
[57:26] that's trying to capture our attention.
[57:34] We we we can sit through a whole sermon
[57:36] sometimes and we heard it.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; But did we hear it?
[57:43] &gt;&gt; Right. We heard it, but did we really
[57:45] hear it?
[57:47] &gt;&gt; Well, I can tell you if you really heard
[57:48] it is if you are applying it to your
[57:51] life.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. It ain't all about just hearing
[57:55] something. Yeah, I heard all the tapes.
[57:57] Well, did you hear the tapes?
[57:59] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of people that's listening
[58:01] to tapes, but they're not listening to
[58:02] tapes.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen. THEY HEAR THE VOICE, BUT
[58:06] THEY'RE NOT HEARING WHAT THE VOICE SAID.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; Cuz they that's what they had heard for
[58:16] hundreds of years. This is going to be a
[58:17] Messiah come. Well, they had it all
[58:19] built up in their head that he's going
[58:20] to come with an army and he's going to
[58:22] deliver from the Romans. And they heard
[58:23] it. Yep. Yep. Oh, yep. Yep. Yep. That's
[58:25] what Isaiah Y. Amen, brother Isaiah.
[58:26] Yep. All right. Yep. But they Behold a
[58:29] virgin could What does that mean? Well,
[58:34] but they didn't hear what the prophet
[58:35] was saying. This is where a lot of
[58:37] people has got got a lot of messed up in
[58:39] their life because they hear it, but
[58:41] they don't hear it.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; Listen, I want to hear it.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; AND I AIN'T JUST TALKING WITH THESE
[58:47] NATURAL EARS that just get my ears
[58:49] tickled A LITTLE BIT. I WANT TO HEAR
[58:51] WHAT THE WORD IS SPEAKING in this day.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. BY HEARING IT, I'M ACCEPTING IT
[58:56] AND IT'S CHANGING MY LIFE. AMEN. TO LIVE
[58:59] A DIFFERENT LIFE THAN THIS OLD WORLD AND
[59:00] THE VOICES of this world.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; So hearing is not just hearing words or
[59:10] sentences or languages,
[59:12] but hearing is to hear what God is
[59:14] really saying.
[59:17] As we said, you can hear words and not
[59:19] hear.
[59:22] Or you can say something to somebody
[59:25] and there's something sitting there that
[59:26] twists exa everything that you say.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; Come on. It happens on from the pullpit.
[59:33] A preacher can say something and
[59:34] somebody take it completely off. Well, I
[59:36] tell you what, he's burning this and he
[59:38] was doing you don't even know cuz all
[59:40] you heard was with these natural ears.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a what happens? What what
[59:46] is what's going on? There's a filter
[59:48] that is there that's twisting things,
[59:50] that's changing things. And people come
[59:51] away with a total different idea than
[59:54] what you really meant.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; This is what happened with the word.
[59:58] There was a denominational filter
[1:00:00] SITTING THERE THAT CHANGED everything
[1:00:02] what the WORD MEANT. THANK GOD HE SENT A
[1:00:04] THINKING man's filter in this day. Amen.
[1:00:07] A voice OF THAT THE VOICE OF GOD COULD
[1:00:09] SPEAK THROUGH THAT. IT DIDN'T CHANGE IT
[1:00:11] TO WHAT HE WANTED OR HOW HE WANTED, BUT
[1:00:13] IT SAID IT LIKE HE SAID IT.
[1:00:24] There's a spiritual dullness that has
[1:00:26] taken taken over the world. Hebrews 5:11
[1:00:30] says, "Of whom we have many things to
[1:00:31] say and hard to be uttered. Seeing you
[1:00:34] are dull of hearing that is spiritually
[1:00:38] lethargic."
[1:00:40] Dull. Spiritually lethargic and failing
[1:00:43] to catch what is being said. and the
[1:00:46] importance of the voice that is
[1:00:48] speaking.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; My God, sometimes we fail to realize how
[1:00:54] important the voice is speaking.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we put other voices way above
[1:01:00] the voice of God.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. The voice of God is the most
[1:01:04] important voice you will ever hear in
[1:01:06] your life.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. And Zechariah 7 and verse 8 says
[1:01:11] the word of the Lord came to Zachchariah
[1:01:13] saying thus speaketh the Lord of hosts.
[1:01:16] So I mean thus speaketh the Lord of
[1:01:18] hosts. That's a good voice to listen to
[1:01:20] saying execute true judgment. Show mercy
[1:01:22] and compassion every man to his brother.
[1:01:25] Press not the widow nor the fatherless
[1:01:27] the stranger nor the poor. And none of
[1:01:29] you none of you imagine evil against his
[1:01:31] brother in your heart. But they refused
[1:01:34] to hearken. and they pulled away the
[1:01:36] shoulder and stopped their ears that
[1:01:38] they should not hear. Yay, they made
[1:01:41] their hearts as adamant stone, lest they
[1:01:43] should hear the law and the words which
[1:01:45] the Lord of hosts has sent IN HIS SPIRIT
[1:01:47] BY the former prophets. Therefore came a
[1:01:50] great wrath from the Lord of hosts. What
[1:01:53] happened? They closed their ear off.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; Well, that just makes me mad. I don't
[1:01:59] want to hear that. And they close THEIR
[1:02:01] EARS OFF. WHY? BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT
[1:02:03] TO HEAR WHAT THE VOICE IS SPEAKING.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; You know, and I said, as I said, one can
[1:02:11] be distracted and and miss the voice of
[1:02:14] God.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; The cares and business of life can drown
[1:02:19] out the voice of God. That's what he
[1:02:21] said in 2 Timothy 4 and:e 2. He said,
[1:02:23] "Preach the word. Be instant in season
[1:02:25] and out of season. Reprove, rebuke,
[1:02:28] exhort with all longsuffering and
[1:02:30] doctrine. For the time will come where
[1:02:32] they will not endure sound doctrine. But
[1:02:35] after their own lust shall heap to
[1:02:37] themselves teachers having itching ears,
[1:02:40] and they shall turn away their ears from
[1:02:42] THE TRUTH, AND SHALL be turned unto
[1:02:44] fables." They only want someone to tell
[1:02:47] them what they want to hear.
[1:02:53] TO TELL THEM NO MATTER WHAT YOU'RE
[1:02:54] DOING, YOU'RE OKAY.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; DOESN'T MATTER WHAT SIN OR WHAT UNBELIEF
[1:03:00] YOU HAVE THEY HAVE that they have IN
[1:03:02] THEIR LIFE, IT'S GOING TO ALL BE OKAY.
[1:03:05] ONE DAY YOU'LL DROP ALL THAT OFF AND
[1:03:07] YOU'LL GO UP IN THE RAPTURE. It's going
[1:03:08] God's going to fix IT ALL. YOU CAN'T BE
[1:03:10] PERFECT NOW, SO YOU JUST GO AND DO WHAT
[1:03:13] YOU got to do, but God's going to fix it
[1:03:15] all one day. Amen. Or just believe and
[1:03:18] it'll be ALL RIGHT. LISTEN, THAT'S NOT
[1:03:20] THE TRUE VOICE OF GOD.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; THE VOICE OF GOD is repent.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; Have a ZEAL TO SAY, "I'M SORRY. I'M
[1:03:30] WRONG AND I WANT TO BE RIGHT WITH GOD."
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; They'd rather hear easy belieism instead
[1:03:40] of hearing the need for the baptism of
[1:03:42] the Holy Ghost.
[1:03:45] itching ears. I want somebody to just
[1:03:48] tickle them a little bit. Listen, I'm
[1:03:50] not interested in coming to a service
[1:03:51] and just getting my ears tickled.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; I don't need to hear what I want to hear
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; or what this flesh wants to hear.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; This flesh wants to be petted and say,
[1:04:03] "OH, YOU'RE ALL RIGHT. YOU DONE GOOD
[1:04:05] THIS WEEK. You only told so many of this
[1:04:07] lies and you only did so many wrong."
[1:04:08] Hey, listen. I I WANT TO HEAR THE
[1:04:10] STRAIGHT WORD OF GOD.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND I DON'T WANT TO JUST HEAR IT
[1:04:15] WHERE MY EARS ARE TICKLED A LITTLE BIT
[1:04:16] AND I LEAVE AND I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER
[1:04:18] TWO HOURS LATER WHAT THE PREACHER SAID.
[1:04:20] BUT I WANT GOD TO COME DOWN AND ANOINT
[1:04:23] MY EARS WITH SOMETHING THAT I HEAR MORE
[1:04:25] JUST WORDS MORE THAN JUST A LANGUAGE.
[1:04:28] BUT I HEAR THE VERY VOICE OF GOD
[1:04:30] SPEAKING OVER THIS PULL PIT THAT IS NOW
[1:04:32] OR NEVER.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; GET RIGHT WITH GOD. MAKE THINGS RIGHT.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; Don't do stuff to offend your brother.
[1:04:42] Right.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; Is that what I not just read? What the
[1:04:46] spirit of God? I had to go back and READ
[1:04:47] IT AGAIN. OPPRESS NOT THE WILLLESS
[1:04:49] WILLOW OF THE FATHERLESS a stranger.
[1:04:51] NONE OF YOU IMAGINE evil against his
[1:04:53] brother in your heart. THAT WAS THE
[1:04:55] VOICE OF GOD SPEAKING.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; IT'S STILL SPEAKING TODAY.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; DO RIGHT BY YOUR BROTHER. DO RIGHT BY
[1:05:03] YOUR SISTER.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; CHILDREN, OBEY YOUR PARENTS.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; WELL, I DON'T THINK THEY KNOW
[1:05:09] EVERYTHING. WELL, THEY DON'T KNOW
[1:05:11] EVERYTHING, but you BETTER OBEY THEM AND
[1:05:13] HONOR THEM AS THE SCRIPTURE said to do
[1:05:15] so.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; I mean, we're just having a
[1:05:22] conversation, Brother Tim the other day
[1:05:23] and was talking about this Charlie Kirk.
[1:05:25] Even he the the whatever form of
[1:05:28] Christian he was, whatever play part he
[1:05:31] served God in, he had that down pat.
[1:05:35] He made the statement like this is, "I
[1:05:37] don't even care if your mother doesn't
[1:05:39] even live the right kind of life. Maybe
[1:05:41] she's a homosexual. Maybe she's this.
[1:05:43] Maybe she's that. Whatever. You still
[1:05:45] need to do what the scripture says and
[1:05:47] obey and honor your parents."
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; Honor them.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Give them honor.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; You got people today that won't even
[1:05:58] talk to their parents.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; Call themselves Christians. Call
[1:06:01] themselves. What's wrong with people?
[1:06:05] hear the voice OF GOD. WHAT'S WRONG WITH
[1:06:07] PEOPLE?
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; WELL, I tell you why. Well, they done
[1:06:10] this and they done that. THE SCRIPTURE
[1:06:11] SAYS, "HONOR THEM."
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; It didn't say if they've done everything
[1:06:17] right and they MADE ALL THE RIGHT
[1:06:18] CHOICES AND THEY DIDN'T MAKE MISTAKES,
[1:06:20] THEN HONOR THEM. NO, IT SAID HONOR THEM.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; WELL, I I will if they do this and I
[1:06:32] will. No, you do it because the word
[1:06:33] said to do it.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; But they don't want people don't want to
[1:06:37] hear the word.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; They want to hear their feelings. They
[1:06:40] want to hear their doubts. They want to
[1:06:41] hear their unbelief. They want to hear
[1:06:42] everything. All these other voices
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; and they go years without even saying
[1:06:47] hello to how I don't understand that.
[1:06:51] What a gift it is to be able to hear, to
[1:06:54] have ears to hear what the spirit IS
[1:06:56] SAYING.
[1:06:58] ALL THE WORLD OUT THERE IS IS GOING OFF
[1:07:01] into delusions and destructions, but
[1:07:04] there's A GROUP THAT HAS AN EAR TO HEAR
[1:07:06] WHAT THE SPIRIT IS SAYING.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; WHAT GOD IS SPEAKING EVEN IN 2025
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; WHEN IT'S DARKER THAN IT'S EVER BEEN.
[1:07:15] AND THERE'S MORE SPIRITS RELEASED THAN
[1:07:16] THERE'S EVER BEEN. THERE'S DEMONS ON
[1:07:18] EVERY STREET CORNER. THERE'S ALL KIND OF
[1:07:20] VOICES OUT THERE. YET THERE'S A PEOPLE
[1:07:22] ON THE EARTH WHOSE EAR IS TRAINED TO
[1:07:25] HEAR THE VOICE OF GOD. YEAH, SIR.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; WHAT A BLESSING THAT IS.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Not hear what the WORLD IS SAYING, NOT
[1:07:33] HEAR WHAT YOUR FEARS ARE SAYING, NOT
[1:07:35] HEAR WHAT YOUR DOUBT IS SAYING, BUT HEAR
[1:07:37] WHAT THE WORD IS SAYING.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; What God is saying.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram talks about sheep one time.
[1:07:45] He he he watched they would come down
[1:07:48] this busy street with the shepherd. So
[1:07:51] they called them dainties. And then he
[1:07:52] talks about how they were counters
[1:07:54] laying out because you go out in some of
[1:07:56] the countries,
[1:07:58] they don't have refrigerate. You don't
[1:07:59] go into a grocery store like we got.
[1:08:01] They got it laid out on counters out on
[1:08:03] the street.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; And the shepherd would come with this
[1:08:06] long string of sheep about a city block
[1:08:08] long walking right down maybe not even
[1:08:10] 10 feet on either side was these pears
[1:08:13] and papayas, things laying there. No
[1:08:16] doubt tempting. But he walked right down
[1:08:19] the she street and not one sheep turned
[1:08:21] right or left to take one thing.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; I said, 'Well, what about that fella? He
[1:08:29] said, the sheep are so devoted to the
[1:08:31] shepherd
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; till there's no way they pay attention
[1:08:34] to anything else. They only keep their
[1:08:37] eyes on him and follow him. Amen.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; That's what I want to be a devoted
[1:08:44] sheep.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; That I ain't paying attention to
[1:08:47] everything else around me. My eyes is on
[1:08:50] the shepherd.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; So, I thought, "Oh, God, your church
[1:08:53] should be so devoted to you that the
[1:08:55] temptation of the world has nothing to
[1:08:57] do with them. They keep their mind on
[1:09:00] the shepherd. The shepherd can make one
[1:09:01] step this way and they go back way.
[1:09:04] every sheep coming right behind the
[1:09:06] other, making the same kind of steps and
[1:09:08] following the shepherd. Oh, to follow
[1:09:10] the footsteps of the shepherd. DON'T BE
[1:09:12] TEMPTED. DON'T BE TOSSED ABOUT. DON'T BE
[1:09:14] WORRIED. Tempted here and down here and
[1:09:17] up there today. YOU GOT THE VICTORY AND
[1:09:19] TOMORROW YOU'RE OUT [screaming] OF IT.
[1:09:20] FOLLOW THE SHEPHERD.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; FOLLOW THE SHEPHERD.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; HE'S LEADING THE WAY. MY SHEEP KNOW MY
[1:09:28] VOICE.
[1:09:30] THEY GET ACCUSTOMED TO hearing the
[1:09:32] shepherd's voice.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what that's a voice I
[1:09:38] want to be accustomed to hearing. Amen.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; Well, so what if a you know, he said,
[1:09:43] "Well, what if another shepherd would
[1:09:44] come in and give that little o le
[1:09:48] is what they use o le
[1:09:51] call that he gives there? Wouldn't them
[1:09:52] sheep if they were out in the field
[1:09:54] come?" He said, "Nope. Those sheep know
[1:09:56] the very sound of every tone of that
[1:10:01] shepherd's voice.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; I thought, "Wow, this is the land of the
[1:10:05] Bible." Now, no matter another shepherd
[1:10:07] could stand and try to impersonate that,
[1:10:09] them sheep would just keep on grazing,
[1:10:11] but just let a little certain voice
[1:10:13] speak and every sheep would stand up and
[1:10:15] look around. They'd line up and come
[1:10:16] marching. He said, "Oh God, some
[1:10:18] glorious day that king's shepherd is
[1:10:20] going to scream from the skies and we're
[1:10:22] going to glide up and march to the city
[1:10:24] of Zion in in that great unbreaking
[1:10:27] branch of the armies OF THE LORD. WHEN
[1:10:29] WE RISE, WE WILL TRIUMPH OVER DEATH,
[1:10:31] HELL, AND THE GRAVE."
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; WHY? AT THE CALL OF THE SHEPHERD'S
[1:10:35] VOICE. YES.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; Said, isn't it beautiful when you can
[1:10:41] anchor your soul into Christ into such a
[1:10:45] place to you can get quiet before him
[1:10:47] and hear his voice speaking to you.
[1:10:50] What's he saying? What's he saying,
[1:10:53] brother Brandon? I am the Lord that
[1:10:55] health thee.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; I am the Lord that giveth eternal life
[1:11:01] to thee.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; I love you. Oh yes. Hallelujah.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Oh well, we know what it's like. How
[1:11:11] much it makes our heart go when our
[1:11:13] boyfriend or girlfriend, husband, wife
[1:11:15] say, "I love you." But what if tonight
[1:11:18] you could just hear tonight his voice
[1:11:21] say, "I love you.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; I love you.
[1:11:29] I knew you before the foundation of the
[1:11:31] world. I put my name on the book. I put
[1:11:36] your name on the book. Thou art mine.
[1:11:39] Fear not. Don't be afraid. I'm with you.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's brother Tim. Oh, that's the
[1:11:47] shepherd's voice.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; I am with you. Don't be afraid. He said,
[1:11:52] "That's what I want. I want an answer
[1:11:54] from heaven. I want to hear his voice. I
[1:11:57] don't care about the manager's voice,
[1:11:58] the mayor's voice, the governor's voice,
[1:12:00] the bishop's voice, THE PRESIDENT'S
[1:12:01] VOICE. I WANT TO hear the voice of God.
[1:12:04] I WANT TO HEAR YOUR VOICE, LORD. THAT
[1:12:06] MEEKNESS AND GENTLENESS of the Holy
[1:12:08] Spirit SPEAKING UNTO MY HEART, SAYING,
[1:12:10] "COME unto me, all that are heavy laden,
[1:12:14] and I will give you rest."
[1:12:20] He said, "There was a man, Moses, on the
[1:12:22] back side of a desert, old man of 80
[1:12:25] years old. His wish was hanging way
[1:12:27] down, seen a burning bush. He turned
[1:12:30] aside. He said, "What was it?" He said,
[1:12:32] "The Lord had got him out of Egypt to
[1:12:35] quieten all the voices
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; so he could hear his voice. He had to
[1:12:42] quieten him for 40 years
[1:12:45] before he could ever speak to him.
[1:12:49] That's unbelievable.
[1:12:52] How much does he have to quieten us
[1:12:54] sometimes
[1:12:55] so he can speak?
[1:12:58] He said he said, "I I think about it."
[1:13:00] He said, "We won't stay quiet 10 minutes
[1:13:02] so God can speak to us with all the
[1:13:05] rumble and bumble we have in this day."
[1:13:07] That's right.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; But Moses after 40 years stood there in
[1:13:10] the presence of that bush, that one
[1:13:11] voice that called him, he knew more
[1:13:13] about God in five minutes and all the 80
[1:13:15] years of training had taught him, it
[1:13:17] made a different man. And it'll make a
[1:13:19] different man and woman out of you if
[1:13:21] you'll stand still long enough to hear
[1:13:23] his voice
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; like Samuel did. Stand still. Don't be
[1:13:27] excited. If you want something of God,
[1:13:29] ask him. Then stand still and listen.
[1:13:31] See what he's going to say about it.
[1:13:33] Just open up your heart and say, "What
[1:13:34] about it, Lord Jesus?" But just stay
[1:13:36] there. there. If he doesn't answer the
[1:13:37] first five hours, wait another. If he
[1:13:40] doesn't answer today, he'll answer
[1:13:41] tomorrow. If he doesn't answer this
[1:13:42] week, HE'LL ANSWER TODAY. STAY THERE
[1:13:44] TILL HE ANSWERS.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Hear his voice speak back in your heart
[1:13:49] and say, "Yes, I am the Lord that health
[1:13:52] thee."
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; Then it's all over. It's settled. I am
[1:13:58] the Lord who forgives all thy sins. Go
[1:14:00] and sin no more. I don't condemn you.
[1:14:02] Said then you can go free. You're all
[1:14:04] right. But you want to be sure that
[1:14:07] you've heard that voice that speaks.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Moses heard it
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; and he was changed.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; He said, "I sincerely believe that the
[1:14:17] spirit of God has been speaking to us,
[1:14:19] not only teaching us the truth of the
[1:14:21] ages, but he's been faithfully dealing
[1:14:23] with hearts that they may turn to him."
[1:14:25] That is the reason for all the preaching
[1:14:26] and teaching. For is it in the preaching
[1:14:28] and teaching of the word. It is in the
[1:14:30] preaching and teaching of the word that
[1:14:32] the sheep hear the voice of God. and
[1:14:34] follow him.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; Did y'all catch that?
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; Or was that just language? It's in the
[1:14:40] preaching and teaching of the word that
[1:14:42] the sheep hear the voice of God and
[1:14:44] follow him.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; Not for one moment do I bring a message
[1:14:49] to people that they may follow me or
[1:14:51] join my church or start some fellowship
[1:14:54] or organization. I've never done that
[1:14:56] and will not do that now. I have no
[1:14:57] interest in those things. But I do have
[1:14:59] an interest in the things of God and the
[1:15:01] people of God. And if I can accomplish
[1:15:03] this one thing, I'll be satisfied. That
[1:15:06] one thing is to see established a true
[1:15:09] SPIRITUAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOD AND
[1:15:11] MEN WHERE MEN BECOME NEW CREATURES and
[1:15:13] create CREATIONS IN CHRIST FILLED with
[1:15:15] his spirit and live according to HIS
[1:15:18] WORD. I INVITE AND PLEAD AND WARN ALL TO
[1:15:21] HEAR HIS VOICE at this time AND YIELD
[1:15:23] YOUR LIVES COMPLETELY to him EVEN AS I
[1:15:26] TRUST MY HEART THAT I've given my all to
[1:15:27] him. God bless you and may his coming
[1:15:30] rejoice in your heart. Amen.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, I tell you what, if
[1:15:36] you see another shepherd drawing you to
[1:15:38] himself, you can say that is wolf and
[1:15:40] sheep's clothing.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; Cuz there's only one that's to draw you
[1:15:46] to himself.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; No man can come to me unless the father
[1:15:51] draw them.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; Right? So if you see a man trying to
[1:15:56] draw you to his ideas or his things or
[1:16:00] his buildings or his organization,
[1:16:03] that's a wolf in sheep's clothing.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; Cuz I know the voice of God.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; A true voice of God does not draw them
[1:16:12] anybody to themselves.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; It draws them to Christ.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; It's what we just spoke about. Brother
[1:16:20] brother Tim just spoke about overseas.
[1:16:22] He said, "Look, I don't come here to
[1:16:24] build my own kingdom. It's not about my
[1:16:26] kingdom. I don't have a kingdom. I come
[1:16:28] here to build his kingdom."
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; We've had enough kingdom builders
[1:16:36] [snorts]
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; and they're all now just destruction
[1:16:39] everywhere from them their own kingdom.
[1:16:40] They built it on sand. They built it on
[1:16:42] their own ideas and their own abilities
[1:16:44] and what they could do. And that man
[1:16:46] dies and it all crumbles.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Well, let me tell you something. the
[1:16:51] difference. A man can build his own
[1:16:53] kingdom and die and it'll crumble. But
[1:16:55] God built his kingdom and he gave his
[1:16:57] life and is still building today.
[1:17:02] [laughter]
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because it wasn't built on flesh
[1:17:05] and blood. It was built on the
[1:17:06] revelation of Jesus Christ.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; John said it like this. He heard said,
[1:17:15] "I heard behind me a great voice of a
[1:17:17] trumpet." John was in the spirit and he
[1:17:19] saw that great and wonderful day of the
[1:17:21] Lord Jesus and all his holy power. The
[1:17:24] future was about to unfold for God was
[1:17:26] about to teach him. John did not say it
[1:17:27] was a trumpet. He said it was like a
[1:17:29] trumpet. He said when a trumpet is
[1:17:31] blown, he has an urgency about it. It's
[1:17:32] like a herald. The king's messenger
[1:17:34] coming to the people. He blows the
[1:17:36] trumpets urgent call and people gather
[1:17:38] to listen. He said Israel always
[1:17:40] assembled at the sounding of the
[1:17:42] trumpet. Something important is ahead.
[1:17:44] Listen to it. So this voice had the same
[1:17:47] urgency or appeal as the trumpet. Clear
[1:17:49] and strong, startling, awakening. Oh,
[1:17:51] that we might hear the voice of God as a
[1:17:54] trumpet.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; Oh my. As a trumpet.
[1:18:06] [snorts]
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; Pardon me for a minute, but I mean when
[1:18:09] you wake somebody up from asleep,
[1:18:12] you
[1:18:13] Hello. No, you I don't do it that way.
[1:18:16] I'm sorry. Hey,
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; time to get up.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; Starters. I'm awake.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; They're awake now.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; They don't have to get awake. They're
[1:18:30] awake.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's a voice as a trumpet.
[1:18:35] This is what THE VOICE OF GOD DID TO
[1:18:37] YOU. You were one time asleep in slumber
[1:18:39] of sin, BUT A VOICE SPOKE. AMEN.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; SAID, "HEY,
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GOING DOWN THE WRONG PATH.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE DOING THE WRONG THINGS. REPENT
[1:18:48] AND COME AND TAKE BRING YOUR BURDENS TO
[1:18:51] ME AND I'LL BEAR THEM
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; AND I'LL MAKE THAT HEAVY LOAD. I'LL TAKE
[1:18:56] IT FOR YOU AND I'LL BRING IT TO THE
[1:18:58] CROSS AND I'LL DIE FOR YOUR SINS SO THAT
[1:19:01] YOU DON'T HAVE TO CONTINUE IN YOUR SLEEP
[1:19:03] AND SLUMBER."
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; The voice is a trumpet. It's awakening.
[1:19:10] IT'S A STARTLING. THIS AND IT'S HEY
[1:19:12] SOMEBODY'S talking
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; brother Tim's g this analogy before
[1:19:18] about I've never had this happen to me
[1:19:19] in the airport but he's had it happen to
[1:19:21] him you know you walk down the airport
[1:19:23] and you hear all all these voices and
[1:19:25] man you go through Atlanta it's a lot of
[1:19:27] voices tons of voices and saying all
[1:19:30] talking about all kinds of stuff talking
[1:19:31] real loud on their phone got their phone
[1:19:34] playing real loud all kinds of stuff and
[1:19:37] this
[1:19:39] welcome to Atlanta this is the mayor who
[1:19:41] know all this stuff going off and then
[1:19:43] so and so all kinds of voices
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; and you can just walk there and you
[1:19:49] ain't paying no attention to none of it
[1:19:53] John so and so come to this do all of a
[1:19:55] sudden you hear your voice
[1:19:58] Tim
[1:20:00] pick up a phone at such and such desk
[1:20:02] dial this certain something startles you
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; wait a minute something called my name
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; what is what are they saying now It's
[1:20:10] important to me
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; cuz you heard your name called.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; This is what's wrong with a lot of
[1:20:17] people sitting on message churches. They
[1:20:18] ain't heard their name called. So things
[1:20:20] that are saying on the pullpit ain't
[1:20:21] important to them.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; It's just another voice. But when you
[1:20:25] see, hey, my name is in that book.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; IT CALL ME BY NAME.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; IT AWAKENS YOU TO SOMETHING. HEY, I'M
[1:20:34] NOT TO BE IN THIS STUPER NO MORE. I AM
[1:20:36] TO BE PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT GOD IS
[1:20:39] SAYING DIRECTLY TO ME CUZ IT INVOLVES
[1:20:42] ME.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THIS IS WHAT IT'S ABOUT.
[1:20:47] IT'S NOT ABOUT JUST ANOTHER VOICE. IT'S
[1:20:49] THE VOICE OF GOD THAT IS INVOLVING YOU.
[1:20:51] IT'S CALLING YOU. IT'S PULLING ON YOU.
[1:20:54] IT'S SAYING, "HEY, PAY ATTENTION."
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; It's the gospel trumpet.
[1:21:07] It's a loud voice
[1:21:10] sounding forth a word of prophecy to
[1:21:12] make us aware and prepared for what is
[1:21:15] coming upon the earth.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, this trumpet will make
[1:21:21] you more prepared for what's coming on
[1:21:22] the earth than Fox News, CNN, or
[1:21:24] anything else.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; If you'll start listening to this
[1:21:28] trumpet, you won't be surprised by all
[1:21:29] the things that are going on. Amen.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Well, I can't believe Sodom Gomorra is
[1:21:34] as bad as it. Well, if you'd have read
[1:21:35] the book, you'd know, hey, this is where
[1:21:36] we at.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; Well, I can't believe those are
[1:21:41] departing from the truth. Well, if you
[1:21:42] read the book that you you see where we
[1:21:44] at.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; It's it's already telling us what has
[1:21:47] taken place.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; It's a voice that is speaking.
[1:21:55] Revelation 11:11 saying, "I am Alpha and
[1:21:57] Omega, the first and the last, which
[1:21:59] thou seeest right in a book sent in the
[1:22:01] seven churches." Said, "Here it is, the
[1:22:03] first and the last, the alpha and omega.
[1:22:04] That's all of the one true God, the
[1:22:06] voice and word of God, reality and truth
[1:22:09] is at hand. What a thing it is to be in
[1:22:11] the spirit, to be in the presence of God
[1:22:13] and hear from him."
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; That's why that's what I want. I ain't
[1:22:19] interested in coming to hear just a
[1:22:20] bunch of news and a bunch of I'm not
[1:22:22] interested in that.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; Current events. I'm not interested in
[1:22:26] that.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; If you want to go find a church, I'm
[1:22:30] sure there's a church that preaches
[1:22:31] current events, but that ain't what this
[1:22:32] church is. This church is about being in
[1:22:34] the spirit.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; Come on. If we ain't going to be in the
[1:22:38] spirit, let's just go home.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. We come to get in the spirit of
[1:22:43] God. AMEN. TO BE CAUGHT UP INTO the
[1:22:45] Lord's day. Amen.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. To be to so WE CAN HEAR THE
[1:22:50] VOICE AND THE WORD OF GOD AND KNOW THE
[1:22:53] REALITY AND TRUTH THAT IS IN THE WORD.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; What a thing it is to be in the spirit
[1:23:00] to be in the presence of God and hear
[1:23:03] from him.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; What thou seeest write in a book sending
[1:23:08] to the seven churches. The voice that
[1:23:10] sounded forth his word in the garden of
[1:23:12] Eden upon mount si of which voices also
[1:23:14] heard the excellent glory of the mount
[1:23:15] of trans transfiguration was once again
[1:23:17] sounding forth and this time to the
[1:23:19] seven churches with the complete and
[1:23:22] final revelation of Jesus Christ. Write
[1:23:24] the visions John make a record of them
[1:23:27] for the ages which are to follow for
[1:23:29] they are the true prophecies which must
[1:23:32] come to pass. Write them and send them
[1:23:34] out making them known. John recognizes
[1:23:37] that voice. Oh, you will recognize that
[1:23:40] voice WHEN HE CALLS.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; YOU WILL RECOGNIZE THAT VOICE WHEN HE
[1:23:46] CALLS IF YOU ARE ONE OF HIS OWN.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; WELL, I'M GLAD TO BE ONE OF HIS OWN.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; I'M GLAD TO KNOW THAT IN THIS DAY WITH
[1:23:56] ALL THE VOICES THAT ARE HERE UPON THIS
[1:23:58] EARTH THAT'S TRYING TO CLUTTER UP
[1:23:59] EVERYTHING THAT MY HEART HAS BEEN TUNED
[1:24:02] IN. YES.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; BROTHER B TALKED ABOUT IT. HE SAID
[1:24:05] THERE'S A SENDING STATION AND A
[1:24:07] receiving station.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; Come on now. He's talking to that guy.
[1:24:12] He walked out of that out on the streets
[1:24:14] there and that guy was selling them TV
[1:24:15] sets and he tried to sell brother
[1:24:17] Brandon one and he began to realize, you
[1:24:19] know, brother Brandon, oh, he was in
[1:24:21] that meeting. Well, I don't know about
[1:24:22] all that. And he he don't realize he's
[1:24:23] actually speaking to the one that was
[1:24:24] speaking the meeting. But
[1:24:27] and then brother Brandon begins to tell
[1:24:29] him, talk to him in what he was living
[1:24:31] in.
[1:24:32] and explain things. He said, "Sev,
[1:24:34] there's air waves going through here."
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; He said, "It's been going through here
[1:24:38] for thousands since the beginning of
[1:24:40] time." He said, "But finally, a man has
[1:24:42] built something that can not just send
[1:24:44] it out, he can receive it."
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; He said, "But I want you to understand
[1:24:48] something. There's also a sending
[1:24:50] station in glory."
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; He said, "But there's also a receiving
[1:24:53] station here on earth."
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; It's a heart of man.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. of a soul that has been tuned to
[1:25:01] to catch a certain frequency.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Now, I know a lot of you young people
[1:25:06] don't even remember this, but I'm old
[1:25:07] enough to remember. We used to have
[1:25:09] these dials you had to turn to catch a
[1:25:11] certain station on a radio and if you
[1:25:14] didn't get it just right, you heard a
[1:25:15] lot of maybe other voices breaking in or
[1:25:17] static and all kinds of things. You had
[1:25:19] to tune it just right
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; to get that voice in.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Come on. And that's exactly what the
[1:25:26] Holy Spirit does in a service. He comes
[1:25:29] with his hand. He reaches down into your
[1:25:31] heart and he's been catching a lot of
[1:25:33] static. He's been hearing a lot of other
[1:25:34] voices, but he begins to tune the dial
[1:25:36] just a little bit.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; And he said, Brother Bam said, if I He
[1:25:40] said, if the people in this meeting
[1:25:41] would just tune the dial just a little
[1:25:43] bit to a VOICE THAT SAYS, GOD IS GOD.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; That's all YOU GOT TO HEAR. GOD IS GOD.
[1:25:49] AND IF GOD IS GOD, HE STILL HEALS. HE
[1:25:52] STILL DELIVERS. HE STILL SETS FREE. HE
[1:25:54] STILL DOES ALL OF THAT. WE JUST NEED
[1:25:56] SOME RECEIVING STATIONS TO BELIEVE GOD
[1:25:59] IS GOD. I'M GETTING THAT SIGNAL.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; HE'S STILL GOD. HE'S STILL ON THE
[1:26:04] THRONE. HE'S STILL IN CHARGE OF THIS. IT
[1:26:06] DOESN'T MATTER WHAT OTHER VOICES ARE
[1:26:08] SAYING. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT'S GOING
[1:26:09] ON AROUND US. GOD IS GOD. [cheering]
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; AND IF GOD [screaming] IS GOD, HE STILL
[1:26:16] HEALS. HE STILL SAVES. HE STILL
[1:26:18] DELIVERS. DAYS OF MIRACLES ARE STILL
[1:26:20] HERE. HE STILL FILLS WITH THE HOLY
[1:26:22] GHOST. HE STILL SAVES THE LOST. HE STILL
[1:26:25] BRINGS PRODALS HOME. WHY? GOD IS GOD.
[1:26:29] [applause]
[1:26:32] I wonder how many TONIGHT WOULD SAY,
[1:26:33] "GOD, I JUST WANT YOU TO TUNE me just a
[1:26:36] little bit. I GOT MAYBE SOME STATIC OR
[1:26:38] SOME OTHER VOICES, BUT TONIGHT, GOD, I
[1:26:40] WANT TO HEAR WHAT THE SPIRIT IS SAYING.
[1:26:43] I WANT TO HEAR WHAT YOUR VOICE IS
[1:26:45] SPEAKING TO this generation.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet.
[1:26:52] Maybe bow your hearts for a moment. Just
[1:26:55] talk to the Lord. Say, "God, tune me.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Tune me just a little. Maybe just off
[1:27:03] just a little. Don't take much.
[1:27:06] Just sometimes just a little touch.
[1:27:10] Get that voice clear."
[1:27:16] Maybe your heart's been hearing a little
[1:27:18] bit more doubts and fears than it's been
[1:27:20] hearing the voice of God. Tonight, Lord,
[1:27:21] I won't just hear your voice.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Tune me just a little bit. And all of a
[1:27:26] sudden, he reaches in there and he tunes
[1:27:28] it and he says, "I love you.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; You're my child." All of a sudden, you
[1:27:34] hear that voice loud and clear. You
[1:27:36] never did belong to the devil. That's
[1:27:39] not who you are.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; I called you by name.
[1:27:44] You're mine and you will always be mine.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; I will not lose you. I will not deny
[1:27:51] you. I will not turn you down. Ask what
[1:27:54] you will and it will be given to you.
[1:27:56] Seek and you shall find. Knock and it
[1:27:58] shall be open. Tune my heart, God, I can
[1:28:02] hear your voice. I can have faith to
[1:28:05] hear what the spirit is saying.
[1:28:13] Grant it Lord.
[1:28:15] Oh Jesus.
[1:28:18] Tonight Lord we want our hearts tuned.
[1:28:21] We want to hear what the spirit is
[1:28:23] saying Lord.
[1:28:26] Lord if we miss you in this moment.
[1:28:28] We'll miss you Lord on that [music] day
[1:28:30] when you that voice speaks and the dead
[1:28:32] in Christ raises.
[1:28:34] Lord we don't want to miss that time. So
[1:28:37] tonight, Lord, we ask, Father, you just
[1:28:39] tune us [music]
[1:28:41] to hear the voice of God, to hear what
[1:28:43] you speak, to hear what you're saying,
[1:28:45] to see what you're doing,
[1:28:47] God, that when our eyes can be open, our
[1:28:49] ears can hear, what the spirit saith,
[1:28:53] [music] not what the world saith, not
[1:28:54] what our doubts are saying, not what our
[1:28:56] fears, not what our peers are saying
[1:29:00] around us,
[1:29:02] not what Instagram or Facebook is saying
[1:29:05] or anybody's saying about us or
[1:29:08] whatever. Lord, we ain't listening to
[1:29:09] none of that. We listen to what you say.
[1:29:14] You love us. [music] You died for us.
[1:29:17] You gave your life.
[1:29:22] Jesus, we love you, Father. Seen the
[1:29:24] hands [music] lifted, Lord, all over
[1:29:26] this building, God. My hand included.
[1:29:28] God, we hear so many other things
[1:29:30] sometimes, but Lord, let our eyes and
[1:29:32] our ears [music] only see you and hear
[1:29:34] you, Father.
[1:29:36] May we not be tempted to go on this side
[1:29:38] of the street [music] and pick this up
[1:29:39] or go over here and see what this is all
[1:29:41] about. But keep our eyes on the shepherd
[1:29:43] as he walks. Let us put [music] our
[1:29:45] foots and feet in the same footsteps.
[1:29:47] Lord,
[1:29:49] grant it Lord. Walk in the same [music]
[1:29:51] path.
[1:29:53] We love you with all of our heart, Lord.
[1:29:56] Jesus [music] name.
[1:29:59] Amen. Amen. Sing

[1:30:12] till I found peace [music] of 99.

[1:30:21] don't deserve it. Still [music] you give
[1:30:25] [singing] yourself
