[48:37] looking forward to to today I'd like to
[48:39] I'd like to speak to you today
[48:42] or on
[48:43] on this thought of the effect of the
[48:46] vision the effect of the vision and
[48:50] this will kind of be like riding a new
[48:51] horse if you ever rode one and sometimes
[48:55] sometimes you got to get a little bit
[48:57] adjusted to you so uh y'all just help me
[48:59] ride this thing today
[49:02] hey man Genesis chapter 15 and verse 1.
[49:05] some of y'all understand what I'm saying
[49:07] right there some of you don't that's
[49:09] okay
[49:12] as long as the angels in charge and he's
[49:14] got to Reigns we'll be all right amen
[49:17] Genesis chapter 15 and verse 1 and after
[49:19] these things the word of the Lord came
[49:21] unto Abram in a vision saying fear not
[49:24] Abram I am thy shield and thy exceeding
[49:27] great reward right there brother Branham
[49:30] would say he said how can Satan hit you
[49:32] if he is your Shield
[49:34] and Abram said Lord God what will thou
[49:37] give me see and I go childless and the
[49:39] steward of my house is Eliezer of
[49:42] Damascus and Abram said behold to me
[49:45] thou has given no seed and lo one born
[49:48] in my house is mine Heir you see right
[49:51] there in the humanity Abraham would have
[49:54] failed but you see the Covenant was
[49:57] unconditional aren't you thankful and
[49:59] behold the word of the Lord came unto
[50:01] him and saying this shall not be thine
[50:03] Heir but he that shall come forth out of
[50:06] thine own bowels shall be thine Heir and
[50:09] he brought him forth abroad and said
[50:11] Lord look now towards heaven and tell
[50:14] the Stars if thou be able to number them
[50:16] and he said unto him so shall thy seed
[50:19] be and he believed in the Lord and he
[50:21] counted it to him for righteousness
[50:24] Abacus chapter 2.
[50:28] in verse 2
[50:30] we recognize that a vision is a forecast
[50:33] of future events
[50:36] it foretells the thing before it happens
[50:40] the vision
[50:42] foretells a thing before it happens
[50:54] and the Lord answered me and said write
[50:56] the vision
[50:57] and make it plain upon the tables that
[51:00] he may run that readathy for the vision
[51:03] is yet for an appointed time but at the
[51:05] end it shall speak and not lie though it
[51:08] tarry wait for it because it will surely
[51:11] come it will not tarry may God bless his
[51:16] word he may be seated in the presence of
[51:17] the Lord we recognize today that we are
[51:20] standing in a very special spot as the
[51:22] Bride of Jesus Christ that we recognize
[51:24] that the Holy Ghost is in the power is
[51:27] the power within the Church of the
[51:29] Living God and we recognize that that
[51:31] we're not just speaking or addressing
[51:33] just any any church group but we are
[51:35] speaking to a Divinity class of people a
[51:37] very prophetic class of people that
[51:39] understand that they have been brought
[51:41] up higher by a message of Malachi 4 that
[51:44] has turned their hearts back to the
[51:46] faith of the Pentecostal fathers and we
[51:49] recognize that there's a lot of people
[51:50] that look upon the same word that you
[51:52] read and they cannot understand and they
[51:55] cannot recognize it because Revelation
[51:57] has not struck their heart but we
[51:59] recognize that Paul would tell us over
[52:01] in the book of Corinthians that the veil
[52:03] is upon their hearts and they're blinded
[52:05] to these things even when Moses would be
[52:07] read in the Old Testament that that
[52:09] there there was a veil that was upon
[52:11] their face but we recognize that that
[52:13] where we are we are seeing him not
[52:15] through a glass Darkly but we're
[52:17] recognizing that we have been speaking
[52:19] to the son of man we've been speaking to
[52:21] the one that created the heavens and the
[52:23] Earth we've been speaking to him face to
[52:25] face but if you go to reading over there
[52:27] that you'll watch that that Paul was
[52:29] standing there and he said that when he
[52:32] said when it is turned to the Lord the
[52:35] veil shall be taken away and we
[52:37] recognize what Malachi 4's Ministry is
[52:39] to do it's to turn the hearts back to
[52:42] the faith of the Pentecostal fathers so
[52:44] we recognize that our hearts have been
[52:47] turned to be able to understand where
[52:48] we've been feeding at we are not feeding
[52:50] on the mind of a man but you're feeding
[52:52] on the unfailing body word of the son of
[52:55] man and only a select people can
[52:57] understand and what is being said here
[52:59] and we recognize as the Bride of Jesus
[53:01] Christ that we are here living out the
[53:03] very vision of God and we understand
[53:05] that that God's God's prophecy or his
[53:08] his cogs of Prophecy brother random
[53:10] would say he said they're slow but
[53:12] they're sure there's one thing for sure
[53:14] that if God said it you can believe it
[53:16] and you can go to the bank on it it
[53:19] might seem like you get you might get
[53:20] caught up in the delay of time and
[53:22] wondering where God is and wondering
[53:24] where the promise is at I'd say that
[53:26] Abraham had some moments had some
[53:28] moments in his life when he was
[53:30] wondering where is the vision at but
[53:32] notice God never got upset about his
[53:35] promise because the promise was
[53:37] unconditional and God is not excited
[53:39] about what's happening down here in
[53:41] laodicea God isn't succumb about where
[53:44] you are and where you are in your life
[53:46] and where you are in your spiritual life
[53:47] or where you are the natural God knows
[53:50] exactly where you are and if God got
[53:52] Isaac to come through what men said was
[53:54] impossible God has a way of getting this
[53:57] not dressed put her in a Rapture he has
[54:00] a way to make sure that you make the
[54:02] body change God ain't shook up about the
[54:04] vision God he took about where you are
[54:07] he took up about our prodocus isn't
[54:09] shook up about our healing he hasn't
[54:11] shook about the Masterpiece she is
[54:14] struck off of him and the vision has got
[54:16] to speak he may look like Isaac is never
[54:19] coming and it may look like Ishmael
[54:21] would get there before Isaac but the
[54:23] blessing is of old Isaac the blessing
[54:25] ain't on the Pentecostals the blessing
[54:27] is upon this bride we're not just
[54:29] addressing anybody but this is a
[54:31] prophetic group of people that
[54:33] understand that the vision has spoken
[54:36] about us and it's a vision that spoke
[54:38] about us we've only got one destiny to
[54:41] go to and that's the rapture
[54:45] let hail come let high water come the
[54:48] vision has been spoke about you I'm not
[54:51] worried about young girls what they're
[54:52] battling with I'm not worried about
[54:54] young boys about what they're battling
[54:55] with God is the author
[55:02] ity Hallelujah
[55:03] you see to those that are predestinated
[55:06] to see it they'll see it because it's
[55:09] the word that is joining with the word
[55:12] it can't do nothing else we recognize
[55:14] that that you know these things and I'm
[55:16] not going to spend much time on these
[55:18] things but I'm going to drive some
[55:20] things this morning but we recognize
[55:22] that when in the days of Samuel that the
[55:25] word of the Lord was precious in those
[55:27] days you see even when when Samuel was
[55:31] there in the house of Eli and he was
[55:33] there and he was under the training of
[55:34] the priesthood he was standing there he
[55:37] was laying there at night and the Lord
[55:39] began to speak to Samuel about about the
[55:41] things that and begin to speak unto him
[55:43] and we recognize that the Bible tells us
[55:46] in first Samuel 3 3 and 1 that the word
[55:50] of the Lord who was precious in those
[55:52] days because there was no open vision
[55:54] and we recognize that the Bible tells us
[55:56] that where there is no vision that
[55:59] people perish and he recognize that that
[56:02] the church world can go no further than
[56:05] where they are because they have no
[56:07] vision before this day but God sent a
[56:10] prophet to this right you know there's a
[56:12] lot of people that won't understand him
[56:13] there's a lot of people that that can
[56:15] even understand that William Branham was
[56:17] a prophet but they can't understand that
[56:19] he was a prophet messenger they can look
[56:21] upon his Visions they can look upon his
[56:24] healings but they don't recognize that
[56:26] this was the prophet Messenger to this
[56:29] age you see there's a lot of people that
[56:31] stood there under the first and second
[56:33] pool but where are they at now but there
[56:36] is another people in the land today who
[56:39] under their Messenger will be the final
[56:41] boss and you're not running without a
[56:43] message said hey you are running with
[56:45] the greatest message that's ever been
[56:47] loosed out of this loose out of the
[56:50] mouth of God this was not William
[56:52] Branham the man's message this was God's
[56:55] message and if I'm going to be
[56:56] identified with anything in this state
[56:58] let me be identified with the message of
[57:01] an Angel and if the angel said that I
[57:03] would repeat that if the angel says for
[57:06] me if the angel said it's for you I'm
[57:09] not gonna let one complex send in my way
[57:11] I'm not going to let what anxiety stand
[57:13] in my way I'm not going to let anyone of
[57:15] My Flesh read his eyes stand in my way
[57:17] and I'm gonna stand right here and I'm
[57:20] going to believe this word it's time
[57:22] like never before that we preach this
[57:24] message why don't you the coming of the
[57:26] Lord let's not get shook up about where
[57:29] we are and let's create some message
[57:31] [Music]
[57:33] [Applause]
[57:41] [Music]
[57:45] this is
[57:46] [Applause]
[57:57] you see what they needed was the voice
[57:58] of God to meet the need of that hour we
[58:02] don't want no work up for the need of
[58:03] the album we don't want no intellectual
[58:05] speech for the need of the hour we want
[58:07] the vision to speak we recognize that
[58:11] we're right here in the hour of the
[58:13] vision where Luther can't run with this
[58:14] the Westlands can't run with this but it
[58:18] takes a very special class of people and
[58:21] you can imagine how how great that we
[58:24] feel to be able to come into Expressions
[58:27] recognize that he's here recognize this
[58:30] is his anointing recognize it then ask
[58:33] the Praises of God as we begin to praise
[58:36] the Great I Am that His blessings begin
[58:38] to come down upon the Church of the
[58:40] Living God but can you imagine God's
[58:43] anticipation for his children to be
[58:45] gathered under the word of this howling
[58:48] and to think you know we we just want to
[58:50] stay right here we want to live right
[58:52] here we we don't want to go back out to
[58:55] the world we don't want to go back to
[58:56] Monday we don't want to go back to our
[58:58] work but can you imagine the very
[59:01] mindset of God I have finally got a
[59:04] people that are mouth of my mouth their
[59:06] word of my word I have held the Seven
[59:09] Stars in my hands and I waited to
[59:11] release him at a certain spot and he
[59:14] watched Paul go out and watch Luther he
[59:16] watched Wesley but could you imagine as
[59:19] he's releasing the seven star from his
[59:21] hand that this will be the final group
[59:24] this will be the group and this will be
[59:26] the messenger and he's built him in such
[59:28] a way to draw a certain class of people
[59:32] it might be a bunch of nuts to a bunch
[59:34] of to a bunch of Pentecostals you might
[59:36] be a bunch of odd boss to the rest of
[59:38] the world but you're exactly what God
[59:40] was looking for
[59:43] that's all you Innovation and you're
[59:45] going to run with this message
[59:47] [Applause]
[59:49] his anticipation
[59:52] that underneath underneath the Paw would
[59:55] come polycarp that would be elect would
[59:58] catch the message of the day you see
[1:00:00] what it was he was the Holy Spirit
[1:00:02] building a body all through every age
[1:00:05] the Philadelphian age he was building a
[1:00:08] body the Sumerian age he was building a
[1:00:10] body and you watch as the elect of that
[1:00:12] age catch the message or catch the
[1:00:15] revelation of where they were you watch
[1:00:18] under Wesley you watch men like Spurgeon
[1:00:20] infinity and Wigglesworth I said as they
[1:00:22] are getting there and they're wrapping
[1:00:24] up the message of their day but here we
[1:00:27] are in a lap over and here we are we
[1:00:29] recognize that the church is right here
[1:00:33] we're standing right here and brother
[1:00:35] random told us in the invisible Union
[1:00:37] with a bride he said God slipped on your
[1:00:40] hand before the foundation of the world
[1:00:43] the wedding band of unmerited Grace he
[1:00:46] knew you before the foundation Lord
[1:00:48] [Applause]
[1:00:50] I could take his same message and I
[1:00:52] could preach it down to the Pentecostals
[1:00:53] and he wouldn't do nothing for them I
[1:00:55] could take your same message and preach
[1:00:57] it down to the Baptist and he wouldn't
[1:00:59] do nothing for them because they can't
[1:01:01] understand what I'm saying of him but
[1:01:03] because you're a two-world kind of
[1:01:05] people
[1:01:06] because you understand there's reality
[1:01:09] and there's a physicality and you
[1:01:11] recognize that hell cannot handle the
[1:01:14] reality of this vision
[1:01:15] [Applause]
[1:01:19] I just give you a mouthful hell cannot
[1:01:21] handle the reality of this vision
[1:01:23] [Applause]
[1:01:25] but because you are who you are because
[1:01:28] you know who you know because you've
[1:01:30] been fellowshipping like Abraham was
[1:01:32] fellowshipping he was up there feeding
[1:01:35] and feasting with Melchizedek and
[1:01:38] becomes
[1:01:40] because he was a player and God took he
[1:01:43] took 16 elements and he blew himself a
[1:01:46] body and he walked up there and he had a
[1:01:48] conversation
[1:01:50] he grabbed this Angel and he grabbed
[1:01:52] that angel and he stepped into a body
[1:01:54] now watch what brother random said he
[1:01:57] said after Abraham had his name changed
[1:02:00] he was April but he couldn't produce
[1:02:02] what he was supposed to produce and let
[1:02:05] he head out until he had a name change
[1:02:07] brother Madam said and then Abram was in
[1:02:11] condition to meet Melchizedek and
[1:02:13] because a prophet stood over you and
[1:02:16] said I'll no longer call you church but
[1:02:18] I'll call you Brian you're able to stand
[1:02:20] here and recognize that you are in
[1:02:23] condition for the Revelation to come
[1:02:28] foreign
[1:02:29] let me drop just a few things right here
[1:02:32] as we're building this he said then
[1:02:34] Abram Abraham he said when you watch the
[1:02:38] revelation of who he was he said then he
[1:02:42] was able to call him Lord he said there
[1:02:45] was three Angels out there he said but
[1:02:47] because he caught the Revelation because
[1:02:49] he wasn't conditioned he said his vision
[1:02:52] and his Revelations lined up
[1:02:55] lined up because you see the effect of
[1:02:58] the Revelation and what we're preaching
[1:03:00] to these young kids they know who God is
[1:03:03] you can shut down every trinitarian with
[1:03:06] one of these young boys
[1:03:07] because the effect of the revelation
[1:03:17] when you think about William Branham
[1:03:18] standing there
[1:03:20] you can hear it tape after tape
[1:03:23] and he's dealing with a patient
[1:03:25] and he's watching he's watching as the
[1:03:28] angel of the Lord begins to move him
[1:03:30] he's moving him into a realm a Divine
[1:03:33] gift he's operating right here by the
[1:03:35] window and he's operating he said and
[1:03:38] we're all very aware he said I'm
[1:03:40] standing into Worlds you can go listen
[1:03:43] to deep calleth to the deep and he's
[1:03:45] standing there he and he and he comes
[1:03:47] back around and he says is this the
[1:03:50] patient because you see he's in Two
[1:03:53] Worlds at the same time
[1:03:57] and he's standing there he said now you
[1:03:59] see now a vision doesn't heal you but a
[1:04:02] vision allows you to see that it's a
[1:04:04] finished work of power in Calvary a
[1:04:06] vision is a word of knowledge that you
[1:04:09] know that he's still Hebrews 4 and 12
[1:04:11] and it's some it's somebody
[1:04:14] it's somebody that's in condition to be
[1:04:17] able to receive that you are a people of
[1:04:20] Two Worlds
[1:04:21] [Applause]
[1:04:24] yeah
[1:04:26] foreign
[1:04:27] it's dropping into your heart to be able
[1:04:30] to foresee that something has told you
[1:04:33] or something that will be you see you
[1:04:36] can have somebody you could have
[1:04:37] somebody stand up you can have somebody
[1:04:39] stand up
[1:04:41] that would be that would be standing
[1:04:43] there you take a person that may that
[1:04:45] may be dying or take a person that's got
[1:04:47] a dreadful be a disease upon their life
[1:04:50] and you watch as the man of the hour the
[1:04:54] prophet of this age would stand there
[1:04:56] and he would look and he said now he
[1:04:59] said now I see this and such and such in
[1:05:01] your life he said those things are
[1:05:03] laying there those I see I see I see
[1:05:06] this doctor that's got this tortoise
[1:05:08] shell glasses upon him and you've went
[1:05:11] here for this condition and that
[1:05:13] condition you're not from here you're
[1:05:15] from another place what was it it was
[1:05:17] the angel of the Lord that was directing
[1:05:20] the man of God to go down and grab
[1:05:23] something that would draw their
[1:05:25] attention that this was more than a man
[1:05:27] that was standing there you see the
[1:05:29] reason why you understand the revelation
[1:05:32] of the seventh seals is because there's
[1:05:34] an Angel that's been dropping you that's
[1:05:37] been dropping you it's been dropping you
[1:05:39] purposes on hand he's has been watching
[1:05:42] over your life he's not allowing the
[1:05:44] things that have been built up in your
[1:05:45] life to hold you back what he's been
[1:05:47] dropping by your way it was a message
[1:05:49] that caught your attention Hallelujah
[1:05:51] that's why we didn't stand there and
[1:05:53] watch the first poll and the second poll
[1:05:55] but this third pool has caught the body
[1:05:58] of Jesus Christ I wasn't there in the
[1:06:01] meeting but the pool of the Holy Ghost
[1:06:04] has drawn us unto him
[1:06:13] I see this I see this he said now
[1:06:18] he said down here is standing a body
[1:06:21] that we've just talked about
[1:06:24] with this disease he said but up here is
[1:06:27] a well-body and he said Jesus is calling
[1:06:31] you to that well body
[1:06:32] [Applause]
[1:06:33] you see in in the age of Luther and
[1:06:37] Wesley there were things down here that
[1:06:39] you couldn't understand but God Jesus
[1:06:42] was calling you to a well-body
[1:06:46] to be able to operate with all of First
[1:06:48] Corinthians 12 visions and gifts and
[1:06:51] words of knowledge he could not operate
[1:06:54] Hallelujah he could not operate the way
[1:06:56] that he wanted to through the Wesleyan
[1:06:59] message we're not taken away from them
[1:07:00] but he finally has got a class of people
[1:07:03] that can understand what he's saying
[1:07:06] that can be the Dynamics that is not
[1:07:08] just mechanics but the Dynamics of the
[1:07:11] Holy Ghost is on the inside of this body
[1:07:14] she can walk in his name she can believe
[1:07:16] in his name she can speak in his name
[1:07:36] you remember when brother bisco
[1:07:38] gives his testimony
[1:07:43] that is that he goes
[1:07:45] and it begins he begins to go in there
[1:07:47] and grab those things and I certainly
[1:07:49] appreciate brother best school
[1:07:51] there's not another one like him in my
[1:07:53] opinion that's all right you ain't got
[1:07:55] to be yours it's mine
[1:07:58] I thank God for it
[1:08:01] but you I I just want to draw your
[1:08:03] attention to this one thing when brother
[1:08:05] Branham when brother Branham is standing
[1:08:06] there I believe it was the man that was
[1:08:09] a son worshiper that he looked there and
[1:08:11] that he was worshiping the Sun and his
[1:08:13] eyes were his eyes were went blinded out
[1:08:16] because he'd been looking at the sun and
[1:08:18] you remember brother by Adam said that I
[1:08:19] had I had been entertained by the James
[1:08:21] and the seats all day long he said but
[1:08:24] he said then it come the Holy Ghost
[1:08:26] turned to take the pulp in and he said I
[1:08:29] was standing there he said I was
[1:08:31] standing there and he said this man was
[1:08:33] standing up before me and this is what I
[1:08:35] want to draw your attention to he said
[1:08:37] brother mystical said that brother
[1:08:39] Branham told him he said because I saw a
[1:08:42] vision of that man he said I was able to
[1:08:45] make a challenge like I made he said
[1:08:48] where is the gods of the James if the
[1:08:51] gods of the Sikhs can stand up here and
[1:08:54] they can heal this man let him come
[1:08:57] he said but if not let Lord our Lord
[1:09:00] Jesus Christ come and do the work for
[1:09:02] the mystical said that brother random
[1:09:04] told him said he looked up there in a
[1:09:05] vision and he seen that man that that
[1:09:08] man had those gray hair in his in his
[1:09:11] sideburns so he was looking at a vision
[1:09:13] and he was able to tell him your whole
[1:09:16] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ now
[1:09:19] if God is still there if God was God
[1:09:22] there isn't he God right here and
[1:09:24] there's been a vision that's been spoke
[1:09:26] over this body you're not going down in
[1:09:29] defeat you're going up in Victory you're
[1:09:32] not going to lose you are going to win
[1:09:34] you're not going to you're not going to
[1:09:37] go into the tribulation Brad there's no
[1:09:39] way he can send you through persecution
[1:09:42] when you're his wife
[1:09:44] you've received his love letter
[1:09:51] man told us he said now he said God gave
[1:09:54] us five senses to be able to contact our
[1:09:58] Earthly home of sea tasteful smelling
[1:10:00] here he gave us those angels He said but
[1:10:02] if God put something on the inside of
[1:10:04] you sister to be able to look into
[1:10:06] another realm to be able to contact that
[1:10:09] world and to think that brother Madam
[1:10:11] said that when you have the Holy Ghost
[1:10:13] you are a candidate for the Unseen World
[1:10:18] so you understand what I'm saying to you
[1:10:20] today that your Miracle is already in

[1:11:03] thank you
[1:11:08] William Brandon
[1:11:10] I believe it's 1954 he's standing there
[1:11:12] and he begins to tell us
[1:11:15] he begins to tell us
[1:11:17] that he's sitting there in the audience
[1:11:21] and he said
[1:11:23] he said I see I see a doctor that's
[1:11:26] working on a little girl
[1:11:28] and she's paralyzed she's paralyzed from
[1:11:31] her shoulders down he's working he's
[1:11:33] working on her tonsils and something
[1:11:35] goes wrong and now she's paralyzed from
[1:11:38] the shoulders down now when brother
[1:11:40] Brandon begins to speak yet he said that
[1:11:42] there came a lady running from the back
[1:11:44] and said where the brown brother random
[1:11:46] that's my girl that's my girl is she
[1:11:50] made whole is she made whole he said he
[1:11:52] says I said I can't say I can't say one
[1:11:55] way or another whether she is or not he
[1:11:57] said only way he said I don't have a
[1:11:59] gift of teaching or a gift of preaching
[1:12:01] he said but I have a gift of Visions he
[1:12:03] said but he said I don't know whether
[1:12:05] she's healed or not and they begin to
[1:12:07] call another patient and he said all of
[1:12:10] a sudden
[1:12:10] materializing in the building was a car
[1:12:13] and a road that was going down that road
[1:12:16] and it was sitting out there and he
[1:12:18] watched that little girl walking down
[1:12:20] that road holding a little baby doll in
[1:12:23] her hand and she began to scream what
[1:12:26] was it it was the effect of the vision
[1:12:29] now you know if I say something to you
[1:12:31] about your children it would move you if
[1:12:34] I tell you that now you don't have to
[1:12:35] worry about the confidence that's in
[1:12:37] your family don't you have you don't
[1:12:38] have to tell your children don't you be
[1:12:40] worried about your confidence it's
[1:12:42] already there it would affect you in
[1:12:44] such a way that you would know
[1:12:46] that he's talking about me
[1:12:49] [Applause]
[1:12:50] I could say something about you and it'd
[1:12:53] be completely off and it wouldn't affect
[1:12:55] you one way but you let something be
[1:12:57] said about you let it be done to your
[1:13:00] children it affects your life when the
[1:13:02] angel said that I would be in this
[1:13:05] meeting and I'd be standing here with
[1:13:07] Wayne Lawson standing here with Ron
[1:13:09] Spencer and we would taste
[1:13:12] the taste of Victory I say the addition
[1:13:17] has affected my heart
[1:13:26] there's been a vision over this meeting
[1:13:29] it's a first time Wayne Lawson brother
[1:13:31] Ron and myself has ever spoken a meeting
[1:13:35] brother Nani was supposed to be here and
[1:13:38] we certainly miss you but God knew that
[1:13:41] God knew the circumstances he's got
[1:13:43] sister Erica Parker he's got he's got
[1:13:46] everything in control for Donnie Reagan
[1:13:48] but God had something in mind for this
[1:13:51] meeting when brother Ron was back maybe
[1:13:53] about a year ago and maybe I'm telling
[1:13:55] stories out of school right here and
[1:13:57] maybe I'm getting ahead of the gun but I
[1:13:59] believe that I believe I'm right into
[1:14:01] this
[1:14:03] thank you
[1:14:06] Wayne Lawson and Ron Spitzer myself walk
[1:14:10] in
[1:14:11] and we begin to eat on
[1:14:13] a honey bun and brother Wayne says
[1:14:16] Brother on
[1:14:17] don't you think don't you think you
[1:14:19] shouldn't be having that
[1:14:22] he's old brother Wayne don't you know
[1:14:24] I'm cancer-free
[1:14:30] now I ain't sat down at no table and I
[1:14:34] ain't ate no honey bun with these three
[1:14:35] brothers but I believe that this is
[1:14:37] sweeter than a honey bun I believe but
[1:14:39] this is honey from the rock that there's
[1:14:41] healing that is the bread of the
[1:14:44] children and I believe there ain't
[1:14:45] nothing too hard for my God if he could
[1:14:48] walk up there and talk his hair and said
[1:14:50] is there anything too hard for the Lord
[1:14:52] Sarah it's time that you recognize that
[1:14:56] your Miracle is in the room stop trying
[1:14:58] to have it through Hagar stop trying to
[1:15:00] have it through the handmaiden let the
[1:15:02] birth of the Holy Ghost move you into a
[1:15:05] vision
[1:15:09] foreign
[1:15:12] you know what that does to me that's the
[1:15:15] son of Ron Spencer
[1:15:17] it affects me but nothing affects my
[1:15:21] soul greater than to watch one of these
[1:15:23] brothers and to watch one of these
[1:15:24] sisters get so filled with the Holy
[1:15:26] Ghost that they'll never have to go back
[1:15:28] there and sin no more they'll not walk
[1:15:31] out in depression no more then I walk
[1:15:33] out of anxiety no more then I walk out
[1:15:35] there and be bothered by those things no
[1:15:37] more suicide last no hold in the name of
[1:15:40] the Lord Jesus Christ so it affects me
[1:15:42] knowing that God has not forgotten us
[1:15:45] and there is such a liberty in this
[1:15:47] message that's bringing us right into
[1:15:49] the vision
[1:15:51] I don't want let the critics do what
[1:15:54] they're going to do we have been
[1:15:55] stimulated by the Revelation and we are
[1:15:58] filled with the Holy Ghost and it brings
[1:16:00] stimulations of God's house
[1:16:02] [Applause]
[1:16:06] oh you see
[1:16:08] It came it can't affect you it can't
[1:16:12] affect you what critics are saying about
[1:16:14] you because you're an eagle an eagle
[1:16:16] flies above the storm an eagle has a way
[1:16:19] to pierce through the darkness an eagle
[1:16:20] has a way to go through the clouds and
[1:16:23] the clouds of life and then not affects
[1:16:25] you all you got to do is set your wings
[1:16:29] you're not going to go home the same way
[1:16:31] you came here the vision that spoke
[1:16:33] differently you may not have met
[1:16:35] everything that you got you have need of
[1:16:38] but God's got something out in front of
[1:16:39] you brother Joshua that is greater than
[1:16:41] you've ever experienced in your life
[1:16:43] this is that that was prophesied by the
[1:16:46] prophet Jehovah
[1:16:48] and I'm so crazy enough to believe that
[1:16:51] if you could get any prodigal in this
[1:16:52] building tonight
[1:16:55] get them in here and watch the Power of
[1:16:57] the Holy Ghost it is the effect of a
[1:17:00] vision
[1:17:04] this horse is riding all right but let's
[1:17:07] take it all the way in to the coming of
[1:17:10] the Lord
[1:17:14] whom the men say that I am some say
[1:17:17] Jones some say John the Baptist but whom
[1:17:20] do you say
[1:17:22] what do you say brother Isaiah what do
[1:17:24] you say about this
[1:17:26] I say that thou art the Christ the son
[1:17:28] of the Living God
[1:17:30] I say unto you that Flesh and Blood
[1:17:32] didn't reveal this to you but my Father
[1:17:34] which is in heaven has revealed this
[1:17:36] unto you and and Upon This Rock I will
[1:17:40] build my church and the Gates of Hell
[1:17:42] shall not Prevail against it you're not
[1:17:44] just being built upon some cold ideal
[1:17:46] formal idea where we're just working you
[1:17:48] up under the atmosphere of the music
[1:17:50] there ain't one that the music's being
[1:17:52] played right now
[1:17:54] but there's such a power that's called
[1:17:57] this body
[1:17:59] to her feet it's the word Dawning with
[1:18:02] the word
[1:18:13] let me tell you the message that you're
[1:18:15] riding on
[1:18:16] here to take care of your family
[1:18:19] here to take care of your parents it'll
[1:18:22] take care of you young girls it'll take
[1:18:24] care of you if you if you're right on
[1:18:25] this message it'll take care of
[1:18:27] everything it's just a charity
[1:18:28] he this faith that you have is the
[1:18:32] master of all circumstances so no matter
[1:18:35] what the circumstances is the revelation
[1:18:37] of faith that instructs in your heart is
[1:18:39] greater than the circumstances
[1:18:42] foreign
[1:18:45] this ain't man constructed this ain't
[1:18:48] Tim Pruitt's building
[1:18:50] this ain't Tim Pruitt's Vision this is
[1:18:52] God's vision
[1:18:54] and I'll tell you what these are my
[1:18:56] buddies but I stand up for the anointing
[1:18:57] and I'll stand here and you can say
[1:19:00] anything you want to about this but
[1:19:02] remember that you are not talking about
[1:19:04] a man you are talking about the son of
[1:19:07] man
[1:19:10] Noah I'm telling you go out there and
[1:19:12] preach the message and you get you get
[1:19:15] hot and bothered
[1:19:17] because your pastor preached the same
[1:19:19] thing for the last three weeks
[1:19:21] I ain't talking about Tim Pruitt I ain't
[1:19:23] talking about anybody maybe I'm talking
[1:19:25] about myself
[1:19:26] but you get all upset you get upset
[1:19:29] because your pastors preach the same
[1:19:31] thing he's come down the same line and
[1:19:34] he's walked down the aisle he's pointed
[1:19:36] his fingers spiritually at you and said
[1:19:38] wake up your dry bones
[1:19:42] but Noah was standing there for 120
[1:19:45] years preaching the same message what's
[1:19:47] your message today it's gonna rain it's
[1:19:50] gonna rain and he knew only eight of his
[1:19:53] family was going to go in there but he
[1:19:55] preached the message I don't know who's
[1:19:56] going in and I don't know who's going
[1:19:58] out but I know this that if God got Noah
[1:20:01] in the boat and he got up more player on
[1:20:03] Mount of Iraq and he got him out he said
[1:20:06] God that can get you in and he's a God
[1:20:08] that can get you out
[1:20:26] she's born of his bowling she's life of
[1:20:29] his life she's power of his power
[1:20:33] we must be talking about Katie Spencer
[1:20:38] we must be talking about we must be
[1:20:40] talking about Connie Spencer we must be
[1:20:42] talking about this brother or that
[1:20:43] brother no we're talking about this body
[1:20:46] that is under this anointing
[1:20:49] that has set up a meeting that told you
[1:20:51] to accept the anointing let's finish
[1:20:53] this and that you are the anointed body
[1:20:56] of Jesus Christ and if you don't
[1:20:58] recognize her in the vision I don't know
[1:21:00] what you're doing you ain't got your
[1:21:01] eyes open but God is telling you let's
[1:21:04] finish this let's look on this race
[1:21:07] Hallelujah
[1:21:12] That's what Satan hates
[1:21:16] he hates this revelation
[1:21:19] amen when simeon's up there and it's
[1:21:22] been dropped in his heart
[1:21:24] that he would not die until he's seen
[1:21:25] the Lord's Christ
[1:21:27] it didn't matter how many babies visited
[1:21:30] the temple
[1:21:31] he knew he wasn't going by the way the
[1:21:33] grave until he seen the Messiah
[1:21:39] you cannot go down in defeat
[1:21:43] job was a man that went through a year
[1:21:47] of Trials when you read all those 42
[1:21:49] chapters it seems a whole lot longer
[1:21:51] than a year but job went through all of
[1:21:54] those all of those stripes
[1:21:56] and brother Branham said that God had
[1:21:59] gave job a Channel of inspiration and
[1:22:03] when the inspiration began to fall and
[1:22:05] the Visions begin to flash and the
[1:22:07] pillar of fire and the Lightnings begin
[1:22:08] to flash he began to look at it that I
[1:22:11] know that my redeemer lives you let
[1:22:14] something drop in your heart right here
[1:22:16] this morning a channel inspiration that
[1:22:19] only you have and you'll watch healing
[1:22:21] come you'll watch Miracles come
[1:22:23] [Applause]
[1:22:24] I know what I'm talking about Satan
[1:22:26] hates when we go to preaching about this
[1:22:29] church can do the same thing that Jesus
[1:22:31] did that you can do like Mark 16 Lay
[1:22:34] Your Hands on the sick and they shall
[1:22:36] recover what am I operating by I am
[1:22:39] operating by a vision that you can do
[1:22:41] the same works that he did in John 14
[1:22:43] and 12 Satan hates when you go to
[1:22:46] talking about a body move not just in
[1:22:48] one man but in a mini member bride and
[1:22:51] she loves to lay in her hands upon her
[1:22:54] brother and upon her sister Satan hates
[1:22:56] when you start catching the Revelation
[1:22:58] that I am seeing
[1:23:01] [Applause]
[1:23:04] foreign
[1:23:06] told us he said he said Peter went up
[1:23:10] there and he preached and three thousand
[1:23:13] Souls were saved and Satan never got out
[1:23:16] of his bed
[1:23:20] he's somebody who
[1:23:21] gave a beautiful
[1:23:24] he walked past the
[1:23:26] pirate person to hate and he healed a
[1:23:27] man that been laying there for all of
[1:23:29] those years and he told him rise up Leah
[1:23:33] and he rise up in the name of the Lord
[1:23:35] Jesus Christ such as I have give I unto
[1:23:38] you
[1:23:39] but watch it it was operating in a body
[1:23:44] it was operating in a body
[1:23:47] Satan never got out of the bed for a
[1:23:50] preached word he said but you let the
[1:23:52] phenomena begin to happen
[1:23:54] you let what Malachi 4 came and preached
[1:23:57] to us come into fruition in this meeting
[1:23:59] and you watch every Rogue Hound of Hell
[1:24:01] begin to go down and so man it was
[1:24:04] nothing but a bunch of Pentecostal work
[1:24:05] up down there talking about miracles
[1:24:07] that's gone by let every Rogue hell go
[1:24:10] ahead and get started we're not going to
[1:24:12] back off preaching the message we're not
[1:24:13] going to back our preaching mark 16.
[1:24:17] do you recognize that the devil gets out
[1:24:21] of bed when you start accepting the
[1:24:23] anointing
[1:24:24] that you're in the vision I can lay my
[1:24:26] hands on this brother and watch him be
[1:24:28] healed why don't you step into the
[1:24:31] vision you are Satan's worst nightmare
[1:24:41] I'm talking about children you're
[1:24:42] Satan's worst nightmare Lily
[1:24:46] you are Satan's worst nightmare Rebecca
[1:24:50] you are Satan's worst nightmare throw
[1:24:53] your name right there you are Satan's
[1:24:55] worst nightmare
[1:24:59] this ain't just for Tim Pruitt this
[1:25:01] ain't just for Ron Spitzer this ain't
[1:25:03] just for Wayne Lawson this ain't just
[1:25:05] for Aaron Oglesby and any other brother
[1:25:07] here this is your anointing this is your
[1:25:10] power this is your vision
[1:25:12] [Applause]
[1:25:31] don't you love the Lord
[1:25:39] when Jesus was here
[1:25:43] when Jesus was here
[1:25:45] he said you have made the word of God of
[1:25:49] no effect by your traditions
[1:25:53] do you understand
[1:25:55] what effect he is it's the result
[1:26:03] my heart from exploding right here
[1:26:08] you are the result
[1:26:10] of the prophet's vision
[1:26:13] you've not made this message of no
[1:26:15] effect by your traditions of thanks and
[1:26:17] thinking it was just in 1965 when
[1:26:20] William Branham was here you have not
[1:26:22] made it of no offense but it has
[1:26:24] affected your soul just like when Isaiah
[1:26:27] was up there in Isaiah chapter six and
[1:26:29] brother random goes in there and he
[1:26:30] preaches on influence influence of
[1:26:32] another he said this man Isaiah was
[1:26:35] influenced by the king uziah that he'd
[1:26:39] watched him or he respected him he said
[1:26:41] but he got that Uzziah got his eyes on
[1:26:44] the wrong thing he got his eyes on the
[1:26:46] wrong thing he said but then there came
[1:26:48] a vision that came a vision and the
[1:26:51] spirit of the lord caught Isaiah up and
[1:26:53] he went up there and there was there was
[1:26:56] Angels flying that were covering their
[1:26:58] face they were covering their feet and
[1:27:00] they were screaming holy holy holy unto
[1:27:03] the Lord
[1:27:05] now brother man I'm sitting now you
[1:27:07] watch
[1:27:08] what the vision did
[1:27:10] he said it affected him so much
[1:27:13] that he confessed I am a sinner
[1:27:18] if we get to a spot that we think we're
[1:27:22] so high that we can't confess that we're
[1:27:24] Sinners saved by the grace of God if we
[1:27:27] get to a spot where we can't we can't
[1:27:29] welcome a prodigal or a prostitute
[1:27:31] walking in there and I know we ain't
[1:27:34] preaching to them to stay that way but
[1:27:36] we're not welcome them we're welcoming
[1:27:38] them in for a change
[1:27:41] but if we ever get to a spot that we
[1:27:43] can't breach salvation to the Lost we
[1:27:45] need to close our Bible up and shut it
[1:27:47] down
[1:27:49] not everybody's going to be bride but if
[1:27:52] I can do one thing to get somebody to
[1:27:54] believe in the Lord Jesus Christ who
[1:27:56] accept them as His Savior and accept him
[1:27:59] as a Healer let me get in the vision and
[1:28:02] let me preach the message the message
[1:28:04] I'm not worried about it let me just
[1:28:06] pass the net brother L and let it bring
[1:28:09] them in
[1:28:12] caught his attention it affected him so
[1:28:15] much that he said Hello whoa is me I am
[1:28:20] a man undone with unclean lips and I
[1:28:22] live amongst the unkling people
[1:28:27] there's a blood
[1:28:29] there's a blood there's an anointing
[1:28:32] that follows you that erases your past
[1:28:35] that erases your history
[1:28:38] it affected him so much that he knew
[1:28:41] that he was that he knew that he was in
[1:28:43] the presence of The Great I Am and it's
[1:28:46] affecting you I see it all over your
[1:28:47] face it's affecting you because you
[1:28:49] recognize this is more than Andrew
[1:28:51] Spencer that is speaking unto you but
[1:28:53] you recognize that you are in the
[1:28:55] presence of el shadiyah you are in The
[1:28:58] Presence of Jehovah Jireh if he could do
[1:29:00] it for Abraham he can do it for you he
[1:29:03] is Jehovah's Hammer the Lord is there
[1:29:06] and David said if I make my bed in hell
[1:29:08] Thou Art there if I ascended to the
[1:29:11] heights Thou Art there you are in The
[1:29:13] Presence of Jehovah Shalom he is my
[1:29:16] peace I am in the presence of the home
[1:29:18] episcopeneur I am in the presence of the
[1:29:20] great I have I am in the presence of the
[1:29:23] day spring I am in the presence of The
[1:29:25] Great I Am
[1:29:27] foreign
[1:29:33] what did it do it caused him to confess
[1:29:35] that he was a sinner
[1:29:40] if those angels
[1:29:42] could stand up there

[1:35:27] to a bunch of quitters when we're a
[1:35:28] bunch of winners

[1:35:56] rejoicing it's what they were called to
[1:35:58] do
[1:36:05] it's time that the Traditions speak
[1:36:10] it's time to division speaking
[1:36:14] Michelangelo Angelo had built the statue
[1:36:18] of Moses
[1:36:21] he'd spend his life building
[1:36:24] he spilled his life building
[1:36:27] and when he finally come to completion
[1:36:32] when he saw what he had in his mind
[1:36:39] and he looked at him
[1:36:41] and he smote it on the knee and said
[1:36:43] speak
[1:36:45] what was it that which he'd held in his
[1:36:48] mind all of those years finally
[1:36:51] come to a completion
[1:36:55] and brothers said that he was up there
[1:36:58] looking at that in those Gardens
[1:37:00] and he said it was a god
[1:37:02] that pointed out the more
[1:37:06] he said after he got under the influence
[1:37:08] of watching The Vision come to pass he
[1:37:11] smote it and he said speak
[1:37:14] he said but Michelangelo could never put
[1:37:16] that back he could never reproduce that
[1:37:19] he said but God's going to do it
[1:37:21] [Applause]
[1:37:23] it's not up to me God is building a body
[1:37:27] that is coming to coming to the end of
[1:37:30] this age and she's bold of his bone
[1:37:32] she's life of his life she produces
[1:37:34] Miracles because she operates in his
[1:37:36] name she believes in all things are
[1:37:38] possible because he's praying in his
[1:37:40] name she accepts everything that is said
[1:37:43] about her
[1:37:45] brother Adam said when we get in
[1:37:47] speaking conditions again it's time we
[1:37:49] start speaking what the vision has said
[1:37:57] [Applause]
[1:37:59] and it seems like nothing's ever going
[1:38:01] to happen but let the God come on and
