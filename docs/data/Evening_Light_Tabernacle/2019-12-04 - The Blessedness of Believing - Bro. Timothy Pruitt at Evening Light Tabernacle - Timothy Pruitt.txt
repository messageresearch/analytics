faithful Lord faithful to the end we just thank you for that grace Lord for your call in our lives commit this servicing you Lord everything to be said and done for your glory in Jesus name [Music] hey man let's turn to second Corinthians 10 verse 3 hey man says for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ amen we let you be seated this evening like to read you this quote is I've been reading it nearly every day for the last few days and there's just really as blessed my heart is where I would like to bring the title from says hero the blessedness of believing the blessing of not trying to figure it out the blessing of just resting on God's Word and say it's true and go on hey man he said it's life it's life it's real living amen I'll read that again all the blessedness of believing that be my title tonight the blessedness of her believing the blessing of not trying to figure it out the blessing of just resting on God's word and say it's true and go on its life its life it's real living amen the blessing the blessedness of believing or being one who's able to believe because we live in a world you know that has to be everything has to be proven we live in a very scientific age and then this scientific age science wants to come and try to say well if it can't be proved by science and it's not true but you know I believe that we're not talking about even facts here we're talking about truth and what is truth he's the only one that is true amen and he is the god of truth he is truth and and you know you know that does not mean that Satan's not gonna war against us in our minds and to try to bring doubts and fear and unbelief or anything like that or if even though 100 people stand up and say it ain't true you know does that really mean that it's not true or if Satan is there to say it's not true does that mean it's not true amen but you know he's always there to war and you know our warfare is not in the fleshly realm is what David or those of the Old Testament and would be you know it's they would face a physical enemy you know sometimes I believe that would be easier you would know who the enemy is and and what it is and you know how he tries to come and you know exactly when he's coming on his ground because there's a physical presence there you know and I was not like that we have a spiritual warfare and he comes you know the greatest battle ever fought in her mind and he tries to find a place there that he can come and try to put a question and to put a question there that you have to answer you know and and and you know you know it's it's it's something that is a constant war you know the devil's like what about this and what about that you know and you know brother branham answers this she says you know there was a man one time that it officer there authored a book and made a lot of fun of him and he says you know it said in this book of all the devils it's william branham and he said he said that's what the devil tries to think he said visions and things that's of the devil he's some kind of hip not and hypnotists are working in some since super sensory perception he said see the intellectual world is always trying to figure it all out and he said that's where they tried to figure out Jesus how do you do these things what is done how do you how do you do this and he said I ask you a question was the Ministry of John was it of God or was it of man and they said we can't say and he said neither do I tell you that that's right he just went went on and from henceforth no man asked him anything he just cut him off right there he didn't tell them nothing about it it was none of their business he said he had a work to do and he finished it and he said god help us to do the same thing even God help us to do the same thing we don't have to answer the devil's questions because it's the devil's questions is not my question it's his question he ma'am he said that's right you know you go right on and just ignore the whole thing C Eve got caught up in this and she tried to answer the devil's question you know Eve was you know or Knutson not being satisfied in the beginning with a wonderful fellowship that she had with Adam and gardening and you know she had to begin to try to hunt something new some new light and the devil scene she got it and when she when you try to find something you know a little more fantastic or a little something different than the written word the devil will be right there - presented to you he said that's right he said if Eve would has just stayed with the word and there's this great sin problem would have never happened because God had promised him that they could live forever but she wanted something different and she had these questions in the woods and really hurt questions they was the devil's questions and she begins to try to answer them and begins they're trying to debate them it begins to try to come up with some kind of way of answer me said to see a man you know will try to have an intellectual faith you know this is a quote brother Brennan says the intellectual faith and you'll try to answer the devil's questions with an intellectual faith and and he said there's so many people get that today calling themselves Christians he says that's the reason you see as much carrying on as you do under the name of Christianity why it's only intellectual faith he says what do you mean by that he says men believe under salvation he said now faith cometh by hearing and the hearing of the word he said I could preach the word and you can accept it and say it's right but he said if that's as far as it goes it's just intellectual faith he said but see I said the reason people don't get healed or reason why people walk away or the reason why people fall off it's only because of an intellectual view what their mind conceives he said but the mind will reason the mind will say I can't get any better it's not getting any better I don't feel any better than I did yesterday reasoning mental theology will reason it out and say well now wait a minute I don't believe in that bunch of foolishness see your reasoning intellectual faith will do that but once that faith comes down into this compartment down here it'll never question what's up here at all it's absolutely fact it'll agree with every divine word of God he said that's the reason people don't get to where they should be it's because there's a mental conception of God and when it's just a mental Collatz its conception of God you believe it by the intellectual faith that won't ever do it it's got to be a born-again experience and this is where people gets off because they've depended upon their mental intellectual conception you know I believe the message and I believe what the Prophet said or I believe he's a prophet or I believe the way you know I believe what the pastor says and it's all faith comes by hearing but if you stop there it's only a mental conception it's only an intellectual faith but only the really the only real way to know God is to be born of God to be born of the supernatural and when you see men that are denying the message or the denying amen the very very the things that God has said in his word is why because they have tried to figure it all out with their mental conception but they've never been born of the supernatural be therefore they cannot understand the supernatural and sometimes super emit all the time I should say certain natural things cannot be figured out by a natural mind it's supernatural that's why it's called supernatural it's something beyond the natural and so men with the natural understanding or natural abilities or a wonderful or powerful brain they try to line up the things of God and you cannot even go and prove all the things in the Bible you can't prove many things that are written there we can't prove that Jesus even existed by mental conception the only way that I know that he exists is because there's a power here on this earth that I overcome the devil just like he did there Amen that there so there's a power of the Resurrection there's a power that's here today that a raised the dead there's a power here that a hill the sick there's a power here that'll save the lost there's a power here Amen that'll take an old rip it rip it sinful heart and turn it around and live above sin and live above things why because the power that was there is the power that is here today Amen it's guy that can only come by born-again experience when your faith has brought down from here into here a man he said god help us this morning or this evening now to enter into that inner life amen quit stayin out where we're toast about with every wind of doctrine and everything that comes along and don't you know the Bible says in the last days how that men will come and be like angels of light he meant Devils ministers as angels of life don't you realize that Eve was seeking new light when the devil talked to her and caused every graveyard that's here because every insane institution caused every death every sorrow every starving every dying mama why because she was searching for something else and she had a know and searching for something else and you notice he says when he was here he said lo I'm with you always and their eyes were open and they understood and Peter you know was their bosom friends with him talked with him but you know what now all of a sudden there's so many questions and and he's wondering Peter's wondering what it was he related to Christ you know it wasn't really this or wasn't really that did we really see all the things you know when Peter becomes so discouraged because of this mental conception he became so despair said after his death and it barity and he said I'm just so discouraged huh I'm just going to go fishing I'm just going to go away from here you know we get that way sometimes and if we depend on this right here and what we see with these right here it's very easy to get discouraged because we see people falling away we we see things happening and we see things around us that we can't control we don't know what to do with and if we look at these eyes and try to figure out what this pea brain we got we will be discouraged will stay discouraged and this is what Peter was he was looking at this with his mental conception of who he thought Jesus was and who he who he proclaimed that he was and all that but now it seems to be all gone and it seems to be done and dead I'm just going to go fishing now and he got discouraged and he said here he was with a mental theology but you know they believe once in the natural but when a little trial come up and went all to pieces he said I don't aim to hurt you but he said I want to tell you something correct you a little bit it shows when a man wholly has intellectual faith by saying that the Word of God that that's the Word of God I believe God rose up Jesus today he said that's all you got the first little discouragement comes in your church and away you'll go when you're going out you might be a friend to him but you don't know him in his power of his resurrection and this is where Peter was he was a friend of Jesus he had a mental conception of what he thought he was he saw only sangs and his mighty miracles and you to thought and for all the things that he saw nothing could talk him out of it but he'd had to go from a mental conception he meant down to really believe in a man and we can see what happened you know us as they went you know as he was go to the pit you know you go to Pentecost and this is what brother Branham says and he says never one time after Pentecost did that picture that preacher Peter ever saved such a thing as that again amen when he had come to those discouragement amen he would go back to experience that he had this is what we never can quit preaching the experience of the Holy Ghost because if we don't have that we have nothing but a mental conception we have nothing but a Baptist theology and this is where many are today that have walked away from this truth they don't walked away in Jesus day when he had said something to him about men but you drink my blood and y'all better walked away I mean even true believers have these moments but once Peter received the Holy Ghost it was an anchor sure he come back to those discouragements again don't tell me that when he saw the nonsense going on in the churches and even Paul that will face discouragements there's all kind of nonsense taking place in churches and things that was going on in the first churches it was all kind of stuff that and it's never stopped he's never going to stop we're gonna have me and following away we're gonna have things that are happening it's going to continue why Satan's gunz's are upon us and he's going to get those it never goes into the Holy of Holies he's going to get those that never amen go so that's why we must make our calling and election sure that it's more than just I believe or I accept the truth or I accept a way of living if something's happened on the inside of my heart it goes beyond my feelings it goes beyond all things to where you can come to that moment of discouragement and you can look that devil I'd say don't God slave me yet I'll trust him though a thousand fall at my left side and ten thousand at my rights I'm going on with Jesus hallelujah there's gotta be something deep on the inside of you it's an anchor cuz all hell is against this church all hell is blowing it and trying to push the coldness of Laodicea in here and trying to put the mug warmness opponents it's coming into our hearts burning dark churches coming to our pews it's coming to our homes it's constantly pushing against you in wave after wave after wave but in this ship of zon there's an anchor and it's an anchor that's holding the heart of a believer that no matter how many ways cracks against it no matter how many say it ain't so no matter how many distract from it and they turn away there's an anchor holding somebody and when I'm gonna can testify tonight the anchor holds sharing on a face discouragement chilling on the face but since Pentecost oh yeah hey man he says now he's if he got good reason you'll sit down and try to reason the Bible out how could he raise from the dead how these miracles and things take place in this great room with civilization science that we live in you try to reason that out so what's happening every time you're getting further away from God all the time you never know him by reasoning God is not known by reasoning God is known by faith you accept it you believe it you can't do it until something happens to you when the Holy Spirit comes in and you're not having your mind you'll have the mind of Christ when Brandon calls him Agri find great minister was down here in the south took a plane flew up to meet me some time ago he said brother branham i was reading one of your sermons and a paper there's just one thing I want to settle with you said all right he said how can you do anything else but believe he says Abraham was the father of the promised son he believed God that was imputed him to righteousness what more could Abraham do but believe I said that's correct sir that's all he could do but then God came down and gave him the seal of circumcision the confirmation of his faith come on somebody he said infusions for 30 grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby you're sealed unto the day of your Redemption if you raise up and confess Christ and say you believe in when the intellectual faith and gods never give you the Holy Ghost yet he hasn't confirmed your faith yet he said that's the confirmation is the Holy Spirit God confirmed your faith with the Holy Ghost then you believe it with your head and then until then you believe it with your head but God puts it into your heart by birth he said that kind of sounds a little fashioned brother but it's kept me all these years I've stared death in the faith and I'm ready to trust on it he said if it's good enough for me it's good enough for Paul it was good enough for Silas it was good enough all the way down it's good enough for me in Hell then it'll hold now but your intellectual faith will reason you say well now I know the Bible teaches that but let me think now the days of miracles are past pastor said so somebody said this I believe that this day we don't have that now you see you're using intellectual faith and that intellectual faith will reason with God's Word but a born-again experience for my heart will not reason it'll say God's Word is right period hey man there's no more to do with it it's right because something down here that says in itself you you have nothing to do with it it's God in the heart the intellectual faith will reason and that's what's the matter with our churches we've got away from a real old time experience of receiving the Holy Spirit this is why people can't get Church attenders down right they reason it all out but it shows they haven't got a Holy Ghost experience they got an intellectual faith they believe in Jesus they believe going to church is ok but they don't have it down in the heart they reason it away otherwise they would be in the house of God it's an intellectual faith and that intellectual faith is going to only hold people so long because somebody will come up with more intellectual than what you got and more faith in what you got hello somebody it takes a lot of faith to believe in no God and you find somebody that's got more faith in what you've got and all you're doing is intellectual against intellectual they'll win but you can take somebody as dumb as a box of rocks but he'd met God and it ain't up here but it's down on the inside of his heart they the intellectual giant nowhere they never talk him out of a God because he's met him for himself kind of like we can watch Moses he was an intellectual up here they killed one Egyptian by his own intellect but once he met the burning bush you couldn't talk him out of it no more he would go down there in defeat Egypt with his great army all that was just a meal a wife a boy and a rod why because he wasn't counting on his own intellect no more he didn't have to figure out how to defeat Pharaoh he didn't have to figure out how it's all going to happen God said you go tell him let my people go he wouldn't know what God said and God did what he said he would do hallelujah if we get people to believe like that the blessedness of a believer why because he was there nobody could talk Moses out of that experience he was there and left why I love that song said I was there when the Spirit came down he made no money and talked you out of it because there's his personal experience - you ain't a devil that can talk you out of it come on somebody but as long as it's just intellectual faith it'll reason that's what's the matter today and got away from the experience of receiving the Holy Ghost we've substituted for intellectualism aural intellectual college he said I'm not trying to support ignorance what I'm trying to say is if it comes between education and salvation I'll take salvation remember the trouble of his day we've learned all together on education and having adopted it instead of salvation we substituted then the old-fashioned Upper Room to receive the Holy Spirit for a supper room to sell and sell soups and things to pay the preacher and we don't need that we need the Bible the whole fashioned Holy Ghost spirit that old-time st. Paul revival the Bible Holy Ghost in the church again and it's here tonight hallelujah and it will only come through the experience of a new birth but the enemy is going to study our strategy with the word and if it's the intellectual faith he'll try to use the word against that you know just dealing with a situation last weekend the devil had a little girl bound up told me he spoke out of that little girl and told me said it happened when she was a little girl it's her fault she let him do it look back at that devil and I said no it ain't her fault it's your fault you did it and furthermore I'm not gonna hold a conversation with you because I'm not interested in talking to you and shut your mouth that's the first step with stopping the devil's reason and shut your mouth come on somebody don't it ain't hello you can make the arguments last and how long it shut your mouth and whatever it takes shut the mouth you never spoke out again but she took her Bible we got it into the back room and it took her Bible she was looking at me very nervously fumbling through the scriptures and she pointed to a certain scripture there in the Old Testament in the Levitical law of where damsels taking them afield and man lay with her and she should be stoned you know it devil handed me that handed her that had it a lot highlighted in her Bible listen the devil ain't using something way out yonder to try to defeat somebody he's coming right here with the word just as he did Eve and he'll defeat you as long as his intellectual faith but if his Holy Ghost faith he ain't got no answer hallelujah Amen and I looked at that and I didn't really know the situation so I handed it to the brother of the pastor there a man and he looked at that and he took that scripture and he beat the devil's teeth in he said what I see here is the same thing that happened in the garden with Eve he took a scripture and twisted it and this scripture does not apply to you this is nothing but the devil trying to twist something and try to make it George but it's not yours it's his hallelujah and I'm here to tell you this evening the sin and the doubt not believe that's not yours that's his unbelief he's just trying to put it on you but you didn't catch that thing down it's how I'm going to believe all things are possible hallelujah you never want to reason gods with God's Word you just believe it don't try to explain it no try to figure it all out you cannot figure out God it's God isn't it is the word and it's um just made to believe it's just made to believe that's our strength just accept the word anyone knows that a seed in the right ground will produce of its kind and we should just take the word and believe but Eve stop for a moment and reasoned he quoted words she quoted word God said you should not eat their own he said certainly that's right Satan said Nate and disagrees that certainly is our right but see you need a little something added know something different and if you do it then you'll be a little smarter than God and your eyes will be open she said well God said we would die Oh surely you won't die but God said you would and that settles it and that broke that great tug O'War that pulled the whole human race into death because Eve listening to it listen to a reason against God's Word it's a shame that he did she did it and it's done past but now we're here fortified and that link was made up in Christ Jesus we know that God gave us his best defense to just simply trust his word hallelujah Romans 1 8 1 moment warning verse 16 says for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ I want to make this my declaration I'm not ashamed of this message because this message is the Bible this message is Christ now I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for in it for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth it's not to the unbeliever and you will never ever get to the bottom of the unbelievers questions you'll never get to the end maybe that's a better word you'll never get to the end of an unbelievers questions Amen it's what everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also to the Greek and therein is righteousness of God revealed from what faith to faith it is written the just shall live by faith for the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and righteousness men who hold the truth in unrighteousness because that which may be known of God is manifest in them for God has showed it unto them for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world we're clearly seen being understood by the things that were made even his eternal power and Godhead so that they are without excuse because that when they knew God they glorified not him him not as God neither we're thankful but became vain in their imaginations they thought what they thought was greater than what God said what they thought they thought was greater than what God vindicated come on somebody God had vindicated himself from the body called Jesus Christ nobody even a blind man could see it come on somebody a blind man had been born blind from his side from his birth even when he when he was giving him sight he knew there could be nobody done what was done to him but God he said why here's a marvelous saying because see what happened he was born without even eyeballs and here came the Creator the very one that spoke the heavens on earth into existence and came made a few little mud balls and spit it or make mud put him into his eye sockets and said go wash and he went wash and he came back saying one of my favorite stories because the disciples say was this done because his man sinned or his mom and dad is saying that God said no Jesus said no he said this so that God can be made glorified could be glorified hey man well that's just a bunch of reason and trying to put all these things on what somebody else did or somebody else listen I'm not responsible for anybody else's sins and neither are you that's between them and God what I'm responsible to is if I believe what he said and here this little man begin to see and question him could you imagine questioning when you just seen that they couldn't they couldn't deny that this was the boy they knew it was because then they called his mom and dad they couldn't deny that that was her son but he didn't stop the questions they couldn't deny that he had our boss and he was seeing but it didn't stop the questions come on somebody they couldn't deny that something that supernaturally happened and some would take place because they'd seen this man day after day after day of begging for alms as a blind man and now he's standing before them amen talking to them as a normal man seeing them looking around seeing all the beauty of God's creation they could not deny but it didn't stop the questions because it wasn't questions from an honest heart it was questions because of their unbelief you know the Bible's plainly tells about questions it talks about Judas asking about the ointment that was given why couldn't it be sold and given to the poor the Bible says it wasn't because he didn't ask because he cared for the poor he asked because he was a thief mercy these these men wasn't asking because it was honesty there they was asking because they were unbelievers hey man but it didn't stop him and here the bottom man finally stops and he says I don't know how to answer all your questions I I don't I don't know what to say about all of this nonsense to say all I know that never since the world was formed has a man been born blind been given this sight and you don't know who he is that's the real question answer that one amen and you know you come to the distractors of this message that comes with a question after question after class 'king question because they want to believe they're asking question because something's wrong with their heart if they could get the hard question settled then all these other questions would just disappeared but I want to ask them a question never since the world amen since the time of Jesus has a ministry been on her like was in the Prophet William Brennan miracles and signs and wonders and that the hearts discerned time after time after time and you don't know who that is because they begin to lean to their own understanding the Bible told us not to probably proverbs 3 and verse 1 my son forget not my law but let thine heart keep my Commandments for the length of days long life and peace shall they add unto thee let not mercy and truth forsake thee bind them about the neck write them up on the tables of that heart so shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man trust in the Lord with all thine heart yes some can trust so far and believe he's God but can they trust all with all their heart you know what that means trust the Lord with all thy heart that means give all thy heart to the Lord it's the Holy Ghost and lean not unto that own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct their paths see Solomon told us don't lean to your own understanding but we wonder why he would say such a thing like this because that usually you know in our modern understandings you the wisdom of man is in the wisdom of man is always contrary to the Word of God you know I think that's what Solomon was trying to advise his sons was not to be illiterate not to be stupid and unlearned as far as and you know we have we have to have some you know people get the wrong idea that the message is against education no the message is not against education or becoming educated to where you can get a good job or be a CPA or be whatever nurse practitioner or doctor whatever you want to be that's not what the message is being but don't elevate your education above the Word of God education of this world is only for the things of this world come on somebody education of this world is only to obtain a job is that of this of the is that of the Eternals no jobs going to be going it's only to obtain things to take care of you here on why you're on earth whether it be money or cars or paper clothes whatever food on your table it's only for the temporary but people begin to take that what they've learned and their knowledge and and begin to exalt that above the Word of God no the Word of God always a SERPs authority over what you've learned in some school somewhere whether it be a school of education or theology the Word of God is the final answer because remember no matter how much education you get one day you got to cross over no matter how much education you've got no matter how much culture you're able to accumulate you've got to face death one day you know and I've talked with people that don't believe you know in God and this is where the spiral of unbelief takes you listen it ain't just about walking away from a thought or a theology or a-- or a beliefs system Satan's not interested in that he don't want to just get you to where you will still believe in God he's gonna take people all the way down to where that takes it all away from them and I've forgotten tough talk to message young people that have got their because of somebody's unbelief they started trying to answer the devil's questions and today they don't even believe in God and I asked the young man I said okay you've got here I don't I can't I don't I can't see I can't I don't have enough I guess intellect to understand how you got there because to me it takes more faith to believe that and to believe what I believe that there's no God and all this just come out of nothing it takes a lot of faith and and I said but you know we close our eyes and we both close our eyes same same time whatever and there's nothing what have I lost think about it there's life that we live the the what the truths that we believe the things that we believe the way we dress the way we act the way we present ourselves and we get down to the end of it and we close our eyes and there's nothing what have we really lost I said but I want to ask you we close our eyes and we get down then and we close our eyes and you realize there is a God and there is something to this afterlife then what what have you lost because one day we're all going to come to this place and no matter how much you've accumulated how much education you got how much money you got in the bank how all this intellectual knowledge one day it's going to be nothing because it's written men what that must die and after that the judgment death ain't gonna be the bad thing judgements what's gonna be bad God is not going to inquire and they're at the judgment how much schooling you got how much you accumulated on earth how much money was in your 401 K what kind of art you are plaques you got hanging on your wall whether your bachelor of art or that whatever a minister is not that's not going to be required what's going to be required is what you did with the understanding of God's Word where the requirement comes your education is fine but the word of god is life my words are life I know it's life he said know him he is the word so you can only know him by the word for he is the word that's the only way you'll know him so when a person says they have the Holy Ghost and can accept something contrary to the word it shows that ain't the real genuine Holy Ghost they've got and I'm not talking about it you know I believe that what he's saying here is not just talking about something other than the word and that's part of it but another spirit allow sin to overtake them they don't have a Holy Ghost unable to speak out of them they don't have the Holy Ghost that ain't the real Holy Ghost say God it might be a ghost he says he said I wouldn't dispute that but it isn't the Holy Ghost of Christ they take on one another spirits of the point like a group of men a certain thing he won't point to Christ with the Holy Spirit always points to Christ that's what I love about this message it always pointed to Christ if there was ever a man on this earth that could make something of himself would've been William Branham but he never pulled him into himself he putted him to Christ if you want to say something about somebody go talk about those who pointed there was people to themselves and built themselves castles and built themselves all kinds of things there's plenty to criticize if you lean to your own understanding you're gonna get off the roads right Road somewhere you can't lean on anybody else's understanding but when it comes to life find life find that real source of life that's what you hear it preached time after time after time received the Holy Ghost it'll be the desperation on everybody's heart make your calling and election sure I don't care if you've been sitting on a Pew here for 30 years make sure make sure you got the token the seal could you imagine you know I think about the different ones like you know as we spoke of even let me go with this for a minute Eve you know no doubt an intelligent person right from Adam who was the son of God in a spot no sin no place for sin must have certainly had a wonderful conception of who God was because I ever afternoon her and her husband will walk in the cool of the garden in the evening and talk face-to-face with God what a none reason thing that a person would walk face-to-face with God each day then turned to reason and reason her way away from God and it don't stop there he says we still got them today they're so easily be reason away from the Word of God after sinning in the presence of God seeing the Word of God preached the Word of God manifested to where drunkards and sinners come to an altar be converted made through creations and creatures in Christ people of ill Fame made ladies and gentlemen than then turn her right away from the blessed thing that led them to this life and be perverted off of some kind of Creed and become popular or get to what they call a better class of people why you're in the best class there is sons and daughters of God I like that company better than I wouldn't be in the presence of kings and potentates or anyone else on the earth give me that kind of people that humble bunch of people they don't know their right hand from the left but as long as they know God and they serve Him that is a celebrity of heaven Oh Lord of God these are movie stars want to have that red carpet walk and they want to address something whole can you imagine what that day is gonna be like I'm looking at some celebrities here tonight celebrities not of this world it's going to fade away not of this world that one day their Purdy in the next day they're a bunch of cankered nothing's or one day they're painted up Jezebel's and they would take that off you'd be scared to look at him but I'm looking at true celebrities Amen celebrities in God's Hall of Fame that when Noah would turn away and would not reason the Word of God but he would go forward day after day after day he didn't try to answer all the questions could you imagine the questions that were there thousands of questions what do you mean how's it going to be this we talking about here know what you lied about this you said it was going to do this in Inked life you've done all that not all kind of he just turned away from all of that and put another nail in cut another board because he'd heard God's Word he had a commission he has something that he was not leaning or what he maybe he didn't I know he didn't understand at all he couldn't have understood at all with this human ability but he had heard from another land he had heard from another dimension and God told him how to build a boat what to build it out of what were to put each plane the dimensions thereof how tall how wide and he just went according to what God plans and here the question came and the question came and question can he just kept on going kept on going until one day he walked into that boat and the door shut and they were still hollering out questions and mocking and making fun but all of a sudden they begin to thunder and they begin to rain and they begin to realize I missed it come on somebody I believe that's weren't we're ahead they know we're not going to the tribulation but you understand hey man I know there is a boat called sign people can make fun of it and they can my market and they can make fun of her but she's going to go to the other Shore and I'm getting on this boat this boat is not a man-made food this boat was given by the authority of the mighty angel and he built it just right he made it just big enough he knows how many people's gonna be on this boat he knows exactly how many people is gonna ride ain't gonna go and if you stay with this boat you're gonna go all the way cuz we're going through hallelujah we're going through I'm not leaning to what I can understand by how I can make it all come out I know he said it therefore I believe it [Applause] hallelujah hey man could you imagine Abraham leaning to think you told you told my questions there's plenty of questions Abraham are you kidding me you're gonna have a baby how old are you but I'm 90 years old what I thought I got your birth certificate I got proof here how old you are they didn't matter they had all the facts but the facts wouldn't the truth the truth said you're gonna have a son it didn't matter what the facts said come on somebody the truth said you're gonna have a son but what about Sarah amen all of a sudden the angel visitor who said you're gonna have it by Sarah just ready is that you're gonna have it by Sarah Sarah came into the prophecy how old is shaver hell jeez this old that's what I thought got the proofs here I got that I got the facts here it's impossible we got scientific proof and facts it's impossible for an old man or a woman this way past he's been there amen she never has no life how you gonna ha ha ha ha but that wasn't the truth a mare Abraham just kept walking he kept going forward he was walking in a vision he was walking in the center Lord you can say well I know Abraham make mistakes I know him had faults and he had failures yes he did but I look over here in the New Testament they don't mention not one of them he said hey bruh ham staggered not at the promise of God but was strong in the faith he kept going he wasn't worried about the question cuz it wasn't his question it was the devil's questions he kept going forward and one day he took that last step and back to a young man he went Laura departing the high Sarah behind and took that same step back to young woman again that was the truth and the truth was vindicated Isaac came forth [Applause] hallelujah he didn't linger zone understanding looking at his own body dead said about he dead he didn't look at that he looked at what the truth said hello don't you understand the truth it's not a fact the truth is a person that's the only thing that's really true is him he believed instead of unbelieving he caught that those things which are not as though they were which was absolutely against human reason he didn't reason it he just believed it there was no reason that could be proved that the baby would be born the woman was about 25 years past menopause her body was good as a dead he was a husband he was 100 years old and here he was still giving God praise 25 years later against all kinds of understanding but by faith he knew God the truth would keep the truth hallelujah what a Joshua would have leaned is on to understanding when he's fighting he just spoke it and said let the son you stay there among you don't move questions but the truth spoke hey man you don't lean on do you understanding when you're sick are you sitting in the wheelchair you're dying with cancer or heart trouble doctor says you're gonna die if you lean to your understanding you'll die but you don't lean to that you don't lean to what the mind can say and how how it can prove this or prove that you don't you don't lean to know that you keep going on forward what if David would have listened to Saul's the ology Goliath would overtake in their story no doubt would have been wrote different but in lean to what he understood he leaned to an experience I've been with God I know what he can do and if he can do it on a bear he can do it against the lioness for listening ain't nothing to him hey man amen that's what we have to do tonight you cannot lean to your own understanding but he goes on so many Mary questions won't a STONER because he's having a baby out of wedlock not knowing this is a very life of God men and their own understanding trying to kill God hello somebody still doing it today she never leaned her own understanding that am at one we could have a baby without a husband she just said be it unto me according to the truth how am I going to do it she didn't say how am I going to do it when will I do it houses going to take place the Angels God said the Holy Ghost overshadow thee and that holy thing will be born of thee shall be called the son of God she said Behold the hands maiden of the Lord she didn't take a reason it's said it couldn't be done she said Here I am take me Lord what about the woman with the blood issue doctor says there's no hope it's over you're good as dead got weaker all the time but by faith there's no scripture telling her if I could just touch the hem of her garment him of his garment but by faith she slipped around and touched him she walked back and sit down jesus said who touched me look around till they found her she felt at that moment her own body she couldn't prove it then but she felt something take place she didn't reason she didn't worry about it she just went on in faith and the Bible said he is now the high priest that can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but if you can get beyond all that reason and then doubt and just reach out by faith then the same high priest will touch you hallelujah my goodness you say well brother 10 was it what about it is there
