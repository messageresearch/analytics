TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] When I can understand my father's leading and it seems to be a hard and a cruel fate. Still I hear that gentle whisper pleading. God is working. God is faithful. Only wait. I am with you. I will never leave you. This is for my glory. You are a testimony. of my power, of my love. Oh my sweet, sweet life. Lift your head up high and one day you'll see. Why it had to be this way. This is only for a moment. [Music] If my eyes are on the sparrows and I make the flowers grow, trust me when I tell you it's all in my control. For you are my beloved. I do all things for your good. Oh my child. Oh my child, I am with you. I will never leave you. This is for my glory. You are a testimony of my power, [Music] of my love. Oh my sweet sweet. Lift your head up high and one day you'll see why it had to be this way. This is only for a moment. [Music] Turn your eyes upon Jesus. look full in his wonderful ways and the things of this world will grow strangely dim in the light of his glory and grace. I am with you. I will never leave you. This is for my glory. You are a test. Don't know me. Of my power, of my love. Oh my sweet, sweet, I lived your head of mine. And one day you'll see why it had to be this way. And I'll hold you in my arms and wipe your tears [Music] away. This is only for a moment. [Applause]
