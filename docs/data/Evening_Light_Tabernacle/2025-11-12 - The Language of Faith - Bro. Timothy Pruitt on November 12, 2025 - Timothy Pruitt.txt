Guide the hand of the physician, Lord. How many testimonies [music] have come in where we've heard that just at the last moment? You caused [music] something special to happen in that room. Lord, it's only something that you can do. We're depending upon [music] you. We love you tonight. How many would just lift your hands and say, "Lord, I love you." The children are [music] here reporting for duty. those that can't make it, we certainly want to hold them up in prayer tonight, [music] thinking of Brother Jonathan, Lord, and the asthma condition that keeps afflicting him. We know what the prophet [music] said about asthma. Just pray that you'd deliver Brother Jonathan tonight. [music] Your mighty hand be shown powerful once again. Lord, as the tithes [music] and the offerings receive tonight, we pray that you bless it, multiply it, bless the giver tonight, we pray, committing the service to you and all things [music] in Jesus name.

I believe you're [music] my portion. I believe [singing] you're [music] more than [singing] [music] Jesus. You are all [music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many believe in him [music] tonight? &gt;&gt; Can't believe in anything else, but we can believe in our Jesus. Amen. [music] He's all that we need. Amen. Let's just go to him in prayer. Father, come to you tonight, Lord, once again, [music] just to bow our hearts before you, Lord, and just say how much we're thankful to [music] be able to serve you in this time that we're living in, Lord. This world is just seems to be in chaos all around us and things happening very quickly as we see prophecies being fulfilled [music] and Lord we're we got our eyes on you and we're looking for your appearing Lord just any day now the dead in Christ to arise [music] we to be changed Lord in a moment and twinkling of an eye God what a day that'll be [music] I believe I believe what you said and I believe you will do what you said and I just commit Lord, [music] this service to you, Lord, you see all the ones that are here that you've gathered here tonight, different ones, visitors, local folks, [music] everyone. Father, we just come together and put our licks of fire together, Lord, just to [music] have fellowship with you and with each other. We thank you for this opportunity in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. [music] You turn to Markap 11 and verse 22. [clears throat] like to speak to you this evening on the language of faith or faith vocabulary, however you would like to title it. But Markap 11 and verse 22, it said, "And Jesus answered, saith unto them, have faith in God, for verily I say unto you, that whosoever shall say unto this mountain, be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea, and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe, that those things which he saith shall come to pass, he shall have whatsoever he saith. Therefore, I say unto you, whatsoever ye desire when you pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them. Amen. God bless. You can be seated. [clears throat] I think it's very uh something that we should take note of that Jesus didn't say, you know, for us to go get somebody else and speak or to get a preacher and have him speak or or get a prophet and have him speak or even Jesus himself speak. But he said that whosoever shall say to this mountain, be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea, and shall not doubt in his heart, he shall believe that those things which he said, &gt;&gt; which he said. How many he or she's are here today. Amen. He say shall come to pass, and he shall have whatsoever he saith. So in our scripture reading, Jesus is letting us know that words spoken in faith have power. Amen. What we say matters. And how we say it matters. We either are going to speak in doubt or we're going to speak in faith. One or the other controls us. Amen. You know when spa when faith speaks, it speaks in tones of trust. Trust. Lord, I believe. Or it speaks of of expectation. God will provide. It it speaks of surrender. Not my will but your will be done. It speaks of praise. Amen. Great is thy faithfulness. Even when I don't see it happening, I still believe. Amen. Faith look will look at a storm and it'll start praising the God who calms a storm. Amen. Unbelief, you know, also has a language, you know, when unbelief speaks. It says, "Hath God really said?" We heard, Amen, the serpent in the Bible, we can read in Genesis 3 and verse one. This is where he interjected unbelief into the words of uh uh into the into the thoughts of man. Hath God really said? In Psalm 78 it says, "Can God furnish?" So this has has God really says or can God or you know and then and brings it on down to us in Numbers chapter 13. We can't. It's impossible. Amen. That's what the spies said as they would look into the land. It's impossible. We're not able to go up. You know, when they said that, they said, "We can't do it. We We can't have We We can't We can't take the land. We can't have our own revival. Everything's against us. The Amorites are there. The Hittites are there. The The Jericho is walled up. We look like grasshoppers." But Joshua and Caleb, they refused to speak the language of unbelief. &gt;&gt; They refused to speak what was what was coming out of the other 10 spies mouth. And and then Caleb would say, "You know what? We're more than able to take it." Amen. They begin to speak the language of faith and and they begin to speak NOT NOT NOT GOD is able, we are able. &gt;&gt; Amen. God's already given it to us. God's already promised it to us. So, it only takes us, amen, to grab a hold of the the language of faith and begin to speak and to speak faith over what God has already given us. And what God has said, God settles it. Amen. So, therefore, we can have healings. We can have miracles. We can have revivals. We can have blessings. Why? Because God said so. And if I take the spirit of faith and the language of faith and I begin to speak it, amen, we can HAVE A TRUE PENTECOST. We can have a true individual revival. We can HAVE IT. WHY? GOD SAID SO. AND GOD keeps his promises. But you know, unbelief will come back around and say, "Well, unless I see something, then I will not. Then I will believe." That's what Thomas would say. unless I see the scars or if I see what you know what's really happened then I will believe. But that's that's the language of of unbelief. But faith that's not its language. Faith says no matter if I cannot see if I cannot see one little grain of sand moving off of that mountain, I'm still going to speak the word of God. I'm still going to say what God said. So fear instead of faith, amen, is seeing circumstances instead of promises. When you have faith and unbelief begins to speak, you're seeing circumstances instead of promises. You're you're complaining instead of gratitude. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're focused on your lack instead of what God has provided. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you have pride instead of humility. THEREFORE, YOU TRUST YOURSELF INSTEAD OF THE WORD of God. And finally, rebellion over obedience. You refuse, Amen, the word of God. and you lean upon your own understanding. &gt;&gt; This is what takes people out of the house of God. This is what takes people, Amen, away from God as they begin to speak the language of unbelief. Amen. They begin to speak the vocabulary unbelief. I'm a nobody. I'm a no I'm no good. I I'm a I'm I'm I'm a I'm lost. I I'm unsavable. I There's no hope for me. Listen, you're not lost. You're not unsavable. The very amazing part about it tonight that you would even have a desire to be here. It proves the very point that you are not unsavable. Amen. BUT THERE'S STILL SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE OF YOU. NO MATTER how far you went, no matter how far you've gone, AMEN. NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU SPOKE THE LANGUAGE OF UNBELIEF, THERE'S SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE OF YOU THAT CAN CHANGE YOUR LANGUAGE. &gt;&gt; IT CAN CHANGE YOUR THOUGHTS. IT CAN CHANGE YOUR THINKING. IT CAN CHANGE YOU FROM I'M LOST TO I'M SAVED. AMEN. So faith has a voice and unbelief has a voice. &gt;&gt; Faith is voice is trusting. Unbelief's voice is doubting. Faith's voice is thankful. Unbelief's voice is complaining. Amen. Faith's voice is hopeful. Amen. Unbelief's voice is fearful. Faith's voice is obedient. Unbelief's voice IS RESISTANT. FAITH VOICE IS FOCUSED ON GOD. UNBELIEF'S voice is focused ON YOURSELF OR YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES. FAITH'S VOICE IS PEACEFUL. UNBELIEF'S VOICE IS ANXIOUS. AMEN. FAITH'S VOICE IS CONFIDENT IN THE PROMISE. UNBELIEF'S VOICE IS CONTROLLED BY SIGHT. FAITH VOICE IS WORSHIP. AMEN. AN unbelief for voice is worrisome. &gt;&gt; Amen. So speaking unbelief produces something. It produces something in your life. It produces doubt which produces instability. It produces fear which produces anxiety which brings disobedience which brings a hardened heart which it brings spiritual blindness. It all comes from what comes out of your mouth. &gt;&gt; This is what the Bible said. Proverbs said, "Amen. Life and DEATH IS IN THE power of the tongue." IT'S VERY IMPORTANT WHAT HOW YOU SPEAK. AMEN. ABOUT YOURSELF. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT HOW YOU SPEAK ABOUT OTHERS. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT WHAT YOU SPEAK ABOUT GOD. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE WATCH WHAT COMES OUT OF OUR MOUTH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. So the but the words that are spoken faith, if you speak them in faith, this word word spoken faith actually created the whole universe. &gt;&gt; So faith is a creative language. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; It's a creative language. Amen. It creates atmospheres. When God said, "Let there be light," there was light. So the very first words and scriptures are spoken in faith. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. GOD SPOKE THESE things into existence showing that faith language creates before it sees. &gt;&gt; That's what brother Brandham talked about. He said you put a well body before YOU AND YOU WALK towards it. &gt;&gt; How you walk towards it. Amen. You don't just take these two legs and walk TOWARDS THEM. NO, IT'S BY FAITH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And speaking faith, I AM HEALED. WHY ARE YOU SAYING THAT? CUZ HIS WORD SAYS I'M HEALED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. I AM DELIVERED. WHY ARE YOU SAYING THAT? BECAUSE HIS WORD SAYS I'M DELIVERED. &gt;&gt; I AM SAVED. HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT? BECAUSE HIS WORD SAYS I'M SAVED. &gt;&gt; So faith doesn't wait for evidence. &gt;&gt; It speaks with authority that's rooted in trust in God. What God says God will do. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's just as simple. You know, Brother Brham said it like this. He said just as simple as trying to hide behind some kind of church doctrine. Instead of just coming out and saying you don't have no faith, just say it. If you don't have faith, just say, he said, just go ahead and admit I don't have faith. Cuz he says, Satan never received the Holy Ghost. He ain't got nothing to give you faith. It's God that's got the faith. When you're filled with God, you're filled with faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you're not, IF YOU'RE THE SON OF GOD, YOU'RE LIKE GOD. SO HE SPEAKS THE WORD AND IT CREATES ITSELF. HIS WORD THE CREATIVE POWER. HOW'S THE WORLD COME HERE? HE MADE IT OUT OF THINGS WHICH ARE NOT. &gt;&gt; I know I know science wants to tell us that two particle where them two particles come from. &gt;&gt; I mean all of a sudden out in the space of nothingness met and boom we had a big bang. Yeah there was a big bang. All right. It was let there be. &gt;&gt; Amen. AND THE BANG WENT FORTH OUT OF THE MOUTH OF God and his word spoken. He had faith THAT WHAT HE SAID was going to come to pass. &gt;&gt; So he put it to test already. So when he gives it to you, he says, "You speak the word. &gt;&gt; YOU SPEAK TO THE MOUNTAIN and see what happens. YOU SAY YOUR MOUNTAIN'S GOT TO HEAR YOUR VOICE." &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH JUST TO HEAR THE VOICE. I KNOW WE GET IN THIS IDEA, WELL, IF I CAN JUST get a preacher to say SOMETHING OVER ME. IF I CAN JUST GET him to do this. IT AIN'T ABOUT A PREACHER. IT'S ABOUT YOU BELIEVING WHAT GOD SAID AND PUT IT IN YOUR MOUTH AND SPEAK IT AND WATCH THE RESULTS HAPPEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. He said, "Let there be." Here it is. He believed his own word. Abraham had obedient faith. God spoke to Abraham and said, "I want you to sojourn in a foreign land." Amen. What did Abraham say? Well, let me let me let me look make sure I got provisions. Make sure I I got the money. I He didn't said he he JUST SAID, "I WILL GO." AND HE STARTED FOLLOWING AND HE LEFT EVERYTHING FAMILIAR AND HE WAS GUIDED ONLY BY WHAT GOD SAID BY GOD'S PROMISES. HE DIDN'T ASK FOR A MAP. HE RESPONDED WHEN GOD MOVED, HE MOVED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; So the language of faith says, "I will go even when the destination is not seen." &gt;&gt; Did you hear that? &gt;&gt; I know we want to see things happen. You know, we're so bound by these natural senses that we got to see it before I believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. But that's not how it works. Not with faith, not with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's things happening in the realms of this building that we can't see with our natural eyes. &gt;&gt; There's there's radio radio waves and TV waves that are running through this building. You can't see them. That's right. But if you have a right the right equipment, you can pick it up and bring it right into right to where you can see what is happening in the unseen world. Amen. Well, if that can happen in the natural sense AND WE BECOME SO COMMON TO US THAT WE DON'T THINK NOTHING ABOUT turning a radio on or turning a t a TV screen ON OR WHATEVER AND we see a picture and we don't think that's a supernatural thing. &gt;&gt; It didn't happen hundreds of years ago. WE ARE LIVING IN A SUPERNATURAL TIME. Come on, somebody. Amen. where you can JUST TURN A DEVICE ON AND IT PICKS UP AN UNSEEN THING AND BRINGS IT BEFORE YOUR EYES. WELL, LET ME TELL YOU, IF YOU COULD DO THAT WITH A NATURAL THING, &gt;&gt; DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND THERE'S SPIRITUAL THINGS THAT ARE HAPPEN ALSO, THERE'S ANGELS OF FIRE THAT ARE MOVING AROUND THIS BUILDING AND IF GOD CAN GET A RECEIVING STATION HERE IN THIS BUILDING, HE CAN TUNE YOU IN TO SEE, HEY, THERE'S MORE THAN WHAT I CAN SEE WITH MY [screaming] EYES GOING ON. THERE'S MORE FOR ME THAN THERE IS AGAINST ME. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. This is what Rebecca responded with when she came and she found I eleaser at the well and Eleazar was pray just made the prayer God who whatever damsel would say yes yes I'll give you a drink but I also water your camel and let let her be the one. Here comes this little girl and she comes this young lady. She comes walking down to a well and and he asked for a drink. She said, "Well, I'll not only give you a drink but I'll also water your camel." That was a big thing. &gt;&gt; It wasn't an easy task. Amen. to give all them. There was a lot of trips down in that well and a lot of lot of bucket hauling. But listen, there was SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE of her that made her respond. AND SHE SPOKE NOT DOUBT. SHE SPOKE FAITH. &gt;&gt; Even when she didn't see the destination clearly, she didn't SEE SHE HAD NEVER MET ISAAC. SHE SHE HAD NEVER SEEN HIM. She didn't see a picture. She didn't get a facetime. SHE DIDN'T GET NONE OF THAT. &gt;&gt; BUT SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE OF HER, THEY SAID, "WELL, LET'S ASK HER AND SEE WHAT SHE WOULD DO." SHE'S RESPONDED, "I WILL [screaming] GO." &gt;&gt; Come on. It's no different than one of you OR TO MANY OF YOU THAT CAME TO THE LORD AT AN ALTAR SOMEWHERE. THERE WAS SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE AND THE CHOICE WAS GIVEN AND SAID, "WILL YOU GO?" THERE WAS SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE THAT PUSHED PAST ALL THAT DOUBT, PUSHED PAST ALL THAT SIN THAT THE DEVIL TRIED TO COVER YOU UP WITH AND SAID, "I WILL [screaming] GO. [applause] Faith has a language. [snorts] &gt;&gt; When Rebecca was asked if she would go, she she chose faith. Not not well, let me let me check this out. How many how many cows does he own? How, you know, does he have a good house? Well, what's he got? You know, is he good-look? She had asked none of that. She'd have responded in faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. You [snorts] know, Daniel and his friends Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, they spoke courage in the face of a fire. Their faith did not depend on the outcome. Their faith depended on their God. &gt;&gt; Even if he does not save us, we want you to know Cain will not serve your gods. So, it wasn't dependent on the outcome. Well, I'll have faith if I got a good outcome. That's not faith. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Faith is believing no matter what the outcome is. Amen. Faith speaks defiance to fear and devotion beyond deliverance. It is not worried about what is going to happen in the future. It only SPEAKS THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. So this is where Mary Mary when she's walking down to the well she said the angel appears to her and says bold a hands MADE OF THE LORD HIGHLY FAVORED AND SHE LOOKS AND SHE HEARS ALL the what's going to happen. WHAT WAS HER RESPONSE? WELL LET ME SEE how can this I don't know. I don't know if I can DO IT. NO, BE IT UNTO ME. &gt;&gt; THERE WAS A LANGUAGE OF FAITH. SO FAITH'S WORDS ARE YES, LORD. &gt;&gt; THEY RESPOND WITH A YES. AND THROUGH THAT SURRENDER, IT'LL MAKE WAY FOR A MIRACLE. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on. Did you catch it? When you say yes, that's a time the gates are open for a miracle. When you begin to SPEAK THE WORD OF GOD, IT OPENS UP THE POSSIBILITY FOR A MIRACLE TO TAKE PLACE IN YOUR LIFE. WHEN YOU BEGIN TO RESPOND WITH, "YES, LORD, I WILL GO. YES, I'LL LAY ASIDE MY SINS. YES, I'LL LAY ASIDE MY UNBELIEF. YES, I WILL WALK WITH YOU. I DON'T CARE WHERE YOU LEAD, I WILL FOLLOW." &gt;&gt; YES, LORD. It'll open up the possibility of a miracle for you. &gt;&gt; But so many people, you know, they ask God to move and they don't really expect God to do it some reason. Well, you know, but when you ask God to move, expect God to move. Don't wait to see if he will. Prepare for him to arrive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. That's faith. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. PREPARE FOR HIM TO MOVE. PREPARE FOR HIM TO SUPPLY. IF YOU HAVE A NEED, YOU ASK GOD, I HAVE A NEED. WELL, PREPARE FOR HIM TO SUPPLY THE NEED. &gt;&gt; Come on, SOMEBODY. IF YOU'RE SICK AND YOU SAY, GOD, I NEED A HEALING. WE'LL PREPARE FOR HIM TO HEAL YOU. AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. HOW? WHY? I DON'T KNOW WHY. WHY? CUZ HIS WORD SAID SO. THAT'S WHY. &gt;&gt; When you ask God for a new home, start packing up your boxes. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Come on. Position yourself in a place to move with him. Be ready and expectant. Don't sit back and see if God's if God's word's going to come to pass. Start expecting it to come to pass. You know like like the people years ago gathered in the church to pray for rain. The crops were burning up. Severe drought was happening. One [snorts] man became convinced that God heard their prayers. So you know what he did? He went outside and took his saddle off his horse and put it up somewhere where it wouldn't get wet. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; He was preparing for God to answer his prayer. Well, I'll wait till my saddle gets wet before I take. No, you prepare for God to move. &gt;&gt; Prepare for him to answer. You know, hey, don't don't you say, "Well, I've been waiting a long time." Well, it doesn't matter. Waiting is part of the part of the seasons that you go through. &gt;&gt; That ain't the time to give up. That's the time to prepare. &gt;&gt; God, that's why he said, "He that knockketh, it shall be open. HE THAT SEEKETH, IT SHALL BE FOUND." WHAT IS IT? IT'S A PLACE OF PREPAREDNESS. IT'S NOT JUST STANDING back and twiddling your thumbs or getting on this or that and WORRIED ABOUT SOME. NO, I'M LOOKING FOR GOD TO MOVE. I'M LOOKING FOR GOD TO ANSWER. I'M LOOKING FOR GOD TO DO WHAT HE SAID HE'S GOING TO DO. THEREFORE, I'M NOT GOING TO SPEAK MY DOUBTS. I'M NOT GOING TO SPEAK MY FRUSTRATION. I'M NOT GOING TO SPEAK WHAT'S AROUND ME OR WHAT I SEE OR MY CIRCUMSTANCES. I'M NOT GOING TO SPEAK, AMEN, BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF MY PRAYERS BEING ANSWERED. I'M NOT EVEN TALKING ABOUT THAT. I'M TALKING ABOUT HIS WORD. HE SAID IT. I BELIEVE IT. HE SAID IT. IT IS DONE. [applause] &gt;&gt; Start preparing for rain. &gt;&gt; You've been asking for it. Prepare for it. [snorts] &gt;&gt; There's a language of faith even in prayer. Father, I thank you that you hear me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, most of our Well, I I my prayer didn't even hit the ceiling. I don't think I tell you I just cuz I am just not a worthy person. I tell you, I don't. Thank you, Lord, for you have heard my prayer. &gt;&gt; I know you're working even when I don't see it yet. &gt;&gt; YOUR EAR IS NOT DEAF. YOU DELIGHT IN THE prayers of your people. &gt;&gt; Let your WILL BE DONE. THEREFORE, I AM TRUSTING IN YOUR TIMING. &gt;&gt; I know we want our timing. You know, we're we're people, we want it real quick. We ain't we ain't we ain't waiting around for nothing. &gt;&gt; Back in the day, they didn't mind waiting. They wait. But today, we don't want to wait for nothing. We want a microwave. We want to We want We want to We We travel quick. We do everything quick. And so, when it comes to God, we want it quick. We've been programmed that way. That ain't the way God works. &gt;&gt; It's been 6,000 years since the fall of man. It ain't quick. &gt;&gt; We have We' have thought, well, man, it' be over in a few seconds. That ain't the way God works. It's cogs of prophecy grind slow, but sure, &gt;&gt; but they're moving. You may not can see it sometimes. You wonder, my what's happened? Listen. And they get, you know how it gets, it gets right down every We're going way back here now, but back in the day of real to reals, I know there's a lot of people don't even know maybe. How many know what real to real is? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Had to use have these two reel. I can still barely remember them. I'm not quite old enough to actually have used a whole lot of them, but it had these two reels. And you could watch as one get and as it getting closer to the end, this one starts spinning faster and faster and faster faster. [snorts] done. &gt;&gt; But it seemed like we would take it because I remember I do. Oh Lord, give myself a trouble. I do remember listening to a tape and I'd watch that reel. When ain't can I go out and play? This ain't never going to get done. And it's how in the world I got to go. I got to go. I can't. and all of a sudden done. This is exactly how the prophecies are taking place. Brother Bram talked about when Jesus was on the cross, thousands of prophecies were fulfilled &gt;&gt; very quickly in just a few hours. This is exactly what's going to happen in this exodus we're in. &gt;&gt; It's been seemed like for 20 years, 30 years, 40 years, 50, how long you been in the mess? It been moving real slow. When we going to get out of here? When we going to get out? How I don't think it's ever going to happen. All said, &gt;&gt; the dead in Christ rise. &gt;&gt; We go to meet him in the air and it's finished. &gt;&gt; But we WANT IT IN OUR TIME. LISTEN, WE GOT TO TRUST GOD'S TIMING. &gt;&gt; WE GOT TO TRUST HIM ON AND HIS TIMING FOR OUR FUTURE AND HIS TIMING FOR OUR MATE AND HIS TIMING FOR OUR HEALING AND HIS TIMING FOR EVERYTHING WE DO. WE HAVE TO TRUST IN GOD'S TIMING. GOD KNOWS EXACTLY THE RIGHT TIME TO MOVE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Let your will be done. I trust your timing. So we get want to go through some scriptures to to hear about the l hear the language of faith. That's the word the language of faith. I can do all things through Christ who strengthened me. Christ strengthened me. I am able and I am not alone. &gt;&gt; With God all things are possible. What looks impossible to me is always possible with God. &gt;&gt; FOR WE WALK BY FAITH and not by sight. So even WHEN I DON'T SEE IT, I TRUST WHAT GOD has said. &gt;&gt; HE HE IS FAITHFUL WHO MADE THE PROMISE. GOD WILL DO WHAT HE SAID. His word does not fail. &gt;&gt; WHEN I'M AFRAID, I WILL TRUST YOU. FEAR MAY COME, BUT MY TRUST, MY FAITH WILL STAND FIRM IN THE TIME WHEN fear arises. &gt;&gt; The Lord is my light and my salvation. Whom shall I fear? In other words, darkness cannot stay where his light is. &gt;&gt; GOD HAS NOT GIVEN US A SPIRIT OF FEAR, BUT OF POWER AND LOVE AND A SOUND MIND. FEAR HAS NO VOICE HERE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THIS MICROPHONE HAS NO VOICE UNLESS I GIVE MY VOICE TO IT. &gt;&gt; SO FEAR HAS NO VOICE UNLESS YOU GIVE YOUR VOICE TO IT. &gt;&gt; Come on, SOMEBODY. FAITH HAS NO VOICE UNLESS YOU GIVE YOUR VOICE TO IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. ENGLISH HAS NO VOICE. IT'S JUST ENGLISH. IT'S JUST WORDS ON A PAPER SOMEWHERE OR SO. BUT UNLESS SOMEBODY WILL BEGIN TO SPEAK IT OR SOMEBODY BEGIN TO SAY IT, IT HAS NO POWER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; The Lord is my shepherd and I shall not want. Therefore, I can say my needs are met. &gt;&gt; My shepherd provides. &gt;&gt; My God shall supply all your needs according his riches and glory. He provides more than enough for every need. Amen. The Lord is with me. I WILL NOT BE AFRAID. GOD IS HERE WITH ME. I am not alone. I am not IN THIS BY MYSELF. THEREFORE, I HAVE NO REASON to fear. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I will NEVER LEAVE YOU NOR FORSAKE YOU. EVEN IN SILENCE, GOD IS right there near you. &gt;&gt; Seen something today. Somebody said said, "Well, I hadn't heard God. I can't hear God's voice. I He said it says something along these lines. Says, "Normally, when somebody's right next to you, they're not hollering." &gt;&gt; He promised he would never leave us or forsake us. &gt;&gt; You are not alone. &gt;&gt; Even in his silence, seems like I haven't heard. God is still there. &gt;&gt; He's still right. Don't let the devil talk you into that. Well, God's left you. God doesn't care about you. God doesn't know about you. God doesn't He's not interested in you. He's not. No, God's right there. &gt;&gt; He promised he would never leave us or FORSAKE YOU. BE STILL AND KNOW THAT I AM GOD. I WILL REST IN HIS POWER AND HIS PEACE. NO WEAPON FORMED AGAINST YOU SHALL PROSPER. &gt;&gt; This is the LANGUAGE OF FAITH. NO, NO WEAPON FORMED AGAINST YOU SHALL PROSPER. WHAT COMES AGAINST ME CANNOT OVERCOME ME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WE ARE MORE THAN CONQUERORS THROUGH HIM WHO LOVED US. THROUGH HIS LOVE, I WIN. NOT BY MIGHT, BUT BY GRACE. &gt;&gt; NOT BY what I CAN DO, BUT WHAT HE'S ALREADY DONE. [snorts] &gt;&gt; This is the victory that has overcome the world. Our faith. Therefore, my faith is not fragile. It is victorious. &gt;&gt; Amen. I might need to say that one more time again. My faith is not fragile. &gt;&gt; It is victorious. &gt;&gt; So you speak faith even when you don't feel worthy. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Cuz you you go by feelings. My goodness, you probably never speak faith. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because a lot of But your feelings a lie to you. Amen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Don't tell me cuz you can get all kind of symptoms that'll sure enough lie to you. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm having a heart attack or I'm having this or I'm having that. And it's just an ache in the muscle. It's a nerve pitch. But your symptoms will try to convince you that you're having a heart attack. &gt;&gt; It'll lie to you. And it's just the same not just in the body, but also in the emotional realms. things will happen and your symptoms your symptoms will begin to lie to you and begin to build up things in you and build up animosities AND BITTERNESS AND ALL KIND OF THINGS THAT ARE HAPPEN BECAUSE IT'S TRYING TO STOP YOU FROM SPEAKING faith &gt;&gt; so even when I don't feel worthy I can still speak the word of God &gt;&gt; because why it's not dependent on my worth and this is dependent on him what he said in 1 John 4 and 10 herein is love not that we love God but that he loves me or loves us. &gt;&gt; Oh, HALLELUJAH. IT ISN'T BECAUSE I LOVED HIM. IT'S BECAUSE HE LOVED ME. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad about that? Even when you didn't love him, even when you didn't even think ABOUT HIM, HE WAS FAR AWAY FROM YOU, GOD STILL LOVES YOU. &gt;&gt; And he sent his son to be a perpetuation for our sins. said in Ephesians 1 and verse4 through 6, according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love, having predestinated us in the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved. So it's not me if I'm worthy, it's him. He's worthy. So faith vocabulary speaks I have been made worthy. I have been made accepted. I AM CHOSEN. I AM HIS. I BELONG TO JESUS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; DOESN'T MATTER WHAT I FEEL LIKE. IT'S MATTER WHAT HIS WORD SAYS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; So we're to have faith and believe. And if you're ordained to eternal life, Jesus said, "No man can come to me anyhow except the father draw him." That's right. And if you're ordained to eternal life to see and believe, you will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how much the devil tries to pour over the top of you, just like concrete over a seed of grass. But if that grass is ordained to life, it's going to come to life. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how much concrete you put over, how much rock you try to crush it with. It does not matter. If it's ordained to life, it's going to come to life. And if you are ordained TO ETERNAL LIFE, THERE AIN'T ENOUGH DEVILS TO KEEP YOU FROM IT. &gt;&gt; THERE AIN'T ENOUGH SIN THAT HE CAN PUT OVER YOUR LIFE. ENOUGH MUCK OF THE WORLD THAT HE CAN COVER YOU WITH. IF GOD HAS PUT A SEED ON THE INSIDE OF YOU, IT'S GOING TO COME TO LIFE. &gt;&gt; Cuz there's a drawing power that is greater than the sin that holds you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If you're ordained to eternal life to see and believe, you will. if you want. If you're not, it's like pouring water on a duck's back. It'll do no good at all. No matter how much you try to explain it, those who God has chosen before the foundation of the world, if you're chosen God, you were not chosen here, you were chosen before the world began. &gt;&gt; So that tells me if I wasn't chosen here, I can't be unchosen here. &gt;&gt; Hello. If I was not chose here, I cannot be unchos here. &gt;&gt; God does not change his mind. &gt;&gt; I'm thankful about that. I'm thankful he's not some fickle man that get up one day, love you one day, and hate you the next, got a problem with you one day, and putting his arms around you THE NEXT DAY. THAT'S NOT GOD. IF GOD LOVES YOU, HE'LL ALWAYS LOVE YOU. &gt;&gt; IF GOD CHOSE YOU, HE'LL ALWAYS CHOOSE YOU. HE WILL NOT UNCHOOSE YOU. AMEN. &gt;&gt; You're chosen before the world began. Therefore, faith knows no defeat. Faith is perfect. Faith brings things when there's no things to be brought. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Faith creates. Faith takes away doubt. IT TAKES AWAY NEGATIVITY. IT MAKES POSITIVE. &gt;&gt; SO, if you're negative tonight, you know why you're negative? because you're speaking the language of unbelief. &gt;&gt; If you're negative about THIS AND NEGATIVE ABOUT THAT, YOU NEED TO SAY, "GOD, [screaming] CHANGE MY VOCABULARY. &gt;&gt; CHANGE MY HEART SO I CAN SPEAK SOMETHING DIFFERENT FROM WHAT I'M SPEAKING NOW." CUZ LET ME TELL YOU, YOUR NEGATIVITY IS GOING TO TAKE YOU INTO MORE NEGATIVITY. &gt;&gt; Negativity breeds MORE NEGATIVITY AND IT BREEDS MORE NEGATIVITY AND IT BREEDS MORE NEGATIVITY. BUT IF WE CAN FLIP IT AROUND TONIGHT AND YOU BEGIN TO SPEAK THE WORD OF GOD AND YOU BEGIN TO SPEAK THE POWER OF GOD AND YOU BEGIN TO SPEAK POSITIVE THINGS AND IT'S NOT JUST MADE making a motion AND SAYING SOMETHING. NO, IT'S SOMETHING COMING FROM YOUR HEART. &gt;&gt; I AM A SON. I AM FORGIVEN. I HAVE BEEN SET FREE. I NEVER DID BELONG TO THE DEVIL. &gt;&gt; GOD BROKE MY CHAINS. HE SET ME FREE. I DON'T HAVE TO BE BOUND BY ANXIETIES AND FEAR AND WORRIES OF ANY KIND. GOD HAS ALLOWED ME TO TEAR DOWN THE STRONGHOLDS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Got to listen to that the other day. Wonderful sermon. &gt;&gt; Probably need to listen to it every week, maybe every day till you get it. &gt;&gt; Devil wants to get in your mind all the time. Well, if you was worthy, you wouldn't have did that. You wouldn't have did that. You wouldn't have said that. You wouldn't. No. We're going to start speaking faith. &gt;&gt; We're going to speak faith over our family. &gt;&gt; Your children's heard enough negativity. Start speaking faith over them. &gt;&gt; The reason some children are out of church is because their parents spoke negativity over them. &gt;&gt; It's just the truth. Amen. And they spoke more negativity over them than the pastor can speak from the pull pit. Posit positivity from the pull pit. And let me tell you, a negative word will outweigh sometimes a thousand positive words. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; Well, I mean, you know, that's why the devil, he he has so much power sometimes because we allow him and his negativity to rule over our lives &gt;&gt; and we begin to find every we get this critical spirit. We find negative things to think about and dwell upon and all and it just keeps on as a big old ball of wax until you're so weighed down you can't even hardly lift your hands no more and away with that stuff. AWAY WITH NEGATIVITY ABOUT WHATEVER. I WANT TO START SPEAKING FAITH. I'LL SPEAK FAITH OVER MY LIFE. I'LL SPEAK FAITH OVER MY FAMILY. I'LL SPEAK FOR HEALING. I'LL SPEAK FOR JOY. I'LL SPEAK FOR HAPPINESS. I'LL SPEAK FOR PEACE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. [snorts] &gt;&gt; I tell you what happened the other day. I was just I was just there at my my daughter's house there in Sarasota and a little boy, my grandson hadn't been sleeping, been up most of the night crying, just wake up screaming. I walked in that room. I said, "Devil, let me tell you something. You ain't got no right to be in this room. &gt;&gt; You tormenting spirit want to torment this little kid in the night. I curse you in the name of Jesus." AND I SPEAK FAITH OVER THIS ROOM THAT IT'LL BE COVERED with the ANGELS OF GOD. AND THE SCRIPTURE SAYS HE can have peaceful sleep. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE'S BEEN SLEEPING SINCE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HAS BE TO CHANGE AND THINGS ARE HAPPENING. WHY? BECAUSE YOU BEGIN TO SPEAK FAITH. LISTEN, IF YOU'LL GO IN YOUR HOUSE AND START SPEAKING FAITH, YOU'LL START SEEING MIRACLES. YOU'LL START SEEING SIGNS AND WONDERS, YOU'LL [applause] START SEEING GOD DO THE IMPOSSIBLE. &gt;&gt; Faith knows no defeat. &gt;&gt; And it has to have faith has to has to have something to be based on. That's the word of God. Can't just have any kind of found. Well, if I touch a tree, I think I'll get well. No. pray to oppose. No, it's got to have a foundation. And how much more firm foundation could you place your faith on than the word of God? &gt;&gt; What more could you put your faith in when he said, "Heavens and earth will pass away, but my word will never pass away then in the fact that God's word is eternal and the very world that we're sitting on tile on top of tonight is nothing more than the word of God materialized. He spoke the word and said, "Let there be." And the word came into existence. All things that you see now are made WERE MADE BY FAITH SPOKEN BY THE WORD OF GOD. GOD SAID, "LET THERE BE." And he believed his own word. Well, after redemption and and being redeemed and the taste of God in OUR SOULS AND OUR HEARTS, HOW MUCH MORE OUGHT WE TO BASE OUR FAITH ON WHAT GOD GIVE US, THE WORD OF GOD, THE PROMISES. AND HE SENT JESUS DOWN TO DIE AND REDEEM EVERY ONE OF THEM promises for us. &gt;&gt; So we have a right to base our faith upon the word of God. &gt;&gt; So if the word says it, I believe it. &gt;&gt; Come on. If the word says it, I believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. If the word says it, I believe it. &gt;&gt; If a politician says it, I nine times out of 10, I ain't gonna BELIEVE IT. BUT IF GOD SAID IT, &gt;&gt; I CAN TAKE IT TO THE BANK. IT'S GOING TO CASH. IT'S GOING TO DO WHAT IT SAID IT'S GOING TO DO. IT'S GOING TO BRING TO FULFILLMENT WHAT IT SAID IT'S GOING TO BRING. [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; HIS WORD SAID THINGS ABOUT OUR CHILDREN SO I CAN SPEAK FAITH OF THE WORD OF GOD OVER MY CHILDREN. I MAY NOT SEE IT HAPPENING. I MAY NOT SEE MOUNTAIN CRUMBLE AND ALL, BUT I KNOW I SPOKE THE WORD. GOD'S GOING TO BRING IT TO PASS. SO, start speaking the language of faith. Now, I've used some of these before, but I'm going to use them again. Start speaking it. I'm saved. &gt;&gt; I belong to God. &gt;&gt; I'm [snorts] forgiven. I'm redeemed. I'm justified. I'm bought. I'm purchased. MY BODY IS HIS TEMPLE. I HAVE ETERNAL LIFE. THEREFORE, I have EX ACCESS TO GOD. I'M INSEPARABLE FROM CHRIST. I AM MORE THAN A CONQUEROR. THIS IS THE LANGUAGE OF FAITH. HE WILL RENEW MY STRENGTH. I HAVE VALUE IN GOD'S EYES. &gt;&gt; You may not have a lot of value in your own eyes, but in God's eyes, you're of much value. &gt;&gt; Well, brother Timothy, you don't know my life and what I've been through and how wretched I am. It doesn't matter if God saw you and thought you valuable. God God sent his son and he gave his only begotten son to die on your behalf. That means you're valuable. &gt;&gt; Except for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son. Listen, we want to put I heard brother Tim say it. I'm going to say it again. And we want to put it out there at the world, but we need to start putting it TO US. GOD DIED FOR ME. &gt;&gt; WHY DID HE DIE FOR ME? CUZ HE LOVED ME. &gt;&gt; WHY DOES HE LOVE ME? CUZ HE THINKS I'M SOMETHING THAT IS OF VALUE. &gt;&gt; NOW, the devil might not have thought you as much value because I know he don't. because he puts you in all kind of junk and tears your life apart and devalues it as much as he can possible because what he's trying to do is say look God ain't no value &gt;&gt; but the value is not this flesh &gt;&gt; it's that soul that's on the inside &gt;&gt; the devil takes the flesh and he tries to corrupt it and bring put [snorts] smoking and drugs and sexuality sins all kinds of stuff in there cause all kind of issues but God's wanting that soul because he knows if he can get that soul that set that that soul one day and night and night to such a powerful force it'll get the body and redeem it too. &gt;&gt; Right. But here he is so brother Timothy I just don't feel like I'm much worth much. Well you know [snorts] I've said I've used this example many times and it's something I really appreciate in the scripture that Jesus said that gives me a lot of confidence. He said, "Not even a sparrow &gt;&gt; can fall to the ground &gt;&gt; and the heavenly father not know about it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I might have to ask my wife, how many how many variations of sparrows is there? &gt;&gt; How many &gt;&gt; more than 40 in the United States? And they're not thought of as a very lovely bird. Mostly a pest. And he had picked this little, you know, Why didn't he say an eagle? What? I mean, big majestic bird. He picks this little sparrow. &gt;&gt; A nothing most people would take a pot shot at to run away from their house. And he picks this little bird. He said, "Not even one of these can fall to the ground, and I don't know about it." &gt;&gt; And he said, "How much more value are you?" He saw you when you fell down. He saw you when Satan took you down to the depths. He saw you when all of that stuff was going on in your life and you started speaking the language of unbelief and you started speaking those things and it tore you down to such a point to where you feel like you can't even look up no more. He sees you &gt;&gt; and he's drawing you and he's pulling you and he's calling you. But you have to say, God, we got to make got a choice. Am I going to stay in the same spot and go down and further in my own unbelief and and speak more of the language of doubts and fears and I can't do it. It ain't even possible or am I going to start speaking faith? Am I going to start saying yes, God loves me? [snorts] &gt;&gt; Yes, God cares for me. Why would I STILL BE HERE? WHY WOULD I STILL STILL BE ALIVE? WHY WOULD GOD AND WHY WOULD THIS HOW CAN I EVEN BE IN THIS SERVICE TONIGHT? YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE GOD LOVES YOU. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.

I WILL BE IN THE BODY OF CHRIST. HE WILL MEET MY NEEDS. I AM HIS. HE WILL KEEP ME and he is mine. &gt;&gt; He is my shepherd. I am [snorts] his sheep. He loads me daily with benefits. He brought me abundant life. He wants my fellowship. He will never overload me. He will keep me. He will bring me to the water and to have to have drink. I have I have living waters. I am his friend. I AM HIS BRANCH. I WILL BEAR HIS FRUIT. I AM IN CHRIST. I AM ONE SPIRIT WITH HIM. I AM COMPLETE IN HIM. HE IS MY HIGH PRIEST. HE IS THE AUTHOR AND THE FINISHER OF MY FAITH. &gt;&gt; SO HE WHO STARTED THE WORK WILL FINISH THE WORK. &gt;&gt; He is not ashamed of me. He is my brother. He is my father. He is my healer. He hears my prayers. He answers my prayers. THE LORD IS MY HELP. In the time of trouble, he will comfort me. His grace is sufficient. He will never leave me nor forsake me.

That Satan has come AND HE HAS NO PART WITH ME. &gt;&gt; I have been quickened FROM THE DEAD. I AM AN HEIR OF GOD. I HAVE AN INHERITANCE. NO WEAPON AGAINST ME WILL PROSPER. GOD WANTS ME TO PROSPER. GOD SAID, "TRIALS ARE FOR MY GOOD. I AM BLESSED, THEREFORE, I AM HAPPY. I AM BLAMELESS IN HIS SIGHT." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; How can you be blameless in his sight, brother Timothy? [snorts] We sin every day because I have a blameless lamb. &gt;&gt; I have a blood sacrificed for my sins. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I have a life that has come on the inside of me and transformed me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Therefore, I can forgive others. &gt;&gt; Yep. That's the language of faith. &gt;&gt; Unbelief says, "I can't let that go. It hurts too much. It's too much pain. If I let that go, that sets them free." No. It sets you free. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If they done wrong, they going to have to pay for it and give an account to it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's not setting anybody free by forgiving them. That's that's between them and God. But what forgiveness does is set us free. &gt;&gt; That's the language of faith. Amen. I will not avenge myself. God died for me. I have assurance he will keep me. If I fall, if I make a mistake, I will get up. &gt;&gt; HELLO. I WILL GET UP &gt;&gt; CUZ I AM CALLED. I'M CHOSEN AND FAITHFUL. I BELONG TO A PRIESTHOOD. I'M A WRITTEN EPISTLE. I CAN DO ALL THINGS THROUGH CHRIST WHO STRENGTHEN ME. I CAN ASK IN HIS NAME. AND IF I SUBMIT AND RESIST SATAN, HE WILL FLEE FROM ME. AND WHEN I OVERCOME, I WILL INHERIT ALL THINGS. GOD WILL CHANGE THIS OLD VILE BODY. HE WILL NEVER LEAVE ME. IN HIS PRESENCE, THERE'S FULLNESS of joy. &gt;&gt; He will preserve me. He will hold my right hand and help me. I am delivered from all my enemies. I have help in time of trouble. Therefore, I will be delivered out of my trouble. He will deliver me from sickness. He will deliver ME FROM AFFLICTION. I HAVE DIVINE GUIDANCE. THEREFORE, I HAVE DIVINE PROTECTION. HE MAKES ME DWELL IN SAFETY, AND I WILL LAY DOWN IN PEACE and sleep. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He giveth his beloved sleep. And when thou lies down, thy sleep shall be sweet. I am an attribute of God. God predestinated predestinated me to this age. No one can take my place. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You're bragging, Brother Timothy. No, I'm just saying what his word said. &gt;&gt; That's what his word says. &gt;&gt; No one can take my place. Amen. &gt;&gt; God predestinated me for this age. I came from the mind of God. His presence is with me. I have his presence when I feel nothing. &gt;&gt; Why? Because his word says I do. &gt;&gt; I am the object of his love. I BRING GOD PLEASURE. I BELONG TO HIS KINGDOM. I WILL NOT FEAR FAILURE. I'M PART OF A GLORIOUS CHURCH. I WILL THEREFORE I WON'T HOLD GRUDGES. I MUST AND WILL HAVE PERFECT LOVE. I WILL LOVE LIKE JESUS LOVED. I AM A VESSEL OF MERCY PREPARED UNTO GLORY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I am called a child of God. My angel is always with ME. AND IF GOD BE FOR ME, IF GOD BE FOR ME, WHO CAN BE AGAINST ME? HEAVEN IS MY HOPE. THE RAPTURE IS FOR ME. THE MARRIAGE SUPPER IS FOR ME. THE MILLENNIUM IS FOR ME. THE HOLY CITY IS IN MY FUTURE. &gt;&gt; I HAVE A PLACE PREPARED FOR ME. &gt;&gt; NOT PREPARED FOR SOMEBODY ELSE. PREPARED FOR ME. AND WHEN THERE IS NO MORE DEVIL. &gt;&gt; WHEN THERE IS NO MORE DEVIL, I STILL WILL BE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHEN THERE'S NO MORE CANCER, WHEN THERE'S NO MORE FEAR, WHEN THERE'S NO MORE UNBELIEF, WHEN THERE'S NO MORE DOUBTS, WHEN THERE'S NO MORE SIN, I STILL WILL BE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Start speaking the language of faith. Speak it over your life. Speak it over your children. &gt;&gt; Speak it over your spouse. Speak it over your home. Speak it over this church. Yes. &gt;&gt; Speak it. Don't allow the devil to clam you down with some doubt or some unbelief. We've been commissioned to tear the stronghold down. Go listen to it again. Tear them down. &gt;&gt; Tear them down. &gt;&gt; Tear them down. This is exactly what what uh Caleb and Joshua did when they first got into the promised land. They tore walls down. They said, "This thing ain't going to hold us. It ain't going to stand no more. We're going to do what he said and we're going to march around here and we're going TO LET FORTH A SHOUT." &gt;&gt; They had TO DO SOMETHING. LISTEN, GOD DIDN'T JUST PUT IT ALL ON THEIR MARCHING AND THEY'RE WALKING and and all of that. Well, I got to walk right. I GOT TO DO THAT. NO. GOD SAID, "AT ONE POINT, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING. &gt;&gt; AT ONE POINT, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SPEAK. AND WHEN IT'S A TIME APPOINTED, I WANT YOU TO SPEAK." AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND DON'T SPEAK YOUR FAULTS AND YOUR FAILURES AND YOUR MISTAKES. WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN HERE 40 YEARS AGO. WE SHOULD HAVE DONE THAT. NO, YOU START SPEAKING FAITH. THESE WALLS ARE COMING DOWN. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, that's what we got to do. WE GOT TO START SPEAKING TO THOSE WALLS THAT ARE HOLDING PRODALS. WE GOT TO START SPEAKING TO THOSE WALLS OF SICKNESS THAT'S HOLDING PEOPLE. LISTEN, THERE'S WALLS OF CANCER THAT HAS HELD PEOPLE FOR TOO LONG. THERE'S WALLS OF DOUBT AND FEAR AND ANXIETY THAT'S HELD PEOPLE TOO LONG. BUT THERE'S A PEOPLE THAT'S BEEN COMMISSIONED ON THIS EARTH TO speak &gt;&gt; and to speak the LANGUAGE OF FAITH AND WATCH AND SEE THOSE WALLS FALL DOWN. [applause] &gt;&gt; DO I HAVE A JOSHUA HERE TONIGHT? DO I HAVE A CALEB HERE TONIGHT? SAY, "YES, LORD. I'M GOING TO SPEAK YOUR WORD. I'M GOING TO SAY THE PROMISES OF GOD. I'M GOING TO TEAR DOWN STRONGHOLDS." &gt;&gt; Stand to her feet. &gt;&gt; I'm going to let it stay in my way. I GOT A VOICE AND MY VOICE IS NOT GOING TO GIVE HEED TO DOUBTS AND FEARS. IT'S GOING TO SPEAK THE word of God. &gt;&gt; Speak what he says &gt;&gt; and watch those walls come down. &gt;&gt; Watch it happen. Watch it move. Watch it change. [snorts] Watch it go forth. Too many times we shrunk back in our fear and our unbelief. Well, and we use this cop out. I'm just going to say it, but I just don't know if it's the Lord's will. The Lord's will is his word. &gt;&gt; It's always his will to heal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it's his word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's his will to save. It's his will to set free. It's his will to do things abundantly and more than we could ever think or speak or ask. It's his word. &gt;&gt; So therefore, we can ask and we'll take it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We believe it &gt;&gt; because he said it. Speak to the mountain. What's that? Giants come calling my name. Maybe you need to change your vocabulary tonight. Brother Timothy, I've been speaking the wrong things. speaking [music] my doubts, my fears, allowed it to drag me down to some terrible [music] places. But tonight, Lord, I want to speak your faith. I want to start speaking the promises of God. If you need prayer, I'll be [music] glad to pray for you about it. Won't you come to him? Will you say it? I'll go. Lord, I followed the wrong thing a long time, but I want to follow you now. I want to walk [music] with you. I want to be led by you, Lord. I want to give myself to you cuz I know there's much greater [music] things than the devil's ever done. Listen, the devil ain't done nothing with some of you but trashed your lives and tore you from one side to the other. Come to a God that can bring healing and deliverance and put things back [music] together where you thought it was impossible. Let God do a miracle, but it starts with surrender. [music] I will go. &gt;&gt; Let's bow hearts. Father, we need you tonight, Lord, to come and [music] speak to hearts and lives. Little thought you put on my heart, Lord, as I listened to brother Tim speak just the other day on pulling down of strongholds. Oh Jesus. Lord, may every [music] wall just begin to crumble at the voice of resurrection that's in the bride of Jesus Christ. Begin to speak, Lord, faith. Speak, Lord, the things of God. Believe, Lord. Let faith [music] arise in hearts. Maybe they haven't had faith in their life in a long time, but tonight, that little spark, you mean to tell me Jesus loves me? You mean to [music] tell me he cares for me? You mean to tell me after all my faults and failures and mistakes and things, [music] he still loves me? Yes. He ain't never changed his mind. He loved us when we were unlovable. Every one of us here tonight was in an unlovable state, an unlovable form. But God still loved us [music] and he gave himself for us. He changed us. Now all we want to do is just give our adoration and praises [music] back to you, Lord, and thanksgiving, Lord, that you didn't leave us where you found us. [music] You didn't leave us in that old muck of the mire of the world, but you drawed us out of there, Lord, like that lily out of a pond. pulled us up to the surface, Lord, [music] so we can bloom into the righteousness of God. Oh Jesus, we [music] love you, Father, with all of our hearts. We praise you in Jesus name. Hallelujah. Let's worship the Lord. Why [singing] would I worry? Giants come calling my name. [music and singing] My God [singing] is [music] so much bigger. The trials I face. I face. Oh, why would I hunger? &gt;&gt; Why would [singing] I hunger?
