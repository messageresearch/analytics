tomorrow uh for California to minister there the some of the Spanish group that was here over our meetings we're going out there to to minister to them and to strength strengthen the Believers in that area so just be praying for us and remembering the meetings but sure appreciate it um also um on February the 3 I believe it is uh me look at it just real quick no February the 2nd Sunday February the 2nd we'll have communion there will be a meal and right after that all of that is taken care of there'll be a little bit of a work day so just doing some OD odd and end things just want to do it while we're here so if you can remember that would sure appreciate it amen Isaiah 53 and verse one says who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of dry ground he has no he had no form no comeliness and when we shall see him there's no beauty that we should desire him he has despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not but surely Heath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities and the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed also John John chapter 19 and: 30 so when Jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost amen God bless you be seated it's a very wonderful passage of scripture that we read here today and uh something that we refer to quite a bit especially the the part of he was wounded for our transgression and bruis for our iniquities and the chastisement of our peace with was upon him and by his stripes we were heal are healed and you know we look at that a lot and we uh we we Ponder on it we we believe it we we repeat it we do all these things but uh I want you to understand that is a finished scripture that is fulfilled amen and I I'd like to speak to you on faith in the finished work you know is when Jesus would come to that moment and he would bow his head head as his Spirit would leave his body these last words were captured and wrote by John it is finished and you can read a lot of things on those three words but a lot of lot of lot of them say it's a word that means the debt is paid the price is is has been fulfilled uh but we know as a prophet of God would speak about it he said when when he bowed his head and he closed his eyes and that work was finished amen the back of Satan was broken amen it destroyed his works and his claim upon humanity and his claim upon the Earth and his claim upon your body and his claim that he had it took it all away and and I'm thankful to know that God cannot say anything without it being fulfilled amen when he speaks it is a finished work when he speaks it's just as good is it's already happened amen that gives us a basis to put our faith when God speaks a word it's finished well you know what about all the promises that he has given us and and things that are laying there in the word everything that he said is already a finished work amen therefore when we receive his word into our heart it's already done it's completed you know you know what what what if Jesus himself was in that in that flesh was standing here with this shirt on and these this outfit on here today you could come up and maybe say Jesus will you heal me and he would look at you and say you know my child I've already done that I was wounded for your transgressions and by my stripes you were healed it is a finished work you say well Jesus will you save me will will you save me that's not the question he's already done it the price has already prid you know Lord Jesus I I accept your atonement see you were saved back there you were healed back there but by faith now you you believe in what's already been done and what's already be been completed this is where Peter would come right along and he would take the scripture from you are healed to you were healed in First Peter 2 and4 24 he said by whose Stripes ye were healed in other words it is a finished work it is done is completed the price forever healing tonight has already been paid the price forever salvation tonight is already been paid the price that you for every promise of God that is written here that we need between here and glory is already paid for amen amen we can read about it I like to read it and amplify it as I added this just a few moments ago it's so beautiful 1 Peter 2 and verse 21 says for as a Believer you have been called for this purpose for Christ suffered for you leaving you an example that you may follow in his footsteps he committed no sin nor was deceit ever found in his mouth while being reviled and insulted he did not revile or insult and return while suffering he made no threats of Vengeance but kept trusting himself entrusting himself to him who judges fairly he personally carried your sin in his body on the cross willingly offering himself on it as an altar of sacrifice so that we might die to sin becoming immune from the penalty and power of sin and live for righteousness for by his wounds you who believe have already been healed Hallelujah you who believe are already been healed you were continually wandering like so many sheep but now you have come back to the shepherd and guardian of your soul so God's word is there it's already a finished work it's already done it's already the paid for amen but you have to believe it you have to put Faith in it you have to say this is not just some man's IDE ideology or some man's idea but this is the word of God spoken amen by the prophets of God Amen the anointing of God anointing men in their hour that they're lived in to speak words and these words amen came from the Throne of God you have to have the faith to believe that you have to have the faith to stand upon that when all hell is against you and it says you'll never get heal when the doctor says you're going to die when the doctor says there's no hope you have to have faith that the word is spoken and it's already done it doesn't matter what anybody says from hence forth it's already finished therefore I put my faith in a finished work amen amen not something that the doctor can say and we we appreciate doctors not something that medical science can come up with we appreciate what they've been able to do but God has already spoken about your sickness God has already spoken about your sin God has already dealt with it he's already paid for it it's already done amen you say well this is old hat well start believing it start believing that God has already done it and it's finished amen there is no man we know of that can heal us there's no man that we know of can save us because both healing and salvation is past tense the devil likes to put it off in the future somewhere that's the trick of the enemy he wants to put well one of these days I'm going to receive healing no I've already got it it's already paid for amen it's a truth when Jesus Christ died at Calvary he was wounded for our transgressions and by his stripes you were healed it is a finished work not the only thing that not that not the only thing that you have to do it to either receive your salvation or your healing is to accept what Christ has already done for you amen it's not something coming in the future come on Amen the Fulfillment of your body receiving it may be a future tense but the price is already paid amen the price for it is not coming it's already been here it's already done so therefore we can have confidence though I may not feel it it's not about how I feel it's about what the word said therefore I can stand upon the word and believe it though I may be feeling bad though make things may be all out of out of out of order in my life or in my body I can still say what the word says by his stripes I was healed amen it's already been paid for he said you know as we look at at God when a 100 billion Sons would look at God in eternity and his Holiness he said when a 100 billion Sons would look black to him when angels look dirty in his sight that's Jehovah but he became a little baby born in a manure Pile in a Manger that still Jehovah and that still Jehovah here tonight through his grace and through his blood he cleanses his church and he puts us in a position to receive all these blessings he's already paid for us come on somebody that's shouting grounds right there it ain't something I've done to to inherit or or to to to to be for it to be poured out on me God has placed me in in this position he has given me the rights he has given me the rights as his son to receive the blessings he's already paid for it's my inheritance is what God's already given me now you know he said here stands a whole line of people he said I I've never seen any of them as far as I know none now many of you have been in meetings and I I know what discernment is all of you do don't you what we know that I it's I've had it over and over and over that is a gift he said but that doesn't make the Holy Spirit in me any greater than anybody else well I wish we was in the days of brother brandom it ain't about to be in in the days of brother brandom it's about the days of God cuz he's a god of Miracles amen the god the day of God is still here so the day of Miracles are still here they said that's just a gift at work with the Holy Spirit no matter if it's in a little housewife or a little boy or a drunker that just got saved and filled with the Holy Ghost he's got the same holy spirit that any one of us got come on somebody so it's NE that's what the devil wants you to put he wants you to put it back 50 years ago or 10 years in the future no if youve got the Holy Ghost it's the same one that operated in William bradam it's the same one that overcomes sicknesses and diseases of every kind is the same one still in the body of Jesus Christ tonight it doesn't matter who you are where you come from but God gives gifts with the Holy Spirit to work it's a confirmation to lift up an enzy the preacher no to lift up Christ come on now that's what testimonies are about testimonies are now not about lifting up anybody but Christ you know people get the wrong idea about testimonies they think well you're just trying to make yourself somebody well if you're a true Christian you're not if you're a true called Holy Ghost preacher you're not trying to lift you up you're trying to tell others what Christ did come on somebody we we we have a whole a whole books of examples tapes of examples of what a prophet did he would get up and he would begin to testify of what God done in present tense cuz he's trying to bring it present tense not 50 years ago before him or 100 Years or or 2,000 years he's trying to let us know that God is here now no more than me or brother Tim brother Ron whoever gets up and testifies about what God has done maybe in our ministry maybe in somebody else's Ministry maybe in a housewife laying hands we heard about whatever amen we're here to testify why because we're telling you God's not past tense our future he is now and we're lifting him up out of history and telling you he's not just a god of William bradam he's your God he's not the God just 60 years ago or 2,000 years ago or billions of years ago he's the same one today he can heal today he can save today he can set the B of Sinner free today he's that kind of God we believe tonight that Jesus Christ is the Son of God how many believe that all right Born of the Virgin Mary suffered under pilate crucified rose on the third day ascended up into heaven and sits at the right hand of the Majesty of God tonight there ever living to make intercession Upon Our confession therefore he cannot intercede for us until we confess that he did the work it's a finished work but it's not finished necessarily when you see it's finished it's finished when he said it's finished therefore you have to confess it well brother Timothy I don't feel I don't it ain't got you're not confessing your feelings what a terrible this service this would be if we all just got here and confessed our feelings come on how bad we felt how bad we'd been how bad this was and how brother je forny would say we we'd be all in the wowy wowy wounds before we left this place if we just got if I just got up here and confessed my feelings how I felt CU I don't know if you know this or not but a preacher don't always feel like preaching he don't always feel like getting up in front of you and speaking the word of God it but it ain't on our feelings it's on the gift that God has placed in our life amen that God will somehow be beyond all the feelings beyond all the things will still shine through with his word and liberate his people that's why we push through our feelings amen but he's there to make make intercede upon your confession some some people get the idea that you're making a mockery of of the Gospel when you say you're healed and your body hasn't showed up yet hadn't met up yet you're not making a mockery you're not confessing your body you're conf in the word said I might make this statement that all healing and all salvation is what God has achieved for us through Christ it's already a finished work now bear that in mind as you prayed for and tell your friends that there's nothing that we can do to improve it nothing we can do to further it the only thing we can do is teach it that it's already been achieved amen it's already been done amen as long as the devil puts it out there like a carrot on a in front of a donkey and you're following this thing trying to get there you'll never get there but when you realize it's already been paid for and I have the right as a son or daughter to go cash in the check cuz there's enough deposit in the bank now some of y'all might might worry about sometimes when you write a check and and you've sent it out and you don't know if when it gets there or if everything's going to work out just right and you'll have money there when it happens how I ain't even going to ask how many's ever bounced a check I have amen but what but listen when you write a check amen in the that's been written by the bank of heaven and he said he signed his name at the bottom of it amen you can write it out and you don't have to worry about if there's enough funds in the bank cuz this bank has never been bankrupt it's never been in the red it's never been down where it couldn't fulfill the promises of God but when by faith you write it out and you send it there it will be fulfilled it might not come when you want it it might not come exactly the time that you expect but God is God and when God moves God moves God himself did that at Forest of Calvary he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we were healed it's past tense now it's up to you and I to appropriate the faith to accept what Christ has already done for us and the moment we accept it and confess that he's done it then he sitting at the right hand of God to make intercessions Upon Our confession the word confess there's the same word as profess profess it says but profess and confess same word to profess it was done to confess it comes from the same Greek word we know that we must confess that he's already done it he cannot do it until we confess it and then he's a high priest to make intercession that makes a faith in a finished work that Christ did for us at Calvary I I love what brother Murphy used that example on fire and forget beautiful amen it's time that we let we put the word of God in action and we Let it Loose we walk away and forget about it and just remember God's going to fulfill what he said he was going to do come on well brother Timothy I got to knock and keep on knocking yeah I I I believe in that it's Bible but I don't see in there anywhere that he says go get a preacher and he pray for you over and over and over and that's how you knock and keep on knocking no sir that's not how it is that's between you and God but you know the knocking he wants to hear is not the knocking of unbelief come on somebody he wants the knocking Lord I'm still here but I'm praising you anyhow I'm still here because I know you're going to send it you're going to do it you're going to fulfill I'm still knocking because I know God I'm going to just right now praise you as you already done it as if it's already done because it is come on somebody if I could just get you to realize your sons and your daughters are already back come on somebody amen we may be looking at it in a in our own eyes and we well I don't see him back what are you talking about but by God's he's already saw them and he put in his word you shall be there and your Offspring with you how could he see that without him already seeing them there come on somebody that ought to get somebody to say Glory he's already saw my son delivered he's already saw him amen before the foundation of the world he said I'm going to pay for that one and I'm going to pay for that one and I got enough blood for that one and I got enough blood for that one it doesn't matter how far the devil takes him I got enough [Applause] blood it's already done it's a finished work Divine Healing is not based on some emotion well I feel good doesn't necessarily mean you're healed just means you feel feel good but it's not well I feel bad doesn't do necessarily mean you're not healed come on somebody we ought to be enough students of the message to realize amen when a disease is cast out am was about 72 hours of decaying in your body and the body goes through things trying to get rid of it and the fever will get higher this will get worse and we say well I just wish we got something that last well if you just kept confessing your healing your body would have went through completely and done but as soon as those negative thoughts came into your mind and you begin to put them out your mouth your body went the other way come on Divine Healing is not based upon some emotion we want an emotion we want we want to feel good it got nothing to do with it is not based upon some laying on hands or some strange feeling or sensation it's based upon faith and a work that was done for you by Jesus at Calvary amen it's a finished product and every person how many persons we got here tonight all right let's just narrow it now how many sick persons do we have here tonight come on how many sick persons every person tonight that's sick or Afflicted and as far as God's concerned you're already healed amen as far as God's concerned you're already healed every sinner here is already saved for it was finished at Calvary the atonement was made healing and salvation this is a better atonement than the old one was because you could go in sin come up and offer an atonement and go right back in sin come back and over another and go back it never could do away with that desire but this atonement can not only take away the sin it'll take the very root cause of it away it'll take it all away the Bible said he was wounded for our transgression and with his stripes we were healed he said now someone tried to speak and say this fulfilled in Matthew 12 when he said he looked upon them and with the infirmities of us and he healed that it might be fulfilled with the spoken by Isaiah the prophet he bore our infirmities that was a year and 6 months before the atonement was ever made then if that be true where were many where were many trying to argue against Divine Healing then the atonement had more power before it became in force then it did after it came in force he said the church gave his the Christ gave his church whether it's called Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Catholic Pentecost whatever it is he gave them power to heal the sick he said now I'm asking for any man any student any Bible student or historian to produce to me one piece of scripture where Jesus has taking that power from the church and told them they didn't have it anymore come on somebody he never took power from the church but the problem is the church is afraid to exercise or to practice what Christ told them to do now to the critic a few years ago you can make remark but now we have tens and thousands of documented statements by doctors and Clinics and hospitals everywhere across the world and absolutely outstanding miracles of the Blind and the deaf and the dumb raising from the dead when doctors pronounce him dead documented statements the unbelievers mouth is hush you don't hear much of it anymore but it's come back oh it's come back that doesn't belong just to Pentecostal people that doesn't belong just to any certain group or certain man or evangelist come by like myself or Mr Roberts or some other man that's to every believer we got how many Believers we got here that's to every believer not only to the pastor but also to the leoty to any man or woman that's born of the spirit of God that's got faith in his healing has a right to pray for the sick just with the same results that any other man would have come on somebody said maybe tonight you'll accept salvation but that's already been paid for the debt has been cleared oh praise the Lord I'm thankful for his debt clearing abilities it took a lot of blood to clear a debt whole animal would die blood everywhere for one man but now one man blood paid the debt for whosoever will let him come one man's body dying upon the cross and he would scream these words it it is finished maybe the devil didn't realize what had happened when those three words come out but he figured it out really quick all of a sudden he realized when that Holy Spirit came back into Peter and the other disciples and those 120 that was in the upper room he could come and tempt them he would try to make Peter deny again no doubt he would try to make him curse again no doubt but something it happened all of a sudden he realized this power that was in one man well I couldn't make that one man sin I couldn't make that one man do it down and go the way of unbelievers and Sinners and do I now I have not just one man I got 120 that's what the Holy Ghost is it's not some wimy social power Social Gospel Power that's in you one day and gone the next and you can be up one day and down the next you can be a Sav one day and a sinner the next that's not the Holy Ghost oh no no no that is not the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is the same life that was in Jesus Christ and that same life when it comes inside of you it gives you overcoming power that does not mean that when something comes by you don't see it and all of a sudden a thought may come but it'll give you a power to take that thought subject to the word of God and turn that head and walk forward that exactly what the gospel would do the power of Christ is not some weak spirit that just comes and goes and has no ability but that power it raised you up from the dead you are dead in sins and trespasses and it gave you a Life to Live just as Jesus Christ lived yeah where you what do you mean you was in a he said the devil had put you in a pawn shop but Jesus came and he paid the price and he redeemed you and the only thing you have to do is walk out and claim your Liberty now I could have a a cashier's check laying here with somebody's name on it unless that somebody believed it was their name and got up and came up here and said yep that's my name yep I believe that's a real bank and they would take it to the bank and they would deposit it it took a lot of faith cuz there're there there scams out there there's fakes but if they truly believed it they would take it to the bank and they' get it certified yep there's funds there and yep it's got your name on it it's yours but what if they never came up to get it what if they never made a move well I just that's probably somebody else's name on that thing and if I get up there and has got my name probably some scam anyhow you that's how the devil's tried to train is real good you know in the age age that we live in there's scams everywhere and he wants to bring it right in into our beliefs that we can't believe in what God has already done but if somebody had the faith to believe and I got I'm talking about more than a million billion trillion bucks laying up here in a cashier check I'm talking about eternal life if you can truly believe that it's for real that worth having that is something worth trading what I got for then you'll make a move then there'll be something a deep that calleth to the Deep there'll be a response there'll be something moving towards that Amen to put it to cash it and to bring it to pass amen he said he walked in and he paid for the price and he he said but you have to do what you have to do is walk out and claim your Liberty you have a receip from God that the debt is paid you have a receed from God that the debt is paid Jesus said it in his last words it is finished every Redemptive blessing was paid for God's Great wrath on sin when it became sin for us the debt was settled so therefore Satan has no more power over you Satan has no more power he's only a bluff and if he can just Bluff you into it he you'll have to have it but legally he has no power at all every Power that he had was taken from him at Calvary that that's where the price was paid he's nothing but a bluff if you want to listen to his bluff well go ahead and listen but you don't have to come on somebody you don't have to listen to his doubt you don't have to listen to his fear you don't have to listen to his unbelief that's right come on you don't have to listen to all the things the devil tries to tell you he's always trying to tell you you're not a son you're just a scam you're just this you're not going to make it it's not for you the message that Ain real you just need to go get away from this place on you can listen to them if you want to but if you realize he ain't nothing but a bluff he's not got one bit of power to P make me pack one suit of clothes in a bag he ain't got one bit of power to make me do anything but because God has claimed this for his inheritance amen amen you don't have to you don't have to listen to the devil that says you got some kind of sickness that's incurable cuz that's a lie that with God there's no such a thing as an incurable disease we there's a young lady up there in in British Columbia y'all know her name she rewrote the books 0% what her name Beth ding wall 0% of ever getting over this cancer or whatever she had and God came down miraculously and healed her they had to go back and rewrite the books 0.001% or something like that amen what was it Satan tried to say Zer has ever survived zero will ever make it zero is going to happen but God says let me step into this equation God does impossible man amen let me step into an equation and I'll change the books come on you may be looking at your situation and the devil says it's zero chance of it ever happening it's zero chance of it ever coming to pass it's zero but God says let me step into the situation and I'll change your body just like I changed Sarah come on somebody I'll change it in a moment a twinkling of eye and it'll happen just like I said it would I mean we we're looking for brother Ron to be healed some people think that's an impossible task but with my God it ain't impossible he's the god God who changed an old 90y old woman changed her from the inside to the outside from the outside to the inside amen brought her right on back to being a young woman again to where a young king would look at and wanted to be a wife it's one of the Mysteries in the Bible it's actually the Mysteries the mystery of the raptures hidden right there there mystery of the body change is hidden right there the mystery of the body change is hidden right there in Enoch because he walked with God and was not the seventh from Adam and listen as we talk about scriptures there's many scriptures that that that have dual meanings and dual purposes some have been fully fulfilled as we're speaking here it's been fulfilled it's done the debts paid but there's some scriptures that that were speaking of Jesus but also speaking of his bride there was some scripture that was speaking of you there's there's all kinds of things that are taking place the Bible is not some dead book laying on a shelf somewhere it's a living Bible still yet today there's still Sarah there's still Abraham's there's still Daniels there's still David's thank God there's still Davids a David that'll walk down the face of a giant and say you're today your head's coming off I'm not going to listen to you challenge the armies of the Living God but I know the finished work has already taking place Place therefore I'm going to stand amen I'm going to call you into the valley and I'm going to take your head off thank God there's still David and Daniel's that'll pray don't matter if they're surrounded by lines they'll still pray until God sends Angels down and God begins to move and the whole whole system that he was in amen God wants still has those kind of people but your healing and salvation is already done it's fulfilled it's finished you got to say Lord I want to appropriate the faith to believe it's already done and to put my check in he said now if something in the word can make you realize you're free by Grace or something realize the word make you understand or somebody of God that's includ that it's including you it includes all of us then we just accept it on the basis and we're free you don't have to feel any different you don't have to feel anything at all it's not based upon that Jesus never did say do you feel it he said Do you believe it it's Faith that's our fa that's our that's what it takes faith is an arm a mighty arm that holds the two edged sword of God Amen that sharp two-edged sword of his word it'll cut every Promise free if that arm of faith is able to yield that sword some people has a very weak muscle trouble and they they can maybe only cut a little scratch enough to join a church enough to sit on a Pew and occupy a spot amen but if they can just get an arm of Faith amen it'll cut to the baptism of the Holy Ghost it'll cut to every promises free Divine Healing does not lay in a man Divine he heing does not lay in William brandham Divine Healing does not lay in any man it is a finished work your faith in a finished work a gift of healing is merely a gift of faith for healing did you hear that a gift of healing is merely a gift of faith for healing so a gift of healing does not have to be even it does not even have to even be a pastor it can be a lay member yes the Ley can have this same thing hello somebody what kind of people ought we to be we ought to be people that believes that God's already paid for this so when we ask it's going to be done we pray for the sick that's part of the Gospel is our Lord Jes Jesus told us that we should go in the all World preach the gospel pray for the sick we have these nights on our along our campaigns we pray for the sick we don't claim to be a Healer we just claim that we pray for the sick I like how he puts that very simple we believe that all that God can do for you has already been purchased for you at Calvary when he died at Calvary finished the Plan of Salvation the Redemption for the soul and body and now we draw the earnest of our Salvation which is the Holy Spirit and then also we have the earnest of our resurrection that is that when our bodies are sick God is our healer and I believe that upon a finished work that was completed us for us at Calvary some 1900 years ago when Christ died for us to redeem us from all these things I do not believe that there's anyone that can forgive sins unless it's a sin maybe against them if you sin against me then I ask me for forgiveness I could do that would do that but I believe that sins that would be committed against God that God is the only one that can forgive those sins I believe that Divine Healing is based upon own faith we believe that he was wounded for our transgression and with his stripes we were healed you notice the Peter the Apostle Peter places it in past tense it's past tense just like salvation when Jesus died at Calvary he saved the whole world every human being ever be would be on the earth a sin question could be settled once and for all when Jesus died but you'll never be a beneficiary of that policy unless you accept it we got a if I understand right there's a website dedicated to unclaimed benefits money maybe taxes that never got to where whatever refunds stuff people just let them sit there sometimes they don't know about it sometimes they're too lazy to check into it sometimes they just ain't worried about it but I guarantee you I guarantee you if I told any of y'all I ain't going to say one of y'all any of y'all that I saw your name on that website and beside your name it said unclaimed benefits $110,000 some of you be wanting to check it right now on your phone I went on this website you ain't going to believe this I saw so and so's name on it and it said unclaimed benefits $10,000 govern website I don't I I don't think you'd wait probably till tomorrow or maybe next week or forget about it no it's $10,000 thank you $1,000 we'd go $100 we go check you know get under 100 maybe you know I don't know 100 barely buy you a tank of gas but hey 50 bucks go check but I'm out here telling you about some dumb website that even when you check into it it may or may not be true but what I am here telling you that there is a Bank Of Heaven and I was reading in the word about some of y'all and I saw some of your names written in there and I saw it written there that by his stripes Tim PR is Hill I saw written there that by his stripes Ruth PR is he amen I whatever you want to do you see your name there tonight come on you don't even have to have a preacher tell you your names there if you can have faith in what's written and you can read it and say God I see my myself in the mirror of your word I see your word being revealed in my life then if you would realize there's benefits in here I bet you would check in more than once a week when you realize what's really inside of there there it's not just some man's ideas oh they made it all a bunch of man's ideas to the point they got people in the pull pit don't belong in the pull pit well I know brother Timothy we got these in the pull pit and that woman got up in front of trump and she did I ain't even who I'm talking about I'm talking about in our ranks people that's not feel with the Holy Ghost never had an experience with God and trying to by some intellectual ability reveal something that's to be revealed spiritually and today there's some of them shipwrecks and writing books against it when they used to stand behind it and tell you how you ought to live probably was the strictest of the strict nothing but Pharisees and Sadducees that invaded message pulpits never received the spirit of Christ whed walls snakes in the grass come on somebody and now it's manifesting time we're realizing there's a lot of wolves and sheep clothing a lot of Snakes in the Grass it gets up behind a bunch of snake oil salesman It Gets behind a pull pit wants to sell you some psychology or some intellectual ability I'm not here to sell you none of that I'm here to tell you I not I got nothing for sale it's already been paid for you don't have to buy it you don't have to work for it all you got to do is believe and say it's mine because God says it's mine someone said I was healed I was saved last week brother Brandon I beg you pardon no you wasn't well I saved 10 Years nope you was saved 1900 years ago when Christ settled the sin question how can you ever preach salvation for the soul without preaching Divine Healing because the sickness is the attributes of sin before we had sin we had no sickness sickness came because of sin because not something you done but something that you inherited hello I like that not something you done that's where the devil wants to take you all the time when you get sick what have you done ain't nothing youve done it's what you inherited today in the private interviews is a place where you used to see the Holy Spirit where men and women sitting here tonight that even the Holy Spirit goes Plumb back three generations brought down the people and told them their name what they did and all about it why this thing was in that person took it off of him healed and right standing in the room tell them the grandmother grandfather who they were where they came from what they did third generation they couldn't even think next Generation brought it out the next generation of course they knew he knows all things now that did not heal the person hello now that did not heal the person but it raised them to a place that they could have have faith to be healed that's the reason we do we we baptize water won't save you it's obeying the Act take communion won't save you but it's following the word beating the altar won't heal you beating the altar won't save you but you can beat the altar till you just went out of breath and died right there you'd still be unsaved as you was when you walked up every minister in here could lay hands on every sick person here and pray for them until tomorrow night and there'll never be one thing happened until you accept he's already done it so therefore it doesn't lay in ministers or in one person or in one another it lays in our own individual faith in a finished work that Christ did for us to Calvary he now is a high priest Hebrews 3 sitting at the right end of God a Almighty in heaven making intercession Upon Our confession to confess and profess same thing you profess that you believe he was wounded for you not just somebody else for you and by his stripes you were healed he's a high priest that can make intercession Upon Our confession but he can't do it until we accept it and confess it and we could go down the Altar and pray till we laid on our face and died but until we believe it until we accept his pardoning grace we're still lost no matter how loud you scream or how long you stay or how much we could do without food until but until our hearts the revelation of God's given us that Jesus Christ died for my sin and he paid my debt and now I'm free now I'm Healed I can walk away from here delivered many people say well I like to feel like like I'm Healed he didn't say do you feel it do you believe it feeling has nothing to do with it he said he he ascended I don't I got it here somewhere but for sake of time he ascended on high and he said he sat down by the right hand of him he said no man sits down until the work is finished when when Samuel went in to find to anoint a king in Jesse's house Jesse brought all of his sons and not one of them was accepted and he said well Lord told me to come here do you not have another son he said well yeah I got this got this little guy out there in the desert he's watching some sheep and well go get him and we not sit down until he comes amen because his work was not finished but he has ascended and sat down he is signifying it is finished when the angel rolled away the stone he sat down upon the stone signifying it is finished it is done it is over with amen sin is over with diseases are over with their power over man is finished he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquity well I wish Christ was here tonight Christ would heal me he would tell you I've already done it save me Lord Jesus I've already done it he died at Calvary every sin that was ever committed was forgiven right there on the basis of the shed blood but it'll never do you no good to accept it it's got to be your personal property and that's your personal faith in a finished work that Christ has already done it for you salvation is not doing a lot of good works no Grace is what brings us to God gra God Saves Us by Grace people get this idea well I'm not going to go to church till I get my life right well you're not going to get your life right until you go to church it's an excuse It's a carrot out on a stick that Satan wants to put out there in front of people and they go from one bar room to another Ballroom waiting to get their life right it's not going to happen you get your life right by coming and hearing the word of God and by the washing of the water of the word things begin to fall off your life and chains begin to fall off situations begin to move things begin to change all of a sudden you begin to get a glimpse of Freedom you'll never get a glimpse of Freedom out there in the Devil's Playground but in this place here when the anointing of God can come upon you and the and the mighty angels can surround you and it can pull that Black Sheath that's over you off your eyes then you can get a glimpse of Freedom then you can realize hey I wasn't born for this I was born for another place salvation isn't doing a lot of good works Grace brings us to God God Saves Us by Grace no man ever sought God at any time that's right you say well why I sought God all night no you didn't ever God sought you he was chasing after a rebel oh God it was God seeking after you it was God pulling you well I think I'll just go to church well you're not doing that on on your own it's the pulling power I will draw all men n unto me why I sought God all night you never God sought you the man's very nature in the Garden of Eden proved it instead of Abra Adam running up and down the garden saying oh Father where are th I've seeing I've seing it was God hunting Adam saying Adam Where Art Thou he said so let's turn the picture around John 6:44 here this will settle it for you if there's a question in your mind Jesus said no man can come to me except my father draw him first that settles it he if he said it all right we're not on that subject we're just background but get the fear away from you don't be scared that God's not going to answer your prayer come on somebody don't be scared that God's not going to answer your prayer go God always answers prayer the work's already finished he's obligated he must do it he's got to keep his word or he's not God it is a finished work I'm here tonight to declare every disease in this building is finished every sin in this building is finished everything the devil has tried to put on you it's finished not because I I say it's finished it's finished because he said it and if he said it I believe it and if he said it it's already done we bring this down you remember the building or the bridge that that they wanted to build they had to find the right architect and he would base his reputation upon it and he finished the job he tested at every Avenue he could test every every boat every structure everything that way if fire Struck it or weather Struck it or salt Struck it how much it would expand how much it would he tested everything and he said that's the way God did when he made this salvation bridge for us to cross from Earth to Glory he tested everything every servant that comes to him must be time tested and proven every son that cometh to God must be first tried of God God tested child trained and brought into Christ must be first tried the prophets first tried if a prophet speaks something that he that what he says not come to pass don't hear him it was a Tim tested thing and if that man building that bridge some time tested he time tested everything every boat every PL every piece of Steel everything he was trying to make sure nobody would lose their life Crossing it and he said you know he dug those holes so deep he did everything just exactly perfect but it came to the point that it's finished and he said this man had enough confidence in that testing that he didn't send somebody else across it first he didn't check you know a couple of slums on the couple uh you know guys on the street or Beggars on the street I want y'all come on I got a little job you give you 10 bucks go across that bridge no no he lined it all up kind of brings a funny thing that I was just watching in in history when when Carnegie the man who come come along with the steel industry he wanted to connect the West with the East and he built the first Bridge across the Mississippi River and it had to be built in such a way that the boats could still go up and down it and it was a blockade for a long time you can go across on a raft but to get the the amount of cargo things that was needed it wasn't possible so he he was he found out how to make steel but everything that time was built out of iron and he was everything was believed in iron iron this iron that but here he come moving making carbon and iron and making steel and here he built this bridge out of steel spent billions of dollars but now it's time to test it you know what you know what he got to test that bridge you can tell he wasn't confident in his work there was a fable or a thought on that day that elephant would not cross anything that was not stable and so he gets this Big C basically a big circus act and he gets this elephant and he takes that elephant first across that bridge and what cause an elephant across that bridge everybody else would a lot of confidence in a dumb animal but here this man he didn't try to Elephant he didn't try he crossed it himself and he said see God did that between the old old New Testament he spanned his Plan of Salvation he hosted up an inside on go gol's Hill no other than the Son of God to join man and God it's time tested he tested it through Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph David on down until the perfect seed come that would stand in the middle and hold Center on either hand on one end and God on the other and bridged the way every word that he spoke every word that was placed in the Bible was time tested by the Holy Ghost therefore I believe in every Timber every precept of God Is Right everything that's written in the Bible I'm willing to lay my life down on it I may not have enough faith enough to make every promise come true but it'll never stand but I'll never stand in someone else's way who has Faith to make it come to pass if I can't walk where he didn't walk one of these days and went home without dying I won't stand some in somebody else's way that can walk in that way any walk why it's time tested I believe that every word of God is pure and unadulterated for God is putting his timber in and right because he is positive that his reputation of a savior will not be spoiled he will come to pass he will bring all of his children across that line that day come together both ends was joined because the man had done all he could do with the reputation he had he had planned it perfectly till both ends come together perfect as it could be how the people screamed and shouted when they knew the job was done and how the people today who's lost and undone without Christ how we can rejoice and praise God that the expansion was met right when God sent Jesus to the Earth and he died at Calvary to bridge the way for sinful men and women to meet their redeemer and their maker and none other than this bridge none other is this bridge but God Almighty himself his word is in him he laid his own life down he walked over him into glory and we so we could walk over him to Glory one of the bridge was nothing else but Emanuel God With Us on the other hand of the bridge is a resurrected Lord Jesus Christ who stands in the power and glory of the Father the connection is made right every Old Testament prophecy is poting straight to Calvary every new testament Prophet points back to it and says it's finished why would we be here in the last days trying to point off to something else it wouldn't be right if a man raised up and said I got power to heal or all I got oil or I got blood that wouldn't be right God has already made the way he's already made the path to your healing he's already made the path to your salvation he's already built the way for your child to come home he's already bridged the Gap he's already done it he's going to fulfill every word he's going to fulfill every word today he's still fulfilling the word spoken of Abraham and Sarah and David and Daniel three Hebrew children the New Testament showing you it'll hold this word is true you can lay your life down on it you can tie your soul to it it will come to pass amen let's bow our hearts what about you do you believe in a finished work do you believe that it is done we sing it it's already done it's already done meanwhile
