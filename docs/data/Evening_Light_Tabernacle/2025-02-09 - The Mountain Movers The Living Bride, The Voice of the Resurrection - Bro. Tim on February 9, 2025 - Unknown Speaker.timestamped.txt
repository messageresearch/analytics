[56:09] take a hold of it I ask that you would
[56:12] anoint now the word as we read it and we
[56:15] experience it today may you make the
[56:18] word real to us we pray in Jesus name
[56:22] amen and amen God bless you
[56:26] it's good to be in the house of the Lord
[56:28] today and we're so thankful to be
[56:30] serving him together and happy that you
[56:33] are here and we welcome you today in the
[56:36] wonderful name of the Lord Jesus we're
[56:38] going to be speaking on today on the The
[56:41] Living bride the voice of the
[56:43] resurrection and um we're just going to
[56:46] go through some scriptures some
[56:48] different quotations today I'm going to
[56:50] do something a little different than
[56:52] normal because I'm going to appeal to
[56:55] the authority of a prophet of the
[56:58] prophet of God for this age which we
[57:00] believe of course to be brother brandham
[57:03] seventh Church age messenger and we're
[57:06] here in the last day at in the Le leodan
[57:09] Church age and um we realize that we
[57:12] have a message in this day and that
[57:15] message is to prepare us for the very
[57:18] coming of the Lord Jesus to make a bride
[57:20] ready amen prepared to meet the
[57:24] bridegroom that's what we want to do so
[57:27] as we look into the word today we're
[57:29] going to be speaking of course on our
[57:31] our theme on the mountain movers as we
[57:34] have been through Zachariah using this
[57:37] as our as our overall theme as we go
[57:40] forward it says who art thou oh great
[57:43] Mountain Thou shalt become a plane and
[57:46] The Headstone shall be brought forth
[57:48] with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto
[57:52] it and we know there is um headstone of
[57:55] course are the capping off of mystery
[57:58] truths that had to be revealed in this
[58:00] last day we find that in the Book of
[58:02] Revelation a book that was reserved for
[58:05] the end time people and then then of
[58:08] course we know there's a capping off of
[58:09] the in of the of the individual you with
[58:13] your own personal experience with God
[58:15] where you're filled with the Holy Ghost
[58:17] sealed till the day of redemption
[58:19] uniting you and God together and and he
[58:22] is the Capstone of every every life and
[58:26] so again we we look of course and we're
[58:29] looking at the the real Capstone coming
[58:32] which is the coming of our Lord Jesus
[58:35] where he will come in a Corporal body in
[58:37] a physical form we will meet him in the
[58:39] air that's what Believers believe amen
[58:43] and so we we know that will cap it all
[58:46] but to match that must be a bride who
[58:49] hath made herself ready and we have to
[58:52] be a people that meet the coming
[58:54] bridegroom so so as we look into the
[58:57] scripture we're going to look into
[58:59] Revelation chap 10 and we're going to
[59:02] read from the 10th verse we have been
[59:04] going over this scripture and there's
[59:06] many many um things that we could bring
[59:10] out of the symbology of this chapter it
[59:14] is something that is revent to our day
[59:16] to our time and and and of course um we
[59:20] uh we know that in Revelation 10:1 a
[59:23] mighty anointing comes down which is
[59:25] Christ it's not the physical or Corporal
[59:27] coming but it is the coming of Christ in
[59:31] in the word form as it comes now and it
[59:34] and it speaks out with crying he cries
[59:37] with a loud voice s this answers back to
[59:40] 1 Thessalonians 4 he shouts as U the
[59:44] bridegroom descends so he sends a
[59:47] message to turn our hearts back to the
[59:49] original Faith again the very gospel
[59:53] that Paul preached not a new gospel but
[59:55] the same gospel and so then it concludes
[59:58] in the chapter of where that John now
[1:00:02] John is symbolizing the entire bride and
[1:00:06] so one person is being used in the
[1:00:09] vision in this book of symbols to
[1:00:12] symbolize the entire body of Christ and
[1:00:15] John is told to take the book from the
[1:00:19] hand of the Angel the book is now open
[1:00:22] it was once sealed but now it is open
[1:00:25] and here in the this verse we will see
[1:00:28] that John representing us took the
[1:00:31] little book out of the Angel's hand and
[1:00:34] ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet
[1:00:37] as honey and as soon as I had eaten it
[1:00:41] my belly was bitter and he said unto me
[1:00:43] thou must prophesy again before many
[1:00:47] people's Nations tongues and people
[1:00:51] therefore the bride must be the voice of
[1:00:54] God in the last day
[1:00:56] so then we go to the the next scripture
[1:00:59] we want to refer to is 1 Thessalonians
[1:01:01] 4:15 as far this we say unto you by the
[1:01:05] word of the Lord that we which are alive
[1:01:08] and remain until the coming of the Lord
[1:01:11] shall not prevent them which are asleep
[1:01:14] for the Lord himself shall descend from
[1:01:16] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[1:01:18] the Archangel and with the Trump of God
[1:01:20] and the dead in Christ shall rise first
[1:01:22] now stop a minute this is not a moment
[1:01:25] in a twinkling the ey event this is a
[1:01:27] process of the end time where the Lord
[1:01:31] himself just like in the days of Moses
[1:01:35] the Lord himself came down in a pillar
[1:01:39] of fire to a prophet and he brought him
[1:01:42] a message that sent him to deliver the
[1:01:45] people out of Egypt for The Exodus we
[1:01:49] are in another Exodus so we are seeing
[1:01:53] that's that in the Bible this story in
[1:01:55] the Bible is more than a story but it's
[1:01:57] a prophecy of the last day so here the
[1:02:01] Lord himself shall descend from heaven
[1:02:04] with a shout with the voice of the
[1:02:06] Archangel with the Trump of God three
[1:02:08] things he does as he descends and the
[1:02:12] dead in Christ shall rise first then we
[1:02:15] which are alive and remain shall be
[1:02:17] caught up together with them in the
[1:02:19] clouds to meet the Lord in the air and
[1:02:22] so shall we ever be with the Lord God
[1:02:25] bless you can be
[1:02:27] seeded now the final prophecy will be
[1:02:31] the bride's voice but do you know she
[1:02:34] will be the voice of the Archangel for
[1:02:38] the Archangel is Christ and that voice
[1:02:41] of God will be in her because she is his
[1:02:45] bride she is his representation on the
[1:02:48] earth now God's church has always spoke
[1:02:52] for God they've always been his voice on
[1:02:55] Earth he lives and he speaks today
[1:02:58] through his bride on the earth and I
[1:03:00] want you to realize that even you as an
[1:03:03] individual you are the voice of God in
[1:03:06] your generation we is the church Body of
[1:03:10] Christ the bride is the voice of God God
[1:03:13] would use a prophet to speak his voice
[1:03:15] through um he would use the the voice of
[1:03:19] a man this is the way that God has
[1:03:21] always done it down to the ages so if we
[1:03:25] would look here we're going to just
[1:03:27] refer to now some quotations from the
[1:03:30] from Brother Bram where he says the
[1:03:32] voice of the throne notice in the throne
[1:03:34] Before the Throne was seven stars the
[1:03:38] voice of the Stars voices now you see
[1:03:40] there's more in Revelation 4:5 we find
[1:03:44] out and the out of the throne proceeded
[1:03:46] lightning and Thunders and voices not
[1:03:49] one voice but voices understand voices
[1:03:53] plural what it was it
[1:03:56] God speaking to his church reflecting
[1:03:59] himself through the seven spirits when
[1:04:02] the true anointed of God speaks it is
[1:04:05] the voice of God and and to reject it is
[1:04:10] to remove the Candlestick or in other
[1:04:13] words the light will leave you if you
[1:04:15] reject the voice of God and see the
[1:04:18] voices the voices of the seven Church
[1:04:20] ages over here in the corner there the
[1:04:22] voices speaking with thunder and
[1:04:25] lightning now notice it's the voice of
[1:04:28] God and the voice of God we know can be
[1:04:32] heard in many many different ways the
[1:04:35] voice of God can be heard today in
[1:04:38] dreams it can be heard in Visions it can
[1:04:41] be heard in nature you can actually be
[1:04:44] out in nature and hear the voice of God
[1:04:47] inspiration of the Spirit come to you
[1:04:50] and through the preaching of the word
[1:04:51] and through the testimony of the Saints
[1:04:54] the voice of God can be heard now God
[1:04:57] could have chose the stars or the moon
[1:05:00] to to the wind or nature to preach the
[1:05:03] gospel but God chose men to preach the
[1:05:07] gospel and that's as brother bradam told
[1:05:10] us that's where the voice of God will
[1:05:13] come from so God's voice will come
[1:05:15] through men not just preachers but men
[1:05:19] men who do and men and women who preach
[1:05:23] the gospel by the the the life that they
[1:05:27] live so now as you're seeing this um he
[1:05:30] says nowadays they there're so well we
[1:05:34] don't believe in saying Hell in the
[1:05:36] Pulpit oh
[1:05:38] mercy we need men of God men who won't
[1:05:41] hold back now everybody can't be a
[1:05:44] preacher but you got a voice and if you
[1:05:47] can't preach the people of seron if
[1:05:50] you're a preacher you're called to the
[1:05:52] pulpit to preach if not you're still a
[1:05:54] preacher but live the people a sermon
[1:05:59] let your sermon be lived it is the voice
[1:06:02] of God that'll bring a reproach to them
[1:06:05] who reject it they say no one can put a
[1:06:09] finger on their on his or her life their
[1:06:11] sweet living if there was ever a man of
[1:06:14] God if that man or that woman see live
[1:06:17] your sermons don't try to preach them if
[1:06:20] you're not called to be a preacher you
[1:06:22] get all mixed up anyhow and messed up
[1:06:24] and you'll get people tangled up and you
[1:06:27] won't know well you'll ruin them and
[1:06:29] ruin yourself just live your sermon so
[1:06:33] every one of us are called to preach a
[1:06:36] sermon amen and some of it is in the
[1:06:39] life we live when our sisters go out on
[1:06:42] the uh on on the town and they go into
[1:06:45] uh the the stores they are they're a
[1:06:48] testimony of what a Holiness should look
[1:06:52] like how a holy God is change the life
[1:06:56] when you see men who have quit their
[1:06:58] smoking they're drinking they're lying
[1:07:00] they're cussing they are a testimony to
[1:07:03] this world they are a sermon that is
[1:07:06] preached and you don't even have to use
[1:07:08] words to do it your very life will
[1:07:12] exemplify Christ amen so it will be a
[1:07:15] voice of God now notice the preacher is
[1:07:18] called to preaches and to live it too if
[1:07:22] you if you can't he said if you can't
[1:07:25] live live it then you should stop
[1:07:27] preaching it but you're supposed to live
[1:07:29] your sermons all right here was voices
[1:07:32] Oh how we need in Jeffersonville
[1:07:35] thousands of live voices the Thunder of
[1:07:39] God thundering out in sweetness and
[1:07:41] Holiness and Purity and undefiled lives
[1:07:44] walking around in the world Earth today
[1:07:47] without a blemish yes sir real
[1:07:49] Christians that's Thunder against the
[1:07:52] enemy the devil don't care how loud you
[1:07:55] can holler the devil don't care how much
[1:07:57] you can jump or how much you can do this
[1:07:59] or shout but What Hurts The Devil is to
[1:08:03] see that Sanctified holy life
[1:08:07] consecrated to God say anything to him
[1:08:09] call him anything just as sweetest can
[1:08:11] be and move right on oh my that throws
[1:08:14] him away that's the Thunder that shakes
[1:08:16] the devil said you know he says just
[1:08:19] like well he said if you could just
[1:08:22] preach like a Billy Graham or an or
[1:08:24] Roberts or somebody a great influential
[1:08:27] speaker he'd be oh no sometimes the
[1:08:28] devil just laughs at that he don't pay
[1:08:31] no more attention to that than nothing
[1:08:33] you get all the theology you wanted to
[1:08:35] and all the Seminary training and the
[1:08:37] devil just sits back and laugh at it but
[1:08:40] when he sees that life amen so you see
[1:08:46] when he sees that life that's what we
[1:08:48] want to see is is that life that is
[1:08:51] within us he says you know like and and
[1:08:54] so he goes go on and talks about this
[1:08:56] and he says you know look like look at
[1:08:58] them Devils down there you know the
[1:09:01] maniac and so on and and whatever you
[1:09:03] know when they came to him and and
[1:09:05] forced and and and and came against him
[1:09:08] with the disciples they couldn't cast
[1:09:10] him out but when they met that life when
[1:09:13] they saw him see him come quietly uhhuh
[1:09:16] he didn't have to say nothing the devil
[1:09:18] was already scared right then amen he
[1:09:21] know he had to leave because there come
[1:09:24] a life not only a sermon but a life and
[1:09:28] it said come out of him oh my that done
[1:09:30] it quite he knew what he was talking
[1:09:33] about he knew what he was doing you see
[1:09:36] that's what God wants to see today is a
[1:09:39] life and that's the only thing that
[1:09:41] devil will recognize you can use any
[1:09:43] kind of words you want to and fancy
[1:09:45] prayers and commands and everything but
[1:09:48] he I cannot stand against that life
[1:09:51] that's right we want our life sermon to
[1:09:55] be what preaches out of our Lives sir
[1:09:58] whether we ever stand before behind the
[1:10:00] pull pit we are preachers of the Gospel
[1:10:03] amen we must testify of Jesus Christ now
[1:10:08] as we look at Revelation 17 I want to
[1:10:10] just prefos this by saying sadly not
[1:10:14] only not not all that call themselves
[1:10:16] Christians speak for
[1:10:20] God Amen some are speaking for the
[1:10:23] church some are speaking far some
[1:10:25] theological
[1:10:27] idea amen but not all are speaking for
[1:10:30] God so look here for a moment because
[1:10:34] remember the church that Paul hoped to
[1:10:38] present as a Chase virgin is seen over
[1:10:42] here in the Book of
[1:10:44] Revelation a as a lewd woman with
[1:10:48] daughters now we're going to look at
[1:10:50] this together and and verse one says and
[1:10:53] there came one of the Seven Angels which
[1:10:55] had the seven vials and talk with me
[1:10:57] saying unto me come hither I will show
[1:11:00] Thee the Judgment of the great horde
[1:11:03] that sth upon many Waters so now he sees
[1:11:07] this now why a how can a
[1:11:10] church be a how can that happen by
[1:11:15] receiving seed are the words of a man
[1:11:19] instead of the seed word of Christ who
[1:11:22] is her husband amen you see the word is
[1:11:26] to have pre preeminence in God's
[1:11:28] people amen so again when when a woman
[1:11:33] takes in the seed of another man she
[1:11:36] prod she commits the act of adultery or
[1:11:39] harlotry this is exactly why God will
[1:11:43] call the church a the one that
[1:11:46] Paul said I fear by by any means like
[1:11:49] the serpent begal Eve through his
[1:11:52] subtlety so should your be Minds be
[1:11:54] corrupted Ed from the Simplicity that is
[1:11:57] in Christ he said I wanted to present
[1:12:00] you as a Chase virgin but I this is my
[1:12:03] fear the Serpent's going to get in there
[1:12:06] and he's going to begal you as he begal
[1:12:08] e now look the verse the the next verse
[1:12:11] says with whom the kings of the Earth
[1:12:14] have committed fornication that's
[1:12:16] adulteries or pernah and the inhabitants
[1:12:19] of the Earth have been made drunk with
[1:12:21] the wine of her fornication so he
[1:12:24] carried me away in the spirit Into the
[1:12:27] Wilderness and I saw a woman sit on a
[1:12:31] Scarlet colored Beast full of names of
[1:12:34] blasphemy and having seven heads and 10
[1:12:37] horns now the Bible will tell you she
[1:12:39] sits on a city of seven heels and so on
[1:12:42] but look I want to point R on this why
[1:12:45] names a
[1:12:47] blasphemy why names a blasphemy do you
[1:12:50] know it is
[1:12:52] Blasphemous for the church to be called
[1:12:55] called by any other name than his
[1:13:00] name amen when the church takes on names
[1:13:03] of Baptist Methodist Catholic she has
[1:13:06] taken on her own name which is blasphemy
[1:13:10] before
[1:13:12] God the bride is to take on his name
[1:13:17] amen now so as you look at this in verse
[1:13:20] four and the church the woman was
[1:13:23] arrayed in purple and scarlet color and
[1:13:26] decked with gold in precious stones and
[1:13:28] Pearls having a golden cup in her
[1:13:30] handful of Abominations and filthiness
[1:13:33] of her fornication and upon her forehead
[1:13:36] a name written now what I want you to
[1:13:39] see this she didn't write her name here
[1:13:42] the same one that Mark Cain in the
[1:13:46] beginning is the same one that writes on
[1:13:49] This Woman's
[1:13:51] forehead and says here is her true
[1:13:54] identity
[1:13:55] she is Mystery Babylon the great the
[1:13:59] mother of harlots and the Abominations
[1:14:02] of the earth now God marks her as a
[1:14:06] prostitute now watch and he said I saw
[1:14:09] this woman
[1:14:12] drunken with the blood of the Saints and
[1:14:15] with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus
[1:14:17] and when I saw her I wondered I I
[1:14:20] marveled at her you know you you can
[1:14:22] look at this great church and how could
[1:14:25] she be this how could the church turn
[1:14:29] into such a thing but this is what we
[1:14:31] have had and in this in in seven Gentile
[1:14:35] Church ages we wind up with the Book of
[1:14:37] Revelation being about two women one a
[1:14:40] wh and her daughters and the other The
[1:14:43] Virtuous bride of Jesus Christ so you
[1:14:46] see it all comes up in a climax here God
[1:14:49] has a bride the devil has a bride
[1:14:56] so how in the world could this LW woman
[1:15:01] be God's
[1:15:04] voice a wife is to represent her
[1:15:08] husband the two are one she is to act
[1:15:13] and to speak in his
[1:15:15] name amen but this is her condition
[1:15:18] she's not only polluted her womb but
[1:15:20] she's guilty of murdering his children
[1:15:25] she has
[1:15:27] daughters that try to
[1:15:29] identify with him too and and God calls
[1:15:32] him harlots for they too have rejected
[1:15:35] his
[1:15:36] lordship and they are no longer virgins
[1:15:39] listen when Christ comes back he's going
[1:15:41] to have a virgin to the word she will
[1:15:44] know no man-made Creeds so the Bible
[1:15:47] tells you here that she was this woman
[1:15:51] was arrayed with in purple and scar
[1:15:55] dealt with with go decked with gold and
[1:15:58] precious stones and pearls and had a
[1:16:00] golden cup in her in her hand this full
[1:16:02] of Abominations and filthiness of her
[1:16:05] fornication so who is this woman and
[1:16:09] where do we find her also in the in the
[1:16:11] Book of Revelation we find her in the
[1:16:14] Book of Revelation over in Revelation
[1:16:17] 3:17 because you see this is written of
[1:16:21] the false Vine in leoa she claimed seems
[1:16:25] to be a rich church because thou sayest
[1:16:29] I am rich I'm increased with goods and I
[1:16:32] have need of nothing you see that's her
[1:16:34] assessment of
[1:16:36] herself amen but here's God's assessment
[1:16:40] here's the way God assesses the church
[1:16:44] watch and knowest not that thou art
[1:16:48] wretched and miserable and poor and
[1:16:51] blind and naked so I counsel thee to buy
[1:16:55] of me gold tried in the fire that thou
[1:16:58] mayest be rich and white rment that thou
[1:17:00] mayest be clothed and that the shame of
[1:17:02] thy nakedness do not appear and anoint
[1:17:05] th eyes with eyes that they may see you
[1:17:07] see Le oia is prophesied to be
[1:17:11] blind the last age goes into total
[1:17:15] blindness now I want you to look at the
[1:17:17] verses before he said of her I know your
[1:17:21] Works Thou Art neither cold nor hot I
[1:17:24] would you were cold or hot so then
[1:17:27] because you are lukewarm neither cold
[1:17:29] nor hot I will spew thee out of my
[1:17:32] mouth now as we look at this we want to
[1:17:37] understand she is no longer his
[1:17:44] voice he has sped her out of his
[1:17:47] mouth she is no longer speaking for him
[1:17:51] oh she speaks of herself come on what
[1:17:54] God said of her and what she says of
[1:17:56] herself is two different things she's
[1:17:59] saying I'm rich I'm increased with Goods
[1:18:01] you know I sit like a queen I'll know no
[1:18:04] sorrow as it says in Revelation 18 all
[1:18:06] of these things that she is saying about
[1:18:09] herself and God's got a different
[1:18:11] assessment of her so she and God are not
[1:18:14] saying the same
[1:18:17] thing notice so he says I'll spew you
[1:18:20] out of my
[1:18:21] mouth so now as we examine that
[1:18:25] that in the Dark Ages the word was
[1:18:28] almost entirely lost to the people
[1:18:30] listen even how to be baptized immersion
[1:18:33] simple thing is immersion was lost
[1:18:35] replaced for
[1:18:37] sprinkling the the water baptism in the
[1:18:40] name of the Lord Jesus Christ was lost
[1:18:43] and here we have we have down Through
[1:18:46] the Ages a trinitarian concept the idea
[1:18:50] and the understanding of that God is one
[1:18:53] not three comes lost in the ages a lot
[1:18:58] of confusion and he said God sent Luther
[1:19:01] with the word notice and he says the
[1:19:06] Lutheran spoke for God at that time so
[1:19:10] there was a time God actually spoke
[1:19:12] through them but they organized and
[1:19:15] again the pure word was lost for
[1:19:17] organization tends toward Dogman and
[1:19:19] Creeds not simple word and they could no
[1:19:22] longer speak for God and then God sent
[1:19:24] Wes
[1:19:25] and he was the voice with the word in
[1:19:27] his day and the people who took his
[1:19:30] Revelation from God became living
[1:19:33] Epistles read and known of all men for
[1:19:35] their generation and when the Methodist
[1:19:37] failed God raised up others and so it
[1:19:40] has gone on through the years until in
[1:19:44] this last day there is again another
[1:19:47] people in the land who under their
[1:19:50] Messenger will be the final voice to the
[1:19:54] final
[1:19:55] age so now we we notice here there is
[1:19:59] now another people God calling a people
[1:20:04] out in this day to himself and and so he
[1:20:07] goes on to talk about how the church is
[1:20:10] no longer his
[1:20:12] mouthpiece of the mouthpiece of God so
[1:20:15] God is turning on her and he will
[1:20:17] confound her through the prophet in The
[1:20:19] Bride for the voice of God will be in
[1:20:22] her yes it is for it says in the last
[1:20:26] chapter of Revelation 17 the spirit and
[1:20:28] the or verse 17 says the spirit and the
[1:20:31] bride say come notice here you have a
[1:20:34] woman who is saying the same thing the
[1:20:38] spirit
[1:20:39] says come on Amen we have Leia who said
[1:20:44] God saying one thing she says
[1:20:46] another amen you have in the last
[1:20:49] chapter of Revelation in verse 17 the
[1:20:52] spirit and the bride say come so the
[1:20:55] spirit and the bride are speaking in
[1:20:56] unison she is saying what the spirit
[1:21:00] says once more the word the world will
[1:21:04] hear direct from God as at Pentecost but
[1:21:08] of course that word bride will be
[1:21:10] repudiated as in the first age so don't
[1:21:13] be surprised at the rejection because
[1:21:15] the word of God is totally set
[1:21:18] aside now so God has a voice and his
[1:21:22] voice today is in a word bride she is
[1:21:27] the anointed one of this day this is
[1:21:30] what brother Brandon brought to us in
[1:21:32] Christ the mystery he said and there
[1:21:34] would come a time forth when he could
[1:21:36] express himself in the fullness of his
[1:21:39] godhead deity through his church have
[1:21:42] preeminence in this church oh my what
[1:21:44] the anointed
[1:21:46] man but now the anointed
[1:21:50] people Al Mighty bring back the anointed
[1:21:53] bride and bridegroom now you see there's
[1:21:55] a bride that's anointed like he
[1:21:58] is amen now not only is she his voice
[1:22:03] but she is the
[1:22:07] resurrection amen now this was spoke of
[1:22:09] the groom when he said to Martha said
[1:22:12] your brother will will rise again and
[1:22:14] she said well yeah I know he'll rise
[1:22:15] again in the resurrection and whatever
[1:22:17] but Jesus assured said I am the
[1:22:20] resurrection amen I am the resurrection
[1:22:24] and though though Lazarus was dead yet
[1:22:27] he would live amen now that same word
[1:22:32] that speaks of the groom when Jesus said
[1:22:35] I am the resurrection and the life it
[1:22:38] must be what we can say of a end time
[1:22:42] people a people who are the resurrection
[1:22:46] who are the life of God come on they are
[1:22:50] they are the embodiment of the spirit of
[1:22:53] God so so again the the same word that
[1:22:57] speaks of the groom it also speaks of
[1:23:01] the Bride so you see again this is a
[1:23:05] very important to understand what
[1:23:07] whatever you see a m Mr Jesus you got to
[1:23:11] understand is to be manifested in Miser
[1:23:18] Jesus now so go back and look at the
[1:23:21] prophecies go back and look at the new
[1:23:24] test
[1:23:24] as a
[1:23:26] prophecy and understand the same word
[1:23:30] that spoke of the groom speaks of the
[1:23:32] Bride now Jesus proved he was a
[1:23:36] resurrection how did he do that because
[1:23:38] he rose from the dead and he did it by
[1:23:41] the spirit of God that was in him now
[1:23:44] Jesus came to bring dead men to Life by
[1:23:49] making a way to put his Spirit within us
[1:23:52] that we who were dead could also live
[1:23:56] amen now so the Bible said if the spirit
[1:24:00] of him that raised up Jesus from the
[1:24:03] dead shall dwell in you amen he that
[1:24:06] raised up Christ from the dead shall
[1:24:08] also make
[1:24:11] aive Quicken life your mortal bodies by
[1:24:16] that spirit that dwelleth in you that's
[1:24:19] what the Holy Spirit does in your life
[1:24:21] it makes your mortal body alive to
[1:24:26] God Amen now our first birth births us
[1:24:30] into
[1:24:31] sin so we were born dead to God and the
[1:24:36] and to the spirit realm totally blocked
[1:24:39] off from it and we were blocked from its
[1:24:42] Supernatural power but we were born very
[1:24:45] much alive to these five senses and
[1:24:49] alive to sin and to his desires and to
[1:24:52] his vices
[1:24:55] the Bible tells you in Ephesians that
[1:24:58] when even we when were dead in sins hath
[1:25:02] quickened us together with Christ by
[1:25:05] grace are you saved and has raised us up
[1:25:08] together and made us sit together in
[1:25:11] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus notice
[1:25:15] this number one we were
[1:25:17] dead we were born dead being born into
[1:25:22] by this first life by his first nature
[1:25:25] we were born dead to God and to the
[1:25:28] supernatural realm to the spirit amen we
[1:25:32] were born in sin and we were we were
[1:25:35] dead in sin but when a Believer becomes
[1:25:39] a person becomes a believer in Christ
[1:25:41] and are filled with the Holy Spirit we
[1:25:44] we know that first they are considered
[1:25:47] spiritually dead but now they are made
[1:25:51] spiritually alive and they are dead to
[1:25:53] sin
[1:25:56] and they're dead to their old life as if
[1:25:58] they were crucified alongside of Christ
[1:26:02] and they're now alive with a new life in
[1:26:04] him essentially signifying a complete
[1:26:08] transformation of freedom from the power
[1:26:10] of sin through their Union with Christ
[1:26:13] death and his resurrection you see when
[1:26:16] you are born again that is resurrected
[1:26:19] life in you and you can say I am the
[1:26:23] resurrection yes I was dead in sins and
[1:26:27] trespasses but now I am alive forever
[1:26:30] more amen I'll never go back to sin
[1:26:34] again because once you're sealed to the
[1:26:37] day of redemption friend you don't go
[1:26:39] back no turning back so Romans would say
[1:26:45] this as Paul would say what shall we say
[1:26:47] then shall we continue in sin that we
[1:26:50] can have more grace or the grace shall
[1:26:52] abound but God forbid how shall we that
[1:26:55] are dead to sin live any longer therein
[1:26:59] you see you can't do it so when a
[1:27:02] Believer receives Christ and filled with
[1:27:05] the spirit they are they are risen with
[1:27:09] Christ you have resurrected I mean why
[1:27:12] do you think that we baptize you unto
[1:27:15] the dead as the Bible
[1:27:17] said baptize us unto the dead well the
[1:27:20] Mormons go over there and they baptize a
[1:27:21] bunch
[1:27:22] of baptize person many times for dead
[1:27:26] people that's not what he's talking
[1:27:27] about you were baptized unto unto dead
[1:27:30] because your old life is
[1:27:33] dead and the old man is dead and we're
[1:27:37] burying that one in a watery grave and
[1:27:40] but we're not leaving him there we are
[1:27:43] resurrecting him up to walk in the
[1:27:46] newness of life so your very baptism is
[1:27:50] symbolic of your death burial and
[1:27:53] Resurrection
[1:27:57] so you see you see as he says in
[1:28:01] Colossians if you then be risen with
[1:28:04] Christ seek those things that are above
[1:28:07] where Christ sth on the right hand of
[1:28:09] God set your affection on things above
[1:28:12] not on things of the Earth for you are
[1:28:15] dead and your life is hid in Christ with
[1:28:19] Christ in God so we have been raised up
[1:28:22] to sit together in Heavenly places
[1:28:25] Romans 6 says knowing this that our old
[1:28:28] man is crucified now we get it crucified
[1:28:33] you have been crucified we have killed
[1:28:36] the old man you know that really that's
[1:28:38] what the altar is for why was an altar
[1:28:41] in the Old Testament it was a place

[1:32:46] what it done for them but I want you to
[1:32:48] see not will it has done the same for
[1:32:52] you amen he rose and could say I am the
[1:32:58] resurrection you have risen from sin and

[1:33:05] resurrection and you are to give voice
[1:33:07] to that
[1:33:08] resurrection that Resurrection Life it
[1:33:11] comes it lives out of you notice
[1:33:14] quickens a mortal body this Mortal body
[1:33:17] that we live and it quickens it in other
[1:33:20] words brings to
[1:33:22] life and
[1:33:26] amen now you who once walked along with
[1:33:31] a big great big cigar in your mouth and
[1:33:34] everything bunch of cigarettes you women
[1:33:37] who once had short hair painted and
[1:33:40] carried on wore shorts and things like
[1:33:43] that all at once something screamed you
[1:33:47] you look down here and it was the word
[1:33:49] and it quickened your you said no more
[1:33:51] shorts for me no more for me no more
[1:33:55] lying no more stealing no more this or
[1:33:58] that the spirit that raised him from the
[1:34:01] dead dwelling in you will also bring
[1:34:03] your mortal body the dust of the earth
[1:34:06] into
[1:34:08] subjection you see what is it subjection
[1:34:10] to what Christ and who is Christ the
[1:34:12] word not the theology but the
[1:34:15] word then you say what these things oh I
[1:34:18] think it's all right for women to wear
[1:34:20] slacks the word said no see it quickens
[1:34:23] you to that you're drawn to it and you
[1:34:25] see then you become part of that word
[1:34:29] now so even so the bride is being filled
[1:34:33] with the spirit she has been made
[1:34:37] alive she is the living bride there has
[1:34:41] to be a people
[1:34:42] alive and remain at the come of the Lord
[1:34:46] and I mean more than physically alive
[1:34:48] but spiritually alive and how could you
[1:34:51] be spiritually alive without the entire
[1:34:55] deity the power of the Holy Spirit
[1:34:57] coming in you and quickening you to life
[1:35:01] again so you see she's a living bride
[1:35:05] and she gives voice to the resurrection
[1:35:08] so you see we were in tuned also as a
[1:35:12] church now let's move it away from the
[1:35:14] individual to the body of the church and
[1:35:18] and so so we we were inomed in
[1:35:23] nomination ations sealed with Creeds now
[1:35:26] remember on Jesus tomb they put Roman
[1:35:30] seals on our tombs on the church's tomb
[1:35:34] we got sealed behind Roman
[1:35:36] seals Creeds of man Trinity doctrines
[1:35:40] Triune Gods all kinds of you know
[1:35:44] novenas and and all kinds of edicts and
[1:35:48] pople papa bulls and everything else
[1:35:51] seal behind
[1:35:53] kept dead in tombs remember they sealed
[1:35:59] Jesus in to make sure he stay
[1:36:03] dead and the devil did the same thing
[1:36:06] with the church and she went down at
[1:36:09] night see a Rome he sealed her there in
[1:36:11] tombs of
[1:36:13] religion and put seals on her to make
[1:36:15] sure she stayed
[1:36:18] dead are you with me and then now so
[1:36:22] here brother bradam says and today
[1:36:25] they're trying to keep Christ in a tomb
[1:36:28] but oh what a Easter morning done an
[1:36:31] Easter morning ruined all their Theology
[1:36:34] and when a Easter morning came for a
[1:36:36] people a church here 1900 years later it
[1:36:39] ruined their theology he's not dead he's
[1:36:42] alive forever more and they can't keep
[1:36:44] him in no tomb amen you can't you can
[1:36:48] put him in a Methodist tomb or a Baptist
[1:36:51] tomb or a presbyterian tomb or whatever
[1:36:53] you want to he raised up out of that
[1:36:56] tomb and he's alive today I had a
[1:36:59] Baptist tomb you might had a Methodist
[1:37:01] tomb but one day Jesus rose up from
[1:37:03] there from a historic God to a living
[1:37:07] present God alive forever more
[1:37:10] Hallelujah that ought to make us shout
[1:37:13] to realize we have been
[1:37:16] released from the tomb broke the seals
[1:37:19] of the Doom the church that was born
[1:37:23] alive Al on the day of Pentecost during
[1:37:26] the Dark Ages was killed on a Roman Tree
[1:37:29] life forced out of her she lay lifeless
[1:37:33] dead void of the Holy Spirit say in
[1:37:36] their hell mares pray in their rosaries
[1:37:40] dead powerless Ed in tombs of religion
[1:37:45] until we have
[1:37:46] graveyards full of
[1:37:49] tombstones and
[1:37:51] tombs come on and man graveyards full of
[1:37:55] churches with all kinds of names on the
[1:37:59] tombstone of Catholic Baptist Methodist
[1:38:02] Pentecostal all kinds of
[1:38:04] organization somebody with me because
[1:38:07] every time they organized they died
[1:38:10] every time they sat there and they and
[1:38:13] they put a period to what they believe
[1:38:15] instead of moving on with God there they
[1:38:19] died God left them in the
[1:38:21] dust but God said I will have a church
[1:38:25] I'll have a bride without spot or
[1:38:27] wrinkle I will restore sayeth the Lord
[1:38:30] how many believes in restoration this
[1:38:32] morning he's a God that restore we heard
[1:38:35] the voice of God that said come out of
[1:38:37] her my
[1:38:39] people amen come on this time he wasn't
[1:38:42] saying Lazarus he was saying my people
[1:38:46] and he said come out of her my people
[1:38:48] come out of those morgs where the
[1:38:50] atmosphere is 40 bil deg degrees below
[1:38:54] zero and cold and dead and
[1:38:56] indifference you me to show you here's
[1:38:59] where he said it Revelation
[1:39:02] 181 after these things I saw another
[1:39:05] angel now remember an angel is a
[1:39:08] messenger remember is an anointing
[1:39:10] coming down it comes down from heaven we
[1:39:14] having great power and Earth was
[1:39:16] lightened with his glory understand this
[1:39:18] wasn't done in a corner amen this was
[1:39:21] the Earth was lightened with his glory
[1:39:23] and he cried and I want you to
[1:39:25] understand this word cried is exactly
[1:39:27] Revelation then cried and say exactly
[1:39:30] first Thessalonians four
[1:39:34] shout he cried mightily with a strong
[1:39:38] voice saying proclaiming Babylon the
[1:39:43] greatest Fallen is fallen and has become
[1:39:46] the habitation of devils and the hold of
[1:39:49] every foul Spirit and the cage of every
[1:39:52] unclean and hateful word that is the
[1:39:55] condition of organized
[1:39:57] religion amen All Nations have drunk of
[1:40:01] the wine of her the wrath of her
[1:40:02] fornication the kings of the Earth have
[1:40:04] committed fornication with her and the
[1:40:06] merchants of the Earth are wax Rich
[1:40:08] through the abundance of her
[1:40:10] Delicacies my think about this
[1:40:14] contaminated the whole world and I heard
[1:40:17] another voice from heaven now here's
[1:40:20] Heaven's Echo to what this angel said
[1:40:22] saying come come out of her my people
[1:40:26] that you be not partakers of her sins
[1:40:29] and that you receive not of her plagues
[1:40:32] now wait a minute her plagues are coming
[1:40:34] in the tribulation
[1:40:36] ahead and the Rapture takes place before
[1:40:38] that so in order for there to be a
[1:40:41] Rapture there has to be a
[1:40:43] resurrection out of
[1:40:46] denominationalism the voice of God
[1:40:48] saying come out of her my people that
[1:40:52] you be not partakers of her sin and that
[1:40:56] you receive not of her plagues for her
[1:40:59] sins like Sodom have reached to heaven
[1:41:02] and God has remembered her iniquities
[1:41:05] reward her even as she has rewarded you
[1:41:08] and double and double there what
[1:41:12] according to her works and in the in the
[1:41:16] cup which she has f f to her double how
[1:41:19] much she glorified herself and lived
[1:41:21] deliciously and so much torment and
[1:41:23] sorrow give her for she said in her
[1:41:25] heart I sit as a queen I am no Widow and
[1:41:29] shall see no sorrow therefore shall her
[1:41:32] plagues come in one day death and
[1:41:35] mourning and famine and she shall be
[1:41:37] utterly burned with fire same thing God
[1:41:40] did with prostitutes in the Old
[1:41:42] Testament for strong is the Lord who God
[1:41:45] who judges her amen oh my you remember
[1:41:50] Ezekiel 38 remember the dry bones where
[1:41:53] he said come
[1:41:56] alive how did they live how did they
[1:41:59] live the word of God through a
[1:42:02] prophet brought them
[1:42:05] life amen this is the way that happened
[1:42:08] prophesy son of man and it is the son of
[1:42:12] man prophesying are you with me Christ
[1:42:15] is the son of man prophesying through a
[1:42:18] son of man a prophet amen through sons
[1:42:21] of men and those sons of men are New
[1:42:24] Testament prophets and preachers the
[1:42:26] bride and his calling come out of the
[1:42:30] tombs I'm looking to a people today who
[1:42:33] heard that voice come
[1:42:35] out come on maybe some of you don't have
[1:42:39] all of the the the the death Rags that's
[1:42:41] been red around you and you got all
[1:42:44] wrapped up and Tangled Up and Theology
[1:42:46] and ideas and everything maybe some of
[1:42:48] that hadn't been yet been loose but
[1:42:50] you've risen out of there
[1:42:53] amen I tell you the word goes for
[1:42:55] Lazarus loose him and let him go that's
[1:42:59] the word today amen loose them from the
[1:43:02] bondages of Sin from the bondages of
[1:43:05] sickness from the darkness of this world
[1:43:07] loose them let him
[1:43:13] go amen there's all sorts of tombs let
[1:43:18] me just say that there's all sorts of
[1:43:20] tombs there's tombs of religion
[1:43:24] there's tombs of sin there's tombs of
[1:43:27] depression there's tombs of complexes
[1:43:30] there's tombs of
[1:43:32] sickness there's tombs of habits but the
[1:43:36] voice of God has been released and there
[1:43:39] is a bride that is speaking at that said
[1:43:41] loose them let them go come out of
[1:43:46] her I'm telling you today you don't have
[1:43:49] to keep living in bondage young people
[1:43:52] don't have to be slaves to pornography
[1:43:54] sex sins and fornication has no has no
[1:43:58] right to rule over children of God you
[1:44:00] do not have to remain in some tomb and
[1:44:03] dead in sins and trespasses when the
[1:44:06] voice of God is going forth saying loose
[1:44:10] them let them
[1:44:15] go before his
[1:44:17] resurrection Jesus
[1:44:20] spoke with resurrection power and before
[1:44:24] the resurrection of the Bride where she
[1:44:26] physically will raise from The Seven
[1:44:27] Ages there will be there's a people on
[1:44:30] the Earth who would speak with
[1:44:31] resurrection power giv life that's what
[1:44:35] we're
[1:44:36] doing we're speaking over you we're
[1:44:39] calling come out Rise Up from that dead
[1:44:43] put away those stiny Works those dirty
[1:44:47] habits that sinful life you don't have
[1:44:50] to live that any longer you can be free
[1:44:53] to serve the Living God come out of the
[1:44:59] tombs
[1:45:01] Hallelujah you see Jesus became the
[1:45:06] voice he became the manifestation of the
[1:45:10] scripture the voice of the scripture and
[1:45:13] so must the bride the voice of the word
[1:45:18] will be spoken through
[1:45:21] her not only is she a word bride she
[1:45:23] don't just have it to be a word bride
[1:45:26] she does it to
[1:45:28] speak Amen to say or
[1:45:32] Mountain to be a Mountain Mover a devil
[1:45:36] defeater a serpent Bruiser I'm talking
[1:45:39] to you this morning amen I'm talking to
[1:45:42] you if youve Reed life you ought to
[1:45:44] rejoice in it and say here I am I have
[1:45:48] received that life and I am that
[1:45:51] Resurrection it lives in me
[1:45:55] amen now so as we look at this Jesus
[1:46:01] became the voice and so will the bride
[1:46:03] be the voice of The Words which will be
[1:46:06] spoken through her now this is a new age
[1:46:11] now not meaning a new church age because
[1:46:14] there's only seven of them but it is a
[1:46:16] bride age the where the groom is united
[1:46:20] in marriage to the bride you see she has
[1:46:23] his name his
[1:46:25] identification his life his power she is
[1:46:31] him so the two have become one now this
[1:46:36] is what brother bradam tells us in it is
[1:46:38] the rising of the sun he said as Christ
[1:46:41] was the first one from all the prophets
[1:46:44] and so forth although typed to many
[1:46:46] places he was the first fruits of those
[1:46:48] that slept now stop for a minute we have
[1:46:50] been through seven ages and they have
[1:46:53] been sleeping for Seven Ages there has
[1:46:55] to be a first fruit of those who
[1:46:59] slept a people who come back to the
[1:47:01] original Power the original life who
[1:47:04] have resurrection power and life in them
[1:47:06] come on Amen who have broke the seals of
[1:47:09] the Tomb the seals are open the
[1:47:12] Mysteries
[1:47:14] revealed are you are you with me now now
[1:47:18] watch these words in the bride coming of
[1:47:22] Christ
[1:47:24] notice this because before he can come
[1:47:28] in the meeting in the air and how many
[1:47:31] want to see
[1:47:34] Jesus that's a longing of a
[1:47:37] heart but before he can come he has to
[1:47:43] make himself manifest fully in his
[1:47:50] church so before he comes again as
[1:47:55] groom he's got to manifest himself in
[1:48:00] entirely in completion in his
[1:48:05] bride so D if I could say it to you
[1:48:09] there had to be the word coming of
[1:48:13] Christ but now we are in the bride
[1:48:17] coming of
[1:48:20] Christ so Christ is come no not the man
[1:48:25] Jesus we will meet him in the air but
[1:48:28] Christ is the Holy Spirit and he is here
[1:48:31] it's the spirit of Christ it's not
[1:48:33] another spirit it's not one of the
[1:48:34] Trinity it is God himself and he's come
[1:48:38] and has manifest himself to a bride body
[1:48:41] and that bride is his body on Earth his
[1:48:44] voice on Earth in the bride coming of
[1:48:47] Christ coming out of the church there
[1:48:50] will have to be a sheath waved again
[1:48:52] another words another one come to
[1:48:55] maturity that God picks up and says okay
[1:48:58] here's the first
[1:49:02] fruits here she is the first one come to
[1:49:07] maturity so that the rest of them can
[1:49:10] come up you see when Jesus rose he was
[1:49:14] the first fruits of those that slept and
[1:49:17] you are the first
[1:49:19] fruits of those who slept AB
[1:49:24] right now so there had to be a sheath
[1:49:29] waved again in the last days remember
[1:49:33] waving of the sheath we've been through
[1:49:35] it many times what was the sheath the
[1:49:37] first one that come to mature so the
[1:49:39] first bunch of grain that came to
[1:49:41] maturity the first one that proved it
[1:49:43] was wheat that proved it was a sheath
[1:49:46] Hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm
[1:49:48] talking about it was waved over the
[1:49:50] people and for the first time there will
[1:49:53] come forth for the bright age for a
[1:49:57] resurrection what out of where dark
[1:50:03] denominationalism Hallelujah will come
[1:50:06] an Easter
[1:50:07] message Hallelujah that the full
[1:50:10] majority of the word is turned back and
[1:50:12] is again in its full power and being
[1:50:15] waved over the People by the same signs
[1:50:18] and wonders that he did back there oh
[1:50:21] Hallelujah
[1:50:23] this is what is promised that is our
[1:50:25] message Church the word is turned back
[1:50:29] and is again it's here in full power and
[1:50:33] it's being waved over us every time you
[1:50:36] feel the Holy Spirit move over your
[1:50:38] being every time you feel the Holy
[1:50:40] Spirit sweep through this church it is
[1:50:43] his holy spirit waving over you picking
[1:50:46] you up and showing you things and
[1:50:48] revealing himself and manifesting His
[1:50:51] glory in your life
[1:50:53] life saying you are not in the Tomb
[1:50:58] anymore no wonder we can dance in the
[1:51:01] spirit no wonder we can shout up and
[1:51:04] down the aisles no wonder we can glorify
[1:51:07] God somebody help me preach amen no
[1:51:10] wonder we can see signs and wonders and
[1:51:13] miracles and healings and
[1:51:15] deliverance come on Amen don't expect to
[1:51:19] to be less and less expect it to be more
[1:51:21] and more
[1:51:23] Hallelujah because he is
[1:51:27] waving I
[1:51:30] just he's waving
[1:51:34] it now
[1:51:36] watch holding up for all to see thanking
[1:51:40] God for the
[1:51:41] Harvest God's picking up a people in
[1:51:44] this day and he's thaning he he is he is
[1:51:46] being thanked for a harvest amen that
[1:51:49] Harvest is going to include all of the
[1:51:52] Bride to The Seven Ages we are about to
[1:51:54] see a
[1:51:57] resurrection hallelujah amen already the
[1:52:01] voice of it is
[1:52:03] here amen now I just want to just say
[1:52:09] this as we look at it we know the third
[1:52:12] pull was the opening of the seven of the
[1:52:15] Seven Seals are revealing of the
[1:52:16] Mysteries and when we say third puls
[1:52:19] brother Brandon referred that it come
[1:52:20] from a vision it was symbolic we you
[1:52:22] don't have time to go into all the
[1:52:23] symbology of that in the vision there's
[1:52:26] a there's a lot of details in it but it
[1:52:29] was the third pull which he called third
[1:52:31] phase of his
[1:52:33] ministry you know it started out with a
[1:52:35] sign in his hand whereby he would take a
[1:52:38] person by hand and the disease would act
[1:52:41] out on his hand as even as Moses was
[1:52:43] given two signs so was he given two
[1:52:46] signs because we were in an
[1:52:49] exodus and so again with this sign in
[1:52:52] his hand it would it would actually you
[1:52:56] know tell diseases and if it was a germ
[1:52:58] disease it would reveal the diseases
[1:53:01] what it was and so on and then after
[1:53:03] prayer it would show if it was still
[1:53:05] there we knew the life was still there
[1:53:07] if it was gone life was
[1:53:10] gone then the second part of it that was
[1:53:12] healing the second part was prophesying
[1:53:15] that was the stage that I witnessed
[1:53:17] brother Brandon M he had you know he
[1:53:19] would discern the thoughts and intense
[1:53:21] of the heart and
[1:53:23] without
[1:53:24] fail never one
[1:53:26] time up on thousands of thousands of
[1:53:30] cases are you with me amen and prophesy
[1:53:33] over an individual your name is so and
[1:53:36] so you came from so and so you're you're
[1:53:38] so and so you're going to be
[1:53:40] well or sometimes I see prepare for
[1:53:45] death because you don't have many days
[1:53:48] to
[1:53:48] live because he saw it turn dark over
[1:53:51] them and the faith not to turn it so you
[1:53:54] see the third pull was a third phase
[1:53:57] which he thought would manifest in
[1:53:59] another Divine Healing
[1:54:02] move maybe it would be under some kind
[1:54:04] of tent or Cathedral he couldn't
[1:54:06] describe exactly what it was under but
[1:54:08] it was all in symbology the whole
[1:54:11] thing and so as he as he looked at all
[1:54:14] of this he he was told you know about
[1:54:17] the third phase of his ministry and he
[1:54:19] wondered he pondered he tried this tried
[1:54:21] that to make it happen cuz he thought it
[1:54:23] would be another greater Divine Healing
[1:54:25] gift he's a man he had to probe at
[1:54:28] things just like you and I probe at
[1:54:29] things yes Ponder
[1:54:33] Wonder amen Venture without Authority
[1:54:36] presume all of those things and he would
[1:54:40] come down to the end of his ministry and
[1:54:42] look back and he said the third pull was
[1:54:45] the opening of The Seven seal now it was
[1:54:47] healing but it was healing on a
[1:54:49] different level
[1:54:52] it was to heal the bride elect of the
[1:54:55] false doctrines of the ages by opening
[1:54:59] the book where we could say with
[1:55:03] authority that's right cuz we've had all
[1:55:06] kinds of
[1:55:07] theologians so he said is he said May
[1:55:10] there come forth a Revival of the
[1:55:14] just how many's righteous this morning
[1:55:18] are you righteous to his blood amen so
[1:55:21] that may there be a Revival you can you
[1:55:23] can pray with the prophet a Revival for
[1:55:26] the righteous and a great power come
[1:55:29] upon the church just before it's going
[1:55:34] where are we at and it's not hard to
[1:55:37] pray that because you promised it and
[1:55:41] we're looking Lord for that third pole
[1:55:43] that we know that will do great things
[1:55:45] for us in our
[1:55:49] midst now the third pull that's opening
[1:55:52] the word but it's not just theology it's
[1:55:54] the opening of the word and his power
[1:55:57] you know it's like brother brandham told
[1:55:59] us said what we need today is an opening
[1:56:02] of the word that
[1:56:03] lives a lot of this which they call
[1:56:06] opening of the word is dead it's just
[1:56:08] more
[1:56:09] Creeds it binds the Holy Spirit it will
[1:56:13] not let him work but you see it's that
[1:56:16] third pull is and part of manifestation
[1:56:19] of that was word spoken by a child of
[1:56:22] God that said little fishy I give you
[1:56:25] life resurrection power amen if make a
[1:56:29] dead fish live what will it do for the
[1:56:31] dead
[1:56:32] Church come on what will it do for the
[1:56:35] dead in
[1:56:37] Christ I'm talking about the power
[1:56:39] that's in the word now amen certainly
[1:56:42] the third pull is the open in the word
[1:56:44] but it manifests itself in power and
[1:56:48] Christ is that Capstone that caps the
[1:56:52] Gentile bride with his coming when we
[1:56:55] meet him in the air but already even now
[1:57:00] I want to say this there is already a
[1:57:04] union that you can't see with your
[1:57:07] eyes amen it is an invisible Union and
[1:57:11] Christ has slipped on you the wedding
[1:57:14] band of un predestinated unmar
[1:57:19] Grace amen he slipped it on your finger
[1:57:22] before the foundation of the world but
[1:57:24] he showed you see I've all you've always
[1:57:26] been mine I have chose you Hallelujah
[1:57:30] you are mine little church you are
[1:57:37] mine and as a word bride in his very
[1:57:40] image she has to fit him remember the
[1:57:45] Capstone and the living bride must be
[1:57:47] exactly like in order to unite together
[1:57:49] for it to sit down on the body
[1:57:53] now Israel we know how to leave Egypt
[1:57:56] its Gods its priest in order to go to
[1:57:59] the promis
[1:58:01] land right we had to leave the
[1:58:04] her Harlot daughters her
[1:58:08] theologians her Sorcerers her Creeds her
[1:58:12] dogmas we had to leave the tombs of our
[1:58:17] bondage amen now this is what brother
[1:58:21] Bram said and the church has to do the
[1:58:24] same thing get out of that group of
[1:58:27] rejectors over into the promise before
[1:58:31] the Messiah can ever be manifested
[1:58:33] before them you see the life of the
[1:58:35] Messiah manifested making a church ready
[1:58:38] a bride a woman marry a man and
[1:58:42] disagreeing with him it would be some
[1:58:44] kind of fuss continually but when a man
[1:58:48] and his wife his girlfriend his asout
[1:58:51] when they are in Perfect Harmony like
[1:58:53] one soul and one mind because they're
[1:58:55] going to be one flesh then when the
[1:58:57] church can get in such harmony with God
[1:59:00] until the manifestation of the
[1:59:02] bridegroom is manifested in the bride
[1:59:05] because they're going to be
[1:59:08] one hallelujah amen so he cannot marry a
[1:59:12] woman disagreeing with
[1:59:15] him he she can't marry somebody and
[1:59:17] they're saying you God you're three and
[1:59:19] he said no I'm one no you're three no
[1:59:21] I'm one
[1:59:23] no you're three there there's three of I
[1:59:25] have three
[1:59:27] husbands Father Son and Holy Ghost and I
[1:59:30] ain't going to leave one of them out and
[1:59:31] I'll pray to each one
[1:59:33] equally I'm going to love one as much as
[1:59:35] I love the other and God says I'm
[1:59:42] one you see you you see again you cannot
[1:59:46] marry a bride and her in constant
[1:59:49] disagreement well Holiness without how
[1:59:52] do you can't see God well God I'm going
[1:59:53] to see you without it I'll wear make my
[1:59:55] makeup right into
[1:59:58] heaven no you won't you
[2:00:01] Harlot amen disobedient to the word
[2:00:05] rebellious it says a sin of Witchcraft
[2:00:08] as iniquity and
[2:00:11] idolatry
[2:00:13] amen so you know again you must get in
[2:00:18] Harmony in order to be United with him
[2:00:20] that's why people won't get the Holy
[2:00:22] Ghost they won't die to their own ideas
[2:00:24] and
[2:00:26] ways now if you review the sermons in
[2:00:29] the Holy Ghost series what the Holy
[2:00:30] Ghost was given for and and question
[2:00:33] answer the Holy Ghost and different ones
[2:00:35] he speaks of how when Luther came with
[2:00:39] justification how that God chipped a
[2:00:42] little bit of the spirit and poured it
[2:00:46] in the church in justification now it
[2:00:48] was the Holy Ghost but only a portion
[2:00:52] and he poured it in the church in
[2:00:54] justification and then in Wesley's day
[2:00:56] he poured out a little more of his
[2:00:58] spirit in
[2:01:00] sanctification and as the ages has
[2:01:02] progressed God has been filling his
[2:01:06] church as he said in the last days 2,000
[2:01:10] years days plural I'll pour out my
[2:01:13] spirit on All
[2:01:15] Flesh
[2:01:17] amen
[2:01:19] so again as we as we look at this just
[2:01:23] for a moment them lutherans back there
[2:01:26] when they got saved they got a portion
[2:01:28] of the spirit Methodist Sanctified that
[2:01:31] was a work of the spirit it was a part
[2:01:34] of the Holy Spirit even the the gifts
[2:01:37] that was poured out it is ausa Street it
[2:01:39] was a portion of the spirit a greater
[2:01:44] portion you know don't don't discount
[2:01:46] that that was the Holy
[2:01:49] Ghost amen and then of course the Zeus
[2:01:52] of movement and and came to zeusa
[2:01:56] movement and and and you know at that
[2:01:59] time he said of this and I'm going to
[2:02:01] get to it here in a moment because often
[2:02:04] we dismiss them as false I want to say
[2:02:07] they weren't all
[2:02:11] false in fact there is much bride as
[2:02:14] your
[2:02:19] bride I'm talking about I'm talking
[2:02:22] about those filled with the spirit
[2:02:26] coming out of ausa street now as we come
[2:02:29] along they come less and less and less
[2:02:31] and less and more and more and more
[2:02:33] Creeds and dogmas of
[2:02:37] man but they were they're often
[2:02:39] dismissed as faults like I said they
[2:02:41] weren't all faults they were the Bride
[2:02:44] of their age they were you see the Shu
[2:02:47] or the chaff is a necessary part of the
[2:02:50] wheat plant
[2:02:52] they were the bride in their time there
[2:02:54] was as much wheat you know in in that
[2:02:56] sense as as as any of it they were the
[2:02:59] bride of Christ in their time they were
[2:03:01] the elect of God they were a true move
[2:03:04] of God and they were just
[2:03:07] green
[2:03:09] unripened because the light of the word
[2:03:13] had not ripened the wheat and there was
[2:03:16] another stage of growth beyond the chaff
[2:03:19] or the shuck
[2:03:21] now I I I'm just going to go over this
[2:03:24] for a moment and just let the haters
[2:03:27] hate but let me just say
[2:03:30] this you
[2:03:32] know this is where what brother Brandon
[2:03:34] spoke
[2:03:36] about he said they were in the minority
[2:03:39] to begin with OR to start with on the
[2:03:42] side of an alley out there with an old
[2:03:44] guitar and women couldn't even afford a
[2:03:47] par of stockings laying out on the
[2:03:50] railroad tracks picking up corn and
[2:03:53] mashing it and making bread for their
[2:03:55] children but what's it come to now watch
[2:03:58] now the most powerful standing Church in
[2:04:03] the world
[2:04:05] today this is what he said of them the
[2:04:08] zeza movement the most powerful standing
[2:04:12] Church in the world
[2:04:15] today not in the eyes of the world but
[2:04:18] in the eyes of God
[2:04:22] because he proves it by what he's doing
[2:04:24] for them he's pouring himself into
[2:04:28] them pouring it
[2:04:31] in that's what he said about
[2:04:34] them the listen again let me say to most
[2:04:37] powerful standing Church in the world
[2:04:40] today in the eyes of
[2:04:44] God that's what isus the street
[2:04:47] was that's what the movement was even in
[2:04:50] 1959
[2:04:52] when he said these
[2:04:53] words this was his assessment I'm using
[2:04:57] the prophet's Authority now that's why
[2:04:59] I'm bringing this out that's I want you
[2:05:02] to see
[2:05:03] it all
[2:05:05] right so this was the isua
[2:05:10] Revival here
[2:05:12] was if you can look where the little
[2:05:14] arrow is pointed there's a little tiny
[2:05:18] head that's forming
[2:05:23] it's all
[2:05:25] green you see represented now listen
[2:05:28] Jesus said as a corn of wheat if it's it
[2:05:31] abides alone he said you know it will
[2:05:35] accomplish nothing he got to be buried
[2:05:37] and come back up and come to life he
[2:05:39] said the kingdom of heaven or the realm
[2:05:41] of the Holy Ghost would be like a man
[2:05:42] planting the seed and he said it would
[2:05:45] come until there would be the blade and
[2:05:47] the tossle and then the full ear when it
[2:05:50] comes to the full ear he will thrust in
[2:05:52] the sickle and he will take it home
[2:05:53] that's the
[2:05:55] Rapture all right so we have been
[2:05:57] through stages of
[2:05:59] restoration and these and really were
[2:06:02] more of a Reformation because as you see
[2:06:05] this is nothing like a mature
[2:06:08] grain it's
[2:06:10] green if you cut it at this stage all
[2:06:13] you have is
[2:06:16] hay or straw for f
[2:06:21] so the only way it can go in the Garner
[2:06:24] is to become into full grain and be
[2:06:28] ripened and it takes the sunlight to do
[2:06:32] that and the sunlight is the word of God
[2:06:36] this is why Revelation 10 shows his face
[2:06:39] as it were the sun because in the end
[2:06:42] time he is here in his full
[2:06:46] light to do what to bring it to complete
[2:06:50] maturity what will the same church that
[2:06:53] was on the day of
[2:06:54] Pentecost because unfortunately as close
[2:06:57] as it was ausa Street
[2:07:05] wasn't so now you have it you have just
[2:07:10] visible and this was ausa Street just
[2:07:13] poking up looks like we got a head we
[2:07:16] got grain we got grain look look see the
[2:07:19] grain see the it's not grain yet
[2:07:22] is still
[2:07:24] Shu the husk is being formed it's coming
[2:07:28] out but it's part of the head it's part
[2:07:31] of the end time
[2:07:34] move are you with me so and he he
[2:07:38] explained to the Lutheran College who
[2:07:40] asked him about the Holy Ghost
[2:07:42] experience ask him about their movement
[2:07:44] and ask him what what we have and he
[2:07:46] said well you know man planted a field
[2:07:48] of corn the first bleach come up and he
[2:07:50] said thank the Lord for corn crop of
[2:07:52] corn he said did he have it well no
[2:07:57] potentially but he had it only in the
[2:07:59] early form and by and by it become a
[2:08:02] stalk and a tossel which came out with
[2:08:04] Methodist and it moves on and then
[2:08:06] there's another stage which is called
[2:08:08] the husk which is the
[2:08:11] Shu or uh you know there's several
[2:08:15] different words for it there the the the
[2:08:18] um the Shu the husk or the chaff three
[2:08:22] different words that we use for this so
[2:08:25] now Luther was the blade and Wesley was
[2:08:28] the tossel but now watch he said it was
[2:08:31] the Lutheran Church that made the Wesley
[2:08:34] church it was the Wesley church that
[2:08:36] made Pentecost but Pentecost what is it
[2:08:39] now I want you to see this for a
[2:08:43] moment because he's looking at
[2:08:48] it he's looking at it and he sees it
[2:08:52] heading
[2:08:54] up and he
[2:08:56] says but Pentecost what is it it's a
[2:09:00] restoration of the same kind of grain
[2:09:04] that went in the ground at the beginning
[2:09:06] bringing back the fullness of the power
[2:09:08] of Pentecost by the baptism of the Holy
[2:09:11] Ghost see in the last
[2:09:15] days now that's what he thought it
[2:09:19] was now remember we could go through and
[2:09:22] it's a whole different sermons but in
[2:09:24] every age there are
[2:09:26] twins there's twins who ever
[2:09:29] Revival we could start in Heaven There
[2:09:32] was in heaven twins there was Michael
[2:09:35] and
[2:09:37] Lucifer Lucifer exalted himself with the
[2:09:39] word he was cast down amen he comes for
[2:09:43] back to down to earth looking for a way
[2:09:45] back into the Heavenly places and the
[2:09:46] only way he can get back is to take the
[2:09:49] the position of man and to get man to to
[2:09:51] do that he has to sin and he has to
[2:09:54] become the Lord of him this is why Satan
[2:09:57] will stand in the heavens and he will he
[2:09:59] will be at the right hand to oppose the
[2:10:01] saints of God that is why we wrestle not
[2:10:04] against flesh and blood but against
[2:10:06] principalities and powers and spiritual
[2:10:08] wickedness in high places Heavenly
[2:10:10] places this is why when job was there
[2:10:13] and of the sons of God appeared satans
[2:10:15] with him because again he is accuser of
[2:10:18] the Brethren he stands there to say you
[2:10:20] have no right to be
[2:10:23] there are you with me but now notice
[2:10:27] here there's those twins there in the
[2:10:29] heavens on the earth what did we have we
[2:10:32] had twins we had the serpent we had we
[2:10:34] had two trees let's look at them we had
[2:10:36] Tree of Life tree of death had a serpent
[2:10:39] right next to man and then man then we
[2:10:42] come right on there's a Jacob there's an
[2:10:44] Esau there's an ishmail there's an Isaac
[2:10:46] there's there there's all all of these
[2:10:49] all the way down to into Jesus there's a
[2:10:51] Jes Jus there's a Judas both of the same
[2:10:53] tribe and you come down the last day and
[2:10:55] there's
[2:10:58] Twins and the twins is a
[2:11:02] Shu
[2:11:03] husk that can be mistaken for the grain
[2:11:08] now you know I've been a farmer so now
[2:11:12] we're going to change varieties but you
[2:11:14] know I like what we call maze or sweet
[2:11:16] corn it's not wheat then look at all
[2:11:20] like this but there's been times where I
[2:11:23] planted corn and I got so anxious for
[2:11:27] corn for a ripen grain and I would see
[2:11:31] it out there man I had this beautiful
[2:11:33] husk I had call it shuck had the tassels
[2:11:36] hanging out of it it looks right and I'd
[2:11:38] pull it back only to
[2:11:40] find no
[2:11:43] grain it hadn't
[2:11:46] ripened you see it was so close it
[2:11:50] deceived me
[2:11:54] and at this point brother brandom's
[2:11:56] looking at this church and he says
[2:12:00] Ah it's look what he said it's bringing
[2:12:04] back the fullness of the power of
[2:12:06] Pentecost it's the restoration of the
[2:12:09] same kind of
[2:12:10] grain this is what he thought it
[2:12:14] was do you realize it is not until the
[2:12:17] seals are open that he begins to
[2:12:19] understand there's a shut a husk a a
[2:12:21] chath that he hadn't even
[2:12:27] considered do you know there was a
[2:12:29] prophet in the days of of called Isaac
[2:12:33] got
[2:12:34] deceived by his own
[2:12:38] son come on Amen prophets can can
[2:12:42] misunderstand they can they can look and
[2:12:44] they think this is what I think it is
[2:12:46] and it
[2:12:48] isn't watch now so he comes in the
[2:12:51] Rapture message and he says that corn of
[2:12:54] wheat fell in the ground and died under
[2:12:57] the Dark Age persecution it went the
[2:12:59] ground it had to
[2:13:01] die any man's spirit will going see that
[2:13:04] unless that seed dies and rot it abides
[2:13:07] alone and it had to go in the ground
[2:13:08] under the dark AGS and laid there rotted
[2:13:11] and it come forth two little blades of
[2:13:13] the Lutheran Church and now the Lutheran
[2:13:15] Church brought forth more blades and
[2:13:16] swingly and and from there come on up
[2:13:19] the tsel which was John West ly the
[2:13:21] great missionary age you see pollination
[2:13:24] age and it dropped back and and out of
[2:13:26] there come a deceiving age that
[2:13:28] Pentecostal age anybody El here ever
[2:13:31] raise any Wheat you look and you you
[2:13:32] look at that wheat and you when you look
[2:13:35] at it you go out there and say I got
[2:13:37] wheat and you look like you got wheat
[2:13:40] there open it up real close and watch
[2:13:42] you hadn't got any Wheat at all you got
[2:13:45] a shot didn't Jesus warn us that in
[2:13:48] Matthew 24:24 in the last day the two
[2:13:51] Spirits would be so close together it
[2:13:53] would deceive the elected it wheat
[2:13:56] itself it was possible see now watch
[2:13:59] it's a car but wait wait brother Tim you
[2:14:01] said they were bride and they
[2:14:04] were but when it comes to ripening time
[2:14:07] all of the wheat plant
[2:14:10] dies and there's no life in them and the
[2:14:14] only one goes in the Garner is the wheat
[2:14:17] the only one goes in the Rapture is the
[2:14:19] original Gra the all the rest of them
[2:14:22] are left behind for the
[2:14:29] tribulation so the Shu the chaff is a
[2:14:32] twin to the grain started out looking
[2:14:34] like a grain with signs and wonders and
[2:14:37] but it lacked the full
[2:14:39] word the word the grain will have the
[2:14:42] word and power you see this is a job of
[2:14:45] the Forerunner remember even as John the
[2:14:48] Baptist forun the first coming of Christ
[2:14:50] we had to have a forerunner to forerun
[2:14:52] the second coming of Christ that's why
[2:14:55] God sent an Elijah prophet in this day
[2:14:58] to forerun his coming to prepare the way
[2:15:01] for the come of the Lord if not we'd all
[2:15:03] be in the and Harlot
[2:15:06] system so there had to be a message
[2:15:08] saying come
[2:15:10] out now watch Matthew 3:11 he said John
[2:15:14] says I will baptize you with water unto
[2:15:18] repentance but he that cometh after me
[2:15:21] is mightier than I whose shoes I not
[2:15:24] worthy to Bear he shall baptize you with
[2:15:26] the Holy Ghost and with fire whose fan
[2:15:30] is in his hand he will purly thoroughly
[2:15:33] Purge his floor he will gather his wheat
[2:15:35] into the Garner but he will burn the
[2:15:37] chaff with unquenchable
[2:15:40] fire who in the world was the chaff in
[2:15:43] that day it was Disciples of
[2:15:46] Moses it was scribes and Pharisees and
[2:15:49] the religious men of that day
[2:15:52] come on and they were left behind come
[2:15:56] on they were left behind and what
[2:16:00] happened to them they went through 2,000
[2:16:02] years of tribulation until we've had the
[2:16:05] tribulations of those days shall never
[2:16:07] be the Bible said never again will a
[2:16:09] people be persecuted like that for so
[2:16:11] many years you see their tribulation
[2:16:14] period is not three and A2 years it it's
[2:16:16] 2,000
[2:16:18] years where they've been aund persecuted
[2:16:21] group scattered everywhere all through
[2:16:24] Europe Asia everywhere across the globe
[2:16:27] America South America
[2:16:30] everywhere but the same God that said to
[2:16:33] us come out also said to them come out
[2:16:37] that's right and now they're back in
[2:16:39] their Homeland as a sign that we must be
[2:16:43] in our homeland the
[2:16:47] Bible somebody with me now following
[2:16:52] now let's just look at it here's your
[2:16:55] grain with the
[2:16:56] husk you see the very center there is a
[2:17:00] grain with no
[2:17:01] husk the other has the husk or the
[2:17:05] chaff and the and and John said he will
[2:17:09] burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire
[2:17:13] now I'm not saying all of them are going
[2:17:15] to be lost cu the tribulation will be
[2:17:17] where the church is purged through the
[2:17:20] tribulation but the bride escapes that
[2:17:23] and is raptured up because she is this
[2:17:27] grain but if you look there it insed or
[2:17:30] protected the grain it allowed the grain
[2:17:33] to be born out of that so being born out
[2:17:36] of the isusa movement would become a
[2:17:40] word
[2:17:47] bride now she will leave the sh
[2:17:51] why cuz it's dead so well everything's
[2:17:54] dead there no there's one thing there
[2:17:56] you can see that's not
[2:17:58] dead that's the
[2:18:01] Grain and the life is sealed into
[2:18:08] it you see
[2:18:11] R won't get it come on Amen it's listen
[2:18:17] Church once it's sealed in the devil is
[2:18:20] sealed out
[2:18:22] amen she is predestined this grain is
[2:18:25] predestined for a Rapture to go into the
[2:18:29] Garner the
[2:18:33] barn
[2:18:35] now but even as brother brandom says
[2:18:38] that he realizes we're going beyond that
[2:18:41] he said now in this age we're in now the
[2:18:43] living this age it's beyond
[2:18:48] Pentecost so he realizes that though
[2:18:51] he's seeing this he says now we're
[2:18:53] coming to an age because Pentecost has
[2:18:56] settled itself in organization and
[2:18:58] started faking a whole lot about
[2:19:01] organizations we are this and we are
[2:19:03] that and that's just nature you can't
[2:19:05] help it it's nature they'll do that it's
[2:19:07] a plan for them to do that but the
[2:19:09] church has moved on it's gone into
[2:19:12] greater and more powerful it's the
[2:19:13] restoration of gifts and many
[2:19:15] Pentecostal people don't believe in
[2:19:17] Divine Healing Ministry of angels and
[2:19:19] powers of God many Pentecost C these
[2:19:22] Visions I see the devil many
[2:19:24] organizations won't have nothing to do
[2:19:25] with it in Pentecost see we moved beyond
[2:19:28] that just as Methodist called
[2:19:31] Pentecostal
[2:19:32] crazy many
[2:19:35] Pentecostals let's see called for
[2:19:37] speaking in tongues just just as
[2:19:39] Lutheran called Methodist crazy for
[2:19:41] shouting but it's all coming forth of
[2:19:45] the Holy Spirit till the great church is
[2:19:47] being filled up and CH full Hallelujah
[2:19:51] of the great powers of almighty God
[2:19:53] until it's got to a place where the very
[2:19:56] works that Jesus done has manifest
[2:20:00] itself right in the church now we're
[2:20:03] close
[2:20:05] friends see where we're
[2:20:07] at you see this bride she is the
[2:20:11] resurrection and the
[2:20:13] life now I'm going to get a few more
[2:20:15] points before we close this morning
[2:20:18] because I'm not leaving without it
[2:20:22] you see the same holy spirit that saved
[2:20:26] the lutherans that Sanctified the
[2:20:29] Methodist that baptized the Pentecostal
[2:20:33] is Now setting in order the coming of
[2:20:35] the Lord Jesus when it will be so
[2:20:40] powerful that body will come into this
[2:20:43] group of church that will draw the rest
[2:20:46] of them from the grave there will be a
[2:20:49] resurrection that's what the the Holy
[2:20:51] Ghost is
[2:20:52] far hallelujah what is the Holy Ghost
[2:20:55] without us they cannot be made perfect
[2:20:57] when the enemy comes in like a flood the
[2:20:59] spirit of God will raise up a standard
[2:21:01] against it and we're in a day now back
[2:21:05] there um there wasn't half as smart as
[2:21:08] today they couldn't make an atomic bomb
[2:21:10] or an automobile they didn't have
[2:21:12] science and things as we have now all
[2:21:14] things and mysterious things to try to
[2:21:16] say man blow together some by some dust
[2:21:19] and so forth and take some analysis and
[2:21:22] try to prove it to make infidels out of
[2:21:24] people but now when we need it the
[2:21:27] spirit of God raises a standard what is
[2:21:29] it he's poured in his spirit and those
[2:21:32] who are resting out y in the grave or
[2:21:35] under the alter of God as the scriptures
[2:21:38] said are crying how long Lord how long
[2:21:41] how much longer God is waiting on you
[2:21:45] and me and the church is waiting on me
[2:21:48] and you adoption time
[2:21:51] when God can pour into us his fullness
[2:21:54] his power his resurrection then when the
[2:21:56] church in Christ comes so close together
[2:21:59] till Christ becomes visible Among Us and
[2:22:01] raises the dead and we'll go in the
[2:22:05] Rapture hallelujah
[2:22:08] hallelujah amen what's now I'm going to
[2:22:11] bring out just a few more of these where
[2:22:13] she becomes the voice of the
[2:22:16] Resurrection notice so the Holy Spirit
[2:22:18] has been moving
[2:22:20] there was just a little breath of it
[2:22:22] with Luther a little BL blow of it with
[2:22:25] Wesley a little deeper blow of it with
[2:22:28] Pentecost now the breath and the spirit
[2:22:30] has become the same and she's uniting
[2:22:33] together bringing forth that same
[2:22:35] powerful blow of the Holy Ghost that he
[2:22:38] did back there is manifesting the same
[2:22:40] works that he did back there is being
[2:22:42] manifested right today the same
[2:22:45] thing amen watch Jesus said verily
[2:22:48] verily I say unto you the son can do
[2:22:50] nothing except he sees the father doing
[2:22:52] it first what the father does he shows
[2:22:54] the son the father dwelleth in me he
[2:22:56] doeth The Works amen again in Elijah in
[2:23:00] the meal offering brother Bram says this
[2:23:03] that that during the day of Luther we
[2:23:05] live by justification during the days of
[2:23:07] Wesley we live by sanctification the
[2:23:10] church come in the minority in the days
[2:23:12] of Pentecost we live down through the
[2:23:15] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[2:23:17] restoration of the gifts now we're
[2:23:18] really in the minority the coming of the
[2:23:21] Son of God and here they believe by
[2:23:23] faith here they shouted under
[2:23:25] sanctification here they spoke in
[2:23:27] tongues as a gift but now the negative
[2:23:30] and the positive and the cap is coming
[2:23:32] on the pyramid and it's the end time
[2:23:35] when the Christ in his church will be so
[2:23:38] much alike till he's going to call the
[2:23:41] Dead from the Methodist Lutheran and all
[2:23:44] those back there and there will be a
[2:23:45] resurrection then that fell asleep in
[2:23:47] the first second third fourth sixth
[2:23:49] fifth six six seventh watch we'll rise
[2:23:52] one of these days to meet Jesus in the
[2:23:54] skies the hour has arrived friends the

[2:24:15] Resurrection he says this and Jesus is
[2:24:18] so close to coming to Earth until now
[2:24:21] until his power has began to catch the
[2:24:24] people and winding them up and getting
[2:24:26] them ready for the bride getting them
[2:24:28] ready to be caught up in the Rapture a
[2:24:30] church that are just fit just exactly to

[2:24:42] earth Jesus is
[2:24:44] coming Hallelujah as my hand against the
[2:24:48] wall would make a Shadow and the shadow
[2:24:49] is deeper deeper and deeper and closer
[2:24:52] as my hand gets and after a while the
[2:24:54] shadow of my hand becomes one and the
[2:24:56] church started in Martin Luther's time
[2:24:58] under justification on the wesle through
[2:25:00] sanctification and now in the baptism of
[2:25:03] the Holy Ghost with the Pentecostals and
[2:25:05] the restoration of G and out of that

[2:27:26] here we're in the last
[2:27:29] age we're not going
[2:27:31] down we're going
[2:27:35] up remember even on the day of Pentecost
[2:27:39] they were going
[2:27:42] down they
[2:27:44] deteriorated as a seed
[2:27:48] planted they went down into the
[2:27:51] ground and instead of coming back Jesus
[2:27:54] Took on the role of
[2:27:56] intercessor and started intercessing on
[2:27:58] behalf of ignorant because the further
[2:28:00] we got along the more ignorant we become
[2:28:02] of God's
[2:28:03] word and so he began to intercede and
[2:28:07] that's what he's been doing for these
[2:28:08] 2,000 years but friends he's about to
[2:28:12] rise from that
[2:28:14] Throne Hallelujah and when he does he's
