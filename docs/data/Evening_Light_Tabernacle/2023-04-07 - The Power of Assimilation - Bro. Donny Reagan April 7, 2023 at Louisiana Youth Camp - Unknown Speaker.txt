I asked brother Timothy if he would sing that song tonight for a reason because we will refer back to it on the basis of where we're going to read this scripture from then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in gilgal and Caleb the son of jefani the kennesite said unto him thou knowest the thing that the Lord said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in kadeshbarnia 40 years old was I when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from kadishbarnia to aspile the land and I brought him word again as it was in my heart nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt now once you listen to this verse now so there were two reports coming about the exact same place to reports now if you and I will revert back in time we're not standing here tonight in April of 2023. but we're standing back there at kadishbarnia we have heard 10 preachers come up was a bad report and there's only two that say in or more than able to take the land it's ours we can do it it's ours so you're the people now so whose report will you believe nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt now it would have been one thing had it been the Philistines the amorites the Hittites the jebusites those Seven Nations that God sent them to conquer if it would have been them that would have said these things but instead of it being them it was their own message Brothers oh boy here we go and by doing that they made the hearts of the people just to melt but I wholly followed the Lord my God and Moses swear on that day saying surely the land we're on thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance and thy children's forever because I want you to notice why it's going to be his because God loved him more not because she combed his hair on the right side of his head but because thou has followed the Lord my God and it amazing Caleb the verse before that caused the Lord his God why he heard the prophet say the same thing so now the prophet told him he said you serve the Lord with all of your heart the Lord my God so Caleb said I like that I think I'll call him my God so it just goes ahead and said he wasn't just Moses god he's my God a lot of us can say he was brother branham's God that ain't good enough God wants you to be able to say he's my God he's your God behold now behold the Lord has kept me alive as he said these 40 and five years since the Lord spoke this word unto Moses while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness and now lo I am this day four score and five years old 85. years old so instead of looking for a nursing home he's wanting a land full of giants That's My Kind Of Man right there instead of wanting a little flower garden or a nice little spot in a peaceful side of Palestine that has already been settled and he'll plant a little bit of broccoli and a little bit of asparagus and he'll go out there and spend the rest of his days him and their wives on the front porch on a rocking chair peacefully rocking sleeping in and out during the day but he says I want you to know I'm just as strong now as I was 40 years ago now he stands 85. years old let's pray together Lord Jesus we love you so much we thank you that this word is not just for young people but it's for 85 year olds 45 year olds 65 year olds 105 if there's any of that age here tonight we are so grateful father that your word never fails we ask you that you'd speak to us tonight help me to get out of the way make me sensitive Lord maybe a young person might not need but one or two words or maybe a sentence help me not to be restricted to notes or quotes or scriptures help me father to follow the channel of the Holy Ghost speak to us tonight with you Lord in Jesus name and the Saints said God bless you you may be seated I want to speak to you tonight by the help of the Lord on the power of assimilation most of us I'm sure know what assimilation means but I'll refresh your memory it happens to you every day when you eat your body will take the nutrients out of the food that you eat and it will divide it the body's a miraculous saying it'll separate carbs and protein and fats and all this and that and the other and sends it to the different parts of the body to be able to make it useful and then it will assimilate your cells are so designed by the Creator that they're able to retain proteins and fats and carbohydrates and vitamins and so on but yet that's not just so in our bodies listen to the word now what it means to assimilate to take in and incorporate as one's own to absorb to bring into conformity with the customs and attitudes of others and it also means to cause to resemble so assimilation is something that we do every day it is something that we have to be so careful about because the music you listen to the entertainment that you allow yourself to become involved in the people that you are around that you fellowship with that you spend time with we will assimilate from them certain things that's what makes us what we are our parents our our family our neighbors and those that we are around and we pick up this and that and the other and we're able to assimilate from them we pull it into our mannerisms and there's many of these things that are actually stored and our subconscious we don't even realize it you can watch family members and there's a certain trait that they will do maybe they have a certain life and you can watch one and the other and the other and they're not even aware aware of what they're doing because that's stored in their subconscious God made a great thing when they made a human being and he put several of the controlled units of us in the conscience level and then he put other things in the subconscious level I'm glad he did that because if he didn't whenever you and I went to sleep at night we would die in our sleep because our heart wouldn't keep beating our lungs would not keep expanding and going down and all that much of our mechanism of our human body God applied to the subconscious so it goes on every day you don't have to think about it you don't have to tear your heart to beat you don't have to tell all these things to do God committed that to the subconscious and that other things God committed it to the first concert you ever notice how that whenever you get used to say in your home if your home has a level two or three levels in your home and you've got eight or ten steps 12 whatever you have and you will go up up and down those steps and you just go up and down them up and down you don't even think about it and you will have no problem doing that until you start looking at those steps one day and thinking about either going up or down have you ever done that and whenever you will do that it will nearly every time confuse you and you're saying why in the world well I went up and down these steps for years of my life why am I doing this well I almost stumbled I almost fell well the thing is that you've taken from your subconscience the control that was committed to that and you're thinking about it in your first conscience and when you do then it confuses between the two levels and you see that's the way faith is sometimes that brother Brandon says about the Lord Jesus that he was totally unconscious of his face so you never find the Lord Jesus saying oh have I got enough Faith to do this can I do that and many times we want things so bad that we try not to reach for it in our conscience level and we pull it from the subconscious and the soul and then we set up a great battle going on where most of the time inside of our mind but we do assimilate and it can be so in a positive way but also in a negative way now before we go into the inheritance of Caleb hear our character tonight I'd like to give you just a little bit of a background maybe some of you know it maybe some night won't hurt you if you do know what to hear about it again but the Bible identifies Caleb as being a kennesite which I find very unusual that it does not call him an Israelite but it calls him a kennesite so he's of the tribe of kennes k-e-n-a-z which are of the descendants of Edom or the so actually Caleb was not a Jew but he was more of what we would classify as being a gentile before The Exodus coming out of the land of Egypt Caleb's father actually married a woman which was the daughter of her which was of the descendants of Moses now she was of the clan of chalubaya and the tribe of Judah now there were many Gentiles that merged from the Gentile nations of course to come into the Jews and some of them did so by marriage as this one did and others of them did so by accepting the Jewish faith so this man was brought into the clan or the tribe of Israel by marriage so his father married a Jewish woman and he was brought in into the tribes of Israel and he become a convert now the Jews did not have a 13th tribe for those who were converted from Gentiles to becoming Jews but what they did was us they themselves become assimilated into the tribes so they did not have say a said tribe for the Gentiles one for this that the other but they were assimilated into the tribes of Israel and they would become that now let me just remind you of a couple of other characters and one of them you're familiar with of course and that was Rahab Rahab brother Ron mentioned it this morning Rahab was an Amorite now she was not of course an Israelite but she was an Amorite Rahab the Harlot ruse was a moabitus and so we see a similarity at how that these people both Rahab and ruse were assimilated into what tribe the tribe of Judah and what tribe was Caleb assimilated into the tribe of Judah now Judah of course means praise so that's a real good tribe for the Gentiles to be assimilated into because if anybody's going to praise him for Grace it's going to be those of the tribe of Judah now maybe some of you here tonight you ain't got much to praise him for but I was born lost I was born blind I was born wretched I was born miserable I've got a lot to thank him for tonight now I want you to notice then that these three many more but these three that I want to focus on they were actually assimilated into the tribe of Judah which was identified as the king tribe or the Royal tribe it was of course the tribe by which our Lord in his flesh preceded and came forth from so Caleb then was given a special place now which again would be quite unusual because you have a man that was not really a Jew but yet called by Moses to be able to go and check out the promised land and him and Joshua will come back with a real great report of what the Lord had given them and then here were people that were Jews who said they'd been in the message for all their life and yet they come back with a report that we're not able to do this there's absolutely no way that we can go into this land you know it breaks my heart to not to say it but there are people in this message that are of the same frame of mind that we cannot have Revival in this end time that we cannot expect God to move for us and where do we get all that at now tell you what they do they go into our land which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost baptizing us into the message of the hour that is our land and let me just tell you the message is more than just you learning how to quote something that brother Branham said but the message itself and whenever we catch it it is the revelation of the hour it is more than quotes it's more than just books and tapes laying in yourself or having it on your phone it is more than just something to where we talk about it is a reality it is your land for this hour this is why in the last several years that Satan is so attacked our lamb what's he trying to do exactly the same thing that he done to these people in that day get them to question The credibility of the prophet of God who told them about the land and they will become so discouraged they won't even go into the land well praise the Lord but you realize that Caleb was of the mindset he was not going to join sides with anyone who stood against his Prophet messenger it would do you and I good to have the same attitude today but you see Caleb had already assimilated into the people of God but not just with anybody that said they believed the word so Caleb had assimilated into those Believers which had a portion ordained on the other side now we realized everybody that was Israel actually wasn't Israel and everybody that started out did not wind up going in and we know Redemption has two parts the first part is coming out of and the second part is going into and Caleb had a made-up mind he was going in is there anybody here tonight that's got that same mind now Caleb must have experienced a lot of difficult things now we know of course that God tells them because you have brought this evil report there will be none of you none of you that will go into the land except Caleb now the word Caleb I'm sure you know means dog so here this man his Birthright was against him his name was against him he was a kennesite which was against him but yet he had accepted the power of assimilation to be able to assimilate into the message of the hour and I should become the word for that day now all these things were against him as I said last night these were facts that were against him but all he knew was God was calling him to a destiny Beyond his own natural birth I hope you realize the same thing tonight but you know that even though that he believed this it did not mean that that it took all the difficulty away from him now let's look at this that God has told him because you have denied me you've denied my words you have questioned the message of the hour you have questioned my prophet's credibility then there won't be a one of you and we know that the Bible says said that when they heard those ten spies they went into their tents that night and they wept and they cried and they said what the God we would have stayed in the land of Egypt was it because there was no graves in the wilderness why did you bring us out of here oh they had a fit and it come by what 10 message preachers that was telling them the days of Miracles are passed and all we can do now in the message is just barely hang on and just barely struggle to survive and we're gonna wait we're waiting and we're waiting and we're waiting we're not sure what we're waiting for I guess it depends on which preacher you talk to well some say we're waiting for Brother Brown to come and bring a temp others said what no he ain't going to bring no tent we're waiting for this man to come from over here am I waiting for that man to come over there well while you're waiting we're going to be rejoicing in the Lord we're going to be enjoying the promise of our God that he is the same yesterday today and forever but I want you to say now that there must be a span of time that will pass and all of those who accepted the negative report of them ten preachers has got to die because she remember reading in the Bible that God would let one plague out to another come and one thing I to another and Caleb saw thousands times thousands of his people die in the wilderness how discouraging it must have been but remember God give this man a twofold promise and that was the longevity of life he is not going to die and God also gave him the promise that he was going to get the land that he had marched upon and claimed as his own now you imagine every time the flu come around and every time covet got in among the camp that the devil said don't Caleb boy you ain't gonna make it this time I imagine he might have got pneumonia and he might have got this and that and the other but you know what Caleb said I've got a promise God said I ain't going to die I don't care what the devil died I don't care what the devil said let me just tell you something it all depends upon your perspective of the promise of God if you believe in all the stats may be against you all of everything else may be against him but if it's been revealed to you by the holy ghost that you are part of this bride there ain't enough Devils out of hell to stop you from getting your inheritance now Taylor but had there been a pretty strong individual to see all of the people in his age group pretty much die so thousands would die on the left and thousands would die on the right now again we're not talking about amalekites and jebusites and Hittites but we're talking about Israelites and they are dying like flies but God told him you ain't going to die you ain't gonna die so God sustained him during the difficult time look around what many of us have seen my brother Tim being here and some of these older folks they've been in the message many of them for decades of their life um now this this year holds a special year for me because in March the 27th of 1983 I just started a church in Kentucky and I introduced about the prophet messenger being uh the messenger of this age March the 27 1983. I was the Pentecostal preacher preaching in my Pentecostal church when I'd started there and I got up and the Lord had began to deal with me and revealed to me that he had sent a prophet in the last days so just a few weeks ago a few days ago 40 years I've been preaching this message 40 years I've seen all kinds of people come and go brother Tim seen way more than I have some of you here tonight have seen way more than I have but yet that does not change the credit ability of the message of the hour we've had people come and go to believe the sign the this that the other the truth of it is we still do believe the sign come on now we still believe that this word has been sent to gather a bride not call us to make another denomination but call us to the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and introduce us to the Lord Jesus Christ as the Living God which is the same yesterday today and forever we've seen them fall to our left we've seen them fall to our right we've seen preachers fall in adultery we've seen personalities raise and fall we've seen men raised with false Doctrine and send them around the world and cause a cult here and another clan there but is it going to move us absolutely not Caleb's all family members die he saw friends die but did it stop him he kept his eyes on the promise somebody hear me tonight he kept his eyes on the promise Hallelujah he lived upon it he sought upon it he breathed this word he talked about this word he assimilated this word now remember he didn't have a Bible he didn't have 1100 tapes to listen to he didn't have a whole lot of people of his age to encourage him but he had a word a direct word from the mouth of a prophet of God that you are not going to die but you are going to inherit that land maybe one year went by the second year went by it didn't happen the third year went by you'll imagine 40 years later he's still standing on the same promise of God he's all right he's 85 years old now maybe he don't look like he can get around and the people probably saw a poor guy you know he's just missing a little something he's ready for retirement you know I used to kind of laugh at folks on the talk about retirement but I've heard it said be nice to your children because they picked the nursing home you move into when you get older I tell you whatever it began to realize that you imagine that Caleb now 85 years old and standing up there that day and said let me tell you something Joshua I'm just as able today to go in and come back out I'm ready to fight don't you talk about retirement to me don't you talk about some nursing home and some Assisted Living Place Caleb said I don't need no Assisted Living place what I need is my Mountain I want my Mountain it's not my name wrote on it and I ain't talking about no Assisted Living I'm talking about no nursing home I'm talking about give me my mountain Otis in Joshua 14 7 40 years old was I when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from kadishbarnia to a spy out the land and I brought him word again as it was in my heart I want you to notice where the word was wasn't in his head Malachi 4 is not a head message God didn't say I'll send Elijah to turn your head I'll send him to sin to turn your hearts that's what a lot of the folks have got though they got the message up here but the show ain't got it down here now his life is built upon faith in the Divine Promises of God and I want you to listen to this now carefully they were nourished and nurtured by installments of fulfillment now listen they were nourished and nurtured by installments of fulfillment you see God never gave it all to him the strength that he needed just at one time but God gave him installments or payments you see every day Glory every day was an installment of the Fulfillment of the prophet's promise every day brother Ron God gave him was another payment to the promise you're not going to die now it wasn't like that he just stood there and looked at it for it to all come way down here at the end but every day Caleb lived God gave him a payment on the promise and every time somebody is healed in our midst it is a payment toward the Rapture every time we see a miracle it is a payment toward the Rapture every time somebody gets hands laid on them and the spirit of God touches their body it is an evidence that the power that will change our bodies is already changing us from being sick to being well it is an installment toward the Fulfillment oh praise the Lord so Caleb is receiving installments of Filth form fulfillment rather every day all along the road so the two promises are longevity of life and he will be able to walk into this blessed land now once you notice how God will do it sometimes even even for your children the daily fulfillment of the one fed the fire of his face to the other so the daily fulfillment of getting up every day just rolling out of bed him getting up every day said praise God this day this promise is fulfilled why God promised him you're not going to die so we wait for sometimes great big miracles to happen weeks on down the road but every day you're up it's another day of fulfillment of the run every day that you're able to stand there and have Victory it's another day to roll out of bed and say all right devil where are you where are you devil I have lived to another night my God kept his word my God has moved for me another day I've been given the servant so the daily fulfillment of the longevity of his life fed the fire of his face that he's going to get his Mountain praise God notice this in verse 8. nevertheless my brethren that went up made the heart of the people Mel but a holy followed the Lord my God I didn't join up with him when they said well all we can do is just kind of sit around and wait now wait wait there's no way we can have no move now we know there's some of them Pentecostal preachers around the message of course people don't call me Pentecost they call me Church of Christ yeah I'd rather be called a Pentecost on this message than call the Church of Christ I'm not a bit ashamed I've been called a Pentecostal since I come in this message I'm not a bit ashamed to say I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's a matter of fact I hear your prophecy and marriage of the lamb in Phoenix 1962. he said many Pentecostal people are ashamed of their Pentecostal experience well you're looking at one tonight that is not a shame to his Pentecostal experience I got more that are raising my hands I got more than I accept process my savior something got down inside of me and got a hold to my soul and regenerated me by the breaths of God hallelujah I have never been the same and I'm telling you he's not here tonight to do the same thing for you if you want it so imagine okay let me know he's 85 . be careful don't hurt yourself everybody you know but now he had he's AARP cards stuck in this pocket and his Medicare stuck in that pocket United Healthcare card stuck over here notice verse 10. the Lord has Captain me alive daily installments was now leading him to the time of fulfillment to the ultimate goal praise God some of y'all looking for miracles you're alive another day aren't you you've lived another week in laodicea young people you've lived another day in laodicea you understand we're getting fewer and fewer the whole world has gone insane they don't know if they're a boy or a girl they don't even know what they are they've gone out of their minds our governments don't know what they are everybody's turned into a jellyfish they're afraid to say he or her or she or him they're afraid our Army's afraid I weak precedence afraid why because our nation has been turned into hell that you are a miracle in this place tonight you know who you are you know where you're going you know what God has done for you you have received another payment today of lies of Mercy Hallelujah the Lord has kept me alive as he said these 40 and five years even since the Lord spake this word unto Moses while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness and now lo I am this day four scoring five years old I am as strong hey as I was in the day that Moses sent me you imagine somebody with her pole Fowler bless his heart it's just an old man you know just just kind of go along with him he don't know no better poor brother Tim he's getting old oh he is Amy that's his little heart look at brother Ron how great it is oh my goodness look at brother Donnie how great he said these old pictures they're just getting so old oh yeah that's easy for them to say they've done lived their life and how did they live it they're Jesus Christ they wasn't out there in the world running up and down and living like the world oh no they give their teams many of these preachers around the message I give their teams and their 20s I know 30s I know 40s I have no 60s and their 60s to the cause of Jesus Christ and that's why we can stand here tonight and tell you it is a life worth living I do not regret giving my youth to Jesus Christ because he will give me my use back one day Eternal you [Applause] imagine some of them young guys sinners in now watch him he gets a little excited you imagine okay Hallelujah I feel it all over me it Buffs that life it'll knock your life into me but what is that I hear what is that kill your sound it's coming over from that direction isn't it people said what is that noise don't pay no attention to it it's Caleb he's in their sharpen and his sword they tell me 40 years ago that man had a sword four foot long you sharpened it down now to it's about 18 and a half inches long and still coming down but Caleb done realize it don't matter whatever is how long it is what matters is how sharp it is how deep you are how famous you are how important you think you are that you want a shot too much inside that'll cut that devil's head off [Applause] [Applause] he said I am as strong this day as I was in the day when Moses sent me 85 years old now you expect me to believe that an 85 year old man it's a strong as a 40 year old man I'm not even 85 and I know better than that this man is not looking at natural circumstances the facts had certainly stacked up against him the young people some of these young guys bless his heart I admire his courage don't you man bless his heart Uncle Caleb tell us what was it like I'll tell one thing boys I went over there glory to God I marched down through there I grabbed a hold of them grapes I mean Them Grapes as that big around I'll tell you one thing I got in there in the presence of God I went down through there and I watched them through all them people and I thought Lord have mercy I can't wait to take my knife and cut their gizzard out I can't wait to get in there and take this land this might have come down Uncle Caleb calm down you're gonna hurt yourself so here he is that before Joshua can you imagine Joshua Naughton coupled the Deacons if he gets excited Brothers help him [Music] I watch him the day that Moses sent me ask my strength was then even so is my strength now for gardening for flowers for Bingo I will go to the senior citizens place and sit around and talk to the old folks you ever notice some people get really old how that they go to talking about things that was so many many years ago and talk about things they did all these spiritually everyone quiet I remember this and I remember that and that amazing Caleb is not talking about what was he's talking about what he is he's talking about what it and what God is fixing to do all he needs is Joshua's permission [Applause] this man still knew Divine protocol the prophet of God said that mountain was his why does he need Joshua's permission because Joshua was a man God placed in charge he said notice even so is my strength now for war him and the senior citizen voice is going to get into a checker War I guess imagine some of them young guys bless his heart we'll have to do something with him I mean whenever we get ready going and will I strap that dude in the bed he'll get killed this man is dangerous you're right he is dangerous all right and I'll tell you who is dangerous for the sons of the anakins the inanigans were the Giants who lived in the Southland in the land of Hebron the word a nanticum means long neck you imagine oh Kayla but have him dreams come to himself he said what are you doing why are you doing he said I swear to another one's neck tonight in my dreams oh they're most sons of the long neck well I'll tell you one thing our battle is to change some a little bit now I guess but now we're dealing with sons of the long tongue that long tongue lying devil that tells you you cannot be an overcomer that you cannot be filled with a holy ghost that we cannot have a bride's Revival oh yes we can we can't have a bride's Revival a bride's move we'll cut that long tongue out of their mouth you imagine it was like Oh Glory I can't feel it all over me right now he'd be back on his tent lifting their Malachi four weights let me give you a few of them Delight thou self also in the Lord and He will give Thee the desires of thy Lord if he abide me and my words abide in you ask what you will hitherto you have asked nothing in my name but ask now that your joy may be fulfilled if any two on Earth agree is touching any one thing it shall be given unto them whatever you bind on Earth I'll bind in heaven whatever you loose on Earth that's the kind of waste we want to live brother sister until we assimilate into those promises we eat them we sleep and we drink them we dream about them oh oh my they probably had a Caleb committee our little brothers how they gonna take care of this guy let me ask you Deacon brother something how about you like to have an 85 year old like this in your church I've said before the Lord knew exactly where to put David he placed him in the Old Testament because if the Lord would allow David to live in this message in this day every Church on the message were to throw them out that man would have got so excited he didn't even have the Holy Ghost and he shouted and he danced and he jumped around what would he do if he'd heard about the Seven Seals what would David done if he'd heard about the seven churches at Malachi 4 and Luke 17 30. what would he had done if he had heard about a bride's Revival oh what are you gonna do [Applause] Caleb plays the foundation for his claim you know I find it amazing that God's prophet telling people when they're coming up to a prayer line to be prayed for and they need healing and deliverance to the body and he would tell them tell God why you want to be healed what does sickness do pull you away from your position I tell the Lord and have for several years now Lord Erica needs to be healed so she can be the right kind of wife the right kind of mother the right kind of daughter the right kind of daughter of God she wants to go to church Lord and she can't go to church that Devil's grabbed a hold of her she was called in the line of duty her doctor told her there's no need why you should even have this she has one of the rarest types into endocrine tumor one of the rarest type that there is in the world and yet all nobody's ever been healed as far as what they say but I think it'd be pretty awesome if hers is the first one on the list Our God can do it brother sister oh Hallelujah your name can be the first one on the list that got delivered of this and that and the other do you watch your Mountain [Applause] but it can be pretty hard when you're sitting in a doctor's office and they got a scan up on the wall this is your liver this is your brain this is your lungs and if we're not careful we'll get so accustomed to sickness and disease we start claiming it as our own pray for me my blood pressure is doing this my tumor you understand what you're doing you're claiming that as if though it belongs to you no that is a trespasser [Applause] Hallelujah [Applause] now listen he lays the foundation now he makes his request now therefore give me this mountain wherefore the Lord spake in that day and thought thou hardest in that day how the anakims were there and that the cities were great and fenced what's he quoting facts he didn't say about all there was no chance well there were no Giants I want you to look at them blind preachers that come out there 45 years prior to this and they said we will sought grasshoppers in our own sight and we were like grasshoppers in their side and I want to ask you something how did they know that did they go up and ask them that but they assimilated fear they assimilated into that fear and now they're speaking on behalf of their enemy the truth of it is every devil in hell is terrified right now in this presence of God every devil in hell is scared to death of every Holy Ghost Field child of God that's in this place tonight because the devil knows if we can move Beyond fear if we can move beyond the things of the flesh every devil in here will be subject to the Holy Ghost if we could get in one night and what a corn every person here could be free and less than five minutes time [Applause] the headaches were there cities will convinced fenced so be the Lord will be with me then I shall be able to drive them out as the Lord said now imagine maybe one of his caretakers come up and said hi brother Joshua brother Caleb is an overzealous Pentecostal sort of a brother we've never been able to calm him down glory to God we've never been able to get him down oh you can't even sing Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound without shouting the first thing they're going to make us out it'll be amazing grace how sweets us out you remember the old man that had the daughter that lived in the city the prophet tells us about and she was a real high society so she won't have this tea party or eliminated I think the prophet said there's going to drink that pink lemonade stick her fingers on up in the air and she said Lord what am I going to do with my daddy because every time he reads the Bible he gets so excited he goes to getting real emotional so she said I know what I'll do I'll put daddy up in the attic so she took daddy up there and she said now daddy we're going to have this party and hold honey that's fine yeah that's fine but then now she said I I don't want to give Daddy no Bible because if I do he could all tore up so here they was drinking their pink lemonade and their little cucumber sandwiches and all that sort of thing and my everything was going really nice and she left her daddy a geography a book about oceans and lands and so on and they was down there and one woman may have had a cucumber sandwich at another out of squash sandwich and who knows they might have been eating asparagus and all kinds of that sort of stuff and all of a sudden the office racking above their head takes off and she said what in the world I know who that is that's Daddy we need more daddies like that [Music] too many of our daddies have got their heads stuck in their smartphone it's a shame on our smartphones are smarter than we are she goes running up the steps Daddy Daddy what are you doing you ain't got nobody said that no honey I said you're reading in this geography book here and they said there's some places in the ocean to see they can't find nobody until she said yeah I know that Daddy said well I just read another day in the Bible how that the Lord had cast my sins into the depths of the sea and according to this right here they're still falling they're still falling hey the old man assimilated the word if God's inside of your heart you can see him in a geography [Applause] so you imagine some of the folks they put Portland up up in a chariot and they said let's let's just drive him by one of them assisted home living things just see what he thinks where are they going oh we're going out here how compatible going over here to see some of this this fine property in the land of Israel I said hebron's that way I know we know we know we know but we just want to show you some scenery today so here the comma said a lot of old folks walking around like yeah all kinds of things I said good Lord you don't expect me to live there do you that's the way I say you don't expect me to live still yeah you expect brother Tim to live there look I've got needs my babies God needs my brothers God needs don't take me somewhere where the spirit of God is not welcome take me somewhere where the Holy Ghost is moving [Applause] Uncle Kayla we just thought maybe with you been 85 and everything that you might want to calm our love you know just more sedated just kind of laid back let me tell you something young people Satan won't even care if you belong to a message Church the thing he don't want to happen to you is for you to meet the power of the Risen Savior he offered Jesus a kingdom without a Calvary he'll offer you a position in this message without a new birth he'll offer you a position a deacon to trust you maybe even a preacher a song leader or a musician the thing that scares him to death is when young people meet the Lord Jesus like they did on the day of Pentecost Peter ain't God one Holy Ghost and we got another one we got the same Holy Ghost Peter had we got the same rights as Peter had [Applause] well you see there's a little bit concerned about his mind because what he had done before Joshua was he asked for the very same land that those other 10 message preachers had saw and come back and said oh we saw the Giants there man you told me that big but it all depends on what you're looking at brother Tim brother Timothy some of us a few years ago went into Israel we was able to go down into the valley of elah amen we got out and walked up and down that Valley there picked up some rocks you said why'd you do that for because one of my kin folks had fought a battle there you don't know yet either but he's one of yours too David was his name Hallelujah you imagine Saul and his army looking at some of them them Giants and the Philistines okay let's look at the same things so whether you're a young boy which was a teenager or whether you're an 85 year old man it runs in our family to kill Giants Hallelujah if you're 16 of 15 or 80 or 85 if you're bothered with cancer if you're bother with high blood pressure if you're bothered with the besetting sin it runs in our family to slay Giants so they had known that something poor O Caleb is maybe it's pre-dementia it's probably all Hummers setting in on him he said why would you say that because he asked for the very land that men with sins and renowned and great sensibility said we should never go there and the poor old guy that's what he asked for we drove him by this new Assisted Living place and we told him that we would take care of him it would be able to come and visit him every now and then became I don't want that place wow I'm looking for a neck to slice oh come on young people don't look at me that way my goodness you ever wanted you all to be devil stomping next slice and tongue speaking Holy Ghost feel used in this last day that will not back up to the devil you'll look up to lust you're not back up to rock and roll music you're not back up to the sexual perverse society that we live in that you'll stay in short ground and say give me my mountain [Applause] ain't no need you trying to come to me and get me to join believe the sign no need you trying to come to me and tell me this message ain't right but brother Tony we can point it out facts that brother random said this number here and that number there you're looking at the facts but I'm looking at the truth he will seal the prophet sent from God he was a human being Oh Glory and you see one shot someone the children of Israel shall win the land the Southland crossed Jericho children Brethren took Jericho they go into the Southland Hebron was right there next to Jericho they run all the Giants out but they kept advancing North East and West now it's 45 years later them Giants simply left for a while and come back according to Joshua chapter 1 verse 12 verse 11 chapter 11 verse 22 if you'd like to read it so they move back in you see they had to spend years of clearance clear enemy then they had to change their tactics they spent the rest of their life keeping the enemy out the more they cleared it out so just because you're delivered to this and that don't mean oh praise God I got delivered Hallelujah you'll never bother me again oh no the devil's smarter than that he won't attack you maybe in front of these men of God that's going to pray for you tomorrow night but he'll wait till you get home on Tuesday and then that desire will come back to look at this or that or the other or to say this or die of the other but you've got to have your ground Caleb you've got to stand there with sword and hand and say come on devil come on devil I warn you in the name of Jesus I got something that that can't mean it that was more than emotion I got power our power you see the majority of those spies measure the Giants against their own strengths Caleb and Joshua measure the Giants against the strength of Jehovah brother Donnie will you attack that devil no way you say brother Ron wants to meet this devil on his own nobody in the right mind but want to meet the devil on his own but greater is here that is in you You are not alone when you get the Holy Ghost now look at verse 13. and Joshua blessed him amen and gave unto Caleb the son of jefani Hebron for an inheritance Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of jafani akinazite now the word has been claimed and the allotment has been assigned to the man who owns it and the Giants have not moved at all isn't it amazing Joshua's word when Joshua said okay it's yours it's yours Joshua's word did not drive the anakams off of the mountain I hope you're hearing me [Music] you see many of our people that those of us who do believe in prayer lives and we believe in prayer for the sick and we believe in people praying to things but many times people come through prayer lines and they come up people in their own service and they're praying that God will deliver them of something to the anointed men of God's hands one sometimes what you're praying for is going to have to be overcome by you and Jesus together not just the prayers of your pastor can go up every service pray for me I'll do this pray for me I'll do that pray for me I'll do that and some of us are just lazy Christians should you not going for prayer yes but when you've gone up for prayer then stand there and drag out your sword and say all right devil the man of God's prayed for me I believe God's word I'm not going back up there Wednesday night I'm not going back again Sunday morning for the same thing now I'm fixing to attack my Giant on the ground that's been given to me as a believer a pastor cannot fight my battles my mama cannot fight my battles I'm gonna stand out with sword drone and say come on devil can you imagine how Caleb must have felt so honored to been given the land of Hebron Hebron was the place at which Sarah Abraham's wife had died before there was Timeless kill Josh arba was the name of the place originally called Hebron renamed by the denominational titles and the name was restored under the restoration of the Bride coming back in Hallelujah it was formerly called Church of God it was formerly called Church of God in Christ his formerly called Apostolic this that and the other but your name's been restored back to what John the Baptist called you in the Book of John whenever it said the friend or the bridegroom rejoices because he hears the bridegroom's voice it was a man with the spirit of Elijah on him and he uses the word Bride for the first time in the New Testament well glory to God so a man with a spirit of Elijah on him talks about a bride getting her place and a man come back in the end time of the spirit of Elijah on him and said I no longer call you church I no longer call you church but I call you bro that's part of your Mountain I'm not no longer just church [Applause] Sarah dies Abraham purchase a field with a cave in it in the field Cave of Matt Pila the cave of two mouths two entrances the only possession Abraham ever actually owned in the land of Canaan when he was alive and he had a tidal deed to it and that title deed goes to Joshua praise God a man that was assimilated into the tribe Oh Glory it was the only piece of land that Abraham could say with this and it did amazing that God would give that to a man like this why he wholly followed the Lord with all of his heart look at how God honors this look at how God looks at this and God looks at this and so how it's not because our voice is so beautiful to sing it's not because we can do this or that but when we follow the Lord with all of our heart God absolutely loves that and Satan absolutely hates it here Abraham was buried Isaac was buried Jacob was buried Joseph was buried years later and Caleb winds up with it Caleb city became a city of Refuge brother Donnie you message preachers you mean you don't want the lost to come in we do well the way you all preacher sound like to me you don't want no homosexuals to come in oh no no no no no no you're misunderstanding that totally we want him to come in but we just don't want them to go out the same way they came here [Applause] since we relocated in our new building there's a woman heard about us and she started coming to church started wearing britches of course that's what she's used to well after a few services she noticed nobody else in the church women anyway was wine britches well she told one of the deacons she said well I figure y'all don't wear a pants here he said no ma'am she said well I'll tell you I've got a hard time with this makeup I'm an ugly woman and she said it may take me a little while but I believe I can give it up too now I'm stood up and preached on it but something about the Living Word setting in the pews begin to convince that woman's heart Oh Glory what was it the message that was being lived in the pews spoke to that woman's father and said this is not right oh that's what we want that we become the message [Applause] oh so Caleb City become a City of Refuge but it also become a city of the priesthood so they just didn't believe in tapes only well I figured I'd get quiet on that but that's all right the Lord God started out this gospel in the beginning in Acts 2 with preachers preaching the word if he wanted to he could have had tape recorders in the first century and they could have started playing Jesus tapes Peter's tapes Paul's tapes Apollo's tapes and then brought it right back around and ended it up with tapes but he started it out with preachers and apparently he started it out the way he wanted it and he will end it the way he started it I don't care who says different they're contrary to God's word God called men and he said preach preach praise the word I'll stop Devils heal the sick let me close Joshua 15 13. and unto Caleb the son of jeffani he gave part among the children of Judah not because he was one but natural genealogy but he was given apart you cannot imagine how I feel tonight to be given apart with some Ministry on this last day to be able to minister with the greatest men of God amen that are on this Earth today I counted such an honor to be able to preach tonight to the Queen of Heaven young people I know these ministers here look at you as just being the Church of Tomorrow you are the Church of today you don't need to wait till you're 20 or 25 or 30 and get the Holy Ghost get it now get it now if you ain't got it sing play your guitar do whatever you can do for the kingdom of God don't wait till mother Tim goes off the scene don't wait till I go off the sink do what you can do for the kingdom of God right now under the direction of your passion the men of God that's the way Caleb done it verse 14. or close and Caleb drove fence the three sons of big neck amen thalamide the son of Enoch let's rename these old boys shall we have high blood pressure a besetting sin melanoma Hallelujah oh lust pornography whatever you have meat of tonight let the Lord God let the Lord God and I ignite your face and what would it be one installment after another one installment after another leading to the ultimate which is the changing Club items so who's report will you believe I hate to say but French are going to be bombarded with some preachers because some preachers hate these youth camps message preachers I'm talking about they'll blast them for weeks before they start and weeks after they're over let's just spend the way it's been for years and years but maybe if they'd let some of their young people get come come here and be able to have an experience with God and then go back home and say Lord I'm sorry I blasted them things well I said well some of them go there to get boyfriends and girlfriends I agree and some of them go there and find the ultimate boyfriend they become married to him he becomes the king of kings [Applause] so as a musician's cup what's the name of your Mountain what's the name of your mouth maybe you're not 85 tonight but you feel so hampered by your facts maybe or Frailty whatever it is I've been so hurt my Preacher Brother Donnie so have I who do you figure has been hurt the most about preachers you are or these preachers that know preachers we have to pray don't we man of God to still maintain respect and Trust because of preachers that are nothing but wolves and sheep's clothing and you get to a spot you're saying oh Lord who's next who's going to do this who's going to do that but you have to keep your eyes on the promise Oh you mean you say you preachers go through that yell more than you do oh but I've been so scarred I understand scars I've got one right here on my hand I was bit by rabbit Fox when I was 11 years old from right there down to the bottom of my head myself my brother my sister had to take rabies shots One A Day In Our stomach seven up this side seven up that side for 14 days to keep us from going mad but you know what that scar I've never been able to feel since that doctor sewarded up that damage I laid there in that doctor's office 11 year old boy and that Dr tears running out of his eyes falling off his cheeks falling down in my head what is sewing it up but you know what that scar also means to me it also means it healed now but any of you all want to give me the right hand of fellowship if that place was still open and bleeding whenever that fox bit me and I was the oldest not my little sister down and got on top of her and was gnawing on her arms and as her big brother I went running toward her and I broke a stick and I went after that fox and whenever I did that fox reached and grabbed a hole to my hand instantly when he tore it open went numb but I'm so glad I've got that scar cause that means my hand healed over now I've got to remind her my whole life and my grandkids is little they don't ask me anymore because they're teenagers but when they would let us say poppy tell us about the fox tell us about the fox well I don't mind telling you I was scared to death of foxes for years terrified of them but not no more not no more so you want to keep your scar open the rest of your life well I've been hurt by preachers I've been hurt by this so you want to keep that scar open or you want to let the Lord God heal you of that scar and send right up and said well I've been hurt by preachers but there's some real men of God somewhere I've been hurt by this I've been hurt by that but there's some real Christians out there somewhere so whose report will we've been here brother Timothy maybe you can sing that song for us again now I want you to sing it with a different point of view now we're to looking at it from a perspective of an 85 year old man
