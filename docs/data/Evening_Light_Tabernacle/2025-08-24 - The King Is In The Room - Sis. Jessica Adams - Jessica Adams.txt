TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Applause] [Applause] Open the doors and make way. The king is in the room. The king is in the room. Expecting the strongholds to break. Cuz we know what you can do. We know what you can do. We're going to see lives changed, souls saved, broken hearts made new. The king is in the room [Music] and Lord we in you upon our praise. The king is in the room. [Music] There's freedom in life anywhere you pray. Jesus we bow only to you. We're laying down all of our crown. The king is in the room. The king is in the room. Come see all the captives run free. He's tearing down the walls. He's tearing down the walls. There's great shaking power when we sing the name above the wall. Your name above you all. The king is in the room. [Music] Lord, we enthrone you upon our face. The king is in the room. [Music] There's freedom in life anywhere you reign. Jesus, we only to you. We're laying down all of our crown. The king is in the room. The king is in the room. [Music] Fear has to flee. Shame has to leave before the king before the king. Chains have to break. Dry bonds awake. Prepare the way. Fear has to flee. Shame has to leave before the king before the king. Chase after break. Travel tow prepare the way. The king is in the road. Oh Lord, we enthrone you upon our praise. The kings in this room. There's freedom and life anywhere you reign. Jesus we bow. Only to you. We're laying down all of our crowns of kings in the world. The king is in the room. The king is in the room.
