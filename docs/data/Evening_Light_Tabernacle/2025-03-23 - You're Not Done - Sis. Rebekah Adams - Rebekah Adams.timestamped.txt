[0:00] [Music]
[0:15] I know you're
[0:18] tired. I know you're weak.
[0:22] And all of that fighting's got you down
[0:27] on your
[0:29] knees. You're desperate for
[0:33] change. You're desperate to know if
[0:36] there's a light still
[0:41] alive. Child, lift up your
[0:46] eyes. For your help draws nigh. I lift
[0:50] up your
[0:53] eyes. It'll be all right. Every tear
[0:58] you've
[1:01] cried. Let the sunlight dry. Every tear
[1:05] you've
[1:08] cried. It'll be all right. If you still
[1:12] have breath in your lungs. If you still
[1:16] have breath in your lungs, you're not
[1:22] [Music]
[1:27] done. I'll be your
[1:30] strength. I'll be your
[1:33] song. And I'll be the solid
[1:37] rock that you can't stand on.
[1:41] I'm with you
[1:44] always. I'm never alone cuz I'm right by
[1:50] your
[1:52] side. Just lift up your
[1:57] eyes. For your help draws nine. Just
[2:00] lift up your
[2:04] eyes. It'll be all right. Every tear you
[2:10] cry. Let the sunlight dry. Every tear
[2:15] you
[2:17] cry. It'll be all right. If you still
[2:22] have breath in your lungs. If you still
[2:25] have breath in your lungs. If you still
[2:29] have breath in your lungs. If you still
[2:32] have breath in your lungs. If you still
[2:35] have breath in your lungs. If you still
[2:39] have breath in your lungs, you're not
[2:45] alone. Oh child, lift up your
[2:51] eyes. For your help draws nigh. Child,
[2:55] lift up your
[2:58] eyes. It'll be all right. Every tear you
[3:05] cry. Let the sunlight dry. Every tear
[3:09] you
[3:12] cry. It'll be all right. If you still
[3:16] have breath in your lungs. If you still
[3:20] have breath in your lungs. If you still
[3:23] have breath in your lungs. If you still
[3:26] have breath in your lungs. You're not
[3:30] done.
