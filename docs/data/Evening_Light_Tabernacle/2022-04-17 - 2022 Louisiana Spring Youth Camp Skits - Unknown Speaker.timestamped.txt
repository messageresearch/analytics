[4:15] be at the gym tonight they're so
[4:16] gullible i mean they'll believe
[4:18] absolutely anything i tell them as long

[4:23] be happy thinking we're at the gym and
[4:24] we'll be happy right here yeah you know
[4:28] i'm very happy with you
[4:30] no that's enough talk
[4:33] for this is the will of god even your
[4:35] sanctification that you shapely abstain
[4:38] from fornication
[4:48] we better be going
[4:50] it's time for bible study
[4:52] like and our parents are going to be
[4:53] there what is up with that
[4:55] yeah i guess we better head out
[4:57] i'm surprised you even go to that that
[5:00] dumb bible study
[5:01] the bible is just a superstitious fairy
[5:03] tale you know the opiate of the masses
[5:07] religion is a joke it's just a crutch
[5:10] for feeble-minded people so they can
[5:12] cope with the harsh reality of their
[5:13] meaningless lives
[5:15] i mean do you really believe in god
[5:17] if god was real why would he allow all
[5:19] the suffering in the world
[5:21] yeah yeah i think i know what you mean
[5:24] but our parents are gonna be there like
[5:25] she said and we'll be in big trouble if
[5:27] we don't show up
[5:28] they'll tell the pastor and then he'll
[5:30] lecture us about forsaking the gathering
[5:32] of ourselves together and all that
[5:36] it's just easier for us to go through
[5:38] the motions rather than to put up with
[5:39] all that heat you know
[5:42] whatever i'll see you tomorrow
[5:44] but whosoever shall deny me before men
[5:47] him will i also deny before my father

[18:55] how many of you can testify that you've

[19:00] amen as we've heard this morning the
[19:02] devil may be telling you you've already
[19:03] missed your opportunity but he's lying
[19:05] to you
[19:06] if you've missed an opportunity so far
[19:08] you still have more opportunities but
[19:10] don't let it pass you by amen
[19:14] you know most of us have probably never
[19:17] been in a real courtroom during a real
[19:20] court trial
[19:21] but today we're going to take you inside
[19:24] of a courtroom
[19:25] and
[19:26] not just for any court trial
[19:28] but for the greatest trial of all time
[19:32] and you may be saying to yourself great
[19:34] right this is going to be good who is it
[19:36] that's on trial
[19:38] well it's you
[19:40] you're on trial today because whether
[19:43] you realize it or not
[19:45] every single day there is a great
[19:47] accuser
[19:48] who is accusing you day and night
[19:51] and he's bringing constant attacks and
[19:53] he's bringing false accusations against
[19:56] your claim that you are a child of god
[20:00] now this courtroom that we're going to
[20:01] go into today
[20:03] it's not just
[20:05] any old regular courtroom because it's
[20:07] actually located on a battlefield
[20:10] and then that battlefield is actually
[20:11] located in your mind
[20:14] and you fight on this battlefield
[20:16] constantly you fight for your rights of
[20:18] redemption rights of salvation rights of
[20:21] healing your right to be delivered
[20:24] you're right for the baptism of the holy
[20:26] ghost and we're all fighting for that
[20:28] body change
[20:30] not only are you going to see a court
[20:31] scene up here today but there's also
[20:33] going to be a church
[20:35] folks are going to sit in that church
[20:36] and they're going to watch this court
[20:37] scene just like you do
[20:40] and i believe that many of you today are
[20:42] going to be able to relate to the
[20:43] thoughts
[20:44] that they express
[20:47] as the cases play out before you today
[20:49] there's going to be those that will
[20:50] testify on your behalf
[20:53] and i ask you to listen closely
[20:55] listen with an open heart
[20:57] listen to the evidence and decide
[20:59] whether or not you will be found guilty
[21:02] or innocent
[21:04] whether you will stay stay bound up in
[21:06] chains
[21:07] or whether you will go free today
[21:10] ladies and gentlemen we present to you
[21:13] the rigged court
[21:17] [Applause]
[21:32] [Music]
[21:41] [Music]
[22:22] all rise
[22:33] be seated
[22:35] for when our man wants taste of christ
[22:38] do the things so early by no means he
[22:40] has any desire
[22:42] to go back into that what does he do the
[22:45] life paul said that i once lived i live
[22:47] no more
[22:50] yet i live
[22:52] not neither christ in me why he raised
[22:55] him from this low level of worldly sin
[22:59] up to a place that we ourselves
[23:02] can look back and see where we come from
[23:08] back and see where we once lived
[23:10] now we live different to assure us
[23:14] that we are dead and our lives are
[23:16] hitting christ through god that are
[23:18] sealed by the holy ghost and raised
[23:20] above those things then we are a lie
[23:24] with the same evidence that he come back
[23:27] with to prove to us
[23:30] our first case here today will be
[23:32] repentant sinners versus satan
[23:35] defendants
[23:36] the witness stand please
[23:54] place right hand on the bible
[23:56] do you selling this word to tell the
[23:57] truth the whole truth nothing but the
[23:59] truth so i be god

[24:29] ungodly life but one day a friend of
[24:33] mine invited me to church and i repented
[24:36] and was baptized in the name of our lord

[24:42] god filled me with the holy ghost it
[24:45] gave me overcoming power his precious
[24:47] blood is greater than all my sin and i
[24:50] am no longer a slave to sin or the fear
[24:53] of going to hell
[25:02] your honor i too was a sinner i wasn't
[25:05] even worthy to live

[29:32] i feel religious
[29:36] our next case is divine healing and
[29:39] miracles versus satan
[29:41] will the defendants please take the
[29:42] stand
[30:11] the defendants have made false claims
[30:13] that god still miraculously heals the
[30:15] sick
[30:15] and delivers from demon spirits
[30:18] why
[30:18] they even line people up and pray for
[30:21] them they get so emotional screaming
[30:24] shouting running even speaking in
[30:26] tongues
[30:27] intelligent minds know that only modern
[30:30] science and medicine can heal the sick
[30:33] they're an embarrassment to the world
[30:34] and must be
[30:36] stopped
[30:37] smart move devil but let's hear what the
[30:39] defendants have to say in response to
[30:41] your charge
[30:42] your honor my defense today is my
[30:45] testimony of the miraculous
[30:47] power of god first of all i'd like to
[30:50] explain the definition of the word
[30:52] miracle a surprising and welcome event
[30:54] that is not explicable by natural and
[30:56] scientific laws and is therefore
[30:58] considered to be the work of a divine
[30:59] agency i had an autoimmune disease
[31:02] called alopecia which caused me to go
[31:04] completely bald
[31:06] devil you said that only intelligent
[31:08] minds know that medicine science can
[31:10] heal the sick but in my case medicine
[31:12] and science has no cure for alopecia you
[31:15] said that i would just have to live with
[31:17] being bald because god doesn't heal
[31:18] anymore but you are a liar satan do you
[31:20] see the hair that i have on my head
[31:22] today
[31:23] that was my god and he alone has
[31:25] destroyed my groove and there was
[31:27] nothing you can do to stop him
[31:42] witnesses from the audience if i may
[31:44] objection your honor those people are
[31:47] not in this skit objectionable
[31:50] this is not a skit this is reality
[31:58] defend it you may continue
[32:01] have any of you ever experienced in your
[32:03] own life or in the life of your family
[32:05] the supernatural healing power of god
[32:08] if you have please stand your feet

[32:55] [Applause]
[33:08] your honor i would like to share some of
[33:10] my testimony
[33:16] for the past year i have been bound by
[33:18] fear
[33:19] and it has held me
[33:21] that i can never go forward i can never
[33:24] get past it
[33:26] satan always came against me attacked my
[33:29] mind
[33:30] and told me i would never make it told
[33:32] me why go to heaven you're scared
[33:35] but you lied
[33:37] i went to a camp a few months ago and
[33:40] the lord gave me complete deliverance
[33:42] i'm no longer bound by that stupid fear
[33:45] you're trying to put on my life satan
[33:47] i'm free
[33:51] it seems you have a bad memory
[33:55] now i remind you of all the many
[33:57] challenges you and your fellow demons
[33:59] made here at this very camp three years
[34:02] ago
[34:03] young people bound by fear
[34:05] doubt depression and suicide we're all
[34:08] set free by the mighty name of jesus
[34:11] and you most assuredly lose every battle
[34:14] this year
[34:15] let me just remind you not even cancer
[34:20] [Applause]
[34:37] [Applause]
[34:42] your honor
[34:44] the infallible word of god declares that
[34:46] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[34:49] and forever
[34:50] he is still the god that heals all our
[34:53] diseases and the prayer of faith still
[34:55] saves the sick
[34:57] that is a promise and part of our
[34:59] inheritance as believers the devil has
[35:02] no legal right to take that away and
[35:05] furthermore all the devils in hell can't
[35:07] take it away we will not be denied
[35:11] [Applause]
[35:19] stand up you cowards
[35:20] [Applause]
[35:25] your honor and i'll do
[35:28] disrespect my colleagues and i find this
[35:30] courtroom and trial proceedings to be
[35:33] rigged in the defendant's favor
[35:36] i realize that i don't normally do this
[35:38] but i couldn't agree with you more but
[35:40] it is your claims that are false not the
[35:42] defendants
[35:44] case is missed
[35:54] your honor before we proceed to the
[35:56] final case i beg you for a recess i need
[35:59] to regroup and call in a few
[36:00] reinforcements
[36:02] well i honestly don't see where any more
[36:04] support for you would change the outcome
[36:06] of this trial but permission granted
[36:08] however you must hurry for your time is
[36:10] short
[36:13] [Applause]
[36:32] oh my word i can hardly believe what
[36:35] we've been seeing and hearing
[36:37] those young people are so strong and
[36:39] excited about serving god they're not
[36:41] afraid to stand up to the devil
[36:43] but i'm just too weak and afraid i'll
[36:45] never be an overcomer
[36:47] yeah and not only that but they claim
[36:50] victory over sin i mean come on i
[36:53] thought i'd always be a sinner that god
[36:55] loves me in my sin and accepts me the
[36:58] way i am
[36:59] how can you be free from sin
[37:02] and also how can you be sure
[37:05] well
[37:06] they talk about how the holy ghost gives
[37:08] them power to overcome sin and become a
[37:10] new creation
[37:12] whatever that means
[37:14] i've never been told that i really
[37:15] needed the holy ghost and i was raised
[37:17] in the message and went to church just
[37:19] like the rest of you
[37:20] but i never really lived a christian
[37:22] life
[37:23] oh god save me
[37:28] me too
[37:29] i just accepted jesus as my savior and i
[37:32] believe god's
[37:33] prophet
[37:34] but i just went on living that same old
[37:36] way
[37:37] nothing really changed
[37:39] i get so depressed and ashamed of the
[37:41] way i live i didn't even know i could
[37:43] really be set free
[37:46] oh lord
[37:47] i am ready to surrender
[37:53] well it's obvious that those dividends
[37:55] are free from the devil's rule
[37:57] and i can be too
[37:59] if i truly repent he will fill me with
[38:01] the holy ghost
[38:03] so that i can be an overcomer
[38:05] i mean just look at this insane world
[38:09] i don't want to be identified with it
[38:12] i just can't remain where i'm at anymore
[38:14] i have to rise up and walk towards the
[38:16] promises of god
[38:25] really
[38:27] i'm so sick and tired of
[38:29] drifting along and pretending to be a
[38:31] believer but yet living a hidden life of
[38:33] sin and shame
[38:34] honestly i've always believed i've gone
[38:37] too far
[38:38] i've turned that call down so many times
[38:41] but yet
[38:42] something keeps drawing me
[38:46] not yet
[38:49] now's not the time for you
[38:51] i guess i'll just wait
[38:55] what about the miraculous healings they
[38:56] talked about my church
[38:58] never has a prayer line
[39:01] or altar calls for that matter
[39:03] i know i would really like the
[39:05] opportunity to be prayed for and
[39:06] experience the healing and delivering
[39:08] power of god i hear about others being
[39:10] delivered and healed just
[39:12] never really believed it for myself but
[39:14] i do now
[39:18] well all i know is i want what they've
[39:21] got can't y'all see god's raising up a
[39:24] mighty army to defeat the devil and tear
[39:26] his kingdom down it's time we take hold
[39:28] of what's rightfully ours we have played
[39:30] around long enough and we've been
[39:32] believing the devil's lies for far too
[39:34] long
[39:35] this is my time
[39:42] hey
[39:43] don't just settle down and think
[39:45] rational just a minute
[39:47] they're just getting all worked up
[39:49] and emotional in that trial
[39:51] they're making you scared
[39:53] no need for that fanaticism you've all
[39:56] made a profession of faith you go to
[39:58] church you believe god sent a prophet
[40:00] that's all you need

[40:04] your sins so

[57:44] you the prophet of god would say because
[57:46] he knows
[57:47] that if they ever get the true
[57:49] revelation of who they are
[57:51] what they they can do the greater works
[57:53] he knows so he's got to keep you from
[57:56] knowing
[57:57] he tries to keep you from knowing
[57:59] because he said once they know
[58:02] they will be
[58:04] not might be i hope they'll be
[58:06] they
[58:07] will
[58:08] be

[58:29] pace dismissed
[58:31] case dismissed
[58:40] as we approach
[58:43] the service tonight
[58:46] once again you're going to see a miracle
[58:51] you're gonna see a man stand up here and
[58:52] preach
[58:53] [Music]
[58:56] that's supposed to be dead
[58:59] you're gonna be minute by dead man
[59:00] tonight
[59:04] that was their testimony
[59:05] [Music]
[59:07] but my god still showing up at the tomb
[59:09] of every lazarus
[59:11] he's still rolling stones away
[59:14] and as much as i appreciate the miracle
[59:17] in brother ron spencer's life what about
[59:19] your miracle
[59:21] what about your moment

[1:00:02] hurt him with these ears
[1:00:04] the mob was too loud

[1:00:10] throwing fruits and vegetables and
[1:00:12] hollering and screaming you know
[1:00:14] sometimes people may think you get a
[1:00:15] little too pentecostal a little out of
[1:00:17] order

[1:00:21] that in the middle of a riot they asked
[1:00:23] him to calm down
[1:00:26] he got so loud he was screaming some of
[1:00:28] a riot in the middle of a mob they said
[1:00:30] this guy's out of order
