[41:54] I tried so hard to hide.
[41:59] Though I [singing] laughed and [music]
[42:01] said my life was fine without you.
[42:07] I was covering [singing and music] up
[42:10] the secret tears I cried.
[42:14] But then one [singing and music] day
[42:17] someone told me of your mercy
[42:23] &gt;&gt; and the love [singing and music] you
[42:24] showed on a hill called Calary.
[42:30] There you
[42:33] purchase [singing and music] my
[42:34] redemption.
[42:38] When you [singing] broke sense power,
[42:39] [music]
[42:40] set my spirit free.
[42:44] Oh, I'm amazed [singing]
[42:48] [music]
[42:49] that you that you love me.
[42:52] I'm [singing] amazed.
[42:57] [music]
[42:58] Oh, you care. Through your [singing]
[43:01] preious
[43:03] blood, I found [music]
[43:05] pardon.
[43:07] And [singing] my sins
[43:10] are washed.
[43:11] They're all washed away. Oh, my
[43:15] [singing and music] sins
[43:17] are washed away.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, it's true. [singing]
[43:24] There have [music] been days when I
[43:27] failed you.
[43:30] Lord, you [music] know the [singing]
[43:31] many times I've gone astray. I've gone
[43:35] astray, [music] but but I've learned
[43:38] your [singing] love is strong.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; And my weakness and my weakness
[43:44] and your ear is [singing] open [music]
[43:47] every time I pray.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; No one else has [music and singing] ever
[43:54] cared for me like you, Lord. Other
[43:59] friends [music] can me [singing]
[44:02] as close to you.
[44:05] I am not afraid [singing and music] to
[44:07] face the problems of tomorrow.
[44:13] No, you [singing] are everything [music]
[44:16] I
[44:18] ever
[44:21] [music and singing]
[44:24] love. Oh, I'm amazed.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; How amazed
[44:31] how you
[44:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, how you care
[44:35] &gt;&gt; through [music and singing] your preious
[44:36] blood.
[44:36] &gt;&gt; Your precious blood I found [singing]
[44:41] &gt;&gt; and my sash. [music]
[44:48] [music]
[44:49] [singing] Sing that second verse
[44:50] together.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; Wash away.
[44:56] Yes, it's true. There have been [music]
[44:58] days [singing]
[45:00] when I failed you,
[45:03] Lord. You know [singing] the many times
[45:07] I've gone astray. [music]
[45:10] But I've learned your love [singing] is
[45:12] stronger than my weakness. [music]
[45:17] And your ear is open every time
[45:21] [singing] I pray.
[45:24] No one else has ever cared for me
[45:29] &gt;&gt; like you, Lord.
[45:32] Other friends can [music] never
[45:34] [singing] be as close to me.
[45:38] I'm [music] not afraid to face problems
[45:42] of tomorrow. [singing]
[45:46] Oh, [music] you are everything [singing]
[45:48] I'll ever need.
[45:53] I'm amazed.
[45:56] Oh, [music] that you love me. Yes, Lord.
[46:00] How amazing. [singing]
[46:02] [music]
[46:08] [music]
[46:11] [singing]
[46:15] [music]
[46:18] They're [singing] all washed away. Oh,
[46:21] my [music] sins
[46:23] are [singing] washed. Oh, I'm amazed.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; [music]
[46:28] &gt;&gt; I'm amazed
[46:31] &gt;&gt; how much you love me.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, I'm [music]
[46:36] amazed. [singing]
[46:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, happy
[46:42] your presence.
[46:45] I for you
[46:49] &gt;&gt; and my [music] sins [singing]
[46:51] are wash
[46:53] all washed away. [singing]
[46:56] All [music] our sin
[46:58] will wash
[47:00] away. [singing]
[47:01] [music]
[47:06] Jesus [singing]

[50:46] Your soul
[50:48] shall find
[50:51] rest
[50:53] beyond
[50:55] the river.
[51:00] Amen. I believe that's where we want to
[51:03] be hidden is in the cross.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; Under the shed blood of the Lord Jesus.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; Good to be in the house of the Lord
[51:12] today.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; I tell you, if you haven't been here in
[51:15] a while, we want you to feel very
[51:17] welcome. If you've been here regularly,
[51:19] well, we sure want you to feel welcome,
[51:21] too. Amen. [music] It's just good to
[51:23] gather in the presence of the Lord
[51:26] &gt;&gt; and to have this moment today to worship
[51:29] him, to praise him, [music]
[51:31] to give him glory, to give him honor.
[51:34] He's our Lord, our Savior. Amen. Our
[51:37] soon coming King. Amen. God bless you.
[51:41] So good to have you with [music] us

[51:47] as [music] we have filled the baptistry
[51:48] pool, we got Sister Hannah Middleton
[51:52] wants to be baptized in the name of the
[51:55] Lord Jesus Christ. And I'm so thankful
[51:58] to see her heart turned to God. And I
[52:01] believe he's going to do great things in
[52:03] her life.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. I tell you what, there's nothing
[52:06] like serving Jesus. [music]
[52:08] &gt;&gt; And we want to serve him with all our
[52:10] heart.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Today I I want to just take a
[52:14] special moment here and um wish a a dear
[52:19] lady, a special lady, a mother in Israel
[52:23] a happy birthday. She's turning [music]
[52:25] 94 this week, Sister Helen Williams.
[52:28] She's a a faithful daughter of God for
[52:30] many, many years now. And I think all
[52:34] how we loved her, her husband, Brother
[52:36] Earl, her son, Brother Daniel Williams,
[52:39] one of my best friends [music] of my
[52:41] life. And of course, uh, the mother,
[52:44] she's also the mother to our dear
[52:46] sister, Rachel Shaw. And we just want to
[52:50] wish her a happy birthday today. [music]
[52:52] Amen. Why don't you give her a hand of
[52:54] applause today? [applause]
[52:56] Amen. God bless you. Amen. You are loved
[52:59] in the Lord. [applause] I tell you what,

[53:40] Jesus near every day of the year. Happy
[53:45] birthday to you. [music] A happy

[53:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, Brother Tim, you've
[53:58] never sang happy birthday to me. Well,
[54:01] if you turn to 94, maybe I can sing it
[54:04] if I have breath left. Amen.
[54:07] Ain't God good to us? Gives us so many
[54:10] blessings. I want to sing that one, too.
[54:13] Ain't God good to give us so many
[54:16] blessings?
[54:17] &gt;&gt; You're a blessing this morning. It's a
[54:19] blessing to be together.
[54:21] Amen.
[54:24] Well, ain't God good to give us so many
[54:29] [music]
[54:29] blessings undeserving.
[54:32] That's what we are.
[54:35] We ought to thank him, love and praise
[54:40] him more today and a whole lot more
[54:43] [music] tomorrow.
[54:45] Well, ain't God
[54:48] to give us so many blessings and [music]
[54:53] that's what they are.
[54:56] We are thanking
[54:58] for love and praise [music] him for
[55:01] today and a whole lot more. [singing]
[55:07] [music]
[55:07] Amen. Let's just talk to the Lord now.
[55:11] Maybe you got a request on your heart
[55:13] today and you just like to bring it
[55:17] before the Lord and ask his grace upon
[55:20] your life on the need that you have.
[55:24] Father, as we bow before you today, we
[55:28] just want [music] to express our
[55:29] thanksgiving to you for all the good
[55:33] things, the great things that [music]
[55:34] you've done.
[55:36] Lord, as the song says
[55:41] about Jesus, he ain't never done me
[55:44] nothing but good.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; Certainly, Lord, we can say that today.
[55:49] Your blessings have been upon our lives.
[55:51] Your mercies have endured. I pray Lord a
[55:54] special blessings upon your children
[55:56] today as we have come and we we [music]
[56:00] need you today to anoint our ears to
[56:02] hear to anoint our hearts to receive to
[56:06] anoint this mouth to speak oh God as an
[56:09] oracle of God. Oh father that we could
[56:12] hear what the spirit [music] has to say
[56:14] to the church. I pray Lord you'll bless
[56:17] your children that have assembled Lord.
[56:19] There have got needs in their lives.
[56:22] Lord, there's desires in their hearts.
[56:25] Oh God, there's longings in their soul.
[56:28] And I pray that you'll meet every need
[56:30] today. And anoint us now as we read your
[56:33] word. [music] We know nothing to do but
[56:35] do that, Lord. Because if we're really
[56:38] going to say anything, it's got to come
[56:40] from the Bible, the word of God. It's
[56:42] the infallible word. Every other man's
[56:45] word will fail, but your word never
[56:47] fails. Bless us, I pray, together in
[56:50] your presence in Jesus' [music] name.
[56:53] Amen.
[56:54] If you'll turn with me to 2 Corinthians
[56:58] chapter 1 verse 21. I have several
[57:01] scripture readings I want to read. Um,
[57:05] a couple of more from the book of
[57:07] Ephesians.
[57:08] So, 2 Corinthians chapter 1 verse 21.
[57:13] Now he which established us with you in
[57:17] Christ hath anointed us is God who hath
[57:22] also sealed us and given the earnest of
[57:27] the spirit in our hearts. Notice
[57:30] something here in this scripture because
[57:32] it's going to be important as we go
[57:34] along that he hath anointed us and that
[57:36] one that has anointed us is God.
[57:40] But he has also sealed us and given us
[57:44] the earnest of the spirit in our hearts.
[57:47] Now, if you'll turn with me to Ephesians
[57:48] chapter 4 and verse 30, we're going to
[57:51] read from there as well. Ephesians 4:30,
[57:55] and grieve not the Holy Spirit of God,
[57:58] whereby you are sealed unto the day of
[58:01] redemption. And in Ephesians chapter 1
[58:05] and verse 11,
[58:07] in whom also we have obtained an
[58:10] inheritance,
[58:12] being predestinated according to the
[58:14] purpose of him who workketh all things
[58:18] after the counsel of his own will, that
[58:21] we should be to the praise of his glory,
[58:24] who first trusted in Christ, who in whom
[58:28] all ye also trusted after that you heard
[58:32] the word of truth, the gospel of your
[58:34] salvation, and whom also after that you
[58:38] believed, you were sealed with that Holy
[58:41] Spirit of promise, which is the earnest
[58:44] of our inheritance until the redemption
[58:47] of the purchased possession, unto the
[58:50] praise of his glory. Amen. God bless
[58:53] you. Can be seated.
[58:56] you know, um today
[58:59] really we're living in a very uh
[59:02] treacherous time
[59:04] &gt;&gt; uh because um of the the con condition
[59:08] of the world in which we live and u the
[59:11] situations that are around us
[59:14] &gt;&gt; and even in Christianom there is it's a
[59:17] dangerous time because there's too many
[59:19] that are content to just live in a
[59:22] shallow Christianity that is satisfied
[59:26] with emotion or with form or or doctrine
[59:29] without truly knowing him.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; But the call of the spirit in this hour
[59:34] is to lead God's people into a deeper
[59:37] life into a hidden fellowship of Christ
[59:40] where your roots go down real deep and
[59:44] and where fruit then comes forth out of
[59:46] your life. Paul would say, "Oh, the
[59:50] depth of the riches both of the wisdom
[59:52] and knowledge of God." And again, he
[59:55] said that I might know him in the power
[59:57] of his resurrection.
[59:59] And that's what we're after today is not
[1:00:01] a surface religion, but some a life that
[1:00:05] is flowing from the depths of his
[1:00:08] presence to to be sealed to the day of
[1:00:10] redemption. Now, Paul was describing in
[1:00:14] the divine process of salvation that
[1:00:18] gives us an inheritance in three stages.
[1:00:20] And this is what we're going to speak on
[1:00:22] today is is the evidence of the seal of
[1:00:25] God
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; because we we have been speaking about
[1:00:28] the Holy Spirit and its works and his
[1:00:31] life. And even last week we spoke on the
[1:00:34] strongholds there that we are to cast
[1:00:37] down. How that every believer, every
[1:00:39] Christian, ever born again, sealed of
[1:00:41] God believer has battles within the
[1:00:44] mind. And we get to battles with the
[1:00:47] flesh
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; because neither one of them are
[1:00:50] redeemed.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; It is the soul that has been redeemed
[1:00:53] and and has started a fight within us.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; And of course um it's the battleground
[1:00:59] where that we we fight against not flesh
[1:01:02] and blood but against powers and and
[1:01:05] principalities and spiritual wickedness
[1:01:08] um in in in high places. So you see um
[1:01:12] in this scripture that we have just read
[1:01:14] from Ephesians chapter 1, Paul is
[1:01:17] describing the divine process of
[1:01:20] salvation that gives us an inheritance
[1:01:23] in three stages. And and one is hearing
[1:01:26] the word of truth. Um I actually if
[1:01:29] you'll just put back up for me verse 13
[1:01:32] of chapter 1 there and and um you can
[1:01:36] follow me down through verse 14 if you
[1:01:38] will. But anyway, you again, you know,
[1:01:41] here here it is. It's described if you
[1:01:44] see you heard the word of truth, the
[1:01:47] gospel of your salvation in whom that
[1:01:49] you believed. So here's believe in the
[1:01:52] gospel, hearing the word of truth, and
[1:01:55] then you're sealed with that Holy Spirit
[1:01:58] of promise.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; Now the the spirit is called the
[1:02:02] earnest. It means the down payment or
[1:02:06] the guarantee.
[1:02:08] It is the pledge that what God began in
[1:02:11] you, he will complete.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; And and this is what he says in
[1:02:16] Philippians 1 and6. He said, "Being
[1:02:19] confident of this," and this is where
[1:02:21] your confidence has got to rest this
[1:02:23] morning. If you're just starting out, if
[1:02:26] you're if you're sealed to the day of
[1:02:28] redemption, doesn't matter what the
[1:02:29] level that you're in, that you must be
[1:02:32] confident of this, that he that began a
[1:02:36] good work in you will perform it or
[1:02:39] carried it on to completion until the
[1:02:42] day of Jesus Christ. So you see, Paul
[1:02:47] speaks of the Holy Spirit as the earnest
[1:02:50] of our inheritance until the redemption
[1:02:55] of the purchased possession. Now when
[1:02:58] Paul says the purchased possession, he's
[1:03:01] referring to the believer themselves.
[1:03:03] And and so by extension, the entire
[1:03:06] creation that Christ redeemed through
[1:03:08] his blood. So he as he said in the book
[1:03:11] of Corinthians, HE SAID, "YOU'RE NOT
[1:03:14] your own. You have been bought with a
[1:03:16] price."
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; And then he he says in Acts chapter 20,
[1:03:21] he says to feed the church of God, which
[1:03:23] he has purchased with his own blood. So
[1:03:26] you have been purchased with his own
[1:03:28] blood. You have been bought with a price
[1:03:30] with a price. You are not your own
[1:03:34] because through the cross Christ legally
[1:03:39] purchased us. Redemption is both a a
[1:03:42] transaction the price paid by blood and
[1:03:45] a transformation the life restored by
[1:03:47] the spirit. So thus the purchased
[1:03:50] possession refers to the bloodbought
[1:03:54] believer who has been paid for in full
[1:03:57] but YET NOT FULLY REDEEMED in
[1:03:59] manifestation because our mortal bodies
[1:04:02] have not been changed.
[1:04:04] And and while the soul has been
[1:04:06] redeemed, the body awaits redemption.
[1:04:08] And that's what Paul calls the
[1:04:10] redemption of our body. AND HE SAYS ALL
[1:04:12] CREATION the groans and travails in pain
[1:04:17] together until even now. And he said not
[1:04:20] only they but ourselves also WHICH HAVE
[1:04:23] THE FIRST FRUITS of the spirit. Even we
[1:04:25] ourselves grown within ourselves waiting
[1:04:28] for the adoption that is the redemption
[1:04:31] of our body. And that is true. We grown.
[1:04:34] We struggle. We are here in a life of
[1:04:36] struggle. And we're longing for that day
[1:04:39] when we will be fully redeemed. Now,
[1:04:43] this fully redemption though will take
[1:04:45] place at the change of our bodies at the
[1:04:47] resurrection or the rapture when we are
[1:04:50] glorified. And as as Philippians says,
[1:04:53] WHO SHALL CHANGE OUR BOUND BODY that we
[1:04:56] might be fashioned into his own glorious
[1:04:59] body. So we have already been redeemed
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; because we are been bought with a price.
[1:05:06] when we are sealed with the Holy Spirit
[1:05:08] as a earnest are of our inheritance, but
[1:05:11] we're waiting for the full redemption,
[1:05:13] the complete deliverance of this mortal
[1:05:16] frame into immortality.
[1:05:19] And the Holy Ghost is the seal and the
[1:05:23] earnest. It is and that is the first
[1:05:26] installment of glory. IT IS GOD SAYING,
[1:05:29] "THIS one belongs to me and I will
[1:05:32] finish what I started."
[1:05:34] So, so the seal of course means
[1:05:37] ownership. So, if I can just kind of get
[1:05:39] your thoughts together with me for a
[1:05:41] moment, I want you to get it. The first
[1:05:44] thing that seal signifies is ownership.
[1:05:47] Uh, you see 2 Timothy 2:19 says,
[1:05:51] "Nevertheless, the foundation of God
[1:05:54] standeth sure, having this seal, the
[1:05:57] Lord knoweth them that are his, and let
[1:05:59] everyone that nameth the name of Christ
[1:06:02] depart from iniquity."
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Right? So you see, the Lord knows who is
[1:06:07] his. So he has claimed you by his own
[1:06:11] blood. He paid for you. You are his. You
[1:06:14] are NOT A CHILD OF THE DEVIL. You belong
[1:06:18] to God.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember, you never was originally
[1:06:22] a child of the devil. You belong to God
[1:06:25] before the foundation of the world.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; But because of sin, you were lost in sin
[1:06:30] and were by nature the children of
[1:06:32] wrath, even as others. But now God rich
[1:06:35] in mercy hath redeemed you by his blood
[1:06:38] paid the purchase price. And he's not
[1:06:41] through working on you.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; He will perform it to the day of Christ.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we we are people that are are
[1:06:49] living in imperfection
[1:06:52] while we are striving for that day where
[1:06:55] perfection will come.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; AND SO WE DON'T EXPECT OUR LIVES TO BE
[1:07:00] PERFECT HERE. WE EXPECT OUR LIVES to be
[1:07:04] progressing here.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; Now now and of course then another thing
[1:07:08] is security. The Bible says in Ephesians
[1:07:11] 4:30, "And grieve not the Holy Spirit of
[1:07:14] God, whereby you are sealed to the day
[1:07:17] of redemption." And so the seal marks
[1:07:20] you as God's property. It's God's mark
[1:07:24] of approval on your life. It is heaven's
[1:07:27] identification stamp on your soul. And
[1:07:30] without that seal, the claim of
[1:07:32] redemption
[1:07:34] cannot be completed because the seal is
[1:07:37] what binds your mortal to the immortal,
[1:07:40] the human to the divine. BROTHER
[1:07:42] BRANDHAM TELLS US IN the breach between
[1:07:44] the church ages and the seals, he said
[1:07:46] another thing a seal signifies is
[1:07:49] ownership.
[1:07:50] The seal has a mark on it. Shows
[1:07:52] ownership. WHEN YOU ARE BOUGHT BY THE
[1:07:54] BLOOD OF JESUS Christ and sealed by the
[1:07:57] Holy Ghost, you are no longer belong to
[1:08:00] the world or anything pertain to the
[1:08:02] world. You are owned by God. Another
[1:08:04] thing, a seal is security. It means
[1:08:06] you're secure. And now you you that
[1:08:09] don't believe in eternal security, I
[1:08:12] don't know. But a seal signifies
[1:08:14] security to his destination. And woe to
[1:08:16] that guy that would try to break that
[1:08:19] seal. And the Holy Spirit's seal cannot
[1:08:23] be broken. You've heard me pe me me say
[1:08:25] that people said the devil made me do
[1:08:27] this. No. No. The devil didn't do it.
[1:08:30] You just wasn't sealed in. So then
[1:08:32] because you when you're sealed in, he's
[1:08:35] sealed out. Now you went out to him. He
[1:08:37] couldn't get out to you because the only
[1:08:39] way he could get into you is to come
[1:08:42] through the same process that you have.
[1:08:44] He'd have to be saved, sanctified,
[1:08:47] filled with the Holy Ghost, and then
[1:08:49] he'd be your brother. So he did, he
[1:08:51] didn't do it. No. No. You just went out
[1:08:53] to the borderline. You went to the
[1:08:55] borderline and come back lusting for the
[1:08:57] things of the world. You never went all
[1:09:00] all the way over into Canaan. You see,
[1:09:01] across Jordan to death to self. SO,
[1:09:04] BROTHER BRANDHAM TELLS US THESE THINGS,
[1:09:06] you know, that it's a security. It it
[1:09:09] signifies ownership in the FUTURE HOME.
[1:09:12] BROTHER BRANDHAM TALKS ABOUT temptation
[1:09:15] and he says Satan can tempt BUT HE
[1:09:18] CANNOT GET a born again Christian.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful for that.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; For God from the FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD
[1:09:25] FORSAW HIM, sent Jesus to redeem him and
[1:09:29] the blood speaks for him. So how can he
[1:09:32] sin when it can't be seen even by God?
[1:09:36] And and of course, Satan can tempt and
[1:09:39] it can bring wrong thoughts into the
[1:09:41] mind, but he cannot cancel the security
[1:09:45] of the soul.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, THAT'S THAT'S JUST THE ENEMY'S
[1:09:49] ATTEMPT to keep you from walking in
[1:09:51] victory because if he can't possess you,
[1:09:54] then he will oppress you.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; And and so again, as we're looking at
[1:10:01] this, that's that a seal is an identity.
[1:10:05] identity. The Bible said in Romans 8:16,
[1:10:09] the spirit itself beareth witness with
[1:10:12] our spirit that we are the children of
[1:10:16] God.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; So he as he said, you're not your own.
[1:10:20] YOU'VE BEEN BOUGHT WITH the price, his
[1:10:22] own blood. So again, we're looking at
[1:10:25] this and we are sealed until the
[1:10:28] redemption
[1:10:29] of the purchased possession. Now, that's
[1:10:32] the scripture we want to be looking at.
[1:10:34] You know, the the redemption of the
[1:10:36] purchased POSSESSION IS THE FINAL ACT OF
[1:10:40] GOD'S great drama of grace. CHRIST
[1:10:43] BOUGHT US at Calvary. THE HOLY SPIRIT
[1:10:46] SEALED US AT PENTECOST. And soon at the
[1:10:49] coming of the Lord, he will redeem the
[1:10:51] body that he has purchased, transform it
[1:10:54] into his glorious likeness. And the
[1:10:57] spirit in you is not the full
[1:10:59] inheritance yet. It's the earnest. IT'S
[1:11:02] THE DOWN PAYMENT. IT SAYS THERE'S MORE
[1:11:04] TO COME.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; AND I WANTED TO SAY TO YOU, you know,
[1:11:08] how great it is to know this morning
[1:11:11] that there's more to come.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. That that even though we receive
[1:11:16] the Holy Spirit of promise, it is
[1:11:19] promises there's something greater
[1:11:21] coming.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; And that greater coming will be when
[1:11:24] when you your not only your soul will be
[1:11:27] saved, but your spirit will be delivered
[1:11:30] and your body will be changed.
[1:11:33] So you see, I want YOU TO HOLD FAST THIS
[1:11:36] MORNING AND KNOW that you are already
[1:11:38] his property. YOU ARE SEALED WITH THE
[1:11:41] SPIRIT AND YOU'RE WAITING FOR THAT DAY
[1:11:43] WHEN THE TRUMPET SOUNDS and the
[1:11:46] purchased possession. Your whole being
[1:11:48] and your spirit, SOUL, AND BODY will be
[1:11:51] redeemed and glorified to the praise and
[1:11:53] glory of God. So you see, as we're
[1:11:56] looking at this though, I I want you to
[1:11:59] understand, it's vitally important
[1:12:01] though to receive this down payment,
[1:12:03] this first installment of of the God's
[1:12:07] plan OF REDEMPTION. AND THAT is the
[1:12:09] earnest of your inheritance, the baptism
[1:12:12] of the Holy Ghost. And and it's not
[1:12:14] optional. IT IS ESSENTIAL. IT IS
[1:12:17] absolutely necessary.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, IT'S THE TOKEN THAT YOU BELONG
[1:12:23] to God. IT. IT'S THE POWER THAT WILL
[1:12:25] CHANGE HIS MORTAL BODY. IT'S THE FIRE
[1:12:28] THAT KEEPS YOUR LAMP BURNING until the
[1:12:30] bridegroom comes.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; SO WITHOUT THE EARNEST, YOUR CANDLE'S
[1:12:35] UNLIT. THE BODY'S UNPREPARED AND THE
[1:12:37] SOUL IS UNSEALED. BUT with the earnest,
[1:12:41] oh glory to God, you are marked. You are
[1:12:44] empowered. You are destined for
[1:12:46] transformation.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN. FOR THE BIBLE SAID THIS
[1:12:49] CORRUPTION, DISCORPTABLE, THAT'S WHAT
[1:12:52] WE'RE IN. CORRUPTIBLE BODIES MUST PUT ON
[1:12:54] INCORRUPTION AND THIS MORTAL MUST PUT ON
[1:12:58] immortality and and it IS THE SPIRIT
[1:13:01] THAT IS within that will perform IT
[1:13:04] BECAUSE ACTUALLY THE CHANGE BEGINS from
[1:13:07] the inside out.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not the other way. It ain't
[1:13:11] one day you get your body changed and
[1:13:13] then your soul will be saved. NO, YOUR
[1:13:15] SOUL IS SAVED AND THAT IS GOING TO
[1:13:17] CHANGE your body.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you're changed from the
[1:13:20] inside out. Now, I want to take a
[1:13:22] scripture that is very pertinent to the
[1:13:24] last days. And this is found in
[1:13:27] Revelation 7, and we're going to look at
[1:13:30] verse one through verse three. Now, as
[1:13:33] I'm saying this, as you know, the book
[1:13:36] of Revelation is the book of symbols.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; And so, it's a vision that God showed
[1:13:42] John, caught him up into this vision,
[1:13:44] showed him different events, and he
[1:13:46] shows him of this end time event. And he
[1:13:49] says, "After these things, I saw four
[1:13:52] angels standing on the four corners of
[1:13:54] the earth." Now, uh I I don't care how
[1:13:57] much you flatearthers think this don't
[1:13:59] make the earth flat.
[1:14:02] This is referring to the four directions
[1:14:05] of the earth for the north, south, east,
[1:14:07] and west. And and he's holding the four
[1:14:11] winds of the earth. Now, BROTHER
[1:14:12] BRANDHAM EXPLAINS THIS SYMBOLOGY, and he
[1:14:14] says winds are wars of strife.
[1:14:18] and and there is and he said that the
[1:14:21] earth the wind should not blow on the
[1:14:23] earth nor the sea nor any tree. So is
[1:14:26] something that is holding back they're
[1:14:29] holding back the the the wars of the
[1:14:32] earth. Actually, he'll take it even to
[1:14:34] the first world war and he'll talk about
[1:14:35] at the 11th day on of the on the 11th
[1:14:38] month, the 11th day and and and um you
[1:14:42] know at the 11th hour how that the the
[1:14:45] first world war was stopped before
[1:14:47] poisonous gas went all over the earth
[1:14:50] and and just mass destruction. God held
[1:14:52] it back and he said, "No, I you you
[1:14:55] can't destroy the earth yet.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; I've got to get a I got to get Israel
[1:15:00] back in her homeland.
[1:15:02] I I've got to get a bride in her place.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; You know, YOU CAN'T DESTROY THE EARTH.
[1:15:07] AND OF COURSE, WE'VE HAD OTHER WARS OF
[1:15:08] STRIFE, BUT IT'S HOLDING BACK. WHY
[1:15:11] HASN'T THERE COME THE BURNING OF THE
[1:15:13] EARTH YET? BECAUSE GOD'S been holding it
[1:15:15] back.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; So, you see there again, it was it was
[1:15:20] there. I SAW THIS ANOTHER ANGEL. NOW, we
[1:15:23] we see another angel coming from the
[1:15:26] east having the seal of the living God.
[1:15:30] And he cries with a loud voice to the
[1:15:32] four angels which to whom it was given
[1:15:35] to hurt the earth and the sea. Next
[1:15:37] verse saying hurt not the earth neither
[1:15:40] the sea nor the trees till we have
[1:15:42] sealed the servants of our God in their
[1:15:45] foreheads.
[1:15:47] Now, I want you to notice this real
[1:15:50] carefully because this is a critical
[1:15:55] part of end time events.
[1:15:58] And that IS SOMETHING THAT IS HAPPENING
[1:16:00] IN THE supernatural realm that is
[1:16:03] keeping the earth from being destroyed.
[1:16:06] THAT BEFORE THAT the winds of
[1:16:09] destruction are loose. BEFORE THE
[1:16:11] JUDGMENT FIRES SWEEP ACROSS THE EARTH,
[1:16:15] GOD COMMANDS THESE angels of WRATH TO
[1:16:18] HOLD BACK THE FOUR WINDS. WOW. BECAUSE
[1:16:22] there is a work of sealing yet to be
[1:16:25] done.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; And and THERE IS AN ANGELIC ANOINTING
[1:16:29] THAT MUST COME FIRST.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; I want you to see this. THIS IS SHOWING
[1:16:34] YOU. Give me the the verse before verse
[1:16:37] verse. Yeah. And I SAW ANOTHER ANGEL
[1:16:40] HAVING THE SEAL of the living God.
[1:16:43] NOTICE THIS IS AN ANGELIC ANOINTING
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; THAT is coming now from the east.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; And he has the seal of the living God
[1:16:52] because the you see THERE'S A WORK OF
[1:16:55] SEALING that has to be done. UH AN
[1:16:59] ANGELIC ANOINTING COME FIRST, AN
[1:17:02] OUTPOURING
[1:17:04] OF THE SEAL OF THE LIVING GOD upon his
[1:17:07] elect.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; NOW NOTICE THIS MIGHTY ANGEL. He ascends
[1:17:13] from the east. THE GOSPEL FIRST CAME OUT
[1:17:16] OF THE EAST AT Pentecost
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; when THE HOLY GHOST FELL IN THE UPPER
[1:17:21] ROOM. Can you say amen?
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; IT SEALED THE CHURCH WITH DIVINE FIRE.
[1:17:26] AND THAT SAME SPIRIT WHICH BEGAN IN
[1:17:28] JERUSALEM NOW RETURNS IN THE LAST DAY.
[1:17:32] NOTICE I I I want you to get this. The
[1:17:35] token comes in the evening time. THIS IS
[1:17:38] THE DAY OF THE FULLNESS of the Holy
[1:17:40] Ghost. THIS IS A TIME WHERE THE ANGEL
[1:17:43] COMES FROM the east.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WITH THE SEAL OF THE LIVING GOD.
[1:17:49] BRINGING THE SEAL BACK
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; THAT HAD BEEN LOST DOWN THROUGH THE
[1:17:55] AGES.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; THIS IS A DIVINE INJUNCTION BEFORE
[1:18:00] DESTRUCTION COMES. HERE HE COMES TO POUR
[1:18:03] OUT THE SEAL OF THE LIVING GOD. NOW I
[1:18:06] WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE GOSPEL FIRST
[1:18:08] CAME OUT OF THE EAST and when THE CHURCH
[1:18:11] WAS BORN ON the day OF PENTECOST AND IT
[1:18:14] SEALED THAT EARLY CHURCH WITH THE DIVINE
[1:18:16] FIRE OF GOD AND THAT SAME SPIRIT WHICH
[1:18:19] BEGAN AT JERUSALEM NOW RETURNS IN THE
[1:18:23] LAST DAY ASCENDING AGAIN TO FINISH THE
[1:18:27] WORK.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN. TO SEAL THE FINAL SERVANTS OF GOD
[1:18:31] BEFORE THE world's last shaking. Now let
[1:18:35] me tell you this is the token.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; This is the evening message to apply the
[1:18:39] token. You see in other times in other
[1:18:43] stages
[1:18:44] there was more than just applying the
[1:18:47] blood in that in that um the call of of
[1:18:50] out of Egypt to the promised land. And
[1:18:53] they had to leave out of Egypt under the
[1:18:55] token under the blood.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; And remember there were they had to take
[1:18:59] up the lamb. They had to examine the
[1:19:01] lamb. They had to keep him so many days.
[1:19:04] Right? He had to be judged and made sure
[1:19:07] that he was spotless lamb.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; All of this was part of the process.
[1:19:11] Then the lamb was then the the blood of
[1:19:14] the lamb, the final acts of the blood of
[1:19:16] the lamb applied.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; SO THERE'S BEEN OTHER ACTS OF THE WORK
[1:19:21] OF THE LAMB THROUGH the church ages
[1:19:24] where that where they they accepted the
[1:19:27] lamb. They judged him without blemish
[1:19:31] that HE WAS KEPT UP AND EXAMINED. AND SO
[1:19:34] THERE'S A TIME OF EXAMINING THE LAMB AND
[1:19:36] SAYING, "YEAH, YOU KNOW, HERE'S HIS
[1:19:38] WORKS. This is WHAT HE DOES." BUT IN THE
[1:19:40] LAST DAYS, IN THE EVENING time is the
[1:19:43] TIME WHERE THE TOKEN HAS TO BE APPLIED.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; THE LIFE OF THE BLOOD MUST COME BACK ON
[1:19:50] THE CHURCH, WHICH IS THE SEAL, THE
[1:19:53] MARKING OF GOD.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; NOW, SO AS YOU look at this, THIS IS THE
[1:19:58] TOKEN. THIS IS THE evening message. IT
[1:20:01] IS TO APPLY THE BLOOD, THE LIFE of
[1:20:03] Christ. Now, if you would look at verse
[1:20:06] four, I I want you to see this. And he
[1:20:09] said, "I heard the number of them which
[1:20:11] were sealed and it was sealed was
[1:20:13] 144,000." Now, we we know this is the
[1:20:16] Jews. We know this is to Israel.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Tim, how are you applying
[1:20:20] this to the bride? How in the world can
[1:20:22] you apply this? Because you got to
[1:20:25] understand that this ceiling in
[1:20:28] Revelation 7 is directed to the
[1:20:31] predestinated remnant of Israel, the
[1:20:33] 144,000, the fornown of God that's
[1:20:36] chosen to receive the mark of the spirit
[1:20:40] after THE BRIDE OF CHRIST IS TAKEN THEIR
[1:20:42] sealed during the tribulation for
[1:20:44] protection while the judgment falls. BUT
[1:20:48] IN THE BROADER SCOPE OF THE SCRIPTURE,
[1:20:51] every believer in this age,
[1:20:54] I want you to get this. Every believer
[1:20:56] in this age is sealed by the same
[1:20:59] spirit.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 4:30, which we read, GRIEVE
[1:21:04] NOT THE HOLY SPIRIT OF GOD, WHEREBY YOU
[1:21:06] ARE sealed
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; to the day of redemption. SO EVEN AS GOD
[1:21:12] TURNS TO SEAL THE NATURAL SEED OF
[1:21:15] ABRAHAM, HE REVEALS THE COMPLETION OF
[1:21:18] the redemption of the royal seed of
[1:21:21] Abraham. I want you to GET IT'S NOT JUST
[1:21:24] A NATURAL seed that is getting sealed.
[1:21:28] BUT IT'S ALSO THE ROYAL seed that is
[1:21:31] GETTING SEALED BECAUSE ALL OF US ARE
[1:21:34] ISRAEL.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THERE IS THE GENTILES, THE GENTILE
[1:21:38] BRIDE IS THE SPIRITUAL ISRAEL. THE THE
[1:21:40] THE JEWS ARE THE PHYSICAL ISRAEL. SO,
[1:21:44] you know, IF YOU SEE THEM IN THEIR
[1:21:45] HOMELAND, YOU SEE THE BRIDE COME IN
[1:21:47] THEIR HOMELAND. IF YOU SEE HER EXPELLED
[1:21:49] FROM THE NATIONS, UH THEN YOU SEE THE
[1:21:51] BRIDE EXPELLED FROM THE DENOMINATION. IF
[1:21:53] YOU SEE THE ATTACK COMING ON THEM IN A
[1:21:56] IN A PHYSICAL MANNER DRIVING THEM TO THE
[1:21:58] HOMELAND, YOU SEE THE ATTACK COMING
[1:22:00] against the bride in an ecclesiastical
[1:22:02] manner. You see, you see whatever is
[1:22:05] working in one is working in another. So
[1:22:07] if you see the Holy SPIRIT COMING AND
[1:22:09] ASCENDING FROM THE EAST
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; COMING THERE for where IT FIRST STARTED
[1:22:15] AND THE GOSPEL GOING NOW BACK TO THE
[1:22:17] JEWS AND THEN BEING SEALED, YOU KNOW,
[1:22:19] THEN THE GENTILES,
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; THE BRIDE
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; IS THE ONE IT'S REALLY SENT FOR
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; AND THAT IS TO BE SEALED TO THE DAY OF
[1:22:29] REDEMPTION.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? So, as we look at
[1:22:34] this, the bride of Christ is sealed by
[1:22:38] the Holy Ghost before the rapture
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; and the 144,000 Jews are sealed during
[1:22:46] the tribulation. And both carry the same
[1:22:49] principle. God is marking his own with
[1:22:52] his spirit for perseveration and for
[1:22:56] redemption. AMEN.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; THUS THE GENTILE AND the Jewish
[1:23:00] dispensations
[1:23:02] both close under the same divine
[1:23:05] operation,
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; THE COMING OF THE SEAL OF GOD.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE HOLY GHOST HIMSELF, NOT NOT
[1:23:12] NOT A FEELING, NOT A JUMP, NOT A SHOUT,
[1:23:15] NOT AN EMOTION, BUT HIMSELF.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; AND THIS OUTPOURING OF THE HOLY GHOST
[1:23:20] IDENTIFIES HIS OWN. AND IT happens in
[1:23:24] order to finish redemption. finish the
[1:23:26] redemption for both peoples,
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; the natural Israel and spiritual Israel.
[1:23:31] Now, so here again IS SCREAMING OUT,
[1:23:35] "HOLD BACK THE JUDGMENT UNTIL MY
[1:23:38] SERVANTS ARE SEALED with the Holy
[1:23:39] Ghost." Of course, the Jews are his
[1:23:41] servants, the Gentiles are his children,
[1:23:43] but both are sealed in this final act of
[1:23:46] redemption.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; AND WHERE DOES THE SEAL GO? BACK UP ONE
[1:23:51] VERSE. and and he said TILL WE HAVE
[1:23:53] SEALED THE SERVANTS OF GOD where
[1:23:57] in their foreheads now this is not a
[1:24:00] visible mark
[1:24:04] but it's the mind of Christ
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; the spirit's forehead of understanding
[1:24:10] as as Philippians 2:5 says let this mind
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; be in YOU
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS ALSO IN CHRIST Jesus
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; now this The true evidence of the Holy
[1:24:23] Ghost is not emotion or sensation,
[1:24:28] but revelation.
[1:24:31] IT'S THE MIND AND FAITH OF CHRIST
[1:24:33] BIRTHED INTO THE BELIEVER.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; AND IT CAUSES THE BRIDE TO BELIEVE THE
[1:24:38] word for her day TO THINK AS CHRIST
[1:24:42] THINKS, TO SEE AS CHRIST SEES, AND TO
[1:24:46] WALK IN FULL AGREEMENT with his revealed
[1:24:49] truth.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:51] Now, that's what you're wanting to see
[1:24:52] in your life.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, the Apostle Paul believed
[1:24:58] that the spirit they had received had
[1:25:00] given them the mind of Christ. Look at 1
[1:25:02] Corinthians 2:16. For who had known the
[1:25:04] mind of the Lord that he may instruct
[1:25:06] him? But we have the mind of Christ. So
[1:25:12] he definitely believed
[1:25:15] that the Holy Spirit that they had
[1:25:17] received had given them the mind, the
[1:25:21] thinking of Christ.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; And I want YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT'S WHAT
[1:25:25] THIS message is about.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; IT'S ABOUT REVEALING THE MIND OF CHRIST.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS IN GOD'S THINKING. THAT'S WHY
[1:25:36] WHEN HE REVEALS HIS THOUGHTS ABOUT YOU,
[1:25:39] HE TAKES YOU NOT AS YOU ARE NOW,
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT YOU WERE IN HIM
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; BEFORE THE FOUNDATION of the world.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; What is he doing? He's revealing his
[1:25:50] mind concerning you.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; THAT YOU MIGHT KNOW CHRIST'S MIND,
[1:25:56] CHRIST THOUGHTS OF YOU, THAT YOU WERE
[1:26:00] IDENTIFIED WITH HIM BEFORE YOU EVER
[1:26:02] SINNED. AMEN.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; You were his.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when you were unlovable,
[1:26:08] HE DIED for you.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN YOU WERE UNGODLY, HE REDEEMED
[1:26:12] YOU.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; AND HE DIDN'T DO IT BECAUSE YOU WERE
[1:26:15] GOOD. HE DID IT WHEN YOU WERE BAD.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE DIDN'T DO IT BECAUSE YOU WERE
[1:26:21] HOLY, BUT HE DID IT TO MAKE YOU HOLY.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; He didn't do it BECAUSE YOU WERE
[1:26:26] BLAMELESS, BUT TO MAKE YOU BLAMELESS.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; Unreprovable in his sight. Now, I don't
[1:26:31] care what the devil says as long as it
[1:26:34] I'm in his sight.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Too many of you say, "Well, the devil
[1:26:39] said to me, well, what did Jesus say?"
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; So, which word carries more weight?
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; What are what are you repeating even
[1:26:49] what the devil said?
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Why are you even entertaining what he
[1:26:53] said?
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; Throw it out.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; Cast it down. That's right.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; Now, this is a true mark. The inward
[1:27:05] seal that distinguishes the redeemed
[1:27:08] from the deceived as the mark of the
[1:27:10] beast, you know, identifies those
[1:27:13] conformed to the world system. THE SEAL
[1:27:15] OF GOD IDENTIFIES THOSE WHO ARE
[1:27:18] TRANSFORMED by the word. SO BEFORE THE
[1:27:21] WINDS of war blow, BEFORE THE FINAL
[1:27:23] JUDGMENTS COME, you know, GOD SENDS
[1:27:26] FORTH HIS SPIRIT ONE MORE TIME,
[1:27:28] ASCENDING FROM THE EAST with the seal of
[1:27:32] the living God. And he's marking his
[1:27:35] own, BOTH THE BRIDE and the Gentiles,
[1:27:39] dispensation, both of them, the remnant
[1:27:42] of Israel, BOTH OF THEM. IT DOESN'T
[1:27:44] MATTER WHETHER BRIDE OR OR THE REMNANT
[1:27:46] OF ISRAEL. THEY ARE BOTH SEALED WITH THE
[1:27:48] SAME HOLY SPIRIT THAT FELL AT PENTECOST.
[1:27:52] THE SAME SPIRIT THAT RAISED JESUS FROM
[1:27:54] THE DEAD
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; AND THE SAME LIFE THAT WILL CHANGE OUR
[1:27:57] MORTAL BODIES WITH THE TRUMPET SOUNDS.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; SO THE CEILING COMES FIRST, THEN THE
[1:28:04] STORM, AND THE BRIDE IS SEALED AND and
[1:28:08] raptured, then the judgment fall. The
[1:28:11] mark in THE FOREHEAD IS THE WORD MADE
[1:28:13] FLESH IN THE BELIEVER AND CHRIST
[1:28:16] REVEALED IN HIS OWN BODY. SO HE SAYS,
[1:28:19] "HURT NOT THE EARTH TILL WE HAVE SEALED
[1:28:21] HIS SERVANTS OF OUR GOD IN THEIR
[1:28:24] FOREHEAD." SO BEFORE THE DESTRUCTION,
[1:28:26] THERE'S REDEMPTION'S FINAL ACT. AND I
[1:28:29] WANT YOU TO GET IT. WE ARE IN
[1:28:31] REDEMPTION'S FINAL ACT.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AS HE CALLS OUT A PEOPLE FOR HIS
[1:28:37] NAME'S SAKE.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND AND THAT IS THE SEALING OF THE
[1:28:42] SPIRIT. THAT'S WHAT HE'S GOING FORTH TO
[1:28:43] do as he send the sealing angels as IN
[1:28:46] EZEKIEL CHAPTER 9. And he sends THE
[1:28:49] SEALING ANGELS TO MARK THOSE WHO SIGH
[1:28:52] AND CRY FOR THE abominations
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; that sin makes them sick.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; Now, so before the destruction,
[1:29:01] here comes the seal where in the
[1:29:04] forehead. And it's not a physical mark.
[1:29:07] It represents spiritual identification.
[1:29:11] It represents ownership. AND IN THE
[1:29:14] BIBLE, THE FOREHEAD SYMBOLIZES THE MIND,
[1:29:17] the seed of belief, conviction,
[1:29:18] allegiance, and and and Paul said,
[1:29:21] "Don't be don't be conformed TO THE
[1:29:24] WORLD, BUT BE TRANSFORMED
[1:29:26] BY THE RENEWING of your mind."
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, this sealed IN IS THE SPIRIT
[1:29:31] OF GOD MARKING THOSE who belong to him.
[1:29:35] Do you belong to him this morning?
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Well, then there's a mark upon your
[1:29:39] life. IT'S AN INVISIBLE BUT REAL
[1:29:42] identification in the realm of the of
[1:29:45] the of the soul.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; NOW, BEFORE THE JUDGMENT STRIKES, God
[1:29:51] commands his angels. I'm so glad he
[1:29:53] does.
[1:29:55] When we hear wars and rumors of wars,
[1:29:58] when we hear threats of nuclear
[1:29:59] destruction, when we hear of the trouble
[1:30:01] coming on this earth,
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; when we hear of the strife and the
[1:30:06] troubles, are you with me?
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Here, before it can even happen,
[1:30:10] God says, "Wait a minute. Don't allow
[1:30:12] them to hurt the earth.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Don't let them Don't let them destroy it
[1:30:18] until we have sealed the servants of the
[1:30:20] living God."
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this OF COURSE IS THE PATTERN
[1:30:26] THAT IS SHOWN IN THE TYPES OF THE
[1:30:27] SCRIPTURE LIKE EZEKIEL 9 AND 4-6. HE
[1:30:31] SAID GOD TOLD THE THE ANGELS TO SET A
[1:30:34] MARK ON THE FOREHEADS OF THE MEN WHO
[1:30:36] SIGH AND CRY FOR THE ABOMINATIONS.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; THOSE WITHOUT THE MARK, THEY WERE ALL
[1:30:42] DESTROYED. And the SAME PRINCIPLE
[1:30:45] APPLIES RIGHT HERE IN THE BOOK OF
[1:30:48] REVELATION. BEFORE THE WINDS OF JUDGMENT
[1:30:51] BLOW, GOD MARKS HIS OWN FOR DIVINE
[1:30:54] PROTECTION,
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; PRESERVING HIS OWN, SEALING THEM TO THE
[1:30:59] DAY OF REDEMPTION. AND THAT SEAL SAYS,
[1:31:02] "THESE ARE MINE.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; TOUCH THEM NOT."
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; JUDGMENT WILL NEVER STRIKE A CHILD OF
[1:31:10] GOD SEALED BY THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; You have passed from death into life.
[1:31:16] Amen.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; So you see again, the Lord knows them
[1:31:21] that are his
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; and he PUTS A MARK ON THEM
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; AND IT'S CALLED A SEAL. AND so you when
[1:31:28] we look in the the book of Revelation,
[1:31:30] YOU SEE ANOTHER MARK AND WE CALL THAT
[1:31:33] THE MARK OF THE BEAST AS it said and and
[1:31:36] it's to be in the right hand or the
[1:31:39] forehead. And the forehead IS THE
[1:31:41] BELIEF, THE DOCTRINE, THE MINDSET. AND
[1:31:44] AND THE BIBLE SAID THAT THESE HAVE ONE
[1:31:47] mind and give their power and strength
[1:31:50] unto the beast. And you can see those
[1:31:53] WHO ARE MARKED BY SATAN BECAUSE THEY
[1:31:56] give their mind AND THEIR POWER TO THE
[1:32:00] BEAST.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; And that's the way that you lived
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; IN THE FLESH
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; BEFORE CHRIST PUT A MARK ON YOU.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, you you live, YOU HAD YOU
[1:32:14] HAD A MIND and you gave WITH THAT WITH
[1:32:17] THAT MINDSET, YOU GAVE YOUR STRENGTH AND
[1:32:20] YOUR POWER TO THIS BEAST,
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; the flesh.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; And so will they in the tribulation.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; Now, the hand of course is deeds and
[1:32:30] actions and works. And God's seal and
[1:32:34] the forehead simply means the mind of
[1:32:35] Christ that governs the believer. and
[1:32:39] and they have received the word
[1:32:41] revelation sealed by the Holy Ghost. AND
[1:32:45] AND SATAN'S MARKED BY CONTRAST. It marks
[1:32:48] those whose thinking and ACTIONS ARE
[1:32:51] CONTROLLED BY THE ANTICHRIST SPIRIT. AND
[1:32:53] AND LISTEN, you're you're following one
[1:32:55] another, one or the other. YOUR MIND IS
[1:32:58] EITHER SET ON THE THINGS OF THE WORLD,
[1:33:00] WHICH IS DEATH, OR YOUR MIND IS SET ON
[1:33:02] CHRIST. AND IF YOU'VE BEEN REDEEMED, HE
[1:33:04] HAS SET YOUR AFFECTIONS ON THINGS THAT
[1:33:06] are above.
[1:33:09] That's where your desires are.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; It turned them all heavenly.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Now, so as you notice, THERE'S ALL KINDS
[1:33:17] OF TYPES IN THE BIBLE. WE WON'T go
[1:33:19] through them all, but just briefly touch
[1:33:20] them just for a minute. The blood on the
[1:33:22] doorpost in Egypt. And what was it? It
[1:33:26] was protection FROM JUDGMENT. WHEN I see
[1:33:28] the blood, I will pass over you.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; IT WAS THE FREE PASS OUT OF Egypt
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; into Canaan.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. That's what we need. You
[1:33:39] know, the token, THE FREE PASS OUT OF
[1:33:42] THIS WORLD OF EGYPT into glory.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; AGAIN, THE MARK ON THE FOREHEADS IN
[1:33:47] EZEKIEL 9 is was persuasion during uh
[1:33:51] the destruction OF JERUSALEM. SET A MARK
[1:33:54] ON THOSE WHO SIGH AND CRY FOR THE
[1:33:57] ABOMINATION THAT ARE DONE IN THE CITY.
[1:34:00] AND AND THE SEALING ANGEL WENT FORTH AND
[1:34:03] FINDING THOSE
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; THAT SIN made them sick.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; And that's an identification of a real
[1:34:10] Christian. Sin literally makes you sick.
[1:34:16] Now, of course, the seal in Revelation
[1:34:19] chapter 7 that we just read of the
[1:34:21] 144,000 during the tribulation um
[1:34:24] judgments and the same pattern, it runs
[1:34:28] through all dispensations.
[1:34:31] As I said before, the judgment fall, God
[1:34:35] marks his redeemed.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; And in this Friday, THE SEAL OF GOD IS
[1:34:41] THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. THAT IS
[1:34:44] GOD'S OWN LIFE. IT'S THE LIVING TOKEN
[1:34:47] THAT IDENTIFIES THE BELIEVER as God's
[1:34:51] possession.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; I want you to know if you've got the
[1:34:54] Holy Ghost, that's God saying, "You're
[1:34:55] mine.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; You belong to me.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; I'm your God. You're my people."
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now you see again as the scripture
[1:35:08] said in John for him whom the him hath
[1:35:12] God the father sealed. So the seal the
[1:35:16] seal in the forehead signifies the
[1:35:19] believer's mind HAS BEEN RENEWED BY THE
[1:35:21] WORD. THEIR LIFE IS FILLED BY THE
[1:35:24] SPIRIT. THEIR HEART IS UNDER DIVINE
[1:35:26] OWNERSHIP. And before THE WRATH IS
[1:35:29] POURED OUT, HE SEALS US SO THAT WHEN THE
[1:35:32] JUDGMENT STRIKES, WE'RE UNTOUCHED. WE'RE
[1:35:34] HIDDEN under the his covenant blood and
[1:35:37] by and in his by his indwelling spirit.
[1:35:40] I want you I want you to get the
[1:35:42] scripture. You know, brother Bradam
[1:35:44] preached the rapture from Psalms 27
[1:35:46] verse 5 well through 1-5. But let's just
[1:35:49] look at verse five. For in the time of
[1:35:52] trouble,
[1:35:55] in the time of trouble.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; And friends, friends, we're looking at
[1:36:00] the time of trouble.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Pre-tribulation strife is already
[1:36:04] striking the world.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; The winds are blowing.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. But there's something holding them
[1:36:11] back until that last one's sealed in.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Are you WITH ME? BUT IN THAT TIME, WHAT
[1:36:19] he will do? HE WILL HIDE me in his
[1:36:23] pavilion.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; In the secret OF HIS TABERNACLE SHALL HE
[1:36:28] HIDE ME. HE SHALL SET ME UPON A ROCK.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; So you see THIS IS WHAT HE DOES. He th
[1:36:36] this is referring to the holiest of
[1:36:38] holies. HE WILL HIDE YOU in his
[1:36:41] presence.
[1:36:45] THIS IS WHERE GOD'S GOT THE BELIEVER
[1:36:47] HIDDEN.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE DEAD AND YOUR LIFE IS HIDDEN IN
[1:36:51] GOD THROUGH CHRIST SEALED BY the Holy
[1:36:54] Spirit.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; So the forehead represents revelation. A
[1:36:58] mind illuminated
[1:37:01] and and it's illuminated by truth and a
[1:37:04] seal represents that spirit's indwelling
[1:37:08] power AND PROTECTION. SO, WHILE THE
[1:37:10] WORLD is marked and bearing the mark of
[1:37:14] the beast, there's another people ON
[1:37:17] EARTH
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; AND THEY'RE ALSO MARKED.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT THEY BEAR THE SEAL OF THE
[1:37:24] LIVING GOD, THE HOLY GHOST, UNTO THE DAY
[1:37:27] OF REDEMPTION. AMEN.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; Now look, we hear a lot about the image
[1:37:32] of the beast, the systems of man that
[1:37:35] are rising, the powers of deception that
[1:37:38] are forming all over the earth.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; Just got an article today, you know,
[1:37:42] where the the pope is is moved with
[1:37:45] ecumenical things, bringing all of the
[1:37:47] all the Protestants together.
[1:37:50] So the spirit of ecomunism isn't dead.
[1:37:52] They're they're working steadily. the
[1:37:55] cog the clogs the cogs of God's wheels
[1:37:59] of prophecies grind slow but sure
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; and and so you there are the powers of
[1:38:05] deception that are forming on the earth
[1:38:08] and that image is coming near and you
[1:38:12] can see it you can see it people are
[1:38:14] modeling it they're actually living
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; the image of the beast
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; you you know there you can see it in
[1:38:21] their dress you can see it in their
[1:38:24] music. You can see it in their spirit
[1:38:26] and you can see it in the moral collapse
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; all around us.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; The image of the beast is being made
[1:38:33] flesh.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; But if the image of the beast is coming
[1:38:37] to maturity, then the IMAGE OF CHRIST IS
[1:38:40] ALSO COMING NEAR.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; For the Bible said when the enemy comes
[1:38:44] in like a flood, then the spear OF THE
[1:38:47] LORD LIFTS UP A STANDARD AGAINST IT. SO
[1:38:50] YOU see before the image of the beast is
[1:38:52] enthroned THE IMAGE OF CHRIST WILL
[1:38:55] ALREADY BE WALKING UPON THE EARTH IN his
[1:38:58] bride.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. As brother Brandham SAID IN THESE
[1:39:03] LAST DAYS the true bride comes the
[1:39:06] headstone becoming the super church the
[1:39:08] super race as she nears that head that
[1:39:11] capstone revelation. THEY WILL BE SO
[1:39:14] MUCH LIKE HIM
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; THAT THEY WILL BE IN HIS VERY IMAGE,
[1:39:19] united with him as one, THE LIVING
[1:39:23] BREATHING MANIFESTATION of the word of
[1:39:25] the living God.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; Ah, what a promise.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; That means that image is not a creed or
[1:39:31] it's not a not a religion. It's a
[1:39:33] people.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; It's Christ living in his bride.
[1:39:38] And just as a world is growing more and
[1:39:40] more like the beast, the church is
[1:39:41] becoming more like our Lord.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; And you can see it. You can see the
[1:39:46] image of Christ being made flesh today
[1:39:49] in the what? You can see it, you know,
[1:39:53] in our behavior, in our walk, in our
[1:39:55] holiness, the way we live, the way we
[1:39:57] do. We can see it in in the modesty of
[1:40:00] her dress.
[1:40:03] you know, and I want to stop just for a
[1:40:05] moment and and just put a warning out
[1:40:07] there because I want to you to make
[1:40:10] certain what you're wearing reflects the
[1:40:13] image of Christ.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; You know, I you know, I I visited this
[1:40:19] fundraising event that on Friday and and
[1:40:24] thank you for all of you that did that
[1:40:25] for the young people. God bless you for
[1:40:27] it. It'll help them to go to camp. But
[1:40:30] there was um one of our
[1:40:34] visitors that came there to the
[1:40:37] fundraising event was a Pentecostal
[1:40:39] lady, I assume. I I didn't ask her what
[1:40:43] denomination she was of, but she wore no
[1:40:45] makeup. She had nice hair, was nicely
[1:40:48] dressed until she walked away. And there
[1:40:52] she had a slit in her skirt about
[1:40:54] halfway up her thigh. And I thought, my
[1:40:57] god, you go to all of that trouble to be
[1:41:00] modest and ruin it as you walk away with
[1:41:02] a slit exposing yourself.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; Goodness.
[1:41:08] You know, if you just read what the
[1:41:09] clothes designers say about the design,
[1:41:12] you know, I challenge you, do a little
[1:41:14] research before you wear some of these
[1:41:16] things that these designers put out. Do
[1:41:19] a little research. They'll tell you
[1:41:21] exactly. The slit is designed to catch
[1:41:24] the eye of the male for sex appeal. IT'S
[1:41:27] DESIGNED TO SHOW THAT FLASH OF LEG THAT
[1:41:29] moves in and out of the dress to draw
[1:41:31] attention of the male. And and and
[1:41:34] that's the design that is done by these
[1:41:37] perverts of Hollywood, these clothes
[1:41:39] designers. And and they themselves say
[1:41:42] this is why it's put there. I mean, it's
[1:41:45] no secret. You say, "Well, brother Tim,
[1:41:48] mine's below the knee." Well, problem is
[1:41:50] Satan in content to leave it below the
[1:41:52] knee
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; and he just keeps creeping up.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; And the designers to the designers say
[1:42:01] there's nothing more sexy than a sexy
[1:42:03] exit as a woman walks away with a slit
[1:42:06] in the back. And I'm just quoting what
[1:42:07] they say. That's their words.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm just telling you God didn't
[1:42:12] design them.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; They didn't come from the Bible
[1:42:15] holiness. And for the bride, you're
[1:42:17] going to see the image of Christ being
[1:42:19] made flesh today.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; And it will reflect in the modesty of
[1:42:24] her dress. I'm talking about the bride
[1:42:27] of Christ in the meekness of her spirit,
[1:42:30] in the purity of her worship, IN THE
[1:42:32] FAITHFULNESS OF HER TESTIMONY, IN HER
[1:42:34] BURNING LOVE FOR THE WORD OF GOD, AND
[1:42:37] THAT HOLY DETERMINATION DEEP WITHIN HER
[1:42:39] heart that says, "I'M GOING TO BE ONE OF
[1:42:41] THOSE THAT BREAKS THE CYCLE IN THIS AGE,
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; AND I'M NOT GOING WITH THE WORLD
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; AND BEING MARKED BY THE BEAST.
[1:42:49] I WILL MARK I WILL WEAR THE MARK OF
[1:42:52] CHRIST
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; and I will reflect his IMAGE IN MY LIFE.
[1:42:55] MY DRESS, MY BEHAVIOR AND MY BUSINESS
[1:42:58] DEALS. EVERYTHING THAT I DO, I will
[1:43:00] reflect Christ.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:43:04] as we are looking at this,
[1:43:08] I want you to underside
[1:43:14] whom the father is sealed. And we want
[1:43:16] to look and say, "But what is the
[1:43:18] evidence of that seal? How did I do I
[1:43:22] know?"
[1:43:25] And let's just go back for a moment.
[1:43:28] Let's just go back at Pentecost
[1:43:31] BECAUSE THE SEAL OF GOD CAME THERE AS
[1:43:35] the Holy Ghost fell as a consuming fire.
[1:43:39] It burned sin out of their lives. IT
[1:43:42] IGNITED THEM WITH OVERCOMING POWER. AND
[1:43:46] THOSE BELIEVERS, THEY STAGGERED OUT OF
[1:43:48] THE UPPER ROOM filled with new wine,
[1:43:51] drunk fully intoxicated
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; with with the spirit. THEY WERE
[1:43:56] GLORIFYING GOD IN OTHER LANGUAGES.
[1:43:59] AND THEN THEN OF COURSE WE KNOW WHAT
[1:44:02] happened that as time progressed the
[1:44:05] seed that was mature ready for rapture
[1:44:09] could have been raptured but was
[1:44:12] predestined to go in the ground because
[1:44:14] there were more names on the book that
[1:44:15] had to be manifested on the earth.
[1:44:18] And so the seed went in the ground and
[1:44:21] to the dark ages. And and so it
[1:44:25] deteriorated
[1:44:27] and and as it deteriorated then there
[1:44:31] came a LOT OF CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT the
[1:44:35] new birth is. What is the seal of God?
[1:44:39] And and AND OF COURSE IN THAT DARK TIME
[1:44:42] WHEN the seed was decaying,
[1:44:47] the proof of the spirit in that time for
[1:44:50] them was believed that you receive the
[1:44:54] catechism of Rome
[1:44:57] and the HOLY GHOST WAS SOMETHING THOUGHT
[1:45:00] that to be something imparted to you by
[1:45:04] the priest.
[1:45:06] BUT LUTHER CAME OUT and he WAS THE FIRST
[1:45:09] ONE OUT OF THAT DARKNESS.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; And he was nothing like the seed. It was
[1:45:15] the LIFE OF IT, BUT IT WASN'T THE SEED.
[1:45:17] It was a chute. It was a a blade. Now,
[1:45:20] it didn't look like Pentecost. And it
[1:45:22] wasn't Pentecost.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; It wasn't the original seed, the grain,
[1:45:27] I mean,
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; but it was had the life of it. And it
[1:45:31] was the spirit of God moving back toward
[1:45:34] the seed again which would come in the
[1:45:36] last day as and we would have again the
[1:45:39] seal of the living God. So Luther comes
[1:45:42] out of the dark AGES PROCLAIMING THE
[1:45:44] JUST SHALL LIVE BY FAITH. AMEN.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; And for the PEOPLE OF THAT TIME, THOSE
[1:45:50] early Lutheran, THOSE REBAPTIZERS WE
[1:45:54] CALL BAPTISTS NOW, you know, faith then
[1:45:57] became the evidence of the birth.
[1:46:02] Now, let me let me just tell you that's
[1:46:04] where A LOT OF MESSAGE BELIEVERS HAVE
[1:46:07] WENT BACK TO. WELL, if I just believe.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; And they don't realize that, you know,
[1:46:12] though they may have rejected the
[1:46:14] Pentecostal Isuza Street idea of
[1:46:17] speaking in tongues being the evidence,
[1:46:19] that they've actually went back and and
[1:46:21] progressed back several more church
[1:46:22] ages, back to Luther's time
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; AND AND FAITH NOW BECOMES THE EVIDENCE
[1:46:28] OF THE BIRTH because I believe. So I
[1:46:31] believe the message. So that's my
[1:46:33] evidence.
[1:46:35] Well, Wesley knew
[1:46:38] better than that when he came along. He
[1:46:40] said, 'Look, there's something wrong.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; You know, yeah, you believed. I'm saying
[1:46:45] your faith was genuine,
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; but there's some reason you're not
[1:46:48] living holy.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; There's impurities in the life of
[1:46:52] believers, and we need a good dose of
[1:46:54] sanctification.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; So, we we need to sanct be sanctified.
[1:46:59] Well, well, then they began to receive
[1:47:02] the blessing of sanctification.
[1:47:04] Now, I want you to get this.
[1:47:07] When that blessing came or WHEN THAT
[1:47:11] SANCTIFICATION CAME, many times it
[1:47:13] exhibit itself in demonstrative
[1:47:17] um actions such as fainting or falling
[1:47:20] out and and and
[1:47:23] you know they would just be so
[1:47:25] overwhelmed THEY WOULD JUST PASS OUT or
[1:47:28] maybe they would shout, you know, and
[1:47:30] and dance for glee.
[1:47:33] and and it wasn't long until some of
[1:47:37] them confused the emotion
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; with the with the actual cleansing
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; and so they were getting the emotion
[1:47:46] without getting the cleansing.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; SO THEY WERE SAYING IF YOU SHOUT YOU GOT
[1:47:50] IT. SO THE SHOUTING BECAME the evidence
[1:47:55] that WE HAVE NOW BEEN SANCTIFIED THAT WE
[1:47:57] FINALLY BEEN CLEANSED by the spirit.
[1:48:00] And of course, MANY OF THEM SHOUTED AND
[1:48:02] DIDN'T AND IT wasn't sanctified.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; SO YOU SEE, THEY LOOKED TO THE EMOTION
[1:48:08] THAT CAME WITH IT AND THOUGHT, WELL,
[1:48:10] WHEN YOU GET HAPPY and left enough to
[1:48:11] shout, you you got it. And and that
[1:48:14] became an evidence.
[1:48:16] And then, you know, WE COME NOW TO THE
[1:48:19] 20TH CENTURY. And in 1906, the spirit of
[1:48:23] God began to be poured out as the early
[1:48:26] rain. It was preparing the soil for the
[1:48:30] seed for an end time harvest.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; Now you know there were you know there
[1:48:36] there are rains that come or seasons of
[1:48:40] blessings
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; and there and and there was reigns of
[1:48:44] the spirit. Don't think of it as just
[1:48:46] only this last DAY BECAUSE THERE'VE BEEN
[1:48:48] REIGNS of the spirit
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; THAT THAT BROUGHT LUTHER UP. IT WOULD IT
[1:48:53] REQUIRED the rain of the spirit that
[1:48:55] caused him to get that revelation. The
[1:48:57] just shall live by faith. AND THEN
[1:48:59] ANOTHER REFRESHING COME WITH
[1:49:01] SANCTIFICATION. Another refreshing come
[1:49:03] which was the outpouring at Iusa Street
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; 1906.
[1:49:10] Now the problem is
[1:49:13] is THEY THOUGHT this was Pentecost
[1:49:19] and it wasn't. and they misnamed it
[1:49:24] Pentecost.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:49:34] this age started, and I'm quoting
[1:49:36] brother Brandham now in the church age
[1:49:38] book. THIS AGE STARTED just at the turn
[1:49:41] of the 20th century as it was to be the
[1:49:44] age when the true church would return to
[1:49:47] being the bride she was at Pentecost.
[1:49:50] Now, I don't know where you plan to aim
[1:49:52] up or aim to to to wind up, but I tell
[1:49:56] you the the true church must return to
[1:49:59] being the bride she was at Pentecost.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; Now, he says, as it was to be the age in
[1:50:06] which the true church would return to
[1:50:09] being in the bride she was at Pentecost,
[1:50:10] WE KNOW THERE must be a necessity, a
[1:50:14] return of dynamic power. And the
[1:50:17] believers sense this in their spirit and
[1:50:19] they begin to cry out to God for a new
[1:50:22] outpouring as it was in the first
[1:50:24] century. And what seemed
[1:50:27] to be the answer came as many began to
[1:50:31] speak in tongues and manifest gifts of
[1:50:33] the spirit. It was then believed that
[1:50:36] this was indeed the longawwaited
[1:50:38] restoration. It was not.
[1:50:44] For the latter RAIN CAN ONLY COME after
[1:50:46] the former rain, which is a spring or
[1:50:48] teaching rain. And the latter rain then
[1:50:51] is the harvest rain. And how could this
[1:50:52] be the real thing when the teaching rain
[1:50:54] had not come? The prophet messenger who
[1:50:57] was sent to teach the people and turn
[1:50:59] the hearts of the children back to the
[1:51:01] Pentecostal fathers had not yet come.
[1:51:05] THUS, WHAT WAS THOUGHT TO BE THE
[1:51:06] RESTORATION AND THE final quickening to
[1:51:09] the rapture had not come. And in it was
[1:51:11] a mixture of unrighteous protecting and
[1:51:15] spiritual blessings and manifesting in
[1:51:17] the Holy Ghost. As we kept pointing out
[1:51:19] to you, is also was devil power as men
[1:51:22] were under controls the devil. Yet no
[1:51:24] one seemed to realize it. And then to
[1:51:26] prove it was not
[1:51:29] the real.
[1:51:31] These people before the second
[1:51:33] generation had appeared organized
[1:51:36] and wrote their unscriptural doctrines
[1:51:39] and built their own fences as every
[1:51:41] other group ahead of them did. So,
[1:51:43] Brother Brandham says the THE REASON WE
[1:51:45] KNOW THEY WAS NOT the restoration
[1:51:48] because they organized.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; They set up decrees.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; And he said, "So, so as we're looking at
[1:51:59] this, I want you to get this. So because
[1:52:02] so what we're seeing was a true move of
[1:52:06] God. It was not Yeah. The devil got in
[1:52:09] it. Sure he did. Devil gets in all. THE
[1:52:11] DEVIL GOT IN THE METHODISTS. THE DEVIL
[1:52:13] GOT IN THE LUTHERAN. The devil got in
[1:52:14] the Pentecostals.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; But what we was seeing in each one of
[1:52:20] them was a true move of God.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; Don't ever think it wasn't.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. that and that true move of God
[1:52:31] came from that original birth of the
[1:52:35] seed there at as it come up from
[1:52:38] Pentecost
[1:52:39] and and came as a blade through Luther
[1:52:43] as A TASSEL THROUGH WESLEY AND and now
[1:52:46] Isusa Street would be just another stage
[1:52:50] of the wheat plant before the grain and
[1:52:54] it was the shock and and from that would
[1:52:58] come the grain. Now, brother Brandham in
[1:53:01] the resume of the ages, he says, "But
[1:53:03] what about the true seed?" It will
[1:53:05] happen just as we said. The people of
[1:53:07] God are being made ready by the word of
[1:53:10] truth from the messenger of this age. In
[1:53:13] her will be the fullness of Pentecost.
[1:53:16] For the spirit will bring the people
[1:53:19] right back to where they were at the
[1:53:22] beginning. THIS IS THUS SAID THE LORD.
[1:53:24] And he points it out from Joel chapter 2
[1:53:28] where he says um be GLAD CHILDREN OF
[1:53:31] ZION AND REJOICE FOR HEATH GIVEN YOU the
[1:53:33] former rain moderately and will because
[1:53:35] she comes down for you the rain the
[1:53:36] former rain and the and the latter rain
[1:53:39] in the first month. And and anyway he
[1:53:41] said God said THE CHURCH IS GOING TO BE
[1:53:44] RESTORED and he said the Lutheran age
[1:53:47] did not restore.
[1:53:49] THE WESTERLY AGE DID NOT RESTORE. THE
[1:53:53] PENTECOSTAL AGE DID NOT RESTORE. BUT GOD
[1:53:57] HAS TO RESTORE BECAUSE HE CAN'T DENY HIS
[1:54:00] WORD. This is not the resurrection of
[1:54:02] the church. It's the res restoration.
[1:54:05] GOD WILL TAKE THE CHURCH RIGHT BACK TO
[1:54:09] PENTECOST of the beginning.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; Now you can see it as we have just read
[1:54:15] it to you from Revelation chapter 7. SO
[1:54:18] THE ISUZA Street Pentecostals
[1:54:22] began to speak with tongues. And and let
[1:54:25] me tell you, church,
[1:54:27] they wasn't some madeup gibberish.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; They wasn't some manufactured thing by
[1:54:34] getting somebody at an altar and jerking
[1:54:35] their chin and saying words over and
[1:54:37] over.
[1:54:39] Listen,
[1:54:42] there were genuine manifestations of the
[1:54:45] spirit of God.
[1:54:48] You know, a Jew heard about it. I just
[1:54:51] telling you one testimony and there's
[1:54:52] thousands if you just read the history
[1:54:55] but a Jew walked into a meeting where in
[1:54:58] in Isuza street and he had heard about
[1:55:01] uh this um this outpour and he was he
[1:55:05] was a represent representative of a
[1:55:07] secret organization
[1:55:10] and and that was to to infiltrate some
[1:55:14] of these uh religious things in order to
[1:55:17] FIND OUT WHAT THEY were doing in order
[1:55:19] to warn the Jews. news about the the
[1:55:22] deception that was going on to keep them
[1:55:24] from being swept up into into fads of
[1:55:27] Christianity.
[1:55:29] AND SO THIS PHENOMENA WAS GOING ON. HE
[1:55:31] HEARD ABOUT IT AND and he went in there
[1:55:34] incognito,
[1:55:35] nobody knowing who he was, nobody know
[1:55:38] his name, his address, where he'd come
[1:55:40] from, anything. And he walks into there
[1:55:43] and and um you know, he hears praying
[1:55:46] that's going on, but hardly nobody in
[1:55:48] the little chapel there. and there was
[1:55:49] an upper room said somebody explained to
[1:55:51] him well they're up in this upper
[1:55:53] portion there and they're having a
[1:55:54] prayer meeting you're welcome to go up
[1:55:56] there. So he goes in there and as he
[1:55:59] walks in there's a 14-year-old girl
[1:56:03] begins to speak in other tongues
[1:56:07] and it's perfect Hebrew
[1:56:13] and it tells him his name
[1:56:17] and the the the religious system he's
[1:56:20] representing and what he's trying to do
[1:56:23] AND HIS WHOLE LIFE and and even his sins
[1:56:27] are exposed.
[1:56:31] And he goes to this girl and said,
[1:56:32] "Where did you learn Hebrew? And how did
[1:56:35] YOU KNOW MY NAME?" SHE SAID, "I don't
[1:56:37] know Hebrew. I DIDN'T KNOW I was
[1:56:39] speaking in Hebrews. I was speaking in
[1:56:41] tongues as the spirit gave me utterance.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; I I'm just telling you these were DON'T
[1:56:50] DON'T EVER MOCK IT.
[1:56:54] DON'T MAKE FUN OF IT.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; It was a move of God.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT IT WAS NOT THE RESTORATION.
[1:57:03] NOW, let me just get to you. And and to
[1:57:05] say they the Zeus of Pentecostals begin
[1:57:09] to speak with tongues. And to them, this
[1:57:12] was the evidence. [snorts]
[1:57:15] But tongues is not the evidence. It's
[1:57:18] just simply one of the manifestations.
[1:57:23] It's like me saying, you know,
[1:57:27] that hair is the evidence of a human.
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; Well, there's a lot of things that has
[1:57:35] hair that ain't human.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; But it's just one of the things that
[1:57:42] mammals have, right?
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; They have hair.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; It's not everything.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; It's just one of the things. And that's
[1:57:51] EXACTLY WHAT IT IS. THAT'S one of the
[1:57:54] manifestations
[1:57:55] of the spirit of God.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; NOW UNDER UNDERSTAND clearly then that
[1:58:01] tongues ARE A MANIFESTATION.
[1:58:04] THEY ARE NOT THE EVIDENCE.
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; They are the gift
[1:58:11] of the spirit.
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; They're not even the spirit
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; gifts. They're gifts from the spirit.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; They're a gift, NOT THE GUARANTEE. THE
[1:58:26] TRUE EVIDENCE IS NOT A SOUND FROM THE
[1:58:29] MOUTH,
[1:58:30] BUT IT'S A LIFE CHANGED BY THE WORD.
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; IT'S CHRIST FORMED IN THE HEART. IT'S
[1:58:36] IT'S THE FRUIT OF THE SPIRIT MANIFESTING
[1:58:38] CHARACTER.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; NOW, NO SCRIPTURE THERE. There is
[1:58:43] absolutely no scripture that ever
[1:58:46] declares tongues as the sole evidence of
[1:58:50] the Holy Ghost. No scripture. In fact,
[1:58:54] of the matter, Paul says in 1
[1:58:55] Corinthians 12:30, he says, "Do all
[1:58:59] speak with tongues
[1:59:01] with the obvious answer, no." Because he
[1:59:05] says, "Does all work miracles?
[1:59:08] You know, have all gifts of healing? Do
[1:59:11] all speak with tongues? Do all
[1:59:12] interpret? No. That's an obvious answer.
[1:59:17] So you see, no scripture declares that
[1:59:20] tongues is the sole evidence of the Holy
[1:59:23] Ghost. The Isuza Street movement,
[1:59:27] they'll build MOST OF ITS DOCTRINE
[1:59:28] AROUND THIS IDEA of speaking in tonesues
[1:59:31] as the initial evidence. In other words,
[1:59:33] it's the initial thing that happens
[1:59:36] when you receive the Holy Ghost. But I,
[1:59:39] you know, I want you to see the first
[1:59:41] time that the Holy Ghost came and
[1:59:44] possessed an individual. Now, I want you
[1:59:47] to get some real doctrinal truths right
[1:59:49] here.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; Because in the Old Testament, there was
[1:59:52] not a new birth.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; And yeah, they were filled with the
[1:59:57] spirit in the sense that they were
[1:59:59] anointed with the spirit, therefore,
[2:00:01] therefore used of the spirit. And so you
[2:00:04] will have THOSE LIKE EVEN JOHN THE
[2:00:05] BAPTIST FILLED WITH THE HOLY Spirit from
[2:00:07] his mother's womb which means he was
[2:00:09] anointed by the spirit of God from a
[2:00:12] baby.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; BUT TO BE POSSESSED BY THE HOLY SPIRIT,
[2:00:17] IT HADN'T YET been given.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; And the Bible's clear about that. Jesus
[2:00:23] very word says uh THE SPIRIT HAD NOT YET
[2:00:26] been given.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; So you see, and there's a reason for
[2:00:30] THAT. WE'LL GO INTO IT FOR a minute, but
[2:00:32] let's first of all go into this. The
[2:00:35] first time the Holy Ghost came was not
[2:00:39] on the day of Pentecost.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; The first time it came and remained was
[2:00:47] at the River Jordan.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; When it descended upon Jesus Christ like
[2:00:53] a dove,
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS THE ORIGINAL PATTERN. YES.
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; The original pattern of receiving the
[2:01:01] Holy Ghost is this. It happens to every
[2:01:03] individual that gets it. Heaven's open.
[2:01:06] The spirit descends
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; and God claims you as his son or
[2:01:10] daughter.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; Now, you may NOT HAVE A PROPHET SAYING
[2:01:14] IT. YOU MAY NOT HAVE A vision giving you
[2:01:16] the dove. YOU MAY NOT HEAR THE VOICE.
[2:01:18] BUT THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING.
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; Every person who EVER RECEIVES THE HOLY
[2:01:24] GHOST, THIS HAPPENS. HEAVEN OPENS.
[2:01:28] The spirit descends.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; It comes on you and remains.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; AND GOD IS DECLARING THIS IS MY SON.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; MY BELOVED SON, THE SON I LOVE.
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THIS COME ON SOMEBODY.
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHAT GOD IS DOING. AND THERE IS
[2:01:46] THE FIRST TIME THE HOLY SPIRIT CAME AS
[2:01:51] HE SAID to John when you the the one you
[2:01:53] see THE HOLY SPIRIT COME upon and
[2:01:57] remain.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; [crying]
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; Now, so the original pattern of the Holy
[2:02:07] Ghost coming to dwell in man was at the
[2:02:11] River Jordan, not the day of Pentecost,
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; that's where it came into men,
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; but it came into the man Christ Jesus,
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; WHICH WAS WHICH WAS BORN OUTSIDE OF SEX.
[2:02:29] SOMEBODY HELP me now.
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; AND NOW AS A VIRGIN BORN CHILD OF GOD,
[2:02:35] THE SPIRIT LED him there and he
[2:02:37] surrendered HIMSELF AND HE WAS BAPTIZED
[2:02:39] IN OBEDIENCE TO THE WORD. AND IN HIS
[2:02:41] OBEDIENT ACT, God filled him with the
[2:02:44] Holy Ghost.
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; Now
[2:02:52] notice this. Jesus did not speak in
[2:02:56] tongues.
[2:02:59] That was not the evidence of his
[2:03:02] infilling.
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; So I want to ask you, what was the
[2:03:05] evidence of his infilling?
[2:03:09] The real evidence, the true seal of the
[2:03:12] spirit was shown when Jesus was led into
[2:03:16] the wilderness and confronted the devil
[2:03:19] face to face.
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; And he in every temptation, in every
[2:03:25] way, he overcame. HE RESISTED SATAN'S
[2:03:28] LIES. HE DIDN'T SIN. HE DIDN'T WHAT I
[2:03:31] MEAN he didn't sin. HE DIDN'T DISBELIEVE
[2:03:33] THE WORD. HE STOOD FIRMLY ON WHAT WAS
[2:03:37] WRITTEN AND SAID, "It's written."
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; NOW, THAT'S THE EVIDENCE. A LIFE THAT
[2:03:43] CAN FACE THE ENEMY AND STAND UNSHAKEN ON
[2:03:47] THE WORD.
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; That's what you WANT TO SEE IN YOUR
[2:03:50] LIFE. Tongues are a gift. YES. BUT THE
[2:03:53] TRUE EVIDENCE of the Holy Ghost is a
[2:03:56] VICTORIOUS LIFE. A LIFE THAT RESISTS
[2:03:59] SIN, A life that BELIEVES THE WORD THAT
[2:04:03] OVERCOMES THE DEVIL.
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; HELLO.
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YET, despite the word's clear
[2:04:11] teaching, this this movement formed a
[2:04:14] doctrine. I'm talking about the Isuza
[2:04:16] movement. And when they formed a when
[2:04:18] they did that, they it signals death.
[2:04:22] They organized around it.
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; And and when man organizes around a
[2:04:27] partial truth and makes it the
[2:04:29] requirement of salvation and fellowship,
[2:04:32] they have left the leadership of the
[2:04:34] spirit and entered into spiritual death.
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; And I want to show I WANT TO SHOW YOU
[2:04:41] WHERE THAT WENT TO.
[2:04:43] I want to show you where that went to.
[2:04:45] Yes. Originally, genuine gifts. And I'm
[2:04:49] not even saying there's not any genuine
[2:04:52] gifts
[2:04:54] because I I I BELIEVE THEY CAN STILL
[2:04:56] SPEAK with genuine tongues.
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about in Isusa Street.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; They can still speak with genuine
[2:05:04] tongues,
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; but not all. Because I'm going TO TELL
[2:05:08] YOU WHY. THEY HAD SO MANY BECAUSE OF
[2:05:11] THIS requirement of of salvation being
[2:05:14] speaking in tongues. And the scripture
[2:05:16] IS CLEAR THAT ALL DON'T SPEAK WITH
[2:05:18] TONGUES.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; EVERYBODY DON'T RECEIVE THAT one
[2:05:25] particular gift.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; So what did they do? THEY HAD TO FORCE
[2:05:32] IT upon the people. In other words, it
[2:05:35] was it was taught and there would be
[2:05:37] many people that was Christian people.
[2:05:39] Brother Jimbo, you know this Christian
[2:05:41] people, godly people lived right. uh
[2:05:44] dinner that but couldn't speak with
[2:05:45] tongues
[2:05:47] and they pray and pray and pray and
[2:05:48] couldn't speak with tonesues
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; and they never prayed through as they
[2:05:52] called into speaking in tongues and so
[2:05:55] what you know in the 1950s
[2:05:58] because I I was born in 54 so even it
[2:06:02] was going on in the 60s when I was old
[2:06:04] enough to remember you know there were
[2:06:06] moves that would began to go through
[2:06:09] sweeping through the movement the
[2:06:10] Pentecostal movement while we have 50
[2:06:13] that was filled with the Holy Ghost.
[2:06:15] Last night we had a hundred over here
[2:06:16] that was filled with the Holy Ghost. WE
[2:06:18] HAD OH, WE'RE HAVING great revival. You
[2:06:20] know why? Because one of those preachers
[2:06:22] figured out how to get these people that
[2:06:25] were living Holy Ghost filled lives that
[2:06:29] were living triumphant Christian lives.
[2:06:31] Figured out how to get them speak in
[2:06:33] tongues. And that was to get them to the
[2:06:34] altar and say a word over and over and
[2:06:36] over again until they got a confusion of
[2:06:39] language.
[2:06:40] So they would say Jesus until they've
[2:06:43] spoken in what they called other
[2:06:45] tongues. And so much of the tongues even
[2:06:49] John G. Lake said most much of our
[2:06:51] tongues are now rattly and not genuine.
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; He began to see it move and it WAS
[2:06:56] BECAUSE THEY REQUIRED EVERYBODY TO SPEAK
[2:06:59] IN OTHER TONGUES. SO THEY HAD TO
[2:07:02] MANUFACTURE IT
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; AND IT CAUSED BABYLON CONFUSION.
[2:07:10] a confusion of languages.
[2:07:13] Now again they and and and they took the
[2:07:19] letter of of their of their doctrine and
[2:07:23] killed with it and it looked like a
[2:07:26] return to Pentecost but it proved it
[2:07:28] wasn't. It couldn't be BECAUSE IT
[2:07:30] ORGANIZED AROUND A falsehood and that's
[2:07:33] death not life. IT LOOKED SO CLOSE THAT
[2:07:36] MULTITUDES WERE DECEIVED. But it was the
[2:07:39] chaff.
[2:07:41] IT WAS THE CHAFF OR THE SHUCK, not the
[2:07:44] grain. And yet it looked good. And it
[2:07:47] had the sounds and the energies of
[2:07:50] revival.
[2:07:51] IT HAD GIFTS OF THE SPIRIT. It had
[2:07:53] miracles. It it came with shouting AND
[2:07:56] GREAT JOY. AND IT LOOKED LIKE A return
[2:07:59] to Pentecost, but it proved it wasn't
[2:08:02] because it organized. IT FORMED A SYSTEM
[2:08:05] OF MAN AROUND A MANIFESTATION INSTEAD
[2:08:08] INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING THE PERSON OF
[2:08:10] CHRIST THROUGH HIS WORD. AND IT WAS not
[2:08:12] the grain.
[2:08:14] It was a husk. It was the chap. And then
[2:08:16] to PROVE IT, THERE WAS SO SET THAT WHEN
[2:08:19] GOD DID SEND THEM A PROPHET with
[2:08:22] correction of THE WORD OF GOD, THEY
[2:08:24] TURNED IT DOWN.
[2:08:26] That's true.
[2:08:27] &gt;&gt; NOW AGAIN YOU SEE AND TO DO WHEN THEY
[2:08:31] DID THEY DIED [screaming] BECAUSE THE
[2:08:33] HUSK WILL DRY UP AS THE GRAIN matures
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; and in ITS GRAIN BUT IN ITS GRAIN STATE
[2:08:40] THE HUSK LOOKS IDENTICAL ALMOST
[2:08:43] IDENTICAL TO THE GRAIN. It even will
[2:08:45] protect the seed for a time. It would be
[2:08:48] it would be the the group of people that
[2:08:50] GOD WOULD SEND A PROPHET TO AND OUT OF
[2:08:53] THERE WOULD COME A MESSAGE AND CALL A
[2:08:55] BRIDE. OUT OF THAT WOULD COME A GRAIN.
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; NOW, so you see, BUT IT'S NOT THE LIFE.
[2:09:02] It's and IT CANNOT BE THE FINAL FRUIT.
[2:09:07] LISTEN, Matthew 3:12 SAID, "HE WILL
[2:09:10] GATHER HIS WHEAT into the garner."
[2:09:12] That's the rapture. But he will BURN UP
[2:09:14] THE CHAFF WITH UNQUENCHABLE FIRE. That's
[2:09:17] the tribulation.
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; So what was this hus movement of the
[2:09:23] Isuza Pentecost?
[2:09:26] It was a necessary part.
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; You know, YOU CAN'T LOOK BACK AT AND
[2:09:31] SAY, "OH, THEY WERE NOTHING." OH, NO.
[2:09:33] THEY WERE. They were the move of God.
[2:09:40] Listen, God would use those men
[2:09:44] even in the infancy of this message TO
[2:09:48] HELP HELP BROTHER BRANDHAM ORGANIZE the
[2:09:51] meeting or set up his campaigns. Print
[2:09:54] the books,
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; give the testimonies of the miracles,
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; WRITE A MAN SENT FROM GOD. AMEN.
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; PUT out books, you know, booklets of his
[2:10:06] sermons and and and get THE THE PILLAR
[2:10:09] OF FIRE PICTURE AUTHENTICATED.
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; GOD WOULD USE THOSE MEN. THEY WERE THEY
[2:10:15] WERE PART OF THE MOVE OF GOD.
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; But there come a time of maturity where
[2:10:21] IT SEPARATED THE CHAFF FROM the grain.
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; Now
[2:10:30] you see
[2:10:32] It's it's was the sheath. IT WAS THE
[2:10:34] SOFT OUTER FORM. IT LOOKED LIKE THE REAL
[2:10:37] THING, BUT INSIDE THERE WAS NO MATURE
[2:10:40] SEED,
[2:10:42] but it could not be back to the original
[2:10:44] until the word was restored. I I want
[2:10:47] you to get that
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET HAD NOT COME ON THE SCENE.
[2:10:51] AND and but according to the TIME THAT
[2:10:54] WE NOW stand here in this last age,
[2:10:58] the prophet messenger of Revelation
[2:11:01] 10:7, he's already sounded his message.
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; AND ONCE MORE, WE HAVE THUS SAYETH THE
[2:11:08] LORD. AMEN. And it's it's it was PROVEN
[2:11:12] WITH INFALLIBLE VINDICATION.
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW THAT. AMEN.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; AND SO THUS WE'RE NOW IN A TIME WHERE
[2:11:20] THE true seed is is already maturing.
[2:11:23] And of course, WE ARE NOW IN THE HARVEST
[2:11:26] CYCLE. THIS IS THE BRIDE AGE. THIS IS
[2:11:29] THE RAPTURE AGE. THIS IS BRIDE TIME. So
[2:11:33] as brother Brandham said in the church
[2:11:34] age book, and I quote now, Luther had
[2:11:37] the spirit of God, but his age was not
[2:11:40] the age of full re restoration by
[2:11:42] another outpouring like in the
[2:11:44] beginning. It was the same with Wesley,
[2:11:46] Booth, Knox, Whitefield, Brainard,
[2:11:49] Jonathan Edwards, Mueller, and so forth.
[2:11:52] Surely they were full of the Holy Ghost.
[2:11:54] Yes, they certainly were. But in the age
[2:11:56] in which they live was not the age of
[2:11:59] restoration. Neither was any AGE BUT
[2:12:01] THIS LAST AGE, THE AGE OF COMPLETE
[2:12:05] BLACKOUT IN APOSTASY. This is the age of
[2:12:08] apostasy. And this is the age of the
[2:12:11] restoration. It is the age of the
[2:12:14] finished cycle and with this it's all
[2:12:17] over.
[2:12:18] AGAIN HE WOULD SAY in the sardanian
[2:12:20] churches and the way that IT WAS DONE BY
[2:12:22] GOD'S PERFECT will and programming the
[2:12:25] Lutheran had the Holy Ghost potentially
[2:12:28] under justification. The Methodists had
[2:12:31] it potentially under sanctification and
[2:12:34] to he and today it has brought back a
[2:12:37] restoration. THE HOLY GHOST IS HERE.
[2:12:40] AMEN.
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; Let me read that again. The Lutherans
[2:12:46] had the Holy Ghost potentially
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; under justification.
[2:12:51] &gt;&gt; That was a work of the spirit.
[2:12:53] &gt;&gt; The Methodists had it potentially under
[2:12:56] this sanctification, a deeper work of
[2:12:58] the spirit.
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; AND TODAY IT IS BROUGHT BACK A
[2:13:03] RESTORATION.
[2:13:05] THE HOLY GHOST IS HERE.
[2:13:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO, WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR ANOTHER
[2:13:11] REVIVAL OF EMOTION. ALTHOUGH, let me
[2:13:14] tell you, there will be great emotion.
[2:13:17] There will BE GREAT JOY.
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE IT'S THE SOUND OF
[2:13:22] THE HARVEST.
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THERE'S REJOICING IN THE
[2:13:28] TIME OF THE HARVEST.
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE TIME WHERE THE WORD IS BEING
[2:13:32] RESTORED.
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when it's restored, AMEN.
[2:13:38] DAVID DANCED BEFORE THE ARK.
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; DAVID'S SAYING THEY REJOICED.
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE IN THE SPIRIT.
[2:13:46] &gt;&gt; SO, WELL, NOW THAT'S WHY A MAN DIED. NO,
[2:13:48] IT WASN'T BECAUSE THEY WERE DANCING
[2:13:49] REJOICING BECAUSE THEY BROUGHT IT ON A
[2:13:50] MAN-MADE CART.
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; THEY DIDN'T CONSULT THE WORD IN THE WAY
[2:13:55] TO BRING BACK. AND YOU CANNOT BRING BACK
[2:13:57] PENTECOST.
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; YOU CANNOT BRING BACK THE MERCY SEAT.
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; YOU CANNOT BRING BACK THE BLOOD
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; ON A MAN-MADE SYSTEM.
[2:14:07] THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN BRING IT BACK IS BY
[2:14:10] A PROPHET AUTHENTICATED WORD.
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT TELLS YOU THE INSTRUCTION IS
[2:14:16] GOT TO BE CARRIED UPON THE HEART. ONLY
[2:14:19] THE HEART CAN CARRY THE MERCY SEAT.
[2:14:23] &gt;&gt; Only the heart can restore the word.
[2:14:26] &gt;&gt; You can't bring it back.
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; It's got to be restored upon the heart.
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; Therefore, brought to its place.
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:36] It had to be brought back on the
[2:14:38] shoulders of the priesthood.
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; And you're the priesthood.
[2:14:45] &gt;&gt; GOT TO BE PUT OVER THE HEART. IT'S GOT
[2:14:47] TO CHANGE THE LIFE.
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; AND IT CAN'T COME ON A MAN-MADE CART
[2:14:51] LIKE THE PHILISTINES DID. IT
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; David was trying to BRING IT BACK THAT
[2:14:56] WAY. AND SO HAVE THEY DONE IN ALL THESE
[2:14:58] OTHER MOVEMENTS WITH ALL their emotion,
[2:15:00] BUT THEY DIDN'T BRING BACK THE ARK
[2:15:03] &gt;&gt; THAT CAUSED DEATH.
[2:15:06] OF INNOCENT PEOPLE. ARE YOU WITH ME?
[2:15:08] &gt;&gt; BUT WE COME BACK TO THE LAST DAY AND I
[2:15:10] WANT YOU TO GET THIS. AMEN. IS NOW IT IS
[2:15:14] A TIME WHERE THE WORD IS BEING RESTORED
[2:15:17] BY [screaming]
[2:15:18] THE AUTHENTICATED MESSENGER
[2:15:21] &gt;&gt; WHO SAYS NOW UPON THE HEART OF THE
[2:15:24] BELIEVER IS WHERE THE HOLY GHOST HAS GOT
[2:15:26] TO BE PLACED. AND THAT'S WHEN THE ART OF
[2:15:29] THE WORD CAN BE PUT BACK AND BROUGHT
[2:15:31] BACK. HERE IS WHERE FULL RESTORATION
[2:15:33] COMES. AMEN.
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; So it wasn't because they jumped and
[2:15:36] shouted. They jumped and shouted both
[2:15:39] times.
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; We have emotion. We should have emotion.
[2:15:45] &gt;&gt; Brother, we are the people of the new
[2:15:47] wine.
[2:15:49] &gt;&gt; We are the people that he said don't
[2:15:50] hurt the oil in the wine.
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; We are the people. Come on, somebody.
[2:15:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Have got the word in the spirit.
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; BUT WE'RE NOT ANOTHER REVIVAL OF OF
[2:16:00] EMOTION. We are looking for the ripened
[2:16:04] grain, A WORDBORN BRIDE FULL of spirit
[2:16:09] AND TRUTH WITH SIGNS. OH YES, WITH
[2:16:12] SIGNS. THESE SIGNS SHALL FOLLOW THEM
[2:16:15] THAT BELIEVE.
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; BUT NOT SIGNS ALONE, BUT CHARACTER,
[2:16:19] POWER, DISCERNMENT. THE BRIDE WILL
[2:16:22] MIRROR THE ORIGINAL SEED.
[2:16:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOT JUST IN NOISE AND EMOTION, BUT
[2:16:28] IN NATURE. They'll have the nature of
[2:16:31] Christ.
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; SO I SAY WITH THIS WITH URGENCY THIS
[2:16:35] MORNING, DON'T SETTLE FOR THE HUSK.
[2:16:37] DON'T STOP AT A SHOUT
[2:16:39] &gt;&gt; OR A TONGUE OR THE THRILL OF SENSATION
[2:16:43] AND AND DON'T DRY [screaming] UP IN
[2:16:45] FORMALISM LIKE THE HUSK. THERE'S A
[2:16:48] DANGER EITHER WAY. I KNOW WE ALWAYS
[2:16:51] POINT, OH THE EMOTION, EMOTION. I TELL
[2:16:53] YOU WHAT'S WORSE IS YOUR formalism
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; because it's BETTER TO HAVE WILDFIRE
[2:17:00] than no fire.
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; FORMALISM, YOU MIGHT AS WELL BE A
[2:17:06] CATHOLIC CHURCH.
[2:17:09] &gt;&gt; TAKES THE SHOUT THE GLORY OUT OF IT.
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; TAKES THE REJOICING out of it
[2:17:13] &gt;&gt; while the seals are open. Brother Tim,
[2:17:15] we're mature people. And when the seals
[2:17:17] were open in heaven, everything said
[2:17:19] amen. Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[2:17:22] THERE WAS A REVIVAL GOING ON IN HEAVEN
[2:17:25] AND THAT'S ONLY A REFLECTION OF WHAT
[2:17:27] SHOULD BE GOING ON ON EARTH BECAUSE WE
[2:17:29] ARE REFLECTION OF GLORY. [applause]
[2:17:36] &gt;&gt; BUT I WANT TO SAY DON'T IDOLIZE
[2:17:39] EXPERIENCES.
[2:17:40] &gt;&gt; RETURN TO THE WORD MADE FLESH.
[2:17:48] &gt;&gt; And we'll do that sometimes. You'll see
[2:17:49] people idolize them. They see somebody
[2:17:51] do this and get blessed that way. They
[2:17:53] try to do the same thing. We don't need
[2:17:55] impersonators.
[2:17:57] &gt;&gt; Our imitators,
[2:18:00] &gt;&gt; let God say, "Well, Brother Tim, I never
[2:18:02] shout." Well, you don't have to.
[2:18:05] &gt;&gt; Some people cry. Well, I don't ever cry.
[2:18:08] Well, I you know, maybe you just sit
[2:18:10] there stunned.
[2:18:13] &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE HOW YOU DO IT.
[2:18:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN. TODAY, YOU KNOW, DON'T IDOLIZE AN
[2:18:19] EXPERIENCE.
[2:18:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN. JUST RETURN TO THE WORD MADE
[2:18:23] FLESH. IT'S THE WORD MADE FLESH IN YOU.
[2:18:25] THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO LOOK AT.
[2:18:30] &gt;&gt; You see, the Bible said in John 8:31,
[2:18:33] "If you continue in my word, then you
[2:18:36] are my disciples indeed."
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; Sanctify them through thy truth. John
[2:18:42] 17:17. Thy word is truth. So be washed
[2:18:45] by the washing of the water by the word.
[2:18:48] Now this is this is what you know even
[2:18:51] sermons like I did last Sunday and even
[2:18:52] this morning is washing.
[2:18:56] But I I want to I want to I want to
[2:18:59] bring out something very very important.
[2:19:03] And maybe this is as far as I'll get
[2:19:05] today. I'm not sure how how deep I'll
[2:19:10] get into this. I've got lots I want to
[2:19:12] say.
[2:19:14] But there is a difference
[2:19:16] between the anointing of the spirit
[2:19:20] and the seal of the spirit.
[2:19:25] &gt;&gt; But both are needed.
[2:19:35] And it seemed like we can't keep a
[2:19:38] balance in the message
[2:19:42] because we will castigate the anointing
[2:19:45] of the spirit and make it worthless and
[2:19:47] and without value and say all we need is
[2:19:50] just the seal. Well, you do need the
[2:19:52] seal and without it, you're not going.
[2:19:59] But the Bible said, "He that hath
[2:20:01] anointed us has also sealed us."
[2:20:07] &gt;&gt; But there is a difference between the
[2:20:09] anointing
[2:20:11] and
[2:20:14] the seal and both are needed. Now let's
[2:20:18] just dive into the details. Let's look
[2:20:20] at this.
[2:20:22] Scriptures clearly distinguishes
[2:20:25] between being anointed with the spirit
[2:20:27] and being filled with the spirit. And
[2:20:29] the these sometimes will actually
[2:20:32] overlap in in purpose, but they're not
[2:20:35] identical in measure or relationship or
[2:20:37] indwelling. In the Old Testament, the
[2:20:40] spirit of God would come upon men and
[2:20:42] women. It would anoint them for a task.
[2:20:46] &gt;&gt; It would empower them for a mission. IT
[2:20:48] WOULD INSPIRE THEM TO SPEAK.
[2:20:51] But in the New Testament, John the
[2:20:54] Baptist introduced a new and a greater
[2:20:57] dimension of the spirit's work. Now, I
[2:21:00] want you to listen carefully. John 1:33
[2:21:05] says, "He that sent me to baptize with
[2:21:07] water, the same said to me, upon whom
[2:21:10] thou seeth the spirit descending and
[2:21:13] remaining
[2:21:15] on him, the same as he which baptized
[2:21:19] with the Holy Ghost.
[2:21:21] Now,
[2:21:23] are you going to stop just for a minute
[2:21:25] and let's just talk about this
[2:21:27] descending and remaining? Because the
[2:21:29] spirit of God would descend upon Moses
[2:21:33] and and and and would come upon him, but
[2:21:36] then the spirit would leave.
[2:21:41] &gt;&gt; It could not possess
[2:21:44] an individual until it had been
[2:21:47] purchased. Amen.
[2:21:49] &gt;&gt; He won't possess the devil's property.
[2:21:55] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:21:56] &gt;&gt; So, you would have men in the Old
[2:21:59] Testament who would be anointed with the
[2:22:02] spirit for a mission, for a purpose,
[2:22:04] WOULD BE INSPIRED TO SPEAK, would speak
[2:22:07] prophetical word, dynamic words.
[2:22:11] Now I want you to notice HE SAID THE ONE
[2:22:14] THAT YOU see
[2:22:17] that you shall see the spirit descended
[2:22:18] and reign on it is the same the SAME AS
[2:22:23] HE WHICH BAPTIZES WITH THE HOLY GHOST.
[2:22:26] Now here's where we get the word baptism
[2:22:28] of the Holy Ghost. It means an
[2:22:30] immersion.
[2:22:32] &gt;&gt; It means to BE COMPLETELY SATURATED.
[2:22:36] AMEN.
[2:22:37] &gt;&gt; It means to be filled with the spirit.
[2:22:42] &gt;&gt; And he SAID, "NOW THE ONE YOU see the
[2:22:44] spirit descending and remaining, he's
[2:22:47] the one
[2:22:49] &gt;&gt; that is GOING TO IMPART
[2:22:51] THE BAPTISM
[2:22:53] or the immersion into the spirit."
[2:22:58] &gt;&gt; Now, this had never happened.
[2:23:02] John speaking of this coming Messiah,
[2:23:04] the Christ, which means anointed one,
[2:23:07] that he would not merely anoint men, but
[2:23:10] he would immerse them into the very life
[2:23:13] of the spirit himself.
[2:23:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:16] &gt;&gt; So in Matthew 3:11, he said, "I indeed
[2:23:20] baptize you with water unto repentance,
[2:23:23] BUT HE THAT COMETH after me shall
[2:23:25] baptize YOU WITH THE HOLY GHOST AND with
[2:23:27] fire.
[2:23:32] NOW, THIS WAS SOMETHING ENTIRELY NEW.
[2:23:38] The prophets had been anointed. The
[2:23:41] judges were empowered. The kings were
[2:23:43] overshadowed.
[2:23:45] But none had ever been indwelt.
[2:23:48] &gt;&gt; The spirit could visit, but he couldn't
[2:23:50] abide.
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE UNTIL JESUS SHED his blood,
[2:23:56] there was no perfect atonement.
[2:23:59] The blood of bulls and goats could not
[2:24:02] COULD NEVER REMOVE SIN COULD ONLY cover
[2:24:04] it.
[2:24:05] &gt;&gt; AND THE HUMAN HEART REMAINED
[2:24:07] unregenerated and unfit for the
[2:24:10] permanent indwelling of the spirit of
[2:24:12] God.
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; But when Jesus cried, "It is finished."
[2:24:17] WHEN THAT VEIL WAS TORN, THERE WAS A WAY
[2:24:21] THAT WAS MADE INTO THE holiest and it
[2:24:24] WAS OPENED AND THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST
[2:24:27] DID NOT JUST MERELY COVER SIN. IT
[2:24:30] CLEANSED IT.
[2:24:32] &gt;&gt; AND NOW THROUGH THAT CLEANSING, THE HOLY
[2:24:34] GHOST COULD TAKE UP RESIDENCE within
[2:24:37] man's soul. And the anointing of the
[2:24:40] spirit
[2:24:42] though that came was an empowerment for
[2:24:45] a task. And throughout the scripture,
[2:24:48] men and women were were per they were
[2:24:52] anointed by the spirit to and they would
[2:24:54] do specific roles
[2:24:56] and they would DO IT WITHOUT POSSESSING
[2:24:58] THE INDWELLING fullness of the Holy
[2:25:00] Ghost. They could be anointed meaning
[2:25:03] the spirit came on THEM FOR A DIVINE
[2:25:06] PURPOSE. LET'S TAKE THE LET'S TAKE THE
[2:25:08] APOSTLE uh not the apostle, the king
[2:25:11] Saul.
[2:25:13] The Bible said in 1st Samuel 10:1 that
[2:25:16] Samuel took a a vial of oil and and
[2:25:19] poured it on Saul's head. And and then
[2:25:21] it says in verse six, "And the spirit of
[2:25:23] the Lord will come UPON THEE AND THOU
[2:25:25] SHALT PROPHESY."
[2:25:28] WELL, SAMUEL or Saul was anointed and
[2:25:31] the spirit came upon him temporarily for
[2:25:34] kingship.
[2:25:35] But later this fear OF THE LORD DEPARTED
[2:25:38] FROM SAUL.
[2:25:43] &gt;&gt; I want to say something that's different
[2:25:46] from you.
[2:25:49] &gt;&gt; Well, the Holy GHOST CAN LEAVE ME. NO,
[2:25:51] he can't. You're sealed.
[2:25:55] &gt;&gt; How long
[2:25:58] &gt;&gt; to your body change?
[2:26:00] &gt;&gt; The day of redemption.
[2:26:03] For he said, "I will never leave you
[2:26:06] &gt;&gt; or forsake you."
[2:26:10] &gt;&gt; ONCE GOD CLAIMED YOU AS HIS OWN,
[2:26:14] &gt;&gt; HE WILL NEVER EVER LOSE YOU.
[2:26:17] &gt;&gt; HE WILL NOT DEPART FROM YOU.
[2:26:24] &gt;&gt; BUT SAUL WAS ANOINTED AND PROPHESIED,
[2:26:29] &gt;&gt; WHICH MEANS TO SPEAK UNDER THE UTTERANCE
[2:26:31] OF THE SPIRIT. AND THE SPIRIT CAME UP ON
[2:26:34] HIM TEMPORARILY.
[2:26:40] &gt;&gt; But then it departed.
[2:26:42] &gt;&gt; He was anointed for service but not
[2:26:44] fueled for life transformation.
[2:26:48] &gt;&gt; Balum. Here's another example. The
[2:26:51] spirit of God came upon him and he
[2:26:53] prophesied truth.
[2:26:56] &gt;&gt; Not a lie. Truth.
[2:26:59] &gt;&gt; But yet he was a false prophet. Yes.
[2:27:02] &gt;&gt; And taught Israel to sin.
[2:27:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:27:04] &gt;&gt; Remember, it wasn't his inspiration from
[2:27:06] God, his prophecy that misled Israel.
[2:27:10] &gt;&gt; It was his doctrine.
[2:27:15] &gt;&gt; What about Samson? The spirit of the
[2:27:17] Lord began to move on him at times.
[2:27:21] IT MOVED ON HIM FOR ACTS OF DELIVERANCE.
[2:27:23] YET, he lacked that inner sanctification
[2:27:25] and control.
[2:27:28] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:27:28] &gt;&gt; Look at David. You know there the you
[2:27:31] KNOW SAMUEL POURED THE OIL UPON him and
[2:27:34] the Bible said AND THE SPIRIT OF THE
[2:27:35] LORD CAME UPON David from that day
[2:27:37] forward.
[2:27:39] You see it came upon him for service.
[2:27:43] BUT EVEN HE PRAYED CUZ he knew
[2:27:48] BECAUSE OF WHAT HE'D done that he could
[2:27:51] lose what he had. So he prays, "Take not
[2:27:54] thy holy spirit from me."
[2:27:58] because he knew what happened with Paul
[2:28:00] or Saul rather when the spirit left an
[2:28:02] evil spirit took him.
[2:28:07] &gt;&gt; But in the new covenant, I want you to
[2:28:08] get this.
[2:28:11] This is different BECAUSE IN ALL OF
[2:28:14] THESE CASES, the spirit came on them for
[2:28:16] empowerment. Yet, it didn't dwell on
[2:28:18] them like in the new covenant sense.
[2:28:20] THEY WERE TOUCHED BY THE SPIRIT BUT NOT
[2:28:22] TRANSFORMED. THAT THE OIL FLOWED OVER
[2:28:24] THEM BUT couldn't fill them.
[2:28:27] &gt;&gt; BUT NOW THE PROMISES IS DIFFERENT. HERE
[2:28:30] WE COME TO A NEW COVENANT. AND JOHN 7:37
[2:28:34] SAYS, "IF ANY MAN THIRST, LET HIM COME
[2:28:37] TO ME AND DRINK. HE THAT BELIEVETH ON
[2:28:40] ME, AS THE SCRIPTURE HAS SAID, OUT OF
[2:28:42] HIS BELLY SHALL FLOW RIVERS OF LIVING
[2:28:45] WATERS."
[2:28:47] BUT THIS SPAKE HE OF THE SPIRIT THAT
[2:28:50] THEY WHICH BELIEVE ON HIM SHOULD
[2:28:52] RECEIVE. FOR THE HOLY GHOST WAS NOT yet
[2:28:56] given.
[2:28:58] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE JESUS WAS NOT YET GLORIFIED.
[2:29:03] &gt;&gt; SO THE HOLY GHOST COULD NOT BE GIVEN
[2:29:06] UNTIL JESUS ASCENDED
[2:29:09] &gt;&gt; AND WOULD SEND BACK THE COMFORTER.
[2:29:12] And he and HE SAID, "NOW THE HOLY SPIRIT
[2:29:15] IS WITH YOU." NOW,
[2:29:18] &gt;&gt; I want you to GET THIS. IT'S BY THE
[2:29:21] SPIRIT YOU HAVE PERFORMED MIRACLES. IT
[2:29:24] IS BY THE SPIRIT THAT YOU have
[2:29:27] absolutely cast out devils.
[2:29:30] &gt;&gt; IT IS BY THE SPIRIT
[2:29:33] &gt;&gt; THAT you've done this.
[2:29:35] &gt;&gt; He is with you now,
[2:29:38] but he shall be in you.
[2:29:51] Let that sink down real deep. He's with
[2:29:55] you now.
[2:29:57] That's him.
[2:29:59] You performed miracles by him.
[2:30:02] &gt;&gt; Peter, you got a revelation by him.
[2:30:06] &gt;&gt; Flesh and blood didn't give this to you.
[2:30:08] Listen,
[2:30:10] you know this this this is He's with you
[2:30:13] now, but
[2:30:15] there's coming a change.
[2:30:18] &gt;&gt; HE SHALL BE IN YOU.
[2:30:22] &gt;&gt; NOW, I WANT YOU TO GET THIS BECAUSE YOU
[2:30:26] see the the believer COULD NOT WOULD NO
[2:30:30] LONGER WOULD NO LONGER BE ANOINTED FOR A
[2:30:32] SEASON, BUT WOULD BE FILLED FOR
[2:30:35] ETERNITY. LOOK, THE SPIRIT DESCENDING
[2:30:37] AND REMAIN.
[2:30:40] &gt;&gt; THE SPIRIT WOULD NO LONGER COME FROM
[2:30:42] UPON HIM FROM WITHOUT, BUT WOULD WOULD
[2:30:44] FLOW LIKE A RIVER WITHIN.
[2:30:48] IT WOULD BE A CONTINUAL CLEANSING. IT
[2:30:50] WOULD BE A RENEWING. IT WOULD BE A
[2:30:52] LIFEGIVING STREAM SPRINGING UP INTO
[2:30:54] eternal life.
[2:30:57] &gt;&gt; AND THIS IS A BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST.
[2:30:59] NOT NOT JUST THE SPIRIT UPON YOU. NOT
[2:31:01] THAT'S THE ANOINTING, but the spirit
[2:31:04] WITHIN YOU. THAT'S THE SEAL.
[2:31:07] &gt;&gt; NOT JUST A VISITATION, BUT A HABITATION.
[2:31:10] &gt;&gt; NOT JUST POWER FOR A TASK, BUT THE LIFE
[2:31:14] OF GOD TRANSFORMING THE SOUL.
[2:31:17] &gt;&gt; And when it came when we come to the the
[2:31:20] New Testament, especially after Calvary
[2:31:22] and Pentecost, the spirit worked shift
[2:31:25] from resting upon to dwelling within.
[2:31:35] John 14:17,
[2:31:37] he dwelleth with you
[2:31:40] and shall be in you.
[2:31:44] &gt;&gt; Even the spirit of truth, whom the world
[2:31:46] cannot receive,
[2:31:48] because receiveth him not, neither
[2:31:50] knoweth him, but you know him, for he
[2:31:51] dwelleth with you
[2:31:54] AND SHALL BE IN YOU. AMEN.
[2:31:58] &gt;&gt; So Jesus MARKED THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
[2:32:01] THE SPIRIT'S OLD TESTAMENT PRESENCE UPON
[2:32:03] AND WITH AND AND and the New Testament
[2:32:06] indwelling in
[2:32:09] &gt;&gt; Acts 2 and 4. And they were filled with
[2:32:12] the Holy Ghost.
[2:32:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT WAS NOT A TEMPORARY
[2:32:17] ANOINTING,
[2:32:20] &gt;&gt; but it was a permanent indwelling. IT
[2:32:22] WAS CHRIST IN THEM, THE HOPE OF GLORY.
[2:32:25] SO TO BE FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT IS TO
[2:32:27] HAVE THE LIFE, THE NATURE, THE CHARACTER
[2:32:29] OF CHRIST LIVING WITHIN. IT IS A
[2:32:32] CONSTANT ABIDING PRESENCE THAT PRODUCES
[2:32:35] THE LIFE OF GOD, THE FRUITS OF THE
[2:32:38] SPIRIT, THE MANIFESTATIONS of God in
[2:32:40] your life.
[2:32:43] &gt;&gt; But the anointing gives empowerment for
[2:32:46] task or an office.
[2:32:51] You can be sealed with the Holy Spirit,
[2:32:54] but you still need the anointing to
[2:32:56] preach
[2:32:58] &gt;&gt; or to operate any gift.
[2:33:01] &gt;&gt; A gift of healing requires an anointing.
[2:33:03] A gift of faith requires an anointing.
[2:33:10] &gt;&gt; And you can be sealed with the spirit of
[2:33:12] God and not anointed.
[2:33:17] Oh, you're confusing me, Brother Tim.
[2:33:19] How in the world? How in the world can
[2:33:21] you be filled and not anointed? Well, I
[2:33:23] tell you what. You know, I I'm filled
[2:33:24] with the spirit every day.
[2:33:26] &gt;&gt; I'm sealed to the day of redemption,
[2:33:29] &gt;&gt; but there are times THAT I'M ANOINTED TO
[2:33:31] PREACH.
[2:33:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO, YOU SEE, THOSE DAYS I'M
[2:33:38] FILLED, BUT I'M NOT NECESSARILY
[2:33:39] ANOINTED.
[2:33:42] BUT THE ANOINTING COMES TO empower me,
[2:33:45] &gt;&gt; to give me THE ABILITY TO SPEAK GOD'S
[2:33:47] WORD.
[2:33:49] &gt;&gt; To speak under inspiration,
[2:33:51] &gt;&gt; DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M TALKING
[2:33:53] ABOUT?
[2:33:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOW, SO, SO AGAIN, YOU KNOW, WHEN
[2:33:57] WHEN Jesus now, now listen, WHEN JESUS
[2:34:00] WAS FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT OF GOD AND HE
[2:34:02] GOES INTO THE wilderness and he's
[2:34:04] tempted of the devil, remember, he can
[2:34:06] see the devil. You can't.
[2:34:09] And I guarantee you, he didn't FEEL
[2:34:11] SAVED AT THAT TIME.
[2:34:13] &gt;&gt; He was feeling an evil spirit.
[2:34:16] &gt;&gt; And he was hearing a wrong voice.
[2:34:19] &gt;&gt; And he WAS HAVING TO JUDGE THAT VOICE BY
[2:34:21] THE WORD. AND HE was in a battle.
[2:34:25] &gt;&gt; And the heavy breath of Satan was in his
[2:34:27] face.
[2:34:29] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[2:34:31] &gt;&gt; And the gloomy spirit was all around
[2:34:33] him. I WANT YOU TO KNOW HE DID NOT FEEL
[2:34:37] ANOINTED AT THAT MOMENT.
[2:34:39] &gt;&gt; BUT HE SAID THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD IS
[2:34:40] UPON ME AND HEATH anointed me to preach
[2:34:44] &gt;&gt; and HE WOULD TAKE THE WORD OF GOD UNDER
[2:34:46] THAT ANOINTING AND PREACH
[2:34:49] &gt;&gt; the word.
[2:34:52] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY YOU'RE SEALED WITH THE
[2:34:54] SPIRIT. BUT WHEN YOU COME TO CHURCH, YOU
[2:34:56] NEED TO GET ANOINTED WITH THE SPIRIT.
[2:34:59] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY WE SING THE SONGS OF ZION.
[2:35:01] THAT'S WHY BROTHER WAIT AND AND AND
[2:35:03] sometimes people get confused. They get
[2:35:05] anointed and aren't sealed
[2:35:08] &gt;&gt; and they jump and dance and shout and
[2:35:10] run the aisle and they wouldn't field.
[2:35:12] They wouldn't seal
[2:35:15] &gt;&gt; but they were anointed
[2:35:20] because Judas was anointed
[2:35:25] and he cast out devils. anointed and he
[2:35:29] preached anointed
[2:35:32] &gt;&gt; not with the evil spirit, the genuine
[2:35:34] Holy Ghost
[2:35:37] &gt;&gt; and had no seal.
[2:35:40] &gt;&gt; But Peter did too.
[2:35:42] &gt;&gt; So when it come time between him and
[2:35:44] ugly self and Christ, he he chose self
[2:35:47] over Christ.
[2:35:48] &gt;&gt; He wasn't converted.
[2:35:50] &gt;&gt; But after he was converted, he could
[2:35:52] strengthen his brethren.
[2:35:58] So don't tell me the anointing isn't
[2:36:01] important.
[2:36:02] Let's go a little bit further. Now
[2:36:06] they're not the same. Though they both
[2:36:08] flow from the same divine source. The
[2:36:12] anointing empowers.
[2:36:14] The infilling transforms.
[2:36:16] And at Pentecost, THEY BOTH FELL
[2:36:18] TOGETHER.
[2:36:19] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT. We want to BE
[2:36:21] ABLE TO HAVE THE SEAL AND BE ANOINTED.
[2:36:24] AMEN.
[2:36:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOW AGAIN, BROTHER BRANDHAM TELLS
[2:36:28] US IN THE EASTER SEAL, he said, "And
[2:36:30] you're quickened." And he said, "This
[2:36:32] quickening power brings your body INTO A
[2:36:35] RAPTURED CONDITION ALREADY." And the
[2:36:37] Pentecostal people up there when they
[2:36:39] got quickened by the spirit, listen to
[2:36:40] me, when those Pentecostal group got up
[2:36:43] there, up there on the day of Pentecost
[2:36:44] received their abstract deed from God,
[2:36:47] SURE IT GLORIFIED THEIR SOULS. THEY
[2:36:50] SCREAMED. THEY SAW TONGUES OF FIRE
[2:36:52] separated upon each of them. It so
[2:36:55] quickened THEIR BODY TILL THEY COULDN'T
[2:36:57] EVEN speak in the earthly language
[2:36:59] anymore. It quickened their body to
[2:37:01] heavenly language. The place that
[2:37:03] they're going to quickening POWER SHOOK
[2:37:06] THEIR MORTAL BODIES TILL THEIR ENTIRE
[2:37:08] MORTAL LANGUAGE WAS TRANSFIGURED,
[2:37:10] TRANSFORMED into an immortal language.
[2:37:13] What quickening power? WHAT something
[2:37:16] that belongs? If the spirit that raised
[2:37:18] up Jesus from the dead DWELLS IN YOUR
[2:37:21] MORTAL BODIES, it shall also quicken
[2:37:23] your mortal bodies. WE ARE QUICKENED
[2:37:25] THEN BY THE power of the living God.
[2:37:28] TONGUES QUICKENED UP TO QUICKEN TO A new
[2:37:32] heavenly language to speak to them a
[2:37:34] rapturing up RAISING UP INTO A DIFFERENT
[2:37:37] ATMOSPHERE THAN WHAT THEY EVER lived in.
[2:37:40] ALSO WITH NEW QUICKENING LIFE IN THEM
[2:37:42] THAT COME in them. It quickened their
[2:37:44] language. They spoke in new tongues. Oh
[2:37:47] yes. [snorts]
[2:37:50] That's what I love about coming to
[2:37:52] church
[2:37:53] &gt;&gt; is you get caught up into a new
[2:37:55] atmosphere.
[2:37:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. You get raptured up sitting right
[2:38:01] in church. You be brought into the
[2:38:03] presence of God.
[2:38:05] &gt;&gt; What is that? It's the anointing. And
[2:38:07] when THAT ANOINTING COMES, IT breaks the
[2:38:09] yoke.
[2:38:10] &gt;&gt; OH, THE CLOUDS OF DEPRESSION AND
[2:38:12] UNBELIEF AND FAITH COMES AND HEALINGS
[2:38:14] comes and miracles come.
[2:38:16] That's right.
[2:38:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE THE ANOINTING COMES.
[2:38:20] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU CAN BE HEALED. YOU CAN PRAY FOR
[2:38:22] THE SICK AND NOT BE SEALED. You you you
[2:38:24] can you CAN HAVE MIRACLES AND NOT BE
[2:38:27] SEALED.
[2:38:30] &gt;&gt; BUT IF YOU'RE SEALED, YOU CAN'T DENY THE
[2:38:32] ANOINTING.
[2:38:36] &gt;&gt; That's why I wonder if a lot of these
[2:38:37] are sealed out there claiming the seal
[2:38:39] of the Holy Ghost and deny the
[2:38:41] anointing.
[2:38:44] Now listen.
[2:38:46] Brother Brandham explained what it took
[2:38:49] for his divine healing gift to work
[2:38:54] and he explained the difference between
[2:38:56] anointing and power
[2:38:58] and why people are taugh tossed about.
[2:39:02] He said some people get the wrong
[2:39:04] impression of what the anointing is. Did
[2:39:07] you ever think of that? When was the
[2:39:09] greatest anointing ever given to anyone?
[2:39:12] And what did they do when they had the
[2:39:14] anointing? The greatest anointing that
[2:39:16] was ever given to anyone was Jesus
[2:39:18] Christ. We have the spirit by measure.
[2:39:20] He had it without measure. And one day
[2:39:22] he entered in the temple. And he picked
[2:39:24] up the scroll and he read, "The spirit
[2:39:27] of God is upon me. For he hath anointed
[2:39:30] me to preach the acceptable year, to
[2:39:33] bind up the broken hearts, to heal the
[2:39:35] sick, to give sight to the blind." And
[2:39:37] now we would think if such an anointing
[2:39:40] was on him that had been prophesied 800
[2:39:43] years before that would come that he
[2:39:46] with that type of anointing the full
[2:39:47] blessing anointed upon him. We would all
[2:39:50] want to run all over the building and
[2:39:52] scream and holler. But the Bible said he
[2:39:55] laid down the scroll and sat down and
[2:39:58] precious words proceeded from his mouth.
[2:40:02] NOW THAT'S WHAT HE DONE under the
[2:40:04] anointing. The anointing is not
[2:40:06] emotions. The anointing is supreme power
[2:40:10] in CONTROL LIKE KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT AND
[2:40:14] HOW. And that's what's here.
[2:40:17] &gt;&gt; So he was explaining his gift and he
[2:40:19] said, "NOW HERE'S HOW IT WORKS. It
[2:40:21] doesn't make me want to run the aisle
[2:40:24] and scream and shout."
[2:40:28] &gt;&gt; You see, the anointing IS NOT EMOTION.
[2:40:32] THAT'S not emotions. or the the the
[2:40:34] ANOINTING IS NOT EMOTION BUT the
[2:40:36] anointing can make you emotional.
[2:40:41] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:40:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOW JESUS UNDER the anointing
[2:40:47] OF THE SPIRIT TAUGHT THE PEOPLE SAYING
[2:40:51] THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD IS UPON ME
[2:40:53] BECAUSE he hath anointed me to preach
[2:40:57] the gospel to the poor. HE HAS SENT ME
[2:40:59] to heal the brokenhearted.
[2:41:02] So even Jesus though he WAS THE WORD
[2:41:06] MADE FLESH, HE DID NOT MINISTER IN HIS
[2:41:09] OWN STRENGTH. HE WAITED until the spirit
[2:41:13] came upon him at Jordan. Remember that.
[2:41:17] And then he declared, "The spirit of the
[2:41:18] Lord is upon me."
[2:41:20] &gt;&gt; Now that WAS NOT JUST A BLESSING. That's
[2:41:23] empowerment.
[2:41:25] &gt;&gt; THE ANOINTING EQUIPS A MAN FOR his
[2:41:28] calling. That's right.
[2:41:30] &gt;&gt; IT TURNS HUMAN WORDS INTO DIVINE
[2:41:32] UTTERANCE. IT TURNS INTELLECT INTO
[2:41:35] REVELATION. It sermons it it it TURNS
[2:41:40] SERMONS INTO FIRE. YOU SEE, A MAN MIGHT
[2:41:43] STAND BEHIND THE DESK AND GIVE A
[2:41:45] LECTURE, BUT HE CANNOT PREACH UNTIL HE'S
[2:41:47] ANOINTED.
[2:41:49] &gt;&gt; HE MIGHT BE SEALED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT.
[2:41:51] HE MIGHT CARRY THE LIFE OF GOD WITHIN
[2:41:53] HIM, but yet there's another measure
[2:41:55] that comes upon him when God calls him
[2:41:58] to preach. And that's what John spoke
[2:42:01] about when he said in Revelation 19:10.
[2:42:03] The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of
[2:42:06] prophecy.
[2:42:08] &gt;&gt; When the anointing comes, it lifts a man
[2:42:11] beyond himself and he becomes a vessel
[2:42:15] through which the spirit bears witness
[2:42:17] of Christ.
[2:42:19] Brother Brandham said he's a preacher
[2:42:21] and when he preaches he has that
[2:42:23] anointing. You ministers have that
[2:42:25] anointing. You people who speak with
[2:42:27] tongues have that anointing. If it's
[2:42:30] really the Holy Ghost speaking through
[2:42:31] you is see it's the same spirit only
[2:42:34] operating in different forms.
[2:42:37] So when a person speaks in tonesues if
[2:42:39] it's genuine tonesues it's the spirit's
[2:42:41] anointing.
[2:42:43] &gt;&gt; It's not emotion.
[2:42:45] &gt;&gt; It's the spirit's anointing.
[2:42:47] It's not manufactured
[2:42:50] &gt;&gt; when a man preaches. It's the spirit
[2:42:52] anointing.
[2:42:54] &gt;&gt; Is not human intellect.
[2:42:56] &gt;&gt; It's divine uncction.
[2:42:59] &gt;&gt; It's an anointing.
[2:43:02] Are you with me?
[2:43:04] &gt;&gt; Now,
[2:43:07] Brother Brandham talks about that and he
[2:43:09] says and he's preaching on who is this?
[2:43:12] HE WANTS TO IDENTIFY WHO IS THIS IN OUR
[2:43:14] MIDST. AND HE SAID, WHO IS THIS THAT
[2:43:16] COME INTO a congregation that will
[2:43:18] anoint it till one will speak with
[2:43:20] tongues and another give the
[2:43:21] interpretation?
[2:43:23] That's anointing.
[2:43:25] Exactly. Tell a sinner of his sins and
[2:43:27] where he's at. WHO IS THIS THAT STANDS
[2:43:29] IN A in an illiterate woman that can't
[2:43:32] read her name and will stand under the
[2:43:34] anointing of God of the Holy Ghost and
[2:43:36] speak words that she's never heard? And
[2:43:38] a Mexican raised up in the church and
[2:43:39] say, "I understood every word of it."
[2:43:41] has even called me by name and has
[2:43:43] called me to repentance. God have mercy
[2:43:45] on my soul. He said, "Who is this?"
[2:43:49] So, the anointing is power in supreme
[2:43:53] CONTROL. IT'S THE POWER OF GOD
[2:43:55] CONTROLLING THE TONGUE. IT'S THE POWER
[2:43:57] OF GOD CONTROLLING THE GIFT.
[2:44:01] IT'S NOT AN EMOTION. TO BE FILLED WITH
[2:44:04] THE SPIRIT THOUGH is something much
[2:44:06] deeper.
[2:44:08] IT'S NOT MERELY A POWERFUL TASK. IT'S
[2:44:10] THE LIFE OF CHRIST living in you.
[2:44:14] &gt;&gt; You know, AGAIN, HE THAT DWELLETH WITH
[2:44:16] YOU SHALL be in you. Again, he says,
[2:44:19] EPHESIANS 3:19, THAT YOU MIGHT BE FILLED
[2:44:22] WITH ALL THE FULLNESS of God.
[2:44:25] Get this. The anointing comes and goes
[2:44:29] as needed.
[2:44:35] infilling abides.
[2:44:40] &gt;&gt; THE ANOINTING ENABLES YOU TO SERVE.
[2:44:43] &gt;&gt; The infilling
[2:44:46] enables you to live.
[2:44:48] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN A MAN IS FILLED WITH THE
[2:44:50] SPIRIT, THE VERY NATURE OF GOD IS
[2:44:53] IMPARTED IN HIS SOUL. AND LOVE, PEACE,
[2:44:56] JOY, LONGSUFFERING, GENTLENESS,
[2:44:58] GOODNESS, FAITH, MEEKNESS, TEMPERANCE,
[2:45:00] ALL OF THAT. IT'S TRANS IT'S
[2:45:03] TRANSFORMATIONAL. IT'S NOT JUST A
[2:45:05] VISITATION. YOU ARE TRANSFORMED.
[2:45:13] YET, let me say this.
[2:45:16] You can be anointed to shout
[2:45:20] and it's not just emotion.
[2:45:23] It's a spirit on you.
[2:45:25] &gt;&gt; And you can be anointed to rejoice
[2:45:28] and it's the joy of the Lord.
[2:45:32] And you can ble be blessed. I want I
[2:45:35] want just and you and brother Brandham
[2:45:37] even said, you know, that's not
[2:45:38] necessarily the power of God. He said
[2:45:40] that's the blessings of God.
[2:45:42] &gt;&gt; And let me just say this, but what's
[2:45:44] wrong with having the blessings?
[2:45:50] &gt;&gt; Somebody help me preach.
[2:45:53] &gt;&gt; I mean, Jacob didn't just want the
[2:45:55] birthright.
[2:45:57] &gt;&gt; He wanted the blessing to go with it.
[2:46:02] AND ESAU WANTED THE BLESSING having
[2:46:04] rejected the birthright.
[2:46:07] &gt;&gt; That's the difference between the Jacob
[2:46:09] AND ESAU'S.
[2:46:10] &gt;&gt; ONE OF THEM TAKE THE BLESSINGS of God
[2:46:13] and the and and the demonstrations of
[2:46:15] the SPIRIT OF GOD WITHOUT receiving the
[2:46:17] birthright and the other wants the
[2:46:19] birthright and the blessing. Amen.
[2:46:25] &gt;&gt; And I tell you what, a Jacob that has a
[2:46:27] heart for God will even cheat to get it.
[2:46:33] &gt;&gt; He'll do whatever he has to do
[2:46:36] &gt;&gt; to lay hold on the promise.
[2:46:38] &gt;&gt; You know what I'm talking about.
[2:46:40] &gt;&gt; Now, you can put you can be blessed
[2:46:42] beyond measure. You can shout, you can
[2:46:45] dance, rejoice under the touch of the
[2:46:48] spirit and and yet never move one
[2:46:50] mountain of unbelief.
[2:46:54] &gt;&gt; Blessing is God's goodness.
[2:46:56] Empowerment is God's authority.
[2:47:00] &gt;&gt; And many shout under the blessings of
[2:47:02] God, but very few
[2:47:06] stand under the burden of the anointing.
[2:47:10] And the difference is the blessing
[2:47:12] refreshes you.
[2:47:14] And I don't know about you, but I WANT
[2:47:15] HIS BLESSINGS.
[2:47:17] &gt;&gt; I WANT THAT REFRESHING FROM THE PRESENCE
[2:47:20] OF THE LORD.
[2:47:21] &gt;&gt; I WANT MY BURDENS LIFTED.
[2:47:24] &gt;&gt; I WANT JOY IN my heart.
[2:47:27] &gt;&gt; I want it to bubble over and overflow.
[2:47:30] &gt;&gt; And it should.
[2:47:34] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[2:47:35] &gt;&gt; BLESSINGS REFRESHING YOU, BUT ANOINTING
[2:47:38] commissions you and the seal fills you.
[2:47:43] AMEN. NOW JESUS SAID IN Acts 1:8, "You
[2:47:47] shall receive power after the Holy Ghost
[2:47:49] has come upon you and you shall be
[2:47:50] witnesses unto me." Now that's not just
[2:47:54] joy. That's authority. That's a mantel
[2:47:56] for divine testimony.
[2:47:59] On the other hand, you can have great
[2:48:01] anointing
[2:48:02] and still lack true character.
[2:48:06] This is why Paul said, "Though I speak
[2:48:10] with tongues of men and of angels,
[2:48:14] and have not charity, which is God's
[2:48:17] basic nature,
[2:48:19] I've become the sound and brass and
[2:48:20] tinkle and symbol. I'm just noise.
[2:48:23] And though I have all faith
[2:48:28] so that I could move mountains and I
[2:48:31] don't have God's basic nature, which is
[2:48:33] love, I'm nothing.
[2:48:36] &gt;&gt; And you can have THE POWER TO PROPHESY,
[2:48:38] HEAL THE SICK, PERFORM MIRACLES, and not
[2:48:41] yet bear the nature of the one who gave
[2:48:44] the power. And that's why Jesus warned
[2:48:47] in Matthew 7:22, "MANY SHALL COME TO me
[2:48:51] in that day and say, "Have we not
[2:48:53] prophesied in thy name?"
[2:48:57] And then what did he say?
[2:48:59] I will profess to them, I never knew
[2:49:01] you.
[2:49:03] You weren't born of me.
[2:49:06] &gt;&gt; YET THEY CONFESS. WE HAVE DONE. PUT it
[2:49:09] Put that up. Ma Matthew 7:22. and many
[2:49:13] shall come to me in that day. Lord,
[2:49:15] Lord,
[2:49:17] have we not prophesied in thy name, and
[2:49:19] in thy name have cast out devils, and in
[2:49:22] thy name done many mighty, many
[2:49:24] wonderful works.
[2:49:26] Now listen,
[2:49:28] don't get confused. Nothing wrong with
[2:49:31] prophesying, nothing wrong with the
[2:49:33] works, nothing wrong with casting out
[2:49:35] devils. It's the signs of believers.
[2:49:39] &gt;&gt; These things follow believers.
[2:49:44] When faith is exhibited, this happens.
[2:49:48] &gt;&gt; But he said the problem is is not the
[2:49:52] works. You were never born of me.
[2:49:56] &gt;&gt; I never knew you.
[2:50:00] &gt;&gt; So power without love, without the
[2:50:03] nature of God is like lamp without oil.
[2:50:07] It's like a gift without the giver.
[2:50:09] &gt;&gt; It's anointing.
[2:50:11] The anointing comes on you to enable.
[2:50:14] The infilling comes within you to
[2:50:16] transform you. The anointing empowers
[2:50:19] your hands. THE INFILLING SANCTIFIES the
[2:50:22] heart. To be anointed is to be equipped.
[2:50:25] THE INFILLING THOUGH SANCTIFIES THE
[2:50:28] HEART and makes your heart right with
[2:50:30] God. So you see, it's to be changed. So
[2:50:33] it's not BY MIGHT NOR BY POWER, BUT BY
[2:50:37] MY SPIRIT, SAYETH THE LORD. SO WHEN THE
[2:50:40] SPIRIT FILLS YOU, YOU BEAR THE LIFE OF
[2:50:42] CHRIST. WHEN THE SPIRIT ANOINTS YOU, YOU
[2:50:45] MANIFEST THE WORKS of Christ. So we need
[2:50:47] them both.
[2:50:56] &gt;&gt; But the problem of it is is that when we
[2:50:59] realize that you can have the anointing
[2:51:02] and not be sealed, THEN PEOPLE THROW
[2:51:04] AWAY THE ANOINTING.
[2:51:06] &gt;&gt; WELL, WE DON'T WANT the anointing. Yes,
[2:51:08] YOU WANT THE ANOINTING. THE ANOINTING
[2:51:10] EMPOWERS YOU. THE ANOINTING GIFTS YOU.
[2:51:14] THE ANOINTING GIVES YOU ABILITY. THE
[2:51:17] SEAL SAVES YOU TO THE DAY OF REDEMPTION.
[2:51:28] &gt;&gt; And this is where we get the criticism
[2:51:31] because we're a church that believes in
[2:51:32] the anointing and the infilling.
[2:51:36] We want the seal.
[2:51:38] &gt;&gt; But if you really have the seal, then
[2:51:40] the spirit that feels anoints.
[2:51:44] &gt;&gt; AND JUST BECAUSE YOU SEE THE FALSE
[2:51:47] ANOINTED OUT HERE doesn't mean it was
[2:51:50] even for them.
[2:51:51] &gt;&gt; THE TRUE ANOINTING CAME. THE RAIN COMES
[2:51:54] TO FALL UPON THE WHEAT.
[2:51:56] &gt;&gt; The others JUST END THE FIELD WITH IT.
[2:51:58] GOD SENDS IT FOR THE GRAIN. AND THE TRUE
[2:52:01] ANOINTING IS WHAT GOD HAS SENT IN THIS
[2:52:04] LAST DAY TO ANOINT THE BELIEVER.
[2:52:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN. TO FILL THEM WITH HIS SPIRIT TO
[2:52:09] SEAL THEM INTO THE DAY OF REDEMPTION TO
[2:52:12] GIVE THEM POWER TO LIVE AN OVERCOMING
[2:52:14] LIFE.
[2:52:15] &gt;&gt; And together they make a complete man of
[2:52:18] God, a spiritfilled and spirit
[2:52:21] empowered, a vessel of his nature
[2:52:24] &gt;&gt; and of his power.
[2:52:29] that the musicians come.
[2:52:35] You know,
[2:52:37] as we labor on this,
[2:52:40] just look at the Bible. You can tell the
[2:52:42] difference. Capas is the high priest.
[2:52:46] This is in John chapter 11. The Bible
[2:52:49] said, "Be in the high priest the same
[2:52:51] year." Verse 49, he prophesied that
[2:52:54] Jesus should die for the nation.
[2:52:58] Think of that. Keeps
[2:53:01] the one that he wasn't a believer. He
[2:53:04] crucified
[2:53:06] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ yet prophesied under the
[2:53:09] spirit.
[2:53:12] Look at the disciples at Ephesus.
[2:53:15] He says, "Have you received the Holy
[2:53:17] Ghost since you believed?"
[2:53:19] They had believed. They had the word but
[2:53:21] had not received them dwell in full
[2:53:24] fullness.
[2:53:25] They had they had faith and perhaps a
[2:53:29] measure of the spirit,
[2:53:32] but not the baptism or the infilling of
[2:53:35] it.
[2:53:37] They had heard anointed preachers
[2:53:39] preach.
[2:53:41] John the Baptist was anointed of the
[2:53:43] spirit of God
[2:53:44] &gt;&gt; but not yet filled.
[2:53:47] &gt;&gt; Peter got revelation but wasn't
[2:53:49] converted.
[2:53:51] Judas
[2:53:53] healed the sick by the power of God.
[2:53:56] &gt;&gt; Priest in his name,
[2:53:58] &gt;&gt; anointed by the spirit.
[2:54:00] &gt;&gt; Well, but then we don't want the
[2:54:01] anointing. Oh, yes. You just don't want
[2:54:03] it alone.
[2:54:06] &gt;&gt; You want to be filled with the spirit
[2:54:09] &gt;&gt; and have his anointing
[2:54:12] &gt;&gt; because if you're truly sealed with the
[2:54:14] spirit, you can't deny his anointing.
[2:54:21] That's why when you hear them speaking
[2:54:23] against anointed preachers today and oh
[2:54:26] don't don't preach anymore just play
[2:54:27] tapes. You know that ain't the Holy
[2:54:29] Ghost
[2:54:31] &gt;&gt; cuz he cannot deny his own word.
[2:54:38] &gt;&gt; Men did not set up preachers in this in
[2:54:41] this message. God ordained them.
[2:54:44] &gt;&gt; And men can't tell us to sit down.
[2:54:46] That's right.
[2:54:48] &gt;&gt; And you cannot by the spirit of God say
[2:54:52] such a thing
[2:54:54] &gt;&gt; because to do it is deny the word.
[2:54:58] &gt;&gt; Let's stand together.
[2:55:05] Jesus is the sweetest name I know.
[2:55:08] [snorts]
[2:55:14] Jesus
[2:55:16] is
[2:55:17] the sweetest
[2:55:19] name
[2:55:21] I know.
[2:55:27] And he's just the [music] same
[2:55:33] as
[2:55:35] his [music] lovely name.
[2:55:40] And that's the reason why I love him so
[2:55:48] [music]
[2:55:54] [music]
[2:55:56] the sweetest
[2:55:58] day I sing it one more time now.
[2:56:04] Oh [music] my Jesus,
[2:56:09] the sweetest
[2:56:11] name I know.
[2:56:18] And he's just the same
[2:56:25] as [music] his lovely day.
[2:56:31] And [music and singing] that's the
[2:56:33] reason
[2:56:34] why I love [music]
[2:56:37] him so
[2:56:43] far
[2:56:46] is the sweetest [music]
[2:56:49] name I know. Just raise your hands to me
[2:56:53] and sing it again.
[2:56:56] Well, [singing] my Jesus
[2:56:59] is the sweetest [music]
[2:57:02] name I know.
[2:57:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, let him be real to your heart today.
[2:57:10] [music]
[2:57:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, he's the same
[2:57:15] as [singing] his [music]
[2:57:17] lovely name.
[2:57:21] And that's [singing]
[2:57:23] the reason [music]
[2:57:25] why I love him so
[2:57:33] far. [singing]
[2:57:35] [music] Jesus is the sweetest
[2:57:41] I know.
[2:57:49] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:57:55] &gt;&gt; How many [music] are sealed with the
[2:57:56] spirit today?
[2:57:59] But you'd say, "I'd like to have a
[2:58:00] refreshing from the presence of the
[2:58:03] Lord."
[2:58:09] Till the sunlight of God just
[2:58:12] burst through upon my soul.
[2:58:16] The angels [music] come and strengthen
[2:58:18] me.
[2:58:20] You've been through temptation and
[2:58:22] [music] trials.
[2:58:24] Even Jesus needed strengthening
[2:58:27] after [music] his great hour of
[2:58:29] temptation.
[2:58:31] You needed his Holy Spirit, the angel of
[2:58:34] his presence, just to come down over you
[2:58:38] and to strengthen you
[2:58:41] until you're so in love with Jesus
[2:58:43] again.
[2:58:45] Till the things of this world just grow
[2:58:47] strangely dim,
[2:58:50] till it all fades [music] away until you
[2:58:53] see Jesus only.
[2:58:57] Just invite him today and say, "Lord,
[2:59:02] I don't ask for a special way [music]
[2:59:04] for you to do it.
[2:59:08] Maybe just to scream or to shout or to
[2:59:11] dance
[2:59:13] or have some display of great emotion,
[2:59:17] but just in the simplest of the spirit.
[2:59:21] Lord, I've been through a battle.
[2:59:24] There's been a battle in my mind.
[2:59:27] There's been an overclouding of the
[2:59:29] spirit of the enemy.
[2:59:31] It's come. It's not you.
[2:59:35] It's not you. It's the devil.
[2:59:38] It's your enemy want you to give in.
[2:59:43] But you can say by the word today, it's
[2:59:46] written.
[2:59:50] Your question whether you're a son or a
[2:59:52] daughter of God,
[2:59:54] the devil comes and tempts you soar and
[2:59:56] tries to make you doubt.
[3:00:00] And God's here to reassure you.
[3:00:05] I could never forget you.
[3:00:07] Your names is engraved in the palms of
[3:00:10] my hand.
[3:00:12] I have come to give you a hope and a
[3:00:14] future,
[3:00:17] an expected end.
[3:00:23] Why don't you just be refreshed in his
[3:00:25] presence this morning
[3:00:28] until Jesus
[3:00:31] means everything?
[3:00:35] As I said, till the world fades away
[3:00:38] and the sweetness of his presence lifts
[3:00:42] you up out of that darkness
[3:00:46] into his presence.
[3:00:49] And because in [music] his presence is
[3:00:52] the fullness of joy.
[3:00:56] Oh, just invite him to your pew today.
[3:01:01] Maybe if you're not a Christian, today
[3:01:03] would be a moment you could just say, "I
[3:01:06] want to know that lovely Lord Jesus.
[3:01:10] I want him to take away my sins.
[3:01:13] I've been wrong. [music] I've lived
[3:01:15] wrong,
[3:01:16] but I'd like to have him in my life.
[3:01:20] I want to be anointed with him. I want
[3:01:22] to have the joy of the Lord. I've I've
[3:01:25] experienced the depths of Satan in my
[3:01:27] life.
[3:01:30] I've been taken down to a dark pit.
[3:01:35] But today I hear a word that there is a
[3:01:39] promise given in the last day where the
[3:01:42] Holy Spirit is seeking those
[3:01:45] whose hearts are turned toward him who
[3:01:48] want to change and they say, "Lord,
[3:01:52] come with the seal of the living God
[3:01:56] and change my heart in your presence.
[3:01:58] [music]
[3:02:01] Make it real to me."
[3:02:03] Maybe you want to raise a hand to God
[3:02:05] and say, "Lord, that's me. I want the
[3:02:08] seal of the living God.
[3:02:10] I want it in my heart. I want it in my
[3:02:13] life. I want it in my forehead. I want a
[3:02:15] [music] new thinking. I want my mind on
[3:02:17] you."
[3:02:19] Because that's where real [music] peace
[3:02:21] is. Is when our mind is stayed on
[3:02:23] Christ.
[3:02:26] Where we're centered on Jesus.
[3:02:29] Where everything else fades.
[3:02:32] and we see him
[3:02:36] and that's the [snorts]
[3:02:38] reason
[3:02:39] why I love him so
[3:02:47] for
[3:02:49] Jesus
[3:02:51] is the [music] sweetest
[3:02:54] day I know
[3:03:00] it is no [singing and music] secret
[3:03:07] what God [music]
[3:03:09] can do.
[3:03:13] What he's done [music]
[3:03:15] [singing] for us,
[3:03:20] he'll [singing]
[3:03:21] do for you.
[3:03:26] Oh, with arms wide open
[3:03:31] [singing]
[3:03:32] [music]
[3:03:33] &gt;&gt; he call
[3:03:36] you.
[3:03:39] &gt;&gt; It is [singing]
[3:03:41] [music]
[3:03:46] what God
[3:03:48] can do. Hannah,
[3:03:52] we're singing this for Hannah now. It is
[3:03:55] no [music] secret. [singing]
[3:03:59] &gt;&gt; What God can do. Can you sing that for
[3:04:03] Hannah?
[3:04:06] &gt;&gt; What he's done for [singing and music]
[3:04:08] us.
[3:04:11] &gt;&gt; What he's done for you,
[3:04:14] &gt;&gt; for [music and singing] he'll do for
[3:04:16] you.
[3:04:18] And with arms wide open,
[3:04:23] [singing]
[3:04:25] &gt;&gt; he
[3:04:27] know your sins [music] were scarlet.
[3:04:30] They'll be white as snow.
[3:04:32] &gt;&gt; Though they were red lights, cursing,
[3:04:34] they'll be white as [music]
[3:04:37] far as the east is. From the west, I'll
[3:04:40] remove your sins from you. This is his
[3:04:42] [music] promise. I won't make you fight
[3:04:45] this battle alone. I'll go with you.
[3:04:48] I'll be even in you to the end of the
[3:04:50] world. How does it start? [music]
[3:04:53] Repentance. A change of heart. Coming to
[3:04:57] God humbly. Say, [music] "Lord, I need
[3:05:00] you. Save me. I can't save myself.
[3:05:04] I can't deliver myself. I got myself in
[3:05:08] a heap of trouble. But oh God, only you
[3:05:10] can get me out of it. That's why I need
[3:05:13] a [music] savior. And he came to save
[3:05:18] people just like you.
[3:05:20] He didn't come to call the righteous to
[3:05:22] [music] repentance, but he come to call
[3:05:25] the sinner, the ungodly. Those that
[3:05:28] realize, I need a savior. You swam along
[3:05:32] for a long time thinking you could do
[3:05:34] this on your own. You couldn't. [music]
[3:05:37] You were drowning, but you've been
[3:05:39] calling out, "I need a savior. Help me.
[3:05:42] I perish." We're throwing out a lifeline
[3:05:45] to her this morning. We're believing God
[3:05:47] for a change in her life. That this is a
[3:05:52] day of change, a transformation.
[3:05:55] It won't be a time of just a visitation
[3:05:57] of the spirit, but where the spirit will
[3:06:00] come to indwell to abide with [music]
[3:06:02] her forever as she comes. Let's sing
[3:06:05] that again for Hannah. And do you sing
[3:06:08] it as part of your testimony? Every one
[3:06:10] of you have been where Hannah's been.
[3:06:12] You needed a savior. You needed a God.
[3:06:16] Now listen.
[3:06:19] Don't ever judge yourself by others.
[3:06:25] By what they got or how it God moved
[3:06:27] [music] on them. Just let God move in
[3:06:30] you
[3:06:31] &gt;&gt; the way he wants.
[3:06:35] &gt;&gt; Don't idolize somebody else's
[3:06:37] experience.
[3:06:39] &gt;&gt; Just realize God will give me my own.
[3:06:45] He'll pardon me. [music] He'll cleanse.
[3:06:48] He'll wash us white as snow.
[3:06:52] As the deacons [music] come to pray with
[3:06:54] me as brother Timothy leads in this
[3:06:56] song, let's worship God.
[3:07:02] &gt;&gt; God, God bless you, man.
[3:07:06] &gt;&gt; [music]
[3:07:06] &gt;&gt; It is no secret [singing]
[3:07:13] what [music] God can do.
[3:07:19] &gt;&gt; What he's done for
[3:07:22] others.
[3:07:26] He'll do it [singing] all for you.
[3:07:29] [music]
[3:07:32] &gt;&gt; With arms wide open,
[3:07:37] he'll [music and singing]
[3:07:44] [music and singing]
[3:07:46] see
[3:07:50] what God can do.
[3:07:56] It [singing and music]
[3:07:57] is no secret
[3:08:01] [music]
[3:08:03] what God can [singing] do.
[3:08:09] What he's done
[3:08:11] for [singing] others.
[3:08:15] He'll do it for you. He'll do it for
[3:08:20] you.
[3:08:21] &gt;&gt; With arms wide over
[3:08:28] his heart [singing]
[3:08:30] you [music]
[3:08:33] [singing]
[3:08:36] see [music]
[3:08:40] &gt;&gt; what God can do.
[3:08:44] Amazing
[3:08:48] grace [singing]
[3:08:51] shall
[3:08:53] always [music]
[3:08:54] be my song [singing] of praise.
[3:09:01] &gt;&gt; For it [singing and music] was grace
[3:09:05] that bought my li.
[3:09:14] I do [singing] now know
[3:09:17] [music]
[3:09:19] just how he came
[3:09:22] to love [singing]
[3:09:24] me. So
[3:09:28] he looked beyond [singing]
[3:09:32] all my faults
[3:09:35] and he [music] saw [singing] my needs.
[3:09:40] I shall forever [music and singing]
[3:09:46] live my eyes [singing]
[3:09:49] to calary
[3:09:54] to hear the cross
[3:09:57] [music]
[3:09:59] where Jesus [singing]
[3:10:01] died
[3:10:03] for me.
[3:10:04] [music]
[3:10:07] How [singing] far
[3:10:12] the grace [music and singing] that
[3:10:15] my fall?
[3:10:21] &gt;&gt; He looked beyond [singing]
[3:10:23] [music]
[3:10:25] all my faults
[3:10:27] and he saw my need.
[3:10:33] It [singing]
[3:10:33] was God's [music]
[3:10:35] grace
[3:10:38] that brought [singing] me out [music] of
[3:10:42] darkness
[3:10:46] into [singing]
[3:10:48] the light
[3:10:51] where I [singing] can [music]
[3:10:55] see.
[3:10:59] I'll [singing] shout
[3:11:03] [music]
[3:11:04] the mountains
[3:11:06] and the valley.
[3:11:11] Oh, [music and singing] he looks beyond
[3:11:16] all
[3:11:18] that is [music] on my knees.
[3:11:24] I shall [singing] forever [music]
[3:11:30] in my eyes
[3:11:35] [singing] to calary [music]
[3:11:42] where Jesus [singing]
[3:11:43] [music]
[3:11:46] glory.
[3:11:48] time for me.
[3:11:51] [music and singing]
[3:11:55] The great [music]
[3:11:59] [singing]
[3:12:03] he [music] look up
[3:12:08] my fault.
[3:12:10] So [singing] I [music] shall forever
[3:12:13] live.
[3:12:15] I shall [music]
[3:12:18] forever
[3:12:22] [music] my I
[3:12:27] suspect.
[3:12:32] [music]
[3:12:34] [singing]
[3:12:42] [music]
[3:12:48] [music and singing]
[3:12:54] He looked [music] beyond [singing]
[3:12:59] all my faults that he saw. [singing]
[3:13:02] Sing that second verse again. [music]
[3:13:07] It [singing] was God's grace [music]
[3:13:12] that brought [singing] me out
[3:13:16] of darkness [music]
[3:13:21] into [singing] the light [music]
[3:13:25] where I can clearly
[3:13:29] see.
[3:13:32] I'll [singing] shout it from
[3:13:37] the mountains [singing]
[3:13:39] [music] and the valley.
[3:13:46] He [music] looks beyond
[3:13:50] all my thoughts [music]
[3:13:53] and it's all I need.
[3:13:57] [music]
[3:13:59] I shall [singing] forever
[3:14:04] [music] raise my eyes to [singing]
[3:14:07] calless.
[3:14:10] [music]
[3:14:14] [singing]
[3:14:18] [music]
[3:14:23] [music]
[3:14:24] [singing]
[3:14:29] &gt;&gt; [music]
[3:14:30] &gt;&gt; He raised up all my fallen soul.
[3:14:37] He looked [singing]
[3:14:38] beyond
[3:14:40] [music]
[3:14:41] all my faults. Sing that one more time.
[3:14:45] My name
[3:14:49] I shall [music and singing]
[3:14:51] forever
[3:14:55] live.
[3:14:56] My eyes to [music and singing] calary.
[3:15:00] Oh to Calvary
[3:15:05] [music and singing]
[3:15:12] when he died for me
[3:15:19] [music]
[3:15:20] the gra. [singing]
[3:15:24] [music]
[3:15:28] He looked [singing]
[3:15:29] beyond [music]
[3:15:32] our faults
[3:15:35] and he [music] saw [singing] my
[3:15:42] goodness of God. I love you Lord
[3:15:45] [singing]
[3:15:49] for your mercy never fails me.
[3:15:55] All my days [singing]
[3:15:57] I've been held in your hands. [singing]
[3:16:02] &gt;&gt; From the moment that I wait around
[3:16:07] until I [singing] laid my head,
[3:16:12] I will sing
[3:16:14] of the goodness [music]
[3:16:16] of God.
[3:16:22] And all my life you have

[3:16:49] of [music] God.
[3:16:52] I love your voice.

[3:23:01] [music]
[3:23:02] praise God, [singing]
[3:23:04] praise God.
[3:23:07] Oh, praise God.
[3:23:07] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[3:23:10] Praise [music] God.
[3:23:12] Praise God.
[3:23:14] Praise [music and singing] God.

[3:23:40] Praise God.
[3:23:43] &gt;&gt; [music]
[3:23:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:23:46] &gt;&gt; Isn't God good to us?
[3:23:48] &gt;&gt; He gives us so many blessings
[3:23:51] &gt;&gt; here. We're coming to bring this child
[3:23:53] of God here today to be immersed in
[3:23:57] water. And you know, here's the thing.
[3:24:00] You know, John the Baptist declared, you
[3:24:03] know, that I, you know, I baptize you
[3:24:06] with water, but he that comes after me,
[3:24:08] he will baptize you with the Holy Ghost
[3:24:11] and fire. And so, this is the promise of
[3:24:15] the scripture that we fulfill him, the
[3:24:18] fulfill the word. We're baptized in his
[3:24:20] name. We take on his name, identify
[3:24:23] ourselves with him, then he comes and
[3:24:26] gives us the Holy Ghost. You see this is
[3:24:29] is the first steps of salvation is is is
[3:24:33] us accepting Christ.
[3:24:36] But when he comes as the Holy Spirit,
[3:24:39] it's him accepting you. And so here
[3:24:43] today as we know that you cannot come
[3:24:46] unless the father draws. And God has
[3:24:50] drawn God's been moving on her life
[3:24:53] dealing with her heart. And she has come
[3:24:55] with a surrendered heart to God. Yes,
[3:24:58] she was baptized before we know. But you
[3:25:02] know, she was blessed by the spirit of
[3:25:05] God and been anointed by the spirit of
[3:25:07] God. But you know, today she wants more
[3:25:11] than an anointing.
[3:25:12] &gt;&gt; She wants the filling of the spirit of
[3:25:14] God. So today, Hannah, I come as a
[3:25:18] servant of Christ. And the Lord Jesus
[3:25:22] sent me to preach the gospel.
[3:25:25] And he commissioned me to baptize
[3:25:28] those that believe.
[3:25:31] For he said to go into all the world and
[3:25:33] to preach the gospel and baptizing them
[3:25:36] in the name of the Father and of the Son
[3:25:38] and of the Holy Ghost. Now, in obedience
[3:25:41] to that divine command, I baptize you in
[3:25:44] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[3:25:47] Thank you, Lord. [applause] Praise the
[3:25:49] Lord.
