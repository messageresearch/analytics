Bethlehem was such a popular [Music] destination up you go there are more rooms to clean if we want to keep our five star ring we must keep our rooms in tiptop shape all right no need to be a pharaoh I hope we can retire this taxation wave then I can get some much needed rest how may I help yall find people today my wife here was just telling me that we have some of our finest room rooms ready for the most important guests such as yourselves yeah looks like they could pay the highest price for a room did you see their camels one step closer to retirement right this [Music] way [Music] Hil Mary

David fear not to take unto thee and marry thy wife for that which is conceived in her of the Holy Ghost she shall bring for the son and you shall call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins thank you Lord I believe your [Music] word and it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Cesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed and this taxing was first made when sirenas was governor of [Music] Sy and all went to be taxed everyone into his own City and Joseph also went up From Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into Judea unto the city of David
