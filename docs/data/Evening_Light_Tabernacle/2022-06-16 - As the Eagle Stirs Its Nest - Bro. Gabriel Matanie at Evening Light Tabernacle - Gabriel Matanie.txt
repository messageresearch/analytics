of many generations ask thy father and he will shoot the thai elders and they will tell thee when the most high divided donations there their inheritance when he separated the sons of adam he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of israel for the lord's portion is his people jacob is the lot of his inheritance he found him in a desert land in the west holding wilderness and he led him about he instructed him he kept him as the apple of his eye as the eagles steal it up her nest flooded over her young spread the blood abroad her wings take them build them on her wings so somebody let's say so oh so the lord alone did lead him and there was no strange god with him amen may the lord has his blessing for the ridicule of the world we can take our amen so when the most high divided the land as an inheritance when the most high the most high divided the land amen as an inheritance to the nations the most high god of israel he divided the land you see at the babylon babylon tower they had to spread around and the bible says here he sets their boundaries according to the numbers no not of their power not of their intelligence not of their riches not according to their abilities or how many citizens they are going to have but according the bible says to the children of israel so first of all god god had in his mind the sons of israel so before america was born god had in his mind the sons of israel before that he had germany he had in his mind the sons of israel so first he gave to other nations big nice countries with big resources with big possibilities for thailand if you have been in israel maybe you have seen something that you never expect not green land not forests no pastors even god when look to israel said i will give you a country that flows with milk and honey full of water fertile lions but to little israel a small land so but first we have just read here he had he thought first about israel so so israel get the best according to god himself first and then the other nations second isaiah 55 verse 8 said for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither your ways are not my ways declared the lord as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts so first he thought about you about your life about my life he had in mind god the creator before you came here he thought all about your life then he placed you and made you the way you are somebody let somebody say hallelujah so the brotherhood said in things there are to be just like your birth here i i said you was prepared god god knew you would be here and now you know even things that your parents done people think that that is isn't the visit from generation to generation but it is you you were all pre-planned by god nothing happens by chance with god he knows all about you somebody say he knows all about me he knows all about me he knows all about you he knows all about it it's all pre-planned pre-planned for many generations back so that you could be here tonight and the prophet asking did you know that amen amen we know that amen blessed be the name of the lord for the lord portion is his people verse 9 says so the lord's portion now the hebrew word he here is inheritance god had inheritance god has an inheritance his territory the same word is territory god has a territory my territory my inheritance my possession is in his people so you are to be his possession his territory his inheritance amen so he founded him he founded us verse 10 says in a desert land in a west land and he instructed us and he kept us as the apple of his eyes only to think about and he places us in a nest he you see first of all before you came here mama eagle has to head a nest for you baba eagle has to prepare first a nest for the little little eaglets to bring them in her nest so the eagle is a special bird it's build special it's bulls special to fly to fly in high places so she built her nest in not in the trees like other birds but the eagle mama eagle likes to fly in high places very high places she first of all she she's looking for a rock yeah she she likes to build her nest on a rock first she need to have a revelation everything has to be according to a vision somebody say vision god's vision mama eagle vision we are here because mama eagle had a revision so she started to build is a nest and an eagle is not made to stay on ground no his eyes are made for great height and can see in deep valleys but before she she have the little eagles she must prepare that nest she must prepare a nest for the eggs for the little eagles so she is looking first she is looking for a proper rock and then after she find that that rock that she feel comfortable with it the legal the big eagles it is the golden eagle love that and hmm she has in her mind the little eagle he had in mind you so she starts to build the nest she looks around and starts to pick up little sticks and thorns and branches from around the places she is flying over and she picked them this this little little rocks and sticks before before you has to come he has to build together some some things that is very necessary for your life so fourth generation before the prophet said before you come mama eagle decided you the place you are going to be born where i have to be born every every son of god where should be born so god started to put in your gene to add in your gene what he wanted you to be in order to fulfill his plan for your life god has a plan for your life god has a plan for my life god has a plan for all of us so before you came here god had already a plan for your life so i'm happy that god had a plan for me before i came here already he had a plan in motion he had a plan in his mind so he placed me he places you exactly in the place where you will fulfill what he had in his mind can you say amen so actually we we are the nest this is the nest that god created exactly the way he wanted us to be so don't be critical the way you look uh the way the the the if you are not so tall or everything is fine so he this is exactly the way he wanted us to be amen so don't be critical on this world on you god looks to you and you look good for him you you look perfect he is happy with you let us also be happy with him so she she built her nest but when the nest is ready for the little little was to come first of all you know what the mama eagle is doing she is looking for a lamb so she is looking for a lamb because you know before the little ones came she want to make a comfortable place she want them to feel good in the church she wants them to as you know a place where she can feed the eagle the little eaglets yeah yeah so she is hunting she is looking for the play from far when she find that lamb she is killing that lamb and before you came here the mama eagle had a lamb slain before the foundation of the world hallelujah to make you comfortable you know so because actually she needed a skin a skin lamp so she prepared the lamb skin and she placed it in the nest then the eaglet can come so the family you can the personality you have the country will come the way we look everything is perfect the prophet said here in a place that job job the oldest book in the bible was supposed to be even written before moses wrote genesis but the oldest book in the bible was speaking of redemption yet redemption was far way before that redemption is one is one of the oldest things in the bible did you know redemption was even before the plan of redemption was laid out before the world was ever formed think of that god for seeing making a way of redemption before he even made the world for the bible plainly says that christ was predestinated foreign and was the lamb of god slain before the foundation of the world that's right way before the world was made god had a plan of redemption blessed be the name of the lord so the eaglets have the same parents but they are different amen not all of us are the same so in our case mama eagle finds some eagles somewhere in the wilderness somewhere in united states somewhere in europe somewhere in africa somewhere in australia and laid them there on the sheepskin and started to feed them so and what a time they had when we came in the message everything was so smooth so nice the songs are so nice the music is sound so good we heard so many nice things we had a good fellowship everybody is like an angel so so when we come in the nest every we have a revival you remember when we came first in the message everybody was an angel a good angel we had really really a good time we know it was the first love and and everything was was really cool and we we could not wait at the gate of the church the doors of the church to be open and really it was uh it was something special and and we came happy to the church and to eat and to rejoice when we say amen saying we had a great time but the problem is that we are not made to stay in the nest forever we have we are in an age of the flying eagle so god is expecting us to fly and fly alone amen we need to fly so little eagles are sitting in the nest and mama eagle always come and a nice sermon is feeding them and and the times goes on and you know what is the problem when you are sitting and eating you gain weight and suddenly the place became a little big squeeze a little bit you don't have enough time like a place like before so slowly slowly because you started to grow it's starting to appear inconveniences you see it was is something slowly slowly changing but it is not because it's because you grow and you grow to a place when the place where god wants you to be he wants you to fly so because we are born to fly you are born to fly we are born to be in the rapture we are waiting for that revelation which is your identity you see the problem with the little eagle is he had spiritual amnesia the the only things that the little eagle needs is to remember who is he and if you remember who you are you have all the abilities that you need to fly everything is in the seat so staying all your life in the nest will produce problems sometimes strives because the eagles start to grow to mature and then features features appear and they started to change they look change the way they behave change they are not anymore in the first love you know they are different so mama once mama eagle wants them to fly and the fly in god's promises to fly in the promises that he allotted for this day mama wants don't to have their own experience it is good to have prophet experience it is good to have my experience but he wants you to have your experiences sometimes when you are too much fitted service after service sometimes we start to complain that's why in verse 11 we read here as the eagle filled up her nest so the lord alone leave them and she starts to flip her wings and and one day she has to pull the skin from under them and for the first time you start to realize that this nest is not so comfortable you are not enough predestinated to you know to be happy with this because you smile like papa you know you sometimes think like mama and we inherit a lot of sticks and when you come first and hear about predestination and wonderful things of god makes you happy but when the sheepskin goes out you start to feel uncomfortable because it is not a problem what is going on it's only a thing that mama wants you to understand you need to take off and you need to fly alone they don't take you by hand to fly you don't need to meet to fly you have the abilities in you to fly you are born to fly you are you only need to know who you are and this is rapturing faith faith is revelation rapturing revelation so rapturing revelation is your identity can you say manly tell eager the message just revealed who you are the message didn't make you what you have not been before the message just brought you your identity telling you that you come from god and you go back to god amen can you say praise the lord amen so this is the day when many inconvenience inconveniences appear so you start to feel that sticks and rocks and amen because you are called to be like him a flying eagle each one of us we are called to be that's why the anointing we have today is a flying eagle so everything have its time but you must fly and fly alone that's why paul said be changed say be changed be transformed in your mind we need to be changed be transformed in your mind change your mind from a lazy eagle to a soaring one be transformed be changed from a lukewarm condition to a person ready for the rapture from a former believer to a manifested son of god we are in an age of the manifestation of the stance not of a church not of a man not even of a prophet we are in the time of the manifestation when the sons of god came in themselves i say this right when the sons of god are coming in themselves they start to manifest are you one of them so we are in the time when the sons of god has to come in in manifestation and you are one of them from a helpless person to a strong believer in christ so i want to show you some igloos that god that we find god finded in the wilderness one of them is abraham avenue the father abraham father abraham was a little eagle in babylon so he got a lot of troubles i don't know if you know about it but he had a lot of trouble in babylon because god wanted him to let her to go to discover himself when god said there in hebrew come out in the world it's means come and reveal discover yourself so our journey your journey is to discover yourself this was a little eagle that god find having him in babylon another little eagle was moses moses moses rabbenu the teacher he was an eagle in the wilderness so he got a lot of problems he got a lot of sticks and rocks and turns and problems what was not nothing problem with it you know the only things he did with his own strengths with his own abilities with what he tried to do he had a dead egyptian but god wanted him to be a flying eagle and he has to fly to turbulences he has to fly to all the problems because god knows that he the eagles are built in such a way they can fly another legal that we find in the bible is elijah he was also in a cave he was in the depressive depression and he was hiding himself in a cave sometimes eagles are in caves but still a small voice do you think that it was an audible voice no it was the inside voice the wind in the in the pentecost was inside there you have something in you that is sensitive to that dimension hallelujah can you say hallelujah hallelujah amen another eagle that we find is elijah he was in the field plowing and he could he he could not be disobedient to the heavenly vision there is a heavenly vision everything is according and heavenly vision and this evening was also in the heavenly vision and you have been also in the heavenly vision but i want to pick up one because i knew that here are some a lot of young people may the lord bless the young people hallelujah it is it is finded in luke chapter 15 luke chapter 15 verse 11. we find out the bible jesus give this parables and he said to them luke luke 15 11 and he said a certain man had two sons a certain man had two eagles and the young told younger of them said to his father father give me the portion of goods give me the portion that followed to me actually the hebrew thought here is when you ask this you ask the death of your father so he said father give me a certain man had to start so the youngest man told give me my portion what is strange here is the question why he needed his portion why this little eagle will need its portion because he was rich enough he doesn't lack anything he have anything he wanted from his youth they will clean his mouth the money the father will give will not make him richer he all his life he had enough like one of us here you see you just are in a family and they take care of you everything is fine blessed be the name of the lord so but he wanted something different he didn't want it only to have the riches of his father this will not satisfy him because we find out after he get his portion he still remains some more days in the house he didn't left the house immediately so actually he was not greedy for money he didn't wanted more from his father but we understand that it was something different what he wanted so he he he wanted to have control of his own life he wanted to take his own decision this little eagle here he he he had enough with his father leadership so he wanted to have control of you of his own decision he thought he know better he saw that he can direct his life better than his father will told him to do things so he wanted to to win to do what he want when he want and how he want sounds you know isn't strange that sometimes we do likewise even if we don't show it many times you want to do similar the same way and verse 12 the bible said the younger said of the father give me and he divided unto them so both of them would have been blessed even the youngest also the oldest they both of them benefit by this what happened you know actually the father wants all the eagles to fly but some are a little bit you know faster have another personality at the end both of them will fly but he divided unto them and not after many days so he was staring in the house and and then after he get it he he he get his portion his liberty when he saw that he have his own possibility to control his life to rule his future to to to do what he decide to do to to to make us to do things the way he wants to do to to everything that to apply in his life his intentions because he he thought he knew better than his father he saw that his father make mistakes he saw that this message is not 100 the way should be so he stood a little bit in the house before he took the flight but in his heart already he had a desire to leave but finally he left he left with the bible said with all his substance he took all his substance he took he took his substance in another land he took all the substance the father gave him he took everything what he have been educated everything what he how he was trained all his dignity all his self-esteem he took it he took all his substance with him he all his blessings from the father i tell you the the many people who would like to be here to have to be bored in a message family many will be privileged to hear what you hear to know what you have to to have a pastor as you have to have ministers as you have to hear things that you hear to know things that you know but they don't have this privilege so we we are you we feel we are not feel proud against them we just are we want to thank the lord for what he does already you know actually judas was also predestinated you see the the grace that was given to you was not that you have been prayed destinated if you have been elected before you have been predestinated you have been elected so god was storing something from himself and placed it in you can you say praise the lord hallelujah amen so he took all his substance so we we need to add some some things so we read in the bible that what god blessed nobody can curse so we understand that we have been blessed from the beginning and will remain blessed forever you can say amen so what god already had what god already blessed we remain blessed but if only things that can can do if you this space you you are not happy with what you have how you say it you display the uh yeah you don't count it too valuable what you got you can curse yourself and the devil knew that nobody can curse you only if you curse yourself so if the devil can make you to do things wrong then you will curse yourself amen so he cannot curse israel did israel that not does it himself he cannot curse you till you don't do it alone you are blessed because the father thought about you and cared about you and choose you to be his son and his daughter so before the world began you god already thought about you so you meet people in the in your life somebody are maybe not so wealthy or you you go to work in a job and you look to your boss and you thought what wonderful what blessed are the people you you need to realize that they are blessed because of you because before that man came god had you in your mind he chooses your boss he choose choose your neighbors he chooses every person that you are going to come in your life so he is going to use them according to his purpose in your life if you are not listen to him he will rise up somebody against you is all preplanned they are predestinated to test you they are powerful they they make babylon in assyria stronger than israel because god knew one day israel will go astray so he needed somebody wiser and stronger to bring them in god's will because god possession and ghost territory is not the soil it's you it is the only place that god inherits process and territory so when you walk you know now you are his possession you are his territory you are his domain wherever you go god goes blessed be the name of the lord so what happened with the youngest son was he wanted his life in his hand and the in enemy release against him a spirit unthankfulness he was tossed about a thousand about spirit making him to be restless how he became restless like like saul in the bible he became unhappy unhappy of his church he became unhappy of his family why happen why the people are unhappy of his pastor of his church of his friends of his parents even they are unhappy of themselves because he is a demon he is a spirit they are tossing the people about is a tormenting spirit and they make you unhappy anyhow it's just a spirit sent to torment you to make you curse yourself even if you are elected sometimes and many times we do mistakes so he left his house he left his church he left his brother he left his environment he took all his substance this little eagle with him verse 14 says and after he had spent all after he spent all his substance the only things that give you value is this message if you go in some other places you will find out they will call you different but you hear when you come in this message they call you eagle they call you a son of god an elect they call you bride they call you miss jesus christ this is no message as this message is the power for the the most precious light ever ever came in this world and after he spent all after he spent everything what he get after he spent all his power all his gifts like the church in the beginning after he lost his first love after he he he spent all what the father had with a citizen in in a foreign land in the far away land a famine arouse in that land a famine arouse in that land when the famine arrives in that land we are in the time of famine he began to be in want he realized that he missed something he missed something so he was looking around looking for something and he went and joined verse 15 to a citizen of this country after he lose his confidence in himself after he lose his position after he lose his peace after he lost his comfort after he lost his self-esteem after he lost his dignity after he lost all what the father gave him after he spent all what the message gave him he became desperate and he went and joined himself to a citizen we find here that this citizen has no name is a no-name citizen citizen and that citizen look what happened he said send him into the fields to feed swine a son of god an eagle after he became he was not any more thankful what he had after he he received all this blessing for the father after he gets the substance of the father after the after the the god was opened his heart and giving him the best he had the message of doubt after he spent all these he the fame and the famine came in the land and he became to be in one and he went and joined joined himself to a citizen and that citizen gave him on the commission always this citizen with no name was satan satan was happy satan saw him and when he sees a daughter of god the son of god he this is what he wants from the beginning he is not happy with somebody else to be worshipped he will like a son of god a daughter of god to come so when he saw coming he was so happy so he was he was commissioning him and he was sending him into his fields to feed swines so he has to make his with his with his abilities instead serving god he has to serve satan and while he was there the little eagle verse 16 says he was looking to the pigs now he was thinking and dirty he was not anymore a message believer how he used to be he was not anymore a special person he was not anymore a privileged person he was not anymore the same looking it used to be he he after he spent all his substance after he divided the post the inheritance of the father after the famine came he was there in wand and he would had a great desire looking to the pigs how he was eating husks the swine did it and no man gave him you know nobody will give you because god god don't want you to have them because you belong to him and he wants you he wants me he cannot [Music] he cannot see you going too far so the sun from the high calling to the pig pen dirty and stinky but while he was there pondering sometimes go to pond what we have been what we could became he was pondering and suddenly something happened mama eagle saw him down there and the prophet said while he was there in a pig pen the lord sent the angel of the lord to him he beated elijah with a half an hour the angel of the lord beated eliezer to rebecca with half an hour before the message came to him to you somebody has to beat somebody has to come before you before to you the angel of the lord has to come to you and the prophet said the angel of the
