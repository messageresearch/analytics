[18:54] thinking about the many that
[18:56] here are the church home folks that has
[18:59] worked together to try to get your meals
[19:02] together and try to
[19:04] help out in different ways um help me
[19:06] with the ministry and my and my home and
[19:10] you know i'm not much of a cook
[19:12] and my cook went to heaven
[19:14] so um some of these earthly cooks that
[19:16] kind of picked up the
[19:18] this slack and helped me out and i
[19:20] certainly appreciate that i want to just
[19:22] tell the home folks
[19:24] you make me proud amen god bless you

[20:32] true christian i witnessed the mighty
[20:35] russian wind coming i witnessed that i
[20:38] felt the power of gods it shook i was
[20:40] with them that spoke in tongues

[52:23] then answered peter and said unto jesus
[52:25] lord
[52:27] it is good
[52:29] for us to be here
[52:31] if thou wilt
[52:33] let us make three tabernacles
[52:36] one for thee
[52:38] one for moses
[52:40] and one for allies
[52:43] while he yet spake behold a bright cloud
[52:46] overshadowed them
[52:48] and behold a voice out of the cloud
[52:51] which said
[52:53] this is my beloved son
[52:55] in whom
[52:56] i am well pleased
[52:58] hear you him i may love to be remembered
[53:01] today as we pray
[53:03] we'll spy our heads together if you
[53:04] would
[53:07] lord jesus it's with joy and
[53:11] sadness too that we come to the
[53:15] last service of this special time
[53:19] we so enjoyed your presence enjoyed the
[53:21] word
[53:22] the ministry of the brothers
[53:25] enjoy the fellowship of one another the
[53:27] songs
[53:28] it's been an awesome time
[53:31] and yet many of us will head toward home
[53:33] today we'll go our separate ways
[53:37] but it reminds us that one day we will
[53:39] have a great
[53:40] gathering and we will never have to say
[53:43] goodbye
[53:46] hasten that day lord jesus
[53:48] help me i prayed to be able to get out
[53:50] of the way father that you can speak
[53:52] through me something that will be
[53:54] an encouragement a help to your people
[53:58] only you can take
[54:00] a service and be able to custom fit it
[54:03] so every hungry heart will get something
[54:07] i cannot do that lord nor could any
[54:09] other man
[54:10] but it's simply in your hands so we
[54:12] commit ourselves to you
[54:14] in the name of the lord jesus
[54:16] and the saint said
[54:18] god bless you you may be seated
[54:24] thank you
[54:29] i thought that i was
[54:32] ready for today
[54:35] i've studied several things and looked
[54:38] at several things
[54:39] and
[54:40] caroline went back to our place last
[54:42] night and
[54:44] i studied again and again and i was
[54:47] convinced i
[54:48] knew which way i needed to go
[54:51] but this morning before daylight
[54:54] the presence of god
[54:56] came in where i was
[54:59] and
[55:00] woke me up
[55:01] and began to deal with me about what i
[55:04] wish to speak to you about today
[55:06] and i want to use
[55:08] three words
[55:10] going
[55:11] back home
[55:14] going back home
[55:16] and first of all let me say that
[55:20] whenever i
[55:21] or my my friends my brothers here
[55:24] sitting behind me stand and
[55:26] say it's an honor to be able to be with
[55:28] the bride and speak to the bride
[55:30] that's not just words that's not cliches
[55:34] it's not just something nice to say
[55:37] but we really mean that
[55:39] with all of our hearts
[55:40] i counted such an honor and a privilege
[55:42] no matter where i've been around the
[55:44] world to speak to the bride of christ it
[55:47] is highest honor of my life
[55:49] i was raised in kentucky just a little
[55:51] hillbilly boy i never thought i'd
[55:53] probably ever even leave the state
[55:55] going to school i didn't have any
[55:57] friends i was saved when i was 12 years
[55:59] old
[56:00] most of the boys heckled me at school
[56:02] all the time ridiculed me made fun of me
[56:05] laughed at me they'd bring pornographic
[56:08] magazines to school and i would cover my
[56:10] eyes and they would knock me down on the
[56:13] the parking lot at school and they would
[56:16] tear my hands away from my face and i
[56:18] would close my eyes and they'd take
[56:20] their fingers and open my eyelids and
[56:23] try to make me look at things that was i
[56:25] knew was not right
[56:27] so the most of my life i wanted friends
[56:30] friends you know real friends
[56:33] and whenever the lord
[56:35] brought me to himself and his grace and
[56:37] then allowed me to be able to stand with
[56:40] what i consider to be some of the
[56:41] greatest men of god alive today
[56:53] and i don't limit it just to these few
[56:55] brothers that are here but brothers
[56:57] of like precious faith around the world
[57:00] so it has been one of the honors of my
[57:02] life to be able to stand and speak to
[57:04] the queen of heaven
[57:06] and looking at that i realize that
[57:09] speaking words most of us preachers that
[57:12] have done it for very long i just turned
[57:14] 65 in july and i've been preaching since
[57:16] i was 18. brother tim's been preaching
[57:19] longer than i have some of his brothers
[57:20] here
[57:21] by the kenyan no doubt longer than i
[57:23] have but you do learn how to talk a
[57:25] little bit anyway after all of those
[57:28] years but you realize it's not what you
[57:31] can say
[57:32] it's not just being able to get words
[57:34] that you think would be a benefit but
[57:36] it's following the spirit of god
[57:39] and following exactly what he knows that
[57:42] we all need
[57:44] and our our setting today is one of a
[57:47] great paradox and in our minds it's
[57:49] probably hard for us to comprehend what
[57:52] it must have been like on this great
[57:55] mountaintop experience
[57:57] after six days when the lord jesus
[57:59] called three of his closest disciples
[58:02] they were of the intimate circle and he
[58:05] calls them up with them and there they
[58:07] go into the presence of god and matthew
[58:09] said he was transfigured before them and
[58:11] his face did shine as the sun
[58:15] and his raiment was white as the light
[58:18] now that within itself would have been a
[58:19] phenomenal visitation but then comes
[58:22] moses and elias and they are talking
[58:26] with him
[58:27] how we love mountaintop experiences
[58:30] don't you love them don't you so love
[58:33] when you are soaring in heavenly places
[58:36] in christ jesus
[58:37] and this must have been one of the
[58:39] highlights years and years later as
[58:41] peter is writing his epistle and he says
[58:44] that they were up on the holy amount and
[58:46] he he rewards it the way that he that
[58:49] you remember reading in the scripture
[58:51] beautifully the way he was able to
[58:52] capture it and you can tell the impact
[58:55] of that he never got over it no doubt
[58:57] john never got over it again whenever he
[59:00] was there on the isle of patmos it was
[59:02] something that so marked their lives and
[59:05] yet we know that
[59:07] god never ordained that his people would
[59:11] live
[59:12] on these type of mountains
[59:14] every day of their life
[59:16] now we have these meetings and we call
[59:18] them special meetings and they are they
[59:21] are special yet we realize that every
[59:24] time we come to the house of god it
[59:26] should be special is that right it
[59:28] should be special now here the lord
[59:30] willing wednesday night evening light
[59:32] tabernacle they will gather together
[59:34] again and i'm not sure who's going to be
[59:36] preaching wednesday who the special
[59:38] singers will be but yet we know those of
[59:41] you that have streamed any of these
[59:42] services just from the local assembly
[59:44] you know that this is a great church
[59:46] have a great ministry great music great
[59:49] singers it's just a great place that's
[59:51] all there is to it but yet really part
[59:53] of what makes this meeting special too
[59:57] is because you visitors are here as well
[1:00:01] so special meetings aren't just that
[1:00:04] well even like tabernacle hosted this
[1:00:06] and they are such a special people and
[1:00:08] such a special ministry and such special
[1:00:11] music and special special special so
[1:00:14] whenever we go home we go back to our
[1:00:17] churches and we don't have that special
[1:00:19] no actually that's not the way that it
[1:00:21] is
[1:00:22] actually each one of you visitors have
[1:00:24] had have helped make this a special
[1:00:27] meeting
[1:00:28] is that right each one of these speakers
[1:00:31] that have come
[1:00:32] those of you that have driven and spent
[1:00:34] part of your livelihood you have made
[1:00:37] that a special thing but there's
[1:00:39] something about us as human beings that
[1:00:41] we love special things in our lives
[1:00:45] and there's special places that we all
[1:00:48] like to eat and there's special things
[1:00:50] that we like to do and there's let's
[1:00:53] just be honest there's preachers that we
[1:00:55] like to hear that seem to minister to us
[1:00:58] in a special way it's not that we really
[1:01:00] love them any more than others but god
[1:01:03] has somehow connected us with their gift
[1:01:06] and they just seem to minister to us in
[1:01:08] such a way well it's just beyond our
[1:01:11] explanation really and they will always
[1:01:13] have a special place in our hearts is
[1:01:16] that right now that's that's just being
[1:01:17] honest today there are special things
[1:01:20] that god gives us each of us have had
[1:01:22] special experiences with god some of
[1:01:24] them we can share some of them we cannot
[1:01:27] share they are given to us just between
[1:01:30] us and our master so there's something
[1:01:33] about us that we have an inclination to
[1:01:36] lean towards special things special
[1:01:39] occasions special people special
[1:01:42] mountaintop experiences all but alas we
[1:01:45] know that even with the life of the lord
[1:01:48] jesus
[1:01:49] after he left this great place of this
[1:01:53] mountaintop experience and what a
[1:01:55] life-changing thing that this must have
[1:01:58] been but yet whenever he comes down from
[1:02:01] the mountain
[1:02:03] from walking in this great thing and it
[1:02:05] was a prefigure of the great body change
[1:02:09] that he was going to have
[1:02:11] actually the lord jesus allowed his body
[1:02:15] to experience what it was going to be
[1:02:18] like when he raised from the dead on
[1:02:21] that third morning
[1:02:23] now think he elijah and moses appear as
[1:02:26] well and here we see a glimpse of the
[1:02:29] future kingdom we see the glorified son
[1:02:32] of god we see the resurrected dead we
[1:02:35] see the transfigured dead and then we
[1:02:37] see the mountain those men there on the
[1:02:39] mountain and then at the bottom of the
[1:02:41] mountain we see people outside of the
[1:02:43] kingdom gates that do didn't even have
[1:02:45] an idea what was going on so it was a
[1:02:49] prefigure of the glory of god now you
[1:02:52] think after something that great
[1:02:54] happened could there ever be any trials
[1:02:58] after that
[1:03:00] could there ever be any hardships after
[1:03:03] that now oh my how we have fed this week
[1:03:07] on the word how we have rejoiced in the
[1:03:09] presence of god some of you probably
[1:03:12] ain't stood in church this long and god
[1:03:14] only knows how long you couldn't even
[1:03:17] sit down you were so caught up in the
[1:03:20] presence of god it was awesome was it
[1:03:22] not
[1:03:26] but after today
[1:03:29] we're going back home
[1:03:32] now i guess the important thing that
[1:03:35] i would like to ask you about it is what
[1:03:39] are you going to take back home with him
[1:03:43] now while i've been here
[1:03:45] i've had an older sister in my church to
[1:03:47] pass away
[1:03:48] within 30 minutes or so her daughter
[1:03:51] passed away
[1:03:53] i have a double funeral to do
[1:03:55] on tuesday night
[1:03:59] how am i going to leave
[1:04:03] and preach that funeral
[1:04:05] all elated and jumping up and down the
[1:04:08] way i was here friday night
[1:04:10] probably not
[1:04:12] am i going to be so
[1:04:15] carried away with what i received and
[1:04:18] i'll go grab that family and tell them
[1:04:20] oh you would have been in louisiana oh
[1:04:22] hallelujah to god glory to god
[1:04:24] no their hearts are so broken
[1:04:27] can you imagine losing a mother and a
[1:04:30] sister within 30 minutes time
[1:04:33] you see the great mountaintop places
[1:04:36] that god allows us to have are many
[1:04:40] times preparing us
[1:04:43] for the weeks
[1:04:44] that we'll follow
[1:04:47] now i know we don't like to hear this
[1:04:48] and believe me i didn't want to preach
[1:04:50] it but
[1:04:51] i've learned to follow my boss
[1:04:54] he's got great plans and great benefits
[1:04:58] but if you don't obey him his hand can
[1:05:00] really hurt when he whoops you
[1:05:02] so i've learned a long time ago it's
[1:05:04] best to follow him
[1:05:07] some of you no doubt have come to this
[1:05:09] meeting
[1:05:10] you came with great burdens you
[1:05:13] left a husband at home
[1:05:16] that was not where he needed to be with
[1:05:18] god
[1:05:19] you left with issues on your job
[1:05:23] you left with issues
[1:05:25] in your church
[1:05:27] you left with family problems marital
[1:05:30] problems
[1:05:32] and although you have got touched and
[1:05:35] helped and ministered to
[1:05:37] no doubt some of you when you go back
[1:05:39] home
[1:05:40] those problems will still be there
[1:05:44] and the truth of it is there may be more
[1:05:47] once you get back home
[1:05:49] so what are we going to take with us
[1:05:53] when we go back home
[1:05:55] what are these meetings going to
[1:05:58] benefit us
[1:06:00] as the people of god
[1:06:02] so are we going to lose our joy
[1:06:06] are we going to lose our ability to
[1:06:09] stand and tell that preacher seek him
[1:06:12] boy seek him
[1:06:16] are you going to be so sad when you go
[1:06:18] to your church wednesday night
[1:06:21] that the preacher can't even get an amen
[1:06:23] out of it
[1:06:26] you know i find that many times
[1:06:29] people
[1:06:30] they look at their own home church and
[1:06:34] they say
[1:06:35] our church ain't nothing but we either
[1:06:37] we don't do this at our church and we
[1:06:38] don't do that at our church oh my people
[1:06:41] come to a meeting like this where a host
[1:06:43] church is hosting a great meeting many
[1:06:46] folks want to go home and pack
[1:06:47] everything they've got and move to that
[1:06:50] church
[1:06:51] because they think that's the normal
[1:06:54] every every church service
[1:06:56] well let me just give you a rude
[1:06:58] awakening that is not the way it is
[1:07:00] [Applause]
[1:07:03] hallelujah
[1:07:06] see what you got me into sir
[1:07:09] they were shouting last night now
[1:07:11] they're pouting
[1:07:13] [Applause]
[1:07:15] now you see people saying that
[1:07:18] that atmosphere is is allowed to be
[1:07:21] there no no no friend now i'm not saying
[1:07:23] that even in life tabernacle they have
[1:07:25] tremendous services regular service is
[1:07:27] tremendous
[1:07:28] but there's something special about
[1:07:31] special meetings
[1:07:33] and yet the people many times that will
[1:07:36] attend them then they go home
[1:07:38] today brother andrew glover will be
[1:07:40] preaching at happy valley but andrew
[1:07:42] glover will be missing
[1:07:45] part of happy valley's amen corner you
[1:07:48] know why
[1:07:49] they're here
[1:07:52] part of the people who would have
[1:07:54] normally pulled on brother andrew are
[1:07:57] not there today they're sitting over
[1:07:59] here they're sitting over here they're
[1:08:01] sitting in different spots
[1:08:03] one thing that makes a meeting like this
[1:08:06] it's so paramount is each of you
[1:08:08] bringing your lick of fire with it
[1:08:11] and bringing it together and our
[1:08:13] expectation my you could feel it from
[1:08:15] the very first night the expectation of
[1:08:18] the people of god was so high
[1:08:21] i just wonder how it'd be if we do that
[1:08:23] in normal services at home
[1:08:25] [Applause]
[1:08:35] but you see there's something about
[1:08:37] these mountaintop experiences oh my we
[1:08:40] love them
[1:08:41] notice in luke chapter 9 as luke catches
[1:08:45] this and he writes about it and he said
[1:08:47] and it came to pass
[1:08:49] that on the next day when they were come
[1:08:52] down from the hill
[1:08:54] much
[1:08:55] people
[1:08:56] met him
[1:08:59] uh-oh
[1:09:01] now he had peter james and john
[1:09:04] they were select men they were men that
[1:09:07] love god they love supernatural
[1:09:09] experiences
[1:09:10] so the very next day after
[1:09:14] transfiguration
[1:09:16] you go to meeting people
[1:09:19] and if you've got people you've got
[1:09:21] problems
[1:09:23] you've got a big church got big problems
[1:09:26] got a little church still got big
[1:09:28] problems
[1:09:33] now notice the very next day
[1:09:35] and behold a man of the company cried
[1:09:38] out
[1:09:39] saying master i beseech thee look upon
[1:09:41] my son for he is my only son and lord
[1:09:44] spirit taketh him and he suddenly cries
[1:09:48] out and it tears him that he foameth
[1:09:51] notices again and bruising him hardly
[1:09:55] departed from him
[1:09:57] and i besought my disciples to cast him
[1:10:01] out and they could not
[1:10:04] so here the lord jesus after soaring
[1:10:07] into this great dimension of god
[1:10:10] is met with much people much people has
[1:10:14] many needs of course
[1:10:16] here he comes with this poor man
[1:10:19] bringing his son and he's so demon
[1:10:21] possessed that the young man is foaming
[1:10:24] at the mouth and the spirit tears him
[1:10:28] and oh it must have been horrible
[1:10:30] and he brings him to the disciples now
[1:10:33] these are the future men of the message
[1:10:37] they're the men that's going to
[1:10:38] propagate this message and carry it on
[1:10:41] so the lord jesus comes straight off the
[1:10:43] mountain and he hears that some of his
[1:10:46] men
[1:10:47] have now failed one of the first tasks
[1:10:51] so after this great mountaintop
[1:10:54] experience he's hit immediately with the
[1:10:57] needs of the people and he's also hit
[1:11:00] with the failures of those who are the
[1:11:03] future work of the extension of his
[1:11:06] ministry
[1:11:08] right after a mountaintop experience
[1:11:12] now you can take this the way you want
[1:11:14] to
[1:11:15] i believe with all of my heart
[1:11:17] almighty god is speaking to somebody
[1:11:20] here today
[1:11:21] well to be honest with you it's more
[1:11:23] than one somebody
[1:11:26] but remember when difficult times come
[1:11:29] we don't want to throw everything that
[1:11:32] we have got
[1:11:33] all the blessings all the encouragement
[1:11:36] all the joy
[1:11:38] all the elevation and the presence of
[1:11:40] god and just lay it aside and say what
[1:11:43] good did it do me to even go to that
[1:11:45] meeting he said well if it hadn't been
[1:11:47] for that where would i have been when
[1:11:49] this hard time hit me
[1:11:52] oh my
[1:11:53] notice this jesus answering said oh
[1:11:56] faithless and perverse
[1:11:59] generation straight from transfiguration
[1:12:03] to faithless and perverse
[1:12:06] oh my goodness
[1:12:09] guess what friends we're all heading
[1:12:11] home
[1:12:13] where was jesus
[1:12:15] home
[1:12:17] now as much as transfiguration was a
[1:12:20] wonderful thing this was what he
[1:12:22] experienced of course this was the type
[1:12:25] of glory that he said father i desire to
[1:12:28] have the glory that i had with me before
[1:12:30] the world was so this was what he
[1:12:33] experienced before the logos became a
[1:12:36] man but since she'd been now a man for
[1:12:39] all of these 30 years this was now home
[1:12:42] so home was what dealing with people
[1:12:45] that were demon possessed
[1:12:47] home was now dealing with people that
[1:12:50] fell short of the glory of god home was
[1:12:54] now people that constantly had it needs
[1:12:57] and troubles and heartaches and
[1:12:59] difficulties and jesus had to come down
[1:13:02] off of the mountain and go back home
[1:13:07] oh
[1:13:08] aren't you glad that he did
[1:13:10] now what if he would have said hey you
[1:13:12] know what i love this so well i i really
[1:13:15] don't want to go back home i honestly
[1:13:17] don't want to leave this shekinah
[1:13:19] because i've been out of it now for 30
[1:13:21] years
[1:13:22] i don't want to go out of this anymore i
[1:13:24] love this this is where i came from so
[1:13:27] peter james and john go ahead and go
[1:13:29] back down y'all go back down and y'all
[1:13:31] just do the best you can and just barely
[1:13:33] hang on or whatever you can do i ain't
[1:13:35] going back i'm sorry i am not going back
[1:13:39] i'm so glad he did
[1:13:41] because he had not died yet
[1:13:43] he had not given his blood hallelujah
[1:13:47] what is transfiguration doing it is
[1:13:50] preparing him for calvary
[1:13:54] it is preparing him for death
[1:13:57] and for his resurrection
[1:14:04] hallelujah
[1:14:06] notice in luke chapter 9 verse 46
[1:14:13] and then there arose a reasoning
[1:14:16] among them
[1:14:18] which of them should be the greatest
[1:14:21] wow
[1:14:24] wonderful
[1:14:25] no doubt he said
[1:14:27] i'm back home
[1:14:32] i'm back home
[1:14:34] now here he already had some
[1:14:36] disappointment because disciples
[1:14:38] couldn't cast out this devil
[1:14:41] and then they begin to argue among
[1:14:43] themselves
[1:14:45] i believe i'm the best preacher
[1:14:48] there's more people stream my services
[1:14:50] than yours ain't it how many of you got
[1:14:51] streaming yours on youtube anyway
[1:14:54] well i think there's more people at our
[1:14:55] church well i i feel what when i got up
[1:14:58] to sing a special song i believe people
[1:15:00] clap 13 seconds longer for me than they
[1:15:03] did when you sing
[1:15:04] [Applause]
[1:15:07] yeah we're home
[1:15:10] come on friends we're still human beings
[1:15:13] we're still human beings
[1:15:23] would you care to finish this
[1:15:28] i'm at home huh
[1:15:30] oh man
[1:15:32] i don't know why i get asked to take the
[1:15:34] last service of these meetings anyway
[1:15:39] and then there arose a reasoning among
[1:15:41] them which of them should be
[1:15:44] greatest
[1:15:47] jesus perceiving the thought of their
[1:15:50] heart
[1:15:51] took a child and set him by him
[1:15:54] and he said unto them whosoever shall
[1:15:56] receive this child in my name
[1:15:59] receiveth me and whosoever shall receive
[1:16:02] me receiveth him that sent me for he
[1:16:05] that is least among you all
[1:16:08] the same
[1:16:09] shall be great
[1:16:11] can you imagine coming from having your
[1:16:14] body changed
[1:16:16] a temporary resurrection
[1:16:19] a
[1:16:20] glorification of the presence of god and
[1:16:23] you come straight from that just a day
[1:16:25] before and you've got people arguing
[1:16:28] about i'm gonna be bigger than you are
[1:16:29] why you are not you've got a big long
[1:16:31] ugly nose nobody ain't gonna like you
[1:16:34] why you don't do this and you don't
[1:16:36] don't tell me i'll tell you one thing
[1:16:38] they like hearing me preach better than
[1:16:39] that don't sit there and look at me like
[1:16:41] that don't go on amongst the preachers
[1:16:44] it goes on among singers it goes on
[1:16:46] amongst musicians why because it is home
[1:16:51] can't you see friend the reason we need
[1:16:53] a body change is not just to make us all
[1:16:56] young again
[1:16:58] we don't need to just be young again we
[1:17:02] have to be changed
[1:17:04] our bodies this part of us must be
[1:17:08] changed
[1:17:20] oh not you john
[1:17:23] not you
[1:17:28] and john answered and said master
[1:17:32] we saw one casting out devils in thy
[1:17:35] name
[1:17:37] and we
[1:17:38] forbade him
[1:17:42] because wanted to meetings in louisiana
[1:17:52] he's not part of our clique
[1:17:55] [Applause]
[1:17:58] all of this
[1:18:00] after transfiguration
[1:18:05] my goodness something y'all gonna be
[1:18:06] dragging your tracks in aren't you
[1:18:07] saying oh dear god i don't want to go
[1:18:09] home
[1:18:12] sam y'all just extended your vacation
[1:18:14] for another week
[1:18:16] they're gonna be here wednesday night
[1:18:19] [Applause]
[1:18:22] i think me and carol will stay
[1:18:25] [Applause]
[1:18:27] why
[1:18:28] because we don't like trouble
[1:18:30] look friends if you're born again it is
[1:18:32] your nature
[1:18:34] to love peace
[1:18:36] you think these men love to preach hard
[1:18:38] you see any god called man loves to
[1:18:40] preach hard and whenever god goes to
[1:18:42] demons you say no lord no i don't want
[1:18:44] to preach that i don't want to go that
[1:18:45] way why we love peace and yet we are
[1:18:48] some of the most profound warriors
[1:18:50] that's ever been on the earth how do
[1:18:52] peacemakers become professional fighters
[1:18:55] it's because that dual nature inside of
[1:18:58] us we are called to withstand evil we
[1:19:01] are called to preach the word we're
[1:19:03] called to help the children of god and
[1:19:06] yet we love peace
[1:19:09] we love it
[1:19:13] john the beloved disciple
[1:19:16] that leaned over on jesus chest
[1:19:20] one of the most intimate
[1:19:22] places
[1:19:24] and it was given to john
[1:19:26] but look at john's makeup
[1:19:30] john answered and said master we saw one
[1:19:32] casting out devils in my name
[1:19:34] we forbade him because he followeth not
[1:19:38] with us
[1:19:41] jesus said unto him forbid him not
[1:19:44] for he that is not against us
[1:19:47] is for us
[1:19:52] and it came to pass when the time was
[1:19:53] come that he should be received up he
[1:19:56] steadfastly set his face to go to
[1:19:58] jerusalem
[1:19:59] and he sent messengers before his face
[1:20:01] and they women entered into a village of
[1:20:03] the samaritans to make ready for him and
[1:20:06] they did not receive him
[1:20:12] because his face was as though he would
[1:20:14] go to jerusalem and when his disciples
[1:20:17] james and john here we go it blessed
[1:20:19] little john again
[1:20:22] saw this they said lord
[1:20:24] we'll thou that we command fire
[1:20:28] to come down from heaven and consume
[1:20:31] them
[1:20:32] you want a scripture even as elijah dead
[1:20:40] straight
[1:20:41] after transfiguration
[1:20:45] i got to be honest with you i don't
[1:20:47] think i'd ever even realize all this
[1:20:48] happened after transfiguration until
[1:20:50] before daylight this morning
[1:20:53] that's the way the lord does though
[1:20:56] but he turned and rebuked them and said
[1:20:58] ye know not
[1:21:00] what manner of spirit
[1:21:03] ye are of
[1:21:07] john
[1:21:09] john
[1:21:10] one of the ones who was there look at
[1:21:12] peter lord it's good for us to be here
[1:21:15] let's build three tabernacles
[1:21:17] one for you one for moses one for elijah
[1:21:20] let's just stay here that's i said it
[1:21:23] praise god
[1:21:25] let's all move to brother tim's church
[1:21:28] what do you say
[1:21:29] i'll call home and i'll get a bunch of
[1:21:31] u-hauls and we'll all move here
[1:21:34] he's in the office now saying dear god
[1:21:36] no
[1:21:39] [Applause]
[1:21:46] oh my goodness
[1:21:48] so what are you folks that are visitors
[1:21:51] here
[1:21:52] what are you going to take from these
[1:21:53] meetings when you go to your home church
[1:21:55] wednesday night
[1:21:57] and next weekend
[1:21:59] you know many folks and it goes in our
[1:22:01] around our message that many live from
[1:22:04] special meeting to special meeting to
[1:22:06] special meeting to special meeting
[1:22:09] and if you're not careful our youth can
[1:22:10] do the exact same thing they go from one
[1:22:12] youth meeting to another to another to
[1:22:14] another and then you see some of them
[1:22:17] same use in their home church they don't
[1:22:19] even raise their hands
[1:22:22] they don't stand up
[1:22:25] you can't hardly get them to do anything
[1:22:28] well come on now saints
[1:22:31] why they jump from mountain to mountain
[1:22:34] to mountain to mountain
[1:22:37] and is that really what we're trying to
[1:22:39] build in the message
[1:22:41] is that what god wants us to be look at
[1:22:44] these guys were the way they were and we
[1:22:46] know the reason that they did this they
[1:22:48] was not born again
[1:22:50] oh my they did not have the holy ghost
[1:22:53] yet
[1:22:57] so do we want whether it's young or old
[1:23:00] do we want to just live from special
[1:23:02] meeting to special meeting to great
[1:23:04] climax after another climax no friend
[1:23:06] that's not what god wants us to be but
[1:23:09] take what you've got oh by brother donny
[1:23:11] my church they don't jump and they don't
[1:23:13] shout well take what you've got and if
[1:23:16] you've got something genuine maybe it'll
[1:23:18] break out among them
[1:23:21] well praise the lord
[1:23:25] remember brother branham says revival is
[1:23:28] not you and your church it's you
[1:23:31] it's you as long as you've got a holy
[1:23:33] ghost revival whether nobody else there
[1:23:36] wants it or not you're going to have
[1:23:38] revival because you're drinking from the
[1:23:41] water of life
[1:23:50] going back home
[1:23:52] some of y'all driving
[1:23:53] some of y'all flying brother david told
[1:23:55] me he's leaving out this afternoon at a
[1:23:57] shreveport flying going to atlanta from
[1:23:59] atlanta to geneva i think he told me
[1:24:01] amsterdam then geneva oh i know brother
[1:24:04] david well enough to know he's going to
[1:24:06] be packing some of this home and
[1:24:08] whenever he preaches again there in his
[1:24:10] congregation you'll be able to see a
[1:24:12] little bit of louisiana anointing on him
[1:24:15] you're going to be able to see a little
[1:24:16] bit of louisiana influence on him why
[1:24:19] because he's going to take what he
[1:24:21] received from the mountaintop experience
[1:24:24] will he have problems and troubles no
[1:24:26] doubt he will but is he going to let
[1:24:28] them get him down absolutely not he's
[1:24:32] going to say i went there i received and
[1:24:34] i brought it back with me
[1:24:37] praise god i didn't just bring souvenirs
[1:24:41] from the us but i brought a new fresh
[1:24:44] anointing i am that's what you want to
[1:24:47] do you don't want to just take some
[1:24:50] souvenirs from louisiana but you want to
[1:24:53] take a refreshing from the presence of
[1:24:56] the lord and when satan meets you you
[1:24:59] say back off the devil
[1:25:01] hallelujah off devil i receive the
[1:25:05] freshness from the presence of my lord
[1:25:22] going back home
[1:25:24] exodus chapter 32
[1:25:27] verse 10 and moses turned and went down
[1:25:29] from the mount
[1:25:31] the two tables of testimony were in his
[1:25:33] hand the tables were written
[1:25:35] on both their sides the one on the one
[1:25:37] side and the one on the other
[1:25:39] were written
[1:25:40] the tables were the work of god
[1:25:43] listen now
[1:25:45] the work of god and the writing
[1:25:50] so just in case
[1:25:52] some of you all think you had the first
[1:25:54] tablet
[1:25:56] moses used a tablet
[1:25:58] [Applause]
[1:26:04] there's no way we can imagine what that
[1:26:06] must have been like
[1:26:09] to watch god
[1:26:12] take his finger i probably wasn't
[1:26:13] left-handed the way i am but
[1:26:15] god
[1:26:18] in the form of humanity
[1:26:20] right on this it must have been so
[1:26:22] sacred
[1:26:24] so holy
[1:26:26] so awesome
[1:26:30] you know the story
[1:26:33] and when joshua heard the noise of the
[1:26:35] people as they shouted he said unto
[1:26:37] moses there is a noise of war in the
[1:26:39] camp
[1:26:40] and he said it is not the voice of them
[1:26:42] that shout from mastering neither is the
[1:26:44] voice of them to cry for being overcome
[1:26:46] but the noise of them that sing do i
[1:26:48] hear
[1:26:49] joshua heard one thing the prophet of
[1:26:51] the age heard something else
[1:26:53] and it came to pass as soon as he came
[1:26:55] lying to the camp that he saw the calf
[1:26:58] what
[1:27:01] the prophet is in the mountain of god
[1:27:04] with a mountaintop experience
[1:27:07] receiving the law of god written by the
[1:27:09] very finger of god and they're down
[1:27:11] there worshiping around the calf
[1:27:14] and they were naked
[1:27:17] dancing shouting hollering screaming
[1:27:23] well that works on a pastor's attitude
[1:27:29] i want you to notice now it came to pass
[1:27:31] as soon as he came down to the camp that
[1:27:33] he saw the calf
[1:27:36] and the dancing
[1:27:38] and moses anger
[1:27:40] waxed hot
[1:27:42] and he cast the tables out of his hands
[1:27:46] and break them
[1:27:48] beneath the mount what in the world
[1:27:51] would cause a man of god
[1:27:55] to take the only inscription that god
[1:27:58] had ever written with his own finger
[1:28:01] what caused it
[1:28:03] back home
[1:28:10] you see god meant for moses to visit the
[1:28:12] mountain but he didn't tell him to pack
[1:28:14] his suitcase and move up there
[1:28:18] don't you understand why we're going to
[1:28:19] love heaven so much
[1:28:21] we get to pack our stuff and go away
[1:28:26] no more carnality
[1:28:29] no more fallen humanity no more trouble
[1:28:32] no more heartaches no more difficulty we
[1:28:35] get to pack our soul with the goodness
[1:28:37] of god and leave our humanity oh my that
[1:28:41] was born of such desire behind and get a
[1:28:45] glorious body locking under his glorious
[1:28:48] body fair he will fail you well
[1:28:51] [Applause]
[1:28:54] friends let's just be honest
[1:28:56] unless we're changed
[1:28:58] unless we are so changed to the core
[1:29:02] heaven would not be a really nice place
[1:29:04] to live in
[1:29:06] because some of you would want to live
[1:29:07] in a certain section
[1:29:10] and you wouldn't want to get out of that
[1:29:11] section
[1:29:12] you'd want to go to this certain spot
[1:29:14] there'd be neighbors that have tempers
[1:29:16] and there's there'll be none of that
[1:29:18] there that day why because we will all
[1:29:21] be changed not just new
[1:29:23] but changed
[1:29:25] change your humanity brother wrong
[1:29:27] mentioned it last night it's so stinking
[1:29:29] rotten humanity that we deal with every
[1:29:31] day of our life i know we don't like to
[1:29:33] hear it quoted but brother branham said
[1:29:34] his worst enemy was william branham
[1:29:38] i wonder how god feels about it when we
[1:29:41] idolize the prophet's greatest enemy
[1:29:45] we idolize his flesh we worship him into
[1:29:48] the message people do they idolize his
[1:29:51] humanity and make him like god and he
[1:29:53] said that was his greatest enemy
[1:29:56] you might as well go ahead and say amen
[1:29:58] your greatest enemy is not your wife
[1:30:00] it's not your husband come on preach
[1:30:02] women out it's not your little boy it's
[1:30:04] not your little girl your greatest enemy
[1:30:07] is yourself
[1:30:10] you are the one that gets in your way
[1:30:13] you are the one the reason you're not
[1:30:15] any closer to god today
[1:30:18] [Applause]
[1:30:27] you imagine him saying god
[1:30:30] do i have to go back home
[1:30:34] i love being here
[1:30:37] this is so awesome
[1:30:39] could you do that again
[1:30:42] could you just let me watch you right
[1:30:45] i'm not the first man that's ever on the
[1:30:47] earth but none of them ever saw you
[1:30:48] right before
[1:30:50] nobody's ever seen this exceeding great
[1:30:53] glory moses entered into that pillar of
[1:30:54] fire the prophet said become god when he
[1:30:57] come out
[1:30:58] can you imagine he was so changed they
[1:31:01] had to put a veil over the man's face
[1:31:04] because the shekinah of god was all over
[1:31:07] him
[1:31:07] in one minute shekinah was there in the
[1:31:10] next anger
[1:31:13] and it wasn't god and it wasn't
[1:31:15] cherubims and it wasn't angels and it
[1:31:17] wasn't zooms and seraphims that brought
[1:31:20] out the human agitation
[1:31:23] it was his people
[1:31:26] oh jesus
[1:31:30] people have that about them
[1:31:33] now for the next few minutes everybody
[1:31:34] can remain silent don't have to raise
[1:31:36] your hand no smiling no friendling no
[1:31:38] moving so you won't tell on yourself but
[1:31:40] no doubt there are people here or
[1:31:41] there's probably some streaming that's
[1:31:43] what it is
[1:31:44] that's why god had me to preach this
[1:31:48] and you poor little sweet darlings are
[1:31:50] having to sit here and listen i know
[1:31:53] what it is happy valley's an hour ahead
[1:31:55] of this

[1:31:58] ander and there's some sorry person that
[1:32:00] happy valley that needs to hear this
[1:32:02] sermon and god made me preach it for
[1:32:04] them and you poor little darlings for
[1:32:07] having to listen to it

[1:32:23] we need
[1:32:24] help
[1:32:26] we need help
[1:32:28] it's our humanity that clashes
[1:32:31] how many of you have people at work
[1:32:34] and they know how to push your buttons
[1:32:40] or there's people you go to church with
[1:32:43] dear god i'm going to step outside and

[1:33:08] got it all right
[1:33:10] right between the eyes
[1:33:14] but don't you understand sometimes god
[1:33:16] allows those people in our lives
[1:33:18] to show us
[1:33:20] ourselves
[1:33:23] i used to think god would let people
[1:33:25] come to my church
[1:33:27] so i could help them
[1:33:30] i could really help them
[1:33:33] but after several hundred i began to
[1:33:36] wonder if maybe god hadn't sent them
[1:33:39] so i could be helped
[1:33:42] [Applause]
[1:33:45] oh my
[1:33:47] how we love maytag christians as pastors
[1:33:51] boy you just install them
[1:33:53] get them saved filled with the holy
[1:33:55] ghost hook them up they're there for 45
[1:33:58] years they never cause an issue they
[1:34:00] never cause a problem
[1:34:02] they're there wednesday sunday they pay
[1:34:05] their tithes they're there anybody you
[1:34:08] need to do this and that they're there
[1:34:10] boy whatever it is they just chugga chug
[1:34:12] chug chug chug chug chug chug chug
[1:34:16] man they're faithful they're praying for
[1:34:18] you they don't have an old critical
[1:34:20] spirit on them
[1:34:23] every pastor ought to have at least one
[1:34:24] of them in a church
[1:34:29] you got more than one you're really
[1:34:30] blast
[1:34:34] but the truth of it is
[1:34:35] when god saves us and fills us with the
[1:34:37] holy ghost
[1:34:39] we're not automatic made tag are we
[1:34:43] but a belt will break
[1:34:45] and a wheel will slip and a cog will go
[1:34:48] bad
[1:34:49] and an electronic gadget will mess up
[1:34:53] it's not a marvel to me that i could
[1:34:55] love the lord god
[1:34:57] my marvel is how he could love me
[1:35:01] and all my humanity
[1:35:04] all of my mistakes come on that children
[1:35:07] oh don't you appreciate his love for you
[1:35:11] i never i was wasn't a
[1:35:12] sinner the way some of you were a sinner
[1:35:14] and never drank never smoke never cussed
[1:35:17] never run around never done any of that
[1:35:19] give my heart to the lord whenever i was
[1:35:20] just a young boy but the lord has had to
[1:35:23] deal with me much longer after i got
[1:35:25] saved than the years before i got saved
[1:35:29] and what have i done for him well it
[1:35:31] looks like i've already done anything
[1:35:33] but yet i look at myself and i think god
[1:35:36] please help me how can you be so
[1:35:39] merciful and so long suffering remember
[1:35:41] the bible tells us as the people of god
[1:35:44] when peter wrote about the seven virtues
[1:35:46] that was to be manifested down through
[1:35:48] the seven church ages and the last one
[1:35:50] that he wrote about was the one that
[1:35:52] sits right beneath the capstone which is
[1:35:55] brotherly kindness
[1:35:57] now don't let that scare you that's a
[1:35:59] scarecrow that's been put up before the
[1:36:01] message people but it should scare crows
[1:36:03] and not eagles
[1:36:04] that's right brotherly kindness is
[1:36:06] something that the prophet said must be
[1:36:08] added to the church
[1:36:10] i hope you understand that he said the
[1:36:12] faith of jesus christ the virtue of
[1:36:14] jesus christ the knowledge of jesus
[1:36:16] christ right on down to the very end to
[1:36:18] where he said the brotherly kindness of
[1:36:21] jesus christ you think why would the
[1:36:23] lord jesus need that don't you
[1:36:25] understand why that we need a high
[1:36:28] priest which can be touched by the
[1:36:30] feeling of our infirmities i'm so glad
[1:36:33] today that we still have a high priest
[1:36:35] on the throne of god that can understand
[1:36:38] our humanity
[1:36:40] he understands our humanity the lord
[1:36:43] jesus himself understood what it was
[1:36:46] like to be a human i'm so glad today
[1:36:49] that he's still there on the right hand
[1:36:52] of the throne of god to intercede for
[1:36:54] our humanity when we say lord i don't
[1:36:56] want to do this i don't want to do that
[1:36:58] oh god we have not a great angelic being
[1:37:02] setting there but we have a glorified
[1:37:06] human body
[1:37:07] [Applause]
[1:37:09] hallelujah a glorified human body that
[1:37:14] can remember his own humanity he can
[1:37:18] remember weakness he can remember pain
[1:37:21] he can remember heartaches and sadness
[1:37:24] and disappointment that's your high
[1:37:27] priest
[1:37:29] not an angel
[1:37:31] not gabriel not wormwood oh my paul said
[1:37:34] there's one mediator between god and man
[1:37:38] the man
[1:37:40] the man
[1:37:42] christ jesus
[1:37:52] after god spared isaac on mount moriah
[1:37:58] the great supernatural experience that
[1:38:00] god made known to abraham
[1:38:02] and he revealed himself as jehovah jireh
[1:38:07] what a phenomenal thing
[1:38:09] god created
[1:38:10] a ram
[1:38:12] and the bible says that the ram was
[1:38:14] caught in the thicket
[1:38:17] by his horns
[1:38:19] so the ram of course was
[1:38:21] ares
[1:38:22] type of christ
[1:38:24] he was caught in the thicket the thicket
[1:38:27] is the briars
[1:38:28] thorns the brambles
[1:38:30] the things that have roots in the earth
[1:38:34] so the ram was caught
[1:38:36] by a plant which was attached to the
[1:38:39] earth
[1:38:41] you
[1:38:43] you
[1:38:44] made
[1:38:45] we're what caught the rag
[1:38:48] we caught the ramp what is the horns the
[1:38:51] brother said a symbol of his power
[1:38:54] we caught the lamb
[1:38:56] and held him because we needed a kinsmen
[1:39:01] redeemer
[1:39:07] i don't think you've ever noticed this
[1:39:08] or not
[1:39:10] but the very next chapter
[1:39:13] verse one
[1:39:15] the next written word
[1:39:18] of the further part of abraham's history
[1:39:20] is this
[1:39:22] and sarah
[1:39:24] was a hundred and seven and twenty years
[1:39:27] old
[1:39:28] these were the years of the life
[1:39:31] of sarah
[1:39:33] and sarah died in kurdish arba the same
[1:39:36] as hebron
[1:39:37] in the land of canaan and abraham came
[1:39:39] to mourn for sarah
[1:39:42] and to weep
[1:39:43] for her
[1:39:45] so after this mountaintop experience
[1:39:49] his dear beloved sarah
[1:39:52] dies
[1:39:54] friends you notice well as i do
[1:39:56] there are things about the will of god
[1:39:59] that can be so painful
[1:40:02] you remember the prophet saying i think
[1:40:03] it was 1951 in one of the life stories
[1:40:05] and he said father you have broken my
[1:40:08] heart
[1:40:10] over
[1:40:11] and over
[1:40:12] again
[1:40:14] but i thank you for it amen
[1:40:18] the will of god can be so painful
[1:40:22] when god will take a loved one out of
[1:40:24] your life a child a wife a husband or a
[1:40:26] dear friend whatever it is and he's oh
[1:40:28] god no no no god don't do it please god
[1:40:31] i beg you and god takes him anyway
[1:40:35] you said god why would you do that
[1:40:37] his will
[1:40:38] can be so painful and yet we believe
[1:40:41] it's perfect do we know
[1:40:43] [Applause]
[1:40:44] all these things that come after great
[1:40:48] elevations in the presence of god
[1:40:50] so yeah abraham walks off of that i
[1:40:53] wonder brother ron
[1:40:54] had god not revealed himself to abraham
[1:40:57] in the form of jehovah jireh how would
[1:41:00] abraham have dealt with such a blow
[1:41:03] that's this
[1:41:06] listen to the prophet as he says that
[1:41:08] this one the wings of a dove one time up
[1:41:10] in the mountains and watching an eagle
[1:41:12] and seeing him fly away you know my
[1:41:13] story of it i said it's good to be here
[1:41:15] lord like peter we could build three
[1:41:18] tabernacles
[1:41:20] but now watch him
[1:41:21] but down at the foot of the mountain
[1:41:24] the sick
[1:41:26] and the afflicted are waiting
[1:41:28] the lost
[1:41:30] and the dying
[1:41:32] are waiting
[1:41:34] so let's do what we can while it's day
[1:41:37] and sunday
[1:41:39] there will be the wings
[1:41:41] of a white eagle
[1:41:44] that will come down and bear us
[1:41:47] away
[1:41:51] in this sermon brother brown tells us
[1:41:54] why would he wait to heal me being an
[1:41:56] old man
[1:41:57] he's going through this cycle again
[1:41:59] every seven years seven eighths he says
[1:42:01] where i am right now 56 years old every
[1:42:04] seven years he would get this sickness
[1:42:06] in his body and this his stomach all
[1:42:08] kinds of people would come up and be
[1:42:10] healed all types of miracles would
[1:42:12] happen and yet the prophet himself
[1:42:15] suffering
[1:42:16] and he sees the lies dove
[1:42:19] as he waited and waited and long to see
[1:42:22] that dove
[1:42:24] and in his mind he thinks
[1:42:27] he's going to be healed
[1:42:30] but actually he's going to be healed
[1:42:33] of his humanity
[1:42:36] not his stomach trouble
[1:42:41] little did he know that a little bit
[1:42:43] over a month from this time
[1:42:46] he would be in a horrific automobile
[1:42:48] accident
[1:42:49] many bones in his body broken
[1:42:53] his poor leg mangled and twisted around
[1:42:55] the steering column of his car
[1:42:59] twisted and broken
[1:43:01] a horrible way
[1:43:03] to leave this world
[1:43:06] leaving the meetings at shreveport which
[1:43:09] was some of the paramount services of
[1:43:11] his ministry
[1:43:13] and he thought within himself oh my it's
[1:43:16] going to come again this is going to
[1:43:18] happen that's going to happen oh it's
[1:43:19] laying right there
[1:43:22] it was all right
[1:43:24] so he come off of that mountain
[1:43:27] and went down into the valley
[1:43:29] of the shadow
[1:43:31] of death
[1:43:38] so friends
[1:43:40] what are you going to take home with you
[1:43:43] after the fall meetings
[1:43:45] of october 21.

[1:43:51] come from various places
[1:43:54] we've looked forward to these meetings
[1:43:55] for months and months

[1:44:31] crawfish or something they eat down

[1:44:47] but we want more than a true faith
[1:44:51] we want to take something that our faith
[1:44:54] has risen to a new plateau
[1:44:57] my haven't these brothers done an
[1:44:59] outstanding job
[1:45:04] they have they've done a wonderful job
[1:45:14] look wrong i'm sitting by talking in the
[1:45:15] office before we came out i said you can
[1:45:17] tell these meetings are so different
[1:45:18] than the last time when i was here a
[1:45:20] couple years ago anyway you can just
[1:45:22] catch the mind of god
[1:45:24] and the way he had the ministers to go
[1:45:26] you know what did that your needs
[1:45:29] your needs not so much that they chose
[1:45:32] to go that way but your needs dictated
[1:45:35] what they preached and it shows where
[1:45:37] you are it shows that many of you have
[1:45:39] been struggling it shows that many of
[1:45:42] you been going to great traumatic times
[1:45:44] in your life
[1:45:46] and god said
[1:45:47] i want my sons to preach faith builders
[1:45:50] i want my sons to preach things i wanted
[1:45:52] to give my people something that when
[1:45:54] they leave and pull off of that parking
[1:45:56] lot them devils are going to say you
[1:45:58] better get out of their way

[1:46:02] got something to take home
[1:46:07] hallelujah they're going to have
[1:46:09] something to meet the enemy with

[1:46:17] something they're gonna say satan out of
[1:46:20] my way
[1:46:26] hallelujah
[1:46:28] oh don't we love it whenever the
[1:46:30] anointing is here
[1:46:32] i believe any one of these sisters could
[1:46:33] not preach in this meeting
[1:46:36] we don't even believe in women preachers
[1:46:38] a preacher that couldn't preach in this
[1:46:39] kind of anointing he probably ain't even
[1:46:41] gone in the first place
[1:46:43] but you know well enough to know many
[1:46:44] times that's not when satan hits you
[1:46:47] it's not when he when all this great
[1:46:49] anointing is around you but it's when
[1:46:51] you get by yourself it's when you get
[1:46:53] back on the job it's when you get back
[1:46:55] to that husband that ain't right or that
[1:46:58] wife that ain't right and you say god

[1:50:21] it ain't gonna be long
[1:50:25] let me close with this
[1:50:32] it won't be very long at all
[1:50:35] a few more settings of the
[1:50:36] sun till in heaven
[1:50:42] he will step behind the curtain as it
[1:50:44] were
[1:50:45] you see peter james and john brother
[1:50:47] branham all those that living down for
[1:50:49] the ages
[1:50:50] have never yet got to see the lord jesus
[1:50:54] remember when he came behind the curtain
[1:50:55] time
[1:50:56] he said i won't say jesus said can't see
[1:50:58] him yet
[1:51:00] you see the way he's dressed right now
[1:51:04] would be unbecoming
[1:51:06] for them to see him
[1:51:08] because he's still acting high priest
[1:51:16] but when the last one has come in
[1:51:18] filled with the holy ghost and set
[1:51:20] in the kingdom of god
[1:51:23] i don't know how long it'll be maybe
[1:51:25] five minutes maybe an hour
[1:51:27] but he will step behind the curtain as
[1:51:29] it was
[1:51:30] and we'll change his clothes
[1:51:35] and when he walks out the angels look
[1:51:37] and say
[1:51:41] today is the time
[1:51:46] you see whenever we meet him in the
[1:51:47] rapture
[1:51:48] we're not seeing as it were blood on his
[1:51:50] garments and a high priest and no
[1:51:54] but escape
[1:51:56] he comes to claim his inheritance
[1:51:59] and what does he do the first thing he
[1:52:00] does is call for you to come
[1:52:08] so when he steps out from behind the
[1:52:09] curtain as it were
[1:52:11] and they look and there he's dawning
[1:52:14] that rope
[1:52:16] don't you understand when he changes
[1:52:18] clothes
[1:52:19] it's a sign
[1:52:21] we're fixing
[1:52:25] to go
[1:52:30] no doubt there's people right in this
[1:52:31] building today that will not die
[1:52:36] but you will change your mortal cause
[1:52:40] hallelujah for an
[1:52:42] immortal body
[1:52:44] is the way before it's easy oh no as all
[1:52:47] the troubles laid aside oh no how will
[1:52:49] we do it one day at a time by the grace
[1:52:52] of god we will get up oh but what if i
[1:52:54] fall then you'll wipe yourself off and
[1:52:57] say god forgive me i'm gonna rise and
[1:52:59] try one more time lord i'm not giving up
[1:53:03] i'm not giving up i'm pressing the
[1:53:06] battle
[1:53:15] therefore if you have died
[1:53:18] what happens
[1:53:20] if you've entered into the theophany
[1:53:22] in the sixth dimension the theophany
[1:53:25] comes to the earth
[1:53:27] to pick up the redeemed body

[2:29:28] heart of men
[2:29:29] men who are different places in america
[2:29:32] different churches
[2:29:34] but yet lord through the harmony of the
[2:29:36] preaching of the gospel lord the
[2:29:37] messages went right hand in hand lord
[2:29:40] ministering and dealing with hearts and
[2:29:41] lives
[2:29:43] even to this very morning lord as you
[2:29:45] dealt with brother donnie
[2:29:46] lord we're all going home
[2:29:49] but how are we going
[2:29:50] [Music]
[2:29:52] are we going to go home different are we
[2:29:54] going to go home healed are we going to
[2:29:55] go home delivered are we going to go
[2:29:57] home still bound by the same besetting
[2:29:59] sins and cares and strifes of this world
[2:30:01] but father i believe tonight or this
[2:30:03] morning rather that lives have been
[2:30:06] eternally impacted by the preaching of
[2:30:08] the gospel
[2:30:10] i believe as we heard yesterday morning
[2:30:11] the dynamics are here to give life to
[2:30:14] the word and i believe there's young
[2:30:16] people there's middle-aged people
[2:30:18] there's old people that are giving life
[2:30:20] to the word and we have seen
[2:30:21] supernatural power come to the body of
[2:30:23] christ we've seen healing take place
[2:30:26] we've seen deliverance take place we've
[2:30:28] seen lord struggles take place but
[2:30:30] father we've seen a mighty champion
[2:30:31] stand with this dear god and i just pray
[2:30:34] right now fathers you go with each and
[2:30:36] every one of us father may they not go
[2:30:38] home alone may they not go home back to
[2:30:40] their difficulties by their self under
[2:30:42] fear and in trepidation word that they
[2:30:43] got to face it all by herself but father
[2:30:46] i believe there's a champion that stood
[2:30:47] here this weekend and that same champion
[2:30:49] is going to go with them he's going to
[2:30:51] make a way when there seems to be no way
[2:30:53] he's going to make lord he's going to
[2:30:54] bring total deliverance in the churches
[2:30:56] and the homes and the families on the
[2:30:58] job whatever it may be i believe the
[2:31:00] great champion michael has stood up for
[2:31:02] this bride
[2:31:04] and i'm asking father today that this
[2:31:06] not be the last battle this not be the
[2:31:08] last fight god but you continue to equip
[2:31:11] us
[2:31:12] each and every morning lord when we rise
[2:31:14] and shine and we give glory to the lord
[2:31:16] father may your word just be expounded
[2:31:18] to us now go with each and every one
[2:31:21] fathers we depart this place
[2:31:24] may we not depart your presence

[2:31:32] us tomorrow morning or may we bring him
