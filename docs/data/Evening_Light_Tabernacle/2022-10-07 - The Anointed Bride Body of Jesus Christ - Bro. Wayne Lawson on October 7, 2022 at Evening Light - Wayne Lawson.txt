we ask these things in the mighty name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen we thank you for it father in Jesus name in Jesus name amen and God bless you tonight if you have your Bibles we would like to go into the word of the Lord I would just like to read a scripture tonight from Isaiah chapter 10. and verse 27 Isaiah 10 and verse 27. we thank the Lord for his word tonight and we thank God that he's preserved a Bible that we could read from in Isaiah chapter 10 and verse 27 and it shall come to pass in that day that his burden should be taken away from off thy shoulder and his yoke from off thy neck and the Yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing because of the anointing may God bless his words you can be seated tonight I want to speak to you just shortly tonight on a a text here from this scripture but I want to title this the anointed bride body of Jesus Christ the anointed bride body of Jesus Christ the prophet says in Christ The Mystery of God revealed he said there would come a time forth he would Express himself in the fullness of his godhead deity through his church he would have preeminence in his church oh my the anointed man now the anointed people to bring back the anointed bride and bridegroom anointed by why accepting what Eve turned down and Adam but coming back with the anointing of the word because he said my word is spirit see he Anointed with the word what Eve turned down he comes back and we accept he comes back and we accept the anointed man now the anointed people to bring back the anointed bride and bridegroom to bring back the anointed bridegroom and I take my text from there tonight the anointed bright body of Jesus Christ you know I believe tonight that the anointing matters I believe that the anointing matters the anointing changes things you know I realize that there is a lot of people in the world that don't believe the anointing does matter they don't respect the anointing it matters not to them but I believe to any Bible reader they know that the anointing is of most important to the Church of the Living God it is a great difference in your life or whether that life is an anointed life or it's just a carnal life amen and God shows us in the scripture of how much the anointing matters now in the Old Testament the scripture that I read to you is a scripture from the book of Isaiah and it's actually dealing with a time that when uh when God showcases what what difference the anointing makes uh when that when when when the enemy attacks the anointed of God now the scripture that I'm reading here has to do with a time that when the Assyrians were great it's just before Babylon this is when the Assyrian army is is grew up in great power and they're controlling the world and they're actually attacking Israel now what has happened in previous scripture here is that Israel has been attacked and overtaken by Assyria now when we say Israel you must realize that that is actually a time after Solomon when Israel has been divided into two different kingdoms now we're going to be dealing with the Israel as a kingdom and Judah as a kingdom there's ten tribes in Israel and there's two tribes in Judah and they have separate Kings and many times you'll hear them talk about the king of Judah or the king of Israel they're talking about Kings of two different kingdoms they're all the children of Abraham but they've been divided after the rule of Solomon the next Kings they begin to divide and so the scripture tells us of course that God raised up the Assyrians and he did it because that there had come great uh there had come great uh idolatry in Israel and God always allowed uh Israel to be punished whenever it moved into idolatry and it moved away from the Living God but now the thing that that the world or that the that the rest of the world didn't know is that Israel was God's chosen people so if God allowed something to happen to them it was only because God allowed it to happen and God would allow like he did with the Assyrian army he allowed them to go in they overtook Israel and they literally carried them away now you've heard of the Lost ten tribes of Israel and many people say well they lost 10 tribes now what that's talking about is it's talking about the ten tribes that were living in Israel they never had a returned home in their Homeland like it was in the days later when Jerusalem was carried away into Babylon and they were only there for 70 years and then they returned back to Babylon so they returned back so those two tribes never were lost but the other ten tribes were lost and Scattered into the world that's what is going on now those tribes have been gathered up and sent back into Israel but what we find out is is that whenever the these ten tribes are destroyed under the Assyrian army that it makes this a Syrian King it makes him uh boastful it makes him prideful you know it's kind of much like Nebuchadnezzar because that he had a victory he decided that he was greater than the god of Israel because he whipped Israel he thought surely I'm greater than the god of Israel but he didn't recognize that the only Power he had over Israel is that God gave him that power or he never would have been able to do that so what happens is he got boastful in his mind and then began to say well I'm going to go down there and do to Jerusalem and to Judah what I've done to Israel and when when he begins to do this Jerusalem begins to get worried the king of Judah begins to to struggle and and the next thing you know then he goes to the prophet and he begins to say to him well we're going to be destroyed just like them others are going to be destroyed amen but that's when the scripture is written when the prophecy of Isaiah comes back to him and he says see but the burden off of thee shall be broken and the scripture said the Yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing now look what he's saying to them because of the anointing that is upon Jerusalem amen things will not be the same here as what they were in Israel now see the devil a lot of times he he attacks people he attacks all kinds of people he does all kinds of things but just because he can do it in one place doesn't mean he can do it in the other I I think sometimes we ought to remind the devil that he is a limited devil hey man I don't care the devil likes to run around like he can do anything he wants anytime he wants any way he wants but let me assure you tonight the devil is limited and the Bible actually is full of places where God put a limit on the devil and allowed him to do certain things but wouldn't mind to do other things to let you and I know amen that no matter what the devil thinks amen God's still is in control at all times of our lives and everything that happens to us I mean job's a great example isn't he amen but God told that devil he can do whatever he wants but then he draw the line to show you can only go so far come on y'all know it's all in the prophecy in the Book of Genesis when the Bible said let the woman seed shall Bruce the head of the serpent and he said what did he say he said but the head of the serpent shall bruise the heel of the woman's seed and watch amen it means it's only limited to the heel so the devil is limited of what he can do in the Church of the Living God God I don't think there's probably a greater example of that and sitting right behind us tonight whether Ron Spencer sitting here amen I don't know now we're working on three years amen and just a few years ago they were telling brother Ron amen get your preparations you'll only be here a few days amen this cancer is going to take you you're not going to I think four months is what they were giving him amen but here we are three years later and he's still with us now you said preacher amen there's still cancer there's still sickness I'll tell you Ron Spencer's sick but sickness is not in dominion over at Ron Spencer's life hey man I'll tell you this and I want that devil to know that you can make these bodies sick but you cannot control our lives and you have no dominion over the Church of the Living God I want the devil to know I know he's a limited demon I know he's a fallen angel and he has limits and he cannot do what he wants where he wants High wants there is a God who looks over the children of Israel there's a God that moves upon the heart of the children of Israel I believe it tonight I believe that God Amen allows things in our lives but God knows exactly so can I say this very clearly Cancer Cannot kill a Believer amen nothing can take a Believer amen the only reason a man leaves this Earth is when God is finished with that man and until that time the devil can throw everything he wants but it will do no good he said that's pretty bold that's the word of God that's the word of God so amen the prophet is telling these these the king of Judah listen I know it looks bad I know Israel looks like but just because that's happening to Israel doesn't mean it's going to happen here I hope you're hearing me because that Devil's raging against our young people he's raging against it all over the world but just because he's destroying all the youth in this world doesn't mean he can put his hands upon the Church of the Living God listen to me young people you are not just another young people you are not another just another group of people you are the anointed of almighty God God has poured his anointing upon the Church of the Living God and with give us some of the greatest young people in the world sets in the message of the hour not because you're members of evening lives not because you're members of true words Tabernacle not because you're a member ever has a new life Outreach but because God chose you before the foundation of the wearer and is Anointed you to say in and the most wicked of all ages but our God has confidence and what he did will stand in the midst of all this trouble now Isaiah wanted this man to know him he Isaiah is a Bible preacher I love how Isaiah does things because he don't just say something Isaiah goes ahead and makes a point scripturally with him if you look at the 26th verse of the same chapter of Isaiah in the 10th chapter 26 verse look what he said he said the Lord of hosts shall stir up a Scourge for him according to the slaughter of the median at the rock of orb as he was at the rod see so shall he lift up after the man of Egypt now look what he's saying to him Isaiah says to the king of Judah look this devil that's approaching you I'm going to make it like it was in the days of Gideon at the rock of Orem now I know y'all study your Bibles but that rock of orbs a pretty good study now what it's about is that when Gideon took 300 men and whipped 135 000. isn't that beautiful he took 300 million and whipped 135 000 because the anointing was upon his life the anointing matters when you go to war the anointing matters when you're looking for deliverance the anointing matters because the anointing can bring you a Deliverance in the midst of an unequal odds and and look what happens 135 000. now here's here's the story though because there was a bunch of the of the children of Israel I think it was actually ephraimax who was actually a part of the original men that come out to go to war with Gideon and God turned them away and sent them home but there was a group of the original ones that come out that wasn't able to go fight they didn't go home they went and waited to see maybe they could get a chance in battle so they didn't go all the way back home they didn't they didn't just say hey we ain't on the front charge and we're just gonna go home forget about this amen but they went somewhere and waited and just so happens maybe we can get in this battle and the scripture records that whenever they begin to root the enemy that the enemy begin to run and the leaders of the midianites took out in a certain direction and Gideon called for the backups to enter into the into the the battle and they chase down the leaders of those medianites and they found them hiding in the rocks of orb now they call it the rock of orb now it wasn't the rock of or being it was just big rock out there in the middle of the place but this is where one of the leaders of the of obedience hid behind that rock now I tell you it's a pretty powerful thing to know this because what the moral of the story is that you can't hide from God when God becomes your enemy when God takes up the battle that that leader of the million I start I'll cause all this trouble and I run off and I'll hide a rock somewhere but listen there is no rock that can hide a man there is no rock that can hide a devil amen if God would take up a battle there is no devil can hide from the God of Justice and Grace this is somebody said well amen I serve a God of Peace I'll tell you why he is a God of Peace but he's also a God of War and when our God begins to fight for you I tell you what it is he'll dig up those enemies and Destroy them everyone you know what he'll do he'll cause them to name places after the defeat of the devil hundreds of years later Isaiah is literally telling the king of Judah I'm gonna make these Assyrians like the rock of orb in other words amen if you're wondering go out there and look at those rocks and they're a testimony to the god that saves by 300 and destroys 135 000 because of the anointing if you don't trust the anointing the rock of Orab is there to testify that when a man trusts the anointing of God that the god of Abraham can change the situations of his life let me say something to you then I I trust the anointing of God I trust the power of the Holy Ghost to change things [Applause] yeah he said well brother Wayne what do you saying the scripture says that he would make him like the slaughter of the medianites and they would also make it like the rod upon the sea can you imagine the the children of Israel all knew the story of how God swallowed an entire Army in a sea it only happened one time in Scripture and it was one of the great stories in the history of their of their forefathers so he said these these these Assyrians are going to be like those Egyptians yeah they're going to swim with too much lead now in Second Kings it tells the same story because what happens is that Judah is is worried about it and the Bible said in the 19th Chapter 32nd verse Second Kings it said therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the king of Assyria I like this thus saith the Lord thank you concerning the king of Assyria he shall not come into the city nor shoot an arrow there nor come before it with a shield nor cast a bank against it by the way that he came it's the same way he's going to return and shall not come into this city saith the Lord I will defend the city to save it for my own sake for my servant David said oh my goodness it's been hundreds of years since God had sent anoint David it's been a long time ago people thought well that that don't matter that that old man poured that oil over that man's head that has nothing to do with nothing it's just an old man in a house pouring some oil and saying some words over some runny little kid but all these years later a serious trying to attack but the words of a prophet spoke over a child of God still had anointing and I'll tell you something tonight because of the anointing upon David as Syria could not take Jerusalem that might not mean a lot to people what this William Branham has said over this Church of the Living God Amen but it matters to God it might not matter what was said in some little room when the spirit of God was poured over to you and some words were spoke over your life it might not mean anything to the to the church world what William Branham said concerning a bride but when it comes to God I want you to know because of the anointing because of what was spoken over your life there's no devil can defeat you there's no power that can hold you let me say this the devil cannot come now this city and the same way he came he will return he said preacher you you're off a boat I know the anointing of God Is Spoken over this generation and there is a group of Believers that have put under the anointing of a prophet of God and when those words were spoken over them they're not just little words they're effective words the powerful words listen if you don't think they ain't powerful that was the mystery of why David could whip Goliath amen with only a slingshot mystery of why David was not scared of Goliath because he was already anointed your life can say what he wanted to I'll destroy you I'll tear you down amen but David was already anointed so he wasn't scared of that battle he wasn't worried what was going to happen because the anointing was already setting upon him and listen tonight you know how to fear that devil you don't have to fear what he said he's going to do with your life and how he's going to destroy because he's a liar to begin with and there's an anointing of God upon the Church of the Living God that anointing says we will not die but we shall live and we will live in power and we'll live in authority said brother Wayne what's the mystery I'll tell you the mystery is the anointing what's the difference in these churches it's the anointing the anointing is the difference you say preacher the anointing don't matter oh but for David's sake for the anointing's sake for the anointing sake because I anointed David they will not take this city that's pretty powerful he said preacher did God back it up God back to them the Bible says in the 35th verse it came to pass that night the angel of the Lord went out and smote in the camp of Assyria a hundred four score and five thousand a hundred and eighty five thousand Assyrians died that night because of the anointing the king of Judah never touched the head of one of them Assyrian soldiers but the anointing went out and the anointing destroyed the enemy that was gonna hold I say tonight amen that what we really need is to get the anointing of God in the church and to turn it loose and let it kill every devil and to kill every problem let it kill every situation let the anointing loose in the Church of the Living God come on you got problems we can't fix you got situations we cannot counsel you through but there's a God who can come down in the building tonight and change every situation so behind this stuff I'll tell you what these these these things are coming they're built up to destroy us all these things are being built up and and I see the enemy Rising them this I see the enemy Rising here I sing that calm yourself worry not let the fear pass from you because of the anointing [Music] so preacher what are you saying I'm saying in Isaiah 54 the same Prophet said no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that rise against thee in the Judgment thou shall condemn this is the heritage of the Servants of the Lord and the righteousness is of me saith the Lord does it matter he said A thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand out thy right hand but it shall not come neither brother the anointing matters the anointing matters when God hath anointed Amen in the Book of Luke the fourth chapter the scripture tells us a story that even the son of God had become anointed isn't that something the Son of God became anointed Luke chapter 4 and verse 17 the Bible said and never delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah which had opened the book and he found the place where it was written and I have a time to preach there but I'll say this the book of Isaiah 66 books 66 chapters it's the only book Jesus could take and have the whole Bible so he opened the book and found the place I love it he found the place that was written of him he identified with the anointing that was upon him and what it was going to do he knew exactly what that anointing was for because that the prophet had spoke over his life listen I know there's a bunch of Pentecostals out here and they're shouting and screaming over the anointing amen but if there's no word over their life what's the anointing for they pour an awning out pour anointing out shouting scream and hollering amen that's all good but what for but they must be a word and that word is spoken over the church and under the United word then the bright body knows how to manifest the word of the age of living in the spirit of the Lord is upon me he knew why it was on him and he knew what it was isn't that beautiful he knew why and what a lot of people probably thought of all kinds of things but he knew he said he anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor to heal the brokenhearted preached Deliverance to the captions of course this is Isaiah 61 he's reading to preach the acceptable ear of the Lord and he closed the book and gave it again to the minister set down all the eyes of them were fasted and the Son of God upon him and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears the anointing is here to Manifest this portion of the word of God he was identifying the anointing was upon him for the purpose of identifying that portion of scripture for the season they were living in that anointing amen that anointing of course that anointing is the great Pillar of Fire now I've got to skip ahead and Skip back here to get to these points but you bear with me just a moment but the anointing is the pillar of fire how many knows that can we uh can we remember here not too long from where we're setting amen the anointing of God Came Upon William Branham it was just there over in Texas when the Lord had a great picture made with him now in the pillar of fire in 1953 the Bible the prophet of God says it like this he said he led Israel he said I want you to read some scripture closely now God commissioned Moses to send him he said over in Exodus the 23rd chapter of the 21st listen closely now I'll send my angel before thee to keep me in the way and to bring thee and to the place which I have prepared to bring thee into the place that I have prepared I will send my angel before thee now the prophet of God says this he says now watch this my angel shall go before thee he said now let's see what the angel looked like in the 13th chapter of Exodus he said we read it in verses 21 and 22 for the Lord went before them by day and a pillar of cloud to lead them and By Night by the pillar of fire to give them light can we have that picture right here in in a Coliseum in Houston amen we found that the critics were trying to disprove William branham's Ministry and that God was a Healer and that God was a savior and they challenged they challenged these things and they brought a photographer along to take pictures of how they were going to overrun these men of God and make fools of them well I'll tell you what after taking all them pictures they only had one picture to turn out they only have one pitcher to turn out and it's that picture right there now some people say well brother Wayne Amen what's that picture about well first of all let me say it's an authentic picture and it's been verified scientifically to be the only Supernatural photograph ever taken the phenomena amen of the picture that is there is not the man William ran him the phenomena is what's above his head it's exactly what we're reading in scripture here that he was the same angel that led the children of Israel which was the pillar of fire the angel of the Lord or the angel of the Covenant now that Pillar of Fire that you're looking at right there that picture was not taken by your friends that picture was not taken by our ministry team that picture was not taken by Perry green that picture was not taken by Oral Roberts that was not brother branham's campaign took it that was your critics that took that picture that was your critics that took that picture and God has made your critics testify not the same angel that led the children of Israel his come back to anoint the Bride of Jesus Christ and I salute the return of the pillar of Fire in My Generation I say we ought to welcome him in the Church of the Living God [Music] you say brother Wayne the same one the same very one you have a picture of him now listen when Paul was preaching he didn't have that picture when Peter was preaching he didn't have that picture when Martin Luther was preaching he didn't have that picture and they turned the world upside down and here we have physical evidence of the awareness of the purifier among the church we ought to turn this world upside down with the anointing of God and has come in this generation we ought to tell every critic we ought to tell every unbeliever foreign amen there's a lot of reproach there's a lot of reproach with this well in the Bible in Hebrews 11 and 26 it said that Moses esteemed the reproach of Christ greater than the riches of Israel he would rather have the reproach of the pillar of fire is all the riches of Egypt I'll tell you what God would make a man like that you say Christ the reproach of Christ Jesus wasn't alive in Moses's day come on the physical body wasn't born to the middle of the Bible and Moses was prophesying of his coming Moses said was speaking here Paul was speaking of Christ being the anointing or being the pillar of Fire now that was what John bore record of at the Jordan River when that great Pillar of Fire hovered and came down and dwelt in the body of Jesus Christ that's why he was born Jesus and called the Christ he was the anointed Son of God he's not just the Son of God he's the anointed Son of God he's not just the word he's the anointed word he's not just a letter he's the Dynamics of the letter he's not just the word he's the word and the flesh together my God it's not dead he's still alive he's not there in a tomb in Jerusalem he's here tonight in authority and power and I feel the vibration of the power of God that pillar fire is the anointing it's the logos [Applause] it's the logos in the beginning what's the logos in the beginning was the low gospel and the logos was with God and the lows us was God isn't that something in the beginning was the law do you know what the prophet tells us he tells us the first thing ever coming to Creation was that light the first thing that ever happened God said let there be light hey and that great visible image of the invisible God become worldly out there is the great logos of the anointing and out of that come ever created Power and out of that come every creative anointing listen no wonder no wonder when God come back into this generation and a prophet stood there and created squirrels no wonder he could do it the same one that created the first squirrel was the same one creating squirrels today the same God Amen that would cause a resurrection in that day it's the same God that was in this day Christ was the anointing the logos that went out of God Jesus Christ the same 1964. now any Bible any Bible reading neither knows the angel was Christ and he comes today in the form the same Christ manifesting himself look at this he led them by Pillar of Fire that was the anointing the Holy Spirit Christ powerful brother Brown says to the pillar fire the angel if Jesus is the same Angel the same Angel of the Covenant was Jesus Christ for the Bible said Moses esteemed the Christ The Riches of Christ greater Christ is the logos of course the one that went out of God in the beginning the first thing that ever appeared in the heavens has appeared in our generation the first visible image that God ever took has come to our generation to tell you I am still calling in the face of laodicea in the face of every system in the face of every tradition I am still God I want you to know he's not just God above us he's not just God with us he has come to be God in us the same yesterday today and forever if he ever was God he still is God he said preacher how did he get in how did he get in this I'll tell you what a prophet said he said read the book of Acts the second chapter when the Bible said they were all gathered in one Accord 120 of them were gathered in the upper room and I'm righty Russian Wind come in the room and there were cloven tongues of Fire Cove and tongues of fire he said preacher once that's about clove and tongues of fire the prophet of God said God the great Lucas divided himself and got into the bodies of those believers now you can call the Holy Ghost a motion if you want to you can call the Holy Ghost some little some little something you can take or leave if you want to but in the book of Acts the Holy Ghost was the physical presence of the pillar of fire divided and brought into the Church of the Living God God is in his church today in the power of the pillar of fire to bring an anointing upon this Vibe and let me tell you it makes a difference a Holy Ghost Field Christian next to a denominational Christian makes a difference all right it makes a difference it's a pillar of fire it is broke up set upon each of them clothing tongues of Fire I love this one brother Brown says see we are not a divided people we've got to be in unity because we're each one holding a part of God we must come together then the pillar of fire is manifested in its wholeness in his fullness when his church sets together in Heavenly places then the fullness of the power of God is in his church each one holding spiritual gifts and spiritual offices coming together that brings the pillar of fire back again foreign s the pillar of fire back again he separated himself Be not Afraid 61 divided himself amongst the people cloven tongues of fire set upon each one of them God separated himself to his church no wonder he spoke where two or three are gathered in my name I will be in the midst of them if you have to agree on one thing ask it and I'll give to what is it when the little fire here and the little fire there each part of you are a part of God when it comes together it's the body of Christ United brother no wonder the devil hates meetings like this no wonder the devil hates when they come from Europe and they come from Ohio and they come from Arkansas and they come from Texas and they come from Louisiana no wonder he hates it because even the devil can see and in this dark dark world when the light of the pillar of fire is moving in a heart can you imagine the devil watching the little Elixir fire driving down to Minden Louisiana and I'm throwing everything they can you know I'm telling you the truth that devil done everything he could do to stop you from gathering with the other licks of fire in the house of God I think brother Ron throwed up five or six times before we left the house that Devil's saying I don't want that liquor fire down there but listen God has put us together to unless the anointing of these men of God gather together to give that devil a weapon in the house of God bring the anointing the anointing that is here with me now is the Angel of the Lord it is the pillar of Fire I'm quoting a prophet here now he said preacher what are you saying you know that was a that's a huge thing going on in the in the energy world right now Empire world there's a huge thing in laser beams it's a pretty powerful study if you want to go study it it's amazing because everybody's trying to figure out how to get energy outside of coal and natural resources so the the cheapest the cheapest way they can go is if they could get the sun on the Earth because the sun produces more energy in a minute than we can use in a hundred years you know I don't know what the figures are but it's it's huge because the sun uses it uses Fusion to power itself and it is an unlimited source of power now I want you to think about this because scientists back in the 70s decided that we need to get the sun on the Earth now they said how can we do this that was nothing they had that had enough individual power to reproduce a fusion through through uh light beams but now now if you study lasers lasers are powerful they use them in Warheads and everything else now if the lasers have become very powerful but there was a fellow who designed a product they that he could take I think it was 192 193 laser beans and he could take those laser beams any of them are powerful by themselves but he decided and got his figures that if I could get 192 of them focused on a point that is as small as the Eraser on a pencil that I could reproduce the same energy on the earth that is found in the Sun not one of them could do it by themselves but if we could get a 192 agreeing on one point it would generate the same power that was in the heaven would come on the Earth well I'll tell you what they started in the 1970s they actually built a very a very powerful system and they built a great big complex they call it the ignition facility and they want to get together to ignite they want to have this ignition of these lasers now they had to design them I was preaching about this at home the other day and one of our brothers there he said I don't know how many phds he's got a couple of them and I was talking about it and after the service he come and said well actually he was he's in 3D printing he said actually we hired the engineer the engineered that project he said I know him personally he said they engineered that he said so as they had to build a huge a huge place and they had to bring it in a certain condition and they had to get everything in a certain spot before they could fire and have ignition now they started that in the 1970s do you all realize they have just now fired that thing back about a year ago they finally got a successful ignition which means they made fusion into fission right here on the Earth vision and diffusion in other words I I don't get deep into it but I will say this to you y'all y'all know if I get them right Fusion is the thing that causes the division no opposite Fusion is the thing that brings them together because I remember this point in physics when it fizzes it breaks it apart so it's a it's a fission bomb it's it's a it's a bit of a fears you know it Fizz is our physics so but but it breaks down to to y'all what that actually means is it means the nucleus of the atom breaks apart creates an energy which is exactly what they used when they blew up Hiroshima but now today the the nuclear bombs we're using are actually Fusion bombs where they're not dividing atoms they're putting atoms together but to put two atoms together you had to have an explosion that is powerful enough to jam them together it's like you take two magnets that have opposite and they want to repel it takes a lot of power to put them together and and you see that those those nucleuses of the atoms are positive charge they don't want to go together but they have found a way to be able to reproduce a an actual sunlight Fusion on the Earth by putting all of them beings together he said preacher what point are you making I'll tell you this they can take 192 man-made light beams and get enough Unity out of him through scientific research to put them on the same point and release an ignition that'll bring a powerful as nuclear upon the Earth he said preacher what are you saying I'm saying this is the season that God has released a headship over the Church of the Living God that can take members of this bride from around the world and put them on the same point at the same time and focus them by the power of God listen if the man can do it with 192 brother what was it that day on the day of Pentecost when 120 of them gathered in the upper room and they was in one mind and one Accord and what happened on the day of Pentecost we are still talking about today I believe if we could get 120 in this room and we'd get them together on the same principle and the same point that there's an anointing that would release in this building that it'd be greater than anything you've ever saw in your life he said Lil Wayne it can get greater it'll get greater and it'll get greater and it'll get greater this pride is not going backwards brother she's going upwards she's increasing in anointing she's increasing in power the seed has come out of the shop and we are manifesting the word and the age we're living in foreign that fission bomb it's not half as powerful as the as the new Fusion it's a lot more powerful amen now this is I don't want y'all to throw me out for this but y'all y'all forgive me but I read it right in the message brother random said when he told Hattie Wright about creating them squirrels he said when she said Amen to that he said it released a super anointing in the room that was greater then when I created this world when the bride amends this message I believe but the message being preached today will generate a greater anointing and it did not in the days when brother Brandon broke these messages open because now there are believers who have opened up their soul and said God pour the anointing here and allow the power of the Holy Ghost I believe it's generated and anointing in the Church of a living God that brings strength and power and anointing upon Him 120 gathered I believe it's in the unity of the spirit of God it's the pillar of fire now what's he doing here he's leading the church he's leading them to promises he's leading them into anointing now I know people people they come into meetings that we preaching and they say well my other gets awful emotional and there gets off will y'all excuse me and y'all y'all forgive me I'm sorry this message has power but if you won't water this down and you'll take the gloves off and preach what the prophet said they will generate a power that'll change our Market bodies there's an anointing in this message we're gonna have to borrow the Pentecostals anointing we don't have to borrow the madness's anointing the anointing on this pride is the same Jesus Christ hello I know what I'm saying and then they say well you got them young people hollering and shouting and dancing well let me ask you something is there an age limit on this anointing who put the age limit on it who said only all people can get under the anointing of God but I believe we ought to release the anointing I believe we ought to let it go I believe it ought to get in our young people and fill them well some guy running around here the other day saying well they're preaching too deep for the young people they're too deep for the young people their TV I think well have mercy what young people are you talking about man [Music] the young people I'm talking to could stir the head of a theologian [Applause] young people aren't preaching to a Bible taught message Fair Holy Ghost Field children of God come on they do more than play football on the weekend they do more they come to the house of God and have meetings and enjoy them so preacher what are you saying I'm saying this I'm saying young people today understand the depths of pornography they understand the depths of Internet they understand the debts of society how much greater can the child of God understand the depth of God and allow the power of God to come in the church I say we ought to take the limits off we're going to take the bonds off we ought to release Jesus in his own church so by the way we might lose control well praise be to God I pray we lose control long enough somebody can get saved well I think you're out of order with that the prophet of God said you are to worship God do you forget who you are when's the last time you did it you are to get so drunk in the spirit of God that they would say to you are these all drunk and somebody would have to say no sir these are full of the Holy Ghost and the power of God I believe we ought to release it I believe we ought to come on church amen we are promised an anointing in this age my Bible says in the Book of Joel then I will pour out my spirit saying for the Lord and in the same season I will pour out more former and lateral raise [Applause] oh then there's the problem in it's the rain that's the problem because everybody says well brother Wayne don't you know people can shout and dance and still be lost and I I I don't want to be arrogant but once in a while I want to go duh do you don't think that I ain't read them for 132 quotes where the Prophet preaches on false anointed ones you don't think that I hate red every time brother Branham said you can shout and dance and have an experience and not be saved you don't think I don't read that I could care less amen what everybody else is doing or not doing I know God promised rain in this generation so what are we going to do God don't send the rain there's Hypocrites in the church God don't send the rain some people don't live right in the church don't you dare send no rain in the church as somebody that ain't saved might get a blessing we'll let them get a blessing it might be the only thing they ever get why would you refuse them a blessing from God [Music] you said preacher what are you talking about I tell you this I believe the rain is here for a purpose I believe the rain is the anointing that God sends upon the church from the last day let me make my case here there are people sitting in this room that you are a seed of God from the foundation of the world I've got a prophet here saying that when you come into this life that was a seed down on the inside of you it didn't get put here when you come to the altar it didn't get here when you raised your hand it didn't get healed when you said I believe the message but you were put here in this Earth with a seed on the inside of you that was a part of the Eternal God from the foundation of the world because eternal life doesn't have a beginning and it doesn't have an end Eternal means Eternal that means you wasn't a son on any day you didn't start being a son yesterday the week before or 30 years ago if you ever are a son you always work you always were a son and down in your soul was a predestinated scene amen there's only one thing that will get through that seed it's the word that produces the Holy Ghost say preacher what are you saying I'm saying there's people sitting in here amen that was a seed to begin with and you're here by the foreknowledge of God there was a young man sitting in our meeting the other day at home he was sitting there next to his dad and just out of the blue I called his name I said are you his seed he said yeah I said are you sure he said yeah I said are you double sure he said yeah I'm sure I said you're sure you was hissy before you were born he said absolutely I said well don't you know that if God can show you that in the natural he can show you that in the spiritual well I didn't know this but two weeks later standing in a line at lunch he said brother Wayne the other day when you called my name and said those things I said yeah he said do you know I talked to my wife on Saturday night and I said honey since I've been 12 years old I've wondered if I was really a seed of God it's the message really for me and he said brother he said only me and my wife knew about that conversation he said and I told her I said if God would just beat me over the head I would know it's true and brother the next morning the first time he's ever been in our church that I've ever called his name ever and I called his name you said preacher what is that the word is still a discerner of the thought and the attention of the heart the anointing makes a difference say preacher why you say that I say that because I say this amen I'm sorry that this message produces anointing I'm sorry that it produces uncomfortable position for formal devils and traditional ideas but this message was sent to be arraigned upon the sin of the Living God I cannot help there is weed in the field I cannot help those Hypocrites in the church but I say their seed here also so let it rain let it rain let the Holy Ghost reign in the church with power and with anointing I feel like another I say Let It Rain I see the Holy Ghost reign of God are the Reign to never see this broke open until the power of God drops into the church but we don't believe in blessing our church [Applause] you know what you know I just have to be honest with you right here do you know people say to me all the time how can you say they were before they were well brother random made it simple for a hillbilly now somebody else might need it theologically this hillbilly understood a prophet good he said one day there was a duck he said who was born down in a chicken pen I know you know about the eagle but that's pretty good he's setting it up was born down in the chicken pen I thought that was pretty good because you know what some people wonder amen I was mixed up in this and I was mixed up in that by the way could I really ever get a birth did I ever come to life was there any quickening power you know what a prophet said he said it's the atmosphere that hatches there come on Church the atmosphere Hatches the Egg and that little fellow was stuck in a chicken pen being a duck you know the problem with chicken pins they're dry [Applause] you know what he was born for water he was not born for dry places he was born for water and let me tell you what a prophet said he said when that little fella walked around the barn one day and he saw a pond for the first time he said there was something happened to him and he got a smell of water and he runs straight for the pond nobody had to teach him nobody had to train him there was something in him that needed that one and let me tell you this if you're going to keep people trapped in the chicken yard you better keep them away from the water because the first time they ever smelled the water something on the inside begins to wake up and something makes them ready to run brother when that little duck begins to awaken listen it wasn't he wasn't by himself he was a duck to begin with his Queen daddy was a duck his great granddaddy was a duck he was a duck from long years ago all he needed was a little water he knew how to swim I say pour out the water and the Holy Ghost and let the church Slim no way I don't know how it is whether Ram said he were a pair of overhauls he said he had a he said he had a nail for a button he said we had a water hole down there we'd take off a running he said the first guy in would tell him how the water was he said I'd take off running I beat them all he said he said all I had to do was pull one nail and shake a little and he pulled at me on shake a little he said he'd jump off in that water and he said he'd turn around and wave the water's good come on in boys let me tell you the prophet was the first one in this water don't tell me I don't have a right in this Pond the prophet got in first and then turned around and said come on boys the water's good it'll wake you up it'll give you what you need to see hey I was a duck to begin with don't blame me for swimming I got it's in my DNA and so are you a child of God to begin with it was in your DNA that's why you enjoy the meeting with the anointing comes because you come from God you can go back to God come from that power no wonder when that fire begins to move something on the inside of you wakes up he said brother Wayne what are you saying I'm saying Jesus said in John 14 he said he said it very clearly he said because I live ye live also [Applause] because I live you live what does that mean what a resurrection that was what a resurrection this is he lived now you live you live to manifest every word that was spoken of this generation what's going on here tonight Elohim is materializing himself [Applause] this is the whole plan of God he will speak a word anoint a word and manifest a word now you have a part in that word your part of the word is to manifest what was spoken in this generation and if there's a seed for the bride in this age when the anointing comes on the seed you will never stop that member of the Bride from manifesting what God has awakened in them [Applause] look if you want to keep them in something theological you better keep them away from the anointing because the minute the anointing comes something's going to wake up in them what is it it's Elohim you know that's actually what's in you right now is Elohim it is the Great Pillar of Fire the seed that was in you was always there and when this rain falls it falls on the just and the unjustment don't forget the just all right look change your focus quit worrying about the weed and preach to the seed you will never change the weed they were always weed they will always be weaned God help us to preach the life to a seed that will change their body so we can have a harvest and get out of this place what is it it's a Harvest Time it's the Harvest Time people people don't hardly care for this kind of worship but I know they don't I know they don't people often say well what right do you have worship like this anyhow y'all want to know about what my real right is I'm a son of God and as being a Son of God I am called Abraham's seed and as Abraham seed I am a royal priesthood and as a priest I have to make an offering to my God and that offering is my spiritual sacrifice of praise people so well you people put on too much for me do you know the very word sacrifice means you do it when you don't feel like it the very word sacrifice means I didn't feel like it but I did it anyhow you sacrifice just like brother runs sacrificed to be here last night to be here to he didn't feel like it but he did it anyhow because he's a priest and he sacrificed to show worship to God and listen if that man can do that in that shape you don't have one excuse tonight and why you're not praising God he said by the way you beating us up no sir I'm giving you rights if you want to praise God you've got to right to worship him to praise him to love him and serve him listen to me you said well brother Wayne I'm not worthy to serve him I wasn't talking about you I was talking about him and let me ask you what has he ever done that wasn't worthy of your praise I don't care if you're the lowest rottenness outfit sitting in this building tonight he is still Jesus Christ he is still worthy of all of our praise you know I'm gonna still buddy buddy of my he's sitting behind me I'm gonna steal something from him amen Ron Spencer said this one time he said the only reason you got a right to not praise God is if you're dead I thought that was pretty good because the Bible said let everything that hath the breath praise ye the Lord let me ask you should we you should praise the Lord God in his sanctuary those acting unseemly in the church David said do it in the sanctuary praise God in the sanctuary in the firmament of his power praise him in his mighty acts Praise Him according to excellent greatness praise him with the sound of the trumpet Praise Him in the softer in the heart praise him with the timbrel and the dance oh maybe I didn't read that right let me read that again praise him with the timbrel and the dance I want to know I want to know somebody tell me who took dancing out of church what devil told you it was wrong to dance in church David said praise our God in the dance it's I'm reading it to you these young people shouldn't have to go to the bar to learn how to dance they shouldn't have to go to some rock and roll party to enjoy the word of God they shouldn't have to get drunk down at the alcohol and party and stand in some I see young people ain't in their pictures and they're waving they're some rock and roll God and they're standing out there with their little lights and they're waving listen we didn't come in here tonight to hold a cigarette lighter up to some rock and roll God but we brought our lives we brought our link of fire and we've come in the house of God and we're gonna wave it and we're gonna say in this Darkly odyssia somebody still Praises God as people still there and dance and scream and praise you're gonna think I'm crazy but it don't really matter to me I was a duck to begin with and I found the waters go ahead tell me who took dancing out of church what right you got to take it out David set it on to be here William Brandon said it's a sign of victory if you got enough Victory you got a right to dance thank you you're gonna rock to dance whether we got a right to dance Hallelujah we still got a ride to praise God notify hell tonight as 192 of us and agree we've got a right to praise God we're going to rock to praise him in the timber in the trumpet in the bench I won't take no for an answer I'm gonna get worship to God if I had ten thousand tongues I would praise him if I had ten thousand voices I would give them to him well you don't understand brother Wayne we can't have these young people shout like this you know in the Bible when Jesus rode into Jerusalem what the Pharisees had problems with was the noise they didn't like the young people shouting in the temple you can read it Matthew the 21st chapter and Jesus said unto them have you not read but out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou have perfected praise you ain't even had praise until you got a young person praising you ain't even seen real praise until you see a young person that is broke out from the passions and the lust of this evil age and broke out into a realm of victory over the devil and victory over the problems in the life we're not asking for permission from the devil we have been given a right by the scripture to worship the god of Abraham we didn't ask the devil what it taught we didn't ask his permission we didn't even invite him to this meeting matter of fact you are free to leave Satan you're free to take your unbelieving spirit with you and get out of this place in the name of Jesus Christ by what Authority you go ahead and tell me about what Authority does the devil take dancing out of the church and then turn around and blame it on us like we do something wrong when we do what the scriptures told us to do I'm Taylor I'd be honestly I'm a little sick of the devil pushing this time to push back it's time for this bride Church to say we know our rights I've got a right to worship I've got a rock to praise I've got a right to quote what the prophet said by what Authority by what Authority do you do these things I tell you what we do and we do them by scripture you know the scripture tells us every Parable in the Bible is in effect right now man shall not live by word alone but every by bread alone but every word that precedes when has there ever been an age where there's been more words than today [Applause] come on the prophet of God said every Parable in the scripture was in effect right now said preacher what are you saying that I'm saying and some days you're going to have to be a shame guard [Applause] but you can't just be shame God because shamgar didn't make it all the way did he just a little piece in the scripture it was just a little part of your character I got quotes laying right here where prophet of God said you've got a right to every character that was in the scripture as a Christian you see what I'm saying some points you're going to be a David and you're going to throw your your little rock at that devil and you're going to cut his head off in other places you're going to be a marry him with a tambourine and you're going to dance on the sea other places you're going to be a Moses and you're going to prophesy and sing and praise God other places you're going to be a Hannah and you're going to cry before God other places you're going to be a Mary and you're going to say be it unto me according to Thy word other places foreign Parable doesn't explain you what scripture doesn't explain you you are the multifaceted presence of almighty God in the form of the Bride Elohim has come back in the form of a bride and here you stand with material on you now I got enough scripture to cover you up on that point Elohim it's back in the bride form bringing the fullness of that word you said preacher what are you saying I'm saying that you're the king you're the king with an Oxnard you know the prophet of God said that the Holy Ghost will get the church out of any chaos it's in to brother Wayne I'll tell you the perfect word by the Holy Ghost it won't it won't won't fix all of our trouble liar so preacher what are you saying the prophet of God said the church was given into her hand the arrow of God's deliverance and the Holy Spirit will deliver the church out of any kind of chaos it can get into anything you can get into this anointing gets you out [Applause] any problem come on Church Israel was in Egypt and God got him out [Applause] I'm preaching to you Peter was back three Realms in the prison in a dark place and the pillar of fire went and found that man come on somebody said Peter here tonight somebody that's back in that dark place back there so brother when you saying I ain't a Christian no Peter was full of the Holy Ghost but the devil had he locked up in the darkness back there but there was a prayer meeting going on for him it's a pillar of fire went after the man the anointing of God come down and Peter had already got so comfortable in the prison house he was sleeping down there yeah he thought well I'll never get out of this place but the anointing wouldn't quit brother the anointment by the way how do I know I'm a Child of God he ain't gonna quit [Applause] this ain't going to quit he won't let you get down there and get comfortable and just stay stay where you are amen he won't back off that that anointing came right he never Peter was and smote him in the sidewalked that man up and told him to get up are you hearing me if you're back there in that prison house as a child of God and that Devil's got you in a dark place the anointing is in the building and I'm telling you get out from where you are don't lay there another night look at that pillar fire went in and smoldy and when he stood up the chains fell off of him the anointing makes a difference he didn't have to beat them chains off he just got up to move and when he started moving he was a free man I'll tell you if you start moving right now you're already a free man God has already did something in this building chains are already broken what he did the Bible says the angel stopped him on the way out and made him get dressed isn't that something made him gird his loins and put his shoes on I wonder where that come from in the Bible when the angel of the Lord was leading Israel out of Egypt you know what he did he made them put their shoes on and he made them gird themselves because they was leaving there Hallelujah he wouldn't allow his children to go shoeless no sir he made him get dressed when they were leaving so as when they got out the Bible said he'd come to himself he got so carried away he didn't even know what had happened to him until he got on the outside you see what God will do he'll come to the darkest places of your life because I'm going to say something to you some of you get into places in your life amen that you shouldn't be there you should not be in that place he said preacher how does that happen do you remember you remember when brother bam talks about freeing those people out of that house of Hell how many remembers that I'll say hell remember the vision you know what happened right there that woman told Brother random said brother Brandon them are good people but they've misunderstood you said preacher what are you saying it was a misunderstanding that put them in that place and sometimes in the church things come up and people have a misunderstanding instead of straightening it out they let the devil put them in bars and it becomes a prison house to them but I feel an anointing in this building tonight see House of hell give way in the name of Jesus Christ what happened an anointing came I wish I had an hour on that look what it done it opened it some of you been under misunderstandings and doctrines some of you was in misunderstandings and it had you bound to where you couldn't even serve God the way you wanted to you're a good person but you were in a misunderstanding and it bound you but this message come to set you Liberty fear night in his anointing of freedom so brother Wayne what are you saying I'm saying there's three rounds there's a humanistic ground there's a divine revelation realm and there's a vision Realm and you can't just live in humanistic or Revelation you're going to have to have a vision you're going to have to get a vision of where you're going and what you're doing and how it's going to come do you know you're a part of this vision from the beginning do you know when God spoke certain things in the Bible he was literally talking about you come on church I I'm not a heretic you are literally in the Bible you are the bride body of Jesus Christ and Justice predestinated in his body is so is this body predestinated now come on y'all know y'all know as well as I do that that only fulfills in the end time how many knows this how many knows the Bible says in Ephesians 2 and 7 that you have been raised up to set in Heavenly places with Christ Jesus let me realize this that's not every age that is an end time scripture Jim I said well brother Wayne that's been in the Bible all them years it don't matter how long it was in the Bible it was put in the Bible in the days of Paul but it wasn't to be lived until the days of the Bride because there had to come something to lift up this bride into a position of authority come on friends that letters wasn't going to do it but the same Pillar of Fire that led the children of Israel out of Egypt into Israel into the promised land was the same Pillar of Fire that came to your home and began to lift you in the word to a position of authority ah I know people say to me all the time so bro ain't short to me in the Bible I think it's powerful I'm I'm going to borrow something from your pastor here I think it's powerful read Revelations the 10th chapter read Revelations 10. you got that you got that picture of Michael of that great Cloud read Revelations 10 read the first couple verses of scripture and look what look what it says in Revelations 10 it said a mighty Angel come down out of heaven clothed with a cloud clothed with a cloud y'all know you're looking at the picture of Revelations the 10th chapter you were clothed with a cloud now this is a beautiful thing to me because this represents the headship of the church now somebody said well brother Wayne what are you talking about brother Graham said that's our headship he said now what revealed these seals was not the intelligence of a man it was the quickening power of God right and this Cloud was the Heavenly announcement of what was happening on the earth headship had come to the church and a body is positioned under a head come on Brad hey man so what are you talking about preacher well if you took your driver's license out right now and I said who are you you show me a picture of your face don't you come on now this is not a picture amen of the Cross this is not a picture of doves this is not a picture of eagles this is a picture of the face of Jesus Christ with the wig of seven angels teaching the supreme authority of Jesus Christ now the beautiful thing here is amen that that is only a picture of the head where is the body that's the end but you're the body come on church not just the body the anointed body anointed by what the same Pillar of Fire that was in the beginning you say preacher where is that Pillar of Fire I'm looking for it I'm looking at it I'm not looking for the pillar of fire I'm looking at the pillar of Fire now I got enough scripture to cover you up I know exactly where I'm at you are the amorphic form of Jesus Christ in this age the bride body which the son of man is now manifesting himself not in one man but a many-membered body the son of man is increasing in the body of Jesus Christ the pillar of fire is now where does the vision say the pillar of fire be look at Moses tent Vision what does the tent Vision say the pillar of fire be it'll be in that little room that little room is the soul where is the pillar of fire today brother Wayne it's in the adopted sons of God the pillar of fire is now dwelling in the Church of the Living God in his body who are you tell me who I am [Applause] I like this I love this little part right here look what he said and he had his hand a little book excuse me let's go back to that first verse and a rainbow was upon his head and his face were as the sun and his feet and his feet and his feet come on what is the feet of a man it's a part of the body and his feet as pillars of Fire come on church where is his feet where is the pillars of fire that's connected to Revelations 10 it's setting in this room it's the Heavenly Pride groom it's the Earthly Pride she is the body of Jesus Christ on the earth look at this I tell you this you this so by the way someday we're going to get in the Millennium and there's a great Authority that's a great anointing going to come on the church amen I agree we're going to do it in the anointing but you're missing something the Bible said beloved now we are the sons of God not what we shall be but what we are right now you are the anointed body and the devil's trying his best to hide this from you he's trying to put it in another age he's trying to say well someday when brother Branham comes back with a tent the vision's going to happen and we're going to have a great Revival and everything's going to be good and that's going to take place it's a lie the devil's trying to throw you off for the position that God has given you in this age because you are the feet that is supposed to tread upon the head of The Serpent and the age we're living in I tell you what this pillars of fire has been anointed to place their feet upon the hand of the devil in the age we're living in you are serpent stomping Holy Ghost Field Church foreign what are you saying I'm saying right now right now you're anointed your anointed Kings of God right now can I can I finish by saying this to you right now your sons right now you're Kings you say brother Wayne I don't feel like I have any Dominion at all but you do you say what is your decision your Dominion's over the flesh [Applause] you're the minionist you are a Believer how many Believers of God your Dominion is over the flesh he overcame so you overcame the flesh I I'm sorry I I don't want to make fun of people but I I have to be honest with you people tell me some stupid things sometimes and they said well by the way and I'm afraid you're going to get in the flesh up there shouting and hollering well hello I am a flesh man and as long as I'm in this body whatever I do will be in the flesh the same flesh that Wars the same flesh that don't want to get up and come to church the same flesh that don't want to be nice the same flesh that wants to war every day of Our Lives but there is something on the inside that is making this thing come subject to the word of God why is it brother it's the anointing so you know what I'll do I'll dance in the flesh I shot in the flesh I praise God in the flesh I'm not just gonna do it in a theophany brother I'm not just going to do it anymore nobody but in this Mortal body I will bring it subject to the word of God and I say you are going to worship the god of Abraham in million over the flesh over sin over the world and I really like this one over the devil it's written in the word you would have over the devil he said preacher over the devil do you know brother random said that Jesus was raised up to the right hand of God he said in this body was set over Satan in authority and Power even if you're the skin on the bottom of the feet you are still over the devil you said preacher what does that mean then that means that that pornography happened tonight you've got a right to put your foot on that thing and say you'll never you might have took this one you might have took that one but because of the anointing you cannot bring an arrow nor can you enter the path I believe you got a ride to put your foot on it I believe it I believe you young people got a rock that put your foot on fashion I believe you got it right you sit here with an alcohol habit tonight you got a right to put your foot on it so I can't quit these cigarettes brother Wayne listen you can't quit it amen as a man but if you'll left this anointing in your life as a power from the pillar of fire it'll make you the son you ought to be and it'll give you authority over every demon [Applause] let me tell you we're the subject we're just subject to everything in this age that's a lie we are not subject to this devil we may have to live here but we don't live under the Dominion of sin we live under the Dominion of Christ where he shows himself alive let me ask y'all something what good is it for us to preach the god of Elijah if he ain't still alive what good is it us to stand up here and talk about what a God was and how good he done and what great things he done unless we're willing to challenge that devil in our generation and say the same God that delivered them in the days of Moses is that God here tonight the God that was in the days of David it's the god that's here tonight I tell you the God that was in the Days of Elijah is still the god of Elijah I wish guys a better preacher to uplift him like this but I'll tell you this I have personally seen the god of Elijah I have personally witnessed it I have seen that God come down and materialize right in my own family not only do you save me I don't even fill me with the Holy Ghost not only did I see the mercies of God but just a couple years ago my son and daughter-in-law were praying for a baby praying for a baby praying for a baby God expecting a baby and lost a baby expected another baby lost the baby I think they went to it two or three times it was a nightmare on those kids people started saying well she has some kind of disease from her family line she'll never be able to do it and and she that poor little thing we lived there I watched her from month to month amen just every little bit I watched this I watched this go on I was praying for him asking God for him and you know you know you might not realize how special a special meeting is but a special meeting could be a change in your life yeah we invited brother Erickson invited brother Spencer to come up and hold a special meeting for us and we were having a little prayer line there and I'm standing there by brother Ron and in my heart I'm saying God if you're going to give them babies give us a baby to Anna and Zach let them come up in this prayer line today and no one I said that Zach popped up and got Anna by the hand and brother Jim Bowie come down and stood right there and we started praying for him well we didn't pray for him but just a few minutes and brother Ron kind of stepped back with a funny look on his face and he said Anna you'll have that child in the name of the Lord well I just started thanking God I just started thinking a lot a few days later we were out there in September we were working on brother Wendell's at parking lot on the grader and I was listening to a tape and I was sitting there thinking about that whole thing it was the following September I'm sitting there thinking about that whole thing and it could have been a May instead of October made but we were we were sitting there thinking about that and the spirit of the Lord came in there and confirmed he said you'll have that child I thought my goodness this is powerful the following February we went to Brother Ron's church and while I was preaching I just announced to the whole church and said hey yo I'm a grandpa and they was all looking at me kind of funny I said no I don't have any pregnancy tests but I got some faith I got some faith and brother Ron Howard's off the back pew it's on video he brought around hollers back and he said that's the saith the Lord Brother Wayne and I stepped back said what'd you say and he said let's saith the Lord I said well we'll send you a pregnancy test when it comes and they did and they did and it wasn't long after that brother Ron told me so brother Rayne the reason I was so sure is God showed me a vision standing there at the platform that day I said well thank God for that it's not human real I'm not Revelation realm it's another realm altogether do you know just uh February two years now in February be two years we had little Evelyn you got a picture brother Michael we had little Evelyn coming to the into the Earth God gave us because our God is still the god of Elijah that's Evelyn Marie brother Ron's dedicating Evelyn we got an updated pitcher and maybe one more high and she killed so brother Wayne what's wrong with you listen I want that devil to know I know the God that I serve gave us that baby every time I pick her up I tell the devil God gave this one to me now now little Evelyn come along and the Holy Spirit began to move and you know what's amazing is Nathan's standing right back there Nathan and Cheyenne was had a baby Rowan who's with him now and they wanted to have another and they were having trouble after trouble after trouble and they went to the doctor and the doctor said it's a very I don't know what the percentages was but it was a high percentage that they would never be able to have another child they were surprised they had the first one and he and he said in his heart he felt God he Brother Ray was preaching one day he was sitting there and something came to him that he was going to have a child he was going to have another one and he said he said I had that little bit of Faith God's going to give it to me but then we went down in in the uh the I think it was somewhere around March or may something like that went down to brother Nathan Bryants in Jeffersonville and we preached a meeting down there and brother Nathan went with us on the Saturday night of the meeting we had a prayer line and Nathan come through the prayer line but when he came through God moved in a very Supernatural way we went down afterwards and sometimes preachers fall apart after meetings you know we went down into the basement and when we were sitting down there he come and laid over coming late over the desk and started wailing out in the spirit of God and Rose up and said brother Wayne God has confirmed to me tonight in this prayer line I'll have another child and tonight we have a little Rosemary back there with Cheyenne if you want to see her the pictures on there for the screen audience but they're sitting there tonight holding the supernatural in their hands because my God is still the god of Elijah he cares that lying devil he still does I was last year uh two years August now has been a year Brother David Mayer and I were preaching a meeting up in Mount Baker for Cloverdale there brother bisco and brother Tom and in brother Ryan Hayes as their musician he was a song leader he was setting over there playing music and on the Sunday morning I was preaching on visions and I started telling that congregation the testimony about Evelyn and when I started telling that I looked over at him and I had noticed through the weekend he was under something heavy I didn't know what it was didn't have a clue what he was going through he told the testimony a year later he said what has happened was they had had about three or four miscarriages and they were just they were just racked with this and they didn't know what to do didn't know how to handle it he said we're just about to give up on it well while I was telling this testimony on the Sunday morning the last service the spirit of God began to drop in the building he said brother Wayne God spoke to me and said you will have a son and call his name Samuel one year later here's that baby said preacher what are you saying I'm saying the anointing made a difference because 192 light beams come together there was a power dropped in that room she was Barren when she came in but she was fruitful when she left there are people sitting in this room you may be going through some of the greatest Trials of your life but you're in a place for change God still changes Hearts it still changes lives he still delivers souls he still brings the captive and sets him free 20 years ago Bryce Collins and his wife was wanting a child she couldn't have one I was preaching a meeting and I began to just preach like this and I sing they're sitting there as younger lady her husband wasn't a pastor then and I looked at her and I said sister God can fix whatever's wrong with that body and he can give you that baby and I was doing that I had no clue what she was wanting or Desiring but when I said that amen about a year later she came to Arkansas and handed me a baby and she said here is the baby you said I could have because our God is still the god of Elijah and I don't care what line devil says that he's not that kind of God he's scared of God that Reigns and rules he is still a supernatural Almighty powerful God I do not look for a decrease in anointing I do not look for a backing up in this message but I look for those that have desired it to see a greater anointing and a greater power and a greater Revival [Applause] I believe change is here [Applause] because of the anointing I can say to you you won't leave here like you came [Applause] you can begin to agree together right here in this building you may have walked in this room with a habit you leave here without it tonight because the anointing just because other people have fell under that and they can't get up don't mean you have to I'm preaching to you just cause your daddy took that kind of attitude and went that direction don't mean you have to you do not have to go that way I don't care how you were born I don't care who your parents were there was a seed in you to be a child to begin with and the DNA of Elohim is in this bride and under this anointing there's something that will change you put it in a prison house God will get them out put them in Egypt God will get them out put them in a guns and God will get them out put them in sickness gotta get them out he's the god of Abraham and there's none like him that can ain't nobody ain't nothing like this God that we're serving here tonight I stand before you as a witness that God is still alive he can take a drunk and make a preacher out of him he can take the immoral and make a moral he can completely change you [Applause] the musicians come the anointing makes a difference because of the anointing so brother Wayne how do you think things because of the anointing how do you think things could because of the anointing but Isaiah you don't understand Israel just got attacked and everybody was carried away and we're gonna because of the anointing so you know what that tells me let the anointing loose a few years ago I don't want you to think I'm a nut just a few years ago there in True Word Tabernacle up in Ohio I was preaching on a Thursday night and I looked over and there was a man come walking out of the wall walked right down through the room he never stepped over a pinch he never he never stepped over a person he just walked right through the crowd said preacher what are you say and I'm saying the angel the Lord still walks in rooms so I don't know about all that Supernatural stuff I was preaching one day and the congregation was a little quiet my mind I was sitting there saying I might have I got the right scripture have I got the right scripture did I take the right direction and no more than I said that a light flashed over the pulpit zigzag across my Bible and went like that I said Thank You Lord and I kept standing there with the word these things are real [Applause] cause of the anointing that's why we stand here
