[42:39] West North and the South with without an
[42:43] expectation amen and and it's
[42:46] expectation uh that brings results cuz

[42:52] I hear brother bandam say this as I
[42:55] share this with you tonight of course we
[42:57] know we're living in the evil day and
[42:59] people are in the spirit of it and he
[43:01] said that's the way today brother that
[43:03] sitting us saying today of all this
[43:06] conglomeration of Blackness and darkness
[43:08] and sin and things that's going on in
[43:11] this world they're setting a stage for
[43:13] the greatest drama that was ever acted
[43:17] out in all ages the coming of Jesus
[43:20] Christ do you realize you are a part of
[43:23] this great drama tonight do you realize
[43:26] you are on the stage amen that God has
[43:30] called you and ordained you for this
[43:32] hour for this time and for this day and
[43:35] now it is your time to step into the
[43:38] prophecy of what has been prophesied of
[43:41] you in this last day because all of the
[43:45] scripture has been pointing to this the
[43:48] culmination of all things you know we
[43:51] had the the initiating of redemption
[43:54] 2,000 years ago at Calvary
[43:56] the foreshadows of it before that with
[43:58] the offering of lambs and and and the
[44:01] blood of bulls and goats but now we are
[44:04] here in the finishing of redemption we
[44:07] realize the lamb has stepped forth and
[44:10] broke the seals and and sent by
[44:12] Revelation the mysteries of God to us
[44:15] here in this last day and which makes us
[44:18] the people of the book we are here in
[44:21] the land of the book where every promise
[44:24] of God belongs to us so if you lost your
[44:28] healing there is healing for you if you
[44:32] lost your peace there is peace for you
[44:35] amen if you if you need the Holy Ghost
[44:37] there's a Holy Ghost in This Land if you
[44:40] need the power of God in your life the
[44:42] the power of God is in this land
[44:44] everything you have need of has been
[44:47] provided for you in this promised land
[44:52] and the whole land is open for you to go
[44:54] and possess your portion amen your
[44:58] portion you have a part in this promised
[45:00] land and brother Brandon said we cannot
[45:03] have the last day until the people get
[45:05] in the spirit of the last day and he
[45:08] said we cannot have a healing service
[45:10] here until people get in the spirit of a
[45:14] healing service we cannot have a filling
[45:17] of the Holy Ghost until the people get
[45:19] in that kind of atmosphere and the
[45:22] people in the atmosphere in that day to
[45:24] bring judgment upon the Earth and
[45:26] they're in the same atmosphere today
[45:27] eating drinking marrying giving in
[45:29] marriage and this kind of thing like
[45:31] that and the glory of God is being
[45:35] preached and demonstrated in the power
[45:38] of the Holy Ghost setting forth an
[45:41] example of the resurrection of Jesus
[45:43] Christ that's going to take the earth
[45:45] into Glory just as certain as I'm
[45:48] standing here that's right and men are
[45:50] ignoring it paying no attention to it
[45:52] walking away from it because they are in
[45:55] the the spirit of the last day but I
[45:58] tell you that's not us tonight amen we
[46:01] we are of course in the spirit of the
[46:03] last day but not that evil spirit we're
[46:06] under the anointing of the hour amen
[46:10] anointed by a mighty angel that has come
[46:13] down and and revealed the mysteries of
[46:15] God and open up the whole word of God
[46:18] for you to enjoy and participate in but
[46:22] I'll tell you what we're right here on
[46:23] the cusp of the coming of the Lord Jesus
[46:26] Jesus and and and for that coming for
[46:29] that coming it's going to take a
[46:30] refilling of the Holy Ghost but the
[46:33] Dynamics of this church will be a
[46:35] refilling of the Holy Ghost so I'll tell
[46:38] you if you didn't come for anything else
[46:40] you ought to come for that one thing

[46:47] I'm overflowing with the spirit of God I

[55:54] 11-13 St John 1 verse
[56:01] 11-13 very familiar
[56:04] scripture I trust that it will be a
[56:06] blessing to you
[56:08] tonight he came onto his own and his own
[56:11] received him
[56:12] not but as many let's say many many as
[56:16] many as received him to them gave he
[56:19] gave he power to become the sons of God
[56:24] even to them that believe on his name
[56:26] which were
[56:27] born not of blood nor of the will of the
[56:30] flesh nor of the will of man but of God
[56:34] Amen God bless you you may have your
[56:36] seats
[56:37] tonight tonight I'd like to start with a
[56:40] just a little thought tonight called
[56:42] bride
[56:43] Authority bride Authority I believe
[56:46] we're living in in a hour that is one of
[56:48] the greatest times that a person could
[56:50] be living that's right it's a time where
[56:52] the Bride of Jesus Christ is awaken aing
[56:55] to the reality of the word for her hour
[56:58] and Awakening to who she is as a as a
[57:00] person we're no longer in the former
[57:03] ages of justification sanctification and
[57:06] the restoration of the gifts but we're
[57:08] at the climax of all climaxes at a time
[57:11] when the bride has come into a place of
[57:13] maturity and the bride has to come into
[57:16] a place of maturity because we are the
[57:18] ones that would be we would say that by
[57:20] thoughts of grace we'll be changed in
[57:22] the moment in the twinkling of an eye
[57:24] amen so every time we come into the
[57:26] house of the Lord or we read our Bibles
[57:28] or we pray we have to have a re we have
[57:30] to realize within ourselves who we are
[57:32] as a people that we're not a downtrodden
[57:35] people we're not a people that the enemy
[57:37] can can push us around but it's our time
[57:40] to push back at the enemy it's not a
[57:42] time where where as the song was sung
[57:45] before that I'm going to take back
[57:47] everything the enemy stole from me amen
[57:50] we're in that timeline where we can do
[57:52] that yes sir amen it's not the time
[57:54] where Satan will will will will come
[57:56] against us but it's a time where we push
[57:58] back at him and we say Satan you stop
[58:01] right here we're not going any further
[58:03] with this because we have that Authority
[58:05] in the word of God Amen I I believe with
[58:08] all my heart that the that the prophets
[58:11] of old have looked for this hour but we
[58:13] are privileged say I'm privileged let's
[58:16] say it with passion tonight I'm
[58:17] privileged I'm privileged to live in
[58:19] this hour in this timeline in this day
[58:22] we would say that God has saved the the
[58:25] best for the last amen this isn't a weak
[58:28] bride this is a strong bride it don't
[58:30] matter what the devil brings toward us
[58:32] we've got power and authority over the
[58:35] powers of Hell amen it shouldn't be the
[58:38] enemy tormenting us but it's you that
[58:40] wake up every morning and you torment
[58:42] the devil because you know your position
[58:44] in the word of God I say it's time to
[58:47] learn who we are and recognize who we
[58:49] are that we are the Bride of Jesus
[58:52] Christ amen not just any bride but we're
[58:56] his
[58:57] bride amen I'm so thankful to be part of
[59:01] that amen we're living in the closing
[59:03] hours of the Gentile dispensation it's
[59:05] not a time to play Church no sir I don't
[59:08] know where you are in your walk with the
[59:09] Lord but if you're on the fence it's
[59:11] time to get off the fence it's time to
[59:13] make a clear-cut decision Amen to serve
[59:16] a living God Amen a lot of times I've
[59:18] heard back home even some people say
[59:20] well you know what I seemingly start and
[59:22] I can't can't get going I say get up
[59:24] again amen if you fall down get up again
[59:28] if you fall down again get up again amen
[59:30] don't stay down but get up again amen
[59:33] keep persevering keep pressing forward
[59:36] amen have a determination in your heart
[59:38] amen have passion in your life that you
[59:41] are the Bride of Jesus Christ amen I
[59:44] believe we should have passion in this
[59:45] hour I see people go to ball games I see
[59:48] people people go to a lot of places they
[59:50] got a passion for it but I say we should
[59:53] have a passion for the word of God
[59:55] we should let the devil know what side

[1:02:19] God to cast out those diseases you're
[1:02:22] afflicted by the devil we've got the
[1:02:24] Authority today to cast out the powers

[1:02:41] bride we are the
[1:02:43] bride somebody say praise the Lord
[1:02:46] tonight prise the
[1:02:48] Lord one of the quotes that I that I I
[1:02:51] really appreciate is the revelation of
[1:02:53] Jesus Christ and and one of the reasons
[1:02:55] because it speaks so directly to us as a
[1:02:58] people and brother Brown says Satan
[1:03:00] knows ass surely that the original
[1:03:02] church at Pentecost with the power of
[1:03:04] God is Mark 16 in action it's the true
[1:03:08] church that Jesus claims as his own it
[1:03:11] says all else is false it has to be amen
[1:03:15] so we need a church with Mark 16 and
[1:03:18] action I believe we're standing in front
[1:03:20] of a people today that believe Mark 16
[1:03:22] is an action and put it into
[1:03:25] action amen he says now remember this
[1:03:28] Christ in the true church is a
[1:03:30] continuation of the book of Acts it's
[1:03:33] something that continues on Amen if the
[1:03:36] if the vine ever puts forth another
[1:03:38] Branch it'll be the same as the original
[1:03:40] Branch amen he says but the Book of
[1:03:43] Revelation shows how that Antichrist
[1:03:45] Spirit would come into the church and
[1:03:47] defile it and make it lukewarm and make
[1:03:50] it
[1:03:51] powerless amen I want to say I I'm not
[1:03:54] going to be no lukewarm no
[1:03:56] sir I am not going to be
[1:03:59] formal I'm certainly not going to be
[1:04:02] powerless if I'm going to put my whole
[1:04:04] life into this gospel that Christ called
[1:04:06] me for this I am not going to be no
[1:04:09] lukewarm I'm not going to be formal and
[1:04:12] I'm not going to be powerless amen I may
[1:04:14] not know my ABCs but I want to know
[1:04:17] Jesus Christ amen a personal experience
[1:04:20] with him amen where there's a power of
[1:04:22] God moving in my life the power of God
[1:04:25] moving in your life amen what would it
[1:04:27] be at the end of it all if we would
[1:04:29] stand there and miss
[1:04:31] it amen we would have wasted our whole
[1:04:33] time amen because of being formal and
[1:04:36] power and lukewarm but I say I'm not I'm
[1:04:39] determined not to be formal or powerless
[1:04:42] or lukewarm I want a passion in my life
[1:04:45] a passion to hold on to this word a
[1:04:48] passion to believe this word a passion
[1:04:51] to walk in this word hallelujah
[1:04:54] sometimes people may think that oh you
[1:04:56] just want a lot of enthusiasm we should
[1:04:58] be enthused and people say we shouldn't
[1:05:01] be enthused I don't understand that

[1:07:24] discrediting of God's word right down to
[1:07:26] the time he is cast into the Lake of

[1:10:00] me Invincible means incapable of being
[1:10:04] conquered

[1:10:11] impossible it don't matter what the
[1:10:13] devil tries he cannot conquer you he's
[1:10:16] incapable of conquering you amen it
[1:10:20] means that he's Inca you're incapable of
[1:10:22] being conquered incapable of being
[1:10:24] overcome or cap incapable of being
[1:10:28] subdued in other words we become an
[1:10:30] invincible Army amen not just a one
[1:10:33] person but a multi-member bride of Jesus
[1:10:36] Christ amen standing upon the Earth in

[1:10:55] of God Amen through a new birth
[1:10:57] experience that puts the holy ghost in
[1:11:00] my life so that it's no longer me but
[1:11:02] it's Christ Living Through Me amen it's
[1:11:04] Christ inside of us the great conqueror
[1:11:08] himself which makes us the in the
[1:11:10] Invincible Army of Jesus
[1:11:15] Christ Jesus's last words in St Matthew
[1:11:18] 28:20 was Lo I'll be with you to the end
[1:11:21] of the world Amen I believe he's still
[1:11:24] with us he's never forsaken us sometimes
[1:11:28] we don't realize and we think well I
[1:11:29] don't know if the Lord's with me it's
[1:11:31] not how much we feel it's how much we
[1:11:36] believe do you believe it's our brother
[1:11:39] brownon was trying to get the people to
[1:11:41] do to believe if the people believe then
[1:11:44] all things are possible to them that can
[1:11:47] believe amen this last day bride can't
[1:11:50] be stopped come on
[1:11:54] hello this last day bride cannot be

[1:12:21] stopped why because you've got
[1:12:23] Revelation you know who Jesus is you
[1:12:26] know who you
[1:12:28] are it's impossible for Satan to stop
[1:12:31] it so you can get up every morning and
[1:12:34] say Boo
[1:12:35] devil because you can't be
[1:12:40] stopped that's the
[1:12:44] truth it's a rising of the
[1:12:48] Sun but now the true Trinity of God
[1:12:51] being one manifest in Christ who who was
[1:12:53] life and had broke the seals and
[1:12:55] conquered the enemy rose up and the one
[1:12:58] true and living God I am he that was
[1:13:00] dead and I'm alive forever more and have
[1:13:02] the keys of death and Hell God in one

[1:13:27] he's your lord and he's your savior amen
[1:13:30] one God made man and dwelt Among Us and
[1:13:33] conquered every enemy let's say
[1:13:35] conquered conquered conquered every
[1:13:37] enemy and had proved that the Trinity of
[1:13:40] Satan was conquered well we could close
[1:13:43] up the Bible right there and go home cuz
[1:13:45] the Devil is a defeated foe I know we
[1:13:48] hear it all the time the devil's
[1:13:49] defeated then why do we allow him to
[1:13:52] boot us around and kick us us around
[1:13:54] when it should be the opposite way where
[1:13:56] we should take our Authority as the
[1:13:58] Bride of Jesus
[1:14:01] Christ
[1:14:05] Glory
[1:14:07] Hallelujah Trinity of God was made known
[1:14:10] Satan was conquered that the Trinity of
[1:14:12] God was made known because only God
[1:14:14] Alone had power to bring life back again
[1:14:18] he was that Emmanuel God had been
[1:14:21] manifested in the flesh says no wonder
[1:14:24] he claimed there Matthew the 28th
[1:14:26] chapter all power right is G in Heaven
[1:14:29] and Earth is given into my hand I send
[1:14:32] you to be my witness to all the world
[1:14:35] Amen he had conquered both death and
[1:14:37] Hell In The Grave not only did he do
[1:14:40] that and came out triumphant with all
[1:14:42] the power of Heaven and the Earth all
[1:14:44] that was the father and all that was the
[1:14:47] Holy Ghost and all that there ever was
[1:14:49] was in him all powers in heaven and an
[1:14:53] earth is given unto me I love these next
[1:14:56] four words everything else is powerless
[1:15:01] Hallelujah let's say it together
[1:15:03] everything else is powerless let's try
[1:15:07] it one more time everything else is
[1:15:10] powerless so when our Lord conquered the
[1:15:13] devil on Calvary everything else is
[1:15:16] powerless amen then you've got a
[1:15:18] defeated foe that we face every day and
[1:15:20] he's just a bluff in this hour
[1:15:23] Hallelujah Glory Glory Glory Glory Amen
[1:15:28] brother Brown said he had conquered
[1:15:32] it powerless as we read Satan will be
[1:15:36] powerless before the
[1:15:37] bride amen that gives me courage yes sir
[1:15:40] because it's an affirmative statement
[1:15:43] I'm an invincible Army you're an
[1:15:44] invincible Army and Satan is powerless
[1:15:47] before the Invincible Army in other
[1:15:49] words he's incapable of conquering
[1:15:52] you that's just what make you want to
[1:15:54] shout amen that just what make you want
[1:15:56] to dance amen Satan is powerless
[1:16:00] incapable of conquering you amen why
[1:16:03] because you
[1:16:04] are the true bride of Jesus Christ
[1:16:08] walking in this hour that we're living
[1:16:10] in blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:16:13] somebody say praise the Lord
[1:16:15] tonight amen I know we're getting to
[1:16:17] know each other so just bear with
[1:16:21] me but we love the word
[1:16:23] yes that's what I love I love the
[1:16:26] word amen Satan is powerless that word
[1:16:30] powerless means devoid of
[1:16:34] strength it means devoid of
[1:16:37] resources in other words he's got
[1:16:38] nothing
[1:16:39] else that's
[1:16:42] it well brother Brown said that he he he
[1:16:45] said Satan's powerless only if he can
[1:16:47] Bluff
[1:16:49] y so I say he's
[1:16:51] powerless he's powerless in your life on
[1:16:56] Amen he's powerless in your neighbor's
[1:16:58] life amen he's powerless in our
[1:17:01] lives amen we're an invincible Army we
[1:17:05] know who we are that we are the Bride of
[1:17:08] Jesus Christ he's given us bride
[1:17:12] Authority you can just go into the
[1:17:14] presence of God ask the Lord anything
[1:17:17] you
[1:17:19] want if you're sick in your body the lay
[1:17:24] call the Elders of the church lay hands
[1:17:25] on their sick they shall recover amen
[1:17:28] sometimes we think well what if it what
[1:17:30] if it takes so long we we we look but
[1:17:32] what if it it didn't happen
[1:17:34] immediately I suffered with asthma for
[1:17:36] 17
[1:17:38] years still have some some problems that
[1:17:40] I deal with but God was my
[1:17:42] healer amen it took 17 years but it came
[1:17:45] a time when my time was there amen and I
[1:17:48] say that it makes me happy when I think
[1:17:50] about that he's my healer amen it gives
[1:17:53] me something to shout about because I
[1:17:55] know he's my healer amen when somebody
[1:17:57] else comes in a prayer line you can say
[1:18:00] God heal me from this you say it took 17
[1:18:02] years that's a long time in God's
[1:18:04] economy it's a short time it may feel
[1:18:08] long for us but in God's economy it's a
[1:18:10] short
[1:18:13] time he's still the Healer it's a
[1:18:16] greater miracle if you can walk for a
[1:18:18] longer time than immediately immediate
[1:18:21] healing hope that's okay
[1:18:25] am he's a Healer he's a
[1:18:29] savior and Satan is powerless before the
[1:18:33] bride powerless he's devoid of all
[1:18:37] strength he's devoid of all
[1:18:39] resources he's the void he's lacking
[1:18:42] Authority or capacity to act he has no
[1:18:45] capacity or authority to act we read in
[1:18:49] the word of God that Satan can't even
[1:18:51] touch a hair of your head unless he gets
[1:18:52] permission from almighty God Amen so God

[1:22:02] of yeast he wants an invincible Army he
[1:22:04] wants people both capable of
[1:22:07] fighting amen we got to fight if we're

[1:22:37] to stop a car no but he's been given
[1:22:40] Authority by the
[1:22:42] government and that Authority by the
[1:22:44] government when he puts up his hands all
[1:22:45] cars come to a
[1:22:47] stop amen he don't got no no power to
[1:22:49] stop those car right but he's got a poor
[1:22:52] authority to say that's far enough right
[1:22:54] there amen you've got that same
[1:22:57] Authority amen through the baptism of
[1:22:59] the Holy Ghost on your life amen you can
[1:23:01] put up your hand and say devil that's
[1:23:04] enough I I ask you to stop right there

[1:23:42] would overcome the Earth but the Moon is
[1:23:44] there to tell that's enough that's far
[1:23:46] enough amen it's signifying the power
[1:23:49] and authority that you have as a bride
[1:23:51] member amen that you can stand in that
[1:23:53] same position as a Son of God you don't
[1:23:56] have to go walking around like all
[1:23:57] downtrod and put your shoulders back
[1:24:00] amen and act like Sons and Daughters of
[1:24:02] the Living God Amen we should be the
[1:24:05] happiest people on the planet
[1:24:09] Earth Joy should be in our heart you say
[1:24:13] brother Kelly I just got a a doctor
[1:24:15] appoint a a doctor uh uh uh gave me a
[1:24:19] doctor's um U pron noxic and and you say
[1:24:22] it's not a good good
[1:24:24] thought but we should have uncontainable
[1:24:27] joy in our heart amen not because we're
[1:24:30] not feeling well but because we know who
[1:24:32] we
[1:24:32] [Applause]
[1:24:34] are it's not about the feeling of this
[1:24:37] flesh it's about what's in our
[1:24:40] heart that's what counts is what's in
[1:24:44] our
[1:24:45] heart Hallelujah
[1:24:48] wonderful water can only come so far
[1:24:52] then it has to retreat it has to move
[1:24:55] back that's right I say what about the
[1:24:57] Bride of Jesus Christ being part of the
[1:25:00] groom with power and authority in this
[1:25:03] hour Christ being the groom of the Bride
[1:25:05] has to come forth because it's part of
[1:25:07] him and it can only be manifestation of
[1:25:09] the fulfilling of all the revelations
[1:25:12] any others have spoken of the Bride it
[1:25:13] can only manifest if it does something
[1:25:16] different from the groom it isn't the
[1:25:19] bride amen because she is flesh of his
[1:25:21] flesh and B B of his bone and life of
[1:25:23] his life and power of his power she is
[1:25:26] him as a man and woman are one and the
[1:25:28] woman taken from his side she had taken
[1:25:30] a spirit the feminine Spirit from him
[1:25:33] the flesh from his side made both
[1:25:34] mechanics and Dynamics the wife the
[1:25:37] spirit of him and the Flesh of him and
[1:25:38] put it together and made the mechanics
[1:25:41] and Dynamics in other words you've got
[1:25:44] that Authority the moon stands with his
[1:25:46] authority the policeman stands with
[1:25:48] their Authority and you stand with your
[1:25:51] Authority
[1:25:53] [Applause]
[1:25:55] amen
[1:25:56] yes we're living in an hour where energy
[1:26:00] is talked about all the time
[1:26:03] yeah I don't know about in America
[1:26:06] but in Canada they have this this idea
[1:26:09] that we're all going to drive electric
[1:26:10] cars by
[1:26:12] 2030 I don't think it's going to
[1:26:15] happen and and powers on everybody's
[1:26:17] mind we can't even support our own local
[1:26:20] grid let alone everybody plugging a car
[1:26:21] in
[1:26:23] that's kind of going to be a
[1:26:26] disaster amen even some of our people in
[1:26:29] in in our public offices and things like
[1:26:31] that they're they're acting like oh
[1:26:32] we're driving this electric car but they
[1:26:35] got designated charging stations so
[1:26:36] nobody else can to take them that's kind
[1:26:38] of
[1:26:40] convenient but power is on everybody's
[1:26:43] mind and power is is something that is
[1:26:46] needed in the hour that we're living in
[1:26:49] you know we've gone from the horse and
[1:26:50] buggy age in 100 years years to the jet
[1:26:54] age to the rocket age amen rockets that
[1:26:57] they're making today can travel at
[1:26:59] incredible
[1:27:00] speeds horse and Buggies you didn't go
[1:27:03] very
[1:27:04] far because that was that was only the
[1:27:06] spear where you could go but today we
[1:27:08] can get on a plane we got here in good
[1:27:11] time brother Timothy was there in time
[1:27:13] to pick us
[1:27:14] up everything worked out
[1:27:17] great we can travel great distances
[1:27:20] today yeah be in different places
[1:27:22] because of the hour that we're living in
[1:27:23] that's right cuz there there's more
[1:27:25] power that's available for us as people
[1:27:27] to use amen I can remember not very very
[1:27:31] many years ago and this kind of maybe
[1:27:33] dates us a bit but when our church
[1:27:35] actually we used to heat our church with
[1:27:37] coal oil and with wood many many years
[1:27:40] ago didn't have indoor plumbing on it so
[1:27:42] you know what kind of Plumbing we had it
[1:27:45] was called outdoor
[1:27:46] plumbing and and nowadays we just go
[1:27:48] into the church and we turn up the heat
[1:27:50] and we turn up the cooling system and
[1:27:52] everybody's just about happy not
[1:27:53] everybody's
[1:27:56] happy that happens that way too I guess
[1:27:58] here same what we
[1:28:00] do I always thought if somebody could
[1:28:02] come up with a Pew without had a heat
[1:28:04] and in a cooling spot for every person
[1:28:05] to sit on that'd be a wealthy
[1:28:08] M but we're so used to just coming in we
[1:28:11] just turn the heat up we don't think
[1:28:12] anything about it anymore if the power
[1:28:14] goes up we panic because we're so used
[1:28:17] to it but we're moving away from fossil
[1:28:20] fields or they think we are to El El
[1:28:23] everything's electric amen LED lights
[1:28:25] and no doubt we have them in here
[1:28:27] tonight they're brighter and more
[1:28:29] effective than than anything's ever been
[1:28:31] before amen take less energy to run
[1:28:34] cordless tools that that are available
[1:28:36] today with brushless motors there they
[1:28:38] more power all the time it seems like
[1:28:40] it's a power race who's going to make
[1:28:42] something lightest with the most power
[1:28:45] available to it amen electric cars are
[1:28:48] something that is starting to be
[1:28:49] prevalent and they're incredibly quick
[1:28:51] they go from 0 to 60 in a couple of
[1:28:53] seconds of time amen because there's one
[1:28:57] there's more power all the time when it
[1:28:59] becomes more power all the time then
[1:29:01] people can move quickly and more quickly
[1:29:03] to places they want to go one thing I I
[1:29:05] did some I did some research on it one
[1:29:07] time and and they say that you can
[1:29:09] charge up a car in 80 80% in about 30
[1:29:13] minutes if you're at one of these
[1:29:14] supercharger places I kind of like that
[1:29:16] thought of supercharger amen when I come
[1:29:18] to church I want more than just a
[1:29:20] supercharger for 30 minutes
[1:29:22] amen I want a full charge every time I
[1:29:24] come to the house of the Lord amen I
[1:29:26] don't want no little sermanet amen I
[1:29:28] want something to have some Vitality
[1:29:30] something that has that that that's
[1:29:32] going to give you a full charge in this
[1:29:34] hour not just a half a charge or a part
[1:29:37] charge but a full
[1:29:39] charge amen when I heard that I thought
[1:29:42] well what good is that battery so you
[1:29:43] only got 60% you can use cuz you got 10%
[1:29:46] here and 10% there and the whole thing's
[1:29:48] gone amen I thought we need a full
[1:29:51] charge of the holy spirit all the time
[1:29:53] in our lives amen I say we don't want
[1:29:56] quick charges but we want we want full
[1:29:58] charges but powers on the people's mind
[1:30:01] amen Satan's trying to make it more
[1:30:03] convenient to travel amen but God is
[1:30:05] trying to get us to look
[1:30:07] upwards Amen to give us the power and
[1:30:10] the Authority for one day we're going to
[1:30:13] take off from this whole world somebody

[1:42:48] the authority in the word of God can you
[1:42:51] imagine when John and Peter were at the
[1:42:52] gate called beautiful and the Bible said
[1:42:55] there was a certain man at the
[1:42:57] gate it doesn't even give the man's name
[1:43:00] he was imp poent from his mother's womb
[1:43:02] 40 years old standing sitting at the
[1:43:04] gate amen the Lord made sure he was
[1:43:06] there for a long
[1:43:09] time as a witness and a testimony of the
[1:43:13] power of Jesus Christ 40 years he bed 40
[1:43:18] years he was asking for somebody to help
[1:43:20] him but there came one day a it just
[1:43:23] took one
[1:43:25] time one
[1:43:26] moment in the presence of
[1:43:29] God just one
[1:43:33] moment Silver and Gold Have I None but
[1:43:36] such as I have I give it unto you and he
[1:43:39] grabbed him by their heart and picked
[1:43:40] him off from that spot and he started to

[1:43:55] leaped and he
[1:43:59] jumped maybe we haven't had experience
[1:44:02] with God but when you one time get an
[1:44:04] experience with God you can
[1:44:07] shout you can
[1:44:09] leap you can jump you can give God the
[1:44:13] glory mayy because he's a living God in
[1:44:16] this
[1:44:17] hour just one moment in the presence of
[1:44:22] God
[1:44:25] hallelujah it's time to thank God for
[1:44:28] what he's done for the Church of Liv God
[1:44:31] I say great thanks has our God
[1:44:34] done blessed be the name of the Lord he
[1:44:38] jumped and he
[1:44:39] [Applause]
[1:44:41] leaped on the day of Acts acts 238 there
[1:44:44] was 3,000 men that came to the Lord
[1:44:46] 3,000 people brother Brown said the
[1:44:49] devil didn't even get out of bed
[1:44:52] but that
[1:44:54] day they had to take note that they'd
[1:44:56] been with
[1:44:57] Jesus because they were doing the same
[1:45:00] works as always happened when Jesus was
[1:45:02] there amen they wanted to quiet them
[1:45:05] down they said we're not quetting it
[1:45:08] down no sir well we're going to threaten
[1:45:10] you you go ahead and threaten us it
[1:45:12] don't make no difference we're going to
[1:45:13] go find our group of people and we're
[1:45:16] going to have an oldfashioned prayer
[1:45:17] meeting
[1:45:18] time and we're going to pray and and not
[1:45:21] say Lord oh they've been threatening us
[1:45:23] Lord what are we to do no they didn't do
[1:45:25] that no sir they they went before the
[1:45:28] Lord they say Lord you hear their
[1:45:29] threatenings what we need from you Lord
[1:45:31] is another dose of the Holy Ghost I
[1:45:34] wonder if the church of living God don't
[1:45:36] need another ghost of the Holy Ghost in
[1:45:38] the hour that we're living in today an
[1:45:41] hour of the time today that we're living
[1:45:43] in that will punch us the
[1:45:47] rapture we need the holy ghost in a
[1:45:50] greater
[1:45:51] measure and my Bible says your Bible
[1:45:55] says the house was
[1:45:57] shaken and they came up with a double
[1:46:00] portion with more power and more
[1:46:03] authority to speak about the things of
[1:46:06] God that's what we need in the Pulpit is
[1:46:08] more power and authority that's what the
[1:46:11] people need in the Pew is more power and
[1:46:13] authority in the word of God to
[1:46:15] withstand the demon power of this age
[1:46:17] that we're living in oh hell must be
[1:46:20] empty know but we've got all of God in
[1:46:22] us now amen we've come back to the final
[1:46:25] revelation of the word who Jesus Christ
[1:46:30] is I emphasize that for a
[1:46:33] reason I don't know who all Tunes in
[1:46:35] here but I want them to know where I
[1:46:37] stand brother brandham said that the
[1:46:39] greatest revelation of this time the
[1:46:41] Capstone revelation of this time is that
[1:46:43] Jesus is God not two or three but he is
[1:46:47] God and he's the one who I serve and
[1:46:50] he's the one who's empowering Us in this
[1:46:52] hour it's not a second person or a third
[1:46:55] person or some other person or just an
[1:46:58] elder brother is Jesus Christ Our Lord
[1:47:01] and
[1:47:02] Savior the Living
[1:47:06] God hallelujah hallelujah yes
