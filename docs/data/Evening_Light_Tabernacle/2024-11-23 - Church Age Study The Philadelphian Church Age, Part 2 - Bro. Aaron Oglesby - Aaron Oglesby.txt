to take complete control in the name of Jesus we pray amen amen amen it's good to be back together here on a Friday night for for another church age study and and we're going to start by reading here in the in the Book of Revelation the third chapter and the seventh verse and we're going to get right into it we're on the second part of the Philadelphian Church age in the first eight or nine slides or so what we're going to do is we'll just recap and review what we've already covered of this age before before we get into uh new material as it were tonight so Revelations 3: 7 and we'll read down through 13 says unto the angel of the Church of the Philadelphia write these things sayith he that is Holy he that is true he that hath the Key of David he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth says I Know Thy Works behold I have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou Hast a little strength and H has kept my word and has not denied my name behold I will make them of the synagogue of Satan which say they are Jews and are not but do lie behold I will make them to come in worship before thy feet and to know that I have loved thee because thou Hast kept the word of my patience I also will keep thee from the hour of Temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the Earth behold I come quickly hold that fast which thou Hast that no man take thy crown him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God and he shall go no more out and I will write upon him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God which is New Jerusalem which cometh down out of Heaven from my God and I will write upon him my new name he that hath a he let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches amen I pray that the Lord will add us blessing to the reading of the word as you take your seats tonight amen before we get into it and as we get into it we I want to start right here and it's a slide you've seen every single time we've done a church age study and the quote here brother Brown says it is the key is the Revelation that God never changes is and that his ways are as unchangeable as he is Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and I know like I said every time we have a church a study I show this slide I go over this point and we always will because this is at the core of the whole Bible this is at the core of of everything that we believe this scripture Hebrews 13:8 was was the very theme of brother bram's Ministry because it was at the the core of what he believed and that what he did at the beginning is what he's going to do at the end how he acted one way is how he's going to act again so if he healed before he'll heal again and if he saved before he'll save again if if he was against something 2,000 years ago he's against it now he he never changes his ways are unchangeable brother brandom says it's the Keystone of the whole Bible amen that God does not change and I'm thankful tonight for that and we can rest in that tonight knowing that his promises are as sure tonight as they've ever been if he gave the Holy Ghost before he'll give it to you tonight and on the exact same grounds that he gave it before Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and and we're studying here in the Philadelphian age or the sixth Age and and and if you see here on the map just to place it we're looking here at Asia Minor and we've gone around the map starting in the bottom left at Ephesus then Smyrna and pergamon thyra Sardis and we've come to Philadelphia it is known as the age of Brotherly Love and it lasted from around 1750 up to around 1906 and and the messenger we spent a lot of time talking about the messenger when we covered this the first time because because John Wesley truly was a a a a phenomenal man and some of the things that he did was was just incredible but he lived from 1703 to 1791 he was one of 19 children if you got a problem getting along with your one or two siblings you'd have had trouble in this house one of 19 children and and I just had a few facts in there he rode 4,500 miles a year on a horse and his lifetime he preached more than 40,000 sermons and and I said this last time that's really impressive to me because I think I'm around a hundred so I'm not going to get there okay I'm not going to get to 40,000 no matter what I do because his ministry was like 50 years long and he preached four or five times a day for the entirety of it brother brandham said he preached something like 880,000 sermons it was a no 40,000 sermons I'm sorry 40,000 sermons in his lifetime brother Bram says that John Wesley says of himself he could not remember to have felt lowness of spirits for even a quarter of an hour since he was born that's pretty incredible statement I I I couldn't make that statement about last week now imagine riding a horse non-stop through bad weather and getting attacked we talked about him attacking him and trying to kill him and stoning and sticks and turning Bulls loose in his meeting he never got upset about it and and and I don't know how realistic that is for me but I do want to be more like that I would love to get to a place to where to where you know we don't up and down according to the to to the struggles of life because we have a promise we have a god understand that life gets difficult but I feel like the reason he was the way he was is he was so anchored in the promise that it didn't matter if it was a good day or a bad day or or today didn't go the way I wanted it to or the service didn't go the way I expected it to he was anchored in the promise and not the the way the winds blew on that day and if we can get ourselves to that place where we can anchor down in the promise tonight then it don't matter how bad tomorrow seems or the next day you're not going to be up and down so much in your your emotions cuz you know God's going to take care of it God's going to see me through this and let ourselves get anchored down into the promise tonight it says he slept no more than six hours a day he arose in time to start preaching at 5: practically every day of his ministry he preached up to four times on a single day so that in a year he would average 800 sermons that's a pretty he is an an incredible man and and I feel like yeah it accidentally changed the slides I'm sorry and we spoke last time about this age about the beginning and the ending of Ages and how they don't end abruptly and how they don't start abruptly but there's a blending from one into the next and it's even more so when we get to the sixth and seventh age brother brand says there's an overlapping a melting or Fading Into rather than an Abrupt end and a clearcut start this age particularly flows into the next age and not only does this age overflow into the last age but the last age is in many respects simply a carrying on of the sixth age and the reason we keep focusing on this and making this a point in our teaching it's important because it helps us to recognize that some of what is spoke to the sixth age is actually being spoken to us it is applicable to us and has even being spoke directly to this age and and as we found out that the sixth age was a great age of of missions and and spreading of the word and it was a great age of of revivals and I know y'all have heard the term the Great Awakening this is when this was taking place and and it was a great missionary age it was the greatest spreading of the word that the world had ever seen Luther began to open the door in the previous age but it's in this age that it was busted open and and men with a burden took the word around the world names you've heard like like George Whitefield and and Jonathan Edwards and Charles finny yeah I don't know if they would do it today but when I was in public school I want to say my freshman year we actually read an excerpt uh of Jonathan Edward's sermon in our literature book and I still remember it to this day it was called sinners in the hands of an Angry God and so so we we read sermons because these men were extremely famous because they accomplished so much God was in their Ministry and the Word was preached to the entire world and and it was an incredible time and yet brother brandham teaches us that it was lacking power and we dealt with that Wednesday night talking about the door of of word and power but but they handled the word well and yet the spirit was lacking and I want to say again to to evening like Tabernacle and to the youth because you know you're only the youth for so long you're going to wake up a few more times and you're not going to be the youth anymore you're going to be sitting back there or not showing up to the youth things or however it is that's my point being you're not going to be the youth forever it's going to be very soon you're going to be the pillars you're going to be the deacons you're going to be the the the main singers or the or preachers and everybody went but it happens like this as I was even studying for this I I thought about very specific portions of tonight's material that I remember brother Tim teaching when he did the church age study around the year 99 2000 and it happened like that and you wake up one day and you're 38 or you're 45 and so I want to say no matter how long time terries don't get to the place to where people can look at evening like Tabernacle and say that's a good church that's a good group of people but they're lacking the spirit that that's a that's a nice group of people but they're lacking power we can't ever allow ourselves to get to the place no matter how good the doctrine is no matter how good the sermons are no matter how well you know this and that and can quote it's no good to us without the power it it's no good if it can't keep us and it's no good if it don't bring overcoming power in our lives so let's make sure that that we welcome the moving of the spirit that that we enter into service say God move how you see fit today I'm I'm not worried about how that person worships or that person worships I'm going to give you my everything and let you move in this service today we must have the power of God moving in our midst without the power of God there is no Deliverance without the power of God there there's no miraculous and and without the power of God there can be no body change there there can be no Rapture so so I can't understand when when we begin to pull away from those things saying this isn't the age or this isn't the time this is the specific time that all that was was for the Supernatural is for today the power of God is for today because the most Supernatural event that's ever happened is about to take place and you're not going to walk around here and it's not for today it's not for today it's not for today and then wake up on Rapture morning and have the faith for the greatest Miracle that's ever happened but it's going to build and build and build and build and then culminate in that event this is the age of the supernatural but brother brandham speaking of that day the sixth age he says the power of the spirit was missing in that age he says the word was well preached he never says anything about you know they didn't have their doctrines right and they they mess he says the word was well preached it was well able to make Souls wise under salvation but the power of God that showed forth his mighty works that made bear his arm in behalf of his own was missing except amongst the scattered groups and and when I read this the first time it g it gave me such Joy it says yet praise God it was growing and it had increased over what they had in the Reformation it was growing in other words even though it was lacking the devil had not stopped it listen I don't care how much you go down through the Dark Ages and the bad times and the worst times in Philadelphia and Leota you're going to find times where the devil maybe hits here and Strikes here and it ain't quite living up to what what it should be but he's never been able to stop it and I want you to get that down in your heart today he may hit me and I may be not where I ought to be but he's not going to be able to stop me I'm not going to fall short no matter what I'm still growing that's the key tonight I'm not stagnant don't let the devil beat you up over mistakes and and I'm not quite exactly where I listen if we were all quite exactly where we ought to be we' are raptured but but it's time that when the Devil comes and he begins to point to look at this flaw and look at this we point him back and say you forget what I once was and how far God has brought me and what he's doing in my life maybe I'm not there yet but I'm still growing let him know that you're you're still growing because we will not and cannot be stopped in this day amen the seed was progressing you could see it building towards the restoration of the gifts you could see it building towards the opening of the word it was growing and and there's an open door here in the midst and last time we we dealt with the open door as it as it relates to the missionary field the door was open for the spreading of the word but if you read this beforehand brother brandham goes into a different um he deals with it from a different angle and as we read this section perhaps maybe it was a little confusing what brother Brown was saying about about the blending of the ages and a door being between the ages but what we see is that God placed an open door between the two ages it wasn't just an Open Door in Philadelphia and it was between the two ages right at the end of Philadelphia and right at the beginning between the ages Lea and we're going to move into that right now I have set before thee an open door he says I Know Thy Works behold I've set before thee an open door and I highlighted three parts because that's what we're going to focus on and no man can shut it for thou Hast a little strength and has kept my word and has not denied my name brother Brown says notice how this verse Revelation 38 goes Open Door little strength word name that open door has to do with all three now what does the door signify and now I know we dealt with this a good bit Wednesday night we covered a lot of this so hopefully it'll be familiar to you but John 10:7 says then said Jesus unto them again verily verily I say unto you I am the door of the Sheep and brother Brandon when he's teaching on this he says when I was over in the East I saw that at night the shepherd would gather all his sheep together he would put them into the fold then he would count them when he was sure that they were all in when he was sure that they were all in listen I want you to get it down in your heart today he's not going to lose you the devil keeps coming and because of this and because of that and because you're in a slump you're not really his you're not going to make it you're not going to be there and listen we are to take those things and we're to grab them and we're to take those imaginations and cast down anything that exalts itself against the word of God tonight he's telling you are a son of God you are a daughter of God you are going to make it maybe you're going through a tough battle right now maybe you don't feel like a Son of God or a daughter of God tonight but that has nothing to do with the reality of the word word and he's telling you I'm counting everyone I know which ones are mine and I'm not going to lose a one of them I'm not going to lose you tonight well how do I know if you hear that knock on your heart he's not knocking on your heart just to prank you he's knocking on your heart because you belong to him he's knocking on your heart because you're going to make it he's knocking on your heart because you are his child tonight brother Brown says he he he would put them into the fold then he would count them when he was sure that they were all in he would lie down in the open door of the fold and literally become the door of the fold that Thrills my heart once again I know there's wolves out there I know there's demons out there I know there's evil influences out there and I know they're trying to get to our young people I know they're trying to get into our homes I know they're trying to rob you but listen you don't got to be scared tonight because he's laying in the doorway tonight listen there's no peace like you have in Jesus there's no safety like you have in Jesus there's no comfort that you can have in your life like you can have tonight when you're with Jesus Christ amen amen I know that the devil's going about like a roaring line and he's screaming and he's howling but just remember he's on the other side of the door tonight I know he's trying to get you but Jesus has laid down in the doorway Jesus gave his life for you you don't have anything to fear tonight brother brandham says when night time comes I want to be in his fold I want to be in his care listen it's dark Saints it's the darkest of nights but we're in his care tonight if you're not it say it's not too late but this just a Bible study tonight brother and I I know but he'll meet you at a Bible study he'll meet you right here tonight if you just want to Lay Your Heart down say Jesus I want to come into the fold tonight I want that peace that passes all understand I want that Comfort I want to know that I know that I know that I've given Jesus my everything as we move on I want to call our attention back to a thought from earlier in our studies maybe the first or second one we ever had and we talked about the importance of Revelation and if you'll remember in Matthew 16 Jesus comes and he asks Peter and he says who do you say that I am and Peter answers and he says Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus responds to to Peter there and he says blessed art thou Simon barjona for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say also unto thee Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it now now the Catholics and different ones have taken that and they say okay he said Thou Art Peter and and Peter means little Stone and and so he's the rock that he built the church on so he built the church on a guy who just a few days later is going to deny him who just a few days later is going to curse and say I never knew the man but if you'll back up just a little bit and read it all together he says Flesh and Blood hath not revealed this to you but my Father which is in heaven and then he and he's saying and Upon This Rock The Rock of Revelation not just any Revelation but the rock of the revelation of who Jesus is when you get that Revelation that's what he's building his church on and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it Amen brother BR says it isn't as the Protestants say that the church is built upon Jesus it was the Revelation he says read it the way it is written Flesh and Blood have not revealed it but my father hath revealed it and Upon This Rock Revelation I will build my church the church is built on Revelation the church is built on Revelation so you can never overemphasize how important Revelation is and that's what we mean when we say things like hey we don't want this to be a head kn knowled we don't want this to be something you memorize okay Malachi 4 Revelation 10:7 Luke 17:30 okay brother Brandon was born the angel visited him in this year that's all that's all good stuff I'm glad if you know some facts but that's like knowing facts about the Civil War they're just facts they're just historical events but what you want is for the revelation of Jesus Christ the the revelation of the revealed word of the hour the revelation of who Jesus is and the revelation of who you are and that you're his and that when he said that repent be baptized and you shall receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Revelation that he was speaking to you and the Revelation that the promise is unto you and when that Revelation gets on the inside of you and it's not just a jump or a shout although it'll cause that sometimes but it's an anchor that grabs hold and it grabs hold it may be bumping along the bottom tonight and you're wondering and you're wondering but he's telling you there's a re ation for you tonight that it's for you that you're his and that the Holy Ghost is yours tonight if you can just grab a hold of it let that Revelation sink down that's what it's built upon we've said it before that that you know the one who has an experience is not at the mercy of a man who has an argument once you experiencing people can come and point out all the facts they want it don't matter I was there I experienced it I saw it it you can come with all kind of facts telling me what I did today and you might can line them all up but I was the one there you'll never talk me out of what I did today it's like the little boy eating the apple and he asked the the man who was who was mocking you whether there was a God and and all these things and how he wasn't real and little boy asked him says well let me ask you a question is this apple sweet or is it sour and the man said I don't know I'm not the one eating it and little boy said that's what I thought let them come and tell you this ain't real they're not the one eating from it tonight they're not the one feeding from it tonight they're not the ones experiencing it tonight and once you experience it for yourself and get that Revelation for yourself no devil in hell is going to be able to Prevail against that amen brother brandham says the importance of Revelation by the spirit to a True Believer can never be overemphasized Revelation means more to you than perhaps you realize now I'm not talking about this book of Revelation and you I'm talking about all Revelation it is tremendously important to the church he goes on to say yes Satan hates Revelation but we love it with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them now I'm still I'm talking about Revelation but I'm dealing with that open door between the ages okay that that's where we're at and what the first early church had was the revelation of the godhead as one God the revelation of the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ and that's what we're seeing returned in this Open Door between the two ages what's being opened is once again the revelation of who Jesus is remember down Through the Ages the Catholic church had taken it and they they'd broken him into three and you had three different persons and you had all this different Pagan worship and even people who wanted to do right and people who were doing their best many times were still trinitarians but in this age the truth the door we've already learned what is the door who is the door it's Jesus and he's saying in this age I'm opening a door to you what's it opening I'm revealing myself once again it was in this age that once again the door or revelation of who Jesus is was being open to the Believers once again the the revelation of Jesus Christ was coming he says now then we can see that Jesus is the door he is the door of the sheep and notice that it speaks now that the door door is opening what is that but a revelation of him and that Revelation is opening up to bring us strength to illuminate the word and to glorify his name so what is it here that is set before the church it's the open door of the revelation of Jesus Christ now listen most of you have' been raised in a message church you've heard this your whole life but for thousands of years it had been hidden for thousand of years it had been kept away and Satan had beat the people and beat the people and beat the people with this Trinity Doctrine and it kept them from the open door of power had kept them from the true Open Door had kept them from the way the truth and the life who do we pray to is it the father is it the son how do we get the Holy Ghost but in this age it's opening back up to them once again this isn't a little thing this is a big thing it was in the last two ages that that the truth that had been lost since the first age once again was opening to the church what is that truth brother Aaron that he is God alone that Jesus is the Alpha and Omega he is the father he is the son he is the Holy Ghost all in one person the Lord Jesus Christ brother Brown says but the revelation of godhead is back now the true church can build on that strength again after all this time she finally knows who her Lord is once again we're baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus just as they did at Pentecost he says Thou Hast a little strength and has kept my word and is not denied my name what is it strength was returning where was this strength coming from this Revelation that Jesus is Lord Jesus Is God Jesus is everything and they were taking it and build and strength the hold of the hierarchy of Rome was being broken people were demanding freedom of religion and the preaching of the word was never greater brother brownon says never has its preachers and teachers been matched and this statement is mind-blowing and never will they be the Spurgeon Parkers McLarens Edwards bunion muers brainards Barnes Bishops all came from this era they preached taught wrote the word word they glorified his name although we've talked about them lacking power this was an incredible age it was a magnificent age they they they had some wonderful things that they did and as we would say maybe day they had a lot of good things going for them they had strength they they stood for the word and they stood against the hierarchy of the church and and they gave their lives to spread the word and they did not deny his his name notice that that's put in there that has not denied my name in other words this door opened you recognize that is truth you didn't step back and go no no no no no no no no no they didn't deny when this door opened they saw it they said it's Jesus it's Jesus that's where the strength lies that's the Revelation opening up there at the end of that age they have not denied my name the revelation of who Jesus was was back again and I know it's going to be hard for for for for a lot of you who that's all you've ever known or all you've ever been taught but this was huge this was the great hold that the that that one of the greatest claims that the devil had over the church as they were mixed up in false doctrines mixed up in false baptisms people weren't even being baptized right now with this Revelation it's not just oh we know who Jesus is it straightens everything out it fixes baptism it fixes the godhead it it it fix is a hierarchy of who do I pray to you know it's Jesus and Jesus alone it's God Almighty he is the one true Living God the door between the ages was opened baptism in Jesus name returned to the church and they had enough strength to take that strength and to walk through that door they walked through that door and what did it do it led to remember brother said it's growing the that strength they walked through had they refused to go through that door it it would have never progressed to what it did but they had enough strength to go through that door and then what do you find you hit ausa and the restoration of the gifts and now there's more strength and they're able to go further remember these things blend together and now with that strength we push on to the restoration of the word the breaking of the seals we're talking about the true seed here not the church world and now the word is restored and that has given us strength today and now it was a little strength and then it was more strength and now it's greater strength and now it's perfect strength and now with the strength we have once again there's a door to walk through it's the Rapture of the church but without the strength without them growing from stage to stage and coming to this place we would have never had the strength that we have today to take the Rapture amen I'm so thankful that that door is open to us that we're not confused today the next verse deals with the Judgment of the false Jews 3 and N says behold I will make them of the synagogue of Satan which say they are Jews and are not but do lie behold I will make them to come in worship before thy feet and to know that I have loved thee if we think back to the scripture addressed to the second age you're going to find something very very similar to this scripture and I'll go back to it right now we're going back to Revelation 2 and9 so we're speaking to the sixth age here seventh age as well but also we're going to look back to the second age here and look what it says I Know Thy Works in Tribulation and poverty thou are rich and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews and are not but are the synagogue of Satan I'm going to go back where I was I will make them of the synagogue of Satan which say they are Jews and are not but do lie now we see we're seeing a very similar thing we have people claiming to be something and they're not people claiming to be Jews and they're not so so what we see if we go back to this age here this is the second age so one age after the original outpouring one age after the original outpouring at Pentecost you have false Jews now just for our study right here and I may say this again I'm not changing the word but just so you can understand well bringing it down to us we could say false Believers we could say false Christians okay that's that's what we're dealing with here so when you say Jews there say how's this apply to us just say Christian okay so one age after the original outp poring we got false Christians claiming that they're the real thing but they're of the synagogue of Satan now if we come back to this one it's one age after the reformation and you have once again them showing up and saying we're the real Reformation we're the so it's not by accident okay falsely claiming to be true brother brandham says here he says this is hardly an accident indeed it is it is not an accident it's a principle of Satan that principle is to organize and claim originality and therefore be entitled to special rights and privileges what they do is is he gets in the church he organizes the church and because it's been organized now it dies and they leave the original life but they keep the name Christian they're no longer Christians but they're keeping the name Christian all so so Jesus is looking at it saying they're claiming to be Jews they're claiming to be Believers they're claiming to be Christians but they're Liars he's calling it how it is he's not petting things here they keep the name Christian and claim to be the original brother Bram says now of course this synagogue group wouldn't say they're of Satan no sir they say they're of God but they lie for he that is a true Jew Christian what they claim to be is one who is a Jew inwardly in the spirit remember what I say we can't be lacking the spirit here says so then if they are false it means that they are just like Jude 19 says having not the spirit children of God are born of the spirit these have not the spirit and therefore they are not children of God no matter how fervently they protest and to what links they go to try to prove that they are if you look at at Romans 2:29 what's it say but he is a Jew let's just keep the ener changing the word for our understanding he is a Christian which is one inwardly and circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit not in the letter whose praise is not of men but of God it's not about their physical birth he's saying it's about their spiritual birth you interchange that there Revelations 3:9 we're going to read that again I'm going to go back and just read it behold I will make them of the synagogue of Satan with say they are Christians and are not but do lie think about it to be born again and filled with his spirit is what makes you a Christian filled with his spirit is what makes you a Christian not coming to church every service although a Christian will not doing the things you're supposed to do although a Christian will not signing your name on a book somewhere that doesn't make you a Christian a Christian is someone who's been born again by the spirit of God Amen somebody who's sold out to themselves but what's happening is the false Vine they get in and they convince millions that they don't have to have that life they can join the church something that's dead and still claim his name they still claim his name even though they don't have his life and that's the tactic of the enemy let people think they're Christians listen if people think they're going to heaven there's no reason to change anything if from the pull pit they're told over and over again just say just you know just make a a decision and you're good then why would they ever change anything and that's the tactic of the devil to actually convince people not to stand up there and go I'm the devil and you're all going to go to hell well that wouldn't work but what's he do he LS them to sleep Jesus is a god of love brother Brown says they turn him into a Doty old Grandpa you know Grandpa don't want to punish the grand babies say turn him into do old grandpa everything's okay everything's good you're going to heaven everything's great everything everything's perfect so what do they do they keep the name and claim originality ask the Catholic Church they'll tell you we're the original we're the first church we're the original Church brother br says but now the cunningness of the Devil Makes the people believe that they are Christian when they are not I want to say it again because I don't I don't ever want you to get to a place that you say you didn't know that you must be born of the spirit of God you must be born again you can't just claim message you can't just claim I come from a good church and I say my prayers and and Mom and Daddy's a Christian you can't just pretend you can't just claim it you must be born again again prophet of God says just watch that spirit that is upon them and don't be fooled so I'm gonna say this to you tonight don't be fooled you say brother Aaron how do I know I want to be right but I don't want to be fooled listen you're not going to be fooled you're not going to be if you're if you're seeking if you're looking those that hunger and thirst for righteousness shall be filled but he tells you how not to be fooled listen don't be fooled Judas went about as one of the 12 and he did miracles but he did not have the spirit of God as his own he did have a Ministry now here we go how do I know how can I tell but he never got to Pentecost because he wasn't true seed if it's in your heart to go to Pentecost and you're searching and you're looking and you're fighting for that new birth that tells you what you need to know Judas didn't even try to go to The Upper Room Judas didn't try to get to the upper room he knew who he was so it's saying don't be fooled it say if you don't have a desire for Pentecost you got to check up somewhere because Judas didn't go to Pentecost that's what separated him he had a Ministry he did Miracles and it's interesting when you read and Jesus says one of you is going to betray me there wasn't a one of them went Judas they question themselves before they question Judas look you know how it is and this isn't to call anybody a Judas because I I I believe in Mercy and Grace and salvation and people coming back but there's been people fall away that you're like I never thought they would they lived the life outwardly to a tea they were at church they worshiped they praise never had never had a clue what happened brother Aaron how how can that be you got to go to Pentecost you got to get the new birth and if you stop short of that I don't care how far you've come I don't care how much good you've done I do care I want you to do good but I'm just talking about for this illustration if you stop one step short of that new birth you can always go back you can always fall away you can always be caught and trapped and fall in sin again matter of fact in this age you will but if you'll take that other step if you'll go to that upper room if you'll go to the place where all of you dies all of you it's finished work you're sealed to the day of your Redemption H how do I know brother Aaron and and I know you can hear a lot of a lot of things and a lot of preaching on on the evidence and this and that let me tell tell you what you'll know because your desires will change and you'll know because when you run up against that thing that you fall to Time After Time After Time and you run up against it you'll overcome it this time and you'll overcome it again and overcome it again and it'll no longer have power over you but you will have power over it and if you didn't have power before but now you have power where did that power come from it's the Holy Ghost living on the inside of you and I'll tell you something else the Holy Ghost will do so to to put you while we're here this just comes to me because I hear young people say well it's okay if I do this this and this the Holy Ghost would never let me go too far the Holy Ghost would never let me fall now listen the Holy Ghost won't let you put yourself in situations that you could ever fall the fact that you're willing to put yourself in that situation and then say but the Holy Ghost will keep me you need to check up cuz the Holy Ghost won't put you in compromising situations it'll make you look at something and go Christian should not knowingly and willingly put themselves in a place to be tempted yes you'll overcome Temptation yes you'll overcome when you find yourself in those situations but if you see those situations and you walk into that situation anyway you're playing with fire and I'm just going to tell you from experience remember I didn't always live this life the way it was meant to be lived you're playing with fire because somewhere deep deep deep deep deep deep deep down you want it once that gets ripped out of there you see those situations and you run from them you get away from them you put yourself the Holy Ghost leads you into positions to overcome like I said that don't mean you ain't going to find yourself in a trap find yourself in a place but you're never going to go there intentionally you're not going to walk into the prison and go the Holy Ghost is going to get me out you let him Lead You amen you got to go to Pentecost the false Vine hates Pentecost the false Vine hates the new birth but the True Vine the True Vine loves the new birth they love it and they seek it and they want it and because we hunger for it and we thirst for it and we won't be satisfied by churchianity and we won't be satis satisfied just by coming to church then because of those things then we're filled with it then we're born again and we're born of the spirit amen and it doesn't matter if others mock it doesn't matter what others say it it doesn't matter if they mock your worship it doesn't matter if they mock your Holiness it doesn't matter how listen if you're set apart it who cares if you know you hear people they may name some movie stars and somebody's like well I don't know who that is oh how do they not know because they're set apart oh you don't know who that is I'm sorry that some people's focus is on Jesus don't be afraid and ashamed of the mocking that goes on don't be worried about what other what other people says he says I will make them come in worship before thy feet and to know that I've Loved thee those that said oh look at the way they're acting look at the way they worship oh she's just a m goody two shoes and she won't participate in this and one day they will bow at your feet and worship you yes the word says so behold I will make them of the synagogue of Satan which say they are Jews and are not but do lie behold I will make them to come and worship before thy feet and to know here's the most important part that I have loved thee it don't matter who here loves you it don't matter who turns their back on you at the end of the day he says I love you I care I'm going to take you to a place that I prepare listen all hell may be against you tonight but here's a revelation for you I have loved thee that'll get you through any situation that'll get you through any battle any struggle any depression I have loved thee oh I'm glad he's going to let them know one day but tonight he's wanting to let you know he loves you tonight he cares about you tonight you're worth it all tonight you we sing he's worthy of it all and he is but he's looking at you saying you're worth it all you're worth Calvary you're worth wor the beating I took you're worth leaving Heaven you're worth it all tonight hallelujah hallelujah I don't just want to claim this message I don't want to just claim Jesus I don't want to be false and claim to be a part I want to get it on the inside of me I want him to come and take over and let the message live out of me I don't want to have to tell people that's what I believe I want them to be able to look and say I know what he believes there's one that's been to Pentecost I know what he was but I see what he is maybe flawed maybe struggles but I see that something changed a life Hallelujah let that be all of our testimonies tonight let it come and dwell in us and rule the eulogy and the promise verse 10 because thou has kept the word of my patience I also will keep thee from the hour of Temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the Earth patience it's tough word right there especially in this age you know people think they have patience until their patience is tried what is patience it's the ability to accept or tolerate delay trouble or suffering without getting angry or upset to remain calm while waiting I'm going go and tell you we live in a world without patience I feel like if we compare ourselves to people in past past ages even we lack patience think about it five minutes at the drive-thru window out of Ru in your day I'm in a hurry oh yeah five minutes slow internate internet infuriates us listen don't even get me started if you didn't have to grow up with AOL I don't want to [Music] hear hey you got a a website to load in three four minutes man woo you did something took forever ever but today I'm guilty what's wrong with the wifi ain't that right brother Mike I'll text him what's wrong with the Wi-Fi something's wrong slow internet how about this a person driving 55 in a 55 forgive them for obeying the law I'm sorry it make us mad where's the next passing zone order from Amazon and it's not next day delivery what kind of third world nonsense is this you we laugh because we know it hits home we know it's true I'm not going back there I had to wait 30 minutes for my meal 30 minutes I'll never go back I didn't even tip that poor woman trying to feed her kids because I had to wait 30 minutes and despite the fact that things are faster than ever we're harder to please than ever when it comes to time when it comes to speed we're harder to please than ever because we've been conditioned to get it right now I say all those things to make us be cognizant of the fact that that kind of works counter to our faith because that's not how God works God don't do it on your time brother brand just teaches us and he goes through he talks about if God gave you everything the instant you asked for it you would you would become so impatient you I don't remember his exact words but you'd struggle with life you wouldn't be a good person you'd want everything instant satisfaction instant instant that's not how God operates let's look at Hebrews 613 and 15 says for when God made a promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely blessing I Will Bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured endured right there lets us know that it wasn't just like easy it was a trial it was a hardship he had to endure something you if somebody don't if somebody says hey did you have a good time the other night you go oh man yeah I endured it that's not a positive in other words Abraham was going through a hardship and yet he was patient but because he was patient he obtained the promise Abraham had to wait for the Fulfillment but God gave me a promise brother Aaron okay now wait patiently for the ful fulfillment of it but God said I can now wait patiently for the Fulfillment do you believe or do you don't God gave me a promise why hadn't because you're to endure patiently brother Brown says God gives us exceeding great and precious promises he's promised to fulfill them he will I just want that to anchor down right now he's promised to fulfill them he will but brother Aaron he will but I thought he was going he will but my family say he will but I've been praying for he will let that anchor in our hearts tonight he will whatever he's promise you if you patiently endure and hold on to it he will tonight amen God said he will then he will but he wants us to show some patience he wants us to rest in his timing and in his provision not well that shows that you think you know better and you know when and you know you're doubting that it's going to happen he says I got I own a cattle on a thousand Hill my provision is perfect my timing is perfect just show me that you believe just show me that you're willing to hold fast but he said because you were patient and you kept the word I will also keep thee in the hour of Temptation and what this is is it's another case where we see the the word being spoken here to the sixth age but it's the overlapping because this promise to be kept from the hour of Temptation is actually a promise to Believers at the very end of the ages when the tribulation comes in he says this temptation is exactly like the Temptation in Eden in other words it's going to look good it's going to look like the better way he says it'll be a very inviting proposition held up in direct opposition to God's commanded word and what he deals with here is is with the great beast and how the the very small Doctrine that we talked about back in Ephesus the things that seem so simple they started out in the early church they wind up as this monster of Satan that's deceiving the whole world and he talks about how there there's going to be opportunity to lay aside this word there's going to be opportunity to compromise that's going to be the Temptation is your opportunity to compromise your opportunity to give in to the pressures to to to lay aside this standard to to lay aside this part just so the pressure isn't so great just so the persecution isn't so great surely it's not that big a deal if I give up just this little part and to turn to the E communal move and to worship within that system and it's during that time where the pressure is going to be building and when and when the bride's wondering are we going to be able to stand or are we going to be able to make it and he says don't worry in the hour of Temptation because you were patient because you held on you didn't deny my name and you held to the truth I'm going to keep you in the hour of Temptation I promise you a Rapture and right now at the end when the pressure is greatest when the false Vine is at its strongest when the Beast is coming down and you wonder are they going to shut the doors or are they going to close us down or are they going to hunt us or are they going to persecute us brother Bram says she won't be shut up she'll be taken up I mean right here I'm not preparing for a tribulation I'm I'm preparing to avoid the tribulation I'm preparing to go in a Rapture in this day he said I'll keep you from the hour of Temptation yes there'll be pressure yes there's going to be attacks because of what you believe but remember the Rapture comes in a time of trouble it comes in the midst of the pressure it comes in the midst of the attack Psalm 275 it's the text that brother Brandon would read for the Rapture sermon for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me upon a rock I say Lord set us there tonight Lift us out of this old place and take us to that Rock tonight amen the hour of Temptation he says this verse is not a declaration that the true church will go into and through the tribulation because notice it says it says from the hour not during the hour in the hour in other words he Ain saying I I I I'll protect you and and keep you in the hour or Deering now that would imply that we were here and we need but he says I'll save you from the hour in other words you won't have to go through it you're not going to have to see the tribulation we already see pre-tribulation plagues and we see you know influences of it creeping in but I'm telling you when when when Satan is Unleashed on this Earth we're not going to be here I say thank you Jesus I want to get in that Sheepfold tonight I want to be there tonight He says furthermore the elect will not only be kept but as this move becomes the image directed to the Beast the Saints will be gone in the Rapture I say hallelujah tonight I say that's worth it all tonight it doesn't matter what comes it don't matters what torment what ridicule he said he's taken me in a Rapture and I believe him Lord I thought you he will I thought there was going to be a Rapture he will just let that anchor he will tonight amen we have a couple more verses to cover the promise to his own he says behold I come quickly now remember this is for our age you don't have forever you don't have all day you can't put it off you've been saying that for years I'm just going to take one of brother Tim's line he's come for many one day yes he's coming for all but you don't know how quickly if you live out your three scoring 10 it's going to be like that don't put it off hold that fast which thou Hast that no man take thy crown him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God and he shall not he shall go no more out and I will write upon him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God which is New Jerusalem which cometh down out of Heaven from my God and I will write upon him my new name he says here hold fast that no man take that Crown thy Crown think about that it's not just the preacher is going to get a a crown and and and and John Wesley and brother Brown is going to Great CR you're going to get a crown thy Crown he's going to you're royalty you're going to reign with him you're a king with him tonight you're going to be given a crown you're going to Reign you're going to be a king with him I say that's worth holding fast for that's worth fighting for tonight brother and you don't know what I'm going through I know but I know you're going to get a crown I it's hell all around me I I I get it and maybe I don't know exactly how bad it is but I'm telling you hold fast because you're going to get a crown you're going to get the reward amen he says oh we have a word for us all at this time it's hold fast persevere don't give up put on the whole armor of God use every weapon he's given us use every gift at our disposal every gift at our disposal and look ahead with joy because we are going to be crowned by him who is king of kings and Lord of lords I want to put my words with that use every weapon put on the whole armor of God use every gift take advantage of every service take advantage of every moment you have do whatever it takes that no man takes that Crown he's going to put crowns on people's heads and I want you to make a determination I'm going to get one he's not putting my crown on somebody else's head I'm going to be crowned by the King of Kings and the Lord of lords Hallelujah it's G to be worth it all he's going to Crown you and you're going to reign with him listen these things here on Earth pale in comparison quit getting sidetracked by the drama and sidetracked by this one and sidetracked by by this and this and what's going on you're going to rain you're going to receive a Crown of Life quit getting distracted by temporal things and allowing them to have eternal impacts on your decision making to him that overcometh will I make a pillar who is he that overcomes brandom asked this and he talks about John saying he says and the answer comes right back he that believeth that Jesus is the Christ remember that door is open he who is he is the one who is baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ why does this show that they're Overcomers because it shows that they have overcome the false thine it shows they weren't deceived by false religion they have not denied his name and because they have not denied his name they're the Overcomers the whole world today is following a trinitarian religion but he says the Overcomers won't go for that the Overcomers aren't going to fall for that because I've opened a door of Revelation that they're going through tonight the Overcomers have walked through this Open Door what is it again brother it's the revelation of who he is the revelation of his deity the Overcomers have come through that door listen young people there's no other name by which you can be saved there's no other door in which you can Rapture there's no other way to be baptized and he says that name will be written upon the Overcomers that name will identify the Overcomers how awesome is that to be identified by the name of Jesus Christ how are they going to know Jesus Christ is All Over You Jesus Christ identifies who you are I can tell you've been to Pentecost Jesus Christ has been written upon you Hallelujah and as Overcomers he says we are to be made pillars in the temple of God pillars what does that mean a pillar is actually a part this is a quote right here from the church age of the foundation for it holds up the super structure and you don't think you're important you are a pillar that holds all this up now when God puts a man in the temple as a pillar and makes him a part of the foundation group what is he doing he has given him the revelation of the word and of himself because that is exactly what the apostles and the prophets had well well brother I thought that that that Peter and Paul and John and those fellas that they're in the book of Acts I thought they were the pillars they were that's right but now you stand with the same Revelation that they stood with and because you have that same Revelation and you believe that same word and you've receiv received the New Birth the exact same way that they received the new birth you are counted as a pillar in the temple of God just the same as Paul and Peter and John and the rest of them you are a pillar you have the same Revelation as Paul and you're part of the same found the Overcomer stands right there with Paul and with the apostles you are a pillar listen and I'm I'm I'm closing here we're at the very end but so many times young people deal deal with problems with their self-worth and their value and and I'm not worth and and I'm not this and I'm not that you are a pillar in the temple of God my my vocabulary won't even let me begin to articulate how important you are how valuable you are who cares that that you don't value up to the standards of the world who cares about those things you are a pillar in the temple of God you are so important you are so valuable tonight don't let Satan devalue you don't let your imagination and the world devalue you you are incredibly valuable you are incredibly cared for but the world that standard for men and women they're ungodly standards many times they're unattainable standards and a lot of the ones that are attainable aren't standards you want to meet anyway don't value yourself on their value system and if you do reach their standards then you need to check up those aren't standards we want to be reaching because so quit saying I'm not this and I'm not that thank God you're not but I can tell you what you are you're a pillar in the temple of almighty God what a POS position what a Covetous place to be the final admonition to the age he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches brother brandham says oh there are so many voices in the world so many problems and needs crying for attention but there will never be a voice so important and so worth attending as the voice of the spirit so he that hath an ear to hear Let Him hear what the spirit says unto the churches how true a world full of voices voices telling you what's okay and what's not what's right and what's wrong what the standards of Christianity are standards of how dating should go standards of what's respect and what's disrespect listen I want to tell you in my lifetime and i i s to say I hadn't been around that long but I can't say that much longer standards have changed so much it's incredible and so what I want you to understand is in your lifetime according to society standards are going to change drastically so don't come at at people of an older generation and be like well that doesn't matter anymore because that's going to be throwed right back in your face by your children one day that don't matter anymore and the thing is it's always mattered because God is unchanging if he didn't like it then it's still the standard I don't care what Society tells you if he liked it he likes it if he hated it he hates it if it was ungodly it's still ungodly if it was the way then it's the way now there's so many voices and it's so easy to roll along with society and since all of society goes with something then it seems normal but what I want you to remember tonight is the spirit still speaks to those who have an ear I'm so confused there's there's this and there's the spirit speaking you want to end your confusion listen to the spirit speaking quit getting caught up in well this one says they're a Christian and they're not and this one this this ain't about this one and it ain't about this one it's about do you have an ear tonight the spirit speaking to you are you where you need to be is is your life worthy of the Gospel are you inside the Sheepfold do you have an ear to receive what the spirit is saying tonight will you bow your heads together with me Spirit still speaks get in tune with that start living in a spiritual atmosphere listen to what the spirit says standards are going to change they're going to keep changing but the word of God is an anchor and I want to tell you tonight that the anchor holds the anchor is truth and the anchor is unchanging it's the only standard that'll get you out of here there isn't another voice that will bring Salvation and deliverance there isn't another voice that'll take you in a Rapture but that voice speaking tonight the spirit says do you have an ear do you have a heart to receive he that hath an ear let him hear I pray that each and every one will make their decision and go beyond a decision but just make it let an anchor grab hold tonight I'm not going to stay here I'm not going to keep swaying back and forth with with the standards that change and one day this is okay and the next day it's not and today this is wrong but tomorrow it's okay because Society decided listen I want to tell you Society is influenced by the Devil he's in control control but not of this little bride because she has an ear to hear is there anybody here tonight that say Lord I want to get in tune with that spirit I want to get in tune with the spirit that would speak to my heart I want to be in tune so when the spirit speaks I hear it I don't want to be led by by my feelings or by emotions or by my heart I want to be led by the spirit of God father Lord you see every hand you know every heart Lord we have the most wonderful group of young people Lord they love you so much I know you know that Lord and yet I'm not naive Lord I know the struggles that they fight and the battles that they face the hardships that come every single day Lord I know how it was a few years ago when I was in their shoes and yet I know it's exponentially worse now but father you said that those that hunger and thirst after righteousness shall be filled Lord you said that those that had an ear could still hear what the spirit's saying to the churches so Lord I'm asking you right now to to to speak to every heart Lord let them know which side of the door they're on Let It Be a revelation let them know that they know that they know and Lord those that are in hardships and battles Lord may they not Harden themselves to you Lord I know some are drifting and some are struggling and the winds and the waves are tossing to and fro but tonight Lord let the anchor grab hold let the anchor grab that ship here in the midst of the storm Lord maybe they will Lord when they hear that voice to yield to it to respond to it Lord we love you Lord you promised you'd keep us in the hour of Temptation and we see it coming fast it's approaching quick you said in the time of trouble Lord here we are and Lord I'm not speaking tonight in doubt your word is is true your promises are yay and they are amen so you said it I believe it and that settled Lord you said these young people could have the Holy Ghost and I believe it Lord I'm just asking tonight that you'll reveal yourself to them Lord more than daddy said mama said Lord let them know let them hear your spirit speak and know beyond any shadow of a doubt Lord that you've called them you've chosen them you've filled them and you sealed them Lord because we're in the age of the open door and I know very soon we'll step through through it father Lord I commit each every every heart that's gathered here tonight Lord may they come into a deeper walk a greater relationship and Lord may they be protected tonight by that great Shepherd father in Jesus name amen amen thank you Father [Music] amen only you can feel oh aging Tempest only you can steal my soul is thirsty Lord to know you as I'm known drink from the river that flows before your throne take me deeper de deeper in Love with You Jesus hold me close in your Embrace and take me deeper deeper than I've ever been before I just want to love you more and more how I long you be deeper in love sunrise to sunset I will seek your face drawn by the spirit to the promise of your grace my heart is found in you a hope that will abide here in your presence forever satisfied take me deeper deeper in love with you oh Jesus hold me close in your embrace take me deeper deeper than I've ever been before I just want to love you more and more how I long to do deeper in love oh take me deeper take me deeper
