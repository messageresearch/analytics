[49:27] of the lord
[49:28] amen micah 2 and verse 12
[49:31] and uh
[49:33] also second samuel 5
[49:36] and verse 19.
[49:40] i'd like to speak to you tonight how
[49:42] this chapter says i will surely
[49:45] assemble o jacob all of thee i like that
[49:50] he's not he's not interested in leaving
[49:52] a hoof behind
[49:53] he's not interested in making a pact
[49:55] with the devil you take these and i'll
[49:57] take these no all that are mine i'm
[49:59] going to take
[50:01] all of thee and i will surely gather the
[50:04] remnant of israel
[50:06] and i will put them together
[50:08] as the sheep of basra
[50:10] as the flock in the midst of their fold
[50:13] and they shall make great noise
[50:16] by the reason of the multitude of men
[50:19] and the breaker has come up before them
[50:22] they have broken up
[50:24] or in other words they have broken out
[50:26] of what held them and have passed
[50:28] through the gate
[50:30] and are gone out by it
[50:32] and their king shall pass before them
[50:34] and the lord on the head of them
[50:38] also i want to look at a second samuel 5
[50:41] and verse 19. we know this story
[50:44] of david ziglag
[50:46] he said the lord and david inquired of
[50:48] the lord saying shall i go up to the
[50:51] philistines
[50:52] wilt thou deliver them into my hand
[50:55] and the lord said unto david go up
[50:58] for i will doubtlessly deliver the
[51:01] philistines into thy hand i love that i
[51:04] will doubtlessly deliver doubtless
[51:06] deliver the fl plistings in thy hand and
[51:09] david came to bail
[51:11] parism
[51:12] and david smote them there and said the
[51:15] lord hath broken forth upon mine enemies
[51:18] before me
[51:20] as the breach of waters
[51:22] therefore he called the name of that
[51:24] place
[51:25] bel-perezem
[51:27] you know i was just looking back there
[51:29] as we was preparing preparing to come
[51:31] out
[51:32] it means
[51:33] that word bill perism means the lord of
[51:37] the breakthrough
[51:39] the lord of the breakthrough
[51:41] amen we'll let you be seated
[51:48] i'd like to speak to you on the light
[51:51] the breaker
[51:53] the light the breaker the breaker is a
[51:55] word that means to break through to
[51:58] break over to burst to breach to break
[52:02] out to break open to break in pieces to
[52:05] break out violently upon
[52:08] and that's what he's described here in
[52:10] our scripture as the breaker
[52:12] amen is the breaker and i was just
[52:14] thinking of the word breaker you know we
[52:16] use the break of dawn
[52:18] how the light when it breaks over the
[52:21] horizon it actually begins to sends the
[52:23] ray of light out and no matter the
[52:26] darkness or whatever is going on light
[52:28] begins to push back all the darkness and
[52:31] as you know we've been on that for quite
[52:32] some time
[52:34] and and i was just thinking about that
[52:35] though and where we're living amen we
[52:38] know that in the evening time there
[52:40] shall be light again
[52:41] and we see the light that is breaking
[52:43] upon amen the evening time which is a
[52:46] has an evening time people that are
[52:48] receiving the light of the word and and
[52:51] i believe that there is a breakout or a
[52:54] breaking upon that not only is he
[52:57] breaking up the enemies that has held us
[52:59] and the enemies that has tried to keep
[53:01] us from our inheritance amen but he's
[53:04] breaking us out of our our things that
[53:06] we've our traditions or the things that
[53:08] we've held amen for hundreds of years or
[53:11] 50 years or 40 years or five years he's
[53:13] allowing those things to be broken off
[53:15] of us so we can go on with him and i
[53:18] love how the scripture puts it the
[53:20] breaker shall come up before them but
[53:23] not just before them he's also the one
[53:26] who leads the way
[53:27] and i looked at that you know the
[53:29] breaker there's different things that
[53:30] are that it goes to that you know
[53:32] there's a ship that goes into the frozen
[53:34] tundra or the frozen north and the
[53:36] arctic and you can go through just very
[53:39] thick ice and begin to push its way and
[53:42] it begins to break through that ice so
[53:44] that other ships could pass through
[53:46] there
[53:47] and you know what i i think of i think
[53:49] of that as we're not on this battle or
[53:51] on this trail alone but there's already
[53:53] been somebody that has made the way
[53:56] there's already been somebody that has
[53:58] went through the trials that we're
[53:59] facing he's already been somebody that's
[54:02] facing the situations that we're going
[54:04] through even today amen the things in
[54:06] our lives or the situations that we
[54:08] don't know how to handle or we don't
[54:10] know how to get he's there breaking it
[54:12] he's already broken it up he's already
[54:14] handled it he's already got the answer
[54:16] for it and we know we can trust him in
[54:18] this time that we're living in and you
[54:20] know and i i was looking at this thought
[54:22] on david just just very briefly i
[54:24] haven't actually got to really delve
[54:26] into it but just before i came out and
[54:28] he's the lord of the breakthrough amen
[54:31] and he's the god of the breakthrough and
[54:33] so david here is in a very tough
[54:35] situation as we know as he's lost his
[54:38] family and he's lost things and and
[54:40] david you'll follow david's life you'll
[54:42] find this from one battle to another
[54:45] battle it's from one moment to another
[54:47] moment dealing with the enemy amen
[54:49] sounds like a lot like us you go from
[54:51] one moment you get past that and it's
[54:53] another moment again you get past that
[54:55] and you go through another moment amen
[54:57] it's like every enemy is listen we we
[54:59] sing the song god never start in the
[55:01] waymaker miracle worker he never stops
[55:03] working well let me tell you the devil
[55:05] don't ever stop either he's constantly
[55:08] coming against us he's constantly trying
[55:10] to push us back he's constantly trying
[55:12] to make us stop for just a second and
[55:14] doubt our god-given call and position in
[55:17] this life and so he's always there and
[55:19] this was david's life it was constantly
[55:21] from one battle to another battle and i
[55:24] thought i was very well put together
[55:26] here as i was looking at this real quick
[55:28] he was going from one battle to another
[55:30] battle if he would drive the philistines
[55:32] out and he'd face them again somewhere
[55:34] else and later down in the in the
[55:36] scripture it was a valley of referendum
[55:39] which is which means from which i've
[55:42] already been healed from or means i've
[55:45] already dealt with this
[55:47] and so here he is going from one battle
[55:49] to another battle amen but the breaker
[55:52] was there with him every step of the way
[55:55] and we know the stories he inquired amen
[55:57] he went down and he was able to gather
[55:59] back all of his family and all the goods
[56:02] and bring them all back and he brought
[56:04] them back and he said behold my god has
[56:06] come like a flood upon my enemy he's
[56:10] come against him and he has broken them
[56:12] up that i may be able to gather what is
[56:14] rightfully mine and i'm thankful i've
[56:17] served that same god god is not
[56:19] interested in leaving us behind he's not
[56:21] interested in leaving one person behind
[56:23] but he's going to go through the hardest
[56:25] valleys or how what the darkest places
[56:28] wherever he's got a seed he's going to
[56:30] go after them amen and we know that he's
[56:33] going to be there with us and he's going
[56:34] to move that through in possibilities
[56:37] when things look impossible he's going
[56:39] to move through that because he's the
[56:41] breaker he's the battering ram he's the
[56:43] head he's leading this army you're not
[56:45] alone you're not the one in charge he's
[56:47] the one in charge and he's pushing it on
[56:50] through to victory i'm thankful for that
[56:52] we're not pushing to another defeat or
[56:55] another let down we're pushing to a
[56:57] victory and that's what we're looking
[56:59] for and i and i was looking at this
[57:01] thought and i began to think about
[57:03] brother branham would bring out arnold
[57:05] von wrinklerit of switzerland and how he
[57:07] would look at his homeland and how they
[57:09] had been attacked and surrounded by the
[57:11] german armies and things and and they
[57:14] they were there to try to defend their
[57:16] homes and defend their families and and
[57:18] defend their their god-given rights and
[57:20] their god-given privileges and they're
[57:22] looking at a great army that was trained
[57:25] and seemed impossible looked like a
[57:27] brick wall and spears and shields and
[57:29] the top the top-notch helmets and the
[57:31] top-notch shields and everything and all
[57:34] they had was a few sickles and a few
[57:36] holes and a few things that they could
[57:38] get together and it looked like they
[57:40] were going to
[57:42] to face utter defeat it looked like they
[57:44] were very they were helpless they had no
[57:46] answer but there was this young man that
[57:48] said you know he said inspiration struck
[57:51] him and he he began to look at that army
[57:54] and he began to get very angry but he
[57:56] said because because behind him was his
[57:58] sweetheart behind him was his homeland
[58:01] behind him was what god had given him
[58:04] and before him was the enemy that was
[58:06] trying to take that from him amen i
[58:09] believe we ought to get angry at our
[58:10] enemy amen the light of god actually
[58:13] brother madam said he would look there
[58:15] at that red sea out of that light out of
[58:17] that pillar of fire with angry eyes
[58:20] and that red sea would begin to move
[58:22] back and begin he said he said matter of
[58:24] fact it moved back and so fast in such a
[58:27] way and that fire began to burn down
[58:30] through there he said they walked across
[58:32] on dry land he said why they didn't even
[58:34] get their feet muddy
[58:37] ever been in a slop you know an old pond
[58:39] somewhere and step off in it i remember
[58:41] when we used to baptize you would go up
[58:42] to almost your knees and mud you know
[58:44] how long it would take for you to be
[58:46] able to walk across something that's
[58:48] been wet that long and not just get your
[58:50] feet not get your feet wet but not even
[58:52] get mud on there amen the fire of god
[58:54] began to look at the blockage that was
[58:56] before the people of god with angry eyes
[59:00] and begin to look at it and begin to
[59:01] challenge it oh i love it when the holy
[59:04] spirit begins to challenge the devil
[59:06] amen begins to say you don't belong here
[59:09] you're in the you're in my people's way
[59:11] you're in the way to the promised land
[59:13] and you're going to move back and my
[59:14] people's going to cross you
[59:18] hallelujah amen i believe that the
[59:20] pillar of fire tonight is looking
[59:22] through angry eyes and cancer and
[59:25] looking through angry eyes and
[59:27] bitterness and looking through angry
[59:28] eyes of unforgiveness and looking
[59:30] through angry eyes and saying you will
[59:32] not hold my people back you will not
[59:35] hold him back for the promises of god
[59:37] but you're going to let them go through
[59:39] amen you're going to let them go through
[59:41] your victory
[59:43] hallelujah amen you know this man began
[59:46] to look with angry eyes and he got tired
[59:49] of what was before him and and the
[59:51] shouts that was over there and the
[59:52] taunts that was over there and he said
[59:54] look man i just kissed my wife and three
[59:57] children goodbye there's a little home
[59:59] there and they're standing in the door
[1:00:01] watching for me to come home but this
[1:00:03] day i'm going to get my life for
[1:00:05] switzerland
[1:00:07] what are you going to do you just follow
[1:00:09] me and with whatever you got to fight
[1:00:12] you fight with all that's in you
[1:00:15] amen what are you going to do he said he
[1:00:16] threw down what he had in his hand and
[1:00:19] he seen that great army coming he looked
[1:00:21] all over it until he found the very
[1:00:24] thickest of spears
[1:00:26] where there was the greatest garrison
[1:00:28] where it was the worst
[1:00:30] where was the toughest to make it
[1:00:32] through and he began to make his way
[1:00:34] straight for the worst
[1:00:37] and he screamed out make way for liberty
[1:00:39] and he screamed again make way for
[1:00:41] liberty and he ran straight to those
[1:00:44] spears and he gathered them and plunged
[1:00:46] them into his chest and it was such a
[1:00:48] display of
[1:00:50] heroism that it rattled the army and
[1:00:52] those little swiss men with sticks and
[1:00:54] stones and single blades begin to fight
[1:00:57] and begin to fight with everything they
[1:00:59] have and they haven't had a war since
[1:01:02] [Applause]
[1:01:03] amen that that kind of
[1:01:05] heroism is seldom compared with and
[1:01:08] never exceeded switzerland today still
[1:01:10] remembers it what that man did he said
[1:01:12] oh brothers and sisters that was such a
[1:01:15] small thing one day our race was backed
[1:01:18] up against a wall
[1:01:20] or they had prophets they had laws and
[1:01:23] they had killed the prophets and
[1:01:24] destroyed the law and adam's race was
[1:01:26] backed up helpless and hopeless against
[1:01:30] an oncoming
[1:01:31] enemy he said but the devil and all his
[1:01:33] hosts were saying i got him i got him
[1:01:36] but one stepped out of glory
[1:01:40] hallelujah the breaker came down
[1:01:44] and he looked at the worst part
[1:01:47] he looked at hell itself and he said i'm
[1:01:50] going to take it and i'm going to put it
[1:01:51] in my body and i'm going to overcome it
[1:01:54] so the rest of them can overcome
[1:01:56] [Applause]
[1:01:59] hallelujah he said well-trained spirit
[1:02:02] beings these demons of hell mortals
[1:02:05] there was no match for them what could
[1:02:06] they do they were helpless
[1:02:10] but there was one
[1:02:12] who wasn't helpless
[1:02:15] and he stepped out from the glories of
[1:02:17] glory amen and he said i'll go down
[1:02:20] i'll go down and get my life for adam's
[1:02:23] race
[1:02:27] and when he was here on earth
[1:02:29] he found the darkest spot of spears
[1:02:33] it was death
[1:02:35] the darkest place
[1:02:37] and he grabbed an armful of them at
[1:02:40] calvary and plunged them to his death
[1:02:45] and he left the commission with his
[1:02:46] church that little ragged group
[1:02:50] uneducated illiterate
[1:02:52] he never left them with just sticks and
[1:02:54] stones to fight with but he left him
[1:02:56] with the greatest weapon in the church's
[1:02:59] hands it's ever had he said follow me
[1:03:01] and fight with all that's in you he led
[1:03:04] the way
[1:03:07] he led the way you might feel helpless
[1:03:10] tonight you might feel hopeless tonight
[1:03:12] but there's somebody that's already went
[1:03:15] there there's already somebody that
[1:03:18] fought cancer and overcome there's
[1:03:20] already somebody that fought sugar
[1:03:22] diabetes and overcome there's already
[1:03:25] somebody that fought mind battles and
[1:03:27] overcome
[1:03:31] i'm going to tell you something tonight
[1:03:33] i'm looking at something with angry eyes
[1:03:35] there's a devil that's coming and
[1:03:37] attacking one of our young girls in the
[1:03:39] night and coming and taunting her i'm
[1:03:41] sick and tired of that nonsense
[1:03:43] the church of the living god ain't got
[1:03:44] to put up with it
[1:03:46] we got to put up with that torment
[1:03:48] spirit it's already been one they've
[1:03:50] come and conquered it

[1:03:55] that wants to show up to a little girl's
[1:03:57] house and torment her you come to the
[1:04:00] wrong place
[1:04:04] there is a light here that is looking at
[1:04:07] you with angry eyes
[1:04:13] so you take your slimy hairs and you go
[1:04:16] back to hell where you came from
[1:04:25] hallelujah
[1:04:26] we're not putting up with it
[1:04:35] we don't have to put up with it
[1:04:49] when he was on earth
[1:04:51] he conquered
[1:04:54] he was the breaker
[1:04:56] he conquered sicknesses
[1:04:58] he conquered
[1:04:59] blindness

[1:05:03] he conquered deafness he conquered a
[1:05:06] palsy he conquered uh uh mental problems
[1:05:10] he conquered it all
[1:05:13] even just in case i left one out he
[1:05:15] conquered it all
[1:05:17] amen he showed i am the breaker and he
[1:05:19] broke amen he broke blindness he broke
[1:05:22] deafness he broke spirits of torment he
[1:05:24] broke amen that would hold me in and
[1:05:26] hold him down for years and he would
[1:05:28] walk out of a boat across the stormy sea
[1:05:31] and go what was it he was the breaker
[1:05:34] the waves were trying to break him but
[1:05:36] they couldn't conquer him because he was
[1:05:38] the breaker and he would stand there and
[1:05:40] say peace be still because he had a job
[1:05:43] to do there was somebody on the other
[1:05:45] side that were being tormented by
[1:05:47] spirits and tormented by demons of hell
[1:05:50] and tormented by things in their lives
[1:05:52] and he had the word that would set them
[1:05:54] free and he wasn't going to let a few
[1:05:56] waves get in his way he wasn't going to
[1:05:58] let a little trouble get in his way oh
[1:06:00] church of the living god we also have
[1:06:03] the breaker with us and we're not going
[1:06:05] to let a little trouble get in our way

[1:06:09] we're going to go to victory
[1:06:11] we're going to go to complete victory
[1:06:17] do we set every captive free that's
[1:06:19] god's children
[1:06:23] he knew the authority
[1:06:25] man a man when a man lay in the grave he
[1:06:28] conquered death
[1:06:30] sicknesses when maniac came out to
[1:06:32] destroy him the maniac realized he was
[1:06:34] the son of god he said oh if you'll cast
[1:06:36] us out sufferers to go to that bunch of
[1:06:39] hogs for he knew the authority that
[1:06:41] jesus christ had
[1:06:42] he conquered the devil
[1:06:44] everywhere he met him
[1:06:47] hallelujah and he not only conquered in
[1:06:50] himself but he left the commission to
[1:06:52] the church that you ask anything in my
[1:06:55] name and that i'll do fight with what's
[1:06:58] in your hands
[1:07:04] well i'm not a preacher okay let's quote
[1:07:06] if it's singing
[1:07:08] sing the gospel
[1:07:10] if you can't do nothing but whistle
[1:07:14] whistle as loud as you can for the glory
[1:07:16] of god
[1:07:18] hallelujah if you can't do no more than
[1:07:20] patch your hands pat them with all you
[1:07:22] got
[1:07:23] conquer with whatever that's in your
[1:07:25] hands clap them in such a way that all
[1:07:28] the neighbors will love you
[1:07:31] amen
[1:07:32] hallelujah whistle in such a way that
[1:07:35] all the denominations will know that you
[1:07:37] belong to christ conquer them
[1:07:40] we're living in a day where this social
[1:07:42] gospel is becoming predominant when
[1:07:45] churches are uniting themselves together
[1:07:46] making a social religion by it's a
[1:07:48] terrible day that's right to take all
[1:07:50] the deity and all the glory away from
[1:07:52] christ trying to make him just a prophet
[1:07:54] if christ was just a prophet where
[1:07:56] everyone lost
[1:07:59] but he was more than a prophet
[1:08:02] he was god
[1:08:04] amen
[1:08:05] he said that's just the nomination no no
[1:08:07] no that's right here in our ranks
[1:08:12] brother brown would tell that story
[1:08:13] heard it many times about a woman says
[1:08:15] there's one thing i don't like about
[1:08:17] your your meetings you're speaking what
[1:08:18] is it you try to magnify christ too much
[1:08:21] you brag on him too much he tried to
[1:08:23] make him more than what he is i don't
[1:08:25] know if we could ever make him more than
[1:08:27] what he is
[1:08:29] amen if he said if i had 10 000
[1:08:31] languages i would exhaust them and never
[1:08:34] could never explain what he really is
[1:08:37] he's worthy of every praise
[1:08:41] hallelujah she said well mr branham i
[1:08:43] heard you away from the platform that
[1:08:44] your fundamentals according the word yes
[1:08:46] if i explain to you and prove to you by
[1:08:48] the word that he was just a man you try
[1:08:49] to make him deity i said he was deity
[1:08:52] god was in christ reconciling the world
[1:08:55] to himself i said if he's if he's just a
[1:08:58] prophet we're all lost he said i'll
[1:09:00] prove it we'll prove it if the bible
[1:09:01] said that she said well we went down the
[1:09:03] grave of lazarus in saint john the 11th
[1:09:06] chapter of the bible said he wept and if
[1:09:08] he had been deity he could not weep so
[1:09:10] that made him nothing but just an
[1:09:11] ordinary man
[1:09:13] no that made him god
[1:09:15] because he knew where he was bringing
[1:09:16] lazarus from
[1:09:18] and he knew what he was bringing him
[1:09:19] back to again
[1:09:22] come on somebody amen he said sister
[1:09:25] your argument's no good i you failed to
[1:09:27] see you saw the man but you still fail
[1:09:30] to see god in the man it's the truth
[1:09:32] when he went down to the grave of
[1:09:33] lazarus he was weeping like a man but
[1:09:35] when he pulled those little shoulders
[1:09:37] back
[1:09:41] devil you seen him before when he pulled
[1:09:44] those little shoulders back
[1:09:46] and he said lazarus come forth
[1:09:50] he said that was more than a man
[1:09:54] hallelujah
[1:09:55] hallelujah and he's pulling them little

[1:14:04] but on easter morning
[1:14:06] [Applause]
[1:14:08] when the seal of the roman government
[1:14:09] was put over there and they tried to

[1:14:27] it could have still been sealed the
[1:14:29] roman army could have never known
[1:14:30] nothing about it but he broke out of
[1:14:32] there and he rolled that stone away so
[1:14:34] you would know he came out
[1:14:38] hallelujah amen he broke it and he
[1:14:41] protested to the side amen and he said
[1:14:44] and when they when the children because

[1:14:52] hold him in a turn they were now sitting
[1:14:55] on it what happened the breaker came
[1:14:57] and it cast that old thing away and now

[1:15:29] mighty conqueror
[1:15:30] he said oh how we should love him
[1:15:32] tonight how we should praise him
[1:15:35] how should we should love one another as
[1:15:37] he loved us and gave himself for us that
[1:15:40] we might be more than conquerors
[1:15:43] through him who conquered sickness death
[1:15:47] and hell

[1:15:50] a conqueror

[1:16:02] she didn't have to fight a lick
[1:16:04] she didn't have to take a punch
[1:16:07] she didn't have to go down to death
[1:16:11] come on now she didn't have to go down
[1:16:14] to hell
[1:16:15] she didn't have to do none of that he
[1:16:17] came back and said here it's yours i
[1:16:19] give you the keys
[1:16:20] you don't even have to go down there you
[1:16:22] don't even have to experience what's
[1:16:24] down there i already experienced it for
[1:16:26] you
[1:16:27] so you're not just a conqueror you're
[1:16:29] more than the conqueror because you
[1:16:31] don't have to go to hell you don't have
[1:16:33] to go down to death amen death and hell
[1:16:36] you have the keys to it it's been given
[1:16:39] to you and you have authority over it

[1:16:46] authority over death
[1:16:50] did we not just say that death was the
[1:16:52] darkest spot he took yes
[1:16:56] well then if you got the authority over
[1:16:58] death it's the strongest most powerful
[1:17:01] amen the
[1:17:02] the worst part and you got it
[1:17:06] it's under your feet
[1:17:09] so under death is cancer
[1:17:13] sugar diabetes any kind of sickness any
[1:17:16] kind of sin any kind of thing it's all
[1:17:18] stacked up underneath him
[1:17:21] amen what was that when the breaker came
[1:17:24] and he and he brought those five kings
[1:17:26] out and he sat there and he laid them
[1:17:28] all out and he put them they said you
[1:17:30] come put your foot on their neck and
[1:17:31] they all came and they put their foot on
[1:17:33] what was they doing they were showing i
[1:17:35] got the king but also got his kingdom
[1:17:40] i have authority over the king and i
[1:17:42] also have authority over his kingdom
[1:17:46] do you realize when the devil lost at
[1:17:48] calvary he does not even have authority
[1:17:51] at his own house
[1:17:52] [Applause]
[1:17:55] he can only go as far as the pillar of
[1:17:57] fire let him go
[1:18:03] there's something called a breaker in
[1:18:04] your house
[1:18:06] some of you have to look for it
[1:18:08] because all of a sudden you'll be
[1:18:09] cooking some popcorn pop
[1:18:13] something wrong with this dumb thing
[1:18:16] you realize oh the electricity's been
[1:18:18] cut off let me go find the issue and you
[1:18:20] go searching for your breaker box
[1:18:23] how many knows you got to break your box
[1:18:24] okay good and there you know there's
[1:18:26] breakers in the breaker box okay good
[1:18:28] and you go and you open it up and you
[1:18:30] say no no
[1:18:31] there it is and you flip it back over
[1:18:33] and electricity comes in a breaker is
[1:18:35] something that cuts the current off
[1:18:39] it makes it where it can't go no further
[1:18:42] it can only go so far
[1:18:44] and when amen when it's time for it to
[1:18:46] to be broke and you can go in there
[1:18:48] yourself you may need to work on a
[1:18:49] certain outlet or certain sometimes you
[1:18:51] got to flip off every switch till you
[1:18:53] find it but if you got them you've done
[1:18:54] the right thing and you marked them
[1:18:56] you're going to say well this is the one
[1:18:57] i'm working on pop and you go check it
[1:18:58] yep it's off and you go work on it
[1:19:01] but if you ever turn the wrong one off
[1:19:04] you'll know it right
[1:19:05] but there's a breaker there and it is
[1:19:07] not it's only allowing the electricity
[1:19:09] to run through it but once the flip the
[1:19:11] switches flip it can't go there no more
[1:19:15] and this is the breaker amen he's
[1:19:17] allowing the devil to do certain things
[1:19:20] and allowing him to go certain places
[1:19:22] but there comes a point that he just
[1:19:24] switches it off and he can't go no
[1:19:26] further
[1:19:27] he lost his power he don't have power to
[1:19:30] do anymore he can scream he can holler
[1:19:33] he can do all he can throw a fit he can
[1:19:35] throw a five five-year-old hissy fear it
[1:19:38] doesn't matter he don't have power to go
[1:19:41] any further
[1:19:43] this is what he told you when he came up
[1:19:44] to job he said well he serves you
[1:19:46] because you got a wall built around him
[1:19:48] he said well i'll tell you what i'll
[1:19:49] take the wall down he said but you do
[1:19:51] anything but take his life
[1:19:54] there was a breaker put there
[1:19:56] he said you can only go so far and you
[1:19:59] won't go any further
[1:20:02] did you hear me devil you can only go so
[1:20:05] far
[1:20:06] and you can't go no further because
[1:20:08] there's a breaker that's been placed
[1:20:10] upon you from calvary
[1:20:16] the sickness he never preached a funeral
[1:20:18] death couldn't stay in his presence
[1:20:21] and it still can't how could death and
[1:20:23] life live together they can't do it
[1:20:26] that's the reason today when the church
[1:20:27] is born of the spirit of the living god
[1:20:29] death and life can't hold together
[1:20:31] something takes place and christ comes
[1:20:33] in and it conquers our passions
[1:20:36] conquers our desires conquers everything
[1:20:39] ungodly about us because he lives we can
[1:20:42] live also he conquers everything already
[1:20:44] dead and it's laying in our hands just
[1:20:46] to receive it we see him on this earthly
[1:20:48] ministry as a conqueror certainly we do
[1:20:51] but now let's watch him after he died he
[1:20:53] still went on concrete it never ended in
[1:20:55] the grave his soul descended into hell
[1:20:57] and he preached in the spirits that were
[1:20:59] in prison souls that were in prison and
[1:21:01] it repented not in the long suffering
[1:21:02] days of noah i can see him as the
[1:21:04] heavens and earth turned black and rocks
[1:21:06] and belched upon the mountains whole
[1:21:08] heavens the moon and stars refused to
[1:21:10] sign shine he conquered it he went down
[1:21:13] there to where they were at where the
[1:21:15] people made fun of enoch and they made
[1:21:17] fun of noah and they laughed
[1:21:20] but they knew now
[1:21:22] the conquerors here
[1:21:24] the breakers here
[1:21:26] the devil
[1:21:28] he says i'll see him go past all of them
[1:21:33] i love how he puts
[1:21:34] and he knocked on the devil
[1:21:38] doors of the devil's hell
[1:21:40] the doors
[1:21:42] of the devil's hell
[1:21:45] and the devil comes to this door
[1:21:47] and we can see him
[1:21:49] as he looks
[1:21:51] here you are
[1:21:52] after all
[1:21:54] i sure thought i had you
[1:21:56] when i killed those prophets down
[1:21:58] through those ages
[1:22:00] i sure thought i had you
[1:22:02] when i had cut john's head off in prison
[1:22:04] but now after all you're here
[1:22:08] stupid deal
[1:22:13] all of a sudden he said i can hear him
[1:22:15] as he begin to speak
[1:22:17] he straightens his shoulders back
[1:22:21] must be a sure sign of something
[1:22:24] shoulders come back
[1:22:27] satan
[1:22:28] i'm the virgin born son of the living
[1:22:30] god
[1:22:31] my blood is still wet on the cross
[1:22:34] i paid the price i've come i have come
[1:22:37] down i have conquered and i've come to
[1:22:40] take over
[1:22:41] i've come to strip you of everything you
[1:22:44] ever claimed you had
[1:22:45] and it reached over on his side satan's
[1:22:48] side and he jerked the keys of death and
[1:22:50] hell off with him and he kicked him back
[1:22:52] into hell where he belonged and he liked
[1:22:54] to shook the hinges off the door when he
[1:22:56] slammed it in his face
[1:22:58] oh hallelujah he now put him on his side
[1:23:02] he said what's the church scared about
[1:23:04] tonight we don't have a reason to be
[1:23:06] scared he conquered satan he conquered
[1:23:09] sickness he conquered death he conquered
[1:23:12] hell
[1:23:15] and remember there was some more that
[1:23:17] went with him
[1:23:19] he passed by paradise and all of a
[1:23:22] sudden the doors come open and say and
[1:23:24] abraham said hey that's the one that
[1:23:26] made us under that oak tree
[1:23:28] there he is amen there's a mid-wheel in
[1:23:31] the middle of the wheel daniel said
[1:23:33] there's the one who was with me in the
[1:23:34] lion's den three hebrew children said
[1:23:36] yep i've been telling you boys that's
[1:23:39] the one that met me in the fire
[1:23:41] he was there when i was about to die he
[1:23:44] was there when my last hope but here he
[1:23:46] is now what we doing lord what's the
[1:23:49] next command come on with me

[1:23:55] we're going to make a little whistle
[1:23:56] stop
[1:23:59] hallelujah and he made a little whistle
[1:24:01] stop and they began to appear among many
[1:24:04] until they was beginning to be
[1:24:05] recognized
[1:24:12] i pray he makes a real whistle stop here
[1:24:14] tonight
[1:24:20] on that four o'clock sunday morning
[1:24:22] he stepped out of the grave
[1:24:29] more than a conqueror
[1:24:31] conquered
[1:24:36] as he was speaking in his last moments
[1:24:39] he was had so conquered everything
[1:24:41] around him that gravitation began to be
[1:24:44] conquered
[1:24:46] and light began to come under his feet
[1:24:49] and hundreds of brethren watching as he
[1:24:51] begins to move up ascending
[1:24:53] him in the old testament saints going
[1:24:55] into glory
[1:24:57] and they just moved right into the air
[1:24:59] all of a sudden old testament saints
[1:25:02] came inside of that beautiful city
[1:25:05] and they screamed out with one great
[1:25:07] blast that shook to heaven lift up you
[1:25:09] everlasting gates

[1:26:25] behold him in plain view for he's the
[1:26:28] mighty conqueror since he rent the veil
[1:26:30] into it used to be a problem to go
[1:26:33] beyond the veil now it's a problem not
[1:26:36] to go beyond the veil
[1:26:38] because the breaker came they couldn't
[1:26:39] go there only the high priest could go
[1:26:41] there and they could only one go once a
[1:26:43] year into the holy of holies but now
[1:26:46] because the breaker has come you have
[1:26:48] the right
[1:26:49] every moment of your life to go into the
[1:26:52] holy of holies
[1:26:54] the breaker has made the way
[1:27:00] he
[1:27:01] said every angel
[1:27:03] every archangel of hell ever
[1:27:05] principality ever power he tore down and
[1:27:08] spoiled
[1:27:09] at his crucifixion and resurrection
[1:27:11] everything satan had he broke through
[1:27:14] the veil of sin he tore it apart and
[1:27:16] he's the high priest's blood of his own
[1:27:18] body he came to the next what was it
[1:27:20] there was a veil of sickness that held
[1:27:21] over the people and he tore it apart he
[1:27:24] was wounded for our transgression and by
[1:27:26] his stripes were healed he went to the
[1:27:28] great veil yonder of sickness the great
[1:27:30] bell of sin and he went through the
[1:27:32] great veil of worry he went through the
[1:27:33] great veil of fear he tore every one of
[1:27:36] them down he's the breaker and he
[1:27:38] ascended so high and he received a name
[1:27:41] above every name that's named in the
[1:27:43] heavens above or the earth below and the
[1:27:45] world to come god taking that lovely one
[1:27:48] who stooped down solo but he took our
[1:27:50] place
[1:27:53] so we didn't have to break it
[1:27:56] and so it wouldn't break us
[1:28:00] he sits today the mighty conqueror
[1:28:03] he would come down in luke chapter 4 and
[1:28:05] verse 18. and he'd say the spirit of the
[1:28:08] lord is upon me
[1:28:11] amen you better not do anything without
[1:28:12] the spirit of the lord
[1:28:16] you need his spirit
[1:28:19] it's the anointing that breaks the yoke
[1:28:22] the spirit of the lord is upon me
[1:28:24] because he hath anointed me to preach
[1:28:27] the gospel to the poor he has sent me to
[1:28:29] heal the brokenhearted to preach
[1:28:32] deliverance to the captives to the
[1:28:33] recovering of the sight of the blind to
[1:28:36] set at liberty them that are bruised to
[1:28:38] preach the acceptable year or the year
[1:28:41] of jubilee
[1:28:42] the acceptable year of the lord amen
[1:28:45] that is so what is it don't don't keep
[1:28:47] pushing that off to another time this
[1:28:49] hour that we're living in is our hour
[1:28:53] it's our time it's our moment it's our
[1:28:56] year of jubilee
[1:29:00] so therefore we cannot sit still and let
[1:29:03] the devil put clamps on our worship
[1:29:06] put clamps on what we believe or put
[1:29:09] chains of circumstances upon it we can't
[1:29:12] allow that to happen it's already been
[1:29:14] broken
[1:29:15] [Applause]
[1:29:18] psalms 107 13 said they cried unto the
[1:29:21] lord in their trouble and he saved them
[1:29:23] out of their distresses he brought them
[1:29:25] out of darkness in the shadow of death
[1:29:27] and what
[1:29:29] break
[1:29:30] their bands in sunder
[1:29:34] oh that man would praise the lord for
[1:29:36] his goodness
[1:29:37] and for his wonderful works to the
[1:29:39] children of men for he has broken the
[1:29:42] gates of brass
[1:29:44] and cut the bars of iron in sunder
[1:29:50] this is what we we heard you know
[1:29:52] brother branham talk about the the bars
[1:29:54] that held people and they were held
[1:29:56] behind bars and brother branham helped
[1:29:58] me and he said i don't have no strength
[1:29:59] to do nothing about them bars i can't
[1:30:01] break them i can't open it up i don't
[1:30:03] know what to do and they said help us
[1:30:05] please help us
[1:30:07] and he said i i he said all of a sudden
[1:30:09] he saw a great light
[1:30:12] and it began to begin to save in house
[1:30:14] of hell give way to the name of jesus
[1:30:17] and he said when he spoke those words
[1:30:19] that bar began to break what was it it
[1:30:22] was the breaker
[1:30:25] brother branham couldn't deliver this
[1:30:26] message on his own he couldn't deliver
[1:30:28] the people of god for an exodus no law
[1:30:31] no more than moses could with a rod and
[1:30:33] a donkey he was ill-equipped but he had
[1:30:35] the light
[1:30:38] and the light was going before him moses
[1:30:40] didn't go there by himself to egypt the
[1:30:42] light was already there
[1:30:45] william branham didn't come to laodicea
[1:30:47] by himself the light was already here
[1:30:51] and it was breaking and it was breaking
[1:30:53] upon the people that you don't have to
[1:30:55] sit where you are you don't have to be
[1:30:57] bound by drugs and alcohol and spirits
[1:31:00] of hell you can be free
[1:31:03] this is a year of jubilee
[1:31:15] this may turn take just a bit of a left
[1:31:17] turn but bear with me
[1:31:19] matthew 21 and verse 12
[1:31:22] look at the breaker
[1:31:26] jesus went into the temple of
[1:31:28] god and he cast out all them that was
[1:31:31] sold
[1:31:33] and bought in the temple
[1:31:35] and overthrew the tables of money
[1:31:37] changers
[1:31:38] and the seats of them that sold doves
[1:31:41] and he said unto them it is written
[1:31:43] my house shall be called the house of
[1:31:46] prayer but ye have made it a den of
[1:31:48] thieves
[1:31:50] the next verse
[1:31:52] and the blind
[1:31:55] and the lame came to him in the temple
[1:31:59] what did it have to be it had to be a
[1:32:01] breakthrough take place
[1:32:02] these people had set with traditions
[1:32:04] after year after year after year and
[1:32:06] they'd put clamps upon their worship
[1:32:08] they'd put clamps and you had to do so
[1:32:10] much to do this pay pennies buy this do
[1:32:12] that and they'd put it all there and god
[1:32:14] said your offerings are as a stench
[1:32:19] i didn't want an offering that you
[1:32:20] bought somebody else raised and you they
[1:32:23] went through all the sacrifice i wanted
[1:32:25] you to come and present a sacrifice
[1:32:28] i wanted you to lay it on the altar and
[1:32:31] it'd be something that meant something
[1:32:33] to you but you was giving it to me
[1:32:37] but they turned the house of worship
[1:32:39] amen into nothing but a tradition it was
[1:32:41] just a good service on sunday and we'll
[1:32:43] have another one on wednesday and we're
[1:32:45] going to do this and we're going to sing
[1:32:46] so many songs and we're going to have a
[1:32:48] prayer and we're going to sing so many
[1:32:49] songs we're going to have this we're
[1:32:51] going to do that and there's no room for
[1:32:52] the spirit of god to move in the house
[1:32:54] of god and it's all been clamped down
[1:32:56] somebody gets to shouting and singing
[1:32:58] people online are making fun and they're
[1:33:00] making jokes and caring all what is it
[1:33:03] they're trying to put clamps on the
[1:33:04] worship
[1:33:08] but the breaker came through
[1:33:10] he said let's clean all of this out so
[1:33:12] we can have some church
[1:33:16] so that's what he's doing tonight he
[1:33:18] said let's go ahead and let's clean out
[1:33:20] all the bitterness tonight let's clean
[1:33:23] out all the unforgiveness tonight let's
[1:33:25] clean all out the old hard feelings
[1:33:27] tonight let's clean out all the things
[1:33:29] that we've been holding on for hundreds
[1:33:31] of years traditions of men let's just
[1:33:34] clean them all out
[1:33:36] and if he has to he'll braid a will
[1:33:41] whatever he's got to do to clean it out
[1:33:43] he's going to thoroughly purge his floor
[1:33:47] why because he wants to be worshipped
[1:33:50] he wants to be praised he wants to be
[1:33:52] adored he wants everything you got
[1:33:57] he wants a sacrifice of praise
[1:34:00] not a tradition not just well i'm here
[1:34:03] tonight i'm just going to pay my due no
[1:34:05] i'm here for one thing
[1:34:08] god saved me
[1:34:09] god healed me god delivered me god's
[1:34:12] done so much for me god's done so much
[1:34:15] for me i can't but help tell it all i
[1:34:18] can't help but praise him i can't help
[1:34:21] but worship him oh
[1:34:23] let the breaker come through tonight
[1:34:29] hallelujah let him break those hard
[1:34:31] feelings let him break those complexes
[1:34:34] let him break those fears let him break
[1:34:36] it all off of you
[1:34:38] then the lame can be healed and the
[1:34:41] blind can be healed and cancer be driven
[1:34:44] out
[1:34:45] let the breaker come through
[1:34:49] i don't care if it breaks me into pieces
[1:34:51] i want to be broken and laid upon his
[1:34:54] altar
[1:35:00] hallelujah can you stay standing
[1:35:03] and when the chief priests and the
[1:35:04] scribes saw the wonderful things that he
[1:35:06] did and the children crying in the
[1:35:09] temple
[1:35:12] saying hosanna to the son of david
[1:35:16] worshipping him and giving him glory
[1:35:19] that he was due
[1:35:20] this was what he was desiring
[1:35:24] not a forced worship
[1:35:27] something coming from the heart
[1:35:30] how long has it been since your heart
[1:35:32] worshipped
[1:35:34] and you allowed yourself to just let go
[1:35:36] and let god have his way
[1:35:40] he said what are you trying to get us to
[1:35:41] dance no i'm trying to let you get you
[1:35:43] to let go
[1:35:44] i don't care if you sit in your seat and
[1:35:46] you squall like a baby or whatever
[1:35:48] happens to you it does not matter as
[1:35:50] long as you let go and let god have his
[1:35:53] way that's all that matters amen amen so
[1:35:57] the breaker can come through and he can
[1:35:59] heal and he can deliver and he can set
[1:36:02] free
[1:36:03] and then you can begin to scream hosanna
[1:36:06] to the son of david
[1:36:09] but they were so displeased
[1:36:13] and he said unto them hears
[1:36:15] thou what they say
[1:36:17] and they said unto him here you hear
[1:36:19] what they're saying to you
[1:36:21] he says
