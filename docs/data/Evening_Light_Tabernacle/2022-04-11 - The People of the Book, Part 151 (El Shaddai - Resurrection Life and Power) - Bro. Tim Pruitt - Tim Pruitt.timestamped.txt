[47:22] genesis 17 and 1 and when abram was 90
[47:26] years old and nine the lord appeared to
[47:29] abram and said unto him i am the
[47:31] almighty god that's el shaddai
[47:34] walk before me and be thou perfect and i
[47:37] will make that covenant between me
[47:40] and thee and will multiply thee
[47:42] exceedingly and abram fell on his face
[47:45] and god talked with him
[47:47] saying
[47:48] you can be seated now
[47:52] we
[47:54] as i look at
[47:55] things in this time and this hour that
[47:58] we're living in and
[48:00] some of the climate and the atmospheres
[48:03] around us
[48:04] i find it amazing sometimes how some can
[48:08] constantly criticize
[48:10] how god moves on others
[48:13] and sometimes to the point of blasphemy
[48:16] in the message respect brother branham
[48:18] cautioned us he said when we receive the
[48:20] holy ghost
[48:22] it is not shaking hands with the pastor
[48:24] receiving the holy ghost is receiving
[48:27] christ into you
[48:29] because he's god's messenger
[48:32] of the day
[48:33] the holy ghost is god's messenger
[48:36] and we must respect him
[48:39] when he comes don't say he he look at
[48:42] that woman shouting there and crying and
[48:45] tears running down her cheeks look at
[48:46] that man shaking his hands and trembling
[48:49] and crying you know what that is that's
[48:51] a bunch of worked up emotion you are
[48:54] blaspheming the holy ghost
[48:56] you've got to respect that
[48:59] now you know if you noticed in here when
[49:02] we read the scripture and i'm going to
[49:04] deal with this just for a moment
[49:06] but the bible said and abram fell on his
[49:09] face and god talked with him
[49:12] you know there are instances in the
[49:14] bible were actually demons through
[49:18] a boy to the ground and oftentimes would
[49:21] throw him into the fire
[49:23] and and and of course
[49:26] what what is called today fallen out in
[49:28] the spirit which is
[49:30] been a phenomena actually since um
[49:33] um sanctification in the methodist era
[49:37] um you know and
[49:39] it's become impersonated until it's
[49:42] become a sham or a charade among the
[49:45] pentecostals and some charismatics
[49:49] but someone who just classified all is
[49:51] of the devil
[49:53] but there's many instances of the bible
[49:55] of the presence of god coming upon a
[49:57] person
[49:58] and then falling in god's presence so
[50:01] overwhelmed
[50:02] by the powerful presence of the almighty
[50:06] you know what we we think about this and
[50:10] you know let me just interview moses for
[50:12] a moment moses
[50:13] well what about you he said well when me
[50:15] and aaron entered the tent of meeting
[50:18] and when they cut and we came out and we
[50:21] blessed the people the glory of the lord
[50:24] appeared to all the people and the fire
[50:27] came out from the presence of the lord
[50:29] and actually consumed the burnt offering
[50:32] in the fat portions of the altar and
[50:34] when everybody saw it they shouted for
[50:36] joy and they fell face downward what
[50:40] about you joshua what happened when you
[50:43] saw the captain of the army of the lord
[50:46] with the sword drawn
[50:48] and he said well i tell you when i saw
[50:51] him i fell on my face and i worshiped
[50:53] him
[50:54] and what about humanoid when the angel
[50:57] lord told you about your son samson and
[51:00] how he would be born he said yeah we
[51:03] offered a kid a goat kid with a meat
[51:06] offering and we offered it up on a rock
[51:09] and the angel of the lord did wondrously
[51:12] and a flame of fire went up toward
[51:14] heaven
[51:15] and the angel lord went up in that flame
[51:17] and my wife and i we fell on our faces
[51:21] well solomon what about the priests when
[51:23] the glory of the lord filled the temple
[51:26] well you know he said
[51:28] solomon said well i was praying the
[51:30] prayer of dedication and when i finished
[51:33] praying the fire came down from heaven
[51:35] and it consumed the burnt offering and
[51:38] the sacrifices and the glory of the lord
[51:41] filled the temple
[51:42] so that the priest could not stand the
[51:45] minister because of the cloud for the
[51:47] glory of the lord filled the house of
[51:51] god
[51:52] let me just say to this we know when you
[51:54] know that was the old testament temple
[51:57] how much greater is it
[51:59] when the holy ghost comes
[52:01] and he fills the temple of the
[52:04] individual and they feel that that's the
[52:07] temple he wanted it was never a building
[52:09] of stones and precious jewels it was
[52:12] sons and daughters of god what about it
[52:15] when the power of god comes down in our
[52:17] life and transforms it and moves by the
[52:21] holy spirit
[52:23] don't you think that would be rather
[52:25] dynamic too
[52:28] what about you daniel well he said you
[52:30] know i was speaking i was i was there on
[52:33] the
[52:34] uh on the banks of uh
[52:36] and um i heard a man's voice it said
[52:39] gabriel
[52:40] say make this man to understand the
[52:42] vision and gabriel came near me and i
[52:45] was afraid and i fell on my face but he
[52:48] said to me understandable son of man for
[52:50] at the end time shall be division and as
[52:53] he was speaking to me i went into a deep
[52:56] sleep on my face on the with on my face
[52:58] on the ground but he touched me and he
[53:00] set me up right but let me tell you
[53:03] another time another time i was standing
[53:06] on the bank of the tigris and i looked
[53:09] and there was a man that was dressed in
[53:11] linen he had a belt of fine gold of eu
[53:15] flies upon around his waist and his body
[53:18] was like topaz kind of a yellowish green
[53:22] and his face was like lightning and his
[53:26] eyes was like flaming torches and his
[53:29] arms and legs like the gleam of
[53:31] burnished bronze and his voice like the
[53:34] sound of a multitude
[53:36] and he said i was the only one that saw
[53:39] the vision the rest around me didn't see
[53:41] me but such terror fell upon the rest of
[53:44] them it overwhelmed them and they fled
[53:46] and they hid themselves but me i was
[53:49] left alone i was gazing at this great
[53:52] vision and i had no strength left and my
[53:55] face turned deathly pale and i was
[53:58] helpless and i heard him speaking and as
[54:01] i listened to him i fell into a deep
[54:03] sleep my face to the ground
[54:07] these are pretty awesome
[54:10] experiences
[54:12] with the almighty
[54:14] what about you ezekiel
[54:16] well i saw him like the appearance of a
[54:18] bow
[54:19] that is in the cloud in the day of rain
[54:22] it was uh the appearance of brightness
[54:24] all around such appearance as the
[54:27] likeness of the glory of the lord and
[54:29] when i saw it i fell on my face and i
[54:32] heard the voice of one speaking
[54:36] well all of that's old testament
[54:39] well when peter james and john saw moses
[54:41] and elijah and jesus glorified and heard
[54:44] a voice from heaven declaring that jesus
[54:46] was his beloved son saying here you him
[54:49] they fell on their face
[54:52] what about you paul well i was on the
[54:54] road to damascus it wasn't really a
[54:56] spiritual time for me i was going along
[54:59] i was threatening to kill everybody that
[55:01] believed in the name of jesus
[55:03] and as i was riding along on my horse
[55:06] said
[55:07] i there was suddenly a light from heaven
[55:10] flashed around me and fallen to the
[55:12] ground i heard a voice saying saul saul
[55:15] why are you persecuting me and i said
[55:18] who are you lord and he said i am jesus
[55:21] whom you're persecuting
[55:24] well what about you john
[55:27] did you have an experience that you
[55:28] could talk about
[55:30] yeah i heard the voice of one
[55:33] there and i turned to look and see and i
[55:35] i saw seven golden candlesticks
[55:38] and these lampstands standing in the
[55:41] middle of those lampstands was one like
[55:43] the son of man he was clothed with a
[55:46] long robe and a golden sash around his
[55:49] chest and his hairs of his head they
[55:51] were white like wool watched snow and
[55:54] his eyes was like a flame of fire his
[55:57] feet was like burnished bronze and and
[56:00] refined in the furnace and i and his
[56:02] voice was like the sound of many waters
[56:05] and in his right hand there was seven
[56:08] stars and from his mouth came a sharp
[56:11] two-edged sword and his face was like
[56:14] the sun shining in full strength and
[56:17] when i saw him i fell at his feet as
[56:20] dead
[56:21] and he laid his right hand on me
[56:23] and he said these words fear not
[56:28] i am the first and the last
[56:31] i am the living one
[56:33] i've died but behold i am alive
[56:35] forevermore and i've got the keys of
[56:38] death and of health
[56:41] now let me just tell you brother branham
[56:43] often spoke of this happening in their
[56:45] wesleyan revival where men were so
[56:47] overwhelmed
[56:49] by their need of god
[56:51] and and they they fell sometimes
[56:54] senseless to the ground and they would
[56:57] throw water upon them to revive them and
[57:00] he never condemned it he always said it
[57:02] was of god
[57:03] and i just want to say what's wrong with
[57:05] having an experience that is so profound
[57:09] and so real that you fall at his feet is
[57:12] dead
[57:13] what is wrong with having an experience
[57:16] that you can feel that you can
[57:18] that you can know that you can walk away
[57:21] say i know i met him i no it was not an
[57:24] illusion it was not an imagination it
[57:27] was real
[57:28] [Applause]
[57:35] well
[57:37] someone say i
[57:38] i know someone had experience like that
[57:40] and was never converted and became
[57:43] ranked center yep
[57:45] that's true i know some who just
[57:47] accepted the message and claimed the
[57:48] holy ghost and became rank sinners too
[57:59] no
[58:00] emotion is not the holy ghost
[58:04] but the holy ghost does what make one
[58:06] emotional
[58:09] we often fear becoming like a
[58:11] pentecostal
[58:12] and instead we become a formal baptiser
[58:15] presbyterian
[58:18] or episcopalian
[58:22] and so as we would see jesus brother
[58:24] branham said philip after he was
[58:26] converted
[58:27] he was all in twos and any man when he
[58:29] finds jesus and gets saved there's an
[58:32] enthusiasm
[58:34] oh i wish i could give that to men like
[58:37] jack shuler
[58:38] and billy graham both of them he said at
[58:41] times that they were messengers to sodom
[58:44] and those those who great evangelists
[58:47] who god is using and the people who
[58:50] profess to come are too starchy he was
[58:54] seeing them come to the altar too
[58:56] starchy
[58:58] they just seem to say yes well i believe
[59:01] and what is that it is an intellectual
[59:03] conception but that won't work you've
[59:06] got to be born again
[59:08] and when you're born there's an
[59:10] enthusiasm
[59:12] rises with that birth and sets the soul
[59:15] of fire and takes all the differences
[59:18] away in isms and comes straight to
[59:20] calvary
[59:21] recognizes christ with a burning love
[59:24] and seal for the lost and fallen
[59:30] world new birth is
[59:33] an experience
[59:35] this was an experience that abraham was
[59:38] having it types the holy ghost
[59:42] you watched brother branham in all of
[59:44] his ministry he said this is abraham
[59:47] living out chipping the coming of the
[59:50] holy ghost what it does
[59:53] now we've been told through abraham's
[59:55] journey
[59:56] that he walked with god that's the
[59:58] progression we saw him like a heathen
[1:00:01] you know like the rest of the world but
[1:00:03] called out by god and began to walk with
[1:00:06] him and that was justification in that
[1:00:09] divine call
[1:00:11] later we saw him where he come to the
[1:00:13] altar and was sanctified by the blood
[1:00:16] and and here at 99 you would think the
[1:00:19] journey is now complete it's all over
[1:00:22] with he's too old it's he's beyond
[1:00:25] anything else
[1:00:27] there's no more progression there's no
[1:00:29] more furtherness of it
[1:00:31] but now he is just now about to fulfill
[1:00:35] his real purpose
[1:00:37] and here god reveals himself as almighty
[1:00:40] god el shaddai
[1:00:43] and so in genesis 17 1 we saw when he
[1:00:47] was abram was 99 years old the lord
[1:00:52] appeared to abram and said unto him i am
[1:00:54] the almighty i am el shaddai and and
[1:00:58] this word el shaddai
[1:01:00] almighty god is in the hebrew it comes
[1:01:03] from a root word meaning breast this is
[1:01:06] a type of the holy ghost
[1:01:09] so he's saying i am the breasted god i
[1:01:13] am the life giver
[1:01:15] i am the strength giver
[1:01:18] you're 99 years old but you're just a
[1:01:21] baby to
[1:01:23] hey me
[1:01:23] you're you're thinking you're you're too
[1:01:25] old to receive it you're too old to get
[1:01:27] healed you're too old for a miracle you
[1:01:30] can never get too old for a miracle
[1:01:34] oh man i always remember bill dowell
[1:01:36] who's past 90 and god raised him up
[1:01:40] there to shake brother at brennan's hand
[1:01:42] in front of the blue blue boy restaurant
[1:01:44] by vision he saw him coming there
[1:01:48] are you with me amen and he walked step
[1:01:51] by step in his healing until he stepped
[1:01:53] into that vision and he would live 90
[1:01:56] years old and live many many years after
[1:01:59] that
[1:02:01] you're never too old
[1:02:03] and you're not too
[1:02:04] young i was five when i gave my heart to
[1:02:08] the lord
[1:02:09] you're not too young
[1:02:13] now
[1:02:14] again
[1:02:14] this word almighty god
[1:02:17] is this hebrew word
[1:02:19] that comes from
[1:02:21] el shaddai
[1:02:22] or el shaddai come and from that comes
[1:02:26] the breast
[1:02:27] this is our age where god is revealing
[1:02:30] himself
[1:02:32] right now even as el shaddai when sarah
[1:02:35] who is in his past bearing
[1:02:38] brings forth a child
[1:02:40] and and abraham whose body is now dead i
[1:02:45] want you to notice it's going to take a
[1:02:47] resurrection life
[1:02:50] sarah her womb is dead
[1:02:53] abraham the body the bible said his body
[1:02:56] is now dead
[1:02:58] amen and and so in type he is born again
[1:03:02] by receiving the holy ghost and this
[1:03:05] again is where his faith begins it
[1:03:09] really begins his faith
[1:03:11] yes he had faith before but now it comes
[1:03:15] to a new level
[1:03:17] operating in the holy ghost
[1:03:20] now abraham was not
[1:03:22] not expecting a son by sarah he was that
[1:03:25] wasn't furthest thing out of his mind
[1:03:28] you know he was satisfied and he was
[1:03:30] happy with his son by hagar
[1:03:34] are you with me as far as he was
[1:03:36] concerned the promised son had come
[1:03:39] you know abraham's faith had to be
[1:03:42] resurrected
[1:03:45] amen it had to have a restart
[1:03:49] a renewing
[1:03:51] and his heart had to be turned toward
[1:03:54] the promise
[1:03:56] are you with me now now here when median
[1:03:59] el shaddai he would
[1:04:01] receive a restored faith
[1:04:05] he would be required to believe in the
[1:04:07] miraculous
[1:04:09] a dead womb a dead seed a dead promise a
[1:04:14] dead faith a dead church
[1:04:18] is being brought to life its
[1:04:20] resurrection power at work
[1:04:24] this is the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:04:28] this is the fullness of god coming into
[1:04:31] an individual amen it's more than a
[1:04:34] sanctification which cleanse your vessel
[1:04:37] it's more than a justification that
[1:04:40] declared too worthy to receive it it's
[1:04:42] more than that it is god coming down and
[1:04:46] living in tabernacle himself in the
[1:04:49] individual
[1:04:52] in this we're also seeing the coming of
[1:04:54] the lord
[1:04:55] he has come in the fullness of his word
[1:04:57] because
[1:04:58] of the opening of the seven seals that
[1:05:01] opened to us the truths of the book
[1:05:05] that would been
[1:05:06] once mysteries that were covered up and
[1:05:09] left in obscurity
[1:05:12] partial truths were known but this was a
[1:05:15] restoration to the fullness of the truth
[1:05:18] and because of this you know because of
[1:05:21] the misconceptions of the past down
[1:05:24] through time
[1:05:25] you know then then we we it required
[1:05:28] that god would send a message that the
[1:05:31] first part of his coming would be to a
[1:05:34] prophet now he wouldn't come in his
[1:05:37] fullness and dwell that prophet no he
[1:05:40] was not the fullness of the godhead
[1:05:42] bodily and never will be
[1:05:45] don't ever get that in mind we're not
[1:05:47] deifying the man the word was just
[1:05:49] coming to a prophet
[1:05:51] but that word was god
[1:05:54] are you with me amen it was a mighty
[1:05:56] shout of the archangel coming through
[1:06:00] the voice of a man
[1:06:02] oh yeah in that there was many things
[1:06:05] like brother branham would say you got
[1:06:07] to realize there's a human part you got
[1:06:10] to realize i'm a man you got to realize
[1:06:13] you know this comes in progression and
[1:06:16] revelation unfolding itself and and i
[1:06:19] might have said one thing back here but
[1:06:22] now
[1:06:23] you know understanding has come light is
[1:06:25] shown on this
[1:06:27] amen now but this is part of his coming
[1:06:30] is christ returning in the form of his
[1:06:34] word
[1:06:35] amen it's working in human beings and
[1:06:37] showing the signs that he promised
[1:06:40] but now i want you to notice
[1:06:42] there's something about his face
[1:06:46] we saw this when john fell at his feet
[1:06:48] but if you'll turn with me to revelation
[1:06:50] 10 1
[1:06:51] he said and i saw another mighty angel
[1:06:55] come down from heaven in his clothes
[1:06:57] with a cloud a rainbow was upon his head
[1:07:00] and i want to focus on this and his face
[1:07:03] and his face was as it were the sun
[1:07:08] his face
[1:07:10] was out as it was the sun with this
[1:07:13] mighty angel
[1:07:15] the full word come because
[1:07:17] his face his countenance was as the sun
[1:07:20] now light is being shown on things that
[1:07:24] had never been seen before
[1:07:27] this is the light that zechariah
[1:07:30] prophesied of it shall be light in the
[1:07:32] evening time
[1:07:34] and that light was now shining on the
[1:07:37] book
[1:07:38] the word the bible come on amen and it
[1:07:41] was causing it to be open
[1:07:44] a book whose mysteries were sealed
[1:07:47] and his contents could not be understood
[1:07:50] amen but but now his face shines upon it
[1:07:56] and when it does it becomes opened
[1:08:00] light
[1:08:01] shines upon things that were
[1:08:03] not understood
[1:08:08] people are claiming the opening of the
[1:08:11] word
[1:08:13] yet much of it is closed to them
[1:08:16] amen
[1:08:17] they closed the door mercy
[1:08:19] sealing up and shutting down divine
[1:08:22] healing
[1:08:24] miracles the holy ghost
[1:08:26] now jesus spoke a woe against the
[1:08:28] religious men of that day and it applies
[1:08:31] to this day
[1:08:32] whoa do you scribes and pharisees it's a
[1:08:35] whoa
[1:08:36] amen great what sorrow awaits you that's
[1:08:39] what it means when he says whoa
[1:08:41] hey man it's not woe like stop it's
[1:08:44] w-o-e like great sorrow
[1:08:47] great sorrow is coming upon you for you
[1:08:50] shut the door of the kingdom of heaven
[1:08:53] and people's faces and you won't go in
[1:08:55] yourself and you won't let others go in
[1:08:58] either
[1:09:02] now when the book was opened to john
[1:09:05] he saw his name in the promise
[1:09:08] and it caused the emotions to rise
[1:09:11] and ring up praises to the lamb
[1:09:14] who who
[1:09:16] opened the seals
[1:09:18] now the open of the word causes
[1:09:21] the word to live that's what it does it
[1:09:23] brings light upon it and when it's
[1:09:26] illuminated it has to be manifested
[1:09:30] amen and it opens up a fountain of
[1:09:33] living water
[1:09:35] amen a bountiful supply of the holy
[1:09:38] ghost
[1:09:40] amen now
[1:09:42] you cannot turn the message into a
[1:09:45] stagnated cistern
[1:09:47] where we just store up our creeds and
[1:09:50] dogmas and revivals of the past
[1:09:53] amen but you see you know even good
[1:09:56] fresh water will become stagnant if left
[1:09:59] in a cistern
[1:10:01] amen and that's what we've done we've
[1:10:02] tried to denominate the message
[1:10:06] and it becomes stagnant
[1:10:08] it didn't become a living water it
[1:10:10] became a stagnant pool
[1:10:13] and we take truths together and let it
[1:10:16] become
[1:10:17] dirty
[1:10:19] old
[1:10:22] unfit for drinking
[1:10:25] we had an old cistern down at a farm we
[1:10:28] had the well would always run dry
[1:10:31] so they had a cistern on an old farm and
[1:10:33] playing teelan when i was a kid
[1:10:36] we spent six years six months there when
[1:10:39] i was a boy and lived there for time as
[1:10:42] i told you my family was always preppers
[1:10:46] before preppers were popular
[1:10:48] we stored up food for the and we got
[1:10:51] prepared for the missile crisis and down
[1:10:53] down and and um
[1:10:55] that castro was causing and all the
[1:10:58] other things we you know it was there
[1:11:00] you know in the cistern
[1:11:01] you you would have to take a rag
[1:11:04] and strain the water
[1:11:07] in order to get you know the bugs out of
[1:11:10] it
[1:11:11] the wiggle tales
[1:11:13] amen it was leftovers from the a revival
[1:11:18] and that's a way that people many have
[1:11:20] done the message and many churches are
[1:11:23] only sisters
[1:11:25] and many of them are broken sisters
[1:11:28] that the revival is leaked out years ago
[1:11:31] because they forsook the fountain of
[1:11:34] living waters
[1:11:36] i want you to know that when the the
[1:11:38] word opens up it is a life
[1:11:42] given flow and it's a bountiful supply
[1:11:46] and it's pure and it's clean and it's
[1:11:49] free of wiggle tails
[1:11:52] and the dust of the past
[1:11:56] and the washing of dirty lives
[1:12:00] now brother bradham told us in december
[1:12:03] 1963 what we need today
[1:12:06] is an opening of the word that lives
[1:12:10] and then he says and he's the same
[1:12:12] yesterday today and forever
[1:12:14] he cannot fail they call it mental
[1:12:16] telepathy they call it whatever they
[1:12:18] want to or spiritual sort of devil as
[1:12:20] long as that word is flowing free and
[1:12:22] producing exactly what it said it would
[1:12:26] do it's a fountain in the house of david
[1:12:29] again back in bethlehem where that jesus
[1:12:32] christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:12:35] forever to his bethlehem dwellers live
[1:12:38] with it live in it it's a life
[1:12:41] journeying water for us as israel had
[1:12:46] hallelujah
[1:12:47] what a promise that is now this is el
[1:12:51] said i
[1:12:52] and here he is you're bringing forth a
[1:12:55] church
[1:12:56] born of the supernatural we've had
[1:12:58] ishmael that was born of the bonds woman
[1:13:01] and man's strength but this is a
[1:13:03] supernatural church
[1:13:05] a supernatural people a super race
[1:13:10] hallelujah amen these this is one born
[1:13:13] of the spoken word of god
[1:13:15] this is one that is born of a
[1:13:17] supernatural work
[1:13:19] of an appearance of the almighty
[1:13:23] romans 4 19 says being not weak in faith
[1:13:27] he considered not his own body now dead
[1:13:30] when he was about a hundred years old
[1:13:32] neither the deadness of sarah's womb
[1:13:35] and he staggered not i love these words
[1:13:37] he staggered not at the promise of god
[1:13:40] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[1:13:43] oh to be a people strong in faith
[1:13:47] giving glory to god and being fully
[1:13:50] persuaded
[1:13:52] amen that what do you promise he was
[1:13:54] also able to perform it
[1:13:57] oh that there would be a people who has
[1:14:00] met its el shaddai
[1:14:02] and their faith becomes a faith like
[1:14:05] this that they are fully persuaded
[1:14:08] nothing can change their mind a doctor's
[1:14:10] report can't change their mind
[1:14:12] circumstances symptoms cannot change
[1:14:15] their mind what the internet says cannot
[1:14:18] change their mind amen they've staggered
[1:14:21] out at the promise of god through
[1:14:23] unbelief but are strong in faith fully
[1:14:26] persuaded
[1:14:28] amen that what do you promise he's also
[1:14:31] able to perform it
[1:14:33] [Applause]
[1:14:35] hallelujah that is the kind of people
[1:14:37] the holy ghost produces
[1:14:40] that is the people of el shaddai
[1:14:43] that is the people who have received
[1:14:45] that appearance
[1:14:46] [Applause]
[1:14:49] that becomes so really fell to the
[1:14:51] ground
[1:14:53] i'm not in any way trying to get some
[1:14:56] emotion started or falling out
[1:14:58] that ain't what i'm trying to do i'm
[1:15:00] trying to tell you the experience is
[1:15:02] real
[1:15:03] profound
[1:15:05] life-changing
[1:15:06] shattering
[1:15:11] it has to be supernatural
[1:15:14] abram's body is dead
[1:15:16] sarah's womb is dead
[1:15:19] why why is he able to believe and
[1:15:22] not disbelieve or stagger at the promise
[1:15:24] why
[1:15:26] how is he with a dead body
[1:15:28] and so with the dead womb able to be
[1:15:31] strong in faith look there you look at
[1:15:33] the circumstances it's dead
[1:15:37] it's impossible
[1:15:40] you know but what is he doing you know
[1:15:42] how is he able to do this he is drinking
[1:15:46] and receiving life from el shaddai
[1:15:50] amen in type he is receiving the baptism
[1:15:54] of the holy ghost and it's a river of
[1:15:57] living water
[1:15:59] amen and it keeps flushing out unbelief
[1:16:02] it keeps pushing out doubt
[1:16:04] amen you can throw the gossip of
[1:16:06] unbelief adam and it pushes it out
[1:16:09] i don't hear it i won't receive it i
[1:16:11] don't believe it i believe what god's
[1:16:13] word said
[1:16:15] amen what god said is true and i believe
[1:16:18] it
[1:16:20] he's strong in the faith
[1:16:22] giving glory to god
[1:16:25] do you notice this if you have faith
[1:16:27] you're going to give glory to god
[1:16:29] amen when your faith is complete and you
[1:16:33] know you receive the holy ghost it
[1:16:35] causes you to give glory to god
[1:16:37] look what happened in the book of acts
[1:16:40] every time it did they spoke in other
[1:16:42] tongues glorifying god
[1:16:44] amen amen they spoke in other languages
[1:16:47] but they heard them and what were they
[1:16:50] doing glorifying god more than just
[1:16:53] coming out of your mouth it'll start
[1:16:54] coming out of your life
[1:16:58] hallelujah your life will glorify him
[1:17:01] your life will declare he's my god
[1:17:05] he's my lord
[1:17:07] he's my king there is no other about no
[1:17:11] other name but the name of jesus i will
[1:17:14] bow to the pressure of peer pressure i
[1:17:17] won't bow to the pressure of the world i
[1:17:20] will not bow to the presser of hollywood
[1:17:23] amen i will not bow to those who say
[1:17:27] they disbelieve the sign i will not bow
[1:17:31] to them i will not give them time
[1:17:34] i have no time for them
[1:17:40] flesh out unbelief
[1:17:44] in the faith
[1:17:46] easy the devil wants to cut off our
[1:17:47] praise
[1:17:50] when we drink from el shaddai
[1:17:52] when you really get the holy ghost
[1:17:55] it's going to bring a praise out of your
[1:17:57] life
[1:17:59] it makes the hallelujahs rule
[1:18:02] and it don't just happen in church
[1:18:05] but it does happen in church
[1:18:08] amen even when you hear the songs
[1:18:10] assigned when you see when you see the
[1:18:13] word going forth it causes the
[1:18:16] hallelujahs to begin to roll and thank
[1:18:19] you jesus and i'm so glad that i can say
[1:18:22] i'm one of them
[1:18:26] it's a sign
[1:18:28] that the resurrection is already working
[1:18:31] and how can it be a sign
[1:18:33] without a voice
[1:18:35] it must be the voice of the resurrected
[1:18:39] if it's the resurrection it must give
[1:18:42] voice
[1:18:44] amen now it's more than just receiving a
[1:18:48] message as luther and wesley did
[1:18:51] and then becoming the voice of a
[1:18:53] denomination
[1:18:55] there has been bride's brides in
[1:18:57] churches churches and
[1:18:58] but there must come one who is the word
[1:19:02] not a partial word but the fullness of
[1:19:04] the word the word made flesh dwelling
[1:19:07] here
[1:19:08] with resurrection life and resurrection
[1:19:11] power and give voice to the word
[1:19:17] now
[1:19:19] brother branham tells us
[1:19:21] in trying to do god a service without
[1:19:23] his will
[1:19:24] he said it's right at the end of the
[1:19:26] church age where they got things
[1:19:28] ecclesiastical has got so messed up
[1:19:32] until god sends a messenger
[1:19:34] and that's the message to that church
[1:19:36] age
[1:19:37] and then they take his message i want
[1:19:40] you to watch this what's the matter
[1:19:42] because he lives just for a little while
[1:19:45] and god
[1:19:46] then when they they take his message
[1:19:49] instead of carrying on with the rest of
[1:19:52] it
[1:19:52] they make a denomination
[1:19:56] you see they stop with the man
[1:20:00] and don't go on with his message
[1:20:04] they make a personality cult out of the
[1:20:07] man
[1:20:09] and don't follow his message
[1:20:13] are you with me amen so they make a
[1:20:15] denomination and so another messenger
[1:20:18] comes so it's been the cycle just like
[1:20:20] that
[1:20:21] by the way we just passed where brother
[1:20:23] bratton's been gone longer than he was
[1:20:25] here
[1:20:26] his birthday would have been a 113 years
[1:20:30] old
[1:20:31] and so that's 57 years he he lived only
[1:20:34] 56.
[1:20:36] but then he says
[1:20:38] you seen in my book be drawn out in the
[1:20:40] seven church ages
[1:20:42] where he told me and i stand by it as i
[1:20:45] stand by as a witness to god to be
[1:20:48] judged at the day of judgment for it
[1:20:51] this is a good one on the church age
[1:20:53] book
[1:20:54] listen to this you've seen it in my book
[1:20:57] it'll all be drawn out in the seven
[1:20:59] church ages
[1:21:00] which he told me i
[1:21:02] which i stand by as a witness to god to
[1:21:05] be judged at the day of judgment
[1:21:08] it come from god not from my thinking
[1:21:11] notice here i thought different from
[1:21:13] that
[1:21:14] and he said if i was going to have my
[1:21:16] thought like brother jack told me about
[1:21:18] the angel there
[1:21:19] the the one was with white wig he said
[1:21:22] he said that was christ and the
[1:21:24] glorified body but it wasn't
[1:21:27] it was showing the message being right
[1:21:29] the supreme deity he was god
[1:21:32] and the very thing i've been preaching
[1:21:35] from the word the word always bears what
[1:21:38] the record of the word
[1:21:40] now so the message of malachi 4
[1:21:44] then brings us to the birth of the word
[1:21:48] for it turns to heart
[1:21:51] notice the others make a tradition of
[1:21:54] the messenger's life
[1:21:56] but there's some that go on with the
[1:21:58] message
[1:22:00] and so it is from that word a people
[1:22:04] comes
[1:22:05] that are born of that word and where the
[1:22:08] word is made flesh in their flesh
[1:22:12] and i want you to get this today if you
[1:22:15] don't get anything
[1:22:17] because we're talking about the holy
[1:22:19] ghost
[1:22:20] but a constant refilling
[1:22:22] from el shaddai
[1:22:24] is so needed
[1:22:27] it's not a drink of wine and done
[1:22:31] it's not a sip
[1:22:35] a man it has to be an everyday event
[1:22:39] continually like a baby nursing street
[1:22:42] from its mother
[1:22:44] amen god has opened unsealed his breast
[1:22:49] to us opening up the scripture of both
[1:22:52] breasts both old and new testament
[1:22:54] listen he doesn't do it to the world
[1:22:58] he doesn't do it publicly he does it to
[1:23:01] a chosen people it is only to them the
[1:23:05] book is unsealed the rest of them is
[1:23:07] still sealed it's still closed up they
[1:23:10] will never see it open
[1:23:12] but for you it has been open
[1:23:15] and because it's been opened you have an
[1:23:17] access
[1:23:19] to everlasting ever flowing
[1:23:22] all the time life
[1:23:30] you see old in the new testament
[1:23:32] every type of the bible being manifested
[1:23:36] you see how else could abraham be strong
[1:23:39] in the faith and not consider this that
[1:23:42] his body was now dead in the sarah's
[1:23:45] womb he wasn't thinking on that
[1:23:48] he wasn't allowing that to sit on the
[1:23:51] throne of his of his mind
[1:23:55] somebody help me
[1:23:57] he wasn't allowing listen if you are you
[1:24:00] got cancer and you allow yourself to
[1:24:02] dwell on my cancer
[1:24:05] for the first thing it shouldn't be
[1:24:07] yours
[1:24:08] [Applause]
[1:24:10] and the second thing you shouldn't be
[1:24:12] dwelling on it
[1:24:14] you should be looking at the promises
[1:24:16] confessing the promises amen stagger not
[1:24:19] at the promises strong in the faith
[1:24:22] giving praise to god every time your
[1:24:25] mind goes to the sickness you go back to
[1:24:27] praise again thank you jesus for healing
[1:24:30] me thank you lord for saving me thank
[1:24:33] you lord for your report the doctor's
[1:24:36] report wasn't good but your report and i
[1:24:39] believe because you're looking for
[1:24:41] somebody that i believe you're my report
[1:24:46] joy he was wounded for my transgression
[1:24:49] bruised for my iniquity the weapons i
[1:24:52] should have got
[1:24:53] amen because i didn't pray enough and i
[1:24:56] didn't fast enough and i didn't read the
[1:24:58] bible enough and i've never done nothing
[1:25:00] enough and i can't be enough but
[1:25:02] i'm drinking from one who is more than
[1:25:05] enough
[1:25:14] he had to believe for resurrection life
[1:25:18] sarah's womb was dead
[1:25:21] he had to believe the resurrection life
[1:25:23] for himself
[1:25:24] his body was dead
[1:25:28] somebody got to start believing for
[1:25:29] resurrection
[1:25:32] somebody's got to start believing for a
[1:25:34] new body
[1:25:35] somebody's got to
[1:25:37] start preparing and getting ready
[1:25:39] dressing himself in the word for a
[1:25:41] wedding yeah
[1:25:42] come on somebody amen you see he had to
[1:25:45] believe in resurrection life and how
[1:25:48] could he do that
[1:25:50] being weak in faith
[1:25:53] that was
[1:25:54] rapturing
[1:25:55] body changing faith
[1:25:58] that was coming from the holy ghost
[1:26:06] don't hang up on me that's right
[1:26:09] i'm not through and i'm fixing the value
[1:26:11] back in
[1:26:15] listen to me
[1:26:17] you dropped the call
[1:26:19] this was
[1:26:20] rapturing body changing faith
[1:26:25] and it was coming from
[1:26:28] the holy ghost
[1:26:36] but how could it be strong in the face
[1:26:38] of a dead body
[1:26:40] on a dead wound
[1:26:43] how could he be strong enough to
[1:26:44] consider not
[1:26:46] or to consider what was that he did not
[1:26:48] consider what was dead
[1:26:50] he did not consider
[1:26:52] his dead parts
[1:26:55] he considered what el shaddai promised
[1:27:01] you see he drank continually on the
[1:27:04] promises of god this was the holy ghost
[1:27:08] a well of living water
[1:27:11] what good does it have abundance of
[1:27:14] water if you drink one time and that's
[1:27:16] it
[1:27:18] come on now amen it's a water it's a
[1:27:21] well of living water
[1:27:24] a constant refreshing
[1:27:27] and we're not a revival in youth camp
[1:27:29] and we've got to wait another year for
[1:27:31] another revival or we got to wait till
[1:27:33] the october meetings or a special youth
[1:27:36] service but a continual reviving

[1:28:02] down down down
[1:28:08] it is refreshing
[1:28:12] and it is to be continual
[1:28:17] his body was now dead
[1:28:20] but his spirit was a living spirit
[1:28:24] a life within him that drove back death
[1:28:28] that drove back doubts
[1:28:30] that drove back fear
[1:28:33] the holy ghost is far
[1:28:35] a constant and a continual
[1:28:38] communion
[1:28:40] we must go back again and again for
[1:28:42] refreshing if you can want to be

[1:29:31] amen not a prayer of god help johnny
[1:29:34] today and be with susie it's where your
[1:29:37] soul comes up in the presence of god and
[1:29:40] you just bathe down in his presence it's
[1:29:43] praying until the holy ghost comes and
[1:29:46] you begin to pray in the spirit
[1:29:50] we're the supernatural begins to happen
[1:29:54] this is not to be
[1:29:56] one and done this is not to be once a
[1:29:58] week this is not to be once a month
[1:30:02] this is to be every day pulling from el
[1:30:05] shaddai
[1:30:14] you pray in the spirit
[1:30:17] until the supernatural comes
[1:30:21] you pray in the spirit and that's where
[1:30:23] the supernatural comes
[1:30:26] it's now look
[1:30:28] it's always mechanical at first
[1:30:31] amen come on brother always it's always
[1:30:34] mechanical at first
[1:30:36] look when i when i preach
[1:30:38] you know
[1:30:40] you know we
[1:30:41] we always start out in the mechanical
[1:30:44] we do
[1:30:45] you you
[1:30:47] you could call it also in the flesh
[1:30:50] people were worried about being in the
[1:30:52] flesh you came here in the flesh
[1:30:54] you probably leave here in the flesh
[1:30:57] but you see when you're preaching you
[1:30:59] just keep yielding
[1:31:01] you know you we we start out in the
[1:31:03] flesh and we pray
[1:31:06] we ask for god's spirit and we feel a
[1:31:08] little tug there and then we read the
[1:31:11] bible and something strikes us there
[1:31:13] it's still mechanical we keep yielding
[1:31:16] and soon the anointing drops down
[1:31:19] and the holy spirit takes over
[1:31:21] and something happens and you you must
[1:31:25] you see
[1:31:26] you you begin to say things you never
[1:31:28] dreamed of saying if words come out of
[1:31:30] your mouth it flows as prophecy amen the
[1:31:34] spirit is speaking to the church
[1:31:37] but it starts out mechanical
[1:31:41] same thing happens
[1:31:43] you start out mechanical in prayers
[1:31:46] the problem with too many of you your
[1:31:48] prayers
[1:31:49] start
[1:31:50] and end mechanically
[1:31:55] you must pray in the spirit
[1:31:57] you start mechanically until he comes
[1:32:00] that's when you're really drinking from
[1:32:02] our shadow
[1:32:04] that's when life starts flowing from the
[1:32:07] holy ghost into you where you start
[1:32:09] praying in the holy ghost
[1:32:14] now and it is the rising of the sun
[1:32:17] brother branham said mechanic and the
[1:32:19] mechanics by going in notice by going in
[1:32:22] mechanics
[1:32:23] and the dynamics come from above holy
[1:32:26] spirit and then catch them away lord
[1:32:29] quicken their mortal bodies then we will
[1:32:31] hear genuine new tongues powers of god
[1:32:35] love and told dying grace and living
[1:32:37] grace and a resurrected christ a body of
[1:32:40] bride representing him on the earth
[1:32:44] that's what it means when you when you
[1:32:47] start mechanically but then the dynamics
[1:32:50] come
[1:32:51] from above the holy spirit and catches
[1:32:53] you away
[1:32:55] and then it quickens your mortal body
[1:32:58] amen then you hear genuine new tongues
[1:33:01] powers of god love and told dying grace
[1:33:05] grace to die by and grace to live by
[1:33:08] about a resurrected christ a body a
[1:33:12] bride representing himself on the earth
[1:33:20] brother branham explained it this way
[1:33:22] when he went out to pray for georgie
[1:33:25] carter
[1:33:26] you remember
[1:33:28] he was
[1:33:29] he felt a burden come upon him
[1:33:33] have you ever felt burdened
[1:33:38] i don't mean
[1:33:39] your troubles burdened you and you
[1:33:41] couldn't pay this bill in your burden
[1:33:44] i'm talking about signing crying because
[1:33:46] of the sins in the city
[1:33:49] and their country and all around you
[1:33:52] that sin made you so sick
[1:33:55] you sighed and cried over it you wept
[1:34:03] brother branham told us in 1964 that's
[1:34:05] the evidence of the sealing of the holy
[1:34:07] ghost
[1:34:09] it causes you to sigh and cry it puts a
[1:34:13] burden within your heart
[1:34:16] see somebody else saved oh god don't let
[1:34:18] them be lost
[1:34:24] he went to pray for george carter
[1:34:27] went up to on the hill and he said i
[1:34:29] started to kneel down and
[1:34:31] the green briars was cutting me so i
[1:34:33] moved a little further and it got so
[1:34:35] rough on the ground that the rocks was
[1:34:37] hurting me and i couldn't get
[1:34:38] comfortable and so i went around to the
[1:34:40] side the heel and it was leaning
[1:34:41] sideways and
[1:34:43] you know
[1:34:44] the devil was just trying to keep me
[1:34:46] from getting the blessing
[1:34:48] he said that's all it was and then i
[1:34:50] climbed up a little farther into the
[1:34:52] ticket and i knelt down the mosquitoes
[1:34:55] was just humming all around my ears and
[1:34:56] i could hardly pray and i believed then
[1:34:59] it was the devil so i said oh lord god
[1:35:01] be merciful and just threw up my hands
[1:35:03] and started praying anyhow and just let
[1:35:05] the mosquitoes fill up if they wanted to
[1:35:10] but but there was something burned my
[1:35:12] heart and after after i become so lost
[1:35:15] in prayer
[1:35:18] this is nursing from thou shalt i yes
[1:35:21] this is getting strength instruction
[1:35:24] life
[1:35:26] from the holy ghost amen i became so
[1:35:29] lost in prayer i guess you christians
[1:35:31] know what it means to be lost in prayer
[1:35:34] and just forget where you are
[1:35:36] that's praying in the spirit
[1:35:41] you just closed your book walked outside
[1:35:43] didn't want to hear that did you well i
[1:35:45] got some more
[1:35:47] when the spirit is moving the church
[1:35:50] that's another time to drink from el
[1:35:52] shaddai
[1:35:54] the holy ghost
[1:35:56] a lot of people will sit there and watch
[1:35:58] what's going on and say oh don't that
[1:36:00] look silly and oh that's nice they're
[1:36:02] getting a blessing instead of entering
[1:36:04] in
[1:36:05] and receiving something from god
[1:36:07] themselves
[1:36:09] you needed just as much as they needed
[1:36:11] it
[1:36:12] you old truck how hide
[1:36:15] amen you need the holy ghost
[1:36:18] and it ought to be in every oh
[1:36:20] the church we are eagles and when the
[1:36:22] eagles feed the blood swells they don't
[1:36:24] eat on denicarion
[1:36:28] they eat on something with life in it
[1:36:30] and when they eat the blood flows it
[1:36:32] gets all over them everybody can see
[1:36:40] that's what every church service ought
[1:36:42] to be like that's what your prayer life
[1:36:43] ought to be like
[1:36:45] that's what your life your daily life
[1:36:47] ought to be like this is not one and
[1:36:49] done you are nursing from the shut eye
[1:36:53] and you're going to nurse on it till
[1:36:54] you're changed
[1:36:56] your faith is going to go from faith to
[1:36:58] faith
[1:37:04] the level your faith is you'll never
[1:37:06] take a rapture
[1:37:10] your faith has got to be elevated
[1:37:16] i i i know you you didn't like that slap
[1:37:19] but i have to say it very plain to you
[1:37:22] you're going to have to drink
[1:37:25] and drink
[1:37:26] and drink
[1:37:30] my sister delores said bill when the
[1:37:32] power was in the church i felt like i
[1:37:34] could just fall away and then everybody
[1:37:36] the holy ghost began to fail on person
[1:37:38] one person i just sat and looked around
[1:37:42] and he said now the law of sin and death
[1:37:44] works in your flesh you always have it
[1:37:48] the law of the spirit of life works in
[1:37:50] your heart so your heart your spirit and
[1:37:52] your heart will make your body obey what
[1:37:54] it says to do
[1:37:56] and that's exactly right paul said
[1:37:58] always the flesh i'm too tired i'm
[1:38:00] unable i'm not sufficient i can't do it
[1:38:03] i said dolores
[1:38:04] they i said to delores has been talking
[1:38:06] to me about the holy ghost and she said
[1:38:08] what made me feel that way just at the
[1:38:11] time i should have felt good he said the
[1:38:14] devil
[1:38:17] he seen you just about ready to receive
[1:38:20] it and said i'll put a damper on her and
[1:38:23] fan her a little bit and cool her off
[1:38:25] cool her down a little he said but
[1:38:27] that's when you rise and you claim your
[1:38:30] god-given rights
[1:38:32] [Applause]
[1:38:33] amen that's what paul said when i would
[1:38:36] do good evil as present and your flesh
[1:38:38] will always say oh i'm too tired i'm too
[1:38:41] weary oh that's not for me i i don't
[1:38:44] want to look like that i don't i don't
[1:38:46] want the spear to get all over me like
[1:38:48] that your flesh will always say and give
[1:38:50] every kind of excuse but you got to
[1:38:52] realize that's the devil
[1:38:55] and press
[1:38:57] it
[1:38:58] [Applause]
[1:39:06] and make your flesh obey god
[1:39:12] see you have to press through to the
[1:39:14] holy ghost
[1:39:15] when a baby nurses it stimulates the
[1:39:18] flow
[1:39:21] you know that
[1:39:23] even the cry
[1:39:24] will cause the milk to come down
[1:39:29] dude you got it and then you can drink
[1:39:31] of the water of life freely
[1:39:35] you know i i was a dairy farmer for
[1:39:38] years
[1:39:39] and milking goats
[1:39:41] you know i always said
[1:39:43] you know god gave us goat milk i don't
[1:39:45] drink it now because it's not available
[1:39:47] but i said if god intended us to milk a
[1:39:50] cow to give us four hands
[1:39:54] but you know with the goat when you
[1:39:56] bring him in or any animal today the
[1:39:58] dairy cow it doesn't matter you have to
[1:40:01] stimulate the animal for the milk to
[1:40:04] come down
[1:40:07] all right so we would we would begin
[1:40:10] with washing with warm water and and
[1:40:12] massaging the udder and first thing you
[1:40:15] know you'd feel it come down because
[1:40:17] before that you got a little squirt a
[1:40:19] little drip here there but then when it
[1:40:20] comes brother you can milk
[1:40:24] because the flow was free
[1:40:26] now let me just say you know god's not a
[1:40:29] goat or a milk cow but you're gonna have
[1:40:32] to stimulate the flow
[1:40:34] even a cry from a saint of god will
[1:40:38] cause his breath to let down nourishment
[1:40:43] life
[1:40:44] amen it will you must nourish until the
[1:40:48] stimulation makes the dead to come to
[1:40:51] life again driving out death
[1:40:57] like israel down in egypt
[1:40:59] they had to start groaning they had to
[1:41:01] start travailing
[1:41:03] the church has to get so sick of sin
[1:41:07] that they want out of here
[1:41:11] did you hear what i said the church is
[1:41:14] going to have to get so sick of sin and
[1:41:17] evil and sodom i wonder if that's what
[1:41:20] this covet is about
[1:41:23] you know israel had to get sick of egypt
[1:41:26] before they would leave come on
[1:41:28] they had to get sick of where they were
[1:41:31] in the slave belt and being mistreated
[1:41:34] they had to get replaced until they
[1:41:36] groaned
[1:41:37] because of it
[1:41:39] this is the bible you sign cry and it's
[1:41:42] those that are signed and crying i put a
[1:41:44] seal on them
[1:41:46] amen that that's the whole thing you
[1:41:49] know again brother branham told us this
[1:41:51] very concept and he did it after the
[1:41:53] seals were open in 63 he said a baby he
[1:41:57] said you got to be like a baby and cry
[1:41:59] for it
[1:42:02] cried if something happens
[1:42:06] [Music]
[1:42:09] brother tim i'm afraid it's just flesh
[1:42:11] you're gonna start out there
[1:42:14] you're going to bring your old stinkin
[1:42:16] hide down to the altar
[1:42:18] and you're going to start out like that
[1:42:20] but if you just stay like that in the
[1:42:22] flesh and walk back to your seat it
[1:42:24] ain't going to have done you a bit of
[1:42:26] good
[1:42:27] fact to the moderator diminishes your
[1:42:29] faith for the next time
[1:42:36] you go on
[1:42:38] you get in the spirit
[1:42:42] you see i wonder if this and
[1:42:44] if this is what this woke
[1:42:46] society is about
[1:42:49] i wonder if companies like disney who
[1:42:51] use
[1:42:52] who used to be wholesome family films
[1:42:55] you know uh now beating at the door
[1:42:58] in sodom screaming about accepting the
[1:43:01] transgender the teaching our children to
[1:43:04] to accept homosexual mentality and and
[1:43:07] accept their agenda it's sodom
[1:43:10] knocking at the door
[1:43:12] i wonder i wonder when it's going to
[1:43:15] cause when it's going to get enough it's
[1:43:17] going to cause the bride to start
[1:43:19] signing and crying
[1:43:21] [Music]
[1:43:22] am i moaning and crying and the sealant
[1:43:25] angel only seals those whose sin makes
[1:43:29] them sick
[1:43:35] the rest of them belong to the world
[1:43:38] brother branham said in voice of the
[1:43:40] sign
[1:43:41] israel was waiting on god god was
[1:43:43] waiting on them
[1:43:44] he had his prophet out there in the
[1:43:46] wilderness but he was only waiting for
[1:43:48] people to call him into action
[1:43:50] i believe he's got the same thing today
[1:43:52] waiting for his church to call it on the
[1:43:55] scene so he can act
[1:43:57] the promise of today is ready but he's
[1:43:59] got to get the people to pray and and
[1:44:01] groaning like they were down there and
[1:44:04] then it'll come on the scene
[1:44:07] so he's got to get people there pulling
[1:44:09] on god
[1:44:10] stimulating the flow
[1:44:13] amen are you with me
[1:44:15] somebody hearing me
[1:44:17] amen listen now brother brandon said
[1:44:19] politics voting in and out and saying
[1:44:22] this and that the other holy spirit has
[1:44:24] no more right away in the church
[1:44:28] than nothing
[1:44:30] no more prayer meetings
[1:44:32] no more agonizing with god to fulfill
[1:44:34] his word
[1:44:35] no more believing that the word is the
[1:44:37] same still the same yesterday today and
[1:44:39] forever they just vulgarized down got a
[1:44:43] denomination put their name on the book
[1:44:46] god's
[1:44:47] lazy and soft set back there gloating on
[1:44:50] some kind of denicarion
[1:44:53] and then they're supposed to be like as
[1:44:55] a hawk that's similar to brother to the
[1:44:57] eagle the brother the prophet that
[1:44:59] brought the true word and manifested i
[1:45:01] wonder what is this jedicarian he's
[1:45:04] talking about
[1:45:07] what makes something dedicated
[1:45:11] he's speaking about bible truths
[1:45:14] i want you to get this he is speaking
[1:45:17] about bible truths of the reformers that
[1:45:20] have become stagnant
[1:45:23] because it no longer lives or manifests
[1:45:27] its promises
[1:45:31] that's what a caring is
[1:45:33] it's bible truths
[1:45:36] that have been brought
[1:45:38] that no longer lives but is stagnant
[1:45:41] and does not manifest his promises
[1:45:46] that's the same with the truth of this
[1:45:48] message
[1:45:49] if we allow it to become stagnant
[1:45:52] and it not manifest itself
[1:45:55] you know and showing jesus christ the
[1:45:57] same yesterday today and forever in
[1:45:59] every detail but his corporal body is
[1:46:02] dedication
[1:46:04] and like a bunch of vultures that gather
[1:46:06] around it gloating because god sent a
[1:46:09] prophet
[1:46:10] and become like a slobbering drooling
[1:46:13] vulture idolizing him instead of
[1:46:16] manifesting the word
[1:46:19] i know that's hard and difficult maybe
[1:46:21] for some to swallow but you see no more
[1:46:24] prayer made no more agonizing with god
[1:46:26] to fulfill his word no more believing
[1:46:28] that the word is still the same
[1:46:30] yesterday today and forever they just
[1:46:32] vulturized down
[1:46:34] got a denomination the name on the book
[1:46:36] they got soft and lazy sets back
[1:46:39] bloating
[1:46:41] this is 1965.
[1:46:44] did you hear me
[1:46:46] this quote is from from his last sermons
[1:46:49] and the word had been open now for two
[1:46:51] years
[1:46:53] with the seals being taken off the book
[1:46:55] and brother branham isn't there sitting
[1:46:57] back there gloating about what god did
[1:46:59] yesterday he was looking for fresh oil
[1:47:02] of the spirit to make the word live
[1:47:05] that's what i'm saying this self said
[1:47:06] eye not a drink from yesterday but a
[1:47:09] word that's open and alive
[1:47:12] if this message won't open the blind
[1:47:15] eyes if this message come on if what
[1:47:18] we've got if the power we have will not
[1:47:20] heal the sick
[1:47:22] but if it will not give a genuine
[1:47:24] experience to the holy ghost if it will
[1:47:27] not produce prophecy if it will not
[1:47:29] produce itself it is dedicated
[1:47:33] [Applause]
[1:47:37] a lot of us being fed out and
[1:47:40] served out
[1:47:41] don't get mad at me brother branham said
[1:47:43] this happens
[1:47:45] they have made
[1:47:47] and are carrion
[1:47:49] bait
[1:47:51] made it dead dead dead
[1:47:54] rotten meat for buzzards
[1:47:58] the world falling apart
[1:48:01] he says just exactly what jesus said
[1:48:04] when he come down to the earth
[1:48:06] he said god sent them prophets down to
[1:48:08] the age and every time that their world
[1:48:10] system would fall apart their religious
[1:48:12] system what did you do with him god sent
[1:48:15] the prophet and you put him in a tomb
[1:48:17] and then about another generation you
[1:48:19] wake up and realize that was a prophet
[1:48:22] and then what do you do you garnish the
[1:48:23] tomb what do you do make a tradition of
[1:48:25] his life
[1:48:27] that's exactly what israel had done had
[1:48:29] taken the prophet moses made a tradition
[1:48:31] out of his life and that's the way we do
[1:48:34] martin luther oh john wesley other men
[1:48:36] were always looking back see those
[1:48:39] things and you make a tradition of their
[1:48:40] life and garnish the tombs of them and
[1:48:43] their message was for another day by the
[1:48:46] time you wake up well that day's done
[1:48:48] live by and we're in another day and the
[1:48:50] whole system has worked that way since
[1:48:52] the beginning man-made systems
[1:48:57] and that's how a message from god
[1:48:59] becomes carrion
[1:49:02] dead
[1:49:03] rotten
[1:49:05] is when it becomes
[1:49:06] just a tradition
[1:49:10] when
[1:49:12] what you have
[1:49:13] becomes stagnant
[1:49:16] and doesn't live
[1:49:18] when you lack a buzzard
[1:49:21] sit gloating over the past
[1:49:23] god used to heal but not now
[1:49:28] you see it just ain't the same as it was
[1:49:30] back there what jesus is
[1:49:34] amen when they you know
[1:49:37] god used to heal in the past but not now
[1:49:39] when they got the holy ghost they
[1:49:41] shouted they spoke in tongues that
[1:49:42] glorified god but not now that's not how
[1:49:45] we get it today you know what god used
[1:49:47] to move in prayer lines but not now
[1:49:54] we're the bride we don't need prayer
[1:49:55] lines anymore you're bribed for a
[1:49:58] buzzard
[1:49:59] you're certainly not an eagle
[1:50:02] amen oh we don't want to get emotional
[1:50:04] yeah because what you have
[1:50:07] no one would ever get excited over here
[1:50:14] what you got what you're offering nobody
[1:50:16] would get excited over
[1:50:18] i mean it's become a tradition it's a
[1:50:20] form of godliness it's a baptist
[1:50:22] approach of we believe and we got the
[1:50:24] holy ghost there's certainly nothing to
[1:50:26] shout about
[1:50:28] amen it's carrying there's no healing to
[1:50:31] it life is going out of it there's no
[1:50:33] more longer a miracle it's a dead
[1:50:36] carrion
[1:50:40] choosing of the bride he said a church
[1:50:42] member if your church
[1:50:44] isn't like a bible church like that that
[1:50:46] measures up to god's qualification of
[1:50:49] the word which is by the way is a book
[1:50:51] of acts church
[1:50:53] get out of it and get into christ
[1:50:56] amen politics voting in voting out
[1:50:59] saying this down to the other in other
[1:51:01] words the pastor going by the opinions
[1:51:04] of the members
[1:51:06] can you can you imagine a church
[1:51:08] actually voted on whether the seventh
[1:51:10] seal was open
[1:51:15] can you imagine that
[1:51:17] why do we need to vote on whether it's
[1:51:19] open god opened it
[1:51:21] the devil's trying to close it but god
[1:51:23] opened it
[1:51:25] amen yeah yeah brother branham couldn't
[1:51:28] say things publicly and parts of it was
[1:51:31] not released until after his death so he
[1:51:33] would say you know god would not permit
[1:51:35] me he wouldn't allow him to put out that
[1:51:38] tape at that time
[1:51:40] but all the seven seals are open
[1:51:43] every mystery of god is revealed amen
[1:51:46] are you with me
[1:51:49] and the holy ghost
[1:51:51] the holy spirit has no
[1:51:53] more right away in the church
[1:51:56] than nothing
[1:52:00] so we have church ordered god
[1:52:04] out of the church
[1:52:07] i'll let that sink for a moment
[1:52:14] selah
[1:52:17] pause and think on this
[1:52:24] for the butts baby saila
[1:52:29] pause and think on this
[1:52:32] well
[1:52:33] gifts should be in the back room
[1:52:36] backroom
[1:52:39] that shows the attitude of preachers
[1:52:40] toward the gifts of the spirit something
[1:52:42] that's precious wonderful and real
[1:52:45] and of god
[1:52:46] you see their attitude toward them back
[1:52:48] room
[1:52:50] they want them in the back room
[1:52:52] never did brother branham said gifts are
[1:52:54] to be in the back room
[1:52:57] amen because the problems he was having
[1:53:00] in the tabernacle and misuse of gifts in
[1:53:02] the pentecost arena they interrupt his
[1:53:04] sermon and their altar calls they said
[1:53:07] and he said they were to wait on their
[1:53:09] ministry in an appointed room
[1:53:12] not a back room
[1:53:14] by the way where is your appointed room
[1:53:19] but don't worry about a gift of tongues
[1:53:21] and interpretation
[1:53:23] interpretation and interrupting your
[1:53:25] altar call today you don't have them
[1:53:27] anymore
[1:53:29] [Music]
[1:53:30] what do you got to worry about
[1:53:32] brother tim have you read all 3 300
[1:53:35] quotes that brother branham said about
[1:53:37] altar called yeah but obviously you
[1:53:39] haven't
[1:53:42] well
[1:53:43] they didn't have them in the bible yeah
[1:53:44] they didn't have church buildings in the
[1:53:46] bible or altars in the new testament i
[1:53:49] thought about new testament churches
[1:53:50] they didn't have a temple they didn't
[1:53:51] have altar they didn't have nothing
[1:53:54] there was there was no church building
[1:53:56] when when when those three thousand were
[1:53:58] added to the lord and received the holy
[1:54:01] ghost from the day of pentecost
[1:54:03] [Applause]
[1:54:04] amen
[1:54:05] now but of those 3 300 quotes he never
[1:54:10] told us to take the altar out
[1:54:14] he scolded the churches back then and i
[1:54:16] quote the old altar was taken to a full
[1:54:19] fashion mourner's bench was taken out
[1:54:22] and put down in the basement instead of
[1:54:25] souls on the altar it was lilies on the
[1:54:27] altar
[1:54:31] that's why when i built this church i
[1:54:32] wanted an altar all the way here and all
[1:54:34] the way there we use the steps the front
[1:54:38] everything for an altar
[1:54:40] amen because because again
[1:54:43] you say well it's a methodist tradition
[1:54:45] yep he said that and the methodist did
[1:54:49] turn it into a plea of well your mother
[1:54:51] died and she wanted you to come to
[1:54:53] christ and pull on them from because of
[1:54:56] some human emotion instead of coming to
[1:54:59] christ because you realize you're a
[1:55:00] sinner and you need jesus
[1:55:05] but before he left us in 1965 in
[1:55:07] december he says the old fashioned altar
[1:55:11] calls they're out of style today
[1:55:15] but god still moves in them
[1:55:18] can't you feel it moving on you church
[1:55:23] and it's without sensation i guess but
[1:55:26] it can be felt
[1:55:28] can you imagine now
[1:55:30] that this is true of many churches
[1:55:33] that follow the message
[1:55:36] i've been in churches
[1:55:38] where they took the altar out
[1:55:40] didn't want nobody snotting and
[1:55:42] screaming and crying at their altar no
[1:55:45] but you know when we talk about these
[1:55:47] things and we talk about even church
[1:55:50] order and some things like that let me
[1:55:51] deal with something just for a moment
[1:55:53] i am still pausing and letting you think
[1:55:57] you you're only making a law out of what
[1:55:59] you want to be law
[1:56:03] you know if you took church order and
[1:56:05] made it a law and we follow every dot
[1:56:07] and tittle like you're one to do about
[1:56:10] the gifts of the spirit
[1:56:12] sermon leaks are only 30 to 40 minutes
[1:56:17] and if you're legalistic about it then
[1:56:19] you turn every preacher into a preacher
[1:56:22] at and is sermon into a sermon that and
[1:56:25] the people in the christianettes
[1:56:29] hello
[1:56:31] and the holy spirit no longer has the
[1:56:34] right-of-way in the church
[1:56:37] because a legalistic system
[1:56:41] a man orders he stops at 40 minutes
[1:56:48] oh
[1:56:50] and where is your bell
[1:56:53] and there should be a belt said here and
[1:56:56] when that bell is tapped
[1:56:58] or either the church bell when it taps
[1:57:00] on the outside that's dismissing sunday
[1:57:03] school and when that bell rings that
[1:57:06] means everything comes to order right
[1:57:08] there
[1:57:09] so
[1:57:11] and where is your sunday school report
[1:57:14] every teacher dismisses their class
[1:57:17] comes to the audience out there give the
[1:57:19] report sunday school report and then
[1:57:21] dismiss the whole thing and then let all
[1:57:23] that wants to save for the preaching
[1:57:25] service be next
[1:57:28] so it sounds like the preaching service
[1:57:31] is optional
[1:57:34] we all know that church order is a
[1:57:36] guideline
[1:57:37] it is not a law it never was intended
[1:57:41] to be a law
[1:57:43] and but if you're going to make it a law
[1:57:45] don't make those parts laws that you
[1:57:48] want law let's apply it across the board
[1:57:53] every jot never tittle
[1:57:56] and oh what about the rest of it you're
[1:57:57] only to have two songs then take the
[1:58:00] offering read the prayer requests have
[1:58:02] prayer then a song then the pastor walks
[1:58:05] out and somewhere between 30 and 35
[1:58:08] minutes lay your sermon out
[1:58:10] so now you can go 45 we stretched it so
[1:58:13] if you speak for 46 you broke in church
[1:58:16] order just as much as somebody speaking
[1:58:18] in tongues
[1:58:22] has broken it and if you have four songs
[1:58:25] you have broke church order just as much
[1:58:28] as somebody prophesied
[1:58:35] and i'm quoting from church order now
[1:58:37] 1963
[1:58:39] and then take your altar call uh-oh
[1:58:43] uh-oh
[1:58:44] and take your altar call so if you want
[1:58:47] to do church order you've got to have
[1:58:48] altar calls
[1:58:54] and if anybody here in the church you
[1:58:57] you say if anybody here in the church
[1:58:58] would like to sit accept christ's
[1:59:00] service well a savior we're asking you
[1:59:03] inviting you to the altar right now just
[1:59:05] to stand your feet and if no one stands
[1:59:08] then you say is there anyone that's a
[1:59:10] candidate for baptism that has already
[1:59:12] repented and wants to be baptized in
[1:59:14] water for remission of sins
[1:59:16] so got to give an invitation for baptism
[1:59:19] and if they wish to come we're giving
[1:59:21] you the opportunity now you will you
[1:59:22] come while the organ is still playing
[1:59:24] and nobody comes well is there anyone
[1:59:26] that never received the baptism of the
[1:59:27] holy ghost and want to do so tonight
[1:59:29] would you want us to pray for you well i
[1:59:32] thought just by accepting the message
[1:59:34] and coming down and accepting the mess
[1:59:36] and saying brother branham was the
[1:59:37] prophet we got it what do we need the
[1:59:38] holy ghost for
[1:59:41] well somebody comes up then let two or
[1:59:43] three lay hands on them and pray for
[1:59:45] them send them right back into one of
[1:59:46] the rooms and somebody in there instruct
[1:59:49] them or somewhere to come through with
[1:59:51] the baptism of the holy ghost the
[1:59:53] congregation is all away from them
[1:59:57] but oh we don't have altar calls no
[2:00:00] neither do you have a back room for the
[2:00:03] gifts either
[2:00:04] neither an appointed room
[2:00:07] because you have made it
[2:00:11] where the holy spirit can have no more
[2:00:13] right away
[2:00:15] through your traditions
[2:00:20] somebody help me preach now
[2:00:22] amen i i know i i'm screwing the
[2:00:24] screwing it down right here and making
[2:00:26] it tight hammering it in and clenching
[2:00:28] it
[2:00:30] hey man maybe i'm laboring on it too
[2:00:31] much i don't mean to be mean about this
[2:00:33] i want to be straight about it
[2:00:36] am i not and because
[2:00:38] you have done this you have made it
[2:00:40] where there are no gifts people say well
[2:00:43] you know they preach against the gifts i
[2:00:45] say what gifts
[2:00:49] what are you worried about there hadn't
[2:00:51] been one in your church for years
[2:00:55] prophecy has become despised among
[2:00:58] message churches
[2:00:59] speaking in tongues forbidden
[2:01:02] we have done what the apostle paul told
[2:01:04] us not to do
[2:01:06] first corinthians 14 39 wherefore
[2:01:09] brothers covet to prophesy
[2:01:11] we are a cabinet prophecy
[2:01:14] amen and forbid not to speak in tongues
[2:01:17] but let everything be done in decency
[2:01:19] and order
[2:01:22] now the bride is the last sign the sign
[2:01:25] has to have a voice
[2:01:27] you can only hear what the sign is
[2:01:29] saying if it has a voice
[2:01:32] a voice without a sign is a sign with no
[2:01:35] meaning
[2:01:37] put a sign out there nothing on it
[2:01:40] has no meaning
[2:01:42] amen a sign without a meaning is a sign
[2:01:44] without purpose
[2:01:46] if it's then it's a false sign
[2:01:49] it's thunder without lightning a cloud
[2:01:51] without water
[2:01:57] now i'm not railing against the
[2:01:59] backsliding of the methodists and the
[2:02:00] baptists and the pentecostal
[2:02:03] neither am i at all trying to return to
[2:02:06] zoos of pentecostalism
[2:02:09] i am railing against messaged churches
[2:02:12] who are afraid of being pentecostal book
[2:02:16] of acts believers
[2:02:18] who deny the power of the gospel deny
[2:02:21] his power to heal so they deny prayer
[2:02:23] lines
[2:02:24] and pretended to be spiritual
[2:02:27] because now they believe in the third
[2:02:29] pull of the speaking of the words you
[2:02:31] see that's how we do it now you know i
[2:02:33] just wish you would use it
[2:02:41] well we we don't lay hands now we we got
[2:02:44] spoken word well use it
[2:02:49] why are the sick still laying why are
[2:02:51] the why are the needs not met
[2:02:54] why aren't you using what you're
[2:02:56] claiming to have that's something
[2:02:58] greater
[2:03:04] and then turn around and deny mark 16
[2:03:08] and the great commission
[2:03:14] i wish you'd use it like i said i've had
[2:03:16] the miraculous happen when speaking the
[2:03:17] word
[2:03:19] absolutely
[2:03:20] amen but miracles still happen when we
[2:03:23] lay hands on the sick
[2:03:24] you can't put god in a box
[2:03:27] and i happen to be commissioned by jesus
[2:03:30] christ himself to lay hands on the sick
[2:03:33] and they shall recover
[2:03:37] amen
[2:03:38] but
[2:03:39] brother brother tim jesus didn't have
[2:03:42] prayer lines it's not in the bible
[2:03:44] you're mistaken
[2:03:45] or a willful unbeliever if you think
[2:03:48] that
[2:03:50] you'd
[2:03:53] you don't think people lined up to have
[2:03:55] jesus pray for them
[2:03:58] really
[2:04:00] don't deny the obvious
[2:04:04] if you saw jesus
[2:04:06] come on
[2:04:07] praying for the sick
[2:04:09] open the eyes of the blind and you were
[2:04:11] crippled
[2:04:12] would you not get in the line
[2:04:17] no prayer lines in the bible it's the
[2:04:19] obvious
[2:04:21] amen you see besides that all we have to
[2:04:24] do is remember the thousands of times
[2:04:27] that brother branham called for altar
[2:04:29] calls
[2:04:32] besides that jesus commissioned us to do
[2:04:36] it listen
[2:04:39] where did he commit lay hands on the
[2:04:41] sick
[2:04:42] they shall recover
[2:04:46] james 5 says
[2:04:48] if anybody is sick
[2:04:50] let them call the elders of the church
[2:04:52] as the call goes forth
[2:04:54] amen they shall anoint them with oil a
[2:04:57] type of the holy ghost
[2:04:59] anoint them with oil an action to cause
[2:05:01] a reaction
[2:05:03] and they in the prayer of faith shall
[2:05:04] save the sick and god shall raise them
[2:05:07] up and if he's committed sin they shall
[2:05:09] be forgiven
[2:05:11] there's a lot of things happen in a
[2:05:13] prayer line sin is forgiven
[2:05:16] demons drum out sickness go
[2:05:30] proving his word brother branham said if
[2:05:31] we can only see brother sister if you
[2:05:33] could touch him with that certain touch
[2:05:36] oh sick people i'm trying to i'm fixing
[2:05:38] to pray for you just in a few minutes i
[2:05:41] do believe i have the holy spirit no
[2:05:44] more holy spirit than you have right
[2:05:46] here out got out there
[2:05:48] these men have got here i don't have
[2:05:50] more holy ghost than you got
[2:05:55] hallelujah
[2:05:57] i'm here today and i have as much holy
[2:05:59] ghost as brother branham had he said i
[2:06:02] did
[2:06:03] he said i don't have more than you
[2:06:06] you got as much as me
[2:06:08] and that goes forever brother sister
[2:06:11] every young person everyone that's got
[2:06:12] it
[2:06:13] amen oh if you can only realize just one
[2:06:17] touch of god
[2:06:18] he don't have no well heavy spots
[2:06:21] a little weak spot one touch of god is
[2:06:24] omnipotent
[2:06:25] [Applause]
[2:06:27] hallelujah
[2:06:33] these the same holy spirit
[2:06:36] but it's a commandment of god
[2:06:39] and if you believe that to be the
[2:06:41] commandment of god of praying for the
[2:06:44] sick and laying hands on them and
[2:06:46] casting out evil spirits and the
[2:06:47] promises he has made it'll be the same
[2:06:50] with you you'll get what you ask for if
[2:06:52] you can believe it
[2:06:55] commissioned by god
[2:06:58] can't stop believe i'm able to do this
[2:07:00] jesus said to
[2:07:01] jairus
[2:07:02] remember he's a secret believer afraid
[2:07:05] afraid somebody would find out he really
[2:07:07] believed that jesus was a messiah
[2:07:09] yeah lord i believe and the man with the
[2:07:12] child with the epilepsy said i believe
[2:07:14] you are the son of god that's come in
[2:07:16] the world oh
[2:07:17] now that they that can come only take
[2:07:20] that attitude to bring the results
[2:07:24] that attitude
[2:07:25] is what it takes the attitude
[2:07:30] amen if you can set an attitude while
[2:07:33] i'm preaching the word you could be
[2:07:34] healed
[2:07:37] while i'm preaching the word you can
[2:07:39] receive the holy ghost
[2:07:41] hey man you know what when i was
[2:07:43] listening when when sister atlanta there
[2:07:46] was sitting up there in the mezzanine
[2:07:48] sick
[2:07:49] after taking chemo lost all her hair
[2:07:53] sitting back there with a mask on
[2:07:55] because of immune um
[2:07:58] what do you call it depressed immunity
[2:08:01] anyway she's sitting back there heard me
[2:08:03] preach about a bible god a bible
[2:08:06] jesus a bible promise and we're bible
[2:08:10] days and we've got a bible god who does
[2:08:13] bible healings and bible miracles
[2:08:18] hallelujah and as i was preaching now
[2:08:21] that word settled down in her heart and
[2:08:24] there i see we begin to sing leaning on
[2:08:27] the everlasting arm up she jumped and
[2:08:30] run around the building
[2:08:33] healed by the glory of god
[2:08:36] what was it while peter spoke these
[2:08:38] words
[2:08:40] the holy ghost came on them
[2:08:43] but it was not without sensation or
[2:08:46] emotion for they spoke in tongues and
[2:08:48] prophesied
[2:08:50] they don't like to read the rest of that
[2:08:54] there was a reaction there was a
[2:08:56] strength come from el shaddai
[2:08:59] there was something happened
[2:09:07] now quickly think of him a moment
[2:09:09] here he's on his road up little priest
[2:09:11] come down no doubt little fellow was a
[2:09:13] borderline believer there's many of them
[2:09:15] in the world today little born again
[2:09:17] borderline believers they want to
[2:09:19] believe that they want to believe the
[2:09:20] holy ghost is real they want to believe
[2:09:22] that this is the apostolic move as god
[2:09:24] promised in the last days he'll pour out
[2:09:26] his spirit he wants to believe malachi 4
[2:09:29] they promised the last day the original
[2:09:31] pentecost of faith would be restored
[2:09:33] back to the church again
[2:09:35] we got to have a message and bring the
[2:09:37] people out of these denominational
[2:09:39] conditions back to the original genuine
[2:09:42] pentecostal faith and we're seeing it
[2:09:45] done it's fulfilling a scripture and
[2:09:48] that has to come all scriptures must be
[2:09:51] fulfilled
[2:09:54] so jesus commanded us
[2:09:57] to pray for the sick and lay hands on
[2:09:59] them
[2:10:02] i don't care what you say out there
[2:10:04] we're going to have a prayer line at
[2:10:06] youth camp
[2:10:10] all your criticism
[2:10:13] oh you're calling it pentecostalism
[2:10:15] it ain't going to stop it
[2:10:18] we're going to have all to toss
[2:10:20] we're going to see the power of god move
[2:10:23] we're going to see the holy ghost get
[2:10:24] down
[2:10:27] i don't care what you say
[2:10:29] you don't stop me one bit
[2:10:32] i don't listen to the gospel of unbelief
[2:10:35] remember but i'm strong in the faith am
[2:10:38] i praising god already forever miracle
[2:10:41] ever healing ever delivered every
[2:10:44] salvation everyone filled with the holy
[2:10:46] ghost and the power of god
[2:10:51] hallelujah
[2:10:54] and said hallelujah
[2:11:03] praise the lord
[2:11:06] so if jesus commanded us to pray for the
[2:11:08] sick and lay hands on them
[2:11:11] and more one
[2:11:12] more than one comes that's a line
[2:11:16] a prayer line
[2:11:18] a line of people coming from prayer
[2:11:20] so why deny the people of god the rights
[2:11:23] to the blessings of god
[2:11:26] why do we want to be that backslid
[2:11:29] in message churches
[2:11:31] that deny the obvious
[2:11:34] of god and the commission he gave us
[2:11:37] god has equipped us for every battle
[2:11:40] we have got to take the limits off of
[2:11:42] god
[2:11:45] oh god help me i could preach three
[2:11:47] hours today
[2:11:50] thank you
[2:11:52] i hope you could say that at the end of
[2:11:53] three hours
[2:11:56] god has equipped us for every battle
[2:11:59] we've got to take the limits off of god
[2:12:02] abraham staggered not at the promise of
[2:12:04] god was but was strong in the faith
[2:12:09] oh the bible says in psalm 78 40 how
[2:12:12] often they provoke him in the wilderness
[2:12:15] and grieve him in the desert
[2:12:17] yay and turn back and tempted god and
[2:12:19] limited and limited and limited the holy
[2:12:22] one of israel
[2:12:25] they remembered not his hand nor the day
[2:12:28] when he delivered them from the enemy
[2:12:30] how he wrote his signs in egypt his
[2:12:32] wonders in the fields of sowing and turn
[2:12:34] their rivers in the blood and their
[2:12:36] floods that they could not drink and he
[2:12:38] goes on and on and on telling what god
[2:12:41] did and what god did but in the time of
[2:12:44] testing
[2:12:45] they forgot
[2:12:50] and limited
[2:12:52] the holy one
[2:12:54] of israel
[2:13:00] we're being tested too
[2:13:04] this is testing time
[2:13:06] and we've got to take the limits off of
[2:13:08] god
[2:13:10] watch tiger at the promise
[2:13:13] why not do like abraham and give praise
[2:13:15] to god
[2:13:19] oh
[2:13:21] you can hear sarah
[2:13:23] you can see her sarah thinking you know
[2:13:25] she laughs at it she just
[2:13:27] at first it's just funny it's just so
[2:13:30] ridiculous it's funny
[2:13:32] she just kind of giggles at it you know
[2:13:34] when she hears about it
[2:13:37] when elohim stands right there and
[2:13:39] begins to call her by name
[2:13:42] tell her you know that she's going to
[2:13:44] have a child about this time of year
[2:13:46] you're going to bring forth a child
[2:13:49] it's too hard to believe
[2:13:51] right
[2:13:52] why abraham and i have been dead for
[2:13:55] years now
[2:13:57] so as the church
[2:14:00] it's too impossible
[2:14:02] well my breasts could never get milk
[2:14:04] i don't have the strength to carry a
[2:14:07] baby much less birth one
[2:14:11] the power is gone we haven't had revival
[2:14:14] in years
[2:14:16] besides that their quotes it says
[2:14:18] revival is over that was the healing
[2:14:20] revival but the bride's revival is still
[2:14:22] on
[2:14:24] come on church brother branham told us
[2:14:27] in the invisible union
[2:14:28] right before he leaves us he said to
[2:14:30] move his own for the pride that's just
[2:14:33] saith the lord
[2:14:35] amen hallelujah he said it there in
[2:14:38] birth pains he said they say you can't
[2:14:40] have an old holy ghost revival he said
[2:14:43] you can have one in yourself
[2:14:53] my breasts can never get milk
[2:14:56] i just don't have the strength i
[2:14:58] the power is gone i don't have faith for
[2:15:01] that i mean goodness gracious you know i
[2:15:03] once believed i could but no you know a
[2:15:06] long time ago i gave up on that and then
[2:15:09] i gave over to the bonds woman and they
[2:15:11] said let her do it
[2:15:14] that's the way we want it today we want
[2:15:16] the bombs well it's okay for them to
[2:15:18] have a miracle
[2:15:20] it's okay for them to have their prayer
[2:15:22] answer it's okay for an angel to appear
[2:15:25] to hey guard ishmael
[2:15:29] but we're we're past all of that we're
[2:15:31] we're too we're too frail to believe
[2:15:38] brother ron said something about an
[2:15:40] angel lord in this in there and a woman
[2:15:42] comes to your pastor and said i don't
[2:15:44] believe in angels of god now that only
[2:15:46] happened in brother branham's ministry
[2:15:53] we got the word
[2:15:55] we got ishmael
[2:15:56] we got the word we got the word of
[2:15:58] promise that's ishmael
[2:16:00] all the promises already been fulfilled
[2:16:03] it's too hard to believe
[2:16:05] we gave up a long time ago thinking we
[2:16:07] can have an experience with god
[2:16:10] this is impossible
[2:16:12] power of god living on us till we speak
[2:16:14] in other tongues
[2:16:16] why 99 of message believers have never
[2:16:19] had a supernatural experience like that
[2:16:22] we put that out along we grew past that
[2:16:25] we're we're beyond now
[2:16:30] the desire for the supernatural
[2:16:32] is long gone
[2:16:36] abraham and i
[2:16:38] we don't even have a love affair anymore
[2:16:41] there there's no pleasure with my lord
[2:16:44] we we're just content with the child of
[2:16:46] the bones woman and just going to church
[2:16:49] and believing the message and saying
[2:16:51] brother branham's a prophet and that's
[2:16:53] all we know about the holy ghost
[2:16:58] i'm too old
[2:17:00] well i could never feel a baby kick
[2:17:04] i
[2:17:05] i couldn't put up with that disturbing
[2:17:07] me
[2:17:08] jumping and dancing and shouting in my
[2:17:11] womb
[2:17:15] my nerves are shot
[2:17:18] i don't want none of them screaming
[2:17:20] hollering blabbering acts 238 miserable
[2:17:23] creatures
[2:17:24] why the noise of that makes me nervous
[2:17:27] an old-fashioned sanctified holy
[2:17:30] ghost-filled child born of the spirit of
[2:17:32] god screaming hollering shouting
[2:17:34] praising god
[2:17:36] that would upset church order here
[2:17:45] granny
[2:17:48] i'm too set in my ways by now
[2:17:52] it might keep me up at night praying
[2:17:56] a baby like that might just keep me up
[2:17:57] at night praying
[2:17:59] it might turn my church into an
[2:18:01] all-night prayer meeting and i gotta
[2:18:04] re-run on television program on youtube
[2:18:07] to watch tonight
[2:18:12] a true modern picture amid a true
[2:18:15] picture of the modern church today
[2:18:16] neither does the modern church want any
[2:18:18] of these screaming shouting tongues
[2:18:21] speaking acts 2 38 youngins around her
[2:18:24] yeah yeah yeah she don't want any of
[2:18:26] them hooping and crying and screaming
[2:18:28] amen hallelujah
[2:18:32] i'm too old for that
[2:18:35] we don't know mention around here
[2:18:36] goodness knowing
[2:18:38] jesus
[2:18:42] the promised son
[2:18:44] is ushered out of his own church
[2:18:47] and they fulfill the prophecy of
[2:18:50] revelation 3
[2:18:52] with him knocking trying to get in
[2:18:55] and he finally has to say get out of
[2:18:57] there
[2:19:04] he considered not his body now dead nor
[2:19:06] the deadness of sarah's womb
[2:19:09] her name
[2:19:10] i want you to get this
[2:19:13] her name had been associated with
[2:19:15] baroness a long time
[2:19:19] that barren woman
[2:19:22] that's not your name anymore sarah
[2:19:26] i'm talking to you
[2:19:28] barren woman is not your name anymore
[2:19:32] hallelujah princess is your name
[2:19:35] mother of a new race
[2:19:38] amen a mother of a supernatural child
[2:19:42] who didn't come from my husband's
[2:19:44] strength but from resurrection power
[2:19:47] amen our name isn't barren anymore we
[2:19:51] are not the mother of stillborn babies
[2:19:55] who claim the message and their lives
[2:19:57] are still dead in sins
[2:20:00] amen while in israel
[2:20:02] you remember
[2:20:03] we couldn't go to the golan heights when
[2:20:05] we visited there timothy and i brother
[2:20:08] donnie rage and some others
[2:20:10] mike walls was there kind of organized
[2:20:12] it for us
[2:20:14] we couldn't go to the golan heights
[2:20:18] and so as a surprise our guide
[2:20:21] took us to shiloh
[2:20:24] and in shiloh
[2:20:26] i prayed
[2:20:27] specifically for women in our church
[2:20:32] sister karen and i bought each of them a
[2:20:34] token
[2:20:36] from shiloh in a commemoration of that
[2:20:38] prayer
[2:20:41] i prayed i wept we were a group of
[2:20:44] ministers men and women some of their
[2:20:46] wives and some single people
[2:20:49] but we were there
[2:20:50] and we prayed they asked me to pray
[2:20:53] i was so broke and so moved by the
[2:20:55] moment
[2:20:57] of hannah's prayer being answered
[2:21:00] and i thought
[2:21:01] i thought of the needs that we had
[2:21:05] my daughter bethany
[2:21:06] who wanted another child
[2:21:09] who suffered four miscarriages one after
[2:21:12] another
[2:21:14] and today
[2:21:16] we got little brook
[2:21:18] our beautiful little princess
[2:21:23] then there was candace who was barren i
[2:21:26] called her name at silo
[2:21:28] and when brother bro ron preached if you
[2:21:30] remember
[2:21:31] he was preaching take it back
[2:21:34] you remember he said to brother
[2:21:36] brother andrew as he passed by and said
[2:21:39] the baby's coming
[2:21:41] it's coming
[2:21:43] and dead seed came to life
[2:21:51] hallelujah
[2:21:53] and today we have baby abigail elise
[2:21:57] chestnut
[2:21:58] abigail means calls of joy father's joy
[2:22:04] is the hebrew name
[2:22:06] and elise means god's promise
[2:22:10] god's promise brings
[2:22:12] a father's joy
[2:22:16] hallelujah what a cause of joy
[2:22:18] i'm telling you what a cause of joy
[2:22:21] amen god said to abraham name your son
[2:22:24] isaac
[2:22:26] laughter
[2:22:29] name him laughter
[2:22:31] i don't believe that god was punishing
[2:22:33] abraham to name your son laughter cause
[2:22:35] you fell on your face and laughed and
[2:22:37] the and sarah laughed i don't believe it
[2:22:40] because she giggled and laughed because
[2:22:41] it was a ridiculous promise of an old
[2:22:44] woman having pleasure with her husband
[2:22:46] again
[2:22:47] i believe it was because god had made
[2:22:50] them to life at the fulfillment of the
[2:22:53] promise
[2:22:54] god had brought a promise to pass
[2:22:58] hallelujah they could laugh at the devil
[2:23:02] come on now who said it would never
[2:23:04] happen who said god ain't big enough
[2:23:09] hallelujah but they didn't know the
[2:23:12] power of the milk
[2:23:14] the light seeds and milk or they'll set
[2:23:17] eye
[2:23:18] hallelujah they didn't know about when
[2:23:21] they received that milk
[2:23:26] it would bring resurrection life
[2:23:31] oh
[2:23:34] i can think of the scarners

[2:36:51] walk down here david dexter
[2:36:57] my wife was here i'd call her for god
[2:36:59] healing the blind eyes
[2:37:02] but she got better eyes now over in
[2:37:04] another land the greater healing
[2:37:07] this man right here went on a cruise
[2:37:11] got some kind of
[2:37:13] problem emergency situation in his
[2:37:16] eyes they went there to
[2:37:19] try to determine what it was nothing
[2:37:21] worked
[2:37:24] he went over 30 times the specialist
[2:37:28] this report he sat there looking around
[2:37:32] at all the other clients that was
[2:37:33] waiting on the doctor and he said i was
[2:37:35] the youngest
[2:37:38] they had several people with serious eye
[2:37:40] problems people recovering from surgery
[2:37:43] so then there was
[2:37:44] me i looked normal others had bandages
[2:37:49] patches some visible way they could see
[2:37:51] them
[2:37:53] the specialist ran several tests on his
[2:37:55] eyes
[2:37:57] did a real cool looking 3d scan of his
[2:37:59] cornea
[2:38:00] but they couldn't find anything
[2:38:03] when he scanned
[2:38:05] the corner he saw some
[2:38:07] kind of scarring it was like his body
[2:38:09] had fought off some kind of virus he
[2:38:11] went for blood work it was tested for
[2:38:14] seven different time things he tested
[2:38:17] positive
[2:38:19] for an
[2:38:20] immune disorder a genetic
[2:38:22] immune disorder that attacks the body
[2:38:25] h l a b 27 just a name for a devil
[2:38:33] my doctors worry that
[2:38:36] a very high percentage of people with
[2:38:38] [Music]
[2:38:41] and click locate spun diatitis
[2:38:46] a kind of degenerating spinal issue how
[2:38:50] this protein is found in your white
[2:38:51] blood cells
[2:38:53] it's when you're
[2:38:54] if it's out of whack your immune system
[2:38:56] literally starts attacking your own body
[2:38:58] the scar in the body and in the eye that
[2:39:01] felt was coming from that
[2:39:04] he went to pick up his prescription and
[2:39:06] mending at walgreens the pharmacist come
[2:39:09] over and say what's wrong with you
[2:39:12] and then proceeded to tell him there's
[2:39:13] only one other person in town that's on
[2:39:15] this stronger prescription
[2:39:18] they're losing their hair the skin
[2:39:19] pigment
[2:39:20] and it was just the medicines just
[2:39:23] slowing down their inevitable early
[2:39:25] death
[2:39:26] and he said what a faith booster that
[2:39:28] was
[2:39:31] so he said to a
[2:39:32] rheumatologist who
[2:39:34] did x-rays and joint tests
[2:39:37] they came back clean he said well
[2:39:39] they're clean now but with your
[2:39:40] reoccurring i arrived
[2:39:43] that inflammation of the cornea in the
[2:39:46] presence of that hla
[2:39:48] b27 you'll have to come back every year
[2:39:52] from here on out
[2:39:54] so it went over 30 times to different
[2:39:56] times to different specialists
[2:40:00] and the end and so
[2:40:03] right before youth camp he started
[2:40:05] backing off the medicine a little bit he
[2:40:07] went to the prayer line
[2:40:09] at youth camp
[2:40:10] with a prayer cloth that was sent to him
[2:40:12] by his dad that he would place over his
[2:40:14] eyes and
[2:40:15] he's really struggled to find faith
[2:40:22] and he felt an unknown cause that
[2:40:26] he let this unknown cause cause him
[2:40:28] entirely too much worry
[2:40:30] and then the specialist began to hone in
[2:40:32] on what he believed was root cause
[2:40:35] finding it might be genetic didn't help
[2:40:36] at all
[2:40:38] so he got that prayer cloth he got to
[2:40:40] thinking about his heritage
[2:40:42] i think we ought to think about our
[2:40:44] heritage
[2:40:45] about what god's done in our generation
[2:40:47] and my heritage of faith
[2:40:50] it was like he
[2:40:51] reached the lowest point and it was
[2:40:53] uphill from there
[2:40:55] it went through the prayer line for
[2:40:56] healing
[2:40:58] after youth camp he testified i'm healed
[2:41:00] he still had eye issues on and off
[2:41:04] he could actually feel the ironite is
[2:41:06] coming and he would he would pop a bunch
[2:41:09] of
[2:41:10] ibuprofen pretty quick and it would go
[2:41:11] away and naughty would just keep getting
[2:41:13] worse until his eye would turn red he'd
[2:41:15] have to go back on steroids
[2:41:18] but one service
[2:41:20] this is what he testified
[2:41:22] but there came an end
[2:41:27] [Music]

[2:41:32] of your problem

[2:41:56] whatever name the devil wants to put on
[2:41:58] it
[2:42:05] he heard it
[2:42:07] the voice of god speak to him at the end
[2:42:09] of the service he was helping with sound
[2:42:12] up there see you can be in the sound
[2:42:14] booth and it happened
[2:42:16] mezzanine and it happened

[2:42:22] the mothers
[2:42:24] it can happen there
[2:42:28] but sitting there up up in the
[2:42:31] up in the top there
[2:42:33] he heard the voice of god speak to him
[2:42:35] if you go for prayer you'll be healed
[2:42:38] and he acted on that
[2:42:41] walking down for prayer and after the
[2:42:42] service
[2:42:44] his eye would drop a little bit but it
[2:42:45] kept getting better and better now it's
