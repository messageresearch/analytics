glad for that this morning amen amen my goodness i can sing because i'm happy i can sing because i'm free he that the son is set free is free indeed amen i believe we are free people this morning amen free from the bondage of sin unbelief of the ages when all the wickedness of the ages is piled up into this age and you can say i'm free from it satan has come and he has found no part in me these are the words of jesus got to be said of a bride in this last day she's going into rapture you believe that a man without spot without a wrinkle without a blemish because he said so sometimes maybe we can't see it exactly that way but he said it and we know it's the truth amen you've got a need this morning just hold it before the lord and raise your hand to god and say jesus don't pass me by i need you today we just come my way father as we approach your throne of grace it is there we find help in our time of need we're thankful lord it's there we find favor favor divine favor favor that we didn't work for grace that we didn't do anything to achieve on our own but it was your mercy mercy that endures i ask lord your blessings upon us today you'd anoint our hearts lord to believe to receive every divine promise of yours i asked father for healing for your children there were those that lifted a hand to you and said i need you jesus i need you i just pray you'll pass their weight today lord the chills walk down these aisles lord you'll step aside to a few you'll speak to a heart and reveal lord your god you're the same yesterday today and forever lord we still believe oh god and we have seen your hand work your hand of mercy is great your grace is sufficient i ask father for those with lost loved ones lord that you'd save them those lord that are struggling with issues within their lives lord maybe their marriage their home their families something going on lord you'll speak to them lord today you'll deal with them in a personal way because you're a personal savior and a person of god lord make no difference what the situation is you're able you're bigger than that and i asked that you would do it lord our brother timothy's away ministering up in saskatoon saskatchewan today finishing up convention there i pray lord you'll bless him in a mighty way lord bring him home safely brother joe will be ministering out next weekend lord i pray that you'll use him in a mighty way lord that you'll send out lights from evening like tabernacle lights in a dark dying world to herald the coming of the messiah jesus christ lord we want to thank you for the messenger you sent this day thank you lord for the prophet that brought us a message and it's the message it's forerunning your second coming we're part of that second coming lord as you come in bride form first before we meet you in the air in the groom form or you may you be manifest fully in your body of your people today i pray that you'd anoint us as you've done now many many times but lord we we don't take that for granted we come lord praying humbly believe in expecting that as we read this scripture that you'll just step right in make us an oracle of god what good would it do for us to say our own thoughts and our own words lord we want your thoughts to be manifested today and we thank you lord for the expression of your thoughts in this day lord where you expressed them to the seventh angel through the messenger of god lord but oh god we know father that you're still speaking in your people for you said the you said through that messenger the voice of god is in the bride she knows what you want done with the word and you want your word lived and believed and acted upon and we're here lord to do that father we stand in this pulpit to preach because you commissioned us to do it you said go into all the world and preach the gospel paul then would commission us then brother branham would commission us we're here obeying what you said to do lord and we see the signs following them that believe we see souls that are saved sick that are healed lord demons cast out the power of god manifested we see lord you're this you're declaring yourself alive with infallible proofs of your resurrection lord see in your holy spirit move upon these young men and women a moment ago rejoicing and shouting and dancing there in their pew lord we thank you that the sound of victory is still among us we're not a dead church a morgue but oh god we're people that are alive with the power of the holy ghost and we have even young people that have come to know you in the power of your resurrection and it's not just the young but it's the old it's all of us the middle age whoever we are father because you're calling a people in this last day we're the ordained of god to be here chosen for this moment in time in this last lay age of laodicea father we thank you that the mysteries have been finished we thank you lord that the voice of god has spoken to us the thunders have revealed the earth and spoke their voices to a prophet is not our message it's your message lord it wasn't even his message it was your message it's the message of jesus christ to the laodicean church age and i pray oh god that we'll hear what the spirit says to the church you'll anoint our hearts to receive our ears to hear and then for us to be a doer of the word we ask it in jesus name amen and amen god bless you let's turn to john chapter 3 and verse 1 for our scripture reading this morning we want to just welcome you all in the wonderful name of the lord jesus christ amen brother jerome it's good to see you here this morning god bless you been through a battle with his health but you know brother jerome was one of our first deacons he actually is um the the only one of our first deacons is still serves he's an honorary deacon now we appreciate brother jerome he's been a faithful servant amen been a human sister linda has been a blessing to our church through the years and the betts family we appreciate them all and amen good to see the chandler's is back there from the nelsons god bless you nice to have you in the service today and and you know i i thought about it the other day february the 1st 1970 52 years ago i preached my first sermon in a little blocker's chapel amen and you know i never knew where that sermon would take me to as a 15 year old boy preacher but we've been around the world and back a few times not preaching our own message god sent a message in this day and vindicated it and showed it was the truth we thank god for the seventh angel and his message we don't believe in any other message amen we believe that is to be the truth that it is the gospel of jesus christ not a new gospel but the very thing that jesus brought in and paul brought and peter brought we've been restored back to that and it's from that restoration that we have something to minister from otherwise we'd be lost in a sea of confusion today amen but god rich in mercy has has sent uh the evening light where he said in the evening time it shall be light so we thank god for the message god sent us let's go to john chapter 3 and verse 1. i i've got lots of places to go today in the word and so um as you know we uh we discontinued our sunday night services and put two into one so we sing a little longer preach a little longer and you know if um you get weary and have to go well that's fine we'll just preach until the lord nudges us and said okay you got it amen i pray that you'll just enter in this morning amen let god speak to your heart john chapter 3 and verse 1 there was a man of the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of the jews the same came to jesus by night and said unto him rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from god for no man can do these miracles that thou doest accept god be with him and jesus answered and said unto him verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god nicodemus nicodemus said unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born and jesus answered verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god that which is born of the flesh is flesh that which is born of the spirit of spirit marvel not i said unto thee ye must be born again the wind bloweth where it lifts us and thou hears the sound thereof but cannot tell whence it cometh and whether it goeth so is everyone that is born of the spirit and then i'd like to turn over to first peter chapter 1 and verse 23 just one verse and then you can be seated being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of god which liveth and abideth forever god bless you as you're seated and we're going to share with you a little quotation from the spoken word is original seed from where we will take our sermon text this morning and said as the end time prophecies will repeat i believe as the first forerunner came from the wilderness and cried behold the lamb of god the second forerunner will probably do the same by pointing the people to a word-born bride and the bride of christ will be pointed to the skies at the appearing of jesus scream and behold the lamb of god will come forth from his lips god help us to be ready for that near event and and then again in the spoken word's original seed he said all sons all of god's sons must be the same yes sir to be born of the word and the spirit brings us back to the spoken word again like in john 3 to be born of the water and the spirit what does it do then it brings you right back unto the place where you should have been at the beginning see that's the reason of christ's death to brings us back again to where sons of god so we're going to be speaking this morning taking my text from that statement brother branham was pressed to put up on his pen to write by the holy spirit where he said that the that the second forerunner will probably do the same by pointing the people to a word born bride so we're going to be speaking on a word born bride or a bride born of the word all right so there is to be a message that is that that comes in this day that we are to be born of the full word of god now the full birth could not come to the full word king because for example in luther's day they had a partial poor a revelation of the new birth it was not as it was in the book of acts where they received the holy ghost it was a portion as they were in their restoration and they were justified by faith but it was for that time the accepted way but then god would come along with another message or another further part of his word which would be sanctification and in sanctification there again would be another part that would be required to the new birth and that is to be justified and sanctified those old uh holiness people of the methodist age they shouted and rejoiced as they were sanctified by the holy ghost and the old habits of the world will be taken off and the priests without holiness shall no man see the lord but you know they did like everyone else has done they cabbage down on that and they went no further brother branham used that term cabbage down and they would go no further and they would make a denomination out of that they would set that this is all of it and god would move beyond that and he would in 1906 he would pour out his spirit some more and again now men and women would be baptized with the holy ghost in a and as it moved and and upon men's spirits and they rejoiced and they uh spoke in other tongues and did many many um manifestations of the spirit of god at that time and rejoiced as the lord would now show them again that there was a great um a great move of god and a furtherance even to the great new birth that they were experiencing now they would they would preach that you must be justified and sanctified and they were being filled with the spirit for that time they were they were actually in that moment of baptized into the body of gifts and they would manifest great gifts of the spirit but you see it was a partial word and with a partial word comes a parcel birth in the message the birth pains brother branham tells us that there is to be a new birth according to malachi 4. so again when the fullness of the word comes it brings us into the fullness of the new birth not just a an anointing upon us as the azusa people received but but now not just the spirit realm refreshed and and men shout or dance and and whatever but now it comes down into the very nature of man where the token the holy ghost is now applied not not a gift of the spirit but the spirit himself you see um it was the literal life of jesus christ returning back to the church and so with um there again it this brings us back to the place where we should have been at the beginning where that man fell away from god all the way back to from from genesis now i just like to go to james chapter 1 and verse 17 and he tells us that every good and perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the father of lights no to notice the words father of lights say that with me father of lights and with whom there is no bearableness neither shadow or turning and all of his own will begat here so he's a father and now out of his own will not the will of the flesh or that of man which comes by the sexual birth but the will of god amen and so he out of his own will he begat he us with the word of truth so again we are begotten of the word notice there with a message every message that has come down from in the restoration as it started back actually that was truly a reformation from the reformation forward every work of every work of grace came out of a message of truth now so again it would be that out of the word of truth out of his own will begat he us with the word of truth that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures now this this means of first fruits that uh a create a new creation a new species one that there hasn't been like you know in thousands of years because we've had all the way down from um from the book of acts till now we we saw a fallen away of the church and and there would be a hybrid church in hybrid members there was not the original seed that's why it would take a profit in this day to turn our hearts back to the original faith so that out of this word he would be get children amen sons and daughters of god and and for god then to be the father of lights there has to be then little lights little pillar of fires that are begotten out of him remember brother brown said the pillar fire has nothing to do with me he said you know every one of you have that pillar of fire it is it is your it is the lick of fire from the holy ghost that's what he did on the day of pentecost the father of lights came and from the pillar of fire came licks of fire and 120 were filled with the holy ghost so every son of god is a light of god they have a portion of that god together we we make up the body of christ collectively we may we are not individually the body but collectively we are the body amen so again for god to be the father of lights there had to be little lights little pillars of fire that's what brother branham said in the uh the messiah then when god was made flesh and became the messiah if we can yield ourselves to be anointed like he was we become messiah's little lights that's what the church is to be light little anointed ones that's god's church his standing light is the light of the messiah risen christ in his people the anointed ones caring for this light into all the church ages sometimes it goes almost completely out then it comes back again god's anointed when god's anointed a messianic church if messiah means the anointed one means the king then if the church is anointed by the messiah spirit it becomes a lesser but still the messiah because it has his life reflecting his power reflecting his glory reflecting his dominion so it is messiah all how it reflects him in his kingdom in his domain now that's why that we are we are not looking for a messiah and neither are we followers of some personality cult we see the messiah among us amen he has been made flesh in his people a word born bride the bride of christ who is a woman must have a passionate faith to bring forth his life amen the the his seed the life of christ now as the end time prophecies repeat then there must be a woman who unites with the word to bring forth christ again to reproduce him remember he is a father of lights amen and he must have a church through which he reproduces himself amen now in galatians 4 and 19 paul would tell us you know of his message and what what he wanted to see it do he said my little children of whom i travail at birth again until christ be formed in you so he tells us there the church under his ministry was travailing in birth to form christ in the church amen to bring forth a baby to bring forth a child and that child would be of the holy ghost amen like mary was overshadowed by the holy ghost there would be a people in whom would be a spoken word a children of the word children of the prophecy that would be manifested upon the earth now paul would tell us in ii corinthians 11 and 2 about his jealousy and how he was trying to protect this woman and how that she must remain virtuous he said i'm jealous over you with a godly jealousy for i will espouse you to one husband now remember to to come from another husband would mean a hybrid child amen because it's not of the it's not at the covenant are you with me but he said i've espoused you to one husband that i might present you as a chaste virgin to christ but i fear now here's what his fear was that lest by any means as the serpent beguiled eve through his subtlety is so your mind should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ so that worm of your mind through whom to hook through which the seed has to descend through are you with me it has to be received in the mind taken into the heart and he said i'm afraid that your minds will be corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ that you will have a defiled wound now this would happen to the church because in the book of revelation it shows her as a and her daughters that come out of her just like her because her morals are passed on to her offspring is that right so as the end time prophecies repeat now let's let's go back in our thinking just for a moment unto the book of genesis because in the book of genesis it decreed every seed was to bring forth of its kind amen stay with me just for a little bit and we're just going to lay some foundation and we'll preach all right every seed was to bring forth of his kind kind after kind you see hybrids are not in the original in the in the book of leviticus 19 god charged israel keep my degrees do not make different kinds of animals and so he he he forbid the israelites of mating a donkey to horse that was forbidden because it was crossing the species are you with me and god is for original i made them like i wanted them i started the church like i wanted it and i'm going to have a church like i started amen amen i began it the way i wanted it and that's what i'm going to have in the end time i'm going to have one that is exactly like the original seed she won't be different she won't be across species she won't be an improved species she will be the exact same thing that there was in the original are you with me now now you go all the way back to genesis where man left god where adam's bride eve failed and through that broke forth twins we know she did she brought 14 and then again bear his brother abel but there but you see this it goes all the way back as end time prophecies repeat and we come back to the same place notice this every age has its chance at its own revival and in there they have a chance to be born back to the original and we stand at the same place in this day and hour of bride to come back to be born back to the original to be a people birth of the word not a corruptible seed but of incorruptible somebody with me now so it this time this time is endtime prophecies repeat there is a word born bride who defeats satan who turns down his lies who brings forth true sons of god amen the end time prophecies repeat we get another chance of this this time he will have a church and it will be a bride without defilement amen this church the gates of hell will not prevail against because it's built on the full revelation of who he is are you with me now although eve failed remember the bride is predestinated not to fall amen now they didn't say that we wouldn't quibble and wobble and make mistakes and and even brother branham said and proven his words that sometimes taunts christians holding things wrong believing they're right and you have and i have and we all have right and man there's been a lot of misunderstandings down the road amen but this bride is predestinated not to fall amen notice he said god made manifest in christ christ made manifest his bride as god took from the body of adam the woman and she failed god has took from the body of christ his flesh his body which is his word and is bringing a bride out that won't fall by the nomination her creed no sir but she's coming back with the pure unadulterated word of god being manifest she is the second eve see the prophecy is repeating but she's not she is not breaking and spoiling her skirts of purity and holiness or a husband she'll stay with this word regardless of what anybody says hallelujah that's god is going to achieve what he set out for and that is to have a family she will be called the lamb's wife her offspring will be begotten of him now adam was a spoken word seed he was an original seed a man this seed could not die it was immortal unless it became perverted and become hybrid by mixing another word other than what god said notice here you see as long as he stayed with the original word he was immortal but the moment it got mixed it produced hybrids and a hybrid life now this mortal life we know is a perverted life we are all born hybrids by our first birth remember this now let me just stop here just for a minute and explain something because you know under the old testament a a child that was um born out of wedlock that he was considered a bastard child he couldn't enter the congregation for ten generations eight or ten now why was that god was preparing a people for there to be a virgin to conceive so he put things in the word to prepare for that virgin coming are you with me gentiles didn't have that they met gentiles did not have that they they had shrine prostitutes in their religion that committed fornications and adulteries and and sex acts but you see again with israel it made very clear you know all the laws about about rape and incense and adultery and the stoning and everything else to eradicate sin out of israel by law are you with me but i want you to notice as we're saying that when it comes that to that it that does not apply in the new covenant you see under the old covenant they had one birth amen that's all they had was one birth and you had to be born in the lineage of abraham is that right amen it was the the covenant was for abraham's seed so you had to be born in his lineage amen so they only had one birth but that's not the way it is with this one amen we have a new birth now and that new birth it breathes out all the cup are you with me amen listen if the blood of jesus christ could not cleanse an illegitimate child who had no choice of his own on how he was brought and the blood of jesus christ did not have the power to remit that sin and make him where that he could be baptized with the holy ghost and go in a rapture then the blood of jesus christ is no more powerful than the blood of bulls and goats but i want you to know the blood of jesus christ it eradicates every sin sin amen no matter how you were born it don't matter what your mama did your daddy did or your grandparents and by the way you need to be able to go back 10 generations in order to be able to come into the congregation of the lord amen so you know pretty much all of us would have been out is that right and let me just say it even further that it would even be more no gentile could have been saved you'd have never found a virgin gentile amen that wasn't that was or a a gentile that was born of holy matrimony for ten generations you'd have never found them they had no moral codes they had no law they had no word of god but the holy ghost fell on them and gave them the same covenant that it did to jewish people now so let me just say this you know we are but we because of our first birth we were all born hybrid if i could say it brother branham's word we're all bastard born just quit holding your nose up at somebody else don't you dare do that in my presence yes i'll let you know who you are you're just like the rest of us you're hybrid you were born between and i'm going to read the quote between satan and eve a hybrid you've got a hybrid body hybrid flesh amen and let me tell you about sin sin is not a creation it is a perverted faith death is not a creation it's a perverted life so brother branham tells us there was never such thing as a creation of sin he said now that didn't go down good did it sin is not a creation no sir sin is a perversion there is only one creator and that's god sin is righteousness perverted what is adultery righteousness perverted what is a lie truth misrepresented what is a curse word god's blessing turned to a curse word to uh to god instead of a blessing sin is not a creation sin is a perversion so satan could not create sin he only perverted what god created that's exactly right death is only a perversion of life now think of that sin is not a creation that's why you see it's got to end it's only temporary it's got the sinful world has to come to an end because it's not a reasonable seed are you with me amen now the reason for the need for someone to be born again what's this now the first preaching of jesus you must be born again and the reason for this is because we were born hybrid now wait a minute he even told this to nicodemus who could trace his millennials backward all the way to abraham perhaps he he would tell nicodemus you must be born again you see it's for every person because no matter whether you're jew or whether you're greek whether you're gentile whether you're black whether you're white whether you're purple whatever your color is amen we were born hybrid and unable to breed ourselves back to life again once you mix the seed it can no longer go back to the original yes sir remember i remember years ago you know brother old brother chambliss well you know was out there with me and and was telling me about um the siege you know he said now this corn he said he said uh you it's hybrid he said but you plant it it'll make a crop up next year but the problem is it won't make the same thing the hybrid was it will not reproduce true that's right are you with me imagine so it's like it is a hybrid it it can never go back to its original okay because once it once it come back and no matter what you do you can never breed that back to the original grains that made it the you see the the the the hybrid cross now again every child born in the world is a product of the hybriding between satan and eve abel was not a hybrid in the sense that cain was came was the offspring of the serpent the bible said he was that wicked one but yet abel was born of the knowledge that the serpent brought eve and not as adam came by the spoken word so you see then seth was not born correctly either understand once once that sin entered you could not by natural breathing breathe yourself out now although that seth was born of the union of adam and eve he still was not the original seed he didn't come the way god or dang man to come he came with a life of death he would die on his altar now in genesis chapter 5 verse 1 you see this is the book of the generations of adam in the day god created man now wait a minute he created man in the likeness of god made he him so he was made in the likeness of god right male and female created he them and blessed him and called their name adam in the day when they were created and adam lived 130 years and began to son in what his own likeness after his image and call his name seth oh now you know maybe you're not careful you didn't think well now adam was in the image of god so you know now says in the image of god no adam is not in the image of god he's a fallen image so seth is born with a fallen nature he's not in the likeness of god he's not original seed he didn't come from the hand of god he didn't come from the word he didn't come by the spoken word he came from the knowledge that the serpent taught eve amen so he is a fallen likeness what image a fallen image he is not an immortal man he's a mortal man amen he's not a son of immortal life he's a son of mortal life so seth was not born in the likeness of god to be born of god required that a man be born through creation amen boy begotten of the spirit through the world notice this is what the new birth is being born again not a corruptible seed by the will of man because every man brings forth corruptible seed and man that will do every child lord is gonna die every sweetheart that takes their their sweetheart down to the altar one day one will be gone the other left till that one's gone that's the way it all ends it's a hybrid life now brother branham said in spoken words in order to see but he said every man no matter whether he's a pope now that's considered the holiest man in christianity priest that's a lower man in the catholic church a bishop that's in between man whatever he is he dies because he's a hybrid he was born between satan and eve they and they call it whatever you want to it was satan and eve the original word had nothing to do with it the original word was life and he had hybrid it and it brought death now we know satan is a spirit but he used the serpent a man not a snake but a subtle beast to the field and he would work through him he would talk through him and he would pre-crea he would procreate procreate through him are you with me now the bible said that i will put enmity between thee and between the serpent and his seed and thou and thy seed is that right so the bible is clear the serpent had a seed that's right amen and they and remember and remember when it comes down again there was these hybrids that jesus would say to them you are of your father the devil come on and then when he's on the cross there who bruised him was it man or was it snakes crawling on the ground you see the serpent seed was there but the problem of it is is we were all born hybrid serpent seed is not a race it's the human race and we're all born lost we're all born needing a savior and there's no true breeding and no true race out of the humans we traded with the jews and it didn't work [Applause] amen come on yeah amen i mean you know it there was but let me just tell you there there is another birth amen and that new birth will bring you back to the original hallelujah where you're part of the original breeding because you don't come by man and woman you come not by the will of man or by some preacher but you come amen from the hand of god the word spoken creates a bride hallelujah don't you know that's what god did in the seas he sent a message to do what to create a bride to call a people to himself [Applause] hybrid people and hybrid systems with hybrid religion and he called you out and re-birth you hallelujah aren't you glad in the sixth seal brother brandon said every man was born of sex after born after sexual desire he was in the original sin satan in eve so he could not do it he's talking about claiming the book no man was worthy this is why there was nothing in no holy pope priest dr divinity whatever he might be he was nobody worthy and he couldn't be an angel because it had to be a kinsman he had to be a man so that god himself become a kinsmen by taking on human flesh through the virgin birth jesus was not born a hybrid he came of the virgin it was not of the will of man nor the will of flesh but of god amen this is where john traces is beginning others talk about his human life and said you know here he comes and they trace him all the way back to abraham and they know him to adam but not john john the eagle says in the beginning what's the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word became flesh and dwelt among us hallelujah i want you to know he is the father a man of a new creation amen that old things are passed away and behold all things have become new [Applause] bear with me as i read this quotation from what shall i do with jesus called christ like by the same means that the mother eve corrupted the whole world to be to a physical death the mother eve listened mother e corrupted the whole human race by physical death by rejecting the word by accepting something almost like it she caused all physical death because she left the true word and believed the true word oh but just a little bit one little disagreement with the lord of god caused every heartache every death and everything's been on the earth eve done it the mother of death now you see where we're coming from the mother of death noticed she just disbelieved the word she said god has said satan said that's right god has said that's right god has said that's right god has said yes that's is that well in a way that's right you see but that isn't all of it see you'll have your eyes open and you'll be but god is set and that settles it it's the word see it just started just one little misconstruing of the word and the same thing is ending the same way notice a daughter is a product of the mother and a father by union now here's something shocking but death physical physical death is the uniting of mother eve and satan together by disbelieving god's word they united and brought forth the product of death death is the product of uniting satan and eve together notice now let me just interject again it's through the instrumentality of the serpent that he would use now you see eve had the word satan is against the word i look almost 99 and 99 hundredths of it satan admitted was right so close in the bible in the last days were to see the very elective it was possible see how it comes in it's always been how it's going up going out the same way united of unbelief in the full word of god you got it that's what brought death is uniting unbelief with the word unbelief just one little bitty part of it little bitty teeny bit 101 but it must be 100 that's all notice god's daughter the church the bride is also a product of god and his word united the holy spirit united in a body of flesh it produced the son of god a product of the righteousness of god and in the last days as we're told as it was in the days of sodom the bride will be united by the word made manifest in flesh the holy spirit sealing them unto god and seeing an unbelief out on the outside now think of it where when we have come to birth remember when they came to bring forth the seed adam and eve by the spoken word what happened here comes satan there to pervert the word to keep eve from the word birth is that right now when it come for israel to go into the land which the land typed the holy ghost amen justification called out of egypt sanctification to the wilderness baptism of the holy ghost the land are you with me amen so what happened at cadiz barnea what they do they went over there and said we can't take it we can't get the holy ghost we can't possess the promises of god we can't really be sons of god are you with me so brother branham called them borderline believers and he said when it comes to borderline come right up to that spot to receive the holy ghost for the new birth what did the devil do he come around and try to twist it around oh he'll do everything that's in his known power to keep the people out of there notice what do you do satan will do everything it is known power to keep the people out of there notice when when there was a deliver that was coming moses was going to lead the children of israel out and he's a baby that was born well satan was right there to destroy the seed come on amen then we come down to the days of jesus what happened just as soon as the announcement is made the child is born satan is right there the beast there to try to destroy it and brought through a vision through a dream sends them down to egypt to escape the wrath of herod is that right because he's right there to kill the child as soon as he was born hey remember remember now church that's why all the gates of hell is against us hallelujah are you with me amen that's why that we're we're in our awful age and horrible time it's cause satan is right there with all his darkness coming with his tree of knowledge taking our kids into school and brainwashing them against god with their liberal arts and all their other ideas of man and their evolution and everything to kill the faith of the children [Applause] because he's there to wipe out the seed hallelujah but in the same time god's got a word of perservation he's going to have a pride without splatter wrinkle amen there's a protection and a hedge around his children and he will burn them into the baptism of the holy ghost and there'll be a token applied for rapture amen the token is not a tape the token is not a book the token is the person of jesus christ the holy ghost and without it you're lost now so satan will do everything in his known power to keep people out of there so you know the very moment that you began to you know to see the holy spirit move altar calls being given young people giving the heart to god or people period giving their heart to god whether young or old surrendering the holy ghost coming upon them what we have satan coming along doing everything in his known power to try to keep that woman from birth now so you and notice what he'll do he will push them over to one side one side of intellectualism or to the other side of fanaticism he'll do anything to keep them within his known power to keep them out of there now satan had heard god say be fruitful and multiply replenish the earth so he takes god's word and he twisted using reason instead of supernatural faith he shows them how it can be done by works instead of the supernatural amen now you know god would show with isaac it ain't going to be through works your body is now dead god would wait until they could not do it on their own isaac would be a supernatural child that was born of the prophecy because he was portraying the new race would be born of the supernatural it would be not born of man's ability look how they've tried to do it you know they turn around every time you know a spiritual move comes and and then you know they do it they turn around justification by faith and they make it where you just come to the altar and shake your hand works they turn it from sanctification of a supernatural experience of god cleansing from habits and they turn it into works i jumped and i shouted or i joined the church pentecost did the same thing you know it started out a supernatural move but they turned it into a a a learned behavior word that beat them on the back and jiggle their chin till they manufacture the language they turn it into works instead of the supernatural amen you see you see what does it do it it brings a mixture a hybrid this is what it this is what ishmael was he was never the original seed god didn't even recognize him whatsoever and then he called him a wild man he won't be subject to anything i say ishmael was completely rejected am i because only the supernatural is god's offspring now so death came by what satan taught eve by putting a spin on the original word you talk about a spin doctor satan is one he will take the knowledge of the revelation and spin it and exalt it over the word they did it in paul's day you know paul peter said in ii peter 3 16 and he spoke about beloved paul according to wisdom given to him is written to you also in all his epistles speaking of these in them of these things ii peter 3 16 in which some things are hard to be understood which they that are unlearned and unstable rest twist as they do also the other scriptures unto their own destruction so here again the word was coming but right there as the word is coming here satan is there with with to twist you want to think sometimes it's all done in the pulpit now there's a lot of this stuff goes wrong with a tablet i met men twisting the words they were twisting the word the revelations brought by the apostle paul and bringing death with it paul himself spoke of hymenous and alexander who were destitute of true faith and he he had handed them over to satan that they learned not to blaspheme and distort the truth he's saying that word did eat the body away like a canker because they were saying the resurrection was passed and they were all by that overthrow in the faith of some you see their false teaching was deadly not just a disagreement over a minor part of doctrine they were teaching that the resurrection had already happened there's no doubt they were taking the spiritual application of the resurrection rather than to the ground until they did away with the literal resurrection amen spiritualizing something when it has a supernatural event perhaps they were you know they were teaching that the resurrection of the christian was not literal but merely a spiritual is symbolic resurrection that had already happened see you see there's the problem in every age we have the same pattern brother branham tells us in the church but he said that's why the light is given through some god-given messenger in a certain area and then from that messenger that spreads the light that spreads the light through the ministry of others notice this not just his ministry ministry of others spread the light amen and he said who have been faithfully chopped it's really important to get in the word to be faithfully it's not just important for the preacher it's important for you to get in the tapes to listen to the prophet of god to hear what the messenger said that so many people misled because they they quit listening they want to sleep on the pew somewhere but notice he said of course all those who go out don't always learn how necessary it is to speak only watson messenger said had spoken remember paul warned the people to say only what he said first corinthians 14 37 if any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that i write unto you are the commandments of the lord what came the word of god out from you came unto you only they add to they add here they take away there and soon the message is no longer pure and the revival dies down how careful we must be to hear one voice what is that voice it's the voice of the spirit amen for the spirit house but one voice which is the voice of god amen and paul warned them to say what he said even as peter did likewise he warned them that even he paul could not change one word of what he had been given by revelation oh how important it is to hear the voice of god by the way of his messenger and then say what has been given them to say to the churches so the ministry is to take what the prophet said and say it amen now but they must stay with what he that's right said doing that they didn't just get up and read paul's epistle they got up and preached peter or timothy preach the word get up and preach and rightly divide it minister from it these things that i have committed to you these mysteries he said commit them to faithful men amen and i'll tell you you know i tell you friends god's gonna have a a true ministry somewhere somebody that'll stay with the word of god hallelujah somebody didn't stand for truth in this hour somebody's gonna do it i talked to a man one time sat across from the table from him his son was a preacher and he said well i don't believe in preachers i said well i i believe you do he said no i don't believe in preachers you must not know me i don't believe in preachers and i said well i said i believe you do believe in preachers i said because i believe you're a child of god and god can't deny his word he said well brother jim there's just no nobody that's preaching truth ain't nobody right ain't nobody doing right ain't nobody i mean one's after money once that's the popularity one's after this one's after that ain't nobody right so i don't even believe it i said well i said you got a problem you got a problem with your god he's really many god he ain't able to keep his word i said he said i give unto the church apostles prophets teachers evangelist pastors for the perfecting of the church and you tell me god ain't big enough to do that amen if god said it god's going to do it you said but i see this way i don't care about your failures i don't care what you've seen i don't care what you think i mean the word of god is true jesus commits a man to preach the word and when paul commissioned him preach the word brother branham commissioners preach the word he ordained me and carry the word i don't care you look at the failures i tell you what you don't believe in preachers no they've hurt me they've done this they've done that they went after money they went out to popularity they went after this well i don't believe in people they've hurt me they've abused me they've mocked me they've made fun of me they've caused me all kinds of trouble i just don't believe in people i don't believe people exist anymore see how foolish that is if you have the holy ghost you have to believe the word amen you have to go back to the apostolic formula the bible formula and that is that the mysteries are committed to faithful men who are stewards of the word of god now brother branham said in condemnation by representation now this may get a little bit sticky so hold on for a little bit don't be carried away with hybrid stuff is not right it'll finally come to his end it can't go back when it's hybrid it's finished it can never reproduce itself if it does it's a dwarf look at the what luther or wesley revival when we get that philadelphia next age what revival they had look at the next revival look at the next revival it just keeps dwarfing dwarfing dwarf and dwarf until now and look where it's at now you see he's talking about them losing strength vigor vitality spiritually not necessarily physically because he actually got bigger bigger buildings bigger numbers amen but like a mew might be still tall and statue may weigh 15 2 000 pounds or 1500 2 000 pounds but it loses the strength to reproduce amen it can't bring one life now so he said look where the baptist started with john smith look where it dwart to look at the pentecostals that started in 1906 they interbred with the world and brought in the things of the world and the doctrine of the world they adopted for the holy ghost a handshake they adopted for a mercen sprinkling they adopted for water baptism in the name of jesus christ father son and holy ghost like the world they adopted a handshake to receive the holy ghost instead of speaking in tongues and the power of god to follow they put divine healing in the doctor's office instead of on your knees in prayer they hybrid themselves and their dwarven each year dwarfing not in numbers not in stature not in education but spiritually dwarfed spoken words original seed he said to mix it brings a hybrid crop hybrid crop is a dead crop for its rebreathing it won't re-breed itself it can't because god said so it has to bring forth of its kind you mixed it no now you can see the church right there can't you see where we're going to wind up it died there for it cannot bring forth of its kind why it's mixed you can never do nothing with it it's dead it's finished it's all right that's why each generation has its own revival a chance at the word i'm glad we got our chance at the word so the sovereign god and the judgment john wesley's group will raise up and these starks watched methodists of today will answer for it and luther will raise that the catholics will raise it behind uh iranians martin polycarp and those will have to stand up to the judgment for hybriding the word of god to dogmas this group of lutherans that followed luther's revival will answer the same thing they booted the booty group of baptists that followed john smith's revival we'll do the same alexander campbell's will do the same thing the pentecostals will do the same thing that original revival when the holy ghost fell called out a people in gods trying to get his word to it and they organized said it over denominated and it died right there again christ's a mystery he talks about how that the devil is doing the same thing building up a hybrid church a hybrid by hybrid members by knowledge instead of the word by intellectual men instead of born again man building an intellectual kingdom that will outshine christ little see what did it what is it that did that fallen angels the bible says fallen angels who listen to lucifer instead of christ who they once belonged to is that right now listen close fallen angels what kind angels luther wesley catholic pentecostals who kept not their first estate like the angels did and has fell into organization like lucifer's main hold it nicely are you with me i want you to understand it is more than receiving the word as far as doctrines we must have the life manifested brother branham told us all the way back in in in freeport he said intellectually we're hearing the message but intellectually here that is not good enough it's got to be mixed with faith and faith has got to be united with it got to be germinated with life are you with me he said our faith isn't right intellectually we're hearing the message that god has given us seeing the signs he showed among us proving that by the bible it's there but how the church needs to lay in this present till it tenders up you know and gets sweet in the spirit so it can be down amen but buddy said someone sometimes speaking the message you get hearts you had to break it in like that because you've got to clinch a nail to make it whole but when the church once gets it the elect is called out and separated then in the presence of god i know it'll be something like the people was there and beyond the current time is what it's about there when it takes the rapture hallelujah people who are rejoicing in what paul preached not a new message not a different doctrine not a different ministry the same ministry the same life the same power the same holy ghost hallelujah not just the mechanics but the dynamics to go with it amen there's got to be more than mechanics it can't be just word only it's cut out the dynamics the life of christ you see more than the knowledge of the truth they must have the spirit of guarders not word yet my words they are spirit and they are light if it's just a letter it kills it's got to have the spirit in it amen there's got to be more than an intellectual conception and more than an emotion and and to prove this that this it is the holy ghost something more than emotion those who are born of it they overcome the world are you hearing me first john 5 4 whosoever born of god over cometh the world so here he is one sign you're born of god you overcome are you with me that means you face your enemy and you overcome it that means that you don't are you with me you don't live with your sin you don't live with your excuses you overcome them hallelujah because you have god on the inside of you and greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world amen first john 5 18 we know whosoever born of god sinneth not amen that means he no longer disbelieves he that's born of god keepeth himself and that wicked one touches him not amen that's what i'm talking about i'm not talking about people born of god and they're still in pornography amen still an adultery still in all kinds of sin and smoking and drinking and lying and cursing living one way at church and then a different way outside the church amen he that is born of god cheaper than himself and the wicked one toucheth him not amen hallelujah amen now the holy ghost is not emotions but it has the motion with it and then time evangelism and i've read this quote before but it's too good not to read it again today the scientific theory of the modern so-called religious group have tried to prove this blessed thing that we have called the holy spirit is only emotion now actually they don't have any problem with dried confessions they they ain't have any problems somebody just walking up the altar shaking hands with the preacher and say i believe the message you got the holy ghost are you with me but they they have tried to prove this blessed holy spirit is only emotion it just don't stand up to their scientific theory what i'd like to ask them this is what makes them change hallelujah what makes the drunkard stop drinking amen it wasn't emotion the other day amen when brother james comes down here to the altar there and gives his heart to god it wasn't just emotion i mean he was a change amen that drinking fell off the other thing it meant things are changing in his life why because it works are you with me but it meant just doing that with him and did that with this one and that one and this one and that one and this one and that one and this one and that one i'm looking at new creations all over this building hallelujah amen what makes a prostitute the ceasar evil life what makes the drunkard stop drinking and what makes the cancer and diseases depart from the people what makes the deaf and the dumb and the blind and the dead raise up what makes it a man whether when a new convert comes into the church gives a heart to god lays their hands on a five-year-old child who came here born without hearing laser hands on him said i believe lord i claim my healing for my child and what happens hearing comes back and still hearing today are you with me what is it when cancer goes and people are still healed we're not talking about 40 years ago we're talking about right now we're talking about a now god a living god a supernatural god a super it's not just emotion hey man well sister alana got emotional and she ran around the building it was more than emotion next day she goes back there's no cancer amen amen it was it was more than a motion tonight justin ware come there in his pajamas to church drug out of bed after a prayer line we prayed for him to be saved and he comes through the service he was more than a motion amen it was a supernatural presence that changed him in a moment everybody took him out of the life of drugs and fornication and sin of all kinds and changing and made a son of god out of him amen it's more than that are you with me amen it's more than emotion it makes diseases depart cancers go said brother tim your church is an emotional church yes we are but it's more than a muslim amen we got something to shout about we got something to rejoice about we can rejoice that we got young people walking in victory we can rejoice of good marriages we can rejoice in the power of god moving in the truth we can rejoice with divine healing we can rejoice with miracles happen we can rejoice with prophecy going forth we can rejoice hallelujah something to get happy about it's more than emotion [Applause] so brother brandon said what makes the cancer diseases depart from the people the death the dumb the blind the dead to raise up explain that is that emotion it has emotion with it certainly anything that's alive has emotion anything that doesn't have emotion is dead and express the excuses the expression but i think we ought to bury some of our muslims religion then because it's dead it has no emotion to it any religion that has not emotion should be buried uh because it is emotional true religion is emotional they're mad but it's not only a motion oh no yeah the antichrist spirit would really like to put out our fire and make us a lukewarm cold and powerless people a powerless group whose only weapon is argument but we got more than that amen oh my you see we got more than that we know him but we don't just know the word we know him you see because brother branham told us in sirs we would see jesus just to know his word is not enough you must know him to know him by word that's all right but that's a long ways from being sufficient he says to knowing by the word we got to know him by the person of his resurrection so the true word brings a true experience now we're preaching about a word born bride the true word comes the prophet he tells you the true word you follow that true word and you get a true experience of the word because the word is made flesh in you and you become god's son and the word of god is revolving right out of you and out of god into you and because you're of his nature his spirit is in you and you'll do the works of god hallelujah the bible said so now there are those who have an emotional experience and there are others that and and when i say emotional that's all they got they're emotions term that's what happened with azusa street too often it was just their emotion their spirit realm and you can have the genuine holy ghost on your spirit realm and still be lost got to be the typos of the soul amen you can speak in genuine tongues genuine tongues not folks not made up not nothing not some kind of jabber i'm from a genuine tongues and still be lost because you see you can be anointed there in these outer realms and still be lost amen but there is a seal of god there is a true birth of the word there is a birth of malachi 4 that doesn't just come on the spirit realm it deals with the soul and it changes you from the inside out now so there are those who have an emotional experience and there are those that have just an intellectual experience and both of them are hybrids but i want you to know there is a true experience as brother branham confirmed in question answer 64 you cannot receive the baptism of the holy ghost without having an experience when it happens i got the holy ghost and i didn't know it no you didn't get the holy ghost it's impossible can a child be born and not know it brother brandon said something happens it's not one certain evidence but something happens it's not a tongue it's not a dance it's not a shout but brother brandon said i don't care what form it comes in just as long as it changes you now so you cannot have the baptism of the holy ghost without an experience when it happened now you say i believe if you believe every speck of the word you believe every speck of the word you say you believe every speck of it then the word is laying there waiting for the holy spirit to put it to work but it takes the lighting of the candle here's the candle with the wick and with the tallow and everything that it has in that having that candle but until the fire comes on it will not shine any light no matter how perfect the candle is how per perfect it'll burn and everything it's got to be lit and then it burns and when you believe and are made up of the instructions of what the holy spirit is love joy peace long suffering good goodness fruits that it bears out until the holy spirit with that fiery experience comes down and lights that candle then you haven't received the holy ghost you've got to have the experience to have the holy ghost that's why we believe in a fiery experience that's what happened on the day of pentecost amen not when the day of pentecost was fully come they come up and shut their hands with the preacher and said i believe the message amen now when the when the day of pentecost was fully covered when the word was ready to be manifested there came a sound from heaven come on it didn't come from the preacher it didn't come from the songs we were singing there was a sound from heaven like a rushing mighty wind and it filled the house that they were sitting and cloven tongues of fire sat down upon them and they were filled with the holy ghost and began to speak in other languages as the spirit gave them utterance and question answers three do your children have to have an experience to have the holy spirit if they see the end time message do they have the holy spirit everyone must have an experience your children cannot go in any other way but the same way you do they've got to be born into it there's no grandchildren in the kingdom they're all children they must have it you must have an experience with god to go in just the same as you yeah now brother branham did say in the church age book away with experience as your measuring line and some takes that to mean you don't have to have an experience but he's not talking about the true experience of the holy ghost but the experience that the 20th century people had when the holy ghost fell in the in on azusa street and it fell upon people that were justified and sanctified and it was there they began an unscriptural teaching you know that you're first born again by believing and then you're filled with the holy ghost now this was a teaching of the assembly of god you first except the lord is your savior and you're born again and then you get the holy ghost for added power and that was their teaching and brother branham said they went on experience as a measuring line and not the word because you see as you see that it was because people came to be filled with the holy ghost after they were supposedly been born again but the new birth is not complete without water blood and spirit are you with me so why'd they think they were born and didn't feel with the spirit how come they didn't understand you've got to be born of water blood and spirit how come they didn't know justification alone is not the new birth or justification and sanctification alone is not the new birth how come they didn't know that how come they didn't know that you got to have all stages you're begotten of god like a child in the womb when you believe on the lord you're not born yet but you're in the womb you're in the womb of the church brother branham tells us holy ghost 59 he said you've got to protect you've got to protect the church from the bruises of satan because why he said she is with child and he said it'll make the bruises of satan will make her abort the babies and what happens there when trouble comes into church well what happens when the deacon runs off with another woman or preacher does what happens when this happens or sin that comes in the church or a split comes in the body amen who is it that gets affected those that are justified in sanctified but have you ever been sealed in a day redemption i don't care what happens i don't care what you see i don't care what trouble comes i don't care who says water what does what or who hurts your feelings or what what's how somebody acts out or how the preacher fails or how the deacons fail or how the church fails you're gonna go on amen you're president you're sealed to the day of redemption you have been born you can never be back in the womb again but those who are in the development stages they're the ones that die satan to come along in the division in the church talk against the pastor and talk against the deacons and talk against the members and talk against that one be careful what you say touch not mine anointed do my prophets no harm some of you need to stretch your mouth amen be wise about what you say it could be your very own children your killing are you with me i meant but you got to have all stages you're born to get begotten of the spirit like a baby's begotten in the womb of the mother but not born until they receive the holy ghost you're born in you're not converted you're in the process of being converted if you don't have the holy ghost you're not even converted yet you're just in the process of it you just started this morning church age he said he said now what causes what causes thinking he said because the answer is experience we went by experience and not the word what experience the experience of we had justified in sanctified people who got the holy ghost baptism at azusa street so they said okay um by that because of that we see people uh are saved and then they get the holy ghost and that's not what the word teaches the word teaches the word teaches repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost is that right amen the word teaches that to be born again you must be born of the water and the spirit you can't be just begotten and just believe on the lord and believe the message and believe god sent a prophet you've got to have more than that you've got to be god yourself do you understand what i'm talking about some people went on that experience of what happened there of lutherans and methodists and and whatever coming in already saved people and get the holy ghost and they went on that experience use that before plumb line builds a false doctrine and brother brandon said it's a false doctrine and he said many of these that are believable are not going all the way into receiving the holy ghost and he said he said again he said that's what's wrong with our fundamentalists they have no power for they stop short of pentecost amen so let me tell you what every experience he's talking about was because they had stopped short of pentecost they did not get the baptism of the holy ghost now so you see there's going to be few that will ever believe all the way into receiving the spirit of god as again from the church age this idea i want to deal with something just a minute i wanted to want to get a lot deeper into this than i did but this idea that you're saved one day and lost the next is an azusa pentecostal teacher one day you're a horse the next day you're back a donkey again that's mule religion you don't know what you are that's not to do birth that's a form of godliness that denies the power are you with me amen when you are sealed you are sealed to the day of redemption and the holy spirit inspects you just like the inspecting of a railroad railway car he inspects you to first to see if there's anything loose amen and then when he finds that everything's in order in other words your temper's been sanctified your habits have been cleansed you cannot get the holy ghost and still smoking and drinking and pornography you can't do it you've got to die to sin in order to get the holy ghost are you with me amen so you know a lot of people are thinking well you know well here he packs the the real car we get down the road it all breaks apart no he never sealed the car he never approved you for the journey if you listen listen let me tell you there's too many churches that are not preaching a sin cure they are preaching and they are treatment centers for sin so therefore they're with psychology and with the you know admonitions and counseling whatever they try to deal with sin that's not the way to deal with sin the way to deal with sin is a new birth where you try out to sin where you're born again by the spirit of god amen that's the way to deal with sin it it ain't what is it means what 19 steps i don't know what it is i've never been to one thank god never drank in my life but nevertheless you know here here again you know they have all these steps you do this and now you do that and then you don't do this and you do that and then you talk with one another you know and you report to one another and you know keep everybody on track you know say about your buddy over here and help him you know because with his addiction and you know you always have the problem you always are going to be an alcoholic you are never cured we're just going to teach you how to deal with that don't ever think you're cured you see that that's the problem that we have today that with churches they have become treatment centers and some of them are good programs i'm not saying they're not you know some of them the promise keepers program where you promise and sign pledges i'll be true to my wife i'll love her and love her only and i'll take her out on dates and i'll do this and i'll do that and i'll keep my marriage vitalized you see promise keepers when you see promises get broken amen in the time listen listen david said thy word have i hid in my heart he had he had read the word and he had memorized the word he said it's in the frontlines of my eyes and i've got it on my doorpost amen but brother he went right beyond all of that when he saw bathsheba all of a sudden the frontlines disappeared he couldn't see that no more he didn't see what he said in the commandments he didn't i'm the king and i can have her and he overruled everything with reasoning and let me tell you that's what you will do [Music] amen i want you to understand the new birth is not a reformation it's a transformation it ain't i've decided and i'm making up my mind it ain't that at all it is you get a new mind you hate sin like god hates sin amen listen we don't preach in this church a sin treatment we are not a treatment center for sin we preach a sin cure hallelujah people are arguing about the vaccine let me tell you the vaccine you better get something the other is the mark of the beast it ain't but i'll tell you some people got that idea in their mind that's the mark of the beast the mark of the means is to reject the seal of god to reject the holy ghost is to take the mark of the beast you're either marked with god or your markless sin hallelujah you're either taking one mark on the other mark but i tell you there is a people of god that has the seal of god amen it's the seal of god not just in their forehead it's in their heart it's clear it carries them when they're going it's on the backside it's on the front side you don't have to preach don't look at women don't watch television don't go to movies don't wear short dresses don't do this and don't do that that's a law we're not under the law amen we have the holy spirit and the cause of holy spirit it's a nature and we hate sin we hate wickedness we're offended we're offended and evil you see it's a sin kill i can today there was a need for cure for smallpox they couldn't find the cure fact of the matter is my ancestry i'd have to go back and find out the name now but one of my great great great great great great grandfathers back there was working on a cure for false smallpox and he learned to take cow pox now he he he wasn't he wasn't the man they accredited for it but it's still part of history and he he did some of the first experimentals of taking cow pox or something like that and and trying it and they they wound up with a vaccine they used it on horses and they developed the blood and got a serum from that and they they took that and made a vaccine and we eradicated a horrible disease but you know the man was persecuted he was run out of town he was tart and feathered everybody was afraid of what he was doing they were skeptical that was gonna this vaccine was gonna kill everybody you're going to destroy us all they were in a pandemonium they were it was it was a horrible time but but men and that day broke through until they got a cure for smallpox and they eradicated it hey man it wasn't just a treatment hey man it didn't just kind of make it where its effects wasn't as bad it eradicated it once you got the inoculation i remember when i was a child i got the inoculation there's still a scar on my left shoulder here from the inoculation 5 10 5 or 10 big needles like that go in there makes a big scab that comes over there makes a big sore i screamed i cried and when i got sick i bawled i i was had to be pampered and everything else after five six years old but i tell you what when it's all over i had a mark on me i had a seal and it showed i was inoculated hallelujah everywhere i will i could show my scar amen i took the vaccine i got the seal are you with me church this is what the holy ghost does it might be like a brand in a calf amen but that calf might squeal and yell and book and scream and run with his tail up and just have a running fit but i'll tell you when it's over with that brandy cat knows who he belongs to amen that's what the holy ghost does it'll come and it inoculates you it'll inoculate you against drinking pornography sin movies evil everything it'll inoculate you it ain't effects a temporary fix it's a lasting cure it's a divine vaccine you say brother tim what in the world is in that back seat repair let me baptize every one of you in the name of jesus christ and you service he didn't give for the holy ghost but that only works for our age and the age path no the promise is unto you and to you and to you and to you and to your children and them that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call and as long as he's calling the back seat still works and i'll tell you don't mess with the prescription don't just try to say it's shaking a hand with a preacher it's just saying i believe the message it's an experience you get with god and it bursts you by the word supernaturally not intellectually and you're not saved one day i lost the next i had an older cousin a year older i was a boy he was in the upc i heard he got the holy ghost i said text heard you got the holy ghost i heard last night you got the holy ghost he looked at me real sadly he said yeah but i've already lost it that's not the new birth from now not a count forward it seals you to the day of redemption everything your temper your habits the world it all gets in place where that when you do have a trial because along the journey you're going to have ups and downs you're going to have with banging together the cars you know jostling along the road and sometimes there's wrecks along the way but if the car has been packed and sealed by the holy ghost it don't break loose on the journey hallelujah are you with me church amen it's like in the days and in the days where they had a cannon here and i'm running over time you can come on musicians but in the days of the of this of the shipping where they had ships they would have to have a big old cam a cannon it would be on wheels well because it's heavy maybe weigh a ton or two big metal cast iron huge balls and there they would have it maybe that ship would only have one cannon and that cannon would have to be moved from side to side when you know because you couldn't turn the ship around quickly so they would take the cannon and run it to the other side to face an opponent on the other side when pirates were coming along the ship was in danger and they needed that cannon there to ward off to show we got a weapon and the cannoneer was a man who had a charge and his charge was to keep the cannon secure he was over the cannon now there's a lot of things in your life that is a cannon god gives you a temper i said god gives you a temper it causes you to have a backbone temper is such a good thing you should never lose it but if it ever gets loose it will destroy your family it'll ruin your marriage it'll harm your kids erect the church it'll destroy your friends it'll destroy you god gave you sexual passion he said i'm going to permit for this to come this way but it gave a way to channel it and that's through marriage marriage is honorable and the bed is undefiled but whoremongers and adulterers god will judge and passion is a wonderful thing if it's aimed in the right direction toward a mate and loving and giving affection to your mate passion is a wonderful thing but if it gets loose and aimed in the wrong direction it can break up your home your family your children your church it can hurt your pastor there's all kinds of things that when you come to new birth you've got to get tied down first well this cannon here had a job his job was to secure the cannon tend to it make sure it was tied down you know and he got irresponsible and there was a storm came well i mean you've got this 1500 pound 2 000 pound cannon and now in this storm it's rolling back and forth and it's rolling to one side the other and it's crashing in here and it's running over men and it's breaking legs and it's saying it's breaking into the sides and it's about causing the whole ship to wreck because a man didn't secure the cannon finally wrestling that men getting hurt maimed and got the cannon in place and tied it down storm settled the ship is devastated men are dead people are crippled harmed and the cannoneer has to walk the plank the time down is the holy ghost it is the tie post that ties those things in place you were born with certain things in your life qualities that are there that are misused the devil will use them and destroy with get it tight now i want you to bow your hands for a moment i've seen loose cannons get a hold of preachers destroyed churches young people fall away this man who they thought was such a great christian drugs sex homosexual all kinds of evil things he can't make it i can't make it don't make man your example look back to the word look back to the prophecy there's going to be a people born of the word a people that are truly born again not born of a church born of christ i just want to i want you just to think it over just for a moment maybe in your life that you can see there's still something loose maybe it's an evil tongue maybe there's something been destroyed in your marriage you can't love you can't care you can't you you can't express it you don't know how well i tell you just get the love of god in your heart to make you love everybody you should make you love your family that's the holy ghost maybe it's something else he said well brother tim i'm one of those saved today and lost tomorrow i don't know where i stand you don't have to stay that way now this message didn't go quite the way i thought it would either i had a lot more things i wanted to get into today but you see i'm not my own boss i have to speak as the unction comes i never was trained to be a preacher thank god except by the holy ghost i started out 52 years ago there at blocker's chapel preaching a sermon about the insincerity of the people they sat down to eat and they rose up to play because of this god was displeased and overthrew them in the wilderness yet they drive from the rock yet they were under the cloud yet they went through the red sea [Music] but with many of them god was displeased [Music] i must wonder today where you are in your spiritual walk is there something loose because i've been seeking the holy ghost well once you deal with the loose things won't you just give up that pride i want you to surrender that to the heart of god once you give up that worldliness that sin that besetting sin give it up make a full surrenderance of your life the token why you could plaster your house with tapes you put books everywhere over in africa they when they build a house and put a spoken word book at the doorsteps bury it under the foundation keep demons out you put books anywhere and put books all over you they don't save you that's not what savior it's the holy ghost it's the supernatural presence of the almighty god coming down into you and changing you that's what changes you the books and tapes are wonderful we need them we should have them and yeah i think if you feast on them you should we do we make it available to every one of you encourage you to hear it all the time read your bible too do all of those things but you can do the same thing with bibles you put bibles on on a dead man it won't raise him up you bury it with him you can plaster yourself with bibles you can take a bible and put it on a demonic man it won't cast the devil out of him but you can take that bible in a preacher or in a man of god in my name have cast out devils i've seen it happen i know it happens you see it ain't the external it's the internal it ain't what you can do with works it's what you can do what the supernatural god does in you it isn't you making yourself new it's a new creature maybe you can look at your life today and say there's some things i really need tied down really there's some things that are loose maybe you just want to raise a hand to god we just start right there you just want to raise a hand to god and there's some loose tanks i want to surrender everything lord i want to surrender when it's all over i don't want to just have went to church and paid my tithe went through
