[0:15] Every time I try to make it on my own,
[0:22] every time I try to stand, I start to
[0:26] fall.
[0:29] All those lonely roads that I traveled
[0:33] on,
[0:35] there was Jesus.
[0:42] When the life I built came crashing to
[0:46] the ground.
[0:49] When the friends I had were nowhere to
[0:53] be found,
[0:56] I couldn't see it then, but I can see it
[1:01] now.
[1:03] There was Jesus
[1:10] in the waiting, in the searching, in the
[1:14] healing and the hurting. like a blessing
[1:18] buried in the broken pieces.
[1:23] &gt;&gt; Every minute, every moment where I've
[1:27] been and where I'm going, even when I
[1:31] didn't know it or couldn't see it,
[1:35] &gt;&gt; there was Jesus.
[1:43] For this man needs amazing kind of
[1:48] grace.
[1:50] For forgiveness at a price I couldn't
[1:53] pay.
[1:56] I'm not perfect. So I thank God every
[2:00] day.
[2:03] There was Jesus.
[2:06] There is Jesus
[2:10] in the waiting, in the searching, in the
[2:13] healing and the hurting. Like a blessing
[2:17] buried in the broken pieces.
[2:23] Every minute, every moment of where I've
[2:26] been or where I'm going. Even when I
[2:30] didn't know it or couldn't see,
[2:35] &gt;&gt; there was Jesus
[2:37] &gt;&gt; on the mountains, in the valley,
[2:41] &gt;&gt; there was Jesus
[2:44] &gt;&gt; in the shadows of the
[2:48] &gt;&gt; There was Jesus
[2:51] fire in the cloud.
[2:55] There was Jesus
[2:57] &gt;&gt; always is and always was.
[3:07] Oh, I never wanted
[3:16] the waiting in the search and the he
[3:25] broken pieces
[3:33] where I'm going. And when I didn't know
[3:37] it or couldn't feel it,
[3:41] &gt;&gt; there was Jesus.
[3:47] &gt;&gt; There was Jesus.
[3:52] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[3:56] Jesus.
[4:01] There's just something
[4:05] around
[4:07] that
[4:20] Jesus
[4:25] like Heat. Heat.
[4:37] Jesus.
[4:43] Jesus.
[4:59] Kings
[5:01] and kingdoms
[5:04] will
[5:06] pass away.
[5:09] But there's something
[5:12] about
[5:16] something
[5:18] about
[5:21] something
[5:23] about
[5:26] that day.
[5:36] Glory to God in the highest.
[5:39] Hallelujah. Won't you lift your hands
[5:41] and just worship me for a moment? Give
[5:43] him glory all you people. Praise the
[5:46] wonderful, lovely name of Jesus Christ.
[5:51] Oh, we love you, Father. We praise you,
[5:54] Almighty God.
[5:56] There's something about that name. At
[5:59] the mention of that name, demons
[6:01] tremble.
[6:03] Sickness fleas. At the mention of that
[6:05] name.
[6:06] Oh Jesus, we love you, Father.
[6:09] Hallelujah. Let's just sing that. Oh
[6:11] Jesus,
[6:14] Jesus.
[6:18] Jesus.
[6:22] There's just something
[6:26] about
[6:28] oh that name. Amen. That's the choir to
[6:31] come this morning. Oh master,
[6:37] savior
[6:40] Jesus.
[6:44] Like the fragrance
[6:48] after
[6:50] the rain.
[6:53] Oh Jesus.
[6:56] Jesus.
[6:59] Jesus.
[7:01] Jesus,
[7:06] let all heaven
[7:09] and earth
[7:11] proclaim.
[7:18] Kings
[7:20] and kingdoms
[7:23] will all
[7:25] pass away.
[7:28] But there's something
[7:31] about
[7:34] that takes
