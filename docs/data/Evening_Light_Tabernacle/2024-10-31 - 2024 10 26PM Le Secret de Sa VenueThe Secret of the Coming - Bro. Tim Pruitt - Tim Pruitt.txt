David for Hospitality an family is such a wonderful time that we've had together just here for a few days and leaving on Monday so going back home but we just want to bring you greetings from Louisiana Church There Brother David was there and ministered for us here just recently just so blessed our hearts amen it's so wonderful to see a men raising up that are carrying the the Gospel of Jesus Christ amen amen you know when I heard the prophet say that young men would take this message and sweep it to the coming of the Lord I thought I was one of them young men now as I said announc this morning I'm a great grandfather amen but you know God is good and his Mercy endures amen so let us bow our heads together and ask the Lord's blessing father we love you today we thank you for your grace Upon Our Lives we thank you for your truth that you have revealed in this day and hour I pray that you make make yourself real to us tonight you open up the eyes of our understanding that we might know the hope of our call forgive us of our shortcomings and help us to do right because we want to serve you with all of our hearts so we surrender ourselves to you tonight say Lord I'm yours all the hours of preparation but Lord if your presence will just come down you're anointing to anoint these lips of clay anoint ears that they might hear what the spirit saying will you just minister to Hearts tonight Jesus name amen amen amen God bless you turn with me to Malachi 4 and we'll read from verse five I have several scriptures I want to read before you're seated we're going to draw a text from Malachi 4:5 behold I send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse turn with me to Luke 17 verse 30 this is speaking of as a day in the days of lot the lot even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed all right and we'll go to 1 Thessalonians 4:13 sorry but I would not have you to be ignorant Brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep am for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a sh and with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with him in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore come one another with these words then Revelation 8 verse one and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of an half an hour and then Revelation 101 and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire amen and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea his left foot on the earth and he cried with a loud voice as when a lion roar and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not amen and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that are therein and the Sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin the sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets amen amen God bless you can take your seats brother Timothy ministered this morning it was a masterpiece on the casting down of imagination tonight we are not going to take an Evangelistic approach we're going to do some indepth teaching on the word of God and in doing so we're going to cast down imagination because much of things that are called Revelation is actually people's imagination and it has a tail of several kilometers long so you know we are going to cast down imagination we want our faith to be settled on the word of God and you may wonder why I read all of those scriptures tonight you might wonder well how do they connect what common factor do they all include his coming you see we must be ready in the time of his coming and it is clear that Jesus comes in the seventh Church age so we're going to speak tonight on the subject of the The Secret of his coming now brother Bram tells us in the Ephesian Church age said there's something that you ought to know the seven churches which were addressed by John are in Asia they are all Gentile churches he does not speak to the Church of Jerusalem which is mostly je Jewish with perhaps just a few Gentiles in it the reason is that God has turned from the Jews to the Gentiles now listen closely thus the whole of the church ages is God dealing with the Gentiles and calling out a gentile bride to himself so that makes the church ages and the fullness of the Gentiles the one and same thing so we're in the very end of the last Church AG there are no more Messengers to come there are no additions to the message once the seventh angel sounded his message the mystery concerning the bride is finished there is there is no one else needed to bring Clarity God said it the way he wanted it and it needs no one to embellish it and let us be sure there is no eighth age there are only seven horns on the lamb and each horn repres represents an age to make another age after the seventh age is to go outside of the Lamb it will remove you from Christ and the bright age is not another age remember this the whole of the church ages God dealing with the Gentiles calling out a gentile bride to himself makes the church ages and the fullness of the Gentiles one and the same thing so when the Gentile dispensation is over the church ages are over when God finishes the church Jesus there will be no more Gentiles saved and so once the seven seven Church ages are over there are no other ages so the bride age is not another age there are not Seven Ages and then a bride Age The Bride ages when the church who is the Bride Comes to maturity comes to age it is bride time it is the time of the elect lady she is what his coming is about she must be mature and ready to meet him now as a church we were a immature child in Luther's day we were like a pre-teen in Wesley teenager atza now by the message of the hour the bride must be mature and ready to meet him now so so this is not the eighth day we are present in the sixth day in the seventh age but the sixth day so we are presently in the sixth day a day with the Lord is as a thousand years so there was about 2,000 years from Adam to the flood 2,000 years from the flood to the Cross 2,000 years from the cross to the seven Church ages to the rapture so we are in the sixth day the day of man and it's about to end and it will end with the battle of Armageddon then will come the day of the Lord the Millennium the seventh day the day of rest and and then only after the white Throne judgment will there come the Eternal Church age where he makes an where he makes a new heavens and a new Earth that's the Eternal Church age that ised in after the Millennium well brother Brandon spoke of the Eternal Church age that comes after the seals that's right and the seventh seal in the Millennium and after the Millennium comes the eternal age or the Eighth Day so we are ending the day of man where we are to be caught away in a Rapture and after three and a half years wedding supper come back for the seventh day the millennial R you said well now brother Tim I'm already in the E I'm already in eternity I'm an eternal creature well pinch yourself you'll find out you're not you're not in the Sweet By and By you're right here in the dirty here and now you see but maybe you insist but in my soul I've already been caught up into eternity but that's not unique to our age Paul said every Born Again believer is sitting with Christ in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus now when we're looking at this we're going to we're going to examine Revelation 3 and Revelation 4 and we're going to come to an understanding brother Bram never spiritualizes Revelation 4 so we're going to start with Revelation 3 continue to Revelation 4 so in verse 21 to him that overcometh that's me say you will I gr to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and have sat down with my father in his throne he that has an he let him hear what the spirit amen amen now concerning these Overcomers brother Brom says we find the True Vine true Spirit true church people exalted to the very Throne of God with the highest compliment ever paid humble steadfast spiritual group so the false Vine gets a bitter denunciation but the True Vine is exalted to the very Throne of God with the highest compliment ever ever paid the humble stepf group so the lean age ends with the people who are rewarded as overc to sit with him on his throne they are robed in white rment they have the true riches they have gold tried in the fire they are not blind Le theide of the word Ed their eyes you see so they see clearly what God is doing and the age ends with a Rapture the age ends with the bride ascending to the throne so look at the very next verse which is revelation 41 and after this I looked and behold the door was open in heaven and the first verse voice that I heard as it were of a trumpet talk me said come up hi and I will show you things that which must be here now brother Bram teaches us and this is a quote what John represented the entire church was taken up I told you one person here in the vision can represent the entire body of Christ amen amen so John is caught up at the end of the church ages into the heavens amen a type of the Rapture one person representing the intire body even all the resurrected Saints down Through the Ages go in a Rapture together to meet the Lord in the air amen amen he goes on and tells us joh being taken up immediately after the church age it was a type of the Rapture Church immediately after the church age is over Le and church age then comes the Rapture the church goes up like John did into the presence of God say oh my that just winds my soul around hold up at the Rapture of the church so brother Bram taught us that the bride is raptured in the fourth chapter of Revelation and does not return into the 19th Chapter of Revelation where we are seeing coming back with him on white hores for the battle of Armageddon so Revelation 41 is the physical Rapture and the going away of the bride and Revelation 19 is the physical Return of the church with the groom for the Battle of armagedon so everything between Revelation and Revelation 19 that pertains to the bride the Seven Seals Revelation 10 the seventh angel the seven Thunders Revelation 18 which is the call come out of her my people so that you're not partakers of that all of this must happen in the seven Church ages in chapters 1 through three particularly in in the seventh Church age amen where God brings forth a mature bride amen so everything from 4 to 19 that pertains to the bride must happen in the seven Church ages the call come out of her my people the mighty angel coming down the sounding of the seven Thunders the opening of The Seven SE all of these things must happen in the seventh Church age because it's the age the mature elect lady now brother tells us in the Rapture message he said Enoch was the seventh from Adam which is a type of the church ages now all the rest of the six men before him died but Enoch was translated Enoch was raptured the seventh showing it is the seventh Church age that takes the now then he says now there's no doubt we are in the seventh Church age we all know it well apparently some don't they say well we've already left the we're already in another age we're somewhere else beside this age now he goes on to say now it's the seventh Church age that makes the Rapture all the other six died en was translated he was not found CU God took him but Enoch was raptured it was the type of all the rest of them dying the en bride the rapturing without death be called out of the seventh Church age we are now bearing record of that age so we are here in the L last AG it is the age of his coming there are no more Messengers amen no more Messengers from Jesus anyway to his bride it's all inclusive in the seventh Angels message and do you know we can no longer put the come of the Lord in future tense only because there is a phase of his coming that future that's a literal physical coming of the Lord and on that day and hour no one knows so it behooves us to be steadfast and ready for it for you know not what hour that the Lord might come but brother Bram tells us he says in three kinds of Believers that's the reason I do believe that when a bride is called out elect and set in The Book of Life there come a sound from Heaven that will take such a baptism of the Holy Spirit into that bride that take her from the earth Grace God promised I don't care how many science how many astronauts and everything else oh how many million miles they can see there is a Heaven There is a literal Jesus that come in a body form receive his church and his and no matter how old the story it's still the truth God said so that's what Believers believe amen amen amen and so we're looking for the physical Corporal coming weet that's what Believers believe am amen amen but yet Christ is here he's here in a spiritual form but he's coming in a physical form amen he said I am he that was dead and I am alive forever and I have the keys of death and of hell I declare tonight he is a present God amen amen and we not say because he is present and that he is with us that he will not save us that he will not redeem that he will not heal he will not deliver he will not fill with the Holy Ghost but that's why he's here Amen to provide for you that you would have to be your redemer hallelujah amen he's here to fill our being with his life finish Redemption but you know men you know are looking for the wrong thing to identify his presence many will look for a man come walking down the street with nail stars in a white robe any impersonator can do that we will not see the literal Corporal physical body of Christ till the meeting in the air for he must remain on the throne of Mercy until the last predestinated SE am let me just tell you no preacher can close the door of nobody can take away the day of Grace God opens and when God sh no man amen and he will remain on the seed of Mercy until the last predestinated seed hallelujah amen we're not going to leave a hoof behind amen praise the Lord now brother Ram tells us that 80% of Jesus Ministry of of his talk was on his second coming not what was then his sacrifice and going away but the second coming and he gave the people warning and he says if Jesus talks so much 80% of his of his time on the second coming then it behooves us to listen to see what he would say place he said you'll hear Nations Rising against Nation kingdoms against Kingdom you'll hear the all these things the temp will be tored down not one stone left on the other that's not the end yet and right down at the end but he said when you see the victory put for this bud and all the other trees you see a restoration time then you know summer is not likewise when you see this know that it's now at the door barely I say this generation shall not pass until all be fulfilled now the United Nations recognize Israel as a nation and it declared its independence in 1948 but the moment that God recognized Israel as a nation will be after the bride is raptured and the two prophets appear on and that generation will not pass away until all is fulfilled amen now we read Malachi 4 without this Prophet there would be no people ready for his coming it took a message to call the right out and to turn our hearts back to and from the confusion caused 40,000 different denominations each with their own interpretation amen amen so without Malachi 4 there can't be a Rapture without Malachi 4 without a time of restoration there cannot be a bride amen now the Bible says as the Lord descends there will be three phases to his coming there will a shout the voice of the arang and the Trump of God amen amen the shout is a message you see it's to gather the elect the denominations back to the word again remember abrah God could not bless Abraham with the promised son until he was in the promised land Israel has to be in their promise in order to receive their Messiah and the bride of Christ must be in her promise the word of God in order to receive the return of Christ and Jesus will only come to those who are in the promised land so the shout was a mighty message it wasn't just noise it wasn't just somebody screaming it was a message and it was a call Gathering the elect back to the word again to prepare a people for the meeting in the air to shout that was Christ the logos in word form coming to a prophet amen he had to return in word form in order for them to be a bride prepared for his coming it was a dire necessity for the word to be restored and for the End Time Mystery of the Seven Seals to be revealed now the theme of brother Bron's Ministry I know many of us would think well it's Hebrews 13 and8 and that's true it was a threat in every message the theme of his entire Ministry was on the coming of the Lord the events surrounding the end time now we are in the cycle of his coming and it started with God sending a prophet like Elijah to prepare the way people for the coming of the Lord and exactly as his first coming started with John Prophet a forerunner so God started his second coming by sending Elijah to be a forerunner Amen to bring us back to the promised land of the world in order that we might receive the Messiah amen so the m so his coming begins with a shout so this is the day of his coming and his coming is already in process amen now it's like my daughter Bethany Beth when she was 5 years old I went to her bed that morning her birthday on her fth birthday and I woke her up and I said Bethy Beth and she opened her big brown eyes and looked at me and smiled and I said Bethany today is your birthday and she she looked at me she said no Daddy today is not my birthday I said oh yes it is 5 years ago today I held you for the first time my heart you were such a cute little baby she said no Daddy this is not my birthday I said yes it is she said well then where's the cake where's all the guest where's all the you see amen we look around so where's the dead in Christ where's the where's the meeting in the air where's all that is promise but today is the day of coming you are in the age of the coming of the Lord amen amen so we look around and we we say the the Rapture is an ongoing event so like some say well where are the dead in Christ where's the corpal body of the Lord where meting in the air now listen the change happens in a moment and a twinkling but not the Rapture it is a process and it happens in three phases amen amen what good would it do for the Lord to come and nobody ready for his coming amen so the coming of the Lord is a mystery as he says in 1 Corinthians 151 behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall riseup we shall be changed this corrupt must put on incorruption and this Mortal must put on immortality so now so here we are now in the very hour of his coming but he coming it's a mystery and the Bible speaks it will be as it was in the days of lot and it didn't say the son of man would come but that he would be revealed so he comes now at the son Son of Man reveals himself as the word to prepare a people for the coming of the Lord so here we are we're in a day when man can destroy the world 30 times over the atomic or the nuclear fire is about to fall but it's also in this day that the son of man the word is revealed amen amen so notice now we we know who the son of man is is Christ the word and before we meet Jesus in the air the son of man as the word is revealed before the physical coming there's a revelation so as it was in the days of s God came down to Abraham and revealed himself in human flesh while two angels went down to Sodom call out lot there was one who stayed with Abraham and he brought to Abraham the sign of the Messiah Sarah's heart in the he brought her a message telling her of the coming of the promised son and the change of their body so the sign that he is here as the word discerns the thoughts and intents of the heart we know it was the word because only the word can accurately discern the thoughts and intent of the heart never you with me amen amen it wasn't a head in a mess it discerned the thoughts of heart what was that identifying the word is present amen it has come to a prophet because that's God's way of revealing himself never to a theologian but he will reveal himself to his servants the prophet amen amen maybe like Sarah sah she talk me so do we Ponder could this be true here we are 2,000 year old bride and we're going to bring forth Christ back to the Earth again the promised son me this old woman yeah you going to conceive strength because there is a message to you Angel give you the faith for your change amen hallelujah amen you wonder why can't people see the Promise well Le is prophesied to be blind amen how are they blind how is Israel blind the Messiah Jesus did not come in the manner they were they were looking for a king with the reign of the son of David but before he could come as king he had to first come as the Lamb of God so how did he come he came in a Manger he came in a way they were not expecting see even the disciples were looking for the wrong coming they too were looking for the millennial Kingdom where Christ will reign as son of David so we find them in Acts 1 and verse 6 they have this they have this question and when they were come together they asked of him saying Lord will at this time will thou restore again the kingdom to Israel so notice they have a question you know we're expecting the kingdom to be restored we're expecting the son of David to and will you do that now and Jesus said it is not for you to know times of the Season which the father has put in his own that's not for you to know it's a secret but you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost upon you so there is a coming that you must be a part of I'm coming again not as son of David but I'm coming in the form of the holy spirit amen to fill you and to give you power and you shall be Witnesses in Jerusalem Samar the part so the disciples were looking for the wrong coming he was not coming in a Corporal body sit on the throne of David instead he was coming to sit on the throne of their heart heart he had to be enthroned here before he would take you to the throne there but did he return He said I'll not leave you comfor I will come to you was that him did he come Acts 2 verse one and when the day of Pentecost was they were all with one Accord in one and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven of a rushing mighty and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them clo tongues like and sat upon each of them they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other gave them UTS did he return where he came as the Holy Ghost dwell within their body yet there were devout believers his coming are you with me let's remember let's talk about apus for a moment in Acts chapter 18 it speaks of a Jew named Apollos he was an eloquent man he's a mighty preacher he was mighty in the scriptures and he came to Ephesus and he was instructed in the way of Jehovah and and being fervent in spirit he taught diligently the things of the Lord KN only the baptism of John here he is it's the hour where a great coming is taking place the Holy Ghost God himself Christ has come down in the power of the and they missed it all he knows is is the baptism of John mhm and there was a quer in Priscilla heard him preach they took him aside and expounded to him the way of the Lord more perfectly you know what he they had to teach him yes John Was Elijah prophet he was the Forerunner but he introduced us to the Messi it was Jesus Christ and he's already died buried again ascended in glory come back day of p and they had missed it think of that devout Believers missed what God was doing you know why because of the blindness of the age amen amen so here was a preacher who even saw and recognizes John as that Prophet the Forerunner but failed to see Jesus Christ the Messiah John was pointing to and the Bible said in Acts chapter 19 that Paul passing through Ephesus and found certain disciples he said have youed the Holy Ghost since you believe and they so well we've not even heard whether there be any such thing as a holy ghost I I'm talking about the most important event and they totally missed it Jesus had come he had died buried resurrected ascended and come again in the form of the Holy Spirit and they totally missed and he said well how were you baptized we were baptized by John elah Prophet was not good enough and Paul Paul said John barely baptized with btis of repentance say unto the people that should believe on him which should come after him that is on Christ Jesus and when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and then they reive the same experience that they did on the day of Pentecost now today they will miss him because it is a secret Rapture of the church it's not going to be car wrecks and wicked have to stay here through the tribulation all the roofs the building repair all the cars but in this Rapture in this coming every eye will know not see him in fact this is more of a going away of the Bride than it is a coming for he does not come to the Earth but we meet him in the amen now I had an uncle one time and he said Tim I tell you you know that's why television was was invented so that when the Lord comes ever I would see him and every every tongue would have to confess him can you imagine this is the 6:00 news I here to inform you there happen in the E sky today well I just I just saw former promis uh president Trump and they they're going up into the sky Bill Clinton and all the others are with them look there's a phenomenon happening in the heaven let's go over here to Los Angeles now oh there's car wrecks everywhere there is pandemonium broke out see a great one up in the sky that's not the way it's going to be he's going to come like Romeo came for Julet he comes in the night Slips Away his bride and the world won't know it's even happening amen amen now brother brandom tells us that you know in the third seal he said the Bible said everything will will be so great even to the high places will be made low and the rough places will be made plain I can imagine seeing them thinking there John would come out that great Forerunner just take all the desert and smooth it out grass on it again and they had it so fixed up like they have today but it was so humble even the apostles missed they were even asking him well isn't Elijah supposed to come they were missing what God was doing and he said brother Brandon said there wasn't I guess one third of the whole Jewish race even knew that Jesus Christ was on they might have heard some fanatic down there but they didn't pay any attention he came to his own and his own received he said not didn't say he would secretly come but the Rapture will be a secret and if that was so secret when he com that first time how much more will the Rapture be directly they'll say well I thought there was supposed to have a Rapture and all his judgments now on the earth it'll be just like a thief in the night like a book I read of Romeo and Julia lad outside the house came and got her at the night time so you see the denominational Church the world is looking for the coming of the Lord and you you have even man like Billy Graham I read an article from him and he acknowledged the first time he came he came secretly in a Manger but this time he comes ever I will see him and then he quotes the scripture from Revelation 17 the he cometh with clouds and every I shall see him and they also which pierced him all the KRS of the Earth shall well even so a man amen amen but this is not the Rapture this is not the second coming now think of this he's already come once to redeem a bride comes again for his bride then he comes a third time with his bride so in this last day there are two comings of the Lord we're going to go away and we're coming back amen are you with me so you see this scripture Revelation 1 is not the Rapture but this is his third coming when he comes and returns with the bride ration three comings like I said his first coming came reveal himself in Christ Second Coming he comes for his bride third coming is when he comes back with his now let's see who those are that pierced him let's examine this for Revelation 17 the holy cometh with clouds and every ey shall and they also which pierc him all right now let's turn to Zechariah 12 and let's look at verse n and it should come to pass in that day I will seek to destroy all nations that come against Jerusalem and I will pour upon the House of David and upon the inhabitants of Jer the spirit of Grace and supplication and they shall look upon me they have pied and they shall mourn for him as one mour for his only and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness for his first born now notice this it is now the Jews who will look on him they have pierced they will recognize we crucified our Messiah amen amen now so this is after the Rapture of chur in that day there shall be a great morning in Jerusalem morning of the valley of and the land ofor family apart Family of the House of DAV apart their wife apart the family of the House of Nathan apart their wife apart the family of the House of the family of shim and their wives all the families that remain every family apart and their wives apart so there's going to come a day of morning when they realize we crucified they will look on himed but that is not his second coming that is when he comes back with let's go to Zechariah 14 behold the day cometh that the Lord day of the Lord cometh that SP shall be divided in the midst of the I will gather all nations against the city shall be taken the houses right the women RAB after the city goity the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city then shall the Lord go for and fight against those Nation as when he fought in the day of batt see here's his physical coming to the earth now and his feet shall stand in that day this is not the meeting in the air this is return back to the Earth and his Fe On The of of in the mid there the East the West there shall be a great Valley Mountain toward the and you shall flee to the Valley of the mountain the Valley of the mountain shall reach you shall flee like before the great Earth in the days ofah king ofah and the Lord God and all the with him this is coming back from the Battle of army G amen speak them will touch the Earth but it is coming for us amen amen amen so at this coming it that we're speaking of here it's the same as Revelation 19 he comes with all the armies of Heaven this prophecy though will not become clear until the end time the evening time verse six it to come to pass in that day that the light shall not be clear nor Darkness but it shall be one day be known to the nobody else will know it amen not day nor night pass at the evening it the scripture and reveal his coming amen amen now turn with me to Revelation 16 he says behold I come as a thief blessed is he that watch and keepeth his G let he walk naked now how does the thief come well he comes in the night and you know he walks up with a great big Rock real big rock you know and he throws it in the picture window and it busts open and he jumps through it everybody I'm aief I'm a thief is that the way a thief comes a thief comes in the night and he gets slips in he gets what he wants and he takes it away and months later you kind of wake up and say huh you know that honey you know that money I put in that you know I had it where where is that children did you see it where is this we we have some things missing in the home where is it and after a while you say we about to think you see he came in the night he got what he wanted and slipped out and this is what God will do with the he will come away the world will go right Darkness won't even know it wake up in the say there's something happen why are we here in the we thought there would be a r so he says in first Thessalonians 5 but the times in the season you have no need you yourself know perfect that the day of the Lord come as a thief in the night for when they say then sudden Destruction come upon as Trail upon but they shall not but you brother you are not in darkness that that day should over you as a you are all children of the light Children of the day we are not of the night nor of Darkness therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us was that sleep night that be drunk let us who are the day amen you see we have been awakened by Midnight Cry wise virgins go into an invisible Union the foolish in the amen amen let's look at Hebrews chapter 9 verse 28 so Christ was once offered to Bear the sins of many and unto them that will look for him shall he appeared the second time without sin under salvation amen now he came the first time without sin but this time he is saying he is he will come not to carry the burden of sin deal with sin but to bring full salvation to those who are eagerly and constantly and patiently waiting expecting his return amen amen this time he's not going to Calvary this time he's taking the people that he's redeemed amen amen so first Thessalonians 4:16 for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a with the voice of the AR and with the trumpet of God and the dead in Christ shall notice the Lord himself amen but you're saying brother Tim the shout is a prophet bringing a message let's go to the Book of Exodus chapter 3 and verse one and now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law PR of he led the flock to the backside of the desert came to the Mountain of God even and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire notice a pillar of fire out out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold Bush burned with fire the Bush was not consumed and Moses said I will now turn aside and see this why the bush is not burned when the Lord saw he had turned aside god notice who it is God Called to him out of the midst of the he said Moses mes and he said here and he said draw not now here put up that shoes feet for the place where On th Holy Ground moreover he says I am the god of thy father the god of Abraham the god of Isaac God ofc and Moses in his face for he was afraid to God and the Lord said I have surely see the Affliction of my which are in Egypt have heard their Cry by the reason of their I know their sorrow listen and I am to deliver amen amen to deliver them out of the hands of Amen the Lord God had come down to meet a prophet go tell my people I'm tella Let My People you can't hold you can't hold them amen hallelujah amen and what the people see they saw a prophet with a message but he had met a of fire because the Lord himself descended with message hallelujah amen amen now Revelation 101 is a repeat of the scripture God as a messenger of his C comes down with the open book and when does he cries or shouts with a loud voice and his voice is heard through a prophet amen amen now brother Brom tells us in the mess he said the first thing is a shout a voice and a trumpet shout a messenger getting the people ready second is the voice of the Resurrection the same voice the loud voice that St John 11384 called Lazarus from the grave getting the bride together the resurrection of the Dead to be caught up with it amen amen so then we go to Revelation 81 and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about half an hour now the Feast of the trumpets said Revelation 10 was the seventh seal so the seventh seal is not the beginning of Silence it was the ending of Silence amen amen amen so Revelation 10 he descends with an open book as brother said and what is attraction what happened on sun god confirming his word that's what all this noise is about God fulfilling his promised word again Revelation 101 in the days of the sounding of the Seven Angels the mystery of God should be finished the hidden Mystery of Revelation 10 1-7 the last message to the last Church age fulfills exactly in this age Luke 1730 the day when the son of man amen amen he speaks of the constellation of the seven and then he says the god of Heaven promised this evening time would have evening light three years ago mystery was a prophecy time is it sir now it's history it is p the promise is fulfilled what time is and what is the attraction God fulfilling the same yesterday Hallelujah am he tells us in the message of the I'm not making this up this is th say the Lord I'll read it to you right out of the book The sounding of the seventh Angel's message the mystery of God should be finished that has been declared by his holy prophet that's the prophets who's wrote the word and at the sounding of the seven churches the last Church all the Lo been through these other ages be together and then the seals are broken the mystery is revealed and down comes the angel the messenger Christ setting his foot upon the L on the sea with the rainbow of his head remember the seventh angel is on Earth at the time of amen so while the seventh angel here he comes down with an open it's not sealed anymore open the Mysteries are no they are revealed hallelu amen amen not some thousand foot tall Jesus in Revelation 10 was Christ coming as the word to the seventh angel Messenger on Earth but it's not revealed until the denominational ages has run out so in the this book is not revealed until the church ages not ages out and there's time no more and it's only revealed after church ages denominational agent so here we are at the end of the last AG and we have run out of Ages there ain't no more to come it's over with amen the ages are finishing up we in the last one there's not another one to come this is the last day children there's not another message if this message don't turn your heart your heart will never be amen amen amen so here we are L listen what he said said he's coming directly to Israel he said this seven seal book is revealed at the time of the seven thunders of Revelation 10 if you're marking it down turn to Revelation 10 just a moment so you'll get an understand and I saw another Mighty Angel come from the CL rainbow was you notice that's Christ because he is in the Old Testament called the angel of the Cen and he's coming directly to the Jews for the church is finished all right and his face as it was as and his feet as pillars of fire his face the sun he said remember that in Revelation in the first revelation one Angel there same thing Angel is a messenger and he's a messenger to Israel see the church has been raptured now or fixing and he comes for his church look what he's doing he he does what he comes down with the open book to get a bride out of here so he can turn back to the Jews so he's coming directly to the Jew but he's got to take a bride out am amen this is why brother Bram tells us my mission is to forun the common word which is Christ this is what the prophet was sent to do to bring us back to the word again amen am brother bam said the bride must step out of the way to go up so the two servants God in Revelation 11 the two prophets can appear on the scene sound the seventh trumpet to them to them the Christ the seventh angel messenger say behold God not behold my Methodist or my Baptist my P the word the Son of God lamb God that takes away the sin world for no other Foundation how long have we got Jews are in their Homeland the is called scripturally Everything Is promis We Ready the hour is here amen amen now what happened it was that the mighty Angel Christ of Revelation 10 descended with a shout amen a mighty message and it and that message came to the seventh angel of Revelation 10 so the son of man Christ come to a son of Manet so the for the word always comes to Prophet 3 and and when he did seven Thunders seven voices of God the word sounded their voice to the seventh angel and revealed what before was only symbols in the Bible and John was allowed to write what he saw but not what he heard right amen he saw a white horse and his rider but the interpretation the voice of God which is the interpretation of was what he heard he couldn't write what he heard but he was commanded to be sealed up to the End Amen but it would not be sealed forever because in the days of the the seventh angel when he began to this mystery will be finished amen amen you see it was a thunder because it was something that God did not want to be made known Until the End Time a thunder is always the voice of God and when God speaks it's a thunder and but it comes as a thunder when he doesn't want it made known yet but when it is time for the revelation is no longer a thunder it is a known Voice Hallelujah am amen it's no longer a ther we know what the voice of God we have heard amen amen so Revelation 10 is the seven seal when the seventh seal was open the Silence of those Thunders the seventh seal was not the beginning to open it was to open up the silence it was to break the silence what had been silence the voice of the Thunder John was going to write it and God silenced it until the days of the voice of the Seven Angels amen where you could hear the interpretation of the symbols written in the scripture amen amen this was the coming of the word both restored and revealed to a Prophet this is what he said he would do Revelation 10 and I saw another Mighty Angel only Christ is be clothed with a cloud rainbow is that represents the full entire Covenant SP as well as it were the sun amen it's with an unveiled face no longer just in types Shadow Mysteries symbols but coming light of the word he had in his hand no longer closed and he set his right foot on the sea left foot on the earth and he shouted voice that's when I lion Ro what was it the King was speaking amen when he said seven Thunders under in the prophet's message seven thund what had been becomes revealed Hallelujah and when the seven Thunders I was to WR and I Heard a Voice from saying unto me seal up the things and write him you see that's the shell the first phase of his coming the next is the second phase so now the word that has been brought has to become flesh amen you see it can't remain in books and Tes amen are you with me amen it must become the word become it cannot remain form got to move from flesh amen hallelujah amen so then second phase of is the word in Bride form it's the same revealing of the son of man but now it's an bride form and rising of the Sun as Christ was the first one to raise out of the prop typed in many places he was the first fruit of those slept in the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church there has to be a she wave in the last notice what he said in the bride coming of Christ because before we can meet him in the air he would first have to send the word and when that word then he can come can amen hallelujah amen hallelujah amen amen so now he said the waving of the sheep what was it the first to come to mature the first that proved it was weak proved it was a sheep Hallelujah I see I'm sure you see what I'm talking about was waved over the people for the first time that will come forth for the bright age for a resurrection out of dark will be a message that the full maturity of the word has turned back full power and has being waved over the People by the same signs and wonders back there hallelujah amen so the second phase of his is the voice of the Ark Angel amen amen and where is an archangel promise to come in Revelation chap 10 and I saw another Mighty amen so now as we look at this the word must always take on flesh it cannot always remain as a Doctrine or as a knowledge it must take on flesh that's why it now takes on flesh as the people called The Bride brother brandom tells us spoken words original SE as the end time prophecies will repeat believe as the first Forerunner came from the Wilderness the hold the Lamb of God the second Forerunner probably do the same appointing the people a word bde do you realize that brother Bram for around your coming my message produce a bride my prophecy will prophesy a bride into this is where we're at the word FLH and the flesh BEC word hallelujah amen so the second phase of the is the brag coming of Christ CU he's not going to come Rapture tapes and books he's going to take his word which is in flesh the word bride to be United with the word gr hallelujah amen amen so this time he comes in a multim membered body of people and they become the voice of the Resurrection as they are the resurrected ones out of cold dark denominational tombs of religion amen the first fruits of the Resurrection the first ones up from the dead amen people who are not in the denominational tombs amen but they have risen out of they are alive never to go back into hallelujah amen Revelation 10 the mighty angel said to John and he's symbolic of the Bride he's not symbolic of one Preacher Brother never taught that he represents the bride one man representing the entire and he says go take the book eat it and then prophesy speak become the voice of the book amen become the voice not of the closed book open don't run without a message eat the book and then prophesy and prophesy become the voice and the angel Christ amen see the bride becomes the voice of the resurrection showing the world that Christ Hasen again in his people she's out of the Tomb and never never will we go back never can you be sealed backb to be shut away again am hallelujah amen true Easter seal said and today they're trying to keep Christ in the Tom oh what an Easter morning an Easter ruined all their theology Easter morning came people at church 1900 years later it ruined their theology he's not dead He's Alive and they can't keep him two you can't put him in a method Oran whatever but heed and is alive he said had a Baptist tomb might a Methodist Tom one day Jesus rose there from a historical God to a living present God hallelujah amen so she the bride becomes the final voice to the final age so brother Bram tells us these other ages fa but he said but God had raised up other has gone on through the years until in this last day there will be another people in the land who under their Messengers will be the final voice to the final Ed amen amen said the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God it is its own mouthpiece so God is turning on he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for voice of God will be in her for it says in the last chapter Revelation verse 17 the spirit and the bride Hallelujah once more the world will hear direct but of course the word bride will be repudiated as but he says God still has a voice for the people of the world amen he's given a voice to the bride that voice is in the Bride As we have said Hallelujah am amen so the voice calls for the bride to unite with Christ the word and there is a marriage there is uniting of the Lamb word to the bride this is the invisible Union amen it's to prepare us for the visible un amen amen thus the bride and the word becomes one am and once that voice becomes totally manifested in Bride for in and every member of that bride in their ordained position in Christ that will call the Dead from the other dimension and our eyes will behold love as we see them we will be changed amen and in a moment and we'll be traveling like a and Jesus did Resurrection C up hallelujah amen what a promise that is now we come to the trumpet what is the trumpet now we are changed as the bride's voice becomes one with the last Trump let me say that again we are changed as the bride's voice becomes one with the last First Corinthians 15:51 behold I show you a mystery we shall notep but we shall all be changed in moment in the twinkling of where at the last trumpet for the trumpet of sound and the dead in Christ shall be raised Incorruptible we shall be changed first Thessalonians 4:17 then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever amen amen amen now we already know what the last Trump says the last Trump is the call that says come up here amen amen amen this is shown in type at the end of Le after the church has reaches the end of the seventh age after this I after this what after I've seen church at the end of that I looked and a door was open in heaven at the last AG amen and the first voice which I heard was as it was a trumpet that's the last trumpet amen and when he sounds says come out of the Grave the Christ rise you that alive remain leave this Dimension amen that's what the Trump say Amen Let me let me show you this is not only shown in our Rapture but this is also the Rapture of the two witnesses and while it's not our Rapture the pattern is the same Revelation 1112 and they heard a great voice from Heaven saying unto them come up hither they ascended up to heaven in a cloud and their enemies beheld them amen amen so you see this is the pattern the call the trumpet call come up here so the trumpet call will call us to the meeting of the there we go to the marriage of the Lamb and will forever what a day what a day that will be the secret of his coming and you're it you've been chosen to be a part of this you've heard the shout you're becoming the voice one day we don't know what hour but we'll hear the trumpet say come up here and we change Dimension the dead in Christ will also hear it Rise Up from the grave amen amen we look forward we prepare our hearts we lay aside every way and run with we will go we will achieve the go amen we not go down on the grave not perpetuate the Ang but we shall rise Hallelujah we shall rise while the world is falling to meet him hallelujah amen what a day that amen
