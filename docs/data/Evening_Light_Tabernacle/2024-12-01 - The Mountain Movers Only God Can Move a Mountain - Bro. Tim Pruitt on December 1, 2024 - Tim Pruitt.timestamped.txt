[29:28] and so um you know we kind of combin the
[29:31] the Sunday morning Sunday night service
[29:33] together so it's a little longer suong
[29:35] service a little longer preaching you're
[29:37] not used to that well it's okay you'll
[29:40] you'll survive amen you'll be and I hope
[29:44] that you'll be blessed amen but
[29:46] Zechariah 4 and verse 6 and then he
[29:50] answered and spake to me saying this is
[29:53] the word of the Lord and the zerubabel
[29:55] saying not by might nor by power but by
[30:00] my spirit sayeth the Lord of hosts who
[30:03] art thou oh great Mountain before
[30:06] zerubabel Thou shalt become a plain and
[30:09] he shall bring forth The Headstone
[30:11] thereof with shoutings crying Grace
[30:15] Grace unto it amen I'm going to let you
[30:18] be seated as you turn to Revelation
[30:20] chapter 10 and we're going to read from
[30:23] the first verse Revelation chap 10 and
[30:27] verse one
[30:28] and I saw another Mighty Angel come down
[30:32] from heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[30:35] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[30:37] was as it were the Sun and his feet as
[30:39] pillars of fire and he had in his hand a
[30:43] little book open if you notice
[30:45] Revelation 5 you would find that the
[30:48] book was closed and it was sealed with
[30:50] Seven Seals and yet now it is a book
[30:54] that is open and he set his right foot
[30:57] upon the SE
[30:58] and his left foot on the earth and he
[31:01] cried with a loud voice as when a lion
[31:04] Roth and when he cried seven Thunders
[31:07] uttered their voices now these are all
[31:10] mysterious symbols because the Book of
[31:12] Revelation is a symbolic book and so it
[31:16] was written in parabolic form because
[31:20] God held the people in other ages blind
[31:24] to it until our day that we're living in
[31:27] when it would become a very important
[31:30] part of the scripture because it would
[31:33] be made known in the last days
[31:36] concerning the meanings of these things
[31:39] and so a thunder is simply the voice of
[31:41] God When God Says something and he
[31:45] doesn't want it known yet so it is
[31:49] recorded in the scripture as a thunder
[31:52] and when you look over in the the
[31:55] gospels when Jesus Remember say said um
[31:59] um he said oh Father glorify thy name
[32:02] the Bible said some heard of Thunders
[32:05] but what it was was a voice as the
[32:08] scripture said a voice that says I have
[32:10] glorified it and will glorify it again
[32:13] so you see it was something that to some
[32:16] it was a thunder it was just a noise but
[32:19] to others it was made known so it was a
[32:23] known voice so a thunder is a voice of
[32:26] God when God says something but it isn't
[32:29] time yet for it to be made known but I
[32:33] want you to notice as he said seal up
[32:35] the things which the seven Thunders
[32:37] utter right them not verse four verse 5
[32:40] and the angel which I saw stand upon the
[32:43] sea and upon the Earth lifted up his
[32:45] hand to heaven and he swear by him that
[32:47] liveth forever and ever who created
[32:49] heaven and the things that therein are
[32:51] and the earth and the things that are
[32:53] therein and the Sea and the things which
[32:55] are therein that there should be time
[32:57] time no longer so there would be a time
[33:00] this would be silenced but there would
[33:02] be a time where there would no longer be
[33:04] a delay to the know knowing of this to
[33:08] to the understanding of this mystery so
[33:11] he said um but in the days of the voice
[33:15] of the seventh angel when he shall begin
[33:17] the sound the mystery of God should be
[33:19] finished as he had declared to his
[33:22] servants the prophets and the voice
[33:24] which I heard from Heaven spake un me
[33:26] again saying go and take the little book
[33:29] which is open in the hand of the Angel
[33:31] which standeth upon the sea and upon the
[33:34] Earth and I went unto the angel and said
[33:36] unto him give me the little book and he
[33:38] said take it and eat it up and it shall
[33:41] make thy belly bitter but it shall be in
[33:44] thy mouth as sweet as honey and I took
[33:47] the little book out of the Angel's hand
[33:49] and ate it up and it was in my mouth
[33:52] sweet as honey and as soon as I'd eaten
[33:55] it my belly was bitter and he said said
[33:58] unto me thou must prophesy again before
[34:00] many peoples and Nations and tongues and
[34:03] Kings so you know we're looking here in
[34:06] a passage of scripture as I said that is
[34:10] that is mostly
[34:11] symbolic and of course it's something
[34:14] maybe argued and about and and debated
[34:17] on as to the meanings of it and maybe to
[34:20] many as many as much it's very ambiguous
[34:22] and unclear and but it it is something
[34:26] that is written in the word of God God
[34:28] and I believe there are things that we
[34:30] can receive from it today now last
[34:33] Sunday I spoke on by my spirit sayith
[34:36] the Lord which refers to Zechariah
[34:38] Chapter 4's prophecy and that that
[34:41] compares with Revelation 1 which are the
[34:45] seven golden
[34:46] lampstands that received their oil from
[34:50] the two olive trees by the side and of
[34:53] course it had a practical application in
[34:55] the days of Zachariah but it also was
[34:59] picked up in the Book of Revelation and
[35:00] shows it was Christ in the midst of the
[35:04] seven golden candlesticks is said in the
[35:06] King James version seven lampstands in
[35:09] other words that that were lit there
[35:13] originally from the fire of God from the
[35:16] altar of God it would always be lit from
[35:19] the from the fire that came down from
[35:22] heaven and then lit one lap then the
[35:25] next and would lit from the next to the
[35:27] next to the next to the next to the last
[35:30] and it
[35:31] represents seven lampstands represents
[35:36] Seven Ages of which God would do a great
[35:40] work upon the earth now he would hold
[35:42] this blind to the people of the first
[35:45] age because he did not want them to know
[35:48] the revelation of his coming you see if
[35:51] he had told them back in that age it's
[35:53] going to be Seven Ages or 2,000 years
[35:56] before I return
[35:58] then nobody would have died prepared
[36:01] everybody had been dilatory and waiting
[36:03] the gospel would not be spread and it
[36:05] would not go out so God would hold the
[36:09] secret of his coming until the last day
[36:12] and remember it is a mystery because
[36:14] Paul said behold I show you a
[36:17] mystery and so again we it would be
[36:20] reserved unto a latter time this is why
[36:24] these seven Thunders would be spoken but
[36:27] yet remain clouded ambiguous sealed up
[36:31] unclear until the days of the of the
[36:34] voice of the seventh angel when he
[36:36] begins to sound his message then the
[36:38] mystery of God would be finished so now
[36:41] when we consider this we also can take
[36:45] in consideration the coming of the holy
[36:48] spirit that happened on the day of
[36:50] Pentecost this is found in Acts chapter
[36:53] 2 and yet it was the coming of Christ
[36:57] because of the Bible said if you have
[36:58] not the spirit of Christ you are none of
[37:00] his so it was the very Spirit of Christ
[37:03] the very anointing that was upon him the
[37:05] very life of of God coming down there in
[37:10] spirit form it was the Holy Spirit and
[37:13] and Peter when it came down he said this
[37:17] is that which the prophet Joel spoke of
[37:21] and revers to word being expressed and
[37:25] revealed so I want you to know notice it
[37:27] was not it was not just a an emotion
[37:30] that came down it was not just a
[37:32] shouting that come down though that
[37:34] happened there it was not even gifts of
[37:36] the Spirit such as tongues that was
[37:38] displayed it was the person himself
[37:41] coming down and we want to understand
[37:43] when the spirit comes he is also the
[37:46] word because you cannot separate the
[37:48] word from the
[37:50] spirit now so this is why that Joel said
[37:55] what are you seeing I mean Peter said
[37:57] what you're seeing is what Joel said
[38:01] what the Bible said what the word said
[38:03] this is the word coming
[38:05] down this is the message being
[38:09] revealed so here he would say this is
[38:12] that and refers to the word being
[38:14] expressed thus revealed because we must
[38:18] not only have Spirit we must also have
[38:23] truth amen you see you really can't have
[38:27] one without the other because they are
[38:30] one and the same this is why that Peter
[38:34] said of the spirit it's the word of Joel
[38:38] chapter 2 coming down you know that
[38:41] though he said in the last days in the
[38:43] last 2,000 years notice plural last days
[38:47] I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh
[38:50] and my sons and daughters shall
[38:52] prophesy and so the book of Acts Peter
[38:56] would listen Peter specifically
[38:59] references Joel 2 but acts chap 2 and
[39:02] verse 40 says and with many other words
[39:06] did he testify and exhort so we don't
[39:09] have the complete sermon of Peter here
[39:12] do we amen here he preaches and and he
[39:16] has many other
[39:17] words yeah he he preaches this is that
[39:21] and it begins with Joel and words that
[39:24] are being revealed and and made known by
[39:28] manifestation and he says this is that
[39:32] but now there are many other things
[39:35] because you see in the Old Testament
[39:38] there were many references to the coming
[39:42] of the Holy
[39:43] Spirit many references and yet they were
[39:48] were not comprehending it they were not
[39:51] understanding it because to them to the
[39:53] Jewish people one birth was important
[39:56] that was be born of the lineage of
[39:58] Abraham you were in or you were out
[40:01] because of your birth right amen so
[40:05] there there again this is what they look
[40:07] for this birth births me into the
[40:10] Covenant but you
[40:12] see they they did not look for another
[40:15] birth and there was no new birth in the
[40:20] Old
[40:21] Testament amen there was this was a the
[40:24] first doctrine that Jesus preached was
[40:27] you must be born again this is his very
[40:31] first teaching he comes right out of the
[40:34] right out of the box as it was coming
[40:36] out and says here it is you must be born
[40:40] again he's talking to a Master a teacher
[40:43] in Israel Nicodemus and he says what do
[40:45] you mean I got to go back to my mother's
[40:47] womb you see they took everything
[40:49] literally it would be a literal L it
[40:52] would be a literal blood it would be a
[40:54] literal Sac Sabbath all everything of
[40:56] the Lord was literal but you see when
[41:00] when it was here in the New Testament
[41:03] Peter would take and Paul would take the
[41:05] the those things that have been applied
[41:07] literally and show its fulfillment in
[41:10] the New Covenant and so here again there
[41:13] was no nothing that could change the
[41:16] nature of man in the old Covenant the
[41:21] blood of bulls and goats could not take
[41:23] away sin it would take a greater blood
[41:26] than that
[41:28] amen and it wouldn't be I'm just a man's
[41:31] blood because one every man was born in
[41:34] sin like the other so what did God do
[41:37] God made his own
[41:39] blood amen he you see he created a blood
[41:44] cell in the womb of
[41:46] Mary now I want you to get something he
[41:49] wasn't H it was not half you and half
[41:51] Gentile it wasn't half half half man and
[41:55] half God it was God God became flesh God
[41:59] created a blood cell and there there in
[42:03] Mary's womb dust was wrapped around the
[42:07] blood cell and out of that came Jesus
[42:11] Christ the word made
[42:17] flesh now from him would come would as
[42:22] the second Adam would come a whole new
[42:24] creation
[42:27] you see if you're just born of the first
[42:30] creation you're
[42:33] lost you must be of the new
[42:36] creation and it requires a new birth in
[42:40] order for you to be birthed into this
[42:44] you you can't do it by joining you can't
[42:47] join a
[42:49] church and be be in the body come on
[42:52] Amen you you can't you can't say A you
[42:55] know a a catechism
[42:57] and make a make a profession of this or
[42:59] that one way that is by birth and the
[43:04] only way that that birth can come is
[43:06] that the old life of sin die in order to
[43:10] be born
[43:13] again now so as I said there were many
[43:17] things that he could that we could
[43:20] reference you know that
[43:22] um of scriptures of the Old Testament
[43:26] that was pointing to this but again the
[43:29] Jewish people were on a literal law
[43:34] think about this for a moment here on
[43:37] Mount Si this was the first Pentecost it
[43:41] was 50 days 7even weeks after leaving
[43:45] Egypt and they come to Mount
[43:48] Si and at Mount Si they have their first
[43:52] Pentecost or their first 50 day it was
[43:55] their Jubilee it's go be a
[43:58] celebration and there God would give his
[44:01] law and write it in
[44:04] stone amen take his finger and write it
[44:08] in stone so now then you then you come
[44:11] down to through that and look at it real
[44:14] close and we see there were
[44:18] 3,000 died immediately after the law was
[44:23] given because the law can only condemn
[44:27] you it tells you what you did wrong it
[44:31] tells you what displaces God but it
[44:34] doesn't give you the power to live
[44:39] it so here Thou shalt and thou shalt not
[44:43] and thou shalt and thou shalt not and
[44:45] nobody everybody hears it and say we're
[44:47] going to do it and we
[44:50] can't because to offend in one point is
[44:53] guilty of
[44:55] all amen
[44:58] so you see here here again it was it
[45:02] would Paul would call it the law of
[45:04] death because it could not lead you to
[45:08] life but it was as he said a school
[45:11] master or a tutor to lead us or to keep
[45:15] the Jewish people until Christ
[45:19] came because we were going to need a
[45:22] virgin come on someone who didn't know a
[45:26] man so there had been laws and mandates
[45:29] that are put into place to produce a
[45:32] Godly race of people so that out of that
[45:35] would come a
[45:39] messiah now as we would look at this for
[45:42] a moment and there's there's a lot of
[45:44] little trails that we could go there but
[45:47] let's kind of focus in I you know I'm
[45:50] I'm going to take this over to Ezekiel
[45:53] 36 and we're going to look about um I
[45:56] think tell you what I only got 36 in my
[45:58] notes here but let's go to about verse
[46:01] 24 on the screen let me see where we're
[46:04] at
[46:05] Ezekiel if you will all right for I will
[46:09] gather you from among the Heathen and I
[46:12] will gather you out of all your out of
[46:15] all countries and will bring you into
[46:17] your own land now in the days of Ezekiel
[46:22] the the the Jewish people had been
[46:25] exiled down into
[46:28] Babylon and so here God is said I'm
[46:32] going to gather you from the Heathen and
[46:35] I'm going to bring you back into your
[46:36] own land now of course this this is a
[46:40] great prophecy not only of the Jewish
[46:44] people but also of the end time because
[46:47] God is gathering a people as he as we
[46:50] saw you must prophesy again to every
[46:52] Kindred Nation tongue and people so God
[46:55] has a people I'll take you from among
[46:56] the Heathen gather you out of all
[46:58] countries and I'll bring you into your
[47:02] own land I'm going to bring you back to
[47:05] the land of the Bible oh what a land
[47:08] that is amen can you imagine being
[47:11] restored back to the land of the Apostle
[47:13] Paul the Apostle Peter to the land of
[47:16] Jesus where the prophets walk down
[47:19] Through the Ages come on church I'm
[47:21] going to I'm going to restore you back
[47:24] gather you out of all your country and
[47:26] I'll bring you to your own land next
[47:28] verse please notice and then I will
[47:32] sprinkle clean water upon you if you go
[47:36] to the New Testament he said what will I
[47:38] do I'll wash you by the washing of the
[47:41] water of the word because he said I'm
[47:44] going to have a glorious Church Without
[47:47] spider
[47:49] wrinkle amen or any such thing I'm going
[47:53] to wipe away but I'm to do it I'm going
[47:55] to have to SP sprinkle clean water upon
[47:59] you I'm going to wash you by the washing
[48:02] of the Water by the
[48:06] word hallelujah and you shall be clean
[48:11] somebody ought to shout right there amen
[48:15] sinful man being washed made clean
[48:20] Sanctified wash purified by the word of
[48:23] God that's what the word is to do to you
[48:26] amen is not just to go in your memory
[48:28] it's not just to it's not just to Adorn
[48:31] a plaque in your house it is to sanctify
[48:34] and cleanse the people from all your
[48:36] filthiness and from all your Idols will
[48:39] I cleanse
[48:41] you now I'm I'm reading your scriptures
[48:44] that Peter possibly could have referred
[48:51] to because right here he could say look
[48:55] here's where I where you've been brought
[48:56] you have been brought back to the land
[48:59] you've returned here for a purpose the
[49:02] purpose
[49:03] is to see the
[49:06] Messiah and this is a reason that you
[49:09] have come you've been gathered out of
[49:11] the
[49:12] Nations Amen to to get ready for the
[49:15] coming of the Messiah and he said I'll
[49:17] sprinkle This Clean Water upon you and
[49:19] you shall be clean from all your
[49:21] filthiness from all your Idols will I
[49:23] cleanse you next verse a new heart will
[49:26] I I give
[49:27] you and a new spirit will I put within
[49:31] you and I'll take away the Stony heart
[49:34] out of your flesh and I'll give you a
[49:36] heart of Flesh listen the heart you got
[49:39] now is Stony it's resisted go it resists
[49:44] God remember Malachi 4 said that he
[49:47] would turn the heart of the children
[49:50] back to the faith of the fathers so you
[49:53] know it it's kind of like this when you
[49:55] were born you were born with as a magnet
[49:58] with two poles and you were born with
[50:02] with you know with one pole that resist
[50:06] and another that attracts and because of
[50:09] sin your heart was turned wrong you were
[50:12] born in sin as David was saying and I'm
[50:14] combining scriptures here you were born
[50:16] in sin shap in iniquity come to this
[50:19] world speaking lies you were a sinner
[50:23] before you did one thing wrong you were
[50:25] born in sin you were bornn the wrong way
[50:31] you were born with the wrong birth
[50:33] you're going to have to be born
[50:36] again so the poles of your heart
[50:40] resisted God it turned God away it
[50:43] pushed away the things of righteousness
[50:46] and it was attracted on the other side
[50:48] toward
[50:51] sin so you teach a child nothing just
[50:54] raise him up by the hair of his head so
[50:56] do to
[50:57] speak you'll turn out wrong every
[51:01] time right why because you parents are
[51:05] to be like the law of school Master to
[51:08] keep them until Christ comes you see all
[51:12] the training and the upbringing that we
[51:14] do for young people and it's good and
[51:17] it's valuable and it's tutoring it's
[51:19] teaching but it won't save
[51:22] them am man it may train them up in the
[51:25] way they should go
[51:27] it may aim them in the right direction
[51:30] but their heart will always be pulled
[51:32] toward evil the first rock and roll song
[51:35] the verse the verse sins or fornication
[51:39] or whatever were pulled in the wrong
[51:42] direction so every one of you were born
[51:45] with your compass set on
[51:49] hell but you see God had a plan for you
[51:54] and that plan was not to leave you in
[51:57] condition he he when he finds you he
[51:59] don't leave you the way he found you but
[52:01] he comes to turn the
[52:03] heart so the heart that once resisted
[52:06] God now it's pulled toward God I want
[52:09] God I want his word I want his truth I
[52:11] want to be righteous I want to be holy I
[52:14] want to do what God
[52:15] Said and you push away
[52:19] evil because the gospel said the work is
[52:23] to do a work in the heart to turn the
[52:27] heart the heart is
[52:29] Stony I'm going to give you a heart
[52:32] that's pliable that's workable that I
[52:34] can work with you're
[52:37] resistant and I'm going to I'm going to
[52:39] change you
[52:40] back where the heart had become Stony
[52:44] with sin I'm going to change you back
[52:47] and I'm going to have give you a new
[52:49] heart I'm going to give you a desire to
[52:51] do
[52:54] right amen it it's a it's a work of
[52:57] Grace amen it's a work of Grace keep
[53:00] that scripture up please and and he says
[53:03] I'll give you a a new heart and I'll
[53:05] give you a new spirit I'll give you a
[53:08] whole new
[53:10] attitude amen you you're you're going to
[53:14] think different you're I'm going to take
[53:16] the Stony heart out of you I'm going to
[53:18] do a heart
[53:21] transplant oh we we think some of the
[53:24] scientists in this day did the first one
[53:26] no God's been doing it a long time amen
[53:29] I'll give you a new heart I'm going to
[53:32] place in you new thinking now the word
[53:35] of God will be reasonable to you instead
[53:38] of faring in distance and pushed away
[53:40] now it'll be
[53:43] something huh that makes
[53:46] sense oh I see that's
[53:49] right now listen God ain't through with
[53:53] you amen but this is some a problem that
[53:57] many people come down to and they just
[54:00] get that far of just having well I want
[54:03] to do right you know I I I'll make an
[54:06] effort I'll try and then they
[54:09] fail because as I'm speaking this
[54:12] morning only God can move a
[54:16] mountain and the mountain in every
[54:18] person's life is
[54:22] sin that is the obstacle that you're
[54:25] going to have to
[54:28] overcome because you see you cannot go
[54:31] in the presence of God and remain
[54:34] sinful this is why to begin with When
[54:37] sin entered in God slew a lamb and and
[54:40] wrapped him in sheep's
[54:42] clothing or animal
[54:45] skins right amen why because without the
[54:49] shedding of blood there's no remission
[54:51] of sin but you see the blood of an
[54:54] animal would never be worth the the the
[54:56] life of a man so it would have to be
[54:59] offered continually continually
[55:00] continually continually over and over
[55:02] and over and over again until millions
[55:05] of animals would die in the stad of man
[55:08] but yet it only rolled it ahead to a
[55:11] place called to to a time where it would
[55:14] be dealt with when when Jesus would come
[55:17] and empty out paradise those who were
[55:20] waiting for the blood to come the real
[55:23] blood so now he said I'll give you a new
[55:25] heart a new spirit will I put within you
[55:29] I take out the Stony heart give you a
[55:31] heart of Flesh give me the next verse
[55:33] and here's very important I will put my
[55:41] spirit this is not a new
[55:44] thinking this is not a better
[55:46] attitude this is not a good heart this
[55:50] is a his Spirit notice my spirit I will
[55:54] put in you
[55:58] and where you couldn't live it
[56:00] before Hallelujah let me tell you right
[56:03] now only Christ can live the Christian
[56:06] Life I can't do it you can't do it
[56:08] nobody else can do it only Christ can
[56:11] live the Christian Life only
[56:17] Christ and you can try with all you want
[56:19] to and you can join churches and you can
[56:22] you can be a member and you can say your
[56:24] rosaries or you can do whatever of works
[56:26] you want to do nothing will appease the
[56:29] Judgment of
[56:31] God because you're still
[56:36] unrighteous you can't live it I'm
[56:40] telling you I'm telling you I'm telling
[56:43] young people this morning you cannot
[56:45] live this gospel apart from the
[56:51] spirit you can try you can sign pledges
[56:56] with we can give you
[56:58] classes on what to do and what not to do
[57:01] and the
[57:01] dangers and the hurts and the
[57:05] scars but nothing all the psychology in
[57:08] the world will not change
[57:12] you it will not Empower
[57:15] you so he says I will put my spirit
[57:19] within you and will what's now cause
[57:23] you no longer are you doing
[57:26] it amen it's not like a peacock or a
[57:30] blackbird rather putting peacock
[57:31] feathers in and say look now I'm a
[57:33] peacock he's not a peacock he's just a
[57:35] black bird with peacock feathers he's
[57:38] tried to better himself look
[57:41] prettier how many people do
[57:45] that that is a mistake that so many make
[57:48] in religion I well I'm going to be good
[57:51] I'll take the neighbors case of sweet
[57:53] potatoes I'll be nice to the this all of
[57:55] those are good
[57:57] things and things that you should do to
[58:01] to others to other human beings but but
[58:05] that that still isn't it remember
[58:07] because Jesus or Paul said it in 1
[58:10] Corinthians you can lack the you can
[58:13] have actually lack the very basic
[58:16] element of the Holy Spirit which is love
[58:19] which is the basic nature of God CU God
[58:22] is love and he said without charity he
[58:25] said you can give all your goods to feed
[58:29] the
[58:33] poor and yet not even how the
[58:36] basic
[58:38] fundamental
[58:39] foundational thing that God is for God
[58:43] is
[58:50] love so he says I'll put my spirit
[58:54] within you and I will cause
[58:59] you to walk in my
[59:01] statues and you shall keep my
[59:05] judgments and do
[59:11] them isn't this
[59:14] amazing here he was speaking about a new
[59:17] birth here he was speaking about what
[59:20] would happen with the coming of That
[59:23] Power from on
[59:24] high amen here's what it would do it
[59:27] would wash you with clean water it would
[59:29] be the word to purify you it will be him
[59:33] putting a new spirit a new heart in you
[59:35] but more importantly and most
[59:37] importantly is put my spirit in you to
[59:41] enable you to do what you couldn't do on
[59:46] your
[59:50] own now as we're looking at this I want
[59:54] just to go
[59:57] also to to another for he would say in
[1:00:01] Isaiah 2811 and this is also referred to
[1:00:04] by the Apostle Paul as as he speaks
[1:00:08] about the the the gifts of the
[1:00:11] Spirit within the church he actually
[1:00:13] refers to this and and he says in verse
[1:00:17] 11 for with stamin lips and other
[1:00:19] tongues will he speak to his people to
[1:00:21] whom he said this is the rest wherein
[1:00:25] you will may cause the weary to rest and
[1:00:28] this is the
[1:00:30] refreshing so again here again you see
[1:00:33] here with with Israel uh there the
[1:00:37] Jewish people gathered at there at the
[1:00:39] on the day of Pentecost Peter's
[1:00:42] preaching he could have very well
[1:00:44] referred to this scripture for with ston
[1:00:47] lips and other tongues will I speak to
[1:00:50] this
[1:00:51] people to whom he said this is the rest
[1:00:54] wherewith you may call the weary to
[1:00:57] rest this is the
[1:01:00] refreshing oh my when we speak of that
[1:01:03] and it being the Holy Spirit friend the
[1:01:06] the holy spirit is our
[1:01:10] rest oh yes I know he said you know
[1:01:13] honor the Sabbath day and keep it holy
[1:01:16] and many people do that and it's there's
[1:01:20] nothing wrong with resting or whatever
[1:01:22] else or having a day of rest we come as
[1:01:24] Christians like this morning because we
[1:01:26] as Christians we honor the resurrection
[1:01:29] he rose on the first day of the week so
[1:01:32] that's why we assemble together today
[1:01:34] because we are gathering here
[1:01:36] remembering his
[1:01:39] resurrection and also we would find the
[1:01:41] apostles would do the same on the first
[1:01:44] day of the week but for the Jews they
[1:01:47] were given a day again they had literal
[1:01:50] Lambs they had literal sacrifices they
[1:01:52] had literal you know everything was
[1:01:55] literally literal literal literal so a
[1:01:57] literal
[1:02:00] Sabbath and remember if you fail to keep
[1:02:04] that
[1:02:05] Sabbath you would be
[1:02:08] slain in as much to pick up a stick on
[1:02:11] that day to do
[1:02:13] anything amen that would actually
[1:02:15] crucify Jesus because he healed on the
[1:02:19] Sabbath this would be one of their
[1:02:23] reasons that the Judgment of God could
[1:02:26] come upon him and they could unleash the
[1:02:29] Vengeance that was in their
[1:02:31] hearts but notice again you see again we
[1:02:36] have a Sabbath and our Sabbath is not a
[1:02:39] literal day our lital our Sabbath is
[1:02:44] this
[1:02:45] rest when the Holy Spirit comes you
[1:02:48] enter into your
[1:02:51] Sabbath which is the rest where that you
[1:02:55] who are Laden and labored in sin can
[1:02:59] come and rest from your
[1:03:02] labors no longer are you a slave for to
[1:03:06] sin no longer are you
[1:03:13] bound oh think about this grace of
[1:03:17] almighty
[1:03:18] God so when we look and we consider
[1:03:22] these
[1:03:23] scriptures we consider even Acts chapter
[1:03:27] 2 of the descending of the spirit from
[1:03:30] Heaven yet it was
[1:03:33] not it was not Spirit only but Peter
[1:03:37] made it clear it's also the Covenant
[1:03:40] it's the
[1:03:42] book amen it's the word it's the
[1:03:45] doctrine of truth because truth itself
[1:03:49] is spirit amen the words that I speak
[1:03:52] Jesus said are spirit and Truth amen
[1:03:56] so it is so it is even called in the
[1:03:59] Bible the Holy Ghost when he the spirit
[1:04:02] of Truth is
[1:04:05] come so on the on the day of Pentecost
[1:04:09] there it was it was more than a motion
[1:04:12] being poured out though they got
[1:04:15] emotional amen though they were speaking
[1:04:17] in languages and they heard them from
[1:04:21] all various languages what were they
[1:04:23] doing what was they saying they were
[1:04:25] praising pring
[1:04:27] God it was a yes they had been filled
[1:04:30] with God's spirit and they had been
[1:04:33] drunk on the new wine and it was just
[1:04:36] overflowing out of their lives and they
[1:04:38] were praising God and giving honor to
[1:04:41] him worshiping
[1:04:44] him so yeah there was emotion in it but
[1:04:47] it wasn't
[1:04:49] emotion it was the spirit
[1:04:54] descending and when when it descended
[1:04:57] Peter says this is
[1:05:03] scripture this is
[1:05:07] word this is prophecy coming
[1:05:12] down this is that which the prophet Joel
[1:05:15] spoke of and the Book of the Covenant
[1:05:18] was open to them and a a New and Living
[1:05:23] Way
[1:05:26] hallelujah amen you see it was no longer
[1:05:30] close to them you see John the Baptist
[1:05:34] had come preaching a very strange
[1:05:36] Doctrine to their
[1:05:39] ears he was preaching about a lamb
[1:05:43] coming and they had had hundreds if not
[1:05:47] thousands of maybe Millions by now of
[1:05:52] lambs but John says there's a lamb
[1:05:57] coming that is going to take away the
[1:05:59] sin of the
[1:06:00] world and he said it's a
[1:06:03] person and I'll know him when I see him
[1:06:07] because it'll be the one that the spirit
[1:06:09] ascends and the descends upon and
[1:06:17] abides so now out of the descending of
[1:06:20] the spirit in Acts
[1:06:23] two here would it was the word coming it
[1:06:26] was not closed
[1:06:29] now understanding Enlightenment of what
[1:06:32] God had his
[1:06:34] plan you know was being made known so so
[1:06:38] again um instead of a woolly lamb they
[1:06:42] now
[1:06:43] understood that it was the Lamb of
[1:06:47] God the real lamb that all these others
[1:06:51] only prophesied of because they were
[1:06:54] speaking of but now the real
[1:06:57] blood a blood that would take away the
[1:07:00] sins of the world not just sins in that
[1:07:03] day but sins
[1:07:06] passed Those Old Testament saints that
[1:07:09] were collected into a place called
[1:07:11] Paradise where they were waiting in
[1:07:13] Abraham's bosom in other words Abraham's
[1:07:15] promise and they're waiting there until
[1:07:17] the Redeemer
[1:07:19] come Hallelujah but that day on Calvary
[1:07:23] their sins were paid in full
[1:07:27] amen the things they could not keep of
[1:07:29] the law were now paid in full and now
[1:07:32] they were perfect before God and
[1:07:34] resurrected the Bible said in Matthew
[1:07:37] chapter 28 they rose with
[1:07:41] him many of the saints that slept
[1:07:45] Rose when he
[1:07:48] raised you see Jesus resurrection wasn't
[1:07:52] only for himself but all of those from
[1:07:55] the Old
[1:07:59] Testament
[1:08:01] now
[1:08:02] soever promise contained in the
[1:08:05] scripture or yeah in the scripture was
[1:08:09] contained or
[1:08:11] encapsulated in the spirit descending it
[1:08:14] was God the word God the spirit it was
[1:08:19] the Holy Ghost coming
[1:08:22] down now out of the descending of the
[1:08:24] spirit in Acts chapter 2 came the
[1:08:27] Apostle
[1:08:28] Paul this was a direct
[1:08:32] result of the descending of the Holy
[1:08:35] Spirit was men like Paul now Paul would
[1:08:39] be the first messenger of the age he
[1:08:41] would write he would write the the
[1:08:44] majority of our new
[1:08:46] testament it would be him that would
[1:08:48] separate law from
[1:08:50] grace and it and all of this came
[1:08:53] because of the outpouring of the spirit
[1:08:56] word on the day of
[1:08:59] Pentecost now so the descending of the
[1:09:02] spirit in Acts two here came the Apostle
[1:09:04] Paul the prophet of the age who being
[1:09:06] filled with the spirit began to explore
[1:09:09] the riches of the
[1:09:12] Covenant the Bible
[1:09:14] said he explained it I believe it's in
[1:09:17] Galatians 1 where he explains it where
[1:09:19] he says you know I didn't confer with
[1:09:21] any man I didn't even confer with the
[1:09:24] apostles I went to the desert for 3
[1:09:27] years over into Arabia and there I
[1:09:30] studied the
[1:09:32] scripture and it was revealed to me now
[1:09:36] Paul would take then the Old Testament
[1:09:39] uh things that were there that God would
[1:09:42] do for a reason for a type and whatever
[1:09:45] such as the priesthood and and um the
[1:09:48] blood and the blood offering and all of
[1:09:49] the he would explain it to the Hebrew
[1:09:52] people he would tell them it's no longer
[1:09:55] blood of bulls and goats it will not
[1:09:57] take away sin you remember this the day
[1:10:00] that Jesus died animal blood would no
[1:10:02] longer a town for
[1:10:05] sin it may have worked when when Abraham
[1:10:08] drug his lamb up it may have worked when
[1:10:12] Abel offered it the first time it it
[1:10:15] worked in other time but it would not
[1:10:17] work as a bleach it only worked as a
[1:10:21] covering so it would be like sin and
[1:10:24] then a stain of a shirt and over it at a
[1:10:28] paint now God can't see it but there
[1:10:32] it's just there's a stain there that's
[1:10:34] been covered over with something it's
[1:10:37] out of
[1:10:38] sight but it's still
[1:10:40] there that was a problem with the Old
[1:10:43] Testament the old nature and it's the
[1:10:46] thing that made them do
[1:10:49] it was still
[1:10:52] there now out of the descending of the
[1:10:54] spirit in Acts 2 came the Apostle Paul
[1:10:58] and he began to explore the riches of
[1:11:00] the Covenant he shared the details of
[1:11:02] the book of The Inheritance that was
[1:11:05] brought down on the day of Pentecost now
[1:11:09] again I I want you to see when the
[1:11:10] spirit descended it was the
[1:11:14] Covenant
[1:11:16] descending Peter said this is
[1:11:20] that now so when it did when Paul as
[1:11:23] Paul poured over the book of the
[1:11:26] Covenant he revealed or told us of the
[1:11:31] mystery truths of the
[1:11:35] Bible so now he would write about the
[1:11:40] godhead he would write about water
[1:11:44] baptism he would write about the baptism
[1:11:48] of the Holy Ghost he would write about
[1:11:52] predestination that we were we were
[1:11:55] chosen in him before the foundation of
[1:11:57] the world that our our our origin did
[1:12:02] not begin with our natural birth but it
[1:12:05] was there in the mind of God before the
[1:12:08] foundation of the world and therefore
[1:12:11] you're part of
[1:12:13] Eternity hallelujah amen you can say as
[1:12:17] Jesus said I came from God his thoughts
[1:12:20] his thinking his attributes and I'm
[1:12:23] going back to God
[1:12:28] I am here on this Earth from heaven
[1:12:31] therefore I am not just a citizen of
[1:12:34] this world I'm a citizen of
[1:12:38] Heaven therefore I look and I act and I
[1:12:41] dress like the place I am
[1:12:45] from
[1:12:47] hallelujah amen oh yeah he would preach
[1:12:49] of election he would preach of marriage
[1:12:52] and divorce he would preach a
[1:12:55] of of the priesthood and and and and you
[1:12:59] know Jesus Jesus did not qualify not be
[1:13:02] being that he was not a levite but of
[1:13:04] the tribe of Judah in his Earthly
[1:13:08] lineage he would be of the tribe of Juda
[1:13:11] he would call be called The Lion of
[1:13:13] Judah he come through the king Lon and
[1:13:16] the King could not offer
[1:13:18] sacrifices a priest had to come from
[1:13:21] Levi the tribe of Levi a king had to
[1:13:23] come from the lineage of Judah
[1:13:25] to mix them you remember a king tried to
[1:13:27] do that one day and offered incense on
[1:13:29] the Altar and they told him don't do it
[1:13:32] and leprosy struck him because why he
[1:13:36] mixed the offices him being from Judah
[1:13:39] had no right to the
[1:13:41] priesthood so how did Jesus have it
[1:13:43] because Jesus did not come in the
[1:13:46] lineage of Aaron Jesus came in the order
[1:13:49] of
[1:13:51] MDC amen who was without mother without
[1:13:54] father without
[1:13:55] of days or ending of Life whoever he was
[1:13:58] he's still here he's
[1:14:00] Eternal it was
[1:14:02] God come on church amen so he came from
[1:14:06] the lineage of of MDC who was Priest he
[1:14:11] was king of Salem priest of the most
[1:14:14] high God so therefore as MDC he could be
[1:14:18] both priest and
[1:14:22] King hallelujah hallelujah Hal
[1:14:25] hallelujah amen when I think of there in
[1:14:28] in Revelation chap 5 and I think of of
[1:14:33] what was happening there when um John
[1:14:36] saw the book that was closed and sealed
[1:14:39] up with Seven Seals and no man was
[1:14:44] worthy a search was made Abraham wasn't
[1:14:49] worthy Noah wasn't worthy Enoch wasn't
[1:14:53] worthy Elijah the great prophet was not
[1:14:57] worthy no man was worthy to take the
[1:15:01] book it was the
[1:15:03] Covenant man had lost it it was sealed
[1:15:07] up now with Seven
[1:15:10] Seals now then what about it no man was
[1:15:14] worthy to even look on
[1:15:18] it did you notice in Revelation 10 that
[1:15:22] John is told not just to look on it but
[1:15:25] to take
[1:15:26] it so in Revelation 5 there was the
[1:15:31] there was the book and no man was worthy
[1:15:34] and John began to weep because he says
[1:15:37] if we don't find a worthy
[1:15:41] man remember it wasn't God that lost the
[1:15:44] book it was man that lost the title to
[1:15:47] the Earth and to The Inheritance to the
[1:15:49] Covenant and it went back in the hands
[1:15:51] of God again waiting until a Worthy man
[1:15:55] could
[1:15:56] come amen and none of them was worthy
[1:15:59] and N nothing of the law could make them
[1:16:01] worthy and the blood of bulls and goats
[1:16:04] couldn't so God when you couldn't go up
[1:16:07] into
[1:16:08] heaven God came down to earth
[1:16:11] hallelujah amen oh Hallelujah when you
[1:16:15] couldn't have sin there he came down
[1:16:18] here to make a way for you to go
[1:16:22] there that's why he could say I am the
[1:16:25] way I am the truth and I am the life and
[1:16:29] no one can come to the father except by
[1:16:33] me because he would be the worthy one as
[1:16:37] the kinsman redeemer with the wealth to
[1:16:40] pay for
[1:16:42] it no other man had the
[1:16:45] wealth man couldn't pay for his own sins
[1:16:48] we were we owed a debt we could not
[1:16:52] pay and then He Paid a Debt he did not
[1:17:00] owe what a wonderful
[1:17:02] savior what an almighty
[1:17:05] God what a loving
[1:17:08] father that God would wrap
[1:17:13] himself
[1:17:14] in
[1:17:17] Earth and walk among
[1:17:20] men and even experience the temptation
[1:17:25] of sin which he could not do as God cuz
[1:17:29] God cannot be
[1:17:31] tempted but in becoming a man he could
[1:17:34] bear our
[1:17:38] sorrows this is what makes him such a
[1:17:41] high
[1:17:42] priest this is why it makes him such an
[1:17:45] advocate is because he can say I know
[1:17:49] how you
[1:17:52] feel no longer was he a distant God
[1:17:56] there just invisible out there but God
[1:17:58] became visible the Bible said great is
[1:18:01] the mystery of
[1:18:02] godliness 1 Timothy 3:16 put it up for
[1:18:05] me 1 Timothy 3:16 where he said great is
[1:18:08] the mystery of
[1:18:10] godliness think of this without
[1:18:13] controversy great as a mystery of
[1:18:15] Godless God was manifested in the flesh
[1:18:19] Hallelujah justified in the spirit seen
[1:18:23] of angels preached to the Gentiles
[1:18:26] believed on the world and received up in
[1:18:28] the
[1:18:30] Glory Hallelujah this is why when John
[1:18:33] starts out talking about him he don't go
[1:18:36] to some Earthly genealogy but no that
[1:18:39] eagle Prophet e with eagle eyes he looks
[1:18:42] Way Beyond of Joseph and a Mary and
[1:18:44] looks Way Beyond human lineage and he
[1:18:47] goes in he says in the beginning was the
[1:18:52] word and the word was with God and the
[1:18:55] Word was God and the word became
[1:19:00] flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld
[1:19:04] his glory as the only begotten of the
[1:19:07] father full of grace favor and
[1:19:14] Truth
[1:19:15] again God would come down
[1:19:19] there to take to redeem man going back
[1:19:23] to Revelation 5 now in our
[1:19:25] thinking so there is John weeping no
[1:19:30] man's
[1:19:31] worthy no one if the if the book isn't
[1:19:34] taken all creation is
[1:19:36] lost it's all for
[1:19:40] nothing and there's a strong angel that
[1:19:43] cries out and said who is
[1:19:45] worthy to take the book in Luke and
[1:19:48] loose the seal so it was looking for a
[1:19:51] worthy man
[1:19:56] and and John begins to weep because no
[1:20:00] man was found search was made through
[1:20:04] all through the Earth no man was found
[1:20:06] said weep not John for the
[1:20:09] lion of the tribe of
[1:20:12] Judah ha
[1:20:16] prevailed think about what we're saying
[1:20:18] now the lion of the tribe of Judah the
[1:20:22] King has prevailed
[1:20:25] sir amen now look the
[1:20:29] king you don't want to face his
[1:20:33] wrath you don't want to F you know
[1:20:36] people want Justice you don't want God's
[1:20:40] justice you want God's
[1:20:43] mercy you want God's pardon you want his
[1:20:46] forgiveness you don't want Justice if we
[1:20:48] got what we deserve we'd go to hell
[1:21:00] so he turns and hears that there's the
[1:21:03] lion of the tribe of Judah the
[1:21:09] king he's prevailed to take the book and
[1:21:13] loose the seals and he says and I turn
[1:21:18] to see the
[1:21:20] lion and there stood a lamb
[1:21:26] Hallelujah I stood I saw a lamb there
[1:21:30] when I saw him I didn't see a judge who
[1:21:34] would condemn me I saw a lamb who would
[1:21:37] redeem
[1:21:40] me this is why he had to be
[1:21:43] MDC because he's priest and
[1:21:51] King
[1:21:53] notice as we look at this for a moment
[1:21:56] and we look into the the the symbology
[1:21:59] of this today I want you to
[1:22:03] consider as as we look at the word
[1:22:07] coming down the spirit on the day of
[1:22:10] Pentecost as I said it's the word of
[1:22:12] Joel 2 coming down it's the word of
[1:22:14] Ezekiel 36:26 it's the word of Isaiah
[1:22:18] 2819 coming down it's the book of the
[1:22:20] Covenant
[1:22:22] encapsulated in the spirit
[1:22:27] and of the mystery
[1:22:28] truth Paul and those who were born of
[1:22:31] the spirit of his age lacked
[1:22:36] nothing in so much and Paul said if you
[1:22:39] come with something
[1:22:41] else and John would say in his book of
[1:22:44] Revelation to add to
[1:22:47] this to brings a new doctrine to present
[1:22:50] a new
[1:22:52] Jesus to come with something different
[1:22:56] he's under a double
[1:22:59] curse so you
[1:23:02] see they lacked
[1:23:06] nothing but what they didn't have was
[1:23:15] us let that sink in for a moment they
[1:23:19] lack nothing of the mystery
[1:23:23] truths but but what they didn't have was
[1:23:28] [Music]
[1:23:30] us you see without us they are not
[1:23:40] complete you see there were more names
[1:23:43] in the
[1:23:45] book so he could look the book
[1:23:47] represents the Believers that's who you
[1:23:49] are amen and and and again that's what
[1:23:53] salvation is salvation is really
[1:23:55] recognizing your name in the
[1:23:58] book and it isn't put on at the altar it
[1:24:02] was put on when the lamb was slain
[1:24:05] before the foundation of the world you
[1:24:08] were identified with him and in
[1:24:13] him therefore you're not a temporal
[1:24:15] being you are an eternal being but you
[1:24:18] have discovered by salvation who your
[1:24:21] real father is and the real source of
[1:24:24] your life and where you came from and
[1:24:26] where you're
[1:24:35] going so you're really not even saved at
[1:24:39] an altar that's when you recognize what
[1:24:40] Jesus did for
[1:24:43] you your name isn't put on the role when
[1:24:46] you come to the
[1:24:50] altar your name was there before the
[1:24:53] foundation of the world
[1:24:57] let me give let me give you a couple of
[1:24:58] scripture Revelation 138 put that up for
[1:25:01] me Revelation
[1:25:05] 138 watch he talking about the the the
[1:25:09] the Beast and all will be worshiped and
[1:25:11] all that dwell upon the Earth shall
[1:25:13] worship Him the Beast whose names are
[1:25:16] not written in the Book of Life of the
[1:25:19] lamb slain before the foundation of the
[1:25:22] world all right give me 17
[1:25:31] and8 the Beast that th saw was and is
[1:25:34] not shall Ascend out of the bottomless
[1:25:36] pit shall go into predition and they
[1:25:38] that dwell on the Earth shall wonder
[1:25:40] whose names were not written in the Book
[1:25:42] of
[1:25:43] Life somebody read the rest of this with
[1:25:45] me from the foundation of the
[1:25:50] world so your names were written before
[1:25:54] the world began God knew you were
[1:25:57] [Applause]
[1:26:00] coming you're no
[1:26:02] accident he knew every child of
[1:26:06] his somebody said to me brother Tim I
[1:26:09] don't believe I don't believe that that
[1:26:12] in hell I said well why not he said I
[1:26:14] don't believe that God would burn his
[1:26:16] own children in hell I said I don't
[1:26:18] either I said hell was created for the
[1:26:20] devil and his angels not one of his
[1:26:22] children will be in hell that why Jesus
[1:26:25] came he came Because of
[1:26:27] You Hallelujah you needed God you needed
[1:26:31] a savior and he needed you because you
[1:26:35] were in his family album before the
[1:26:38] world
[1:26:40] began Hallelujah when God made his book
[1:26:44] up in his mind before the foundational
[1:26:46] world he knew you were coming he'll not
[1:26:49] have to set an extra plate in heaven he
[1:26:52] won't have to scr up another robe he
[1:26:54] won't hunt up another Crown he knew you
[1:26:57] were coming and he said I go to prepare
[1:27:01] a place for you so that where I am there
[1:27:05] you may be
[1:27:06] [Applause]
[1:27:17] also and God was so determined you
[1:27:19] wouldn't go to hell that he went there
[1:27:22] for you
[1:27:24] and he defeated death Hell In The Grave
[1:27:27] come on church he preached to the
[1:27:30] spirits that were in prison according to
[1:27:32] the into the the the Bible in second
[1:27:34] Peter come on Amen there and he rose
[1:27:37] there and when he rose the Saints rose
[1:27:39] with him for he by his blood had cleared
[1:27:44] the deed of the Old
[1:27:47] Testament the book was open and
[1:27:51] cleared he cleared it so much
[1:27:54] the Old Testament Saints Rose from the
[1:27:56] grave and were
[1:27:58] glorified because of this and because of
[1:28:01] this they could go in the presence of
[1:28:06] God now on the day of
[1:28:09] Pentecost Jesus Through the descending
[1:28:13] of his Spirit sent back the abstract or
[1:28:16] the cleared deed to the
[1:28:19] living now these new testament Saints
[1:28:24] that were
[1:28:25] there and and and don't miss my point
[1:28:28] there I I I maybe I brushed over it let
[1:28:32] me go back again and listen close on the
[1:28:35] day of
[1:28:36] Pentecost Jesus Through the descending
[1:28:39] of his Spirit sent back the
[1:28:42] abstract or clear deed to the
[1:28:46] living now he had already cleared it for
[1:28:49] the Old
[1:28:50] Testament but he's got to do something
[1:28:52] for the living
[1:28:56] amen and these new testament people
[1:29:00] there on the day of Pentecost were
[1:29:03] receiving a cleared deed I'm pouring out
[1:29:07] my spirit upon All Flesh because I have
[1:29:12] cleared their deeds I have removed their
[1:29:15] sins from them and now wonders of
[1:29:19] Wonders I'm not just anointing men and
[1:29:22] women I'm coming and dwelling in
[1:29:28] them and in do this your deed of all
[1:29:32] your past had to be
[1:29:37] cleansed and only one blood can do
[1:29:41] it only one thing can do
[1:29:44] it Church joining Church attendance good
[1:29:48] works none of it will do
[1:29:52] it now these new New Testament Saints
[1:29:56] would have been
[1:30:02] raptured but they ran out of
[1:30:06] time before the last name could be
[1:30:08] manifested upon the Earth again all they
[1:30:12] lacked was
[1:30:15] us and I speak of us as the last
[1:30:18] age CU I believe we're living in the
[1:30:21] last
[1:30:22] days so all they lack was us you said
[1:30:26] well how come well because unlike
[1:30:29] receiving the spirit you can receive the
[1:30:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost on one day I
[1:30:34] receive it on another I may have
[1:30:37] received it 50 years ago you might have
[1:30:38] received it last week everyone receives
[1:30:42] that individually it's not collectively
[1:30:45] we don't all get it at
[1:30:48] once
[1:30:49] right so but the Rapture is a Collective
[1:30:56] event and none of us can Rapture without
[1:30:59] the
[1:31:03] other amen so you see which is so unlike
[1:31:07] our own personal experience you know
[1:31:10] because I receive the Holy Ghost one day
[1:31:11] you receive your experience another but
[1:31:13] the rapture we must all go
[1:31:17] together so like the early
[1:31:20] Saints we are waiting also
[1:31:25] I'm trying to tell you something if God
[1:31:28] is bringing a restoration in this day
[1:31:30] and restored mystery truths to us that
[1:31:33] Paul
[1:31:34] taught then all we're waiting on is the
[1:31:38] last
[1:31:42] one the last one name to that's in the
[1:31:46] book to be manifested on the
[1:31:49] earth remember as I said God wanted more
[1:31:54] than just a creation God wanted a
[1:31:57] family he wanted Sons and Daughters this
[1:32:00] is why Jesus come to be the head the
[1:32:04] first the first born of many Brethren or
[1:32:07] the first of the new
[1:32:09] race that all others would come from
[1:32:13] him notice now as we're as we're looking
[1:32:16] at this you know and and so God had a
[1:32:20] family album that he in his mind he
[1:32:23] through your
[1:32:25] name and I want to say he took a picture
[1:32:29] of
[1:32:30] you when you were at your
[1:32:40] best
[1:32:42] Hallelujah my goodness you think man I
[1:32:46] my best when I was 19 when I was 18 I I
[1:32:49] tell you when I when I was this I when I
[1:32:51] when I got when I was 25 when I reached
[1:32:53] 30 I was my
[1:32:56] best and I got to tell you you have
[1:32:59] never yet been your
[1:33:07] best but he took a picture of you of
[1:33:10] your
[1:33:11] best without
[1:33:13] defilement come on not marred by
[1:33:17] sin a body that never smoked never drank
[1:33:22] never fornicated never committed
[1:33:24] adultery come on a body that matches the
[1:33:27] soul within you he took a picture of you
[1:33:30] at your
[1:33:33] best Hallelujah and one day one day
[1:33:36] you're going to step into your
[1:33:40] bestie Hallelujah you're going to step
[1:33:42] into your
[1:33:44] theophany you and the thought that God
[1:33:47] had his word before the foundational
[1:33:49] world will become one and we shall be
[1:33:52] changed in a moment
[1:33:54] in a twinkling of an
[1:34:02] eye every blemish gone no blemish no
[1:34:05] stain no remembrance of
[1:34:08] sin with a body like his own glorious
[1:34:14] body how wonderful is
[1:34:18] that so we're waiting for the last one's
[1:34:21] name to be manifested on the Earth
[1:34:24] and some of them can take a long time
[1:34:26] even for a predestine seed to find out
[1:34:28] who they are they'll go through life a
[1:34:31] long time some of them might be 90 years
[1:34:33] old and they figur it
[1:34:35] out really they never figure it out God
[1:34:37] reveals it to him when the when he sends
[1:34:40] a spirit of adoption into your heart you
[1:34:42] cry ABA father or you recognize God is
[1:34:44] your
[1:34:46] father that is the spirit of adoption by
[1:34:49] receiving the Holy Ghost so so again
[1:34:53] Revelation 102 is the descending of
[1:34:58] Christ but it is in spirit form now
[1:35:01] we're going back to the Book of
[1:35:02] Revelation that we read about in in
[1:35:04] chapter 10 and so it's the descendant of
[1:35:08] Christ I saw another Mighty
[1:35:13] angel now why in the world is the
[1:35:16] Angel why an angel I thought I thought
[1:35:19] you were saying is Christ I I I I
[1:35:22] thought you were saying it it's the
[1:35:24] theophonic Christ there well you
[1:35:27] remember in the first Exodus there was a
[1:35:31] pillar of fire in a bush and the bush
[1:35:34] didn't
[1:35:35] burn and and Moses draws near and he
[1:35:38] says he said there was the angel Lord
[1:35:40] was in the bush and then it said God
[1:35:42] spoke out of the
[1:35:44] Bush and he said I
[1:35:46] am that I am
[1:35:51] yes and I'm sending you down to
[1:35:54] Egypt for he says I've heard the Cry of
[1:35:58] my children and I am come
[1:36:01] down to
[1:36:04] deliver so now when you compare that
[1:36:07] with that and knowing that we're in
[1:36:08] another Exodus or Rapture AG then you
[1:36:11] know that Christ must
[1:36:16] descend yes yes yes yes yes we are not
[1:36:20] in any way doing away with the literal
[1:36:22] physical coming of Jesus Christ we are
[1:36:25] not in any way uh uh saying there will
[1:36:28] be no meeting in the air where we meet
[1:36:30] the literal Lord Jesus in physical
[1:36:36] form that's not what we're
[1:36:38] saying we're saying here that just as he
[1:36:41] came down in in Exodus 3 just as he came
[1:36:45] down on the day of Pentecost it was not
[1:36:48] another God the same God in Revelation
[1:36:51] 10 he comes down as the messenger of his
[1:36:54] own Covenant angel means
[1:36:57] messenger and he comes and and he's
[1:37:01] coming in his full Glory I mean there
[1:37:04] there's you
[1:37:05] know the Song of Solomon said you know
[1:37:08] he's hiding behind the
[1:37:11] lattice and this is the way you know I
[1:37:14] see him but he you know I I I can't get
[1:37:16] a clear picture of him this is the way
[1:37:18] it's been down through the Bible they
[1:37:21] would see him but they wouldn't get a
[1:37:23] complete picture of him they were
[1:37:26] looking through tights and
[1:37:28] shadows they didn't mean understand what
[1:37:30] they were
[1:37:32] seeing come on when Abel drug up his
[1:37:34] lamb to be sacrificed he wasn't
[1:37:36] realizing there was coming a real lamb
[1:37:39] one day and he was only prophesying of
[1:37:42] this
[1:37:43] event come on when Abraham would take
[1:37:45] and put the wood on his son and go up to
[1:37:48] up Mount Mariah he didn't know he was
[1:37:51] prophesying that one day God God son
[1:37:53] would take The Old Rugged Cross on that
[1:37:56] same
[1:37:58] mountain and and God would provide a
[1:38:02] lamb right then God provided a lamb it
[1:38:05] was a lamb hung in a Thicket by its
[1:38:07] horns and that's exactly was the power
[1:38:10] of God held Jesus Christ there to the
[1:38:15] Cross cuz he surrendered his own
[1:38:18] will to be able to die for us
[1:38:25] so in Revelation 10 the descendant of
[1:38:28] Christ and spirit form in Acts 2 like
[1:38:31] acts two it brings the same
[1:38:35] truths that the apostles had it is not a
[1:38:38] new
[1:38:41] gospel for if we preach any other gospel
[1:38:46] than what Paul delivered we're cursed
[1:38:49] people
[1:38:54] it is not something new but however
[1:38:56] Through the
[1:38:58] Ages it had slowly been closed and
[1:39:01] sealed up as shown having Seven Seals
[1:39:06] that had kept anybody from really
[1:39:10] understanding as I would say they would
[1:39:12] look to the
[1:39:14] lattice they would probe in the book
[1:39:17] they would gather certain truths but
[1:39:20] according to Revelation 10 it wouldn't
[1:39:23] be made known to the days of the voice
[1:39:25] of the seventh angel when he began the
[1:39:28] sound then the mystery of God would be
[1:39:30] finished note the the closing of the
[1:39:33] book was not the work of Christ Jesus
[1:39:37] did not close the book on
[1:39:39] us he didn't close the truths on godhead
[1:39:43] predestination eternal security uh the
[1:39:47] the the original s he didn't close the
[1:39:48] book on
[1:39:50] that he didn't seal it away from us
[1:39:54] what was it out comes when the first
[1:39:57] seal is open something that looks like
[1:40:00] Christ but it's an
[1:40:03] impostor he's riding a white horse but
[1:40:06] it isn't Christ it's the
[1:40:12] Antichrist and as he
[1:40:14] begins and and Paul would say I fear
[1:40:17] that what happened with Eve the garden
[1:40:20] would happen to the church that she
[1:40:22] would lose her
[1:40:25] virginity I want to present you this is
[1:40:28] Bible this is this is the book of
[1:40:30] Corinthians he says I want to present
[1:40:31] you as a chased virgin but I fear that L
[1:40:36] by any means that you're going to be
[1:40:38] deceived like Eve was
[1:40:44] deceived and you get away from the
[1:40:47] Simplicity that's in Christ and you
[1:40:50] would and he said and and they would
[1:40:52] come and preach a another
[1:40:56] Jesus now I tell you what we got them
[1:40:59] full today we don't just have one
[1:41:02] Jesus we got many
[1:41:06] Jesus the Baptist made them one crafted
[1:41:09] him in their theology in their schools
[1:41:11] of learning the way they wanted him the
[1:41:14] the the Catholics made him you know you
[1:41:16] got to you got to mind your
[1:41:19] mama so you pray to her instead of me to
[1:41:23] of God so this Jesus was crafted by
[1:41:26] Catholic theologians we got all kinds of
[1:41:28] jesuses out there and if you're on a
[1:41:31] search there's 40,000 of them different
[1:41:34] denominations all claiming to be
[1:41:39] Christians but there's only one
[1:41:45] way now I want you to think of this
[1:41:48] beginning of the first age the
[1:41:50] Antichrist begin to close the truth now
[1:41:52] he would change and it would be the same
[1:41:55] writer but in the next seal it would be
[1:41:58] red because now he takes a sword and he
[1:42:01] begins to kill and now they begin to
[1:42:04] exterminate the True Believers in the
[1:42:06] age and they will kill just in Fox's
[1:42:09] book of martyrology alone 68
[1:42:16] million and and then you know then then
[1:42:19] it would come to where even the godhead
[1:42:21] was paganized into three and The Trinity
[1:42:24] and unbiblical word was instituted and
[1:42:27] became the foundational dogma of the
[1:42:30] church and to restore this back to the
[1:42:33] way Paul taught
[1:42:35] it and the way that way the bible let me
[1:42:38] let me just tell you all the way through
[1:42:40] this is a one God
[1:42:42] Bible here oh Israel the Lord thy God is
[1:42:45] one
[1:42:46] Lord one Lord One Faith one baptism one
[1:42:50] God one father of his all
[1:42:55] you say what in the world happened
[1:42:56] brother Tim well God wanted a family and
[1:43:00] in order to do that he created a body
[1:43:04] thus become the
[1:43:06] son because he was Offspring made by
[1:43:10] Spirit God in the womb of
[1:43:12] Mary and he walked here upon the Earth
[1:43:16] in the office of
[1:43:17] sunship and then he ascended back and he
[1:43:20] sent his own Spirit back to us called
[1:43:23] the Holy Spirit not three
[1:43:25] persons one
[1:43:28] God
[1:43:30] manifested God above us God With Us and
[1:43:33] now God in us same
[1:43:36] God now then so you know here again it
[1:43:40] was all paganized and and all you know
[1:43:43] all of this mixed with paganism and
[1:43:45] other idea until even the truth of water
[1:43:49] baptism was lost that's why the Baptist
[1:43:52] came out with their teaching of of of
[1:43:55] being a baptizer because they said
[1:43:57] you're not baptized as an infant into
[1:44:00] the church you have to be of the age of
[1:44:04] accountability and realize and that
[1:44:06] you're a sinner and make a personal
[1:44:08] confession of faith and be baptized so
[1:44:11] they baptized again so they were called
[1:44:13] re-baptized because even that was was
[1:44:17] lost even immersion was lost that's
[1:44:20] right truths of the Bible
[1:44:23] became obscured on and on and on we
[1:44:26] could go now to restore this we needed
[1:44:30] the title deed book to be cleared and in
[1:44:34] order to do this a title search must be
[1:44:39] done to discover the sin debt of
[1:44:42] unbelief and satisfy the sin debt
[1:44:45] removing every false Doctrine from the
[1:44:48] deed as to open of its truth so
[1:44:51] Revelation 10 is the descendant of
[1:44:53] Christ in spirit form bringing a clear
[1:44:56] deed to us after having been closed and
[1:44:59] sealed up for Seven Ages out of that
[1:45:03] descending of Christ there in Acts two
[1:45:06] came a prophet just as Paul was to
[1:45:08] restore back um you know mystery truths
[1:45:11] and so they're saying out of that
[1:45:13] descending comes a prophet to restore
[1:45:15] back mystery truth that have been sealed
[1:45:18] and to do this it would actually take
[1:45:21] not of theologi
[1:45:26] but a
[1:45:28] prophet Galatians 1:12 let's examine it
[1:45:31] let's find out how the original gospel
[1:45:33] was given it was not given by Gia and
[1:45:37] the schools of
[1:45:38] learning Paul said I counted all of that
[1:45:41] as dung that I might win
[1:45:44] Christ but what he says in verse 12 he
[1:45:47] said Galatians 1:12 said I neither
[1:45:51] received it of man neither was I taught
[1:45:55] it but by the
[1:45:58] revelation of Jesus
[1:46:01] Christ so it did not come from the
[1:46:04] Sadducees or the Pharisees can you
[1:46:07] imagine what kind of gospel we would had
[1:46:09] today if it had come from the halls of
[1:46:11] learning in that day it had to come from
[1:46:14] Jesus Christ himself he was the author
[1:46:17] of the book and he is his own
[1:46:19] interpreter so the
[1:46:21] book in Revelation 10 we see it pictured
[1:46:25] as unsealed handed to it and by eating
[1:46:28] it and taking of it it produces in us
[1:46:30] the same inward work of Acts chapter 2 m
[1:46:35] maturing us for the Harvest of the seed
[1:46:38] the book is now in our
[1:46:44] hands you know what that
[1:46:47] means that means it is Rapture time
[1:46:54] let me say it in the most simple words
[1:46:56] that I can say it as I close this
[1:46:59] morning
[1:47:01] God had a church the way he wanted
[1:47:07] it now he wants his
[1:47:11] church he had a CH he started a church
[1:47:14] the way he wanted it now he wants the
[1:47:16] church like he started it
[1:47:23] so do you know what that means that
[1:47:25] means there must be a book of Acts
[1:47:27] people on the
[1:47:29] Earth who not only talk about a gospel
[1:47:32] and it being head knowledge but it's an
[1:47:35] action of the Holy Spirit living in
[1:47:38] their lives producing an
[1:47:40] overcoming
[1:47:42] life giving you the power to
[1:47:47] overcome that's why the Holy Ghost came
[1:47:50] in Acts two and again it comes again and
[1:47:53] is final pouring out in the evening time
[1:47:56] a mature bride in the beginning a mature
[1:47:58] Bride In the End she goes in from she
[1:48:01] goes from wheat plant from seed to seed
[1:48:04] and both for Harvest Time and Alpha and
[1:48:07] Omega bride the same he had at the
[1:48:09] beginning the same he had at the end
[1:48:13] only God can move this
[1:48:17] mountain only the lamb could open the
[1:48:20] seals only Christ could revealed himself
[1:48:23] in this day so yes we must have the
[1:48:26] revelation of Christ personally to us
[1:48:30] and for you that's the new
[1:48:32] birth because when he's revealed
[1:48:34] personally to you not as a church member
[1:48:38] not as a collective group not belonging
[1:48:41] to mommy and daddy's church but when
[1:48:43] Christ is revealed personally to you
[1:48:47] that is the new
[1:48:49] birth I want you to Bow your heads with
[1:48:51] me please
[1:48:54] yes let the musicians
[1:48:58] come for an hour and a half we have
[1:49:00] labored here today just expounding on
[1:49:03] gospel
[1:49:05] truths and I want you this morning to
[1:49:08] just
[1:49:13] realize the
[1:49:15] gospel the resurrection of all the New
[1:49:18] Testament Saints is actually waiting on
[1:49:22] us this this
[1:49:27] morning maybe maybe you have not really
[1:49:30] surrendered your life to Christ maybe
[1:49:33] you have not really been Washed by the
[1:49:37] Water of the word and
[1:49:39] cleansed so that you would be a prepared
[1:49:42] vessel to be filled with the
[1:49:45] spirit maybe you have not received even
[1:49:48] a new heart or a new spirit or maybe
[1:49:50] that's as far as you come maybe you're
[1:49:53] struggling today to try to live
[1:49:57] right and you find yourself
[1:50:03] unable you say brother Tim is there hope
[1:50:05] for me I struggle with sin I struggle
[1:50:09] with
[1:50:10] pornography I struggle with with
[1:50:13] fornication adultery i i i every every
[1:50:18] lwd person I I I look in lust after
[1:50:24] I I have vices in my life of of alcohol
[1:50:28] and cigarettes and other things in there
[1:50:31] that makes my temple
[1:50:33] Unholy and God can't come and dwell with
[1:50:37] me but today I just say Lord I want to
[1:50:39] surrender my life to you to be a
[1:50:41] prepared vessel Washed by you I want you
[1:50:45] to wash me and make me clean from all my
[1:50:48] idols
[1:50:54] from all the other gods that I've
[1:50:57] served I've chased
[1:51:00] after sin
[1:51:03] unbelief I want my heart turned it's
[1:51:06] been pulled toward the
[1:51:09] world pulled toward
[1:51:12] sin and I want to invite you today to
[1:51:15] come
[1:51:16] Lord turn my
[1:51:18] heart turn my
[1:51:21] heart back to
[1:51:24] Faith would you allow him to do that in
[1:51:26] your life today wherever you
[1:51:29] are just let him do that work in
[1:51:40] you you see the old man the old carnal
[1:51:44] Nature has to die on The
[1:51:47] Altar with
[1:51:51] you and when you receive his
[1:51:54] sacrifice and you rise up a
[1:51:57] new a
[1:52:00] resurrection that's why we
[1:52:03] baptize we baptize unto his death his
[1:52:06] burial his
[1:52:08] resurrection that's why we immerse in
[1:52:11] water because you don't sprinkle dust on
[1:52:13] a dead man and say he's buried you
[1:52:15] immerse him these are all
[1:52:18] symbology but it's representing
[1:52:20] something that must happen
[1:52:23] otherwise if it doesn't happen in the
[1:52:25] inward work you go down a dry Center and
[1:52:27] come up a wet
[1:52:31] one but will you let the Lord change you
[1:52:40] today listen at the first
[1:52:44] Pentecost God took and wrote his law in
[1:52:49] stone as I said 3,000 died
[1:52:53] because it was the law of
[1:52:57] death because immediately man's heart
[1:52:59] was not turned just by receiving a law
[1:53:03] they began to worship other gods
[1:53:09] immediately but at in Acts chapter 2
[1:53:12] when it came the spirit descended it
[1:53:15] wasn't God writing a law in
[1:53:19] stone but he was writing it in the
[1:53:21] fleshly tables of
[1:53:24] hearts in other words giving you a new
[1:53:29] nature placing the law of the spirit
[1:53:32] within you where that you could live an
[1:53:34] overcoming
[1:53:35] life this is why it is so
[1:53:39] important Pentecost is the most
[1:53:41] important thing that can happen to a man
[1:53:44] to a woman we'll find this we study
[1:53:48] this Pentecost is greater than Calvary
[1:53:53] yet without Calvary it could it never
[1:53:55] be it's greater than the
[1:54:01] resurrection but yet without the
[1:54:03] resurrection Pentecost could never
[1:54:06] happen it was greater than his
[1:54:08] Ascension but without the Ascension the
[1:54:11] spirit could never
[1:54:14] come it would be there that the the
[1:54:17] Covenant Jesus Christ like the Old
[1:54:20] Testament
[1:54:22] where that they would write the Covenant
[1:54:25] on a slain animal skin and rip the skin
[1:54:28] and two and give half to one half to
[1:54:30] other there it there in with his
[1:54:34] Ascension he sent back the other part of
[1:54:36] the
[1:54:38] Covenant and what you receive must match
[1:54:41] him
[1:54:43] [Music]
[1:54:45] perfectly there at Pentecost he wrote it
[1:54:48] in the in the law in the heart there at
[1:54:51] Pentecost instead of dying there were
[1:54:54] 3,000 added to the
[1:54:57] church because why it's the Covenant of
[1:55:03] Life today you can have your own
[1:55:06] Pentecost your own Jubilee in your life
[1:55:10] and be set free from every
[1:55:13] sin maybe you just want to raise and
[1:55:15] lift a hand to God and say God that's me
[1:55:16] today I I really want to have that
[1:55:20] freedom that you promised where I'm no
[1:55:21] longer slave to sin but I'm really yours
