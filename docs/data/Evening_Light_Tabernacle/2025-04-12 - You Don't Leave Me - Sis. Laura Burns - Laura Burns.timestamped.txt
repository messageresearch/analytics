[0:00] [Music]
[0:10] I'm in the desert. No water, no shelter,
[0:15] no
[0:16] cover. Waiting for a rescue to come. But
[0:22] I never had to question or wonder about
[0:26] the heart of my father. After seeing all
[0:30] the great things you've
[0:33] done, I know you're going to finish what
[0:37] you
[0:39] begun. You don't lead
[0:41] me just to leave me. What if the
[0:46] promised land is just up
[0:50] ahead? I'm not
[0:53] forsen in these wastelands.
[0:58] So, Father, don't let me
[1:02] forget. You don't leave me.
[1:07] No, you don't leave
[1:13] me. I'm feeling fear and burdened and
[1:18] lonely and
[1:20] hurt. You leave me right here in my
[1:24] pain.
[1:25] And I feel you holding my head up. My
[1:30] portion is filled up, showing me that
[1:34] you're the God who
[1:36] stays. You don't need
[1:39] me just to leave me. What if the
[1:43] promised land is just up ahead?
[1:48] I'm not
[1:50] forsen in the
[1:53] wasteland. So, Father, don't let me
[1:58] forget. You don't leave me.
[2:04] Oh, you don't leave me.
[2:09] Oh, and you're faithful to your
[2:13] promises. Faithful like you've always
[2:16] been. I can trust that you will be again
[2:20] and again. I'm grateful that you're here
[2:24] with me. Grateful that you're going to
[2:27] be walking with me to the
[2:31] end. You don't leave me.
[2:37] No. You don't leave me. No.
[2:43] No, you don't need me just to leave me.
[2:49] What if the promised land is just up
[2:53] ahead? I'm not
[2:56] forsen. Oh, in these
[3:00] wastelands. So, Father, don't let me
[3:05] forget. You don't leave
[3:10] me. You don't leave me.
[3:16] No, you don't leave me.
[3:21] [Applause]
