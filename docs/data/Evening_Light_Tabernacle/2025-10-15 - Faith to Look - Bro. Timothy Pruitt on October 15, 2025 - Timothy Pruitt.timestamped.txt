[13:28] &gt;&gt; Those were tremendous.

[13:56] that's why we've come together this
[13:58] evening is to receive more from the
[14:00] father. Amen. We do have several
[14:03] requests that we want to remember. Um,
[14:06] Brother Josh Puit has a request for Alex
[14:09] and the girls. They're out sick with
[14:12] fevers and congestion. I can say the
[14:14] same for my family, Sister Debbie, and
[14:16] um, David is sick as well. Just asking
[14:19] that the Lord would bring strength back
[14:20] into their bodies. We want to remember
[14:24] um, the Dea Garza family from Lordsburg.
[14:30] I believe that's in New Mexico. Sister
[14:32] Naomi, his
[14:34] um his wife has battled cancer for about
[14:37] five years and has just o just just
[14:39] crossed over to be with the Lord. So we
[14:41] want to remember that family that the
[14:42] Lord would bring them comfort at this
[14:45] time and may his peace may the borders
[14:48] of his garment extend over them today.
[14:52] Let's just sing this. Ask brother Joe if
[14:55] you'd come and open the service for us
[14:57] this evening. Brother Joe,
[15:00] Lord, I lift your name, your holy name.
[15:03] We could say a lot,
[15:05] but if you would come,
[15:08] [Music]
[15:10] &gt;&gt; Lord, I lift
[15:13] your
[15:15] name.

[17:33] need, I believe we serve a living God
[17:35] that can meet that need. He's not just a
[17:37] God of special meetings.
[17:40] But just so you know, tonight's a
[17:42] special meeting.
[17:44] &gt;&gt; So, he can meet your need tonight. So,

[17:47] mercy and grace tonight. And Lord, we
[17:50] just want to say how thankful we are
[17:51] that our lives have been changed. Lord,
[17:54] our hearts have been turned away from
[17:56] the things of the world. And Lord,
[17:58] they've been turned and pointed to you,
[18:00] Lord, as your prophet would teach us.
[18:02] God, we've been lifted up into heavenly
[18:04] places. What a dimension. What an
[18:05] atmosphere that we as the bride of
[18:08] Christ can live in, Lord. Knowing that
[18:10] there's struggles on this side, but
[18:12] Lord, we're lifted above the struggles.
[18:13] We have an absolute, a top post. We have
[18:16] an anchor, Lord. We have the Holy Spirit
[18:18] in our lives, Lord. Not just on our
[18:20] physical being, but in our souls, Lord,
[18:22] the token life on display. And Father,
[18:25] I'm so thankful tonight to be a child of
[18:27] God. And I just pray for the needs of
[18:29] your people. Lord, you see Brother Aaron
[18:31] over here, Lord, suffering in his body
[18:33] with some issues that kept him from
[18:35] taking a meeting this weekend. But I
[18:37] pray you'll restore strength and health
[18:39] to him, Lord, for the family there that
[18:42] lost a wife and a mother and a friend.
[18:45] May you comfort them during this time,
[18:47] Father.
[18:48] Be a friend that sticks closer than a
[18:50] brother. And Lord, we pray for uh Sister
[18:53] Alex and the baby there, the Puit family
[18:55] that's suffering in sickness, and
[18:57] brother Derek's family, many other
[18:59] families, Lord, who are under the
[19:01] weather this evening. We just ask God
[19:03] you'll just come by their way, Lord.
[19:05] move by their their homes, their
[19:07] addresses tonight. And may the healing
[19:09] angel just stop by and touch them
[19:12] tonight, Father. And we invite you, God,
[19:14] to come and minister to every heart,
[19:16] every life, every need. Lord, use
[19:18] Brother Timothy as he has prepared and
[19:21] studied. Lord, made preparation for
[19:23] tonight. God, may you just speak to us
[19:25] through your word. For we know that thy
[19:27] word is yes and amen to the believer.
[19:30] And we, Lord, we lift our hands and say,
[19:32] "Father, we want more of that word. We
[19:35] want our hearts to be forever changed
[19:37] Lord to be illuminated by your goodness
[19:40] and your mercy. So we just commit the
[19:42] service to you tonight in Jesus name.

[35:09] So I got down on my knees, said, "Lord,
[35:13] help me.
[35:15] I got to see the victory."
[35:20] Oh, victory is mine.
[35:24] Victory is mine.
[35:27] Victory today. It is mine.
[35:32] My victory.
[35:38] victory today.
[35:43] For I am covered, covered. I'm covered
[35:47] by his blood. I'm walking by faith. I'm
[35:52] living
[35:54] by the cover.
[35:59] Oh yeah.
[36:01] Jesus.
[36:03] Oh, I'm covered.
[36:06] I love
[36:09] I'm covered by his love. I'm walking by.
[36:15] I'm living
[36:17] by his cover.
[36:19] [Music]
[36:21] Covered by his blood.
[36:24] Jesus has
[36:26] me.
[36:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. God bless you tonight.
[36:34] Let's turn to Luke chapter 21.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; Like to say it's good to be in the house
[36:39] of the Lord.
[36:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just come out of these wonderful
[36:43] meetings and believe God done some great
[36:46] things for us.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're thankful for that. Just
[36:50] looking forward to every testimony and
[36:53] every victory.
[36:54] Amen.
[36:57] So Luke chapter 21 and verse 25 and also
[37:00] Hebrews chapter 9 and verse 28.
[37:04] said, "There shall be signs in the sun
[37:06] and the moon and the stars on the earth,
[37:08] distress of nations, for perplexity,
[37:12] the sea and the waves roaring, men's
[37:15] hearts failing them for fear, and for
[37:18] looking after those things which are
[37:20] coming on the earth. For the powers of
[37:23] heaven shall be shaken." And then shall
[37:26] they see the Son of Man coming in a
[37:28] cloud with power and great glory. And
[37:31] when these things to come to pass, then
[37:34] look up and lift up your heads for your
[37:38] redemption drawth nigh. Also, Hebrews
[37:41] chapter 9 verse 28
[37:47] says, "So Christ was once offered to
[37:50] bear the sins of many, and unto them
[37:53] that look for him shall he appear the
[37:56] second time without sin unto salvation."
[38:00] Amen. God bless you. You can be seated
[38:03] this evening.
[38:06] Amen. Just like to take a thought as we
[38:09] follow up these meetings on faith to
[38:13] look or maybe you ask the question, what
[38:16] are you looking at?
[38:20] &gt;&gt; Because you know, as we know in the day
[38:21] and time that we're living in, there's
[38:23] plenty of things to look at. There's
[38:25] plenty of news to watch. There's uh
[38:28] plenty of conspiracy theories as it as
[38:31] it were to get your head into and all
[38:33] kind of things that you can look at. But
[38:36] and we see here that there's going to be
[38:38] there there's things that's happening
[38:39] upon the earth and we can truly say
[38:41] there's distress between nations and
[38:44] there's perplexities. There's the sea
[38:46] and the waves roll it roaring and and it
[38:49] says men's hearts are failing them for
[38:52] fear for their for looking after those
[38:55] things
[38:56] &gt;&gt; there. That's where their attention is
[38:57] upon all the signs and all the things
[39:00] that are taking place. But when these
[39:02] things begin to come to pass, then look
[39:04] up or and lift up your heads for your
[39:07] redemption drawth nigh. Now this look is
[39:10] to wait is I was looking at it in the
[39:12] Bible as a word there that they used for
[39:15] this word look. It means to wait looking
[39:18] forward to the fulfillment of something
[39:21] that you expect to take place. It is to
[39:24] terry and wait with patience and
[39:27] steadfastness
[39:29] to look away from all else and at one
[39:32] object.
[39:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. All else and at one object. And I
[39:36] I trust that you know that one object to
[39:38] look to is Jesus Christ.
[39:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not the word world that we're
[39:43] living in. It's not our government and
[39:45] things around us and all the situation
[39:47] that's going on maybe even in locally in
[39:49] your own life and things. Amen. But to
[39:52] look amen at Jesus. Amen. The author and
[39:54] the finisher of our faith. Just a couple
[39:56] of scriptures as we look into this.
[39:58] Amen. Micah chapter 7 and verse 7 there.
[40:01] It says, "Therefore I will look unto the
[40:04] Lord. I will wait for the God of my
[40:06] salvation. My God will hear me.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a promise that is. My God
[40:12] will hear me. Amen. In 2 Corinthians
[40:14] 4:18 says, "While we look not at the
[40:18] things which are seen, but at the things
[40:20] which are not seen. For the things which
[40:23] are seen are temporal, but the things
[40:25] which are not seen are eternal." Amen.
[40:28] So that tells me the things that I can
[40:30] see with my eyes here tonight are
[40:32] temporary. This building is temporary. I
[40:35] see this walls. I I see the pull pit. I
[40:38] I see the pews. I see everything around.
[40:40] Amen. And I It's all temporary. But
[40:43] there's something that if we can break
[40:45] into a vision or into the internals, we
[40:48] can see things not with these two eyes,
[40:50] but eyes of faith. And and we can look
[40:52] beyond the walls that are around us and
[40:54] the situations that surround us and and
[40:57] the circumstances that we're have facing
[40:59] us. and and maybe even after these
[41:01] meetings, things you've dealt with and
[41:03] and and and you're looking at things
[41:05] maybe not moving how you thought they
[41:07] would move or or changing exactly how
[41:09] they that you thought. But if you can
[41:10] look beyond what you can see with your
[41:12] eyes and and you can look with eyes of
[41:15] faith. And tonight, if we can look with
[41:16] eyes of faith, we would no doubt see
[41:18] angels. We would we would see God moving
[41:20] on the behalf of his children. We could
[41:22] see angels that are being dispatched.
[41:24] Amen. To to answer the cries of
[41:27] individuals. Amen. Amen. If we could
[41:29] look at that tonight that our hearts
[41:31] won't fail us. Amen. But there would be
[41:33] faith that that would rise up in our
[41:35] hearts. In Proverbs 4 and verse 25, it
[41:38] says, "Let thine eyes look right on." In
[41:41] other words, don't look to the left. We
[41:43] get to it, but don't look to the left or
[41:44] the right. Look right on, and let thy
[41:47] eyelids look straight before thee.
[41:50] Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all
[41:53] thy ways be established. Turn not to the
[41:55] right hand nor to the left and remove
[41:58] thy foot from evil. So our eyes are to
[42:00] be steadfast. It's to look at something.
[42:03] It's to Amen. is given to us. Amen. As a
[42:06] guide. Now I I I think if there were
[42:08] there truly was any senses in my life
[42:10] that I would want to the least to lose,
[42:13] it would be my eyesight. I probably I
[42:15] think I could do without feeling maybe
[42:17] or or taste or I've done for years
[42:19] without smell and and and or maybe even
[42:22] without hearing. But to not have your
[42:24] eyesight, to me, that would be one of
[42:26] the worst things to lose. And I I think
[42:28] even greater than that is people who
[42:30] have lost their spiritual eyesight.
[42:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. That they can't really see what is
[42:35] going on in the other realms. That they
[42:37] can't really see that the things that
[42:38] they're seeing with their eyes are only
[42:40] the fulfillment of eternal things are
[42:42] only the fulfillment of prophecies that
[42:45] are taking place all around us. Amen. So
[42:48] when we look at these things, we don't
[42:49] look with eyes of flesh. if we look with
[42:52] eyes of faith. So when you look at your
[42:54] problems, don't look with eyes of flesh.
[42:56] Look with eyes of faith. Amen. That we
[42:59] can see beyond what we can see. And and
[43:01] we can look beyond what we see before
[43:03] us. And we can see a God who is
[43:06] answering our need in spite of what we
[43:08] can see before us. We can see a God
[43:11] who's ministering, a God who's moving, a
[43:14] God who's making a way where there seems
[43:16] to be no way, no matter what our eyes
[43:18] may tell us. Amen. If the children of
[43:21] Israel could have had that kind of
[43:22] eyesight, they wouldn't have murmured.
[43:24] They wouldn't have complained. They
[43:25] wouldn't have made fusses with Moses. If
[43:27] they could have had that spiritual
[43:29] eyesight to see that God had made a
[43:31] promise and he said, "I'm going to take
[43:33] you out of Egypt and I'm going to take
[43:34] you into a land flowing with milk and
[43:36] honey." Amen. If they would have kept
[43:38] their eyes upon that word, they would
[43:40] have not seen or worried about the Red
[43:42] Sea. They wouldn't have worried about
[43:43] the desert. They wouldn't have worried
[43:45] about no food or no water. They would
[43:47] have known their God made a promise and
[43:49] their God was going to take care of that
[43:51] promise. Well, that goes the same for us
[43:53] tonight. If we quit looking at all the
[43:56] things that are around us and all the
[43:58] bad stuff that's stacked up and all the
[44:00] situations and we can say, "God is still
[44:03] God and God is still on the throne. He's
[44:06] still in charge of my situation and he's
[44:08] still taking care of me whether I see
[44:11] him or I don't see him."
[44:14] And I can look to his word and his word
[44:16] is what is true. Amen. In this hour that
[44:19] we're living in and Paul would pick up
[44:22] on this thought a as it were that
[44:24] Solomon would talk about. Let your eyes
[44:27] look right on. He would pick it up and
[44:29] he said, "I count myself not to
[44:31] apprehend in Philippians 3 and verse 13.
[44:34] But this one thing I do, forgetting
[44:36] those things which are behind, I reach
[44:39] forth under those things which are
[44:41] before." Amen. I'm not looking back.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz there is a wrong way. There is
[44:48] a wrong a thing that you things you
[44:50] shouldn't look at. We've heard about it
[44:52] in Lot. Amen. On Sunday about Lot's
[44:54] wife. She looked at something, but she
[44:56] looked at the wrong thing. Amen. She
[44:58] looked at the city and looked at the
[45:00] things she was leaving behind and looked
[45:02] at all the things that was behind her
[45:04] instead of looking at the grace of God
[45:07] that had pulled her out of the fire.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. That's the way you
[45:12] ought to be. Look, you ought to look not
[45:14] look at your past, not look at your past
[45:16] mistakes, not look at your past
[45:18] failures, but look at your God who has
[45:21] grace that pulled you out of fire,
[45:23] pulled you out of sin, pulled you out of
[45:25] unbelief, and put your feet upon
[45:28] something you can stand upon.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; And he said, I press toward the mark of
[45:34] the prize of the high calling of God in
[45:37] Christ Jesus. Cuz he's got his eyes
[45:39] before, not behind. Amen. We don't we're
[45:42] not living life looking in a rearview
[45:44] mirror,
[45:46] &gt;&gt; right?
[45:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not in this age looking back
[45:49] to the last age. We're looking at the
[45:51] God before us. Amen. That God's leading
[45:54] the way. He says, Brother Brandham uses
[45:56] this. He said, when you hear the word
[45:57] look, it's usually somebody trying to
[46:00] get you to see what they're looking at.
[46:02] And they'll say to you, look, look, look
[46:04] at them. Look at them microphones. Look,
[46:05] look. See, look. It's just drawing your
[46:08] attention somewhere. Like going down a
[46:10] road, somebody might see a certain scene
[46:12] and say, "Look," that expresses
[46:14] something. It's a mountain or maybe it's
[46:16] a cactus or whatever it is. The first
[46:18] thing they say is, "Look, what is it?"
[46:20] Trying to get your attention. Everybody
[46:22] is looking today. Everybody's looking
[46:24] for something. We're looking for
[46:26] something to happen. We We know the
[46:28] world is constantly watching the skies
[46:30] and the radars and and the screens and
[46:32] everything. Every nation for its own
[46:34] defense, you know, has radars and things
[46:36] that they're looking at. They're looking
[46:38] to find something to appear like an
[46:40] atomic missile or something. Then they
[46:42] got something there that go back to the
[46:44] one that's sent this away. See, they're
[46:46] looking for something. Everything is
[46:48] looking. And he talks about how the Ford
[46:50] company is looking to make a better
[46:52] Ford. God bless them. Amen. The
[46:54] Chevrolet is looking to make a better
[46:55] Chevrolet. Phoenix, he says the town
[46:58] there is looking to make a larger and
[46:59] better town. The nation is looking for
[47:02] more territory so it can spread itself
[47:04] out. The church is looking for more
[47:06] members, but the bride,
[47:10] &gt;&gt; but the bride is looking for the coming
[47:13] of her Lord.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. So, you have to take
[47:18] your eyes off of something to get your
[47:21] eyes on something else.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can't look at this speaker
[47:25] here and this pew over here at the same
[47:27] time unless it happens to be lined up.
[47:29] But if you're looking this way, you got
[47:31] to look one way or the other. Amen. This
[47:33] is God doesn't give us that opportunity
[47:35] that we can look at both things at the
[47:36] same time. We have to take our eyes off
[47:39] of something to get it on something
[47:41] else. Amen. So, we have to take our eyes
[47:44] off of what's temporary to get it on
[47:46] what's eternal.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; You cannot look at both things. The
[47:50] Bible says, Amen. Jesus said, "No man
[47:52] can serve two masters." You can't look
[47:55] at two things like that. Amen. With the
[47:57] same eyes and the same hope and the same
[47:59] longing. Listen, I'm not looking for
[48:01] this world to get better. I'm not
[48:03] looking for this world to be a better
[48:05] place to live. What I'm looking for is
[48:08] God to come back and to g get a bride
[48:11] and take us out of this world.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; So, we have to get our eyes off of fear
[48:18] and doubt so you can get your eyes on
[48:20] faith and fulfillment.
[48:24] You got to get your eyes off what the
[48:26] world is doing so you can get your eyes
[48:28] on what God is doing.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; Cuz God is always working.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter if you can see him
[48:36] working or not or if you realize he's
[48:38] working or not or if you understand he's
[48:40] working or not. The children of Israel
[48:42] thought for 400 years God is not
[48:44] working. But the whole time God was
[48:46] preparing.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; What was he doing? He was working behind
[48:51] the scenes. He was bringing this one to
[48:53] this one, this one to this one to this
[48:54] one to this one to one day he got a
[48:56] Amrab and a joed and it had and he
[48:59] brought them together and he got a
[49:00] Moses.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; God was already still working. He wasn't
[49:04] just sitting back twiddling his thumbs
[49:06] for 400 years. No, he was making
[49:08] preparation to bring his children out of
[49:11] Egypt.
[49:13] &gt;&gt; And listen, God has not got seven seven
[49:15] church ages down the road and he's just
[49:17] giving up and he's just sitting back
[49:19] drinking a glass of iced tea. No, he's
[49:21] been preparing things and he's been
[49:23] putting things in place. He's been put
[49:25] putting kingdoms in authority. He's been
[49:27] putting go people in authority and
[49:29] kingdoms, kings and and presidents and
[49:32] everything. Why? To bring a certain
[49:34] atmosphere for a certain time that a
[49:37] bride can leave here.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; So, we got to make sure we don't get our
[49:42] eyes on the wrong thing
[49:44] &gt;&gt; because it's very easy to do. You can
[49:46] start looking at all the doubt around
[49:48] you and all the fear around you, all the
[49:50] problems around you and all the
[49:52] situation and it looks like man
[49:56] it's what happened to Gahhesa, right?
[49:58] Got to looking at all the Syrians and
[50:00] woke up that morning got come out on
[50:02] that balcony with his cup of coffee and
[50:04] he's like, "Man, this this brick
[50:06] street's good.
[50:09] Oh, this is wonderful.
[50:11] What is that?"
[50:15] Elisha,
[50:17] we got problems.
[50:20] Elisha comes out with his cup of coffee
[50:23] and says, "What's the problem?"
[50:25] He sees the same Syrians that his
[50:27] servant sees.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; But they're no problem to him because he
[50:31] knows God's at work.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; And his eyes are not on what the Syrians
[50:35] are doing, but what on God, what God's
[50:37] doing.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Lord, well, hey, don't you
[50:40] see all these Syrians? Don't you see all
[50:42] these problems? Don't you see all these
[50:44] situation? Hey, we just had a wonderful
[50:46] camp meeting. We just had a wonderful
[50:48] time. And I come out here to drink my
[50:50] coffee and it surrounded me.
[50:54] Look, look, it's worse than it ever was.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; It looks more impossible than it ever
[51:01] looked.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; How is this going to happen? Elisha
[51:04] looked at that and said, "Boy, what you
[51:06] need is some eye surgery.
[51:09] What you need to get your eyes off of
[51:11] them Syrians and get your eyes on your
[51:13] God.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. Maybe he's talking to
[51:18] somebody tonight. Maybe you come out of
[51:20] them meetings that's been worse than
[51:21] it's ever been. More anxiety, more fear,
[51:24] more this, more whatever. But you need
[51:26] to get your eyes off of what you're
[51:28] going through and get your eyes on God
[51:31] who's going to take you through it.
[51:37] He said, "God, open this boy's eyes."
[51:40] And his eyes popped open. You know, all
[51:42] of a sudden, the Syrians wasn't as big
[51:44] anymore. All of a sudden, he seen hills
[51:46] full of angels and chariots of fire.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; Those angels and chariots are still
[51:52] here, church.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; They've been stationed by you on Monday
[51:56] morning. They was there with you on
[51:57] Tuesday morning. They was here there
[51:59] this morning.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; Come on. They encamp about those that
[52:04] fear him. That's right.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; They ain't left their duties. They ain't
[52:08] left their post. Amen. They're still
[52:10] there. But you got to separate yourself
[52:12] from the doubts.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; You got to separate yourself from the
[52:15] things that wants to pull you away from
[52:17] your eyes being on Jesus Christ and walk
[52:21] with him. It's life to you.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; You know, Abraham did such a thing. 25
[52:28] years he held on to a promise believing
[52:30] the same promise. He but he had to focus
[52:33] his mind to the will of God by the word
[52:36] of God and believe it. And if we can
[52:39] focus oursel to the plan of God, to what
[52:42] God wants for us and what God promised
[52:45] us, and we let everything else along, no
[52:47] matter how long it is, we just keep
[52:49] believing.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; We just keep believing. That's what
[52:53] believers do. We believe. Amen. Romans
[52:55] 4:14 said he staggered not at the
[52:58] promises of God through unbelief, but
[53:00] was strong in the faith.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; He didn't let unbelief contaminate him.
[53:06] He looked at one thing that was the
[53:08] voice that had spoke to him.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; That's what the church ought to do
[53:13] today. That's what we ought to do today.
[53:15] Look at one thing, the voice. The word
[53:17] of God.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; What does the word say? It speaks. Amen.
[53:20] churches and people can speak any way
[53:22] they want to speak. But what does the
[53:24] voice the word say? Amen. The what are
[53:27] we looking at? He looked at the voice
[53:29] that spoke to him. He called everything
[53:31] contrary to what the voice had spoke.
[53:33] Amen. Yet materially it was so far out
[53:37] of focus of the world as it was in
[53:39] Noah's time. He it didn't focus up with
[53:42] the thoughts of the world.
[53:46] You know,
[53:48] that's why they think we're crazy people
[53:52] because our eyesight don't match up with
[53:54] their eyesight.
[53:57] We see things not quite the same,
[54:01] right?
[54:02] Amen. We see things out there in the
[54:04] world and we say, "Well, that's we see
[54:06] sin. We see unbelief. We see all they
[54:08] see it as just a normal day,
[54:11] &gt;&gt; right?"
[54:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then you get up, go to work, you
[54:14] see sin, you see God, all the things
[54:16] that God spoke about, Sodom and
[54:17] Gomorrah, all that stuff being poured
[54:19] out. You see it all being fulfilled.
[54:21] Amen. And they wake up. It's just
[54:23] another normal day because their
[54:24] eyesight is not the same. Because we
[54:27] have come under a different prophetic
[54:29] eyesight.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen. What did he say about the
[54:33] church of Leodysia? They're wretched.
[54:34] Blind.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; Blind. Amen. So blind they don't know
[54:39] what a man or a woman is anymore. so
[54:42] blind they don't know about how to how
[54:43] to operate in marriages and and giving
[54:46] in marriage and divorce and all that.
[54:47] Why? Because of the blindness of
[54:49] Leodysia,
[54:51] &gt;&gt; but there's an Isaf.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; Thank God I received the Isaf that I can
[54:56] see. Amen. What is going on around us,
[54:59] what is happening in this age, what is
[55:01] taking place, what spot we are on the
[55:03] map.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; Why? Because God has anointed somebody
[55:08] to see.
[55:14] But it's so far out of focus with the
[55:16] world. Noah's time was so out of focus
[55:18] with the world. Noah knew that if God
[55:20] said so, he's going to he was able to
[55:22] put rain up there, whether there's rain
[55:23] or not. Abraham knew that if God said
[55:26] he's going to have a baby, he can make
[55:27] his body come to life, but he considered
[55:29] not his own body. He considered not the
[55:31] deadness of Sarah's womb. Amen. And here
[55:34] he was. He did, you know, he didn't even
[55:36] think about it. It didn't even come to
[55:37] his mind. He had focused all the
[55:40] unbelief out.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:45] Get all the unbelief out. That's what
[55:48] the church should do. That's what each
[55:49] member of the church should do.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not just a blanket statement here.
[55:54] That's what the each member of the
[55:56] church should do. But focus out of you
[55:59] all doubt and look only to the word. It
[56:03] promised it. God said so. It's got to be
[56:06] that way. The Bible said against hope he
[56:08] believed in hope. He staggered not at
[56:10] the promises of God but was strong
[56:12] giving praise to God. Each day he got
[56:15] stronger because the miracle was going
[56:17] to be just greater.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; And notice about Abraham, he never
[56:23] stopped praising God.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; I love what brother Matt said about
[56:28] praise. Amen. I I've used that already
[56:31] this week. I put my hands on the back of
[56:32] that devil and made him bow. Amen.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. Amen. That's exactly
[56:38] what Abraham would do when thoughts try
[56:40] to come into his mind. He would just
[56:42] refocus himself and get all doubt out,
[56:45] raise his hands, and start praising God
[56:47] anyhow. Amen. I don't know how God's
[56:49] going to do it. I just know he promised
[56:51] me he would. And that's the way you you
[56:53] parents ought to be about your children.
[56:55] I don't know how he's going to do it. I
[56:57] just know he gave me the promise.
[57:01] And they may be as dead as midnight, but
[57:03] there's a voice that's going to speak
[57:05] and the bones are going to come to life.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; So, I'm just going to praise him while
[57:12] he works.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to glorify him whether I
[57:16] see a result or I don't see a result. It
[57:19] has nothing to do with what I see. It
[57:21] has to do with what I believe.
[57:30] Sometimes we can't even believe from one
[57:33] night to another.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we can't believe from one
[57:37] revival to another.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; We have to go out and we get entangled
[57:43] again with all that unbelief.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; He said we ought to be ashamed of
[57:46] ourselves.
[57:49] said, "Before we came here to confess
[57:50] and get that blood of Jesus that
[57:52] cleanses us from all sin, we should
[57:54] focus oursel down to where we can see
[57:56] one true living God standing here who
[57:59] made the promise that heavens and earth
[58:01] will pass away, but his word cannot
[58:04] fail."
[58:05] &gt;&gt; Stay right there on that. Then you'll
[58:07] not be tossed around with every wind
[58:09] that comes through and carried about
[58:10] from place to place, from pillar to
[58:12] post. Focus.
[58:15] Focus. He said that's the thing that
[58:17] broke up fellowship in Eden is because
[58:19] Eve failed to keep focused of her of of
[58:23] her looking on God's word and begin to
[58:25] listen to the reasonings of the enemy.
[58:28] Amen. If she just stayed focused with
[58:30] what God said and if God said it, it
[58:33] settles that God said so. But she didn't
[58:35] want to do that. She changed her focus
[58:37] of her glasses and begin to see instead
[58:40] of being just one way, there became two
[58:42] ways.
[58:46] Hello.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; How many's ever got your eyeballs out of
[58:49] focus,
[58:51] &gt;&gt; man? You wake up, you get knocked in the
[58:53] head or something, get out of focus, and
[58:54] all of a sudden there ain't one speaker
[58:56] there. There's two speakers there.
[58:57] There's two brother Joe's there. What's
[59:00] going on? Your eyes are out of focus.
[59:03] Brother Brown talked about Bill. He gave
[59:05] him a camera one time and told him,
[59:07] "Look up on that mountain, take a
[59:08] picture of this object." And it was a
[59:10] sarro cactus. And he said, 'I didn't I I
[59:13] seen not just one stalk. I seen two,
[59:15] three stalks. And and that I knew there
[59:18] was only one. I put it back down and put
[59:20] it back up and there was three. He said,
[59:22] ' But what was it? It was just out of
[59:24] focus.
[59:25] Just had to be focused in. He said,
[59:27] "That's the way it is sometimes. We get
[59:29] out of focus
[59:32] on what's really important.
[59:34] We get out of focus. We try to put
[59:36] something of God way back somewhere else
[59:38] or something another." Maybe, you know,
[59:40] we just need to focus in. Let the Holy
[59:42] Spirit get our ideas away from ourselves
[59:45] and get our church theology out of us
[59:48] and let him come in and connect us.
[59:50] We'll not see three or four. You'll see
[59:52] one object.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; You'll see one God.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; Looking through the same camera, a man
[1:00:00] can see something, but you know, his own
[1:00:01] intelligence tells him there's one stalk
[1:00:03] there. What what's going on? He said
[1:00:04] that's the way the Holy Spirit does. If
[1:00:06] we just let it have its way, it'll take
[1:00:09] the word itself and bring it into focus
[1:00:12] to where we can see what we're looking
[1:00:14] at then. And then you'll find out if
[1:00:16] people are trying to show you something
[1:00:18] that's wrong. You'll let that Holy
[1:00:20] Spirit begin to move and the word itself
[1:00:23] begins to show the word in manifestation
[1:00:25] and it brings it all into focus and
[1:00:28] it'll hit the mark.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; If it hit the mark one time, it'll hit
[1:00:33] the mark again.
[1:00:40] He talks about a little rifle. It was a
[1:00:42] little I think maybe a 22 rifle or
[1:00:44] something he had bought and he was
[1:00:46] driving tax with it, but something
[1:00:48] happened to it and he couldn't get it to
[1:00:50] drive tax. And and he said, "I I like to
[1:00:53] shoot squirrels." He said, "But I like
[1:00:54] to shoot them in the eyeball." He was
[1:00:55] quite the marksman. And he said, "You
[1:00:57] know, some brothers don't mind. They can
[1:00:58] shoot them in the body. They can shoot
[1:01:00] them in the head. They can shoot them in
[1:01:01] the tail. It doesn't want it doesn't
[1:01:03] matter to them. They can hit them. All
[1:01:05] right. Mid, back, center, back,
[1:01:07] anywhere, but I just can't do that. I I
[1:01:10] wanted to to be and he said, "I get so
[1:01:11] nervous and tore up about it sometimes."
[1:01:14] And he said, "I was wondering why it
[1:01:15] was." And he said, "As I was thinking
[1:01:17] about this rifle," and he said, he tried
[1:01:19] to send it back. And they wrote him a
[1:01:20] letter and said, "Look, it's it's it's
[1:01:22] in in the requirements that that we, you
[1:01:25] know, I forget the word the word there,
[1:01:27] but it's in the requirements, and so
[1:01:29] there's nothing we can do about He said,
[1:01:30] "But I know it drove tax one time, so I
[1:01:33] know it'll do it again." He said, "But
[1:01:36] something has got out of whack
[1:01:37] somewhere." And he said, "I wonder why
[1:01:39] have I h am I so worried about this?"
[1:01:41] And he said, "A voice spoke to him and
[1:01:43] said, you were made thus for a purpose.
[1:01:46] You were made like this for a purpose to
[1:01:48] be focused in." Amen. To be zeroed in.
[1:01:51] I'm thankful to have a prophet like
[1:01:52] that. He didn't just spray out here and
[1:01:55] hope he got a 50% right or 60% right or
[1:01:58] or 10% right. It was 100% right.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it was zeroed in by the
[1:02:04] Holy Ghost.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; He said, "I I I I'm just that way. If
[1:02:13] it's zeroed in once, it'll zero it
[1:02:16] again. Is the same rifle." And he said,
[1:02:17] "If obeying this word and taking the
[1:02:20] taking the rangefinder and bringing it
[1:02:22] to a place to see the same things that
[1:02:25] those apostles saw, now see what he's
[1:02:28] talking about. angel. He went from the
[1:02:29] rifle back to the word. And he said, "If
[1:02:31] I can just bring it to the same place
[1:02:33] that I can see the same things that the
[1:02:35] apostles saw, the same gospels that they
[1:02:38] preached.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; It's not another gospel, the same
[1:02:42] gospel.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; It'll produce the same results."
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; Because if it did it for them, it'll
[1:02:50] strike the target again.
[1:02:54] That's why we can't be satisfied with
[1:02:56] just hidden off over here and hidden off
[1:02:58] over there. We got to be zeroed in.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; Zeroed into the target that God's got
[1:03:05] something he's doing in this hour. And
[1:03:07] listen, if I'm off just a little bit
[1:03:08] here by the time I get way down there,
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; actually, I was just seeing today was 11
[1:03:15] years 11 years ago today. I was under
[1:03:18] this slab. Well, before slab was here
[1:03:20] digging in the dirt. me and brother
[1:03:21] Jeremy Shriner was putting in the
[1:03:22] plumbing 11 years to day. But brother
[1:03:25] Wayne would come here and he'd help us
[1:03:26] with the dirt work and he he worked as a
[1:03:28] surveyor for a long time and he we was
[1:03:31] out here making marks and things and he
[1:03:33] said you know it's amazing. He said with
[1:03:36] surveying I learned something. He said
[1:03:37] if you you can start off and if you
[1:03:39] don't get it exactly right you can be
[1:03:40] just off a millimeter right here. He
[1:03:43] said but by the time you get miles down
[1:03:45] the road you're off feet and hundreds of
[1:03:48] feet sometimes.
[1:03:50] This is where we see people. They they
[1:03:51] don't look that bad off, but they're
[1:03:53] off.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; And if you watch their life long enough,
[1:03:57] they'll be off in a ditch somewhere.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; That's why we got to stay focused. We
[1:04:01] got to stay right with the word and
[1:04:03] right where the Holy Spirit wants to
[1:04:04] move, we want to let him move. How he
[1:04:07] wants to orchestrate, we want to let him
[1:04:08] orchestrate. No matter what the church
[1:04:10] says the people claims to be, he said,
[1:04:12] "I know it'll do it." There that is.
[1:04:14] There is there's what I want to look at
[1:04:16] the word and see that it's exactly in
[1:04:18] focus. see the same vision they saw
[1:04:21] because it'll if it did a job for them,
[1:04:23] it'll do the same job for me.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; If it healed the sick, if it raised the
[1:04:28] dead, if it cast out devils, it'll be
[1:04:31] the same for us tonight if we'll stay
[1:04:33] with that same focus.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; It'll bring forth a glorious church.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; But it's depending on what you're
[1:04:43] looking at and what you're shooting
[1:04:45] after and what mark you're on.
[1:04:51] There's a lot of people that are not
[1:04:53] even following the message and even
[1:04:56] today are even atheist don't even
[1:04:58] believe in Jesus.
[1:05:01] But it didn't start out like that.
[1:05:04] Started with one little tiny shift.
[1:05:10] Now they've got their arms wrapped
[1:05:12] around their lesbian daughters and they
[1:05:13] so proud of themselves smoking a
[1:05:15] cigarette, drinking a beer. Come on.
[1:05:18] You'd have asked them 20 years ago or
[1:05:20] told them 20 years that's the way it was
[1:05:21] going to end up. They would have denied
[1:05:22] it. Said, "You're crazy." But they got
[1:05:26] off just a little bit.
[1:05:30] He said, "If he ever was God, he's still
[1:05:32] God. He always was God. He can't be
[1:05:35] nothing else but God because God is
[1:05:37] eternal." Therefore, we want to look to
[1:05:39] that target. Not what target the church
[1:05:41] is sitting at church is shooting at or
[1:05:43] what target, but what target Christ is
[1:05:45] shooting at. We look for Christ to
[1:05:47] appear. The same Jesus. He said when he
[1:05:50] was on earth a little while the world
[1:05:51] seeth me no more. Yet ye shall see me
[1:05:54] for I'll be with you to the end of the
[1:05:56] world. The same one who would direct the
[1:05:58] word be the word and direct it straight
[1:06:00] onto the target is the same Lord Jesus
[1:06:02] here this morning in the form of the
[1:06:04] Holy Spirit to direct our thoughts and
[1:06:07] focus his word to one true and living
[1:06:09] God and one purpose and one achievement.
[1:06:12] If we'll just let him do it, he'll focus
[1:06:14] the word right to a place that it'll
[1:06:17] prove he's the same yesterday, today,
[1:06:19] and forever.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; We must focus our lives.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; People get so focused in what they're
[1:06:29] going to do for a living or so focused
[1:06:31] in their their worldly possessions and
[1:06:34] so focused on all it's the wrong focus.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; Sure, I know we got to plant our
[1:06:40] potatoes and all that. understand all
[1:06:42] that, but don't let that become your
[1:06:43] focus.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; We must, you know, one of my one of my
[1:06:51] go-to quotes is, no matter what you do
[1:06:54] or how successful you become without
[1:06:56] Christ, you've totally lost everything.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; If you get down there and you miss him,
[1:07:03] you've missed everything.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; So, that's why we got to stay focused.
[1:07:08] We must focus our lives
[1:07:10] not what somebody else says or how
[1:07:13] somebody else says we ought to do it but
[1:07:15] focus our lives to him. He is the word
[1:07:18] and we get our lives lined up with the
[1:07:20] word then the word and our life becomes
[1:07:22] the same. He said if you abide in me and
[1:07:25] my word abide in you then ask what you
[1:07:27] will and it'll be granted. Verily I say
[1:07:28] unto you say this mountain be moved and
[1:07:30] don't doubt in your heart but believe
[1:07:31] that what you've said will come to pass.
[1:07:33] You can have what you said, not what I
[1:07:36] said, what you said.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; You can have because you and he become
[1:07:42] the same because the mind that was in
[1:07:44] Christ is now in you. And the mind that
[1:07:46] was in Christ was to fulfill the
[1:07:48] father's word.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Not to buy, you know, more houses and
[1:07:56] more lands and get better. That that
[1:07:58] ain't that ain't our focus. I'm
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; not saying God can't bless you. I'm not
[1:08:02] saying God can't do some things. He does
[1:08:04] it. That's not our focus. Our focus is
[1:08:08] leaving here.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Our focus is not even the next
[1:08:14] five minutes. Our focus is leaving here.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; I've seen people at a gate,
[1:08:25] excuse me, people at a gate waiting on
[1:08:28] an airplane. They ain't focused on
[1:08:30] nothing. They got something in their
[1:08:31] ears and
[1:08:32] about getting left,
[1:08:35] not listening for the call.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Group so and so bored. Group so and so
[1:08:42] bored.
[1:08:44] There's those that are listening and
[1:08:46] when it group one bored, man, there they
[1:08:48] go.
[1:08:51] But there's others that just sit over
[1:08:52] there laxadasical and looking around
[1:08:55] reading something or listening on there
[1:08:57] something on the iPods or IP ear pods.
[1:09:01] whatever they got going on and they like
[1:09:03] they ain't got a care in the world.
[1:09:05] Listen, if they sat there long enough,
[1:09:06] they'd miss it.
[1:09:09] All of a sudden, they start scurrying,
[1:09:11] throwing their stuff in the in the bag
[1:09:13] and running down the aisle. What What is
[1:09:14] it? They lost their focus. What was
[1:09:16] really important?
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is where people are getting
[1:09:20] because they got all kind of things in
[1:09:22] their ears and all kinds of things going
[1:09:23] on in their mind and all kind of thing.
[1:09:25] And meanwhile, God just moving along,
[1:09:27] fulfilling prophecy after prophecy after
[1:09:29] prophecy after prophecy. And if you got
[1:09:31] your eyes on the right thing, you'd see
[1:09:33] it being fulfilled.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; He said, "You know where you stand when
[1:09:44] you've been zeroed in with God.
[1:09:47] You see your own life hitting the target
[1:09:49] just like the apostles hit the target.
[1:09:52] You'll live the way they did. You you
[1:09:54] were baptized the way they were. You'll
[1:09:56] see the same results they see. You'll
[1:09:58] see it operating in you because you're
[1:10:00] zeroed in. You don't care what the
[1:10:02] company says, what denomination says,
[1:10:04] what anybody else said. You're zeroed in
[1:10:06] because you want to hit the target. Then
[1:10:09] you know where you're standing. It
[1:10:10] depends on what you're looking at. If
[1:10:13] you're looking to somebody else, you'll
[1:10:15] go anyway. And little any little puff of
[1:10:17] wind will blow you off target. If you
[1:10:19] can be blown off target, that means
[1:10:21] you're not being zeroed in. You're not
[1:10:23] focused. But if you are, there's nothing
[1:10:25] going to stop it.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; If your eyes single and you're looking
[1:10:32] at this at this at this target, Amen. I
[1:10:35] don't care how much wind blows. I don't
[1:10:37] care how much anxiety come. I don't care
[1:10:39] how much fear tries to put itself in
[1:10:41] front of you. It will not be stopped.
[1:10:45] Remember
[1:10:48] remember the story about the boy that
[1:10:49] won the bicycle thing
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; because his eyes was on the right
[1:10:53] target.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; It was on the finish line.
[1:10:58] All these other boys were better riders
[1:10:59] than he was. They could do tricks on
[1:11:02] their bike. They could sit on the
[1:11:03] handlebars and ride backwards. They ride
[1:11:04] with no hands. He didn't have the
[1:11:07] fanciest of bikes. But here he comes up
[1:11:10] and he gets on this little plank and
[1:11:11] rides it to the finish line. They're
[1:11:13] like, "How did you do this? How how
[1:11:15] could you make it when we are much
[1:11:17] better writers than you and we are much
[1:11:19] better equipped than you and we are more
[1:11:22] called than you and we are why how he
[1:11:25] said because I didn't look down around
[1:11:27] me.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; I didn't see how high I was off the
[1:11:31] ground and get all worried about it. I
[1:11:33] didn't see how narrow the road was.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; I didn't see all of that. I kept my eyes
[1:11:40] on the finish line.
[1:11:43] Come on, church of the living God.
[1:11:44] That's exactly what you have to do. You
[1:11:47] can't look to see all the things that
[1:11:49] are around you and all the problems and
[1:11:51] the situation and the things that's
[1:11:52] going on here and the things that's on
[1:11:54] this side over here. You don't look to
[1:11:56] the left. You don't look to the right.
[1:11:58] You look to Jesus Christ.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; He started the work. He will finish the
[1:12:03] work.
[1:12:08] You may have not have seen the
[1:12:09] fulfillment of what you asked for in a
[1:12:11] prayer line, but don't look to the left
[1:12:13] or look to the right. You look at what
[1:12:15] God promised. He promised me my healing.
[1:12:18] He promised me my child. He promised me
[1:12:20] every all these saying whatever you he I
[1:12:22] ask and I'm going to receive it.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; It depends on what you're looking at and
[1:12:31] how you're looking at things.
[1:12:35] Some people have negative outlooks. Some
[1:12:37] people have positive outlooks
[1:12:40] on life in general. Brother Brown would
[1:12:43] talk about Moses and Pharaoh and how
[1:12:44] they looked at things. And he said they
[1:12:47] would look out the same window
[1:12:50] and they saw those people out there
[1:12:51] differently.
[1:12:55] He said one saw nothing but a bunch of
[1:12:57] mudbers and slaves and despicables and
[1:13:01] all. That's all he could see. And he
[1:13:03] said, "Another one looked out and saw
[1:13:04] the chosen of God."
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; Ah, what was they looking with?
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; They were looking at apparently two
[1:13:12] different sets of eyes. Not just
[1:13:14] physically because they saw the same
[1:13:16] people. They saw the same people in the
[1:13:18] same mud, building the making the same
[1:13:20] bricks, building the same city. There
[1:13:22] wasn't it wasn't a change in in scenery
[1:13:24] at all. It was the same scene. But
[1:13:27] Pharaoh, when he looked, all he saw was
[1:13:28] slaves. All he saw was misfits. All he
[1:13:31] saw was people that he he had made can
[1:13:33] make profit off of. All he saw, wait a
[1:13:36] minute, was all this. But when Moses
[1:13:37] looked out, he saw those same people,
[1:13:40] but he saw with different eyes.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Come on, somebody. Amen. I
[1:13:47] ought to give us a good lesson on how we
[1:13:49] look at people at church.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; We look with the wrong eyeballs. We can
[1:13:53] see a lot of hypocrites. We can see a
[1:13:55] lot of this. We can see a lot of that.
[1:13:57] Just like Balams, he saw all kind of
[1:13:59] things going on at the hinder parts of
[1:14:01] Israel. Amen. But what he failed to see
[1:14:03] was the pillar of fire. What he failed
[1:14:05] to see was a shout of the king in the
[1:14:07] camp.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; What he failed to see was Jesus Christ
[1:14:11] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; And if you look with the wrong eyes, you
[1:14:17] can see problems. You can see situations
[1:14:19] that you don't know what to do with. You
[1:14:21] can see things you don't like. But if
[1:14:23] you can look through the eyes of Christ,
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; you would look with the same grace he
[1:14:29] looks with.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; You would look with the same love he
[1:14:33] looks with.
[1:14:41] Moses and Pharaoh looking out the same
[1:14:43] window at the same scene, but different
[1:14:46] eyes.
[1:14:53] Well, you look, somebody said, "Well,
[1:14:55] this can't happen. That can't happen."
[1:14:58] No, you look at what you know did
[1:15:00] happen.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; I know God met me there. Doesn't matter
[1:15:04] what anybody says or anybody thinks. I
[1:15:06] know God was there and I know he
[1:15:08] answered me. He heard me. He's the same
[1:15:12] yesterday, today, and forever. Focus out
[1:15:15] all the creeds and things that's got you
[1:15:16] mixed up. Focus on the word of God and
[1:15:19] then confess your unbelief and let God
[1:15:21] take his Holy Spirit and direct your
[1:15:23] sights right back to Jesus. We're
[1:15:25] looking to him then, not what anybody
[1:15:27] else says, not even what a doctor says.
[1:15:29] It might be good, but we ain't even
[1:15:31] looking at what a doctor said. He got
[1:15:32] his place. Amen. But we're looking at
[1:15:34] what Jesus said. We're looking at what
[1:15:37] he done. See, faith is designed to do
[1:15:40] this. See, faith today sees the same
[1:15:42] thing. faith in the of the church today
[1:15:44] would see the same program of God as it
[1:15:47] did 2,000 years ago. He said the church
[1:15:50] today that's called of God will
[1:15:52] certainly see the program of God because
[1:15:54] the program of God is written out here
[1:15:56] the blueprint and the Holy Spirit by
[1:15:58] faith is the one who reads it and sets
[1:16:00] it together. So if you're coming up with
[1:16:02] a different idea of the blueprint,
[1:16:04] you're looking through the wrong
[1:16:06] eyeballs.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; You might be looking through
[1:16:08] intellectual eyes. You might be looking
[1:16:10] through intellectual abilities, but if
[1:16:12] you'll look through the eyes of Christ,
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; you'll see that this word has the same
[1:16:18] results as it had 2,000 years ago. It'll
[1:16:22] heal the sick. It'll raise the dead.
[1:16:24] It'll defeat Satan anytime, any place,
[1:16:27] anywhere, and any condition.
[1:16:36] He said, "How can a man say he's filled
[1:16:37] with the Holy Ghost and the Holy Spirit
[1:16:39] say a certain way to do something in the
[1:16:40] Bible and this man comes around?" Well,
[1:16:42] that just that's just fanaticism. That
[1:16:44] don't mean nothing.
[1:16:46] Same kind of spirit that'll look at what
[1:16:47] a prophet says. Well, I don't agree with
[1:16:49] him. Who Who left you in charge?
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; I just soon go with a vindicated
[1:16:54] prophet.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; I done seen where that spirit takes
[1:16:59] people.
[1:17:03] But Moses looked by faith. Pharaoh
[1:17:06] looked with his eyes what he could see.
[1:17:10] We could see. We could see when they
[1:17:12] when they had when when they come and
[1:17:13] they had sin in the camp and Moses made
[1:17:15] a brass serpent.
[1:17:17] It was a symbol. It was a symbol of
[1:17:20] something to come.
[1:17:22] It was showing that sin had been judged.
[1:17:25] And he stuck up this brass serpent and
[1:17:27] said, "Look and live."
[1:17:30] And if they looked, they were healed.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; But they they refused. Say, "What in the
[1:17:35] world, Moses? A serpent? Are you kidding
[1:17:37] me? What in the world? Couldn't you come
[1:17:39] up with a better plan than this?"
[1:17:42] Listen, God's plans don't always add up
[1:17:45] to human thinking.
[1:17:48] Matter of fact, it's so far and beyond.
[1:17:50] But what was it doing? It was speaking
[1:17:52] of a lamb that was going to be lifted up
[1:17:53] between heaven and earth and be judged.
[1:17:56] Amen. Sinned, judged in his body. divine
[1:17:59] judgment be brought forth. And if they
[1:18:01] would look at it, then they could live.
[1:18:03] Amen. And he said, "That's exactly the
[1:18:05] same way it is today. If you'll not look
[1:18:07] at your problems and your situations and
[1:18:09] all the things that are around you and
[1:18:11] you'll look to the one who took your
[1:18:12] judgment,
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; who took your sin, who took your pain,
[1:18:16] who took your sickness, and you'll look
[1:18:18] to him, then you can live."
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; No wonder the devil wants us to keep
[1:18:23] looking at our circumstances. Because if
[1:18:25] we keep looking at our circumstances,
[1:18:26] the how the longer we look at our
[1:18:28] circumstances, the quicker we're going
[1:18:30] to die.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; But if we'll turn our eyes to the things
[1:18:35] around us and the situations around us
[1:18:39] and we'll look to Jesus Christ and look
[1:18:42] and live.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what he said. He said, "If
[1:18:45] you're full of anxiety, look and live.
[1:18:49] If you're full of fear, look and live."
[1:18:51] That's right.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; If you have sickness in your body, look
[1:18:54] to Jesus and live.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; We We want We want big things to happen.
[1:19:06] Boom. Our enemies are dead around us.
[1:19:09] Woo! Glory to God.
[1:19:12] That ain't always the way it works out.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; Sometimes he leads you right in the
[1:19:17] middle of your enemies.
[1:19:20] They're breathing their breath and they
[1:19:21] got their swords drawn and they're
[1:19:23] screaming out cursings and all kinds of
[1:19:25] stuff at and he leads you right down.
[1:19:27] Long as he's leading, that's all that
[1:19:28] matters.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Elijah when he came and prayed for
[1:19:34] rain.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; He tells the servant, "Go look." And he
[1:19:39] comes back and there ain't nothing. Go
[1:19:40] look ain't nothing. He comes back the
[1:19:41] seventh time and he said, "Well, I see a
[1:19:43] cloud the size of a man's hand.
[1:19:50] It wasn't no Louisiana thunder boomer
[1:19:54] come blowing through. Oh, it's going to
[1:19:57] rain.
[1:20:00] Glory to God. We can shout it's going to
[1:20:02] rain. It was the size of a man's hand.
[1:20:06] Seems so insignificant. But Elijah
[1:20:09] looked at that size of a man's hand and
[1:20:12] said, "As I see and I hear the abundance
[1:20:15] of rain,
[1:20:17] Not just a little drip drop, but the
[1:20:19] abundance of rain. Not just a little bit
[1:20:22] of here and a little bitty there, but
[1:20:24] abundance of rain.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; You may not see nothing tonight, but
[1:20:28] just the size of a cloud, the size of a
[1:20:31] man's hand. But if you'll look at it not
[1:20:33] with these eyes, and you'll look through
[1:20:35] the eyes of faith,
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; I see the abundance of healing. I see
[1:20:40] the abundance of joy. I see the
[1:20:43] abundance of salvation. I see the
[1:20:45] abundance of prodals coming home.
[1:20:50] I see the abundance of deliverance.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; What are you looking at, brother
[1:20:55] Timothy? You see a big old cl hurricane
[1:20:57] out there. No, I see the cloud the size
[1:20:59] of a man's hand.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; But little is much when God is in it.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Been faith. We have to have faith to
[1:21:11] look at things not as how the world
[1:21:14] looks at it, but at how God looks at it.
[1:21:18] Amen. Elijah kept looking until he seen
[1:21:21] just the size of a man's hand. He said,
[1:21:23] "Now unbelief would have caught that
[1:21:25] right quick and said, God, if that's the
[1:21:27] best you can do, if that's all you got,
[1:21:30] take it back."
[1:21:35] Well, I didn't get that. I didn't get
[1:21:36] nothing. I thought I did, but I didn't
[1:21:38] get nothing.
[1:21:40] I thought I saw a victory, but I guess I
[1:21:42] didn't.
[1:21:44] I I thought I saw I thought I got I
[1:21:47] thought I got the Holy Ghost, but I
[1:21:48] guess I didn't get it.
[1:21:52] That's the best you got. That's all you
[1:21:53] can do. Take it back. But he wasn't
[1:21:56] looking at that. He was looking at the
[1:21:57] supernatural.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; He knew what the hand of God could do.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; And when he saw the hand, J E S U S F A
[1:22:06] I T Hs. And when he saw it, he said, "I
[1:22:09] hear the sound of abundance of rain."
[1:22:11] What was it? He was accepting the He
[1:22:14] accepted the first move.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; Hello. He accepted the first move.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; Not the last move, not the finality.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; You know, when you watch fireworks, how
[1:22:32] many How many ever been to a fireworks
[1:22:34] show? You know when all the clapping
[1:22:36] takes place and when all the grand
[1:22:38] finale goes off, right? Boom.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; Well, what he's telling us, we ought to
[1:22:48] have the same enthusiasm when the first
[1:22:50] little
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; What are you seeing, brother Timothy? I
[1:23:04] just saw the first move.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; What was the first move? Somebody
[1:23:12] believed God.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; Somebody believed that he could provide
[1:23:22] rain in a desert and it been in a famine
[1:23:25] and been in a in a drought. God was
[1:23:28] going to move and break that drought.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe you felt that way. Maybe you
[1:23:34] felt for a couple years you've been in a
[1:23:36] drought. But let me tell you, this
[1:23:37] weekend and tonight, there's a poof.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; All of a sudden, one little rock goes
[1:23:47] rolling off the mountain. One little
[1:23:50] grain of sand goes rolling growing off
[1:23:52] the mountain. One little movement takes
[1:23:54] place. We ought to be shouting and
[1:23:56] praising God. Whether it's one grain of
[1:23:58] sand or drum dump truckloads of grap
[1:24:00] sand, it don't matter. God's moving
[1:24:03] anyhow. God's changing this situation.
[1:24:06] God's making a way where there seems to
[1:24:08] be no way. That's what I'm looking at.
[1:24:20] He made the first move. He accepted the
[1:24:23] first move.
[1:24:28] Maybe there somebody just scrupled up,
[1:24:30] you know, in all kind of things,
[1:24:34] situations of life. Maybe you feel like
[1:24:37] you've been in a belly of a whale.
[1:24:40] Jonah was there one day, but he refused
[1:24:43] to look at the whale vomit around him
[1:24:46] and the stomach or the fish. We we tend
[1:24:50] to call it a whale, but the Bible says a
[1:24:51] fish,
[1:24:53] whatever kind of fish it was, it was a
[1:24:55] special kind of fish.
[1:25:01] I never forget that guy that said, he
[1:25:03] said, "I'm the kind of guy, I don't care
[1:25:06] if the Bible said it was a bluegill." I
[1:25:08] said, "One big old blue gill."
[1:25:14] But whatever it was, he was in it
[1:25:17] down in the bottom of the ocean.
[1:25:20] But he said, "I'm not going to look at
[1:25:21] all these symptoms around me. I'm not
[1:25:24] going to look at the circumstances as
[1:25:25] well. Vomit.
[1:25:27] It's time you start looking at what the
[1:25:29] devil's doing is just vomit.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; Just vomit.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; It's all it is.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; Filth.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Trying to surround your life in trying
[1:25:42] to tear you down. Quit looking at it.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Now, I don't know how in the world he
[1:25:48] figured this out, but baby, I guess it
[1:25:50] was just by faith because he was in a
[1:25:51] dark place. No doubt. There was no pull
[1:25:54] string light bulb down there. I don't
[1:25:56] believe
[1:25:58] wasn't no compass. He say, "Okay, I'm
[1:25:59] pointing north, pointing south." No, it
[1:26:01] was by faith.
[1:26:03] He heard the word of God and he said,
[1:26:04] "When my people are in need and they
[1:26:07] call on my name, they turn toward my
[1:26:09] holy temple and they call on my name,
[1:26:12] they will hear from heaven."
[1:26:15] He says, "So I'm going to look away from
[1:26:17] all of these symptoms, all this well
[1:26:18] vomit, and all this situation around me,
[1:26:21] and I'm going to look to the hills which
[1:26:23] cometh my from my my help. For my help
[1:26:25] cometh from the Lord."
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. And by faith, he turned in that
[1:26:29] old dark place. The devil had made it so
[1:26:32] dark, he couldn't even see his hand in
[1:26:34] front of his face. But he refused to
[1:26:35] look at all of that. And he looked
[1:26:37] towards the temple of God.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I believe if people can look
[1:26:42] towards a natural temple built by a
[1:26:44] natural man, how much more how much more
[1:26:47] faith could you have tonight? Not to
[1:26:49] look at something Solomon built or
[1:26:51] something anybody on on earth built, but
[1:26:53] a kingdom that is made not by hands of
[1:26:56] man, but the kingdom of God. And we
[1:26:58] could turn our eyes
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; from all the things around us and look
[1:27:04] to the hills which cometh our help.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Cuz our help comes from God.
[1:27:12] We say, "God, I'm going to praise you in
[1:27:15] this storm.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; I'm going to praise you no matter what.
[1:27:20] I'm going to magnify you no matter what
[1:27:21] goes on in my life cuz I know you're in
[1:27:24] control of every situation."
[1:27:37] He said, "You know, the devil sometimes
[1:27:38] put people off to revivals."
[1:27:42] Well, if I get to that revival, then
[1:27:44] things can be better. He said, "Might be
[1:27:46] fair. That might be good. But you don't
[1:27:48] have to wait till a revival."
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; The best part of a revival is revival's
[1:27:54] right now.
[1:27:58] God wants to start it in you. God wants
[1:28:00] to start it in the church. The Holy
[1:28:01] Spirit will take the message and bring
[1:28:02] forth a message. God will vindicate it
[1:28:04] with great signs and wonders. Refuse to
[1:28:06] see anything that will make you doubt.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Refuse to see anything that'll make you
[1:28:16] doubt. Job,
[1:28:19] he had a lot to look at. Boils on his
[1:28:21] body, wife turning away from him. friend
[1:28:24] sitting around him accusing him of being
[1:28:25] a secret sinner.
[1:28:28] But all of a sudden, somebody come say,
[1:28:30] "Hey, Joe, stand up. G yourself. Let me
[1:28:34] talk to you like a man."
[1:28:36] So, let me show you something. Let me
[1:28:38] get your eyes off your balls.
[1:28:41] Let me get your eyes off your
[1:28:43] circumstances around you. Let me get
[1:28:45] your eyes off your children that died in
[1:28:47] that accident and this thing that
[1:28:48] happened over. Let me get your eyes off
[1:28:50] of it. Let me get your eyes on something
[1:28:52] that's eternal. And all of a sudden, the
[1:28:54] darkness broke in Job. And he looked and
[1:28:57] he said, "I know
[1:28:59] my redeemer lives.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Though the skin worms destroy my body,
[1:29:04] yet in my flesh I shall see God."
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; What was it? He got away from what was
[1:29:11] temporary.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; Because the situation he was in was
[1:29:15] temporary. It ended.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; God restored. Amen. Back twofold.
[1:29:28] God's trying to get us to look at
[1:29:29] something greater than what we can see
[1:29:32] with these eyes.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; God wants us to look at his word and his
[1:29:36] word only. Hallelujah. Let's stand
[1:29:39] together.
[1:29:54] He said, "Look at the church today. It's
[1:29:57] in chaos.
[1:30:00] All mixed up. The world just in chaos
[1:30:03] around us. It's looking
[1:30:06] what's happening? Do we got this? Do we
[1:30:07] got that? What's going on?" But he said,
[1:30:10] "There's another person. There's another
[1:30:13] people, the bride.
[1:30:16] And they're looking also.
[1:30:18] They're looking for the coming of the
[1:30:21] Lord Jesus
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; with that secret secret coming of Christ
[1:30:26] when he shall come and catch away his
[1:30:29] bride in the night.
[1:30:33] [Music]
[1:30:35] Let's bow our hearts for a moment
[1:30:38] to just say, "Lord,
[1:30:40] let me stay focused.
[1:30:43] Lord, let let not let not my eyes get on
[1:30:46] things around me in situations,
[1:30:49] but let my eyes stay on you, Jesus.
[1:30:55] Father, you see hands lifted all over
[1:30:57] this building.
[1:31:02] Oh God, so easy sometimes to get
[1:31:05] sidetracked,
[1:31:07] thoughts on other things, situations
[1:31:09] around us.
[1:31:11] [Music]
[1:31:13] God, no doubt even this week, Satan's
[1:31:15] come and tempted many to look and say,
[1:31:17] "Well, did you get anything?
[1:31:20] Did you really get what you said you
[1:31:21] got,
[1:31:24] trying to knock them off their focus
[1:31:27] and thereby knock them off the promises
[1:31:29] of God." But Lord, tonight as we've
[1:31:31] heard the word, may our eyes look
[1:31:34] straight before us to the finish line.
[1:31:39] It will be worth it all.
[1:31:44] Oh, God bless each hand that was lifted.
[1:31:45] Father, have my hand too. Lord, so easy
[1:31:48] to get our eyes on things around us,
[1:31:52] circumstances of life, sicknesses and
[1:31:55] things.
[1:31:57] God, forgive us for our unbelief and our
[1:31:59] doubts.
[1:32:02] God, fill us with faith. To believe,
[1:32:03] Lord, today,
[1:32:05] to believe for impossible things to
[1:32:07] become possible.
[1:32:10] Lord, to believe, Father, in spite of
[1:32:12] what the world's doing, what's around
[1:32:14] us, in spite of the what Satan's doing,
[1:32:17] hot breath blowing upon us, in spite of
[1:32:19] it all. And Lord, while we believe, may
[1:32:22] we yet praise you and thank you for all
[1:32:25] that you've done in our lives.
[1:32:29] Oh Jesus, we love you. Father,
[1:32:33] bless us tonight in your presence. I
[1:32:35] pray in Jesus name.
[1:32:38] Amen.
[1:32:40] Lord,
[1:32:44] I
[1:32:48] praise the Lord.
[1:32:53] I
[1:32:55] will praise
[1:32:57] the Lord. Oh,
[1:33:01] no matter what tomorrow brings,
[1:33:07] what it has in store,
[1:33:11] I
[1:33:12] will praise
[1:33:14] the Lord.
[1:33:16] [Music]
[1:33:17] Yes, I
[1:33:20] I will praise
[1:33:23] the Lord.
[1:33:28] I

[1:33:32] the Lord
[1:33:36] no matter what tomorrow brings,
[1:33:41] what it has in store.
[1:33:45] I
[1:33:46] will praise
[1:33:49] the Lord.
[1:33:51] [Music]
[1:33:58] Yes, I will praise the Lord. I
[1:34:04] will praise
[1:34:06] the Lord.
[1:34:08] [Music]
[1:34:10] No matter what tomorrow brings,
[1:34:15] what it has in store,
[1:34:19] I
[1:34:21] will praise
[1:34:23] the Lord.
[1:34:25] [Music]
[1:34:32] and pains of death seized on my soul. Oh
[1:34:39] to the Lord I cried.
[1:34:44] Till Jesus came and he made me whole.
[1:34:51] I would not be
[1:34:56] would not be denied.
[1:35:00] [Music]
[1:35:02] I would not be denied
[1:35:08] till Jesus came and he made me whole. I
[1:35:14] would not be denied.
[1:35:19] Oh shake of in the day of old. I wrestle
[1:35:27] with the Lord
[1:35:31] and instead with a courageous
[1:35:37] I stood stood upon his word.
[1:35:42] You said I would not be denied.
[1:35:48] No, I would not be denied.
[1:35:54] Till Jesus came and he made me whole. I
[1:36:00] would not be denied.
[1:36:05] Hello Satan said my Lord was gone and he
[1:36:12] would not hear my prayer.
[1:36:17] But praise the Lord the work is done in
[1:36:23] Christ the Lord is here.
[1:36:29] Oh, I would not be
[1:36:32] I would not be denied. I would not be
[1:36:37] denied
[1:36:40] till Jesus came and he made me whole. I
[1:36:46] would not be denied. No, I would not. I
[1:36:52] would not be denied.
[1:36:58] I would not be denied
[1:37:03] till Jesus came and made me whole. I
[1:37:10] would not be denied.
[1:37:14] Oh, I will not compreise.
[1:37:20] No, will not compreise.
[1:37:24] [Music]
[1:37:26] Till Jesus comes and he makes me whole.
[1:37:32] I will not compromise.
[1:37:36] [Music]
[1:37:37] No, I will not be denied.
[1:37:43] Oh Lord, I will not be denied.
[1:37:50] Till Jesus came and he made me behold
[1:37:55] I would not be denied.
[1:38:02] Give the Lord a good hand clap of praise
[1:38:03] tonight.
[1:38:05] Amen.
[1:38:08] Praise the Lord.
[1:38:10] Keep that laser focus.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Keep our eyes on the prize.
[1:38:14] There's something to gain.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. We can lose this whole world, but
[1:38:19] give me Jesus. Amen. We love you tonight
[1:38:21] in the name of the Lord. We won't hold
[1:38:23] you. Let you be dismissed as you feel to
[1:38:25] go. Maybe we can play. Open the eyes of
[1:38:28] my heart, Lord, as we go. Open the eyes
[1:38:30] of my heart. Same key flat. Amen. We
[1:38:34] love you tonight. God bless you. Pray
[1:38:36] for the ministry, for the services this
[1:38:38] weekend. Remember those that are gone
[1:38:42] away for a couple of days. I think
[1:38:44] there's some camping trips that are
[1:38:46] going on. And so just remember them in
[1:38:47] prayer and we'll pray for them and I'm
[1:38:49] sure they'll be praying for us as well.
[1:38:51] God bless you tonight. We'll just sing
[1:38:53] this as you go.
[1:38:56] Open the eyes of my heart, Lord.

[1:39:39] Lord. I want to see you,
[1:39:44] to see you, to see you. High and lifted
[1:39:50] up.
[1:39:53] Oh, shining in the light of your glory.
[1:40:00] Pour out your power and love
[1:40:04] as we sing. Holy, holy,
[1:40:09] holy,
[1:40:11] [Music]
