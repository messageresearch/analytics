asking Lord that you'd come today Lord that you would just move in the lives and hearts of men and women that have gathered here we have gathered in your name and where We Gather in your name miracles happen oh God When We Gather in your name the power of God moves moves Back to Darkness and causes Faith to rise in the promise Lord we're just looking to you today and asking that you would Minister to hearts and lives there are needs that are here Among Us needs of Salvation Deliverance needs of encouragement strength Lord needs oh God the needs of your people there are many some needs healing and deliverance in their body they're tormented by the devil having come and tormented their flesh and poking them with the thorns and the thistles that this whole earth will grow oh God we're asking that you would be the god rich in Mercy today as we know you are that you'd be merciful personally to each heart there are souls that needs touching Lord that maybe have sat here serving service after service and perhaps a hard shell over them that hasn't ever been softened by the Holy Spirit I pray oh god there com such a rain and such a saturation of your spirit that every hardened heart will not be able to resist the moving of your Holy Ghost but you will speak in a supernatural way today Lord that you would give us your anointing let the anointed of God come down upon us and flow through the gift that you have placed in the Pulpit this morning Lord oh God as a messenger stands in the Pulpit May the Holy Spirit anoint him to minister the word of life because how can we preach unless we be sent Lord how can we Minister unless we are anointed and then how can we hear without a preacher and how can we hear then unless the Holy Spirit anoints the ear to hear so I ask Lord that you'll do your work today among us there are needs Lord you know them oh God I I'm sure there are needs in your own life and need to be loved cared for adored worshiped we want to do that today to give back to you the almighty meet the needs that is in your life Lord today in your heart that you would feel welcome Lord that we you would feel appre appreciate it for what you've done for us for the grace the mercy that you've shown the blood that you shed Lord that we would remember today oh God the the great price that you paid for us Lord when you declared in that our worth to you father I pray in the name of Jesus you'll take away from us all feelings of unworthiness all feelings of downcast and unbelief and cause us Lord today to come before your gates with praise and with a worship in our hearts and uh and thoughts that are acceptable unto you Lord oh God that that word would go forth and then we would receive it in our hearts and there would be the amen and when the amen comes forth from our life then it causes you to move on our behalf Lord ministering to that need oh God you are the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart and you still have your word today as it goes forth and you know Lord what is in every heart and what needs to be discerned and what needs to be addressed and what needs to be spoken to Lord we're asking you to speak oh God give us ears to hear and an appetite to receive but we ask it in the name of Jesus For Your Glory for for your honor amen and amen praise the Lord amen God bless you isin't it wonderful to be here today and be in the presence of the Lord and we're just we're just wanting to Worship the Lord together if you just um Worship the Lord together with me as we read the word and as we preach the word is God speaks I believe that he can speak today through the ministry of the word directly to your heart and I believe he has a message for you this morning that he wants you to hear and you not not just hear as far as listen but be a doer of the word and your lives to be changed in his presence amen may God grant it to you today let's turn to 1 Corinthians chapter 15 and verse 51 if you'll read this together with me while you're standing 1 Corinthians 15 and verse1 15 1 we're going to be speaking on adopted son's ascending and we remember in our theme as we're going along of who art thou oh great Mountain Thou shalt become a plain and The Headstone shall be brought forth with shoutings crying Grace Grace un it verse 51 says behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed how many plans to be a part of that Lord whatever oh God the change that has taking place in my heart is a reflection of the change that I will receive in my body Amen in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised and corruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptible must put on incorruption which is the reverse of what happened at the fall because there incorruption put on corruption but there you know there was immortality that took on mortality but here this Mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptible shall put on incorruption and this Mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the SA that is written death is swallowed up in Victory amen God bless you can be seated oh my I know with that saying brought to pass of death swallowed up in Victory there'll be great rejoicing in heaven amen now there cannot be a victory without a battle without war and before the bride can be raptured the war must be settled and it must be settled in heaven now two things must happen first Satan cast down and the battle won and when that happens the dead in Christ will resurrect and come here it will actually release them to come here and and of course their they will resurrect their bodies and glorify them and then we will be changed and then Jesus comes and we will meet him in the air 1 Thessalonians 4:16 says the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first and then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord what promises that we have in the scripture you see there's an appointed place that we're going to meet him we will not meet him here on the earth as Earthbound creatures but we will meet him in the air as glorified Sons and Daughters of God Amen we will not meet him in bodies of Flesh and the sense of mortal flesh because flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God the Bible says but but we will meet him in changed bodies you see not only in the in the type of Sarah could she not receive the the promised son in the body that old decrepit form that she had but she had to be changed in order to receive that promised son even so we cannot meet the Lord in these bodies these bodies are Rags that we have sinned in and you know many things in our lives and in these bodies remind us of our sins you know where that we smoke we drank we lied we bore the marks of sin Upon Our flesh but there will be no signs of sin no remembrance of any kind of marks of unbelief that will be on our bodies we will be in total perfection without one blemish without a spot without even a wrinkle what a promise that is to us as mortal creatures today that we can look toward a promise of immortality that there we have an appointed place to meet him just like he spoke to um the disciples before he went away and he says now I'm um I I I want you to meet me in Jerusalem after my resurrection and and so we also have a designated place to meet him we are to meet him in the air and we have an Old Testament prophecy that is a type in the scripture where that Abraham sent his servant elaser to get a bride for Isaac it is a an allegory or a parable or more than just a story but a prophecy of what God would do about getting himself a bride for his own son and and of course Abraham had sent his servant to get a a bride and and um you know she had to be of his kin folk she couldn't be just of anyone she had to be related to him this is why that through our new birth we are related to him these old fleshly bodies are not related to him they are they are Redeemed by him but they're not related to him but he will change them and glorify them and our new bodies will be related to him but already in our soul we have a relationship with him because we are of the same genus the same seed the same likeness the same kind and so as as at as we think of this at the end of the long journey and I've reflected before and I think of it again as I I I I just something within me size you know what what a great day is going to be when we are finally home when the Troubles of Life are over when the Sorrows of this world is passed when the enmity of this flesh is over with and the wars that we have experienced in this body is all over with and we're finally home when we finally meet him this one that we have longed to see it's a it's it's going to be the most awesome wonderful moment and we know that and as elaser went to get a Rebecca and they were approaching the Homeland and the Bible says that Isaac came down to meet her you know he didn't meet her exactly there just like Jesus will not meet us in heaven but he will meet us in the air in Genesis 2462 Isaac came from the well way of the of the well leyro which means the one who sees all things you may be wondering about your own life today but let me just tell you God sees it he sees your struggles he sees your situation if you're fatherless he understands he saw your fatherless condition if you're without a spouse he saw that situation he knows if your children are astray or you've been bered of children you know God knows he's the one who sees he is also known as the Living God so he comes to meet us at The Well of the living one the one who sees our afflictions that understands our problems that comes to meet us at a place where where God is is shows himself alive that he's real that he's the same yesterday today and forever The God Who changes not and so he he he says he came down by the way of The Well of lroy and where he dwelt in the South Country and Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the evening time and he lifted up his eyes and saw and behold the camels were coming and Isaac or Rebecca lifted up her eyes and when she saw Isaac she lighted off the camel for she said un to the servant what man is this that walketh in the field to meet us and the servant had said that it is my master therefore she took a veil and covered herself now I want you to get the picture here today in the very type that not only has the bride been anticipating no doubt around the campfires at night perhaps asking questions learning about Isaac wondering what Isaac was really like can you tell me something about him oh servant of Abraham you know you you know Isaac I've never met him I've only heard about him but I I want to know about him you know I I want to know his character and what I'm to expect and how he's going to receive me and what kind of home am I going to and you know what is my future home of this heavenly bridegroom and this Earthly bride and you know tell me what he's like you know what what what is his feature and I I can almost hear him say you know well I saw him one night in in a corn field and in a Sagebrush field and and there is the wind was blowing I saw him standing there in midair I saw his garments flowing his face was was there his eyes when when he looked at me I just passed out I couldn't take it when he looked he said he could look like he could speak the world into Oblivion but yet he had such compassion and such Mercy when he looked at me you know and and he would begin to describe you know I we've been making plans a long time you see God had a plan for you and it didn't just start here but it started started before the foundation of the world you see yes he knew that you would need Redemption so he planned it all out before the world began and and he became the lamb slain in his own thinking I'll give my life I'll give my life and I want you to know you know Isaac is is that kind of a man he he he would become the sacrifice and willingly would lay down upon the Altar and care um you know he he would become the the lamb but yet God would spare him Rebecca and not take his life but I want you to know about our Isaac God didn't spare him he poured all the Wrath all the enmity all of the hatred all of the things that that the the wrath of God that was upon sin and we were The Sinner and he poured it out upon him and he became the sacrifice for our Redemption I'm talking about our Isaac now I'm talking about our Isaac who became the lamb that would take that would be the W the the wounded lamb as it had been slain and this lamb who had paid the price would come and claim the inheritance for every one of you that you could be married and United you unworthy lost creatures could be saved delivered and know God in power and be a child of God be in his family he came all the way from Glory Rebecca he willingly gave his life we have journeyed for seven Church chases we've made Seven camps along the way and you know we're getting close to home now this next one from this Camp is home from this age is the meeting there are no more camps to go to no more no more lonely nights no more times without him trouble's gone the threats of of being harmed of of Raiders coming in and destroying us taking our life all of that's over the devil will be bound for a thousand years amen oh what is he going to be when we get [Music] home the burden's passed the trouble's over and to think he's going to prepare a place for you he's anticipating your arrival there he's been meditating in the field amen he's been thinking yeah this moment I've been waiting on you think you waited a long time your time on Earth is just not even a blip in eternity but in the Eternal ages Beyond he was thinking of you everything he ever did has been revolved around you your plan his plan for your life bringing you into Perfection bringing in you into to Glory everything he's ever done every plan he's ever did the very reason Jesus came the very reason that he sent Messengers to the ages the very reason he sent the last Angel messenger amen was on all account of you you see he was the only one worthy to take the book and loose the seals and doing so he revealed his work to the ages and he also has exposed the Antichrist and he's going to prepare a place for you anticipating your arrival oh I hear Brother Bram talk about this in the leoan age he says this is the last warning there will not be another the throne room has been set up the 12 foundations have been laid the streets of gold have been paved the gates of gigantic pearls are raised and hinged like a pyramid she stands so fair and glorious the Heavenly beings who have prepared her watch breathlessly for she glistens and shines with the glory that is unearthly every facet of her beauty tells the story of Amazing Grace and of Jesus love and she's a city prepared for prepared people she awaits only for her inhabitants and soon they will strong they will throng her streets with joy yes it's the last call the spirit will not speak in another age the ages are over but he's meditating think of Isaac having left the tent standing out in the field meditating in the late afternoon when he sees Rebecca coming she had never seen him he of course Isaac had never seen her but when they met it was love at first sight she fell in love with him and he with her and and and she veiled herself oh I want you to understand friends you see the Bible said to buy me rment white rment that you might be clothed that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear amen the bride will not be in the drags of her Humanity because that would be nakedness you would feel so exposed wearing the dirty rags of this journey but in this moment that you before you meet him you get veiled you get a garment placed over you you get a fresh Ren of you of a Fresh B baptism of the Holy Ghost is shrouded with deity himself so that you can go and meet him not as a mortal but as an immortal what a day that will be Jesus will lead the kingdom and brother Brandon says it this way we'll not meet him in glory we are to meet him in the air between heavens and earth where it's expanded to redeem us in that great Rapture hour Heaven is expanded which means enlarged the mighty Angel descends his anointing strikes the Earth as he as he moves in his bride in the final cresendo and she does the works of God and as seven Thunders the very voice of God others their voices and mysterious things that have been to others now come known as as God becomes unveiled or or or made clear before our eyes and and the book is handed back to man as as they enter into full life complete and full Redemption comes as the Saints oh yeah even the dead in Christ come here and pick up their redeemed bodies and and are glorified and then we when we see them we too are changed and together we go to meet the Lord in the air this will all be the result of the greatest Cosmic battle ever and Heavens will be cleansed of Satan as the accuser of the Brethren is cast down I think a scripture that is so pertinent in our hour and gives me much excitement to preach about when I when I think about the subject at hand this morning I I can't hardly I can't hardly wait just to talk about it to speak about it and let the anointing of God flow through the word to you on it but as we read and you can turn to Revelation 12 and 7 and you go ahead and put that up that that that Revelation that we are going to read describes the last Angelic battle and Satan's ultimate expulsion from heaven from this point he will never enter into Heaven Again from this point on after this he gets Bound for a thousand years you know on the other side of when he's loose for a short season and the final Rebellion don't get back into heaven but he's cast into the Lake of Fire so this is his this right here is his last who raw in heaven and it ends in defeat it ends with him being expelled from Heaven forever forever John sees a great war between Michael and the angels of God and the dragon Satan and his Fallen Angels or his demons that takes place here in the end time Satan in his great pride and delusion that he can be like God he will lead his final rebellion in the heavens against God but it'll be a cosmic mismatch thus the dragon and his demons will lose the battle and be thrown out of Heaven forever we are looking this morning ahead not only do we see Jesus but we also see Satan cast down amen and for him to be cast down that means there's got to be a people of sin that's why I'm preaching about adopted Sons ascending not falling but ascending Revelation 12:7 says and there was war in heaven and Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not oh if we could just get down out under our fifth rib this morning and just weigh down in a heart just a moment and look down on the let it sink down on the inside right here into the heart and realize your enemy is not going to win you may be battling with sickness and that sickness may take you down to death but even death cannot defeat you amen death will only birth you into a new land amen into a theophonic form where there's no sorrow or no sickness and there and so he prevailed not and neither was there any place found their place notice their place found anymore in heaven now we could take these places and we could show you that you know of Judas you know he assert Authority that didn't belong to him and he was one of the 12 but he never he never belonged there are you are you with me he was only occupying the place of another man who wasn't ready to come there his name was the Apostle Paul and he had a work to do I'm talking about Judas he had to betray the Lord there had to be a crucifixion there had to be the slaying of the lamb and somebody had to do it so one was chosen even though he was a devil and he occupied the place of an apostle but the Bible said that he fell and went to his own place amen you find that in Acts chapter one and this is exactly the whole picture of the ex of Satan he is occupying a place that is not his because somebody hasn't been ready to take it yet now let's look into these great truths and the Great Dragon was cast out the old serpent called the devil now we find out who he was this is the one who deceived Eve which deceiveth the whole world caus the whole world to fall into sin and he was cast out in the earth and his angels were cast out with him and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night now this is exactly the same as is what we read this great Victory where death is swallowed up in Victory now so he say here is come that Victory here is come salvation strength and the kingdom of God here is the fullness of the Holy Ghost and the power of His Christ full Redemption for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accuse them before our God day and night and they over overcame them by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives un the death and there in the next verse shows these raptured Overcomers rejoicing in heaven therefore Rejoice you heavens and you that dwell in them and then there is a woe pronounced to those Left Behind oh Church you don't want to be left behind whatever it takes whatever you have to do there is nothing in this world worth being left behind for you may look and maybe your pride exalts this or exalts that and and you know judah's got 30 pieces of silver you know some people will sell him out for a little bit of whirlin a little bit of sin a little bit of something that they think is so valuable that is so important that they will put that ahead of Jesus I'll tell you what there ain't nothing worth that that can even compare to Jesus to eternal life and the glory that shall be revealed in us but they mock us and they make fun of us and and we suffer brother Tim and the sufferings of this life is nothing to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in US therefore Rejoice you Heavens you that dwell in them but woe to the inhabiters of the earth and the Sea for the devil has come down to to you have a great wrath because he knoweth he hath but a short time we're currently in the last battle I'm talking about before we get home sure there'll be Army again sure on the other side of the tribulation and on the other side of of of the Millennium even there's another great battle often called Gog and Magog but whatever we are currently in the last battle before the Rapture and it is the battle for the position of sons now that's what we're talking about adopted Sons we're not talking about adopting the devil's children and make them God's children but we're talking about a Roman would for example it was a custom in that day to take his own son when he came of age when he was mature and give make a celebration it would happen well about the age of 30 where he had been trained and tutored and learned the business and whatever and now the father was going to put it all in his hands friends it's about to be all put put back in our hands again in the millennial Reign we we will not take a an Axe and cut down a tree we will speak and it will happen why why isn't that given now because you got too much flesh amen how how many cars would you have spoken to Oblivion that that got in your way this morning that you in in your in your frustration and your anger that you know in your flesh you didn't spoke them out of your way spoke it into Oblivion but I tell you in that day our Natures will be totally changed it'll be a round of perfect love it'll be full of the Holy Ghost it will it will be something where where compassion and care and love permeates from God's people we currently in the last battle and it's a battle for positions you may not realize it this morning but you are in that battle and you are in that battle for your position to position yourself as a son or daughter of God it's it's easy to fall into the Trap of positioning yourself as a poor decrepit humanity and you see the troubles and the sorrows and sometimes you get over whelmed with the grief and the troubles that are around you and it's easy to position yourself there but what what the battle is is over your position of a son or a daughter of God to take your authority over the kingdom over the realm that God has given you we could talk about that for a moment but everybody doesn't have the same realm I have a realm as a pastor over at church but but my realm don't include every other church around the country a messenger to an age would have a realm that would expand around the world because he's got a he got a Ministry and a message to all people of the bride of Christ that's his realm that's what he's given that's why you know he had to walk the narrow way and choose a narrow path and and and where where God would come along and say it's my way because it's real a mother has a realm and that realm of her kingdom would be her children a wife would have a realm and that would be that of a husband and a family a husband would have a realm of a family where he's in there you may be a single person but you have a realm and a realm of influence a young person and you must be responsible in wherever God has called you and placed you because you see you have to show yourself faithful and true in that position before he trust you with another so you see our realm must be from the Heavenly realm where we control the atmospheres of our lives and and and our place and position in Heaven Must Be one before we can go there now and and before we can go there Satan must be cast out first and there will be a people that will overcome Satan first and foremost by the blood of the lamb and then by agreeing with the word by saying Amen to the word by rejoicing in tribulations by being thankful in wherever God has placed you at this moment being happy and content and whatever state you find yourself in bringing the atmosphere of Heaven rather than atmospheres of doubt and fear and sorrow and tears of unbelief it's very very important because the only way you'll ever meet Jesus is in the right air the right atmosphere if your atmosphere is full of of of frustration and doubting and confusion I usion and anger and and expressions you can never meet Jesus there he only is met in a place where that that you're appreciative of the blood of the Lamb amen and then you agree with the what the word says and where the word has placed you even if it's for a moment because the trials that you go through are for just a moment but to have an eternal weight of Glory so you see Satan must be cast out first there will be un people overcome Satan first and foremost as I said by the blood of the Lamb by agreeing with the word by testifying of what the word says and then loving the truth more than their own life for some the Bible tells tell you in the last days their lack of love for truth will cause their fall for they will be damn because they don't just love truth and for the bride she will overcome because she loves the word over her own life but the world says this but I think that but I I don't think this is wrong and I think you know listen forget your thoughts amen you know Rebecca may have had her own thoughts of of way you know maybe the culture she came from the way that she was but whatever she was willing to blend with Isaac she could say take this whole world let leave everything of my homeland behind of what I've known and the Norms that I've known and the the lifestyles that I'm leave it all behind but just let me have Isaac I'll take him that's the bride she's going to trade everything for Christ it's never questioning why how come why must I why did this why this restriction why that Lord I just want to please you I just want to be acceptable in your sight I just want when I meet you there's love at first sight amen you see and for the bride she's going to love the word over her own life and as they rise as they ascend Satan is cast down now as of right now Satan is the God of this evil age he is worship today by billions amen well you say brother jtim I've got a different opinion from this message and I have a different opinion about things and what brother Bram had well you're just one of the billions one of the billions well but for the bride she's going to love the word she going to love truth somebody with me amen she going to love truth she's going to love the word well it doesn't specifically say we can't smoke listen she's going to love the word she's not going to defile her Temple she's not going to look like the world it doesn't specifically say we can't enjoy marijuana she's not going to question it she's not going to ponder it she going to lay aside what she thinks about it and the Norms of the world and and the world's opinion and the scientific views and and the ideas of the world and she's going to take what he says because he's her head and as they arise they ascend and as they ascend Satan is cast down the question arises if Satan had already rebelled and was cast down from heaven perhaps even before the world was created or maybe maybe before man you know was yet upon the Earth why is he free to be both now in heaven and on Earth how how come how come he can come to Earth how come he he can he has free Reign Over the Earth how come he can he's even in heaven to be cast down why is he even there how did he even get there we know he rebelled in the beginning and was cast out so how did he come back how did he somehow get back in the heavens where he's got to be cast out the second time and what position is he in and you know he can't be anymore the covering Angel of the hovering cherub that cover and the protector of the word he he never could be a protector of the throne anymore he's been cast out from there but where is he what is he doing how come he's there who let him back in as right now let me tell you definitively Satan is the god of this evil age he is worshiped by billions he's called The Prince of Darkness he's called The Prince of this world he is even said that he he has that Darkness has a time remember is not Eternal it won't be forever for an eternity it's only for a season for a Time Satan has a limit on him he has an expiration date amen that's one thing about you you don't have an expiration date your body may have but even then it'll be picked up resurrected and glorified so you see here here we are you know in an end time battle and it's a battle between the sons of Light and the powers of darkness and as the sons of Light we have been made to have a Dominion but we lost our sunship and the Dominion that comes with it because of the fall but I think about this when brother bradam tells about how that we were made to be Gods sons of God offsprings of God with dominion over the world and and and then the longing that Romans 8 shows that we spoke on last Sunday of or all creation granth and travaileth together even now waiting for the adoption the placing of sons in their full Authority and position when the world will cease to Gran When sin will be totally done away with when evil will no longer be prevalent on the earth and there'll be no more Wars and killing upon the Earth and a great Millen Millennial rain will Dawn see he says we're waiting for the manifestations that's the revealing of the sons of God who will come back and take it over again waiting for the fullness of time when the pyramid gets up to the top when full sons of God will be manifested when the power of God will walk out Hallelujah and will take every Power that Satan has away from him let me just talk about these expectations in this end Time battle we're not talking about a weak and a powerless generation we're not talking about a people whose only weapon is argument but a people who has power over the darkness of Hell amen the power to cast Satan out the power to remit sins and they be remitted by the power of the Holy Ghost by the baptism of the spirit amen so you see he was the logos that went out of God that's true he's the word of God and then he made man a little God he made him from the word he was a product of God's Own spoken word where God created Man In His Image later he would form him out the dust of the Earth but first he's a creation in God's image and he's made an immortal spirit and so here in this form we we find he made man a God in his domain and that domain was to go from sea to Sea from Shore to Shore he was to have control over it he was to expand heaven on Earth until Eden would go from sea to Sea where the glory of God would cover the Earth and God gave him Dominion in a little spot on the earth and he says okay take dominion over this and as you take Dominion expand that Dominion until the glory of God will fill the Earth and I'll come dwell with my people on this Earth that's been God's plan for the Earth all along it's not the devil's Earth neither is this Earth of your body the devil's it was God's first he laid out the Timbers for them when he created the world and he put the very poish out the calcium all the elements that would be needed to made your body he laid it on the earth the Timbers to make your body but because of sin we come a different way we come formed in a woman's womb we came through the Pains of child birth and we come under the curse we were born in sin shaped in iniquity brought this world under the Prince of Darkness speaking his lies and then Jesus came and he proved that what a Son of God was to be like what God was to be like in the flesh what a born again man of woman a daughter of God son or daughter of God was to be he was the very first of the god race all the other in the god race would be just like him somebody with me now now as he did he was without sin and he proved it and he stood there when the winds blowed he said peace be still when the when the tree did not bear he said no man eat from you from here on and then he said barely barely I saying to you you little Gods you who believe can believe have the capacity of Faith like I do if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but you believe what you said will come to pass you too can have what you say you look back in Genesis back to the original and we see the world is groaning and crying and and everything's Desiring the the manifestations of the sons of God so not only are we anticipating but the whole world GRS brother Bram would he he would he would see in his uncanny vision and understanding he' he'd look at a tree that was dying and he would see it groaning for life and he say look everything of nature is groaning waiting for the day when a tree won't die when there W be sorrow on the Earth where there'll never be another grave turned and with a yellow sod and a loved one put there and you bury your heart never waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God when true Sons born Sons field Sons speak and the word is back to and he said I believe we're on the border of it right now and I I want you to understand we're here in the blending of the two where where Heaven is actually expanded for the sake of redemption and here Out of Heaven Come seven Mighty Angels amen and and and Seven Seals are revealed because there seven manifestations of one Mighty Spirit of almighty God amen and here that in the presence of that Pillar of Fire that ball of fire here Revelations would come from God that could not come from schools of theology that could only come through a prophetic vision and a prophetic voice which is why we needed a prophet and he says so we're right here now on the border right on the border he says right where we say to this mountain let it be so brother I desire so and so certain thing done I'm a Believer in Jesus Christ I give it to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen there's a manifestation oh brother my crops are burning out yonder I haven't had any rain I'll send you rain in the name of the Lord God bless your crops oh waiting groaning all nature waiting for the Manifest St ations of the sons of God he ordained it at the beginning he gave man the domain listen Church you know I'm trying to give you a picture here uh the prophet wasn't just expecting it all in the [Music] Millennium but for manifestations of sons of God where he would reveal himself in his people in this last day he gave Jesus Christ and Jesus gave it in his name with this assurance ask the father anything in my name and I'll do it oh brother waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God to position the church as I said the book of Ephesians the Book of Joshua Joshua placing the people where they belong and if they wouldn't stand still he put eph from here and and said he run over to Manasses land and this come back of fussing and stewing how are they ever going to get along we once said I'm Baptist I'm Methodist I'm Pentecostal I'm oness I'm tness I'm so and so how how you going to do it stand still God's wanting to place his church Sons and Daughters of God he said God let me live to see it is my prayer so close I can just feel it with my hands almost looks like it's right there it's what I long to see waiting for the time when walk down the street there lays a laying there from his mother's womb Silver and Gold Have I None oh waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God hallelujah when they'll when God will make him s known when they'll stop sickness they'll stop cancer they'll stop diseases Hallelujah man if you can't believe that now how are you going to believe it for the body change because I guarantee you it's going to stop them amen he said you think Cancer's something the Bible said there's coming a Time men were rot in there right in their flesh and the buzzer to eat off the carcasses before they even die cancer is a toothache to what's coming remember the Hot horrible thing was forbidden in that day to touch those who had the Seal of God and that's what we're striving for now to get and be positionally placed into the kingdom of God before these horrible plagues strike placed sons of people who knows their position they know how to write their check and they know what's in the bank you see this is not a picture of a weak and defeated and faithless bride but a people who war against Satan and unbelief I'm just trying to get you a little window into the prophet's expectations you know now let's turn our thoughts to the heavens for a moment to Creation to the Earth where there was no conflict no war where all was at peace and let's see where War Began because sin didn't begin on Earth it began in heaven and the war started When sin came so War began in heaven so let's turn to Ezekiel chapter 28 and verse 12 and we have we've all read this allegory of Satan it's spoken to the king of Tyrus but it's only addressing the spirit that's in the man and it's looking Way Beyond him and seeing what's anointing him and he says son of man take a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus Ezekiel 28:12 and say unto him thus sayith the Lord God thou seal us up the sum Thou Art the Seal of perfection full of wisdom and perfect in Beauty thou has been in Eden the Garden of God every precious stone was covern the Sardis topaz the diamond the Burl the onx The Jasper the sapphire the emerald and all the and the carbuncle and the gold and the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou was created Thou Art the anointed chab that coverthe thee so thou was in the Holy Mountain of God thou has walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire in other words you had access to the Holy Mountain of God and walked among the stones of fire brother Bram says it this and marriage and divorce he said did you know Satan was co-equal with God one day sure was all but a Creator he was everything he stood right at the the right hand of God stood at the right hand of God in the heavens the great leading cheram think of this as he would say again the right hand of almighty God was Lucifer the son of the morning the first God created him almost co-workers with him he was a coworker partly equal with him only Satan could not create God's the only Creator but Satan took something God created and perverted did it back into something else evil so here he was a covering cherub supposedly a protector of the of the Ark a covering chair of a a a protector of the throne no one could come into the presence of God except being challenged by the angels that protected the throne right next to God in this great esteemed place that God had created and made him and yet the Bible tells you as we read it said that that that he was perfect in all his ways a lot of people come up with this mistaken idea that God created evil so he put all his evil Parts in Satan no God didn't create evil God created things that became evil he made Satan with a ability to make choices and who knows it could have been ages in eternity cuz time was not counted that he was a faithful servant carrying out the orders helping God as his right-hand man but somewhere somewhere along the line Pride came into his heart and he began to glory in the person that he was oh Pride's an awful thing amen Pride will make you where you don't think you need God this is why people don't pray Pride will make a place where you won't even ask God for healing because you can make it on yourself Pride will come into a place where you know you will even esteem you your your own unworthiness bigger than what God can deliver you see you see again all of these things and and can play into pride and and then and Isaiah 14:12 he he ask the question how AR I fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer how did you fall son of the morning how AR you cut down to the ground which did as weak as the Nations for thou H has said in thine heart I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high yet thou shall be brought down to Hell to the sides of the pit and they that shall see thee that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee and consider thee saying is this the man that made the Earth to tremble that did shake the kingdoms that made the Earth as the world as a Wilderness that destroyed the cities thereof that open not the house of his prisoners so it shows you know here was here was was his sting you know you know hairs were his fault how did you fall he fell because of Pride he ex he exalted himself you see you know Paul says this of Satan you know when when he warned the novice the new convert said don't be like the devil for he was lifted up with pride and fell into condemnation so you see how how did he fall because of Pride and jealousy he desired to be God not just to be a servant of God oh I've seen it over over and over again I've seen men who started out in the race you know to be a person of of character a protector of the word and they were given a little congregation a people and first thing you know more is given to them and whatever and they finally get lifted up and pride where they're above the word they're above everything else they can't take correction this can happen with deacons trustees it can happen in a church it can happen in a family it can happen with a wife amen when God gave a man to be the head of the home and she will war against his headship what is it because they become lifted up with pride and because of jealousy a position and you see you see he desired to be God not just be a servant of God he said I'll sit I'll sit in the congregation I will sit in the church I'll have a church too I will be worshiped also look how great I am I'm perfect in all my ways look at what has been put into me what I have the carbuncles the gold the sapphire the diamonds all the glitter and everything to Beauty look who I am look how great I am and he follow forgot that real greatness is in humility and friends that's where our greatness is it's not because we can puff out our chest and say I'm the bride of Christ forward came before the Foundation the world you know everybody look to me no but it's in humility that we show ourselves the bride accepting his headship what he says above our own ideas exalting his word above our own thoughts about the opinions of the world about the culture that we live in while our culture we do this or that forget your culture your culture is going to hell with the rest of the culture amen there's only one culture going to make it and that's Heaven's culture and you got to be born again to be a part of that culture amen so you see again Paul Paul you know says that the devil was lifted up with pride and he fell into condemnation he began to say I will I will this is the root of all sin where I self can gets exalted over God's word well I don't think who are you to think well it's my opinion and God sent a Vindicated prophet and you want to argue with that you know why because you're too big in your own eyes you're too great you become great somebody just wrote me recently and I don't want to give the devil any recognition but he you know wrote me and you know I I knew what he wanted he sent me a whole deal on his his his thoughts I've left the message and this is why because you know Malachi 4 is not not for the bride is not to be fulfilled in the last day and there's no such thing as Elijah well all you've done is spotted out what all the theologians say and none of them have Vindication why would I listen to you I don't have a minute for that a second I'll tell you what I tell you what it went to I mean I see I I get a whole a whole package of it and I don't even open it I throw it in the trash why it's not worthy it's not worthy of my time I'll help anybody that wants to know but is I am not going to argue this message with the devil amen the message is true My Mind Is Made Up and you're not going to convince me otherwise you can have your argument they all do they have Arguments for the Trinity they have Arguments for multiple gods they got Arguments for Muhammad they got Arguments for for Buddha they got Arguments for all they oh the devil has this argument we have life that's what I say let me show you what the message does for young people let me tell you show you what it does for couples what it does with how it makes fathers real men women real ladies children real model citizens bursts them into the kingdom gives a character that is can't be compared with the world so so we see all the many statements of I will already now here's the first sin your will above God's will now Ezekiel 28 describes Satan as this exceedingly beautiful angel perhaps the highest of all the Angels the anointed cherub the most beautiful of all God's creation but not content in his position instead he desired to be God or essentially to overthrow God off his throne and take rule over the universe and Satan's purpose from Eden was to make his own Sean Eden as he walked upon Eden and looked around he thinks of what could I make out of this God has a plan and his plan is heaven to be here but I also have a plan and I will will and I will make this Earth my own kingdom and I will rule here and these hearts of men I will rule over these Hearts sir and they will worship me said well I don't worship the devil anytime you exalt yourself and others over God's word you are worshiping Satan Satan's purpose was exalt himself above the stars of God so stars of God would the sons would worship him and he's absolutely carried it out and he's done this and he brought it right into the church the Bible said he would be so successful that he would actually sit in the temple of God and be worshiped as God and and so you see he has done this by educational programs by the society around is by creating an atmosphere of unbelief that people immerse themselves in every day you have to to live here you're immersed into this Society in the opinions of this world you war against those opinions there's a fight that's going on all the time a war between what the world says and what God says and there we know that even Many religious men you know that become blind leaders of the blind blind leaders of of science then and blind leaders of the church and blind leaders of the of the Nations the blind leading the blind I know we think sometimes oh we got us some a messiah there in Washington you know God a great leader listen he's not a great leader the great leader is the Holy Ghost amen the only thing that he can lead our nation into is more ration the only hope is not in this government but of a king that is coming now Satan wanted to be God and instantly it interestly thing enough that desire is what Satan tempted Adam and Eve within the garden don't you know if you you will be as Gods knowing knowing all things so they he gets they get tempted with the same thing and because of Satan's sin God cast him out of heaven and let me just say heaven is not Satan's rightful place it is no place for the wicked one that's right amen Satan fell originally he fell because he was pushed God pushed him out and he fell and he fell to the earth now I want you to know there's an end time picture that shows where he falls again this time his fall will be permanent he'll never get back into heaven and in Revelation chapter 9 and you see he's a star that falls from heaven and he's given a key to the bottomless pit with our permission to open the bottomless pit and and release 300 million Supernatural demons to be a part of the Endtime battle to gather his host together which is what happens after Satan is cast out he brings them all together all this happens in conjunction with the coming of the Lord for after the fall of Satan and the identification of abadian apolon the king of the bottomless pit found in Revelation nine where he where he falls from heaven where he's cast down amen there is a conjunction that starts in Revelation 10 verse1 if you look at that with me for a moment Revelation 10 verse one I want you to watch the wording here and I saw notice this scripture begins with and connecting it with Revelation chapter N9 so the fall of Satan is connected with the coming of Christ hallelujah amen because as one comes for us the other falls to the Earth because heaven has to be cleansed to the accuser in order for the for the Brethren to come there amen right now watch as we look at here I saw another Mighty Angel come down so it begins connecting the two Revelation 9 and Revelation 10 together so when you read Revelation 10 is not complete without Revelation 9 there is a casting down of Satan and there is the coming down of Christ amen where Heaven is coming down is being expanded for the purpose of redemption notice now as we look it's all a part of the End Time battle it happens in conjunction with the coming of the Lord after the fall of Satan so Revelation 10 shows the continuation of the same scene so Satan was kicked out of heaven so how does he get back in well we know what he is of course he's the deceiver of course he's the serpent the old serpent from the beginning the one that deceived Eve that got the whole world in the confusion that is in of course we know all of that but he is titly is accuser of the Brethren that's what he's there for he is there as your accuser trying to keep you out of the position that Jesus paid for and it is rightly yours as a son or daughter of God so he stands between you and your sunship your full authority to resist you we know that he's accuser of the brother he shows accusing job we know he opposed Joshua the priest the high priest and zechariah's prophecy stood at his right hand to oppose him and man we know he's there you know and there was the cosmic battles in the air in the heavens hindering the answer to Daniel's prayer holding back trying to keep back the angel with the message and if it wasn't for the intercessory work of Michael he would have never got through but right now even in this age Satan and his highest ranking angels can still oppose the work of God and hinder the angels of God fighting over Heavenly positions wording off the blessings of God trying to stand between you and God and the Fulfillment of his word and promise in your life right trying to hold back the answer from you first of all let's remember the original man's rule before the fall let's remember Adam was a Son of God he was he was one who ruled over the Earth he did this from a position from a throne a dominion and we're not talking about an ivory Throne we're not talking about a Golden Throne we're not talking about a physical Throne we're talking about a position a place of dominion and this is where Adam Ruled the Earth was from from a position of sunship as a Son of God given Authority by the word of God the word had given them Dominion I want you to lose sight of that because the word is also giv you Dominion as sons of God we are to take dominion over sin over sickness over the devil we are people who are to have dominion we are to be people who who who who operate from the Heavenly Realms not the Realms of our feelings not the Realms of our emotions not the Realms of our human Spirit but the Realms where our soul is in the presence of God and there we see things as God sees and we're content with what God has in our life at this moment waiting for any change he deems possible this is what we call sunship and it's what we lost in the fall that's right because of the Fall we lost our rightful birth instead of being born right we were born wrong and we were birthed into sin and death with Satan and sin being our ruler this is why we must be born again because this this flesh this Blood this birth cannot inherit the kingdom of God we must be born again so man was made a second secondary God on the earth given power to control all things all the elements of the earth Adam was given these great Powers but then the power he was given he was given to make a choice and it was in that choice that he fell now remember Adam controlled the atmosphere he controlled the era of Eden it was one of a place of Tranquility of peace he could speak to the winds and they would obey him he could speak to the trees and they would be removed as Jesus said if you said to this tree this sacan tree saine tree be plucked up and cast in the sea it will be done even as you said Adam did that he could speak to the waters everything obeyed Adam now that was man in his Beginnings God gave him power over all the Earth but now through the fall he lost that power and he became unconscious of the fact of his of his right to Dominion because he Lo because because it's only in fellowship and relation and friendship with God and the word in the proper place does these things work so he lost that and the great channels all became clogged up even in our in where that where where it became Veil to us of of of what God really made us to be but we were created to be gods in His image to rule with Dominion Hallelujah but we were cheated out of it I want you to know we were cheated out of it that deceiver that old serpent called the devil cheated us out of our true inheritance we love lost it by not by not fairness it wasn't a fair deal that's why it's a contested book it wasn't a fair deal the devil did it was a shady deal he lied he sold Eve a bill of goods he was dishonest in the transaction and Satan's dirty hand couldn't take it and become a contested book and it goes in the hand of God and God is holding it until one a man can come that's worthy to claim it so sunship is withheld and the Power of sunship Now when God had made man he got down in the dirt and formed a and shaped a human body from clay he breathed his own life and to that man's nostrils Man became a living Soul he called the man Adam that man had a different life from that of plants and of animals he had been created in God's Own image which means he possessed an immortal Spirit like God has and he was designed to be like God to fellowship with God to reason like God to believe like God God and enjoy God forever if you're in the dolrs today if you're in Sorrows if you are in pity if you are in in in in frustration you're not in fellowship with God it's only when you're in fellowship with God that you have peace and you have contentment but when you get out of fellowship with him then you become frustrated and angry and Confused and that and Satan is casting you down and pummeling you but I want you to know that is not your heritage that's not who you ordained to be if I could whisper if I could shout in your ears today I would say you are not a defeated person you you are not meant to be controlled by depression by unbelief by doubt by fear by confusion but you have been predestined and chosen to be possessed and controlled by faith and Love and Hope Satan was kicked out of heaven so he comes down to earth he wants to be like God his loss of position didn't stop him he's more determined than ever I'll find a way back I will be like God I will have a place God's not pushing me out of heaven I'm coming back I'll rule over man that's what I'll do here he has Heaven down on Earth and a man living in heaven and operating from Heavenly places of sunship making all of life subservient to the spirit of God and there's Harmony and there's peace and the tranquility and the the lion lays down by the lamb and there's no trouble there's nothing hard to destroy in all of Eden but I will Ascend and he finds there's a susceptible creature susceptible to his thoughts and his plans that he can actually that he actually this serpent so like man so close to to man that he's almost a twined man but he lacks a soul no certain nature so Satan enters in and now this one begins to speak the voice of Satan I don't know where Adam was that day maybe in another part of the domain there had never been anything to fear before sometimes I wonder and this is maybe my human thinking but with Dominion knowing that Satan had been cast out of Heaven why didn't he cast him out of Earth but here he comes and now he finds a place in a beast and a living creature a man like being that can reason talk stands upright his seed can actually mix with man and he begins to annoy him and through his beg Godless he begins to talk Eve so here he can't create so he can't go over and just have I'll create me an earth I'll make me a earth and I'll just I'll just have Satan's eating on it I'll tell you what I I've got this plan I'm going to be God over they'll all worship me and I you know no he can't create so he begins to work on what God has to pervert the Earth and in order to pervert the Earth he perverts man so Satan's schem let's review it Isaiah 14:13 for thou has said in thine heart I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my Dominion my throne above the stars of God and this is exactly now what he does with the serpent he begins to exalt dominion over Adam's wife don't you know second Eve that's what he wants to do to you just get you to disbelieve the word and here he comes here he comes I will exalt my Dominion above the stars of God I will sit on the Mount of the congregation I will be worshiped I will Ascend above the heights of the cloud I will be like the most high I will take his place in their hearts and he came to Eve and the serpent speaks to him and suggested ah God has not really forbidden the fruit for your good I mean but he's rather he's really trying to keep good from you you see he's withholding knowledge you you know there there's things Secrets there that you don't know that only God does and he's holding you from really being like God so Eve go around what God Said and take this and you'll be as God and you know everything then that God knows you know that's our problem a lot of times we want to know the future or we want to know Wise or we want to know how comes and yet those things belong to God and to whom he will reveal it but when you start trying to figure it out and you get frustrated with God because of where you are in life because of troubles in life and you get frustrated you know you see what you are doing is exalting yourself rather than just humbling yourself to the will of God and say God you have me here and I'm going to be content where I'm at for why I'm here for this moment I don't understand it but I don't have to understand I just have to trust you and I know that everything that is not Eternal is temporal and so you know it's like I told a young girl one time that was having some trouble in her home and whatever else and and she's approaching you know life and and whatever I say well you know I know you're frustrated and I know you're having situations here that are uncomfortable and ain't good but let me just tell you it won't always be this way there's coming a change there's a light at the end of the tunnel you won't always be in this position so what do you do right now in this position act as a Christian under the duress of where you're at behave as a daughter of God as a child of God no matter how difficult it is and say Lord you trusted me with this trial I don't know when I'm coming out I just know it's temporary because is temporary trouble is temporary sin is temporary that anything outside of God is only temporary and I will be here still overcoming when all temporary things is over with and gone the lack I'm having the problem I'm going through it's only temporary the trials you're going through are temporary trials the trouble that you're going through with your health is a temporary trial one day my trials will be over there's a light at the end of the tunnel amen I see a new body headed my way I'm going to be Chang in a moment and a twinkling of eye everything ain't perfect here but I'm headed toward Perfection Hallelujah Satan came to eat even and the serpent speaks through himy suggested that God had not really forbidden it ah you'll be his God then you'll know everything we don't know everything here but then we'll know as we are known we will understand it better by and by there's a light at the end of the tunnel It won't always be this way as brother Timothy quoted and I've quoted from Brother bram's words in Mother's Day He said one day when is all over and our as we sitting around the table and tears coming down our face Maybe remembering the things we've been through the horrible Horrors bad things happen to good people you may be fatherless but you're not the only one lots have been fatherless might be motherless but you're not the only one many have been motherless you might be without a spouse but you're not the only one there's been many why is it how come and there in that moment he said he'll take his Majestic fingers and untie the knots that's all knotted up in your brain of why how come this had happen to me why why did I why did I lose a wife at 45 years of marriage how come how couldn't she couldn't be with me in my older age and where is my comfort and why where is my joy and how come and Lord what did I do and all of them things that are in your mind will be unscrambled and untied and you'll see oh oh lord it's nothing to be compared with what I have let me just forget it all and just realize Lord that in it all you proved your life in me but you see after the fall of Man are you tired I hope not you know I to follow man God drove Adam and Eve out of the garden placed a cherub to guard the entrance and Adam Eve couldn't couldn't return and eat from the Tree of Life and live forever in that cursed State God made sure they couldn't there they were forced to find their own food and shelter Adam would have to F fight weeds and thistles to eat out an existance on the ground even what he want control rebelled against him he would plant seed for weeds to come up misplaced vegetation that would have been beautiful in this setting but out of his place now because when Satan comes in there always chaos and he would take it and he would speak to it say okay you're a beautiful plant here but you're in the wrong place here you're a weed but if I put you over here you'll be right in your right place and shine in your beauty but here where I have this I want this to grow unhindered but now all nature Rebels against him Adam gave up the power of the spoken word you know why for his bride Adam was not deceived he knew what he was given up I'll give up Immortal Life I'll give up the power of the spoken word I'll give up Dominion to how Satan rule over me but I'll do it for my wife this is another Adam 2,000 years ago he gave up all the glory all of Heaven to come to Earth to take on your sin he didn't commit the sin he took your sin he bore it to Calvary he paid the price of redemption he walked out and went to hell with your sin so you wouldn't have to pay for them so you could be free Adam would go out with Eve there and as they're going out to curse people the Earth is cursed for your sake Adam even your flesh will grow thorns and thistles woman your womb will be cursed your conception will be multiplied you'll have twins you'll conceived from both The Serpent and Adam amen and in sorrow you bring forth children and pains of childbirth it won't be by the power of the spoken word it'll be with pain and groaning that should bring life into the world and man will be born of sorrow in a few days full of trouble he was grown from the time he's here to the time he leaves suffering and toil became part of the curse that God put on the world because of sin now Satan's getting into animals and they begin to kill each other Adam has no power to stop it before there was a nature rose up in the lion he was always a lion but something rose up in him and his place it down boy that's enough The Lion and the lamb would lay down together Adam had Dominion but now Adam can't stop it now chaos Reigns through the atmosphere of the air it's charged the atmosphere the air is now charged with fear faith hope the love of God which once dominated the atmosphere was now gone it had evaporated and sin now covered the Earth this episode in human history is called the fall of Man and it's because of an act of Disobedience where Adam brought a curse on every person every person that was yet to be born the man who was designed to walk with God and unbroken Fellowship had fallen from that exalted position now he was D doomed to live in a broken state in a broken World apart from from communion with God and as he goes out God says wait a minute I've cursed the ground I've cursed the womb I've expelled you from the garden but I'm going with you and I'm going to be a seed that will come through the woman and there will be a seed that will come one day and will bruise the head of this serpent there's coming an end to the rule of Satan way man his is his his reain will one day be over but the temporary Earthly consequences of sin remains even now even now we all suffer from the consequences of the fall through that one man's Sin Sin came in the world Romans 5 says as Sin entered the world through one man and death through sin and in this way death came to all people because all sin for at the many died by the trespass of one man how much more did God's grace and the gift that came by the grace of one man Jesus Christ Christ overflow to many so our Salvation comes by calling on the name of the Lord by trusting accepted and and re receiving his perfect sacrifice for our sins and receiving the life and the nature of our sacrifice Jesus Christ to us but the world today groans under the curse he crying out for Relief that will come at the altar imate Redemption of God's people when Christ returns Paul calls us the Redemption of our bodies where we'll no longer be in this cursed Earth but be changed when Jesus comes he'll restore all things he will create a new heavens and a new Earth to re renew that which sin destroyed man will no longer be fallen but he'll be restored and Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb so right now all creation groans and not only creation but we ourselves who have the first fruits of the spirit our souls are redeemed but yet we still grown inwardly as we wait e eagerly for that full and complete adoption of sons that is the Redemption of our bodies so the Bible says in Ephesians chapter 2 and you ha he made alive you has he quickened verse one who were dead in sins and trespasses where in time pass you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience among among whom we also had our own life our own conversation the way we lived in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and the mind and we by Nature the children of Wrath even as others and the and the Apostle Paul uh describes Satan now as a prince a prince with power because he has authentic power in the world first John 5:19 he says we know we are from God and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one that's the condition of the world that we live in the whole world lives in the power of the evil one his power is not only over nature to stir the atmospheres above to cause the Winds of tornadoes a horrible storm but also to cause storms and Winds of strife and disturb our own human nature not only that he owns the kingdoms of the world and and he's stirs up chaos and strife and causes great suffering all over the world why did AAS rise up against the people of God and with such Vengeance and hate and and animosity and kill little babies and women mothers with children you know the beus family and with those gorgeous little red-headed children and and just murder them why Satan has control of the world and over people and over atmospheres and he's there causing Wars and strife and Russia raises up against Ukraine and Ukraine here and and America there and this and there and all of the world is in turmoil because why Satan is the God of this of this age but he's more than that he is the prince of the power of atmospheres and where did he get this power I want to ask you where did he get it where did he get the authority to do this how did he get this rule well let's go to Luke 4 and verse 6 and I'll give you scripture and the devil said unto Jesus all this power will I give to thee and the glory of them for that is delivered to me and to whomsoever I will I will give it so now we find out where he got it was delivered to him well God didn't give it to him God gave dominion over the fish the sea the file of the air to man somebody help me preach he never gave it to the devil but who gave it to the devil man gave it to him man subjected himself to the Dominion of Satan and now he comes under the lordship of Satan and under his rule he stands between him and God and there he brings and makes and perverse what should be peace and joy and Holiness and happiness and causes Wars and contention and Evil man delivered it to him so what place did he take man's place where in Heavenly Places come on where did he take it what did he take he he's not there as a covering Angel he's there holding Adam's race from their rightful position of sunship by accusing them listen he has no weapon he was defeated at Calvary he has no legal right all he can do is accuse you I want you to understand that's all the power the devil has this morning is to accuse you somebody help me preach now amen but let me tell you Christ does not accuse you amen he has for given you and there is nothing that can separate you from the love of God through Christ Jesus Hallelujah are you with me your sins are gone they have been purged but Satan is there to remind you of your faults of your past of your of your of the things that you did things that you said thing and he Wars in your mind God will never fulfill his word to me the promises are not true God is not God he don't care about me he's left me out when hundreds of others he is blessed and he's left me out God has not left you out and God has not forgotten you God has a special place and a time he's going to bring Restoration in your life he's going to bring fulfillment in your life he said I know the plans that I have for you they are of good and not of evil to bring to you an expected end Hallelujah I could speak in other tongues if it'll help you but it wouldn't but oh as it races within my soul this morning I want you to know the accuser is there to accuse to talk you out of why you don't deserve your healing your deliverance your children if You' have done all this right if You' have kept them like this if you'd have done like that if you'd have made this decision if you'd have he's always there with the ifs and you're sitting there with the wi's and the how comes and all of this other things and why me Lord and why do you question God why do you have to know why how come you have to contest with the almighty the almighty has brought you to the place you're at he will lead you farther the season you're in it may be a springtime it may be a fall it may be a winter it may be Barren time but you won't be there forever all seasons are temporary but you are not temporary you will Outlast the winter in your life you will Outlast the barness you will be here shouting the glory when all of the ages is over you are not a temporal being you are an eternal being [Applause] yes he's a Tormentor says in Luke at 13:16 about a woman a daughter of Abraham that Satan is bound these 18 years that he came to loose he's a Tormentor he gets in sickness he comes as a thorn as an illness as Paul said it come a thorn in my flesh where did we get a thorn in our flesh came from the fall you may be young and healthy this morning your muscles look like Hercules you may be young and vibrant able but it won't be many years and you'll be stooped and tottery and big giant men that once were football players and run it down and was a running star and everybody cheering us now can't get up out of the chair Thorns will grow your body will grow thistles and you I have a messenger of Satan to Buffet you time on time again so brother Tim we believe in Divine Healing that's only temporary Divine Healing is not Eternal Health it's not Divine Health you get sick healed sick again you'll come to church or wherever your faith will cast him out but he'll come again cuz your body is under a curse right and it'll even happen till one day in this flesh you will fight your last battle someone will close your eyes in death and plant you as a seed in a sun God but if you're germinated to life that's only temporary cuz there's coming a springtime the season will change and I tell you we are right here in the changing of the seasons amen no matter how we're buffeted by the prince of the power of the air and how much the atmospheres around us are charged with demon powers let me tell you something something friends we were not commanded to live

press it against the enemy you do not have to let him control the air between you and God you will meet him in the air one day and the air has to be CLE between you and God where angels are ascending

that you must cast down and reasoning that you must pull down and that the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal but they are spiritual then they are Mighty through God through the pulling town of
