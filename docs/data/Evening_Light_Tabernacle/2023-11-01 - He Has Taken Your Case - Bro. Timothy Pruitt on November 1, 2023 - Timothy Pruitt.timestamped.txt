[41:20] Lamentations 3 and verse 55 said I
[41:23] called upon thy name oh Lord out of the
[41:25] low dust dungeon and thou has heard my
[41:28] voice hide not thine ear to my breathing
[41:31] at My Cry thou drwest near in the day
[41:34] that I called upon thee and thou said us
[41:37] fear not oh Lord thou has pleaded the
[41:40] causes of my soul and thou Hast redeemed
[41:43] my life I want to read that verse in the
[41:45] Amplified it says oh Lord you have
[41:48] pleaded my soul's cause you have guided
[41:51] my way and protected me and you have
[41:54] rescued and redeemed my life life oh
[41:57] Lord thou H has seen my wrong judge thou
[42:00] my cause thou has seen all their
[42:02] Vengeance and all their imaginations
[42:04] against me thou has heard their reproach
[42:06] oh Lord and all their imaginations
[42:08] against me the lips of those that rose
[42:11] up against me and their device against
[42:13] me all the day behold their sitting down
[42:17] and their rising up I am their music I
[42:20] want read that also in the Amplified
[42:22] says look at their sitting and their
[42:24] Rising their actions and secret counsels
[42:28] I am their mocking song or the subject
[42:31] of their ridicule but Render unto them a
[42:34] recompense oh Lord according to the
[42:36] works of their hands give them sorrow of
[42:39] heart and thy curse unto them persecute
[42:42] and Destroy them in Anger from under the
[42:45] heavens of the Lord also John chap 14
[42:48] and verse
[42:50] 16 said I will pray the father and he
[42:52] shall give you another comforter that he
[42:55] may abide with you you forever even the
[42:57] spirit of Truth in the world world
[42:59] cannot receive because it seeth him not
[43:02] neither knoweth him but you know him for
[43:05] he dwelleth with you and shall be in you
[43:08] and I will not leave you comfortless but
[43:10] I will come to you amen well let you be
[43:17] seated
[43:19] um kind of kind of still in between here
[43:23] in Europe somewhere I haven't caught up
[43:25] with myself so
[43:27] uh just got in last night about midnight
[43:29] and bed about 1:00 and got up this
[43:32] morning but we're here to serve the Lord
[43:34] and we're thankful to be in his service
[43:37] amen this time that we're living in
[43:38] we're living in a crazy time but it's
[43:41] also a wonderful time amen I like how
[43:44] brother Brandon put it he said we're
[43:45] living in a very terrible time and he
[43:48] said but a terrible time for the
[43:50] unbeliever he said but it's the most
[43:52] wonderful time for a Believer because
[43:54] we're right at the coming of the Lord
[43:56] and I I believe that with all my heart I
[43:59] I actually spoke this for the first time
[44:01] with at those tent meetings at brother
[44:02] Matt Morris's and the Lord put this on
[44:05] my heart so you kind of get in the
[44:07] reverse side of things normally you
[44:09] speak things at your home church and go
[44:11] out and minister to uh Minister there
[44:13] but I I would like to speak to you on he
[44:16] has taken your case he has taken your
[44:19] case I I was looking at the scripture in
[44:21] John chapter 14 and he says I'll give
[44:24] you another comforter this comforter in
[44:27] the King James Bible it means helper or
[44:31] Advocate it means someone who is
[44:33] summoned and called to one side in order
[44:37] to help you someone who pleads another
[44:39] cause before a judge it's a counsel for
[44:43] defense for the defense or a legal
[44:45] assistant an advocate or intercessor job
[44:49] would find this and he would speak about
[44:51] him in Job chapter 16 and verse 19 it
[44:54] said even now behold my wit witness that
[44:56] is in heaven and my Advocate who vouches
[45:00] and testifies for me on high 1 John 2
[45:04] and verse one would say it like this my
[45:05] little children these things write unto
[45:07] you that you sin not if any man sin we
[45:10] have an advocate with the father Jesus
[45:13] Christ the righteous he is the propit
[45:15] for our sins and not for ours only but
[45:18] also for the sins of the whole world you
[45:21] know I I was looking at this thought
[45:23] upon the advocate and how God is taken
[45:26] our case and and I'm I'm thankful today
[45:29] that he's taken our case that he's not
[45:32] just allowed it to just go on and and
[45:34] the time to just T it's for a reason and
[45:37] for a purpose and but God is actually
[45:39] advocating or uh standing on our side
[45:43] and on our behalf even now amen before
[45:46] the father and so I I I was looking at a
[45:48] quote brother Brown said God took me in
[45:51] and now I'm his child and he and look
[45:54] what he's done for us look what he is is
[45:56] for us in his riches he in his riches he
[45:58] became poor that in his poverty we might
[46:02] become rich and in his immortality he
[46:05] became flesh that he might take on our
[46:08] sickness that is his sickness might that
[46:11] in his sickness we might have health and
[46:14] all my sins he was sinless and but he
[46:17] took my sins that I might become sinless
[46:20] he became me that I might become him in
[46:23] heaven and he stands at mine and your
[46:26] representative then God doesn't look to
[46:29] us or look at us he looks at our
[46:32] representative Christ that is standing
[46:34] there in our stad representing us before
[46:37] the father he said you know if you ever
[46:39] had a court trial you would get a
[46:41] representative and he would stand before
[46:43] you as an attorney and he would plead
[46:45] your cause who knows how to do it any
[46:48] better than he does when he was the very
[46:50] son of the father standing in the
[46:52] presence of God to plead the sinner's
[46:55] case if we we confess being rich yet he
[46:58] became poor that through his poverty we
[47:00] might become rich rich in what money no
[47:04] rich in Heavenly blessings rich in
[47:06] spiritual things we who are once poor
[47:09] now become rich through his poverty he
[47:11] stripped himself he IM he he humiliated
[47:14] himself he came down the Great Divine
[47:17] one from above in humiliation came down
[47:20] and brought himself down humbled himself
[47:22] into a body of Flesh to walk among men
[47:25] hearing the cursing and the swearing of
[47:27] men feeling the Pains of sickness and of
[47:30] death and upon himself that through it
[47:32] all that not because he had to but
[47:34] because love brought him to it and he
[47:37] done all of that and became sick and had
[47:40] trouble you say he was sick certainly he
[47:42] was sick didn't he make his own thing in
[47:44] himself when he made a statement he said
[47:46] won't they say to me physician heal
[47:48] yourself sure he bore our sicknesses he
[47:51] bore our griefs and he bore our sorrows
[47:55] and he bore our sins amen why because he
[47:58] is now standing as our advocate he knows
[48:01] what it's like to be sick he knows what
[48:03] it's like to have griefs he he knows
[48:06] what it's like to have uh to come
[48:07] against sin and different thoughts and
[48:09] sorrows and all of that and but so
[48:12] therefore he would if he didn't know
[48:13] what it was like he wouldn't know how to
[48:15] represent you he wouldn't know how to be
[48:17] an advocate for you he wouldn't know how
[48:19] to how to stand there and plead your
[48:21] case and to plead your cause cuz if
[48:23] somebody's never been through what
[48:25] you've been through they can't tell you
[48:27] what it's like to go what you go through
[48:29] what you're went going through amen but
[48:31] somebody that's been there somebody
[48:33] that's walk in those same places and
[48:35] those same footsteps they know how to be
[48:37] an advocate for you they know how to
[48:39] stand for you they and if somebody's got
[48:41] really you you and their you and their
[48:43] best interest or or or you know you on
[48:45] their heart they'll stand there and
[48:47] they'll plead their your cause they'll
[48:50] they'll hold you before whatever they're
[48:52] going through and plead the cause you
[48:54] know if you had committed a crime and
[48:56] you were going to be tried in a court
[48:58] you know that you would F that you if
[49:00] you were found guilty you were going to
[49:02] die you're going to an electric chair or
[49:05] to a gas chamber or some public educa
[49:08] execution and you were going to have be
[49:10] hung or something lynched whatever the
[49:13] penalty was and you knew you were guilty
[49:16] you knew you must die but if you don't
[49:18] get some good attorney to represent you
[49:21] you was not there was not going to be a
[49:23] way out of it but so you would want the
[49:25] best that you could
[49:27] get amen you wouldn't want somebody
[49:29] didn't know a lick about nothing that
[49:31] never want a case that never never got
[49:33] anybody you want the best that you could
[49:35] get and you would be willing to pay all
[49:38] that you could to get that person and so
[49:40] you'd want somebody that could stand
[49:42] there and could plead your case and he
[49:44] could look at the laws and he could
[49:46] dissect it and he could find a way that
[49:49] you would not have to die but he could
[49:51] find a way with a judge or find a way
[49:53] with a jury somehow that you you could
[49:55] live and you would want the very best
[49:57] that you could get and if you would even
[49:59] find this person you could get the most
[50:01] money somebody give you a great big
[50:03] donation to get the best and the best
[50:05] one that hardly maybe never lost a case
[50:08] or or been there and got people out of
[50:10] worst trouble that you had been in it
[50:12] would still be a question in your mind
[50:14] there would still be something there
[50:16] that wondering if he could really do
[50:18] what he says he could do if he he could
[50:21] really change the jury's mind or or the
[50:23] judge judge's idea about you and through
[50:26] his speaking and knowing all the laws
[50:28] and if he could change it if he could
[50:30] really plead it if he could really prove
[50:32] it that you would live and yet and all
[50:35] of his great Authority and his great
[50:36] speech that he can make and The
[50:38] Impressions he could put upon the jury
[50:40] and upon the judge and and you know
[50:43] maybe maybe you could relax a few
[50:45] minutes but still there would be a
[50:47] question in your mind can he do it can
[50:50] he do it can he can he really change the
[50:53] judge's mind can he can he move the jury
[50:55] just enough to that I don't have to go
[50:58] to a to an electric chair or to a
[51:00] hanging or but in but in this case but

[51:19] like to go through sickness and know
[51:20] what it's like to go through sin and
[51:22] know what it's like to go through
[51:24] trouble amen and and you don't have to

[54:29] control come on somebody I'm here to
[54:32] tell you death has no control death is
[54:35] only a doorway to step into another
[54:38] dimension death does not control Our
[54:40] Lives death has already been
[54:44] defeated hallelujah amen our our
[54:47] Advocate our judge came and took on
[54:50] death himself and he put it under his
[54:52] feet therefore death has no fear fear in
[54:55] it to a Believer death has no control
[54:58] over
[54:59] us death does not determine the day that
[55:02] we
[55:05] die Hallelujah the token is applied it
[55:09] has no control the token is Recon
[55:12] recognized he he did that so the token
[55:14] would come he gave his own life God's
[55:17] life was given out God came down and he
[55:20] says he says he he came down to take on
[55:23] our sins he came to become one of us
[55:26] that's a real
[55:27] lamb that would become one of us it's
[55:30] his purpose he had in his mind that's
[55:33] the reason the lamb was
[55:35] identified Amen in the Garden of Eden
[55:38] knowing that that that sooner or later
[55:41] many thousands of years later there was
[55:43] going to be the Lamb of God that would
[55:45] come amen and so he put that lamb and he
[55:48] ripped off that skin and he throwed it
[55:50] on Adam and Eve why because it was their
[55:52] stand between or their go between
[55:54] between the there's sin and between God
[55:56] but we know the Bible teaches and the
[55:58] and the prophet of God teaches that the
[56:00] life of that lamb could not come back
[56:03] upon the believer therefore David he
[56:05] would plead his case and Lord I've
[56:07] sinned against you create in me a clean
[56:09] heart renew a right spirit in me but and
[56:12] God would forgive him but he would still
[56:14] have that desire he would still have
[56:16] that that want that lust or whatever it
[56:18] was in his life but when this lamb came
[56:21] this judge became our attorney and he
[56:24] wiped away the case and he said it is
[56:27] finished it is over with death has no
[56:29] more power sin has no more power amen
[56:33] sickness has no more
[56:35] power amen sickness does not determine
[56:39] the day you
[56:43] die it has no it has no control it has
[56:47] no power in
[56:49] it Hallelujah when we can realize our
[56:52] enemy has lost his power
[56:55] it it has no power to determine if I
[56:58] breathe another breath or I Live Another
[57:01] Day it has no power it has lost its
[57:04] power I'm here to tell you cancer has
[57:07] lost its
[57:08] power every disease has lost his power
[57:12] every sin has lost his power it has it
[57:15] cannot control your life any longer it
[57:18] cannot control your ways no longer he
[57:20] cannot determine how long you live he
[57:22] cannot determine nothing about you the
[57:25] one in control the judge has become your
[57:28] attorney and he's standing there
[57:30] pleading your
[57:31] [Applause]
[57:37] cause Hallelujah the holy spirit is our
[57:40] Advocate as a token that's over the
[57:43] door saying the price has been paid that
[57:47] when the death angel comes it looks and
[57:49] sees the blood and says I can't enter in
[57:53] there
[57:56] Hallelujah therefore when you receive
[57:58] the Holy Ghost you've passed from Death
[58:01] To
[58:03] Life come on now you passed from Death
[58:07] to life that's what the token is showing
[58:09] you're This Old Man
[58:12] Died death you're too late I've already
[58:16] died amen this old man died and a new
[58:20] man lives that cannot
[58:22] die oh you can put in a grave somewhere
[58:26] but what's on the inside of me cannot
[58:29] die Hallelujah but on that Resurrection
[58:32] morning it's going to come up out of
[58:34] that
[58:36] grave come on somebody therefore death
[58:39] does not decree how long you live amen
[58:42] sickness does not decree how long you
[58:44] can live it has no
[58:49] control takes the fear out of
[58:52] it when you realize it has no control it
[58:56] has nothing no power to do anything amen
[58:59] the Lord determines what day I live and
[59:01] what day I
[59:03] die amen he's the one in control a token
[59:07] is a sign the price has been paid it's

[1:01:29] off and those that have been ordained to
[1:01:31] a seat will be on there
[1:01:35] hallelujah
[1:01:36] hallelujah the life came from the
[1:01:41] sacrifice and now the blood was a token
[1:01:43] and orders his orders had been carried
[1:01:45] out the
[1:01:48] blood so it was showing that when I see
[1:01:51] the blood I know the death price has
[1:01:53] been made and I'll pass over you the
[1:01:56] believing worshipper was identified with
[1:01:58] his Sacrifice by the token that it was
[1:02:01] done the worshipper who believed Jehovah
[1:02:03] had met Jehovah's requirements had
[1:02:05] identified himself by applying the token
[1:02:07] to himself and to his house that was the
[1:02:09] worshipper that
[1:02:12] believed it's a perfect T type of Christ
[1:02:15] today the blood was a token of
[1:02:18] identification that this believer has
[1:02:20] already made and met Jehovah's
[1:02:23] requirement I'm sure the death angel
[1:02:25] will have to pass from my house because
[1:02:27] I've met Jehovah's token I've met his
[1:02:29] requirement a lamb has in has died
[1:02:32] instead of me and he died for my family
[1:02:34] and for my loved ones that's under this
[1:02:36] blood and there is a token that the lamb
[1:02:39] is dead it is finish and then is so he
[1:02:41] said when I think of that my heart jumps
[1:02:43] for Joy now that animal life could not
[1:02:46] come back upon the believer so the
[1:02:48] therefore the blood had to stand for the
[1:02:50] token the blood wrapped up in the animal
[1:02:53] which started with a single sell and is
[1:02:55] shed when that animal's blood was shed
[1:02:57] but that life could not come back so the
[1:02:59] blood had to stand for a token of death
[1:03:03] he said but now we have a token in this
[1:03:05] day that was a natural now we have a
[1:03:08] supernatural Supreme token and it's the
[1:03:11] holy spirit that stands over our life
[1:03:14] that's our Advocate that stands for us
[1:03:17] that comes Upon Our need that comes upon
[1:03:20] our behalf and when we call he will
[1:03:23] answer
[1:03:24] yes
[1:03:26] inde it's a token it's
[1:03:29] identification that is finished that
[1:03:31] it's over with that is
[1:03:34] done and he so goes on he says therefore
[1:03:37] we also have to identify ourself with
[1:03:40] our sacrifice we have to identify in his
[1:03:44] death when the Jews placed his hand upon
[1:03:46] the sacrifice he was identify himself
[1:03:49] transfering his sins to his sacrifice
[1:03:51] now we place our hands by faith upon the
[1:03:54] Lord Jesus Christ and are identifi and
[1:03:57] are identified with him in his death not
[1:03:59] only in his death but we're identified
[1:04:01] in his death but also in his
[1:04:03] resurrection by the life that was in him
[1:04:06] is now coming to the believer as a token
[1:04:08] a memorial that we have passed from
[1:04:11] Death unto
[1:04:17] life he said I know it works I know it's
[1:04:22] true I've tried it Hallelujah there is
[1:04:25] no other ISM no other workup no other
[1:04:28] schemes no gimmicks no nothing it's the
[1:04:31] word of God Amen that God requires and
[1:04:35] there's nothing we can do to save
[1:04:37] ourselves it's only what he has already
[1:04:40] done and if the lamb is accepted we are
[1:04:43] also
[1:04:45] accepted so the lamb laying upon the
[1:04:47] altar was an advocate it was a goete it
[1:04:51] was a a answer between a sin that it
[1:04:54] taking place and God was not looking at
[1:04:56] the worshipper God was looking at the
[1:04:59] lamb and if the lamb was perfect and
[1:05:02] accepted then if the lamb was accepted
[1:05:04] then the worshipper was also accepted
[1:05:07] Hallelujah and we know our lamb was
[1:05:10] accepted he laid himself down and he
[1:05:13] said it is finished sir it is over with
[1:05:17] it is done what was he saying the price
[1:05:19] is
[1:05:21] paid when he said that stat and it is
[1:05:24] finished I want you to understand when
[1:05:26] he said finished that means sin was
[1:05:29] finished sickness was finished death was
[1:05:32] finished every sin that could ever be
[1:05:35] imputed to man was
[1:05:39] finished all they had to accept was The
[1:05:42] Works been done and I accept the life
[1:05:45] over me and in me to guide me and to
[1:05:49] Lead Me There is the gospel amen it
[1:05:52] wasn't just a chemical blood but but the
[1:05:54] spirit of that blood to come back you
[1:05:56] know we was actually in where was that
[1:05:58] in brouge Belgium and they have a cath
[1:06:01] you know Catholics everywhere over there
[1:06:02] but
[1:06:04] anyway try to get you to pay for
[1:06:07] everything you know they say they
[1:06:09] literally have a in this certain church
[1:06:12] I I didn't pay to go in there and see it
[1:06:14] cuz Frank Frankly I don't believe it but
[1:06:17] anyway they said they have a actual a
[1:06:18] little vessel of the actual blood of
[1:06:20] Jesus Christ and they charge you to look
[1:06:23] at it thought well ain't that ain't that
[1:06:26] a a paradox or what is it what's the
[1:06:28] word I'm looking for a different word
[1:06:30] oxymoron that sounds about right bunch
[1:06:32] of
[1:06:35] morons Lord help me I told you I told
[1:06:38] somebody I'm not responsible for

[1:06:46] had this this little Cruise they said
[1:06:48] and they they actually March up and down
[1:06:50] the streets with it and people bowing
[1:06:52] and kneeling and over this little bit of
[1:06:54] ounce of blood paying money to to go
[1:06:57] look at it and look put the and and who
[1:07:00] knows it might be Lamb's blood it it
[1:07:02] might be Dogs blood I don't know what
[1:07:03] kind of blood it is but I know the blood
[1:07:06] that was shed for me was without
[1:07:10] price it was the price it paid the price
[1:07:16] it paid it all it paid for every sin it
[1:07:20] paid for every doubt it paid for every
[1:07:22] mind battle it paid for for every

[1:13:13] you're not of the world our judge and
[1:13:15] our attorney the same person so the case
[1:13:18] is settled the case was so great against
[1:13:22] us the case that we had seen was so
[1:13:25] great against us that not even an
[1:13:27] archangel could plead it he couldn't do
[1:13:29] it he could there wasn't enough
[1:13:32] Lambs there wasn't enough enough animals
[1:13:34] in the whole earth that could take away
[1:13:36] our sin he could not meet the
[1:13:38] requirement No Angel no cheram no sarpam
[1:13:42] nothing can meet the price the only
[1:13:44] thing that could be done to save the Jud
[1:13:47] the human race was the judge come and
[1:13:50] take their place and become their
[1:13:52] eternity and that's exactly what he's
[1:13:54] done it is
[1:14:01] finished
[1:14:03] Hallelujah that's exactly what happened
[1:14:05] that was the judge that spoke there on
[1:14:07] the cross and said it is
[1:14:10] finished it's done it's
[1:14:17] over I've shed the blood Satan you lost
[1:14:22] again you're lost again if Satan would
[1:14:26] have
[1:14:27] knew what the shedding of that blood
[1:14:29] would
[1:14:30] do he would not let him fall down and
[1:14:33] scrape his
[1:14:34] knee he'd have moved every
[1:14:37] Rock he'd have put padding down
[1:14:40] everywhere cuz if that blood is shed
[1:14:42] it's over with but that dumb devil
[1:14:45] didn't realize he thought surely if this
[1:14:48] would be God he could do this and that
[1:14:49] be dumb devil if it was God he would
[1:14:53] have come come out of the heavens and he
[1:14:54] would had a trumpet salute he's going to
[1:14:57] but he had a trumpet salute and he would
[1:14:58] come down roll the red carpet walk right
[1:15:00] down into Caiaphas Temple there and say
[1:15:03] here I
[1:15:04] am but I just can't believe cuz he knew
[1:15:08] how great this God
[1:15:10] was he' been before him he knew what he
[1:15:13] been he worshiped him for millions and
[1:15:15] millions of years he knew what the
[1:15:17] greatness of this God how could a God so
[1:15:20] great become that about it but if he had
[1:15:23] have known he would not have let that
[1:15:25] blood not he wouldn't have let him have
[1:15:27] a split
[1:15:30] nail nothing he' have tried to preserve
[1:15:33] it tried to hold it try to keep it as
[1:15:35] long as he could but he was so
[1:15:38] fooled I can't be
[1:15:41] him you got to be just like Elijah or
[1:15:44] one of them others I took them down I'll
[1:15:45] take him down too but that bee be to
[1:15:48] whirl around that
[1:15:50] cross it stung Elijah and and done his
[1:15:54] job it has stung all the prophets and
[1:15:56] done his job but here he comes around
[1:15:57] this one and he
[1:16:00] says it is
[1:16:04] finished be was laughing I did it
[1:16:09] again why can't I get
[1:16:12] loose I got
[1:16:14] more and it ripped a stinger
[1:16:21] out Christ's death did just change you
[1:16:24] it changed the devil
[1:16:27] forever he lost his power he lost his
[1:16:31] ability he lost his his Mo his his
[1:16:33] moments of Fame he lost it all right
[1:16:37] there and the judge said it's
[1:16:41] finished why did he say it then so you
[1:16:44] would never have to hear it
[1:16:47] now you don't want him to look at you
[1:16:50] and say it's finished going to hell
[1:16:52] forever what you don't want that
[1:16:54] judgment so he made that judgment then
[1:16:57] but it wasn't against you it was against
[1:16:59] your
[1:17:01] enemy ain't that amazing what could you
[1:17:03] imagine a guy that would have such a
[1:17:05] case that he thought man I'm going to
[1:17:06] win this and I'm going to win millions
[1:17:08] of dollars and I'm going to I'm going to
[1:17:09] S suit and it's going to be over with
[1:17:11] and he had such a case that was so well
[1:17:13] built and so done and thought man I got
[1:17:15] it wrapped up it's over with it's fin
[1:17:17] they're going like they're going to hell
[1:17:18] like the rest of them but all of a
[1:17:20] sudden the judge takes off his coat
[1:17:23] and he steps down and becomes the
[1:17:25] attorney and he begins to plead the case
[1:17:28] and he begins to plead the cause and he
[1:17:30] said is
[1:17:32] done it's
[1:17:34] finished it's over with there's no more
[1:17:38] case to
[1:17:39] [Music]
[1:17:41] it Hallelujah you owe Millions you
[1:17:44] couldn't pay it all it was impossible to
[1:17:46] pay for your sin it was impossible to
[1:17:48] add it all up and to have enough to pay
[1:17:51] for it but you didn't have to
[1:17:54] he came and he wrote over it it is
[1:17:58] done it's
[1:18:03] finished so what is there to
[1:18:08] fear I'll take a drink of water on that
[1:18:13] one
[1:18:15] what what is there to
[1:18:20] fear
[1:18:21] cancer no it's finished on sins nope
[1:18:28] finished sickness nope
[1:18:31] finished death nope finished Satan
[1:18:35] himself nope
[1:18:41] finished what is it what you dealing
[1:18:44] with it ain't nothing to
[1:18:49] fear what is there to fear the judgment
[1:18:52] that should have been yours fell upon
[1:18:55] him at the cross and at the grave when
[1:18:58] he descended was for us everything he
[1:19:00] done was for he absorbed the full brunt
[1:19:03] of the wound of sin there is now for
[1:19:05] therefore no condemnation to them which
[1:19:07] are in Christ Jesus for
[1:19:10] shity our attorney is our judge he's
[1:19:14] both attorney and judge the judge as
[1:19:17] judge the case is
[1:19:20] settled it is finished therefore there
[1:19:23] is now no
[1:19:26] condemnation man if we can strip the
[1:19:28] condemnation over off of people's lives
[1:19:30] and they realize the price is already
[1:19:32] paid you don't have to carry that no
[1:19:36] more you don't have to carry that past
[1:19:38] stuff and that nonsense of your life if
[1:19:40] you've asked for forgiveness it's over

[1:21:07] what he said I can be I can rise above
[1:21:10] where I
[1:21:15] am what you need to do is to start using
[1:21:18] that stuff that's holding you down and
[1:21:20] throw it down and use it something to
[1:21:22] step on to get up
[1:21:25] higher not push you down but pick you up

[1:21:44] nothing we're not talking about somebody
[1:21:47] that don't know any everything you know
[1:21:49] I understand sure yeah I'm sure there's
[1:21:51] children in here that took took a
[1:21:52] whooping that you didn't actually
[1:21:53] deserve but I can promise you you got a
[1:21:55] lot of things you did deserve more for
[1:21:57] that you didn't
[1:21:59] get but we're not talking about parents
[1:22:01] that don't know all everything and
[1:22:03] exactly how it all happened they're
[1:22:05] trying by the goodness of their mind and
[1:22:07] heart and trying to decipher what's
[1:22:09] really true what's really wrong and
[1:22:10] decide whether you need a whooping or
[1:22:12] not but most time you needed it
[1:22:13] regardless anyhow sir but we're talking
[1:22:16] about a God who knows all
[1:22:19] things we're talking about a God who
[1:22:21] knows every blink of every Nat's eye he
[1:22:24] knows everything so but why should we
[1:22:26] feel punish fear punishment when we
[1:22:28] ain't done anything in his
[1:22:31] sight when you ask for forgiveness it's
[1:22:33] over
[1:22:35] with so leave it there at the altar
[1:22:38] don't pick it up again don't pick up
[1:22:40] your past mistakes don't pick up your
[1:22:42] past failures and your past this quit
[1:22:45] quit worrying about the
[1:22:47] past too many people let the future be
[1:22:50] run by the past
[1:22:55] that was
[1:22:56] good amen preach it yeah I'm going do
[1:22:59] that brother somebody does preach it too
[1:23:02] many people let the past they let the
[1:23:05] past failures and the past mistakes ruin
[1:23:07] so much of their present and their
[1:23:10] future they allow things that happen
[1:23:13] back there to become such a thing right
[1:23:14] now and they care it and care it and
[1:23:16] you're not careful you're going to pass
[1:23:17] it from one generation to another
[1:23:18] generation to another generation but
[1:23:20] somebody got to break the cycle somebody
[1:23:23] got to realize I ain't got to fear this
[1:23:24] no more it's
[1:23:26] finished my past is over with my past
[1:23:31] sins have been paid for and in the blood
[1:23:33] of the
[1:23:38] Lamb it's not that you want your debt
[1:23:41] cleared so you can go make more debt no
[1:23:43] the life has been
[1:23:44] changed I love how brother Tim uses that
[1:23:47] analogy about a rich man come and pay
[1:23:49] off all your debt so that's all fine and
[1:23:51] dandy but you can go out make new
[1:23:53] debts and this man here he knows how to
[1:23:56] how to operate with money and save money
[1:23:58] and do things and he comes and he out of
[1:24:00] the goodness of his heart pays off
[1:24:01] everything you can go make more
[1:24:03] debts this is what happens with people
[1:24:06] they do come and they ask for
[1:24:07] forgiveness but they don't get the life
[1:24:09] of the man who paid off his
[1:24:11] debts you got to have his life and then
[1:24:14] you'll have his you'll have his
[1:24:17] ways Hallelujah you have you you'll have
[1:24:20] his ability to balance your checkbook
[1:24:22] and to keep it in the
[1:24:24] positive come on somebody amen too many
[1:24:27] people are always in the red in the
[1:24:28] negative I'm talking about another thing
[1:24:30] more than your natural checkbook right
[1:24:32] now I'm talking about your life yes sir
[1:24:34] always in the negative it's always
[1:24:36] negative this that and the other amen
[1:24:38] it's time that you get the life of Jesus
[1:24:40] Christ he'll move you from the negative
[1:24:42] into the
[1:24:45] positive Hallelujah so why should we
[1:24:47] fear punishment or death it's all been
[1:24:50] overcome here's the one who came been
[1:24:52] conquered both World seen and
[1:24:56] unseen Hallelujah so everything you can
[1:24:58] see with these natural eyes is
[1:25:01] conquered it's finished it's done it's
[1:25:04] over with amen everything that you
[1:25:05] cannot see with these eyes but you can
[1:25:07] see with some spiritual eyesight it's
[1:25:11] conquered it's done it's finished he
[1:25:13] said not like Napoleon who conquered all
[1:25:15] of Europe but was finally defeated at
[1:25:17] waterl and he only only to find himself
[1:25:21] conquered
[1:25:23] he was banished to a prison himself I
[1:25:25] actually visited his tomb he's
[1:25:30] dead yep he's
[1:25:32] dead killed a lot of people but he died
[1:25:36] too tried to conquer the world got all
[1:25:39] caught up in his
[1:25:41] arrogance lost got banished to jail a
[1:25:45] defeated
[1:25:47] person and I looked at his Shrine it was
[1:25:50] huge taller than this place
[1:25:53] just Beauty Beyond
[1:25:55] imagination and this big old huge casket
[1:25:58] sitting down in this hole I was looking
[1:26:00] at I like yep you're
[1:26:03] dead what good did all that do for
[1:26:06] you I bet you would come back and want
[1:26:08] to rewrite some things I was having a
[1:26:11] conversation whether he was listening or
[1:26:13] not I bet you'd want to redo a few
[1:26:15] things in your life all this monuments
[1:26:18] built to you probably ain't worth what

[1:26:24] what I've walked through and all your

[1:26:28] that I bet You' try to come back and
[1:26:29] change some things right now if you
[1:26:33] could that was that a guy Alexander
[1:26:35] another guy conquered the world the
[1:26:37] known world but
[1:26:40] lost but nothing can conquer
[1:26:46] Christ he that descended has now
[1:26:48] ascended above all and unto him has been
[1:26:50] given a name that's above every name he
[1:26:53] conquered death he conquered hell he
[1:26:55] conquered the grave and as the keys
[1:26:57] thereof what he looses is loose and what
[1:27:00] he binds is bound and there's no
[1:27:02] changing of it there's no conquer before
[1:27:05] him and there's none beside him he alone
[1:27:07] is savior Redeemer and he's the only God
[1:27:10] in the Lord Jesus Christ is his name

[1:31:43] is take it up to the bank and see if it
[1:31:46] won't
[1:31:50] cash we know we know the the story of
[1:31:53] Abraham Lincoln that wrote out a pardon
[1:31:55] for a man that was doomed to a firing
[1:31:58] squad and his friend
[1:32:00] coming interceded and on his behalf and
[1:32:02] said my friend he didn't mean to do what
[1:32:04] he did and Abraham Lincoln was moved and
[1:32:07] he wrote out a pardon just on a little
[1:32:08] piece of paper and wrote his name on
[1:32:11] Abraham Lincoln this
[1:32:13] friend came back to the place where his
[1:32:16] where his b buddy was in the jail and he
[1:32:19] said look I got you pardon it's finished
[1:32:21] it's over with is done the man refused
[1:32:24] it because it wasn't maybe on the right
[1:32:27] kind of paper he thought or couldn't be
[1:32:29] a possible and refused a written out
[1:32:32] pardon by Abraham Lincoln and he goes
[1:32:34] and dies at a fire and
[1:32:36] Squad and they come
[1:32:39] out of the the with a judgment that said
[1:32:42] a pardon is only a pardon if it's
[1:32:45] accepted as a
[1:32:47] pardon the checkbook is only a checkbook
[1:32:50] if you act like it's a checkbook
[1:32:52] if you're willing to look into it and
[1:32:54] say God I have a need it's done it's
[1:32:58] finished cuz you have unlimited
[1:33:01] resources I don't have to fear this
[1:33:03] because you're here with me I don't have
[1:33:06] to worry about it because you're in
[1:33:07] control I don't have to look at it and
[1:33:09] worry how it's all going to work out I
[1:33:11] just know it's going to work out because
[1:33:13] you said it
[1:33:15] would and you accept it of How It's been
[1:33:17] done many times people look at things
[1:33:19] and say Well it don't come the way I
[1:33:21] thought it would come it well if it
[1:33:23] comes just accept
[1:33:25] it it can come in a little little
[1:33:27] package you know a little little man of
[1:33:30] short statue or tall statue or big
[1:33:33] statue or
[1:33:34] whatever but when God speaks something
[1:33:37] if you look at and say hey that's for
[1:33:39] me and you accept it as a pardon or as a
[1:33:43] need being fulfilled or or a desire then
[1:33:46] God will fulfill it it'll be
[1:33:50] done he he said
[1:33:52] tonight I read that God gives us all
[1:33:56] things he gives us a pardon it's a
[1:33:59] pardon to those who wants to accept
[1:34:01] God's word as a
[1:34:03] pardon just to read it doesn't mean
[1:34:06] you're pardon just to look at it does
[1:34:08] not mean you're pardon it means you have
[1:34:11] to accept it as your pardon that God had
[1:34:14] gave his son to die in your stad then
[1:34:17] it's a pardon then it's finished then
[1:34:20] you're released from the guilt a pardon
[1:34:22] from God is a release from the guilt not
[1:34:25] the Turning Away by psychology a PS
[1:34:28] psychological doctrine of some sort is
[1:34:30] to give you or give you a little feeling
[1:34:32] that you don't have what's right by
[1:34:33] joining a church or taking a c it's a
[1:34:35] release from your guilt by the power of
[1:34:38] Calvary something has released you
[1:34:41] there's no more
[1:34:43] guilt there's no more condemnation
[1:34:46] there's no more sin it is
[1:34:50] finished it is
[1:34:53] done it is
[1:34:56] over God has extended us so much
