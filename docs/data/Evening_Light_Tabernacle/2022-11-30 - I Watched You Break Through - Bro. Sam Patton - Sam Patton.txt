Original song by Samuel Patton & Andrew Tushner

I Watched You Break Through

Verse 1
I saw your struggles
Fear had its grip on you
I saw the years of tears and prayers
That were prayed for you
I saw the torment
Satan's bluff put on you
But I watched, I watched you break through

Chorus
I watched you break free of those chains that held you bound 
Saw God's mighty hand bring deliverance down
In just one moment, atonement
Changed
Delivered
Set free
I see what God's done for you
I watched you break through

Verse 2 
Ol satan trapped you
In his dark web of sin
Tried to put out the light
That God had put within
We serve a God who answers
And didn't stop praying for you
There I watched, I watched you break through

Tag
In just one moment, atonement
Changed
Delivered
Set free
I see what God's done for you
I watched you break through
