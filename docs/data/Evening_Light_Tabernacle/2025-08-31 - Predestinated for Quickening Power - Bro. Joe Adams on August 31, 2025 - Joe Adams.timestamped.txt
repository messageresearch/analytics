[19:33] Boy, I'm going to take a trip on that
[19:36] good old gospel ship and go sailing
[19:40] through the air.

[19:51] beyond the sky.
[19:55] Oh, I'm going to shout and sing until
[19:58] the heavens ring. While I bid this world
[20:03] goodbye.
[20:04] [Applause]
[20:06] And I can scarcely wait. I know I'll not
[20:10] be late. For I spend all my time in
[20:14] prayer.
[20:17] And when my ship comes in, I leave this
[20:21] world of sin and go sailing through the
[20:25] air.
[20:28] Oh. Amen. Let's all stand together. That

[20:45] this world goodbye.
[20:49] And if you're ashamed of me, you have no

[21:14] old gospel ship. I'm going far beyond
[21:19] the sky.
[21:22] And I'm going to shout and sing until
[21:25] the heavens ring as I live this world
[21:29] could sing again now. Say, I'm going to
[21:33] take a trip in that good old gospel
[21:36] ship. Going far beyond the sky.
[21:43] I'm going to shout and sing.

[22:40] praise out loud that if they didn't
[22:43] praise him, the rocks would cry out. I'd
[22:47] never let a mountain or shout in my

[31:02] Hallelujah.
[31:04] Lord, we come to you this morning,
[31:05] Father, Lord, with thankful hearts that
[31:08] you would give us another opportunity to
[31:10] worship you, Lord. Lord, another time
[31:13] that we could set aside and just focus
[31:15] solely on you, Father, and all that
[31:18] you've done for us, Lord. Lord, we look
[31:21] forward to that day that we take that
[31:23] trip on that gospel ship as we sang
[31:26] about, Lord. Lord, our hearts cry, even
[31:29] so, come, Lord Jesus, come.
[31:32] But Lord, as we're here on this earth,
[31:34] Lord, I pray you'll reveal what you
[31:36] would have us to do. and Lord that you
[31:38] would use our lips and our vessels,
[31:41] Father, for your glory. Be with the
[31:43] songs that are sung this morning, Lord.
[31:45] Be with the ministry of the word,
[31:47] Father, as Brother Joe has prepared,
[31:49] Lord, and Lord, given of his time and
[31:52] his efforts and his gift back unto you,
[31:54] dear God. I pray you'll bless it, Lord,
[31:56] and move across the congregation this
[31:59] morning, Father. Lord, we believe that
[32:01] you're here to heal, Lord. Lord, we
[32:04] believe that you're here to set free and
[32:06] deliver to live, Father. Lord, I pray
[32:08] that our faith will rise, Lord, and that
[32:11] each one, Lord, will leave better than
[32:14] when we came, Lord. But not only that,
[32:16] that you'll move across the wayward
[32:18] ones, Lord. Lord, that you'll reach into
[32:21] the highways and the byways, and you'll
[32:23] compel to come, Father. Lord, maybe it
[32:26] would be through our faith or our
[32:27] testimony, however you would do it,
[32:29] Lord. Lord, we want that last one to
[32:31] come home, Father. Lord, we want to see
[32:34] your blessed face, Lord. And Lord, we we
[32:37] just pray, Lord, that whatever we say or
[32:40] do, Father, will bring us one step
[32:42] closer, Lord, to that wonderful time. Be
[32:45] with those that are away, the services,
[32:47] Lord, there in Virginia, very many that
[32:50] are there, those in Dallas, Father,
[32:52] different ones traveling. I pray you'll
[32:53] be with them, Lord. But for each one
[32:56] here, every need that's represented,
[32:57] every hand that's lifted, you see it,
[32:59] Father.
[33:01] Lord, touch and anoint and move. We
[33:03] pray. We pray for Brother Alvin Adams,
[33:05] Lord. A prayer request for him to touch
[33:07] his body. Lord, no doubt there's many
[33:09] others that would need a touch
[33:11] physically, spiritually, Lord, with
[33:13] their family, with their work, Lord. You
[33:15] see the grieving heart, Father. Lord,
[33:18] and I pray you'll come and move. We ask
[33:21] we give ourselves to you. Bless the
[33:23] tithes and the offering, Lord.
[33:26] Be with each one that's here. In Jesus
[33:27] name we pray.
[33:30] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.

[41:51] fear.
[41:53] Oh,
[41:55] fear
[41:57] is a liar.
[42:00] [Music]
[42:01] He will take your breath, stop you in
[42:05] your sar.
[42:10] He is a liar.
[42:14] He will rob your
[42:17] seal your happiness.
[42:20] Catch your fear
[42:24] in the fire
[42:27] with fear.
[42:30] He is a liar.
[42:32] [Music]
[42:34] Fear.
[42:36] He is a liar.
[42:46] Hallelujah. Is that your desire this
[42:48] morning? Let your fire come down and
[42:50] cast out all my fear. Amen. Get deep.
[42:54] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[42:56] Hallelujah.
[42:58] Amen. Thank you, brother Brandon.
[43:02] Hide
[43:03] me

[43:10] your
[43:12] wings.
[43:16] Oh, cover
[43:20] me
[43:24] within your mighty
[43:27] hand.
[43:30] When the ocean rise and thunderers
[43:35] roar,

[43:42] the storm.
[43:44] Father, you are king over the flood.
[43:51] I will be still know you,
[43:56] our God. Hide me now. Sing it again. Oh,
[44:00] hide
[44:02] me
[44:04] now
[44:07] under
[44:09] your
[44:10] wings.
[44:14] and cover.
[44:18] Oh, cover me, Lord. Just cast out all my
[44:20] fear within your might.
[44:24] And
[44:26] when the ocean rise and thunderers roar,
[44:32] I will soar with you above
[44:37] the storm.
[44:39] Father, you are king over
[44:44] the flood
[44:46] and I will be still and know you
[44:51] our God. Find rest my soul.
[44:54] Find rest
[44:56] my
[44:58] soul
[45:01] in Christ
[45:03] alone.
[45:05] [Music]
[45:08] Oh no, brother Tim
[45:11] you're special. Oh in his quietness.
[45:16] Oh and trust
[45:20] when the ocean rise and thunderers
[45:24] roar.
[45:27] I will soar with you above the storm.
[45:33] Father, you are king over
[45:37] the blood. Oh, and I will be still and
[45:42] know you. Father, you are king. Oh,
[45:47] Father, you are king over
[45:51] the blood.
[45:53] And I will be still and know you
[45:58] are God.
[46:03] [Music]
[46:07] Take these hands
[46:11] and lift them up.
[46:15] For I have not the strength to praise
[46:19] you near enough.
[46:23] For I am nothing.
[46:27] Oh Lord, I'm nothing.
[46:32] without you.
[46:38] And take my voice
[46:42] and pour it out
[46:46] and let it sing the songs of mercy I
[46:51] have found.
[46:54] For I am nothing.
[46:57] Oh Lord, I'm nothing
[47:01] without you.
[47:07] And all my soul
[47:13] needs
[47:14] is all your love
[47:18] to cover me.
[47:21] All the world
[47:25] will see
[47:28] that I am nothing
[47:32] without you
[47:38] and take my body
[47:42] and build it up.
[47:46] May it be broken as an offering of love.
[47:53] For I am nothing.
[47:56] Oh Lord, I'm nothing
[48:00] without you.
[48:02] [Music]
[48:05] And all my soul
[48:11] needs
[48:12] all your love
[48:16] to cover me.
[48:19] So all the world
[48:23] will see that I am nothing
[48:30] without you.
[48:35] and take my time.
[48:40] You're on this earth
[48:43] and let it glorify
[48:46] all that you are worth.
[48:50] For I am nothing,
[48:53] oh Lord, I'm nothing.
[48:56] Oh, without you.
[48:59] [Music]
[49:02] And all my soul
[49:07] needs is all your love
[49:13] to cover me.
[49:15] So all the world
[49:19] will see
[49:22] that I am nothing.
[49:26] without you. Oh my soul
[49:31] and all my soul
[49:34] [Music]
[49:38] is all your love
[49:42] to cover me.
[49:45] All the world
[49:49] will see that I am nothing
[49:56] without you
[50:01] and take my time.
[50:05] you're on this earth
[50:08] and let it glorify
[50:11] all that you are worth.
[50:15] For I am nothing,
[50:18] oh Lord, I'm nothing
[50:22] without you.
[50:28] And all my soul
[50:31] [Applause]
[50:33] needs is all your love
[50:38] to cover me.
[50:40] So all the world
[50:45] will see that I am nothing
[50:51] without you.
[50:56] and take these hands
[51:01] and lift them up.
[51:05] For I have not the strength to praise
[51:08] you nearly enough.
[51:13] For I am nothing,
[51:16] oh Lord, I'm nothing
[51:20] without
[51:22] you.
[51:24] [Music]
[51:30] Hallelujah.
[51:32] Would you stand and keep worshiping his
[51:34] name? Can you say, "Lord, I'm nothing
[51:36] without you." Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[51:40] All my soul needs this morning, Lord, is
[51:43] for you to cover me.
[51:46] Hallelujah.
[51:50] Hallelujah.
[51:53] And let your people proclaim
[51:58] you are holy.
[52:02] We tell you you are holy
[52:06] God and we lift up your name
[52:12] and give gloryy.
[52:16] Oh, glory
[52:18] all to you. And let your people
[52:22] proclaim.
[52:25] You are holy.
[52:28] Oh, you are holy, God. And we lift up
[52:35] your name
[52:38] and give gloryy.
[52:41] Oh.
[52:43] Oh, just give him glory this morning.
[52:46] And let your people proclaim,
[52:52] you are holy, Lord,
[52:57] oh God, and we lift up your name,
[53:02] oh yes, Lord, and give gloryy,
[53:06] oh,
[53:08] we give you glory, Father, and let your
[53:12] your holy name.
[53:16] You are holy.
[53:19] Oh, tell him you are. You are holy, God.
[53:24] And we lift up your name
[53:28] and give glory.
[53:31] Oh, glory. Oh, to you. One more time.
[53:37] Let your people proclaim
[53:41] you are holy.
[53:44] Oh tell him you are holy God. And we
[53:50] lift up your name
[53:53] and give glory.
[53:56] Oh glory to
[54:00] your name.
[54:05] Amen. That's what we're here for this
[54:08] morning.
[54:09] To give glory to his name.
[54:12] Hallelujah. Let's just go to him in
[54:14] prayer. Father, we just bow our hearts
[54:17] and our heads to you this morning, Lord.
[54:20] We want to say thank you, Father, for
[54:21] the the atmosphere that we feel already,
[54:24] Lord. Your presence, your anointing is
[54:27] here, Lord. Captivating hearts,
[54:28] captivating lives, Lord. Young and old
[54:31] alike. Father, we feel your presence,
[54:34] Lord. We have sung the songs of Zion,
[54:36] Lord. And Lord, your presence is ushered
[54:39] in on the on the winds of our prayers
[54:41] this morning on the Lord, our praise as
[54:44] we would send up adoration unto you this
[54:46] morning, God. And Lord, we're just
[54:48] captivated by your word, captivated by
[54:50] your presence. And Lord, you would tell
[54:52] us through a prophet ministry that the
[54:54] angel of the Lord accompanies the
[54:56] message. So we invite you this morning,
[54:58] Father, accompany to the word, Lord,
[55:00] your people as assembled together this
[55:02] morning, Lord, not to hear from a man
[55:05] and man's ideas or man's special
[55:07] instructions or interpretations, but
[55:09] Lord, they come to hear from you this
[55:11] morning. So we invite you, God, that you
[55:14] would come and break the bread of life.
[55:15] Speak to us, Lord, know our hearts to
[55:18] receive, our ears to hear. Lord, we just
[55:20] commit our lives to you aresh this
[55:22] morning. Lord, you see those that are
[55:24] sick and body, can't be here. Lord, we
[55:27] just pray you would touch them this
[55:28] morning in a special way, Lord. Lord,
[55:30] bring healing to their bodies, Lord.
[55:32] Recover them from the sickness that's
[55:34] trying to keep them out of the house of
[55:35] God.
[55:37] And just thank you now, Father, as we
[55:39] just turn this service over to you,
[55:41] Lord. We invite you,
[55:44] we invite you to be the guest speaker
[55:46] this morning.
[55:48] We invite your presence now, Lord, to to
[55:50] minister to hearts and lives, however
[55:52] you choose, however you will, Lord. May
[55:55] you have free reign, free course of the
[55:57] service, God. We don't want to hinder
[56:00] you, but Lord, by our unbelief this
[56:02] morning. We don't want to hinder you by
[56:03] traditions.
[56:05] But we invite you, Lord,
[56:07] as you move, move,
[56:10] Lord, as you work, may you just work
[56:12] through us. May you find a willing
[56:14] vessel, a heart that have received the
[56:15] word this morning.
[56:17] Lord, where there would be a shout,
[56:19] Lord, may it not be out of place, but
[56:20] may the shadow of the king be in the
[56:22] camp this morning. May we feel your
[56:25] presence, God, and may we respond to
[56:27] you,
[56:29] Lord. As I hearing the Song of Songs,
[56:32] Lord God, she was leaning, Lord God, on
[56:35] her beloved, and she began to smell like
[56:37] her beloved. Lord, she be to smell this
[56:40] fragrance. Lord, it was on her, Lord. I
[56:42] just pray that your fragrance would be
[56:43] on us this morning, God. your presence
[56:46] to be all around us, on us, in us. Lord
[56:48] God, that you'd be the one that would
[56:50] move through, Lord, in and through this
[56:52] service this morning.
[56:55] We just commit it to you now, Lord, in
[56:57] Jesus name. Amen.
[57:07] [Music]
[57:08] Amen. It was certainly an honor to be
[57:11] here with you this morning.
[57:15] I feel like I feel like a guest minister
[57:17] at home.
[57:19] We're gone so much and we we thank the
[57:21] Lord for that. But it's certainly always
[57:23] an honor and a privilege to be home
[57:25] speaking to the home people. And we see
[57:27] we have Sister Laura Hall's mom with us
[57:29] this morning. God bless you. Welcome.
[57:31] Next time you and I win. We're not going
[57:34] to be defeated. We know what I'm talking
[57:35] about. Next time somebody gets married,
[57:37] we're going to have everything in line.
[57:38] And that purse of hers, it has
[57:40] everything. There's probably the rapture
[57:42] is probably in that purse somewhere. We
[57:43] just didn't have time to dig it out. But
[57:45] we will win next time.
[57:47] This morning, we just want to just kind
[57:49] of go to the word here in Ephesians 1
[57:51] verse 3 through verse 11. I have several
[57:55] thoughts that I've not ministered here
[57:57] yet. And I've been waiting. Seems like
[57:59] every time I get ready to preach, there
[58:00] comes a thunderstorm or a raincloud and
[58:03] a power goes out. And I just been
[58:06] waiting and waiting till I have some
[58:07] consecutive services so we can preach
[58:09] some of these to you. And thankfully,
[58:11] the Lord has provided that. We're going
[58:12] to speak to you this morning on
[58:14] predestinated for quickening power.
[58:16] Predestinated
[58:18] for quickening power. Just want to take
[58:20] our time this morning. Brother Mike
[58:21] reminded me in the back. We only have
[58:22] one service this morning. Brother Joe, I
[58:25] said, "That's right. That's right. We've
[58:27] heard that for years." So, we just we
[58:29] don't want to we don't want to
[58:30] overburden you, but we do want to share
[58:32] what the Lord has for us this morning.
[58:34] But here in Ephesians 1 says, "Blessed
[58:36] be the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[58:38] Christ, who has blessed us with all
[58:40] spiritual blessings in heavenly places,
[58:43] according as he has chosen us in him
[58:45] before the foundation of the world."
[58:47] Notice now he
[58:50] hath chosen us, not we choose him, but
[58:53] notice where he chose us. In him, in him
[58:56] before the found
[58:59] mercy,
[59:02] in him before the foundation of the
[59:04] world, that we should be holy and
[59:08] without blame before him in love, having
[59:10] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[59:13] children by Jesus Christ to himself,
[59:15] according to the good pleasure of his
[59:17] will, to the praise of the glory of his
[59:20] grace, wherein he hath made us accepted
[59:22] in the beloved, in whom we have
[59:24] redemption through his blood, the
[59:26] forgiveness of sins, according to the
[59:28] riches of his grace, wherein he has
[59:30] abounded toward us in all wisdom and
[59:32] prudence, having made known unto us the
[59:35] mystery of his will, according to his
[59:38] good pleasure, which he has purposed in
[59:39] himself, that in the dispensation of the
[59:42] fullness of times, he might gather
[59:43] together in one all things in Christ,
[59:46] both which are in heaven, which are on
[59:47] earth, even in him, in whom also we have
[59:50] obtained an inheritance, being
[59:52] predestinated according to the purpose
[59:54] of him who workketh all things after his
[59:58] counsel of his own will. God bless you.
[1:00:00] You can have your seats this morning.
[1:00:07] Give me a little bit more volume if you
[1:00:08] don't mind. Uh so we just kind of want
[1:00:11] to take our time this morning and look
[1:00:13] at this. I like how brother Brandon
[1:00:15] would tell us predestination. You know
[1:00:17] that's a strong word even after you had
[1:00:19] a prophet come and clearly bring out
[1:00:21] predestination and state that it's
[1:00:23] biblical. state how God sees
[1:00:25] predestination. We find many people
[1:00:26] still struggle with that term or that
[1:00:28] word predestination. But the word here,
[1:00:31] it means that God has decided
[1:00:33] beforehand. It's marked out in advance
[1:00:36] eternal destiny of a certain people
[1:00:38] particularly those who uh whom he
[1:00:41] elects. And we find here that
[1:00:42] predestination according to the purpose
[1:00:44] of him. The Bible says who workketh all
[1:00:47] things after the counsel of his will. So
[1:00:49] predestination is not only to sunship
[1:00:52] but it's also to an inheritance. It
[1:00:54] secures us in adoption but not only
[1:00:57] secures us in adoption but it prepares
[1:00:59] us for a heavenly portion as well. The
[1:01:01] Bible says that we are already seated in
[1:01:04] heavenly places. How do we get there?
[1:01:06] Because of predestination.
[1:01:08] Predestination. And the prophet of God
[1:01:10] will tell us that here he says now you
[1:01:12] know something because he goes let me
[1:01:14] let me slow down a little bit.
[1:01:16] He goes, "You're not something because
[1:01:18] you desire to be something."
[1:01:20] That's right.
[1:01:22] You are something.
[1:01:25] You are what you are by the will of God.
[1:01:29] So many times we see somebody and it's
[1:01:31] in us as a young person. We emulate or
[1:01:33] we we try to strive to be like that
[1:01:36] person. But here God through a prophet
[1:01:38] is telling us you are not something
[1:01:40] because you desire to be something. But
[1:01:43] you are something because God has
[1:01:45] already saw you in his thoughts. God had
[1:01:47] already saw you in his mind. God had
[1:01:49] already predestinated you for a purpose.
[1:01:53] So you can be what you desire to be. But
[1:01:56] you can and you will be what God has
[1:01:59] predetermined your life to be.
[1:02:02] And we find that he is he's
[1:02:04] predestinated us unto the adoption. He's
[1:02:07] predestinated us unto the quickening
[1:02:10] power.
[1:02:12] So we're not something today because we
[1:02:15] desired it, because we merited it. You
[1:02:18] know, you're something, but God willed
[1:02:20] you to be something.
[1:02:22] That's right.
[1:02:24] Now, how many of you are the president
[1:02:25] of the United States of America? None of
[1:02:27] us. And I hope none of you really desire
[1:02:30] that. But we find you're not that
[1:02:32] because it's not in you to be that.
[1:02:36] But it's in you this morning to be a son
[1:02:38] and a daughter of God. And that's why
[1:02:41] you're sitting here this morning. You're
[1:02:43] not out there in the world. You're not
[1:02:45] out in some bar. You're not out on some
[1:02:46] street corner. You're not found in some
[1:02:48] denominational system. But you are here
[1:02:51] this morning because before the
[1:02:53] foundation of the world, he chose you
[1:02:55] and him. And he predestinated you not
[1:02:59] just to sit here but to come in this
[1:03:01] hour in this age to be a part of this
[1:03:04] church to be a part of the message
[1:03:06] movement not just a movement but to be a
[1:03:08] part of him himself. He predestinated
[1:03:11] you and he's making known to us in this
[1:03:14] hour the mystery of his will.
[1:03:17] That word will there means purpose. He
[1:03:19] is making known to us this morning as
[1:03:22] the bride of Jesus Christ. the very
[1:03:24] mystery of his purpose.
[1:03:29] So we find the Bible would tell us or
[1:03:31] brother Brandon would tell us that
[1:03:33] predestination what does it do? It looks
[1:03:35] back to fornowledge.
[1:03:39] But because we were fornown of God in
[1:03:42] his thinking he fornowledge begins to
[1:03:44] look to our destiny.
[1:03:47] See so I can tell you this morning your
[1:03:49] destiny is not defeat.
[1:03:52] Your destiny is not destruction. Your
[1:03:54] destiny is not demise. Your destiny is
[1:03:57] not to struggle with this humanity. Your
[1:04:00] destiny is not hell and hellfire. But
[1:04:02] can I tell you this morning, God has
[1:04:04] predetermined you to be quickened by the
[1:04:07] word
[1:04:08] to be quickened, made alive by the
[1:04:10] spirit of God.
[1:04:13] It's not just to pacify and drift
[1:04:15] through life. That's not your purpose.
[1:04:18] Luke 24:49, the Bible would tell us,
[1:04:22] "Behold, I send the promise of my father
[1:04:25] upon you, but ye in the city of
[1:04:28] Jerusalem until you be endued with power
[1:04:31] from my eyes." So, there's a promise of
[1:04:33] power.
[1:04:34] There's a promise of a change.
[1:04:37] Notice he says, "I send the promise of
[1:04:39] what? Of the father." Now, the father
[1:04:42] was the logos, the word that dwelt alone
[1:04:45] by himself. Then we find in Romans 8, if
[1:04:48] Christ be in you, then the body is dead
[1:04:51] because of sin.
[1:04:53] But the spirit is life. And that word
[1:04:55] life there is Zoey, God's own life
[1:04:58] because of righteousness. But if the
[1:05:00] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[1:05:03] the dead dwell in you, he that raised up
[1:05:05] Christ from the dead shall also quicken
[1:05:08] your mortal bodies.
[1:05:10] Oh, come on. I hope you're looking for
[1:05:12] that day, church.
[1:05:13] You know, today our souls have been
[1:05:15] quickened. We're just waiting on this
[1:05:16] one to be quickened.
[1:05:18] We're waiting on this humanity, this
[1:05:20] flesh to be quickened. Notice, and the
[1:05:22] Bible would tell us, by his spirit that
[1:05:24] dwelleth in you.
[1:05:27] So God's will is his purpose.
[1:05:32] God's will and his purpose and his
[1:05:34] desires is his desires and his
[1:05:36] intentions. So many of us sometimes we
[1:05:39] want, what is God's purpose for my life?
[1:05:41] What is God's plan for my life? And you
[1:05:44] know in Jeremiah, if you'd never read
[1:05:45] the book of Jeremiah, haven't read it
[1:05:47] recently, maybe you need to travel
[1:05:49] through the pages of the book of
[1:05:50] Jeremiah and see and read there and you
[1:05:53] look in Jeremiah 29, very familiar
[1:05:55] scripture to us. And you know, in
[1:05:57] another service, I'm going to take this
[1:05:58] scripture here and then just preach a
[1:06:00] couple sermons on it. But God's telling
[1:06:02] Jeremiah, "For I know the thoughts that
[1:06:04] I think towards you."
[1:06:07] Some of us, you know, we don't think God
[1:06:09] knows about us.
[1:06:11] You know, we find ourselves in a trial
[1:06:13] or difficult situation and we think,
[1:06:14] well, God's abandoned me. God forgot me.
[1:06:16] God doesn't know about me. But he tells
[1:06:18] Jeremiah here, I know the very thoughts
[1:06:20] that I think towards you.
[1:06:23] Sayeth the Lord, thoughts of peace and
[1:06:24] not of evil to give you an expected end.
[1:06:28] And this word thought here means plan
[1:06:30] and purpose.
[1:06:32] So God knows the plan for your life. God
[1:06:35] knows the very purpose for you being.
[1:06:41] And we look here in Romans 9. We're
[1:06:42] going to kind of build this build this
[1:06:44] this morning. Romans 9 and verse 11
[1:06:47] says, "For the children being not yet
[1:06:49] born, neither neither having done good
[1:06:52] or evil, that the purpose or the
[1:06:55] thoughts
[1:06:57] of God according to election might
[1:07:00] stand, not of works, but is of him that
[1:07:04] calleth."
[1:07:05] It was said unto her, "The elder shall
[1:07:07] serve the younger." For it is written,
[1:07:08] Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I
[1:07:10] hated. What shall we say then? Is there
[1:07:13] unrighteousness with God?
[1:07:16] Because he chose Jacob over Esau because
[1:07:19] he chose you over the world. Maybe
[1:07:21] you're one out of the only one out of
[1:07:23] your family that's serving God in the
[1:07:25] message. Is God unrighteous? No, God's
[1:07:28] not unrighteous.
[1:07:30] What shall we say then? Is there
[1:07:31] unrighteousness with God? God forbid.
[1:07:34] For he said to Moses, "I will have mercy
[1:07:36] on whom I will have mercy. I will have
[1:07:39] compassion on whom I will have
[1:07:40] compassion." So then, it is not a him
[1:07:43] that willth, nor him that runth, but
[1:07:45] it's God that showeth mercy. That's why
[1:07:48] you're here this morning, because you
[1:07:50] have found the favor of God. God has
[1:07:53] shown mercy upon your life. God begin to
[1:07:55] move upon that heart. He begin to
[1:07:57] quicken that seed and draw you to
[1:08:00] himself.
[1:08:02] draw you out of that lifestyle that you
[1:08:04] were living in.
[1:08:07] In the church age, he says, "We know
[1:08:09] most assuredly that the purpose of God
[1:08:12] stands in election.
[1:08:15] It was purpose in himself. It was God's
[1:08:18] purpose to bring forth the people like
[1:08:20] unto himself." That would be a word
[1:08:22] bride.
[1:08:24] Notice it wasn't purpose in a prophet.
[1:08:27] It wasn't purpose in a church. It wasn't
[1:08:29] purposed in a man. But it was purposed
[1:08:31] in God to bring a people unto himself.
[1:08:34] That would be the word, right? She was
[1:08:36] chosen before the foundation of the
[1:08:38] world in him.
[1:08:42] She was fornown and beloved before she
[1:08:45] was ever brought forth during the ages
[1:08:47] upon the earth. She was redeemed by his
[1:08:49] blood and can never come into
[1:08:51] condemnation. I say hallelujah this
[1:08:54] morning. I can never come into
[1:08:57] condemnation
[1:08:58] because I was predestinated
[1:09:01] to be quickened.
[1:09:03] Brother B says he makes everything to
[1:09:05] meet its purpose. Whatever it is like a
[1:09:07] tree if it bears certain acorn or
[1:09:10] apples. See he makes the fruit of the
[1:09:12] garden and so forth it all for his
[1:09:14] purpose. Everything had come to pass. He
[1:09:16] had spok it. Now the only thing that he
[1:09:18] had to do after he had spoken is just to
[1:09:20] sit back and rest. So when he said let
[1:09:22] there be light, God didn't frustrate the
[1:09:24] plan. He didn't frustrate and try to
[1:09:26] figure it out when was that light going
[1:09:28] to come. God spoke it and he sat back
[1:09:30] and rested and light appeared.
[1:09:32] But he also tells us in Genesis 2, let
[1:09:35] us make man in our image after our
[1:09:37] likeness. God didn't worry about all the
[1:09:39] the the the trials that we would go
[1:09:41] through. He knew the word had already
[1:09:43] went forth. He knew that. He said, I'll
[1:09:45] have a church without spot, without
[1:09:47] wrinkle, without blemish. All that he's
[1:09:49] sitting back doing is resting because
[1:09:51] the word will produce exactly what he
[1:09:54] said it would do. And God is resting on
[1:09:56] that. And if I can just get you this
[1:09:58] morning to rest on God's purpose, to
[1:10:00] rest on God's plan, that the word has
[1:10:03] already been spoken to you this morning.
[1:10:05] You can't fall. You can't go down in
[1:10:07] defeat. You can't go down in destruction
[1:10:09] because you're predestinated for
[1:10:11] quickening power.
[1:10:15] God knows the thoughts that he thinks
[1:10:17] towards you. Now, he's telling Jeremiah
[1:10:20] this, and Jeremiah hadn't even got
[1:10:22] through the bad times yet.
[1:10:26] Jeremiah's about to be put in a dungeon.
[1:10:28] He about to be put in prison, taken out,
[1:10:30] put back in, taken out, put back in.
[1:10:33] But God's telling them, "I know the
[1:10:35] thoughts, Jeremiah.
[1:10:38] I know the purpose behind your ministry.
[1:10:42] I got a people that you're going to
[1:10:44] speak to in Leodia
[1:10:47] and you're going to be express my
[1:10:50] thoughts to them. No matter what your
[1:10:52] hardships has been, no matter what your
[1:10:54] difficulties has been, oh, you may lay
[1:10:57] before me Jeremiah as a weeping prophet,
[1:10:59] but don't worry, joy cometh in the
[1:11:00] morning.
[1:11:02] Joy cometh in the morning. Notice the
[1:11:05] Bible says, "Having made known to us
[1:11:09] the mystery of his will."
[1:11:12] Now, I'm studying. I'm looking at this
[1:11:13] thought here. This may be a completely
[1:11:15] different thought, but the mystery is a
[1:11:17] hidden thing.
[1:11:19] It's a secret thing. How many of you
[1:11:22] have ever had a secret you told your
[1:11:23] best friend?
[1:11:26] This ain't I'm not going to embarrass
[1:11:28] you. It's okay. You know, you tell
[1:11:30] somebody a secret and man, you swear I
[1:11:33] ain't telling nobody.
[1:11:36] It's a secret. God's held it for so long
[1:11:39] to himself. He's been longing, brother
[1:11:42] Mike, for that time. Cuz you know, even
[1:11:45] when you have a secret, you want to tell
[1:11:47] somebody, right?
[1:11:48] You're just itching to find that right
[1:11:50] person.
[1:11:52] Come on now,
[1:11:54] man. Who can I trust with this secret?
[1:11:56] Who can I trust with this mystery? See,
[1:11:59] God has been looking down through ages
[1:12:01] and ages and through six church ages,
[1:12:03] and yet he's found different ones. He
[1:12:05] begin to tell a little bit of this and
[1:12:07] maybe a little bit of that and, you
[1:12:08] know, come to to Luther with
[1:12:10] justification and Wesley with
[1:12:12] sanctification and come to Pentecost
[1:12:14] with the restoration of gifts. But oh,
[1:12:16] in the seventh age, in the final age, he
[1:12:19] begins to unfold the mystery of his
[1:12:21] will, a purpose for his coming, a
[1:12:23] purpose that he had imagined in his
[1:12:25] thoughts, in his mind, before the
[1:12:26] foundation of the world. God is te he's
[1:12:29] pouring back all the mystery.
[1:12:31] He tore the seals off the book and now
[1:12:34] we are the people this morning of the
[1:12:36] revealed mystery of God.
[1:12:39] God's unfolding his plan to us, his
[1:12:43] purpose to us.
[1:12:45] Notice he said he would reveal his
[1:12:46] secrets not to these little cheaters or
[1:12:50] different ones, but it's only to that
[1:12:53] special elect.
[1:12:55] So having made known to us the mystery,
[1:12:59] the secret thing not obvious to
[1:13:02] understanding.
[1:13:03] And this word will here means
[1:13:06] inclination, desire or pleasure. So God
[1:13:09] is making known the mystery of the
[1:13:12] secret pleasure that he has.
[1:13:18] You know, and I I bring this and I I
[1:13:21] want to kind of bring this down. What is
[1:13:23] the vision?
[1:13:25] And we know that we brother talks about
[1:13:27] he tells about the first pool and you
[1:13:30] know and the second pool and but the
[1:13:33] third pool ministry and how the angel
[1:13:34] lord said I'm going to meet you in there
[1:13:36] and he was you know he was lifted up
[1:13:38] above a tent. You know we got people
[1:13:41] today and you know God bless them
[1:13:43] they're looking for a tent. Some are
[1:13:46] looking for an airplane
[1:13:48] and people are constantly looking for
[1:13:49] relics. People are looking for a relic
[1:13:53] to pacify. God ain't coming for a relic.
[1:13:56] You know, the first pool was a type. The
[1:13:58] second pool was a type. But all of a
[1:14:00] sudden, this third pool now has to be a
[1:14:02] physical uh manifestation. God in type.
[1:14:06] Say, "I'm going to meet you in there."
[1:14:08] Notice what was the tent representing?
[1:14:10] The tent was representing this humanity.
[1:14:13] God said, "I'm going to meet you in
[1:14:14] there." This is in 1956. The token
[1:14:17] hasn't been yet given yet. They had an
[1:14:19] anointing of the Holy Ghost, but God was
[1:14:21] telling this prophet, "I'm going to meet
[1:14:23] you there when we get there and the
[1:14:24] seals come off the book. I'm going to
[1:14:26] meet you in there. You're going to go in
[1:14:28] one way, but you're going to come out a
[1:14:30] different way. You're going to go in
[1:14:31] there unfilled, but you're going to come
[1:14:32] out filled with the Holy Ghost. It's
[1:14:34] going to be me, the token light. I'm
[1:14:36] going to fill that tent. I'm going to
[1:14:38] walk in, and you're going to walk out in
[1:14:40] power. You're going to walk out in
[1:14:41] victory. I'm going to quicken you in
[1:14:43] there."
[1:14:45] Yes, sir. See, it's Christ meeting his
[1:14:48] bride in the tent of our humanity.
[1:14:52] He's not looking for badger skins. He's
[1:14:54] not looking for the cedars of Lebanon.
[1:14:56] He's looking for hands.
[1:14:58] He's looking for mortality that he can
[1:15:00] fill with deity.
[1:15:04] When he says it will not be a public
[1:15:07] show,
[1:15:08] it's a secret.
[1:15:11] It's a mystery. How can an eternal God
[1:15:15] dwell in such a a flawed people?
[1:15:20] How can a supernatural God come and fill
[1:15:26] this vessel?
[1:15:28] Mistakes, sin, shame, difficulties. But
[1:15:33] see, it's where Christ meets us and
[1:15:36] gives us the new birth. And what do
[1:15:38] brother say? What is the new birth? It's
[1:15:40] it's the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:15:42] personally to each of you.
[1:15:46] See, it's not public.
[1:15:49] It's personal. It's secret. It's him
[1:15:51] meeting you in that prayer closet. It's
[1:15:54] him meeting you in that chamber where
[1:15:56] you meet God and God becomes intimate,
[1:15:58] becomes personal. And he begins to
[1:16:00] reveal to you, quicken to you his
[1:16:04] purpose and plan for your life. But I'm
[1:16:06] going to tell us in Christ the mystery.
[1:16:08] says, "Now God's got a secret mystery
[1:16:10] that he had before the world began back
[1:16:12] in the back part of God's mind. There
[1:16:14] was something that he was trying and was
[1:16:17] going to achieve and he had a motive in
[1:16:19] doing it in order to let himself be
[1:16:21] expressed." See, there wasn't even a
[1:16:23] moon. There wasn't a star, an atom, a
[1:16:24] molecule or anything. He was God. What
[1:16:28] then? He says, "But exactly, he wasn't
[1:16:30] God at that time
[1:16:31] because God is an object of worship and
[1:16:34] there was nothing to worship him at that
[1:16:36] time. So he was in his great mind now.
[1:16:39] He wanted to see these attributes. God
[1:16:40] had attributes to be a father. He had
[1:16:43] attributes to be a savior. Had
[1:16:44] attributes to be, you know, a husband.
[1:16:46] He had all these great attributes. And
[1:16:48] they laid in the back part of God's
[1:16:50] mind.
[1:16:55] But notice what did God do in the
[1:16:57] seventh age? What did God do? God sent a
[1:17:00] man, not just any man, but he sent a
[1:17:02] seventh angel. And that seventh angel
[1:17:05] went further back than any other
[1:17:07] messenger had ever gone before. He went
[1:17:09] into the very recesses, the very back
[1:17:12] part of God's mind and begin to pull out
[1:17:14] the very expression that God had in
[1:17:17] himself before the foundation of the
[1:17:19] world. Paul didn't do it. Luther didn't
[1:17:21] do it. Wesley didn't do it. But William
[1:17:23] Brana came with an anointing. He was
[1:17:25] anointed by the Holy Spirit to reveal
[1:17:27] the mystery of God. And he went back
[1:17:29] into the back part of God's mind. And
[1:17:31] God begin to express himself.
[1:17:34] God be to open himself up to a people.
[1:17:37] That's right.
[1:17:39] And he said he had a motive and an
[1:17:42] objective to doing it. See, he's got
[1:17:44] these attributes.
[1:17:46] He wants a bride.
[1:17:48] He wants a wife.
[1:17:51] I remember when I was about 19, 20, I
[1:17:54] was looking
[1:17:56] for a bride.
[1:17:58] There's something inside of me longing
[1:18:01] to complete me. That's what God's
[1:18:03] looking for.
[1:18:04] And he would tell us through a prophet
[1:18:06] that God is not complete without you.
[1:18:11] So notice, but God was not necessarily
[1:18:14] God because there was not anything to
[1:18:17] worship him. So he created angels and
[1:18:20] angels was in his presence crying holy,
[1:18:22] holy unto God. They worshiped God. But
[1:18:26] brother Mike, God wasn't complete in
[1:18:28] just having worship.
[1:18:30] There was something missing in the heart
[1:18:32] of God. God wanted to be loved.
[1:18:37] And we find here God had a purpose. He
[1:18:40] says and a hidden mystery. So you can
[1:18:42] see basically in the beginning the very
[1:18:45] thought that God had in his mind he hid
[1:18:47] it from those scholars.
[1:18:51] But just a number, a selected
[1:18:53] predestinated number, a predestinated
[1:18:56] people was the only ones that heard it.
[1:18:59] So can I ask you why are you sitting
[1:19:01] here this morning?
[1:19:03] Did you hear something?
[1:19:05] Have you heard something?
[1:19:07] Have you heard from your theophony?
[1:19:10] Something spoke to you. Maybe you were
[1:19:12] the little chicken or the eagle in the
[1:19:13] chicken yard. And you know, some of us,
[1:19:15] we grew up in the message. We cut our
[1:19:17] teeth on the message spew, but you still
[1:19:18] got to hear that same voice. That's
[1:19:20] right.
[1:19:21] But notice here in Matthew 11:2,
[1:19:25] at this time Jesus answered and he said,
[1:19:27] "I thank thee, oh father, Lord of heaven
[1:19:29] and earth, because thou has hid these
[1:19:31] things from the wise and prudent and has
[1:19:35] revealed them unto babes." Notice this
[1:19:37] word wise here means skilled in letters,
[1:19:39] cultivated, learned. Greek philosophers,
[1:19:41] orators, Jewish theologians, Christian
[1:19:43] teachers, and this word prudent is
[1:19:45] having understanding, wise and learned.
[1:19:47] But but yet God, he hid these things.
[1:19:52] What God had in the back part of his
[1:19:53] mind, brother Tim, he hid them from
[1:19:56] these great intellectual men
[1:19:58] because it was going it's not going to
[1:20:00] come by learned education. It's not
[1:20:02] going to come just because you have the
[1:20:04] ability to put great big vocabulary
[1:20:06] words together and read the thesaurus
[1:20:08] and encyclopedia bratannica or whatever
[1:20:10] you want to put there. But it's going to
[1:20:12] come by revelation.
[1:20:14] God's going to reveal to you that before
[1:20:17] there was ever a world, before there was
[1:20:19] ever a stardust, before there ever was a
[1:20:21] moon, before you ever came into
[1:20:23] existence, you were in God's thinking.
[1:20:25] You were in the back part of God's mind.
[1:20:28] And that only comes by revelation,
[1:20:30] spiritual revelation of the word of God.
[1:20:35] Colossians 1 and verse 26 says, "Even
[1:20:37] the mystery which had been hid from the
[1:20:40] ages
[1:20:41] and from generations, but now
[1:20:44] Notice now is made manifest to his
[1:20:47] saints to whom God will make known what
[1:20:50] is the riches of his glory of this
[1:20:53] mystery among the Gentiles which is
[1:20:55] Christ in you
[1:20:59] the hope of glory and you look and you
[1:21:01] see failures brother Tom man we see
[1:21:04] difficulties we see a a body getting old
[1:21:07] and aged and decrepit and it brings
[1:21:10] embarrassment but God sees his thoughts
[1:21:15] God sees his plan begin to unfold.
[1:21:19] See the mystery among the Gentiles. He's
[1:21:21] not shared it yet. He's waited to the
[1:21:24] last age to be able to share this with
[1:21:26] the special people, not the educated.
[1:21:29] That's why brother Brandham was against
[1:21:31] the intellectuals because it's not about
[1:21:33] intellectualism. Because some of you may
[1:21:34] have 34 in your ACT big whip.
[1:21:38] That's great. So you're a brainiac.
[1:21:41] But God's not looking for brainiacs.
[1:21:43] Some of us should say amen to that.
[1:21:47] It ain't about what this can comprehend.
[1:21:49] It's about what this can receive. And
[1:21:52] can it receive the word for its day?
[1:21:54] Because you can receive the word for
[1:21:56] your day. It shows you had
[1:21:57] representation on the other side.
[1:22:01] So we look here the mystery that was in
[1:22:03] the back part of God's mind.
[1:22:05] No other messenger went back there. But
[1:22:08] in the seventh age, you had a vindicated
[1:22:11] prophet go to the back part of God's
[1:22:12] mind and begin to pull it forward.
[1:22:15] Christ, the mystery, the token life, the
[1:22:18] literal life of Christ. What happened?
[1:22:20] The seals come off the book. It became a
[1:22:22] new book.
[1:22:25] Oh, all the mysteries of God were
[1:22:27] finished.
[1:22:28] All the secrets were told.
[1:22:31] He's going to have a bride.
[1:22:33] And she's a mystery among the Gentiles,
[1:22:35] but it's Christ in you. See, I think
[1:22:38] about this. The Bible tells us, this
[1:22:39] another thought for another day, but the
[1:22:41] Bible will tell us that thou art my
[1:22:43] hiding place. David talking to God and
[1:22:45] he's saying, "God, you are my hiding
[1:22:46] place. You're my refuge from the storm.
[1:22:48] You're my high tower." And yet God is
[1:22:52] our hiding place.
[1:22:54] But you can take that and say, God
[1:22:56] speaking through David, telling David,
[1:22:58] you are my hiding place.
[1:23:00] Oh, I'm going to hide myself from the
[1:23:02] world. I'm going to hide myself from the
[1:23:04] magic. I'm going to come down in the Leo
[1:23:06] to see an age and I'm going to hide
[1:23:08] myself in a human vessel and I'm going
[1:23:10] to reveal myself, hallelujah, in a
[1:23:12] failed vessel. I'm going to come down.
[1:23:15] I'm going to tabernacle them. I'm going
[1:23:16] to let deity overtake their humanity.
[1:23:19] And in the end time, they will be the
[1:23:21] final voice to the final age. They will
[1:23:23] be the final expression of God.
[1:23:33] See, according to Romans 4:16, brother
[1:23:35] Ram tells us sm church age, we find that
[1:23:38] God has given us a sure promise to all
[1:23:42] of Abraham's seed. And Paul puts himself
[1:23:45] and all the believers under the
[1:23:48] designation because he says Abraham who
[1:23:50] is the father of us all. Then he goes on
[1:23:53] not only to narrow down his definition
[1:23:56] but rather to finalize it for in
[1:23:58] Galatians 3 he identified the seed
[1:24:01] singular with Jesus encountered the seed
[1:24:04] children as the children of the promise
[1:24:08] and promises having to do with election
[1:24:12] predestination
[1:24:14] election the choosing of God.
[1:24:18] See, I have four children.
[1:24:22] I think they're beautiful.
[1:24:24] And I cater to my four children.
[1:24:27] They'll probably tell you otherwise.
[1:24:31] But because they're my children, they
[1:24:33] come from my loins. They get special
[1:24:36] favor.
[1:24:37] Now, you can come and ask me something
[1:24:39] and you won't find that same favor
[1:24:43] because you didn't come from within me.
[1:24:46] And that's the way it is with God. So
[1:24:48] don't get upset
[1:24:50] if God's showing favor to somebody or
[1:24:54] God's showing favor to some family or
[1:24:56] God's showing favor to us. Why? Because
[1:24:59] we come from God and God knows the very
[1:25:01] intricate thoughts of our lives. We were
[1:25:03] there. God already knows the plan for
[1:25:05] us. And he begins to show favor. And I
[1:25:07] love how he would say to to to uh uh
[1:25:10] what's her name over there in the Bible?
[1:25:11] He begin to drop handfuls on purpose.
[1:25:14] Why? because she was in the thinking of
[1:25:17] God. God was showing in tight what he
[1:25:19] was going to do in an end time. Bri,
[1:25:21] he's going to drop a handful here and a
[1:25:23] mystery there and a revelation over
[1:25:25] here. It's going to she can be healed
[1:25:27] over here and delivered over here. God
[1:25:29] showing the mystery.
[1:25:32] And he begins to drop handfuls on
[1:25:35] purpose for favored people.
[1:25:38] I'm still thinking of that name.
[1:25:40] Somebody say it.
[1:25:41] Hallelujah. Ruth,
[1:25:44] don't get old, people.
[1:25:47] It's not for the faint of heart.
[1:25:51] But notice God showing down through
[1:25:53] Ruth. But what did Ruth have to do? She
[1:25:56] had to get before the feet of Boaz.
[1:25:59] She had to humble herself. Brother
[1:26:01] Johnny, get there so she could find
[1:26:03] favor.
[1:26:04] One minute she's gleaning in the field,
[1:26:06] the next day she's oning the field.
[1:26:11] Talk about favor. Talk about God's
[1:26:13] purpose. Talking about God's plan. God's
[1:26:15] plan for you not just to glean.
[1:26:18] God's plan for you not just to make it
[1:26:20] through Leodysia.
[1:26:22] We're going to come back and rule and
[1:26:23] reign.
[1:26:25] So, we find, notice now what he says
[1:26:27] here in very plain language, the true
[1:26:30] bride of Christ was in the mind of God
[1:26:33] eternally, though not expressed until
[1:26:36] each came forth in a designated decreed
[1:26:38] season. As each member came forth it and
[1:26:42] became the expressed and took its place
[1:26:45] in the body. Thus the bride is the
[1:26:47] literal spoken word seed bride.
[1:26:50] And though she is feminine in
[1:26:52] designation, she is also called the body
[1:26:54] of Christ. It is very apparent that she
[1:26:56] ought to be called that. For she was
[1:26:58] hold up I wish I would have put some of
[1:27:01] these notes like brother Aaron does on a
[1:27:03] PowerPoint but I'm not that guy. But he
[1:27:05] says for she was predestinated in him.
[1:27:12] predestinated came from the same source
[1:27:16] was eternal with him and now is
[1:27:19] manifesting God in a many membered body
[1:27:22] whereas once it was God was manifested
[1:27:24] in one member even our lord Jesus but
[1:27:27] now he's in a multi-membered body
[1:27:30] so we find the message when it came it
[1:27:33] didn't just come for William
[1:27:35] Bran
[1:27:37] now I understand there's a lot of people
[1:27:38] that's gone to seed on, you know, if you
[1:27:40] don't see William Brandom, they got you
[1:27:42] got Brandham Christ over in Africa and
[1:27:44] you got people bowing down to his
[1:27:45] preacher and they're baptizing in his
[1:27:47] name and you know, they've got it all
[1:27:49] wrong, church.
[1:27:51] But see, the message didn't come to
[1:27:53] point one man to another man.
[1:27:56] But the message is here to call a bride
[1:27:59] out of a church.
[1:28:01] The message is here to reveal the very
[1:28:03] secrets of God.
[1:28:06] that God is going to have a bride and
[1:28:08] she's going to be the very from the very
[1:28:10] same characteristics, the very same
[1:28:12] source, the very same makeup that the
[1:28:14] groom has. She's going to produce the
[1:28:16] same signs, the same wonders, the same
[1:28:18] display of the supernatural. It's going
[1:28:20] to be within her just as well as it was
[1:28:22] in him. So, can I say it like this?
[1:28:24] Before God was ever God, you existed in
[1:28:27] him.
[1:28:29] Before an angel was ever created, you
[1:28:32] existed.
[1:28:34] Oh, I know you can't think that far
[1:28:36] back, can you? You know, but think about
[1:28:38] it though. Before there was a molecule
[1:28:40] ever was made, before God
[1:28:43] and formed the solar systems and the
[1:28:46] worlds and the galaxies,
[1:28:48] Zach, you were in the mind of God.
[1:28:53] That's just that's a powerful thought
[1:28:56] and your little finite mind is trying to
[1:28:58] wrestle with your trial. And God's like,
[1:29:01] "Before you ever was, he was already
[1:29:03] here."
[1:29:04] That's why he would tell Job when Job
[1:29:06] was going through the hardest and most
[1:29:07] difficult trial, Job, where were you?
[1:29:11] See, all Job could see was a loss of
[1:29:13] health and a loss of wealth and a loss
[1:29:15] of children and a wife that turned his
[1:29:16] back on him and the friends that turned
[1:29:18] against him. See, he can only see just
[1:29:20] like we see a lot of times. He can only
[1:29:23] see the here and now. But God came down
[1:29:25] after all the accusations of the friends
[1:29:28] and all of this and all of that. And he
[1:29:30] comes out, Job, where were you? What was
[1:29:32] God doing? He was reminding Job. Job,
[1:29:34] before you ever came, you was with me in
[1:29:37] my thinking when the sons of God were
[1:29:39] shouting and the sons of God were
[1:29:41] rejoicing. Let me tell you, Job, that's
[1:29:43] where you were. You were rejoicing on
[1:29:45] the other side. Don't let the here and
[1:29:47] now defeat you.
[1:29:49] Don't let the here and now destroy your
[1:29:51] vision.
[1:29:52] That's right,
[1:29:52] your purpose, your plan.
[1:29:55] See, God has a purpose for each of our
[1:29:57] lives. And he says, "Thus the thoughts
[1:29:59] of God, they are eternal and they are
[1:30:02] real." And before that thought can ever
[1:30:05] come to manifestation, it has to first
[1:30:08] be quickened.
[1:30:10] So it's going to take a power to come
[1:30:12] down to quicken that seed or that
[1:30:14] thought or that life. And whatever life
[1:30:17] was in that seed, when it becomes
[1:30:19] quickened, it's going to produce though
[1:30:22] it laid dormant for years. Yes.
[1:30:24] And that's how I think brother can say
[1:30:26] that a son of God can go a long time
[1:30:28] before he ever recognizes he's a son.
[1:30:32] Some of you here this morning we're a
[1:30:34] long time.
[1:30:36] A long time out there in seed form.
[1:30:40] Oh, you look like a seed. You got
[1:30:41] covered up with a lot of muck, a lot of
[1:30:43] dirt, a lot of this, a lot of that. But
[1:30:45] there was a seed there. Let me tell you,
[1:30:47] not only was there a seed there, but
[1:30:49] there was something inside of that seed.
[1:30:51] There was representation on the inside
[1:30:53] of that sea. There was life on the
[1:30:55] inside of that sea. All that seed needed
[1:30:57] was a power to quicken it. All it needed
[1:31:00] to do was lay in the presence of the
[1:31:01] sun. Lay in the presence of that power.
[1:31:04] And at the right time, in the right
[1:31:06] season, the sun will quicken the light
[1:31:08] that's in the seed. And out of that seed
[1:31:10] will come sons and daughters of God. Out
[1:31:13] of that seed will come gifts and
[1:31:15] ministers and deacons and deacons.
[1:31:18] Wives. Out of that seed,
[1:31:21] cuz it's predestinated for quickening
[1:31:23] power.
[1:31:25] Not just going to lay in seed form.
[1:31:29] No, it can't because a word's already
[1:31:31] been spoke over it.
[1:31:34] See, there has to be a power to anoint
[1:31:36] or quicken the life that's in it. That
[1:31:39] word quicken there means to cause to
[1:31:41] live
[1:31:43] by spiritual power to arouse or
[1:31:45] invigorate.
[1:31:47] Now, don't get your mind out of source
[1:31:48] with the word arouse there. But it means
[1:31:51] to stir.
[1:31:53] It's like to shake you from spiritual
[1:31:55] amnesia.
[1:31:58] You are not what the world tells you you
[1:32:01] are. You're not what this one tells you
[1:32:03] you are, but you are a son and a
[1:32:06] daughter of God. And you were in my
[1:32:09] thinking.
[1:32:12] Listen what brother Bam says. There's
[1:32:13] quicken it. What does the word quicken
[1:32:16] mean? The Greek word here means to
[1:32:18] brought to life after death.
[1:32:21] So other words, this human nature has to
[1:32:24] die.
[1:32:26] So you can't come into church, you can't
[1:32:28] try to live that Christian life with
[1:32:30] this thing still living.
[1:32:32] Come on, church.
[1:32:34] I know it's tough. Some of us got a
[1:32:36] wicked ruler. He wants to rise up. I'm
[1:32:40] still here.
[1:32:42] Some of us got genes.
[1:32:45] generational curses. They like to stick
[1:32:47] their hands up every now and then.
[1:32:50] But see, you got to die. This has got to
[1:32:52] die. And a new man, that's like what
[1:32:54] Paul would say, the life that I now live
[1:32:56] in the flesh. I live by the faith of the
[1:32:59] son of God who loved me and gave his
[1:33:02] life for me. Paul was not bringing any
[1:33:04] accolades to this humanity. He said this
[1:33:06] man had to die in order for that man to
[1:33:09] live. And it's the same today, church.
[1:33:11] This old fleshly human nature has to
[1:33:13] die. And that's in order to be made
[1:33:15] alive to be quickened with the power of
[1:33:17] God.
[1:33:21] So the spirit is the life of Christ. Is
[1:33:23] that right?
[1:33:24] The life of Christ. He says now which
[1:33:26] was the word seed brings the seed to
[1:33:28] life. And that life is laying in the
[1:33:31] seed. And this baptism of the Holy
[1:33:33] Spirit comes upon it. It's bound to
[1:33:36] bring that seed to life. That's right.
[1:33:40] It's bound to bring what'sever inside of
[1:33:44] that seed.
[1:33:45] Now, some of you got children that are
[1:33:47] wwarded, that are strayed.
[1:33:52] But I don't want you to give up on the
[1:33:53] seed.
[1:33:56] I don't want you to give up and
[1:33:57] thinking, well, you know, it's been 20
[1:33:58] years, it's been 25 years, it's been
[1:34:00] this long. A son of God can go a long
[1:34:03] time.
[1:34:05] I'm looking at a few of them here this
[1:34:06] morning. They've gone a long time.
[1:34:09] Oh, but there's life.
[1:34:11] If there's life, predestinated life in
[1:34:14] that seed.
[1:34:16] I don't care how long they go.
[1:34:19] You know, brother Brandon, when he went
[1:34:20] beyond the curtain of time, and thank
[1:34:22] God, he allowed a man to go beyond the
[1:34:24] curtain of time and come back and
[1:34:25] explain to us that it's real.
[1:34:28] And what did he find when he got to the
[1:34:29] other side? Young women come running up
[1:34:31] to him. Oh, our precious brother, our
[1:34:33] darling brother. And he said, "Why do
[1:34:35] they say that?" And he said, "Because
[1:34:36] she was past 90."
[1:34:38] Yes, sir.
[1:34:40] Come on, somebody. She was past 90.
[1:34:42] Maybe her mother was praying for that
[1:34:44] daughter and that mother didn't get to
[1:34:46] see that daughter quicken. Well, when
[1:34:48] she was past 90, inside of that mother,
[1:34:51] inside of that sister, that 90 year old
[1:34:54] was a seed, was a light. And at the
[1:34:56] right time, God quickened it. God
[1:34:59] quickened it to life. Don't give up on
[1:35:02] your children. Don't give up on your
[1:35:04] spouses. Commit them to the to the word
[1:35:09] past 90.
[1:35:11] You would have gave up.
[1:35:15] But God's looking for the seed. He's
[1:35:17] looking for the life.
[1:35:19] Notice he says, "Remember my message
[1:35:21] recently on the bride tree? How that
[1:35:24] they took Jesus? He was a tree. When the
[1:35:27] David saw a tree planted by the rivers
[1:35:29] of water, his fruit and seeds in the
[1:35:31] most perfect tree.
[1:35:33] They cut him down, hung him on a
[1:35:35] man-made Roman tree for mockery. But
[1:35:37] what did he do? He rose up on the third
[1:35:40] day. What else did he do? He set forth a
[1:35:43] bride.
[1:35:45] Oh, I'm so thankful, church,
[1:35:48] that God planned a bride.
[1:35:52] You know, when I was out in the in the
[1:35:54] denomination systems and I jumped around
[1:35:56] a little bit there for maybe four or
[1:35:58] five years before I came to the message,
[1:35:59] you never heard preaching like this,
[1:36:01] Brother Mike.
[1:36:03] pride. What
[1:36:05] you didn't hear these great mystery
[1:36:07] truths being revealed to a people.
[1:36:10] So, it shows you it's for a special
[1:36:12] class.
[1:36:14] So, I don't know what you're going
[1:36:16] through this morning or what your years
[1:36:18] been like or your week's been like, but
[1:36:20] look, look to the word. It says you're a
[1:36:23] special class of people.
[1:36:25] This type of preaching that we're
[1:36:27] hearing in the message even here at
[1:36:29] Evening Light Tabernacle, that's just
[1:36:31] not for everybody.
[1:36:33] I'm not saying it's only for Evening
[1:36:35] Light, but I'm saying it's for only the
[1:36:37] message, only the true bride of Christ.
[1:36:40] Brother B tells us when he preached the
[1:36:41] rapture message, he said the rapture
[1:36:43] message is only for the bride.
[1:36:46] So, let me keep going. Now, what did he
[1:36:48] do? He come to redeem this tree. So
[1:36:51] since he redeemed her at Calvary, he's
[1:36:53] ready to plant her now to restore his
[1:36:55] bride tree. The one that should have
[1:36:57] been in Eden, but she fell because she
[1:36:59] disbelieved the word. But here, notice,
[1:37:01] he's going to restore a tree that will
[1:37:04] believe the word. That's why you're here
[1:37:06] this morning because there's been a
[1:37:07] tree. There's been a word that says, "I
[1:37:09] will restore, sayeth the Lord."
[1:37:13] I will restore, sayeth the Lord. She
[1:37:15] started back in the reformation. And
[1:37:17] what did God do? They they formulated
[1:37:19] Luther. He clamped down on it. So God
[1:37:21] pruned the branch. He didn't prune the
[1:37:23] vine. He pruned the branch off. And it
[1:37:25] went on into Wesley. And Wesley him,
[1:37:27] they denominated. He pruned that brine
[1:37:29] off. But the the the life still moved in
[1:37:32] the tree.
[1:37:34] It still moved. Notice what brother
[1:37:35] Brand will say here. He said God is
[1:37:37] speaking of his fruit tree that he had
[1:37:39] planted. God planted a fruit tree. He
[1:37:42] planted on the day of Pentecost and it
[1:37:44] brought the tree there for a purpose and
[1:37:46] he wanted it to bear his fruit word.
[1:37:48] Yes.
[1:37:49] That's why you're here this morning is
[1:37:51] to bear the fruit word.
[1:37:54] See, he wanted a church that would keep
[1:37:57] his word.
[1:37:59] All down through the age, Eve failed to
[1:38:02] keep it. The Jews failed to keep it. The
[1:38:05] law had failed to keep it. So, God
[1:38:07] planted himself his own tree.
[1:38:11] And see, Eve may have failed. The Jews
[1:38:13] may have failed. Denominations may have
[1:38:15] failed. And many message believers had
[1:38:17] failed to keep it, but he says, "She's
[1:38:19] still going."
[1:38:22] Oh, hallelujah. He says, "She's still
[1:38:25] coming. I will restore." He goes, "What
[1:38:27] does it do? In the evening time, there
[1:38:29] will not be an organization." He says,
[1:38:31] "In the evening time, where does the
[1:38:33] fruit ripen?" "At the top." Why? The sun
[1:38:35] hits it there. And at the evening time,
[1:38:37] there shall be light.
[1:38:40] There shall be revelation. There shall
[1:38:43] be understanding. What is it to do? To
[1:38:46] quicken the fruit that's in the seed.
[1:38:50] He said, "Now when Elijah came, he
[1:38:53] turned the hearts of the children or the
[1:38:54] fathers, the patriarch fathers from the
[1:38:57] old Jewish law. He turned them to what?
[1:38:59] He turned them to the the children's
[1:39:01] ministry, which was the the the the son
[1:39:03] of man ministry there in Jesus Christ.
[1:39:05] Then he comes a second time and he
[1:39:07] turning the heart of the children now
[1:39:09] back to the faith of the father.
[1:39:11] So when he came the first time he was
[1:39:13] turning them to Pentecost and now he's
[1:39:15] turning us back to Pentecost. Everything
[1:39:17] points to Pentecost
[1:39:19] cuz what happened at Pentecost?
[1:39:23] What happened? The logos
[1:39:26] came in like a rushing mighty wind.
[1:39:30] The logos God himself divided himself
[1:39:33] among the people. and sat down.
[1:39:38] See, that's why it's always been about
[1:39:40] Pentecost. Not a Zuza with signs and
[1:39:42] wonders, supernatural speaking in
[1:39:44] tongues, but we're talking about the
[1:39:45] very life of Christ.
[1:39:49] The very person, the very deity coming
[1:39:52] and living inside of you.
[1:39:55] So, he turned those old patriarch
[1:39:58] fathers to the quickening power.
[1:40:02] Now he's coming our age because we've
[1:40:04] gotten away from it. And he's turning
[1:40:06] this bride, this people back to that
[1:40:08] same promise. It's a promise of
[1:40:11] quickening power because we have to be
[1:40:14] quickened, made alive in this hour if
[1:40:16] we're ever going to take a rapture.
[1:40:18] So we think about Leodia. Here we are in
[1:40:21] the final age, an age of almost complete
[1:40:23] apost. And yet we recognize this age is
[1:40:26] Satan's. Yet, God is determined. I'm
[1:40:29] going to bring a bride to maturity.
[1:40:33] God, how you going to do it? Look
[1:40:34] around. Look at the laws that being
[1:40:36] passed. Look at the sin that's on the
[1:40:37] street. Look at everywhere on the
[1:40:39] internet, there's sin and debocery and
[1:40:40] everything else. But God has already had
[1:40:43] a word that's gone forth.
[1:40:46] And despite every effort of the enemy to
[1:40:48] destroy, the elect,
[1:40:51] that predestinated seed
[1:40:54] will be quickened.
[1:40:58] Now we look here. We go back.
[1:41:01] We only got one service. Hallelujah.
[1:41:06] We go back and we find that in the very
[1:41:08] beginning in the Garden of Eden. Now,
[1:41:10] many of us can't imagine this
[1:41:13] because we live here in a different
[1:41:15] Eden.
[1:41:18] But you go to this Eden and I can just
[1:41:20] imagine probably 68 69 degrees year
[1:41:25] round.
[1:41:27] Come on, Louisiana. Say amen.
[1:41:30] Y'all just got used to this cold front
[1:41:31] we got. Wait till it heats back up.
[1:41:34] 68 69 perfect eating. Man, sister Lena,
[1:41:38] you think you like greenery? It was
[1:41:40] perfect. Everything manicured just
[1:41:43] perfect. Trees here, flowers here in
[1:41:47] bloom. Adam and Eve walked brother Mike
[1:41:49] through the garden. a perfect Eden with
[1:41:52] a perfect people with a behind a perfect
[1:41:55] message.
[1:41:58] But notice what happened in the perfect
[1:42:01] garden. Satan came down and he borrowed
[1:42:04] the body.
[1:42:06] He borrowed the body of a serpent to go
[1:42:09] and speak to a woman. And what did he
[1:42:11] do? He got that woman to step out from
[1:42:14] behind a perfect word, step out from
[1:42:16] behind a perfect message, and believe a
[1:42:19] perfect lie. if there could be a perfect
[1:42:20] life. And what did he do? He caused all
[1:42:22] the sin, all the destruction, all the
[1:42:25] chaos, all the death, all the calamity
[1:42:28] that ever happened. That's why we're in
[1:42:29] a position we're in this morning is
[1:42:31] because because Satan borrowed the body.
[1:42:34] Oh, but my brother, sister, we're on
[1:42:36] 1933. Almighty God stepped down in this
[1:42:40] age and he borrowed the body. He
[1:42:42] borrowed the body of a seventh grade
[1:42:44] Kentucky. What more? to speak to a
[1:42:46] woman, to speak to an elected bride, to
[1:42:49] speak to the predestinated seat. Oh,
[1:42:52] here he comes back with the perfect
[1:42:54] message.
[1:42:55] And she living in a sinful state. She
[1:42:57] living with shame. She's living with
[1:42:59] difficulties, chaos all around her. But
[1:43:01] she believes a perfect message
[1:43:06] and he quickens her body.
[1:43:09] See, God borrowed a body and now he's
[1:43:12] looking to borrow your body.
[1:43:15] He's looking to borrow your hands.
[1:43:17] Well, it's just for the ministry. No,
[1:43:19] sir.
[1:43:20] He's looking to borrow your lips,
[1:43:23] your life that he can express himself
[1:43:25] through. Why? To quicken you to express
[1:43:29] himself in this hour.
[1:43:33] He's not just going to defeat Satan with
[1:43:34] preachers.
[1:43:38] He's not going to just defeat Satan with
[1:43:39] special meetings.
[1:43:41] Come on, church. Why do we preach it to
[1:43:44] you like this? Why do we preach faith so
[1:43:46] you can attain to it?
[1:43:48] Because you are part of the promise.
[1:43:51] Come on, Sarah.
[1:43:52] You're part of the promise.
[1:43:54] See yourself in the plan. See yourself
[1:43:56] in the book.
[1:43:58] See that God can't judge Abraham because
[1:44:01] you're in Abraham.
[1:44:04] He couldn't judge Sarah because Sarah
[1:44:05] was in Abraham and Abraham pertained to
[1:44:08] the promise. Nor can God judge you
[1:44:10] outside. He can't condemn you because
[1:44:12] you're chosen in him
[1:44:14] and he can't condemn himself. So what
[1:44:16] has God got to do? He's got to bring you
[1:44:18] the revelation that you're part of the
[1:44:20] promise that you are predestinated to be
[1:44:23] quickened.
[1:44:26] Hallelujah.
[1:44:29] Notice we're all worried about falling.
[1:44:33] I'm going to make a mistake. I'm going
[1:44:35] to fall. How many's ever worried about
[1:44:37] that?
[1:44:40] It's just human nature, right?
[1:44:46] I just, you know, I know my humanity. I
[1:44:48] I know my my limitations.
[1:44:51] We're worried about falling. We're
[1:44:53] worried about failing. We're worried
[1:44:55] about, you know, coming short. But
[1:44:57] listen what he says now in Christ. The
[1:44:59] church is the blood of Christ by the
[1:45:01] spirit because the life is in the blood.
[1:45:03] That's baptism of the Holy Ghost that
[1:45:05] baptizes us into the body that
[1:45:07] recognizes only his body, his flesh, his
[1:45:10] word. Denominations won't ever touch
[1:45:12] that. It's a revelation. She knows it.
[1:45:14] So did Eve know it, but she failed. But
[1:45:16] this one knows it. And she will not
[1:45:19] fail.
[1:45:20] I say hallelujah this morning. Little
[1:45:23] bride, you can't fail this morning.
[1:45:24] You're predestinated to victory. You're
[1:45:27] predestinated to win. You're not
[1:45:29] predestinated to destruction. You're not
[1:45:31] predestinated to failures. You're
[1:45:33] predestinated not to fall, to stand in
[1:45:36] the face of loud sin and say, "God will
[1:45:38] have a bride."
[1:45:42] Notice
[1:45:43] she's ordained. Hallelujah. Woo.
[1:45:47] She is ordained not to fall.
[1:45:52] She won't fall. She's predestinated to
[1:45:54] it.
[1:45:57] Predestinated. Predetermined
[1:46:00] beforehand.
[1:46:03] He already knows.
[1:46:05] So redeeming back with him going home
[1:46:09] back to eternal life in a human body.
[1:46:13] God coming and living in this day
[1:46:16] dwelling in the human body to take this
[1:46:18] human vessel back home. He said God had
[1:46:22] a three-fold purpose of redemption.
[1:46:25] First to display himself in Christ.
[1:46:28] Second to have a preeminence in a body.
[1:46:31] third to take fall and Eve back to a
[1:46:33] needing condition. So what does he do?
[1:46:36] He comes in this hour in this age and he
[1:46:40] revealed himself as Christ among us.
[1:46:44] Come on, church.
[1:46:46] That was him. That wasn't William
[1:46:47] Brandon. William Brandon couldn't do
[1:46:48] those things. That seventh grade man
[1:46:50] couldn't come up with the the the the
[1:46:52] sermons that he came up with. That was
[1:46:54] God revealing his nature and his and his
[1:46:56] person to us. So what? so that he can
[1:46:59] have preeminence in a bride. He can have
[1:47:01] preeminence in a body that it ain't the
[1:47:03] show of man. It's not a headquarters,
[1:47:05] not a denomination, but it's Christ
[1:47:06] having preeminence in a body for one
[1:47:09] purpose. Why? To take you back to a
[1:47:11] needing condition again.
[1:47:14] And what does that quickening power? He
[1:47:16] quickens you to the word. And he says
[1:47:19] here in the Easter Seal, "And you are
[1:47:21] quickened." And this quickening power
[1:47:23] brings your body into a rapture
[1:47:25] condition. That's right.
[1:47:28] Notice now the Pentecostal people up
[1:47:29] there when when they got quickened by
[1:47:31] the Holy Spirit, when those Pentecostal
[1:47:33] group up there on the day of Pentecost
[1:47:35] received their abstract deed from God,
[1:47:37] surely it glorified their souls. They
[1:47:40] screamed.
[1:47:43] Well, they trying to shut the sh the
[1:47:44] scream out of the church today. They
[1:47:47] screamed. They saw tongues of fire
[1:47:49] separated upon each of them. It so
[1:47:51] quickened their body till they couldn't
[1:47:53] even speak in an earthly language
[1:47:55] anymore. He quickened their body to a
[1:47:57] heavenly language. The place that they
[1:47:59] were going,
[1:48:01] notice, transformed into an immortal
[1:48:03] language. He says, "What a quickening
[1:48:05] power." And if it did it for them, then
[1:48:09] can it do it for us today?
[1:48:12] Church, if we're ever going to be that
[1:48:13] elect, if we're ever going to be that
[1:48:15] bride,
[1:48:16] then we got to come to that same place
[1:48:18] at Pentecost.
[1:48:20] Now, I'm gonna say this. It's not about
[1:48:22] emotion. It's not about how high you
[1:48:24] jump, how loud you shout, how quick you
[1:48:28] run.
[1:48:29] Got nothing to do with all that. Cuz
[1:48:30] some of you, you may never run. You may
[1:48:32] never shout. You may never dance. But
[1:48:34] you may just throw your hands up and
[1:48:36] worship
[1:48:37] in his presence.
[1:48:39] Tears just stream out of your eyes
[1:48:41] because you're so captivated. You're
[1:48:43] enraptured with his presence.
[1:48:46] Quicken you to new life.
[1:48:48] And what does he do when he quickens
[1:48:49] you? gives you a new nature, new
[1:48:52] desires.
[1:48:54] Young boys, the things that you used to
[1:48:55] do and desire to do, the things that you
[1:48:57] want to look at and that would just eat
[1:48:59] at you and eat at you and eat at you and
[1:49:01] but when you get quickened by that
[1:49:03] power,
[1:49:05] oh, your attention is no longer turned
[1:49:07] to those things. He turns you away from
[1:49:10] it.
[1:49:11] Now the things that you used to desire,
[1:49:13] you desire no more. Now you desire him.
[1:49:17] So it quickened their bodies till they
[1:49:20] brother said they flew so close to
[1:49:21] heaven till it quickened their body till
[1:49:23] they they spoke in a language that they
[1:49:25] never heard before. Quicken their bodies
[1:49:26] they spoke in a heavenly language. They
[1:49:29] were quickened into the presence of God
[1:49:30] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost. God's
[1:49:33] quickening power baptized them into
[1:49:35] that. They were in the place of worship.
[1:49:39] So he's saying, notice without that
[1:49:41] quickening power, we're not even in a
[1:49:42] place of worship.
[1:49:46] So we got to be quickened.
[1:49:48] We find here that the woman at the well,
[1:49:50] brother Brandham, used this type and he
[1:49:52] used it a lot as far as contacting the
[1:49:55] spirit of the individual and he would
[1:49:57] stand there in prayer lines if it was a
[1:49:59] a colored sister or different ones. He
[1:50:02] says you and I, you know, from Samaria
[1:50:04] and different things of that nature and
[1:50:05] and he would go on that line and, you
[1:50:07] know, we have nothing to draw with in
[1:50:09] that story line. And what was he trying
[1:50:10] to do? He's trying to contact her
[1:50:12] spirit. And here he is. is you got the
[1:50:14] woman at the well there and she's from
[1:50:16] Samaria. He's from Jerusalem and you
[1:50:18] know and and and brother B would tell us
[1:50:20] she had fallen from the thoughts of God.
[1:50:22] Notice this here. This is in
[1:50:24] identification of Christ to all ages
[1:50:26] 1964. So this is after the opening of
[1:50:29] the seals. But he says she had fallen
[1:50:31] from the thoughts of God.
[1:50:35] She But notice he says she could be
[1:50:37] redeemed. But you and I will look at her
[1:50:39] and we would seen husband after husband,
[1:50:42] failure after failure, mess after mess,
[1:50:46] chaos after chaos, calamity after chaos
[1:50:50] or calamity. But what did God see? God
[1:50:52] saw the fallen thoughts that he had of
[1:50:54] her before the foundation of the world.
[1:50:56] And he begin to deal with her and begin
[1:50:58] to speak to her. And he begins to reveal
[1:51:00] the word. And he said, "Give me a
[1:51:02] drink." And he says, "You don't have
[1:51:03] anything to draw with, but if you would
[1:51:05] ask me of something to drink, you
[1:51:06] wouldn't thirst again." And she says, "I
[1:51:08] perceive that thou art a prophet." And
[1:51:11] we know when the Messiah comes, he'll
[1:51:13] reveal these things to us. And he says,
[1:51:15] "I am he that speaketh to you." What she
[1:51:17] had representation on the other side.
[1:51:19] And she knew that's what a prophet would
[1:51:21] do.
[1:51:22] And so what happened? God sent a
[1:51:25] prophet. Not just a prophet, but the
[1:51:27] prophet himself, the word himself came
[1:51:29] by her path to quicken that
[1:51:31] predestinated seed.
[1:51:34] Oh, the priest, he's beyond. They had no
[1:51:38] representation,
[1:51:40] but she had representation.
[1:51:44] See, and today representation says the
[1:51:46] message is true.
[1:51:48] See today the me the representation says
[1:51:51] God
[1:51:53] that this message is God's love letter
[1:51:55] to his bride.
[1:51:57] But nonrepresentation said the days of
[1:51:59] miracles is over. They say brother
[1:52:00] Brandham got off. He made mistakes. See
[1:52:03] that's nonrepresentation.
[1:52:05] But aren't you thankful you got
[1:52:06] representation on the other side? See
[1:52:09] eternal life says you always was. See
[1:52:14] you have eternal life. There's only one
[1:52:15] form of that and that's God. God. You
[1:52:17] were his attributes. He thought of you
[1:52:18] and knowed you before the foundation of
[1:52:20] the world in his mind. And she looked
[1:52:24] around. What a sinful shape she was in.
[1:52:26] But notice he couldn't get to that
[1:52:28] priest because the priest was an
[1:52:29] educated scholar, theologian in the
[1:52:31] word, but no representation in heaven.
[1:52:34] Wasn't in God's thinking at all. But
[1:52:36] this woman was.
[1:52:38] She said, "Sir, I perceive that you're a
[1:52:40] prophet."
[1:52:41] And and see, he said, "That's just all
[1:52:44] he wanted her to see.
[1:52:47] So we think sometimes we got to see all
[1:52:48] the mystery. You may not see any
[1:52:51] mystery, but you just got to see
[1:52:53] yourself in the word
[1:52:55] that it's for you. It belongs to you. So
[1:52:58] quickening power came down and quickened
[1:53:01] that seed. Now we're going to we're
[1:53:02] going to turn the corner here for the
[1:53:03] next little bit. We're going to go to
[1:53:06] second Timothy verse three. And I want
[1:53:08] to show you Paul being the first church
[1:53:11] age messenger.
[1:53:13] And Paul said, "If any man comes and
[1:53:14] preach any other gospel, let him be a
[1:53:16] cursed." So we believe in what Paul
[1:53:17] preached to be the truth. So Paul would
[1:53:20] come here. He says, "This know that also
[1:53:21] in the last days, perilous or hard
[1:53:24] times, troublesome times, dangerous
[1:53:25] times shall come. Men shall be lovers of
[1:53:28] their own selves, covetous, boasters,
[1:53:30] proud, blasphemer, disobedient to
[1:53:32] parents, unthankful, unholy, without
[1:53:34] natural affection, truce breakers, false
[1:53:36] accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers
[1:53:39] of those that are good, traitors, heady,
[1:53:42] high-minded, lovers of pleasure, more
[1:53:44] than lovers of God, having a form. Now,
[1:53:46] I want you to key in on this. Having a
[1:53:49] semblance or an appearance of godliness,
[1:53:53] but they deny. Notice denying. And that
[1:53:56] word denying there means to disown, to
[1:53:58] renounce, to decline, to refuse the
[1:54:01] power
[1:54:03] thereof from such turn away. So we see
[1:54:05] that these people, this is talking about
[1:54:07] our day.
[1:54:09] Paul is talking about this. They don't
[1:54:11] just think about in the first church
[1:54:12] age, but he's looking down into this
[1:54:14] church age and showing how man would be
[1:54:17] in our day.
[1:54:18] They're traitors. They're heady, high
[1:54:20] miners, covetous. They have a form. Oh,
[1:54:22] they can bless God. Oh, they can worship
[1:54:25] God. Oh, they can cry. But they deny the
[1:54:28] power to come down and quicken their
[1:54:30] life.
[1:54:35] Brother B would tell us in the testimony
[1:54:37] of a true witness, he said his word
[1:54:39] testifies in the last days, there will
[1:54:42] come a fallen away and there will come
[1:54:45] up a cold, formal, powerless church age.
[1:54:48] That's what we're living in.
[1:54:51] a church that had no power, having a
[1:54:53] form of godliness, but denying the power
[1:54:56] thereof, from such turn away. So if we
[1:54:59] deny the Holy Spirit in our lives, if we
[1:55:02] deny the Holy Spirit in our homes, if we
[1:55:05] deny the Holy Spirit in our churches and
[1:55:08] we we refuse to preach and believe in
[1:55:10] the supernatural, we will be a powerless
[1:55:13] people.
[1:55:16] We may look like a Christian. We may act
[1:55:18] like a Christian. We may go through the
[1:55:19] motions, attend church, go to special
[1:55:22] meetings, dress right. But without the
[1:55:24] spirit to quicken the seed, we will be
[1:55:27] cold, formal, and powerless.
[1:55:30] And what that means, powers means you're
[1:55:32] with not able to withstand the enemy.
[1:55:36] So, it's got to be more than just the
[1:55:38] mechanics of the word. There's got to be
[1:55:41] a power behind it that anoints it.
[1:55:47] Paul's preaching here in First
[1:55:48] Corinthians.
[1:55:51] Notice how Paul built the church.
[1:55:55] I know people want to struggle with
[1:55:56] where we are today as a message and and
[1:55:59] the people with emotion and excitement
[1:56:01] and you know, I I just say, man, if you
[1:56:04] ain't tried to try it.
[1:56:06] Don't knock it till you try it, right?
[1:56:10] I know it. Oh, I'm not accustomed to it.
[1:56:12] I'm not used to it. you stay long
[1:56:13] enough.
[1:56:14] That's right,
[1:56:15] man. Maybe that old that old Baptist
[1:56:17] footer get to clapping and stamping and
[1:56:19] all of a sudden you find yourself, man,
[1:56:22] enjoy and really enjoying the blessings
[1:56:24] of God.
[1:56:26] Cuz I remember when I first remember I
[1:56:28] told y'all the story when I first come
[1:56:29] to church here, I was old Baptist boy.
[1:56:32] We just sat down there and we listened
[1:56:34] and I came and y'all hollered and y'all
[1:56:36] shouted. I'm like, "Would these people
[1:56:38] just shut up?"
[1:56:41] I mean, I can't hear what the man
[1:56:42] saying. All this amening and praise the
[1:56:44] Lord and hallelujah and everybody
[1:56:46] clapping every other word.
[1:56:48] I'm like, man, I ain't going to get
[1:56:50] nothing out of this.
[1:56:52] Boy, was I wrong.
[1:56:54] God has a sense of humor, doesn't he?
[1:56:57] Yeah, little Baptist boy, now you're the
[1:56:59] one of the loudest ones in the church.
[1:57:03] But you just stay long enough.
[1:57:06] Stay long enough to allow that sea to be
[1:57:08] quickened. Yeah.
[1:57:09] Oh, that outer shell may not like all
[1:57:11] that emotion. That outer shell may not
[1:57:13] like all that that that fanaticism and
[1:57:16] or what you claim to be fanaticism, but
[1:57:18] if it ever breaks through that shell and
[1:57:20] that life ever begins to come out of
[1:57:22] that shell, out of that shell there, let
[1:57:24] me tell you, it'll dance its foot. It'll
[1:57:27] shout the hallelujah. It'll run down.
[1:57:29] Why? Because it ain't you. It ain't
[1:57:31] about you. It's about the light inside
[1:57:34] of that seed quickening that seed to
[1:57:36] eternal life.
[1:57:39] We don't come to church for oursel.
[1:57:43] No, it ain't about you.
[1:57:46] Some of you are already complaining in
[1:57:47] your spirit. Well, it's too cold. It's
[1:57:49] too hot. It's too They got my seat.
[1:57:56] Oh,
[1:58:00] I wasn't even going to say what I was
[1:58:01] about to say,
[1:58:04] but it's about him.
[1:58:06] It's always been about him.
[1:58:09] Turn your your frustrations and turn
[1:58:12] your criticism. Turn it away from your
[1:58:15] brother or your sister or your church or
[1:58:18] the preacher and turn it to praise and
[1:58:21] start praising him and worshiping him
[1:58:24] and glorifying him. And that seed on the
[1:58:26] inside will be quickened.
[1:58:31] God ain't going to quicken some critical
[1:58:32] spirit.
[1:58:36] Oh,
[1:58:38] he's just looking for one though how to
[1:58:40] turn that criticism aside.
[1:58:43] Listen, let's get back to the message.
[1:58:47] 1 Corinthians 2 and verse one.
[1:58:52] I brethren, when I came to you,
[1:58:56] now this is Paul.
[1:58:58] We respect Paul, right?
[1:59:00] We recognize Paul being the first church
[1:59:03] age messenger.
[1:59:05] We're going to establish some things.
[1:59:08] So, he was a first very intelligent man.
[1:59:13] But notice what he says.
[1:59:16] And I, brother, when I came to you, came
[1:59:19] not with excellency
[1:59:22] or elevation or superior superiority of
[1:59:26] speech or of wisdom,
[1:59:28] declaring unto you the testimony of God.
[1:59:31] For I determine not to know anything
[1:59:33] among you save Jesus Christ and him
[1:59:36] crucified. Otherwise, Paul didn't come
[1:59:38] to the pullpit with the Greek lexicon.
[1:59:42] That's right.
[1:59:43] And started explaining every little word
[1:59:46] in Greek
[1:59:47] and tracing it all the way back.
[1:59:50] See, Paul had already met God.
[1:59:52] He'd already been quickened. Listen what
[1:59:54] he says. For I determined not to know
[1:59:56] anything among you, save Jesus Christ
[1:59:58] and him crucified. And I was with you in
[2:00:01] weakness and in fear and in trembling.
[2:00:03] And my speech and my preaching was not
[2:00:06] with enticing or persuasive words of
[2:00:09] man's wisdom.
[2:00:11] Otherwise, I didn't come to captivate
[2:00:13] your emotions.
[2:00:14] I didn't come to to to to pull upon your
[2:00:18] affections and and talk about mama and
[2:00:20] get tears to come out of your eyes. Paul
[2:00:22] said, "I didn't come to you with that
[2:00:23] kind of speech, but I come to you with
[2:00:25] the power and demonstration of the Holy
[2:00:29] Ghost."
[2:00:32] Listen what he says. But in
[2:00:34] demonstration of the spirit
[2:00:37] and in power,
[2:00:41] that word demonstration,
[2:00:43] I'm not trying to dumb y'all down. You
[2:00:46] just got to know the way I study. I like
[2:00:48] to know the definition of a word. And
[2:00:51] since I got the mic, I get to share the
[2:00:53] definitions.
[2:00:55] But this word demonstration. So Paul is
[2:00:58] coming. Notice not with enticing words.
[2:01:00] Oh, Brother Joe, you don't spit. You
[2:01:03] don't slobber. You don't Man, you just
[2:01:06] so enticing.
[2:01:07] No, me and Paul just alike. We stammer
[2:01:10] and stumble and spit and get excited.
[2:01:13] Why? Because what we're bringing didn't
[2:01:14] come from oursel. It comes from God.
[2:01:17] And Paul said, "My speech didn't come
[2:01:18] with excellency. It didn't come with
[2:01:20] stammering or with enticing words of
[2:01:22] man's wisdom. He said, "But it come in
[2:01:25] demonstration." That word demonstration
[2:01:27] means manifestation.
[2:01:28] Indutable proof.
[2:01:31] What's that word indutable mean? How
[2:01:33] many know what that word means? Don't
[2:01:34] raise your hand cuz I know you don't
[2:01:35] know it cuz I'm going to tell you right
[2:01:36] now. You're about to know. So that word
[2:01:37] indutable here means impossible to
[2:01:40] doubt.
[2:01:41] It's unquestionable proof. What am I
[2:01:44] telling you this morning? Sister Labus
[2:01:46] when she was leaning on the everlasting
[2:01:49] arm and begin to run around the
[2:01:51] building. You can't tell me that that's
[2:01:53] not indutible proof.
[2:01:56] That's indutable proof. That's the word
[2:01:59] being quickened.
[2:02:02] And it wasn't just for Sister Atlanta,
[2:02:04] Sister Ruth, Sister Sharon, and Sister
[2:02:08] Jeanie. All cancer survivors.
[2:02:12] What is it? Indutable proof.
[2:02:16] Oh, they want to criticize. Come to Even
[2:02:19] Light Tabernacle. We'll show you a
[2:02:20] testimony.
[2:02:21] We'll show you a testimony.
[2:02:24] Think about it.
[2:02:26] Justin Wear,
[2:02:27] Philip Roni,
[2:02:30] Oh, Saints, particles, they can't return
[2:02:32] home.
[2:02:33] Oh, they straying. They done too much.
[2:02:36] But we got indutable proof
[2:02:39] that they can go a long ways. They can
[2:02:41] go a long time. But if there's a seed on
[2:02:44] the inside, the God of heaven will
[2:02:46] quicken that seed.
[2:02:56] Think about it. God used a water tower.
[2:03:01] Used a water tower to get Philillip.
[2:03:04] And you hear Philip's testimony, man.
[2:03:07] Him and Timothy wasn't on the best of
[2:03:08] terms.
[2:03:10] So, not only did he use a water tower,
[2:03:12] he used somebody he really didn't care
[2:03:14] for.
[2:03:15] But God don't care what you like.
[2:03:19] God's just determined to get the seed.
[2:03:22] Indutable proof.
[2:03:24] This is what Paul is saying. This is
[2:03:27] what my ministry is based on.
[2:03:30] It ain't based on my knowledge of all
[2:03:32] the Greek and Hebrew and all of this.
[2:03:34] It's about the manifestation. Will the
[2:03:37] word live? Can the word live? I say yes
[2:03:40] it will and yes it can.
[2:03:45] Indutable proof Mariah Puit's healing
[2:03:48] God restoring her glory.
[2:03:51] They said alipcia can't be cured. Maybe
[2:03:54] not by a doctor but by Dr. Jesus it can.
[2:03:58] Think about little Drew Dexter. What has
[2:04:00] that got to do with it? He was 18 months
[2:04:02] never walked. But it just shows that God
[2:04:04] is the God of the young
[2:04:06] and the old.
[2:04:08] He's no respector of persons.
[2:04:11] If you can believe, all things are
[2:04:13] possible.
[2:04:15] See, he is rich
[2:04:18] in mercy.
[2:04:23] And the prophet would say, "The angel of
[2:04:25] the Lord accompanies the message."
[2:04:29] So, I can just imagine
[2:04:31] every time Paul met somebody,
[2:04:35] the angel stood by.
[2:04:38] Y'all know what I'm waiting for.
[2:04:41] He is here
[2:04:42] now. I'll take every spirit
[2:04:45] under.
[2:04:45] He wasn't doing it under his human
[2:04:47] control.
[2:04:48] But he did it because the angel of the
[2:04:50] Lord showed up
[2:04:52] to do what? Because there were seeds
[2:04:54] predestinated souls in the congregation
[2:04:57] that were God was going to quicken their
[2:05:00] s their souls to life. And that same
[2:05:03] spirit, the same angel of the Lord, he
[2:05:07] accompanies the message today, church.
[2:05:09] He does.
[2:05:10] That's why we could tell stories like
[2:05:12] Sister Atlanta and different ones. But
[2:05:14] notice Paul said, "My my message or my
[2:05:16] speech, it wasn't with just enticing
[2:05:18] words, but it's demonstration
[2:05:20] proof that you cannot deny."
[2:05:23] That's right.
[2:05:24] That you cannot doubt.
[2:05:27] and notice and
[2:05:30] spirit and power. That word power there
[2:05:33] is dunamis. It's not only power to
[2:05:35] perform miracles, but it's power to live
[2:05:38] an excellent life.
[2:05:40] So, let me ask you, what good if you can
[2:05:42] speak in tongues? What good if you can
[2:05:44] cast out devils? What good is doing a
[2:05:46] supernatural if you can't live it?
[2:05:51] He wants to quicken you to live an
[2:05:52] overcoming life.
[2:05:55] And that's where Paul would say, "I'm
[2:05:56] crucified with Christ. Nevertheless, I
[2:05:58] live yet not I, but Christ liveth in
[2:06:00] me."
[2:06:02] It's Christ that lives in us, the life
[2:06:04] which I now live. I live by the faith of
[2:06:06] the son of God who loved me and gave his
[2:06:08] life for me. So we find Paul founded the
[2:06:11] church not on man's wisdom, not on their
[2:06:15] intelligence or their knowledge of
[2:06:16] diverse matters or their ability to
[2:06:18] learn science and learning and varied
[2:06:20] topics. No. But Paul founded the church
[2:06:23] on the power,
[2:06:26] on the manifestation of the word of God.
[2:06:30] And today we have mystery preachers.
[2:06:33] And when they get done, it's still a
[2:06:35] mystery.
[2:06:36] Man, they got all these types and
[2:06:38] shadows. And I don't know where they
[2:06:39] pulled them from, but it don't have
[2:06:40] nothing to do with us.
[2:06:42] But we find, but for the true bride, all
[2:06:45] the mysteries have been made known.
[2:06:48] See, Paul with his great intellectual
[2:06:50] understanding, he was a Pharisee of
[2:06:51] Pharisees, but he said at the feet of
[2:06:53] Galia, yet he said, "I count it all
[2:06:55] dumb."
[2:06:57] And with all his learning and his great
[2:06:59] intellectual bandwidth, he founded a
[2:07:01] church not on the wisdom of man,
[2:07:04] but on the power of God.
[2:07:07] And he warned the church in Acts 20 and
[2:07:10] verse 28. He said, "Take heof unto
[2:07:12] yourselves and to all the flock over
[2:07:14] which the Holy Spirit had made you
[2:07:15] overseers to feed the church of God
[2:07:17] which he hath purchased with his own
[2:07:19] blood. For I know this, that after my
[2:07:21] departing grievous wolves shall enter in
[2:07:25] among you, not sparing the flock."
[2:07:27] That's right.
[2:07:28] Also of your own selves shall men arise
[2:07:30] speaking perverse, distorted, turn away
[2:07:34] or perverted corrupt things to draw away
[2:07:36] disciples after themselves.
[2:07:40] And so we have seen this play out in our
[2:07:42] day.
[2:07:43] Men, women used to sit among us.
[2:07:46] Preachers used to preach this gospel,
[2:07:48] but then they begin to rise up and be
[2:07:50] able to divert, distort the truth
[2:07:54] because it hasn't been revealed to them.
[2:07:56] Oh, they had an intellectual
[2:07:57] understanding. It sounded good. And they
[2:08:00] went so far and so long, 10 maybe 15
[2:08:03] years. And you know, they preached the
[2:08:05] message for 10, 15 years or whatever it
[2:08:07] may be, but never was quickened.
[2:08:11] And if you never get quickened, you'll
[2:08:13] do just what they did and you'll turn
[2:08:15] away.
[2:08:15] And then you'll turn all your venom onto
[2:08:18] that seed
[2:08:19] and you complain and you criticize and
[2:08:22] you blame and you say it's not so, it's
[2:08:24] not real. Why? because the seed never
[2:08:26] was quickened. But can I tell you this?
[2:08:29] In Matthew 24:24 says that that there's
[2:08:32] going to be shall arise false Christ and
[2:08:34] false prophets. They shall show great
[2:08:35] signs and wonders in so much if it were
[2:08:38] possible.
[2:08:39] They shall deceive the very elect.
[2:08:42] So, I'm so glad that the Lord dropped
[2:08:44] that little two-letter word in there. If
[2:08:48] if it were possible. Notice he put a if
[2:08:51] in Satan's way. Otherwise, he's saying,
[2:08:54] Satan, it's not possible.
[2:08:57] My my seed, my predestinated will never
[2:09:01] be deceived. They will stay with the
[2:09:04] word. They will stay with thus sayeth
[2:09:06] the Lord, the prophet of God say on no
[2:09:08] account. For the scripture says very
[2:09:10] clearly in Matthew 24 that the elect
[2:09:13] cannot be deceived.
[2:09:15] He said, "No, no." He said, "The elect
[2:09:17] ain't going to be deceived." No, no.
[2:09:18] They won't be church members will, but
[2:09:21] not the elect. Aren't you glad this
[2:09:23] morning? You're the elected seed of God.
[2:09:25] God chose you in himself before the
[2:09:27] foundation of the world. He elected you
[2:09:29] to predestination to be quickened by the
[2:09:32] power of God.
[2:09:35] Oh, not the elect.
[2:09:37] He says church members will be but not
[2:09:39] the elect. They were chosen in him from
[2:09:41] the foundation world. They cannot be
[2:09:43] deceived. It's impossible. Hebrews 6,
[2:09:46] they will not be deceived. He said it's
[2:09:48] a dangerous time the church in the
[2:09:51] evening time because look he said
[2:09:52] they'll go they'll go to church almost
[2:09:54] just exactly like Pentecost believers
[2:09:56] they'll shout they'll dance they'll
[2:09:58] speak in tongues and everything else so
[2:09:59] close that it will deceive the very
[2:10:01] elect. That's why church
[2:10:05] the prophet prophet of God would tell
[2:10:07] you don't jump no higher than you can
[2:10:10] live.
[2:10:13] I mean, we want you to enjoy the
[2:10:15] presence of God, but we want you to have
[2:10:17] a life behind it.
[2:10:20] If you want to come in on Sunday morning
[2:10:22] and shout the entire time, shout, but
[2:10:24] make sure you got a life behind it
[2:10:26] shouting through you.
[2:10:28] If you want to get up and run circles
[2:10:29] the entire service, look, I'm not going
[2:10:31] to stop you. Run circles, but make sure
[2:10:33] you got a life behind you.
[2:10:36] Don't just get up and get caught up in
[2:10:38] their foyer of being a Christian or in
[2:10:39] the enthusiasm of the worship when he
[2:10:41] comes down. That's great. We want you to
[2:10:43] enter in, but make sure there's a life
[2:10:45] behind it.
[2:10:48] Make sure there's a life behind it.
[2:10:50] Notice in the Bible, it tells us here,
[2:10:52] Ephesians 2, and you hath he quickened
[2:10:54] who were dead in trespasses and sins.
[2:10:56] I'm gonna try to have you out of here at
[2:10:58] 1:30.
[2:10:59] That a deal?
[2:11:01] And the church said, amen.
[2:11:03] I'll be the church for y'all this
[2:11:04] morning.
[2:11:07] You had ye quickened, who were dead in
[2:11:08] sins and trespasses, where in times past
[2:11:11] you walked according to the course of
[2:11:12] this world, according to the prince of
[2:11:14] the power of the air, the spirit that
[2:11:16] now workketh in the children of
[2:11:17] disobedience, among whom also we have
[2:11:20] all, notice, we all had our conversation
[2:11:22] in time past in the lust of the flesh,
[2:11:24] fulfilling the desires of the flesh and
[2:11:26] of the mind, and were by nature the
[2:11:27] children of wrath, even as others. But
[2:11:30] God,
[2:11:31] who is rich in mercy, for his great love
[2:11:33] where he loved us. When we were dead in
[2:11:36] sins, he had quickened us together with
[2:11:37] Christ and has raised us up together,
[2:11:40] made us sit in heavenly places in Jesus
[2:11:42] Christ. Notice that power was from God.
[2:11:46] And God quickened us who were dead in
[2:11:49] sins and trespasses.
[2:11:52] Some of you maybe not been dead as some
[2:11:54] of the others.
[2:11:56] I look out here and I see different
[2:11:58] faces. Some of you come from hard
[2:11:59] backgrounds, hard lives. Some of you
[2:12:01] young people, you don't know what it
[2:12:02] means to live that kind of life.
[2:12:06] But it still takes the quickening power
[2:12:10] to come in and quicken that seed. And
[2:12:12] it's God rich in mercy. It wasn't done
[2:12:14] by a church. It wasn't done by some man,
[2:12:16] but it's done by the power of God. And
[2:12:18] Paul would tell us, "For our gospel came
[2:12:20] not in word only, but in power of the
[2:12:24] Holy Spirit and in much assurance." So
[2:12:26] he's saying that the manifestation of
[2:12:29] the signs and wonders is done because
[2:12:31] it's power, not intellect.
[2:12:34] I like great teaching.
[2:12:39] I like teaching that really grounds you
[2:12:41] on the word.
[2:12:44] But when you get grounded on that word,
[2:12:46] that means there's got to be a life to
[2:12:47] flow out from that word.
[2:12:50] And that's what teaching should do.
[2:12:52] Teaching should ground us.
[2:12:54] It should steady us
[2:12:57] so that you can go forth and build on
[2:13:00] that foundation.
[2:13:02] But if that teaching is not anointed of
[2:13:04] God, you have nothing to build on. Oh,
[2:13:07] you may have intellectual ideas and
[2:13:09] understanding, but it's not about
[2:13:10] intellectual ideas and understanding.
[2:13:12] It's not about how much you know the
[2:13:14] word, but it's how much you know the
[2:13:15] author of the word.
[2:13:19] whom the Bible would tell us, "And such
[2:13:22] were some of you,
[2:13:25] but you are washed." I like how brother
[2:13:27] Timothy brought that out the other day.
[2:13:28] "But you are washed. You're sanctified.
[2:13:30] You are justified in the name of the
[2:13:32] Lord Jesus by the spirit of God." And
[2:13:34] brother Brand would tell us in the
[2:13:35] invisible union, "What is sin? It's
[2:13:37] unbelief." He said, "The word unbelief
[2:13:39] in God." See, the word unbelief in God,
[2:13:42] which is the word, he says, "Your
[2:13:44] garments are washed by the water of the
[2:13:46] bleeding word. The word become blood and
[2:13:48] the word bled for you and washed you in
[2:13:51] the bleeding word. The life of God in
[2:13:53] the word and the word was bled for you
[2:13:55] and you might be washed from the filth
[2:13:57] of these prostitutes and be cleansed and
[2:13:59] sanctified by the washing of the water
[2:14:01] of the word and make your mind and heart
[2:14:04] stayed on God and on his word. He goes,
[2:14:07] you're not only that, but you're going
[2:14:09] to the wedding in the sky.
[2:14:14] Notice this is invisible union and you
[2:14:16] are wearing the wedding band of
[2:14:19] predestinated
[2:14:22] unmmerited
[2:14:23] grace.
[2:14:26] It means you wasn't born in a special
[2:14:27] family. It didn't matter. It mean you
[2:14:30] belong to a special church. It doesn't
[2:14:32] matter.
[2:14:34] It mean you didn't come in a special
[2:14:35] age. That really doesn't matter either.
[2:14:37] But you are wearing this morning the
[2:14:39] wedding band of predestinated
[2:14:42] unmarited nothing that you did to
[2:14:45] deserve it. Grace God saw you in his
[2:14:49] thoughts.
[2:14:51] And if God if you were ever in the
[2:14:53] thoughts of God, God will come and
[2:14:56] quicken that life. No matter how far, no
[2:14:59] matter what you go through, no matter
[2:15:00] the struggles you face, no matter the
[2:15:03] trends you you go through, God's going
[2:15:05] to come and wash you by the washing of
[2:15:08] the water of the word. And he says, not
[2:15:11] only that, but you're wedding wearing
[2:15:12] the wedding band of predestinated
[2:15:14] unmarried grace. God did it himself. He
[2:15:17] knew you before the foundation of the
[2:15:19] world. So he slipped the wedding band on
[2:15:21] you there. Put your name on the book.
[2:15:23] Oh, what a thanksgiving. Consider this.
[2:15:25] Since the blood of God is a perfect
[2:15:27] blood and a perfect blood is loosing us
[2:15:29] from the power and the bondage of
[2:15:31] defilement of sin, then the loosing is
[2:15:33] perfect and complete. Therefore, he
[2:15:35] says, therefore, there is now no
[2:15:36] condemnation. Who shall lay anything to
[2:15:39] the charge of God's elect. It is God
[2:15:41] that justify ye that rather that
[2:15:42] condemnth. See, it is Christ. He said,
[2:15:44] there it is. He his debt gave us blood.
[2:15:47] The blood has loosed us and there is now
[2:15:49] no condemnation. How can there be? There
[2:15:52] is nothing to be condemned for because
[2:15:54] the blood has loosed us from sin. We're
[2:15:57] free this morning. We're guiltless this
[2:15:59] morning. Don't listen to man. Listen to
[2:16:01] the word. You are loosed by the blood.
[2:16:05] He said when the first news came that
[2:16:06] his son Adam was lost. He didn't send an
[2:16:09] angel. He came himself to do what? To
[2:16:11] redeem his fallen son.
[2:16:14] And when he stood before the grave of
[2:16:16] Lazarus, a man who had been dead not one
[2:16:18] day, two days, three days, but four
[2:16:19] days, he's already began to decay. When
[2:16:21] the spoken word, the manifested word of
[2:16:23] that hour stood before that grave and he
[2:16:26] called Lazarus back to life. He
[2:16:28] quickened
[2:16:29] yes
[2:16:30] that seed
[2:16:32] and Lazarus walked out
[2:16:35] through the quickening power. But God
[2:16:37] wasn't done yet.
[2:16:39] Because when Lazarus walked out, he was
[2:16:41] wrapped in grave clothes.
[2:16:44] Grave clothes of his past. Past
[2:16:46] mistakes, past failures, depressions,
[2:16:48] anxieties, worries, guilt. He had all
[2:16:51] his past wrapped up on him. But when
[2:16:52] Jesus not only quickened him, but when
[2:16:54] he came walking out of the tomb, he
[2:16:56] said, "Loose him and let him go." And
[2:16:58] I'm here to tell you this morning,
[2:17:00] church, that same quickening power is
[2:17:02] the same word that has loose you from
[2:17:04] your past. It's loose you from your
[2:17:06] mistakes. It's loose you from depression
[2:17:09] and fear and anxieties and worries. He
[2:17:12] didn't just quicken you to come out. He
[2:17:13] quickens you to never go back.
[2:17:17] When you're quickened by that
[2:17:19] supernatural power, he changes your
[2:17:21] garments.
[2:17:23] He changes your nature. He changes your
[2:17:26] desires.
[2:17:28] You're not wearing grave clothes this
[2:17:29] morning.
[2:17:31] He's taking them off of you. Give you a
[2:17:32] change of garment. Give you a change of
[2:17:35] perspective. But notice,
[2:17:38] Paul didn't found a church on wisdom,
[2:17:41] man's ability to recite,
[2:17:44] but on the power of the message.
[2:17:47] See, Paul's gospel,
[2:17:49] he said it came with demonstration.
[2:17:53] What use of a message if it won't
[2:17:55] demonstrate it?
[2:17:57] What use is this message if it will not
[2:18:00] perform what it says it'll do? What use
[2:18:03] is the Bible if it will not live?
[2:18:07] Come on, church.
[2:18:09] What's the use? Why are we here? Because
[2:18:12] it works.
[2:18:14] Because it does live. So the spirit is
[2:18:17] what gives life.
[2:18:20] And if you're not quickened, notice
[2:18:22] brother tell us Paul being well trained,
[2:18:24] he knew the scriptures by the word. But
[2:18:27] you see scriptures, no matter how well
[2:18:29] you know them, if the spirit doesn't
[2:18:31] quicken them, then the letter killth.
[2:18:33] See the spirit give life. So it must be
[2:18:36] quickened or made alive by the spirit.
[2:18:37] If the spirit doesn't live in the word
[2:18:40] and make it a reality to you, then this
[2:18:42] just a letter. It's just intellectual.
[2:18:45] So, it's the spirit that gives
[2:18:46] revelation. And brother Bam says, "I
[2:18:49] don't care how religious you are." Or he
[2:18:52] says, "Satan doesn't care how religious
[2:18:53] you are, how right you are in your
[2:18:55] doctrine." If you miss that life,
[2:18:58] church, don't miss the life.
[2:19:01] He may come in and you may complain
[2:19:02] about this, that, and the other, and it
[2:19:04] may not be going right for you that day.
[2:19:06] Don't don't miss that life.
[2:19:08] Whatever you do, make sure you're there.
[2:19:12] See, the letter got to be quickened. Not
[2:19:16] just teach the word, but preach, make it
[2:19:17] manifest. The word has to be made alive.
[2:19:20] It's just a dead letter until it's made
[2:19:22] manifest. And then it's quickened and
[2:19:24] it's brought to pass what God said it
[2:19:26] would do. But you know, if the devil
[2:19:28] can't, notice what brother said. If the
[2:19:30] devil can't keep you from seeing the
[2:19:31] truth, he'll push you overboard with it.
[2:19:35] If he can't keep you from seeing it,
[2:19:37] he'll make you a fanatic with it. And
[2:19:40] you find he said the Methodists, they
[2:19:42] had the shout. The Pentecostals had the
[2:19:44] tongues. There was a group that had the
[2:19:46] shakers. And now we got a group of
[2:19:48] Methodist believers that push, play, and
[2:19:50] obey.
[2:19:53] Come on, church.
[2:19:55] We become fanatical with it. Don't hear
[2:19:58] anybody else disregard all the other
[2:20:00] four parts of the five-fold ministry. We
[2:20:02] got what we need right here. We become
[2:20:04] fanatical with it. Can I just put it out
[2:20:07] there? We do. Press play.
[2:20:10] We press play each and every day. I
[2:20:12] press play every day.
[2:20:14] We don't have another message to preach
[2:20:16] outside of God's vindicated voice for
[2:20:18] this hour.
[2:20:19] We're preaching William Brandon's
[2:20:21] message.
[2:20:23] We're pushing play in our bedrooms.
[2:20:25] We're pushing play in our car. We're
[2:20:26] pushing play on the job. We're pushing
[2:20:28] play in our free time. We're pushing
[2:20:29] play at the gym. Wherever we are, we're
[2:20:31] pushing play. We're feeding not on not
[2:20:34] on a man, but we're feeding on the body
[2:20:35] word of a son of man.
[2:20:38] We're doing it. But you know what
[2:20:39] happens is they begin to go overboard
[2:20:41] with it.
[2:20:44] You got to listen to it at a certain
[2:20:45] time. For some people that's 2 or 3:00
[2:20:48] in the morning.
[2:20:50] Let's keep going. We don't want to
[2:20:52] harper down on that. But theologians,
[2:20:54] brother says, theologians can rise today
[2:20:56] and they can explain the days of
[2:20:58] miracles as passed by the Bible. The
[2:21:00] infidel can rise and take the Bible and
[2:21:01] prove that you're that there's no God.
[2:21:03] The Mexicans can prove that they're
[2:21:04] right. The Baptist can prove that the
[2:21:06] Methodists are wrong. The Pentecostal
[2:21:08] can prove that they're all wrong, that
[2:21:10] they're right. But see, he there's a
[2:21:12] whole lot could be proved about
[2:21:13] Pentecostal, too. But let me tell you,
[2:21:14] brother, if a man ever stood on the
[2:21:17] sacred sand, let him be Methodist,
[2:21:19] Baptist, Pentecost, whatever more. If he
[2:21:22] ever met God face to face, there's no
[2:21:25] theologian in the world can take that
[2:21:26] away from him. He's been somewhere. He
[2:21:28] knows what he's talking about. He's had
[2:21:30] an experience of the burning presence of
[2:21:32] the living God and all the erasers of
[2:21:34] the scriptures explaining and and
[2:21:37] dividing away will never take that from
[2:21:39] his heart. He has been made new a new
[2:21:42] creature in Christ and become incarnate
[2:21:44] with the power of almighty. He was made
[2:21:47] alive in Christ. And he said that devil,
[2:21:49] the enemy of your soul, he can't tread
[2:21:51] on those sacred grounds where you met
[2:21:53] Christ.
[2:21:56] So that's what we're looking for today
[2:21:58] is for sons and daughters of God to be
[2:22:02] quickened.
[2:22:06] Jesus once and for all, brother Bam
[2:22:08] tells us, in fellowship, he has
[2:22:10] perfected forever
[2:22:12] those that come into fellowship with an
[2:22:14] eternal blessing, eternal fellowship,
[2:22:16] eternal presence of God with what? The
[2:22:18] power of the Holy Spirit. Not a symbol
[2:22:20] out yonder in some word or in some
[2:22:22] theology, but the Holy Ghost in you.
[2:22:26] The power of God that raised Christ from
[2:22:28] the grave is made alive in you and
[2:22:30] you're a new creature. Then you are a
[2:22:31] son and daughter of God. And that's what
[2:22:33] Paul said. Therefore, if any man be in
[2:22:35] Christ, he's a new creation. Old things
[2:22:37] are passed away and all things have
[2:22:39] become new.
[2:22:40] And if you're here this morning and
[2:22:42] you're not saved, I'm here to tell you
[2:22:43] it's not too late.
[2:22:44] That's right.
[2:22:46] Can I tell you this morning that it's
[2:22:48] not too late to become a new creature?
[2:22:52] This woman was 90 years old
[2:22:55] when the prophet led her to the Lord.
[2:22:58] Some of you may be here this morning
[2:23:00] thinking, "Well, I've sinned away my day
[2:23:01] of grace. I've gone too far. I've
[2:23:03] stepped over the line." Listen what
[2:23:05] brother Bram says here as we start
[2:23:06] wrapping this up. He says, "Howdy, sir."
[2:23:08] He says, "Now, there's something strange
[2:23:10] about you, sir. Satan has desired to
[2:23:13] take your life. You're all tore up. You
[2:23:16] think you've sinned away your day of
[2:23:17] grace. You think your life is ruined.
[2:23:20] Then listen what he asked. He says, "Do
[2:23:22] you love Jesus?"
[2:23:24] I'm sure the man replied, "Yes." He
[2:23:26] said, "What makes you love him?" He
[2:23:27] said, "Before there could be anything in
[2:23:29] there to make you love him, there had to
[2:23:30] be a creator to create that love in your
[2:23:32] heart."
[2:23:36] See, if you send away your day of grace,
[2:23:38] you would hate Jesus. That's right.
[2:23:42] For some of you that struggle, one day
[2:23:45] you're saved, next day you're not. One
[2:23:46] day you're saved, the next day you're
[2:23:47] not. I've sent away my day of grace. If
[2:23:49] there's something in your heart this
[2:23:51] morning that you love the Lord, he said
[2:23:55] there had to be a creator first to
[2:23:57] create that love.
[2:23:59] You've not sinned away your day. Listen,
[2:24:01] let listen what he says now. He says, he
[2:24:03] goes, "If you send away your day of
[2:24:05] grace, you would hate Jesus. But you
[2:24:07] love him." He goes, "You're all right.
[2:24:09] That's just the devil lying to you.
[2:24:11] You're nervous. Come here and I'll cast
[2:24:13] them away from you if you'll believe. Do
[2:24:15] you believe?
[2:24:17] Just a spirit that got on them.
[2:24:19] Now, let's let's show the other side of
[2:24:21] that.
[2:24:23] When you don't have a love for God, when
[2:24:25] you don't have any representation, when
[2:24:27] you send away your day of grace, he
[2:24:30] said, "This is how you'd be." He said,
[2:24:32] "Wait a minute." He goes, "I'm going to
[2:24:33] leave you." He said, he's talking to
[2:24:34] this young lady and he goes, "You
[2:24:36] remember that night, preacher? What you
[2:24:37] told me? God was giving me my last call.
[2:24:41] She said, "It's the truth and you have a
[2:24:43] privilege to tell anywhere you want it."
[2:24:45] She said, "But I'm forever lost. My
[2:24:47] heart has become so black that I can see
[2:24:51] my mother's my own mother's soul fry in
[2:24:53] hell like a pancake and laugh at it."
[2:24:57] That's stepping over the line of grace.
[2:25:02] That's a seed that'll never be quickened
[2:25:04] because there's no representation there.
[2:25:06] See he brother said that's the danger of
[2:25:09] rejecting Christ. See you get so hard so
[2:25:12] callous that you want nothing to do with
[2:25:15] it. But oh blessed be God says in John 1
[2:25:19] vers12 he says but as many as received
[2:25:21] him gave him the power to become sons of
[2:25:22] God.
[2:25:25] To those that believed on his name which
[2:25:27] were born not of the blood nor of the
[2:25:28] will of flesh nor the will of man but of
[2:25:31] God. So you were predestinated church.
[2:25:33] As we close, musicians, you can make
[2:25:35] your way if you would. In the invisible
[2:25:37] union, he says, "Jesus the word took my
[2:25:39] place. He became me that a sinner that I
[2:25:42] might become him, his word." He goes,
[2:25:44] "Let he let me hold true to it." Not the
[2:25:46] church, the word. The spiritual union of
[2:25:48] Christ and his church now when the flesh
[2:25:50] is becoming word and the word is
[2:25:52] becoming flesh, manifested, vindicated.
[2:25:54] Just what the Bible said would happen is
[2:25:56] happening in this day. He says we're
[2:25:58] near the coming of Jesus to be united
[2:26:00] with his church where the word becomes
[2:26:02] word. Call of the Holy Spirit searching
[2:26:05] the hearts. He says you're standing
[2:26:07] completely. You never sinned in the
[2:26:09] first place. God don't even know
[2:26:11] anything about it. It's in the sea of
[2:26:13] his forgiveness. You never did it. You
[2:26:15] were accused of it by the accuser. But
[2:26:17] really, from the beginning, oh
[2:26:19] hallelujah, church. From the beginning,
[2:26:21] you were predestinated to be a son and
[2:26:25] daughter of God. You were not
[2:26:27] predestinated to go down in destruction.
[2:26:30] But you were predestinated
[2:26:33] to be a son of God, to be a daughter of
[2:26:36] God to rise in victory.
[2:26:39] You are the pure, sinless, virtuous
[2:26:43] bride of Jesus Christ. Oh, hallelujah.
[2:26:46] That's who you are this morning.
[2:26:48] Predestinated to quickening power.
[2:26:54] You are the virtuous
[2:26:56] sinless
[2:26:58] pride.
[2:27:03] Pride
[2:27:05] of Jesus Christ.
[2:27:09] Oh church, some of you been longing
[2:27:12] waiting. He's already slipped a wedding
[2:27:14] band on your finger.
[2:27:17] Just look down, start admiring it. I
[2:27:21] remember when I proposed to Jessica
[2:27:22] there in Hawaii, man. I whipped out this
[2:27:25] box,
[2:27:29] born out wine sun glistening down on
[2:27:31] that ring
[2:27:33] and it was glistening.
[2:27:36] And she looked at me, "Did you ask my
[2:27:38] daddy
[2:27:44] said, "Girl, I wouldn't be in Hawaii if
[2:27:46] I didn't."
[2:27:48] And
[2:27:49] she looked at
[2:27:50] Oh, she was an admiring the ring. And if
[2:27:53] I can just get you this morning.
[2:27:55] Oh, just admire. Admire what he placed
[2:27:58] on your finger. Admire the ring that he
[2:28:00] placed on it. It's a wedding band
[2:28:02] predestinated unmarried grace. Nothing
[2:28:05] that you did, but he did it in himself.
[2:28:07] Let me tell you, you ain't got to worry
[2:28:09] about did you ask my daddy? He is your
[2:28:11] daddy. He is your father. He is your
[2:28:13] husband. He is your bridegroom. And he
[2:28:16] just wants you. Let's say I'm here to
[2:28:18] quicken you this morning.
[2:28:21] Admire what he done for you.
[2:28:27] Oh, let me close on this.
[2:28:34] Let me close on this.
[2:28:38] The law
[2:28:40] required
[2:28:42] a kinsman redeemer.
[2:28:46] church, the book of redemption,
[2:28:50] was closed.
[2:28:56] That book that we talk about today
[2:28:57] that's open, one time it wasn't open.
[2:29:02] It was closed and it had seven seals on
[2:29:05] it. And can I tell you, brother Tim, no
[2:29:09] man was found worthy.
[2:29:12] I mean, we got favorite preachers, but
[2:29:14] even our favorite preachers wasn't
[2:29:15] worthy open up this book.
[2:29:20] But the law required a kinsman redeemer.
[2:29:24] And your prophet said, "And grace met
[2:29:27] the requirement."
[2:29:29] Said, "Grace, God's grace met the
[2:29:32] requirements of a kinsman redeemer." He
[2:29:34] said, "The virgin birth produced
[2:29:38] the product."
[2:29:39] That's right. said what should have been
[2:29:41] there in the garden.
[2:29:43] He said the virgin birth produced it. So
[2:29:46] when John in Revelations 5 as we begin
[2:29:48] to close, you can stand with me this
[2:29:49] morning. When John began to look, he was
[2:29:53] looking at a closed book. He was
[2:29:55] wondering, it's the book of redemption.
[2:29:57] Will I be in there? It's the book of
[2:30:00] those that'll be quickened by the Holy
[2:30:02] Spirit, be quickened to a new life. And
[2:30:04] John wondered, John pondered. Job be to
[2:30:06] weep. God begin to cry because no man,
[2:30:09] brother Mike, was found worthy. That's
[2:30:11] right.
[2:30:11] No prophet down through the ages was
[2:30:14] found worthy to take the book,
[2:30:17] much less look at it.
[2:30:20] And John began to weep.
[2:30:23] Brother Jonathan, John began to cry.
[2:30:27] Oh,
[2:30:28] but there's a voice.
[2:30:31] There was a voice that come out said,
[2:30:33] "Weep not, John.
[2:30:35] Weep not." The lion of the tribe of
[2:30:38] Judah has prevailed.
[2:30:42] Can I tell you? He prevailed.
[2:30:44] He's prevailed not only to take the
[2:30:46] book, but to take all the seals off of
[2:30:49] it.
[2:30:51] You know, John didn't that like some of
[2:30:53] us. John just didn't come in there and
[2:30:56] close his arms when he saw that the book
[2:30:58] was was taken. Now, there was a man
[2:31:00] found worthy. And notice this man had to
[2:31:02] be kinsman. He had to be a man. He
[2:31:04] couldn't be an angel. So he couldn't be
[2:31:05] some supernatural. He had to be a man.
[2:31:07] There was only one man. God came down
[2:31:09] through the form of his son and he was
[2:31:11] the one that became the lion or the lamb
[2:31:13] of the the tribe of Judah there and he
[2:31:15] took the book. And when John saw that
[2:31:18] the book was taken, John just didn't say
[2:31:20] amen.
[2:31:23] No. When John recognized that when he
[2:31:25] saw the book become open and he saw his
[2:31:28] place in the word, he saw his place in
[2:31:30] redemption. He saw that he could be
[2:31:32] quickened. dies in everything in heaven,
[2:31:35] everything on the earth, everything
[2:31:37] under there. They heard I died shouting
[2:31:39] and screaming and worshiping. God wasn't
[2:31:42] ashamed to worship. God wasn't ashamed.
[2:31:45] He was in the presence of 24 elders, but
[2:31:48] he still worshiped God.
[2:31:51] He was in the presence of angels, but he
[2:31:53] still worshiped God.
[2:31:56] Everything,
[2:31:57] hallelujah,
[2:31:58] heard our shouting.
[2:32:01] Notice church as we close
[2:32:05] by one spirit we're baptized into that
[2:32:08] body.
[2:32:12] God deserves your worship.
[2:32:14] And he's coming. He's coming to quicken
[2:32:18] that predestinated.
[2:32:20] Quit looking at your failures.
[2:32:23] Turn away from your struggles. Turn away
[2:32:26] from your habits.
[2:32:28] Start looking into the opening of the
[2:32:30] word.
[2:32:31] Look for your name.
[2:32:34] Oh my. He says in one place it ain't the
[2:32:36] person that comes predestinated. It's
[2:32:39] the seed.
[2:32:42] Do you see your seed,
[2:32:44] brother Tim? Do you see your seed there?
[2:32:47] I always was. I always will be.
[2:32:52] Hallelujah. Let's just pray. Father,
[2:32:56] how we thank you this morning, Lord.
[2:33:00] Lord, you have predestinated a people,
[2:33:03] an end time bride, Lord, for quickening
[2:33:06] power.
[2:33:08] Lord, that we will we will pass off of
[2:33:12] this life, Lord, this this old earthly

[2:33:23] brought to life again. Lord, you sent us
[2:33:26] a message, Father, in this hour. A
[2:33:28] message of grace.

[2:33:33] you've given us.
[2:33:35] Lord, it's quickened my life, my heart,
[2:33:38] my soul to believe in. And I believe
[2:33:40] you're here this morning, Lord. Your
[2:33:42] prophet would tell us it wasn't only to
[2:33:44] quicken us, but it was quicken every
[2:33:45] promise to us this morning. Lord,
[2:33:48] there's promise of healing. There's
[2:33:49] promise of deliverance. this promise of
[2:33:51] salvation, promise of prodals returning
[2:33:54] home. All these things lay in that word,
[2:33:56] Lord, and you quicken it to us in this
[2:33:58] hour. And we're so thankful, Lord, we
[2:34:00] can be a people, Lord, that can see our
[2:34:02] names in that book, Lord, and recognize
[2:34:05] we're part of the promise. And I just
[2:34:07] invite you this morning now, Lord, let
[2:34:09] the word just be quickened. May it fall
[2:34:11] on fertile ground this morning, Lord,
[2:34:13] take this message, God, and just place
[2:34:15] it perfectly in the heart of the
[2:34:16] believer. We're so thankful. We love
[2:34:18] you. We just commit the service to you
