[0:00] [Music]
[0:12] We read of a man from a far distant
[0:17] land who wrestled with the angel all
[0:22] night. He prayed and he prayed. He
[0:26] stayed and he stayed. She put up a
[0:30] mighty big
[0:33] fight as the angel
[0:36] pou Jacob did say or dawn was a break in
[0:42] that
[0:43] day. My patience you've tested, but I
[0:48] need this blessing. I'm not about I'm
[0:52] not about to
[0:54] quit for 30 long days. Nobody can pray.
[1:00] The message to Daniel was
[1:05] shin. Now you'll be the feast for some
[1:09] hungry beast down in the old lion's
[1:15] d. Oh come the next morning. The king
[1:20] was running crying Daniel friend. How
[1:24] are you?
[1:26] Oh, king live forever. My God has
[1:30] delivered. And I'm not about I'm not
[1:33] about to
[1:35] quit. I'm not about to quit. I'm going
[1:41] to make it. Make it all the
[1:46] way. I'm not about to quit. If I can get
[1:51] to Jesus, he'll carry he'll carry me
[1:55] through.
[1:57] I may stumble down and times feel
[2:01] unworthy and sometimes I just feel
[2:06] unfair. But there's a one thing about it
[2:10] and I'm going to shout it. I'm not about
[2:13] I'm not about to
[2:16] quit. Now this battle I'm
[2:19] in, it seems so hard. At times I feel I
[2:24] surely will
[2:26] fall. For the mountains so high, it
[2:30] depresses my mind. When I think, oh, I
[2:34] think just how
[2:36] tall. For the rivers so wide and the
[2:40] valleys are low, as low as a man can
[2:44] get.
[2:47] Oh, but I will come out with a victory
[2:50] shout. Cuz I'm not about I'm not about
[2:54] to
[2:55] quit. I'm not about to quit. I'm going
[3:00] to make it. Make it all the
[3:05] way. I'm not about to quit. If I can get
[3:10] to Jesus, you'll carry you carry me
[3:13] through.
[3:15] See, I may stumble down and times feel
[3:20] unworthy. And sometimes I just feel
[3:24] un. But there's a one thing about it.
[3:28] And I'm going to shout it. I'm not about
[3:31] I'm not about to
[3:34] quit. I'm not about to quit. I'm going
[3:39] to make it. Make it all the way.
[3:45] I'm not about to quit. If I can get to
[3:49] Jesus, he'll carry he'll carry me
[3:53] through. I may stumble down and times
[3:58] feel unworthy. And sometimes I just feel
[4:03] unbear. But there's a one thing about
[4:06] it. And I'm going to shout it. I'm not
[4:10] about I'm not about to
[4:13] play. There's a one thing about and I'm
[4:17] going to shout it. I'm not about I'm not
[4:21] about to quit.
[4:27] [Applause]
