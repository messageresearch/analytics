[36:45] the battle and uh
[36:47] i want to speak to you this this morning
[36:49] on there shall be a time of trouble

[36:54] shall michael stand up
[36:56] the great prince which standeth for the
[36:59] children
[37:00] of thy people and there shall be a time
[37:03] of trouble
[37:04] such as never was since there was a
[37:06] nation
[37:08] even to that same time amen if you would
[37:11] view it in there and and with that last
[37:14] part of that verse in your mind it would
[37:16] look
[37:16] very dark but don't forget at the
[37:18] beginning he said at that time
[37:21] michael shall stand up say amen and at
[37:24] that time
[37:25] thy people shall be delivered
[37:28] every one that shall be found written in
[37:31] the book
[37:32] and many of them that sleep in the dust
[37:34] of the earth shall awake
[37:36] some to everlasting life and some to
[37:40] shame and everlasting contempt
[37:42] and they that be wise shall shine as the
[37:45] brightness of the firmament
[37:47] and they that turn many to righteousness
[37:50] as the stars
[37:52] forever and ever amen we let you be
[37:55] seated
[37:56] this morning speaking there
[37:59] speaking upon there shall be a time of
[38:01] trouble
[38:03] and it's very easy to get our eyes on
[38:05] the trouble
[38:06] it's very easy you know many times it's
[38:09] all that this natural eyes will pick up
[38:12] is the worst case scenario or as we've
[38:14] been speaking on casting down
[38:15] imaginations
[38:17] your mind always goes seemingly every
[38:19] time to the worst
[38:21] amen the worst case the worst problems
[38:23] the worst whatever
[38:25] but you know i i think i i i we're gonna
[38:28] deal with that a little bit but i
[38:29] also want to bring us to another part of
[38:32] in that time
[38:33] of the worst time ever michael will
[38:37] stand up
[38:38] in that time of the worst time of
[38:40] trouble
[38:41] peop thy people will be delivered amen
[38:44] and i
[38:45] and i want and i think our focus should
[38:47] be upon our deliverance
[38:49] because that's why we're here amen we're
[38:50] not here to go down into defeat
[38:53] we're not here to go down into death
[38:55] we're not here to go down
[38:56] amen into into everlasting shame and
[38:59] contempt
[39:00] but we're here for our deliverance you
[39:03] know and i thought it was interesting
[39:04] because
[39:05] i've always thought it interesting that
[39:06] brother branham would take
[39:08] for the rapture out of the for a rapture
[39:10] text he would take it out of psalms 27
[39:13] verse 1 it says the lord is my light and
[39:16] my salvation
[39:18] whom shall i fear the lord is the
[39:21] strength of my life
[39:22] of whom shall i be afraid when the
[39:25] wicked even my
[39:26] enemies and my foes come upon me to eat
[39:29] my flesh
[39:30] they stumbled and failed so in this time
[39:33] we can see
[39:33] fear is here we can see uh trouble is
[39:36] here
[39:37] we can see the wickedness here we can
[39:39] see the enemies are here
[39:40] but but in verse three though of hope
[39:42] shall encamp against me
[39:44] my heart shall not fear the war shall
[39:47] war eyes against me and this
[39:49] will i be confident even though i've got
[39:52] fear even though there's things to be
[39:54] afraid of
[39:54] even though there's wickedness all
[39:56] around us even though there's enemies
[39:58] and foes that are trying to destroy us
[40:01] of this i will be confident one thing
[40:03] i've desired of the lord
[40:05] that will i seek after that i may dwell
[40:08] in the house of the lord all the days of
[40:10] my life
[40:11] to behold the beauty of the lord to
[40:13] inquire in his temple
[40:15] for in a time of trouble he shall hide
[40:18] me
[40:19] in his pavilion and the secret of his
[40:22] tabernacle shall he hide me
[40:24] he shall set me up upon a rock
[40:28] amen what a comfort in the hour that
[40:30] we're living in
[40:31] because you know i don't believe that
[40:33] the time that we're living in is going
[40:34] to get any better
[40:35] i don't believe that we're ever going to
[40:37] go back to a time when we would consider
[40:40] normal anymore
[40:41] normality is all gone things are
[40:43] progressing very rapidly
[40:45] towards an end time amen towards the end
[40:48] of all time towards the end of but you
[40:50] know in that is a very wonderful
[40:52] thing because in the end time it's also
[40:54] as we know the end of strife it's the
[40:56] end of trouble it's the end of sickness
[40:59] it's the end of
[41:00] amen demonic oppressions but amen
[41:03] it's it is an end time but it's not our
[41:05] end time
[41:06] amen and you know and i don't want to
[41:08] put that upon like a fear or dread
[41:10] because
[41:11] for a child of god there is no end time
[41:13] it's only our really truly our beginning
[41:16] it's our beginning into the eternals
[41:18] amen in our beginning into everlasting
[41:20] life
[41:21] and this is what he would say in psalms
[41:23] 37 39 he would say the salvation
[41:26] of the righteous is of the lord he is
[41:29] their strength
[41:30] in the time of trouble and the lord
[41:32] shall help them
[41:33] and deliver them he shall deliver them
[41:36] from the wicked and save them why
[41:38] because they trust in him but we see
[41:41] gross darknesses upon the earth and we
[41:43] see that it's getting darker
[41:45] and darker and darker as we go on and
[41:48] spiritually speaking even in the
[41:49] spiritual realms it's even getting
[41:51] darker
[41:52] you know in political realms it's
[41:54] getting darker
[41:55] in every kind of realm around us amen
[41:58] physically spiritually politically
[42:00] it's all getting darker and darker and
[42:02] darker
[42:03] as we go further into this world that
[42:05] we're living in
[42:06] and when we wouldn't think that things
[42:08] would happen in a modern civilization
[42:11] amen it's getting worse and worse and
[42:13] worse amen why is it because
[42:15] gross darkness is upon the people amen
[42:18] brother brandon would speak that in
[42:19] shalom he would talk about the darkness
[42:21] the oncoming darkness that is coming
[42:24] upon this world
[42:25] and it's only getting darker amen it's
[42:27] only getting worse it's only getting
[42:30] amen more crime more ungodliness
[42:33] more homosexuality more perversion is
[42:37] only getting worse
[42:38] amen this this world is no hope we have
[42:40] no hope in this world
[42:42] we only have hope in another world to
[42:44] come and brother branham paints a pretty
[42:45] dark picture but he says
[42:47] now but upon those who have turned to
[42:50] light
[42:51] amen there's more is going to get
[42:53] brighter and brighter
[42:56] hallelujah said but those who will not
[42:58] turn to light there's only one thing
[43:00] that i can say for the coming year
[43:02] you're going to go into more darkness
[43:04] and the more darkness
[43:05] as the years goes on but to those who
[43:08] turn to the light
[43:09] you'll get brighter and brighter until
[43:12] that perfect day that we're looking for
[43:14] is appearing when all darkness will fade
[43:17] away
[43:18] what a day that'll be amen as the
[43:20] prophet said gross
[43:21] darkness upon the people and upon the
[43:24] people of the world gross darkness but
[43:25] he said have you noticed
[43:27] in these last years now this is in 64.
[43:30] and we can say it's it's a hundred times
[43:32] even worse than what it was even then
[43:34] he said some of you men and women around
[43:36] my age he said but
[43:37] look how each year it seems to get
[43:40] darker
[43:41] each year it seems to get darker now i
[43:44] know in 2020 it seemed to be a great
[43:46] leap in the darkness or the terrible or
[43:49] the time of trouble
[43:50] as it was the year before but i'm not
[43:52] sure that the next
[43:54] year won't be another leap amen because
[43:57] it's
[43:57] rapidly it's a junction that's taken
[44:00] place
[44:00] it's a darkness that has come upon the
[44:02] earth for to set an atmosphere
[44:04] for something to take place amen and so
[44:08] he said i've noticed you know that
[44:09] amongst the women he said you look out
[44:11] on the streets
[44:12] amongst the women you watch their
[44:13] desires the men you watch their desires
[44:16] what they like to do
[44:17] they're changing attitudes all the time
[44:20] men are becoming more like women women
[44:22] are becoming more like men
[44:23] seem like there's no way to stop it he
[44:26] says across the nation
[44:27] preaching the things that i'm preaching
[44:29] coming back the next year
[44:31] and it's only worse it's only worse he
[44:34] said
[44:35] them people want to do right but there's
[44:37] something about it that won't let them
[44:39] do right
[44:39] it's pressing down upon them it's a
[44:42] force coming down
[44:43] he said it's like a heavy dark fog
[44:46] upon the whole earth you know i was
[44:49] overseas one time and i was
[44:51] i was being talked to by a person that
[44:53] was apparently very proud about their
[44:55] country and they
[44:56] were down in the americans and how bad
[44:58] the u.s was and the prophet of god said
[45:00] this and the prophet of god said that
[45:01] i said yes i know amen america is going
[45:04] to burn but i said have you read the
[45:05] bible
[45:06] the whole world's going to burn this
[45:08] whole world is evil there's not a
[45:10] government here upon this earth
[45:12] that has a man a christian amen
[45:14] fortitude about them there's nothing
[45:16] christian about this world
[45:18] amen this world is going into it's
[45:20] plunging
[45:21] in the further and further into darkness
[45:24] he said it's
[45:24] and he makes a statement and this
[45:26] message says it's not only in phoenix
[45:28] which is
[45:29] where he's where he's preaching he said
[45:30] but it's all over
[45:32] the world there seems to be just groping
[45:35] darkness that's gathering
[45:37] getting more dense and more dense all
[45:40] the time
[45:41] it's trying to smother out real manhood
[45:43] it's trying to smother out real
[45:45] womanhood
[45:46] it's trying to smother out christianity
[45:49] it's trying to smother out everything
[45:51] that has
[45:51] anything to do with god amen he would
[45:54] speak about it in the world falling
[45:56] apart he said our world
[45:57] is in such a sadness right now it's
[46:00] polluted on every side
[46:02] there's no other way in the world it'll
[46:04] ever come back to itself again
[46:07] it can't do it he said we better take
[46:09] heed what we're doing in this day that
[46:12] we're living in
[46:13] because the world is again falling apart
[46:17] amen he said not only in america here

[1:00:05] spirit saith the lord
[1:00:06] that is our protection he said what a
[1:00:10] great glorious time it is
[1:00:11] to know that in all the sins and all the
[1:00:14] struggles
[1:00:15] and all the trials of life will soon
[1:00:18] be over it'll be all finished one of
[1:00:21] these days
[1:00:22] and we'll be home with the lord what
[1:00:24] time is left
[1:00:25] to the preaching the gospel and to bring
[1:00:27] that great tower to as much
[1:00:30] and as many as we can
[1:00:33] but we can read in first second timothy
[1:00:35] three and verse one
[1:00:36] this know also that in the last days
[1:00:40] perilous times shall come
[1:00:43] so if we can read the bible why are we
[1:00:45] surprised
[1:00:49] people get shocked even message people
[1:00:51] are shocked
[1:00:52] and you know they're screaming i pray
[1:00:53] for our country pray for
[1:00:55] brother branham back in the 60s said he
[1:00:57] wouldn't even pray for it said she's
[1:00:58] rotten she's rejected
[1:01:02] if you're praying for this country
[1:01:03] you're praying for a people that have
[1:01:05] rejected
[1:01:05] the lord totally outcast
[1:01:09] crucified him again had an opportunity
[1:01:12] started out as a christian country
[1:01:18] amen
[1:01:21] but listen what this perilous means it
[1:01:23] means
[1:01:24] hard to take it means hard to bear
[1:01:30] dangerous troublesome harsh
[1:01:33] fierce savage
[1:01:37] we're seeing a world turn into a bunch
[1:01:38] of savages
[1:01:41] there's nothing to hold them they can't
[1:01:42] even write they can't even have a good
[1:01:44] conversation just to
[1:01:45] talk about things and work things out
[1:01:47] know it's immediately to the streets
[1:01:49] burn every building down
[1:01:51] destroy everything around them makes no
[1:01:53] sense at all to me but
[1:01:54] destroy their own neighborhoods
[1:01:57] it's the truth and it's only going to
[1:02:00] get worse
[1:02:06] lawlessness he said because the men
[1:02:10] would
[1:02:10] for men shall be lovers of their own
[1:02:12] selves
[1:02:15] covetedness boasters proud blasphemers
[1:02:18] disobedience to parents unthankful
[1:02:21] unholy
[1:02:22] without natural affection have you seen
[1:02:24] any of this coming to pass
[1:02:26] truth breakers false accusers
[1:02:28] incontinent
[1:02:29] fears despise of those that are good
[1:02:31] traitors
[1:02:32] heady high-minded lovers of pleasure
[1:02:35] more than lovers of god
[1:02:37] having a form of godliness but denying
[1:02:39] the power there from such turn away
[1:02:41] for of this sort are they which creep
[1:02:43] into houses and lead captive silly women
[1:02:45] laden with sins
[1:02:47] led away with dr diver's lust ever
[1:02:49] learning
[1:02:50] and never able to come to the knowledge
[1:02:52] of the truth
[1:02:53] now janice and james underst withstood
[1:02:56] moses
[1:02:57] so do these who also resist the truth
[1:03:00] men
[1:03:01] of corrupt minds reprobate concerning
[1:03:04] the faith
[1:03:06] hard to bear troublesome harsh
[1:03:10] fierce savages
[1:03:14] god's word is a true witness we can read
[1:03:17] the word this morning say it's true
[1:03:20] never has a time been like the time that
[1:03:23] we're living in
[1:03:26] god's word said in the last days
[1:03:28] there'll be perilous times
[1:03:30] men's hearts would fail them for fear
[1:03:32] perplexities of times
[1:03:34] distress between nations there will come
[1:03:36] a falling away
[1:03:38] men would rise up showing themselves to
[1:03:40] be big dignitaries and so forth
[1:03:42] with power from the church have a form
[1:03:44] of godliness but deny the real power of
[1:03:47] god
[1:03:47] a bunch of church joining a bunch of
[1:03:49] creeds a bunch of dogma
[1:03:51] he spoke of a church getting that
[1:03:53] condition and we are witnesses
[1:03:55] that the word of god is fulfilled
[1:04:01] amen he said see what it is he said i
[1:04:04] challenge any man
[1:04:05] to show me any organization on fire for
[1:04:08] god
[1:04:08] filled with the holy ghost signs
[1:04:10] following him rise and tell me one
[1:04:12] anyone
[1:04:15] but they're powerless and dead
[1:04:22] to where now we've got the pope saying
[1:04:23] that homosexuals
[1:04:26] are okay
[1:04:29] we shouldn't be surprised because she's
[1:04:31] the cage of every unclean and hateful
[1:04:38] bird
[1:04:41] uh you know i was kind of wondering
[1:04:42] where he'd been all this time you know
[1:04:44] this great leader hadn't hardly said a
[1:04:46] word
[1:04:47] through this whole coronavirus you
[1:04:49] hadn't heard nothing out of it first
[1:04:50] thing he comes out and says he says
[1:04:52] that this world of com of a
[1:04:56] of free trade free trade does not work
[1:05:00] we need something different
[1:05:04] then he comes out and says homosexuals
[1:05:06] they're going to be okay
[1:05:13] looks terrible around us brother timothy
[1:05:15] but he also prophesied
[1:05:18] there'd be a real church in that day
[1:05:22] a little flock he said there would be
[1:05:26] and there will be there will be a people
[1:05:29] who know their god
[1:05:33] the whole world's turning away from me
[1:05:35] but there will be a people
[1:05:37] who know their god and will do exploits
[1:05:42] there will be a people with the power of
[1:05:44] god in her
[1:05:45] there will be a people with enough power
[1:05:47] in them that the loss can come
[1:05:49] and be saved not live in their sins
[1:05:53] but be saved hello save from their sins
[1:05:58] if i was drowning i'd want to be saved
[1:06:01] saved from drownings not still living in
[1:06:03] the water
[1:06:06] come on somebody saved from drowning is
[1:06:09] being taken out of the condition that
[1:06:11] you're here
[1:06:12] and being put in a new place this is
[1:06:15] what it means to be saved from sins
[1:06:17] not living your sins but to be removed
[1:06:20] from them
[1:06:21] and your sins removed from you as far as
[1:06:23] the east from the west
[1:06:25] there is a church that believes in that
[1:06:27] kind of power
[1:06:29] there is a church who believes that god
[1:06:31] still feels of the holy ghost
[1:06:33] that a man can walk through satan's
[1:06:35] eating and not be defiled from it
[1:06:37] but live above it
[1:06:42] i know we got fatalism in the message
[1:06:44] that says well we believe in
[1:06:45] predestination and what will be will be
[1:06:50] therefore go ahead and do all the drugs
[1:06:52] you want and all the drinking you want
[1:06:53] that is a bunch of baloney
[1:06:57] that's nothing but the lie of the devil
[1:06:58] speaking out of a lip
[1:07:01] of a man there is a power in the church
[1:07:05] that'll take drugs out of a man i got an
[1:07:08] amen here
[1:07:09] there is a power in the church that'll
[1:07:11] take cigarettes and drop them at your
[1:07:12] feet
[1:07:13] never to hold you anymore now i got a
[1:07:15] witness here today
[1:07:16] there is a power that'll break lust off
[1:07:18] alive there's a power that'll break
[1:07:21] every kind of spirit off of people amen
[1:07:23] and unchain them
[1:07:25] unhinge them take it all away there is a
[1:07:28] power
[1:07:30] and there is a people upon the earth
[1:07:32] that still believe it
[1:07:40] he said it would be therefore it will be
[1:07:45] hallelujah it will be turned back to the
[1:07:48] original
[1:07:49] that'll be turned back to the bible
[1:07:51] that'll get away from the organization
[1:07:53] and the nominations and go back to the
[1:07:55] first go back to the original pentecost
[1:07:59] i know there's some in the message don't
[1:08:00] like to hear that go back to the
[1:08:02] original pentecost
[1:08:04] to the original feeling of the holy
[1:08:05] ghost to the original power of god
[1:08:08] the word testifies that it'll happen the
[1:08:11] word prophesies it to be so
[1:08:13] therefore it will be there will be a
[1:08:16] people he said
[1:08:17] in the last days he talks about let's
[1:08:19] look at it malachi
[1:08:22] 4.
[1:08:26] five and six
[1:08:31] behold i send unto you and who's you
[1:08:35] amen i know there's some that don't want
[1:08:38] to say they want to say well this is
[1:08:40] just for the jews
[1:08:41] i'm i'm you you don't want to be you
[1:08:45] i'll be you
[1:08:46] behold i will send you elijah the
[1:08:48] prophet before the coming
[1:08:50] of the great and what
[1:08:54] dreadful it was a dreadful day when it
[1:08:58] came the first time
[1:09:00] politics was messed up people were all
[1:09:02] in up in arms
[1:09:03] it was all kind of chaos in the land and
[1:09:05] all of a sudden a star hangs over a
[1:09:07] place
[1:09:09] and people are going about their
[1:09:10] business and they're so caught up in the
[1:09:11] darkness and the romans this and the
[1:09:13] romans and rome
[1:09:14] and there's this is happening over here
[1:09:16] that's happening you hear what's on fox
[1:09:18] news today and let's don't see it
[1:09:23] all of a sudden there's a star up here
[1:09:26] there happened to be three men or
[1:09:28] however many men we think maybe three
[1:09:30] who knows how many
[1:09:32] i hope there's more than three but some
[1:09:35] wise men
[1:09:37] that saw it said there's something
[1:09:41] happening over there
[1:09:42] we got to go see what's going on
[1:09:47] i hope there's a star hanging over even
[1:09:49] light
[1:09:50] that people are saying something's going
[1:09:51] on there
[1:09:53] hallelujah i'll be that you before the
[1:09:56] coming of the great and dreadful day
[1:09:58] and he shall turn the hearts of the
[1:10:00] fathers to the children
[1:10:01] and the heart of the children to the
[1:10:03] father so it's in the bible
[1:10:05] so that there was a turning back in our
[1:10:07] generation look back to where we started
[1:10:10] the seed that went in the ground is the
[1:10:12] seed that's coming out of the ground
[1:10:15] and therefore if it's a life that went
[1:10:16] in the ground the same life follows all
[1:10:18] the way through
[1:10:19] the roots the tassels all the all the
[1:10:21] shuck all the way
[1:10:22] all the way back to seed again and
[1:10:24] that's where we're at back to seed again
[1:10:27] therefore the same power went to the
[1:10:28] ground the same power comes up
[1:10:31] the same life goes in the ground the
[1:10:32] same life comes up
[1:10:34] hello somebody it didn't go down a week
[1:10:36] and come up a cuckoo bird no
[1:10:38] it goes down a week and comes up a week
[1:10:41] hallelujah so the same power that was in
[1:10:43] the original church
[1:10:44] is now in the group of people in the
[1:10:45] last days and they'll know their god and
[1:10:48] do
[1:10:48] exploits they'll be a witness they'll
[1:10:52] recognize when the angel of god is
[1:10:54] moving through amen
[1:10:58] couple wednesday nights we had that kind
[1:10:59] of moment
[1:11:01] supernatural move of god and i'm here to
[1:11:03] testify from that moment my mom has
[1:11:05] never been the same
[1:11:09] we're going to rejoice about that
[1:11:10] because that's a miracle
[1:11:20] little drew got up here and sing this
[1:11:21] song with his daddy
[1:11:23] jesus is a waymaker amen let me read you
[1:11:26] a testimony
[1:11:28] three years now drew has had thyroid
[1:11:30] issues
[1:11:31] been on medicines to control his thyroid
[1:11:33] levels in those three years
[1:11:35] we've seen two specialists who were
[1:11:37] baffled how to handle his case drew has
[1:11:40] had a routine lab work to make sure his
[1:11:42] medicine is balancing his levels
[1:11:44] one and a half months ago i was getting
[1:11:45] so weary of the appointments and blood
[1:11:47] work
[1:11:48] i told dad brother tim well we need a
[1:11:50] miracle for drew
[1:11:52] drew look dad looked at me and said the
[1:11:54] waters are going to be stirred
[1:11:56] and when they are you'll know it and you
[1:11:59] take drew
[1:11:59] and you step in it he's going to have
[1:12:02] his healing
[1:12:04] last wednesday as my brother preached
[1:12:06] halfway through his sermon
[1:12:07] the spirit of the lord broke out and he
[1:12:09] said the waters are being stirred
[1:12:11] you better get in it i felt like i was
[1:12:14] pushed out of my seat
[1:12:15] i grabbed drew by the hand down the
[1:12:18] aisle we went i had no clue at the time
[1:12:20] we was only mid-service
[1:12:21] i just knew i was not going to miss the
[1:12:23] waters being troubled
[1:12:25] and stirred today we took doc
[1:12:28] drew to a new doctor as the one who had
[1:12:30] been going to it we'd been going to
[1:12:32] retire
[1:12:33] after going over three years of charts
[1:12:35] and recent blood works
[1:12:37] he said drew looks so good i believe his
[1:12:39] body will be able to regulate his own
[1:12:41] levels
[1:12:42] let's have the medicine for now and
[1:12:44] let's make a goal to get him completely
[1:12:46] off this
[1:12:48] medicine
[1:12:52] hallelujah
[1:12:56] it doesn't stop there drew has small
[1:12:58] bones and weak muscles just to know
[1:13:00] that those just know that those will be
[1:13:02] growing as normal too
[1:13:04] and the whole body is going to obey the
[1:13:06] word of lord
[1:13:08] and receive a total healing
[1:13:11] jesus is a waymaker
[1:13:15] if he can take the children of israel
[1:13:18] down through a red sea
[1:13:19] and down through a desert with no water
[1:13:22] and no food
[1:13:23] he can take you through coronavirus he
[1:13:25] can take to you through whatever
[1:13:26] sickness
[1:13:27] he can take you out of sin he can do all
[1:13:30] kind of things
[1:13:31] he is a waymaker
[1:13:35] how many hairs witness him to bid i know
[1:13:37] he's a waymaker
[1:13:39] i've witnessed him as a waymaker
[1:13:48] jesus would say in matthew 13 a sower
[1:13:51] went forth and sowed seeds
[1:13:53] and explained that he sowed them upon
[1:13:55] the earth
[1:13:56] and the enemy came and sowed tears
[1:13:58] behind them
[1:14:00] that enemy was the devil and the
[1:14:03] husbandmen the preacher
[1:14:05] said let's pull them out and take them
[1:14:07] out he said no no
[1:14:08] let them grow together now watch
[1:14:13] if a seed starts up by the side of
[1:14:16] of a weed they grow together and he said
[1:14:18] when the first shoots come forth
[1:14:20] they come forth both ways both of them
[1:14:22] grow and seize together
[1:14:23] and he says see they're getting both
[1:14:26] getting bigger
[1:14:26] and bigger and bigger he says we're
[1:14:29] always complaining
[1:14:32] i'm about to change this now we're
[1:14:34] always complaining
[1:14:35] about the world and how wicked the world
[1:14:38] is getting
[1:14:39] he said but don't you forget to realize
[1:14:42] how much more powerful
[1:14:44] the church is getting
[1:14:48] it ain't just weeds growing it ain't
[1:14:51] just devils getting greater seemingly
[1:14:53] more
[1:14:54] all the time the weed is growing

[1:15:02] how bad the world is
[1:15:04] how the booklet joints and the whiskey
[1:15:06] and the legalized drinking and the
[1:15:08] gambling and the prostitution and
[1:15:10] everything that's going on

[1:15:13] don't fail to look where the church is
[1:15:16] to

[1:15:20] appearing everywhere
[1:15:21] she's putting out seeds too we're nearly
[1:15:24] there

[1:16:15] yeah pentecostals
[1:16:19] catholics whatever
[1:16:23] you are or whatever you were
[1:16:27] if you're born again you're sons and
[1:16:29] daughters of god
[1:16:32] and he said if you are born again we
[1:16:35] believe in the phenomena
[1:16:38] amen we believe in divine healing
[1:16:41] we believe in the power of god and we
[1:16:45] see him working with signs and wonders
[1:16:48] he said but if we're not careful we
[1:16:50] always talk about how bad the world is
[1:16:52] how wicked the world is but look how
[1:16:54] great the church is getting all the time
[1:17:00] hello somebody we fail to look at that
[1:17:03] side
[1:17:03] jesus said let them grow together so if
[1:17:06] the world is getting more wicked
[1:17:08] and more wicked and more wicked the
[1:17:11] church
[1:17:11] is getting more powerful and more
[1:17:14] powerful and more powerful
[1:17:17] hallelujah therefore if we see the world
[1:17:20] where it is
[1:17:20] we ought to see the church where she is
[1:17:23] and where she is
[1:17:24] there's a phenomenal and where she is
[1:17:27] the miracles are taking place
[1:17:29] and where she is the dead are being
[1:17:31] raised and where she is
[1:17:33] the healing is taking place in the body
[1:17:35] and where she is
[1:17:36] the sinners are finding their way to
[1:17:38] christ where she is
[1:17:45] so let's just don't go out of here where
[1:17:47] the heads down
[1:17:49] how bad the world's getting that ain't
[1:17:50] what this mess is about
[1:17:52] in the time of trouble he's standing up
[1:17:56] in the time of trouble his people's
[1:17:59] going to be delivered
[1:18:02] we could see that all the way through
[1:18:03] the scripture we had the time you could
[1:18:05] you can watch it brother brad what he
[1:18:06] used he would use it like they said in
[1:18:08] the darkest hour
[1:18:10] that's when jesus comes
[1:18:14] it's got to get dark
[1:18:17] because he's coming as a thief in the
[1:18:19] night
[1:18:23] did you hear me he's coming as a thief
[1:18:26] in
[1:18:26] the night he didn't say in the day he
[1:18:28] said in the night
[1:18:30] dark gonna come in
[1:18:33] catch his people away and be gone and
[1:18:36] the world know nothing about it
[1:18:38] rioting contingents on the streets
[1:18:40] earthquakes and divers places
[1:18:42] all kinds of calamity upon the earth and
[1:18:43] it all of a sudden it seems to go into
[1:18:45] turbo
[1:18:46] three and a half years worse worse worse
[1:18:48] until it ends
[1:18:50] but meanwhile where's the bride
[1:18:57] hallelujah sheltered in the arms of
[1:19:01] jesus
[1:19:05] so we we failed sometimes to realize how
[1:19:08] powerful
[1:19:09] the church is getting he said don't
[1:19:12] forget when the enemy comes in like a
[1:19:14] flood
[1:19:14] the spirit of god will raise a standard
[1:19:17] up against it
[1:19:18] the winds are blowing just set your
[1:19:21] sails
[1:19:23] move right into the face of the storm
[1:19:26] why do you care what the storm is doing
[1:19:30] who's the captain he's been through a
[1:19:33] lot of storms
[1:19:37] and he ain't lost the boat
[1:19:41] oh my god that ought to make us shout
[1:19:44] just for a moment
[1:19:45] to think about the storm if you just go
[1:19:47] through your mind the storm after storm
[1:19:49] the darkest hour after darkest hour
[1:19:51] and he never lost a person he never lost
[1:19:54] a boat
[1:19:55] he never lost he never loses
[1:19:58] he never will
[1:20:01] he said all that are mine will come
[1:20:05] what confidence he has in his word to
[1:20:07] speak that
[1:20:08] knowing how dark it was going to get
[1:20:10] knowing how bad it was going to be
[1:20:12] how terrible the earth was going to be
[1:20:14] but all that are mine will come
[1:20:19] but the politics all that are mine will
[1:20:21] come but the problems all that mind
[1:20:23] there comes
[1:20:25] but the sicknesses and the pandemic all
[1:20:27] that are mine will come hallelujah
[1:20:32] when the enemy comes in like a flood the
[1:20:34] spirit of god will raise a standard up
[1:20:36] against it
[1:20:37] you know some time ago i preached on
[1:20:38] that you know i actually found where
[1:20:40] their
[1:20:41] their cereal a lot back for long time
[1:20:43] theologians are arguing over the
[1:20:45] translations because they said the
[1:20:46] common was put in the wrong place
[1:20:48] you know when the enemy comes in like a
[1:20:50] flood they say the bible says it like a
[1:20:52] flood comma
[1:20:53] he'll raise a standard but they said the
[1:20:56] actual it should have been when the
[1:20:58] enemy comes in
[1:20:59] comma like a flood he'll raise the
[1:21:00] standard
[1:21:03] did you understand but it really doesn't
[1:21:06] matter where the comet is the standard's
[1:21:08] still there
[1:21:11] and the standard is greater than any
[1:21:12] flood the devil's got
[1:21:15] the standard will overcome no matter
[1:21:17] what the devil as we've been saying
[1:21:18] through this year the devil ain't got
[1:21:20] enough
[1:21:21] amen the church is getting more and more
[1:21:24] powerful all the time
[1:21:26] move right into the face of the storm
[1:21:29] why do you care who's the captain
[1:21:31] he will take care of it he'll tell you
[1:21:34] once again don't fear
[1:21:35] i'm here with you he said i want you to
[1:21:37] understand as they were talking about
[1:21:39] the sower again
[1:21:40] he said let them grow together as the
[1:21:42] church
[1:21:43] natural begins to get formal and ungodly
[1:21:46] the church spiritual is receiving great
[1:21:49] gifts
[1:21:50] and powers from above
[1:21:53] so we see the church world what it's
[1:21:54] doing what are we to be receiving
[1:21:59] great gifts and powers from above
[1:22:03] they're both going into seed as the
[1:22:05] world gets more wicked
[1:22:07] the church is getting more powerful he
[1:22:09] said i don't mean all this called church
[1:22:11] i mean the church the born-again
[1:22:14] believers
[1:22:15] not by membership but by one's spirit
[1:22:18] we're all baptized
[1:22:19] into one body he said i believe the
[1:22:21] hours approaching now
[1:22:23] where missing limbs will be restored
[1:22:27] that's some gifts that's some power in
[1:22:30] the church
[1:22:30] where missing limbs will be restored the
[1:22:33] glorious
[1:22:34] power of the creator in his bride
[1:22:42] listen if he can make a squirrel appear
[1:22:45] not just a limb of a squirrel but a
[1:22:47] whole body up here
[1:22:50] he could take fish that were that were
[1:22:52] in a little boy he brought for lunch and
[1:22:54] he could break them apart
[1:22:56] and then and and and in that another
[1:22:57] piece would appear amen fully cooked

[1:24:49] of the church in position where the
[1:24:51] fullness of the power of the holy ghost
[1:24:53] is in the church
[1:24:55] then critics mouths will be shut
[1:25:01] hallelujah
[1:25:08] but we need to set our faith on one
[1:25:11] thing
[1:25:12] thus saith the lord
[1:25:15] in this darkest hour we can't set our
[1:25:17] faith in politics
[1:25:20] there's nothing here to save us we can't
[1:25:23] set our
[1:25:24] our faith in anything on this earth
[1:25:28] to do with this earth humanly speaking
[1:25:30] there's not a human on this earth
[1:25:31] there's not a superhuman on this earth
[1:25:33] that's got enough superpowers or super
[1:25:34] money or super anything
[1:25:36] to save this place she's going down
[1:25:39] there's only one place to set our faith
[1:25:41] it's on thus saith the lord
[1:25:44] and when you're on thus saith the lord
[1:25:46] no matter what comes
[1:25:48] no matter what goes no matter whether

[1:25:54] the next day they're making fun of you
[1:25:56] the next day they say you're crazy
[1:25:58] you endure because your faith is not on
[1:26:03] anything around here that's shaken
[1:26:05] your faith is not even on your own
[1:26:06] mind's ability
[1:26:08] your faith is not on your reasonings and
[1:26:10] how you got it all figured out
[1:26:11] how it's go well i believe it's going to
[1:26:13] do this brother timothy and this one's
[1:26:14] going to win
[1:26:15] it's going to turn us over here and

[1:26:49] stand on thus
[1:26:50] saith the lord where did jesus stand on
[1:26:54] it is written
[1:26:55] thus saith the lord it is written
[1:27:00] that's the only place we have to stand
[1:27:02] god is making it to where people cannot
[1:27:04] stand upon their own abilities
[1:27:06] they cannot depend upon their own on on
[1:27:09] on things they've done the kingdoms they
[1:27:11] built
[1:27:12] the money they got in their 401ks the
[1:27:14] retirement plans they got

[1:27:56] no matter if he was in the storm and the
[1:28:00] gales knocking the boat from one side to
[1:28:01] the other

[1:28:04] face of a bunch of demons
[1:28:06] if he was if they was hanging everywhere
[1:28:08] it never moved him
[1:28:10] he walked right along as calm and quiet
[1:28:12] as he could be why
[1:28:14] he was simply unconscious to fear in
[1:28:17] anything around him

[1:29:13] that covenant that he gave you and he
[1:29:15] can confirm it with you

[1:29:23] patches
[1:29:25] it may turn around and seem like oh all
[1:29:27] of a sudden

[1:29:32] but don't change walk with god
[1:29:36] in the good times you walk with god in
[1:29:39] the bad times
[1:29:40] you walk with god whether you're healed
[1:29:42] or whether you're sick whether you're up
[1:29:44] whether you're down
[1:29:44] whether you're discouraged or you're

[1:29:48] walk with god with thus saith the lord
[1:29:52] amen you'll have it you'll go over sharp
[1:29:54] rocks over bluffs over hillsides
[1:29:56] up and down mountains over waters but
[1:29:58] you just keep walking with god
[1:30:00] there's so many hills to climb you've
[1:30:01] heard the old song how little it seemed
[1:30:03] when you get to the end of the road
[1:30:05] just why just keep looking at god keep
[1:30:08] walking with god
[1:30:09] amen god is moving even now
[1:30:13] amen you mean i can see nothing but
[1:30:15] don't fear god is still moving
[1:30:18] god is still in the building god is
[1:30:20] killing his people
[1:30:25] just as they were at a at you know
[1:30:27] brother brown will take it in the
[1:30:28] junctions and we're at another junction
[1:30:33] there's so many junctions that you can
[1:30:34] go through but you can go through the
[1:30:36] you know one of the major drug junctions
[1:30:38] was when jesus came upon the earth that
[1:30:40] was a major junction
[1:30:42] and then now again as he returns it's
[1:30:44] another major junction
[1:30:47] but listen to this right here
[1:30:51] at every junction
[1:30:55] omnipotence speaks
[1:30:59] i know everybody else is speaking
[1:31:03] every kind of demon is screaming what
[1:31:06] are they trying to do
[1:31:07] to keep you from hearing the voice
[1:31:11] to clog up your channels in your mind to
[1:31:14] where
[1:31:15] you don't hear him when he speaks
[1:31:19] when omnipotence speaks miracles happen
[1:31:26] omnipotence has spoke at every junction
[1:31:29] when the church cooled off omnipotence
[1:31:32] speaks
[1:31:33] miracles take place this is a junction
[1:31:36] of all junctions this is the end time
[1:31:41] the end of the whole history of the
[1:31:42] world is right now at hand
[1:31:45] so you can expect omnipotence to speak
[1:31:51] did you hear that omnipotent spoke the
[1:31:55] other night
[1:31:58] listen if i was one of you that walked
[1:31:59] into the water i would just be expecting
[1:32:01] the same news drew god
[1:32:04] because he was in the same waters
[1:32:09] hallelujah amen
[1:32:12] he says right at the end of the world
[1:32:14] history of the world
[1:32:16] so you can expect omnipotence to speak
[1:32:21] what can we expect brother timothy what
[1:32:23] are we expecting out of this
[1:32:24] election what are we expecting in the
[1:32:26] next year what are we expecting what
[1:32:29] what you can expect you want to hear
[1:32:31] what you can expect
[1:32:34] the greatest and mighty its miracles
[1:32:37] that's ever happened on the earth will
[1:32:39] happen in the next few years to come
[1:32:52] people are so worried what can we expect
[1:32:55] i'm expecting miracles
[1:32:59] i'm expecting such a miracle that's
[1:33:01] going to take place
[1:33:02] that a body is going to change
[1:33:06] all of a sudden gray hairs are going to
[1:33:08] fall off

[1:33:15] earth gravity taking their play
[1:33:17] and pulling you down the earth all of a
[1:33:19] sudden that's going to change
[1:33:22] and you're going to take one step walk
[1:33:24] with god

[1:33:31] how many years did any walk
[1:33:35] years hundreds of years he walked with
[1:33:38] god

[1:33:45] every moment he's walking going to his
[1:33:48] job
[1:33:51] going and doing things as a normal man
[1:33:54] would do
[1:33:56] having a normal day but he's walking
[1:33:57] with god

[1:34:03] he had bad days he had rough days he had
[1:34:06] days he didn't know if he was going to
[1:34:07] make it out of
[1:34:08] he didn't know if it was going to be
[1:34:09] another day but he's just walking with
[1:34:11] god
[1:34:13] 100 years ago by walking with god
[1:34:16] 200 years go by walking with god 300
[1:34:19] years ago by
[1:34:20] walking with god but that last few
[1:34:23] months is coming

[1:34:31] minutes are coming
[1:34:32] last few seconds are coming and all of a
[1:34:34] sudden

[1:34:41] his old body is no longer there
[1:34:47] he's changed it's a new man again
[1:34:51] he put on new clothes his thinking no
[1:34:54] longer is fear and dread and worry about
[1:34:56] what the next day's gonna hold

[1:39:19] and rejoicing and thanking god for his
[1:39:22] mercy and his grace
[1:39:24] and his loving kindness we are at that
[1:39:26] junction
[1:39:34] he said it's the great junction it's one
[1:39:36] of the main
[1:39:37] junctions that's ever happened the
[1:39:39] greatest of junctions
[1:39:40] we're coming to the time
[1:39:44] talking about he was even talking about
[1:39:46] even the junction let me back back up a
[1:39:47] little bit he's talking about the
[1:39:48] junction when jesus came
[1:39:50] the time when the sin question be
[1:39:51] settled the time and the miraculous must
[1:39:54] make himself fully understand there's
[1:39:56] coming a time when men's hearts had to
[1:39:57] be changed because the laws and the
[1:39:59] judges and so forth couldn't do it
[1:40:00] the blood and goats couldn't do it just
[1:40:02] before that great judgment came the
[1:40:04] devil came amongst the preachers and
[1:40:05] began to say
[1:40:06] days of miracles are passed there's no
[1:40:08] such a thing same thing we've heard in
[1:40:10] this junction
[1:40:11] it's the same time that ain't at the
[1:40:13] same time angels are sent to the earth
[1:40:15] and here's this man down there making
[1:40:16] intercessions for for the people of god
[1:40:19] and a great angel shows up proving the
[1:40:21] junction of time was at hand
[1:40:23] he told him he would bring forth a boy
[1:40:25] from his wife which is old and stricken
[1:40:27] in age
[1:40:28] the bible said jesus said himself
[1:40:30] there's never a man born on the earth
[1:40:31] like
[1:40:32] under john of that time he was a prophet
[1:40:34] the greatest there was that time because
[1:40:36] it was the greatest junction
[1:40:37] that god had ever made with the devil
[1:40:39] when their paths would cross
[1:40:41] and in that path he would strip him and
[1:40:43] rob him of everything he had
[1:40:46] amen in every junction god wins satan
[1:40:49] loses
[1:40:50] hallelujah john was a prophet gabriel
[1:40:53] was an angel
[1:40:54] they were appearing at a junction time
[1:40:56] glory to god about 33 years before it
[1:40:59] happened god started plenty time to
[1:41:00] forerun them
[1:41:01] a junction time was at hand tried to get
[1:41:04] it away
[1:41:05] tried to get it away finally it killed
[1:41:06] every everyone that said anything but
[1:41:09] satan did and fussed it and began to
[1:41:10] bring up fusses and drive tried to drown
[1:41:12] and
[1:41:12] unbelievers beginning to wax worse satan
[1:41:15] was trying to help make them miss the
[1:41:17] junction but
[1:41:18] god moved in a miraculous just the same
[1:41:21] for he's
[1:41:21] omnipotent he said look what's taking
[1:41:25] place
[1:41:25] now as we move to this junction
[1:41:28] we see john coming up the river
[1:41:30] preaching he's telling
[1:41:32] one that's coming mightier than he
[1:41:34] begins to preach
[1:41:35] he begins to talk about jesus and all of
[1:41:37] a sudden he steps out
[1:41:39] into the place and omnipotence was made
[1:41:41] flesh and it dwelt among us
[1:41:43] as he walked the shores of galilee the
[1:41:45] little boat tossed about he acted like
[1:41:47] he didn't even pay no attention
[1:41:49] here he's tired but it came a junction
[1:41:51] of time something had to happen
[1:41:53] he put his foot on the brell of the boat
[1:41:55] and looked up and said peace be
[1:41:57] still the very creator of the heavenly
[1:42:00] earth laid that
[1:42:01] boat and nature had to obey it why when
[1:42:04] the junction comes omnipotent speaks
[1:42:07] and miraculous takes place amen we can
[1:42:10] see it all the way down in that junction
[1:42:13] miraculous the leper miraculous amen
[1:42:16] lazarus in the grave omnipotence speaks
[1:42:18] miraculous takes place it was miraculous
[1:42:21] after miraculous after miraculous why
[1:42:23] omnipotence was speaking
[1:42:27] but here we are at our junction here we
[1:42:30] are right now at this time
[1:42:32] and we can tell hell is gathering this
[1:42:34] place
[1:42:35] spirits of every time kind is coming in
[1:42:38] trying to bring thrusters and divisions
[1:42:40] and uh sin is rising up on every hand
[1:42:42] sickness on every hand
[1:42:43] what is it it's trying to get people to
[1:42:46] miss a junction
[1:42:48] but in the middle of it omnipotence is
[1:42:50] going to speak
[1:42:52] in the middle of it there's going to be
[1:42:54] a spell of voices speaks out
[1:42:56] and says peace be still in the middle of
[1:42:59] it there's gonna be a voice that says
[1:43:01] lazarus
[1:43:01] come forth
[1:43:10] people are seeing signs and wonders
[1:43:14] they're seeing things taking place but
[1:43:16] they're scoffing at it
[1:43:18] they're mocking at it they're laughing
[1:43:20] about it
[1:43:21] just like they did when at the junction
[1:43:23] of noah
[1:43:25] destruction was just before them and
[1:43:27] they're laughing
[1:43:29] and they're making fun and they're
[1:43:31] saying ha ha ha
[1:43:33] crazy noah and crazy people believe a
[1:43:37] prophet who's been
[1:43:38] gone 55 years crazy crazy crazy
[1:43:42] well noah believes something that he
[1:43:44] heard 120 years before
[1:43:52] and he just went on walking with god and
[1:43:55] all of a sudden omnipotence spoke
[1:43:57] direction destruction fell and millions
[1:44:00] died
[1:44:04] omnipotence when it speaks
[1:44:09] it'll change you it'll take a drunkard
[1:44:12] cigarette smoker a runner to the dances
[1:44:16] chain and carry it on like that but once
[1:44:18] omnipotent speaks
[1:44:21] the miraculous takes place and it'll
[1:44:24] change a life that was headed for death
[1:44:26] and hell
[1:44:27] back to life again omnipotence speaks
[1:44:31] miraculous takes place it is speaking
[1:44:35] even today
[1:44:36] omnipotences spoke
[1:44:40] and brain bleeds move away
[1:44:44] omnipotent speaks and thyroid issues
[1:44:48] vanish doctors don't know what to do
[1:44:51] with
[1:44:52] omnipotence speaks and cancer vanishes
[1:44:55] omnipotent speaks and alopecia vanishes
[1:45:02] oh that don't mean it ain't gonna come
[1:45:04] scratching back
[1:45:06] but he's defeated
[1:45:10] omnipotence speak and hearts are changed
[1:45:17] cigarettes fall off omnipotence moves
[1:45:22] we're at a junction we ought to be
[1:45:25] expecting
[1:45:26] omnipotence to speak we ought to be
[1:45:29] expecting more than any people on the
[1:45:30] face of this earth
[1:45:32] miracles to take place healings to take
[1:45:35] place
[1:45:36] deliverances to take place perhaps to
[1:45:38] come home
[1:45:41] spirits of every kind defeated there
[1:45:43] ought to be a people on this earth that
[1:45:45] says yep
[1:45:46] that's my god hallelujah
[1:45:49] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:45:51] forever and when he speaks
[1:45:53] it changes everything
[1:45:57] but the devil wants us to get get us
[1:45:59] caught up in just the fog
[1:46:01] and brother brandon was reading earlier
[1:46:02] in the message here in shalom he said
[1:46:05] it's like a fog that has just fallen
[1:46:07] upon the earth
[1:46:09] and he said it's only going to get worse
[1:46:10] and worse and worse
[1:46:17] but in the middle of this don't worry
[1:46:21] he's standing up
[1:46:24] and he's delivering his people you know
[1:46:27] i think about a story brother branham
[1:46:30] upon up on the mountain there we know
[1:46:32] the story but
[1:46:33] he gets caught in a fog
[1:46:37] and he's so trying to find his way and
[1:46:39] he's looking at everything he can try to
[1:46:41] look at to find his way
[1:46:44] trees the moss on the road what side's
[1:46:46] the moss on
[1:46:47] everything is a woodsman he said man i
[1:46:49] thought i was a woodman until i got in
[1:46:50] that position
[1:46:51] he said i finally realized i don't know
[1:46:53] anything
[1:46:55] he said i was lost and i was in such a
[1:46:58] fog i couldn't see where i was going
[1:47:00] and he actually started on what they
[1:47:02] call an indian death walk
[1:47:04] as he would walk and he said i'm going
[1:47:05] to go this way and i'm going to go this
[1:47:07] way just as hard
[1:47:08] as i can and i'm not going to turn to
[1:47:10] the right or left i'm going to go this
[1:47:11] way

[1:47:13] back to the place he started
[1:47:15] i i i know it's this way and i'd go and
[1:47:18] he
[1:47:19] looking at every sign trying to figure
[1:47:20] it out trying to see how you get itself
[1:47:22] out of this
[1:47:23] situation but he said the whole time a
[1:47:25] voice was speaking to him

[1:47:51] very present help
[1:47:53] in the time of trouble i'm a very
[1:47:56] present help

[1:48:00] hearing and he thought man am i losing

[1:48:02] uh and finally he said i finally come to
[1:48:05] my real life realize hey somebody's

[1:48:41] opposite
[1:48:42] way that he needed to go he said but all
