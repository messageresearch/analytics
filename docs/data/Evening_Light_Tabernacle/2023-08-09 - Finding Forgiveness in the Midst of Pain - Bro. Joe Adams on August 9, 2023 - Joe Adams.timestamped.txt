[23:06] prayer this evening and just dedicate
[23:08] this service to him dedicate our hearts
[23:10] our minds
[23:13] we just want to focus now just for a few
[23:15] minutes upon him
[23:16] he's the king
[23:18] imagine seeing him robed in his glory
[23:22] sweep through the building
[23:26] certainly there'd be shouts and glory
[23:29] and Hallelujah
[23:31] but how your heart is right now is
[23:32] actually how you're receiving
[23:35] we just want to honor him heavenly
[23:37] father is
[23:39] we come before you this evening with
[23:40] Humble Hearts realizing that lord it's
[23:44] more than just a story more than just a
[23:48] phrase but you are the king of glory
[23:52] Lord in your presence every knee must
[23:54] bow every tongue must confess
[23:58] that you are Lord
[24:00] you're the Lord of our hearts you're the
[24:03] Lord of our minds our bodies Lord
[24:05] everything that we have we surrender to
[24:08] thee
[24:10] we want to take all that we have this
[24:11] evening and focus it upon you upon your
[24:14] word for it's Eternal and it shall never
[24:16] pass away Lord the word that you have
[24:19] sent will not return void Lord we want
[24:22] to find our place in the scriptures this
[24:24] evening even as our brother Joel will
[24:26] soon step behindth this desk and
[24:29] Minister Lord we want our hearts to be
[24:31] prepared
[24:34] or we don't want any thoughts that would
[24:36] be contradictory to your word to stand
[24:38] up against your word in our minds but
[24:40] Lord we want to cast down all reasoning
[24:43] and say yay and amen to your word
[24:46] Lord we remember those that are sick and
[24:49] needy and body and
[24:52] many cancer patients there's been many
[24:55] victories Lord but there's still those
[24:56] that are suffering and think of our
[24:58] brother Ron and sister Erica Parker Lord
[25:01] and how brother Donnie continues to hold
[25:04] her up and stand strong in his position
[25:06] at his post of Duty even though Satan is
[25:09] literally warring right on the borders
[25:11] of his land
[25:13] father I just pray that you give him
[25:15] strength as you give her strength and we
[25:17] remember many others this evening Lord
[25:19] that have penned in requests and are
[25:22] Desiring a
[25:23] certainly a touch in their body
[25:26] as they fight the sicknesses of the day
[25:28] but Lord your word is common Lord you've
[25:31] said that you would be with us see even
[25:33] in us to the End of the Age Lord we find
[25:36] ourselves
[25:37] right at the end of that age and we're
[25:39] depending upon your father
[25:41] we need you Lord more than we ever
[25:43] needed you before we have a group of
[25:45] young people that will be boarding a bus
[25:47] in a few hours to attend a camp meeting
[25:49] up in Ohio and Lord we've prayed for
[25:52] these meetings and we've prayed for each
[25:54] one of the young people and Lord
[25:55] Desiring that the ministers Lord that
[25:57] have laid themselves before you and
[26:00] they would come with a word in due
[26:01] season Lord more than excitement but an
[26:05] encounter with you that would last a
[26:07] lifetime
[26:08] change lives Lord
[26:10] you're in the heart-turning business
[26:13] we believe that you have turned our
[26:14] hearts
[26:15] back to the original faith
[26:18] pray that you do it for one more this
[26:20] evening
[26:21] so we give you this service the
[26:23] opportunity to serve you and worship you
[26:25] in spirit and in truth we counted a
[26:28] great privilege and a great honor
[26:29] Lord for the offering that will be taken
[26:32] up and the tithes that will be taken we
[26:33] pray Lord that it would go to the
[26:35] furtherance of your kingdom and its
[26:37] intended purpose in this Christ's name
[26:40] amen amen why don't you turn around and
[26:42] shake hands with somebody that's near
[26:45] you if the brothers would take up the
[26:46] offering this evening we'd certainly
[26:48] appreciate that

[35:45] of God allow themselves to be changed so
[35:48] Lord we just Commit This service now
[35:49] into your hands we pray you'll bless the
[35:51] giving of the word and the receiving
[35:53] father for we ask it in Jesus name
[35:55] tonight amen God bless you if you have
[35:58] your Bibles you can be turned into
[36:00] Matthew 6 verse 14.
[36:05] I was looking at actually studying and
[36:07] studying actually a different thought
[36:09] the other day and as we was coming out
[36:12] here to Austin's graduation party as I
[36:14] was driving down the road the Lord just
[36:16] put this thought in my heart
[36:18] and I said oh boy
[36:20] here we go again
[36:22] but I want to speak to you tonight on
[36:24] finding forgiveness in the midst of pain
[36:28] finding forgiveness in the midst of pain
[36:31] and we find here in Matthew 6.
[36:34] in verse 14 for if you forgive men their
[36:37] Tres trespasses your heavenly father
[36:40] will also forgive you
[36:42] so notice
[36:43] there is a contingency here if you
[36:46] forgive men their trespasses
[36:49] your father your heavenly father will
[36:50] also forgive you but if you forgive not
[36:53] men their trespasses neither will your
[36:56] father forgive you your trespasses God
[36:58] bless you you can have your seats
[37:00] tonight this word trespass
[37:03] I just find it pretty pretty shocking or
[37:06] amazing because it means an offense
[37:08] shocking right that's what it means but
[37:10] it also means a misdeed it means a a
[37:14] side slip it means a deviation or a
[37:17] lapse and it could be unintentional
[37:20] an unintentional error or it can be a
[37:23] willful transgression
[37:25] so whether it's unintentional or whether
[37:27] it's willful we are to forgive one
[37:30] another's transgressions and if we
[37:33] forgive that our heavenly father will
[37:35] forgive us and the message is turning
[37:37] North where brother Brown says don't
[37:38] fight one another
[37:40] but as long as the devil's got you
[37:42] fighting one another he don't have to
[37:44] fight at all he will just sit back as a
[37:47] picnic watching you fight one another
[37:51] and laugh at you professing to have the
[37:53] Holy Ghost and fighting one another
[37:56] but he says love one another Jesus said
[37:59] well men we all men know that you're my
[38:01] disciples when you have loved one for
[38:03] another he said that's the greatest
[38:05] evidence of the Holy Ghost that I know
[38:07] is when you love one another
[38:11] and then the message go wake Jesus he
[38:13] says
[38:14] he says and as long as Satan has got us
[38:16] fighting one another
[38:18] while he don't have to fight at all but
[38:20] as long as we forget that fight notice
[38:23] as long as we forget that fight and join
[38:26] arms and hearts and say we're brothers
[38:28] we're on we're Christian Soldiers then
[38:31] that great Revival no economical counsel
[38:34] will ever touch that no sir that's the
[38:37] choice of God the elect that's been
[38:39] called
[38:40] and we each of us here tonight and if I
[38:43] ask for a show of hands many of us here
[38:45] we have been hurt at some point by
[38:48] somebody or something
[38:50] let's just be honest
[38:53] maybe it was your best friend they
[38:55] forgot to call you on your birthday you
[38:57] know what that's your best friend you
[38:59] expected them to call you and you was
[39:01] hurt you got offended
[39:04] and maybe it was mom or dad that
[39:05] criticize a career choice or maybe you
[39:08] left a certain job and the wife scolded
[39:10] you because you know this one did this
[39:12] this one's better that or maybe you was
[39:14] bullied as a child or or maybe your
[39:16] spouse and you had a fight now know how
[39:18] the devil loves to get in between that
[39:21] and you give the cold shoulder the
[39:23] silent treatment for a few hours on end
[39:25] and somebody's sleeping on the couch
[39:28] Dear God
[39:30] or maybe the pastor didn't speak to you
[39:33] or maybe the preacher preached on your
[39:35] toes and you got offended somebody told
[39:38] him
[39:39] you know but the Bible says that the
[39:41] holy spirit is still a discerner of the
[39:44] very thoughts and the intents of the
[39:46] heart
[39:47] or maybe you heard that a friend behind
[39:50] your back said some very negative things
[39:52] about you those are things they're
[39:54] crushing notice we're talking about
[39:56] forgiveness finding forgiveness in the
[39:59] midst of the pain these things are
[40:02] painful
[40:03] when somebody speaks evil against you
[40:05] and yet they profess to be your brother
[40:07] profess to be your sister they profess
[40:09] to love you and you know they got your
[40:11] back right
[40:13] but yet they're saying slanderous things
[40:15] to you but Proverbs tells us that a
[40:17] brother offended is harder one than a
[40:21] strong City
[40:22] think about that a brother that's
[40:24] offended is harder one than a strong
[40:26] City and their contentions talk about
[40:28] this brother his contentions are like
[40:31] the bars of a castle
[40:33] impregnable
[40:35] he has got it there you are not going to
[40:37] break through he's got his defenses up
[40:40] and these are acts of pain somebody
[40:43] who's been pain who's been wronged who's
[40:45] been you know who who's felt this and
[40:47] many times it's gut-wrenching and it
[40:50] strikes the pit of our stomachs and when
[40:52] we've been mistreated especially by
[40:55] those that claim to love us and
[40:57] especially by those that you love
[41:00] see this pain can lead behind an
[41:03] emotional wound of rejection
[41:04] fear betrayal insecurity and just like a
[41:09] physical wound that's unattended will
[41:11] get tankered and will get infected so
[41:14] will this emotional wound if it's not
[41:17] taken care of it'll get cankered and it
[41:19] will get infected and then you'll have
[41:21] feelings of resentment
[41:24] you had feelings of bitterness Revenge
[41:26] nobody hears ever wanted to get revenge
[41:29] right
[41:30] it's Human Nature
[41:33] it's this nature but see instead of
[41:37] choosing forgiveness a lot of times we
[41:40] choose to drink the poison of
[41:42] unforgiveness
[41:43] and we want to hold this over the person
[41:46] that violated us as if you know we got
[41:49] them you know we're we're persecuting
[41:51] them but we're not persecuting them at
[41:53] all we're only hurting ourselves
[41:56] see unforgiveness is poison to the soul
[41:59] it's a sin that locks the unforgiving
[42:01] person in their own self-made prison
[42:04] last time I spoke we spoke about walking
[42:07] out I'm talking to you how tonight how
[42:09] to stay to stay out to stay from that
[42:11] prison to not allow yourself to go back
[42:13] into that prison and it takes a constant
[42:16] state of forget or forgiveness
[42:20] you have to be willing you know
[42:22] forgiveness is not easy
[42:25] it's not easy it's it's easier for
[42:27] somebody to punch you than to say a
[42:29] slanderous word about you
[42:31] because you can get through that pretty
[42:32] quick and I find that this word
[42:35] forgiveness here's the definition it
[42:36] says to cease to feel resentment
[42:43] how many of you've ever been wrong don't
[42:44] raise your hand
[42:46] man how many listen
[42:48] how many of you still holding on to it
[42:50] unbeknownst to you is still there maybe
[42:53] this brother and his name comes up in a
[42:55] flood of emotions grips you you begin to
[42:57] sweat or maybe you just remember every
[43:00] detail of the hurt every aspect of the
[43:04] pain whether it be somebody who said
[43:05] someone you as a child and yet you
[43:07] buried that thing so deep but yet
[43:09] because it's there because it's not been
[43:11] forgiven yet it just keeps reoccurring
[43:13] and through processes of life especially
[43:15] at low times in our Christian walk those
[43:18] things can tend to resurface and rise up
[43:22] see Satan is there to try to destroy us
[43:24] and he will use things in our life
[43:26] especially on unforgiving things that we
[43:29] haven't got over yet to bring us down
[43:32] thinking that you're hurting your
[43:34] brother or hurting your sister or maybe
[43:36] a family member
[43:39] but see synonyms of forgiveness is
[43:41] Absolution you have to completely
[43:43] absolve the debt it means to Pardon to
[43:46] excuse the offense without exacting any
[43:49] penalty
[43:51] my that is hard
[43:53] because you know what if you're like me
[43:55] you gotta fight nature right
[43:57] something about you you're a fighter you
[43:59] don't like to be punched around
[44:01] when somebody says something you want to
[44:03] say something back but you learn as you
[44:06] submit yourself to the word and you
[44:07] surrender your heart to God God can take
[44:10] that hurt and he can use that weakness
[44:13] to become a strength and show others
[44:16] that no matter in the face of adversity
[44:18] you're still standing and you're willing
[44:20] to forgive now many of you as I spoke
[44:22] last time you see me you know how I am I
[44:25] don't hide my emotions I wish I could
[44:28] they're there
[44:29] but I tell my wife I'm working through
[44:31] something because each of us when we're
[44:33] going through and we've been hurt and
[44:35] we've been offended we have to work
[44:37] through those things and it doesn't mean
[44:39] that that brother that sister that
[44:41] they're backslidden it doesn't mean that
[44:43] they're going to leave the church it
[44:44] doesn't mean that they're going to quit
[44:45] this doesn't mean those things it means
[44:47] they got a process through prayer and
[44:49] forgiveness to get through and get
[44:51] beyond the hurt and sometimes it takes a
[44:54] moment it's not something you just
[44:56] willfully do over in an instant in
[44:58] miraculously it's all over it's not
[45:01] I wish it was
[45:03] and I'm sure you wished it was as well
[45:05] because some of you are still holding on
[45:07] to some unforgiving things some hurt
[45:09] some wounds some scars that you hadn't
[45:11] got over yet
[45:13] so forgiveness is something that we just
[45:16] as Believers we have to do if we expect
[45:19] to be forgiven
[45:21] you have and it's a action it's not an
[45:24] emotion
[45:26] forgiving someone is not an emotion it's
[45:28] not something you recite in your mind
[45:30] it's a willful act I'm gonna let them
[45:33] off of this penalty that they've done to
[45:36] me I'm gonna not exact any any hurt or
[45:39] any ill ill willing or anything to them
[45:42] I'm going to release them of this debt
[45:48] now if you had the life that I had grow
[45:50] up the way I grew up there's a lot of
[45:52] resentment that you got to overcome and
[45:55] I realized as I was studying this Joe
[45:56] you got some things to do you had to
[45:59] forgive
[46:00] those that hurt you as you were growing
[46:03] up
[46:04] it wasn't intentional but it was there
[46:07] but if I'm going to move on if we're
[46:09] going to move on we have to willingly
[46:11] say I resolve that debt I absorb it I
[46:15] pardon it I'm letting you off tonight
[46:17] I'm not going to hold it and when Satan
[46:19] tries to bring it back up no that thing
[46:20] is dead I've let it go it has no more
[46:23] control over me I'm not going to lock
[46:25] myself into the prison of that doubt or
[46:28] that prison of that scar or the prison
[46:30] of that wound anymore I'm going to let
[46:32] that thing go I'm not going to let the
[46:34] Throne of emotions and the flood of
[46:36] memory rise up and take me down and hold
[46:38] me a prisoner because you can't hold on
[46:42] to that Grudge you can't hold on to that
[46:44] business you can't hold on to that
[46:46] Unforgiven and expect to make a rapture
[46:49] [Applause]
[46:51] you got to let go of it and I'm here to
[46:54] tell you it takes a fight to let go you
[46:56] can say willful action I release tonight
[47:01] the debt The Violator
[47:03] and Let It Go
[47:06] notice it's our Christian duty if we
[47:09] expect to be forgiven
[47:12] not just by your brother or sister but
[47:14] by almighty God then ye have to forgive
[47:17] those who violated you
[47:20] that's the scripture there's no other
[47:23] Avenue around it it's not up for debate
[47:25] it's not up for discussion that's the
[47:28] word and if you're here tonight
[47:30] professing to be Holy Ghost Field
[47:32] professing to believe God sent a prophet
[47:34] professing to believe this message then
[47:37] you must be willing tonight to say I lay
[47:40] it down I'm not going to carry that
[47:42] thing anymore you know what what what
[47:44] what unforgiveness is and wounds are
[47:46] it's like a weight that you carry around
[47:49] and the longer you hold it the heavier
[47:51] it gets and some of you have been
[47:53] packing that thing around since a kid
[47:55] you've been packing around packing
[47:57] around thinking it's going to get
[47:58] lighter thinking it's going to get
[47:59] better and it's weighing you down it's
[48:01] waiting your family down it's waiting
[48:03] your children down but God is telling
[48:05] you tonight lay it down
[48:08] you don't have to carry that thing
[48:10] anymore just forgive
[48:12] Let It Go
[48:15] absolve the debt pardon the Violator
[48:18] tonight
[48:22] see it's an act
[48:24] that you have to be willing and able to
[48:27] do not an emotion
[48:30] not a Feeling
[48:32] but see it can be very difficult
[48:33] especially when you've been hurt
[48:36] because when you've been hurt you back
[48:37] yourself in a corner you ever seen an
[48:40] animal that's been hurt
[48:42] he backs us if you back a wild animal
[48:44] that's been hurt in the corner he's
[48:45] going to come out fighting
[48:47] but that's the part that's got a bit
[48:49] laid down
[48:51] so you got to put that seed forgiveness
[48:52] is a powerful tool if it's held in the
[48:55] right hand of righteousness
[48:57] because you can let that brother off
[48:59] that hook
[49:00] you can let that sister off that hook
[49:02] and no longer let that hurt and let that
[49:06] pain torment your walk with God
[49:10] think about that no longer letting that
[49:12] thing that memory some of us if you're
[49:14] like me that thing you think about it
[49:15] when you lay down at night
[49:17] as soon as you wake up in the morning
[49:19] it's there to remind Satan is in your
[49:20] ear hold on to it don't let it go don't
[49:23] let them off you're just to be feeling
[49:25] like this they did you wrong they
[49:27] deserve punishment but see that's the
[49:29] devil's language God's language is love
[49:32] one another and see when you love one
[49:34] another then love will breed forgiveness
[49:37] and forgiveness will will breed a
[49:40] freedom to worship or Freedom so you can
[49:42] ex put your arm around that brother
[49:46] put your arm around say you know what I
[49:48] forgive you and a lot of times let me
[49:49] just say it like this you may not be
[49:51] able to go face to face and do it
[49:54] but if you don't do it here
[49:56] you won't make it there
[49:59] you got to be able to do it right here
[50:00] I'm not talking about mind over matter
[50:01] I'm talking about do it in your heart so
[50:04] this word pain here is a mental or
[50:06] emotional distress or sufferings and
[50:09] we're speaking on forgiveness finding
[50:11] forgiveness so what do you mean brother
[50:12] Joe by finding forgiveness I mean you
[50:15] got to search deep tonight within your
[50:17] own self-will and say God help me
[50:19] tonight to find that place where I can
[50:22] come and I can forgive no matter what
[50:24] the hurt is no matter what the pain is
[50:26] no matter what the suffering has been
[50:28] God help me tonight to find forgiveness
[50:31] and that will release me from the pain
[50:33] that I've been in
[50:36] oh you may make it through life but
[50:37] you're still holding the weight
[50:39] and all of a sudden that weight becomes
[50:41] the norm no that's not the norm
[50:43] you just adjusted to that weight but the
[50:46] norm is walking in Victory the norm is
[50:49] living a Godly life the enormous loving
[50:51] your brother putting your arms around
[50:52] them and letting no contingents come in
[50:54] the house of God that's the norm that's
[50:57] the church that God built
[51:01] so we want to look at a few things
[51:02] tonight by God's grace I want to look at
[51:04] unforgiveness
[51:05] I want to look at bitterness and I want
[51:07] to look at forgiveness so what is
[51:09] unforgiveness brother Joe unforgiveness
[51:10] is a state of emotional and mental
[51:13] distress that results from a delayed
[51:15] response in forgiving someone
[51:18] well I'll just I'll get around to it
[51:21] now this ain't something you get around
[51:22] to
[51:24] so the longer that you don't do it the
[51:26] longer that or the more that it breeds
[51:29] and it sets in this ain't something that
[51:32] oh I'll just okay if they come to me and
[51:34] say I'm sorry look forgiveness is not
[51:36] waiting on somebody to come to you say
[51:38] I'm sorry for what I've done it's a act
[51:40] that you must do knowing that you've
[51:42] been wrong by that person whether they
[51:44] know it or not and nine times out of 10
[51:46] the person that wronged you don't even
[51:48] know that they wronged you
[51:50] you'd be around me long enough I
[51:52] probably said some hurt your feelings
[51:54] but I didn't do it intentionally
[51:56] right because we don't do it
[51:57] intentionally whether it's intentional
[52:01] or unintentional or willful the Bible
[52:03] says you got to forgive the
[52:04] transgression the trespasses
[52:07] so we find here
[52:09] unforgiveness is characterized by
[52:12] indignation
[52:13] bitterness a demand for punishment
[52:16] restitution
[52:18] see it creates a domino effect it causes
[52:21] our emotions and our thoughts and our
[52:23] body behaviors and our spirit and our
[52:25] relationships to be upside down
[52:27] see with unforgiveness time does not
[52:30] heal this wound
[52:32] it only grows and worsens
[52:35] because now every other little minute
[52:38] infraction only makes that scar worse
[52:43] it only adds to the intensity of the
[52:46] wound
[52:47] and though it's unintentional you start
[52:50] looking at things through the wrong set
[52:52] of eyes
[52:53] see in the absence notice what they say
[52:55] here that I've done a lot of research
[52:57] trying to get to this
[52:58] see they said unforgiveness is like
[53:00] carrying around a huge weight the longer
[53:02] we carry The Grudge that hurt that
[53:04] behavior only becomes worse
[53:08] the burden only becomes heavy see the
[53:11] roots of unforgiveness only go deeper
[53:14] further in entangling US
[53:17] and we're waiting on somebody to come
[53:19] and apologize but that's not the
[53:21] responsibility our responsibility is not
[53:23] to wait on them to come say I'm sorry
[53:25] I'm wrong our responsibility is says I
[53:28] forgive you
[53:30] that's your Christian responsibility
[53:33] whether they know you're hurt or not you
[53:36] have to find within yourself
[53:39] forgiveness in the midst of the pain
[53:43] well this one didn't speak to me and
[53:45] this one didn't do this and this one
[53:47] said this
[53:48] you know a lot of times we find that we
[53:50] may say things ingest
[53:52] but yet the person's not in the mood for
[53:54] your adjusting
[53:56] and they become offended by it and then
[53:58] they'll be saying same person but on a
[54:00] different day the mood's better and you
[54:02] can say the same thing and it doesn't
[54:03] bother them it's like water off our
[54:05] ducks back yeah so I'll just asking like
[54:07] won't you just guard your audience or or
[54:10] gauge your audience watch who you're
[54:11] speaking to and how you speak to them
[54:14] you know if they're if they're in a foul
[54:16] mood I think the time to go picking
[54:18] you know if they're fun and joking and
[54:20] cutting up maybe so but you know the
[54:22] thing about it every just comment has a
[54:25] lot of Truth mixed in with it and the
[54:27] devil can get on that shoulder and begin
[54:28] to whisper look at it this is what they
[54:30] think oh they said that they were joking
[54:32] but they really meant it it's got an
[54:35] ounce of truth to it it may have an
[54:37] ounce of Truth with it
[54:39] but still your responsibility is to say
[54:41] I forgive you
[54:43] I'm not going to hold this over you
[54:45] because I know you were joking I know
[54:47] Junior Wiley you love me
[54:49] or at least you better love me
[54:53] right
[54:55] so we find out this pain becomes the
[54:57] identity
[54:59] of a person who's not been able to
[55:02] forgive
[55:03] you ever been around somebody like that
[55:04] don't show your hand
[55:06] and don't go pointing fingers tonight
[55:09] you can around somebody that has not
[55:10] overcome yet they haven't forgiven or
[55:12] hurt our wound and you get around them
[55:14] in just a few minutes they're telling
[55:15] you every little detail of what happened
[55:19] so and so said this so-and-so did this
[55:21] they tell you when it happened how it
[55:23] happened where it happened in all the
[55:24] it's like a hunting story
[55:27] man they got that they got that wound on
[55:29] the wall it's a trophy they can tell you
[55:31] every bit of it where where I was
[55:34] standing in church brother Tim just
[55:35] walked right by me didn't say nothing
[55:37] just stuck his little nose up and just
[55:40] oh and then you got all offended trophy
[55:42] on the wall
[55:45] those are things we need to strip off
[55:47] our walls
[55:48] so I choose to not remember that I
[55:52] choose to forgive that I choose to pull
[55:54] that off my wall and put a trophy of
[55:56] worship a trophy of Praise a trophy of
[55:59] love a trophy that gives God glory not
[56:01] giving the devil some kind of Praise
[56:03] because I'm holding on to a grudge and I
[56:05] can recite every minute everything that
[56:07] was done every infraction that was done
[56:09] to me when you willing to let go and
[56:11] find forgiveness in the midst of your
[56:13] pain you will not be sticking up
[56:15] trophies of malice Strife unjustice
[56:18] things like that you'll pull those
[56:19] things down and you'll put your arm
[56:21] around your brother and you say hey
[56:22] we're gonna we're in this together I'll
[56:24] pull it for you I'm praying for you I'm
[56:27] on your side I know you're in a low
[56:28] point but I'm here to lift you up and to
[56:31] see you through this thing
[56:35] notice now somebody that's
[56:37] that's being identified by the pain
[56:41] they perceive every wrong encounter as a
[56:45] personal attack
[56:47] I know I'm not speaking nobody here
[56:49] tonight
[56:51] or I'm speaking to everybody
[56:55] because I'm speaking to myself
[56:57] because when you've been hurt and you've
[56:59] been wounded
[57:01] than every little thing begins to set
[57:04] you off
[57:05] then you try to reason it did they mean
[57:07] this did they mean that what did they
[57:10] really mean why did they say this why
[57:14] did they say that see it's not for us to
[57:16] figure those things out it's for us to
[57:18] forgive
[57:20] it's for us to let go of it so notice
[57:22] now unforgiveness comes to affect your
[57:24] judgment your perspective because you
[57:27] view the world and you view others and
[57:29] you begin to view yourself through the
[57:31] lens of your hurt
[57:34] through the lens of your hurt you know
[57:37] you get hurt nobody cares about me
[57:38] nobody's called me nobody's checked on
[57:41] me
[57:42] and we have
[57:44] nobody's done it because you're viewing
[57:46] it through the lens of your hurt
[57:49] but if you forgive
[57:52] and let go and let that thing have
[57:54] control over you because that's what
[57:56] it's doing it's got control over you
[58:00] and we can't allow the devil to have
[58:02] control even in the slightest in
[58:04] fractions
[58:06] so if I see the pain becomes the
[58:08] identity of the person that's not
[58:10] willing to forgive and all they can talk
[58:13] about is the pain when it happened where
[58:15] it happened how it happened see and you
[58:17] get around and you're not there just a
[58:18] few seconds and all of a sudden they're
[58:19] going through and it seems like that's
[58:21] all they can talk about
[58:23] and anybody that comes they're going to
[58:25] get the same story they have not let
[58:28] that thing go yet
[58:30] it's constant constant constant constant
[58:32] constant constant cost you know what
[58:34] you're what I'm talking about because
[58:36] you've been that one
[58:38] let's just be honest we have vintage you
[58:40] know what brother so and so said about
[58:42] me and you just tell everybody
[58:45] anybody that'll listen you tell them why
[58:47] because that's our human nature but our
[58:50] Christian responsibility is to let go of
[58:52] that
[58:53] see it affects our character our
[58:55] integrity see grudges grudges don't make
[58:58] you better they make you worse
[59:01] well I'm gonna hold on to you hold on to
[59:03] it you'll be in hell
[59:06] your choice
[59:08] because they're in the spirit and where
[59:09] the spirit of the Lord is there is
[59:11] Liberty there's freedom from those
[59:12] things and the Bible says Stand Fast
[59:14] therefore in the Liberty whereas Christ
[59:16] had made you free he came and pardon you
[59:19] of your transgressions
[59:22] he let you off the hook of your
[59:24] transgressions you know there's a story
[59:26] about the unjust servant there and he
[59:28] came and he pleaded and he begged
[59:29] because he owed a thousand talents when
[59:32] it was and held a large sum of money and
[59:34] and the King there says you know what
[59:35] I'm going to take your wife I'm going to
[59:37] take your children I'm going to throw
[59:38] you into prison and he fell down and oh
[59:40] God our whole King don't do this to me
[59:42] oh just resolve my dead and just give me
[59:44] time I'll pay it and he owed 15 million
[59:47] dollars
[59:49] that's the son that's what it equated to
[59:51] 15 million dollars and yet as soon as
[59:55] the king resolves his death he went out
[59:57] jumping and skipping oh I'm a free man I
[59:59] don't have this debt any longer and he
[1:00:01] found a servant that owed him a measly
[1:00:04] fifteen dollars
[1:00:07] 15 that's what your infraction is to one
[1:00:11] another that hurt that word is a measly
[1:00:14] 15 bucks but your sin and your
[1:00:16] indignation and your ambiguity to God is
[1:00:19] 15 million bucks and God Almighty
[1:00:22] resolved your debt in your home fifteen
[1:00:24] dollars over your brother fifteen
[1:00:26] dollars over your sister
[1:00:29] and you're ready to throw them into the
[1:00:31] sinner's prison and tell them to lock
[1:00:33] them up and throw away the key and say
[1:00:34] you owe me this and yet they do but your
[1:00:37] responsibility is that I forgive you of
[1:00:40] it
[1:00:41] I'll lay it down I resolve this you
[1:00:43] don't owe me nothing no more
[1:00:49] 15 million to 15. and I'm looking at
[1:00:52] some of you tonight and you're holding
[1:00:54] 15 over somebody's head when you've been
[1:00:56] given forgiven 15 million no way you
[1:00:59] could pay it no way your family could
[1:01:01] pay it no way your family family
[1:01:03] families could pay it and you're
[1:01:05] struggling
[1:01:06] some of us are struggling to come to the
[1:01:08] house of God over some word some hurt
[1:01:10] some misdeed some misstep
[1:01:15] 15 when you have been forgiven 15
[1:01:18] million
[1:01:21] you have been forgiven so much
[1:01:25] and if you expect to be forgiven
[1:01:29] then you must
[1:01:31] find forgiveness
[1:01:33] in the midst of your pain
[1:01:35] and it hurts
[1:01:36] and it's real I'm not saying that the
[1:01:39] person that wronged you that you just
[1:01:41] let them off the hook you can't forget
[1:01:42] it
[1:01:44] you're never gonna probably forget it
[1:01:46] but you for you can forgive it
[1:01:49] Nelson Mandela how many of you may know
[1:01:51] him he was thrown into prison many years
[1:01:53] ago for for uh some injustices that he
[1:01:56] didn't do but anyway he makes this
[1:01:58] comment hating someone is drinking
[1:02:00] poison and expecting the other person to
[1:02:03] die from it
[1:02:06] let me give you another quote that he
[1:02:08] said he no he was in prison he says I
[1:02:10] walked out of that door toward the gate
[1:02:12] that would lead to my freedom and I knew
[1:02:15] if I didn't leave my bitterness and
[1:02:18] hatred behind I still be in prison
[1:02:23] if I don't leave that behind me and let
[1:02:27] it go and let
[1:02:28] it left and you're the one that's in
[1:02:30] prison
[1:02:32] you're in prison to a wound that maybe
[1:02:34] you didn't cause her or whatever you was
[1:02:37] wrongfully done but that doesn't matter
[1:02:39] there's a way out tonight there's a key
[1:02:41] and it's a key of forgiveness tonight
[1:02:43] and in a locks the door and it will let
[1:02:45] you off tonight and you will let that
[1:02:47] person off and notice when you ever had
[1:02:49] done something for somebody man it just
[1:02:51] really makes you feel good
[1:02:53] when you really done something and you
[1:02:55] pay maybe you paid a large sum to help
[1:02:57] somebody out
[1:02:59] man it just feels good to be able to
[1:03:01] give
[1:03:02] think about when you for when you
[1:03:04] forgive
[1:03:05] you're taking the weight off of you
[1:03:08] and you're taking
[1:03:09] the weight off of them
[1:03:12] now you're no longer longer owe me
[1:03:15] you're no longer in debt to me I
[1:03:18] resolved that death I absolve it it's
[1:03:20] over then you can look at your brother
[1:03:22] you can look at your sister with the
[1:03:25] love of God not with bitterness not with
[1:03:28] hatred not with malice not with Strife
[1:03:31] not when you get in a room around them
[1:03:33] and all of a sudden beads are sweat get
[1:03:34] on your head because you're so wanting
[1:03:36] to get revenge
[1:03:38] hey I'm talking to you about the truth
[1:03:41] I've been there you've been there nod
[1:03:44] your head
[1:03:45] but your heart is saying yes brother Joe
[1:03:48] because it's the truth it's what we face
[1:03:50] but I'm telling you God laid this on my
[1:03:53] heart driving here just the other night
[1:03:54] said speak to him I didn't have a clue I
[1:03:56] didn't have an ally I had nothing but I
[1:03:59] had a thought finding forgiveness in the
[1:04:01] midst of pain
[1:04:04] nobody likes to be wronged especially by
[1:04:07] your brother church member Pastor
[1:04:10] preacher friend Deacon brother sister
[1:04:13] husband wife
[1:04:15] nobody likes to be hurt it's pain
[1:04:19] it's painful it's a scar but if that
[1:04:23] scar is picked and that scar is just
[1:04:25] constantly oh I just remember this and I
[1:04:27] remember this you never put the bomb of
[1:04:29] of Gilead on that scar to heal that
[1:04:31] wound
[1:04:32] but I'm here to tell you there's a bomb
[1:04:34] tonight
[1:04:35] there's a holy ghost tonight and the
[1:04:37] Holy Ghost breeds love and love breeds
[1:04:39] forgiveness and forgiveness heals the
[1:04:41] wound of hurts in your life hurts and
[1:04:43] scars down through our life that maybe
[1:04:45] we didn't know and maybe we suppressed
[1:04:47] them for so long but yet they're still
[1:04:49] there unhealed but there's an antibody
[1:04:51] tonight that you can take tonight
[1:04:53] there's a toxin that you can take it'll
[1:04:56] heal that broken wound it'll heal that
[1:04:58] thing and allow you to move on with God
[1:05:01] it would allow you to for some of us
[1:05:03] wonder why can't I get anywhere
[1:05:06] are you holding on to something
[1:05:09] or you got something hanging over
[1:05:11] somebody some fifteen dollars
[1:05:15] notice
[1:05:16] unforgiveness is like cancer
[1:05:19] it spreads it cannot be contained
[1:05:22] it has to be wiped out
[1:05:29] you keep a spirit of unforgiveness your
[1:05:31] friends will walk away from you because
[1:05:33] they get sick and tired of hearing about
[1:05:34] the negativity that's been done to you
[1:05:39] you have to learn to let it go
[1:05:42] it makes unforgiveness makes you a very
[1:05:45] irritable person
[1:05:49] you just love to be around somebody like
[1:05:50] that
[1:05:52] y'all took bets on me
[1:05:57] hey
[1:05:59] it's the truth
[1:06:01] but you know what I recognize because we
[1:06:04] all have to work through things
[1:06:06] you got to work through your hurt but if
[1:06:08] you don't work through your hurt that
[1:06:09] thing's gonna Fester
[1:06:11] and then one day it's gonna pop and when
[1:06:14] it pops it's a nasty mess it gets on you
[1:06:17] it gets on those beside you it gets on
[1:06:19] those here it gets on those there we're
[1:06:21] not hooked there's a bomb in Gilead we
[1:06:23] don't need sores to Fester when we get a
[1:06:25] healing agent here tonight
[1:06:29] forgive it Let It Go
[1:06:32] walk away from it
[1:06:34] so unforgiveness breeds bitterness and
[1:06:37] Hebrews 3 verse 12 says take heed
[1:06:39] brother lest there be in any of you an
[1:06:42] evil heart of unbelief in departing from
[1:06:45] the Living God but exhort one another
[1:06:47] daily while it is called today lest any
[1:06:50] of you be hardened through the
[1:06:51] deceitfulness of sin in Hebrews 12 verse
[1:06:53] 14 follow peace with all men oh
[1:06:58] my follow peace with all men and
[1:07:01] Holiness without which no man shall see
[1:07:03] the Lord looking diligently lest any man
[1:07:07] fell of the grace of God lest any root
[1:07:10] of bitterness bringing up trouble you
[1:07:12] and thereby many be defiled so this word
[1:07:16] bitterness is an extreme wickedness
[1:07:20] you think I can be just a little bit
[1:07:21] bitter you ever drank bitter coffee it's
[1:07:23] nasty right you spit it out same way
[1:07:25] with bitterness it's nasty spit it out
[1:07:29] it's extreme wickedness and it's in the
[1:07:32] heart
[1:07:33] and it's because you haven't chose to
[1:07:35] forgive and move on you've chose to let
[1:07:37] it fester and unforgiveness breeds
[1:07:40] bitterness and we find here see when
[1:07:42] we've been hurt it's easy to get bitter
[1:07:45] and when you get bitter it's hard to
[1:07:47] forgive yes
[1:07:48] see it's a direct correlation
[1:07:51] see it makes you caustic it makes you
[1:07:53] sarcastic it makes you condemning and it
[1:07:55] makes you a very nasty person
[1:07:57] nobody wants to be around your
[1:08:00] bitterness
[1:08:03] but we're all guilty
[1:08:06] but I'm giving you a solution tonight
[1:08:08] find forgiveness
[1:08:10] in the midst of your hurt in the midst
[1:08:12] of your pain see bitterness is harassed
[1:08:15] by memories
[1:08:17] my mama Satan's right there on your
[1:08:20] shoulder bringing this to your memory
[1:08:21] bringing this one up bringing this one
[1:08:23] well I did what did Brother Joe say I
[1:08:25] mean did did he mean was he pointing at
[1:08:27] me because I know I saw him point but
[1:08:29] you know I could have swore he pointed
[1:08:30] right at me
[1:08:32] it's harassed by memories
[1:08:34] memories because you're not willing to
[1:08:36] forgive because if you forgive it
[1:08:39] and you let it go it rises up and it
[1:08:42] falls off because you're not holding
[1:08:44] that person in prison to it
[1:08:46] you've let them go so bitters is a root
[1:08:49] that grows deep in the soul of our
[1:08:51] hearts
[1:08:52] that if you let time tear it gets deeper
[1:08:55] and deeper and deeper but it must be
[1:08:59] rooted out
[1:09:01] now I'm a stump grinder
[1:09:04] but even in stump grinding you leave
[1:09:07] part of that in the ground
[1:09:08] but what I'm talking about tonight is
[1:09:10] you gotta uproot every trace of that
[1:09:13] thing and not let it fester in your life
[1:09:16] just can't come over the times oh I had
[1:09:18] a good meeting I felt the Holy Ghost and
[1:09:20] I got goosebumps and you know it's okay
[1:09:21] and we got it below the surface and yet
[1:09:23] there's still a little bit there
[1:09:25] it's going to be completely absolved
[1:09:29] pardoned let go of completely take that
[1:09:32] root out of the ground
[1:09:34] the entire root ball in the root system
[1:09:36] and take it out and throw it away
[1:09:42] and I'm here to tell you if we can do
[1:09:44] that in the natural
[1:09:46] he can do that in a supernatural
[1:09:49] but you got to be willing people come
[1:09:52] and they say hey Mr Adams you do stump
[1:09:55] grinding right they call me they're
[1:09:57] looking for me
[1:09:58] I'm like I'm your man come around
[1:10:01] I got you I got a big machine we can
[1:10:03] take care of that
[1:10:05] but I'm here to tell you you got to be
[1:10:07] looking for him
[1:10:08] find him he's the one that can take
[1:10:11] those things out of your heart
[1:10:13] completely resolve it completely
[1:10:16] eradicated completely do away with it
[1:10:19] but it's going to cost you
[1:10:22] it's going to cost you some pride
[1:10:24] because you got to be willing to
[1:10:25] recognize I need this
[1:10:28] I need this for me I need this for my
[1:10:30] family I need this for my marriage I
[1:10:32] need this for my kids my kids deserve to
[1:10:35] see a father my kids deserve to see a
[1:10:37] mother that's in tune with the word and
[1:10:39] not in the mully grubs and complaining
[1:10:41] about this one and that one this one
[1:10:43] Roman that one Roman nobody cares and
[1:10:45] all this let all that go
[1:10:48] God is calling for sons and God is
[1:10:50] calling for daughters of God he's
[1:10:51] calling for men to be Gallant men
[1:10:53] Gallant women Christians of the Cross
[1:10:56] he's called for men to be like David who
[1:10:58] God say he's a man after my own heart
[1:11:01] that's what we're called to be but the
[1:11:04] devil's got us fighting one another and
[1:11:06] don't go away from here tonight and say
[1:11:07] brother Joe was picking on me and I'm
[1:11:08] not picking on you I'm picking on me
[1:11:10] tonight I'm telling you we are in this
[1:11:12] together
[1:11:14] and we got to be willing to do a
[1:11:16] self-assessment and say God I've been
[1:11:18] Rome but through the preaching of the
[1:11:19] word through the foolishness of
[1:11:21] preaching you chose to anoint brother
[1:11:23] Joe and put a thought on his heart and
[1:11:25] I've been having this thing lay there
[1:11:27] and lay there and lay there but through
[1:11:29] the preaching and the anointing of the
[1:11:31] spirit he comes and it destroys the Yoke
[1:11:33] that's been on my life that's been on my
[1:11:36] family that's been come down through
[1:11:37] family strength but yet there's an agent
[1:11:39] here tonight there's a healing here
[1:11:41] tonight there's somebody that can come
[1:11:43] and expose that thing and tonight I
[1:11:45] recognize I need to forgive
[1:11:48] I need to move on if I'm going to be
[1:11:51] forgiven and receive a body change
[1:11:54] Ephesians 4 verse 29 the Bible says
[1:11:58] let no corrupt
[1:12:01] communication
[1:12:03] proceed out of your mouth but that which
[1:12:05] is good oh
[1:12:07] you mean I can't talk about my brother
[1:12:09] nope
[1:12:10] notice this word corrupt is rotten
[1:12:13] putrified let no corrupt communication
[1:12:17] or putrify communication or writing
[1:12:20] communication proceed out of your mouth
[1:12:22] but that which is good but I don't want
[1:12:25] to say anything to it then shut up
[1:12:28] keep your mouth shut stay home do
[1:12:30] everybody a favor but quit getting in
[1:12:33] people's ear and complaining about what
[1:12:35] this one does and that one done and that
[1:12:37] one done
[1:12:42] I got a quote for you just in a minute
[1:12:44] don't worry
[1:12:46] see let no corrupt communication proceed
[1:12:48] out of your mouth but that which is good
[1:12:50] to use of edifying building up
[1:12:54] that it may Minister Grace unto the
[1:12:57] hearers
[1:12:58] your unforgiveness does not administer
[1:13:00] Grace it doesn't Elevate anybody it
[1:13:02] doesn't make somebody feel warm and
[1:13:03] fuzzy they don't get goosebumps
[1:13:05] they're not going around shouting and
[1:13:07] dancing because you're negative and
[1:13:08] you're complaining about being hurt and
[1:13:10] unloading your wound on them again and
[1:13:12] that nasty sword and pop and it's
[1:13:14] getting all over everybody around you
[1:13:17] look I'm guilty I've been guilty I asked
[1:13:20] my friends they'll tell you
[1:13:23] there's been times they look I didn't
[1:13:25] want them at the house
[1:13:27] Aaron David y'all keep your eyes shut
[1:13:30] they're probably not yeah we took bets
[1:13:33] on you buddy
[1:13:35] but it's the truth we all must be
[1:13:38] willing to come face to face with it
[1:13:41] and we all must be willing to be honest
[1:13:44] with ourselves It's Time to Let It Go
[1:13:47] it's time to find forgiveness brother
[1:13:48] Tim in the midst of our pain it's not
[1:13:51] easy to say I was wrong it's because you
[1:13:53] want to hold on to it you want to get
[1:13:54] vengeance
[1:13:56] the Bible says vengeance is mine saith
[1:13:58] the Lord he didn't say Vengeance of my
[1:13:59] saved job
[1:14:01] to all my I'm a man of God I'm gonna get
[1:14:04] Vengeance no God doesn't operate that
[1:14:07] way God says this is when you know that
[1:14:09] you're my disciples
[1:14:11] when you strike Vengeance to one another
[1:14:13] no when you have love
[1:14:15] love
[1:14:18] let me keep going and grieve not the
[1:14:20] Holy Spirit whereby you've been sealed
[1:14:22] to the day of your Redemption let all
[1:14:23] bitterness you mean I can't keep none of
[1:14:26] it none of it kind of let all bitterness
[1:14:28] extreme wickedness
[1:14:31] that all extreme wickedness and wrath
[1:14:34] and anger and clamor and excuse me evil
[1:14:36] speaking be put away from you with all
[1:14:39] malice
[1:14:40] for Man this ain't no fun
[1:14:43] no this is what it means to be a
[1:14:45] Christian
[1:14:46] this is what it means to be an overcomer
[1:14:49] I'm talking to you about being staying
[1:14:51] out of that prison you walked out two
[1:14:54] weeks ago stay out
[1:14:56] how do you stay out forgive and love
[1:14:59] two powerful weapons in a person a
[1:15:02] believer's Arsenal is love and
[1:15:03] forgiveness because when you can look at
[1:15:05] your brother and still love them and
[1:15:07] forgive them that means you're a real
[1:15:08] son of God
[1:15:10] you're displaying Christ
[1:15:12] because he looked at you and said I
[1:15:14] forgive you
[1:15:15] and I love you
[1:15:17] notice and the Bible says in Ephesians 4
[1:15:20] and verse 32 now this is gonna This is
[1:15:22] Gonna Get You
[1:15:24] if I know you're just going to get you
[1:15:25] come on
[1:15:26] oh
[1:15:31] you mean I mean I gotta be kind yes you
[1:15:34] do
[1:15:36] that means you ain't got to invite him
[1:15:37] over
[1:15:39] told them a big party but you got to be
[1:15:41] kind he don't give in a solid treatment
[1:15:44] at church
[1:15:46] let me walk around stick your nose up
[1:15:47] like you don't know me wrong me I don't
[1:15:50] know who you are no be kind one to
[1:15:51] another tender hearted forget oh there's
[1:15:54] that word again
[1:15:55] forgiving one another even as God for
[1:15:58] Christ's sake has forgiven you
[1:16:02] wow maybe not the kind of service you
[1:16:04] thought tonight when we're sending our
[1:16:06] young people off but I promise you you
[1:16:07] take this to Heart tonight you're gonna
[1:16:09] go a lot of places
[1:16:10] and one place you're gonna go Satan
[1:16:12] can't get there and that's the body
[1:16:13] change that's the rapture
[1:16:15] because you're not taking your malice
[1:16:16] you're not taking your Grievous you're
[1:16:17] not taking your contentions you're not
[1:16:19] taking none of those things you're not
[1:16:20] taking up they're not going but what you
[1:16:22] will take is love and you will take
[1:16:24] forgiveness and you will take the spirit
[1:16:26] of Christ you'll take out in a body
[1:16:28] change but everything else it's going to
[1:16:29] be left behind because he ain't coming
[1:16:31] for that he's coming for those that
[1:16:33] match his character and he so loved the
[1:16:36] world that he gave his only begotten son
[1:16:38] he forgave you a 15 million dollars
[1:16:43] that's a whole lot of debt and all he's
[1:16:45] asking for you is to say let go of that
[1:16:47] five fat 15 bucks
[1:16:49] I got you I'll take care of that down
[1:16:52] the road
[1:16:53] see when you give forgiveness what
[1:16:56] you're doing is you're putting their
[1:16:58] judgment of that wrongdoer in God's
[1:16:59] hands and not yours
[1:17:01] see it's up to God then to deal with
[1:17:04] that person
[1:17:05] and let me say God will deal with that
[1:17:07] person
[1:17:08] got to move on their heart there's been
[1:17:10] some of you here tonight that I've
[1:17:11] offended in my time of being here
[1:17:14] thinking about me and I thank God for it
[1:17:16] is I'm quick to repent
[1:17:18] and I'm not too prideful that I can't
[1:17:20] come and say you know what I'm sorry
[1:17:22] that I've offended sorry that you know
[1:17:25] that didn't come out quite like I meant
[1:17:26] it to come out
[1:17:28] anybody ever been there you say
[1:17:29] something like oh I wish I didn't say it
[1:17:31] like that and you're like oh well that's
[1:17:33] us that's human nature
[1:17:36] but you got to be quick to say I'm sorry
[1:17:38] don't be so prideful and so boastful and
[1:17:40] thinking well you know if I say I'm if I
[1:17:43] forgive them then it's weak it's not
[1:17:44] weak that's strength
[1:17:47] to recognize to The Real Son of God can
[1:17:50] say I'm sorry I'm wrong I didn't mean to
[1:17:52] do that I don't want to be the the
[1:17:54] hindrance of another brother another
[1:17:56] sister from moving on with God
[1:17:58] I don't want to be as far of them
[1:18:00] getting up and walking out
[1:18:03] and I'm not talking about walking out
[1:18:04] mentally walking out spiritually I'm
[1:18:06] talking to them walking out physically
[1:18:07] and saying I will not be back through
[1:18:08] those doors because of the people and
[1:18:10] the attitudes that even like Tabernacle
[1:18:14] but see when when we're wounded
[1:18:17] everything is heightened
[1:18:20] you ever been ever had a surgery
[1:18:22] you've ever been cut home
[1:18:25] when you when you walk out of that
[1:18:26] hospital room you're not magically
[1:18:28] healed
[1:18:30] it's a process
[1:18:32] it takes time brother Tim you take
[1:18:34] medicine you take care of the wound you
[1:18:37] make sure there's nothing in there to
[1:18:39] get it dirty get it contaminated
[1:18:41] you keep Galls over you keep it wrapped
[1:18:45] what you got to do with your world you
[1:18:46] got to keep it wrapped you don't go

[1:19:02] showing everybody your scar you hurt
[1:19:05] people and you especially hurt those
[1:19:06] that weak
[1:19:08] and then they week and then all of a
[1:19:10] sudden the weak ones
[1:19:12] begin to oh well if that's how they're
[1:19:15] going to be then I just won't come back
[1:19:17] and I'll just stay away and I'll just do
[1:19:19] this because they can't handle it
[1:19:21] because you know honestly if you've got
[1:19:23] a sore I don't want to look at it
[1:19:26] the doctor is at the hospital when I
[1:19:28] worked at the hospital Dr uh
[1:19:30] what's the doctor's name
[1:19:33] Indian
[1:19:34] Dr Mallory he'd show me some pictures
[1:19:36] I'm like you can't be showing me that
[1:19:38] stuff
[1:19:39] he's inside the body and he's got
[1:19:41] pictures of Scopes I'm like that's nasty
[1:19:43] man he said look at this I'm like I'm
[1:19:45] about to throw up
[1:19:48] and that's how it is with some of us we
[1:19:50] don't I'm a weak person when it comes to
[1:19:52] that I don't want to see it I'm not
[1:19:55] going to the operating room and said oh
[1:19:56] here I am let me show me the dirty
[1:20:00] and no shall we come to the house of God
[1:20:02] expecting to be shown the dirty
[1:20:04] we don't need to be seen and seeing the
[1:20:06] hinder parts of our brothers and sisters
[1:20:08] let's look at the good
[1:20:10] look at the positive look at their
[1:20:12] strengths
[1:20:13] look they're sitting here tonight
[1:20:15] because God had moved on them you're not
[1:20:18] perfect so don't expect them to be
[1:20:20] perfect
[1:20:22] they forgive you forgive let's move on
[1:20:25] brother Brown says this
[1:20:27] he says get all these little differences
[1:20:30] away from you this is your Prophet
[1:20:32] little isms little funny feelings around
[1:20:34] you for your brethren and things like
[1:20:36] that shake it away don't let no root of
[1:20:39] bitters ever get into your soul if you
[1:20:41] do it will conquer you keep love
[1:20:45] I don't care how much people hate you
[1:20:48] you love them anyway
[1:20:53] that's tough brother Joe
[1:20:55] that's tough but notice here in
[1:20:57] Galatians 5 as we try to hurry up here
[1:21:00] Galatians 5 says for Brethren 5 13
[1:21:03] excuse me
[1:21:07] for brother you have been called unto
[1:21:10] Liberty only used not Liberty for an
[1:21:12] occasion to the flesh but by love serve
[1:21:14] one another
[1:21:16] by love serve
[1:21:19] one another
[1:21:22] then say talk about them then say remind
[1:21:24] them of the infraction but love them and
[1:21:27] serve them
[1:21:28] for all the laws fulfilled in one word
[1:21:30] even in this thou shall love thy
[1:21:32] neighbor as thyself but if you bite and
[1:21:35] devour one another take heed that you be
[1:21:37] not consumed one of another
[1:21:40] let's go down to verse 17 or verse 16
[1:21:42] let's just go there keep reading and I
[1:21:44] say then walk in the spirit and you
[1:21:45] shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh
[1:21:47] for the lust for the flesh lost us
[1:21:49] against the spirit and the spirit
[1:21:51] against the Flesh and these are contrary
[1:21:53] one to another so that ye cannot do the
[1:21:55] things that you would but if you be led
[1:21:57] of the spirit you are not under the law
[1:21:59] now the works of the flesh let's let's
[1:22:02] clue in here the works of the flesh are
[1:22:05] manifest which are these adultery
[1:22:07] fornication uncleanliness lasciviousness
[1:22:11] idolatry witchcraft hatred so the word
[1:22:15] hatred there is Discord and Feud
[1:22:17] variance that word is contention debate
[1:22:20] Strife variance emulations Fierce
[1:22:23] ignition punitive zeal
[1:22:27] the word wrath is Passion angry heat
[1:22:30] anger forthcoming boiling up and in soon
[1:22:33] siding only to ball back up again
[1:22:37] the word strife is selfish ambition
[1:22:40] Disobedience Feud sedations divisions
[1:22:44] dissensions heresies dissensions arising
[1:22:47] from diversity of opinions
[1:22:51] envying which is ill will murders
[1:22:53] drunkenness reveling of the sorts of
[1:22:55] which I tell you before as I have told
[1:22:57] you in the past that they that which do
[1:23:00] these things shall not inherit the
[1:23:02] kingdom of God
[1:23:05] tells me like Paul was dealing with some
[1:23:08] people in the church that didn't know
[1:23:10] how to forgive
[1:23:11] to people that were letting things
[1:23:13] fester and they were full of Vengeance
[1:23:15] they were full of animosity they were
[1:23:17] full of hatred and strife and all these
[1:23:19] things and Paul is saying if you have
[1:23:22] that you're not going
[1:23:24] these things are not allowed in the
[1:23:25] kingdom of God
[1:23:27] see you can't take those things with you
[1:23:29] they're not going but you can take love
[1:23:33] now let's look here and turn our
[1:23:34] attention just for a few minutes to
[1:23:35] forgiveness so what is forgiveness
[1:23:37] brother Joe it means that the pain that
[1:23:38] once traumatized you it no longer
[1:23:40] traumatizes you
[1:23:43] the pain
[1:23:45] that once traumatized you from the wound
[1:23:48] from the infraction from the hurt it now
[1:23:50] no longer traumatized it has no control
[1:23:54] no jurisdiction over your well-being
[1:23:57] it's
[1:23:59] it's done
[1:24:01] just if your sins have been forgiven and
[1:24:04] are in the sea of God's forgiveness
[1:24:06] though you can't forget because we're
[1:24:08] human we remember everything
[1:24:10] but what it does is you now you've taken
[1:24:13] the power out of the scar
[1:24:17] you're taking the inflammation out of it
[1:24:20] and now it's no longer a scam it's
[1:24:22] healed and it's only a scar to remind
[1:24:24] you that you overcame
[1:24:27] that you passed a test
[1:24:29] they didn't get the best of you
[1:24:32] see forgiveness is the key out of that
[1:24:34] emotional and mental prison when you
[1:24:36] choose to forgive you choose to untie
[1:24:38] yourself from the shackles that
[1:24:40] connected you with the person who
[1:24:42] wronged you
[1:24:43] you choose to untie yourself
[1:24:47] you aren't waiting for them brother Tony
[1:24:49] to come and untie you and take the key
[1:24:51] and take the shackles off of you no you
[1:24:54] got the key
[1:24:55] and it's a key of forgiveness and you
[1:24:57] can unlock the shackles tonight and say
[1:24:59] I'm done with it
[1:25:01] you essentially say I'm I'm walking out
[1:25:05] a second time
[1:25:07] so we look here and we find the decision
[1:25:09] though
[1:25:10] has to be on your part
[1:25:13] it's a real faction Vanessa Mandela
[1:25:15] tells us this and I hope you don't mind
[1:25:17] some quotes I just like bringing some of
[1:25:18] these current event kind of quotes he
[1:25:20] said reconciliation does not mean
[1:25:22] forgetting or trying to bury the pain of
[1:25:24] the conflict but that reconciliation
[1:25:26] means working together to correct the
[1:25:28] legacy of the past and justice
[1:25:31] see if we're not willing to work
[1:25:32] together and we run off and we run and
[1:25:34] we say well I'm just going to pick my
[1:25:36] toys up and I'm going home
[1:25:37] we're not working through anything
[1:25:38] there's no reconciliation there but when
[1:25:40] we can have a heart of forgiveness
[1:25:42] forgiveness will breed reconciliation
[1:25:46] and in tune reconciliation brings
[1:25:48] restoration and to restore a brother to
[1:25:51] restore a sister that should be our
[1:25:53] ambition that should be our goal that
[1:25:55] should be our desire
[1:25:57] right
[1:25:59] see the Bible tells us in Ephesians 4 32
[1:26:02] be kind one to another tenderhearted
[1:26:06] forgiving one another so it involves an
[1:26:10] intentional decision to let go of the
[1:26:13] resentment
[1:26:14] oh my
[1:26:15] God intentional you mean I gotta let go
[1:26:17] yes
[1:26:18] you got to let God
[1:26:21] see it can help free you from the person
[1:26:23] that's harmed you Corey ten Boone how
[1:26:24] many of you are familiar with Corey ten
[1:26:26] Boone
[1:26:27] coreyton Boone she has a quote here on
[1:26:29] forgiveness and I I love it it says
[1:26:32] forgiveness is the key that locks the
[1:26:33] door to of resentment
[1:26:35] and the handcuffs of hatred
[1:26:38] it is a power that breaks the chains of
[1:26:41] bitterness in the shackles of
[1:26:42] selfishness so otherwise unforgiveness
[1:26:45] is selfishness I'm gonna hold this
[1:26:47] because it makes you feel like you got
[1:26:49] something over somebody else
[1:26:51] and she also says forgiveness is the
[1:26:53] greatest gift that you can give yourself
[1:26:57] the greatest gift that you can give
[1:27:00] yourself is to give yourself forgiveness
[1:27:03] forgiven that person that's wrong to you
[1:27:05] now she was in a a concentration camp
[1:27:09] she was in ravensburg concentration camp
[1:27:11] and after the World War II was over and
[1:27:14] uh the camp was liberated and she became
[1:27:16] a speaker and went around the world and
[1:27:18] traveled she was in a church in Munich
[1:27:19] and she was there preaching on
[1:27:21] forgiveness sins being forgiven and the
[1:27:24] Sea of God's forgiveness no longer to be
[1:27:26] remembered anymore and yet when she's
[1:27:28] there and she dismisses and the service
[1:27:30] is over stands up a man-balding man and
[1:27:34] she says all of a sudden all the emotion
[1:27:37] of the past it was the guard of the
[1:27:40] Ravens Brook camp
[1:27:44] now she says it like this it came back
[1:27:46] with a rush huge room with the horse
[1:27:49] overhead lights pathetic pile of dresses
[1:27:51] and shoes in the center of the floor the
[1:27:53] shame of walking naked past this man I
[1:27:56] could see my sister's frail form ahead
[1:27:58] of me ribs sharp beneath the parchment
[1:28:00] skin Betsy oh how thin you are Betsy and
[1:28:03] I she said they were they were held
[1:28:05] because they they were protecting Jews
[1:28:06] and he come up to her and he said what a
[1:28:09] fine message crawling
[1:28:11] how good is this to know that our sins
[1:28:13] are at the bottom of the sea so she went
[1:28:16] on and on and on about forgiveness but
[1:28:20] she has yet to forgive this man
[1:28:23] in the Nazi regime for what they did to
[1:28:26] the Jewish people and to what they did
[1:28:27] to her and her family she lost her dad
[1:28:29] her brother and her sister in the
[1:28:31] concentration camp
[1:28:33] she had a right
[1:28:35] to hold on to it humanly speaking but
[1:28:38] she had to find forgiveness in the midst
[1:28:40] of her pain
[1:28:42] and she said this man came up to her and
[1:28:44] he said since the war is over I became a
[1:28:47] Christian and I wanted to come to you
[1:28:49] and say
[1:28:52] I'm going to come and ask you to forgive
[1:28:54] me for my Injustice for my wrong and she
[1:28:57] said she fumbled around in her purse
[1:28:58] because she didn't want to forgive just
[1:29:01] like us
[1:29:02] it's hard you fumble around with it but
[1:29:06] you know if you're going to be forgiven
[1:29:08] then you must forgive
[1:29:12] let me just tell it in her words
[1:29:15] she says
[1:29:18] I stood there with a coldness clutching
[1:29:21] my heart but forgiveness is not an
[1:29:23] emotion
[1:29:24] I knew that too serious forgiveness is
[1:29:27] an act of Will and the will can function
[1:29:30] regardless of the temperature of the
[1:29:32] heart
[1:29:33] how beautifully road is that
[1:29:36] she said Jesus help me I pray silently
[1:29:38] and I can lift my hand and I can do that
[1:29:40] much but you supply the feelings she
[1:29:43] said and wouldn't leave mechanically I
[1:29:45] thrust my hand into into his stressed
[1:29:48] out one and as I did an incredible thing
[1:29:50] took place a current started in my
[1:29:53] shoulder rates down my arms sprang into
[1:29:55] the joints hands and then this healing
[1:29:58] warmth seemed to flood my whole being
[1:30:00] bringing tears to my eyes
[1:30:03] I forgive you brother I cried with all
[1:30:06] my
[1:30:09] she said for a long moment we grasp each
[1:30:12] other's hands a former guard and a
[1:30:14] former prisoner I had never known God's
[1:30:17] love so intensely as I did then
[1:30:22] you know we've seen churches in the
[1:30:24] South that have a bell in the tower
[1:30:27] right
[1:30:28] and there's a rope
[1:30:30] you take that rope and you just pull
[1:30:32] that rope in that building ding dong
[1:30:34] ding dong and that's exactly what it is
[1:30:37] to hold to a grudge as long as you're
[1:30:39] holding to it you're just yanking the
[1:30:41] chain and it's dinging it's reminding
[1:30:43] you of everything that they've done to
[1:30:45] you
[1:30:46] but if you let go of that rope tonight
[1:30:49] eventually that Bell is going to stop
[1:30:51] swinging it's
[1:30:52] that Bell is going to stop dinging that
[1:30:54] Bell is going to stop donging and that
[1:30:56] Bell is going to become quiet and that
[1:30:58] bail is going to become Motionless
[1:31:01] so I'm asking you tonight you have to
[1:31:03] find forgiveness you have to let go of
[1:31:06] the Rope you have to let the bail stop
[1:31:08] ringing in your life
[1:31:11] it's time to take your hands off the
[1:31:13] Rope
[1:31:14] I say God I want to find tonight within
[1:31:17] my heart of hearts forgiveness
[1:31:20] in the midst of my pain she went through
[1:31:22] a lot of pain
[1:31:23] lost all those that were dear to her
[1:31:25] over some Wicked regime
[1:31:28] she went through a lot of hardships and
[1:31:30] solitary confinement she was beat she
[1:31:32] was doing a very a strong Injustice and
[1:31:36] she could have let that dictate her life
[1:31:40] but she was she chose to forgive
[1:31:43] and when she chose to forgive she felt
[1:31:45] the love of God like she never felt
[1:31:47] before and I'm telling us tonight that
[1:31:49] if we choose to forgive you will you
[1:31:52] will feel the love of God like you've
[1:31:53] never felt before
[1:31:55] because not only do you do yourself a
[1:31:57] favor you're releasing somebody from a
[1:32:01] debt that they can't pay
[1:32:03] let me end with this
[1:32:07] resistance if you would you make your
[1:32:09] way back
[1:32:13] program tells us in the message the
[1:32:15] program churches he says now try to do
[1:32:17] something good and just keep
[1:32:20] he says just keep being good
[1:32:25] Oh No Malice no grudges don't let any
[1:32:27] bitterness no matter how bad the person
[1:32:29] is and how bad they talk about you don't
[1:32:32] you never think evil in your heart
[1:32:34] against them
[1:32:35] oh man
[1:32:38] are you sure take the fun out of holding
[1:32:40] The Grudge
[1:32:42] for look think about it never let it in
[1:32:44] your heart against him call because
[1:32:46] right there the devil was set right in
[1:32:48] their work upon something right there
[1:32:50] just keep it all covered up with Godly
[1:32:53] love confession and making right and do
[1:32:56] good to those that do evil to you he
[1:32:59] says we're not the judge God is a judge
[1:33:01] and you don't want to you don't want
[1:33:03] that poor fella to be Cast Away would
[1:33:05] you certainly not no matter who they are
[1:33:07] you wouldn't want that so try to be kind
[1:33:10] to them
[1:33:11] so to say that we forgive is not saying
[1:33:14] that the consequences of their behavior
[1:33:17] is not just or that that you forgive
[1:33:21] them or you forget it that they were
[1:33:22] that they're not wrong for not doing it
[1:33:24] but what you're saying is I'm forgiving
[1:33:25] you and I'm turning now it over to God
[1:33:29] now the judgment is not my judgment it's
[1:33:33] God's judgment and you're wrong in me is
[1:33:36] between you and God not me and you
[1:33:38] anymore and you can choose to let that
[1:33:40] person off of that brother Brown says
[1:33:42] endure to the door if you just play
[1:33:44] something soft to solar hands we bring
[1:33:45] this to a close he says you know what a
[1:33:47] blessing is how many knows what a
[1:33:48] blessing is
[1:33:50] he goes do something good for somebody
[1:33:54] well man we're gonna walk out of here
[1:33:55] and everybody's gonna be blessed
[1:33:58] that's right if you have a neighbor or
[1:34:00] somebody that's done you an injustice
[1:34:01] remember this for me don't you never
[1:34:03] turn him down take him to God in prayer
[1:34:05] and see what a different attitude you'll
[1:34:08] have
[1:34:10] if you're sincere in your prayer and you
[1:34:12] stand shoulder to shoulder with him and
[1:34:13] and though he's done you wrong in
[1:34:15] Injustice but just he said just take
[1:34:17] that man to God and stand there in the
[1:34:20] presence of the father one time and say
[1:34:22] father my neighbor let me put it like
[1:34:24] this my brother
[1:34:26] my sister here has done me wrong he says
[1:34:31] watch when you go to telling his wrong
[1:34:33] it's not only help him but it'll help
[1:34:35] you also you'll see what he's been
[1:34:37] through in the Temptations and things
[1:34:39] it'll change your attitude toward that
[1:34:41] brother it'll help him also and you're
[1:34:44] always doing good when you're praying
[1:34:46] one for another
[1:34:48] but see Satan wants you to embrace the

[1:35:31] if you have a choice tonight
[1:35:33] there's a lot of things people can take
[1:35:34] from you
[1:35:36] but tonight they cannot take your your
[1:35:38] choice to trust God in the midst of your
[1:35:40] pain and they cannot
[1:35:43] take your choice to let go of the
[1:35:45] infraction that's on you tonight that's
[1:35:48] on us tonight
[1:35:50] and brother Brown says now he keep us
[1:35:51] separated shooting one another
[1:35:54] goddess let me end with this he goes if
[1:35:57] I found Grace in your sight through God
[1:35:59] and you take my word for this brother
[1:36:01] how many believe him be a prophet
[1:36:04] come on there's got to be more hands
[1:36:06] than that you believe him to be a
[1:36:08] prophet tonight
[1:36:09] he says if I found Grace in your sight
[1:36:11] this is a Great Commission
[1:36:13] you take my word for this brother if you
[1:36:15] want to be a blessing and get a blessing
[1:36:17] when a man has done you wrong and he's
[1:36:20] absolutely justly I mean he has done you
[1:36:23] wrong and you know that he's done you
[1:36:25] wrong he's done you evil
[1:36:28] he said don't mention that
[1:36:33] don't mention it
[1:36:34] [Music]
[1:36:36] don't mention it
[1:36:38] so what do you mean brother that means
[1:36:40] he's saying don't go tell everybody
[1:36:41] about the hurt
[1:36:42] [Music]
[1:36:44] don't go tell everybody about the womb
[1:36:46] don't mention it but it said take that
[1:36:49] brother in prayer
[1:36:51] lift that brother up in prayer he says
[1:36:54] you take him the prayer before God and
[1:36:56] don't take it in the way of just a
[1:36:58] selfish and say well I'm supposed to do
[1:36:59] this but you stand there shoulder to
[1:37:02] shoulder and stand in the presence of
[1:37:04] God our Father and we pray and a prayer
[1:37:06] should be made in the presence of God
[1:37:08] father here's my brother he is justly he
[1:37:11] deserves punishment because he's done me
[1:37:13] evil and I don't see why he's done this
[1:37:15] but he says then you let God go to
[1:37:17] talking to you you let God go to talking
[1:37:21] to you and you'll see maybe what that
[1:37:23] man's been through the devil has Twisted
[1:37:25] him up somewhere caused him to do that
[1:37:27] though he's absolutely wrong before you
[1:37:29] leave the Throne of God you'll be
[1:37:31] feeling sorry for that man you'll be
[1:37:34] sympathizing with that brother and when
[1:37:35] you get big get back down to Earth again
[1:37:38] you'll go over the end and you'll and
[1:37:40] you'll Shake That brother's hand because
[1:37:42] you know what he's been through
[1:37:45] you can't stand with the mortal and the
[1:37:48] presence of God and condemn anybody
[1:37:51] I don't believe it no sir even if he's a
[1:37:54] ranked sinner
[1:37:56] for none of you tonight will ranked
[1:37:58] sinners
[1:38:00] and if you've been wronged
[1:38:02] and that person justly has hurt you
[1:38:05] say tonight you take them to God In
[1:38:07] Prayer
[1:38:09] if you got a choice to make
[1:38:10] [Music]
[1:38:13] you got a choice
[1:38:15] maybe you're stuck in unforgiveness
[1:38:20] but you don't have to stay there tonight
[1:38:23] maybe you're holding on to something
[1:38:25] hoping wishing praying that someday
[1:38:28] they're going to come they'll make this
[1:38:29] right
[1:38:30] but that's not your responsibility your
[1:38:33] responsibility says I'm Letting Go
[1:38:35] I'm Letting Go
[1:38:37] why don't you just bow your heads for a
[1:38:38] minute as we close
[1:38:39] [Music]
[1:38:41] as we bring this service to a close
[1:38:44] tonight I want to teach of you tonight
[1:38:46] to Search Your Heart
[1:38:50] to where you've been wrong maybe it was
[1:38:51] maybe it was brother Joe
[1:38:54] that hurts you but I can promise you I
[1:38:56] didn't do it intentionally
[1:38:59] I didn't do it because I don't love you
[1:39:02] I did it because I'm human and I'm not
[1:39:03] perfect
[1:39:05] it's not because brother Tim doesn't
[1:39:06] love your brother Timothy or brother
[1:39:08] Aaron or heaven forbid your mom and dad
[1:39:12] or your best friend
[1:39:15] because we're human we're not perfect
[1:39:16] we're going to foul things up
[1:39:19] but I want you to find that person
[1:39:22] that's that you haven't relinquished
[1:39:25] from that debt tonight
[1:39:26] [Music]
[1:39:28] and I want you to say God
[1:39:30] [Music]
[1:39:33] they hurt me
[1:39:35] they were my best friend they were the
[1:39:37] preacher they were this one that one
[1:39:38] whatever but tonight Lord
[1:39:42] I want to find forgiveness
[1:39:44] in the midst of my pain
[1:39:47] God help me tonight
[1:39:49] to let go of this I know it's an action
[1:39:52] that I got to be willing freely to let
[1:39:55] go of but I need you like Corey ten
[1:39:58] Boone needed you to help her extend the
[1:40:01] hand to that guard who beat her who
[1:40:04] watched her sister die
[1:40:07] [Music]
[1:40:08] God help me tonight
[1:40:10] got my hand is up tonight
[1:40:13] help me to have a heart that'll forgive
[1:40:15] when maybe comments are made snide
[1:40:18] comments
[1:40:20] Lord help me to have that attitude
[1:40:23] I don't want to hold this over my
[1:40:24] brother hold this over my sister
[1:40:27] if that's you tonight
[1:40:29] just lift your hand up to God say God
[1:40:31] sincerely
[1:40:32] I'm Letting Go with this thing I'm
[1:40:34] letting go of this hurt
[1:40:35] there's a balm in Gilead that's here
[1:40:37] tonight to heal that wound God sees your
[1:40:40] hands can I seize your hands tonight but
[1:40:42] more importantly God knows your heart
[1:40:44] if you really mean that tonight whether
[1:40:46] you lifted your hand up or not
[1:40:49] it's on you you go from this service
[1:40:51] tonight you will be held responsible
[1:40:54] for what you do with Jesus called Christ
[1:40:56] because he came tonight in a personal
[1:40:58] way to tell you it's time to forgive
[1:40:59] it's time to let go it's time to quit
[1:41:02] talking about it it's time to quit
[1:41:04] rehashing the incident in the scar and
[1:41:07] let's move on we're a family of God
[1:41:14] father tonight you see the needs and you
[1:41:17] see this thought that you laid on My
[1:41:18] Heart Lord
[1:41:20] and Lord I even searched my heart as I
[1:41:22] begin to study this and recognize
[1:41:23] whatever things that I was holding on to
[1:41:25] maybe comments that were said down
[1:41:27] through the years Lord the way I was
[1:41:30] treated this one and that one Lord I
[1:41:31] know those things were regardless if
[1:41:33] they were as unintentional or if they
[1:41:34] were a willful act
[1:41:36] you said we must forgive our trespasses
[1:41:38] or those that trespass against us if we
[1:41:41] expect to be forgiven
[1:41:43] so Lord tonight
[1:41:45] I ask that you would help even like
[1:41:47] Tabernacle
[1:41:48] men and women boys and girls young and
[1:41:50] old tonight Lord even those that on the
[1:41:51] Stream
[1:41:53] Lord help us to find forgiveness
[1:41:56] in the midst of this pain Lord let the
[1:41:59] pain go and the hurts of sidelord and
[1:42:01] maybe just move on and be able to look
[1:42:03] at our brother and I with love
[1:42:05] put our arms around him and said I know
[1:42:07] where you've been I know you didn't mean
[1:42:09] to do that
[1:42:10] so father I ask tonight that there be a
[1:42:12] healing agent here
[1:42:14] Lord you had comfort those hearts
[1:42:16] tonight
[1:42:17] Lord I know this may be a sobering type
[1:42:19] of message but father I pray that it was
[1:42:21] very direct and very intentional that it
[1:42:23] was exactly what was needed for the body
[1:42:29] I ask that you move Lord tonight in a
[1:42:31] special way and fathers our young people
[1:42:32] leave tonight and go off on the trip
[1:42:35] Lord no doubt there may be some
[1:42:37] infractions that take place on the bus

[1:42:40] been things take place at other camps
[1:42:42] and things that were said this young
[1:42:44] person against that when Lord Satan
[1:42:46] trying to get in and cause division God
[1:42:48] made we even as a young person tonight
[1:42:50] forgive
[1:42:51] so that we can be forgiven Lord we love
[1:42:54] you tonight

[1:42:58] us to be more like you
[1:43:00] bring us into your image Lord give us
