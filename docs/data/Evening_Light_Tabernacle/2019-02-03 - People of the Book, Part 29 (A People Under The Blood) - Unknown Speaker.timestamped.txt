[32:48] among us as you just come down among the
[32:51] Saints today revealing yourself to the
[32:56] songs of praise Lord reminding us of a
[32:59] divine promise Norden there is a perfect
[33:03] image that image you have of us in your
[33:06] mind before the world began that word
[33:09] that spoke of us let us come and match
[33:13] that word Lord
[33:14] that's the oppening Lord that spirit
[33:18] body Lord for we have one waiting and I
[33:22] pray Lord you bless us today as we look
[33:24] into the word may you minister to hearts
[33:27] and lives and just open up our
[33:30] understanding God Lord that we can just
[33:34] see the hope of our calling let us find
[33:36] that vein of anointing and speak as an
[33:40] oracle of God in Jesus name Amen amen
[33:45] god bless you let's look over here
[33:48] hebrews chapter 9 and we're going to
[33:50] read from verse 1 this morning we just
[33:54] welcome you today as we're here in the
[33:57] name of the lord a man
[33:59] gathered together in his name that's his
[34:02] promise for us amen hebrews chapter 9
[34:07] and verse 1 then verily the first
[34:10] covenant had also ordinances of divine
[34:13] service and the worldís sanctuary but
[34:17] there was a tabernacle made the first
[34:19] wherein was the candlestick and the
[34:22] table and the shewbread which is called
[34:25] the sanctuary and after the second Vail
[34:28] the tabernacle which is called the
[34:31] holiest of holies which had the golden
[34:35] censer and the Ark of the Covenant
[34:38] overlaid roundabout with gold where ian
[34:41] was the golden pot that had
[34:43] mana and Aaron's rod that budded and
[34:46] tables of the Covenant and over it the
[34:49] cherubims of glory shadowing the mercy
[34:52] seat of which we cannot now speak
[34:55] particularly amen god bless you will
[34:58] that let you have your seat today we're
[35:01] going to be speaking about a people that
[35:04] is under the blood a man how many
[35:06] believes were people under the blood
[35:08] this morning a man Jesus of course would
[35:12] type out every Redemption promise in
[35:16] every manner I mean he was a perfect
[35:19] match peace to the Old Testament and the
[35:23] sacrificial lamb would portray him in
[35:26] almost every way possible first he would
[35:29] be born in a stable as a lamb and there
[35:32] would be shepherds there would be the
[35:34] first to find that the newborn lamb and
[35:37] this lamb would be killed upon the
[35:40] brazen altar and again that the brazen
[35:44] altar where the lamb was slain was not
[35:47] in heaven but rather it was the cross
[35:50] and even though it was a wooden cross it
[35:53] was represented as brass because of all
[35:57] the judgment of God was that was due to
[36:01] mankind was poured out upon him and
[36:05] there up on the altar of his cross he
[36:09] was crucified this is also typed as the
[36:12] brass serpent in the wilderness and you
[36:15] would wonder well how in the world could
[36:17] a brass serpent represent Jesus Christ
[36:20] but it represented it in this is that he
[36:24] became sin for us and he was crucified
[36:28] that paying the penalty of sin and it's
[36:32] the only cure for the serpent bite we
[36:35] know we are in this body because of the
[36:37] bite of the serpent a man that we were
[36:40] we were born in sin and shape and
[36:43] iniquity but jesus paid it all amen and
[36:47] we're people today of full Redemption we
[36:50] thank God for that
[36:51] but as we know brother Branham would
[36:54] tell
[36:55] was in the voice of the God in the last
[36:57] days he said it contrasts all Bible
[37:00] prophecies he was born in the spring
[37:03] like all lambs are born why was he born
[37:07] in a barn instead of a house he was a
[37:09] lamb why was he not just run up to the
[37:12] altar or the altar where he was nailed
[37:14] to the cross he was led to the cross
[37:17] you lead the Sheep to the slaughter and
[37:20] he was a lamb he was born when lambs are
[37:24] born in every way he would type the the
[37:28] Old Testament lamb as he would become
[37:31] the sacrifice to become wounded for our
[37:34] transgressions and bruised for our
[37:37] iniquity many would think while he was
[37:40] just a man and as I said you as a man
[37:42] you've made yourself God and that's the
[37:44] reason that they crucified but no he was
[37:47] God and he made himself a man he died as
[37:51] a man but in doing so he became the
[37:54] sacrificial lamb upon the brazen altar
[37:57] of his cross and bore our judgment he
[38:01] came all the way from heaven so that he
[38:03] could make a way back from mankind and I
[38:07] want to emphasize this again this
[38:10] morning he came from heaven the Bible
[38:12] said in John 3:13 that he would say it
[38:16] like this he said no man can come down
[38:18] from heaven it's I except he that is in
[38:23] heaven and he said even the Son of Man
[38:26] which is in heaven so there again he he
[38:29] would say it no one could go into heaven
[38:32] except he that came down from heaven
[38:34] because heaven had been sealed off to
[38:37] mankind but he had to come from heaven
[38:40] so that he could make a way back for man
[38:43] aren't you glad that this one was not
[38:46] just content to stay in the heavens and
[38:48] forget the earth and man and forget us
[38:51] as his sons and daughters but rather he
[38:54] would come all the way from glory leave
[38:57] the father's throne and come here as a
[39:00] man to pay redemptions price to make a
[39:04] way back for you to go to heaven and
[39:07] and now so the Earth's of course was
[39:10] made to be an extension of heaven in
[39:12] fact in the millennium ahead in the new
[39:15] heavens and the new earth God will dwell
[39:18] with his people upon the earth actually
[39:21] as we have as we've often said the earth
[39:24] was made for man and it is here that God
[39:27] will dwell with his people and when
[39:30] Jesus came it was heaven coming down to
[39:34] man and it was God coming down as he did
[39:37] to Adam saying Adam Adams where art thou
[39:40] and it was God coming looking for that
[39:43] which he had lost a man and the the
[39:46] atmosphere between heaven and earth it
[39:50] had become clouded with a veil that was
[39:53] thicker than the temple veil I think is
[39:56] very amazing point that the Jewish
[39:59] people say that the veil of the temple
[40:01] was four inches thick but this veil
[40:04] between God and man that that covered
[40:07] the atmospheres that refused to let
[40:09] prayers to go up into heavens what demon
[40:13] powers would rule the the atmosphere as
[40:16] the Bible said that he is of a Satan as
[40:19] a prince of the power of the air or
[40:22] atmosphere and he controlled the
[40:24] atmosphere between God and man that
[40:27] would keep the communication from God to
[40:31] man and and God would consume condescend
[40:36] through that veil and he would take on a
[40:38] body that would be subject to time and
[40:42] that led supper eggs and pains and
[40:45] sorrow and troubles and he came here to
[40:48] make a way for the Wayfarer and man he
[40:51] came to make away for one like um
[40:55] Abraham and he came from that city that
[40:58] Abraham saw then looked far that he said
[41:01] whose builder and maker was God and and
[41:04] he came to he came to be the way to
[41:08] heaven that Jacob saw when he laid his
[41:11] head down upon that stone that day and
[41:14] there was a ladder descended from heaven
[41:17] and angels us
[41:19] and descending upon that ladder and it
[41:22] was all it was speaking of a way that
[41:25] God one day would when to open the
[41:28] heavens and open a way for mankind and
[41:32] God would step out of of heaven and come
[41:36] down to the earth to make a way for us
[41:39] to go back into his presence and he this
[41:44] is why you would say in John 14 I am the
[41:48] way I am the truth and I am the life
[41:51] because the truth is the way and the
[41:55] truth is the life and of course he heals
[41:58] the way in the truths and the life and
[42:01] he said no one can come up to the Father
[42:04] except by me this is the only way you'll
[42:07] ever get to heaven I think that's very
[42:09] important that we stand there on that
[42:11] position in a day and time like when one
[42:14] of the messengers to Sodom Billy Graham
[42:17] has said I'm you know I was quoted as
[42:20] saying I actually was in an interview
[42:22] where he said that that um it was really
[42:25] that there's all kinds of ways that you
[42:29] can come to God and Jesus is one of
[42:31] those ways he is not one of those ways
[42:33] he is the only way to God and that's
[42:38] through Jesus Christ hey man and so he
[42:41] would he would I'd sleep I want you to
[42:43] remember I you know I made him a
[42:45] statement the other day he didn't die in
[42:46] the heavens he did but he died on the
[42:48] earth but he actually his cross his
[42:51] altar was on the earth but he died there
[42:55] on that altar on that cross suspended
[42:59] between heavens and earth and he did it
[43:03] to make a way back for you and me I want
[43:08] you to notice he didn't die on the earth
[43:10] and he didn't die in the heavens he died
[43:12] in the place and to make a way there
[43:15] through that dimension in order that we
[43:18] could go there that that dimension could
[43:22] be open to us well that we could come
[43:25] into the presence of God it'll also be
[43:28] in that very place that very place that
[43:30] he came to
[43:31] Dimas as brother branham would say it
[43:33] that the the space that he came to
[43:36] redeem us that we will actually meet him
[43:39] in the air that very place in the
[43:41] district shows you them the way is going
[43:44] to be open and clear to the people of
[43:47] the end time to leave from this
[43:50] dimension here of life mattering time
[43:54] and go into that heavenly realm of the
[43:57] eternal T's so he would he would die
[43:59] between the heavens and earth to be the
[44:01] bridge through the atmospheres of
[44:04] darkness he said that no one can ascend
[44:08] into heaven except he that came down
[44:10] from heaven even the Son of Man which is
[44:13] in heaven
[44:14] you see the devil controlled dis
[44:17] atmosphere and it was a veil it was a
[44:20] veil of unbelief that clouded the
[44:22] atmosphere and placed this veil between
[44:25] God and man and it's you you think of
[44:29] them for its thick veil this is much
[44:31] more thicker than any temple veil and
[44:35] man it is the whole atmospheres of demon
[44:38] anointing and demon powers there to try
[44:43] to ward off the blessings of God and
[44:46] Jesus came thus through that very
[44:49] through through those veils of darkness
[44:52] that separated God and man's had become
[44:55] one of us now brother Branham Metellus
[44:58] fish in the mighty conquer he said did
[45:01] you ever know the Bible said he ascended
[45:03] on up on high far above every every
[45:07] through every heaven and this earth
[45:09] belong to the devil through the fall
[45:12] this earth was given to the devil every
[45:15] kingdom of this world is governed by the
[45:17] devil we hate to think that but the
[45:19] Bible says it is there so little spoke
[45:23] of this ascension it is one of the
[45:25] greatest days when he ascended up
[45:28] because all over the earth since that
[45:31] day in the Garden of Eden that sin was
[45:34] committed all heavens was shut off from
[45:37] mankind Satan is the Prince of the power
[45:40] of the air that's right why are the fall
[45:43] from heaven Oh Lucifer no one could see
[45:46] in the glory no man could understand
[45:48] because the power is just above us
[45:51] heaven means the atmospheres above it
[45:54] then all of these powers were shut off
[45:57] from mankind because of sin and you
[46:01] notice even the Old Testament Saints
[46:04] could not rise and go into his presence
[46:07] because there was not a blood yet that
[46:10] had been shed that could cleanse sin
[46:12] were that a single man could come into
[46:15] the presence of the Almighty God and now
[46:19] and again he was said there was a midst
[46:22] of sin over the earth the and the blood
[46:25] of bulls and calves and sheep could not
[46:28] atone for the human there they were kept
[46:32] in a place called Paradise there was a
[46:35] midst hanging over sin and they could
[46:38] not ascend up only that he only he that
[46:42] come down so so again this is very
[46:45] important for us understand this
[46:48] impenetrable mist of sin over the earth
[46:52] and there had to be a way back in the
[46:56] God's presence we've been speaking about
[46:58] the mercy seat it would be important
[47:01] that a man could go let's jump and say a
[47:04] man that could go and put his hands upon
[47:07] God and bridge the way between him and
[47:11] man who could intercede it would be the
[47:14] same words that I say it would say and I
[47:16] saw that there was no man and I wondered
[47:20] that there was no intercessor and so
[47:23] because there was no man that could
[47:26] redeem us God himself
[47:28] takes on the form of human flesh in
[47:31] order to pay the price of redemption to
[47:35] make a way for you into God's presence
[47:38] now as brother Adam said as he rose
[47:41] there that days that I think of him well
[47:44] that when he had risen from the dead
[47:46] that morning that he had his own blood
[47:49] as a high priest and he went beyond the
[47:53] vales through ever sphere
[47:55] Satan in times past had men blocked off
[47:59] from heaven he could not get in contact
[48:01] with heaven and but when Jesus took his
[48:05] blood
[48:06] the first veil here it was the veil of
[48:10] death and the veil of the grave and then
[48:14] the veil in the temple and then the veil
[48:17] of sickness and the veil of fear and
[48:21] then every bill that there was an
[48:24] unveiled God to man hallelujah this is
[48:29] what it means are the breaking of the
[48:31] veil I meant the veil of Jeff the veil
[48:34] of the grave the veil in the temple the
[48:38] veil of sickness the veil of fear and
[48:41] every veil that you can name a man he
[48:45] triumphs over every one of them to make
[48:47] a wave back into the presence of God for
[48:50] you and me what a redeemer he went way
[48:55] way in above heavens of the heavens and
[48:59] this was seated on the right hand of God
[49:02] and sat down as they finished work
[49:05] that's right above all and there he
[49:08] opened a channel and God used to come
[49:11] down through those corners of heaven and
[49:13] talk to mankind in the Garden of Eden
[49:15] and Satan by sin block them but the
[49:19] great high priests I want you to get a
[49:22] picture of this the great eye priests
[49:24] with his anointed with his blood went
[49:27] through every veil and ripped her open
[49:30] and cleared out the skies again that God
[49:33] and man could be father and son and
[49:36] communed again with one another what a
[49:39] marvelous thing and I don't think we
[49:42] fully catch the real significance of it
[49:45] all makes make God is open our hearts
[49:48] this morning and her eyes and
[49:50] understanding to realize what has been
[49:53] done oh my god making a way for your
[49:58] fellowship God make it away whether
[50:01] there would be no sin no darkness
[50:04] nothing to separate you from the love of
[50:08] God hey mal notice now as we as we share
[50:13] you just a little more in the Hebrews
[50:15] chapter 2 the the Bible said he ascended
[50:19] on high and gave gifts to men and there
[50:22] was an atmosphere hung over the earth of
[50:25] darkness a gloom of death and a weary
[50:28] and that the Pereira's couldn't come up
[50:31] because here torment wasn't me but he
[50:34] broke through that veil he opened up the
[50:37] way and he opened up the veil of
[50:39] sickness he broke the veil of sin he
[50:43] broke the veil of worry a man he broke
[50:48] the veil of depressed depression that
[50:53] comes with worry he broke every veil
[50:56] that he made a highway for the wayfarer
[50:58] men walking up and down the king's
[51:00] highway pay man oh listen to the word
[51:04] this morning ever veil is broke you know
[51:08] you know what it hears every every time
[51:10] you go to start believing that never
[51:12] wants to come in and try to keep you
[51:14] from believing bring a veil of worry and
[51:17] within the veil of depression and a veil
[51:19] of doubt but I want you to know every
[51:22] one of them's already been conquered and
[51:25] you have a right to break through every
[51:28] veil ever fail of kendricks
[51:31] ever fail of Jack I had to break through
[51:35] and aquiline it delivered in the
[51:37] salvation the Holy Ghost yes everything
[51:41] you meet up he fades away Alleluia
[51:49] brother he's a mighty Conqueror hey man
[51:52] look at him as his tensor and after he
[51:56] rose from the dead then we noticed that
[51:59] as he went on then after he talked with
[52:01] his disciples the Bible said he ascended
[52:04] up on high what did he do he took he was
[52:08] here come down the logos from heaven
[52:10] remember in the beginning was the word
[52:12] the logos the Word was with God the Word
[52:16] was God and he comes there from the low
[52:18] costume and as the word becomes flesh he
[52:22] was come down here the logos from heaven
[52:25] when he went and when he went back he
[52:28] took with him the high priests being a
[52:31] high priests anointed oh listen with the
[52:34] torch light of his own but a man when he
[52:39] went down there over these powers had
[52:41] been here that accused it wouldn't let
[52:44] God and man fellowship it had been broke
[52:47] in Eden now want you to keep these
[52:50] things in mind now hold hold these
[52:52] thoughts real close to you he comes and
[52:54] and now he did his work as the Lamb he
[52:58] died on the cross on the brazen altar
[53:01] but now he raises as a high priest and
[53:08] he's going to start a priestly work of
[53:11] redemption of atoning because this one
[53:14] isn't just the Lamb he is also the high
[53:18] priest because he's taken his own
[53:21] sacrifice bigger than the Lamb himself
[53:24] and then taken his are birth and he's
[53:28] ascending now all through all of these
[53:32] veils of darkness into the mercy seat to
[53:36] shine a light of mercy and went right
[53:40] there into the mercy seat to put his own
[53:42] blood upon the seat of mercy my wedding
[53:47] Redeemer
[53:49] now send up the thing say tonight the
[53:53] Dominion domain of this earth was Satan
[53:56] it belonged to the devil but when he
[53:59] become the anointed High Priest else and
[54:02] then he gives a little illustration here
[54:05] as Aaron the high priests went into the
[54:10] holiest of Holies behind the veil
[54:12] anointed with the precious and on and on
[54:15] walk in a certain way playing holy holy
[54:17] holy unto the Lord as he walked in as a
[54:20] type of Christ with the blood of the
[54:23] Lamb before him and if when if he too
[54:25] went any other way he would have died
[54:27] now remember this is Aaron Aaron if he
[54:30] to win any other way that through the
[54:33] blood of a lamb he first would after all
[54:37] for a lamb for his own sense then he
[54:39] would have to wash in the lather and go
[54:42] through cleansing of wash his hands in
[54:45] his feet and then he would take the
[54:47] blood off of that altar and there he
[54:50] would dare mix there with it the coals
[54:53] off of the altar into the altar of
[54:56] incense and then he would take the blood
[54:58] that he was carrying and off of that
[55:01] lamb and he would carried into the
[55:03] holiest of Holies and he would anoint
[55:05] the four corners of our Noah every part
[55:10] of the the the mercy seat seven times
[55:13] and pour the remainder right down in
[55:16] front of the altar are you with me now
[55:20] he was doing this to make an atonement
[55:22] for sin amen but Jesus he is a greater
[55:28] high priest he didn't have any sins but
[55:32] he paid for the sins of the whole world
[55:36] and he became the sacrifice and on the
[55:40] brazen altar of his cross the judgments
[55:42] of God was poured out upon him well if
[55:46] you can just get a picture of it you
[55:48] know you never have to go through the
[55:51] judgment but
[55:52] Simmons there he paid it all hallelujah
[55:57] once and for all a man paid it all so
[56:04] that you could go free hallelujah now
[56:11] you could go free just like marabous yet
[56:16] and continue being a Barabbas he paid
[56:24] the price but then it comes back to you
[56:29] to have to go back to that same thing
[56:31] and accept that atonement somebody with
[56:35] me
[56:35] now what's this Aaron the high priest
[56:37] went in the holiest of holy behind the
[56:39] veil
[56:40] anointed with the precious anointing oil
[56:42] walk in a certain way the bells and the
[56:46] pomegranates around his garments would
[56:48] play holy holy unto the Lord he walked
[56:52] in as a type of Christ with the blood of
[56:54] the Lamb before him he went the other
[56:57] way he would die but Christ with his own
[57:00] blood as high priests anointed with the
[57:04] power of God raised from the dead and
[57:07] tore down the Dominion of Satan and he
[57:11] broke the domain in it when the heavens
[57:13] beyond heavens and he was come to the
[57:15] lowest of the earth and received up into
[57:18] heaven and God set him on a pinnacle
[57:20] until he has to look down to see heaven
[57:23] amen no wonder he's a mighty Conqueror
[57:25] as he stands younger today in the domain
[57:29] for ever and ever
[57:31] now Isaiah said unto us a son is born
[57:35] unto us a child has given his name to be
[57:38] called counselor Prince of ISA mighty
[57:40] God the everlasting father and of his
[57:43] domain there should be no end for ever
[57:45] and ever he will reign on the throne of
[57:48] David seating in the heavens of heavens
[57:50] far above every angel archangel every
[57:54] principality and power he tore down and
[57:57] spoiled at his crucifixion and
[58:00] resurrection everything Satan had he
[58:03] broke through that
[58:04] a sin he toured apart with a high priest
[58:08] blood of his own body he come next what
[58:11] was it was the valence sickness held
[58:13] over the people he tore it apart a man a
[58:17] man for he was wounded for our
[58:19] transgressions with his stripes we were
[58:21] healed then he went through the Great
[58:23] Valley under of sickness a great the
[58:25] great veil of sin he went through the
[58:28] great veil of worry he went through the
[58:30] great veil of fear and he toured every
[58:34] one of them down and a Sidon on so high
[58:37] and received a name above every name
[58:40] that is named in the heavens on the
[58:42] earth or in the world to come hey man
[58:45] aren't you glad for that
[58:46] think about Redemption think about what
[58:50] he did for you when he ascended on high
[58:52] brother you know that a lot of people
[58:54] are preaching about the cross and what
[58:56] he did at the cross but what about his
[58:58] ascension when he made a way in the
[59:00] heaven for you yeah at the cross he took
[59:03] your judgment but they're in dissension
[59:06] he made a way for you through the blood
[59:08] of Jesus Christ God taking that lovely
[59:11] one who had stooped down so low that he
[59:14] didn't even have a place to be born or a
[59:16] place to die and God exalted him on high
[59:20] and gave him a crown of glory yonder and
[59:23] the name above every name there he said
[59:26] today that mighty Concord since he read
[59:29] the mail into the veil of sin was ran
[59:32] into the veil of sickness was ran into
[59:35] every veil that kept man away from God
[59:38] was ran into I am the way the truth and
[59:41] the life he broke every power he
[59:43] scattered every devil and he made a
[59:45] searchlight from glory hey man what a
[59:49] Concord that he is and I'll tell you
[59:52] what this mornin he still the mighty
[59:54] conquers all you have to do his name a
[59:58] name his name is greater his name is
[1:00:02] higher come on everything else has to
[1:00:06] bow to his name every enemy has to come
[1:00:10] bow down at his footstool
[1:00:12] oh man he won't fire listen let me tell
[1:00:15] you
[1:00:15] he not only triumph over the sins of the
[1:00:18] world he come to triumph over your sins
[1:00:20] and I'm we're aware that the sin in your
[1:00:24] life he conquers it then it becomes his
[1:00:27] footstool in other words he takes
[1:00:29] possession over you do the same thing
[1:00:32] with the sickness in your body so he was
[1:00:35] wounded for your transgressions bruised
[1:00:37] for your iniquities the chastisement of
[1:00:41] our peace was upon him and by His
[1:00:43] stripes we were healed what a word of
[1:00:49] promise that is a man give me just a
[1:00:52] little more sound here now so he broke
[1:00:55] every power broke ever domain made that
[1:00:59] search light from glory brother branham
[1:01:02] sent no prophet and he stung by Jacob
[1:01:05] here when he laid down there on the bed
[1:01:07] of stone that night and his pillar of
[1:01:10] stone he saw angels ascending and
[1:01:13] descending notice in the first place it
[1:01:16] was descending and ascending but this
[1:01:19] time it was God in man ascending and
[1:01:23] descending on the ladder of Jacob as we
[1:01:25] call it where he broke every power
[1:01:27] thought every domain sets at the right
[1:01:30] hand of the Majesty on high far above
[1:01:33] everything the channel of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:36] in this dark world is laying over open
[1:01:39] for root so ever may will make comment
[1:01:42] be baptized into this great channel of
[1:01:45] his blessings and receive the redemptive
[1:01:48] blessings that he died for what a savior
[1:01:53] what a redeemer

[1:02:03] got to come in here and find out every
[1:02:07] person now has to come behind the veil

[1:03:10] intruder but I'm coming as his bride
[1:03:13] he's chosen his he left his lap and I'm

[1:03:28] been doing to you I'll tell you what
[1:03:33] just go ahead grab him by the hair of
[1:03:36] the head one huh
[1:03:38] bring on that old demon of worry or that
[1:03:41] demon of depression rapaho come on drag
[1:03:47] him up in the COTS presence this thing's
[1:03:50] been bothered me this sickness this for
[1:03:55] matter this is a day listen we've had
[1:03:58] enough of the devil accusing us before
[1:04:00] God it's time you accuse the devil
[1:04:03] before
[1:04:11] you know he died at Golgotha it's called
[1:04:16] the place of the skull we learned when
[1:04:20] we was over in Israel that you know they
[1:04:24] had they have word the garden tomb yes
[1:04:27] and is there where on gordon's calvary
[1:04:31] is what it's called because a british
[1:04:35] man by the name of Gordon this you know
[1:04:39] discovered this part of course the
[1:04:41] Catholic Church have got their own their
[1:04:44] own Calvary in their own their own that
[1:04:46] cave and and and so on but there they
[1:04:51] thought it was it was the place in this
[1:04:53] call because there was limestone that
[1:04:56] had been eaten out look like two eyes
[1:04:59] and maybe a sunken nose to hollow eyes
[1:05:03] look like up on the side of the he
[1:05:05] listen right up there is were that Jesus
[1:05:08] died and over here just down Vermeer is
[1:05:13] where that took him and buried him and
[1:05:16] it's not not a very very far at all with
[1:05:19] a whether garden tomb is but when you go
[1:05:23] and you compare the pictures the
[1:05:25] photographs of a hundred years ago
[1:05:29] erosion is made to eyes much larger than
[1:05:32] the nose look much larger and in just a
[1:05:35] hundred years it has changed so
[1:05:37] dramatically that it is hardly even like
[1:05:40] the picture that was taken a hundred
[1:05:43] years ago so they begin to research a
[1:05:47] little bit in the Bible because you know
[1:05:50] this was called the place of the skull
[1:05:52] for some reason and it was alongside a
[1:05:56] busy highway and you were reading in the
[1:06:00] Bible yourself that David when he killed
[1:06:02] Goliath he cut off his head
[1:06:07] and then the Bible said he took his head

[1:10:08] that was blind and he had no eyeballs in
[1:10:10] three days had formed a man I would
[1:10:13] start looking for something to start

[1:10:42] sometimes who we are what the blood is
[1:10:45] done for us what Cowra means and this is
[1:10:49] what the message was to do to bring you
[1:10:51] back to the original atonement and show
[1:10:55] you the power of it not to be turned
[1:10:58] into a weak and powerless Church but a
[1:11:01] church full of power hey man I don't
[1:11:07] know exactly how I I can't come up on me
[1:11:10] on the other day but it popped up again
[1:11:12] just a little clip of that service
[1:11:15] February the 20th which sister Alana was
[1:11:19] healed now a year ago and they're there
[1:11:24] in that service you remember remember
[1:11:27] she she rejoiced in that victory that we
[1:11:32] received in Jesus because I was
[1:11:34] preaching God is doing some extreme
[1:11:37] things and he's turning a people back to
[1:11:40] Bible faith to Bible doctrine Iman's to
[1:11:45] Bible word and Bible action and Bible
[1:11:49] days you're too full remember that
[1:11:53] service and all be in your heart forever
[1:11:57] amen and you know what happened there is
[1:12:00] we was singing leaning on the
[1:12:03] everlasting arms
[1:12:04] she began just to run in victory around
[1:12:07] this church went back the next day the
[1:12:10] very next day for clear skin
[1:12:23] now in that very same service you may
[1:12:30] remember this is home to some tape it's
[1:12:33] only video that some weeks prior to that
[1:12:39] I had got a little little email from a
[1:12:42] little brother over in South Africa a
[1:12:45] little preacher there I don't know him
[1:12:48] he just has written me several times
[1:12:49] through the years and you know when he
[1:12:52] wrote me this time you know I I thought
[1:12:55] you know he just said brother Tim would
[1:12:58] you just pray for me I desperately need
[1:13:00] a job and jumps are very difficult to
[1:13:02] come by in in South Africa very
[1:13:05] difficult and you know they've got three
[1:13:08] races of people they have to black the
[1:13:10] Africans and they have the colours which
[1:13:12] are the the mix of people from Malaysia
[1:13:15] and workers and whatever else and and
[1:13:18] they're called colored people and then
[1:13:19] they have another which is the white
[1:13:21] people come from Muslim most of them
[1:13:24] were were from a believer Dutch people
[1:13:27] and they speak it that's language but he
[1:13:30] said but you know with with the
[1:13:32] changings of the laws it makes it makes
[1:13:36] it very hard for people of color up here
[1:13:39] you know the colored people and there
[1:13:41] and like I said they're not Africans
[1:13:43] they're just a mixed race of all
[1:13:45] Malaysian everywhere coming maybe maybe
[1:13:49] even some African but anyway they've
[1:13:51] been there for several hundred maybe
[1:13:53] four hundred years I don't know probably
[1:13:54] as long as we have here in America and
[1:13:57] and so you know we're all pressure has
[1:14:00] come down to to try to bring equality
[1:14:04] and so you know the blacks
[1:14:07] now the original Africans have the
[1:14:09] priority and the hiring and then the
[1:14:11] then the colored and then the whites and
[1:14:13] there's a lot of people that are fleeing
[1:14:15] that country because of extreme poverty
[1:14:17] and no jobs and corruption and
[1:14:20] governments
[1:14:22] and so you know I've been unable to get
[1:14:26] a job for four months for several years
[1:14:30] it was in extreme poverty and his wife
[1:14:33] had come down with a condition where she
[1:14:36] had the third stage rectal cancer so she
[1:14:40] even he writes me and he said you know
[1:14:42] brother Jim I'm in desperate situation
[1:14:45] my I don't have a job I've been living
[1:14:47] with my in-laws and we just barely make
[1:14:50] it and I need help my brother I I need
[1:14:53] some help well my heart goes out to them
[1:14:55] you know but I mean you know take all
[1:14:59] the dollars that I have in my pocket and
[1:15:01] spreading around the poor in the world
[1:15:02] they don't go very far and so you know I
[1:15:07] thought well what can I do to help this
[1:15:09] man and I knew what I could do I said
[1:15:12] send me your address and I'll send you a
[1:15:16] prayer cloth and you remember I took
[1:15:21] that prayer cloth in my hand that day
[1:15:23] and prayed over it and I claimed the
[1:15:26] blood that was shed at Calvary for that
[1:15:28] need and I asked for a job for that man
[1:15:32] and for him to be able to get out of
[1:15:33] that poverty I'm preaching to you this
[1:15:36] morning I don't care how how what you
[1:15:39] out desperate your situation is God is
[1:15:43] filled God you say but you don't know
[1:15:48] mine yeah you don't know either there's
[1:15:50] nothing there's this is my god he'll
[1:15:53] supply all your needs
[1:15:54] did you hear me saying all of your needs
[1:15:57] amen he cares about the sparrow he cares
[1:16:00] about you man and there I prayed for
[1:16:04] that me dev for that little little
[1:16:06] sister for that little preacher and he
[1:16:09] wrote me back the other day and and I
[1:16:11] already heard from him but I'm just
[1:16:13] getting a new report and he said I just
[1:16:15] want you to know my wife has had a
[1:16:18] miraculous healing the doctor has
[1:16:21] dismissed her for two
[1:16:26] he said I've got a job with the Advocate
[1:16:30] Agriculture Department and said even
[1:16:33] there God held a job open from my why
[1:16:36] but the whole year while she was sick
[1:16:39] and didn't feel a position so that she
[1:16:43] would have a job and she's back to work
[1:16:45] and we're all that way to recovery and
[1:16:48] walking in deliverance that's a country
[1:16:59] that concludes under that and I remarked
[1:17:01] about that sister a sister laminator
[1:17:04] victory laps around the church and I
[1:17:07] said she's like Miriam she's having a
[1:17:10] victory dance because her enemy is dead
[1:17:15] and I'd say again and I said your your
[1:17:18] Yemeni is dead and three times I said
[1:17:22] your enemy is dead and another little
[1:17:26] brother writes me from South Africa for
[1:17:29] over a decade I've been struggling with
[1:17:31] an issue and I just been praying God if
[1:17:34] I could just hear those words my enemy
[1:17:37] is dead and I turned them to that
[1:17:39] service that morning and I heard those
[1:17:41] words your enemy is dead and I'm just a
[1:17:45] find that my enemy is dead
[1:17:54] he died upon the altar of judgment upon
[1:17:58] the cross and he was killed here a man
[1:18:02] and he bore Ireland permanece but
[1:18:05] however then he comes the high priests
[1:18:08] as Melchizedek in the order of
[1:18:11] Melchizedek and with the torchlight of
[1:18:14] his song blood he ascends into heaven
[1:18:17] and goes behind the veil is somebody
[1:18:21] with me now into the mercy seat turn on
[1:18:26] it with mud and there makes an atonement
[1:18:29] for sin and he doesn't leave the mercy
[1:18:34] seat he sits there come on Church
[1:18:38] interceding until the last name that the
[1:18:42] book is manifested upon here and that
[1:18:46] name is dipped in blood before he leaves
[1:18:51] that seat of mercy before it turns that
[1:18:54] everything that's felt he'd be filthy
[1:18:56] still he this holy be holy still and
[1:18:58] people are locked in their limbo amen
[1:19:02] before that happens he's been waiting
[1:19:07] hey man hey man he couldn't wait any
[1:19:10] longer on you Justin he went out and got
[1:19:14] you amen he he may not wait any longer
[1:19:18] on you this morning he's a God rich in
[1:19:21] mercy you said but I'm too far down and
[1:19:24] despairing unbelief brother Jim this dot
[1:19:28] say through the adder boat
[1:19:31] he can reach further down then what a
[1:19:35] man can look at
[1:19:37] [Applause]
[1:19:50] [Applause]
[1:20:16] he became a priest not in the order of
[1:20:20] Aaron he didn't qualify he will have
[1:20:23] been born a Levite but he wasn't here of
[1:20:26] a earthly order he was a high priest of
[1:20:30] a heavenly order and he comes in the
[1:20:33] order of Melchizedek with the torch
[1:20:36] light of his own blood and a sins into
[1:20:40] the heavens and went behind the veil to
[1:20:44] the mercy seat to anoint it with blood
[1:20:48] and make an atonement for sin and he
[1:20:52] sends a sign back to the earth that he's
[1:20:56] done it by ripping the tip of veil and
[1:21:01] I'm ensuring the way has been made into
[1:21:04] the holiest of Holies and now mercy is
[1:21:08] there and grace is free and there can be
[1:21:13] multiplied to you and me now the book of
[1:21:19] Revelation speaks of two altars one of
[1:21:22] the altars the throne of God I called it
[1:21:24] that comes brother Branham called it
[1:21:25] that and it's called the altar of Mercy
[1:21:29] or the mercy seat the other is the altar
[1:21:34] of incense you say well wonder what
[1:21:36] about his brass altar it was on the it
[1:21:38] was the cross the throne of God is the
[1:21:44] golden altar upon which he sits as a
[1:21:47] mediator between God and man I'm just
[1:21:51] gonna share
[1:21:52] some of snippets right here from the
[1:21:54] first seal and we're going to share this
[1:21:58] together he said if there's no sacrifice
[1:22:01] on the altar then the prayers cannot be
[1:22:06] received so our prayers can only be
[1:22:08] received because of the work that Jesus
[1:22:11] did at Calvary it's only by the blood of
[1:22:14] the sacrificial altar that lets the
[1:22:16] prayers go through to God and then he
[1:22:19] tells us that this blood has been
[1:22:22] applied to the seat of Mercy in heaven
[1:22:25] so it wasn't just him on the cross that
[1:22:28] the blood was shed but he takes the
[1:22:31] blood now into the holiest of Holies
[1:22:34] what's this his brother Branham calls it
[1:22:37] in the Vasile the fifth seal is open
[1:22:40] there see see many other things if you
[1:22:42] caught as him waiting on questions come
[1:22:44] to see by all right now where the ark
[1:22:47] what's the word art art is art to the
[1:22:51] Covenant the altar of incense the this
[1:22:54] the altar the brass altar is not called
[1:22:56] the Ark right the Ark is the art of the
[1:23:01] testimony Testament were Ian wherein is
[1:23:04] a mercy seat in under the covering of
[1:23:07] that mercy seat of the two chairman's is
[1:23:09] where the word he is amen if so he's
[1:23:13] laid right there the ten commandments
[1:23:15] right in the Ark and Jesus sits upon the
[1:23:18] throne of mercy is somebody with me so
[1:23:20] he said where the Ark the slain wounded
[1:23:23] bleeding bloody lamb for atonement for
[1:23:27] these odorous prayers so again he went
[1:23:30] in there to the mercy seat to do want to
[1:23:34] make a way so that we could have
[1:23:37] fellowship with God again somebody
[1:23:41] helping me bracelet so notice he calls
[1:23:44] the Ark in the Ark of the Covenant the
[1:23:46] throne of God the mercy seat the brazen
[1:23:48] altar was his cross but the mercy seat
[1:23:51] is worse his blood atones as he said
[1:23:55] where was the ark the slain the wounded
[1:23:57] bleeding bloody lamb for atonement for
[1:24:00] these orders prayers so you see he was
[1:24:03] on he was City
[1:24:04] above the arc of testimony which is the
[1:24:08] mercy seat notice now the arc is the
[1:24:13] mercy seat now brother branham tells us
[1:24:16] in Revelation chapter 4 verse and he
[1:24:20] says sprinkle it nice quoting the
[1:24:22] scripture here where they was to
[1:24:24] sprinkle it eastward and before the
[1:24:26] mercy seat shall he sprinkle the blood
[1:24:28] with his finger seven times
[1:24:31] they remember why that's far and he says
[1:24:34] isn't that beautiful
[1:24:35] seven times toward the east what is it
[1:24:38] the seven churches shall be covered with
[1:24:41] by a man a man is that wonderful to know
[1:24:48] we hear in the last days and there's a
[1:24:50] spring clean of blood for that I say
[1:24:56] hallelujah what is that
[1:24:58] that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost for
[1:25:02] the Aged to prepare people for the
[1:25:06] rapture because you can't be raptured
[1:25:08] without blood and the blood the Holy
[1:25:11] Spirit is the life of the book the
[1:25:14] seventh Church ages shall be covered by
[1:25:16] blood hallelujah Jesus blood just as
[1:25:21] sufficient in it yesterday today and
[1:25:23] forever and to ever age oh I love this
[1:25:27] to save every sinner he will ever seek
[1:25:31] person bring every miracle ever sign the
[1:25:35] pass seven times way back yonder in the
[1:25:38] Old Testament fourteen hundred and
[1:25:40] ninety years before Christ came think of
[1:25:42] it symbol seven times shall so he's
[1:25:45] showing you know fourteen hundred and
[1:25:47] seven years even before there there was
[1:25:50] a seven sprinkling of the blood speaking
[1:25:53] of how that God would through the seven
[1:25:55] ages have seven sprinklings of blood
[1:25:58] that would be the life of Christ for
[1:26:00] every age that's why I keep telling the
[1:26:05] brother you couldn't go trying to go
[1:26:07] beyond the seventh church age
[1:26:10] to another age because you're in another
[1:26:12] age there's no black there and without
[1:26:14] blood there's no rapture there hey man
[1:26:18] you so what brother Tim we're in the
[1:26:20] bride age that's right that's the
[1:26:21] seventh age the bride age where the
[1:26:24] seventh angel comes and sounds his
[1:26:26] message pulls us out of Pentecostal
[1:26:28] tradition into there back into the
[1:26:31] original Pentecostal word let me just
[1:26:35] say it it's unfortunate that they got
[1:26:38] the name Pentecost hey man that's right
[1:26:45] it's unfortunate they got that name
[1:26:47] because it brings a confusion there
[1:26:50] wasn't Pentecost they were still an
[1:26:53] extension of sanctification which is
[1:26:56] which is under Methodists Amen but we're
[1:26:59] coming here now to the blood age we're
[1:27:04] coming right here to the time of rapture
[1:27:06] age were the life of the blood now is
[1:27:09] made manifest by the baptism not not a
[1:27:12] baptism not an anointing but the true
[1:27:15] baptism of the Holy Ghost now so seven
[1:27:19] times out then he shall kill the goat to
[1:27:21] sin offering that is for the people and
[1:27:24] bring his blood within the veil to do
[1:27:27] with that blood as he did with the blood
[1:27:30] of Bullock's sprinkling upon the mercy
[1:27:33] seat and before the mercy seat and he
[1:27:35] shall make an atonement for the holy
[1:27:37] place because of the uncleanliness of
[1:27:40] the children of Israel because of their
[1:27:41] trespasses in all their sins and so
[1:27:44] shall he do for the tabernacle of the
[1:27:46] congregation that remaineth among them
[1:27:48] that is in the midst of their
[1:27:49] uncleanness what was it the mercy seat
[1:27:52] what are they now and they're inside the
[1:27:55] ark was what the law and the law to
[1:27:58] trespass one commandment was to die
[1:28:01] without mercy but the problem is this is
[1:28:07] what the law says and the problem is all
[1:28:10] it sinned
[1:28:13] nobody could be perfect until a sinless
[1:28:18] wind come but being that you could have
[1:28:21] mercy the blood had the lay on the altar
[1:28:24] and they sprinkled the mercy seat and
[1:28:27] the mercy seat is the altar were you
[1:28:29] kneel and ask for mercy oh now listen to
[1:28:32] this here a tile across the land god
[1:28:35] forbid that we ever take it from our
[1:28:38] churches the old-fashioned altar what
[1:28:42] men can kneel and call on God for mercy
[1:28:44] and mercy is rich and flowing free from
[1:28:47] the blood of the Lord Jesus now also
[1:28:50] that's the mercy that's the mercy seat
[1:28:53] aren't you glad hey man I want to be a
[1:28:56] church that has a mercy seat has an
[1:28:59] altar that people can come and find
[1:29:01] grace in the time of need exactly right
[1:29:05] we don't want to be an altar list Church
[1:29:07] we want to church say that has a seat at
[1:29:10] mercy man what mercy is flowing out save
[1:29:15] whosoever will let him take the water of
[1:29:20] life freely now we want to see Jesus
[1:29:26] brother Brendan said in awakening Jesus
[1:29:28] he said we want to see Jesus I want to
[1:29:31] see now we know that his body will not
[1:29:35] return to the earth until he comes for
[1:29:37] his church because it must remain there
[1:29:43] for sacrifice
[1:29:44] is that right it must be upon the altar
[1:29:49] he sets on the throne of God now he's
[1:29:52] making clear what they alter that he's
[1:29:54] sitting upon because his altar of
[1:29:57] sacrifice the brazen altar was at
[1:30:00] Calvary but here he is sitting there not
[1:30:04] not on a brazen altar continuously dying
[1:30:07] for sin he died once and for all but
[1:30:11] there he sits on the throne of God which
[1:30:14] is the altar all right and and he said
[1:30:19] must remain for bhaiya stripes he is the
[1:30:22] sacrifice and the sacrifices on the
[1:30:25] altar and his body cannot come but his
[1:30:27] life return that it was in Christ come
[1:30:30] back up on the church in the form of the
[1:30:32] holy spirit and the holy spirit now so
[1:30:35] you can see very clearly brother Branham
[1:30:37] talks about this throne of God is his
[1:30:39] altar notice I want you to get this
[1:30:43] because this is going to be a very
[1:30:45] special point brother Branham takes us
[1:30:48] in the church age book to the seven
[1:30:50] golden lampstands and he tells us how
[1:30:54] they were lived how that there would be
[1:30:55] fire for every age and we are people
[1:30:59] that must not let the fire go out
[1:31:03] alright so the lamp was lit in a special
[1:31:08] way first the priest took fire from the
[1:31:12] sacred altar which was originally little
[1:31:15] I did by the fire of God he lit first of
[1:31:18] all the lap that was sitting at the top
[1:31:20] of the bowl then he lit the second lamp
[1:31:22] from the flame of the first the third
[1:31:23] lamp received his fire from the second
[1:31:26] lamp and all as did the fourth receive
[1:31:28] it from the third and so on until all
[1:31:30] the seven lamps were burning this holy
[1:31:35] fire from the altar being passed from
[1:31:38] the lap tonight is a wonderful type of
[1:31:43] the Holy Spirit in the seven churches
[1:31:47] hallelujah notice now the original
[1:31:51] outpouring of Pentecost which I poured
[1:31:54] came direct from Jesus well on the back
[1:31:59] see seat is it doing his church to all
[1:32:03] seven ages and so important to say m--
[1:32:09] yesterday today and forever
[1:32:12] that never changing God in his essence
[1:32:14] in his ways and hallelujah this morning
[1:32:17] we are the people of the seventh flame
[1:32:20] [Applause]
[1:32:24] and where did that fire come from it
[1:32:28] came from the original fire that came
[1:32:31] down from that they are pinnacle that it
[1:32:34] come down from the fire CC from the very
[1:32:40] altar of God Oh hallelujah
[1:32:44] you remember when it lit your life
[1:32:49] you remember when that happened it lit
[1:32:51] your life and then in that fire from the
[1:32:54] mercy seat that blood is also fire it's
[1:32:57] a living fire is the pillar of fire it's
[1:33:00] the love God since the word hey man it's
[1:33:03] Alpha and Omega beginning in the end and
[1:33:07] then its original Pentecost when that
[1:33:09] original fire of God the pillar of fire
[1:33:12] comes down into your life when he said
[1:33:16] that since my beloved son I pleased to
[1:33:21] dwell in this one he surrendered his
[1:33:23] life to me anyone come to you surrender
[1:33:26] your life
[1:33:29] hey man
[1:33:31] then the same thing that happened with
[1:33:33] Jesus happens with you you go forth into
[1:33:36] power the Holy Ghost you overcome
[1:33:39] temptation you go out casting out Devils
[1:33:42] speaking with new tongues come out
[1:33:45] healing the sick is that right that's
[1:33:50] the kid that is that is the commission
[1:33:52] that God gave his church never get away
[1:33:54] from that the high priests this high
[1:33:58] priests was both sacrifice and priest he
[1:34:02] was no woolly lamb but he was the Lamb
[1:34:04] of God you know that must have been a
[1:34:06] strange title when John's walking along
[1:34:09] in this and that day I'm preaching along
[1:34:11] the River Jordan and he looks out there
[1:34:14] and he sees the light hanging over a man
[1:34:18] and he says behold the Lamb of God that
[1:34:23] takes away the sin of the world I must
[1:34:27] have been a strange title they were and
[1:34:29] they were not used to a man being the
[1:34:32] Lamb of God
[1:34:33] hey ma'am but they didn't know it was
[1:34:37] portrayed all the way back from Abraham
[1:34:40] because you see jewy Jews was they did
[1:34:43] not believe in and receive human
[1:34:46] sacrifices but God tells Abraham go and
[1:34:49] sacrifice your son hey man I don't let
[1:34:53] him go through it but he want him to
[1:34:54] type out what will happen one day when
[1:34:57] the when the Lamb of God would come to
[1:35:00] take a way to send the world and he
[1:35:02] would be a man and it would be God's Son
[1:35:04] oh I think I think when he saw that lamb
[1:35:09] hung up there that Ram hung up biased
[1:35:12] ram's horn and caught right there that
[1:35:14] had been spoken to existence you know
[1:35:16] Jesus was a child spoken to existence
[1:35:19] this this Ram had been spoken to
[1:35:22] existence was being held there you see
[1:35:25] it's in the Bible and man they said the
[1:35:27] Lord God will provide for himself a
[1:35:29] sacrifice that right and there was with
[1:35:33] his own lips here speaking the RAM the
[1:35:36] sacrifice into existence and there there
[1:35:41] as he goes to slay his son he god holds
[1:35:45] his hands that don't do it but there
[1:35:51] comes a prophecy that says Joe of Aegina
[1:35:53] and it says on the Mount of the Lord
[1:36:00] it's a VC another words this scene will
[1:36:05] be replayed again oh that's very
[1:36:09] mountain Lord of God he wouldn't die in
[1:36:14] Jerusalem he would die on Mount Moriah
[1:36:17] right out of Jerusalem come on church
[1:36:20] very very same place that Abraham had
[1:36:23] brought his son Isaac to offer here God
[1:36:26] now brings his own son Oh
[1:36:29] Isaac's coming along I like to I like to
[1:36:33] think of it as he comes along and he's
[1:36:35] bearing the wood firing the wood for his
[1:36:38] sacrifice and it's there now I think he
[1:36:43] knew what it meant to go to church
[1:36:45] you know your attitude toward Christ's
[1:36:48] gonna have a huge impact on your
[1:36:50] children a man you know sometimes people
[1:36:54] say well brother him I'm really strict
[1:36:56] well why don't you be strict about going
[1:36:57] to church Jesus was it was his custom
[1:37:03] hey man
[1:37:05] somebody said the other day well why you
[1:37:07] know you brother tell me you've spoke
[1:37:09] all about assembling and a lot of people
[1:37:11] were gone said what do you did that
[1:37:13] you're preaching to those that was there
[1:37:14] no now I'm preaching to you who wasn't
[1:37:16] here and I'll catch the next ones later
[1:37:20] a man is a very integral part of our
[1:37:26] life of our Christian duty Jesus went to
[1:37:29] the synagogue as was his custom a man
[1:37:33] and so he here here again we we have a
[1:37:37] custom even brother Branham would say
[1:37:40] you know he got onto some of his people
[1:37:43] for hanging out their laundry out on
[1:37:45] Sunday and and the woman's got back at
[1:37:48] him Zion legalists he said you better be
[1:37:50] legal when it comes to going to church
[1:37:54] that's one time you want to be a
[1:37:56] legalist and then you come there every
[1:37:59] time the door is open and if it ain't in
[1:38:02] your heart pray until that happens
[1:38:04] pray to God changes something right but
[1:38:08] here he goes now all of that was free
[1:38:15] here he goes now going on his way up
[1:38:18] today to the place that I will show you
[1:38:23] could meet a city mountain had to be on
[1:38:27] a certain place
[1:38:28] Isaac buried the load of the word along
[1:38:32] on his back trudging up the mountain
[1:38:35] father here's the wood here's the fire
[1:38:40] where's the sacrifice he knew the order
[1:38:43] of the sacrifice a man he knew what it
[1:38:49] was required he'd been to church and he
[1:38:52] said we got to have a sacrifice and he
[1:38:54] he says the Lord Himself will provide
[1:38:56] one so he gets a you know he he speaks
[1:39:01] that realm into existence
[1:39:03] he's calls it Jehovah Jireh on this
[1:39:05] mountain shall be seen now what was he
[1:39:09] doing he was praying when God would have
[1:39:13] a son when God would become human it was
[1:39:17] said he wasn't a man negatives of God he
[1:39:20] was God making himself a man and so he
[1:39:25] comes there upon the earth now to pay
[1:39:27] pay redemptions price and and and Isaac
[1:39:31] is typing it out prophesying that on one
[1:39:34] day on the same mount God will provide
[1:39:38] another lamb and it will not be a woolly
[1:39:42] lamb but it'll be a lamb without blemish
[1:39:45] a lamb without sin a sinless Lamb the
[1:39:51] only man that could do it
[1:39:53] his only one born without sexual birth
[1:39:56] he's only one not born in sin he was the
[1:39:59] only one that that could pay redemptions
[1:40:02] price it was not even the blood of man
[1:40:04] it was created blood so is the blood of
[1:40:07] God somebody with me now hey man now
[1:40:11] notice he he become both sacrifice and
[1:40:16] priest no woolly lamb but he would come
[1:40:19] and take to take away the sin of the
[1:40:21] world as high priests he was not
[1:40:25] he was never presented in your Bible as
[1:40:28] of that lineage of Aaron nor was he of
[1:40:32] the tribe oh wait a minute for he was of
[1:40:35] the tribe of Judah you see and that was
[1:40:38] the lineage of kings and Levi couldn't
[1:40:41] be a king in a king could not be a
[1:40:43] Levite but this high priest was the
[1:40:47] order of Melchizedek and Melchizedek was
[1:40:50] a priest king hey man he was king of
[1:40:55] Salem priest of the Most High God
[1:40:57] a man without father without mother
[1:40:59] without being getting a day's or ending
[1:41:02] of life he abideth the priest
[1:41:05] continually and Jesus was made in that
[1:41:08] order to be a continual high priest
[1:41:11] somebody with me now now the Bible would
[1:41:14] tell you where he ascended I'm gonna I'm
[1:41:17] gonna just kind of nail this down for
[1:41:19] you this morning I want you to get it
[1:41:21] New Testament doctor
[1:41:23] I mean believes were to preach what Paul
[1:41:25] preached New Testament treats we don't
[1:41:28] have a new message it didn't change
[1:41:30] because of prophet King
[1:41:33] hey man you said well the seals are open
[1:41:36] well the seals only made the Bible a new
[1:41:38] book didn't write a new Bible it didn't
[1:41:42] tear pages out of it it just made that
[1:41:45] word to live a mouth now it brought to
[1:41:53] us it brought to us the the
[1:41:58] interpretation of the parables now
[1:42:01] Hebrews 9 and verse 24 for Christ is not
[1:42:07] entered into the holy place made with
[1:42:09] hands which are the figures the true but
[1:42:13] into heaven itself to appear in the
[1:42:16] presence of God for us now we can see
[1:42:19] where he went he didn't go into a holy
[1:42:21] place
[1:42:21] that's the holiest of holies by the way
[1:42:23] he didn't go into the holiest of holies
[1:42:25] made with hands
[1:42:26] he went into heaven itself to appear in
[1:42:31] the presence of God for us now here's a
[1:42:34] mediator when you couldn't go he went
[1:42:38] hey man no not yet that he should offer
[1:42:42] himself often is a high priest entered
[1:42:44] in the holy place every year with the
[1:42:46] blood of others so the blood he would
[1:42:47] take the blood of others meaning sheep
[1:42:49] and goats and bulls and he would walk
[1:42:51] into there on a yearly basis on the day
[1:42:55] of atonement somebody help me bridge for
[1:42:59] he says but then but then he even must
[1:43:04] he be he often have suffered since the
[1:43:09] foundation world but now once in the end
[1:43:12] of the world have him appeared to put
[1:43:15] away sin by the sacrifice of himself so
[1:43:20] this is why he appears into the heavens
[1:43:22] he does it and so the very moment of the
[1:43:25] tearing of the veil at the moment of
[1:43:28] Jesus death it dramatically symbolizes
[1:43:31] that his sacrifice the shedding of his
[1:43:34] own blood was a sufficient sacrifice and
[1:43:40] that it had opened the way into the
[1:43:42] holiest of holies and now it was open
[1:43:45] for all people book Jew and Gentiles and
[1:43:50] now God comes and plain of you the veil
[1:43:54] is open were that you can boldly
[1:43:57] approach him and find the Grace and the
[1:44:00] strength that you need in the time of
[1:44:03] needs hey man oh my as he died remember
[1:44:08] when he died Stephen looked up and he
[1:44:10] saw Jesus is that right
[1:44:12] as Stephen was dying he heavens open and
[1:44:16] he got a glimpse of it and he saw the
[1:44:18] mercy seat and he said I see Jesus
[1:44:23] standing at the Father's right hand Amen
[1:44:28] because he didn't see the father the
[1:44:30] father is invincible but he saw Jesus
[1:44:33] the visible image of the invisible God
[1:44:36] spending and power and authority hey man
[1:44:41] now this is New Testament doctrine New
[1:44:44] Testament doctrine did the Apostles
[1:44:47] doctrine the one that heaven witnessed
[1:44:49] that Paul preached
[1:44:51] and that brother branham preached the
[1:44:52] same this is this is Bible teaching they
[1:44:56] were positive they knew word Jesus went
[1:44:59] I'm driving this home because I want you
[1:45:02] to see it in the Bible
[1:45:03] here's what we believe where Jesus went
[1:45:07] when he ascended Matthew 2244 the Lord
[1:45:10] said unto my lord sit down my right hand
[1:45:13] till I make thine enemies thy footstool
[1:45:15] so already there's an Old Testament
[1:45:17] prophecy laying there that he's going to
[1:45:20] be sitting on his right hand no God
[1:45:23] hasn't got a great big right hand Jesus
[1:45:25] is sitting on right but what he's got is
[1:45:32] that is a metaphor of power and
[1:45:35] authority and no one can approach the
[1:45:38] invisible God without coming through the
[1:45:41] man Christ Jesus and his shed blood some
[1:45:45] witness somebody with me now now and
[1:45:47] Jesus Jesus now answering Pilate said
[1:45:50] unto Him thou has said nevertheless I
[1:45:53] send you hereafter so you see the Son of
[1:45:55] man sitting on the right hand of power
[1:45:58] and coming in the clouds of heaven so he
[1:46:02] Jesus knew now where he would go he
[1:46:05] would go and sit on the right hand of
[1:46:08] power so now we get an understanding
[1:46:10] what the right hand is it's oh the power
[1:46:13] Jesus that all the power in heaven and
[1:46:16] earth is given under my hand now if
[1:46:18] there's two God's the other and don't
[1:46:20] have me any power is that right because
[1:46:24] he said all the power is given into my
[1:46:27] hand what they are not seeing this God
[1:46:30] just changed his mask the Jehovah of the
[1:46:32] Old Testament is that Jesus of the knew
[1:46:34] God was only changing his mask from God
[1:46:39] to man now then he says again here after
[1:46:44] sadness son a man sit on the right hand
[1:46:47] of the power of God so again the right
[1:46:50] hand of the power of God so we get
[1:46:52] understand that what that metaphor
[1:46:54] metaphorically this means it means the
[1:46:57] right hand means the power of God he
[1:46:59] would be the power
[1:47:01] authority everything that would be done
[1:47:03] would be through his name of the family
[1:47:06] would be named Jesus everything in word
[1:47:10] or deed we would do it in the name of
[1:47:11] Jesus every demon has survived through
[1:47:14] the name of Jesus every tongue has to
[1:47:17] confess that Jesus is Lord come on
[1:47:20] somebody
[1:47:21] everyman now so again the Son of man
[1:47:24] shall sit on the right hand of the power
[1:47:28] of God notice now look at this next next
[1:47:31] part we notice that notice this next
[1:47:35] part which is marked 16 and verse 19 so
[1:47:41] then after the Lord had spoken unto them
[1:47:43] he was received up into heaven and sat
[1:47:47] on the right hand of God now notice
[1:47:49] where he goes he has paid redemptions
[1:47:54] price the wrath is poured out on him on
[1:47:57] the cross on his brazen altar and he
[1:48:00] goes to sit on the right hand of God
[1:48:03] which means there the approach to God
[1:48:06] the power of God no one can come because
[1:48:09] he becomes the way the truth the life
[1:48:12] somebody with me now so he sits on the
[1:48:14] right hand of God notice now this is New
[1:48:17] Testament doctrine we're gonna go to
[1:48:18] Peters sermon on the day of Pentecost we
[1:48:20] all know acts 2:38 but let's look at
[1:48:23] some of us some of his sermon you men of
[1:48:26] Israel hear these words Jesus of
[1:48:30] Nazareth a man approved of God among you
[1:48:33] by miracles and wonders and signs oh ma
[1:48:36] listen if that's what approved Jesus
[1:48:39] don't you know that's what's got to
[1:48:40] prove his church hey man I you know now
[1:48:44] you hear people today say I wouldn't
[1:48:46] give a care about I don't give a care
[1:48:48] about miracles you better
[1:48:51] hey man you better men that are approved
[1:48:55] of God there's miracles signs and
[1:48:58] wonders a church that's approved of God
[1:49:01] there's miracle signs and wonders in
[1:49:03] fact I say if they're not miracles and
[1:49:06] signs and wonders and
[1:49:07] churches a dead church it's a bloodless
[1:49:10] Church remember cozy under the blood
[1:49:14] there is miracles there is healing there
[1:49:16] is deliverance hey man so so again a man
[1:49:22] approved a God among you by miracles and
[1:49:25] wonders and science God which God did
[1:49:29] him in the midst of you as you
[1:49:31] yourselves know him being delivered by
[1:49:33] the determinate counsel and the
[1:49:35] foreknowledge of God you have taken and
[1:49:38] by wicked hands have crucified and slain
[1:49:41] whom God hath raised up having loosened
[1:49:44] the pains of death because it was not
[1:49:47] possible that he should behold another
[1:49:49] oh my for David speaketh concerning I
[1:49:53] foresaw the Lord always before my face
[1:49:56] for he is on my right hand that I should
[1:49:59] not be moved
[1:50:00] therefore did my heart rejoice and my
[1:50:03] tongue was glad and moreover did my
[1:50:05] flesh rest and hope because thou will
[1:50:09] not leave my soul in Hell neither was I
[1:50:11] suffer thine Holy One to see corruption
[1:50:14] Oh hallelujah if I could drive something
[1:50:19] home to you just a minute don't you
[1:50:21] realize this repeats again don't you
[1:50:27] realize there's gonna be some alive and
[1:50:29] remain at the coming Lord that he also
[1:50:32] spoke there are people that would be on
[1:50:34] his right hand of power and authority
[1:50:37] somebody help him a man who who was
[1:50:40] always before him whose hearts rejoice
[1:50:43] and tongue was glad and the flesh rests
[1:50:46] in this hope because he will not leave
[1:50:49] our soul here in this hell right now
[1:51:06] she's freed estimated not had to bring
[1:51:14] that in right here
[1:51:16] thou has made known to me the ways of
[1:51:19] life thou to make me and known thou
[1:51:23] shalt make me full of joy with our
[1:51:25] countenance therefore men and brethren
[1:51:30] let me speak let me freely speak unto
[1:51:33] you of the patriarch David they look
[1:51:36] dead and buried and his Sepulchre is
[1:51:39] with us unto this day therefore being a
[1:51:42] prophet and knowing that God had sworn
[1:51:44] with him with an oath to him that the
[1:51:47] fruit of his loins according his flesh
[1:51:49] he would raise a Christ to sit on his
[1:51:53] throne he's seeing this notice where
[1:51:56] he's gonna sit on his throne new
[1:51:58] testament doctor he's seeing this before
[1:52:01] spake of the resurrection of Christ that
[1:52:03] his soul was not left in Hell neither
[1:52:06] his flesh did see corruption
[1:52:08] this Jesus had God raised up where are
[1:52:12] we're all witnesses therefore being by
[1:52:15] the right hand of God exalted and I
[1:52:18] haven't received to the Father the

[1:57:24] let's do the one who's making
[1:57:26] intercession birth back here yes by a
[1:57:34] man Colossians 3:1 if you be risen with
[1:57:39] Christ seek those things which are above
[1:57:41] where Christ sitteth on the right hand
[1:57:45] of God look at this this is New
[1:57:47] Testament doctrine this is what this is
[1:57:50] what the Apostles believed this is where
[1:57:52] Jesus sat Hebrews 1 and 3 who being the
[1:57:58] brightness of his glory and the Express
[1:58:00] image of his person of holding all
[1:58:03] things by the word of his power when he
[1:58:05] had by himself purged our sins sat down
[1:58:08] on the right hand of the Majesty on high
[1:58:13] but this is Scripture after scripture
[1:58:16] you see the whole book of Hebrews is
[1:58:18] showing that he has went behind the veil
[1:58:21] into the holiest of holies making a way
[1:58:25] for all of us to come there he entered
[1:58:27] by his own but not the blood of animals
[1:58:29] Hebrews 8 in 1 now of the things which
[1:58:32] we have spoken this is the son I'm going
[1:58:34] to sum it up of all the things I've said
[1:58:38] here is the supper Bell we have such a
[1:58:45] high priest amen oh this is a summary of
[1:58:50] our message we have a high priest come
[1:58:55] on if we got the same summary that the
[1:58:58] New Testament church had amen and we
[1:59:00] come to the same conclusion and we sum
[1:59:03] it all up we're gonna have to sing like
[1:59:05] they said we have a high priest
[1:59:09] everything's all the reads that we can
[1:59:11] overcome the reason we can defeat sin
[1:59:14] that reason we can have heat is because
[1:59:17] we have a high priest that's the reason
[1:59:21] we're going into rapture because we have
[1:59:24] a high priest who is set on the right
[1:59:38] hand of the throne of the Majesty in the
[1:59:41] heavens pretty clear what they believed
[1:59:45] Hebrews 10 12 but this man and we have
[1:59:51] talked about all kinds of priests and
[1:59:53] Aaron it works and this and that in the
[1:59:55] other what they did in the Old Covenant
[1:59:56] but then he comes but this man but this
[2:00:02] man when he met a demon he cast it out
[2:00:05] when when he met sin he defeated it when
[2:00:10] he met the devil in the wilderness he
[2:00:12] overcame him a man everywhere he went
[2:00:16] Doom Devils were starting to run and
[2:00:19] back in him instead come on him begging
[2:00:21] them a man he he was they were begging
[2:00:25] him don't cast us out before our time
[2:00:28] and Jesus let him know listen you can be
[2:00:32] cast out before your time that's why we
[2:00:38] can have divine healing come on that's
[2:00:41] why we can rebuke sickness come on
[2:00:45] somebody Amen because you say well it's
[2:00:48] his time to go well bill now was 91
[2:00:51] years old and it was time to go but he
[2:00:55] cast him out
[2:00:57] anyway come on and sickness had to go
[2:01:00] before his time even when his time was
[2:01:04] up amen
[2:01:06] he stood triumphant what's now now now
[2:01:11] what's but this man after he'd offered
[2:01:14] one sacrifice for sins forever he didn't
[2:01:19] have to do a thousand or a million bulls
[2:01:22] and goats one bud one bud this man one
[2:01:33] sacrifice for sins forever sat down on
[2:01:38] the right hand of God from now on are
[2:01:42] henceforth expecting he's sitting there
[2:01:52] expecting you to put your foot on it did
[2:02:01] somebody hang up on me from henceforth
[2:02:04] expect until his enemies be made his
[2:02:06] footstool and guess who's going to bring
[2:02:09] that into me to bring it under his feet
[2:02:13] that you come on and he's there
[2:02:16] interceding expecting a man standard
[2:02:20] error believe it expecting until all of
[2:02:24] his enemies be made his footstool
[2:02:27] well if Jesus is expecting such great
[2:02:30] thing what about you and me we are
[2:02:33] expecting
[2:02:34] [Applause]
[2:02:49] hallelujah
[2:02:51] hey mom this man sat down on the right
[2:02:54] hand of God Hebrews 2:12 12:2 looking
[2:02:59] unto Jesus take a look on the Mount he
[2:03:05] shall be seen looking unto Jesus the
[2:03:09] author and finisher of our faith he told
[2:03:14] you to believe he'll see to fulfilling
[2:03:17] it who for the joy that was sit set
[2:03:20] before him what kind of joy was set
[2:03:23] before the joy that was set before him
[2:03:28] was you and then when he was on the
[2:03:34] cross you were on his mind he knew you
[2:03:39] yet he loves you and there he oh ma a
[2:03:47] man he what for the joy that was set
[2:03:51] before whole church you know I i sat
[2:04:04] there the other day came in the room my
[2:04:07] precious little mother-in-law she's a
[2:04:10] wonderful Christian her time is nearly
[2:04:15] up on the earth
[2:04:16] I can't ask God to give her any more
[2:04:21] time here in this wretched condition
[2:04:24] when there's joy that lays just ahead
[2:04:29] and I can't hold her here any longer and
[2:04:34] I said to the family you don't have to
[2:04:36] let her go there's a joy that she's
[2:04:41] lived for all her life like Daddy
[2:04:44] Bosworth said the one I've served all
[2:04:46] these years
[2:04:48] it's fixing to walk through these nodes
[2:04:52] so don't worry about her dining by
[2:04:54] herself she keep dying by herself no one
[2:04:58] has to cross Jordan alone so it'd be
[2:05:02] great to be there and you know to
[2:05:06] comfort her as she crosses over and say
[2:05:09] your last goodbyes but she won't cross
[2:05:13] Jordan alone and if Jesus could do it
[2:05:20] because you could endure the shame of
[2:05:23] the cross because he knew out of it all
[2:05:26] he would see his seed he would get an
[2:05:29] offspring that there would be a bride in
[2:05:32] his image he would go to it all then
[2:05:37] can't we envision just a moment just
[2:05:41] what is gonna be like when we look over
[2:05:49] and we see our loved ones start a period
[2:05:55] knowing just a minute we're gonna be
[2:05:57] changed to be like them knowing that for
[2:06:06] that joy I'll go through anything for
[2:06:12] place that there's no yesterday's or
[2:06:14] tomorrow's it's all one great big now is
[2:06:17] eternity for place is never an evil word
[2:06:22] a hurt feelings a broken home place no
[2:06:32] sin can ever enter there's a joy set
[2:06:37] before us it's worth all the shame we go
[2:06:41] through this
[2:06:42] all the heartaches we go through all the
[2:06:45] troubles we go through when they will
[2:06:49] see him it's gonna be worth it looking
[2:06:56] unto Jesus the author and the finisher
[2:06:57] of our faith who for the joy that was
[2:07:01] set before him endured the cross
[2:07:02] despising the shame and is set down at
[2:07:06] the right hand of the throne of God
[2:07:08] Peter said it who has gold in the
[2:07:12] heavens it is on the right hand of God
[2:07:13] angels and authorities and powers being
[2:07:17] made subject to him so now where does he
[2:07:22] sit not upon a brass altar of gentlemen
[2:07:25] he has not laid as a sacrifice for two
[2:07:28] thousand years doing some kind of Arabic
[2:07:31] priesthood you know dying and suffering
[2:07:33] thousands of death his brazen altar of
[2:07:37] judgment was a cross but he sat down
[2:07:39] with the father in his throne and he was
[2:07:43] a lamb who had been slain and I'm gonna
[2:07:45] I'm gonna use here as my last scripture
[2:07:48] on this one revelation 3:21
[2:07:51] cause it's our scripture to him that
[2:07:54] overcometh will I grant to sit with me
[2:07:57] in my throne even as I overcame overcame
[2:08:02] and him sat down with my father in his
[2:08:05] throne so you see the way if we overcome
[2:08:10] he will grant to sit with him in the
[2:08:13] Millennial throne when he raised the son
[2:08:16] of David on the earth and will rule and
[2:08:18] reign with him for the thousand years
[2:08:22] somebody with me a man but we'll look
[2:08:24] where he is he said I am sat down with
[2:08:27] my father in his throne so he is clear
[2:08:31] even from the words of Jesus himself i
[2:08:34] sat down on the seat Abasi and it is dis
[2:08:40] altar that you come to to find Grace and
[2:08:44] help in your time of need so you can't
[2:08:47] do away with the mercy seat
[2:08:51] hey man he tells us right here in this
[2:08:53] last stage now brother Bannerman when
[2:08:56] their eyes was open 1964 if God raised
[2:08:58] up from the dead and is here tonight he
[2:09:01] promised it now his corporal body sits
[2:09:04] on the throne of God he took a set down
[2:09:07] on the throne of God but the Holy Spirit
[2:09:08] is here which is Christ in spirit form
[2:09:11] so brother Branham tells you where is he
[2:09:14] his corporal body sits on the throne of
[2:09:16] God why is this important this next
[2:09:21] quote tells you because there is no one
[2:09:25] that cares like Jesus you may tell me

[2:14:09] there and this is heart beaten out of
[2:14:11] helmet and nauseated to the stomach and
[2:14:15] I had just spoke a few days before and
[2:14:18] the Lord has spoke two words to me said
[2:14:20] Beth Lee the healer is coming to your
[2:14:23] house and the other morning that enemy
[2:14:27] comes an attack and I say I'm going to
[2:14:31] take his head off
[2:14:33] the healers come in this house and I'm
[2:14:36] not the healer but Jesus is going in me
[2:14:39] because wherever I go Jesus is going the
[2:14:43] Holy Ghost is walking in a temple and
[2:14:45] overcoming right here and I took that
[2:14:48] baby in my arms and I said Jesus I'm
[2:14:52] taking drew up before your throne and
[2:14:57] the devil has done this to my son
[2:15:02] look what he's done putting him under
[2:15:07] our feet just a little bit he's down
[2:15:13] playing as if nothing happened
[2:15:19] why the healer became by he was wounded
[2:15:24] for your transgressions and we're today
[2:15:28] living beneath our privileges and we've
[2:15:32] let unbelief come over and try to put a
[2:15:35] veil between us I want you to know that
[2:15:37] veil of worry that veil of doubt is
[2:15:41] defeated before God this is my enemy
[2:16:02] and today I'm bringing him to put him
[2:16:05] under my feet because there's no one
[2:16:08] cares like Jesus knowing that his body
[2:16:14] is a high priest in a mediator work that
[2:16:17] he's doing now listen devil man that
[2:16:22] body must be in the presence of God at
[2:16:24] all times for intercession but that God
[2:16:28] cannot see the sinner sin he sees only
[2:16:32] the blood of his own son and knowing
[2:16:35] that he set back the Holy Ghost to
[2:16:38] continue to comfort his people does he
[2:16:41] care man well he gave you care he cares
[2:16:46] man if you're sick and tired of being
[2:16:48] sick and tired of being sick and tired
[2:16:51] that's already sick and tired
[2:16:54] bring it before the presence of God in a
[2:16:56] choose your future and say today is the

[2:17:24] one more he's sitting at the right hand
[2:17:29] of God tonight 64 sermon
[2:17:35] during his mediatorial work and when
[2:17:40] that last soul is saved that was
[2:17:43] redeemed and seen and known by God
[2:17:45] before the foundational world when that
[2:17:48] last soul is saved that closes the book
[2:17:51] and then the lamb comes out and takes
[2:17:54] the book out of the right hand of him
[2:17:55] that sets upon the throne he's coming in

[2:18:36] asking for anybody to come for prayer or
[2:18:39] even raise your hands I want you to go
[2:18:46] before the throne of grace the Bible
[2:18:50] said that we have a great high priest
[2:18:52] that is passed into the heavens Jesus
[2:18:55] the Son of God let us hold fast our
[2:19:00] profession but we have not an High
[2:19:03] Priest which cannot be touched with the
[2:19:07] feelings of our infirmities but it was
[2:19:12] in all points tempted as we are yet
[2:19:16] without sin
[2:19:19] let us come boldly into the throne of
[2:19:21] grace to that mercy seat that we might
[2:19:27] obtain mercy and find grace in the time
[2:19:32] of need I want you today not to reach

[2:40:40] in vanity and pride we didn't care about
[2:40:43] the Lord but God was rich in mercy
[2:40:46] wasn't he he's a God rich in grace and
[2:40:49] the Bible teaches us you know that being
[2:40:52] dead the sin and we are to be buried
[2:40:55] with him in Baptism and then we're to
[2:40:58] raise again in the newness of life and
[2:41:02] little sister Katie has come here today
[2:41:05] and she spoke with her the other day and
[2:41:09] she's I saw Lord Jesus to come into her
[2:41:12] life and she wants to obey Him in water
[2:41:15] baptism so today we're going to do that
[2:41:18] as we take on the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:41:20] and let's just bow our heads together as
[2:41:26] we talk to the Lord a moment Jesus we're
[2:41:30] your children and how wonderful it is to
[2:41:32] be the children of God and to be able to
[2:41:35] take on that wonderful name of Jesus
[2:41:39] Lord is the song says bless that
[2:41:42] wonderful name of Jesus no other name I
[2:41:45] know and we understand that there is no
[2:41:48] name that is given under heaven whereby
[2:41:51] men must be saved other than the name of
[2:41:56] Jesus and so Lord today our little
[2:41:59] sister has been born into a family in
[2:42:02] this church but now she's been born into
[2:42:06] the family of God and it's more than
[2:42:09] just belonging to FAFSA family in the
[2:42:11] church but it's belonging to your family
[2:42:14] I asked your blessing snap on her that
[2:42:17] you would guide her all every step of
[2:42:20] her life now in Jesus name I asked this
[2:42:23] bussy amen that sister Katie the Lord
[2:42:28] Jesus said brother Tim commissioned him
[2:42:31] to go in the world to preach the gospel
[2:42:33] the baptized those that believe in the
[2:42:37] name of the Father and of the Son and of
[2:42:39] the Holy Ghost

[2:42:44] commandment
[2:42:45] that he gave us in a scripture i baptize

[2:43:14] service to close up no not much has been
[2:43:17] said about her new building that's
[2:43:18] coming up and I just want to put it back
[2:43:21] in your minds there's been a lot of
[2:43:23] things that's been going on there in
[2:43:24] that building and we've been doing some
[2:43:27] electrical work quite a bit electrical
[2:43:29] work and the plumbing is now ready to

[2:43:58] a lot of young people here to enjoy it
[2:44:00] and also heard of plans from the older
[2:44:02] folks that would like to enjoy it so if
[2:44:05] I believe it would be a great asset to
[2:44:06] what we have here and what we're doing
[2:44:08] so let's just keep that in our mind and
[2:44:11] what we want to do and we'll be no doubt
