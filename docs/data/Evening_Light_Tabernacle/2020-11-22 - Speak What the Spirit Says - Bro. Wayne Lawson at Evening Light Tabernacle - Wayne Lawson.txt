wonderful and mighty god oh my we we thank the lord today amen we are so honored to be here with you and and believe that the holy spirit has something wonderful in mind amen i just did uh got a little text from brother ron spencer this morning and he just sent a word to me and said the lord just told him that the spirit of god would sweep through the building and that we would have a a real meeting here this morning he said go go expecting it brother wayne listen for it to come and in my if he hasn't already swept through here amen we welcome it too amen [Music] hallelujah the prophet of god said five minutes in that presence means more than all the years a man could spend in school amen his word is life and we want to greet each one of you from brother erickson and the family and the church true word want to say god bless you and amen and we want to greet each one of them that are listening this morning and amen and i just want to to take to the word of the lord this morning and just a few things to speak to you today from our hearts and if we go to the book of revelations we'd like to look in the third chapter uh i think that it's a powerful time that we live and i want to read here from the 20th verse and down to the 22nd verse revelation chapter 3 for behold i stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and will sup with him and he with me now to him that overcometh will i grant to set with me in my throne now i want you to realize this is the first age that's been offered this to set with me and my throne as i overcame and sat down with my father in his throne now he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches amen we ask the lord to bless his word today as you may be seated i i want to just take a little thought from this today and speak to you on speak what the spirit saith on speak what the spirit saith i think of today of the grace that we have of having the message of the hour to be able to have a prophet of god at the age that uh that we have seen such outstanding manifestations and vindications of the omnipotence of god i believe that we're standing in a position where we've been able to see more of the power of god than any age since the time that jesus christ himself walked upon the earth more vindications of his resurrection and his power and it was anointing we we've been blessed to be have this kind of seat amen and to be able to see and i think sometimes that of course as the message churches and the men of god around the world seeing such a display of the power of god in a prophet that many times that they get to looking at the prophet maybe a little more than they're looking at the one who was behind the prophet and uh and that's one thing i i never want to lose focus of what it is that we're actually doing and what william branham was introducing to the church was a true christianity it was a true power it was a true a true view of the resurrected jesus christ and brother branham again and again would let us know that it wasn't him it wasn't him and that i think that is so amazing that he would say even anointed ones in the end time brother branham will say i wasn't the one that appeared down on the river i was only standing there when he appeared and i'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things as they happen as perfect as they are i'm only the one that's near when he does it i was only a voice that he used to say it it wasn't what i knew it's what i surrendered myself to now that he spoke through me it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was a manifestation of the son of man amen and to think that brother branham would show you that the the thing that he was projecting what he was saying was is this is not me friends this is what i'm surrendering to and to think that a man who could so surrender himself to god that god could operate like that through a human being not through an angel not through a man without mistakes not through a man without trouble but through a human being that god could so manifest himself because man is designed that he's able to surrender to the great anointing of god and that god could show his resurrection power through a human being and i think of that today because i realize that a prophet is trying to tell the church in the in the church age book and he'll go through and tell us that there will come in the last days there will come spirits in the land there will be invasions and invasions of arab and invasions of every kind of spirit as the scripture says amen that hell will be renewed from beneath and and it will enlarge its borders and we know that a prophet would announce the god of this evil age and he would say it's satan's eden and he would say hell is bullying over so all these things are pouring out into the age that we're living in and and he would specifically say that the antichrist spirit amen above all the things he wants to do is he wants to make you lukewarm formal and powerless he said but now if the if the true church the true bride is able to discern the antichrist spirit that works within the framework of the church if she could discern that spirit but not just discern it she should be able to withstand it not just discern but to withstand that antichrist spirit which is only a religious spirit and a religious spirit to take away the fire to take away the power of god to take away the reality of resurrection and i say that because amen that he is able to give us a place that we're that we're able to say that someone in this last day will discern it and withstand that spirit now the prophet will tell us that those spirits are here questions and answers he'll say that those uh those spirits those demon powers he said they're actually powerless until they can find a body do you know the devil is powerless until he can find somebody to work through amen and that's what the prophet is telling us that if we could keep the devil from finding something to work through he would be powerless is that right he meant now think about this because then the prophet of god said with that in mind of course he says it brings us to another thought that the holy spirit covers the earth but it's almost helpless until it gets into you and me god is depending on you and i the holy spirit the earth is full of the spirit of god but it's poured out but it cannot operate until it comes into us and we human beings will operate amen to think today that god is saying to the church he's looking for eyes he's looking for legs he's looking for hands he's looking for bodies he he is looking for mouths he's looking for someone amen that the spirit of god can claim them and use them for the glory of god now we've got to recognize then there's two spirits trying to operate there's two spirits trying to find vessels amen and both of those spirits need that to operate or to become powerful amen in this in this a dimension that we're living in now the prophet of god said of course we're going to have to them to resist the devil and then he will flee from us see not only just discerning but resisting and the prophet of god said to resist that devil means to turning down to resist him just to walk away from him amen uh god said a certain thing no matter what he's trying to tell you don't you even listen to him you have ears and your ears are deaf to anything else but what the spirit says now to he that hath an ear listens now see what the spirit saith unto the church and the one that's got the listening post let him catch what the spirit says to the churches now i think it's amazing that the prophet begins to tell us amen that the spirit of the devil is powerless unless he can get into something and then he tells you to resist the devil is to turn him down or in other words not to listen to the devil so how does the devil really approach the church he approaches it through word but before it's a word it's a thought and a spirit places thoughts into the mind or into the life of a person and then either they give life to that thought or they kill that thought in the channel or the womb of the mind now we find out a prophet is saying then someone is going to have to learn how to recognize the thought of the enemy and turn it down while it's still in the thought process amen and kill it resist it and then resist the devil and say to him you can't work through me i tell you this morning i pray amen that we have the church of the living god and and right here this morning i pray that the devil is out of a job i pray that the church has come together this morning to say you're not going to work through me the devil has a he has a purpose now to make you look more formal and powerless and i pray this morning that every individual in this assembly will say amen that satan you're not going to work through me you're powerless unless you can work through somebody amen i don't know about my brother but i know about me you're not going to work through me you're not going to use my mind you're not going to use my thoughts you're not going to use my voice you're not going to use my action matter of fact amen this morning maybe somebody has allowed him to do so but i say with you this morning you are to sell the devil you're fired i tell you what a blessing this morning to be able to fire the devil amen amen can you imagine i tell you this if you start firing the devil you know what he's going to say to you but i've worked here so long you can't fire me but listen you've been given the power and the authority this morning as a prophet of god said at some point the church has a authority like the father has and whoever he hires is hired and whoever he fires is fired let me give it to you in the scripture whatsoever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven whatsoever you shall loosen the earth shall be loosed in heaven there is an authority in the church of the living god that you have the power to fire the devil this morning however he's working however he's trying to work you can fire him this morning and i know that devil well enough to know he don't want to go by himself amen and he's going to say to you but i worked for your mama i worked for your daddy i worked for your grand i've worked for your family for years but you're gonna have to tell the devil don't matter how long you work for us you're fired this morning and you'll never work for my family again amen pack your bags take off amen you're not welcome here we're not going to and we're not going to make a a savage package with you amen we're going to destroy you we're going to burn every remnant that you are amen we're going to fire that devil i think it ought to be a day today that we are the fire every devil every devil and depression every devil of nervousness you want to say you're out of a job this morning amen you are to tell that devil go back where you come from satan amen this is not your home you may think i'm overboard but the prophet of god used the story in the bible when he said that jesus came to the demons in gardea remember the man who was in the tombs and he was naked cutting himself chained there and jesus went there and he delivered that man remember and he said to the devil go and what did the devil say amen amen the prophet of god said satan asked if he could stay the bible said he asked if he could stay amen and he just wanted a vessel to get into amen which brother branham uses to prove that satan is powerless without a vessel so since he couldn't get a human body he meant he took an animal body and he run that herd of swine out into the out into the lake and killed it so it tells you this amen that if the devil can get a hold of something he will destroy it he will destroy everything that he touches amen but i'll tell you this amen that jesus gave power to the church that they was able to say to satan amen that you have no power to work here amen and you have been given that authority this morning now you don't have to listen to the devil now there's some people you're going to have to listen to but you don't have to listen to the devil amen can i get some audience participant i want you to say to somebody you don't have to listen amen amen isn't that isn't that good young people there's somebody you don't have to listen to amen the devil starts talking to you you can tell him like one of the boys back at the church he'll say this not my mama somebody tells one of them young boys you got to do this or that he'll say not my mama and i'll tell you what when the devil says something to you all you got to satan not my lord you're not my god you have no right to even talk to me amen listen you can fire the devil this morning and leave him unemployed amen now we're taught that we can resist the devil just resist it no matter what he's trying you don't even have to listen to him you can just resist him amen in other words you can deafen your ear to him amen so you have a prophet saying that you don't have to listen but you've got to have an ear for what the spirit says now the scripture is telling us that the one that has an ear is also the overcomer the in that beautiful the one that can listen to the word is also the overcomer the word will make you an overcomer the word will put you in victory the word will put you over your enemy every time i think of this because the scripture says in that allowed to see an age that he knew there would be some overcomers in there and he said to he that overcometh now of course we realize that this scripture was written 2 000 years ago but it was written about somebody now don't think that when he said that he that overcometh that god has an empty mind and he don't know who that's talking about because in the book of matthew the 20th chapter we found that they said to jesus they actually said to him put me on your left hand and put me on your right hand the mother of zebedee uh's children josh zebedee and john and they actually asked and jesus said i can't give you that position for it is prepared for them which my father has given it and the prophet of god said that's for that word bride the overcomer of the laodicean age so you can see 2 000 years ago somebody was trying to take your seat and jesus was saying oh no that's a special age a special time and it can only be given to a certain people now the prophet will tell us of course in john 17 of the foreknowledge of jesus when he said father glorify them with thine own self of the glory which i have with thee before the world was brother brahman reads john 17 and tells us that jesus had foreknowledge of his own disciples in ephesians chapter 1 he will read it with paul and he'll say now according as he has chosen us with him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him and love now paul talks about pre-existence of predestination in god and so does jesus talk about it amen but brother branham brings these two scriptures together to help us now in in questions and answers to genesis 1953 brother branham actually says when god created me william brattle i was before the foundation of the world he made my being my spirit i wasn't conscious of anything as far as i know of he said but i was there and i don't believe you're getting it now but just wait a minute jesus told the disciples that he knew them before the foundation of the world and paul said that he chose us in him before the world began so he just tied them two scriptures together now some part of me ormond neville the rest of all of you here i like to include myself don't you and the rest of all of you here that's in christ jesus before the world ever began and here's my analysis of that i like analysis you know amen there's a lot of analysis there's a lot of people gives analysis but here is a prophetic analysis here is when a prophet analyzes what this means he says here's my analysis i think that the people today that are possessed with this spirit or a or the spirit a part of those angelic beings a spirit which rotated off of god that never fell in the beginning and resisted the devil's lie in heaven now look what he's saying he's tying together ephesians 1 john 17 and also revelations 3 that overcomer and he's tying it to a spirit that was in heaven that anointed the angels that come from god and that spirit was a spirit that resisted the devil now notice this because again brother adam will bring it up he says and the spirit that's joined with god is one spirit see there's not 40 spirits of angels and god and the spirit that's in you ask yourself sometime where did god get eve's spirit he took it out of adam and where did god get the spirit that's in the church he took it out of jesus christ so the spirit that was in jesus christ come from his father we don't believe in 40 spirits there is one spirit one faith one lord one god he is one spirit now you say well seven spirits but those spirits come from one spirit and that's eternal life or almighty god that spirit that was in the beginning is the same spirit that's in your life today the prophet of god said that spirit that dwells in the church is the spirit that come from heaven that god knew before the foundation of the world that rejected the devil's lie can you imagine that the spirit that god sent from heaven to anoint you was to tell that devil you're a liar amen that you cannot receive the lie of the devil because you're anointed to reject it my when i think about that the spirit had to take a body of flesh for testing had to come and flesh like others now god by the beginning know the spirits which would and would not there you are god in the beginning knew the spirits which would and would not he knew which side you were going to take he knew brother brown says he knew therefore he could predestinate he said but by foreknowledge he can tell you who would be saved and who wouldn't be saved for he knew which person would take up with with spirit amen god knew which spirit you would take up with he knew what you would believe he knew you would be like a lie or hebrew you believe truth amen now look what he's trying to tell you to he that overcometh let him hear let him hear what the spirit saith under the church amen when i think about this in 1959 why cry brother branham and clarksville he'll say this how does the people accept it the holy spirit has one message it's speak the word and go forward that's right don't cry to me amen there's the word speak it and move forward thus saith the lord that's the message of the holy ghost to heathen half an ear let him hear what the spirit is actually saying to the church amen it only has a message speak the word and go forward now here's the thing the bible tells us in isaiah 59 that god made a covenant with the church and it would be with your words and think of this and atmospheres your brother and i'm gonna try it he'll say you speak the word and i will perform it that is my covenant and it can never fail now god knew which which you would take up with he knew that you would either have a wishbone and you would wish you could be that son or he knew you would have a backbone where you could stand and claim the promises of god no matter what condition you are under no matter what condition the world is in the word of god remains true and he looked at this lord to see an age and he looked at this odd to see him condition and he said but i've got a spirit in there amen i've got a spirit in that bride that they will not consider the condition but they will speak the word of god oh i pray to god tonight amen this morning that god would awaken the spirit of resurrection in the church that the word becomes true no matter what situation they're in god didn't give us a wish bone he gave us a backbone a stand against every devil to stand against every instruction that the enemy would try to place in the church that you would withstand that devil on every move that he would make now i want to say a couple of things i wanted to if i can to make it real crystal clear to you amen if you speak the word this is my covenant he said i will perform it now listen he meant some people are waiting to speak when the church becomes anointed they're waiting to speak after the church gets thus saith the lord amen sunday the church is going to have a great move but the prophet of god says in invisible union right here in louisiana he says see it's on it's on the move is on for the bride that's thus saith the lord listen we're not waiting for nothing else the bride has received the thus saith the lord people say well what about this what about that what about this i can't help none of that i don't know about the conditions i don't know about our old bodies i don't know about the trouble but i do know that a prophet of god said the move is on for the bride then the spirit that's within me cannot help but to accept what a prophet of god said and if i have accepted it i've got a right to turn around and say what a prophet has said about the church of the living god can i say some things that are very true some things that are very true in romans chapter 8 paul said in all things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us now in all things we are more than conquerors now i know sometimes you would like to think in some things but paul didn't say in some things he said in all things amen we are more than conquerors amen i tell you this morning you are more than a conqueror i don't care what's happening it doesn't matter what kind of situation you're in i want you to hear what the spirit says to the church you are more than a conqueror amen and i tell you this if you'd fire that devil you could say the same thing i don't devil of dispressing and and uh how could i say it that old devil of depression and discouragement amen he would like to keep you from receiving the fact that you are more than a conqueror to point out your weakness to point out your trial to point out the insecurity to point out all the little problems and the weaknesses in your flesh amen to get you to focus on the wrong part of you if you can take your focus from the word part and put it on the human part then he'll keep you bound the rest of your life but if you would ever start recognizing that before there was a world before there was a star before there was a moon before there was an earth there was a god and i'm a part of that god and he came into this flesh and now deity is on the inside of a human vessel change your focus this morning leave the flesh and move into the spirit of god amen if you let the spirit begin to speak to you you would begin to hear you're more than a conqueror you would begin to hear the spirit say to you it's time to throw down this devil it's time to cast him down it's time to destroy this devil now just in case you think that was isolated to the romans paul said to the philippians i can do all things through christ which strengthen me i can do all things now there's a devil telling you this morning that you can't amen there's a devil this morning saying but that but that situation but this but this now now you've got to recognize that the devil has a way that he just wants to bring reasonable doubt he don't have to disprove the word he don't have to disprove the promise he just wants you to reasonably doubt that that is actually possible in your life but the bible coming from the words of jesus christ said amen to him that believeth all things are possible unto him that believeth then there is nothing that is impossible with the church of the living god amen nothing nothing nothing nothing impossible in philippians 4 i can do all things amen say it with me all things anything that says something different than that is a lie of the devil and i am here to resist him in every area i can amen i'll tell you what i believe there's a line of resistance i believe there's a resisting group of people today called the bride of jesus christ that they tried to stomp us out they tried to silence us they're trying to shut us up but we still are going to resist this devil as long as we are on the earth we have a resistance against the spirit of the enemy that could say well you can do all things but this but see we can do all things now anything contrary to that is a lie romans chapter 4 verse as it is written i made thee the father of many nations for before him who believed even god who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which be not as they were if you hear brother branham quote this he uses this every time as abraham he'll say abraham called things that were not as though they were but if you read the scripture it ain't talking about abraham it's talking about god amen so i got to think well maybe brother brown just read it differently than and just perceived it differently and i i read and found with iran said it just like romans said it and and he said it then he said it with abraham until he began to realize that abraham had so communicated with god until he began to take on the nature of god and if god said it was this way abraham said it was that way there was no difference in the confession of abraham and the confession of god though his wife was barren he was still professing to be a father though his body was incapable he was yet saying it was going to be anything contrary to that as a lie i want you to know this morning you've got to be able to recognize something contrary to the word as a lie it's not a misunderstanding it's not a reasonable doubt it's a lie anything that takes the privilege and the redemptive right of the bride of christ and minimizes dilutes waters down tries to rob that is a lie and it comes from the devil and you say brother wayne i heard one of the preachers saying like are you calling him the devil oh no the spirit coming out of him is though i don't care who he is i don't care where he's from or what he's saying if he takes a redemptive right from this bride he is a thief and a robber and the devil come to steal kill and destroy you so that's pretty rough no it's just like jesus preached because when he was talking to simon peter he said my name is simon next thing you know he knew who jesus was he said your name is peter next thing you know peter said that did he couldn't suffer in the flesh he didn't think that jesus being the christ could suffer on a cross and jesus rebuked him in calling the devil amen he gave him a good name gave him the rock of revelation and then told him that he was the devil he rebuked the wrong spirit coming out of peter and i believe any spirit that comes out of us amen that's contrary to the word of god we ought to just rebuke that spirit and call it a lie from the devil i'll tell you this morning there's so many voices now there's so many voices and there's so many voices in the earth that it's absolutely a hard thing because it deadens the voice of the supernatural yeah i'm quoting brother brown now amen ben is the voice of the supernatural because there's so many voices now watch brother random said lot's wife was destroyed because she loved the pleasures of sodom greater than the voice of the angel do you see watch today how hollywood voices are putting pressure on the people hollywood is trying to uh control the way the sisters dress amen hollywood controls the way people does things now the voice of hollywood becomes strong the voice of modern religion becomes strong and brother and said the voice in the enemy it tries to deaden the voice of the supernatural now watch this because everything that says you cannot it's a lie everything that says it's not possible is a lie anything contrary to the promise of god upon your life is a lie from the pits of hell now notice this because amen now there is times in great men's life where they believe their own thing and great men believe the wrong thing great men did the wrong thing watch apostle peter deny the lord at the tomb or at the cross he denied the lord remember that amen but listen on the day of pentecost he received the spirit of god that's an abstract title telling god he didn't hold it against him because he received the abstract from god that the sin wasn't held against him he meant but the voice of god changed him when he heard that voice i i think if there's been no greater example of this when apostle paul was killing christians walking on the road to damascus amen and he met a great light and paul was a great intellectual man but when he heard the voice of god he recognized that his intellectual ways was actually crucifying jesus christ afresh amen and the voice of the supernatural amen it actually changed paul and sent him another way oh the voice of god what it could do for a person i think about even half an ear let him hear the voice the one that changed paul the one that changed peter i tell you there's no greater example as of the man lazarus amen who was laying them the tomb four days gone but when jesus come and stood by the tomb the man was already dead are you hearing me it seems like it's too late to hear the voice of god it seems like it could never happen but when jesus came by amen no matter the condition amen that lazarus was in amen the voice of god had predestinated a place to cause a resurrection in that man i'll tell you what hey man it don't get any better than that does it four days in the grave everybody's saying it's too late everybody's saying corruption has set in there's no way for them to come out of it but jesus had a vision amen and in that vision lazarus was going to raise and the voice of god gave voice to a vision in the face of impossibility but when jesus called the man by name glory to god amen i know he was dead and cold i know he was in the tomb but he could hear the voice of god past the tune amen i was preaching one time on the prophecied over the valley of dry bones and he told he told ezekiel he said speak he said speak to those dry bones and the bible said ezekiel went up there and said hear ye hold dry bones hear ye the word of the lord i thought my never seen no bones with ears amen but when the word of the god was commanded toward them bones amen they didn't even have ears on their body but god made them hear a power that would take them out of any situation and put life back in them oh i tell you this morning that same voice is right here in the church of the living god and is speaking again the names of the pride of jesus christ by the preacher of this message and i i know you might think it's too late but it ain't never too late [Applause] oh it ain't never too late brother brian said lazarus it brought a man out of the dead rotten who it ought to go he said now it brought that man forth after being dead and rotten he said what should the voice of god do to the church of the living god if it would do that for a dead man what should the voice do for a church that is alive that is full of the power of god and is full of the life you know how to fan the flames of the quickening power of the holy ghost you know you know to charge something on the inside of us yes sir amen let us hear let us hear what the spirit says under the church now now the prophet of god would tell us of course that in revelation chapter 10 it's an evening message is that right pulling from zechariah 14 in the evening time there shall be light in isaiah 60 rise up and shine for thy light has come in revelations 10 it's going to tell the story how the mighty angel come from heaven the great covenant angel the covenant of the spoken word the covenant the coveted angel of the word of god will come with a book in his hand and and he'll be coming as a mighty angel putting foot on the land and see bringing everything under his subjection and power by the word of promise and and the bible tells us clearly that john was going to write this he was going to write these seven thunders and and the bible says john you seal those things up until the seventh angel sounds now if you're a bible student you know that every one of those old testament prophets knew something great was coming and some of them declared it more clearly than others in daniel 12 he talked about michael standing up talked about him coming fighting for his people when the books were open sealing up to the end time isn't it amazing that the seven church ages amen it has an end and the seventh is the end and the seventh angel is the end time prophet the evening age the token time this prophet was going to come but everything was hinging on this man coming and bringing the revelation that book to the church because the word couldn't come lest there be a prophet amen that's right the word couldn't come unless it's a prophet now how you're going to overcome this devil is you've got to accept the word you've got to hear what the spirit is saying now we can say in revelation 3 hear what the spirit says and a lot of anybody could make up what the spirit is saying but it's what it's saying go to revelations 10 and read revelations 10 and hear what the spirit is saying it's saying that the word would become open to the church under an elijah anointing to return it back to its its original faith the original power the the life that that struck in the heart of those disciples would live again the apostolic age would live again the tree of life would live again amen it would come from amen the word of god now if you can hear what the spirit is saying then then the book is going to be opened and the thunders are going to sound now i know that i know you're a very taught church and i don't want to get deep in this so i just want to maybe just to make a statement here and then continue but but many people have made a lot of things out of these thunders and and i can't help that i can't help what others have done that's not that's not within my my my grip whatever they did they did but i just want to say what the spirit says and the spirit says that the thunder was the voice of god when the seals opened and he uses john 12 brother branham uses john 12 and said if you wonder what a thunder was remember when jesus said glorify me with the glory i had before the world began and he said and a voice spoke out of heaven and said i have glorified thee and i will glorify thy name again and when he said that the bible said that some heard it thunder but an angel had spoke and brother brahm said see it was a voice of god but to others of course it's just a noise it's just a thunder amen but to him that can hear it it's the voice of god glorifying the church amen to think of this brother adam says the thunder is the voice of god when the seal was open now i know that it's very important because brother brown talks a lot about the thunders and he says to us that it would be the thunders that would bring us faith for rapturing grace pretty important then isn't it he also says to us that there had been no manifestation to wake up a bride he meant all the way up until the third seal he's still saying this but in the third seal brother adam says to us it would take those seven unknown thunders to wake up that bride so we can make a real quick assumption here or togetherness with to save a lot of reading the bride's revival and the awakening of the bride is the same thing and the bride's revival or the awakening of the bride will not be brought on by a lot of persecution it was brought on by the opening of the seven thunders which would be the voice of god to the bride church do you see what she needed was a voice to wake up that bride so then we have groups saying we need those thunders to open we need those thunders to come amen and they're looking for those things well in 1964 brother branham comes around and he says in recognizing your day in this message he said they're fasting and praying for an awakening to come he said but what's wrong with them he said they feel the pull of the hour being a christian he said but they have missed the awakening of the bride so somewhere between the third seal in 1964 he's telling us the thunders had already sounded which was the voice of god to the pride that would awaken her from dead dark denominational ideas and the traditions of mankind that had bound the church for 2 000 years in the ideas of man but listen this morning the word of god has come to loose the church of god to loose it from every tradition to knock away oh brother tim you don't know what you're saying to me this morning amen to knock away every claim he was talking to me on the way to church and i'm sitting over quiet as a mouse i bet he was wondering what i was thinking i was thinking if he keeps it up he's going to preach everything i got in my notes hey man he probably already has a couple times but i'm going to preach it anyhow amen but there's no manifestation to stir it up or wake it up so the awakening of the bride now notice this because this happens at the same time as the seventh angel that's why revelation 3 says behold i stand at the door and knock okay so a lot of people think about this knock they think i knock at the door well then we find out the door is the heart and then we find out the knock is not this it's a voice of god so the voice of god is knocking at the heart of the bride and what's he wanting to do he's wanting to come into the church to reveal the things that have concerning the bride in this last day there is redemptive rights being released under the preaching the word in this age there are things you've never thought about that you can do and you can say and you can have until you come to the church of the living god and you started hearing them preach about liam's being restored and the power of the spoken word and how the spirit of god would cast out devils and heal the sick and raise the dead who would have ever thought about these things but all of a sudden they're not just things out here their things begin to be revealed right in the individual now you think of this because he said he would like to come in to you and the bible said sup with him and he with me now brother adam interprets that sub as to reveal hidden things to you now think about this to reveal hidden things to you now just real simply those seven thunders were not something that wasn't written in the bible there's something that was written but something hidden it wasn't something that paul hadn't put in there listen brother brown didn't take us to another gospel but he brought us to the same gospel that paul was preaching this is an original bright church it's an original message now if brother branham would have said something that hadn't already been written then paul said we had to accurse him but look what he said he was telling us that it was things written but things that were hidden in there and wouldn't be made known until the last days now when he begins to come in there and he starts revealing now a spiritual food and due season if you like to read it he says something that's been hid in the book whosoever take this word or add one word so it's a mystery that's been in the book in those seven church ages now notice because when you start having supper with this one with this one that comes in the heart that knocks at your heart the voice of god that's coming in you're starting to have supper with the voice of god now it's an evening time communion the lord's supper now we have a natural communion but there is a spiritual communion a fellowship and it's it's actually a beautiful type of when melchizedek came to abraham in genesis 14 and he offered unto abraham both the wine and the bread serving him communion after a great battle and gave unto him communion typing the communion of the church and the marriage supper but there's a bit of a spiritual thought laying there even that melchizedek didn't have a lamb right there melchizedek didn't have a lamb in other words he wasn't a priest in that nature right then he was a priest of the host most high god but he wasn't a priest with a lamb he was a priest in restoration and in communion amen but in the middle of the bible melchizedek comes and gets his lamb and says this is the lamb of god and jesus christ the son of god the lamb of god amen was claimed to be god's only begotten son and the very lamb of our redemption and the blood of our atonement now i want to maybe say something to you in saying this that it's a very secret food to understand that jesus christ was melchizedek in the flesh he wasn't just a jew or a gentile it was god amen who manifested himself in the flesh and claimed the flesh of jesus christ as brother branham will say it in in future home he will say that he redeemed that part of the earth so he could from that redeem the rest of the earth in other words god claimed 16 elements to make it a redemptive work for the bride of christ now now you're all you're all well studied enough to know amen the scripture tells us very clearly amen that that secret food of melchizedek that was going to be coming to the church going to be revealed in the church then the voice of christ would be speaking to her revealing to her her ordination where she come from where she's going what she's doing the secrets of your eternal life would be coming into the church now that secret food becomes as a communion and it begins to move into the flesh as you eat it as you let the secrets of god be revealed in your heart your flesh begins to take on its form as you receive the word you become the word as you take in the word can i say it like this it starts claiming you it maybe started claiming a little part of your life and then it claimed another little part but it starts claiming that until the spirit of god will cap that off and call you a child of god now think of this because that claim amen is the very thing that was done to the body of jesus christ when he was laying in the tomb and he was dead have you ever asked yourself how god proved that was his body brother brahm said the cross didn't do it many good men had died his justice birth didn't do it he said but when he resurrected from the dead it was proof of whose body that was amen you see then god's spirit claimed the body of jesus to resurrect it and prove whose body it was now he's not here claiming the body of jesus christ in the physical he's here claiming the bride body of jesus christ and the very spirit that raised up jesus from the dead has come back upon the church to say that you are not the body of denomination you are not the body of the world you are the body of jesus christ oh my then the voice of god begins to sound upon that church and begins to claim it amen revelation 5 the book is open revelations 10 uh closed revelations 10 it's open and when he opens it he starts calling he starts calling for his bride to come out of tradition to come out of hybridization if you're a bible study you know revelation chapter 14 speaks of three angels and the third angel comes flying saying to the church you cannot worship god in the image of the beast at the same time amen now how many how many knows that that was the message of william branham you say third angel sure start with martin luther john wesley william branham that third angel and what did he do he called the bride out of denomination watch this that's the same angel in revelations 18 where the bible says that an angel comes down from heaven and lights the earth with his glory and a voice in the fourth verse sounds out and says come out of her my people and be not partakers of her see that voice is calling the bride out of denomination and claiming that bride for the work of the spirit in the last day let me ask you something why hadn't the spirit been working the whole time it was poured out two thousand years ago but it's been barred out it's been pushed out it's been created out doctrines have pushed christ on the outside of the church where the prophet of god has called the pride to come out of the church and come back into the manifestation of the spirit of god to loose them from every thing the enemy had pulled them into now in revelations 18 this is an angel of light calling the church calling them to come out now you might think it's odd that i would call this the seventh angel because the bible says to us that it sounded from heaven a voice sounded from heaven but brother adam said it's simple he said the angel on earth he said when he sounded his message it was so recognized in heaven until they echoed it back from heaven what he was saying on the earth this message is recognized in heaven and on earth as the voice of god this voice is a voice of illumination and enlightenment god didn't come to leave you in darkness he come to enlighten you to come to illuminate you now now i i want you to stay with me a moment that voice is coming into your heart to reveal to you the voice is coming into your heart to illuminate you to make you full of light now notice because in ephesians 1 this is paul's own prayer he says i pray that the spirit of wisdom and revelation and the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know the hope of the calling the riches of the glory and the inheritance in saints and to what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us who believed according to the work of his mighty power which he wrought in christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his right hand in heavenly places far above principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is thing not only in the world but also which is to come and he had put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church now watch paul tie together the spirit of wisdom and revelation with the resurrection power this was not a man who believed in intellectuals that would just tell you something about the scripture but he connected it with the resurrection power look what he does if you if you read ephesians 1 you're basically reading revelations 3 when the scripture says that you should share the throne of christ and hear paul is saying when your eyes are opened you will see that you're connected to christ who sets above everything who everything is is beneath him and under his feet and he's saying over in revelations 3 when christ comes into your heart and he illuminates your life then you're going to see that you're not just another person you're going to see that you're not just subject to the devil you're going to start seeing that you were a son or daughter of god to begin with and that satan has tried his best to put some kind of a claim upon your life but he has no rights you know i was just thinking here the other day i was thinking about how that the devil tried to actually give he tried to actually give the earth to jesus and instead of him dying for it and you know how brother ram teaches us that that jesus wouldn't accept that he wouldn't let that happen and and and he actually died and gave his blood so that he wouldn't have to accept it as a gift from the devil because he didn't want your sin returning at the time he was planning to claim his own throne can you imagine jesus showing up to claim the bride body and satan run around saying amen you can't you can't give him that anointing you can't place your spirit in his life because of this back here and because of this over here and this over here jesus knew who he was picking to begin with amen jesus knew how rotten of a rascal you was going to be to begin with jesus don't know the you the world knows he knows the real you amen he knows everything about you he knows everything you thought and where you come from he did not die to redeem them that are perfect he redeemed them that were lost to make them perfect by the blood of jesus christ now i say that to you this morning that i can also say that by the power of the blood then satan does not have one legal right with you this morning he's only doing it because our unbelief permits him to do it now satan actually has no claim on you at all now i know i'm making some testimonies this morning about you as the bride of christ and they're completely not true without the blood everything that i'm saying about you is not true without the blood but even in the old testament when moses put the word in the in the third realm and he placed the word in the holies of holies he put the blood on that word he put the blood on that ark of the covenant because it was the testimony of god and now the church god is saying things about you that are not even true without the blood but because of the blood i can stand here this morning and say everything the devil says about you is a lie and everything god says is the truth amen it's a different point of view it's a different way of looking at the people i'm not looking at you through my ability i'm looking at you through the blood i got to preach it on the cross one time i got to thinking about the blood and i i sometimes i used to run not much anymore but i used to run get sweat in my eyes and you couldn't hardly see nothing that salt running in your eyes and i got to thinking about that i got to think about jesus being on the cross and when he was dying that that blood started dripping into those eyes and i got to thinking when he was looking at the at the crowd he was not looking at them with clear eyes he was looking at them through the blood and the sins of the people through the blood of jesus christ he said turned out to be pure as lily or pure as white as snow though thy sins be as crimson they shall be white as snow the book of isaiah do you see then it's according how you're looking at things now christ is saying that satan has no legal rights do you know do you know that you're actually one of the three thrones of almighty god first thrown in heaven second throne in christ the third throne is actually in the bride he becomes the lord he becomes the god the king of our lives now i i understand that satan would like to return to you and say to you oh my that you know this is here and that's there and this is this is this is a part of your life and and but you know i'm kind of one of those guys that i guess maybe i probably should be quiet sometimes when i don't but i just like kind of speak back sometimes and you know what i mean if you hear somebody say something really good and you're not that sharp you know and you're around somebody later and they say something you you'll borrow a little what somebody else said you know and whenever i start arguing with the devil i just start borrowing things i heard brother braham saying real real good things brother graham said i just borrow and begin to say them back and you know sometimes you've heard this when the devil tells you about your past tell him about his future well it takes a new light when you start hearing what brother bram said about the devil's future some time ago i know brother timothy probably told you but i was actually studying and come across the quote and i was looking into the annihilation of our accuser and the and what the power of the blood actually does in the future of our lives and how far does it really go in annihilation and i got to look at this and it was odd because brother brown begins to preach and he pulls up a scripture and he says the soul that sinners shall die and immediately he takes it over to the devil and he actually says of our enemy the devil he says that uh he actually says amen that this devil has a future and i want to read this about in the fourth seal here i want to read this from the fourth seal first and brother man will say this he'll say now uh they were gods and if you become born in the family name you're a son of god or a part of your father then when sin come in we found that the man crossed the chasm and the blood of bulls and goats covered but did not remit but until the bleeds came and took that stain of sin and broke it completely to pieces and send it back upon the original perverted that was satan when it got back to satan he waits his time of eternal annihilation now that shows what we believe we believe will that shows what we believe we believe that he will absolutely be done completely away he will be annihilated amen and i read that and then listen to what brother branham says he says see i believe sin will be so broke up that when it's confessed upon the basis of the blood of christ it's like drawing a drop of black ink into a bunch of clorox it breaks its chemicals and sends it back to where it come from and that's the way the blood of jesus christ does it sets a man across the chasm and then he says see then he becomes and the creative power of god that's in him whenever he whenever god can command it to be done it'll be done and we get back now he's trying to tell us that under the power of the blood that the sin is completely done away with but he's going to transfer that sin back to the one that was the originator of the sin god has the power to put the sin back on the one that caused it i think it's amazing that being calvary brother brahm says i believe that there is a complete annihilation of that soul that sins for the bible said the soul that sinneth it shall surely die not the man the soul sin and soul satan must surely die to be completely destroyed how i disagree with the universe that say satan will be saved he sinned he is the originator of sin and his soul sinned and he was a spirit that spirit will be totally annihilated until nothing will be left of it now i want you to think about this a minute there is a time when satan there will be nothing left of it at all now think about this because everything that he's saying to you he's trying to bring it is as an original truth but nothing satan has ever said about you is an original truth he come after amen and started perverting the things that god did originally but someday god will totally take away every bit of the hybrid of satan and restore the world and the people back unto the original word let me tell you that devil is annihilated i told brother timothy i said i i read this in my study i was studying it and what i did there was a spirit run right across the room and i just started laughing i said that's right devil you can run but you can't hide amen you can you can come against this bride and you can talk about her and you can ridicule her and you can honor and you can try your best amen but it's never going to change the fact the devil's a liar it's not going to change the fact amen that he's always lying and that god is going to completely annihilate him one day until nothing is left of him at all i want you to know this morning there is a day that devils die amen amen the prophet of god said satan is is powerless for a thousand year millennial is that right he said because he don't have anything to work through he said but at the end of that millennium he'll be raised up he said and there'll be one last campaign i said oh my i'd like to be in that camp meeting you talk about a camp meeting of all camp meetings amen the devil's going to resurrect everything he has and come against the church of the living god only to die do you see god is annihilating that devil once and for all but he's already annihilating him in your life [Applause] oh i thank god this morning that the spirit of god is taking possession of a church annihilating every sin calling this bride the anointed bride of jesus christ and the prophet of god will say this there's got to come a time forth when he would express himself in the fullness of the godhead deity through the church had the preeminence in his church the anointed man now the anointed people oh my to bring back the anointed bride and bridegroom anointed by accepting what eve turned down my the anointing of god coming upon the church in the messiah brother man will say when he comes upon the church in the last days what will it be a pulled out group a group of people anointed with the spirit of god they will be messiahs they'll be anointed ones he anointed once and if the spirit is in them they'll do the things that he did isn't that right now i think it's important you catch something here she's already anointed this bride's not going to be she's already anointed she is actually already anointed his pride is the anointed one for the last days and it's already raised with him and resurrection these two are one my when i think about it this morning we look at you and i know that you can see all the problems of one another and and i appreciate that that there's good vision but let me say this to you you don't want to start a carnal view of your church or your pastor or your life or anything else because carnality will destroy you it's an enemy done to god amen and i i will say this though amen that if you if you can if you can get the right kind of view of things it changes everything uh let me let me just put it to you like this uh there there's mirrors and of course brother madam tells us that a prophet is a mirror the word of god is a mirror uh it matters how you look into the mirror according to what you walk away with now in your in your human i thought it was pretty funny i was thinking about this quote specifically and i was thinking about you know sometimes i never hardly wake up in the morning walk up to the mirror and say well there's a messiah standing there you know you don't usually just run over and say hey sister karen come look right here in the mirror there's a messiah standing here which one of y'all done that this morning see because that mirror doesn't reflect anything but you're human and in the body you're looking at look at all the things that's reflected back at you those days in the world those days and those lives it's all reflected back in that mirror because it's being held in that flesh but think about this what if there was a different kind of mirror what if there was a different view that you could look in and not see the human but you could see the reality of what god made you and i thought about this i thought about amen isn't it something that you can see something in the word of god and you can see where a prophet can say that they can do all things that there's nothing impossible she is the anointed pride and you know what you'll do you'll actually go and preach it or you'll call somebody to come and read it and you'll say look right here and see what he said about me because you're looking at different view at the same person but a different kind of mirror and i'll tell you this morning the prophet of god said you give me a church that's so anointed with god until their every action and every move is thus saith the lord in the shekinah glory i will show you a messiah you show me a church i'll show you a messiah look at the way the prophet could change you're seeing a church he's seen a messiah he wasn't seeing just the human he was seeing what god made the church i'll tell you this morning that there is a there is a life that is behind the veil that a prophet could view and it would speak of it from the word now now this morning you all know the stories of balak and balaam and i don't have time to get into all that but i do know this i do know that balak tried to hire balaam to keep the church of god out of the promises and he actually tried to hire him to curse the children of god well he should have he should have read the covenant to abraham because whoever curses is cursed and whoever blesses is blessed but see you can start looking at a blessed person from a certain angle and believe you can curse them and balak believed that he could get balaam looking at a certain view of that bunch of holy rollers down there that he could actually begin to curse them but balak amen didn't realize that god would never curse israel because he was looking at them from a different view now remember when balaam went in and made offers and sacrifices he come back and he said amen that god wouldn't allow him to curse those people he wouldn't allow him to curse them because he's already blessed them so it doesn't matter how you view it matters how god views now when god began to view brother brahm said this he says that balaam and balak couldn't see the water from the rock see they couldn't see the smitten rock they could see the problem but they couldn't see the atonement god smote that rock because of the of the people and and the condition they were in god saw the condition but he smoked the rock so that god could give them something in their condition god saw the condition but he gave an answer to it you see what he done he meant the condition they were speaking against the prophet and god saw the condition but he gave a brazen serpent to take away what was caused by their own condition now balaam wasn't able to see that bailey wasn't able to see it but iran said he wasn't able to see the pillar of fire and to think this morning where is that pillar of fire brother graham said it was right behind the skins of the bride of christ where is that pillar of fire this morning it's actually behind the skin of the bride of jesus christ now this morning i realized that this message claims this message it influences this message identifies the message of the hour does all of these things under the bride of christ and it claims a part of your life for something i i want to share a little testimony happened to me back up in july i was up at brother uh i was up but brother matt morris's speaking there during that fourth of july time and we went over to a little picnic and uh and there was a lady there who was an apostolic lady and she just started coming to church for the match there and i started talking to her and and when i started talking i thought she would just have stalin you didn't know about the message or anything well i asked her i said well where are you from she said well i'm from carlsbad new mexico well she was about 75 years old or so and her husband sitting there i said originally carlsbad new mexico well i said to brother matt sitting there i said well hey that's well brother branham actually preached a message turned on the light from carlsbad and held meetings in carlsbad and when the lady heard me say brother branham she said you talking about william branham and i said yeah brother branham she said well she said i was actually in his meetings when i was about five years old and i said really you were in brother brown's meeting she said yes she said i said well you was awful young do you actually remember that she said oh yeah i remember that i remember it very well and i said you remember that from the time you she said yeah i remember it she said but there was one specific thing i remember and she said what i remember about it was she said that that there was a girl and i think she said she was close to 18 years old i got the the testimony recorded but i think she's about 18 years old she'd never spoke in her life she couldn't speak she couldn't hear and they brought her to the meeting and said well brother branham brought her up before the crowd and she said now she's from her hometown so they were family friends she knew the family was friends with her older siblings and she said that she brother brown brought her up the prayer line and said stood her out in front of the people and and put her in front of him and while she was in front of him he began to pray over her and and and commanded that deaf spirit to leave her well when the deaf spirit began to leave her she said brother brown done the oddest thing said he took the mic and put the little girl in front of him where she couldn't see him and said he reached the mic around and put in front of the little girl he said then he whispered in her ear and he said i could i could hear it sound pretty close she said he said say mama and she said i never will forget that when that little girl how she said the word she said mama just real just mama she said first word she'd ever said in her life she said i will never forget that brother and i thought well isn't that so odd and and so we went back home started studying it well when we did brother branham actually does that a lot on tape he does it chicago different places and in it brother branham says he said i didn't find that specific place but i found other places and he says that what it is he says that the hearing and the speaking nerves are actually tied together and he said that if a person can't hear they generally can't speak he said now what it is is there's a nerve now you all you all heard brother graham explain he said if an ear problem he said if it was a bone or something he said a surgery could fix it he said but because there's actually nothing wrong with the bone there's nothing in there wrong he said there's a nerve he said which a devil will clamp off that nerve of hearing he said it's just like you put an invisible band around your hand he said the vessels is there the blood is all there he said but when you start tightening it up the hand will start turning colors and and it'll start dying he said there's nothing wrong with the hand there's nothing wrong with the blood it's just there is something cutting off the life source he said now that invisible band he's describing is the spirit he said and the spirit was cutting off the hearing unto that little girl but when he rebuked the spirit the child could hear and if the child could hear the child could speak now what did it speak it spoke the only thing it heard it said the word mama but because it had only heard the word mama it said the word mama later brother random actually said because i don't have a hearing test he said then to prove to the people that the spirit has left the child he said i will make them say something to prove the hearing has returned well of course as a preacher when i heard that i said now i know what's wrong with so many thoughts i know why i hear the things that people say well there's no move and there's no power left in the bride and there's no no manifestations and there's no if you i don't know if you ever heard anything like that but you hear that a lot these days and i i always wondered what was wrong but now i understand that people can only say what they hear amen and spirits will get involved in the hearing and begin to constrict and and to bow down in other words people will listen the same tape you're listening to but they won't hear that tape they won't hear the things the prophet of god said he said but if we would open up our heart amen and let the spirit come into us amen that we would be able to say the things that a prophet of god would have to say when i say that today i realize this i realize that people speak the way they speak because of the things they hear and i pray today let us have an ear to hear what the spirit of god is saying to the church don't let my confession be different than the confession of a prophet of god people say brother wayne how can you say that the bride of christ is omnipotent because william branham's head the bride of christ amen if she will surrender to god she's omnipotent how can you say that there's no claim against the blood at all because brother branham said there's no claim against the blood at all how can you say and look at the church and look at all the problems and say to the church that god don't have one sin against you at all how can you say that because i heard the prophet of god say that how can you stand there and begin to tell the church that all things are possible to them that believe because i heard the prophet of god say that if you can hear it you can say it if you can hear the word speak to you you've got a right to say whatever that word said now i got i got to say this to you today because i realized this i realize that you you can hear this message and then you can get under an influence and they can begin to tear away from that in the things you hear and they can begin to try to control the way you hear amen but i say this because in this very testimony that little girl who heard and spoke for the first time in 18 years went home and started telling her parents about this miracle can you imagine a child speaking for the first time and her parents being unbelievers said you're making it up there ain't no such a thing you you you could speak the whole time you were just faking can you imagine that can you imagine that kind of miracle happening in a life and people saying that it's not real it's nothing happening there's nothing to it can you imagine and you know what happened that little girl began to listen to her own family and that woman 75 year old told me something i don't understand by the way weeks later she said that little girl lost her ability to speak and hear amen she said do you have any idea what happened i said i do the prophet of god moved that spirit off of her but she should have held her confession she should have confessed and when that devil come back she should have said devil you're a liar amen you you have nothing to do with me listen god can come in a meeting and he can deliver you and give you authority he can fill you with anointing he can charge that demon to get back off of you but if you leave this building and go out here and say nothing happened today that was just in motion there was nothing coming from god do you do you know that spiritual circle right back and it'll begin to haunt you and if you'll lay there and fellowship with it it'll stay with you for weeks until it takes possession again but let me tell you something this morning you have a right this morning to tell that devil i'm not going back there amen god did a work in my life listen to me this morning don't give up your confession don't you do it you said preacher what are you saying i'm saying that joshua went into the land and the book of joshua is nothing more than a book of confession of what moses said they could have and when joshua went in that land every giant rose up and said you can't have that land and you can't have that land and you can't have that and had they listened to those giants they would have had to go back across the river and join the wilderness journey but let me tell you this morning there was a joshua there and he knew where he was he knew what belonged to him he was already anointed with god and when the battle got hot amen he knew exactly what he was able to do let me tell you this morning the church of the living god you've got a right to stand against every devil that says it don't belong to you every redemptive right that god has given you you have a right to this morning i don't believe we ought to let anybody rob us of anything now can i say this paul said this from hebrews chapter 3 and he said let us let us partake of the heavenly call and consider the high priest of our profession in christ jesus let us consider the high priest of our profession hebrews 4 paul says this he says jesus passing into the heaven jesus the son of god let us hold fast our profession let us hold fast our profession who wrote that paul wrote that can you imagine paul while you're floating on us on a driftwood in the middle of a shipwreck amen because of your testimony got you out there floating on a stick in the middle of an ocean and looking like you're forsaken and looking like you're not going nowhere but you're going down and you're going to die one of them probably one of them one of them jailbirds looks over it paul said what do you think about it now but paul said don't change your confession it don't matter what condition you're in don't you change your confession it don't matter what the devil is told at you don't you change your confession hold fast to your profession of faith the snake reached out and beat him what paul do he didn't change he didn't say oh no i'm going to fall apart now he shook the snake back in the fire listen this morning you don't have to just take what the devil shows you or what the devil throws at you amen come on paul let's go to the chopping block let's put your head on the top of what do you think about jesus now what do you think about this message now you know what paul did paul turned around and looked right in the face of his enemy and said oh death where is thy sting and grave where is thy victory you know why he could do that because paul knew exactly where he was standing in the word of god and this morning i think it's time for the bride of christ to challenge the devil that is challenging her [Applause] sitting there this morning things challenging your life you don't have to sit there and accept that you don't have to sit there and say well i this because this has come up then what they said must not be true and i must not be who i thought i was and this you don't have to accept that you've got a confession from the word of god you've got something that god has given you i know we're we're in the middle of covet i realize that people teach everything and people are sick and devils are saying everything about the people but let me tell you this the confession of our faith don't change one ounce under any condition whatsoever is thrown at us now can i can i say this to you if you can hear it you can say it if you can hear it you can say it if you can catch it you can say it that's why paul said in romans 10 the word of faith which we preach is nothing even in thy mouth do you recognize why you're hearing the word this morning if you catch a word it becomes a word of faith amen just a little word minister to you in the middle of a meeting it becomes a word of faith how many people has left church with a word of faith you come in the house of god and maybe something's trying to take over your life and all of a sudden you reach out and catch something and it becomes a word of faith well you've got to remember that word of faith is given to you for a reason because that's going to be your weapon that's going to be what you're going to get out of the trouble with that's what you're hey man god didn't say you wasn't going to get into something he said i'm going to give you something to overcome it i'm going to give you something to get out of it amen it's a word of faith which we preach now if that word of faith is preached and you catch it in a believer and i'll not be too much longer but you catch that word of faith in there now listen what happens to believers what happens to people is they get into shells they actually get into shells anybody ever been there in the middle of this all this junk's going on this cold weather thing people staying by their cells and they're getting along and they're they're they're not fellowship and and things are things are rough on some people some of the young people i understand there's things that are way different and everything 2020 calls things to be different but godding different and people start getting into this shell and and the next thing you know they begin to believe there's no way out of it they begin to believe that what their what they're imagining what they're hearing from the enemy what they're accepting what they're thinking they begin to think that is the reality amen but it's nothing but a shell that is trying to block the power of the resurrection away from your life and if you get yourself in that kind of place do you not realize you can get out of that you don't have to just lay down and say that's the way it is you've got to write this morning as the bride of jesus christ to say to this this this thing that's in front of you amen that this will not stand in the face of the word of god i'll tell you this amen that if you just begin to you can break any wall you can tear down any opposition you can destroy any enemy with the word of god that is actually in your mouth if you can hear it you can speak it if you can get it in you now i i think sometimes that sometimes we we get weary we get tired and we said brother wayne i've already tried that i've i've spoke the word of god and i've professed the word of god you again get a little weary with it but let me tell you something the bible talks about daniel in the bible and he prayed to the lord do you know he was exactly 21 days before he ever even got an answer he was 21 days before the lord answered his prayer but think about this amen i always wondered why brother brown used a chicken egg but do you know that when a chicken is coming out of an egg that there's a 21 day hatch period that that chicken has to begin to beat on that egg and you know what he's got to make up his mind that he's going to come out of that amen let me say something to you this morning amen you've got to make up your mind you're going to come out of it you've got to make up your mind that i have what it takes and i'm coming out of this you've got to let the spirit speak in your heart that i am a child of god i do not belong in this situation this spirit is not supposed to be my home i will not i will not allow myself to be blocked off from the power of god amen and watch when that word begins to generate in that heart you can begin to speak the word of god which is a thus saith the lord and the prophet of god said is like a little eagle or a chicken pecking on like he's pecking on the shell now now if you go and read a little bit you'll find out something that when when a chicken is pecking inside a shell do you know that you can't help him do you know you can't actually break the shell for him you know you can't actually help that little chicken he has to come out of it on his own he's got to make up his mind that life is worth it i've got to live there's life outside the shell let me tell you this morning there is life outside of discouragement there is life outside of nervousness there is life outside of drugs and addictions and alcohol there is life and life abundant let me say to you this morning there is power in the word of god that is spoken by the lips of a believer and when you begin to speak amen look at this i can't put nothing in you that ain't already in you [Music] when a prophet of god talks about him coming out of that shell what he needs is already in him amen how he gets out of there you all know how he gets out he gets out through his mouth right he actually pecks his way out of that shell he actually peeps his way and the prophet of god taught that to a believer taking the word and peeping his way out of the situation and speaking against it until it has to move and let me say this if you'll take that word and you'll just keep pressing and you'll just keep speaking that word after a while a little crack will come in it and a little daylight will start and then a little bigger hole will come and if you will just keep it up after a little while there'll be a room enough that you can take a step outside of whatever that is only amen that's trying to circle you in what am i talking about i'm talking about coming out of it i'm talking about breaking out of it i'm talking about a breakout this morning a breakout break out of the thing whatever it is just break out of it say i'm not going to stay here no more i'm not going to be bound here no more i'm coming out and i'm doing it today he said oh preacher hey man you ain't talking about nothing but a bunch of words well let me tell you this the prophet of god said if you get the word the world bred out of you that you'll say what you want and it'll happen if you'll get the word the world bread out get the world out of you get back to a pure a pure religion get back to get away from that hybrid and get the pure word of god amen you'll break out of anything with it amen let me say this did samson do it bit samson he was already anointed to kill philistines he was already anointed so when he come to that jawbone of that mule and he picked that mule bone up he was already anointed to do it so he started beating down philistines he beat down a thousand philistines with that jawbone amen it wasn't the jawbone of a hybrid it was a jawbone of a purebred animal because it represented amen and anointed people in the last days that with their mouth they shall overcome every devil that stands before them i'll tell you this if samson could kill a thousand philistines with his jawbone what about the church of the living god the pure mouth of the bride of jesus christ speaking the word of god over every situation over every devil over every trial tear down every wall i know i know it sounds crazy but let me tell you this to every goliath there's a rock amen to every wall there's a joshua through every situation there's a way out and there's a way to break out of that this morning there's a way and you've got to speak it out there you've got to place the word of god on your lips and say satan get out of me get out of the front of me i curse you in the name of jesus christ brother wayne you're going crazy no i'm not time for the bride of christ to actually recognize the power of the word recognize the power of the word that's enter you can speak now when you say that there's a whole group now saying that there's no more prayer lines and there's no more the move of god and because if you preach about the spoken word then all of a sudden they think that means there's no spiritual manifestation of like a prayer line i asked brother tim this morning i said what does people think that we're doing in those prayer lines waving feathers over somebody now there's a lot of you come through prayer lines a lot of our group there and true word tabernacle comes through prayer lines ain't nobody waving feathers over nobody amen the word of god is spoken over the lives the word of god is spoken over hearts you know you know just just this last sunday brother timothy came up to the church and i'll tell you what what a powerful preacher man golly the spirit of god moved what a what an anointing i probably wouldn't proper english to say that like that but forgive me the hillbilly's coming out the spirit of god used him ideally mightily we heard him we heard him give a testimony of when i was here a long time ago and well just how did i see you yeah right there wait a minute yeah transformed he gave testimony about the night you came in well you know what's amazing is we have a justin in our church and he's been out i can't say that he's not been in church like he should be in the last while and you know what when brother timothy gave that i don't even know if he knew that we had a justin that was needing to get some things right or get a touch from the lord but when he gave that testimony it wasn't long and justin's mama come up there and she couldn't even talk to us she just held up two fingers like this well i knew what the two fingers were it was a son and daughter-in-law and and when she did that there was something coming to my heart powerful because you know what i did two nights prior to that the lord gave me a dream about the her daughter-in-law and showed me she was at the church and she was singing a song and in the song she was saying i'm no longer a slave to fear i am a child of god and she was singing that song when that mother-in-law come up there i said sis i said let me tell you a dream i just had and in the dream the girl was singing the song and while she was singing the song i fell in the intercessory prayer it's right in the church just fell out in the dream fell an intercessory prayer and the spirit of god just kept moving through me i told her this dream brother timothy's standing right here and i'm talking this girl the brother was leading the songs about as far as from here back there to the exit door he's on the other side of the sanctuary and when i told the dream the brother changed the song from what he was saying and started playing the song i'm no longer a slave to fear i am a child of god when they begin to sing the song the spirit of intercessory just fell right in and literally i couldn't even stand on my feet for the power of prayer that come into me you know what it was because god's fixing to do something with some lives he's fixing to do something with some lives and that that isn't just a prayer line but there's some words being spoken and those are words of faith and i'm speaking them words right now i'm putting them out in the air for a purpose because my confession of faith says they're going to come home amen that everything that has happened will disappear that the spirit will be annihilated amen and i'm saying that this morning that things that's going on in life seem like it seems like it's completely beyond the possibility in the realm but i'm telling you this morning you are more than a human being you're a child of the living god and everything that's before you you can actually take the word of god and command it to get out of your way listen you don't have to cry this morning you speak the word of god as the david destroy your child as a joshua tear down your wall you've got a rife this morning you've got a right to make a claim on your family you've got a right to make a claim on your healing you've got a right to make a claim on your freedom if you're sitting here this morning and you're fighting a spirit and it keeps saying to you you're never going to come out of it you ought to stand to your feet right now and you are to say i'm coming out of this there's a spirit that's saying to you you're not going to be able to come and be delivered you ought to stand up and say i'm going to be delivered right here today i'm not going to allow the spirit i'm not going to allow it it's a spirit of unbelief and it's trying to hinder your life and i'm telling you in the name of the lord it is the time for you to say to that devil i do not believe you satan i do not believe that you control my life i do not believe that i was put here for your spirit i'm a child of god i was putting here for this message i was put here to serve the lord yes sir there's a breakthrough right there that's somebody breaking through something amen what about you have you been wanting that victory over that thing had you been wanting that spirit of depression just to leave you amen won't you just begin to talk to it right now and say satan you got no rights with me you've got no rights in my life won't you tell that lust devil right now amen you've took all the nights you're going to take from me you've took all the hours you've hurt my family all you're going to do in the name of jesus christ i curse that devil by the power of the holy ghost hallelujah somebody reach out in the realm of faith right now and say satan you're alive reach out in that realm of faith he's saying to you you're never going to get your miracle he's saying it right now you're not it's not for you you're never going to get the miracle and you know what you ought to do take that word of faith and say the miracle is already on its way it's a preacher come and do it for me i can't do it for you and the mama chicken can't do it for the baby chicken but you know what that she can do she can create an atmosphere that'll keep that baby alive until it can get itself out of that situation and i believe today that there's some model eagles in this place are some daddy eagles and we ought to keep the anointing of god alive until every child of god is able to bring themselves out [Applause] hallelujah it's your turn can i musicians come this morning amen it's your turn it's your turn brother wayne i can't do it it's it's not for me you might not be a david can i call you an esther we got any answers in here we got answers in here we do have an astrid here don't we amen it's for such a time as this you have come into the kingdom and i know every devil is against you but let me be a mordecai to you amen let me tell you this that if you'll just go in the presence of god and take the throne of grace boldly there's a power that you can ask half of what the kingdom of god is [Applause] praise god somebody said well brother wayne it's just too late we got any martha's in here have we got any martians hey man how about you are you a martha is there somebody someone's turning around looks at where's martha at she thinks it's too late let me tell you jesus is coming by it's never too late i don't care how bad it is i don't care the situation it's never too late it's never too late oh you must think i'm crazy i'm not crazy i know where i'm standing we're the children of god we possess the power of god every demon has been defeated every devil has been overcome you are the freeborn church of the living god [Music] it's a turning point for your life i read over it this morning said i'm not going to get into this but brother taylor's eternal there is something happening in this building this morning i believe that god is turning something around i believe that i'm not trying to be pentecostal i'm trying to tell you there's something pulsating in my heart to believe that god is turning around the situation maybe it's right there in our home church maybe it's somewhere on the line out there but i believe this i believe that there's a turning point through every situation i really believe from my heart i know how it's been but it won't be that way no more it won't be that way no more it's a turning point right here today god bless you here she comes she's ready to turn it it's a turning point are you ready how about up there are you ready for a turning point have you given enough already to it have you have you staged have you stayed silent long enough have you laid have you laid silent while the devil has carried away your confession while he's carried away your your joy and your peace and you just lay there quiet and let him take it all but listen this morning it's time to remember you're the children of god and we won't lay we won't lay silent anymore we are the final voice to a final age and it's time for her to speak up and say satan you can't have our children satan you can have our families you can have our churches you can have our services we're going to tear down every gate we're going to tear down every wall until the power of god drops into every movie [Applause] [Music] hallelujah and they're raising the church higher in the power of the holy ghost sitting there this morning with individual things amen i believe in the power of the spoken word i believe we speak over them i believe in the power of prayer i believe in the power of anointing but i don't believe in just sitting there not doing nothing about i don't believe in sitting still and letting the devil rob you of your joy and of your life and your fellowship and of your communion and the grace of god i don't believe in just laying there and doing nothing i believe you ought to get up amen and get about the
