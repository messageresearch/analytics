Banner could you find than to March under the banner of the Gospel of Jesus Christ under the shed Blood The Living Word of this hour we're so grateful for this opportunity to be here we're thankful for that Banner for what Christ did for us at Calvary we're thankful for this message we have so much to be thankful for amen before we get into the word tonight let's go before the author of it ask His blessings Heavenly Father Lord you see this assembly tonight Lord you see each one that's gathered Lord you see the youth and their excitement for the upcoming weekend Lord I believe all of our hearts are excited father Lord we're excited seeing what you're doing in this day what you're doing it amongst the youth what you're doing amongst the adults Lord just changing lives and showing yourself to be living Lord we are grateful and we are thankful Lord that we have been called and chosen for this last day Lord many people would look and talk about how evil it is and things of that nature and yet Lord what we've been taught is it's the greatest day that we could ever live we have been chosen Lord to be the final ones on the face of the Earth Lord before eternity sets in before the great going home and Lord we're looking to that tonight that is our goal that is our Focus that is what we are living for and Lord if there be one here tonight that isn't living for that that hasn't turned their focus to that tonight Lord Lord I pray tonight would be the night that you would just get a hold of that life father Lord we want to surrender ourselves to you we want to just turn this service over to you Lord ask you to come and anoint and Lord get my nerves out of the way and allow me to speak Lord what it is that you gave me to speak Lord Lord I just pray that nothing would hinder from this point forward Lord as we just turn this service into into your hands now Lord in Jesus name we pray amen amen wonderful to be in the house of God wonderful to be feeling well amen if you if you have your Bibles with me with you tonight if you turn with me over to the book of Jude again the first chapter and as you're turning there just in preparation for this service with my mind heavily leaning towards the youth and and their trip uh coming up this week and recognizing the importance and the opportunity of these kind of meetings and the things that uh that that they're about to be in and I would ask that each one of you be in fervent prayer for the meetings and for our youth and for our children but not only for them but the Youth of this message as they would gather together and there are many that are going to actually have the opportunity to come face to face with the Lord Jesus many are going to have the opportunity at life many are going to have the opportunity at Deliverance men are going to have the opportunity at healings and at the baptism of the Holy Ghost and look we don't load up and go on these trips just for a good time all right although we're going to have a good time you know I believe that um but but I'm not getting on a bus with 52 I mean I just quit teaching to get away from these situations I'm not getting on a bus with 50 young people to travel 14 hours for a good time I'm going because I believe that there's going to be things of Eternal value take place there's going to be lives touched there's going to be people delivered and we're just asking that you'll be in prayer for that and and and not only that not only do we want them to have those kind of services there and the young people but we want them for everybody and we want them here and we want them when we come together not to waste an opportunity but we should Endeavor every time we come together to create that atmosphere where lives can be changed and young people I would even ask you I know in a few hours or an hour I know you're thinking a few hours whoa slow down um here in a minute you're wanting to load up on the bus and uh and head to Ohio but just for a few moments let's gather in right here you know don't put off until Thursday night or Friday Friday night an opportunity that you can have right here tonight to be delivered and be set free so as we look to the word tonight the book of Jude third uh third chapter third verse excuse me it says beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints and also we want to look in Psalm 60 and verse 4 and as you're turning there I believe what we just read about contending to the faith is is pertinent for everyone here but as time would go on it's going to be even more and more pertinent for you young people because as time goes on you're going to see further and further adrift further and further standards being let down and landmarks being overrun and you're gonna have to contend harder and harder every single day Psalm 60 and verse 4 it says thou has given a banner to them that fear thee that it may be displayed because of the truth Selah amen you may have your seats tonight we just ask that the Lord without his blessings to the word brother Brandon would say God grant it tonight everything has went by May that still Small Voice attract the people tonight to a real Sanctified life a life that'll stand by their God that will stand by their church that will stand by their Pastor that'll stand by the cause of Christ that'll hold up a banner that'll live act dress go and Associate and live in the environment that'll be so salty that it will cause others to thirst to be like them I believe that's the desire for each and every one of us but as I said tonight as I prepared and looked and thought my heart was with the youth but don't just let them let this be to them tonight take it take it for yourself as we're going to minister for a bit on proclaiming the standard or raising the standard we're gonna we're gonna preach tonight on raising the standard and the last time we ministered we were talking about defending the landmarks uh defending the faith as it was once delivered unto the Saints and and to tonight I want to kind of head down that same road that same line of Defending truth of of standing on the Liberty that we have in Christ Jesus and and and defending the land that we as a people that you as a young people has been returned back to in this day and not only to to defend what you currently have and not be satisfied with defending this little portion but being willing to take further steps and to obtain all that God has promised to give you all right because within the landmarks and within the boundaries you are to take everything that God has promised and that God has said that you can have so as we get ready to go to meetings as we sit down for a church service don't just let it be a time where you come together just to worship or just to hear something good but in this moment in this service in this weekend of meetings I'm gonna take more I'm gonna grow a little bit I'm going to take more of the Holy Ghost I'm going to take another step I'm going to overcome that which has been hindering me every time we come together it's not just for a good time what we have to start to recognize is Every Time We Gather it is for war it is for battle it is to drive off the enemy it is to take more of our possessions and he's not just going to give it to you you got to be willing to show up wake up get into the battle draw your sword and fight you understand come on I want you to get with me tonight you can relax and hopefully sleep on the bus later but right now this is about you this is about you raising the standard this is about you come into your position this is about you overcoming tonight amen it's time that we get ready to go to battle and I was thinking about our church and our youth and each and every one of us and the obligation that we have to fight the obligation that we have to defend what God has done in this day generationally speaking to defend that there is a message sent but not even not not so much even just generate generationally speaking but individually speaking you have to defend what it is God has done for you you have to defend your possessions you have to defend your experience you have to defend your home we have to defend personally what it is God has done and not allow the devil to come in and steal for there's a lot of people that'll defend God sent a prophet there's a lot of people that'll defend God sent a message there's a lot of people and yet they won't defend their own homes they won't defend their own Joy their own peace they're living in defeat they got no Victory they'll tell you oh God sent a prophet there's a message isn't it good but they got no victory in their home you got to defend your experience you've got to defend your land you can't just sit there service after service and well God's good God's good while you're being robbed day after day after that you've got to defend the land you got to defend the landmarks you've got to raise up and be willing to fight for what God has given you in this day we got to rebuild the walls around our families push our way back to the landmarks that are there in the word and recognize that those are for us and then using that word we must begin to rebuild the places that we've allowed the walls to be torn down we have to begin to rebuild the places in our in our lives and we all have them that maybe are weaker than other parts of our lives rebuild the parts in our lives that maybe we've neglected parts that we've allowed to go unattended to we have to take the time to nurture our experience into a true relationship because if your experience is just a one-time thing that happened at an altar in a church service that's not a relationship that was just an encounter and there's lots of people in the Bible that had encounters with Jesus and went to hell you can encounter Jesus but if you don't do something with that encounter if you don't go deeper than that encounter if you don't let it grow into a relationship what good has it actually done you so rebuild the walls and and go into a relationship with him we've heard it time and time again that our our relationships or our experiences with God are not to be a one and done thing it is a walk it is a progression to where we walk with him daily where we go from experience to experience to experience ever growing Ever Changing ever maturing ever getting stronger always Allowing God to mold us into his image continually putting one stone upon another Stone building up this part of the wall and building up this part of the wall is something we have to be doing strengthening me God in this area strengthen my life in this place never ever ever allowing yourself to get comfortable and feel like oh I've arrived you know some people get to that place to where you know they recognize that that there is to be a five-fold Ministry and they recognize that there's going to be Evangelistic preaching but that's really not for me I'm beyond that oh I don't get excited about the Evangelist I need the deeper stuff according to that comment you're the one who needs the Evangelistic stuff the most we never get to a point where the ministry of God isn't doesn't have an impact on our life there's always a place of repentance I Die daily there's always a place of I need more I need to cut down more of myself there's always an opportunity for God to stand on us a little bit to mold us a little bit to shape us a little bit continually allowing this not saying oh I'm there I'm good I'm comfortable but praying Lord shake me again tonight Lord shake me again tonight where am I lacking tonight Lord where can I grow tonight Lord do something for me in this service Lord brother Brown says God we we're not so anxious tonight to see the building shook but we would like for you to shake us Lord Shake our understanding Shake our being Shake our emotions our hearts of understanding that we might leave here tonight more determined than ever to serve you that we might feel the presence of a new Fresh Pentecost of a holy spirit pouring out upon us a fresh and Anew like down in those woods and hills in Arkansas 50 years ago when the forefathers come through here in the horses and wagons preaching the gospel dear Lord may we the bearers of this great worthy cause that you sent through here may we not be ashamed of this great thing but may we walk in the footsteps of those who went before us Lord packing the banner of Lord Jesus Christ there's a banner young people that we're carrying there's a standard that's being lifted up before the people we have to come to the place as Christians to where we are solid to where we're solid in our faith and yet we're still seeking many times they feel like that those that are seeking and those that are at the altar and those oh they must not be very strong no they've actually kind of got it figured out you're supposed to be solid and you're supposed to be strong and yet seeking for more Lord where can I Repent where can more of you come into me pour yourself out of me a little bit more I'm strong Lord but I'm seeking for more we have to be strong examples and yet teachable solid and seeking strong examples and yet teachable leaders and yet willing to be changed listen those two things are not exclusive that I'm a solid Christian and yet I need more of God you can be a Godly overcoming Christian and need more from God as a matter of fact that better be where you're at tonight Lord I'm in the battle Lord I'm overcoming Lord I'm walking in Victory and yet I'm very aware tonight Lord I need more of you I need another touch from you I need more of your Holy Ghost tonight Lord yes I'm in the battle yes I'm fighting yes I'm overcoming but I need more of God but see this is the place where the devil gets so many people he'll take somebody with a burning desire for more of the Holy Ghost and turning against them to where they're afraid to come and seek more of the Holy Ghost that's where they're afraid to come and seek more because what are they going to think if they're if you're back at the altar again listen if you ever get to the point to where your desire for the Holy Ghost is quenched you are deceived because if you're not wanting more if you're not wanting another touch if you're not wanting another outpouring I doubt you ever had the first one we got to be to a place where we're continually God I gotta have more God I need more of you pour yourself back out on me again but the Devil comes and he attacks you there and he points to your weakness and he points to your failures and he accuses you day and night and he accused oh yeah oh yeah you're seeking more because you didn't get nothing oh yeah that's why you're so sorry you know you didn't get nothing from but no no you listen that's not the time to back up that's not the time to listen that's not the time to agree to when he starts pointing all that let me tell you what I point him to I point him to my victories I point into what God's done for me I pointed to a life of what used to be and where I'm at now I point into a life where my desires have changed where my Natures have changed yes I mean more of God yes I need more every day but look what he's already done for me look how much he's changed me look where he's brought me from look where I'm at I'm redeemed I'm blood I'm Blood Washed look at that demo pointing back to the victories pointing back to your experiences pointing back to Calvary that's where we laid it all down that doesn't mean I don't got more to do that doesn't mean the Lord isn't still working on me I know I got walls to build up in my life I know I got areas I need to improve in I know I got places I need to mature hopefully we are all at a place where we can recognize that about ourselves that's where I want you at tonight young people that's where I want you at tonight recognizing your need for more of God but praising him for what he's done for you recognizing I gotta have more but I am an overcomer I am a Christian I am a devil defeater I'm overcoming in laodicea I'm standing in the most evil age God I need more of you it's been a battle this week God I'm struggling oh but I want to thank you for what you've done for me I want to thank you for the experiences I've had I want to thank you for the changed life Lord I want to give you praise thanking him for what he's done and seeking for more I know I need more and when you know that let me tell you something there's more of God for you there's more Holy Ghost for you there's more victory for you there's another touch coming for you there's another refilling coming for you if you're seeking it if you're looking for it oh Lord I just want to apply another dose of the holy ghost in my life I got this spot I need to cover it up I want an experience I want to cover that with the Holy Spirit I'm going to fill in this breach in the wall I want to add this area of protection in my life oh yes I don't let him don't let him young people put it off to the Future you are a defense devil defeater now you are an overcomer now you are victorious now you are a slap in his face now you are the one keeping him from enjoying his kingdom Satan's eating now you are the ones ruining Satan's even I say keep ruining it keep spoiling it keep overcoming keep fighting stay in the battle push for more take more ground build the wall higher raise the standard don't let him get your eyes on your shortcomings he's just trying to get your focus turned away from the fact that you are an overcomer you are called to be a soldier I'll tell him brother Joe in the back I said I was studying some of this and just getting emotional today trying to keep it together thinking about our young people sometimes we let this just become a lifestyle oh we're just going to church we believe the message and we lose track of of the reality of the fact that we are in a war for the very Souls of men this is a heaven or hell thing this is a reality thing this isn't oh I hope it's a good service Wednesday night I hope we get on the bus on time this is about your soul this is about eternity this is real you are a soldier you are called to fight you are called to win you're called to overcome you're called to raise the standard in this war the greatest battle ever folks you are chosen to fight for all that this message has promised called to be a defender of the landmarks called to be a standard Bearer in this battle it's you the Youth of this message the Youth of evening like Tabernacle that is leading the charge in this battle it's you that are on the front lines tonight it's you in the thick of the battle that's overcoming this wicked age listen don't be afraid of your testimony don't be afraid to testify of what God has done for you don't be afraid of that well brother Aaron I ain't there yet I don't want to testify about about this and that when I still got these issue in my life that's nonsense don't let him keep you from testifying listen if you got a hundred demons and one of them gets cast out tonight you testify about that well I still got 99 praise God is one less thing you came in with I'm taking another step I'm growing I'm overcoming testify about what God has done raise the standard and give glory to God brother Aaron I got flaws I've had bad thoughts this week yep if I didn't preach because of the bad thoughts I had somebody else had to be up here truth that's real talk you can get quiet that's that's the truth oh brother and I've had bad thoughts I've got struggles it's because I'm not a Christian no it's because you're in a battle it's because you're in a war s aren't fun Wars aren't easy Wars are difficult you get shot you get wounded you get hurt you have struggles but we keep going we keep fighting we get underneath the banner of the cross the standards lifted high and we march on and we keep going I've been wounded I've been hit but Onward Christian Soldier oh I'm struggling today devil says I ain't gonna make it but I'm going to a Rapture I'm not laying down I'm not quitting I'm getting more tonight I'm getting stronger tonight it's because you're in a battle and I for one young people I'm glad to say that I'm thankful that you're fighting on my side I'm thankful to have you in the battle I'm proud of each and every one of you oh you don't know my struggle I don't care I'm proud of you you're fighting you're standing you're here you're shoulder to shoulder and the greatest battle ever fought and I'm glad to have you quit testifying of your weakness hey sure they're there let's deal with them hey let's deal with it tonight let's find deliveries tonight let's get another outpouring tonight let's find it this weekend whatever but quit testifying about your weakness defend your testimony quit Defending Your weaknesses raise the standard up high defend your experience don't let the devil rob you of what God has done for you too many times that's one reason we want to go from experience to experience because if your experience was several years ago the memory of that and the emotion of that and those parts of it will begin to fade look I know you get sealed with the Holy Ghost you're sealed of the day of your ditch I'm not doing away with that we're talking about strength in the battle we're talking about overcoming we're talking about pressing on you need a fresh experience you need another outporn you need one today where the devil can't tell you it didn't happen it just happened a while ago I know it happened it just happened this morning in my prayer calls and I know it happened it just happened this weekend in Ohio you can't take that from me don't let him rob you of the reality of the experiences that you've had defend them oh but you're weak oh but I'm struggling in the greatest battle that's ever been fought I would like you to remind the devil that you are still here you haven't quit you haven't turned tell and run you haven't given up you're still here you're still fighting you're still reloading you're still firing you're still on the firing line you're still right there face to face with the devil let him know I hadn't run yet and I'm not gonna run now [Music] you're still standing oh and it's age after age after age and here we are in the championship rounds we're getting to the place where only Champion stand we're only conquerors stand and you're still standing oh you're in the corner and our trainer our chief Captain you know many times you're there and in late in the fight if the trainer feels like you got a chance to win but the fighter you're facing is better than you they'll tell you hey there's just one more round left but lay off of him just stay back off of him all you got to do survive this round and you win you're ahead on the scorecard that's right but listen our trainer ain't saying that tonight our captain ain't saying that tonight he's saying not only have you whooped him in every round not only are you still standing take the fight to him take the battle to him he's about to go down he's about to fall you're about to deliver the knockout take the fight to the enemy these are the championship rounds we're still standing Hallelujah our God is in our corner he says take the fight to him take the battle to him finish the fight he thought so much of you and so much of you that he made you a standard Bearer in the final charge of the final battle that will ever be fought someone who would carry the standard someone in the last day that God could trust to see this thing through someone who would lift up the word of God in a world of evil he chose you brother Brown says but in every generation God has always had his agents it's got down sometimes to merely one but God always had somebody in every generation that he could lay his fingers on people that he could put his finger on and say this is my people and they will do as I tell them to do oh I love that of all the people he could have chose think about that God said I need a young people I need a group of people who won't bow down to the pressure of the age I need believers who will protect the truths in this word I need somebody in the worst condition that's ever been that will be willing to stand and fight when it seems like they're completely surrounded when it seems there's no hope when others are caved into the pressure when others are walking away from the message who's he going to be who's he gonna pick in his great Infinite Wisdom down through the ages in his eternal mind knowing all things knowing the people he could choose from no one who could stand no one who could take it who are my very best and we're talking about like the Navy Seals of the ages the Eternal Army Rangers the very best of the best who can I trust to carry the standard into the very teeth of the darkness me I'm just a you're gonna argue with God so many times God's sitting there trying to bless us trying to give us the Holy Ghost trying to give us more and we're arguing with him I'm just not worthy he made you Worthy none of us were worthy he made you worthy he chose you he predestinated you he placed you here because he knew you would get the job done he knew you would raise the standard he knew you would lift up the banner he knew you would stand in the age of Darkness look sure there's people falling away there's people letting down standards there's people that are allowing ancient landmarks to be overrun to be taken by the enemy let's don't get our eyes on that we're talking about you we're talking about where you're standing people sit too long with breeches in their wall and in so doing the gaps in the walls have allowed it's not this it doesn't allow the evil to come in and then the standards go out because the evil can't get in as long as the standards are there what happens is the standards get let down the standards flow out and then the evil Flows In right it's not vice versa but they you allow you sit in a place long enough to where you don't repair the walls and you don't raise the standards and now broken down walls as we said that they're not only allow the the standards out but they allow the enemy to come in and Through the Ages the wall has been torn down and God began to restore and he sent the messages in each age until this day it was perfect complete but what happens over time is people Begin to Fall Away people begin to neglect it's not the problem of the message people allow these areas people begin to teach Doctrine drawing people hold the things that aren't true and in so doing the landmarks move and God's calling the people to rebuild the wall to raise the standard to go fill in the gaps oh well not me I'm just a young person I can't do those things Nehemiah 3 28 from above the horse gate repaired the priest every one over against his house and after them repaired Zara the son of emmer over against his house and after him repaired also shamaya the son of shekiniah and The Keeper of the East Gate and then verse 30 and after him repaired hananiah the son of shalimia and Hanan the sixth son of zelath another piece after him repaired meshalum the son of barakaya over against the chamber right here in this verse the commentators will note that in all these others it says the son of the son of the son of and it gets to Hanan and it says the sixth son of it's the only one who it does like this and what they note is that this is his youngest child this is the young person in the house and it didn't matter to him that the five older brothers didn't want to repair it it didn't matter to him that his five older brothers didn't put their hands to the work it didn't matter to him that the five older brothers were okay with cold formal worship it didn't matter to him that the five other kids in the family were okay letting down the standards of modesty it didn't matter to him that they felt like they could just join a church and believe the message and they were going to be saved he may have been the youngest one in the family and he said but I got a part to play there's a standard to hold up you must be born again there is a standard of modesty there is a standard of Holiness there is a standard of conduct there's something we believe in and the older ones they may not put their hand to it they may not worship they may not build they may not be interested but I'll do it I'll stand up and do it I'll play the part I'll rebuild the wall I'm not worried that I'm younger there's a part I can play and something I can do I'll build the wall I'll raise the standard foreign it doesn't matter what this one says I'll uphold the standards it doesn't matter where this church leans or what that church teaches listen the standard is the word the standard is the word and I'll fight to uphold that standard older ones don't want to do it fine they won't put their hands to the work fine they don't want to create the atmosphere in the service so that people can be born again delivered set free fine our youth will do it they'll worship they'll stand they'll Rejoice they'll give their all they'll go to war they're not ashamed they're not afraid they ain't got to the point yet where they think they've got it all figured out they recognize I need you God come in this service come in this moment blow yourself out in my life they'll do it let no man despise your youth one commentator said that's the younger brother if he'd be the better man and does God and His generation better service he is indeed the better gentleman those that are most honorable are those that are most useful you can do what you want with that hey the older ones wouldn't go kill Goliath fine get out the way please listen we got a church full of really wonderful middle-aging older people so if this don't apply to you don't take the medicine all the medicine in the cabinet ain't supposed to be for you to take but if it does apply to you dose on up get you some it'll do you good there's a generation that's been called to be the final standard bearers and they will stand and they are standing in the face of everything that the enemy can throw at them and their cry is we will not let down the standard brother Brown says no wonder Christianity can't even lift up a standard it's because it's not because Christ is not able but because the people won't do it said the message is ready the power of God is sufficient men and women are scared to break out yonder into the spirit spheres before God and dare to trust him and take him out his word he says so Faith isn't built upon the shifting Sands of emotional Concepts but faith is built upon the standard God's Eternal Word the Rock of Ages that's where Faith takes its solemn resting place and it never moves when it's built right there a people called to raise the standard of the word we talked about it last time how we can't dare to give an inch you can't give up even a little bit we can't let down the bars oh listen we can't be willy-nilly and wishy-washy about things and expect overcoming lives we can't let down standards in our home and expect overcoming children the world that we live in presents a very very dangerous I'll say all for or uh what's the word I want it has escaped me but a way for us to negotiate as it were just give up a little bit and we'll back off just give up a little bit just compromise a little just why can't you be willing to say things a little softer why you gotta be so harsh just be willing to baby things a little bit for the sake that we can all just get along when in reality that's never the end game of the enemy that's not what he wants he doesn't want that inch he doesn't want that peace once you move a little bit listen to me young people we've seen it Time After Time After Time you give a little bit and it is a bottomless pit Straight to Hell many times there's no turning around next thing you know it's not just a standard here and a standard there next thing you know you're in a life of Filth you're in a life where you don't even believe God exists all because you gave a little bit don't let him fool you into thinking he wants just a little bit you compromise a little and you're going to be overrun you compromise even a little and you're going to be overtaken look that's why I'm thankful for a ministry here that'll tell it like it is that'll stand on truth that ain't worried about your feelings that's willing to offend in order to stay true to the word as I've heard it said before the truth don't care about your feelings it's okay I'm leaving here in a minute anyway you can't give an inch listen all this lgbq RSVP stuff that's running all over our nation and trying to overtake and down throw every standard that we've ever had in this world in this in this nation running and says listen 1996 Bill Clinton the liberal of all liberals signed the marriage protection act this is where the Liberals were in 1996 when I was 16. marriage protection act that declared marriage was between a man and a woman that's where the Liberals were you you think it don't go quit Bill Clinton outlawed gay marriage or upheld the fact that it was outlawed however you want to look at it the marriage protection act and for years they cried oh we just want to be treated this we just want the right demand we just want the right to marry why all the hate we don't want to interfere with the way you live you're like we just want to live our life what a lie that turned out to be what oh love love love the liberal rallying cry love wow that we just want to get married we just love each other we want to be married like everyone else you won't even hear from us skip a little but from well not this Pulpit because we wasn't here but in the other Pulpit at evening like Tabernacle I can specifically remember brother Tim preaching they don't just want to get married he said this is the attack point they want to move the standard and make a mockery of anything that is an institution of God it was just their point of attack it was just where they wanted to get started so in 2015 the Supreme Court overruled the marriage protection act giving them to write the right to marry and from that time it has been a flood an absolute unraveling of the standards of society that once was one nation under God how far how far that will they take how far will my life spiral out of control I just want to do some small things I just want to be normal if they did too they wanted to get married and be normal how far has it gone until now there is a movement you don't believe and if you want to get sick to your stomach look it up but there is a movement to no longer use the term pedophile to describe those who want sexual activity with children because it gives them too awful of a stigma it creates a bad reputation for them we are now to know them as map or minor attracted persons foreign very common Topic in the news these days if you don't believe me minor attracted persons we're not supposed to you can't be mean to them just because they want to be with your children I'm sorry that's disgusting I know it's a bottomless pit you can't give an inch you can't back up any you gotta hold the standard of Truth you got to raise it up high for the whole world to see you've got to let them know I'm not neutral this ain't Switzerland I'm not neutral I'm taking a stand I'm going to stand right here on the ancient landmarks I don't care how long you say gay people can get married I don't care how long you say those things are normal that's not the landmark that's not what God instituted I'm gonna stand on God's word I'm going to raise the banner I'm going to hold the scanner you can be mad you can be angry you can hate me that's fine but I'm Gonna Stand and raise a standard and say this is what God called me to be this is eternal truth this is the word of God and it's what I'll live by it's what I'll die by if I do that's what's going to raise me so I'm gonna stand right on it you gotta hold up the standard it disgusts me I'm sorry we've all been there when you ain't 100 sold out to God you get attracted by worldly things you get attracted by this star and this movie and these things and it becomes something that you want to match up to or something that you want to be like brother Brown said I don't care if my pants match my code or my tie matches everything just let my experience match this word right here let my experience match this word right here let this be what I match up to this is what we need to emulate this is what we gotta match this is the experience we gotta have hold the standard let it manifest in you until the word becomes flesh and you are the standard we're not cold to be some soft preaching men Pleasers we're called to hold a standard of Truth and a standard against sin and if things need to be addressed they get addressed if things need to be preached on they get preached on listen that's funny that's one of the parts of the book of Acts people don't like to talk about but you know that almost every time I I won't go there that's almost a an exaggeration many times when brother Brown would reference the book of Acts his reference would be ananias and Sapphira he'd say we need to get back to the book of Acts to where if you walked in the church with something in your life it got called out publicly right there oh we don't want that book of that but what if it hurt my feelings I tell you what your Prophet said he said I've often wanted to come into a church I've longed to see it I guess where I could walk in the back door front door wherever it was look across an audience and see a perfect Church all in order sin couldn't stay there no the spirit would call it out you see it just couldn't stay like ananias and Sapphira you just couldn't do it there'd be no sin in that group no sir the spirit quickly speak it like that he snaps his fingers no matter what it was how little it would be done see women men sitting there under the power of the Holy Ghost the spirit of God moving perfectly moving this someone had done something wrong in the Congress congregation couldn't be they couldn't they come quickly and confess it before the spirit got a hold to confess it before and come tell it because they know right then it's going to be called that's right that's the Church of the Living God how my old poor heart now it's getting old now but I've longed to stand and see a church like that I may yet I hope to I'm just saying that's part of the book of Acts we don't talk about a whole lot but brother Brown did often what was he saying there's a standard to be uphill and many are sitting there not holding the standard up but claiming it he says I hope to be in a church where those things get called out and if you read it carefully he didn't even say the pastor he said where would move on the spirit of somebody else and they'd call it out would we get mad just all of a sudden in pre-service Mike Dexter stands up and I ain't gonna call somebody else's name but looks over here across the church and says you did such and such you need to repent of it hopefully that was towards the altar we can't be standard bearers and be afraid of Correction see that's a standard or a landmark that people have let down right there that the house of God is where correction begins brother Brown says judgment begins at the house of God here's where we are judged it isn't a and isn't it a pity and when we see that we're wrong and doing the wrong thing living the wrong kind of Life Associated wrong and everything that we're just not big enough to walk up and say God I'm sorry I'm the one drawing you're right and I'm wrong and you forgive me and help me to do better the next time it wasn't that big a dude that was the end of it the big Parts overcoming your pride that part's simple he said just help me to do better next time if we just would be that real about ourselves but we don't we hear the gospel preach and say well I don't believe it that way listen the gospel like to tickle our ears and I know we slowed down a minute I'm just gonna try to pick us back up fast enough to land so we don't crash but the gospel like to tickle our ears it's hard sometimes it hurts sometimes but I'll take that if it gets me ready Lord stomp on my toes preach on my life Call My Name whatever it takes but let my judgment be right here let me get ready right here let me stand correction in the house of God do whatever it takes let me be humble enough so on that day I won't have to be judged let me lift up the standard now as one that's willing to be corrected willing to be preached on willing to be talked to Lord if I need it please do it here do it now correct me in this place let my judgments be here Lord thank you he's helped me keep my spirit right being a standard Bearer is a great responsibility and it comes with great Danger because standard bearers lead the charge standards I know we're talking about things we live up to but in it's interchangeable standards or are the colors or or they're the flag they're the battle flag of your unit in ancient times they would be called standards or banners and somebody's got to lift the standard Somebody's gotta lift the banner up huh it shows other soldiers young people where they are it shows where is my unit making a stand at where are we fighting at some in the midst of the chaos of battle get turned around they get wounded they get offended they get hurt those things happen remember this is a battle we talked about that and they get disoriented and they're looking around and what are they looking for they're looking for the banner they're looking for the standard where's my unit where's my group at where's the charge at and they look and they look and in the midst of all that they can locate that they look for the flag of their unit it says if in the course of a fight you're separated from your unit one would look around until they would see the standard and then they would try to get back close to it the standard bear in battle is in the center of the front line so that all the troops know where to go but it also shows the enemy where to shoot it shows where the charge is coming young people every gun in hell is trained on you this isn't for the faint-hearted this isn't for the weak in spirit this ain't for the ones that's going to run scared and that's why he called you he knew what you were made out of he knew you were made out of stuff that don't Bluff that's why when the bullets start flying and people start saying well we don't need all that emotion no more the days of Miracles has passed it doesn't matter how you dress all y'all's church is just old-fashioned oh y'all are just a whole whole bunch of Holy Rollers those bullets start flying all around you you don't turn and run you don't back down off your testimony you don't get scared you just raise the banner a little bit hard yeah that's me that's us that's where we stand right here boys this is where we're fighting right here this is where we're standing we're called to carry the standard we will protect this land against every attack listen this bride will not be lukewarm about this word she will have a passion for truth she will have a passion for her Homeland she will fight to protect her Homeland if it costs me friends if it cost me popularity with it bring struggle into my life I don't care we are going to stand for the whole gospel for the entire Truth for the message the way it was presented we will display the truth we're gonna preach and live the whole message that's the young people in this church I believe that with my whole heart and listen the message preached exactly the way it was delivered will produce exactly what the message promises it will produce oh we want to leave parts off and preach half of it and preach this part of it and then blame the message when it don't produce the results you want to see you've got to embrace the whole thing you've got to preach the whole message you got to preach it in its entirety foreign 60 and 4 we open with this thou has given a banner to them that fear thee that it may be displayed because of the truth Selah young people we got to Rally to the colors tonight we got to Rally to The Standard rally on Truth rally on the word don't be afraid of this word it's going to produce exactly what it said it would you preach this word in its entirety you stand on it's going to produce gifts it's going to produce the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's going to produce overcoming young people how do you know I see him I see them right here in this church I've seen lives changed I've seen people filled I've seen people overcome habits they couldn't overcome it will produce what it promised it would produce but we got to quit moving the landmarks quit changing the standards and then criticizing those that still hold them well maybe we can just let our young people do a little of this maybe we shouldn't be so horrible I'm looking at a group of young people that love it just the way the prophet gave it I believe we got a group of young people we can be proud of we got a group of young people that's standing in the most evil day living the message to its fullest overcoming still fighting Still Standing they ain't worried about let's lower the standards a little bit I love this group of young people you are awesome you should be proud of yourself quit letting the devil talk down to you we ain't gotta lower no standards I heard a story about a standard Bearer in battle and they were attacking this enemy position and things weren't going so well they'd been shot to pieces they've been shot to Pieces but the one with the standard the one with the banner had made it further up the hill than anybody else and he was up there in the general decided that the battle was lost and he needed to retreat we got too many of those Generals in the pulpits but he decided that the battle was lost and that they did they was getting shot up and it wasn't a worthy cause enemy fire was strong and they were being shot to pieces and the general deemed the battle law so he calls to the standard Bearer and he orders him he says bring back the flag and the standard Bearer calls back over his shoulder and says I will not bring back the flag how about you bring up your men come on church we ain't got to lower the standards how about you bring up the men how about you bring up your lives how about you bring it up to the baptism of the Holy Ghost how about you charge the enemy we won't bring the standard down we won't bring the banner down we won't back up how about you bring up the men Hallelujah hold the standard stand true and fight I'm not gonna go up to the layout of sea I'm not going to give up my rights I'm not going to give up my joy I'm not going to give up what God's given me I'm not coming back after I fought all this way to get here how about you bring up the men Hallelujah how about we lower some listen it's not our landmarks it's God's landmarks I can't I can't bring them back the landmarks are what they are and you can stay standing we're fixing it close so young people when people were saying to you lower the standard say no how about you bring up your lives how about you bring it up to the standard of the baptism of the Holy Ghost you know I heard when we when we look we're fixing to go to Ohio I said we raise the banner High I say we get the banner up real high I heard when we showed up last year and got off the bus they said the holy rollers are here Hallelujah hey don't be afraid of that Banner raise it up how come what up him I'm one of them I'm so glad that I can say I'm what I've been I'm not afraid of that standard raise the banner oh there's a standard of worship it's in spirit and it's in truth raise that Banner huh and let them know this is what victory looks like this is what Joy looks like this is the banner of freedom Hallelujah listen don't take your freedom for granted freedom is just like territory that which is not defended is lost you'll be willing to defend that wave it high you worship with your whole hearts if I got something to say you can stand for a minute and hurt you some of y'all need to quit siding with the accuser of the brethren every time somebody gets a shout and a dancing Runway I happen to know that they shouted in church one time and then they had sin in their life accused day and night you just doing your job going to and fro I understand you can't help it listen there's a real big difference I I believe in the Sin killing religion let me say this young people you got sin in your life and the spirit of God moves instead of running the aisles you should run to the altar 100 percent I'm on board with that but I also believe those that struggle and fight and battle the hardest they worship the hardest too I get a little bit of Victory they ain't afraid oh there may be this devil and I may have this trouble but this just got freed off of me imma run around a little bit I'ma let the world know God just set me free God just lose me if you got a problem with that the problem's you [Music] hey look there's a big difference in that and a hypocrite a hypocrite is someone that's not hypocritical worship a hypocrite somebody's trying to fool everybody that's living in sin but trying to convince everybody they're living right that's a big difference between somebody that's in the battle they may be struggling but they're next to me on the firing line I got no problem with their worship I got no problem with how much they jump I got no problem with how much they shot lift the banner of Freedom up high say I'll carry the banner of worship I'll praise my God I'll fight I'll build the wall I ain't worried about what you do but as for me I got something to praise him about I got something to shout about I got something to worship my God about musicians can come Jeremiah 50 and 2. declare ye among the Nations and publish and set up a standard publish and conceal it not that means let the whole world know conceal it not what's happening Babylon is taken Baal is confounded oh those ones that came and tried to take you captive they held you prisoner raise the standard Babylon is taken those spirits of bail that tried to hold me they are confounded meridoc is broken into pieces her Idols are confounded her images are broken that image she tried to put in your life tried to make you one of them trying to make you a Babylonian raise the standard Babylon has fallen her Idols are destroyed they couldn't hold me but there's a banner of Freedom I'm free I'm free I'm free young people don't let the devil convince you that you need to wait don't let him kill you you're not strong enough to build the wall you're not strong enough to line up in the Army and fight that you ain't strong in the faith don't let him come and say you can't defeat me you can't stand wait a little bit now is the time to raise the banner now is the time to raise the standard up high oh brother and what about when I'm older what about when I'm stronger now I'm closing with this y'all know I love history Patrick Henry y'all have all heard of him famous speeches he gave is your excerpts from one he gave in Harrisonburg Virginia he says they tell us sir and just go ahead put your spiritual ears on and young people let this be you it's the devil telling you this they tell us sir that we are weak unable to cope with so formidable an adversary but when shall we be stronger will it be the next week or the next year will it be when we are totally disarmed and when a British guard shall be stationed in every house shall We Gather strength by an action sir we are not weak if we make proper use of the means which the god of nature hath placed in our power besides sir we shall not fight our battles alone there is a just God who presides over the Destinies of Nations and who shall raise up friends to fight our battles for us the battle sir is not to the strong alone it is to the Vigilant the active and the brave there is no retreat but in submission and slavery our chains are forged their clanking may be heard on the plains of Boston the war is inevitable and let it come I repeat sir let it come gentlemen May Cry peace peace but there is no peace the war has actually begun our Brethren are already in the field why stand we hear idle what is it that gentlemen wish what would they have is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of change in slavery forbid it almighty God I know not what course others may take but as for me Give me liberty or give me death raise the banner as we go to Ohio this week I will have Liberty I will have freedom the battle has already begun but we're not backing down we're here to hold the standard this is what the message produces this is the standard this is who we are Overcomers in the most evil age ever Give me liberty Give Me Freedom defend your freedom defend the faith defend the word and raise the standard tonight God bless you Church Hallelujah Hallelujah the name of the Lord [Applause] the Lord's Prayers go power hold the banner paint with the word amen with the sons of the most high God

tonight hey man let's sing a couple of verses of that before we uh have prayer today well I'm one of them [Applause] [Music] [Music] this came I thought that I can say I'm going to find one of them I don't understand foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] I wanna I'm so glad that I couldn't say it again like come my brother seek this blessing it will cleanse your heart from skin I guarantee you this it'll start to Joy bells are ringing and it'll keep the soul of flame it is hurting now within my heart can you say it tonight all glory to his name I'm so glad that I can stand what a day day amen now while we sing this course again I would like all the young people that are going to the the camp going to be on the bus tonight to step down here to the front and we're going to just have a word of prayer with you and uh but I got a few words I'd like to speak to you myself as you stand up here let me just see who you are a man said you'll just come as we sing that course again I'm one of them I'm one [Music] say I'm one of them I Wanna Dance Hallelujah [Applause] [Music] now I'm looking out to see who I'm preaching at Sunday so you know I'll I'll need you to be a standard Bearer right here and to draw the sword with me amen I'm going to be speaking Lord willing on on Sunday morning I've got some things that the Lord has been dealing with my heart and so I know that it's going to be wonderful amen for you what we have some great services that are laying ahead for these young people that are going and uh we heard we heard tonight the the charge the exhortation there and I just wanted to kind of re-emphasize some of those things as we are gathered and I know the bus is already here and you're going to be leaving here in just a few minutes but again you know when when you're there there will should be no shame in seeking more of God absolutely no shame nobody should go to Camp saying I got all I need that's laodicea laodicea says I have need of nothing so you know whether it's me or whether it's you we uh we need more of Jesus we need a greater and a deeper experience and God to just reveal himself to us in a greater way and so you are you of course are the the rallying point in the face of attack and we are sending you forth there too to to to be a part of that meeting realizing we're at War for the souls of men and because of that you know we want to make sure that our Behavior our action and and everything that we do will help another Soul find Jesus now this is really important because a lot of times you know you you get together and young people can distract one another don't be a distraction to each other do what you can to encourage one another to press in with all of your heart and you raise the standard as as our youth will be going forth from here to lead the charge I have that kind of confidence in you we're here in the championship round and God has trusted you to to raise the standard and um and it doesn't matter whether we're young or whether we're old listen that scripture brother Aaron read uh are quoted you know let no man despise our youth I I that was something that struck my heart when he when Paul told that to Timothy and I said hey I'm a I'm a Tim I'm a Timothy and so Paul said let no man despise thy youth so I took that to heart when I was 15 years old nobody was going to despise my youth amen I was going to serve God I was going to put everything that I had into it I was going to lift a standard and I was going to encourage others and so you know we we went forth to lead the charge we're still doing that here at evening light Tabernacle we are people that we are not we're not so much following what others are doing we are leading the charge going down the path of righteousness toward the Rapture and so we're holding the standard here in this end time now it is of course wherever gun of hell is um trained on you and and but I God has confidence in calling you from this day and this hour for for the purpose now I want you to know I love every one of you and I think we have the greatest group of young people that there is in the entire message around the world you are the best and I I want just to to know I want you to know that I know that you will do everything to um to hold that standard of being the best and uh whether you're on the bus in your conduct with you know sometimes this Close Quarters with male and female and sometimes um you know we we want to we get in High Spirits and want to Heckle and joke around you know and make things difficult for other people but I know you won't do that I know you're that kind of young people that will respect one another and respect the counselors that are at the camp and those that are riding on the bus and so I I have ever been a confidence in you that you're going to be the best and I want to thank you in advance because you know you just you show that over and over and over that you're that kind of young people you show that here at the church in the way they that you act believe that you behave and conduct yourself and I know you will show your that that um on on the bus and there uh on in the camp and come back where we will have a reporter brother Tim that you have the greatest and best young people that there is and and and that's the kind of report I got back last time so you know why would I expect anything less of you than to see that same and I know that's what it will be and God's going to be with you he's going to do great things in your life he's going to give you a a recharge some of you he will fill with the Holy Spirits others he will refill others he will gift you in certain ways or reveal something to you you're going to receive something from God and God's going to speak to you in a very clear and direct way and so as you were exhorted no don't wait till the last service go expecting God to meet me on the from the very first service on and I can just build until it becomes a crescendo and so I just um want to I want to just say those things before that you go and let's have prayer together with you you you're going to see the exceeding
