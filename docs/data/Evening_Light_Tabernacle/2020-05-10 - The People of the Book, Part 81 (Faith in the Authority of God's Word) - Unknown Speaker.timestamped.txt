[36:47] this actually was my New Year's message
[36:51] that I read from this text here and we
[36:55] want to day just to look at it again as
[36:59] we go to the Lord and and as we're
[37:02] thankful to be able to gather even like
[37:05] we are gathering with the freedoms that
[37:06] we have I just wanted to mention that
[37:10] we have brethren that are in China that
[37:13] are imprisoned just for possessing and
[37:17] and sharing the King James Version Bible
[37:19] so we want to remember those believers
[37:23] that are there in in prison and some of
[37:27] them are have been threatened to be
[37:29] locked away for a lifetime because of
[37:32] this and so we did get word today that
[37:36] brother LV one of the brothers there was
[37:39] able to get out of prison so we thank
[37:43] God for that that he's been released but
[37:45] there are others that are there that we
[37:48] are believed in that God is going to
[37:50] bring a deliverance and that he's gonna
[37:53] set them free and man hi I know he did
[37:57] it for Peter a man he can do it for them
[38:00] and he can do what men thinks impossible
[38:03] and so while we are enjoying the the
[38:06] freedoms that we're having today and
[38:08] even though maybe we might feel like
[38:11] there's somewhat limited on account of
[38:13] the quarantine that's been going on we
[38:16] still have at least some freedoms today
[38:19] to to preach the Word of God and to
[38:22] broadcast this around the world and so
[38:26] we thank God for that opportunity we're
[38:28] looking forward to again being together
[38:30] very very soon and so we we expect
[38:36] things to change as they as things move
[38:40] along and the quarantine is rules
[38:43] changes and hopefully that we'll be able
[38:46] to meet together really really soon and
[38:48] we have been in contact with you on our
[38:51] evening light web page there on the
[38:54] Facebook page just to kind of keep you
[38:56] updated on how that we will go about
[38:59] doing that in time but so if you'll just

[39:13] time in the presence of God so we are
[39:17] glad today for those few of you that
[39:19] could be here and share this moment
[39:22] especially
[39:24] you mothers that are gonna have to go on
[39:25] and cook your own Mother's Day dinner
[39:27] and you know so it's probably not gonna
[39:31] be waiting on you today you're out in
[39:33] some restaurant somewhere that's because
[39:36] of the rules that are different but
[39:38] anyway happy Mother's Day

[39:43] dinner amen god bless you ain't meant
[39:46] for your faithfulness I'm sure you'll
[39:48] get a pot or a pan or something that'll
[39:50] help you with your duties today and so I
[39:56] know one of my one of my grandma I heard
[40:00] of one of one child anyway saying about
[40:02] its mom we're gonna get her a pot so you
[40:04] know mama needs another pot I'm sure
[40:07] amen so it's good to be here it's good
[40:09] to be in the presence of God and be able
[40:11] to talk about the good things of God and
[40:14] knowing that his word is the truth and
[40:17] and we can we can expect God to do it
[40:21] tremendous things and I I believe we're
[40:24] living in a day where God is doing some
[40:26] very very extreme things as he works
[40:30] here in this evening time and this
[40:32] process of finishing up all things in
[40:35] the fulfillment of the scriptures and I
[40:39] would like to I would like to look at
[40:42] John chapter 1 and verse 1 for another
[40:46] scripture reading and as you're turning
[40:49] there I'm just going to remind you of a
[40:52] portion of the scripture that we just
[40:55] read this book of the law shall not
[40:59] depart out of that mouth but thou shalt
[41:01] meditate therein day and night that thou
[41:03] may observe to do all that is written
[41:06] therein for then thou shalt make that
[41:08] way prosperous and then thou shalt have
[41:11] good success and then John 1 and 1 tells
[41:16] us that in the beginning was the word
[41:19] and the Word was with God and the Word
[41:22] was God and the same was in the
[41:26] beginning with God and all things were
[41:28] made by him and without him was not
[41:30] anything made that was made in him was
[41:33] life and the life was the light of men
[41:36] skipping down to verse
[41:38] but as many as received him to them gave
[41:41] he power to become the sons of God even
[41:45] to them that believe on his name which
[41:48] were born not of blood nor of the will
[41:51] of the flesh nor the will of man but of
[41:54] God and the Word was made flesh and
[41:57] dwelt among us and we beheld his glory
[41:59] the glory as of the only begotten of the
[42:03] Father full of grace and truth today
[42:08] we're going to be speaking on the faith
[42:11] in the authority of God's Word now
[42:15] reading here in John 1 we see that the
[42:20] word that was in the beginning was made
[42:23] flesh in Jesus Christ and we know that
[42:28] Jesus came to demonstrate the word in
[42:33] flesh if we want to see what we're to do
[42:36] what the church is to be like all we
[42:40] have to do is look at Jesus and the
[42:42] Ministry of Jesus and to see what the
[42:45] gospel brought us in and brother Branham
[42:49] would speak about this he said the word
[42:51] came to the prophets but Jesus was
[42:54] different from that he was the word the
[42:57] Prophet could only say what was put in
[43:00] his mouth to say but Jesus was that word
[43:04] and the entire Word of God could flow
[43:07] through him and he could create and he
[43:11] could stop the winds and the waves and
[43:13] what more because it was God always in
[43:17] the word now God is trying to find a
[43:20] church that he can project his word
[43:23] through you see God watches over his
[43:27] word to vindicate it so now we we notice
[43:31] God's speaking through the prophets and
[43:33] then God spoke to us in a son but now
[43:36] God is going to project himself looking
[43:41] for church that he can project his word
[43:44] through that the thoughts of God can be
[43:48] manifested through them and and of
[43:51] course in our generation we know that
[43:54] the miraculous has been done and it was
[43:57] done to activate our faith in the world
[44:00] hey man the problem is of course many
[44:05] people's their faith not misplaced he
[44:07] got put in brother Branham but that's
[44:10] not what he was sent to do he came to
[44:13] restore our faith back to the Apostolic
[44:15] fathers and the the early apostolic
[44:19] faith was in the atonement and that's
[44:23] what it was to do it was to put our
[44:26] faith back in the Word of God you see
[44:29] brother Branham can't always be here
[44:31] he's already been gone over 50 years
[44:35] nearly going toward 60 years now but but
[44:40] again I'm you know he can't he can't be
[44:43] here and that he wasn't meant to be here
[44:46] in this time but the Word of God is what
[44:50] we were to have our faith put in because
[44:54] the Word of God is eternal are you with
[44:57] me now phases of victory the Bible said
[45:01] that overcomes the world and that faith
[45:05] must not reside in a man or it will die
[45:09] with the man but it must be in the
[45:13] eternal Word of God now of course you
[45:17] know when we think of that faith is our
[45:18] victory when John wrote that as we would
[45:21] read he could read him first John when
[45:23] he wrote faith is the victory that
[45:24] overcometh the world you you said well
[45:27] he didn't have my troubles or he didn't
[45:29] have to deal with the people that I deal
[45:32] with or didn't have to go through the
[45:34] things that I do and that's right he may
[45:37] not have to deal with the same folks he
[45:39] may not have to overcome the same thing
[45:41] but he never excluded that he said faith
[45:44] is the victory that overcometh the world
[45:47] the whole thing so again how is it it's
[45:51] faith in it so we are to ride above the
[45:55] things of the world that we are to
[45:57] overcome we have the written
[45:58] word of god layin before us and the Holy
[46:02] Spirit also which is also the word
[46:05] because Jesus is the word the Holy
[46:07] Spirit or God is the word come on
[46:09] somebody and so this is the word that
[46:13] and that has been written the thoughts
[46:14] of God written on paper so we have the
[46:17] written word of God in the Holy Spirit
[46:19] here performing and showing the
[46:22] resurrection of the Lord Jesus with the
[46:25] divine promises that are written here
[46:28] that whatsoever things that you desire
[46:31] when you pray that you that you receive
[46:34] it and you know and you shall have it
[46:36] you believe it and you shall have it
[46:38] again with what you do what do you do
[46:41] then you have faith a faith that anchors
[46:44] in what God said not a make-believe
[46:47] faith but a real faith now faith is a
[46:51] conqueror brother Branham would talk
[46:53] about this he said Bates's an overcomer
[46:55] you know it's not just a peacemaker it
[46:58] overcomes faces the victory that
[47:01] overcomes the world and so it is it is a
[47:06] conquering and to to conquer and victory
[47:10] is the same thing it means to beat down
[47:12] to override the handcuff to throw into
[47:15] prison it means that the sin that once
[47:18] ruled you it means that you rule it now
[47:23] and then it means you have overcome it
[47:26] and you have whipped it and you're
[47:28] greater than it is amen
[47:31] so we think about what was first the sin
[47:34] the sinner and the Savior a savior was
[47:37] first so a savior is more powerful than
[47:39] sin so which was first the healer or the
[47:43] sickness you know that couldn't be a
[47:46] healer of course and until until there
[47:50] was sickness but God in his mind already
[47:53] knew this was coming by the choice it
[47:55] man made and so as a healer it could
[47:58] conquer the sickness and the faces of
[48:02] victory that overcomes every curse of
[48:05] the devil faith in what now not in your
[48:09] church not painting a Creed
[48:12] not faith and some man but paid to Jesus
[48:15] Christ you've made the promise man it is
[48:19] the victory you know a lot of times we
[48:21] look at circumstances my arm is still
[48:25] crippled my pain is still there
[48:27] I still feel sick but faith is the
[48:30] victory that overcomes the world and
[48:33] when you climb into God by prayer until
[48:37] you see the thing is conquered
[48:39] underneath you there is nothing can hurt
[48:42] you then you're overcome and man you're
[48:45] sailing free then because you you
[48:48] realize the thing is conquered beneath
[48:51] you man now you you know some of you
[48:55] that were a drunkard or slave to to
[48:57] alcohol you know he used to be your
[49:00] master but you're the master now hey man
[49:04] why what happened when you got faith
[49:07] faith gave you the victory to overcome
[49:12] that Jesus said you can be free the word
[49:15] said you can be free and you started
[49:18] believing what the Lord said and then
[49:21] you begin acting upon what the word said
[49:23] and God brought you deliverance in your
[49:26] life hey man so that when that happens
[49:29] then your enemy is your servant he has
[49:32] to do what you say man now so you know
[49:35] that brother branham talked about this
[49:37] about a woman he said that that she
[49:40] cried and begged and cried to be
[49:43] delivered of tobacco and you know said
[49:46] she she would come to the altar time
[49:49] after time after time
[49:50] wanting to be delivered and and she saw
[49:53] brother Branham I I cried and I prayed
[49:56] and I've cried and I prayed and he said
[49:59] well you're just emotional you're just
[50:02] fighting the air that won't be no good
[50:04] he said I'd get down and pray with her
[50:05] lay hands on her and she'd go back to
[50:08] meet a few days and she just knock you
[50:10] down with cigarette smoke her hands were
[50:12] still brown but one night she went to
[50:15] the doctor and and the doctor diagnosed
[50:19] her with a with a disease and she was
[50:22] ghaleon
[50:23] to die it was Tims she got down to
[50:25] business man you know a drowning man
[50:28] will reach for a straw and as long as
[50:31] you walk out of the church and just go
[50:33] join this church and that church and you
[50:36] know I'm a good person there's nothing
[50:38] wrong with me and that's what she kept
[50:40] doing well I love Jesus and yet I can
[50:42] still smoke and I love Jesus but when
[50:45] she got down to business and you cease
[50:49] all her sins in the light of the Bible
[50:52] and then she repented she got down that
[50:56] place where repent or perish
[50:59] and then then got down to business and
[51:02] with God and of course you know I'm
[51:05] there because of that at that moment in
[51:08] time and brother Branham wouldn't buy
[51:10] her place after prayin time after time
[51:12] after time and but when she reached that
[51:15] point of getting down to business
[51:18] and my words he put her faith in the
[51:21] Word of God and realized this is a sin I
[51:25] must have big tree over it was then that
[51:28] God brought he delivers in her life
[51:31] and man he said well why didn't she
[51:33] overcome before because he was just
[51:35] fluttering around but when she got down
[51:38] to business with God it was then that
[51:41] God moved him to sing for her and the
[51:44] same thing happens for you when you get
[51:46] down to business with God I mean that's
[51:49] when God is going to move on the scene
[51:51] for you in your situation
[51:53] hey man you put your faith in in in God
[51:57] he said when you get down to business he
[52:00] said why wait that long why not get down
[52:03] to business now put your faith in God
[52:06] what is the woman that put her faith in
[52:09] me and failed because I'm a man but when
[52:12] she changed her faith not in the Branham
[52:15] tabernacle and William Branham or anyone
[52:18] else but placed her faith in Jesus
[52:20] Christ
[52:21] did she got faced you raised up above
[52:23] her fears and doubts and God healed her
[52:25] and she overcome faith is the victory
[52:28] that overcomes now we gotta realize that
[52:33] when when
[52:36] Brannen was here he was given a gift
[52:39] sent by the angel of God with a gift to
[52:42] cause our faith to rise in the promise
[52:48] are you with me hey man his gift was not
[52:52] given to heal you but to get you to
[52:55] believe that Jesus is present and he
[53:00] could be touched by your needs
[53:03] amen now brother Branham said this in
[53:06] from that time he said he said now I'm
[53:09] what did she touch she touched a high
[53:12] priest if you believe all things are
[53:14] possible I'm watching just keep praying
[53:17] wherever you are balcony wherever you
[53:19] are keep praying Lord remember me I'm
[53:20] safe now don't
[53:22] now don't now don't try to make you
[53:24] nervous yourself nervous just say Lord I
[53:27] believe the man is telling me the truth
[53:29] I believe he's so what did the angel
[53:31] tell me if you can get the people to
[53:35] believe you
[53:36] now listen not believe me as a man but
[53:41] believe the message I'm telling you
[53:44] believe me and be sincere when you pray
[53:49] nothing will stand before your prayer
[53:52] that's what the man speaking of the
[53:54] angel said to me sees it he told me not
[53:57] to get the people to believe me he said
[54:00] not as a man but believe my message now
[54:07] my message listen his message is the
[54:11] Word of God believe the Bible it was to
[54:16] get you not to believe him
[54:18] the man believed the word that he was
[54:23] bringing now I'm trying to bring
[54:25] something here today faith in the
[54:28] authority of God's Word
[54:30] now again you know we wonder how can I
[54:35] touch him he's a high preach that can be
[54:37] touched by the feelings of our
[54:38] infirmities when Jesus was here people
[54:42] would reach out and touches the hem of
[54:44] His garment or part of his garment as he
[54:47] passed behind many were healed
[54:49] right the woman there that reached out
[54:52] and touched him she was healed but
[54:55] genuine faith he says no no defeat it's
[54:58] already done it's already over God said
[55:01] so that finishes God said so not to say
[55:04] they when you really believe it that
[55:08] touches him
[55:11] now get this stop because we wonder how
[55:15] can I touch him he's not here physically
[55:18] but he's yet he's I preach that can be
[55:21] touched he is touched when you really
[55:25] believe him so this is what God's trying
[55:29] to get you to do is to reach out in
[55:32] faith and touch him hey man now and he
[55:37] said the little woman that touched His
[55:39] garment said if I can just touch His
[55:41] garment I'll be made whole and she did
[55:43] it and when she carried out her what her
[55:46] faith wanted her to do touch it he felt
[55:49] it and he turned around and spoke to and
[55:52] he says now he's right now let her faith
[55:55] touches garment he's right now is the
[55:58] high priest that can be touched by the
[56:00] feelings of an Germany we all know that
[56:03] in him he's the same yesterday today and
[56:05] forever he'll have to act today as he
[56:07] did yesterday if he's still the same
[56:10] high priest and he is a man a man now so
[56:14] again this is very very important did
[56:16] you understand we can still touch him
[56:19] with our faith now but it all has to do
[56:29] with your approach to God just like
[56:33] Martha remember Martha she was always
[56:36] busy about every other thing and Mary
[56:39] was sitting at his feet but now Martha
[56:42] gives her chance when Lazarus is dead
[56:45] and she has a right she thinks perhaps
[56:47] or maybe someone would think to to to
[56:52] chastise Jesus she could have been here
[56:54] you could have come we're not when we
[56:56] sit for you you know why didn't you
[56:58] you were his friend but she didn't she
[57:01] stood right there and she had the right
[57:03] approach and she said Lord if you'd have
[57:07] been here my brother wouldn't have died
[57:08] but even now Lord and that approach to
[57:13] God calls God to move on the behalf of
[57:19] Lazarus are you with me because that she
[57:23] had the right approach to God if we can
[57:27] have the right approach to God this
[57:28] morning that God's gonna move on my
[57:31] behalf
[57:32] now so you see if you can get the people
[57:36] to believe that's what brother Branham
[57:37] has said it's only a sign to get you to
[57:40] believe that Jesus Christ died for your
[57:43] sickness and your sins and accepting it
[57:47] on the basis of his shed blood and you
[57:50] draw the attributes from it and anything
[57:52] you not need of God God will give it to
[57:55] you if you can only believe it so again
[57:59] the sign was to give you to believe that
[58:04] brother NSAID not me as a man but that
[58:06] message and my message is that we accept
[58:10] him on the basis of his shared blood and
[58:14] you draw the attributes from the promise
[58:18] of the word now the reason I'm bringing
[58:22] that out is because you know again we're
[58:26] not going through this whole on the
[58:28] scenario again brother Branham standing
[58:31] here and discerning the thoughts and
[58:33] intents are hard and calling this an out
[58:35] now if I can get you to believe but you
[58:38] know we can't we can't come into that
[58:42] round anymore that's a round past that's
[58:45] a day past but the word is still present
[58:48] and if we can have the same faith in the
[58:53] same word that brother Branham was
[58:56] bringing them are you with me a man then
[58:59] we can see the same results
[59:03] again if we can get the people to
[59:06] believe what the automa that is faithful
[59:14] that it's mine
[59:17] that God's willing to heal me that is
[59:20] written in the world it's my promise and
[59:22] every promise of this word is mine now
[59:28] so again believe what believe that
[59:31] brother Branham was a good man believe
[59:33] that it was a prophet no believe that
[59:35] Jesus Christ died for your sickness and
[59:39] your sins and accepted it on the basis
[59:43] of his shed blood that's how you draw
[59:46] attributes from him anything you have
[59:50] need of of God will will give it God
[59:53] will give it to you if you can only
[59:55] believe it now again I want to go back
[1:00:01] we don't have brother Branham anymore we
[1:00:04] have the word though and that's what he
[1:00:07] was trying to get our faith in hey man
[1:00:11] so we're and if we got the word that we
[1:00:15] got healing
[1:00:16] we got delivered we got salvation
[1:00:19] everything lays in the promise of the
[1:00:22] word it's just dependent on you
[1:00:25] believing not that God can do it but
[1:00:29] that he's done it for you that is a
[1:00:32] personal God now there is nothing that
[1:00:39] can take place take the place of the
[1:00:42] written word now I'm trying to try to
[1:00:45] get your thoughts into the value of the
[1:00:49] Bible the Word of God I'm gonna say some
[1:00:53] very straight things about that because
[1:00:55] Bible said that faith comes by hearing
[1:00:57] and hearing the Word of God is that
[1:01:01] right now brother right incentives we
[1:01:04] see that they approach and as it is now
[1:01:06] I'm very happy that know we still have
[1:01:09] the Bible God's eternal blessed word hey
[1:01:14] ma'am
[1:01:15] and he said there's nothing will ever
[1:01:18] take its place there never be a
[1:01:22] denomination a church I'll never be a
[1:01:25] person are an individual that will ever
[1:01:29] take the place of this written word cuz
[1:01:34] in the beginning was the word and go and
[1:01:37] the word was god and the word was with
[1:01:40] god and the word was gone so there may
[1:01:43] never be a denomination a church a
[1:01:48] person aren't individual that can take
[1:01:52] the place of the word understand Amen
[1:01:58] brother branham can't take the place of
[1:02:00] the Bible and it meant no great profit
[1:02:03] no great man of God no great preacher no
[1:02:06] great church now that's been the problem
[1:02:09] churches have come along denominations
[1:02:13] they have taken the place of the Word of
[1:02:16] God by interpreted to me something
[1:02:19] different right Amen but our faith must
[1:02:23] be in the written word of God let's see
[1:02:27] the value of this now I'm turn with me
[1:02:31] to first Corinthians two and four
[1:02:32] Paul said my speech and my preaching was
[1:02:37] not with enticing words of man's wisdom
[1:02:39] but in the demonstration of the Spirit
[1:02:43] and power that your faith should not
[1:02:47] stand in the wisdom of men but in the
[1:02:51] power of God so again Paul was saying
[1:02:54] our faith is to rest in the power of God
[1:02:59] and that's found in the Word of God the
[1:03:02] word has all the power of God right in
[1:03:06] it
[1:03:07] amen all the power all the in appearance
[1:03:11] and meant all the wonderful powers to
[1:03:14] create to create a world lays in the
[1:03:18] Word of God now let's just see this in
[1:03:21] Romans 1:16 I want you to look at this
[1:03:24] scripture with me well I'm not a shame
[1:03:26] the gospel of Christ we already know
[1:03:28] this in Bihar for it is the power of God
[1:03:31] unto salvation to everyone that
[1:03:33] believeth to the Jew first and also to
[1:03:35] the Greek
[1:03:36] so let's look at this a moment I am not
[1:03:38] ashamed of the gospel now that's the
[1:03:43] word right I am not ashamed of the word
[1:03:46] so he says the word is the power of God
[1:03:51] for deliverance if you can look at it
[1:03:55] again look at the script real close now
[1:03:57] and see and read with me what it's
[1:04:00] saying the gospel the word is the power
[1:04:05] of God for deliverance that's what the
[1:04:09] Bible said if the gospel is the word
[1:04:12] come then the word is the power of God
[1:04:17] for salvation for deliveries amen so now
[1:04:23] if you want to know where the power is
[1:04:26] it lays in the world a map and the word
[1:04:32] will only be as powerful as what you
[1:04:36] release it to be from your life a man so
[1:04:41] again in the Word of God is the power of
[1:04:45] God for deliverance for salvation for
[1:04:47] healing for ever need now let me stop a
[1:04:51] minute let me just add let me just stop
[1:04:55] for a moment I'm hearing there ever
[1:04:57] every day it seems like every day I'm
[1:05:00] hearing of another struck down with
[1:05:02] cancer another I've never seen such a
[1:05:05] time in my life just got a just got a
[1:05:08] word from a dear friend of mine
[1:05:11] Truman Jackson we prayed about his wife
[1:05:14] sister Carol there there there longtime
[1:05:17] friends of mine that I've known for many
[1:05:19] many years

[1:05:26] it's got reoccurring cancer again in her
[1:05:29] body we've been praying for our brother

[1:05:51] these my little ones you've done it to
[1:05:53] me he said
[1:05:53] and so God seems a very tokens very
[1:05:56] reason I wore this tie this morning
[1:05:58] because I'm speaking to you about your
[1:06:00] need but I want you to know you know
[1:06:03] when we when we hear about all these
[1:06:06] different needs and and just hearing the
[1:06:10] other day of brother Mike walls his wife
[1:06:12] was that for cancer operation comes down
[1:06:17] goes in and and it's gotten um sister
[1:06:20] Wayne that's got a koban nineteen a
[1:06:23] positive test and he's sick with the
[1:06:26] with the cove in nineteen and as he was
[1:06:29] listening listening to the service from
[1:06:32] Sunday faith just come in as hard as we
[1:06:35] prayed and his fever left him and he's
[1:06:38] been fever free since that time because
[1:06:41] the word went forth and healed him hey
[1:06:45] man remember his wife there's was was
[1:06:48] going to be having a very important
[1:06:50] surgery and was scheduled for surgeon
[1:06:53] but can't have it because of because of
[1:06:55] the cove at nineteen but yeah but let me
[1:06:59] say as we talk about this as we hear so
[1:07:02] many with cancer cancer brother Adam
[1:07:05] said it is nothing to Jesus Christ no
[1:07:11] more than I headache a man so I'll
[1:07:15] brother Tim you don't know how bad my
[1:07:17] headache kids I tell you got to heal
[1:07:19] that headache he'll heal it today we
[1:07:23] don't have to wait for tomorrow and your
[1:07:25] cancer is no more of a problem to God
[1:07:28] and nothing diseases Christ no more than
[1:07:30] a headache man brother Bradley would say
[1:07:34] cancer is no bad thing for God to heal
[1:07:38] cancer is nothing in the presence of God
[1:07:41] God can make all things well a map so he
[1:07:47] said there isn't there more sickness in
[1:07:50] the land today than there's ever been
[1:07:52] now that Great Plague of cancer sweeping
[1:07:55] the nations and Christians are dying by
[1:07:58] it by the thousands and to think at that
[1:08:02] very hour the angel of God came down and
[1:08:05] even specified cancer now understood the
[1:08:11] devil Oh notice a man the angel of God
[1:08:16] that sent this message specified cancer
[1:08:22] that nothing would stand before the
[1:08:26] prayers not even cancer a man brother
[1:08:31] branham would say again let me just read
[1:08:34] another little quote and if you be
[1:08:36] sincere when you pray get them to
[1:08:38] believe you and be sincere when you pray
[1:08:41] nothing shall stand before your prayer
[1:08:43] not even cancer he spoke cancer that's
[1:08:47] the only disease he said but he
[1:08:51] specified cancer I want you to know this
[1:08:56] message has the power against cancer God
[1:09:02] specifically spoke about it because God
[1:09:06] knew that that would be something we
[1:09:09] would come up against and this message
[1:09:12] will defeat it what message the message
[1:09:16] of Jesus Christ that the atonement he
[1:09:19] paid it all and the cancer is defeated
[1:09:22] at Calvary and it has no right to a
[1:09:25] believer now I know there are those who
[1:09:29] want to think that that Zoli
[1:09:31] was spoken only to brother Branham but
[1:09:33] that's a lie of the devil hey man if
[1:09:36] that's true then if that's true in
[1:09:38] cancer is no more to God than a headache
[1:09:40] that we don't even have power against a
[1:09:42] headache Amen Jesus did not designate
[1:09:45] some Devils
[1:09:46] he said that believers would cast out
[1:09:48] Devils in his name ever devil is subject
[1:09:52] to the name of Jesus Christ anytime a
[1:09:55] believer uses his name in faith his word
[1:09:59] said so if you can get them to believe
[1:10:04] hey man now so we believe that Jesus
[1:10:08] Christ died for your sickness and your
[1:10:11] sins and by accepting it on the basis of
[1:10:14] his shed blood you can grow attributes
[1:10:17] from it anything you have need of God
[1:10:19] will give it to you
[1:10:20] now let's understand all of the power of
[1:10:25] God lays in his word and the word has
[1:10:28] specifically spoken against cancer come
[1:10:36] on we've got the written word that
[1:10:38] speaks against it
[1:10:39] in my name you will cast out devils
[1:10:42] we've got the spoken word through a
[1:10:45] prophet that - that spoken come on
[1:10:47] it's the Living Word we got both up we
[1:10:52] got two wings to fly on it the written
[1:10:54] word and the living word man and it can
[1:10:58] lift us above and take us away from any
[1:11:00] kind of disease or affliction that there
[1:11:03] is a mouth I've already told you there
[1:11:09] is a power in this word that will defeat
[1:11:12] even koban 19 stop the fever right in
[1:11:16] his tracks
[1:11:17] hey man it'll stop cancer right in his
[1:11:20] tracks
[1:11:21] and I'll tell you we we have put up with
[1:11:24] the devil long enough it's time for the
[1:11:27] Church of Jesus Christ to stand to his
[1:11:29] feet and to realize we have been given
[1:11:31] authority the word gave us the authority
[1:11:35] and God is no better than his word if
[1:11:38] you don't back his words and God is a
[1:11:40] God he has to give his word now brother
[1:11:46] Branham told us that God's written word
[1:11:48] is no less than God himself you can read
[1:11:54] you know he said you can't rest your
[1:11:58] faith as I say just upon anything you've
[1:12:02] got to have some basic fact and that's
[1:12:05] the reason I can rest my faith upon this
[1:12:07] word because I believe it to be the Word
[1:12:10] of God and then if it is the Word of God
[1:12:12] it is God himself in word
[1:12:16] form that's right and then if that's God
[1:12:19] himself
[1:12:20] and no man is better than his word if I
[1:12:22] write a declaration here of something
[1:12:25] that I'll do and now I'm no better than
[1:12:27] that word is and that word is a part of
[1:12:29] me it's my word and if this is God's
[1:12:32] written word it can't be no less than
[1:12:35] God himself because he's obligated to
[1:12:38] his word now you believe that now again
[1:12:41] there it is his written word is God
[1:12:45] himself when you take that in you are
[1:12:50] taking Claudia you're taking the power
[1:12:53] of that in when you speak it out you are
[1:12:56] releasing the power of that word now
[1:13:00] again I read this and last Sunday but
[1:13:02] listen he said let's just believe him
[1:13:05] that's the death stroke to Satan when a
[1:13:08] man takes God in his word brother data
[1:13:11] killed Satan every time that is the
[1:13:14] hardest ship that Satan can get when a
[1:13:18] man will take God at His Word
[1:13:21] hey ma'am yes sir jesus said a man shall
[1:13:25] not live by bread alone but every word
[1:13:28] that proceedeth out of the mouth of God
[1:13:29] we are to live we have life by that word
[1:13:34] now we know that that the battle that
[1:13:39] we're having here on earth the first
[1:13:42] battle was ever fought was fought in the
[1:13:45] heavens Michael and his angels against
[1:13:49] Lucifer Nate and they had Lucifer and
[1:13:51] his angels were kicked out of heaven
[1:13:53] then that great army of the devils and
[1:13:57] all of his imps fell to the earth now
[1:14:01] God knew there would be a battle he
[1:14:03] knows him from the beginning he knew he
[1:14:06] knows everything that would be ever not
[1:14:08] that would Betty sire how many I must
[1:14:11] tell her that to have them all together
[1:14:12] that they would make but the first thing
[1:14:15] that Satan did was to come to Eve and
[1:14:18] try to get her to doubt God's Word he he
[1:14:23] reasons say
[1:14:24] yay has God said and he begin to reason
[1:14:30] and when he broke down that barrier from
[1:14:34] words he was isolated and hidden behind
[1:14:37] the word from that moment on Satan won
[1:14:41] the battle of over over God's people
[1:14:45] because one of his subjects let the
[1:14:49] weaker one let down the power right Amen
[1:14:53] God and fortified her with the word and
[1:14:56] let me tell you today it is that still
[1:14:58] the best weapon we got against the enemy
[1:15:03] is the Word of God there is no greater
[1:15:06] weapon then it is written hey man now
[1:15:14] so you see godless God would choose for
[1:15:18] his army the best weapon that could be
[1:15:22] given he chose it and he said it's my
[1:15:25] word my word is the best weapon and he
[1:15:29] gave his army the best equipment now God
[1:15:33] can't improve right he can't change he
[1:15:37] can't change his mind he can't he can't
[1:15:40] improve on what he does so he gave the
[1:15:42] best to start with now no matter how
[1:15:46] many things Satan's get and the N or how
[1:15:49] many things that other army gets Satan's
[1:15:51] army it can never nothing will change
[1:15:55] God's Word is still God's first choice
[1:15:59] to to defeat the devil with a man now
[1:16:05] gifts do not defeat the devil brother
[1:16:10] branham's gift did not defeat the devil
[1:16:12] the word defeated the devil a man
[1:16:16] whether you've got the people to believe
[1:16:17] in the word that's when the devil was
[1:16:20] defeated if we can get the Bride of
[1:16:22] Christ to believe in the word that was
[1:16:25] over and over and over proved and
[1:16:27] vindicated that's when she'll start
[1:16:30] defeating Devils which he'll start
[1:16:33] taking the word
[1:16:35] and confessing that and believe in that
[1:16:37] now using it against the devil
[1:16:40] now so again but you see what the devil
[1:16:44] does is try to get you to disbelieve
[1:16:47] your weapon to believe that it's not
[1:16:51] gonna work he'll talk you out of firing
[1:16:55] your gun he'll talk you into lay him
[1:17:00] down your weapon if he can take it
[1:17:02] without a shot he's going to do it but
[1:17:06] again I want you to get the picture
[1:17:09] if you believe if he gets you to believe
[1:17:11] that your weapon is not strong enough
[1:17:13] he's got you disarmed hey man where you
[1:17:18] know he can get you to just believe the
[1:17:21] word that's your weapon he has you
[1:17:24] defeated and this is why so many are
[1:17:28] living a life of defeat it's because
[1:17:32] their faith isn't myth their faith is
[1:17:36] even in a prophet but their faith is not
[1:17:39] in the word now brother Branham held up
[1:17:46] his Bible like this and he says this is
[1:17:51] God's voice to the people every word of
[1:17:57] God is a seed and it will produce just
[1:18:00] exactly like it spoke in the Bible if
[1:18:03] it's receiving good ground now
[1:18:06] that's God's voice to his church right
[1:18:11] here we've already got it's not coming
[1:18:15] we already have this is God's voice to
[1:18:19] the church hey man just say it is
[1:18:22] written Satan here it is written that
[1:18:25] does it you know because the Word of God
[1:18:29] will defeat Satan anywhere anytime
[1:18:33] anyplace
[1:18:34] amen the written word will defeat him
[1:18:37] and Jesus defeated Satan by the written
[1:18:43] word
[1:18:44] it is written and what he did that far
[1:18:49] he didn't use his gifts he didn't use
[1:18:52] his power come on he used the word and
[1:18:56] he did it so that that brings it to the
[1:19:00] smallest weakest baby Christian a man no
[1:19:06] matter how small or how little you are
[1:19:09] you can say it is written is that right
[1:19:15] hey man and I'll tell you when he when
[1:19:17] he come here Satan comes Eddie you know
[1:19:20] and he said it is written he tries again
[1:19:23] Cecil stays with the word he tries again
[1:19:26] Jesus faced with the word it is written
[1:19:28] it is written as is written hey man he
[1:19:32] said Satan got enough of that when he
[1:19:34] kept pouring a word into him
[1:19:36] just kept pouring the word into him and
[1:19:38] that's that's what you gotta do is you
[1:19:40] gotta just keep pouring the word into
[1:19:42] him every time the devil comes in
[1:19:44] another way you pour another scripture
[1:19:46] into him you just tell him again lame
[1:19:49] hear the word because the word will
[1:19:53] defeat him a man now when Jesus was here
[1:19:58] in the fullness of the Godhead bodily
[1:20:01] you know where when he met the devil as
[1:20:04] we said he never used cinemas powers yet
[1:20:08] the father's never spoke anything
[1:20:10] through him but he never used it he used
[1:20:14] the father's written word and he never
[1:20:16] used his power but he used God's word it
[1:20:20] is written man shall not live by bread
[1:20:22] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[1:20:24] out of the mouth of God see he defeated
[1:20:27] the devil on the father's word and he
[1:20:29] said let me say this now that the Word
[1:20:31] of God would have beat Satan the devil
[1:20:33] any time anywhere or any place he'll
[1:20:37] defeat the devil and the right mizzle
[1:20:40] attitude towards any divine promise of
[1:20:44] God will bring it to pass if you can
[1:20:48] look at it the way God wrote it and
[1:20:50] accept it in your heart God will make
[1:20:53] that word become life
[1:20:56] so now again the right mental attitude
[1:21:00] it's important that you give your
[1:21:03] attitude toward the promise right
[1:21:07] because Satan is gonna come and try to
[1:21:09] make you think oh it's just something
[1:21:11] wrote for thousands of years ago it's
[1:21:14] not for me it is for you
[1:21:17] a man it's written specifically for this
[1:21:21] day for this time Jesus wouldn't look in
[1:21:24] the scripture and his timing to say it's
[1:21:26] written at me and this is exactly what
[1:21:30] we do is a word bride in this thing we
[1:21:32] must look in the word and say it's
[1:21:34] written of me the Bible said this about
[1:21:37] me this is my word not a word of dare to
[1:21:41] go back but I'm the fulfillment of all
[1:21:44] the word amen now so again that right
[1:21:48] mental attitude toward any promise will
[1:21:50] bring it to pass
[1:21:51] now brother Branham said on the
[1:21:53] authority of God's although Jesus on the
[1:21:55] authority in the word he said every word
[1:21:57] of God is a written sworn Authority if
[1:22:01] the absolute right of the believer to
[1:22:04] accept this as infallible proof am an
[1:22:09] infallible truth because it is God's
[1:22:11] Word heaven and earth will pass away now
[1:22:13] we can only give the bride in the same
[1:22:18] mind an attitude toward the word that
[1:22:23] Jesus had amen
[1:22:26] look God did extreme things in our
[1:22:32] generation to get us to believe the word
[1:22:35] again look the denomination said it
[1:22:39] wouldn't work days of miracles are past
[1:22:42] God doesn't heal anymore
[1:22:45] come on is that what the church world
[1:22:48] was saying okay and the church was
[1:22:50] believing that is that right but God did
[1:22:55] extreme things to get us to believe the
[1:22:58] world that the word he is here
[1:23:03] a man in the form of the Holy Ghost and
[1:23:07] he would vindicate his word improved his
[1:23:09] work and he sued us over and over and
[1:23:13] over that the word will work it will
[1:23:17] heal it will raise up cripples
[1:23:20] a man it will make the blind to see it
[1:23:24] will open the ears of the death it will
[1:23:27] make Devils of all kinds to flee a man
[1:23:31] and even brother Brennan said cancers he
[1:23:33] said that meant more cancers healed
[1:23:35] under my ministry than any other disease
[1:23:39] why because God was showing us that you
[1:23:42] can defeat Satan with the word at
[1:23:45] anytime anyplace and anywhere under any
[1:23:50] conditions is that right a man now now
[1:23:57] God would actually discern the thoughts
[1:24:00] and intents of the heart
[1:24:02] using a prophetic gift now who else
[1:24:06] could do that who else could do that but
[1:24:10] the word is self Hebrews 4:12 the Word
[1:24:14] of God is quick
[1:24:15] that means it's alive somebody catch
[1:24:19] that the word is alive and it is
[1:24:23] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[1:24:27] sword piercing to even to the binder the
[1:24:30] dividing asunder of the soul and spirit
[1:24:32] and of the joints and marrow and is a
[1:24:35] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:24:37] heart so what we saw was the word the
[1:24:41] logos the Holy Ghost at work discerning
[1:24:46] hearts well I knew that myself when I
[1:24:50] was a little boy and sat there listening
[1:24:52] brother branham and saw him discern the
[1:24:54] hearts I knew that men couldn't do that
[1:24:56] I knew there had to be somebody else
[1:24:59] present no matter I had that much
[1:25:02] understanding as eleven-year-old boy
[1:25:04] what are we understand today he was
[1:25:07] showing us the word was present it knows
[1:25:11] you your name
[1:25:13] your address what the doctor said
[1:25:17] demo hey man what's gonna happen if he
[1:25:20] knows you pass he knows your future
[1:25:23] isn't right it was the word it was
[1:25:26] performing where it was said to it meant
[1:25:29] for the word is full of power the word
[1:25:34] opened the eyes of the blind time to
[1:25:37] show you what the work did the word
[1:25:39] healed the sick the word raised the dead
[1:25:44] the word casts out Devils the word went
[1:25:49] forth and healed them the Bible said he
[1:25:53] sipped his word and healed him He healed
[1:25:56] him by the word amen now it's the word
[1:26:03] performing wherever said to listen I
[1:26:08] know every time that I have prayed for
[1:26:10] anybody it wasn't anything that I did it
[1:26:14] wasn't my hands it wasn't the way I laid
[1:26:17] my hands it wasn't something I reached
[1:26:19] him there and pull out the sickness or
[1:26:21] or this disease or or did anything I
[1:26:24] didn't do anything but speak and it was
[1:26:28] the word that cast out the devil it was
[1:26:32] the word that healed the sick and I'm
[1:26:35] trying to show you the power of the word
[1:26:38] in the word there is power to heal to
[1:26:41] deliver to set free and what God was
[1:26:44] doing was showing us his word is present
[1:26:48] because he would come a time with
[1:26:51] brother Branham wouldn't be present but
[1:26:54] the word still present hallelujah now
[1:26:58] gonna make a shout today - no we're not
[1:27:01] here left alone during this time hey man
[1:27:04] we've got the word and the word was cats
[1:27:07] out Devils it rebuke Satan he be
[1:27:11] overcome in power he will heal the sick
[1:27:14] it will rebuke cancers by the word
[1:27:21] now is the word perform him where it was
[1:27:24] said to do for the word is full of power
[1:27:27] it's the same spirit that was in Jesus
[1:27:30] the word that is present again in the
[1:27:35] church in this last age oh listen to
[1:27:38] that I'm reading from the church age
[1:27:40] book let me just back up again so you
[1:27:43] catch it I want you to hear the using
[1:27:46] the authority of a prophet speaking it
[1:27:48] is the word it is performing wearing -
[1:27:51] it is sent for it is a word is full of
[1:27:55] power it is the same spirit that was in
[1:27:59] Jesus the word that is present again in
[1:28:03] the church in this last age as a last
[1:28:07] sign trying to head people off from
[1:28:10] gentlemen for they that reject him the
[1:28:12] word are already come into the gentlemen
[1:28:14] crucifying him afresh so I want you to
[1:28:17] understand this isn't sucker what the
[1:28:20] discernment was far it was to show us
[1:28:22] Christ is present he is here what forms
[1:28:27] here in His Holy Spirit which is the
[1:28:29] word am the beginning wants to learn the
[1:28:31] Word was God
[1:28:32] his Holy Spirit not God
[1:28:35] yes it's God so the word is here in the
[1:28:39] form of the Holy Spirit is that right
[1:28:42] and he's here
[1:28:43] dwelling in human vessels the word made
[1:28:47] flesh again the word in his people
[1:28:50] Christ in you the hope of glory now you
[1:28:55] know you see people are looking for a
[1:29:00] savior for Messiah and brother branham
[1:29:05] would say this about this since the
[1:29:07] world as he said the world is falling
[1:29:09] apart he said what kind of what about
[1:29:12] the church what kind of Messiah is the
[1:29:15] church looking for today you the
[1:29:17] churches tried that the loudest we're
[1:29:19] humming about a messiah
[1:29:21] what are we hollered revival in our time
[1:29:23] back this that of the other what are
[1:29:26] they looking for to do it what more
[1:29:28] do you want what does the church want
[1:29:32] anyhow we've already got it who God gave
[1:29:39] it to us is his promise for this hour
[1:29:42] and we look in the Bible and we see
[1:29:44] everywhere to the Bible anointed ones
[1:29:46] came on to men made that word live again
[1:29:49] right in the hour for that hour and
[1:29:51] we've got the Messiah this is him the
[1:29:55] world in the beginning was the word the
[1:29:58] Word was with God the Word was God in
[1:30:00] the word remains God Hebrews 13 and 8
[1:30:03] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:30:05] we know what's supposed to take place in
[1:30:07] this day and we're one in Messiah and
[1:30:10] God gave us the Messiah his promised
[1:30:13] word for this day it's just waiting for
[1:30:18] somebody with faith to ignore Nick and
[1:30:22] make it live again hallelujah so we've
[1:30:27] already got it looking for somebody to
[1:30:30] rise up some great Messiah somebody the
[1:30:33] word is here and that's what we was
[1:30:36] pointed to is back to the world back to
[1:30:40] the scripture back to the Bible he said
[1:30:43] but the church sits spiritually dead
[1:30:46] gone the hours passed them they're in a
[1:30:49] slump they hardly know what to do one
[1:30:51] run this way and one that way and here
[1:30:54] every promise that God made in the Bible
[1:30:56] every one of us lay in here they're just
[1:30:59] as good as they ever was this hour what
[1:31:01] makes the church like this we're in the
[1:31:03] age of Laodicea when she has to come
[1:31:06] this way this is the hour for it so
[1:31:11] Laodicea calls his people to what a man
[1:31:15] to be slothful and meant to fail to
[1:31:18] recognize their day and now what God did
[1:31:21] for us he restored back to us the word
[1:31:25] yeah we had a Bible but but we was
[1:31:28] covered with men's theology Amen but God
[1:31:32] restored us back to what Paul preached
[1:31:35] I'm and so therefore we should look
[1:31:37] exactly in this work in this work than
[1:31:40] his healing deliverance salvation
[1:31:43] everything now notice brother madam said
[1:31:46] again that these signs of wonders of so
[1:31:49] in the past future what should be and
[1:31:51] what has been and all about was a
[1:31:53] vindication of the approaching Messiah
[1:31:57] don't we realize what the sign was about
[1:32:00] don't we realize what the the gift of
[1:32:03] discernment was about it was to show us
[1:32:06] the word is here that this is the word
[1:32:11] that this word will defeat your enemy we
[1:32:15] don't have to look for another message
[1:32:18] if we can get the people to believe the
[1:32:22] message the message of the atonement the
[1:32:27] message that our debt is free I'm Anna
[1:32:30] paid for I meant that the message that
[1:32:34] we don't have to be sick anymore that is
[1:32:36] a healer of our disease and we can get
[1:32:38] the people to believe it he's waiting
[1:32:42] for somebody with faith to anoint it and
[1:32:46] make it live again are you with me now
[1:32:51] now so again brother Branham would tell
[1:32:56] us about that sign he says I challenge
[1:32:59] you to believe this is in the trial
[1:33:02] I challenge you to believe that Jesus
[1:33:06] Christ is revealed in the form of sin a
[1:33:09] man in human flesh through the bride's
[1:33:12] body I challenge you to believe that
[1:33:18] amen
[1:33:21] you know the devil wants to get us to
[1:33:24] stop with it with something go by and we
[1:33:32] can have faith that the Son of Man was
[1:33:34] revealed through the Prophet but let's
[1:33:38] take it a little further and realize it
[1:33:41] wasn't about a prophet
[1:33:44] it was about a bride that was the whole
[1:33:49] purpose of the message it was not it was
[1:33:51] not together
[1:33:52] just send the Prophet it was to call out
[1:33:55] a bride in this evening time of people
[1:33:59] who would believe the word now so he
[1:34:04] said I challenge you to believe that
[1:34:07] Jesus Christ is revealed and former
[1:34:09] southern man in human flesh through the
[1:34:11] bride's body because that's where is
[1:34:15] being revealed now the word is being
[1:34:18] revealed in human flesh
[1:34:23] now let me share this from you with you
[1:34:27] from patmans vision Paul said that the
[1:34:30] word came in power as well as voice that
[1:34:34] is stuff a minute how did the message
[1:34:37] come to us it didn't wait wasn't just
[1:34:40] voice come on it came in power the word
[1:34:44] preached actually demonstrated itself
[1:34:48] now that's two doctrine true doctrine is
[1:34:52] different from the doctrine of Pharisees
[1:34:53] the true word will cast out Satan it
[1:34:58] will heal the sick it will feel with the
[1:35:01] Holy Ghost it will give them something
[1:35:03] more than psychology but to give them a
[1:35:06] power to live and overcome in life are
[1:35:11] you with me so again the word preached
[1:35:14] actually demonstrated itself like a
[1:35:17] flame and cutting sword it went into the
[1:35:19] consciousness of man like a surgeon's
[1:35:22] knife it cut out diseases it's set the
[1:35:25] captive free everywhere those are early
[1:35:27] believers when they went preaching the
[1:35:29] gospel the word and God confirmed the
[1:35:32] word with signs following
[1:35:34] the sick were healed the devils were
[1:35:37] cast out they spoke in new tongues that
[1:35:39] was the word in action the word has
[1:35:45] never failed in the mouths of believing
[1:35:49] Christians
[1:35:50] and in this last age are you ready for
[1:35:54] this it is here stronger and greater
[1:35:58] than ever in the true word pride
[1:36:03] hallelujah the word in action the word
[1:36:07] has never failed in the mouths of
[1:36:10] believing Christians this last sage it
[1:36:13] is stronger it is here stronger and
[1:36:15] greater than ever in the two word bride
[1:36:19] Oh little flock you little minority hold
[1:36:22] on to the word till your mouth and heart
[1:36:24] with it and someday God will give you
[1:36:26] the kingdom hey Matt
[1:36:29] now this feel your heart with you got to
[1:36:31] feel your mouth with it
[1:36:32] now listen brother madam said in the
[1:36:35] pergamene church shades again believe us
[1:36:38] he said when Jesus was on the earth he
[1:36:39] said believe us not that I am in the
[1:36:42] father that bothered me the words that I
[1:36:44] speak to you I speak not of myself but
[1:36:47] the father that dwelleth in me he doeth
[1:36:49] the works john 14:10 but here is most
[1:36:54] evidently set forth the perfect
[1:36:56] manifestation of God in the son was by
[1:37:00] the indwelling spirit manifest an inward
[1:37:03] and works notices and that's exactly
[1:37:08] what we've been teaching all along when
[1:37:10] the bride will get back to being a word
[1:37:13] bride she will produce the very works
[1:37:18] that Jesus produced the word is God and
[1:37:23] the Spirit is God they're all one one
[1:37:25] can't work apart from the other and if
[1:37:28] one has truly the Spirit of God he'll
[1:37:30] have the Word of God that right let's
[1:37:33] bear olestra let's try the other way cuz
[1:37:36] he said it won't work apart from the
[1:37:38] other so what truly has the Word of God
[1:37:40] he'll have the Spirit of God if one has
[1:37:42] the Spirit of God he'll add the Word of
[1:37:44] God is that right that's how it was for
[1:37:46] the prophets they had the indwelling
[1:37:48] Spirit of God though the word though the
[1:37:53] word came to them but how it how it was
[1:37:55] with Jesus in him with the spirit
[1:37:58] without measure and the word came to him
[1:38:00] and Jesus began to both do
[1:38:03] tshh said my doctor is not my own but
[1:38:08] the fathers had sent me now so how are
[1:38:11] we gonna have a pure word bride again if
[1:38:15] we water it down with and hybrid with
[1:38:18] creeds and dogmas to the Asians that's
[1:38:21] what God without the sieve of message of
[1:38:23] restoration and the restoration was a
[1:38:27] restoration of the word but with the
[1:38:30] restoration of the word comes a
[1:38:32] restoration at the power that's how you
[1:38:35] know it's the word hey man I mean we're
[1:38:41] we're calling things today the word and
[1:38:43] there's no power with it we're calling
[1:38:47] it we got the to word and there's
[1:38:49] nothing to heal the sick
[1:38:51] there's not even altar calls there's not
[1:38:55] even prayer lines there's no there's no
[1:38:58] real cry out into the spirit there's
[1:39:00] nothing oh we got the word that word
[1:39:03] isn't person it's not a philosophy and
[1:39:08] when you have the word of Christ you
[1:39:10] have the works of Christ you cannot have
[1:39:12] one without the other
[1:39:13] so a church without the word and you
[1:39:17] know will will be a powerless Church but
[1:39:20] the word the church is claiming to have
[1:39:22] the word and no power are no science no
[1:39:25] wonder they are also at powerless
[1:39:27] fruitless Church they're not the pratik
[1:39:29] Christ the Bride of Christ has both are
[1:39:34] you with me now so again this this is
[1:39:37] what God promised that he would again to
[1:39:40] bring them bring it back he would bring
[1:39:42] back the power of infallibility so
[1:39:47] they're showing us that it was Word how
[1:39:49] many times did that give fail now
[1:39:53] because it was the word and the word is
[1:39:57] always right
[1:39:58] is that right so to prove it was the
[1:40:02] word it never failed it was over and
[1:40:06] over and over it was the power of
[1:40:07] infallible
[1:40:09] not the brother branham was infallible
[1:40:12] but that we have the infallible Word of
[1:40:15] God again as it was perfectly given and
[1:40:18] perfectly understood in the days of Paul
[1:40:21] and that means that the church started
[1:40:23] with the pure word and it ends with the
[1:40:26] same pure word amen
[1:40:31] that means we have the same atonement
[1:40:33] that Jesus is our mediator
[1:40:36] he is our intercessor we have the same
[1:40:39] signs with the same Holy Ghost with the
[1:40:41] same signs and wonders are you with me
[1:40:44] amen so so again we we remember then
[1:40:49] that God sends a prophet in this day to
[1:40:52] do what bring us back to the word again
[1:40:55] he would tell us it's the word looking
[1:40:58] through the word I'm not pointing to
[1:41:00] myself it's not me I'm pointing to is so
[1:41:04] worried I'm pointing to but we had too
[1:41:07] many people that ran after the man and
[1:41:09] send us the message now so brother
[1:41:15] Brennan said they will hear him as the
[1:41:18] first church heard Paul and she will
[1:41:20] mature in the word until becoming a word
[1:41:23] bride that the mighty works will be
[1:41:26] found in her there always attended upon
[1:41:29] the pure word in faith a math now that's
[1:41:34] true because true doctor is his word
[1:41:39] with power Jesus doctor
[1:41:43] astonished him so again we cannot just
[1:41:47] have the word only we must have the word
[1:41:50] empowered not you know this is this is
[1:41:53] why Jesus had faith with his power
[1:41:57] brother Branham would tell us this in
[1:42:00] perfect faith he says I can do nothing
[1:42:02] in myself we all realize that we realize
[1:42:06] as human being we're just as totally
[1:42:08] helpless as helpless can be we can do
[1:42:12] nothing in ourselves but he relied in
[1:42:15] knowing that he was the word
[1:42:22] hey ma'am and he had faith in God who
[1:42:26] made him the word I didn't make myself
[1:42:29] or she made me the word have you that
[1:42:33] filling me with the Holy Ghost then I
[1:42:35] became the Word of God made flesh is
[1:42:39] that right the word the Holy Spirit
[1:42:42] living in mid-may flesh o'clock
[1:42:44] Tabernacle in a human vessel so we rely
[1:42:48] upon that we are the word
[1:42:53] hey man no words the devil left hey man
[1:42:57] come on because the words come defeat
[1:42:59] the devil any place anywhere any time
[1:43:01] and this bride is not leaving out of
[1:43:03] here defeated she's gonna be a
[1:43:06] victorious Church he had faith in God
[1:43:09] who made him the word that's why I
[1:43:11] prayed lace we're not laying I can in
[1:43:14] myself do nothing I'm not I'm not even
[1:43:16] looking at myself I'm looking at what he
[1:43:18] made me I know I can do all things I can
[1:43:23] overcome I can rise up above come on
[1:43:26] hey man she had faith in God who made
[1:43:29] him the word he was God the word and
[1:43:32] that gave him faith cause he understood
[1:43:34] his position now understand you and have
[1:43:38] faith you've got to have faith in your
[1:43:40] position what the word said you are if
[1:43:45] he said I'm a son I'm a son I have a
[1:43:52] right right to whatever divine promise I
[1:43:57] have a right to healing I'm an heir I
[1:44:00] have a right to salvation I'm an heir I
[1:44:03] have a right to the Holy Ghost I'm an
[1:44:06] heir I have a right to whatever I need
[1:44:09] I'm an heir is that right Amen he
[1:44:14] understood his position is really really
[1:44:18] important that you when you meet the
[1:44:22] devil that you position yourself first
[1:44:25] Who am I
[1:44:27] I'm a son of God
[1:44:30] how did I get to be this way not by my
[1:44:32] own choice he birthed me into the
[1:44:34] kingdom hey man I was born not of the
[1:44:38] will of man that's even my own will or
[1:44:40] the will of the flesh but of God and he
[1:44:44] gave me power to are the authority to
[1:44:47] become a son by birth is that right
[1:44:50] and by birth I am a son and that's the
[1:44:53] Sun I am heir with him and as an heir
[1:44:55] with him he gives me authority and with
[1:44:57] that authority
[1:44:58] I cast Satan out hey Matt so what gave
[1:45:06] him faith was cause he understood his
[1:45:09] position he knew what he wants why cuz
[1:45:14] he was feeling particularly that day
[1:45:17] really strong now the reason he knew
[1:45:21] what he was cuz the scripture said he
[1:45:23] was this so you go looking into the
[1:45:28] scripture to see what it said about you
[1:45:31] it said I can do all things through
[1:45:35] Christ that's treated me it says no good
[1:45:39] thing when he withhold from them that
[1:45:41] walk uprightly oh we fell right then
[1:45:43] because we're not been walking uprightly
[1:45:46] good enough hunk who can walk good
[1:45:48] enough book them who can do that I can
[1:45:51] because my mistakes are covered in the
[1:45:54] blood so therefore I'm a blood washed
[1:45:56] blood box of the daughter of God come on
[1:45:59] and I take my position and I understand
[1:46:02] my position base of the authority I thus
[1:46:05] sayeth the Lord God said it a man he
[1:46:11] knew what he was because the scripture
[1:46:13] said he was this here ever scripture
[1:46:16] tidy and to prove he was exactly what
[1:46:19] the scripture said he would be and he
[1:46:22] knew what he was now listen Church this
[1:46:25] is how Jesus knew who he was somebody
[1:46:32] help me
[1:46:35] make the connection because we think
[1:46:39] well Jesus knew he was because while he
[1:46:42] was just born knowing and he just
[1:46:44] listened he had ever voice against him
[1:46:48] he had the adversary whispered in his
[1:46:51] ears he can look and see his own
[1:46:53] humanity come on hey man he are you with
[1:46:58] me Church hey man he had to look in the
[1:47:01] word to see what the word said about him
[1:47:05] I don't know what you reading your Bible
[1:47:09] for but if you are reading it you need
[1:47:10] to be looking to see what did God say
[1:47:12] about me
[1:47:13] this was said of me it is written to me
[1:47:19] hey man you so while it was written of
[1:47:23] David yeah it was wrote of David - but
[1:47:25] but he was speaking of a greater purpose
[1:47:29] and this is what Jesus could look at he
[1:47:33] could look back and see the very Psalms
[1:47:35] of David and he said David got in the
[1:47:37] spirit of Who I am and he began to speak
[1:47:43] things concerning me my bones they stare
[1:47:46] at me right he can say they'll not leave
[1:47:50] my soul in Hell neither will he left my
[1:47:52] Holy One see corruption any new I raised
[1:47:54] in three days why because the word said
[1:47:59] he would hey man now Jesus knew who he
[1:48:06] was it didn't matter how he was feeling
[1:48:09] today whether he was on Mount
[1:48:11] Transfiguration or whether he's in the
[1:48:13] wilderness of temptation would ever
[1:48:15] devil breathing down his neck he knew
[1:48:17] who he was a man and if he was in the
[1:48:21] area if he was in a boat about to be
[1:48:23] sunk or if he was standing before
[1:48:25] thousands of demons that were in the man
[1:48:27] screaming at him hey man
[1:48:31] Jesus knew who he was
[1:48:33] now you've got to know who you are
[1:48:36] because you're facing some of the same
[1:48:38] things demons screaming at you ever
[1:48:42] voice of Satan hey man do the ways that
[1:48:45] are coming back to seek your little boat
[1:48:47] hey man every kind of problem that there
[1:48:51] is and there may be high points in your
[1:48:53] life or you're on a long amount of of
[1:48:56] change or or you're down in the
[1:48:58] wilderness of temptation matters not
[1:49:00] you've got to know who you are
[1:49:03] and you know who you are because what
[1:49:07] the word said brother Brennan said he
[1:49:09] relied upon what God had made him this
[1:49:15] is this is what I do ever 10 that I face
[1:49:18] a demon spirit the first thing I do is I
[1:49:20] said well I'm a son of God hey man I was
[1:49:25] commissioned to cast his devil out so I
[1:49:27] know it's gonna go because I've been
[1:49:30] getting an authority over I'm not its
[1:49:32] servant it's my servant it's got to do
[1:49:34] what I say if I say go is gotta go if I
[1:49:37] say you're bound you're bound amen what
[1:49:41] because you know what God made you as a
[1:49:44] son and he did that he said did can't we
[1:49:50] rely about what God made us as believers
[1:49:53] these signs shall follow them that
[1:49:56] believe he had faith in what he was and
[1:50:00] if you're a believer you have faith and
[1:50:02] what you are you are a believer hey man
[1:50:10] it's not the right that's it that's
[1:50:12] exactly the way we were when we were in
[1:50:13] the hospital with with my wife with a
[1:50:16] brain bleed it was very dire news news
[1:50:19] but I stood there with my children and I
[1:50:22] said your mother's laying there in the
[1:50:25] ICU room but I said we're not gonna
[1:50:27] worry and we're not gonna fret we're
[1:50:30] gonna believe because that's what we do
[1:50:33] we are believers
[1:50:36] and believers believe a man a man
[1:50:41] believers believe and I said so this is
[1:50:44] what we have been trained for this
[1:50:46] moment and we are going to believe and I
[1:50:51] want you to know this is what all the
[1:50:52] training has been all the study of the
[1:50:56] message is to get you to believe and we
[1:50:59] have been trained to believe no matter
[1:51:02] what is happening we're going to believe
[1:51:05] because when we believe all things are
[1:51:08] possible when we believe Satan's gotta
[1:51:10] go when we believe the word the work
[1:51:14] amen and the word will not work for an
[1:51:16] unbeliever the word works for believers
[1:51:19] hey man these sons who followed them
[1:51:23] that believe but he said and he said he
[1:51:26] relied Jesus relied on what God had made
[1:51:29] him and if he did that then can't we
[1:51:32] rely upon what God made us s believers
[1:51:37] these signs shall follow them to believe
[1:51:40] he had faith in what he was and if
[1:51:43] you're believer you have faith in what
[1:51:49] you are you are a believer now it's good
[1:52:01] to have faith in Jesus certainly we do
[1:52:05] we have faith that his atonement is true
[1:52:09] come on
[1:52:10] we have faith and believe that he casts
[1:52:14] out Devils
[1:52:15] then he healed the sick is that right we
[1:52:19] have faith in who he was but we gotta
[1:52:22] bring in another step further that just
[1:52:25] who he was
[1:52:26] we gotta believe who we are
[1:52:30] and we are believer and as a believer I
[1:52:34] have certain rights and I have certain
[1:52:37] Authority and I have certain powers and
[1:52:41] I put base in my my authority on the
[1:52:44] word the word said on this the word said
[1:52:49] you shall receive power after the Holy
[1:52:51] Ghost is come upon you while the Holy
[1:52:54] Ghost came upon you
[1:52:55] I have the power a man the word said in
[1:52:59] my name you will cast up Devils well I
[1:53:01] can use his name might have the
[1:53:03] authority to use his name these signs
[1:53:06] have followed them that believe I am a
[1:53:08] believer how do I know I'm a believer
[1:53:10] because the Holy Ghost came upon me if I
[1:53:12] wasn't a believer the Holy Ghost
[1:53:13] wouldn't come on me so therefore I'm a
[1:53:19] son and as a son I think my authority I
[1:53:22] think my place I take my position now
[1:53:25] the only thing you have to do then is
[1:53:28] have faith and what you are listen these
[1:53:35] words these words are this was these
[1:53:38] words will really give you some real
[1:53:41] authority and power and and give you a
[1:53:44] freedom like you never don't did he said
[1:53:47] for the only things you have to do then
[1:53:49] is how faith in what you are have faith
[1:53:55] listen now and what the word said you
[1:53:59] are you say what brother Tim you know
[1:54:04] that's the problem I have faith in what
[1:54:06] I am you know
[1:54:07] imabelle you're looking at your human
[1:54:10] side
[1:54:11] look at your new birth what did he make
[1:54:16] you as a son or daughter of God he made
[1:54:19] you an heir he made you an overcomer
[1:54:22] he made you powerful he made you where
[1:54:27] you can cast out Devils you can speak
[1:54:31] with new tongues will you can bind ever
[1:54:35] demon power it's underneath you it's
[1:54:38] as your servant it's your slave that
[1:54:42] devil is your slave I know those are big
[1:54:45] words to say but I'm saying it anyway
[1:54:47] the devil is your slave you have a right
[1:54:51] to tell him he does not have a right to
[1:54:54] tell you hey man have faith in what the
[1:55:00] word said you are Jesus had faith in the
[1:55:04] Word of God that's what he was it was
[1:55:07] written it is written of me that's what
[1:55:11] he was it's written to me didn't didn't
[1:55:14] David in the Psalms and the prophets all
[1:55:16] speak of them of him I am the bread of
[1:55:19] life that came from God out of heaven he
[1:55:23] could look back and see the manna and he
[1:55:25] said that was me he looked at the rock
[1:55:28] where water come out that was me he can
[1:55:30] look at the tree that that made the
[1:55:32] better water sweet that was me
[1:55:35] come on he can look at back and he could
[1:55:38] see everything in the word and he said
[1:55:40] that's me and that's what you've got to
[1:55:44] do you've got to look at this word do
[1:55:46] you see yourself E in it that's why that
[1:55:50] story of brother Branham talking about
[1:55:52] John courts you know where where he
[1:55:55] looked and then into Isaiah 53 and then
[1:55:58] read his name into it he was wounded for
[1:56:01] John courts transgression he was bruised
[1:56:04] for John courts iniquity the
[1:56:06] chastisement of John courts peace was
[1:56:08] upon him and by his flights John was
[1:56:11] healed what was he doing he read his
[1:56:14] name in the scripture and man it said if
[1:56:18] I repent and be baptized in his name I
[1:56:21] received the Holy Ghost the promises to
[1:56:24] me it's for my children it's for even
[1:56:29] those that are far off those in a
[1:56:32] straightaway it's for you too it's for
[1:56:36] as many as the Lord our God shall call
[1:56:38] and you put your name in there
[1:56:41] [Applause]
[1:56:48] it's important it's it's important it is
[1:56:54] as important it's putting Jesus name in
[1:56:59] there now you want to make sure when
[1:57:03] you're baptized you get Jesus name in
[1:57:04] there right you're going to be baptized
[1:57:08] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you
[1:57:12] get your his name in there you know
[1:57:14] that's important it's important just as
[1:57:17] important to put your name in there and
[1:57:23] we get hung up sometimes on just a
[1:57:25] doctrine of things and we don't see the
[1:57:28] application of things you've got to put
[1:57:32] your name in the promise quit putting it
[1:57:35] off for another age and another time and
[1:57:37] other people you're the last you're the
[1:57:40] final voice to the final age there's
[1:57:42] nobody coming after you somebody with me
[1:57:45] amen
[1:57:47] you say he says I am he said he looked
[1:57:50] and he said there are they all spoke of
[1:57:52] it he says I am that tree of life from
[1:57:54] the Garden of Eden I am all these things
[1:57:57] I am that I am he knew that with perfect
[1:58:00] faith that he was anointed Messiah that
[1:58:03] the Spirit of God was upon him and he
[1:58:05] said now in myself I can do nothing but
[1:58:08] my faith is in God and God lives in him
[1:58:12] the word made manifest and when that
[1:58:14] word of God comes into you is made
[1:58:16] manifest for you our believer and the
[1:58:19] unbeliever is the faith of God that
[1:58:21] moves in you so so again he knew who he
[1:58:25] was in the scripture
[1:58:27] so his faith made him act upon the
[1:58:31] scriptures that pertained to his own
[1:58:34] life oh listen brother branham said in
[1:58:37] Christ's a mystery he said if the church
[1:58:41] only knew its position it will one day
[1:58:46] and then the rector will go when it
[1:58:49] knows what it is
[1:58:52] and the whole message was about you it
[1:58:59] was more than guts in a profit but it's
[1:59:03] about you
[1:59:05] hey man it's about God either people
[1:59:09] died in the universe
[1:59:11] God in his son God in his people and
[1:59:15] that's what we gotta see it as God and
[1:59:17] that's Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:59:20] we're here to fulfill what is written
[1:59:23] we'll read this scripture Matthew 5
[1:59:26] verse 17 let's read this and and and
[1:59:30] just read along in this trend
[1:59:33] translation but he said do not think
[1:59:36] I've come to abolish the law or the
[1:59:38] prophets I didn't come to abolish but to
[1:59:42] fulfill for truly I say to you until the
[1:59:46] heavens and earth pass away not the
[1:59:48] smallest letter or stroke shall pass
[1:59:51] from the law until all is accomplished
[1:59:54] whoever then and knows one of the least
[1:59:57] of these Commandments and teaches others
[2:00:00] to do the same to be the least in the
[2:00:02] kingdom shall be called the least in the
[2:00:04] kingdom of heaven but who's whoever
[2:00:06] keeps and teaches them he should be
[2:00:09] called great in the kingdom of heaven so
[2:00:12] now again if we look at Jesus said don't
[2:00:16] think I've come to abolish the law I
[2:00:19] come to fulfill it
[2:00:21] so Jesus didn't abolish or know the law
[2:00:25] or the prophets but to fulfill them he
[2:00:28] was the law the word of the law and the
[2:00:31] prophets made flesh now let me bring it
[2:00:36] down now they're opening of the seals
[2:00:39] made the Bible a new book - brother
[2:00:42] Branham it was not to make the Bible
[2:00:47] obsolete but a new book
[2:00:53] about suing that there is a bride here
[2:00:57] to fulfill what is written you see we
[2:01:02] get the wrong impression with it we we
[2:01:05] begin at noses could it doesn't at all
[2:01:08] the scripture it doesn't abolish the
[2:01:11] scripture if it is there to make the
[2:01:14] book new why new because he was
[2:01:19] cluttered up with every kind of man's
[2:01:21] idea and thinking and man we looked at
[2:01:24] it with theology but God gave us a new
[2:01:27] look afterward a man without the blue
[2:01:32] without the glasses of denomination come
[2:01:35] on a man showing showing us Yunus then
[2:01:39] it is a new book to us it's not an
[2:01:42] obsolete but it's made new - brother
[2:01:49] madam said how can we put our confidence
[2:01:53] in this written word of God because it's
[2:01:55] so inspired and that every phrase of it
[2:01:59] never fades of it hangs together and
[2:02:02] it's drawing a picture for us of God
[2:02:05] what God was and what God he is and
[2:02:08] always will be
[2:02:12] now Jesus was neat when he was here he
[2:02:15] would realize that he was here to
[2:02:18] fulfill the word and that's what we got
[2:02:22] to realize today we are here for the
[2:02:26] fulfillment of it so yes David at his
[2:02:31] part but I'm here to fulfill that part
[2:02:37] David killed Goliath and he was only
[2:02:41] speaking of and given faith for time
[2:02:43] with it men and women with meat their
[2:02:46] own Goliath I prevailed
[2:02:50] what David wrote come on
[2:02:54] Jesus could look and say I am here to
[2:02:57] fulfill to manifest what was typed out
[2:03:01] for me and that's why we are here we are
[2:03:04] here to fulfill what was written of us
[2:03:09] so how are you gonna know what is
[2:03:11] written unless you search the Scriptures
[2:03:13] daily to see what the word said about
[2:03:16] you if you sit go look what the word
[2:03:21] said I am the Lord God that healeth all
[2:03:25] that diseases I will put none of these
[2:03:28] diseases upon you that also speak
[2:03:32] volumes to you right now that the Lord
[2:03:35] has not put this disease upon you the
[2:03:37] devil did and if the devil did it we got
[2:03:40] a right to make him move come on because
[2:03:44] the Lord didn't do it diseases and
[2:03:47] afflictions are at the devil we got as
[2:03:49] much right to tell him to go as Jesus
[2:03:52] did and so Paul did as Peter did come on
[2:03:57] we got as much right to use the word
[2:03:59] because they were only promised sign of
[2:04:03] us Jesus was the manifestation of the
[2:04:10] written word and that's what the bride
[2:04:12] would be if we were bride Devon saith
[2:04:14] why are we letting Satan and his
[2:04:17] sickness rule us even brother Branham
[2:04:22] asks a question if God be with us where
[2:04:25] are his miracles so what is matter you
[2:04:30] know the god of this evil age is fried
[2:04:33] to turn this supernatural gospel this
[2:04:37] endtime message into a powerless
[2:04:40] religion into just an intellectual
[2:04:44] theology oh this is exactly what the god
[2:04:51] of this evil age does listen brother
[2:04:53] madam said this and God to this evil age
[2:04:55] she's caused the whole world to accept
[2:04:57] the scientific leadership of the
[2:05:00] educational program that Satan has given
[2:05:04] her on
[2:05:04] the name of a church the leadership of
[2:05:07] an educational scientific program I'm
[2:05:10] pitching to you that god of this world
[2:05:11] and I'll tell you it describes him many
[2:05:13] many message churches today I an
[2:05:18] educational scientific program turning
[2:05:23] the word into a powerless religion which
[2:05:27] he is Eve had the very feeling of God's
[2:05:30] Word in their hand to do that instead of
[2:05:32] teryan for the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:05:35] let science prove to her that the Holy
[2:05:38] Ghost was only for the disciples instead
[2:05:42] of keeping divine healing going now
[2:05:44] listen would she ought to be now raising
[2:05:48] the dead doing great miracles she has
[2:05:51] let Satan under his leadership a
[2:05:54] religious man take the Word of God and
[2:05:58] try to say it was for another age and
[2:06:01] she's believed it
[2:06:06] well I'll tell you we won't even we
[2:06:08] don't even want to call prayer lines or
[2:06:10] altar calls and deliverance has been
[2:06:13] withheld from the people by a powerless
[2:06:15] theology but we got the seals not
[2:06:19] brother Tim it's a higher knowledge the
[2:06:21] seals only opened us the gospel of Jesus
[2:06:26] Christ is fall priest and it didn't come
[2:06:29] and we're down a and the power was not
[2:06:33] just for the Brotherhood brother Branham
[2:06:35] it was far a word pride hey man oh my
[2:06:41] brother Branham said in the church age
[2:06:43] book and try to wind down and close with
[2:06:46] this the evidence that are receiving the
[2:06:49] Holy Ghost today it's just the same it
[2:06:51] was back in the days of our Lord it's
[2:06:53] receiving the word of truth for the day
[2:06:57] in which you live jesus never did stress
[2:07:00] the importance of works as he did the
[2:07:04] word he knew if the people got the word
[2:07:09] the works would follow
[2:07:12] that is viable so there again we're
[2:07:17] talking about word word word word we got
[2:07:19] the word than words the works because
[2:07:24] it's the true word that works has got to
[2:07:26] follow the word amen again brother
[2:07:30] Branham talked about this in the perk of
[2:07:32] me of age and he said now Jesus knew
[2:07:35] there was gonna be a terrible drift away
[2:07:37] from the word and the permian age which
[2:07:40] Lass's yet two hundred years off from
[2:07:43] the from the Patmos vision he knew that
[2:07:45] terrible the drift that would cause him
[2:07:48] to go into the dark ages he knew that
[2:07:50] the way that man originally got away
[2:07:52] from God was my first leaving the word
[2:07:56] if you leave that word you have left God
[2:08:00] thus he presented himself to the church
[2:08:03] at Pergamos indeed all the churches of
[2:08:05] all ages
[2:08:06] I am the word if you won't DD in your
[2:08:10] myths then welcome and receive the word
[2:08:14] don't let anyone or anything get between
[2:08:17] you in that word that's what I am giving
[2:08:20] you the word is a revelation of myself I
[2:08:24] am that word remember that and then he
[2:08:28] says I wonder if we are sufficiently
[2:08:31] impressed with the word in our midst are
[2:08:41] we sufficiently impressed with the word
[2:08:45] in our midst
[2:08:46] let me give you a thought here said how
[2:08:48] do we pray we pray in Jesus name do it
[2:08:51] don't we every prayer is in his name
[2:08:54] there isn't any answer yet in 1st John
[2:08:57] 5:14 we're told this is a confidence we
[2:09:00] have in him if we ask anything according
[2:09:02] to his will he heareth us and if we know
[2:09:06] that he hears us whatsoever we ask we
[2:09:08] know we have the petitions that we have
[2:09:11] desired of God now we asked what is the
[2:09:13] will of God there's only one that way to
[2:09:15] know his will and that is by the Word of
[2:09:19] God
[2:09:20] lamentations 337 who is he that saith
[2:09:24] come at the pass when the word when the
[2:09:26] Lord commanders it not there it is if it
[2:09:28] is in the word you can't have it so we
[2:09:32] can't ask unless it's in the word and we
[2:09:34] can't petition or ask unless it's in his
[2:09:37] name there it is again Jesus the name is
[2:09:40] the word the wheel you can't separate
[2:09:42] God in the word they are one is
[2:09:46] everybody with me yet now this word that
[2:09:51] he left behind on printed page is a part
[2:09:55] of him when you accept it by faith into
[2:09:59] a spirit-filled life he said his word is
[2:10:04] life there it is he is spirit and he is
[2:10:07] life that's exactly what the word is
[2:10:12] that's exactly what Jesus is he is the
[2:10:17] word so when a spirit born spirit filled
[2:10:20] man in faith takes the word into his
[2:10:25] heart and place it in upon his lips why
[2:10:28] it's the same as DD speaking every
[2:10:31] mountain has to go Satan cannot stand
[2:10:35] before that man hallelujah and neither
[2:10:40] will it stand before this word bride in
[2:10:43] this last day because she is the word
[2:10:46] with signs following
[2:10:47] them that believe a man what he God
[2:10:51] return us to the word what it receives
[2:10:54] the word what is here this morning the
[2:10:56] word what did the word sell it put
[2:10:58] position yourself there I am a son of
[2:11:00] God I am NOT a sinner I don't belong to
[2:11:04] the world I can't overcome this I can
[2:11:07] ride somebody he said I could he said
[2:11:10] they they've got overcometh and I know
[2:11:12] I'm gonna overcome let the musicians
[2:11:14] come a man he said I would he said this
[2:11:18] is what I would do his promise lays in
[2:11:21] the work the works that I do shall you
[2:11:24] do also we can't have the word without
[2:11:28] the works we don't have to preach the
[2:11:30] worse we preach the word and the signs
[2:11:33] will follow the word
[2:11:35] and when the true word gets preached
[2:11:36] again come on not this theology not to
[2:11:42] stop of hate the same not the stuff that
[2:11:45] he doesn't he like he did not the stuff
[2:11:48] it was only for back then 40 50 years
[2:11:51] ago we gotta get back to the word a man
[2:11:55] and realizes God's will for every
[2:11:59] individual to be well and from when his
[2:12:05] conditions are met and his word is
[2:12:07] believe it's going to happen there's no
[2:12:14] maybe in your case it's not you listen
[2:12:19] if it's maybe four but one is maybe for
[2:12:22] everybody
[2:12:22] a man if God will heal anyone he'll heal
[2:12:26] you healing is the children's bread what
[2:12:30] would her father withhold his bread from
[2:12:32] one child and give it to another we got
[2:12:37] evidence right here there's a ladder she
[2:12:41] ate the children's bread she was healed
[2:12:45] why would God withhold that from another
[2:12:48] child of God it's over doll and there's
[2:12:52] enough breath and in vain enough
[2:12:55] breathing he still multiplies it come on
[2:12:59] he'll supply all your knees listen
[2:13:05] sickness and diseases is claiming a
[2:13:08] terrible toll on people's lives we've
[2:13:12] got medical science that demonstrated
[2:13:15] some of the greatest achievements yet at
[2:13:19] the same time disease persist ravages
[2:13:26] human lives around the world people are
[2:13:28] dying right now
[2:13:32] the tragedy is these sicknesses and
[2:13:38] diseases are affecting the bodies of
[2:13:41] thousands of Christians real believers
[2:13:44] children of God yet we got preachers and
[2:13:49] teachers influenced but their traditions
[2:13:53] their theology that can offer them a
[2:13:57] little more than sympathy or pity that's
[2:14:00] all they do well must be God's will
[2:14:07] it'll work out for the best God's
[2:14:11] teaching me a lesson in humility maybe
[2:14:14] it's just God's chastisement or you're
[2:14:19] getting drawn closer to God
[2:14:23] cuz he works his wheel through our life
[2:14:26] through sickness all of them are lies
[2:14:30] they're excuses for powerless religion
[2:14:37] brother Branham didn't preach those why
[2:14:40] should we preach them we don't have to
[2:14:43] be sick we have a healer I'm gonna say
[2:14:47] it you don't have to be sick any more
[2:14:49] than you have to be sinful it's always
[2:14:52] God's desire to save you it's God's
[2:14:56] desire to heal you why is it why is it
[2:15:03] why is it here in this new covenant why
[2:15:06] is it with the message in this day that
[2:15:09] we're letting the enemy Ren wrap it over
[2:15:11] us why is it and we're just sittin until
[2:15:17] we die
[2:15:19] would you just remember when Israel left
[2:15:22] out of Egypt he proclaimed I am the Lord
[2:15:27] God that heals all your diseases
[2:15:31] and the Bible said there were three
[2:15:34] million that became well and strong come
[2:15:41] on the Bible said there wasn't there
[2:15:44] wasn't a a weak one among them is that
[2:15:49] right a man but you see it's when we
[2:15:53] changed God to I was instead of I am or
[2:16:01] we changed he will be and we hear it all
[2:16:05] the time when the bride gets her power
[2:16:09] where would she get her noisy she is the
[2:16:12] Anointed One the Spirit of the Lord is
[2:16:16] upon me he has anointed me to preach the
[2:16:19] gospel to bind up the brokenhearted to
[2:16:24] to set the captives at liberty amen he
[2:16:28] healed the sick to open the islands of
[2:16:30] the by the anointing is here it's the
[2:16:33] Holy Ghost you Sam receive power after
[2:16:35] the Holy Ghost is come upon you why are
[2:16:38] we waiting for the power when the power
[2:16:40] is already here why have we let theology
[2:16:43] take us back to attention Christ
[2:16:46] religion come on somebody or just to a
[2:16:51] Baptist profession of God can but god
[2:16:57] but God won't but he can if it be his
[2:17:02] will it is his will he wrote it in his
[2:17:05] will
[2:17:13] if under the old cumin there's three
[2:17:15] million people could be well at one time
[2:17:22] then how many people can be well today
[2:17:25] living under the New Covenant when we've
[2:17:28] been pointed back to the original
[2:17:30] atonement where Jesus paid for our sins
[2:17:33] and our sickness
[2:17:36] we got a covenant that is on a better
[2:17:40] promise with a better priesthood to a
[2:17:44] more excellent ministry it's high time
[2:17:48] we begin to realize we're the word and
[2:17:50] we've expressed the word instead of
[2:17:53] expressing all these other doubts and
[2:17:56] confusion and unbelief start declaring
[2:18:03] start by today declaring who you are
[2:18:07] declaring what the word said declaring
[2:18:11] every spirit is underneath him declaring
[2:18:15] that by my god he has made me to run
[2:18:18] through a troop and leap over a wall
[2:18:22] declare it not more than a conquerer to
[2:18:27] him that loved me declare it
[2:18:31] then he wants us to walk in perfect
[2:18:33] health in peace that I would that you
[2:18:37] would be in health even as your soul
[2:18:40] prospers start declaring what the word
[2:18:45] said about you stop prama can't claim on
[2:18:48] that promise start expecting it in the
[2:18:52] church begin to think put on the mind of
[2:18:57] Christ because the Antichrist coming in
[2:19:00] with his lies trying to make us
[2:19:04] powerless trying to make us disbelieve
[2:19:07] our weapon get back into the Word of God
[2:19:11] and begin to see what he made the
[2:19:14] promise for I will perform my good work
[2:19:17] towards you and bringing you back to
[2:19:20] this land and I'll restore to you the
[2:19:25] years of the cankerworm the palmer worm
