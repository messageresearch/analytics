and every desire that we have lord we've given you preeminence we're yours lord and we just surrender ourselves to you now we're just asking for the anointing of the holy spirit to come and anoint our hearts lord anoint us with faith to believe the word of promise i ask the lord you bring healing and deliverance to your children whatever the need are yes lord will you just minister to them in a very very personal way lord you're a god that you can discern the thoughts and into the heart you give us the answer to every situation you alone lord of the key to the door father you gave peter those keys and he said whatever you loose on earth i'll loose it in heaven you've got a right to unlock the kingdom and all that belongs to it lord oh god then that key was given to the church and here we are today lord standing with the key the key the key of promise the promises you said i'll never leave you i forsake you i'll be with you to the end of the world lord the promises you said oh god that you you would enable us to stand in this day when there's powers that are raising up beasts come up out of the sea beast about the lamb and you got feed on the glory lord i i know father that's where you are today is in the bright body of jesus christ we're possessors of heaven and earth possessors of every promise i pray lord you'll heal the sick among us you'll deliver the needy answer the questions and that's in every heart i just say lord where could we go but to you lord you are all in all you're our everything we want to thank you you spoke to this generation lord in a very special way that you've revealed yourself to an end-time people lord confusion comes and doubts comes and fears comes and unbelief comes in like a flood but i pray lord you'll just lift up a standard against it today that standard would be lifted up in your people lord that they'll realize that we're the sons and daughters of the most high god and there is nothing can stand in our way we are unstoppable we will not turn around we will press the goal we will move in toward the heavens where all things are possible to them that believe i pray lord in the name of jesus may every spirit of affliction today be septic to the name of jesus christ we ask it amen amen god bless you good to be in the house of the lord [Music] amen good to be present and with the spirit of god here among us and with us working through us amen i love the young people's song a while ago thank you very much that blessed my heart i got my mind made up amen i'm not going to turn around i'm not going to turn back amen but we we certainly want to see him that's what we want to see and even in this service today we want to see jesus seen a lot of man shown through the ages but we want to see jesus we want him manifest here among us amen so if you'll turn with me to genesis 17 i'm going to read from there again this morning um there's a still a lot in the scripture that i want to bring out genesis 17 verse 1 and when abram was 90 years old and nine the lord appeared to abram and said unto him i am the almighty god walk before me and be thou perfect and i will make my covenant between me and thee and i will multiply thee exceedingly and abram fell on his face and god talked with him saying then down verse 21 but my covenant will i establish with isaac which sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year and he left off talking with him and god went up from abraham amen going to let you be seated we want to welcome each one of you today in the name of the lord jesus christ and amen it's good to have you sister melanie all the way from australia taliyah all of the the children there each one that is here with us we're just happy to have you the davis family we hadn't have you and privileged to have you in a little while so good to see you today amen i was thinking about you yesterday again and uh each one of you as we anticipated for this service today i believe the lord has something special for us we're in special time in a special hour we're special people called for a purpose uh i just um you know was uh come across a couple of things as i listened to tapes this week and and uh you know it really not particularly for my study just for my own edification and um i heard brother branham say these words god doesn't promise a flower bed of eden don't falsify a christian and don't falsify the message by telling that everything's going to be all right that there's nothing going to harm you there's nothing there ain't no trials no nothing that's wrong as a point said must i be carried to home to heaven on a flower bed of ease while others fought to win the prize and sailed through bloody seas no sir god doesn't promise ease and prosperity but he promises grace to endure in every hard trial and it's that grace we look to amen so god doesn't say everything's always going to go right and you'll never have any troubles and there won't be um reoccurring heartaches or heartaches that never happened before god doesn't say that life is full of trouble we are here as mortals and god doesn't even intend us to live here forever in these mortal bodies amen he put a time limit on them amen he doesn't want us to be here beyond a certain set time of suffering and god knows exactly what we all must endure and one by one will be taken off the board as it was and set aside into that heavenly kingdom graduated from here but we know this that while we're here we can look for his favor and his favor comes in many ways it brings healing it brings deliverance it brings salvation for our homes it brings peace it brings joy uh it brings satisfaction it brings all kinds of things but you know again a long life's journey we go through ups and downs and trials and curves and life's journey remember you know he didn't say that we wouldn't go through that he said yea though i walked to the valley of the shout of death thou art with me and your rod and your staff they comfort me they keep me in line and so we're we're looking to that today and um you know i i thought about it today as um i got word through email from sister melanie coming from all the way from australia you know australia is like japan and some of the new zealand some of the other they've been really shut down tight and not not able to get out of the country and people wasn't able to get in i just got word from sister ruth um over there uh in japan she's our translator there into the japanese language and she was telling me of another sermon that was just translated into the japanese language but she said we're just now opening up the doors you you know if you want to visit you you're required to have um three different shots of uh of inoculation from covid so you know one don't work and two don't work my boosters gotta you know work and you know so you know there's uh all kinds of restrictions lots of fear a lot of trouble in the world that we're in today but we know who holds tomorrow he's in uh we are in his hand now i've always told you as a church that we need to be like a big oak tree where that um ones could come god's children could come if they needed healing or deliverance of the holy ghost or whatever it is that we want to be like that where people can come and rest under our shade for a little while and receive um refreshing from the presence of the lord now that's why sister melanie is here she has a great need and just as soon as it opened up on the plane she got and she's traveled now all those hours getting in last night and and now in the service today and uh you say brother tim why why would you mention that well i i think about brother ron you know when um he was preaching some well it was in 2020 um seemed like it was the yeah 2020 in june there that he had just he was just so weak and he could not go any further and and uh you know it was just collapsing every day and ran out of energy we had visited him earlier and um you know i'd flown in there in february we were supposed to have gone to japan and we canceled the meetings there because the kobe did come and shut it down and people wouldn't get able to get off of ships and uh we were became concerned that we wouldn't be able to get back in the country or you know we'd get hung up somehow so we we canceled our trip to go into there uh in in japan instead i went to all the way over into virginia and karen and i went and prayed for brother ron spencer and when we prayed for him he'd been told he had cancer then and he he when he we prayed for him the fear left him all the fear all the anxiety every bit of it left that went with along with the cancer and and but now you know he was still left so weak that he could not function by the way he is preaching today brother ray erickson's up in ohio that's where he is he he's untowering in his in his drive to to preach the gospel to minister to those that are in need but anyway uh speaking of that i you know he he had spoke on a sunday it was in june and uh spoke on a um a on a sunday that that um uh you know sometimes uh people would drive 17 hours to get to brother branham and and the prayer line and be prayed for and that night in the middle of the night he began to think on what he preached and he said we're 17 hours and he he got to just put it together real quick and he said i'm going to louisiana well at that same time you know sister karen was struck down with a brain bleed and was in the hospital and and was um you know in a in a very dire condition then the doctors said she wouldn't live and god gave us another year with her good year and it was a wonderful time but nevertheless um you know she lay in that condition the icu there wasn't given me any hope she wasn't talking she wasn't responding they had done a blood evacuation from her brain and and uh you know honestly i i didn't feel like being that you know that i had anything to give if you know what i'm talking about i mean he he wants to come and and i feel like i i've got a wife and you know my she's got this need and she's in a dying condition and and i'm asked to pray i'm being asked to pray for you coming over here 17 hours and my wife's in this kind of condition and and um you know it's it's it's hard you know i'm i'm doing everything to believe from my wife and and and here i'm attacked on this every hand here and slammed on every side and now god you're sending somebody 17 hours away for me to pray for and i i don't i don't feel like i've got anything that i've got to give you know who am i and i went into the hospital and and to see karen squeezed her hand she squeezed me back and i said she's there she's crazy squeeze me back i love you and and uh i called brother ron back and i said brother ron you come on i said i'll get to the girls to visit with karen and the icu while i can't be there and i said i'll spend that time to minister with you and he went he came there and leaving out on sunday evening drove and uh got there monday um and we spent all day monday let me tell you he didn't wait he didn't wait for a special time of prayer whatever he said i want you to pray right now we prayed with him and the holy spirit moved on his behalf and he went back to there to to virginia and he hasn't missed a day's work since working with his boys every day except for doctor's appointments that he had to go to other than that he hadn't missed a day because of being sick and too weak to go you see god he makes a way amen and sometimes when you don't feel like you've got anything to give or who am i or you know how can we have faith in this hour the word of god rises up within us and provides the grace for the time of need amen you know brother branham talked about this after all god did for abraham and showing him el shaddai and and bringing him through justification sanctification as it was to the baptism of the holy ghost and type and then and then he comes all the way got a 16 year old boy think now trials are over and he says abraham i just want to see how much faith you really got i'm going to give you a back set in your divine healing see how far you trust me you know sometimes you have back sets did you ever know that i've had a lot of them yes i've been preaching the gospel for years and turned right around and i get so sick i don't know what to do sometimes but my anchor holds amen i just anchor it around calvary and say oh god i can't see calvaries the waves are so heavy you know imagine it like a boat going up and down and you lose a glimpse and he said you lose glimpse of calvary god i can't see calvary the waves are so heavy and my my people are all saying this the doctor says i can't live but something in here the lifeline is still holy amen that's the thing today is our lifeline is still holding and so therefore we look no matter whether there's ups and downs we know we're tied to a promise at calvary by my stripes you were healed amen how many feels like you're tied to that this morning well no matter whether your trials are coming your anchor holes to the promise of god amen questions comes problems comes doubts comes fears comes unbelief comes but our anchor holds we know in whom we have believe and we're persuaded he's able to keep that which we've committed to him against that day i want to turn to revelations 19 and i want to look at verse 6 because i'm not through with this scripture either and i heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and the voice of many waters and the voice of mighty thunder and saying hallelujah for the lord god omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed and find linen clean and white for the final linen is the righteousness of the saints and he said unto me blessed are they that are called to the marriage supper of the lamb and he said unto me these are the true saiyans of god now last sunday i was speaking on abraham's voice today i'm going to speak on the junction because you know with abraham's voice as we talked about it was just it's a part of the great multitude it is the sound of many waters like thunderings that literally speak out of every scripture now abraham here was at a junction of time and it was that junction of time that there was a display of omnipotence you see things were not going to remain the same from here on out at disappearing of el shaddai things would never be the same that it was before ishmael the son of the bonds woman would no longer be thought of as the promised son uh you know the hagar the bomb's woman would no longer have her place as the mother of the promised son now they would be blessed and ishmael would become a great nation but they would no longer would he be thought of as abraham's heir and and neither would he be the one who the covenant of god was with god was making it plain i'm making my covenant with another and at this junction that we're in now god has rejected every denomination and has taken a bride without spotter wrinkle now that's not saying none of them will be saved they will be saved they'll go through tribulation but he's taken an elect people like he did with isaac and the church will go through the tribulation aren't you glad that there's more grace than what you ever realize amen i'm glad there was a grace for israel like that ishmael god would say i will bless him i'll make a great nation of him i'm not just rejecting him totally i'm not pushing him out i'm just telling you i'm making a covenant with another people and this people will come out of isaac and it's going to come out of the supernatural it won't be the bones woman producing this but it'll be the a child of the free and and he'll be a supernatural child because you will be dead in your body and sarah dead in her womb and you know you and it will take the miraculous it'll take the supernatural it'll take the omnipotence amen omnipotence will have to rain over your impotence and and omnipotence will have to reign over her bareness and i'll tell you we're in a day and hour where omnipotence must again rain amen where we can say the lord god omnipotent reigneth amen that he's reigning in his supernatural power now again the church will go through the tribulation and receive life at the white throne judgment and well but won't go in the rapture with the children of the free woman remember the the children of the bomb's woman is not heir with the children of the free woman is that right amen so brother branham would tell us he said you know denominations children of the bonds women won't be heir with the bride the bride are going to rapture the other will go through the tribulation there will be many of them that are given life at the white throne judgment now so you see god that's because god is rich in mercy somehow another people got confused because the lamb took the book and opened the seals but revelation would reveal it to a prophet that somehow mercy was over friend it's more mercy than you ever imagined it's more grace than you ever imagined and my grace would open by the opening of the seven seals which show there's a multitude without number given life there at the white throne judgment it led to living waters and god is caring for those people he loves them he wipes away their tears you know he is not willing that any should perish he would say even the cane you know don't you know if you'll do right don't you know if you'll come to abel's way don't you know if you'll bring a lamb just like he did that you two will be accepted now so but you see he saw the perfect will of god and refuse to come that way are you with me now so do you see that god is a god of mercy is a god of grace in fact of the matter is the rapture itself is one of the greatest outpouring of grace that there ever was it is grace that would catch us out of this evil age and and we will escape the things that are coming on the earth rather than having to go through them that is great abundant grace amen now there have been many junctions along the road brother branham would talk about five seven junctions of time and again he would preach on five junctions of time but there in fact has been many junctions of time and we're we are now at a junction and i i feel it more and more as i'm going on that we're we're in i can feel the whims of change hey man i we're in a season or a junction where where the the supernatural god is manifests himself in such a way bringing us to a junction a revealing of the omnipotence of god you know it'll take omnipotence to change your body you know it will take omnipotence to raise the dead in christ you know we are on the verge of the greatest omnipotence that there ever was the pouring out of the holy spirit and the finishing of his work do you know that amen this is where we're at we're at a junction now we're ordained to these junctions you see the very thing that you came for this tabernacle this morning the reason you drove all the way up from texas the way some of you came all the way up from over from australia to others that have driven in here from different other places some living close by and some you know far removed but nevertheless you are here for a purpose god foreknew it he ordered it amen that you can receive the very thing that you came for you may even not have known the need that you had in your life you didn't mean to cannot even put your finger on it maybe you're not even cognate of it but god knows that need and he is the one that has said you know that for new year you're coming and he said everything in order amen the only thing we've got to do is receive it and if i were you with this morning i would get in the receiving mode and my more god whatever you have for me i want it all i want to experience it all i i want to i want to have it within my life amen now you know again there's nothing there is nothing going to take that away from you it lays right before you now abraham was in this place of change too god was setting it all in order by his power with his supernatural visitation of the almighty god had promised him a case of divine healing you know that a man he had told him he would have a child at 75 years of age that was a promise of divine healing is that right amen god has promised us such case of divine healing too he promised to remove the stain of sin and the unbelief of the ages off of this bride even as he promised to heal sarah of the stain of age he promises to do it to extent that we will be at church without spot or wrinkle or blemish the healing he promises is so complete the bride will be without a blemish emma come on sarah amen here she was blemished here she was old here she was incapable here she was unable but let me tell you god made it so complete until she was so without blemish a young king would want her in his harem is somebody with me now amen uh you see again despite with me without blemish every wrinkle of false teaching oh my ever stained a false doctrine every stain of confusion of the past amen until that every wrinkle is gone every are you with me every blemish long to the extent she's a pride restored a restored people of restored pride those who died in the ages past this rest restoration will be so complete they will rise those of the living will be changed and all of us translated together it's not a wonderful moment we are here at a junction of time and to do this god must get our hearts to believing and it must not be just an external change but an internal change amen you know we look for the external oh i'll be black-headed again and i won't have any wrinkles and you know my sagging body will that's been pulled down by the gravity that back to the earth again you know it'll be strong and healthy there won't be any blemish but friends that's the outside what about the inside you see it must not be just an external change but an internal change and that means that people filled with god's ability to believe amen to believe for anything a people filled with the holy ghost a people empowered you see god likes to show his power not because he has to but he loves to do it it pleases him and his omnipotence to let his subjects know who he is he loves to let you know i'm the same yesterday today and forever i am the god and i change not amen i am your healer i am your savior i am your deliverer i am every god love so let us people know amen that i'm that he's real and it prepares our hearts it makes us ready it makes us brace up and ready to take a new hole amen here abraham was getting a new hold on things amen bracing up for something greater to come greater than what he'd ever imagined god doing now the people who don't believe in divine healings and performing the miracles it's no wonder our churches are dying amen it's no wonder they're withering away into bloodless cults amen because when you really get away from the blood that's the holy ghost then you quit seeing miracles you quit seeing signs and wonders what happened the workings of the holy spirit and it just turns us into a bloodless cult amen amen now think about this no wonder the social gospel is taken over today even what's left of religion is because our teachings have taken us away from the phenomena of god and god himself is a phenomenon you see again he is a creator he's jehovah he is the great reality he's the great substance of everything that was because it's all made by him now and he displays his power he shows his power on every day every day when the sun rises because god said let there be every time there's a rainbow is because god said i'll put it in the heavens every time that he does when he comes down to us his subject and he heals us of our diseases and saves us from our sins what is that is god displaying his power amen but we're at a junction and i want to talk about where we have come this age changed to a supernatural age things began to happen very very supernaturally when it began in 1906 and it began with the pouring out of god's spirit and it will end with the pouring out of god's spirit now it wasn't that god didn't pour out his spirit of some in luther or wesley but this was a greater portion and again god is in this day pouring out emptying out finishing the work you see joel 2 28 has to be fully manifested acts chapter 2 has to be fully manifested the day of pentecost must fully come and we've come through seven ages amen we're since the passover we're here in time are you with me we're here right now in the season it's the junction of the chains it's the junction of the jubilee it's the junction of the liberation amen amen you see god would loose things within sarah's body that had never been loosed before god would lose something within abraham that had never been loosed before and god's about to lose something in this bride like you've never seen before amen glory to god because you see at a junction like this he appears and when he appears he appears in omnipotence so that you can say the lord god omnipotent reigns now brother adam would talk about this in the world falling apart and he's let me just share this little quotation that's the hour that we're living oh god the world is falling apart have you ever seen such a time where the world has fallen apart families are falling apart countries are falling apart political promises are falling apart have we ever seen such a time there hangs and their hangers bombs their hangs the things that's to do just exactly and there again russia has already just announced we we have your number you know with one warhead we can wipe out the whole east coast of america and with another we will wipe out the second and we have allowed our politicians until our country has went to sleep paying on social programs such as abortion and murdering our kids rather than providing protection for our people are you with me amen so you again again the the bombs are in the hangar you say brother tim you know it's what about this junction well i'll tell you at this junction we're just exactly like noah was in that day he said it's going to come rain and it'll come from the skies but we are saying it's coming of fire and it's coming from the heavens amen and this world is going to birth into a new world and a millennium will come and we're right on the cusp of it [Applause] hallelujah we're at the junction of it but the church has made herself ready is that right that's the scripture it's in these moments that god prepares the people listen he had to send a message to prepare the hearts of people to turn their faith back to the faith of the fathers we couldn't go on in baptist methodism presbyterian and men's ideas come on we've had him for years he said brother until these are brother branham's idea these are not brother brown's ideas we believe the bible serpency comes from the bible predestination comes from the bible baptism in jesus name comes from the bible one god this is the one god bible [Applause] come on somebody amen these are not men's ideas this is god's idea it was not brother brandon's message it was god's message it's the message of jesus christ to the laodicea [Applause] people want to dismiss it i'll tell you what if you have problems with the message you don't have problems with brother branham you have problems with the angel amen that angel that stood on the platform by brother branham and night after night in service after service discern the thoughts and intents of heart and was never wrong amen amen never was there a gift in pentecost like it amen assumes the meeting could never produce it they never had it god did it to confirm a message and it was to prepare a people what good would it do to come if there's enough people prepared amen you know sometimes you know what if these others got to offer you anyway you know what what more what greater do they have to give you i see the effects a lot of times of what's being offered today so leave the message and go follow this well look at their children look at the offspring look at their families look at their unbelief it doesn't give them greater faith it doesn't produce the miraculous it don't produce the supernatural power of god that gets a soul down to the altar and surrenders to god it just simply confuses the mind a delusion the church is ready she's sealed in ready to come there be a great there'll be a big outpouring of the spirit yes sir to grab the church and take her into the sky exactly because the church the word the bride and christ and his ministry is in his bride which is body the supernatural body of his here the spiritual body on earth his spirit is in there living his life right out until him and the church becomes one in the wedding and they become one he takes them just from a little minority in this last day now we're not talking about that little minority being evening like tabernacle god's got a bride around the world but it's still a minority in fact of the matter is i just want to convey to you for a moment you are an endangered species you are an endangered people and if god didn't have a rapture plan for you you would be exterminated now it is that expectant outpouring of the quickening power that brings us to recognize our position and place and our responsibilities as a called people separated from the world and dedicated to god now another great junction in this age was when was made when the angel came to brother branham now you know we could go to a lot of junctions we could go back you know in the thousands of years before us we go to abraham or noah enoch each one of them were junctions they were in the old testament they were prophesying objections in the new testament we are still in the new testament we're under the new covenant we're new testament people we're walking in new testament promises we are fulfillment of the new testament are you with me amen so again we can go back and we can look and we can say luther that was a junction and wesley that was a junction of zoos tree that was a junction but i'm just talking about the junctions that we've had you know maybe sometimes there may not be major junctions as to the world but they're major to us you see another great junction was was made when an angel came to brother branham to start the divine healing movement now brother branham just you know made a claim that why was there such an uproar if he made a claim and nothing happened you know anybody can say i met with an angel there's still a lot of them there's would be prophets today that rise i'm a prophet i'm a minor prophet everybody couldn't listen to me you know again there's all kinds of things that that are are are there you know brother branham could have just made a claim oh i i met an angel but the reason why we know he met an angel was the angel was there the angel opened the eyes of the blind it caused the death to hear it caused the cripples to walk and man it discerned the thoughts and intents of heart are you with me so it was a great junction that would start the divine healing movement because god was displaying his omnipotence amen and he let us know in those times that no matter how crippled or twisted or marred whether you're a boy on a chain crippled down mental in your mind whether you're a hopeless case whether you've been laying there where you're 40 and 40 50 pounds like like for florence nightingale i will forget her last number name but anyway florence there she she was there laying in the bed and dying and she had a desperate need and she flew all the way from south africa if i could just get to england to see him brother brendan said i can't do anything maybe i can just offer a little prayer i don't have a vision i don't have a word from god i don't know what to do amen but as he's praying there a dove comes and lights down on the wind to seal and begins to cool and as it begins to go listen this was done this was done by in front of men this was no secret oh man and what happened there the voice of god spoke out of him the omnipotence was displaced and man he spoke healing over her body and she returned to a woman 160 pounds because why omnipotence spoke omnipotence was on display and god had brought the church to a junction where that you can believe for anything that you can say nothing is impossible amen another great junction was when seven angels came for the opening of the seven seals it brought to us an open book where no longer are we probing as others did in prior ages trying to pry and hear matthew henry pried tried to look and he guessed about this scripture and that but we're no longer guessing amen we're no longer wondering amen even you say well you know again brother tim that was brother branham and his idea and he was just plagiarizing and he was just making stuff up but about that time the angel came in the room and you'll not find what he taught in any book come on amen they usually have all the seven seals happening over in the tribulation and most every one of them do they don't see it starting back here as that line spirit impersonating christ back in the first age and when they see that horse as it begins to ride and then it rides into the red horse through with the millions that are killed 68 million and more plastic or killed bloodies that it's sword and bloodies the rider bloodies the horse then the dark ages then the pale horse which is where we are just about to fully morph into it's at the junction where satan will do his final ride and we done had a prophet come along and said i'll tell you what his name is death and that was not named till the eagle comes are you with me now you know some of that goes over your head maybe but you know it ought to if you just if i could just get you into the message you'd understand what i'm preaching about but you see this was what's was again the angels of god in the presence of that ball of fire no angels not winged theophanies but angels with wings which which signify symbolically moving and there are seven angels in the bible amen somebody help me preach seven angels there they're the seven spirits of god before the throne but you see god is in seven people and he's really not seven spirits but it's one spirit in seven different manifestations down through the ages are you with me and here in that room night after night the angel of god revealing a portion of the book amen to we are no longer in this junction of time we are no longer guessing at the contents we are not a church that is built like the church of christ on alexander's guesses alexander campbell his guesses are martin luther's guesses or wesley's guesses a man of presbyterian or catholic or whatever their guess is we're no longer guessing oh man it's we of just saith the lord amen why because the supernatural what's displayed omnipotent spoke yes hallelujah omnipotence spoke and when omnipotence spoke it got rid of all the other questions about it [Music] we have the answer to the devil's question he has been totally exposed from genesis to revelation about the man of sin has been revealed and we see him today at work [Music] another great junction was when god took his prophet home well brother tim i don't like to talk about that one well it had to happen just as jesus said i must go away if jesus had not went away he said the comforter can't come if i don't leave you i can't send the holy ghost the spirit that's in me to come dwell in you it's just that simple and if god had not taken brother branham you know where would we have been for the last 56 years following him around from eating the meat and there wouldn't be an evening like tabernacle there wouldn't be a mission work in japan there wouldn't be works in africa come on amen but god had a plan the devil couldn't take him you know we look at sometimes that death is a very difficult and hard thing it is on our side and we look at brother branham you know even going by the way of a car wreck and and why did he have to die like that god don't really care how we die some died by fire some died by stripes some died by imprisonment some died by starvation some died by look at the bible god really doesn't he's not concerned about how you exit here he's concerned about your entrance there [Applause] well what about your wife brother tim when when she died why did she have to die that way you know why did god do it god didn't do that god was there to receive her he was there to take her out of the pest house to heal or complete to bring a real deliverance god rescued her [Applause] my wife has been rescued and the old simple zion comes to her took her on the other side and she lives she's not dead she lives and that was brother branham john the baptist got his head cut off at a woman's dance horrible thing why why would god let that happen to the greatest prophet who would introduce the messiah he had to decrease so jesus could increase look even over in acts 19 way over now many years past here's still followers of john they ain't even been baptized they don't even know about the holy ghost the holy ghost to come they don't even know it happened they've been so caught up being followers of john you know why they had made a personality cult out of it and they failed to see who he pointed to and i want you to understand you know it had to happen it had to come to this this junction had to take place god had to take his prophet off the scene why so the spirit of god not brother branham spirit the spirit of god could be poured out upon a multi-membered body amen because there were more voices of god to speak god had to speak through you through me to the life of young people amen to the old to whoever god he speaks we didn't want him to go we clung to him we walked around in confusion for for a number of years you know why did god do this what's happening now and and why all of that and you know and and we we didn't know even what to do we had no churches to go to we had no nothing to be to all we could do is is try to hear everything that was said absorb it eat it we become like this junction you know there um to when when moses died in joshua chapter one and two moses my servant is dead now therefore arise and go on over this jordan and all these people under the land which i give them even to the children of israel so you see god god's word was them to to joshua go on over into jordan go uh the inheritance is yours moses brought you to it he pointed you to it now go take the book and eat it go digest what is there and the land is ours go take it joshua chapter 1 and verse 5 there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of their life i just want to say to you where right where we're standing god's promise is no devil no demon no evil spirit no sickness no problem come on now is able to stand for you before you all the days of thy life as i was with moses so will i be with you i will not fail thee nor for safety be strong oh hear the word the lord it's this junction be strong amen it's not a time to be weak second guessing amen losing your position forgetting what god has revealed it's a time look be strong be of good courage amen for unto this people they shall divide for an inheritance the lamb that i swear on their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous here again he brings it around again admonishing it be strong how are you going to be strong how is abraham going to do this how is he going to produce a child his body is dead sarah's body is dead come on somebody how is he going to do this he can't do it but he said be strong and courageous why are we going to be strong by judging god faithful who made the promise i don't know how he's going to do it i don't know but we've got to get out of this mess that we're in the world is getting darker and darker and sodom is closing in everywhere is somebody with me right now amen so we've got to do it we must be strong and and be of good courage remember those that know their god shall be strong and do exploits [Applause] be courageous don't back down off of a promise don't give up don't surrender to the devil don't let your children go come on don't let your your wife your heart don't let nothing go hold on to every promise hold on to your healing hold on for your miracle hold on to your deliverance be courageous i will not fail thee amen i nor forsake thee or what a promise that is amen be strong and very courageous let's look down verse 7 only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest prosper whether soever thou goes so don't turn one to this side or that right side right there with the message stay centered on calvary you say brother tim you you're following the message i am following christ he is the message that was his message his voice his word and he would vindicate it every time remember revelation says that the our our revelation of deity to the last ages i am the amen i'm the final say and god what would he do service after service after service would come down and give an amen yes sir amen it's the word present discerning of the thoughts and the entrance of the heart now he says this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth and i want to give you a warning right now don't you speak any other thing amen don't speak negatively don't confess the wrong things the word must not depart out of your mouth you must come keep confessing if you're sick you must confess i am healed by his stripes i'm healed amen he's the lord god that healeth all thy diseases nothing will stand before our prayers not even cancer the the effects of prayer of a righteous man availeth much effectual fervent now you must meditate in it day and night oh come on young people look at the distractions today and it's not just young people it's middle-aged people you you you got marriage problems because men are just slaves to this video games and they're in a virtual world or a imaginary world they're living in demonic dimensions where they kill other people where they're murdering and raping and rabbising and and every other kind of thing tell me tell me what bit of good does it do you know we had a kid come to youth camp here that while back and he was a friend with other kids at youth camp and he wasn't a believer he just showed up because the other kids was coming to this christian camp so he wanted to go too and you know his claim to fame was i'm number three in the world for a certain game number three and i looked at him and i said whoop-dee-doo so what did that earn you a job does that put food on your table does that communicate with a wife or a friend does that do anything for christ does it add or contribute anything to the family so what good is it it's a waste of your time it is something to trap you in another dimension where your mind is filled with violence hate every other kind of evil thing i know what i'm talking about i was born at night daniel williams said but it wasn't last night so what is it when you stand before god and you give an account to him how ashamed are you going to be when it's all played back this is my life this is my world there's no prayer life that's right there's no word listened to there's no soul edified you're not edified and it's turned around to nervous hateful people that after feeding on those things go out and become mass murderers well i'd never do that you never know what it happens when that spirit takes you amen you know it's time for you to be a husband a daddy amen it's time for you to be a a man or a woman a mother don't get locked up in all these other things and so caught up with social media looking and lusting after what everybody else has that you don't have and you don't get to do amen they may have whatever they have but you got jesus amen you got a roof up above you you've got good food deed you got shoes on your feet you've got food on your table you're blessed quit looking at what you don't have and look around what you do have you've got a church you got a body of believers you got preachers that preach the word you got the you got the power of the holy ghost and cleanse from sin you have divine healing you have every need you don't need that meditate in this word day and night that they might and observe do it so you can learn to do everything according to what's written in there amen for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shalt have good success have not i commanded thee be strong and of good courage and be not afraid and be not dismayed for the lord thy god is with thee whether so ever thou goest now i think that that has been so applicable to these years that we have had since brother branham has gone now think of it god sent us a prophet from 1909 to 1965 he was with us 56 years i love it i i think about young men back in the day young men like brother earl williams who brother brandon would say now you know they got this this rally for the youth people youth youth and make sure you get your young people to this youth rallying and i want to see my daughter there and i want to see her filled with the holy ghost amen and then he comes up to brother branham's memorial service and he he writes some things on a lunch sack and he writes and and he talks about brother branham and his ministry and what it meant to him and and he says you know some he he did not he wasn't like others it left us a big cathedral or he left us a big organization or left us bible schools but he said he left us a message amen and that's what god did he left us a message by sending a prophet in this day we got a message from god amen well brother tim i don't know well i tell you i i don't know if he was elijah well then you've got a problem because elijah must first come you got a problem because before the world burns elijah's got to come so where's your elijah i know when the little black lady when she was praying that day for her son and he was dying and then she was just a you would have thought of nobody down in memphis and forgotten in a forgotten neighborhood an impoverished little lady there down there but a saint of god god never forgets us he knows where we are he doesn't care about our our ethnicity our race or our ideas our culture our way god comes right down amen right down to the humblest of heart that begins to call on him and she said lord i know who i am i that soon my woman you gave me a child when i was barren and you gave me a child and i tried to raise him for you and he's dying lord and he's lost oh god i'm the sooner my woman but where's your elijah he didn't send billy graham he didn't send all robbers [Applause] hallelujah amen amen but he sent elijah to her she asked for elijah and elijah come walking down her street hallelujah that's what happens when a saint begins to pray amen that god begins to move you know what happened brother brandon said that woman's prayer caused a storm in the heavens that caused that plane to have to come down in memphis and be grounded a woman's prayer caused the plane to be delayed because it had not a jonah on board but an elijah on board and a child of god had asked for elijah and here come elijah walking down her street found her house yes come on now you can't make this stuff up it happened and it happened over and over and over and over again hallelujah where god came by our way the supernatural being displayed amen god left us a message and now from 65 to now we've had 56 years of and absorbing the message we've also had 56 years where cults and clans were made and personality cults raised up gonna try to be the next great one to lead the bride on but nevertheless we've had 56 years now of teachings absorbing the message we started out with just a handful we were conf we we there's many things we misunderstood we we didn't have much of it there and we had to we we had to borrow and beg and get and print and and share and everything else and you know we spent money listen i was i was a poor boy there was times i didn't have a vehicle to ride in me and my wife was afoot and yet i wanted a tape player that i could hear the prophet's message on my son would cost me 500 300 the hospital 200 to the doctor he'd been worth every penny of it 377 to buy a tape player but i had to have it i sacrificed we pinched pennies we did everything to get it we labored in it amen whatever whatever that was taught we wanted to know what god said to this age and we've absorbed it yes amen we've absorbed it we we have we have taken and we've ate the book we consumed it there's some things that made their belly bitter some things we wanted to spit out but somehow another we've kept it down hallelujah hallelujah amen but remember the reason for eden is more more than just say well i've consumed and i've listened to so many tapes and i i've read so many books and you know and of course i can say by god's grace i i've listened to every sermon of brother branham's many times multitask over read my bible and laid in the presence of god and served in all every way that i could i'd sat at other ministers feet i'd listen to them preach and i've learned from this took nuggets from harold hildebrand ned biscuit donny reagan and daniel williams and i don't know how many others the man that is standing in this pulpit today is made up of many many different men who contributed to my life yet i never sat under any preacher but let me just say this let me let me just say this you know we have a sword the message we have digest the message we have been preaching the message [Music] but now a lot of our great men are now gone are going i just preached brother harold hildebrandt's memorial service i just spoke at brother ed mitchell's 50th anniversary for the church there we've had our 50th brother biscuit a man who's taken the message 169 times to overseas lands some of those represent six weeks at a time but now it's over it's true it's been two and a half years since he's actively ministered that season is over if it isn't it's about over you know others of our elders are are retiring because of health or or whatever moving out of the ministry now i just want to say today i believe we're at another junction a junction is where a change comes we're at a we're at a particular place where where there is a change that we've had as i said we have absorbed the message we have digested it we we've chewed on it we've we've looked at it in every kind of way and and but however every dispensation comes to its end you see and we hit a junction and there's been junctions on the highway just as you come you had to make this turn or that turn to come here you see it was a junction there truncans on the road that we travel and there's junctions on this grand old highway that we travel to glory and as always it takes the miraculous to speak of the omnipotence you see omnipotence is all power and it takes the miraculous to vindicate the omnipotence we can say all power lays in the word all power lays in the truth all power is in the message but it takes the supernatural the miraculous to vindicate the omnipotence and it's only the miraculous that can do that teaching the word is a very fine thing and we've had great teachings and a whole cycle of teachings teaching the words of fine things we've had that for the past 56 years teachers rising up faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of god amen and i just say you know we should be a people of faith by now if faith comes by hearing and hearing the word we ought to be a people chock full of faith but alas and many have turned the message into unbelief to a powerless religion whose only weapon is argument gold is the power of god gold is the gifts of the spirit that was restored so much for restoration you see there's not a sign of them gold is the shadow of the king gold is the joy of the holy ghost and the church is settled down to religion with slave mentality amen the mentality of a bones woman and a little wild donkey of a people who won't be subject to the word amen amen now you preach the word you preach holiness and they just glob on to pay all the more you preach there how that our women should be and the next thing you know their fingers are full of navy bean hulls and the toenails the same hey man you you speak about modesty and the next thing you know instead of a modest necklace or something right there they're loaded down look like they walk through a ten-cent store with the magnet on and it isn't long until our boys begin to look like sissies and our girls take on masculine spirits and our girls are pushed out into into school and learning and whatever else while our boys are sitting there playing with their games hope you didn't bring rotten eggs this morning because yeah i just made myself a target amen but i i just want you i want you to know it takes the miraculous to vindicate the omnipotence that the omnipotence still lives and reigns we must have the miraculous [Music] amen i believe brother branham even as brother branham did that the church is on the threshold of the greatest vindication of omnipotence that the world has ever known we're right here on the threshold of it [Music] amen we're right here at the junction of it but and here in this junction we are seeing the display of his omnipotence our voice must say the lord god omnipotent reigneth it is at this junction that god shows his omnipotence i then showed you how in the world could we ever have the dead in christ raised how can our bodies be changed unless the lord god reigns in omnipotence he'll reign over our mortal bodies amen it's in this junction that god shows his omnipotence and we're looking over the face of people today here's a woman here that was dying with cancer amen wasn't nothing but a shadow of a woman and she wasn't far from the point of going over but she sets this morning healthy and well and rosy cheeks why because god has displayed his omnipotence are you with me that's not the only one we could go right down the line time upon time where we've seen the holy spirit move are you with me and my men and women are right here from families of alcoholics you know if you don't went the way your brothers did or your siblings did you know if you went the way your parents did you'd be an alcoholic while i drunk you know you wouldn't have nothing look around look at the difference between you and your sibling that didn't choose jesus look what happened look at their lives look at the divorces look at the illegitimate children without a daddy because he's an alcoholic look at all the problems look at what they call but you see omnipotence spoke amen amen took you out of the world saved you from a life of sin filled you with the holy ghost took the desire of the world out of you hallelujah amen you have to break with everything with culture with friends with family whatever but you were called out for a purpose you were called out for a reason and that was to be a voice to his omnipotence god reigns he reigned over the problems of my family he reigned over the sickness he reigned over diseases he reigned over sin [Applause] others are children of adulterers and sinners they are transformed by the power of omnipotence think of it look where we can look at these junctions like enoch the seventh from adam and here we are the seventh age from the second adam he walked with god blameless and at the same time that evil was appearing angels appeared on the earth angelic beings moved into men think of that very beautiful type of today that evil is appearing and so is good appearing look we have never seen quite a time just like this because why actually innumerable innumerable numbers of spirits have been released the bible gives it a number of 200 uh 200 million but actually the meaning is innumerable it is the same thing of hebrews 11 that you find in hebrews 11 as you do over in the book of revelation of the the the the the two hundred thousand thousand it just means innumerable nobody counted them they just was up without number hebrew said and i saw he said we've come to new jerusalem to innumerable company of angels it's the same word it's not a certain number there's millions of them millions of them and they have been released and the bible shows you symbolically from euphrates which represents a line that they could not cross on the other side was eden amen and they were looking for eden amen when they couldn't get into eden they were bound there and when they couldn't bring an eden back on earth somebody with me they'd turn around and kill those that eaten this far now hold on my thought just for a minute go to revelation 9 and verse 1. we're just going to deal with this for just a little while because the fifth angel sounded yes and i saw a star fall from heaven i want you to notice this he did not descend there is a difference between a fall and a descending the lord jesus descends from heaven with a shout this angel the star this star fell from heaven to the earth notice and to him was given the key or the permission to open the bottomless pit amen now and he opened the bottomless pit now he is an angel or a star that fall a fallen star one that didn't keep his his first estate i want you to be careful in this age because there are many that are not keeping their first estate remember just as there's a peter james and john there is a judas brother tim are you calling me a judas i'm saying do not leave your first estate stay with the word amen the only difference right now between you and judas is this is that you don't have to remain a judas you still have an opportunity to turn around and become real you don't have to go along impersonating the rest of your life you can be real fifth angel sounded i saw a star from heaven for uh unto fall from heaven to the earth and him was given the key to the bottomless pit and he opened the bottomless pit and there arose a smoke out of the pit as the smoke of a great furnace and the sun and the air were darkened by the reason of the smoke of the pit now the book of revelation is a book of symbols so these are this this is not to be thought of literally this is to be thought of symbolically so you see in the symbolism he opens the bottomless pit now remember a bottomless pit is where there's no foundation and you just tumble over and over and over and over this is the state of ever lost person amen they're just falling falling you think you think oh they'll a lot a lot of times people would think they'll walk away from jesus and i'll just be a good person you won't you will start falling and one thing will lead to another and you'll just tumble over and over and again and he said i saw a star flow from heaven to the earth and him was given the key and he opened the bottom split and there rose they smoke out of the pit so out of this pit comes a smoke now smoke is a is a blinding you can kill people with smoke a lot of times it isn't the fire that ever gets to them it makes their death it's the smoke [Music] it deprives them of their oxygen and the smoke when smoke gets into the house what happens it gets into every fabric your house catches on fire it isn't just oh well we'll repair the walls and whatever your furniture smells like smoke your your curtains are smoky your we your the walls that wouldn't burn or all have suitable everything's a mess it's con everything's contaminated amen somebody hear me preach amen so he opens the bottomless pit and smoke comes out it's a blinding delusion don't you understand this is why even our president would come out and say fake news because why there's a spirit of delusion nobody knows what is the truth you know somebody sent me a a an article the other day and you know every person that gets this shot they all have are having symptoms of my mycardia and they're dying and they're going to die and all this how do i know that's right or wrong how do you know whether it's right or wrong one say well there's nothing to it another scenario something to it and then we're all divided so you know again you know it's a it's a strong delusion there's confusion everywhere people don't know what to believe and the devil will do everything to bring a delusion to take you off course amen and the bible said the son that's christ the word and the air atmosphere is darkened by the reason of the smoke out of hell so it blocks out the light of the word it blocks out the atmosphere of the holy ghost amen amen amen it permeates every crack and crevice of humanity amen we are here at this junction [Music] we're here right where fire is is about to fall i want you to turn with me as we hold our thought here to this revelation nine and one and two until i go to second thessalonians two and ten and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness have you ever seen a such a time where truth is blocked amen have you i i'm going to get into it in just a moment but you know if you truth now is judged on whether you are favorable to what's said social media has its way of blocking what it that once said you know even the fact-finders there they are biased in their fact-finding to where you can't even believe they're fact-finding are you with me it's all under with uh with deceivableness and unrighteousness in them that perish look exactly what we have had now nearly 2 000 years of twisting the gospel twisting the message a man until it's deceivable of unrighteousness in them that perish because they did not receive the love of the truth here's the thing if you're going to do anything seek the love of the truth i don't mean the love to be right i'm talking about the love of truth god is truth and when you get the love of god in you then it doesn't matter what everybody else has said you give the word of god preeminence [Applause] all deceivingness of unrighteousness and them to perish because they receive not the love of the truth that they might be delivered saved and for this cross and for this reason because they did not truly seek christ god shall send them a strong delusion that they should believe a lie that is the whole premise of what is going on in the world today to get you to believe a lie mr biden don't want to take credit for the inflation and the price at the pump he said putin did that he wants you to believe the lie he wants to point away from the truth he even will take the things that are obvious to get you to believe a lot the lion is coming into every form here the other day in our courts in california they decided that a bumblebee was a fish that just happened in the news a bumblebee is now a fish because he is going to be protected under a certain law for our environmental reasoning and so we just change we just change a bumblebee into a fish so when you go out and you see the bumblebees flying around you can try to eat a fish that's a fish insanity doesn't stop anywhere in new york the high court is is receiving to make a decision on whether an elephant is a human that is in the supreme court and you in new york the case is up before them right now i'm not making this up but you know whether and they're going to decide whether i mean they can do it they can decide whether a man is a female or a male people can decide now a kid can go to school and and require a little a litter box because he identifies or she identifies as a cat and you better not tell it you better not tell it you're not a cat get up and sit down quit meowing you're human you see it's a strong delusion it's a spirit of insanity and it's satan's mind that is being pressed into the world the spirits come that have been released and given permission to come into this age and our kids are coming up against sin our yell our youths our our parents everybody every every part of it listen they shall receive a strong delusion and believe a lie it is a lie to say that a boy is a girl it is a lie to say a girl is a boy well they identified they you cannot identify you well we're not identifying a a bumblebee as a fish and an elephant is a human it is a bottomless pit and a strong delusion and the mind of satan coming down oh my goodness church don't you realize how important it is that you have the mind of christ in this day and hour that the supernatural one is revealing itself to you amen look at this that they might be damned who believe not the truth but add pleasure and unrighteousness those who have pleasure unrighteousness are taken on a spirit of insanity and verse 3 of revelation 9 there came out of that delusion spirits locusts upon the earth and to them was given power as the scorpions of the earth have power and they command it it was commanded them they should not hurt the grass of the earth nor any green thing nor any tree so you see it's not trees it's not it's not green things watch what it is but only those men which have not the seal of god in their forehead so you can see its demons and he said they're going to attack men not green things men and these men are men who don't have the seal of god in their forehead you see to reject the mind the mind of god the holy ghost is to take the mark of the beast and here he comes now and and here he comes to afflict those who does not have the seal this is why children without the seal you're going to be cutting yourself suicide spirits pornography slaves to video games and every other thing why why because you didn't get the seal of god only the seal of god is going to protect you in this hour [Music] it's the spirit of insanity and we're getting worse and the bible said it was given to them that they should not kill them but should torment them for five months and and the torment was the torment of a scorpion that's when he's striking a man so he said it's not something that really kills you it's something that torments you and in those days men shall seek death and shall not find and shall desire to die and death shall flee from me you say brother tim this is tribulation stuff listen we are in pre-tribulation times already the smoke is already filtering into homes into churches into the fabric of humanity look let's go to ii thessalonians 2 and 3. let no man deceive you for any by any means for that day shall not come except there come now falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition so we now know the son of perdition is to be revealed he opposes and exalts himself all above all that is called called god or that is worship so that he is god sitteth in the temple of god showing himself that he is god look what happens now there is no giving god preeminence it is opposing it exalted oneself over all that is called god and worshiping self amen and there is never been a day like laodicea of people's rights where that's where that sin is exalted and people's rights the rights to do anything wrong [Music] listen they're not satisfied with millions of abortions they want to be able to still abort kids after they're born they're talking about one month then three months and then three years up to three years why because self is being glorified more about me my body my rights myself the mystery of iniquity the spirit of lawlessness we are in the days in this junction of a spirit of lawlessness has been released where sin is glorified we're convicts and and murders and bad people are exalted while our our police is defunded where are where where protection is taken away from from good people and protection is given to bad people and instead of incarcerating them put them in jail and keeping them there and keeping the rest of the public safe let them all go where do you get all this insanity yet it's filled in the highest of our officials in the greatest areas of learning they made a plan years ago years ago we're going to we're going to raise up we're not just coming out of the closet we're going to raise up we will be the teachers in the school we will be the principals we will be there on the school board we will force our agenda in the colleges we will change the minds of generations the smoke is going everywhere and if you ain't careful christians smell like it and christians get blinded by it and homes where things were not once tolerated i get bind to it and churches and pastors are blinded by it amen the mystery of iniquity the spirit of lawlessness doth already work only he who letteth will let in him till he be taken away you know brother branham explained that scripture and he said he and he said until he the holy spirit is taken away and he said hey and he said it's the holy spirit in the bride so let me tell you when the bride leaves from here we just sing the song on sea and land he stands a book is in his hands well you know we we had the picture with the sign in the heavens of the cloud some people don't want to identify with that but it was a sign that christ was coming amen there was a lot of been a lot of confusion about it but let me just tell you it was a sign that they still cannot explain amen that they have no explanation no scientific explanation for whatsoever but it was formed in the heavens to show that christ was here he was coming in word form to a prophet and just before that brother branham goes for the opening of the seals there this sign is shown in the heavens to show us she said brother tim it's it was done by rocket listen they cannot they they they are not able after all they're trying to cannot they cannot they do not have any explanation even after 50 years and they're the books are now open and the mysteries are all supposed to be released of all their secrets they still have no answer but i say if it even was a man-made event if it was caused by a rocket tell me what other age that this supernatural age could ever do this 100 years ago we're the same mind we're the same man we're the same people do you know you are living in a supernatural age things that are beyond natural capabilities no other age you are speaking a language none of them would understand you are doing things that other ages if they even dreamed about it was just a it was just a laughing joke it was a funny papers [Music] come on am i we are living in a very supernatural time but what i'm trying to say on land and sea he said why why did we just see the head and the heavens why didn't this show why did you just show the whole body because his body's on earth he christ is in the heavens but he's got a body on earth and on sea and land he stands a book is in his hand amen do you know there are two beasts a beast of rome that comes out of the sea multitudes and kindreds and tongues and people and another out of the land where america come from and god has by this message put your foot is somebody with me right now your foot right now is on the beast of the sea rome her trinity doctrines her worship of saints her worship of mary and god put your feet on the top of that beast that beast that killed millions of your brothers that beast that distorted truth for oh how many ages but you got your foot on it a message did that amen christ did that amen that anointing did that the supernatural did that the omnipotence of god did that and out of here is an american spirit hollywood and god has put your foot on hollywood and they're moving and the voice of sin and the evil and you've got your feet on both of them they are listen if that is under your feet every devil is under your feet if that's what your big pantry is under your fingers if that's under your feet stand about kind of under your feet if that's under your feet [Music] hallelujah do you realize what we're talking about wow this place [Applause] thank you brother johnny i'm going to got a little bit further to go we're at a junction now the mystery or the spirit of lawlessness does already work and he who now letteth will let until she brother branham said is taken out of the way because that's where he is is in bright form so when these feet are lifted up then them beasts rise into power so you ain't seen nothing yet as to what's coming you think things are bad now just wait till the bride leaves and satan is cast down remember it was abraham's voice of intercession that was holding the wrath of god back is that right amen it was it was abraham pleading lord now look look you see the spirit of abraham the spirit is a abraham isn't let him all die god all of them everyone in sodom against servant of died lord he left my church he walked off from me he left there let them all die god i want to see them in hell abraham said if there's 50. if see the spirit of christ if there's 40 if there's 30 if there's 20 is there's 10. he bargained with god hold it off do you know as he bargained he was holding back those angels that's right now ii thessalonians 2 and 7 for the mystery of iniquity doth already work now he that letteth will let till he be taken away as the holy spirit lifts from the earth the bride goes with him and then shall that wicked be revealed whom the lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming because he's coming back in revelation 19 with his saints but let me just tell you why we're here brother brandon said the souls that are in prison let me tell you something sister just a minute you might be old-fashioned but you got something these sex queens hasn't got you got something she can never have you might you might be old-fashioned in your dressing dress up like a lady they say look at that old holy roller don't you worry she's got something on those sex queen that's got all the world looking at her out there she hasn't got she can never have it she has lost eternally she's doomed you got morals you got virtues she's got nothing she's got a bait that traps the lost souls into hell the blind walks into it and now you've got something he's actually quoting proverbs you know you might not even be on a church book you but it might be your righteous life that is holding the wrath of god from the world today the world don't believe it you know you woman that's called holy roller you little man that don't hardly know anything but you cry to god day and night for the sins of the country you might be the one holding off the wrath if i can find 10 i'll spare it if i can find 10 as it was in the days of sodom and so celebrity you see what i mean don't you realize it's you that's holding it back amen but when the bride is raptured out of here oh hell will break loose and we're already seeing it press in amen revelation 12 12 therefore rejoice you heavens and you that dwell in him that's the bride woe to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea for the devil is come down unto you heaven but uh having great wrath because he knoweth he had but a short time three and a half years this is what happened in uvalde texas a kid gave voice to the mystery of iniquity you think laws keep him out of this out of there did laws prevent him from getting a gun did laws do anything you know first thing you do it does shoots his grandma and then goes on a rampage the spirit of lawlessness what happened in minneapolis with george floyd the mystery of iniquity is now being revealed the mind of satan 25 americans you know killed during the riots and looting and guess who was glorified guess who was vilified the law amen i mean you know a man convicted of eight crimes stopped by police charged 19 times during his adult life and the act of doing another passing a counterfeit fit bill resisted arrest with drugs in his body guess who was glorified guess who was defunded you know why because sin has a voice and it's sodom it screams louder than the righteous you see the righteous lot was trying to reason with but they were screaming louder than he was and yes we have righteous people in america sometimes a good politician once in a while it ain't bought off but you know who whatever as i say about louisiana we got the best politicians money can buy but nevertheless you know you you know again you know they're those righteous those that are righteous that's got a smidgen of righteousness left you know the voice of sin and the voice of sodom is louder than any righteous voice the spirit of the lawlessness is rampant in our nation it's the force behind the legislation that seeks to banish god for from our society you know i don't know if you saw the new quarters that are there but you know it used to be george washington looking toward the phrase in god we trust they've they've they've taken that and turned it around this year now he's looking away his back is on god no longer does he trust in god it is assigned to america we don't trust and know god anymore now satan is using you know like in the days a lot the voice of sodom drowning out the voice of righteous lock keeping them from having a voice you don't have a voice amen you know and the voices the voice screams out back to you every time that you try to rebuke sin you have the right to judge us you have no right to judge us we do have a right to judge amen i said we do have a right to judge we're to judge between right and wrong of course we don't send sins condemn somebody to hell we can't do that nobody can but we do have a right to judge evil and call see them seeing and wrong wrong and right right everybody you your parents have got a right to judge in your home when you go and your kids there and and there there's every kind of black and evil and every kind of picture of evil and all kinds of things you have a right as a parent to go in that room and say we are not having this trash in our house we do not worship rock and roll we don't worship the devil and we're not going to have a sign of him here amen you see satan using the same lie on the on the believers today day after day convincing masses of believers that you can sin without paying any penalty scheme for to pro uh to pervert the gospel of grace let me tell you friends when you get the holy ghost it changes your desire you no longer willingly sin willfully sin you know at first you know people will just wink at it you know but it's a strong delusion and then they'll actually begin to actively seek out a message of what i call greasy grace or easy grace are you with me amen oh it's the grace of god this is favor god loves us god don't care god don't get god cares he's a righteous god amen he's a righteous judge but you see they'll invent a grace that is far beyond what god ever intended god now his grace never leads says he gives us a license to sin but the grace of god always leads to repentance that's what grace does it doesn't cover your sin it leads you to repentance of sin so the blood of jesus can annihilate it amen let me just as we're trying to close but did you know that brother ron spencer was contacted by his insurer the other day an insurance agency and an insurance company their church has had for over 30 years and and i'm just going to say it like this he told him he could not use his insurer his agent said you cannot use the word the h word in your pulpit anymore are you lose your insurance he can use sodom and gomorrah but not the h word why it's the time where the voice of iniquity and the man of sin is being manifest it's where the man of sin the spirit of lawlessness is now what's being put out there did you know another of our pastors was censored the other day and his service that was being streamed on foot on social media was cut off because he said from the pulpit the h word do you know that with our supreme court justices with their with their homes being picketed and riots it's just like sodom who demanded the angels who appeared as men to have sex with them and they refused virgin girls that was offered to them you see they're giving voice to the man of sin they are giving voice to sodom do you know when a supreme court nominee cannot define a woman i'm not a biologist i can't divide a woman she has given voice to sodom in the highest court of our land do you know when boys dress effeminate and girls masculine they are giving voice to sodom amen do you know they're doing it with their hairdos and with their dress it is a voice it is more than something cute it is a voice of sodom do you know when the holy ghost the token comes upon your life it'll make a girl feminine and a man masculine the holy ghost will do that amen do you know this is the most important time ever to be given voice to righteousness at this junction we dare not give sodom a voice we must give voice to the holy ghost to righteousness revelation 9 and 7. and the shapes of these locusts were like horses prepared to battle and uh listen it's a war there's a war there's a battle there's a there's a battle there's a fight for our young people there's a fight for our homes yeah there's a fight for our churches there's a fight for this pulpit do you hear what i'm saying there's a voice that must come out and it must be the voice of god we are giving them to we cannot get bent to sodom or else we're part of the bottomless pit the shapes of the locusts were like and the horses prepared into battle and the heads were like crowns of gold and their faces like the faces of men and they had hair as the hair of women and their teeth were teeth and lions and when our boys wear our hair wear their hair like women and our and our girls dare cut them off like men what kind of spirit are you giving voice to and they had breastplates as breastplates of iron oh they got a defense and they get sound of their wings is a sound of chariots of many horses powers running to battle isn't one demon these are millions of devils and they had tails like scorpions and there was stings in their tails and their power was to hurt men five months and they had a king over them you see all of these spirits are ruled by the devil amen and if you give bit to that and voice to it you too are ruled by the devil you become one of his army but i want to say we are of a different army hallelujah look they had a king over them which is the ikea the angel of the bottomless pit whose name in the hebrew is about with the but the greek term is appalling one woe is passed behold there's two more woes here here after and the six angel sounded and i heard a voice of from four horns of the golden altar which is from before god saying to the six angels which had the trumpet loose the four angels which are bound in the great river euphrates and the four angels were loosed and were prepared for hour a day a month and a year to slay the third part of men and the number of the horsemen the army of the horsemen were this innumerable number two hundred thousand thousand and i heard the number of them and thus i saw the horses in the vision and them that sat on them having breastplates of fire and jason and brimstone and and all of these are elements of the bottomless pit brimstone breastplates of fire out of their mouth issued fire smoke and brimstone and three by these three were the third part of men killed by the fire by the smoke by the brimstone which issued out of their mouth and for their power is in their mouth and in their tails for their tails were like in the surface which had heads and with them they do hurt there wasn't natural horses notice these are natural horses you're thinking you're thinking natural natural nights or these are supernatural demons and there the tail looked like a serpent snake's head on the end stinging spiritual horses spiritual devils chargers they've been bound in euphrates all of these years supernatural devils brother brown said what was in the old roman empire being revived revived the persecution of the jews and then we had those four eichmann and hitler and stalin and mussolini those four that rose up angels out of the bottomless pit men who were anointed with devils you get eichmann there standing right there blow a little jewish kid little child blow his brains out and then they standing too close and white callously just wiped the brains off of his coat how could this happen without men becoming demonic devil possessed held down by demon powers and that is the spirit that has been released in this last day and it come against the jews because they are trying to get back to eden again and it comes against sobriety in an ecclesiastical manner with every kind of demon anointing coming against her to keep her out of the promised land is somebody with me now amen you see it was a religious sect that could not go to the other side but you think they will repent they won't repent they've already crossed the line there's no going back for them you think americans can't repent america can't repent you think the world will repent the world can't repent that's right revelation 9 20 and the rest of these men was not killed by the plagues i want you to see it there was no spirit of repentance no apologies no remorse that they they which were killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands that they should not worship devils and idols of gold and silver and brass and stone and wood which can neither see or hear or walk and that's how revelation 9 ends neither repented they are their murders nor of their sorceries nor of their fornications gnar of their thefts unrepented men who will not turn around who have spurned their day of grace possessed by demon powers demon spirits can i go just a little further insanity perversion they've taken over our colleges they're taking over our schools they've taken over our politics right now in our nations the second amendment is under attack spirit of lawlessness wanting to strip our country of its rights to defend from tyranny our president said we don't want we shouldn't own a gun like that we shouldn't have this you know we don't need that to to to to to stop a robbery in our home that's not what the second amendment's about the second amendment is about protecting ourselves from a tyranny from a government that is running wild that's why that we have the right to bear arms but they want to disarm our country and they will satan wants to disarm you hear me now i'm bringing this right around now satan wants to disarm you you see he wants to remove the omnipotent power of the word and leave you something less than a baseball bat or you know some some little something to try to protect yourself and where there's no power in the word there's no divine healing there's no miracles there's no signs and wonders there's no praise there's no shadow of the king there's nothing in it because satan wants to disarm the bride of jesus christ and it's our inalienable right it is our right to have divine healing it is our right to have the holy ghost it is our right to have the power of god it is our right to have delivered from sin it is our right but i want to just close this morning and say we are not defenseless [Applause] hallelujah we're not leaving out of here a weak and powerless but the people we are leaving out here on the power of omnipotence somebody hear me preach right now amen we came to the end of revelation 9. i want to start with the next verse the next verse is revelation 10 and and joins nine and ten together and says but the story goes on and i saw another mighty angel hallelujah i can show you the insanity i can show you the spirit of the enemy i can show you the mystery of iniquity the spirit of the law but let's look away from that right now i want to show you another mighty angel hallelujah another mighty angel

darkness come up a people who are satan is under your feet come on musicians right quick think of this right now and while while all of this has been going on of all these demon powers being released the holy spirit has been bound by the doors of creeds and dogmas that's why you needed the end time message to release the holy ghost back to the church again the holy ghost is released to do its work and i saw another mighty angel not a weak angel a mighty angel amen a powerful angel an abdominal angel and he's the one present this morning you're not alone you are not by yourself amen but you are
