[0:05] hi everybody
[0:07] great to join again with you today and
[0:10] we are the ministry team evening like
[0:13] Tabernacle and we have our church here
[0:17] in Minden Louisiana we're happy that you
[0:19] have joined with us today and we hope
[0:22] you'll let your friends know that we're
[0:24] online and and speaking today and we're
[0:29] going to be talking about how the church
[0:33] fell away from its original condition
[0:36] there that as they received on the day
[0:39] of Pentecost the Holy Ghost and and the
[0:42] Upper Room what a wonderful experience
[0:44] that was but then how that falling away
[0:48] is not simply a an endtime event is been
[0:53] happening now for many many years
[0:55] and this is why a restoration is so
[0:59] needed and promised I'd like to start
[1:03] with a scripture today where Paul said
[1:06] in second Thessalonians two and three
[1:09] let no man deceive you by any means for
[1:12] that day shall not come except there be
[1:16] a fallen away first and that man of sin
[1:20] be revealed the son of perdition who
[1:23] opposes and exalteth himself above all
[1:27] that is called God or that is worshipped
[1:30] so that he as God sitteth in the temple
[1:33] of God showing himself that He is God I
[1:37] think we noted last time that Paul said
[1:40] that they would receive a another Jesus
[1:43] another gospel in another spirit so this
[1:47] would not be Satan in the church saying
[1:50] I am Satan and people worshipping as
[1:52] Satan but rather he would be
[1:55] masquerading as Jesus presenting himself
[1:58] as the the one who actually crucem was
[2:03] crucified gave his life and and
[2:06] many of the concepts of Jesus will be
[2:08] priests but it would be perverted enough
[2:11] that it would be a perverted gospel
[2:13] because that's what Satan likes to do
[2:17] Satan has always always been in
[2:21] religious deception from the very
[2:24] beginning and his ambition throughout
[2:28] the ages has always been to be
[2:30] worshipped like it says that I say a14 I
[2:33] will exalt myself above all that is
[2:35] called God I will be like the Most High
[2:38] I I and that was his desire before the
[2:43] Garden of Eden and there was a war in
[2:46] heaven with Michael the Archangel and
[2:48] that has that ambition has never left
[2:52] just like the scripture that you're
[2:53] reading that his desire was to be
[2:57] worshipped and so from the beginning of
[3:00] time we see Cain and Abel and Cain is
[3:04] not an atheist Cain is religious right
[3:08] and they come out of the same household
[3:11] they're worshiping the same God and but
[3:16] but Cain refuses to worship God's
[3:19] provided way which was blood right and
[3:22] then we see that there's an Ishmaelite
[3:25] in Isaac both from the line of Abraham
[3:29] mmm but one is of God one is a
[3:32] persecutor of the like just like Cain
[3:34] was a persecutor right there's a nice
[3:37] all and a Jacob and Jake now in that
[3:40] case Esau looks like the better guy
[3:44] because he loves his daddy he's bringing
[3:46] him meat but the difference was Jacobs
[3:50] heart was set on the birthright right I
[3:52] will have murder I've got to have the
[3:54] birthright and Esau despised it and
[3:57] that's why the Bible refers to it is
[3:59] that God hated Esau because he despised
[4:03] the birthright of mine but they come out
[4:05] of the same household all the way down
[4:09] through the ages there were two trees in
[4:10] the garden right there was Judas and
[4:13] Jesus and this is striking because Judas
[4:16] is out of the same tribe
[4:18] he's in the inner circle of Jesus and
[4:20] he's the treasurer of the church MA and
[4:22] he has a manifested Ministry of the
[4:25] supernatural casting out of devils and
[4:28] and he comes right out but when he comes
[4:32] to Pentecost he shows his colors so it
[4:34] just shows it's kind of been twins all
[4:36] along down along their mouths winds all
[4:38] the way through yeah the right and the
[4:41] wrong the the this sort of good seed in
[4:44] the soul of bad seed and so on all the
[4:46] way down so you know as Paul said it
[4:50] that there would come a falling away
[4:52] first he calling the man of sin the son
[4:56] of perdition which speaks like Judas
[4:59] he's a betrayer he opposes and exalts
[5:02] himself I think these are key words
[5:05] exalts himself above all that is called
[5:08] God so he puts himself up above
[5:11] everything and then our that is
[5:14] worshipped and that he as God sitteth in
[5:17] the temple of God showing himself that
[5:20] He is God
[5:21] so actually then what Paul says is that
[5:25] Satan would actually take over the
[5:28] church and be worshipped right within
[5:31] the framework of the Christian children
[5:34] and none of it called God by surprise no
[5:37] no he knew this is gonna happen and
[5:39] that's why Paul can say grievious wolves
[5:41] are gonna come that's what he knew this
[5:43] is gonna and they and then he says right
[5:44] there and second Thessalonians 2 and 7
[5:48] for the mystery of iniquity doth already
[5:50] work yeah he already you would spiritual
[5:54] discernment could see that other spirit
[5:56] the other twin working there in the
[5:58] framework of the church of course it
[6:00] comes to head in the end time right you
[6:03] know were these things that happen in
[6:05] seed form becomes manifested in the
[6:07] harvest time and in them in a multiplied
[6:10] way and so you know yes but the iniquity
[6:14] mystery of iniquity already was working
[6:17] in the early church it said Paul said
[6:20] that in the last days they would be
[6:23] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[6:25] god trucebreakers false accusers
[6:27] despisers of those that are good having
[6:29] a form of godliness there you go
[6:33] but denying the power which would be the
[6:35] life of the vine that we spoke of in the
[6:37] last session denying the power their
[6:39] from such turn away the the deception
[6:43] that Satan brought was a lot like 'if he
[6:50] started out in religious conversation
[6:51] hath God said yeah and so he just
[6:56] twisted the word slightly right to bring
[7:00] 6,000 years of human misery upon the
[7:03] human race so let me let me pose this
[7:05] question here for first the second
[7:07] Thessalonians 2 and 4 because it's in
[7:11] your Bible it's in your Bible it's in
[7:13] your Bible and it's in every
[7:14] denominational Bible that believes it
[7:16] please in Christ but he's sitting in a
[7:19] temple of God so what does that mean it
[7:21] they're reading the same scripture that
[7:23] we're reading are their eyes blinded to
[7:26] what this scripture is truly saying
[7:27] because our eyes have been enlightened
[7:29] we can see who it is it clearly tells us
[7:33] so why I mean he's sitting in the temple
[7:35] of God showing himself that He is God
[7:38] he's sitting in a church he's convincing
[7:41] them he's God's in them that he is God
[7:44] that this is the true Jesus and it's not
[7:47] the Jesus of the Bible
[7:48] it's the Jesus of people's own making
[7:51] and if you were if you look at you know
[7:54] for example one church they will have a
[7:58] Jesus and the Jesus that they met you
[8:02] know I like to think of it this way in
[8:04] the beginning God made man now man wants
[8:10] to make go right exactly and so he wants
[8:12] a God that He desires he's gonna make
[8:16] him the way he wants him and so you know
[8:19] certain theologians made a God that this
[8:23] God has to mind his mother so you pray
[8:26] to the Virgin Mary and who to prays to
[8:30] his her son and her son prays to his
[8:33] father
[8:34] and you know you the the the the son has
[8:38] to do what his mama tells him to do that
[8:42] is a God that has been crafted by
[8:46] theologians yet it is being preached in
[8:49] the temple of God portrayed as Jesus but
[8:53] it's not Jesus at all then there's
[8:55] another God for example um this God
[8:59] doesn't care how you're baptized or if
[9:02] you're baptized if you're immersed are
[9:05] if you're sprinkled you know it doesn't
[9:09] really matter to this God so you know
[9:11] every denomination makes their own God
[9:14] and it's not a God of the Bible but it's
[9:17] one of their own makin and they cracked
[9:20] him by their certain favorite scriptures
[9:23] rather than taking the whole Word of God
[9:26] and presenting the gospel of Jesus
[9:29] Christ
[9:29] now that's what I think so that's how we
[9:31] got 41,000 that's how we got holding
[9:33] 1,000 and there again it's not someone
[9:37] standing there with horns and a
[9:39] pitchfork there's a Satan disguised as
[9:42] an angel of light
[9:43] it's deception you know in Jesus as a
[9:46] scripture I just wanna interject here
[9:47] just it says Jesus talked about the
[9:50] light of the body and talking about
[9:51] darkness he said but take heed therefore
[9:53] that the light which is in thee be not
[9:57] darkness so I mean it's showing right
[10:00] there that he's light showing himself to
[10:03] be like Satan is showing himself
[10:04] reliably yet he's darkness all the time
[10:07] uh-huh if we're not careful would be
[10:09] deceived thinking it's light is God
[10:11] looks like God you know got a it's a
[10:15] church I mean it's not that it's
[10:17] ministers or right or his angels or
[10:19] ministers of life right yes yes but it's
[10:21] darkness there's no ass yeah well that
[10:24] first church jesus said man shall not
[10:26] live by bread alone but by every word
[10:28] that proceedeth out of the mouth of god
[10:30] that first church lived by the word
[10:31] that's right and this is what Satan is
[10:34] trying to get out of the grips of the
[10:36] church by by devaluing the word by
[10:43] substituting man's ideas for God and
[10:46] Jesus said it you
[10:47] by your traditions make the Word of God
[10:49] of a matter of fact right because the
[10:51] word the gospel will have an effect upon
[10:53] people right yeah
[10:55] upon souls and so Satan knows just a
[10:58] little leaven will contaminate the whole
[11:00] Satan knows that he can just slightly
[11:03] twist into men's programs and then we're
[11:07] powerless
[11:07] we're sitting powerless so that tells me
[11:10] that Satan is a great preacher yes I
[11:13] mean he's a great teacher with a warning
[11:16] is always if he comes preaching
[11:19] something different a lot of times it
[11:21] puts the warning on preachers it says
[11:24] that in 2nd Corinthians 11 for for if he
[11:26] that cometh preacheth another Jesus so
[11:30] this is someone with the ministry yeah
[11:32] it is increasing or not another Jesus
[11:34] now this is what Paul saying we've over
[11:36] and over again said that the book of
[11:38] Acts church is our pattern and Paul just
[11:41] comes right out and said it he preaches
[11:43] another Jesus whom we have not preached
[11:45] anything different at all or if you
[11:48] receive another spirit which ye have not
[11:50] received or another gospel which you
[11:53] just spoke of one that's crafted by man
[11:55] which ye have not accepted you might
[11:58] well bear with him so a lot of times
[12:01] that we were not to be looking outside
[12:03] the church walls for the deception no
[12:06] it's inside the church a lot of people
[12:09] think you know this the Beast is gonna
[12:10] be some great machine or whatever the
[12:13] the Antichrist is a spirit and it is and
[12:16] it works within the framework of the
[12:19] church bringing the deception if we go
[12:21] back to what you said a lot of go
[12:23] brother Craig you know Paul said it
[12:26] himself about about and referred back to
[12:30] Eve he said I am jealous over you with a
[12:33] godly jealousy for I have espoused you
[12:37] to one husband that I might present you
[12:39] as a chaste virgin to Christ so here
[12:43] here was his desire to to have one that
[12:45] was a chaste virgin but he said I fear
[12:49] lest by any means as the serpent
[12:51] beguiled Eve through his subtlety so
[12:56] your minds should be corrupted from the
[12:58] complicity that's in Christ so as you
[13:01] said he come saying yea hath God said he
[13:04] didn't come
[13:05] he didn't come sayin you know you know
[13:08] I'm the devil or I'm the Serpent and I'm
[13:10] out here to deceive you he come with yea
[13:13] hath God said and he comes bringing a
[13:16] part of the word but not all of the word
[13:19] and with this he brings a deception and
[13:22] Christ his own God and so he made it God
[13:26] to Eve like all surely God wouldn't do
[13:29] that so automatically he began to start
[13:32] crafting God into something that and may
[13:37] God into something different than what
[13:39] His Word said and answer what the Bible
[13:41] tells us to earnestly earnestly
[13:44] fervently contend for the faith that was
[13:46] once delivered yes so that original
[13:48] truth things you can from it so you can
[13:50] rightly divide the spirit and discern
[13:52] the spirit and know which is truth and
[13:54] which is not and just broke that thirty
[13:57] is about thirty years after the founding
[13:59] of the church so we're just thirty years
[14:01] later and he's having to say you got to
[14:03] contend for the faith which was once
[14:05] delivered in other words what people are
[14:08] believing what people are preaching is
[14:09] not what was delivered disaster but
[14:12] consultants chainsaws already something
[14:14] that's happening and exactly yeah just a
[14:17] short years and you're saying this is
[14:19] the falling away is the beginning this
[14:21] was the beginning of the falling away of
[14:24] the first church yeah exactly
[14:26] well once step away from the words is
[14:28] step away from Christ actly right and so
[14:30] you know there's one step and so is is
[14:33] it's just like shooting a target you
[14:36] know you're you you've got to be lined
[14:39] up and to be able to hit that target and
[14:42] and what people have done today is they
[14:44] want to move the target rather than you
[14:47] know line line up with the word of God
[14:50] yes it's hard to this door but they want
[14:52] to move the target in order to
[14:54] compensate for their beliefs
[14:56] we know the serpent changed one word
[14:59] with that's all
[15:00] what is one word yeah so in your analogy
[15:02] he wasn't off by a lot now you know dude
[15:05] writing this they may have not been
[15:07] Alton false doctrine but one step away
[15:10] he's saying you know he's looking at
[15:12] going we can't do that
[15:13] looking at the scripture what Paul is
[15:14] written saying that there's anything
[15:16] different yeah don't don't hear that and
[15:19] he's looking at it and that's 30 years
[15:20] after the founding of the church where
[15:22] are we at two thousand years later if it
[15:24] was all this much there the further it
[15:26] goes the further it goes the further
[15:28] away from the truth it's gotten that
[15:30] that's really good and and it's actually
[15:36] astounding to think of it in that way
[15:37] that a step away from the word is a step
[15:41] away from God because we cannot worship
[15:43] God apart from the work Jesus said we
[15:46] must worship in spirit and in truth
[15:48] right so to be anti word is to be
[15:52] Antichrist
[15:53] exactly exactly like the only way to
[15:55] worship God in spirit and in truth is to
[15:59] worship Him by the word like the first
[16:02] church like Jesus taught us so without
[16:05] the word you find yourself in the
[16:07] congregation that we were speaking of
[16:09] earlier with Satan showing himself as
[16:11] God that's where you're worshiping I
[16:14] think without the power the Holy Spirit
[16:16] in our lives that can help us see the
[16:18] word and discern the word that's where
[16:20] we find ourselves right that's why the
[16:21] baptism of the Holy Ghost is so
[16:23] essential it's the air belt oh yeah I
[16:26] mean it's the life of Christ Russ the
[16:28] life of the vine in the branch right and
[16:31] I think that's that's what's missing in
[16:33] a lot of churches otherwise we would all
[16:36] be a part of the same body man right
[16:38] yeah I mean you know the the power is
[16:42] gone the freedom of the Holy Spirit is
[16:44] gone the the you know even even that
[16:48] which would bring our morals and
[16:51] convictions and whatever is being lost
[16:54] in the society that we're living in yet
[16:56] we call ourself a Christian nation yeah
[16:59] yeah have a form of godliness oh yeah a
[17:02] point before we have a conversation or a
[17:05] conversion which saying Lord Lord
[17:07] profession yeah but you lack the power
[17:09] which leads to so many statements of oh
[17:12] whoa we're all sinners or we all send a
[17:15] little bit denying the pie
[17:17] the Holy Spirit to live in overcoming
[17:19] life's a victorious life and and yes we
[17:24] all were sinners but there was there has
[17:27] to be that change to where that we're no
[17:30] longer you know out practicing sin
[17:34] exactly but but yet holiness and
[17:37] godliness and purity is being lived
[17:40] through our lovely men and and so this
[17:43] is this is really a cop out today you
[17:46] know oh well we're just all sinners you
[17:48] know well yeah I lie yeah I mean I I
[17:51] cuss yeah I mean well I drink a little
[17:54] yeah we fornicate or you shack up or
[17:58] whatever the condition of the world is
[18:00] but we're all sinners well you know I
[18:03] want to tell the the people that there
[18:05] is a gospel yes that will change your
[18:07] life right and will change you from a
[18:10] life of sin to make you an overcomer and
[18:13] have a victorious life in this slide
[18:16] over the millennium right now that you
[18:20] can live a victorious life as he said
[18:23] even to the last age to him that
[18:25] overcometh as he says to every age to
[18:28] him that over somebody's gonna overcome
[18:31] today somebody's gonna be victorious and
[18:33] somebody is gonna stand for truth amen
[18:36] immediately and god bless you as we lie
[18:39] down this session will look a little
[18:42] deeper into this and see how the early
[18:44] church lost his first love thank you for
