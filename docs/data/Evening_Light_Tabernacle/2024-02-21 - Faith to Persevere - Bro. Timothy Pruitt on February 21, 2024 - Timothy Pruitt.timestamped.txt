[43:30] grievously vexed with the devil but he
[43:33] answered her not a word and the
[43:35] disciples came and besought him saying
[43:38] send her away for she crith after us but
[43:42] he answered and said I'm not sent but
[43:44] unto the lost sheep of the House of
[43:46] Israel then came she and worshiped him
[43:49] saying Lord help me but he answered and
[43:52] said it is not meat to take the
[43:54] children's bread and cast C it to dogs
[43:57] and she said truth Lord yet the dogs eat
[44:00] the crumbs which fall from the master's
[44:03] table then Jesus answered and said unto
[44:05] her oh woman great is thy faith be it
[44:08] unto thee even as thou Wilt and her
[44:11] daughter was made whole from that very
[44:14] hour amen we'll let you be
[44:18] seated amen I want to speak to you on
[44:21] faith to
[44:22] persevere amen Faith to persevere look
[44:26] looking at the meaning of
[44:28] perseverance it says it's an continued
[44:31] effort to do or achieve something
[44:35] despite the difficulties and failures or
[44:38] the
[44:39] opposition it's the action or cont or
[44:43] condition or an instance of
[44:46] persevering amen a
[44:49] steadfastness and you know I I got to
[44:51] look and we know the CH the faith
[44:53] chapters Hebrews chapter 11 and and I I
[44:56] I just got to look at on uh different
[44:59] times the Bible spoke about perseverance
[45:02] and I found it pretty interesting to me
[45:04] that at the end of Hebrews chapter 10
[45:07] and then at the beginning of Hebrews
[45:08] chapter 12 it would actually be a theme
[45:11] that Paul had on
[45:13] perseverance and it says here in Hebrews
[45:16] chap 10:35 it says cast not away
[45:20] therefore your confidence which has
[45:22] great recompense of reward for you have
[45:26] need of patience and this patience is
[45:28] the same word it's a steadfastness or a
[45:31] perseverance that after you have done
[45:33] the will of God you might receive the
[45:36] promise so he's saying if you don't have
[45:38] patience or you don't have perseverance
[45:41] then you're going to give up and you're
[45:42] not going to receive what you have need
[45:44] of Amen because as we talked about
[45:47] before what Jesus said when I come will
[45:49] I find find faith and and and we we we
[45:52] look at that many times at the end times
[45:54] sometimes about when it returns turns
[45:56] will he find somebody that's still
[45:57] believing but when he comes and answers
[45:59] your need or your request will he find
[46:02] you still there in faith believing amen
[46:06] that he's still going to come and answer
[46:07] your need and this is what he says here
[46:10] he said for yet a little while and he
[46:11] that shall will shall come will come and
[46:15] will not te T but now that now the just
[46:19] shall live by faith but if any man draw
[46:22] back my soul shall have no pleasure in
[46:25] him but we are not of them who draw back
[46:28] unto predition but of them that believe
[46:30] to the saving of the soul and and I I I
[46:33] want to just read that and amplify
[46:35] because I think it just brings out some
[46:37] some great points it says there again in
[46:40] chapter 10 and verse 35 it sayso not
[46:42] therefore fling away your Fearless
[46:46] confidence for it has a glorious and
[46:49] great reward for you have great need of
[46:52] patient endurance to bear under
[46:55] difficult ult circumstances without
[46:58] compromising so that when you have
[47:00] carried out the will of God you will
[47:03] receive and enjoy the full what is
[47:06] Promised for yet a little very little
[47:08] while he who is coming will come and
[47:11] will not delay but my righteous one the
[47:15] one that's justified by faith shall live
[47:19] by faith amen my righteous my righteous
[47:23] one the one justified by faith shall
[47:26] live by faith and if he draws back or
[47:29] shrinks in fear my soul has no Delight
[47:33] in him but our way is not that of those
[47:36] who shrink back to destruction but we
[47:39] are of those who believe that's amen I
[47:43] love that our way is not that of those
[47:45] who shrink back to destruction but we
[47:48] are of those who believe relying on God
[47:52] through faith in Jesus Christ and by
[47:54] this confidence in faith preserve our
[47:57] soul amen and also in Hebrews chapter 20
[48:02] chapter 12 and verse one it says
[48:04] wherefore seeing we are also comp
[48:06] compassed about with so great a cloud of
[48:08] witnesses let us lay aside every weight
[48:11] and sin which does so easily beset us
[48:14] and let us run with patience the race
[48:17] that is set before us looking unto Jesus
[48:20] the author and the finisher of our faith
[48:22] who for the joy that was set before him
[48:25] and endured the cross despising the
[48:27] shame and is sat down at the right hand
[48:29] of the Throne of God and I want to read
[48:32] again in the Amplified it says therefore
[48:33] since we are surrounded by so great a
[48:36] cloud of witnesses who by faith have
[48:39] testified to the truth of God's absolute
[48:43] faithfulness stripping off every
[48:45] unnecessary weight and the sin which so
[48:48] easily and cleverly entangles us let us
[48:51] run with endurance and active
[48:54] persistence the race that is set before
[48:57] us looking away from all that will
[48:59] distract us and focusing our eyes on
[49:02] Jesus who is the author and the
[49:04] perfector of Faith the first incentive
[49:07] of our for our belief and the one who
[49:09] brings our faith to maturity who for the
[49:12] joy of accomplishing the goal set before
[49:15] him enduring the cross disregarding the
[49:18] shame and sat down at the right hand of
[49:20] the Throne of God revealing his deity
[49:23] his authority and the completion of his
[49:26] work amen so to it's not just to have
[49:29] faith but it's to have faith that
[49:32] perseveres amen faith that holds on no
[49:35] matter what the situation is around us
[49:37] you know it's really easy to have faith
[49:39] when things are good and you're not sick
[49:41] and then there's you know plenty of
[49:43] money in the bank account but what about
[49:45] having faith amen when you're going
[49:47] through difficulties of life and and
[49:49] we're all going to go through them we
[49:50] it's a it's a struggle of life that
[49:52] we're in it's not going to get any
[49:54] easier or any better but it's going to
[49:56] get harder and harder until we cross
[49:59] over onto the other side but I believe
[50:01] there's a people that amen are not of
[50:03] those who's going to shrink back but
[50:05] they're going to be of those who's going
[50:06] to believe as going to believe no matter
[50:09] what the circumstances are no matter
[50:11] what the situation is around them no
[50:13] matter what the atmospheres are around
[50:15] them but to Stand Fast therefore in the
[50:18] calling of that God is placed in their
[50:21] life and and I read also in James 1 and
[50:24] verse 12 it says bless or happy or
[50:27] spiritually prosperous and favored by
[50:29] God is the man who is steadfast under
[50:34] trial amen steadfast under trial and
[50:37] perseveres when tempted for when he has
[50:40] passed the test and been approved he
[50:42] will receive the Crown of Life with the
[50:45] Lord has promised to those who love him
[50:47] amen so blessed or happy or spiritually
[50:50] prosperous or or favored by God as the
[50:53] man who is steadfast under a trial in
[50:56] other words when you go through a trial
[50:57] it doesn't change what you believe it
[50:59] doesn't change who you are it doesn't
[51:01] change anything about you but you you
[51:04] persevere you push through it you go
[51:06] through it no matter what I I believe we
[51:08] ought to be those kind of people amen I
[51:10] know it's very easy to kind of give up
[51:12] and put get depressed and all that kind
[51:14] of stuff that the things that we go
[51:16] through in our lives but these opport
[51:18] these things that we're going through
[51:19] only opportunities for God to test our
[51:23] faith to test if we really believe who
[51:25] he is if we we really believe he's a
[51:28] provider if we we really believe he's a
[51:30] Healer if we really believe amen if if
[51:33] our names could be written in Hebrews
[51:35] chap 11 amen if our names could be
[51:38] written there amen is by faith Enoch or
[51:42] by faith Timothy or by faith John or by
[51:45] faith who whatever your name is tonight
[51:47] amen by faith they stood there in the
[51:50] midst of their trials in the darkest age
[51:53] there ever was Amen in the time of of
[51:55] great turmoil and Wars of rumors of wars
[51:58] and they didn't give up they didn't turn
[52:00] around they didn't shrink back from
[52:01] their place and their calling but they
[52:04] were steadfast in the faith that God had
[52:06] given them and I I believe that's the
[52:08] kind of people God is looking for he
[52:10] he's looking for real soldiers amen not
[52:13] somebody that gets in the middle of a
[52:14] fight and wants to cow down and and back
[52:17] off somewhere but somebody that'll stand
[52:20] in front of it and say this is what God
[52:22] has called me to be this is who God has
[52:24] called me to amen as a child of God I'm
[52:27] a Son of God it doesn't matter what I'm
[52:29] going through it doesn't matter what
[52:31] situations around me I believe anyhow I
[52:35] believe he will provide I believe he
[52:37] will heal I believe he will deliver
[52:39] whatever my need of is I believe he can
[52:42] do what he said he would do amen you
[52:45] know I I look at this little woman this
[52:46] little greek woman you know she had
[52:48] heard of maybe how Jesus had healed
[52:51] different ones and maybe you know is uh
[52:55] reputation had gotten around and and she
[52:57] hadd heard of different children getting
[52:59] delivered so there's something inside of
[53:01] that you know because faith comes by
[53:03] hearing and and she begin to believe
[53:05] well if he could do it for them then he
[53:07] can do it for my
[53:09] daughter you know and Faith you know
[53:11] finds a source that others don't see it
[53:14] finds something to Anchor to that your
[53:16] feelings can't express or or your
[53:18] thoughts can't bring it all into words
[53:21] it doesn't you know you can't see it you
[53:23] can't taste it you can't feel
[53:25] but faith is standing there when she
[53:27] heard she believed she she might have
[53:30] heard maybe of a neighbor's daughter
[53:31] that being healed of epilepsy or or or
[53:34] or maybe something else had taken place
[53:36] and here her daughter needed healing and
[53:38] she had heard Jesus could do it and she
[53:40] believe that he could and no matter how
[53:43] much other people didn't believe it
[53:44] didn't hinder her faith amen because she
[53:47] had a source that was something on the
[53:49] inside that had been revealed to her
[53:52] that God was able to heal God was able
[53:55] to deliver he said when a man's got
[53:57] faith in God he's got a hold of
[53:59] something he can't explain that's right
[54:02] amen he's got a hold of something he
[54:04] can't explain it's something he's got a
[54:06] hold of he can't push it shove it pull
[54:08] it it takes him that's the way faith is
[54:11] when a man really got faith in God it
[54:14] finds a source that others don't see
[54:17] amen this Greek woman had heard these
[54:19] words she had believed it she had many
[54:21] hindrances but her faith didn't have
[54:24] hindrances amen there was hindrances
[54:26] that came across her path but her faith
[54:29] stood strong she she she was going to
[54:32] push through anyhow amen you know you
[54:34] got faith if you got a faith that knows
[54:37] no defeat it's a positive thing to you
[54:40] so it doesn't matter what hindrance
[54:41] comes or if the doctor's report gets
[54:44] worse or are the symptoms gets worse
[54:46] that has nothing to do with faith faith
[54:49] is not anchored on a doctor's report
[54:51] faith is not anchored on a symptom
[54:53] whether it's good or whether it's bad
[54:55] faith is anchored in the unfailing word
[54:58] of God and the word says by his stripes
[55:01] I'm Healed
[55:04] period amen so some of them might have
[55:07] said you know uh you know some hindrance
[55:10] might have been well you know he wasn't
[55:11] even he's of A different race you're not
[55:13] the right race you're a Greek you're
[55:15] sarapan you're he's a Jew so he wasn't
[55:18] even sent to you you know in other words
[55:20] brother Bram said like this he said in
[55:22] other words your your denomination's not
[55:24] you're not part of this revival or your
[55:26] church is not part of this move you're
[55:28] you you're not part of this but she was
[55:31] H he said but she was a human being and
[55:34] she had been created by God and she had
[55:38] a need and God could meet that
[55:41] need amen she had faith that she was
[55:44] going to get it whether a denomination
[55:46] her denomination was cooperating with it
[55:49] or her church was or or her family was
[55:51] it didn't make no difference to her she
[55:54] had a need and she was going to get to
[55:56] him and he said maybe another hindrance
[55:58] was somebody would say well it's too
[56:00] late you know days of Miracles are
[56:02] passed there's no more miracles no more
[56:05] it might have been no more for them but
[56:06] for her she still
[56:09] believed and that's the way I look at it
[56:11] you want to say days of Miracles are
[56:13] pass Five they're over for you but for
[56:15] me in my house I still believe he can do
[56:18] Miracles I still believe he can heal and
[56:21] bring deliverances it doesn't matter
[56:23] what anybody else says it matters what
[56:25] his word said but something in her kept
[56:28] pushing forward something in her kept
[56:30] going forward you know something inside
[56:32] of her told her she was going to get
[56:34] what she asked
[56:37] for amen you know he said all people
[56:39] tonight if you can only hold that in
[56:41] your heart that God is here to give you
[56:45] the desire of your heart amen if you'll
[56:48] meet his conditions nothing to stand
[56:51] there might have been a bunch of women
[56:52] coming and said well look sister Lydia
[56:54] he said might have been her name I don't
[56:55] know do you understand that your husband
[56:58] will leave you if you do this no doubt
[57:00] but what she loved her husband but she
[57:02] couldn't curse or bless that which was
[57:04] in her something was telling her she had
[57:07] to get to Jesus so her daughter could
[57:10] live amen and when she got there
[57:12] something was going to take place
[57:14] husband or no
[57:17] husband amen some of us got to make
[57:19] those kind of choices amen husband or no
[57:22] husband wife or no wife I got to get to
[57:25] Jesus amen it doesn't matter if I got
[57:27] family or no family or I got this one
[57:29] that loves me or they don't love me
[57:30] matters not I want to get to
[57:36] Jesus some of them might have said well
[57:39] what are you going to do with this
[57:41] Afflicted child if this
[57:43] fails if it don't work if if you don't
[57:47] get what you're looking for she knew
[57:49] something inside of her knew it wasn't
[57:52] going to fail cuz she saw him that he
[57:56] was more than just a man that that was
[57:59] God veiled in human flesh some said well
[58:02] you know the circle you belong to

[58:25] to take place nothing was going to stand
[58:28] in her way no hindrance she was
[58:30] persevering and finally she arrived
[58:33] where he was that's right and you think
[58:36] now she got to where he was now she's

[1:06:11] sin is still
[1:06:13] sin God still feels the same way toward
[1:06:16] sin today as he did millions of years
[1:06:20] ago he hasn't changed man's changed
[1:06:28] people get their feelings hurt because a
[1:06:30] pastor preaches a little hard well you

[1:07:02] gar but he'll fight every inch of ground
[1:07:04] you don't have to Baby him around that's
[1:07:06] the matter with the Pentecostal church

[1:07:10] just been sprinkled and sprayed with
[1:07:12] this and that and other till it's run
[1:07:13] out a bunch of hybrids what we need

[1:08:15] right you know there a real problem with
[1:08:17] people who can't admit they're ever
[1:08:20] wrong something wrong with their
[1:08:22] experience it's always somebody else's
[1:08:24] fault for the way they are so you know
[1:08:27] it's always somebody else's fault for
[1:08:29] where they're at and what they're going
[1:08:30] through and all this stuff somebody
[1:08:31] else's
[1:08:33] fault

[1:09:38] amen be the lowly one ain't talking
[1:09:40] about some false humility either I'm

[1:10:12] hearing and she had the right approach
[1:10:16] to God's
[1:10:20] Gift that's the only way to ever receive
[1:10:22] anything is come with the right
[1:10:24] approach she was first Gentile that a
[1:10:28] miracle was ever performed on faith
[1:10:30] admidst the word is right it's humbled
[1:10:33] and reverent and the same as today be
[1:10:36] willing to take any
[1:10:39] part any part anywhere just so I get
[1:10:45] there come on but that right there needs
[1:10:48] to be wrote on all of our walls be
[1:10:51] willing to take any part in anywhere
[1:10:54] just so I get
[1:10:57] there if I got to be the footwash funky
[1:11:00] it doesn't matter as long as I got a
[1:11:03] spot at that
[1:11:05] table if I got to be the lowest of the
[1:11:07] lowest I could care less as long as I
[1:11:10] got a seat at that table that's all I
[1:11:13] care
[1:11:16] about doesn't matter if I got my name
[1:11:18] written in the in the in the highlights
[1:11:21] or some sign somewhere or this that and
[1:11:23] other or on some poster that matters not
[1:11:26] it matters not if my name's on a flly
[1:11:28] and my picture's on a flly that has
[1:11:30] nothing to do with it I could care less
[1:11:33] what I care about is being there on that
[1:11:36] day when the dead in Christ rise and I
[1:11:38] know when something's happened I ain't I
[1:11:41] ain't caught unawares and I don't know
[1:11:43] what's that is going on and I don't know
[1:11:45] nothing about it I want to know when
[1:11:47] they rise cuz when they rise I'm going
[1:11:49] to be changed to be just like them
[1:11:54] so it don't matter what we got to do or
[1:11:57] who we are or who we
[1:11:59] ain't as far as humanly speaking what
[1:12:02] matters is who we are sons of
[1:12:05] God and who we ain't are children of the
[1:12:13] devil there was a it was a brother
[1:12:15] Brandon was pre preaching down in Mexico
[1:12:18] youall know the
[1:12:20] story several thousand people had
[1:12:22] gathered
[1:12:24] brother ESP espo espanosa was down there
[1:12:28] and he was he was his interpreter and
[1:12:31] there come an old blind man into the
[1:12:33] across the platform couldn't see at all
[1:12:35] and he said I look I had good shoes on
[1:12:37] and good clothes and he had ragged
[1:12:39] trialers all tore off and old hats sewed
[1:12:41] up and his blind white beard hanging
[1:12:45] down his old big old feet maybe had
[1:12:49] hadn't had shoes on in years Dusty all
[1:12:50] over totally blind I thought my dad
[1:12:53] would be about his age if he had
[1:12:56] lived I slipped over to him I said how
[1:12:58] do you do brother Espinosa
[1:13:01] interpreted I set my foot up beside him
[1:13:04] to find out you know checking to see if
[1:13:06] his foot was the same size he'd give him
[1:13:08] his shoes but my foot was much larger or
[1:13:11] his foot was much larger than mine I put
[1:13:13] my shoulders up against him I was going
[1:13:15] to put my arms around him my shoulders
[1:13:16] were wider his shoulders wider than mine
[1:13:18] I'd seen that I couldn't even give him
[1:13:19] my coat thought God what can I do poor
[1:13:22] old fell probably hasn't had a decent
[1:13:24] meal in his
[1:13:26] life there he was eating old rejected
[1:13:28] tortillas down there somewhere but yet
[1:13:30] had spent the what little money you had
[1:13:32] to get a grease candle and burn a
[1:13:34] million dollar on a million dollar gold
[1:13:36] Altar for sins living such Superstition
[1:13:39] and darkness is that and I thought what
[1:13:41] a time why can fate be so evil and I put
[1:13:44] my arm around I said oh God have mercy
[1:13:46] on him about that time time I heard
[1:13:49] Glory adios and about that time I looked
[1:13:52] around and he could see his good good as
[1:13:53] I could running across a
[1:13:58] platform next night there was a rack of
[1:14:00] old clothes and Sh Shaws and and hats
[1:14:04] about three or 4 foot high like this all
[1:14:06] the way across how they ever knew who
[1:14:08] that belonged to he said I I don't even
[1:14:10] think they I don't even think they care

[1:14:13] or 9:00 no ceas to sit down right there
[1:14:16] in the pouring down rain just leaning up
[1:14:18] against one another women with their

[1:14:39] was going to get but they wanted to be
[1:14:40] sure they had a place there they they
[1:14:42] want to be sure to be able to stand
[1:14:44] there and they were waiting till I come
[1:14:46] in and said they let me they would let
[1:14:48] me down on a rope ladder on the back
[1:14:49] Arena and and and I walk out to the
[1:14:52] platform and Billy calling a man I call
[1:14:54] Manana which means tomorrow cuz he was
[1:14:57] always so slow to come get me so he said
[1:14:59] I called him
[1:15:00] Manana CU I say just come tomorrow cuz
[1:15:03] you done Ru
[1:15:05] today so he brought me over there and he
[1:15:08] let me down and I come in on a platform
[1:15:10] and brother Jack Mo many of you know him
[1:15:12] he was with me and brother Espinosa and
[1:15:14] several of the Brethren and when we're
[1:15:16] standing on the platform Billy come and
[1:15:18] I I heard that great row thousand time
[1:15:20] thousands sitting there and he said
[1:15:22] Daddy you have to do something there's a
[1:15:24] little Spanish woman over here she got a
[1:15:26] dead baby in her arms and that baby died
[1:15:29] apparently this morning they say early
[1:15:31] and Manana gave out all the prayer cards
[1:15:33] and he ain't got a prayer card and and I
[1:15:36] ain't got one and she's determined to
[1:15:38] bring that baby into the prayer line and
[1:15:39] said we got about 400 already in line I
[1:15:43] said well just make her stay back cuz
[1:15:45] she gets ahead they'll start every one
[1:15:46] of them doing that and we can't do that
[1:15:48] and tell her to get back in line maybe
[1:15:50] tomorrow and we we we're going to be
[1:15:52] here tomor tomorrow give her a prayer
[1:15:54] card then he said you come over and try
[1:15:57] it said I got 300 ushers there that
[1:16:00] can't hold her and said she weighs maybe
[1:16:03] 90 lbs and you can't hold her she runs
[1:16:05] between the legs she jumps over the
[1:16:07] shoulders amen and everything while
[1:16:09] carrying this dead
[1:16:11] baby you're talking about
[1:16:14] persistence perseverance say whatever
[1:16:17] block it doesn't matter I I got to get
[1:16:20] lied I got to be there and I said
[1:16:22] brother Jack she don't know me want you
[1:16:24] to go down there and you pray for her
[1:16:26] and and said he so he said I wouldn't
[1:16:27] and I was speaking on faith being the
[1:16:29] substance of things hope for and as I
[1:16:32] was speaking and the translator was
[1:16:35] translating brother Jack started down to
[1:16:37] pray for the baby and I looked right in
[1:16:39] front of me and there was this little
[1:16:40] Mexican baby with no teeth was so little
[1:16:43] smiling looking at me laughing a vision
[1:16:46] I said wait a minute brother Jack bring
[1:16:47] that baby here and so they opened up the
[1:16:50] way and here comes this little woman
[1:16:51] with prayer beads in her head hand
[1:16:53] falling on the floor holling Padre Padre
[1:16:56] I said don't do that stand
[1:16:58] up and I asked her when the baby died
[1:17:00] and said it died that morning in the
[1:17:02] doctor's office about 9:30 or 10:00 and
[1:17:06] and 9 9:00 about 9:00 that morning here
[1:17:08] it's about 10:00 the same night and then
[1:17:11] she was soaking wet and just drenched
[1:17:13] with everything and and you know maybe
[1:17:15] it was her first baby she looked maybe
[1:17:17] 25 years old I said brother espanosa
[1:17:19] don't don't interpret this prayer but
[1:17:21] I've seen a vision of this little dead
[1:17:23] baby out here laughing at me it might be
[1:17:25] the baby it might be the baby it might
[1:17:28] be the baby and I put my hands upon the
[1:17:31] little blanket I said dear heavenly
[1:17:32] father I don't know if this is the
[1:17:34] vision or not but I seen that little
[1:17:36] baby you're ready to call it back to
[1:17:38] life then I call for its life in the
[1:17:40] name of Jesus Christ and about that time
[1:17:43] it let out a yell and kicked that
[1:17:45] blanket and been screaming to the top of
[1:17:47] its
[1:17:48] voice but what would have happened if
[1:17:50] that little mama would have gave up
[1:17:52] that's right
[1:17:54] it'd be a tombstone somewhere written
[1:17:57] with his name on it maybe if it was that
[1:17:59] lucky might be an unmarked grave
[1:18:01] somewhere but that woman had a need and
[1:18:05] she had heard a blind man had been given
[1:18:07] his sight and said if God could do that
[1:18:09] he can raise my baby to life and there
[1:18:12] wasn't enough ushers in the building it
[1:18:14] wasn't enough anything to keep her from
[1:18:17] receiving what had been placed inside of
[1:18:18] her
[1:18:20] heart oh God if we could come with that
[1:18:22] same intensity to the service God I have
[1:18:25] a need it might not be a dead little
[1:18:27] baby but it might be a dead child out
[1:18:29] there somewhere it might be a dead St
[1:18:32] deadness in your own life and you say
[1:18:34] God I have a need I got to get there
[1:18:37] there ain't enough Devils to stop
[1:18:40] me I'll climb over them I'll climb under
[1:18:43] them I'll run through them whatever I
[1:18:46] have to get to
[1:18:48] Jesus I've got to get to where he's at
[1:18:52] that's right
[1:18:59] she was
[1:19:01] persistent nothing was going to stop
[1:19:05] her she was perseverant though a priest
[1:19:09] would have put her out of her church no
[1:19:11] matter what happened she happened to be
[1:19:13] looking at the fence a few nights before
[1:19:15] she seen an old blind looking at the
[1:19:17] fence a few nights before she seen an
[1:19:18] old blind man receive a sight and if God
[1:19:21] could give sight to the blind he'd
[1:19:23] raised the
[1:19:24] dead she had a need she was persistent
[1:19:29] like this saraph phenician woman and she
[1:19:32] got her desire because she was
[1:19:38] perseverant you know it's amazing
[1:19:40] sometimes we will can fight through all
[1:19:41] kind of adversity to get to the house of
[1:19:44] God and then give
[1:19:46] up and get back in the same car with the
[1:19:49] same needs and the same situations and
[1:19:51] never talk it over with him because we
[1:19:53] got into his
[1:19:55] presence but it's more than
[1:19:58] that it's pushing through the violent
[1:20:02] takes by force amen there's a
[1:20:04] perseverance there's a persistence there
[1:20:07] there's something in a drive on the
[1:20:09] inside I don't come just to sing a few
[1:20:12] songs I don't come just to hear some
[1:20:15] good music I don't come just to see
[1:20:17] everybody I come to see Jesus and to
[1:20:21] have a conference with him that he can
[1:20:23] come and meet
[1:20:28] me we said before you got five senses in
[1:20:31] your body God gave those senses see
[1:20:34] taste feel smell and here to contact
[1:20:37] your Earthly home but that has nothing
[1:20:40] to do with
[1:20:42] god well you see taste or you usually I
[1:20:46] just use these two maybe three see feel
[1:20:48] or here and we think that contacts God
[1:20:52] sure
[1:20:53] you they can be uh made a you know the
[1:20:55] senses can come to have a reaction when
[1:20:57] God comes no doubt but whether you see
[1:21:00] him whether you feel him or whether you
[1:21:02] he hear him that has nothing to do with
[1:21:03] God's here or
[1:21:05] not what has to do with with God is here
[1:21:08] or not is what his word said and his
[1:21:10] word said he would be so where two or
[1:21:13] three are gathered in my name there I
[1:21:14] will be so amen he promised he would but
[1:21:18] we got to understand that when we get
[1:21:20] here it's not just the end of story but
[1:21:22] there's got to be a press there's got to
[1:21:23] be a push there's got to be amen a a
[1:21:26] moving into into other Realms you know
[1:21:29] so so easily we get to this play we you
[1:21:31] know we we we fought whatever I don't
[1:21:33] know what all you fought to get here bad
[1:21:36] moods no supper
[1:21:40] whatever car trouble late on late at
[1:21:43] work still going to push through and you
[1:21:45] get here but then all of a sudden our
[1:21:47] minds are Waring with this over here and
[1:21:49] and before you know we've been
[1:21:50] distracted for 20 minutes and we missed
[1:21:52] all what's been
[1:21:55] happening it
[1:21:58] happens we get to thinking about
[1:21:59] tomorrow and next week and what all has
[1:22:02] happened maybe yesterday and what we got
[1:22:04] to do what's going on and all the stuff
[1:22:06] has happened and before you
[1:22:08] don't let's all
[1:22:12] stand wow where have I
[1:22:16] been and we totally
[1:22:19] missed our
[1:22:20] moments and our time
[1:22:23] because we allowed something else and we
[1:22:26] became we allowed
[1:22:28] some somebody something to stand in our
[1:22:33] way now this this little woman this
[1:22:36] little Mexican woman she was facing
[1:22:37] physical things physical ushers physical
[1:22:40] Gates physical rain physical things that
[1:22:43] was trying to block her but maybe it
[1:22:45] ain't necessarily physical things
[1:22:47] tonight but de the devil is constantly
[1:22:49] there trying to stop the word of God
[1:22:53] trying to hinder it trying to stop the
[1:22:55] moving of the spirit trying to keep
[1:22:57] things back cuz he he really don't care
[1:22:59] if you come to church he comes to church
[1:23:01] he just want to make sure you don't
[1:23:02] receive something while you're at
[1:23:09] church so all of our taste and feel
[1:23:13] smell and hear that has nothing to do
[1:23:15] with God although we rely on
[1:23:19] them faith is something different faith
[1:23:22] is the six sense when you contact God
[1:23:25] and you can only contact God by the six
[1:23:28] sense which is Faith you can't even
[1:23:32] please him without
[1:23:33] faith these senses was given you to
[1:23:36] contact this Earthly home they were not
[1:23:38] by they were by no means to lead
[1:23:42] you what if I refuse to look anymore and
[1:23:45] I just bound up my eyes and I said I
[1:23:47] refuse to look finally I'd go blind and
[1:23:50] that's when my bo boy comes in I tie his
[1:23:52] eyes up no sir there's no such a thing
[1:23:54] as sight and I tie his eyes up next
[1:23:56] thing you know my father told me there's
[1:23:57] no such a thing as sight so I tie up my
[1:23:59] boy's eyes first thing you know our
[1:24:01] generation would become born blind if
[1:24:03] you don't use your six sense they become
[1:24:07] dormant amen that's why the devil wants
[1:24:10] to keep you on these five senses because
[1:24:12] he wants that six sense to become
[1:24:14] dormant in your life to where you can't
[1:24:16] really contact God that you can't
[1:24:19] declare he's here when you don't feel
[1:24:23] that you can't declare he's here when
[1:24:25] you don't see
[1:24:29] him so that's what the church has done
[1:24:31] to the six sense God put in them he just
[1:24:34] placed Faith Off In Miracles and signs
[1:24:36] and things that context God that gives
[1:24:38] them the Holy Ghost and things he places
[1:24:40] it off over there back off somewhere
[1:24:42] else till that thing has become
[1:24:47] dead this one said there wasn't no more
[1:24:49] healings this one said there wasn't
[1:24:51] pretty soon they rais raising up
[1:24:52] Generations that don't even believe in
[1:24:57] God how do you think we got to where we
[1:24:59] at because somebody has tied of knots
[1:25:02] over their eyes and refuse to look
[1:25:04] around them and say God's there God's
[1:25:06] there God's there God's
[1:25:09] there nature declares God the stars and
[1:25:12] the universe declares God but somehow we
[1:25:14] got whole Generations today that doesn't
[1:25:16] even believe in him why for because for
[1:25:20] Generations they have tied their eyes
[1:25:24] shut and this has happened spiritually
[1:25:27] as well churches are tying their eyes
[1:25:29] shut there the the eye that can see the
[1:25:33] ear that can hear they're putting their
[1:25:35] fingers in it their spiritual fingers in
[1:25:36] their ear and they don't want to hear
[1:25:38] things of God no more and pretty soon
[1:25:40] they're raising up Generations that
[1:25:42] doesn't want anything to do with God
[1:25:45] anymore that comes to just have a
[1:25:47] feel-good time you know a simple
[1:25:50] Church how do we get to a simp simple
[1:25:52] church cuz people put their finger in
[1:25:54] their ears cuz they put blinders over
[1:25:57] their eyes and they refused to see what
[1:25:59] God was doing among them until they've
[1:26:02] come now to where they got the Gospel
[1:26:04] According to Michael Jackson and they
[1:26:05] got the New Year's Revolution according
[1:26:07] to the Beatles that's the church right
[1:26:09] there in sh Port Louisiana The Simple
[1:26:11] Church how did they get
[1:26:13] there cuz for Generations they've closed
[1:26:16] their eyes and willfully looked away
[1:26:18] from the things God has
[1:26:21] done
[1:26:23] to now they're being born without eyes
[1:26:26] born without
[1:26:30] ears brother that's what the church has
[1:26:32] done to the six sense they just placed
[1:26:35] Faith Off Miracles and things like that
[1:26:37] off what it used to
[1:26:39] do you say well God's A Healer oh what
[1:26:43] about that God God a he God's a heal
[1:26:45] well if he ever was a Healer he's still
[1:26:47] a Healer if he ever was a savior he's
[1:26:50] still a savior if he ever was God he's
[1:26:53] still God so see the lack of faith
[1:26:55] that's been preaching to the people that
[1:26:57] makes them let this six sense or this
[1:27:00] Faith lay
[1:27:02] dormant and through the year they'll run
[1:27:04] out be sick run the doctor say doctor I
[1:27:06] got something wrong with me doctor look
[1:27:07] at this say he'll try a man that's a
[1:27:10] good man that's a good honest doctor
[1:27:11] will work just as patiently as he can
[1:27:13] with all the power that God has given
[1:27:15] him to operate with do the things you
[1:27:16] should do to help you then the first
[1:27:18] thing you know it advances on well I I
[1:27:20] just have doctors I just have to tell
[1:27:23] you there's nothing more I can do if you
[1:27:25] want to go to another doctor go see him
[1:27:27] well then you go to another doctor it
[1:27:28] says nothing can be done it's too far
[1:27:30] Advanced he said that's the time that's
[1:27:33] the time to call on the six sense that's
[1:27:35] the time to accept God that's the time
[1:27:38] to rely upon the spirit of faith that
[1:27:41] God has put in
[1:27:47] you the super sense is the holy spirit
[1:27:51] it is the faith Faith Of God that dwells
[1:27:53] in
[1:27:54] you I like that it's the faith of God
[1:27:58] that dwells in you he he imparted if you
[1:28:00] got the you got the Holy Ghost then the
[1:28:03] faith of God lives inside of you the
[1:28:06] same faith that had faith enough to
[1:28:08] believe Let There
[1:28:11] Be amen if you let the five senses be
[1:28:14] yielded to the six sense it that will
[1:28:17] guide you and bring all these other
[1:28:19] senses under the control of that super
[1:28:22] for is so far above a natural sense as a
[1:28:26] spiritual man is above the natural it is
[1:28:28] far as high as the heavens is above the
[1:28:30] natural man in his five senses it makes
[1:28:32] you believe things you will never see it
[1:28:35] makes you act the where you think the
[1:28:38] you never act the devil can get in those
[1:28:40] five senses he can lie to you but he
[1:28:42] cannot touch the faith of God he cannot
[1:28:47] touch that super sense it's far beyond
[1:28:50] his
[1:28:51] reach
[1:28:57] now you're only going to get this if
[1:28:59] you're born again you won't receive it
[1:29:02] you might receive a belief you might
[1:29:03] receive a religion but unless you're
[1:29:06] born again you will not receive the
[1:29:08] faith of
[1:29:09] God Amen because it it's it's it's not
[1:29:12] something that can be handed down by
[1:29:14] generation to generation as much as one
[1:29:16] parent would love to give it to their
[1:29:17] children we can't do that but they must
[1:29:20] each be born again by the the power of
[1:29:22] God you cannot believe until you're
[1:29:24] regenerated or born again the whole
[1:29:27] Bible says no man can call Jesus the
[1:29:29] Christ only by the Holy Ghost amen see
[1:29:33] it's until then you're just taking what
[1:29:36] somebody else said or you learn by some
[1:29:38] intellectual understanding or you learn
[1:29:39] by a natural way or five senses but when
[1:29:42] the six sense comes in the Holy Spirit
[1:29:44] it takes away all reasonings it lifts
[1:29:47] you up into that place to make you
[1:29:48] believe things you can't see you can't
[1:29:51] taste you can't feel feel you can't
[1:29:52] smell or you can't hear it does
[1:29:54] something to you then you can say Jesus
[1:29:56] is the Christ why because you've
[1:29:59] witnessed it for yourself not some
[1:30:01] intellectual teaching that's been taught
[1:30:03] but you haven't been you have
[1:30:04] experienced it for
[1:30:11] yourself the six
[1:30:15] sense six cense will go to
[1:30:18] work he said some unbeliever some
[1:30:20] Infidel might come to you and look
[1:30:22] around and look at here no such a thing
[1:30:25] as a holy ghost you're just mistaken
[1:30:27] you're crazy just believe there's no
[1:30:29] such a thing is that he said that's when
[1:30:31] the six sense are we going to go to work
[1:30:32] let me show you in the
[1:30:34] bible let me show you in the Bible where
[1:30:37] you can receive the Holy Ghost and when
[1:30:40] whether the promise is not to your
[1:30:41] children well let me show you in the
[1:30:42] Bible where it says it
[1:30:44] is amen but the six sense knows better
[1:30:47] than to believe that nonsense it's
[1:30:49] inside of you it they've said it too
[1:30:51] late late you've already see that the
[1:30:53] people who talk say there's no such a
[1:30:54] thing as the Holy Spirit they don't know
[1:30:57] what they're talking about cuz they've
[1:30:59] never experienced
[1:31:02] it it's like we've said it before no man
[1:31:06] is at the mercy of no man with an
[1:31:08] experience is at the mercy of someone
[1:31:11] with just merely an
[1:31:13] argument if you've experienced it you've
[1:31:17] been there they can say what they want
[1:31:19] to
[1:31:20] say
[1:31:24] you know it'd be like somebody coming to
[1:31:25] me and say you know in the middle of
[1:31:27] Homer ain't nothing in the middle of
[1:31:28] that that that that that little thing
[1:31:30] that goes around and around all them
[1:31:32] buildings around there ain't no
[1:31:33] Courthouse there there ain't nothing
[1:31:36] there it's all it's all just taken down
[1:31:38] and they got they got you know some
[1:31:40] certain whatever some kind of Monument
[1:31:42] there now they can say all they want to
[1:31:44] I've experienced
[1:31:45] it I've been there I know what it's
[1:31:50] like I live
[1:31:53] there amen so you can say what you want
[1:31:55] to say about about what it what it looks
[1:31:58] like but if you ain't never been there
[1:32:00] amen you can't say what really is there
[1:32:03] and that's the same thing with the Holy
[1:32:04] Ghost if you haven't been there you can
[1:32:07] say it's this or is this or is this and
[1:32:09] you can call it all the names in the
[1:32:10] book you want to but unless you've
[1:32:12] experienced for yourself then you don't
[1:32:15] know what you're talking about
[1:32:18] right it's kind of like brother Brown
[1:32:21] love this illustration is
[1:32:23] Infidel talking this big talk about not
[1:32:25] being no God and there this little boy
[1:32:27] peeling the apple he said I want to ask
[1:32:29] you a question he said okay a little
[1:32:33] simple looking
[1:32:35] boy didn't look like a little delinquent
[1:32:37] maybe with hair hanging down his face
[1:32:39] maybe one tooth out old dirty overall
[1:32:41] jacket on one one question just one
[1:32:43] question Infidel said well I had just
[1:32:46] said there's no sense such a thing as
[1:32:48] God is just emotion there's no there
[1:32:50] nonsense and the boy said I ask you a
[1:32:53] question is this apple sweet or is it
[1:32:56] sour he said how do I know I'm not
[1:32:58] eating it he said just what I thought
[1:33:01] took himself another bite he said how do
[1:33:04] you know when you ain't taste to the
[1:33:06] Lord how do you know when you never
[1:33:08] receive the Holy Ghost whether he's real
[1:33:10] or whether he's not how do you know
[1:33:12] where there's faith and power if you
[1:33:14] never experienced it how do you know if
[1:33:16] there not joy unspeakable and full of
[1:33:17] Glory when you've never tasted it but if
[1:33:21] you tasted it you know what it tastes
[1:33:25] like then if you tasted it you could
[1:33:28] care less what anybody else's opinion is
[1:33:31] about it I know I was there I was there
[1:33:34] when it came I was there when the spirit
[1:33:37] came I know who he
[1:33:40] [Music]
[1:33:41] is there's no intellectual Powers will
[1:33:44] ever bring that out of
[1:33:46] you the intellectual Powers reasons well
[1:33:49] maybe it's just psychology maybe just
[1:33:51] workup maybe it's just emotion maybe
[1:33:53] it's you know just working the people up
[1:33:56] but he said but when the six sense comes
[1:33:58] in it denies all those things and moves
[1:34:00] a person straight into the bosom of God
[1:34:03] he that cometh to God must believe that
[1:34:04] he is and he's reward to those that
[1:34:06] diligently seek Him by faith Abraham by
[1:34:09] faith Isaac by faith Jacob all by faith
[1:34:13] it's the six sense that does that you
[1:34:16] get prayed for let's say you got a
[1:34:17] crippled hand you get prayed for and you
[1:34:19] and you come up here and nothing seems
[1:34:21] to happen you you don't feel different
[1:34:23] in that hand old natural man begin to
[1:34:25] say well you know what you don't feel no
[1:34:27] different matter of fact it's worse but
[1:34:29] the six sents to say that's a lie you've
[1:34:31] been prayed for it's healed it's
[1:34:36] settled amen he said like a woman that
[1:34:38] came to our meeting one time and she she
[1:34:40] was there was two of them actually
[1:34:41] neighbors and you know the story is but
[1:34:44] these two ladies coming to the pray line
[1:34:45] and this one had a stomach problem and
[1:34:47] she was suffering really bad she
[1:34:49] couldn't eat and and and and and the
[1:34:51] discernment began to tell her who she
[1:34:53] was and where she lived and what her
[1:34:55] problem was and her face just lit up and
[1:34:57] said that's nothing but the truth and
[1:34:58] the Holy Spirit said to me it's a ulcer
[1:35:00] and it's caused from a nervous condition
[1:35:03] he've been examined by a certain doctor
[1:35:04] and he said you you you would have to
[1:35:06] have an operation have it cut out she
[1:35:08] said every word of that is true and
[1:35:10] seeing she was such a great
[1:35:12] believer then it said your name is Miss
[1:35:15] so and so and you come from such and
[1:35:17] such place she said that's the truth
[1:35:19] what was it it was a six catching it the
[1:35:22] six sense and the Holy Spirit was
[1:35:24] standing side by side the Holy Spirit
[1:35:27] was speaking and the six sense was
[1:35:30] saying
[1:35:31] amen it's when the word saw the
[1:35:34] word amen there it is something has to
[1:35:38] happen that's
[1:35:41] right now are you going to reason all of
[1:35:43] that or you going to believe
[1:35:45] it and here she
[1:35:48] is thus sayth the Lord go home and eat
[1:35:52] Jesus Christ makes you well she went
[1:35:54] home that night a friend of hers living
[1:35:56] in the same neighborhood of third or
[1:35:58] fourth behind her she had a big knot on
[1:36:00] her neck and here she come all thrilled
[1:36:01] about this seeing her neighbor who had
[1:36:03] been discerned and knew exactly it was
[1:36:05] exactly the truth and this big knot
[1:36:07] sticking out of her neck she'd come up
[1:36:09] and said no one I said no I said no one
[1:36:11] had to discern that but you're happy
[1:36:13] about something you're just thrilled why
[1:36:15] oh that woman that just got just got
[1:36:18] told about her stomach problem is your
[1:36:20] neighbor
[1:36:22] my God because that woman sitting over
[1:36:25] there rejoicing is a neighbor of yours
[1:36:27] holy that he said that's the Holy Spirit
[1:36:29] she thought how in the world could that
[1:36:31] man know that it has to be something to
[1:36:33] reveal it to him so when it was said
[1:36:36] you're thinking about your neck yes do
[1:36:38] you believe it believe I believe with
[1:36:39] all my heart thus sayth the Lord go home
[1:36:41] and you will receive your healing the
[1:36:43] natural man looked around and didn't see
[1:36:45] one sign the neck was still just as big
[1:36:49] the woman with the ulcer went home and
[1:36:50] tried to eat and she like to
[1:36:56] died he told her to go home and eat
[1:36:59] you're healed she went home and tried to
[1:37:02] eat and she liked to died what if she
[1:37:05] said well man that's a false guy what in
[1:37:08] the world's he thinking he almost killed
[1:37:11] me that wasn't her
[1:37:14] testimony she said that man knew who I
[1:37:18] was he told me who I was he told me my
[1:37:22] address he told me my name he told me I
[1:37:24] was that my neighbor's neighbor he knew
[1:37:26] all about it said that wasn't a man that
[1:37:28] was some God that was God speaking
[1:37:30] through a man and he said it done
[1:37:32] something for her to where she begin to
[1:37:35] begin to to say the Lord is heal when
[1:37:37] she went through the neighborhood I I'm
[1:37:39] Healed it's finished are you eating yet
[1:37:41] no not exactly but by his stripes I'm
[1:37:45] Healed no matter what it was she was
[1:37:47] healed
[1:37:49] anyhow and her husband you know told her
[1:37:51] honey you ought to quit talking about
[1:37:53] that healing cuz you know he was a
[1:37:55] Christian himself you're bringing
[1:37:56] reproach upon the cause brother said how
[1:37:58] can you bring a reproach when you're
[1:38:00] testifying what the word
[1:38:04] said amen you'll bring a reproach if he
[1:38:07] don't testify what the word
[1:38:10] said come on we're not testifying how
[1:38:12] many people are so willing to testify
[1:38:14] their
[1:38:16] feelings and they can be wrong 90% of
[1:38:19] the time but what about testifying what
[1:38:21] the word said it doesn't matter what I
[1:38:23] feel like it matters what he said about
[1:38:26] me and he said by his stripes I am
[1:38:36] healed she said that man stood is what
[1:38:39] she said to her husband that man stood
[1:38:41] and looked me in the eye and told me my
[1:38:43] condition and things that I've done and
[1:38:44] who I was and where I was from I hadn't
[1:38:47] been in the building 15
[1:38:49] minutes when he come to the plat form
[1:38:51] how in the world could that man know all
[1:38:53] of that I never seen him in my life and
[1:38:56] he said thus sayith the Lord you're
[1:38:58] healed I'll believe that until I'm
[1:39:07] dead
[1:39:09] perseverance I'll believe that till I'm
[1:39:12] dead I'll believe it anyhow and her and
[1:39:16] her sister a friend her friend had a
[1:39:18] covenant to God they would hold that
[1:39:20] faith that morning she gets up she's
[1:39:22] feeling kind of funny few minutes she
[1:39:25] gets hungry children had left some oats

[1:40:08] down the street she went when she got
[1:40:10] there she thought she had been there
[1:40:12] maybe been a death in the family
[1:40:13] screaming and shouting and walking
[1:40:15] around woman had slept late that morning
[1:40:17] and got up and the growth on her neck
[1:40:19] was gone and disappeared to the night
[1:40:21] and she was shaking out the sheet to see
[1:40:23] if she could find it he said but what
[1:40:26] happened he said the healing Angel come
[1:40:28] through the
[1:40:33] neighborhood Hallelujah and he walked in
[1:40:36] this house yep when I come there's faith
[1:40:41] and she received our healing walk to the
[1:40:43] next house yep there's
[1:40:46] Faith what if they have gave up just a
[1:40:49] day before
[1:40:57] perseverant you have to
[1:41:00] be you don't know when that healing
[1:41:02] Angel is going to come through the
[1:41:11] neighborhood

[1:41:29] that's right your name is such and such
[1:41:31] you come from a certain place that's
[1:41:33] right but what about my healing I said
[1:41:36] by his stripes you're
[1:41:41] healed he just told him the
[1:41:44] word he went home testifying giving God
[1:41:49] praise said they brought such a reproach
[1:41:52] they claim in the neighborhood until one
[1:41:55] Sunday a group of ministers came in and
[1:41:57] sat by and said you got to stop doing
[1:41:59] that you're bringing reproach upon the
[1:42:02] cause he said mister if you sitting
[1:42:05] where I'm
[1:42:06] sitting if you were in the same chair
[1:42:09] that I'm sitting in you wouldn't rob me
[1:42:11] of The Last Hope I've got in Christ
[1:42:14] Jesus and he said by his stripes I'm
[1:42:17] Healed he no more said that sitting
[1:42:20] there paralyzed feet Hands and Body and
[1:42:22] back no more than he said that out of
[1:42:24] the chair he went glorifying God his
[1:42:27] natural senses said he hadd sit there
[1:42:29] the doctor said he'd be there forever
[1:42:31] but the word
[1:42:33] said you are healed and he wouldn't take
[1:42:36] nothing contrary to what the word
[1:42:39] [Applause]
[1:42:43] said this is where we have to
[1:42:49] be
[1:42:51] news stations are saying World War
[1:42:54] II nuclear I mean I mean I I ain't
[1:42:59] but oh Lord have mercy in my later
[1:43:04] 40s and I ain't never heard nuclear
[1:43:07] stuff so much in the in the news
[1:43:10] everybody's talking everybody's testing
[1:43:13] them everybody's trying and flexing
[1:43:15] their
[1:43:16] muscles and it's very easy to get your
[1:43:18] eyes on that and think there's no
[1:43:22] hope but there is
[1:43:30] hope
[1:43:31] Hallelujah there'll be a bride without
[1:43:33] spot with wrink without
[1:43:35] wrinkle those that are alive and
[1:43:38] remain that is the
[1:43:41] word shall not hinder those that are
[1:43:44] asleep that's
[1:43:47] right but you're going to have to be
[1:43:49] persistent
[1:43:51] you're going to have to be perseverant
[1:43:54] you're going to have to push through so
[1:43:57] if we got to push with such Vigor and
[1:44:00] such steadfastness of heart and
[1:44:04] mind to go into a body
[1:44:06] change why would we give up even in a
[1:44:12] service and just let one slide by and
[1:44:14] another slide by before we know it we
[1:44:16] missed opportunities and and and we were
[1:44:19] sitting right there in the pew
[1:44:21] missed it no
[1:44:24] no I want to
[1:44:27] be let me ask you
[1:44:30] this this crippled boy was sitting in a
[1:44:33] chair and maybe these ministers was
[1:44:35] sitting in a chair which chair would you
[1:44:41] want well he
[1:44:43] crippled but he had
[1:44:47] believed he was laughed at but he
[1:44:51] believed he was scorned but he
[1:44:56] believed I want that chair I want the
[1:45:00] belief that no matter what comes my way
[1:45:04] I'll still
[1:45:06] believe sure I don't want to go what
[1:45:08] through he went through maybe we won't
[1:45:10] all go through what he goes through but
[1:45:12] we all better be sitting in the chair of
[1:45:15] belief not the chair of doubt and the
[1:45:19] chair of discouragement and the chair of
[1:45:20] whatever else no I'm believing to my
[1:45:23] last dollar I'm believing to my last
[1:45:26] moment I'm believing I'll believe it
[1:45:27] until I
[1:45:29] die I still
[1:45:31] believe let's
[1:45:39] pray get some
[1:45:41] persistence get some
[1:45:48] perseverance my goodness
[1:45:52] so many other
[1:45:58] things so
[1:46:04] easy the devil wants to tell you it's
[1:46:06] easy to give
[1:46:09] up there's a lot of hard things you go
[1:46:11] through when you give
[1:46:13] up he don't want to tell you about all
[1:46:15] of
[1:46:19] that
[1:46:22] but he wants to make the give up seem
[1:46:25] like an easier path than pressing
[1:46:30] forward I wonder how many just say
[1:46:33] Lord I believe but help my
[1:46:37] unbelief give me a
[1:46:39] perseverance to push through
