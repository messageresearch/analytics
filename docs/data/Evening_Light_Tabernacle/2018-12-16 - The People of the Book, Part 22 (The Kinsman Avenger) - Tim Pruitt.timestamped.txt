[44:01] morning if you have a need
[44:03] he's a present God to meet that man if
[44:08] you're the Bride of Christ don't be
[44:10] afraid to step forward say Lord this is
[44:13] what I need from you this morning as we
[44:16] all stand together as brother team comes
[44:17] whatever that need is whether it's
[44:20] physical spiritual maybe a loved one
[44:22] just come to the Lord there's nothing
[44:25] between and say father I come before you
[44:29] bodily Lord she told me to do it and
[44:32] Here I am
[44:34] [Music]
[45:05] yes
[45:09] [Music]
[45:35] this is our heads together or Jesus
[45:38] today as we bow before your throne of
[45:42] grace we thank you for mercy we thank
[45:49] you that your mercies aren't new every
[45:51] morning and today is a day full of new
[45:55] mercies and we believe as you would tell
[46:00] the Apostle Paul that your grace is
[46:03] sufficient for us just to have your
[46:05] favor Lord that's sufficient Lord we
[46:10] thank you for that grace upon our lives
[46:13] in that grace has provided salvation
[46:17] Lord salvation of our souls salvation
[46:20] for our bodies and a promise for the
[46:24] redemption the salvation the complete
[46:27] salvation of our bodies will be changed
[46:30] in a moment in a twinkling of an eye and
[46:34] Lord no matter how many different ways
[46:38] that you we see you manifest yourself
[46:42] nor do spiritual applications of that we
[46:46] still look forward to that corporal
[46:49] return because there is nothing there is
[46:52] nothing that can be a substitute for
[46:55] that Lord we look today for this new
[47:00] morning may this be the day that the
[47:04] dead in Christ rise
[47:06] may this be the day that we see our
[47:10] loved ones that are changed in a moment
[47:13] in a twinkling of an eye may this be the
[47:17] day Lord that is maybe just another
[47:21] ordinary day but becomes a very
[47:24] supernatural day as supernatural things
[47:27] begin to happen and Lord if this is not
[47:31] the day for that and still then we wait
[47:35] patiently for that coming with our
[47:38] hearts fervent and believing but Lord
[47:44] today in this service we know we can ask
[47:47] for this that there would just be
[47:50] another handful on purpose
[47:52] that you would drop among us until the
[47:56] day that we receive our full and
[47:59] complete Redemption
[48:00] Lord we look to that today and ask that
[48:04] the Angels Lord would just come among
[48:07] walk these pews and drop in front of
[48:10] every believer ever believed in child
[48:13] even those that are struggling with

[49:24] another in holy matrimony and to go
[49:29] forward together and I'm going to ask
[49:30] that couple to come here today brother

[50:24] when we see our young people and you

[50:42] what a wonderful couple amen we
[50:46] certainly think thank the Lord for them
[50:48] amen now we of course still have our
[50:53] brother Amos layin there and of course
[50:57] the doctors their report is they give
[51:01] him really no hope I present chance of
[51:06] surviving and but of course we know
[51:09] believers can't die right we know that
[51:12] and so we of course are as believers we
[51:17] always do what the Word of God says and
[51:21] that is we just keep praying and
[51:23] believing and expecting until God tells
[51:27] us no and then if he says no well then
[51:30] we like it we love his nose as well as
[51:32] we do his yeses a man and so right now
[51:36] it is you know as it was with Abraham
[51:40] against hope he believed in hope so you
[51:43] know there was no hope for Abraham he
[51:46] was past age as white past age but he
[51:50] just kept testifying and given glory to
[51:53] God and and so we today we continue just
[51:57] given God the glory
[51:59] God prays in everything even that the
[52:02] Lord takes away well then blessed be the
[52:04] name of the Lord
[52:04] we can't lose we're winners either way

[52:16] standing on his feet rejoicing and just
[52:19] you know now just right close to the
[52:22] very edge of crossing over and and we
[52:26] don't know from one time to the next
[52:29] you know just even from one service to
[52:32] the next you know what will happen or
[52:35] what kind of curves that lives life will
[52:38] bring but you know the main thing of it
[52:41] is is we be prepared to meet the Lord
[52:44] and we also need to realize the how
[52:48] precious one another is and to make
[52:52] every moment that we have together count
[52:54] you know when when you come to moment
[52:57] like this little doctrinal differences
[53:00] they don't make any difference you know
[53:02] little ideas a little feeler all of that
[53:06] all is gone you know now you focus on
[53:08] what's important why don't we just do
[53:11] that to begin with
[53:12] Amen just instead of waiting for a
[53:15] moment like this let's just focus right
[53:18] now on what's important a man and each
[53:21] one of you are important to him and a
[53:24] man god bless you it's good to be
[53:27] together this morning let's stand as we
[53:29] read the word I'm gonna get right into
[53:31] the message this morning we got lots of
[53:34] things going on today and just just
[53:40] trust the Lord will speak to you in a
[53:42] very very positive way and cause our
[53:47] minds to turn upon him numbers chapter
[53:51] 35 and verse 9 and and the Lord spake
[53:56] unto Moses saying speaking to the
[54:00] children of Israel and say unto them
[54:02] when you become over Jordan into the
[54:05] land of Canaan then you shall appoint
[54:08] you cities to be cities of refuge
[54:11] for you that the Slayer may flee thither
[54:15] which killeth any persons at unawares
[54:19] and they shall be under you cities for
[54:23] refuge from the Avenger that they men's
[54:27] lair die not until he stand before the
[54:30] congregation in judgment and of these
[54:33] cities which he shall give six cities
[54:37] shall how you have for refuge and and ye
[54:42] shall give three cities on this side of
[54:44] Jordan and three cities shall you give
[54:46] in the land of Canaan which shall be
[54:49] cities of refuge and these six cities
[54:53] shall be a refuge both for the children
[54:57] of Israel and for the stranger and for
[54:59] the Sojourner among them that everyone
[55:02] that killeth any person unawares may
[55:05] flee thither and if he smite him with an
[55:09] instrument of iron so that he die he is
[55:12] a murderer the murderer shall surely be
[55:16] put to death and if he's might him with
[55:19] throwing a stone wherewith he may die
[55:21] and he die he is a murderer the murderer
[55:25] shall surely be put to death or if he
[55:29] smite him with a hand weapon of wood
[55:32] wherewith he may die and he die he is a
[55:35] murderer the murderer shall surely be
[55:39] put to death
[55:40] the revenger of blood himself shall slay
[55:44] the murder when he meeteth him he shall
[55:48] slay him but if he thrust him of hatred
[55:52] or hurl at him by laying of weight that
[55:55] he die or in enmity smite him with his
[55:58] hand that he die he that smote him shall
[56:01] surely be put to death for he is a
[56:03] murderer the revenger of blood shall
[56:07] slay the murder when he meeteth him but
[56:11] if he thrust him suddenly without enmity
[56:15] and have cast upon him anything without
[56:18] layin of weight or with any stone
[56:22] wherewith a man may die
[56:24] seeing him not and cast it upon him that
[56:28] he died and was not his enemy neither
[56:32] sought his harm then the congregation
[56:34] shall judge between the Slayer and The
[56:37] Revenge of blood according to these
[56:39] judgments and the congregation shall
[56:42] deliver the Slayer out of the hand of
[56:45] the revenger of blood and the
[56:48] congregation shall restore him to the
[56:50] city of his refuge whether he was fled
[56:53] and he shall abide in it until the death
[56:56] of the high priest which was anointed
[56:58] with the holy oil but if the Slayer
[57:03] shall at any term come without the
[57:06] border of the city of his refuse whether
[57:09] he was fled and the revenger of blood
[57:12] find him without the borders of the city
[57:15] of refuge and a revenger of blood killed
[57:19] the Slayer he shall not be guilty of
[57:22] blood because he should have remained in
[57:26] the city of his refuge until the death
[57:29] of the high priests but after the death
[57:31] of the high priest the Slayer shall
[57:33] return into the land of his possession
[57:36] so these things shall be for a statute
[57:39] of judgement unto you throughout your
[57:42] generations in all your dwellings a man
[57:47] god bless you can take your seats we're
[57:49] going to speak this morning on the
[57:52] kinsman avenger the law of Reaper
[57:57] retribution is also called the law of
[58:01] retaliation it was a part of the Old
[58:04] Testament law that was given to Israel
[58:07] by Moses retribution was one of the
[58:11] cornerstones of israel's penal code and
[58:15] the punishment was always to mirror the
[58:20] crime the principle of the law is is
[58:24] found and you can look at it at a later
[58:27] time in Leviticus 24 that it basically
[58:30] says anyone who injures their neighbor
[58:32] is to be injured in the same manner
[58:36] fracture for fracture
[58:38] i for eye tooth for tooth the one who
[58:42] has inflicted the injury must must
[58:46] suffer the same injury and it even went
[58:51] right down to the livestock that was on
[58:54] their farms or the property that they
[58:56] owned such as animals
[58:58] whoever killed an animal had to make
[59:00] restitution
[59:01] but whoever would kill another human
[59:04] being was to be put to death
[59:06] and of course um you know under this
[59:10] penal code that would be monetary
[59:12] damages that would be paid for killing
[59:15] an animal belonging to someone else but
[59:17] like we said if a person is murdered
[59:20] then the murderer must forfeit his life
[59:23] in return so it was I 494 tooth life for
[59:27] life nights and Israel part of the law
[59:30] enforcement fell upon the family of the
[59:34] murder victim because they didn't have a
[59:37] police force in that ancient time so
[59:41] kids a kinship posses were were called
[59:45] on to enforce the law and so according
[59:49] to what we read in numbers that in some
[59:52] cases the Avenger of blood which would
[59:54] be the next of kin would be charged with
[59:57] carrying out the death sentence and even
[1:00:00] sometimes tracking down the murderer if
[1:00:03] the murder had fled so this is why that
[1:00:07] God would put into Israel these cities
[1:00:11] of refuge because there would be a place
[1:00:14] where the offender who had killed
[1:00:18] someone would run to this city and then
[1:00:21] it would be judged by the judges of that
[1:00:24] city and and find out if it was murder
[1:00:27] or manslaughter if it was just simply an
[1:00:31] accidental slaying well he can his life
[1:00:34] could be spared as long as he lived in
[1:00:37] that city if he was an intentional
[1:00:40] murderer had a nod in his heart and this
[1:00:43] could be proven that he had
[1:00:45] intentionally murdered his fellow
[1:00:47] brother within the Kinsmen
[1:00:50] would then put him to death without
[1:00:53] mercy now so the near kinsman had a
[1:00:57] righteous charge I want you to get this
[1:01:00] this this was a part of their honor the
[1:01:03] part of their the charge that they had
[1:01:06] as being a kinsman and that righteous
[1:01:10] charge would be to avenge I repay
[1:01:15] vengeance for harm done to his kin
[1:01:18] or it would even include redeeming his
[1:01:21] fellow brother from slavery or even the
[1:01:25] land that he had lost to buy it back and
[1:01:29] to bring a restoration now in order for
[1:01:32] there to be redemption redemption has to
[1:01:35] begin with a loss all right
[1:01:38] so looking at the Old Testament law on
[1:01:41] the new near kinsman and and that he
[1:01:45] would many times if he had the wealth
[1:01:48] and was willing to do so he could pay
[1:01:51] for that unfortunate kin that had fallen
[1:01:54] so far into poverty and and and been
[1:01:59] sold as a slave and and so he would
[1:02:01] redeem him and and also his property
[1:02:05] even though he had lost it all that God
[1:02:10] provided in his law a way that the Lamb
[1:02:13] could not be sold forever
[1:02:15] and even he was not to be sold forever
[1:02:18] but he provided a way for redemption now
[1:02:23] of course this all looked back to the
[1:02:25] Garden of Eden where a man lost and he
[1:02:29] lost his possession he was king of the
[1:02:31] earth he was lord over the earth and the
[1:02:34] earth was for him to subdue and to
[1:02:38] maintain and to make into a Garden of
[1:02:41] Eden and God would look back all the way
[1:02:44] to Eden and and know that even though
[1:02:48] his son was lost that that would have to
[1:02:52] come a next-of-kin to provide a redeemer
[1:02:56] to redeem man from the horrible fall in
[1:03:01] the slavery under sin now of course with
[1:03:05] Israel the Lord promised that his people
[1:03:08] would obey the commands of the Covenant
[1:03:10] they would retain the land and that
[1:03:14] never again would they be captives or
[1:03:16] slaves to another nation as he had been
[1:03:20] down in Egypt and the land itself would
[1:03:24] be to them a daily reminder of the
[1:03:26] freedom and the blessings that God had
[1:03:29] bestowed on them and the continued
[1:03:32] possession over each family's allotted
[1:03:35] portion of land was really really
[1:03:38] important in that day to maintain their
[1:03:41] social structure so that God would then
[1:03:45] he would see to it that there were laws
[1:03:48] that were set into place so that no
[1:03:51] family could permanently lose their land
[1:03:54] forever I think this is should be a very
[1:03:58] heartening to us today that no matter
[1:04:01] how long it's been
[1:04:03] we already know that the kinsman is at
[1:04:06] work to bring us back to where we fell
[1:04:11] from and that he's very conscious of
[1:04:14] this now and because it is his honor it
[1:04:17] is his righteousness which compels him
[1:04:21] to do this now the Hebrew word for this
[1:04:25] kinsman redeemer would be called the go
[1:04:28] el which means to redeem to act as
[1:04:31] kinsman redeemer to avenge revenge to to
[1:04:36] to ransom to do his part is a kinsman
[1:04:40] and as a next to kin act as a kinsman
[1:04:44] redeemer and in the case of Ruth that we
[1:04:47] spoke on last time you know was he where
[1:04:50] there would bow as being the near
[1:04:53] kinsman would marry his his brothers are
[1:04:56] his relatives Widow to beget a child for
[1:04:59] him in order to restore and keep that
[1:05:02] land in the family name and and to have
[1:05:07] an inheritance it would also make
[1:05:10] reasons to redeem from slavery to redeem
[1:05:13] land and then to finally to exact
[1:05:16] vengeance now we know that mankind was
[1:05:20] lost and he needed redemption and
[1:05:24] redemption is the purchase of that which
[1:05:26] has been lost or sold into slavery this
[1:05:30] is why he come to say the son of man
[1:05:33] came to seek and to save that which was
[1:05:36] lost so that which was lost from him
[1:05:40] that which was his in the beginning is
[1:05:42] why that he came in order to be a
[1:05:46] kinsman to seek and to save that which
[1:05:49] was lost
[1:05:51] now so um you know in the Exodus we
[1:05:55] remember that in the Old Testament there
[1:05:58] the blood of the Lamb would purchase or
[1:06:01] redeem the life of the firstborn Hebrew
[1:06:05] children and and delivered Israel from
[1:06:08] bondage down in in Egypt and of course
[1:06:12] it was it was foreshadowing and telling
[1:06:16] of a greater lamb that would come and
[1:06:19] this Lamb of God would purchase us with
[1:06:23] his own blood from the bondage of sin
[1:06:26] and death and delivered us to a new
[1:06:29] spiritual life in him so the the the
[1:06:32] lamb symbolically represented the
[1:06:36] Redeemer and his work as kinsman and so
[1:06:41] when we see the book of Revelation and
[1:06:43] it protray ins symbolically the
[1:06:47] different symbols it it would represent
[1:06:50] this whole story of redemption by
[1:06:53] showing a lamb a lamb that had been
[1:06:57] slain and this lamb would would
[1:07:00] symbolically represent the kinsman
[1:07:04] redeemer and his work now remember as I
[1:07:06] said when we look in Revelation 4 and 5
[1:07:10] and these are not these are not a moment
[1:07:13] twinkling eye events these are events
[1:07:15] that begins with one sitting on the
[1:07:17] throne happened the questioned book in
[1:07:19] hand then the call for a kinsman and
[1:07:22] that and then there to do that the one
[1:07:25] on the throne would have to become the
[1:07:27] lamb a man and paid the price of
[1:07:30] redemption and then he would be slain
[1:07:32] and there intercede and then he would go
[1:07:36] forth and he would take the question
[1:07:38] book of title in order to restore that
[1:07:41] which was lost
[1:07:42] back to mankind and finally it would
[1:07:45] conclude with all creation worshiping
[1:07:48] God now so the book of Revelation four
[1:07:53] treys how that he would come and would
[1:07:56] take on flesh you know
[1:07:59] God had said the soul that sinneth it
[1:08:02] shall die so there was a death sentence
[1:08:06] that was passed over all of us and the
[1:08:10] end um and it's he said that soul is
[1:08:13] separated from me and I'm just gonna
[1:08:15] share some quotations from the church
[1:08:17] age book and you know that I'm sharing
[1:08:19] this from the church's book and you can
[1:08:22] go back and look at it um where brother
[1:08:24] Branham would talk about this on page
[1:08:26] 136 and I'll just share this pardon we
[1:08:30] won't show it on the screen this morning
[1:08:32] but you know God looked down and
[1:08:34] declared the soul that sinneth it shall
[1:08:36] die it is separated from me it can't
[1:08:39] approach son to me we know that all have
[1:08:42] sinned and fallen short of the glory of
[1:08:44] God that meant all died and all were
[1:08:48] separated and one day a time would come
[1:08:52] that when even that bit of life would be
[1:08:55] snuffed out and it would be all over but
[1:08:58] God in love hallelujah took an animal
[1:09:02] and took his life and the place of the
[1:09:05] sinners life so you go right back and
[1:09:08] you see the first thing when man sinned
[1:09:11] it required the taking of another life
[1:09:15] life for life hey man so in the Old
[1:09:19] Testament the sinner would bring a lamb
[1:09:21] and he would place hidden hand of the
[1:09:25] lamb or his hand on the lamb while the
[1:09:28] priest cut the lambs throat and he felt
[1:09:31] the bleeding and they heard the bleeding
[1:09:35] felt the body stiffen and death and he
[1:09:39] saw the smoke of the sprinkled blood as
[1:09:42] send to God and he knew that that lamb
[1:09:45] had taken his place he knew that the
[1:09:48] Lambs life had been forfeited for his
[1:09:52] but the life of that lamb was animal
[1:09:56] life and it could not come back up on
[1:09:58] the sinner making him clean so he left
[1:10:01] with the same desire to sin and he would
[1:10:04] go out with sin in his mind and would
[1:10:07] come back with a sacrifice for the same
[1:10:10] thing a year later but in the New
[1:10:13] Testament it is not so hallelujah our
[1:10:19] dine lamb is the son of God who gave his
[1:10:22] blood as a ransom for many
[1:10:24] by faith now listen to this church you
[1:10:28] see by faith we walk up and place our
[1:10:32] hands upon that land and we see him with
[1:10:37] his bloody wounds and the lacerated back
[1:10:40] the cruel thorns carried his brow we
[1:10:44] feel his pain and hear him cry my God my
[1:10:48] God why hast thou forsaken me and what
[1:10:51] happened to life that left that broken
[1:10:54] blood cell came back upon the repented
[1:10:57] one and that life that was in him came
[1:11:00] back upon us and we go back with no more
[1:11:03] desire to sin and we now possess a
[1:11:07] hatred for the works and the lusts of
[1:11:10] the flesh now let me just say to you if
[1:11:13] what is being preached does not result
[1:11:16] in that kind of as experience if your
[1:11:18] doctrine or your faith doesn't allow you
[1:11:22] to walk up and put your hands of all
[1:11:25] that Lamb amen and see his bloody wounds
[1:11:29] and his lacerated back and the cruel
[1:11:33] thorns in his tearing his brow if your
[1:11:37] faith doesn't allow you to touch a high
[1:11:41] priest with a bloody sacrifice but just
[1:11:44] acquaint you with a doctrine you're just
[1:11:47] offering in a bloodless sacrifice
[1:11:49] hey man this is this is a this is just a
[1:11:53] cane offering the Bloodless worship this
[1:11:57] is why that you know that people today
[1:11:59] are filled with such murder in their
[1:12:02] hearts and they try to kill those who
[1:12:04] really do worship in the spirit this is
[1:12:08] why the murder spirit is in the hearts
[1:12:11] of some men who wants to take away
[1:12:13] inspirational songs that bring people
[1:12:16] back to the heart of worship and when
[1:12:19] the heart of worship should be about a
[1:12:22] love relation with Jesus Christ hey man
[1:12:26] it's a if your faith doesn't take you
[1:12:29] first to Calvary hey man let me day any
[1:12:33] revelation that's what I'm calling faith
[1:12:35] if your revelation if this great mystery
[1:12:38] doesn't take you first to Calvary where
[1:12:42] you're crucified on the cross with your
[1:12:44] sacrifice until sin nature is dead
[1:12:48] you'll always be like King and then
[1:12:51] attracted murdered those who have
[1:12:53] spiritual worship now this is why
[1:12:56] there's no miracles in the churches this
[1:12:59] is why the signs don't follow them that
[1:13:01] believe they believe in a lie
[1:13:04] they're worshipping under a bloodless
[1:13:06] worship even the foolish virgins brother
[1:13:09] Evan said they go through the
[1:13:11] tribulation because they think they're
[1:13:13] under the blood but they're not but I'll
[1:13:15] tell you what we want we want blood in
[1:13:18] our worship a man what is the blood it's
[1:13:21] the spirit it's the life that was in the
[1:13:23] blood and we want we wanted to float
[1:13:26] down and cleanse it and take starchiness
[1:13:29] out of us and unbelief out of us and put
[1:13:33] a real worship back to God we're the
[1:13:36] holy life with a dedicated life hey man
[1:13:40] now it's the evil of denomination that
[1:13:45] offers atonement without blood remember
[1:13:49] this we must have blood with our
[1:13:53] atonement nothing else will do it
[1:13:57] and as I said you can have a doctor you
[1:14:00] can have the great mysteries
[1:14:02] you can know many many things about the
[1:14:05] Bible but until your revelation brings
[1:14:10] you to the point what that you see a
[1:14:13] bloody sacrifice when you lay your hands
[1:14:17] upon him and your sins are transmitted
[1:14:20] from you to him
[1:14:22] and his righteousness flows back to you
[1:14:24] all of your great revelation is in vain
[1:14:28] it's just a Cain offering now in the
[1:14:35] Sermon smyrnaean church eh brother batam
[1:14:39] explains about that blood cell he said
[1:14:40] look at us he said what is our life
[1:14:44] just one little sale that came from our
[1:14:47] Father the female doesn't have the
[1:14:50] hemoglobin she produces eggs he's an
[1:14:53] incubator but the blood comes from the
[1:14:56] male that's why the woman takes the
[1:14:58] man's name the children take his name
[1:15:02] the mother is the incubator for the
[1:15:04] children she bears him and this is what
[1:15:07] has happened for our Redemption the Holy
[1:15:10] Ghost came upon Mary and she bore a son
[1:15:13] and called him Jesus the Great Creator
[1:15:17] came down and became a sacrifice for our
[1:15:21] sin his blood was the blood of God
[1:15:25] happens with me this morning man that's
[1:15:28] exactly what it was that blood of God
[1:15:30] was shed and the spirit left him as he
[1:15:34] died in agony then the same life spirit
[1:15:38] came back to indwell
[1:15:39] the repented sinner and set him free and
[1:15:43] that sinner did not have to come back
[1:15:45] year after year sacrifice have to
[1:15:47] sacrifice but there was no knee but by
[1:15:51] one sacrifice once overall he has been
[1:15:54] set free from the Dominion of sin and
[1:15:57] has received the life of Christ whereby
[1:15:59] he raised in victory over sin the world
[1:16:04] the flesh and the devil Oh glory to God
[1:16:07] I'm glad to be speaking to a victorious
[1:16:10] church this loony God did it he did it
[1:16:13] all he cried out
[1:16:15] to the world Kirsten sealed I will give
[1:16:18] you a side of birds and sabira child a
[1:16:21] virgin shall conceive and bear a son and
[1:16:25] this will be your sign it will be an
[1:16:27] everlasting sign what she brings forth
[1:16:30] will be Immanuel God with us
[1:16:35] hallelujah God came down in a blood
[1:16:39] cells don't you ever forget this don't
[1:16:43] you ever forget how he became kin to you
[1:16:46] God came down in a blood cell not
[1:16:50] through man but by the Holy Ghost and in
[1:16:53] that birds in womb in that virgin womb a
[1:16:58] tabernacle for the purpose of death was
[1:17:00] built the seed of the woman came in
[1:17:03] order that he be bruised to bring us our
[1:17:06] salvation and when the Holy Ghost came
[1:17:09] upon Mary he created within her womb the
[1:17:13] cell that would multiply and become the
[1:17:16] body of our Lord and that cell was
[1:17:18] created it was the beginning of the
[1:17:21] creation of God that's who Jesus is and
[1:17:24] that Holy One was filled with holy blood
[1:17:27] even the blood of God the tabernacle
[1:17:30] came to birth he grew to a man he went
[1:17:33] to Jordan and there that sacrifice was
[1:17:36] lost of John in the river court called
[1:17:39] Jordan and when that acceptable
[1:17:41] sacrifice rose up out of the water God
[1:17:44] came and dwelt him filling him with the
[1:17:47] spirit without measure and when he died
[1:17:49] and shed his blood the perfect life of
[1:17:53] God was liberated to come back upon the
[1:17:56] sinner who would accept Christ as his
[1:17:58] Savior amen what a wonderful plan oh how
[1:18:03] striking it is Jehovah born crying over
[1:18:08] a manure pile
[1:18:10] Jehovah born in a manger of straw that's
[1:18:14] your everlasting sign to the proud and
[1:18:17] puffed up pseudo-intellectuals that have
[1:18:21] evolved their own theology and denied
[1:18:23] the truth of God Jehovah God a crying
[1:18:26] baby in
[1:18:28] chicken barn and then we think we have a
[1:18:30] right to be proud holding up our noses

[1:18:35] somebody here's your real sign this is
[1:18:39] the right one jehovah playing as a boy

[1:18:52] sign of a white colored priesthood
[1:18:54] not the sign of wealth and power but
[1:18:57] there's nothing in a sign you would or
[1:18:59] think is suitable but it is an
[1:19:01] everlasting sign it's the greatest sign
[1:19:04] of all Jehovah standing in the courtyard
[1:19:07] bruised and bleeding with thorns on his
[1:19:11] brow and spit on his face and locked and
[1:19:15] said it not Jehovah despised and
[1:19:18] rejected hanging naked upon the cross
[1:19:21] while hypocrites jeered and dared him to
[1:19:25] come down off the cross
[1:19:26] Jehovah dying to over prayin and nothing
[1:19:30] happening did you over died that is the
[1:19:34] sign for all men now there's not another
[1:19:36] like it it's the great one hallelu you

[1:19:42] everlasting sign we're under today Amen

[1:20:06] upon it
[1:20:08] hallelujah receive of those virtuous
[1:20:10] that's what our revelation ought to
[1:20:13] include this morning here not include
[1:20:16] that righteous one who laid down his
[1:20:19] life so we could become righteous then
[1:20:22] he said after his death and darkness
[1:20:24] came on the earth
[1:20:25] they put him in a tomb there he laid

[1:20:30] earthquake shattered the gloom of night
[1:20:32] and he came forth jehovah came forth

[1:21:17] you and a man Jehovah came down and he
[1:21:20] raised the prostitute to sin no more he
[1:21:25] came down to the drunkard with flat
[1:21:27] blows on his face as he lay unconscious
[1:21:30] in the gutter yester OVA came to
[1:21:33] manifest in the flesh and manifest
[1:21:36] through flesh Jehovah came God in us the
[1:21:39] hope of glory yes Jesus came and said
[1:21:43] his blood led the captives free he came

[1:21:50] never perish he will not lose a one of
[1:21:53] them but will raise him up at the last
[1:21:56] day hallelujah the second death cannot
[1:21:59] hurt them and then it has no power it
[1:22:04] has no power over them but they are the
[1:22:06] Lambs and they follow him wherever he
[1:22:09] goes hey man all aren't you glad you
[1:22:14] belong to the lamb and get ready to
[1:22:16] switch programs for me man now notice
[1:22:19] here hid it was God came down to dwell
[1:22:24] in flash among us it was God that would
[1:22:28] come to becoming kinfolks to take away
[1:22:31] our sins and at the redeeming church he
[1:22:35] took the death that we could not pay and
[1:22:39] that he did not make
[1:22:41] that we had foolishly done and a wasted
[1:22:45] life and wasted years and he took it
[1:22:48] there and paid your sin debt I say what
[1:22:54] a savior that is what a kinsman that is
[1:22:57] that God would come down among us hey
[1:23:03] ma'am oh that's not something of 2,000
[1:23:05] years ago he's right here in this people
[1:23:08] this morning
[1:23:09] Tuoba coming down to heal the sick to
[1:23:12] raise the dead to confirm his word one
[1:23:16] more time this is our God now there's a
[1:23:23] question book when we seem in Revelation
[1:23:28] 5 coming down to this question book and
[1:23:32] he comes to claim the book but to claim
[1:23:37] the book is only begin the beginning
[1:23:41] releasing seals is is only given faith
[1:23:46] revelation to his people that this book
[1:23:50] is theirs it's all a process of his
[1:23:55] Redemption it is not the ceasing of
[1:23:58] redemption it is the continuation of
[1:24:02] redemption
[1:24:03] it isn't that redemption is over it is
[1:24:07] that redemption is being finalized a man
[1:24:12] being fulfilled now brother Branham
[1:24:14] would say in the breech he hasn't
[1:24:16] claimed it yet you see he hadn't claimed
[1:24:20] it see if he took the book of Redemption
[1:24:23] everything that Adam had and everything
[1:24:26] that he lost Christ redeems back and
[1:24:31] he's already redeemed us were needy
[1:24:34] redeem us at the cross by one offering
[1:24:37] he paid for all the sins of all the
[1:24:41] seven ages he redeemed us
[1:24:43] the cross is that right buddy hasn't
[1:24:48] taken possession yet hey man oh no take
[1:24:53] it even the book is not him taking
[1:24:55] possession it is only taking possession
[1:24:58] of its title and his claim for
[1:25:00] redemption all right now
[1:25:04] he cannot notice he cannot what's his
[1:25:08] words now he hasn't taken really hasn't
[1:25:11] taken possession yet he cannot until the
[1:25:15] time appointed so there's a time
[1:25:19] appointed he's going to take possession
[1:25:22] hey man but notice when it happens then
[1:25:26] we'll come the resurrection and then the
[1:25:31] earth will be renewed again that's for
[1:25:33] the millennial reign and then he will
[1:25:36] take the possession his possession which
[1:25:39] he got when he redeemed us but we'll do
[1:25:43] it at the appointed time so the
[1:25:46] appointed time includes the resurrection
[1:25:49] it includes the rapture of the church it
[1:25:52] includes even renewing the earth a man a
[1:25:56] man and then he will take possession of
[1:26:00] the earth and be the king of the earth
[1:26:02] and I word that the first matter man
[1:26:05] Adam lost the kingship of the earth the
[1:26:07] second man Adam will regain the kingship
[1:26:11] of the earth he'll take control now
[1:26:14] because why of his redeeming works so he
[1:26:18] will claim in his claim at work he will
[1:26:21] claim both the living and the dead
[1:26:26] hallelujah aim at the living and the
[1:26:30] dead
[1:26:31] so the claiming work isn't over until
[1:26:34] the resurrection hallelujah amen sue so
[1:26:40] you see it's all a part of his great
[1:26:42] work as kinsman redeemer this is his
[1:26:46] process this is what he's doing now a
[1:26:50] man finishing up Redemption given faith
[1:26:54] to the elect
[1:26:55] getting them ready for a resurrection
[1:26:57] that's what this message how to do for
[1:27:00] you it ought to get you ready for a
[1:27:02] resurrection hey man now we're going to
[1:27:06] look at revelation 5 and 6 when the call
[1:27:09] rang out for a man who was worthy it's a
[1:27:14] lamb that stepped forth why because God
[1:27:18] became a man the kinsman to purchase us
[1:27:23] with his own blood so if you look here
[1:27:28] in Revelation 5 and and any and he tells
[1:27:31] us in Revelation 5 and and 6 and behar
[1:27:34] beheld and lo in the midst of the throne
[1:27:36] in the end of the four beasts and the
[1:27:39] midst of the elders stood a lamb as it
[1:27:42] had been slain having seven horns and
[1:27:45] seven eyes notice he was a lamb stood a
[1:27:49] lamb I want you to notice this a lamb
[1:27:53] step forth this is not a lion he's not
[1:27:57] coming as a king he is coming as an
[1:28:00] Assessor he has to take the book as an
[1:28:05] intercessor as a kinsman redeemer yes he
[1:28:10] is lying he is a king but he's not yet
[1:28:13] king of the earth he is our king he's
[1:28:17] king of saints and we have a kingdom and
[1:28:20] that kingdom is within us it's not of
[1:28:22] this world
[1:28:23] come on somebody a man says not an
[1:28:26] earthly Kingdom yet but there's going to
[1:28:28] be an earthly Kingdom and everything
[1:28:32] that can be seeking is going to be
[1:28:33] shaken oh yeah he had it was a lamb as
[1:28:38] it had been slain so notice what took
[1:28:42] the book it would be the lamb taking the
[1:28:47] book now he is not changing roles he
[1:28:52] hears he is in the process of becoming
[1:28:57] king of the earth but he first has got
[1:29:00] to do and finish his work of kinsmen
[1:29:05] before he reigns on the earth
[1:29:08] he's got to do the role of
[1:29:10] kinsman-redeemer
[1:29:12] and that also includes the role of
[1:29:14] kinsman avenger now so we see in verse
[1:29:20] eight and when she the lamb had taken
[1:29:25] the book the four beasts and the four
[1:29:29] twenty elders now that four and twenty
[1:29:31] elders represents the entire bride of
[1:29:34] old and new testament the twelve
[1:29:37] patriarchs representing Israel the
[1:29:39] Twelve Apostles representing the bride
[1:29:42] the church come on and there they fell
[1:29:46] down before the lamb having every one of
[1:29:48] them harps and golden vials full of
[1:29:51] odours which are the prayers of the
[1:29:53] Saints why is this they had been praying
[1:29:55] all of these years for his coming for
[1:30:01] the resurrection and here they hold them
[1:30:04] and then they sung a new song saying
[1:30:07] thou art worthy to take the book and to
[1:30:11] open the seals for that was slain and
[1:30:14] has redeemed us to God by blood I want
[1:30:21] you to understand that book is redeemed
[1:30:23] by blood the people of the book I
[1:30:27] redeemed by blood it took blood to
[1:30:32] redeem us no other price could do it
[1:30:34] a mound nothing less than the blood of
[1:30:38] God and here God would become the
[1:30:41] kinfolk in order to make a bring a blood
[1:30:44] that could make a proper atonement
[1:30:46] because the blood of bulls and goats
[1:30:48] could never take away sin now so you
[1:30:54] have redeemed us by thy blood out of
[1:30:57] every kindred tongue that's nation and
[1:31:00] people and nation notice from all
[1:31:04] languages people and nations and it
[1:31:08] would tell us in verse 12 that the lamb
[1:31:11] is the limit is worthy notice they are
[1:31:15] not singing worthy is the king or worthy
[1:31:19] is the lion
[1:31:20] because they're not crowning him as king
[1:31:23] the crowning of him as king of kings and
[1:31:26] Lord of lords a place until the dead to
[1:31:30] Revelation 19 and man will do when he
[1:31:33] comes back with his saints are you with
[1:31:36] me then he comes back as a crown king
[1:31:39] taking over the earth but right now he's
[1:31:42] not king of the earth a man Satan is the
[1:31:47] Prince of the power of atmospheres he is
[1:31:50] the prince of this world he is the god
[1:31:53] of this evil age he is the Satan is the
[1:31:57] one that is worship here except by a few
[1:32:00] of us thank God we got a different God
[1:32:02] than Satan hey ma'am but notice he is
[1:32:06] our King
[1:32:07] but notice they're not saying worthy is
[1:32:10] the king who were thee is the lion but
[1:32:13] they're saying worthy is the lamb and
[1:32:17] it's the Lamb that was slain and he's
[1:32:21] worthy to receive power riches wisdom
[1:32:24] strength honor glory and blessing he is
[1:32:28] unworthy to receive the kingship he is
[1:32:35] the man worthy to pick up where Adam he
[1:32:40] is a man worthy to become the king of
[1:32:43] the earth but he does this he does this
[1:32:49] as the lamb in order to do to become
[1:32:54] king he has to become kinsmen and
[1:32:57] without becoming kinsmen
[1:32:59] he can't take possession of the earth
[1:33:02] now notice he is king but he hasn't
[1:33:08] taken the millennial throne yet
[1:33:12] revelation 5:13 this this process of
[1:33:17] redemption continues in this scene and
[1:33:20] remember this is a scene of his
[1:33:22] Redemption and the na8 continues until
[1:33:26] every creature which is in heaven on the
[1:33:29] earth under the earth such as I'm to see
[1:33:31] and all that are in the
[1:33:33] heard I sayin blessing and honor and
[1:33:36] glory and power be unto him that sitteth
[1:33:39] upon the throne and upon the lamb for
[1:33:41] ever and ever
[1:33:42] then the four beasts said amen and the
[1:33:44] four living four and twenty elders fell
[1:33:47] down and worship Him that liveth for
[1:33:49] ever and ever notice this so we can see
[1:33:53] here that it continues to all creation
[1:33:57] worships and the groaning for the earth
[1:34:00] is over with and as long as the world is
[1:34:06] in a groaning condition are you with me
[1:34:10] under the reign of Satan there under the
[1:34:14] groaning condition and as long as
[1:34:16] they're under a groaning condition that
[1:34:19] then he's not king over the earth yet
[1:34:22] but when he comes all the groaning will
[1:34:27] be over and it will all turn to a
[1:34:30] worship and all creation will worship it
[1:34:34] will cease his groaning the trees will
[1:34:37] quit dying the animals will cook killing
[1:34:40] each other the lion will lay down by the
[1:34:43] lamp
[1:34:43] the King was said about his throne with
[1:34:46] his bride and together man will rule the
[1:34:51] earth for a thousand years
[1:34:55] hallelujah
[1:34:56] oh my I think he you know John when he
[1:35:00] wants this brother branham thought he
[1:35:02] got so carried away told everybody
[1:35:04] everything even though I was in the sea
[1:35:06] was hearing John say it because he can
[1:35:08] just imagine himself being there
[1:35:12] hallelujah he can imagine himself being
[1:35:15] placed there what would I do
[1:35:16] I'll ask you what would you do when all
[1:35:19] the groaning is over
[1:35:21] what callus shouting are we gonna do
[1:35:23] what kind of praise is gonna go forth
[1:35:26] what kind of worship you think we get a
[1:35:29] little wild here hey man wait till we
[1:35:31] step there oh well I dance for you Jesus
[1:35:34] I don't know
[1:35:36] we'll run around while I shot what I'm
[1:35:38] kneel down I'll probably do it all hey
[1:35:41] man when I make him the king of this
[1:35:45] earth when his Saints shall crown him
[1:35:50] lord over all no I want you to see
[1:35:59] revelation 6:1 it is the lamb that
[1:36:04] opened the seals it was not him doing it
[1:36:09] as king as king he held the question
[1:36:13] title deed but the earth was made for
[1:36:16] man in order for for it to come to back
[1:36:20] to his rightful owner then God would
[1:36:22] have to become a man and this lamb is
[1:36:26] representing his kinsmen work now
[1:36:29] remember he is not I will alam he's not
[1:36:32] this funny-looking odd-looking thing
[1:36:34] with seven horns seven eyes and he's not
[1:36:37] some weird-looking creature with wool on
[1:36:40] him and hooves there and he walks up
[1:36:42] there standing there with his wit on his
[1:36:44] back hooves and taking his front hooves
[1:36:46] and and then taking the book that's not
[1:36:50] him it's only symbolic of when the King
[1:36:57] laid aside his majesty and his ropes and
[1:37:03] robed himself in a pauper's robe like
[1:37:07] ours one that could have a headache one
[1:37:11] that could get sick one that could die
[1:37:14] one that could bear you infirmities one
[1:37:17] that he could be tempted in a man where
[1:37:21] he could face everything you face as a
[1:37:23] kinsman as what have you and this lamb
[1:37:29] is representing his kinsman redeemer
[1:37:32] work this is what he did to become one
[1:37:37] of you when you couldn't become God and
[1:37:41] you couldn't go up to heaven heaven came
[1:37:43] down to you aren't you glad heaven
[1:37:46] opened for you
[1:37:47] arching up God descended a man he didn't
[1:37:51] send a second person or third person he
[1:37:54] came himself created a body in the womb
[1:37:58] of Mary and stepped into that body Jesus
[1:38:02] who says not me that does this work as a
[1:38:05] human I can't do this
[1:38:06] but it's my father that dwells in me
[1:38:08] it's a turtle spirit that has come to
[1:38:12] Tabernacle of man there's nobody else
[1:38:15] could ever say that did you hear me
[1:38:18] and then there was nobody else could
[1:38:20] ever say that a man ray was in all the
[1:38:24] fullness of God dwelt in him a man
[1:38:28] notice notice now as we look but he's
[1:38:33] not just the kids 'men Redeemer he is
[1:38:38] also sins man Avenger now I want to show
[1:38:43] you here in revelation 6 16 and he's in
[1:38:47] the end this is in the sixth seal and
[1:38:49] they said to the mountains and the rocks
[1:38:51] fall on us and hide us from the face of
[1:38:55] him that sitteth on the throne and from
[1:38:57] the what wrath the wrath of the Lamb now
[1:39:05] you know many times we get two we get a
[1:39:08] picture of the Lamb and in being just a
[1:39:12] little meek lowly little little baby and
[1:39:16] like a goat kid or a suckling lamb in
[1:39:20] your arms and they can be so gentle and
[1:39:23] so sweet but this is not portraying a
[1:39:30] gentle lamp this is per Dib this is
[1:39:35] showing the wrap and this lamb this Ram
[1:39:41] has seven arms are you with me amen and
[1:39:48] this how many has ever heard of a
[1:39:51] battering ram well because you know we
[1:39:55] think of many times of a lamb being
[1:39:57] defenseless and certainly Jesus laid
[1:40:00] down his
[1:40:01] he was he went before the shearers is
[1:40:03] dumb he portrayed all the part of the
[1:40:06] innocence II and the meekness and the
[1:40:09] loneliness and the submissiveness and
[1:40:13] the dying and the bleeding and the cried
[1:40:17] the man despised and rejected he pro
[1:40:22] trade all of that but here is not that
[1:40:25] same portrayal this is the other side of
[1:40:29] the RAM are you with me and this is he's
[1:40:34] got rats now you know if you know you
[1:40:38] you have that different animals however
[1:40:40] ever animal can defend its its its
[1:40:44] babies in its own ways maybe some have
[1:40:48] long legs and they together can outrun
[1:40:50] their the Predators and they have
[1:40:53] different ways but you know we're there
[1:40:55] with a goat with a goat would you walk
[1:40:58] into the hill where a goat ears were a
[1:41:01] bucky as' he won't he won't get up on
[1:41:05] his back hoods he will come up and bring
[1:41:09] his head up like this and he'll bend it
[1:41:11] down and ran with his whole body force
[1:41:14] knock you to the ground that's a goat
[1:41:17] but a ram his own no defenseless animal
[1:41:24] when old Ram comes let's say he weighs
[1:41:29] 300 pounds he's got his horns and when
[1:41:35] he is threatened and his flock is
[1:41:37] threatened and I in fact of the matter
[1:41:39] is many Shepherds have to actually put a
[1:41:41] blinder only on the Rams on their very
[1:41:46] heads to keep them from seeing a head
[1:41:49] they can only see sideways that way you
[1:41:52] know when they they run they're only
[1:41:53] running this way and and the cake get a
[1:41:56] good aim because when a Rama comes at
[1:42:00] you and there have been a many a farmer
[1:42:03] that has been hurt by his own Rams but
[1:42:06] they won't put their head down and run
[1:42:09] with her full force
[1:42:11] right toward their target and bama with
[1:42:14] their 300-pound force and bam and bam
[1:42:18] and bam until they shattered their enemy
[1:42:23] so what the battering ram was far it was
[1:42:26] taking a big-block head of a of a log
[1:42:29] and manma eight or ten men get on it
[1:42:32] back up and run forward and with all of
[1:42:35] their weight and force ram ram and ram
[1:42:40] and hit that gate until it would be
[1:42:43] crushed well let me tell you the wrath
[1:42:47] of the Lamb is no small thing to deal
[1:42:50] with well he gets that to you when this
[1:42:54] kinsman gets him on a trail they nothing
[1:42:58] gonna stop him because ain't no binders
[1:43:00] on this one
[1:43:01] Amen he's got seven eyes seven horns oh
[1:43:06] he comes with his whole full power the
[1:43:09] wrath of the Lamb and it's in the
[1:43:11] tribulation he still lamb notice he

[1:43:22] changing roles hey man he's going to
[1:43:26] start avenging bringing revenge of honor

[1:43:34] his word who have rejected him who have

[1:47:59] righteous thing what's now what's the
[1:48:04] wording here a righteous thing you see

[1:48:09] righteousness these are my kinfolk and
[1:48:13] it's my own righteousness it's it's it's
[1:48:16] why it's my honor I mean it's a
[1:48:20] righteous thing with God to recompense
[1:48:23] that means to payback tribulation to
[1:48:28] them that trouble you what do you think

[1:48:32] and a half years of tribulations come on

[1:48:53] the mountain because of the wrath of the
[1:48:55] Lamb amen Satan will be judged though
[1:49:00] the church system will be judged the
[1:49:02] Beast will be judged just don't be there
[1:49:06] hey man cuz there's gonna be an awful
[1:49:08] time the earth is gonna is about to go
[1:49:13] that some of the worst calamities has
[1:49:15] ever went through we're on the border
[1:49:18] right now seeing pre-tribulation plagues
[1:49:20] already coming we're right on the border
[1:49:24] of it all taking place hey man
[1:49:27] but he said glob of paper tribulation to
[1:49:32] them that trouble you and to you who are
[1:49:36] troubled rest the man what was root
[1:49:40] doing her stage before he took
[1:49:44] possession before he took her as his
[1:49:46] bride and took her in now you say old
[1:49:49] brother Tim he's already taken the
[1:49:51] system right no he's in the process when
[1:49:54] he takes his bride he's taking her to
[1:49:57] the marriage supper are you with me
[1:50:00] but right now he's just called
[1:50:02] her out to himself now so but but right
[1:50:07] now we are in the resting stage remember
[1:50:10] Ruth deciding and Ruth working and then
[1:50:14] finally Ruth rusting and then finally
[1:50:17] Ruth rewarded amen and our reward is
[1:50:21] going to get a new home a new body and
[1:50:27] when we see I'm not going home in this
[1:50:29] world anymore
[1:50:30] I don't know about you but I'm talking
[1:50:32] about this thing too I'm not at home in
[1:50:34] this anymore
[1:50:35] but a minute don't mind me the way it
[1:50:38] used to
[1:50:38] it hurts me it groans it there's travail
[1:50:42] then this old house is in decay is it
[1:50:45] shudders needs repair it's his roof is
[1:50:48] getting thin on top hey man this weather
[1:50:52] and in turning gray here it is you know
[1:50:55] didn't this is this is on this old house
[1:50:58] but all brother he's gonna recompense
[1:51:02] trouble to those who had troubled us hey
[1:51:05] man listen
[1:51:07] he said rest with us when the Lord Jesus
[1:51:10] shall be revealed from heaven with his
[1:51:13] mighty angels hallelujah he said while
[1:51:18] he house had been revealed with mighty
[1:51:21] angels yes he revealed himself with
[1:51:23] mighty angels where in him in Abraham's
[1:51:26] day he revealed himself with mighty
[1:51:27] angels in Elijah's day he revealed
[1:51:30] himself in with mighty angels somebody
[1:51:33] follow me
[1:51:33] a man in Jesus day he revealed himself
[1:51:36] with mighty angels and in our day but
[1:51:40] he's going to reveal himself with mighty
[1:51:43] angels and when he does it's gonna be
[1:51:46] with flaming fire taking vengeance
[1:51:51] so he's been revealed in many matters
[1:51:54] but this revelation hasn't fully come
[1:51:57] yet because he will take vengeance on
[1:52:02] them that know not God and obey not the
[1:52:04] gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ who
[1:52:07] shall be punished with everlasting
[1:52:08] destruction from the presence of the
[1:52:10] Lord and from the glory of his power
[1:52:13] so this God I want you to see it back
[1:52:16] first one I've got six rather it's a
[1:52:19] righteous thing with God this is God's
[1:52:24] righteousness and work to recompense
[1:52:29] vengeance now let's just go back to the
[1:52:33] early scriptures in Deuteronomy 32 and
[1:52:37] verse 43 let's just see what he says how
[1:52:42] he places God as the adventure rejoice
[1:52:45] all you nations with his people for he
[1:52:49] will avenge the blood of his servants he
[1:52:54] will do the work of kinsmen as a venture
[1:52:59] the blood of his service and will render
[1:53:01] vengeance to his adversary and will be
[1:53:06] merciful that means he will atone unto
[1:53:09] his land and to his people that same
[1:53:12] word is translated as merciful is
[1:53:15] translated as atonement and many other
[1:53:18] passages of the scriptures so it's the
[1:53:19] same thing if he atones his mercy hey
[1:53:24] man and brother Brendan said never say
[1:53:27] mercy is over and so we can say mercy is
[1:53:31] not over never say it then we should
[1:53:33] never say atonement is over all right
[1:53:38] Amen but notice he will rejoice o nation
[1:53:41] with his people for he will avenge the
[1:53:44] blood of his servants and will render
[1:53:46] vengeance to his adversaries and will be
[1:53:49] merciful in other words he will atone
[1:53:52] unto his land and to his people so you
[1:53:56] see he brings atonement and vengeance
[1:54:00] hey man now let's go back to that
[1:54:04] scripture that I love so much in Isaiah
[1:54:07] 59 and he saw that there was no man now
[1:54:20] we already get a clue here in order to
[1:54:23] be an intercessor he's gonna have to be
[1:54:28] a man
[1:54:29] he didn't see that there was no God he
[1:54:33] saw there was no man he saw there was no
[1:54:36] man and wondered that there was no
[1:54:39] intercessor so when he looked and he saw
[1:54:43] the plight of man and he sees there's no
[1:54:47] man that can redeem them there is no man
[1:54:50] that can avenge them there's no man that
[1:54:53] can buy him out of sin slavery
[1:54:55] therefore his arm brought salvation unto
[1:55:00] Him amen and his righteousness
[1:55:05] it's sustained him so therefore that was
[1:55:08] something when out of God that reach all
[1:55:11] the way down to the earth remember his
[1:55:14] arm is not short that he cannot save a
[1:55:18] man a man who has believed our report to
[1:55:22] whom is the arm of the Lord revealed and
[1:55:25] the arm of the Lord is when he comes in
[1:55:28] his power and here in this case he's
[1:55:31] taking off human for us so his arm that
[1:55:35] was there there there was a there was
[1:55:37] something comes out of God to bring
[1:55:40] salvation and his righteousness
[1:55:43] sustained and that word sustained it
[1:55:47] means upheld him in other words it
[1:55:49] caused him to do it it wasn't that he
[1:55:53] had to do it but his righteousness for
[1:55:57] him to be a righteous God it made him
[1:56:01] step out it's my honor its my
[1:56:05] righteousness to do this I gotta do it
[1:56:10] these are my people that's what my
[1:56:14] creation lost and they sold him out
[1:56:19] under a under even Adams foolishness but
[1:56:23] I'm coming down and taking on their
[1:56:24] foolishness taking a death I didn't know
[1:56:27] a man paying the debt that they could
[1:56:33] not pay and he put on righteousness as a
[1:56:39] breastplate so you see his right
[1:56:43] sistahs caused him to do it and here he
[1:56:47] puts on a breastplate a helmet of
[1:56:49] salvation upon his head and he puts a
[1:56:52] garments of vengeance for clothing and
[1:56:54] was clad with zeal as a cloak now wait a
[1:56:58] minute let's go back to let's see
[1:57:00] Abraham just a moment here's a here is
[1:57:03] Abraham and Abraham and has a big church
[1:57:07] I don't know how many there are but even
[1:57:10] after the split they had 300 men so they
[1:57:16] have a pretty big church right you know
[1:57:19] somebody said here the other day said
[1:57:21] you know they asked why don't you go to
[1:57:23] evening lights oh well it's it's too big
[1:57:26] and God a God dumb-dumb God won't be it
[1:57:28] with big people or big churches
[1:57:31] well Abraham's group was 300 plus men
[1:57:35] and some children women and children and
[1:57:38] so you know it's one excuse or another
[1:57:42] right people make up every kind of
[1:57:44] reasons why they can't come to church
[1:57:46] why they can't be a part of the work of
[1:57:48] God I'll tell you stand before they
[1:57:50] judge one day and tell him this standing
[1:57:53] before the judge one day and tell him
[1:57:55] well I'll tell you I didn't like that
[1:57:57] song they sang stand before they're the
[1:58:00] righteous judge and say the reason why I
[1:58:02] didn't support the word of the work of
[1:58:04] God was because a little petty
[1:58:06] differences splitting hairs all of your
[1:58:10] excuses are going to be puny I meant
[1:58:14] when you stand there on that day and you
[1:58:16] find all these reasons why and God asks
[1:58:19] why a man really puts a microscope on
[1:58:24] people's motives and see it really is
[1:58:27] because of a backslidden sinful heart
[1:58:33] don't hang up on me and don't shut off
[1:58:37] the internet because I'm talking to you
[1:58:40] now he put on righteousness as a
[1:58:45] breastplate helmet upon his head look at
[1:58:48] him dressing this is exactly what
[1:58:50] Abraham did Abraham had his brother lot
[1:58:53] that he had coming along his nephew lot
[1:58:57] they treated him like a son before he
[1:59:00] had a son sojourned together shared a
[1:59:04] revelation together sad and sweet
[1:59:07] harmony together hey man but you know
[1:59:11] when it seemed to be a delay on
[1:59:14] receiving the promised son lot got
[1:59:19] impatient and began to stray away and
[1:59:23] drift it down to Sodom well down in
[1:59:27] Sodom of course he wasn't under the
[1:59:30] blessings of Abraham so he gets out from
[1:59:34] under the blessings of Abraham and is
[1:59:36] down in Sodom and there's a there's a
[1:59:39] the kid the other Kings that comes up
[1:59:41] against the king of Sodom takes him all
[1:59:44] away and stems here lot you can imagine
[1:59:49] you imagine that as he's walking down
[1:59:52] his hands behind him stripped down maybe
[1:59:55] nothing even his good clothes taken off
[1:59:57] of him his daughters there along with
[2:00:00] him and his wife and he looks back at
[2:00:03] her I told you we should have stayed
[2:00:04] with Abraham gets home down you know
[2:00:09] their walk in the home being beat hurry
[2:00:13] that dong the way but you see different
[2:00:17] from everybody else Locke had a kinsman
[2:00:25] and that reached the Kinsmen seals that
[2:00:30] you that that Sodom has been taken and
[2:00:34] your net here is in captivity and he
[2:00:37] didn't spare a moment
[2:00:39] it was his righteousness that cinammon a
[2:00:46] trail and he goes running now he he
[2:00:50] Gerdes himself I can see he puts on her
[2:00:53] righteousness as a breastplate a helmet
[2:00:55] of salvation on his head a garment of
[2:00:58] vengeance for clothing and clad with
[2:01:00] zeal as a cloak and here all night long
[2:01:04] he runs he goes through and he's
[2:01:06] attacked and again he slaughters the
[2:01:09] kings and he brings back his nephew that
[2:01:12] restores him and all his goods
[2:01:15] why is he he's a Katzman what was acting
[2:01:21] in Abraham the Redeemer the Redeemer
[2:01:26] that would come so now according to
[2:01:31] their deeds according he will
[2:01:33] accordingly he will reap a fury to his
[2:01:37] adversaries recompense to his enemies to
[2:01:41] the islands he will pay recompense
[2:01:43] listen when we couldn't do it when we
[2:01:48] could not defend ourselves when we were
[2:01:51] in since prison already there was one
[2:01:55] beginning to work and he be said
[2:01:58] unto us a son is born unto us a child is
[2:02:01] given and his name shall be called
[2:02:03] wonderful and his enemy counselor the
[2:02:07] mighty God what the mighty God and that
[2:02:12] word means the warrior God that God
[2:02:16] would become human a son would be born
[2:02:20] and the mighty God would become a
[2:02:23] warrior God and he would get on the
[2:02:25] trail of the adversary they meant to
[2:02:29] first redeem the sons that were lost
[2:02:33] hey man that's the first stages of
[2:02:36] redemption redeeming the earth will come
[2:02:39] later a man but the first stage the
[2:02:42] redemption is reserved is saving the
[2:02:44] soul of man and finally redeeming his
[2:02:47] earth I thought about his body and we're
[2:02:50] right here on the verge of that a man
[2:02:53] now notice in doing this it would be
[2:02:57] glutes out of righteousness if you'll go
[2:03:01] with me to second Kings nine and seven
[2:03:03] you so strike the house away have your
[2:03:06] master that I may avenge now this is God
[2:03:10] saying I want to avenge the blood of my
[2:03:14] servants the prophets and the blood of
[2:03:17] all the servants of the Lord at the hand
[2:03:19] of Jezebel
[2:03:20] so God begin to set things in motion to
[2:03:24] bring it vengeance because I want to
[2:03:27] bring vengeance it's a righteous thing
[2:03:31] with him now even when you go over to
[2:03:37] the souls in the altar even though
[2:03:41] they're more of and it cannot call them
[2:03:43] a more distant kin because they're under
[2:03:45] the Old Covenant and so they're more of
[2:03:49] a distant kin but nevertheless they're
[2:03:52] in the book of life their souls in the
[2:03:56] altar in revelation 6 10 and these souls
[2:04:00] are crying and I want you to know they
[2:04:02] know God's obligation to avenge because
[2:04:09] they now brother Brennan said these are
[2:04:11] not Christians because he said if they
[2:04:13] were Christians they would be saying
[2:04:15] just forgive them Lord that would take
[2:04:17] the same attitude that Jesus did that
[2:04:19] Joseph did come on I did this to save
[2:04:22] life they do this say you know they they
[2:04:25] would they would um they would forgive
[2:04:28] their enemy that would pray that there
[2:04:30] wouldn't be a harm that would be done
[2:04:32] that you know all of this but these
[2:04:33] souls are the altar Jews and they're
[2:04:37] here then they know God's law of
[2:04:40] retribution and they know God is
[2:04:45] righteous
[2:04:47] so they cry with a loud voice saying how
[2:04:50] long O Lord how holy and true dost thou
[2:04:55] not judge and avenge our blood on them
[2:04:58] that dwell on the earth
[2:05:01] so these souls are the answers they know
[2:05:04] God as a kinsman therefore they're
[2:05:08] asking him to avenge a man notice they
[2:05:12] know him as kinsman so they're asking
[2:05:16] for him they intercede on their behalf
[2:05:19] vincent's what about us
[2:05:23] you said why not wait a minute brother
[2:05:26] Tim Christians don't ask God to punish
[2:05:27] people but we can ask God to your
[2:05:30] vengeance of what Satan has done we've
[2:05:34] got a right hey man if they would say
[2:05:38] hello mo God how long when we ought to
[2:05:41] intercede the same way and say hello mo
[2:05:43] Lord how long how long O Lord how long
[2:05:47] were you not avenge the blood of your
[2:05:49] servants
[2:05:50] how long will god how long will the sick
[2:05:53] have to lay and not be healed when we
[2:05:56] got a kinsman redeemer of kinsmen Abids
[2:05:59] ER Avenger I just said this enemy you
[2:06:05] promised by your stripes I am healed
[2:06:08] you promised deliverance hallelujah
[2:06:12] oh brother I'll tell your friends I want
[2:06:15] you just to read what Jesus told us to
[2:06:17] do he gave us the parable of the unjust
[2:06:20] judge didn't he and he talked about the
[2:06:24] winner coming to him over and over and
[2:06:27] saying it feeds me of mine animus
[2:06:29] restore to me what I lost
[2:06:32] I've been afflicted and tormented and
[2:06:34] everything been taken from me buddies
[2:06:37] but Jesus would give this example of
[2:06:40] somebody who would pray and not give up
[2:06:43] and these souls on the altar were
[2:06:46] praying and not give up till they got a
[2:06:48] word and that word was said rest a
[2:06:51] little season and then give you white
[2:06:54] robes I'm gonna give you some comfort
[2:06:55] but rest a little season because I've
[2:06:58] got
[2:06:58] some things that happen but I will
[2:07:01] perform my work kinsmen I will punish
[2:07:06] them that have brought this upon you
[2:07:08] listen listen because because it reduce
[2:07:12] don't mean God wasn't going to Vince
[2:07:14] them God's gonna make the Jews but let
[2:07:21] me read this scripture and shall not God

[2:07:49] words of Jesus a man if we couldn't
[2:07:51] ought to be a red-letter I tell you that
[2:07:54] he will avenge them speedily hey man but
[2:08:00] nevertheless when the Son of man cometh
[2:08:02] sally find faith on the earth will he
[2:08:04] find somebody that knows me as kinsman
[2:08:08] that knows my power of redemption will

[2:11:13] that's why you saw the other night right
[2:11:16] here at this altar when a devil got a
[2:11:18] hold of one of our young girls there and
[2:11:20] he had to grow in the name of Jesus
[2:11:24] Christ even though he was growling and
[2:11:27] saying I won't come out I'll tell you
[2:11:29] had to bow to the name of Jesus Christ

[2:11:36] kinsman wasn't me at work that was our
[2:11:40] kinsman at work one day he'll lay hold
[2:11:44] of death that works in our body and
[2:11:46] he'll strip it from its power deaths
[2:11:49] will have no power and a grave will have
[2:11:51] no victory redemption of our bodies let
[2:11:56] me show you a scripture here Romans 8:23
[2:12:01] and not only they the Bible said they're
[2:12:04] all groaning all the earth is groaning
[2:12:06] so not only they are groaning but
[2:12:09] ourselves also that it received the
[2:12:13] firstfruits of the Spirit we ourselves
[2:12:15] groan within ourselves you know that
[2:12:18] Ruth would get the firstfruits he would
[2:12:23] give her six measures of barley he would
[2:12:27] give her things to sustain her somebody
[2:12:30] with me now givers who give her
[2:12:32] something that would stain her and tell
[2:12:34] her to rest and God has given us not
[2:12:38] just handfuls on purpose but he's now
[2:12:41] given us now he's given us what needs to
[2:12:44] sustain us all the way until we rewarded
[2:12:48] all I'm already rewarded brother dear my
[2:12:51] I've got Boaz know you have the promise
[2:12:56] you have the promise we have Boaz by the
[2:13:02] of course by the the the whole
[2:13:04] spirit and we have that spiritually but
[2:13:06] but really Church we're still looking
[2:13:08] for him to come back you know we got all
[2:13:13] the spiritualizing going on that wants
[2:13:15] to take place some of the reality and
[2:13:17] they and they and the Corporal coming
[2:13:19] and the physical aspects of it there's
[2:13:22] more to it than just a pie in the sky or
[2:13:25] some imagination and where you just
[2:13:29] imagine that you are or revelation that
[2:13:32] my faith that you you're taking as well
[2:13:34] I've got a revelation well that's good
[2:13:36] but I want the substance I wanted to
[2:13:42] become material
[2:13:43] where's no more revelation it's reality
[2:13:48] Andrews was resting and that's what we
[2:13:52] have done we are here in the time
[2:13:54] arrests we have the first fruits of the
[2:13:57] spirit which is the Holy Ghost but we
[2:14:01] who have that we're still groaning a man
[2:14:05] I mean even Ruth sit him back there you
[2:14:08] know can he do it can he do it you don't
[2:14:12] rest my daughter rest all of the Old
[2:14:15] Testament says rest he'll come he came
[2:14:18] to us we waited for him for thousands
[2:14:21] years but he came to us this rest hold
[2:14:25] on to the promise don't give up though
[2:14:27] it Terri Hong don't give up stay right
[2:14:30] there

[2:14:41] glean they man in this field but now
[2:14:44] here I'm gonna give you provisions I'll
[2:14:46] give you the downpayment that will
[2:14:50] sustain you until you're rewarded and so
[2:14:55] we still groan within ourselves we're
[2:14:59] still groaning we look at a precious
[2:15:02] brother like our brother like a brother
[2:15:06] they're laying in the hospital and here
[2:15:10] he's what a precious man laying there
[2:15:13] dying doctor says no hope
[2:15:18] he's groaning his body's groaning its
[2:15:21] travailing we travail Lord when will it
[2:15:24] be this is all over
[2:15:27] when will it be it's a difficult time
[2:15:37] that we're in it's a time when many
[2:15:44] Eagle eyes are getting filmed over and I
[2:15:46] said well was this the one or shall we
[2:15:48] look for another it's a time were men
[2:15:52] that with their unbelief has thrown
[2:15:55] every kind of microscope on the message
[2:15:57] to find every flaw they can shouted in
[2:16:02] your face to take away your hope to
[2:16:06] destroy your faith it's a time even
[2:16:11] though that even when there are those
[2:16:13] who are still trying to hold on I've
[2:16:16] become more and more faithless you know
[2:16:22] I just see in pictures of grandparents
[2:16:27] with their you know and and all of them
[2:16:31] all the things you know with putting
[2:16:33] their grandchildren on Santa's knees and
[2:16:38] I think what blasphemy you know how
[2:16:44] could we bless that how could we like
[2:16:46] that
[2:16:46] how could we think that's cute we
[2:16:50] received a message
[2:16:52] but people are losing their way yeah I
[2:16:57] you know I understand you know I
[2:17:00] understand that that you know in the way
[2:17:03] that brother Branham celebrated
[2:17:05] Christmas there would be many people
[2:17:07] that would judge him as pagan but he
[2:17:09] wasn't pagan he knew that there was a
[2:17:12] true story of Christmas that that was
[2:17:16] his he said a truth to Christmas there
[2:17:18] has to be a light shine but long-term do
[2:17:21] not become like the world don't you mix
[2:17:25] this with Santa Claus don't you mix this
[2:17:28] with some other pagan tree like this
[2:17:31] keep that holy hey man do you hear what
[2:17:37] I'm saying but you know again it's the
[2:17:40] delay is where people are losing faith
[2:17:43] is for people can hardly get a grasp for
[2:17:47] divine healing and unbelief is coming
[2:17:50] and the more the more we know about
[2:17:52] science and you know they they show us
[2:17:55] they show us all of the different things
[2:17:58] you know and and if that we're up
[2:18:01] against and and and you have to become
[2:18:07] as brother Greg priests like a little
[2:18:09] child a little child don't understand
[2:18:14] what the doctor says don't understand
[2:18:18] all the scientific stuff and it means
[2:18:20] nothing to them man and they with hope
[2:18:23] they believe in hope and they pray when
[2:18:26] the prayers seem like this useless you
[2:18:30] know it would take a listen it really
[2:18:32] really would take a childlike faith to
[2:18:34] stand before mighty mountain and say
[2:18:36] think that words can make it move but
[2:18:39] Jesus told us to do this is that right -
[2:18:43] forget your human thinking and become so
[2:18:47] simple that you can really believe can
[2:18:52] you stay with me a little while longer
[2:18:53] than this Lorna Amanda listen here how
[2:18:57] can we say redemption is over when we're
[2:19:00] in the very throes of Redemption the
[2:19:05] Bible said that we've grown within
[2:19:07] ourselves waiting for the option that is
[2:19:08] the what what redemption of that bodies
[2:19:17] while redemption is over well is your
[2:19:20] body changed did redemption ain't over
[2:19:25] as long as I'm here in this tabernacle
[2:19:28] of humanity redemption is not over
[2:19:33] as long as I'm still groaning Redemption
[2:19:37] is not over
[2:19:38] he's still my hero he's still my Savior
[2:19:41] he's still my kinsman he's still my
[2:19:43] bloody sacrifice he's still my atonement
[2:19:46] he is my mercy so how did we save
[2:19:52] redemption is over when our bodies are
[2:19:56] still not yet redeemed us
[2:20:00] so what my soul is redeemed we'll don't
[2:20:03] get ahead of yourself there's a redeemer
[2:20:07] for for the Gentiles there's an
[2:20:10] intercessor until we're changed that's
[2:20:16] all the way to the rapture then are you
[2:20:18] talking about a face of the rapture I'm
[2:20:20] talking about the fullest unrest so no
[2:20:24] notice God has not forgot
[2:20:29] God has not forgotten now what the enemy
[2:20:32] has done he'd not forgot what the
[2:20:35] enemy's done to you God's got a memory
[2:20:39] bigger than an elephant he don't ever
[2:20:42] forget unless he puts it in his bud then
[2:20:47] he forgets there's only one thing that
[2:20:50] can make him forget and that's what he
[2:20:51] atones for the rest of it he keeps an
[2:20:55] account hey man I mean even Cornelius do
[2:21:01] you know his is giving his giving and in
[2:21:04] the end giving up arms came up before
[2:21:07] God and God said I remember his arms
[2:21:11] therefore I'm sending him to you
[2:21:13] I'm sending Peter to you - to him now
[2:21:16] notice but notice now God doesn't forget
[2:21:19] like that but in Revelation 19 - he says
[2:21:23] for true and righteous I want you to see
[2:21:25] how righteousness goes with his kinsmen
[2:21:30] work and mat run from true and righteous
[2:21:34] are his judgments as he is judge the
[2:21:36] great which Kurt did corrupt the
[2:21:38] earth with her fornication and
[2:21:41] has avenged the blood of his servants at
[2:21:45] her hand so this is him he has evinced
[2:21:49] this is a tribulation he will avenge why
[2:21:52] out of righteousness
[2:21:55] now even look in the tribulation it's
[2:21:59] the blood of the Lamb that is saved a
[2:22:01] multitude without number I'm trying to
[2:22:04] show you something
[2:22:05] it's the lamb in the tribulation it is
[2:22:10] the lamb that will be seen with the
[2:22:12] multitude without number the church
[2:22:14] after the bride is gone
[2:22:17] it is the lamb that will be seen with
[2:22:20] the 144,000 so you see he doesn't cease
[2:22:25] to be lamb just because he breaks the
[2:22:29] revelation of the seals he's still doing
[2:22:36] the work of kinsman lamb so now notice
[2:22:41] here in revelation 7:9 you know
[2:22:45] sometimes we think well only the bride
[2:22:47] can be saved that's nonsense he's right
[2:22:49] now saving the souls of the church who
[2:22:52] are not the bride
[2:22:53] you think why he'd even among them oh
[2:22:55] yes he is
[2:22:56] I'll show you in the tribulation it's
[2:22:59] shown that he's with them and he didn't
[2:23:02] just show up because they actually wash
[2:23:05] their robes in his blood
[2:23:09] hey man he's been with him all the time
[2:23:12] Oh monsters he's not just there for the
[2:23:19] bride he's there for every name that's
[2:23:24] in the book of life he was there for the
[2:23:27] souls under the altar the Jews that was
[2:23:30] under killed in Eichmann and Hitler he
[2:23:33] was there oh do you know Joseph would
[2:23:36] say to the attention Benjamin and the
[2:23:39] whole group and then and he would say
[2:23:41] well you know he was done the same life
[2:23:43] but what they didn't realize it had been
[2:23:46] here
[2:23:47] oh the time it meant him giving him the
[2:23:52] provision give him their money back
[2:23:55] feeding them in the time of favor in a
[2:23:57] bit Joseph all this time and all the
[2:24:01] time the lamb has been watching over
[2:24:03] Israel he was there when I meant in them
[2:24:08] did that he was there with all them
[2:24:10] spirits come again he will avenge the
[2:24:16] devil won't get by with a thing all of
[2:24:21] his all of his adversary the Eichmann
[2:24:24] the whole bunch of will be in the lake
[2:24:25] of fire are you with me
[2:24:28] man they'll face the wrath of the Lamb
[2:24:30] and his judgment they will not get by
[2:24:34] with anything here's somebody out there
[2:24:43] denomination you hear them believe in
[2:24:46] God and getting healed and you say well
[2:24:48] how how in the world did they get healed
[2:24:50] the lamb didn't the devil don't heal the
[2:24:55] lamb did it hey man they believed on the
[2:24:59] Lord and her see forgiveness is him how
[2:25:01] did they do that the lamb didn't listen
[2:25:11] we want to get down here and say mercy
[2:25:13] is over Mercy's atonement atonement is
[2:25:16] not over atonement is atoning for the
[2:25:19] foolish virgin out here atoning for the
[2:25:22] wise virgins atoning for the 144,000
[2:25:26] atoning for the father for the Jews we
[2:25:29] read it to you in the Bible this is this
[2:25:31] is him listen listen revelation 7:9 and
[2:25:35] I this I beheld and lo a great multitude
[2:25:37] which no man could number of all nations
[2:25:39] and Kindred's and people and tongues
[2:25:41] stood before the throne and before the
[2:25:44] lamb clothed with white robes and palms
[2:25:47] in their hands and what they stood
[2:25:50] before who the lamb so the lamb even
[2:25:57] comes and is among them
[2:26:00] those tribulation Saints he cares even
[2:26:05] about them
[2:26:08] look you're God's bigger what you think
[2:26:11] if he cares about the sparrow that falls
[2:26:13] well then why would he care about
[2:26:15] anybody they called on his name and just
[2:26:18] because they got deceived by false
[2:26:20] prophets doesn't mean that they're lost
[2:26:23] forever the gentleman said blood for
[2:26:27] that and they stood before the throne
[2:26:35] before the lamb clothed with white robes
[2:26:37] and palms in her head and they cried
[2:26:39] with a loud voice saying salvation to
[2:26:42] our God which sitteth upon the throne
[2:26:43] and unto the lamb verse 14 and I said to
[2:26:49] him cause a this multitude John didn't
[2:26:51] know him they wasn't his people who are
[2:26:53] they it was a bunch of Gentiles and
[2:26:55] guess what guess where they come out of
[2:26:58] now they were in the tribulation but
[2:27:02] they was raised from the dead they
[2:27:07] wasn't resurrected from the dead and
[2:27:12] they were in the tribulation that means
[2:27:15] they are alive now and how many a
[2:27:22] multitude that no man can number I'm
[2:27:27] innumerable number more than you can
[2:27:31] guess or as to me you say well only the
[2:27:37] bride's gonna make it yeah in the
[2:27:38] rapture but friends there's going to be
[2:27:40] many more saved and even out of the
[2:27:45] worst Dark Age that there ever was
[2:27:47] Laodicea where they got blinded by false
[2:27:51] prophets that just as the Jews were
[2:27:54] blinded for our sakes
[2:27:56] now Gentiles are being blinded for their
[2:27:58] sakes as the gospel swings back and
[2:28:01] turns back
[2:28:03] [Music]
[2:28:04] and God has a way of provision shall I
[2:28:09] say who does it the lamb did this so
[2:28:13] ain't no more lamb he is lamb lookie
[2:28:15] here the Bible said the lamb which is in
[2:28:19] the midst of the throne shall feed them
[2:28:20] and shall lead them unto living
[2:28:23] fountains of water that's eternal life
[2:28:25] you see in God shall wipe away all tears
[2:28:28] from their eyes this is a great Redeemer
[2:28:38] this is a God who has more mercy than
[2:28:41] you can imagine
[2:28:42] this is a God who could say the cane
[2:28:45] cane but if you do right don't you know
[2:28:48] you'll be accepted yeah you didn't offer
[2:28:52] blood but if you come the way of Abel
[2:28:56] come on if you just come the way of Abel
[2:28:59] you know you're maybe you're always
[2:29:01] serpent seed that maybe you're always
[2:29:03] that but don't you know you'll be
[2:29:05] accepted this God that we paint as being
[2:29:14] the savior of only the exclusive view
[2:29:17] it's a God who has a bigger heart than
[2:29:20] what you could ever imagine that could
[2:29:25] even say to Cain Cain don't you know if
[2:29:28] you do right if you cut the way of the
[2:29:30] blood you'll be accepted even though you
[2:29:34] don't have a seed in you don't you know
[2:29:37] don't redemptions on you you don't have
[2:29:44] to murder your brother but if you don't
[2:29:46] sin lies at the door
[2:29:47] cops just overtake you you know what
[2:29:55] brother Tim that's extreme listen this
[2:29:57] God is doing some extreme things so
[2:30:01] we're in another dispensation that's
[2:30:03] right there's a bride and there's a
[2:30:05] church and the church is saved as well
[2:30:07] as the bride the bride just goes in the
[2:30:09] rapture and escapes emulation but they
[2:30:11] are saved before the tribulation
[2:30:14] ah look at all these sincere people out
[2:30:17] there and they're all lost don't you
[2:30:19] discount him god no dude without number
[2:30:31] and they cry with a loud voice got them
[2:30:36] even shouting salvation to our God which
[2:30:40] sitteth upon the throne to the Lamb
[2:30:42] verse 14 he won't know who are these
[2:30:45] either I don't recognize him he said sir
[2:30:47] thou knowest and he said these are they
[2:30:50] which came out of Great Tribulation and
[2:30:52] have washed their robes and made them
[2:30:54] white in the blood of the Lamb
[2:30:55] brother Branham is clear about this
[2:30:57] because he said when the bride leaves
[2:30:59] there's not another Gentile saying the
[2:31:02] gospel turns to the Jews but as long
[2:31:05] listen as long as there's atonement for
[2:31:08] us for one member in the bride to be
[2:31:11] washed in the blood and to be recognized
[2:31:13] in the book there is a chance for the
[2:31:16] foolish virgin don't give up on your
[2:31:21] loved ones don't discount them all now I
[2:31:29] mean you know argue with the Prophet he
[2:31:32] said they are saved people he said who
[2:31:35] some way because of your fault or mine
[2:31:38] didn't hear the message or was in some
[2:31:41] way blinded by these false prophets and
[2:31:43] there's a binding going on and they
[2:31:46] would have perhaps believed but because
[2:31:50] of the blinding is going on has happened
[2:31:51] with Israel is horribly the Paul said if
[2:31:54] they would have known it they would not
[2:31:56] have crucified the Lord of glory and if
[2:31:58] they would have known this was a message
[2:31:59] that would rapture them that they would
[2:32:01] get in the ark but they were blinded
[2:32:10] therefore there before the throne of God
[2:32:12] and serve Him day and night in his
[2:32:15] temple
[2:32:16] look here they're even allowed in the
[2:32:19] temple and him that sat on the throne
[2:32:23] said well among them and they shall
[2:32:26] hunger no more neither thirst
[2:32:28] neither South Sun light on them nor even
[2:32:31] any heat and the lamb which is in the
[2:32:35] midst of the throne shall feed them and
[2:32:37] shall lead them into fountains of living
[2:32:41] waters you see you already received the
[2:32:44] fountain of living waters that's why
[2:32:45] you're going in the rapture because he
[2:32:48] that truly believeth on me as the
[2:32:50] scripture has said through repentance
[2:32:52] baptism in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:32:54] receiving the Holy Ghost and ments hell
[2:32:56] out of your innermost being flow a river
[2:32:58] of living water but these don't have the
[2:33:00] Living Waters so after after they they
[2:33:03] come through the tribulation they are
[2:33:06] led into the Living Waters notice and
[2:33:11] God shall wipe away their tears now I
[2:33:16] want you to look at the adventure at
[2:33:18] work I may go a little long this morning
[2:33:21] you just have to bear with me it'll be
[2:33:26] nothing unusual
[2:33:29] so revelation 12 and 7 because here it
[2:33:34] is the overthrowing of Satan and
[2:33:37] remember this is a process it's not a
[2:33:42] moment twinkling I bent there's been a
[2:33:45] war that has been going on with Satan to
[2:33:49] overthrow him and Michael and his angels
[2:33:53] fought against the Dragon and the dragon
[2:33:55] fought and his angels I love this and
[2:33:58] prevailed not he don't win neither was
[2:34:02] their place found any more in heaven and
[2:34:04] the Great Dragon was cast out that old
[2:34:08] serpent called the devil and Satan which
[2:34:10] deceiveth the whole world and he cast
[2:34:12] him out into their earth and his angels
[2:34:14] were cast out with him now so you can
[2:34:19] see here's a great battle between
[2:34:23] between the kinsmen as he throws Satan
[2:34:28] out of the heavenly places because he is
[2:34:34] making ready for the bride to ascend as
[2:34:38] is cast down because the place it is in
[2:34:43] as principal power the air which is
[2:34:46] which years of Adams position as he
[2:34:50] controlled the atmosphere of the earth
[2:34:52] but he is about to be cast down as a
[2:34:55] bride as sins to take that place once
[2:34:59] more are you with me now now in the
[2:35:02] fourth seal brother branham especially
[2:35:05] tells you what will happen he says and
[2:35:08] notice he shall be given a heart of the
[2:35:11] beast he's talking about the Antichrist
[2:35:13] the false prophet it would be would be
[2:35:17] given a heart of a beast at that time
[2:35:19] and Satan will incarnate himself now
[2:35:24] notice we've already had a man who the
[2:35:27] fullness of God dwelt in that was Jesus
[2:35:30] Christ but we're about we're about to
[2:35:33] give the world is about to give way to
[2:35:36] the coming of the Antichrist where Satan
[2:35:40] will take over a man in whom will be the
[2:35:43] very heart of a beast where Satan will
[2:35:46] incarnate himself in a false prophet and
[2:35:51] I which we believe to be the Pope amen
[2:35:54] because when the bride goes up notice
[2:35:59] when the bride goes up when she is she's
[2:36:03] raptured resurrection music brother Jim
[2:36:06] the bride's already grown up she's
[2:36:08] already sitting with him listen the
[2:36:10] bride isn't there yet she hasn't raised
[2:36:12] from the dead there's still a large
[2:36:14] portion of the bride the church that is
[2:36:17] still in the grave when the church goes
[2:36:20] up Satan is cast down or out see then
[2:36:27] it's done then all of his accusin is
[2:36:30] done a man he can no longer accuse us
[2:36:35] once we get our body chains but as long
[2:36:38] as we're in this rest
[2:36:40] Satan has a right to accuse us
[2:36:46] what's now the church goes up Satan is
[2:36:50] cast out notice is done all his accusing
[2:36:55] is done now it's long yes look as long
[2:36:58] as intercessors still on the throne
[2:37:00] Satan can stand there and accused so
[2:37:03] here it works the same way as long as
[2:37:04] Satan can accuse the intercessor still
[2:37:07] on the throne as long as intercessors on
[2:37:10] the throne Satan can stand there and
[2:37:12] accuse same way works the same way as
[2:37:14] long as Satan can stand there and accuse
[2:37:16] we need an intercessor on the throne he
[2:37:24] is upon it because he's the attorney on
[2:37:26] the other side he's the opponent of
[2:37:30] Christ in Christ he's standing there the
[2:37:32] opponent is standing there saying but
[2:37:35] wait Adam fell Adam done this I
[2:37:37] conquered him I got his wife to believe
[2:37:40] a lie and use said she would be damned
[2:37:42] bite I haven't but there here is the
[2:37:45] mediator standing there notice this is
[2:37:48] the fourth seal and here's a mediator
[2:37:51] standing there a man the kinsman
[2:37:53] redeemer and a man send there with that
[2:37:55] blood that can take the violence sinners
[2:37:57] heart and change it the mediator is on
[2:38:01] the throne see yes sir
[2:38:04] and Satan said but they're guilty and he
[2:38:07] said but they're not here's the battle
[2:38:14] Satan says you're you're guilty he says
[2:38:18] you're not
[2:38:19] he said you're justified you never did
[2:38:23] it in the first place but seasons still
[2:38:26] stand there and accuses and says but
[2:38:29] you're not and try to make you doubt
[2:38:31] what he did for you but he said but
[2:38:34] you're the pure sinless virgin bride of
[2:38:37] Jesus Christ you have never did it in
[2:38:40] the first place
[2:38:44] that Clorox was invented or manufactured
[2:38:49] to take stain take the color now to sink
[2:38:52] or any other stain they got it it'll
[2:38:55] break them too you'll never find it
[2:38:56] again

[2:38:58] Casas goes all the way back to cosmic
[2:39:01] light past molecules and everything else
[2:39:04] till it turns back to the original where
[2:39:06] it come from it's a creation how the
[2:39:08] creation had to come from a creator but
[2:39:10] all the chemicals that was manufactured
[2:39:13] and put together they broke up there
[2:39:15] broke up and that's just all there is to
[2:39:18] it there's no more of it even the very
[2:39:21] the very water substant it is blends
[2:39:23] with the clocks which is Isis a man
[2:39:26] glory to God it's all clean that's what
[2:39:32] the blood of Jesus Christ does to the
[2:39:35] true child of God when he confesses that
[2:39:39] sin and stands there justified it is
[2:39:42] mercy goodness even it's so great till

[2:41:38] still here and now that's why the earth
[2:41:41] is so filthy that's why the scum and
[2:41:43] ridiculous things that goes on bloodshed
[2:41:46] war politics in adultery all kinds of

[2:42:34] who you're gonna believe Satan knows is
[2:42:39] through what the blood did for you but
[2:42:42] you but do you know what the blood did

[2:43:02] the unbelievers want to say what all the
[2:43:04] theologian around the message say
[2:43:06] but this prophet said Jesus is there to
[2:43:09] intercede for us and Wow the accuser
[2:43:13] keeps pointing the finger they did this
[2:43:16] they did this they did this the blood
[2:43:19] still love us he came to redeem that

[2:46:04] [Applause]
[2:46:13] how can I overcome brother brendensen
[2:46:16] overcome is to recognize the devil in
[2:46:20] every one of his tricks hey man look
[2:46:23] lots of people say there is no devil now
[2:46:26] you know they want to come well he's not
[2:46:28] more their toner sees no more the
[2:46:30] accuser listen they want to say that
[2:46:32] he's just a thought don't you believe
[2:46:35] that there is a real devil he's just as
[2:46:38] real as you are
[2:46:39] or anybody a real devil and you must
[2:46:43] recognize him as real you must know he's
[2:46:48] a devil then the same time that you
[2:46:51] recognize him and know he's a devil he's
[2:46:53] against you then to overcome you must
[2:46:55] recognize that God in you is greater and
[2:47:00] my here that he is that the one that's
[2:47:03] in you has already overcome him and by
[2:47:06] his grace that's favor you are more than
[2:47:09] a match for him
[2:47:11] that's real overcome and when you
[2:47:13] recognize no let's just look at this
[2:47:21] rapture how are we going to go in this
[2:47:24] right this is a rapture by blood it's
[2:47:29] not a rapture without blood look in
[2:47:31] Revelation 12:10 and I heard a loud
[2:47:34] voice members Satan's cast out when he's
[2:47:37] cast down the bride goes up brother
[2:47:39] branham teaches this in the seals he
[2:47:40] said when Satan is cast down bride goes
[2:47:42] he says now so so we can we can safely
[2:47:46] say that Satan is cast out in Revelation
[2:47:48] 12 the bride goes up in Revelation 12
[2:47:50] it's a scene it's the scene that's a
[2:47:54] process of time it starts back right in
[2:47:57] Revelation 12 1 2 this woman were that
[2:48:00] he were the the red dragon stood before
[2:48:03] the woman that was going to give birth
[2:48:05] to the Christ child and he was raptured
[2:48:07] up into heaven and then then then there
[2:48:10] was a war in heaven and this war now has
[2:48:13] been going on for heavenly places then
[2:48:17] we finally come to the rapture time and
[2:48:21] when Satan now
[2:48:23] the picture brother branham tells us
[2:48:25] gives us a key to this when Satan is
[2:48:27] cast down the bride goes up so we seem
[2:48:31] cast down here in Revelation 12 and just
[2:48:34] read it now in verse 10 you're going to
[2:48:36] see where the bride is now in heaven
[2:48:39] because then I heard a loud voice saying
[2:48:41] where and heaven now I'm just going to
[2:48:46] go ahead and tell you these are the
[2:48:47] raptured Saints now and here's what they
[2:48:54] say now is come salvation remember this
[2:48:59] no we think salvation came 2000 years
[2:49:02] ago at Calvary no
[2:49:03] now comes total deliverance now here
[2:49:06] comes the fullness that was the
[2:49:09] initiation now here comes the whole
[2:49:11] product a man and what and strength and
[2:49:16] the Kingdom of our God and the power of
[2:49:20] his Christ here's where the full power
[2:49:23] is shown by rapture the church amen for
[2:49:28] here's the reason why is power shown the
[2:49:31] accuser of our brethren is cast down
[2:49:34] which accused them before our God day
[2:49:37] and night are you with me now and they
[2:49:42] overcame him is there are they here this
[2:49:49] moment and they overcame him Amen how by
[2:49:57] the blood of the Lamb
[2:50:01] so the labs bad raptures our church
[2:50:05] without the lambs blood you're not going
[2:50:09] in the church the labs back gives you
[2:50:11] the power to overcome hallelujah and
[2:50:16] they overcame him by the blood the lamb
[2:50:18] by the word of their testimony
[2:50:20] confessing that the word was true and
[2:50:22] they loved not their lives unto the
[2:50:24] death a man now all will be deceived
[2:50:29] except those whose are in the Lamb's
[2:50:31] Book of Life that's revelations 13 and 8
[2:50:34] so all that dwell on the earth will be
[2:50:37] whose names are not written in the book
[2:50:38] of life of the lamb slain so you've got
[2:50:42] to belong to the lamb amen now after the
[2:50:47] bride is raptured Christ is not yet king
[2:50:50] of the earth but he's still the lamb and
[2:50:52] redemption is still ongoing let me give
[2:50:55] guarantee he does not cease being a lamb
[2:50:59] when the ride is raptured he continues
[2:51:03] his Redemption work even in the
[2:51:06] tribulation so now we're going to see
[2:51:09] him here um when it before that he
[2:51:13] becomes king of the earth and he's still
[2:51:15] claiming his subjects that now he goes
[2:51:18] to claim all that are redeemed and
[2:51:21] there's a hundred and forty four
[2:51:23] thousand which is the remnant leftover
[2:51:26] of the Old Testament Saints and it can I
[2:51:31] say they are they they are Jews and is
[2:51:34] why I say that and the lamb stood on
[2:51:37] Mount Zion and with him a hundred and
[2:51:41] forty-four thousand so even in the
[2:51:44] Tribulation Period this is revelation
[2:51:47] 14:1 to have that alright good so the
[2:51:51] lamb stood on Mount Zion with him a
[2:51:53] hundred forty-four thousand having his
[2:51:55] father's name written in their foreheads
[2:51:58] and I heard Allah from heaven as the
[2:52:01] voice of many waters of voice of a great
[2:52:04] Thunder and I heard the voice of harpers
[2:52:06] harping with their harps and his sung as
[2:52:08] it were a new song before the throne and
[2:52:10] before the four beasts and the
[2:52:12] and no man could learn that song but the
[2:52:15] hundred forty-four thousand and the
[2:52:16] which were redeemed what about
[2:52:20] Redemption was over these were redeemed
[2:52:24] from the earth by the lamb redemption
[2:52:28] was only over for the Gentiles he missed
[2:52:30] going in the rapture and then the
[2:52:36] remnant was towed into tribulation
[2:52:38] haven't had washed their robes in the
[2:52:40] blood of the Lamb and there's not
[2:52:41] another Gentile saved but he's still
[2:52:43] save it and he's still sealing and he's
[2:52:45] still given the Holy Ghost he's still
[2:52:48] Reed diamond after redemption is over
[2:52:52] for the Gentiles he's still the Lamb so
[2:52:57] they were redeemed from the earth all
[2:53:00] right these these are they which are not
[2:53:04] defiled by the women for they were
[2:53:07] virgins these are they which follow the
[2:53:10] lamb wherever he goeth these were
[2:53:13] redeemed what from among men being
[2:53:16] firstfruits unto God and to the lamb and
[2:53:22] in their mouth was fine no guile means
[2:53:25] they were not dishonest
[2:53:26] they were truthful my names were sincere
[2:53:30] believers somebody help me preach and I
[2:53:33] want you to get this next word right
[2:53:36] here because here's what I want to throw
[2:53:39] it you know just really throw some
[2:53:41] weight into it but and they are read it
[2:53:47] with me without fault before the throne
[2:53:52] of God
[2:53:57] look what just look what it did for them
[2:54:04] oh and it's even more for you you're his
[2:54:07] bride and if he didn't if the blood did
[2:54:10] this for them and redeemed them and
[2:54:12] their first fruits to God your first
[2:54:14] fruit unto God and whatever the lamb
[2:54:16] goes you go with it hallelujah and here
[2:54:20] though there's no guile in their mouth
[2:54:22] and they are without fault before the
[2:54:29] throne of God Oh hallelujah
[2:54:35] look what the blood has done if it's
[2:54:39] true of them is true the bride now let
[2:54:43] me give you a scripture for you let's go
[2:54:46] to Jude 1:24 now unto him that is able
[2:54:50] to keep you from falling and to present
[2:54:54] you what faultless before the presence
[2:54:58] of his glory in that the throne with
[2:55:01] exceeding joy to the only wise God our
[2:55:06] Savior
[2:55:06] I'll am I Redeemer be glory and Majesty
[2:55:10] Dominion and power both now and ever
[2:55:14] how many can say Amen proceed you
[2:55:20] faultless Sabet the power this blood
[2:55:27] gives you victory over defeat the power
[2:55:32] this blood puts a man on speaking terms
[2:55:35] again the power of this blood gives
[2:55:38] weight to the voice of a man who can say
[2:55:40] to this mountain it's under the power
[2:55:43] this blood that Moses was able to create
[2:55:45] a man brother Branham tells us and God
[2:55:49] hiding himself in simplicity if the
[2:55:51] blood of bulls and goats could give
[2:55:53] power to Moses to go out there by the
[2:55:57] commission of God and stretch forth that
[2:55:59] rod what did it the the blood of bulls
[2:56:02] and goats could give our power
[2:56:05] to Moses now we have no blood we have no
[2:56:09] power hey man it was only under that
[2:56:14] blood that Moses had power brother
[2:56:16] Brandon would talk about it and he said
[2:56:18] he said God would put a word in Moses
[2:56:20] mind God thought it put in Moses mind he
[2:56:23] spoke it it become a word Moses turn
[2:56:25] around went back maybe not a fly in the
[2:56:27] country an hour from there there was one
[2:56:29] old green fly begin to buzz around half
[2:56:31] an hour is 10 pounds per square yard
[2:56:33] what was it it was a creative word god
[2:56:36] that was spoke by the lips of a mortal
[2:56:38] man
[2:56:39] notice what it was under the blood of
[2:56:41] bulls and goats
[2:56:42] Oh God uses men God could have used the
[2:56:50] Sun to preach the gospel God could have
[2:56:52] used the wind to preach the gospel but
[2:56:54] God chose men to preach the gospel now
[2:56:57] brother Branham poses a question what's
[2:56:59] the matter with the church today my
[2:57:04] opinion we're not coming to that
[2:57:05] sincerity to the right thing for that
[2:57:07] you've got to do that under the blood of
[2:57:10] bulls and goats that only covered sin
[2:57:12] and made a perpetuation for the center
[2:57:14] but sin was there only covered over what
[2:57:17] can he do to the blood of his son that
[2:57:19] omits in God is not manufactured but he
[2:57:23] created a blood that takes away all sin
[2:57:27] then he said in the fourth seal I
[2:57:30] believe that blood that sin will be
[2:57:32] broke up when is confessed of on the
[2:57:34] basis of the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:57:36] listen the whole seals brother Branham
[2:57:39] is talking about what the black has done
[2:57:41] for you where it is positioned you who
[2:57:45] you are in Christ hey man and he said
[2:57:49] that's where the blood of Christ does
[2:57:51] i'm started trying to get to time now
[2:57:55] the creative power of God is in him then
[2:57:58] at least when God can command it to be
[2:57:59] done it'll be done going on down you
[2:58:02] stand in the presence as a redeemed son
[2:58:04] he said I think to now that I see the
[2:58:06] church is far beyond his standard of
[2:58:08] living I think too many times we're
[2:58:11] probing instead of really coming out and
[2:58:13] facing the issue
[2:58:14] I wonder if this morning this group of
[2:58:16] people could face the issue
[2:58:19] a man of who what the blood is done for
[2:58:22] you of who you are in Christ amen that
[2:58:26] you spend thoughtless before the throne
[2:58:27] a man that you are not standing there is
[2:58:30] and as a weekend of vigil but as a son
[2:58:33] of God
[2:58:35] who know our people who knows their God
[2:58:39] who can't do exploits Oh brother branham
[2:58:43] said there's something wrong somewhere
[2:58:44] in the churches he comes down to the
[2:58:47] indictment he tells us the only place
[2:58:49] that God will meet man is under the shed
[2:58:51] blood and when you turned the blood down
[2:58:53] your meeting place with God it has been
[2:58:55] taken away and a man God made his first
[2:58:58] decision in the garden reading a man but
[2:59:00] only worship under the shed blood of the
[2:59:03] sacrifice that's the only place God met
[2:59:05] man then that's the only place God will
[2:59:07] meet man now hey man or ever dead I'm
[2:59:10] reading with man there again and that's
[2:59:13] the only place he meets this man today
[2:59:16] today is under the blood shed blood of
[2:59:18] the sacrifice hey man he'll not meet you
[2:59:21] he goes on saying he'll not meet you Sam
[2:59:23] any costal he won't meet you either say
[2:59:25] in your message believer he won't meet
[2:59:28] you say oh I got this mystery and I know
[2:59:30] this and we are to you today we don't
[2:59:33] need blood we got an atonement my faith
[2:59:35] he will not meet you he will meet you
[2:59:38] under one condition
[2:59:40] and that's under the shed blood when
[2:59:43] your sins have been confessed and
[2:59:45] expelled in his presence and then by the
[2:59:48] blood and that blood is always before
[2:59:50] him and therefore that he can only see
[2:59:52] you through that shed blood and you're
[2:59:55] white as snow see you've done confessor
[2:59:58] you've can when you confess your sins
[2:59:59] otherwise you're not there and you can't
[3:00:01] fellowship and that's the reason listen
[3:00:05] that's the reason you don't see things
[3:00:07] happen and in the churches they confess
[3:00:10] to believe the blood but they reject a
[3:00:13] very plan to get to the blood the word
[3:00:16] use there's only one way God will honor
[3:00:19] that word you'll never honor it that
[3:00:22] words come say I'm a Roman Catholic I
[3:00:24] might demand this to be done you can't
[3:00:26] do it Methodist Baptist Pentecostals you
[3:00:29] can't do it there
[3:00:30] only way you can do it is under the
[3:00:32] mercies of God through His grace is to
[3:00:35] come through the shed blood of Jesus
[3:00:36] Christ and say Lord I claim the promise
[3:00:40] and if you're really under that Blood
[3:00:42] God is obligated to that word but first
[3:00:45] you got to be under that blood you see
[3:00:48] it now
[3:00:49] no wonder they can't believe in miracles
[3:00:51] no wonder they can't believe in
[3:00:52] supernatural
[3:00:53] no wonder they can they condemn it
[3:00:55] that's the reason they condemn it and
[3:00:57] back there is the same reason they
[3:01:00] condemn it today and there is guilty as
[3:01:01] guilty of me because it's only this shed
[3:01:04] blood and those who would dare some
[3:01:07] little brother dares under humility to
[3:01:09] take God at His Word walk out there
[3:01:11] confess his sins forget these dogmas and
[3:01:13] things and stand there under the blood
[3:01:16] and believe it they want to call him a
[3:01:17] fanatic that want to call him there as I
[3:01:20] say it's not a good word to use it to
[3:01:22] pulpit so you'll understand he's an
[3:01:24] oddball you see but there's only one
[3:01:30] place that he's going to meet us and
[3:01:33] brother Brandon would say in that next
[3:01:36] quote he said and God will never meet it
[3:01:39] till it comes under the care of that
[3:01:42] blood now the power of this mud
[3:01:54] it brought squirrels into existence
[3:01:58] nothing not three squirrels but three
[3:02:02] times three and then the next one God
[3:02:09] spoken word is somebody with me how did
[3:02:14] that happen a simple man standing under
[3:02:17] the shed blood calling those things that
[3:02:21] I that are not as though they were and
[3:02:23] speak and call a creation by a man I'm
[3:02:27] showing you I'm referring to you what
[3:02:30] the blood has done where has the blood
[3:02:34] position esteemed that God put that in
[3:02:38] our message today it was showing you
[3:02:40] what a redeem where I read
