[43:39] the church the sisters everyone who
[43:42] donated
[43:43] gave time money expense whatever anyway
[43:46] to the
[43:47] sale yesterday they they got nearly 80
[43:50] to

[43:56] amen so we appreciate that and god bless
[43:59] you thank you for your efforts
[44:01] and what you did amen we really
[44:04] really thank you for giving to the lord
[44:07] also i i
[44:08] wanted to make uh mention that we
[44:11] are going full steam ahead with the
[44:14] um translations of brother branham
[44:17] sermons
[44:18] into the japanese language these are
[44:22] uh can be found on the message hub and
[44:26] you can those that are interested
[44:29] in those translations can go there and
[44:31] find them and
[44:33] and i just got a picture as i do seem
[44:36] like every sunday
[44:37] from the group there in japan as they
[44:39] sent us a
[44:41] photograph of their gathering
[44:44] and they continue to to gather and
[44:47] worship the lord as um
[44:50] as uh things go forward and
[44:53] continue adding to souls to the kingdom
[44:56] and we're thankful for that they look
[44:58] just like a lovely lovely group of
[45:00] people
[45:01] and also um we
[45:04] uh you know as you remember we had
[45:08] planned to go to japan and on to the
[45:10] philippines
[45:12] uh but due to brother ron spencer's bout
[45:14] with cancer and then
[45:16] the covet fell right on the heels of
[45:19] that
[45:20] and they were already stopping boats and
[45:23] and
[45:23] quarantine and whatever in in different
[45:25] places we didn't want to get stranded in
[45:27] the country
[45:28] so we canceled the meetings there
[45:32] we had a miracle that actually happened
[45:34] and you
[45:35] you all have heard how the airlines are
[45:38] hurting
[45:39] for for business and they
[45:42] the delta airlines did an unheard of
[45:44] thing they refunded to us
[45:46] twelve thousand dollars worth of tickets
[45:49] and uh so we got all of that back so
[45:51] that we can
[45:52] use it for the kingdom of god and
[45:55] as you know in february i was supposed
[45:57] to be in japan and we went instead
[46:00] to brother ron spencer's and i
[46:03] met there with brother donnie reagan and
[46:05] we had prayer
[46:06] for brother ron and while i was there
[46:10] you recall a japanese professor who was
[46:13] streaming the service
[46:15] he got saved that night and
[46:19] and since that time now this is the
[46:22] miracle of it
[46:24] since that time it is reported there
[46:26] have been 12
[46:27] professors that have been saved
[46:30] five of which are japanese
[46:40] and just last night a couple of the
[46:42] professors were streaming brother jason
[46:44] jackson who was a guest minister
[46:46] at brother ron spencer's and they were
[46:49] translating the sermon
[46:50] live into the japanese language and
[46:54] also reportedly some other languages as
[46:56] well i understand
[46:58] portuguese different languages that they
[47:01] that they speak
[47:02] and we're translating into them and at
[47:04] the end
[47:05] two two of those that were listening
[47:08] in screamed out that they wanted to be
[47:11] saved
[47:12] and so you know we just continue to see
[47:15] the lord
[47:16] do mighty things and look like sometimes
[47:19] satan blocks us on one side and god's
[47:22] just got a bigger and better plan
[47:24] amen because he's unstoppable and so is
[47:28] his bride
[47:29] amen and so you know as you know
[47:33] [Music]
[47:34] in july brother ron came here on a
[47:37] mission
[47:38] to get to jesus and since that time
[47:42] he has been preaching with with great
[47:45] power and great anointing
[47:47] he's not missed a day of work due to
[47:49] sickness
[47:50] and on november the 11th coming up
[47:53] uh that's um uh what is it armistead's
[47:56] day
[47:57] brother ron is again to have complete
[48:00] body scans
[48:01] and we just want you to pray with us
[48:04] concerning that for a total deliverance
[48:08] and um i wrote this down this morning
[48:11] and
[48:12] thought i was going to be sending it out
[48:13] to the airways
[48:15] but i've got a word for kenneth
[48:17] middleton who's here this morning god
[48:19] bless you brother kenneth
[48:20] amen welcome in the name of jesus amen
[48:24] i and that word is don't give up on the
[48:28] harvest
[48:30] two years ago in october he was given up
[48:32] to die
[48:33] and doctors had advised to call the
[48:35] family in and
[48:37] even his son came from montana we went
[48:40] on
[48:40] that sunday to pray for him after we'd
[48:43] had a powerful service where
[48:45] i was preaching on the new birth of
[48:47] malachi 4
[48:48] i think it was part three of that and
[48:51] all of us ministers here went to
[48:53] went to pray for him we stood around his
[48:57] bed and had prayer and
[48:58] and then you know i was i was talking
[49:01] about the power
[49:02] of our christ and the authority of
[49:03] believers and our position
[49:05] and where we stand and and um and so
[49:09] after prayer asked him to speak them
[49:12] what he desired and he said
[49:15] to be in church on wednesday night for
[49:17] the october meetings and
[49:19] he he was there for the entire october
[49:22] meetings a man who was on his death bed
[49:24] that they'd call the family in on sunday
[49:27] and then there on wednesday he's in
[49:30] church wednesday thursday friday
[49:32] saturday sunday
[49:33] amen and um you know a little later the
[49:37] cat
[49:37] the the doctors gave him a report that
[49:39] also his cancer was gone
[49:42] since that time brother brother kenneth
[49:45] has been
[49:46] instrumental in leading his grandson
[49:48] timothy here to christ and
[49:51] he's a he's a bright spot in our
[49:53] services i rejoice every time i see him
[49:55] sitting there on
[49:57] on the front row and and you know just
[49:59] believing
[50:00] um you know this is part of the harvest
[50:03] i'm talking about
[50:05] you know um you know god's kept you here
[50:07] brother kenneth for a purpose
[50:10] amen and this is part of the purpose
[50:13] amen this week brother kenneth got a
[50:15] report his numbers were back
[50:16] up and the doctors said they also have
[50:19] said they can do nothing for his heart
[50:21] condition
[50:22] but let me just say it again don't give
[50:25] up on the harvest
[50:27] we're in an hour that god is doing great
[50:29] things
[50:31] amen and just to see you in church today
[50:34] is a great thing
[50:35] and it tells me you hadn't given up amen
[50:39] so let's continue believing praying
[50:42] and expecting amen and if god does call
[50:46] one of us home
[50:47] here there well we'll just meet um
[50:50] in the in the on that great morning that
[50:53] morning
[50:54] bright and fair amen when the last phase
[50:57] of the rapture
[50:58] sounds and the trumpet of god sounds and
[51:00] the dead in christ
[51:01] rise and we go to meet him in the air
[51:04] but if you're
[51:05] praying for a promise of god to be
[51:08] manifested
[51:09] then i urge you also don't give up on
[51:12] the harvest
[51:13] if you if you've been barren keep on
[51:16] believing for a baby
[51:17] don't don't give up believing the angel
[51:20] is about to return
[51:22] amen if you've had a need in your body
[51:24] if you've got
[51:25] loved ones that have been lost and out
[51:27] there if you've got situation financial
[51:30] problems
[51:31] whatever it is lawsuits that's against
[51:33] you the devils come on every side
[51:35] just don't give up on believing just
[51:38] hold on
[51:40] you're going to reap if you think not
[51:43] amen you don't give up on the harvest
[51:46] we're on the threshold of
[51:48] many great things
[51:51] many great things we as you know
[51:54] in 1933 brother branham had seven
[51:57] continuous visions
[51:59] and you gotta remember the time era in
[52:01] which he was at
[52:03] it was before world war ii and he in
[52:06] this vision he wrote that mussolini
[52:08] would invade
[52:09] ethiopia and that nation would fall at
[52:12] his feet
[52:13] the vision then went on to show that
[52:15] mussolini would come to a horrible end
[52:17] with his own people turning on him
[52:19] then the next the next vision continued
[52:22] or
[52:23] i went into another scene of this
[52:27] of this vision and there was an
[52:30] austrian by the name of adolf hitler
[52:32] that he saw would rise as a dictator
[52:35] over germany and would draw
[52:36] the world into war it showed um
[52:40] you know the the line there how the
[52:42] troops would have a
[52:43] terrible time trying to overcome it and
[52:46] showed them that hitler would come to a
[52:48] mysterious
[52:49] end and of course even today they
[52:52] haven't come to even firm conclusions on
[52:54] where he is what happened where's his
[52:56] body you know or anything
[52:58] the third vision show was in the realm
[53:01] of world politics
[53:03] and it showed that there would be three
[53:05] great isms
[53:07] and uh there would be fascism and nazism
[53:10] and communism
[53:12] but that the two would be swallowed up
[53:14] into the third and then
[53:16] the voice admonish um to watch russia
[53:19] watch russia
[53:20] keep your eye on the king of the north
[53:23] the fourth vision showed that there
[53:25] would be great advances
[53:26] in science that would come after the
[53:29] second world war
[53:31] and it was headed up in a vision of um
[53:35] of an egg-shaped driverless car
[53:39] where that it was just running down
[53:41] beautiful highways
[53:43] so people was you know and it seemed
[53:46] like that the whole car had been
[53:47] rearranged where the people were just
[53:49] sitting together you know playing some
[53:52] sort of a game to amuse themselves as
[53:55] as this car went down the road without a
[53:58] steering wheel
[53:59] and we're right here as you know our
[54:02] technology is there
[54:03] the releases are taking place they're
[54:05] actually driving on our
[54:07] highways it hadn't been released yet to
[54:09] the public but
[54:10] we're right here on the cusp of it
[54:14] the fifth vision had to do with the
[54:16] moral problem of our age
[54:19] centered mostly around women and he said
[54:22] god showed him that
[54:23] women began to be out of their place
[54:25] with the granting of the vote
[54:27] then they cut off their hair which
[54:28] signified they were no longer the
[54:30] under the authority of a man but
[54:33] insisted on either
[54:34] equal rights or in most cases more than
[54:37] equal
[54:38] rights and she adopted men's clothing
[54:42] went to a state of undress
[54:43] until the light the last picture i saw
[54:46] was a woman naked except for a little
[54:48] fig leaf
[54:49] type apron and with this vision i saw
[54:52] the terrible perversion and moral plight
[54:54] of the whole world
[54:57] and i just want to say to you who would
[54:58] have thought
[55:00] who would have ever thought that
[55:02] abortion would escalate
[55:04] to a high of 1.5 million
[55:08] a year in america that same-sex
[55:11] marriages would become
[55:13] legal and not just legal but forced upon
[55:17] to recognize or that they when
[55:20] just simply filling out a doctor's
[55:22] questionnaire at a
[55:24] at a clinic that they would ask you what
[55:26] sex
[55:27] you were born and then what sex do you
[55:30] identify as
[55:33] we're living in that time it's great
[55:36] time of immorality in the world today
[55:39] then the sixth vision there rose up in
[55:42] america
[55:43] most beautiful but cruel woman she held
[55:46] the people in her complete power
[55:48] and he said i believe this could be the
[55:50] rise of the roman catholic church though
[55:51] i knew
[55:52] it could possibly be a vision of some
[55:55] woman rising in great power due to the
[55:57] popular vote by
[55:58] women and then
[56:02] then finally the seventh vision was
[56:05] was he heard a terrible explosion and
[56:07] looked and i saw
[56:08] nothing but debris and craters and smoke
[56:12] all over the land of america
[56:14] and today we face nuclear threats from
[56:17] iran
[56:18] north korea china and russia
[56:23] and we're here at a time you know where
[56:26] um someone said well it is 2020.
[56:30] so all kinds of things are seem to be
[56:32] happening and everything that
[56:34] what we think would go a certain way
[56:37] doesn't go that way
[56:39] and we don't know yet since the
[56:41] elections are being contested
[56:44] but if mr biden wins we will have the
[56:46] first
[56:47] catholic president since jfk
[56:52] and already every supreme court justice
[56:54] is a
[56:55] roman catholic with the exception of one
[56:57] jew
[56:59] so our court is packed the presidency
[57:03] will be
[57:04] a catholic and brother branham when jfk
[57:07] came in he said i don't think mr kennedy
[57:10] will have much effect
[57:11] now because he'll make a wonderful
[57:13] president
[57:14] in order to bring others bringing the
[57:17] others
[57:18] and so you know again we look at that
[57:21] and we think about it
[57:23] we realize you know um
[57:27] jfk is looked upon with honor respect
[57:31] and and great love in in america
[57:34] but he certainly came in and is in a in
[57:37] a place
[57:38] where he made the way for other
[57:40] catholics to come in and
[57:41] and where that we are now totally
[57:45] packed with that now if he wins
[57:48] it looks like that kamala harris will
[57:50] fulfill this
[57:52] and just remember this it's going to
[57:54] come to pass whether it's this election
[57:55] or not
[57:57] but brother branham said in that in the
[57:59] message from that time
[58:01] he said this is a woman's nation it is
[58:04] number 13.
[58:05] it appears in the 13th chapter of
[58:07] revelation 13 stars 13 stripes
[58:10] 13 everything's at 13 everything's a
[58:12] woman
[58:13] and remember thus saith the lord there
[58:16] will be a woman ruled before the end
[58:18] time
[58:19] now watch how he says that she will
[58:21] either be president
[58:23] vice president or it'll be
[58:26] the catholic church as a woman i seen
[58:30] her
[58:30] a great woman the nation bowed to her
[58:33] it'll be one before the end time thus
[58:36] saith the lord
[58:38] write it down and find out your young
[58:39] people see if it happened
[58:41] if it isn't i'm a false prophet
[58:45] and and so you know as
[58:48] of course if this happens there's a
[58:51] great
[58:52] likelihood that mr biden will fade
[58:55] quickly leaving uh kamala is
[58:58] as president and this will this will
[59:01] make
[59:02] as brother branham would look and he'd
[59:04] see this woman
[59:05] now it wasn't part of the vision but he
[59:08] he always kept saying even when he wrote
[59:12] this down and he had it
[59:13] that could be the catholic church and
[59:16] she was president or vice president or
[59:18] in some great position
[59:20] and he said i saw the nation bow into
[59:23] her
[59:24] and and as we look at it you know if
[59:27] if this transpires the way it seems to
[59:30] be going
[59:31] we will have a we'll have a catholic
[59:34] president
[59:35] there's a catholic amen and then if she
[59:38] comes in as vice president
[59:40] then we'll have her as vice president
[59:43] and then if he fades off the scene
[59:45] we'll have her as president so no wonder
[59:48] when he's looking at it you know she
[59:50] would be either
[59:51] vice president or president or it could
[59:53] be the catholic church
[59:57] and we're looking right at it and then
[1:00:00] with this new administration being
[1:00:03] soft on iran with their insane nuclear
[1:00:06] deal and soft on north korea and
[1:00:09] soft on china who steadily became a
[1:00:11] threat to world peace and unable to
[1:00:13] stand up to russia
[1:00:15] as the democrats are gutless liberals
[1:00:19] who are more concerned about abortion
[1:00:21] rights and gay rights and the blm
[1:00:23] movement
[1:00:24] and their social agenda than they are
[1:00:26] about america and world
[1:00:28] peace and in israel instead of becoming
[1:00:31] a favor
[1:00:32] and still being a favored nation will
[1:00:34] become again a hated nation
[1:00:37] so we are on the threshold of prophecies
[1:00:41] being fulfilled
[1:00:43] and i'm going to be speaking this
[1:00:45] morning on standing on the threshold
[1:00:48] of full redemption now
[1:00:52] for this i'm going to be going to the
[1:00:54] book of revelation
[1:00:56] which contains end time prophecies
[1:00:59] that were wrote in symbol form and would
[1:01:01] remain mysterious
[1:01:03] until the days of the voice of the
[1:01:04] seventh angel when he began to sound
[1:01:07] then the mystery of god would be
[1:01:08] finished or
[1:01:10] completed and we would know and
[1:01:12] understand
[1:01:14] this is why i had the youth choir and
[1:01:16] jeremy thank you
[1:01:18] my that was so powerful as you sang
[1:01:21] together this morning is he worthy
[1:01:24] so i had them to sing that this morning
[1:01:26] was because
[1:01:28] we're going to be looking at the worthy
[1:01:30] lamb
[1:01:31] and what his blood of atonement has done
[1:01:34] for us
[1:01:35] now i've got a long ways to go and it's
[1:01:38] already afternoon
[1:01:40] so um hold your you know be be patient
[1:01:43] with me
[1:01:44] but let's stand together as we read
[1:01:46] revelation 5
[1:01:48] and verse 1 and i saw in the right hand
[1:01:52] of him that sat on the throne a book
[1:01:54] written within and on the backside
[1:01:56] sealed with seven seals and i saw an
[1:01:59] angel proclaiming with a loud voice who
[1:02:02] is worthy to open the book
[1:02:04] and to loose the seals thereof and no
[1:02:07] man in heaven nor in earth
[1:02:09] neither under the earth was able to open
[1:02:11] the book neither to look there on
[1:02:14] and i wept much because no man was found
[1:02:17] worthy to open and to read the book
[1:02:19] neither
[1:02:20] to look their own and one of the elders
[1:02:22] said unto me weep not behold the line of
[1:02:25] the tribe of judah
[1:02:27] the root of david have prevailed to open
[1:02:29] the book and to loose
[1:02:31] the seven seals thereof and i beheld and
[1:02:34] lo
[1:02:34] in the midst of the throne and of the
[1:02:36] four beasts in the midst of the
[1:02:38] elders stood a lamb as it had been slain
[1:02:42] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[1:02:45] are the seven spirits of god
[1:02:47] sent forth into all the earth and he
[1:02:49] came and took the book
[1:02:50] out of the right hand of him that sat
[1:02:52] upon the throne
[1:02:54] and when he had taken the book the four
[1:02:55] beasts and the four and twenty elders
[1:02:57] fell
[1:02:58] down before the lamb having every one of
[1:03:00] them harps and gold and vials full of
[1:03:02] odors
[1:03:03] which are the prayers of the saints and
[1:03:06] they sung a new song
[1:03:07] saying thou art worthy to take the book
[1:03:10] and to open the seals thereof for thou
[1:03:12] slain and has redeemed us to god
[1:03:15] by thy blood out of every kindred and
[1:03:17] tongue in people and nation and has made
[1:03:19] us unto our god-kings and priests
[1:03:22] and we shall reign on the earth and i
[1:03:24] beheld and
[1:03:26] i and heard the voice of many angels
[1:03:30] round about the throne the beast and the
[1:03:32] elders and the numbers of them were
[1:03:34] ten thousand times ten thousands and
[1:03:36] thousands of thousands
[1:03:38] saying with a loud voice worthy is a
[1:03:41] lamb that was slain
[1:03:42] to receive power and riches and wisdom
[1:03:45] and strength and honor
[1:03:47] and glory and blessing and every
[1:03:49] creature which is
[1:03:51] in heaven and on the earth and under the
[1:03:53] earth such as are
[1:03:55] in the sea and all that are in them
[1:03:57] heard i say and
[1:03:58] blessing and honor and glory and power
[1:04:01] be into him that sitteth upon the throne
[1:04:04] and to the lamb forever and ever and the
[1:04:06] four beasts said amen
[1:04:08] and the four and twenty elders fell down
[1:04:10] and worshiped him
[1:04:12] that liveth forever and ever
[1:04:15] amen may god bless you you can be seated
[1:04:20] standing on the threshold of full
[1:04:24] redemption
[1:04:26] again we posed a question last sunday
[1:04:29] and
[1:04:30] and i want to bring back some of that
[1:04:33] back to your
[1:04:34] to interview again where is the church
[1:04:38] standing what what
[1:04:40] is our position now exactly where do we
[1:04:43] stand in this hour
[1:04:44] as we look to the fulfillment of
[1:04:47] scripture
[1:04:48] and knowing that we are here in the last
[1:04:51] days
[1:04:52] and reading this morning we read of a
[1:04:54] scripture that is absolutely pertinent
[1:04:57] to our age and time
[1:04:59] that if not fulfilled then the rapture
[1:05:01] will never take place and the word of
[1:05:03] god will never be
[1:05:05] totally manifested it must be fulfilled
[1:05:09] we see that noticing that in the lamb in
[1:05:12] revelation 5 that he's not an animal
[1:05:15] this is symbolic and he takes the book
[1:05:18] out of the right hand of him that sat
[1:05:20] upon the throne
[1:05:22] and who was it it was the very owner of
[1:05:24] the original
[1:05:26] uh the original owner that had the book
[1:05:28] of redemption in his right hand
[1:05:30] and there was no angel no angelic being
[1:05:33] there was no
[1:05:34] prophet or priest or king who was worthy
[1:05:37] to take this book
[1:05:39] and this bloody lamb walked out
[1:05:42] and took the book out of his hand and as
[1:05:46] brother branham would
[1:05:47] look at this he would describe this as
[1:05:49] the most sublime
[1:05:51] which means awesome majestic glorious
[1:05:55] rapturous thing in the scripture
[1:05:59] and that that not an angel not anyone
[1:06:02] could do that the lamb
[1:06:04] came and took it from the right hand of
[1:06:07] him that sat on the throne
[1:06:10] and he's the one that holds it as god's
[1:06:13] law required a kinsmen redeemer
[1:06:17] and the lamb came out boldly and said i
[1:06:20] am their
[1:06:21] kinsmen i am their redeemer and i have
[1:06:24] made
[1:06:25] intercession for them and now i have
[1:06:29] come to claim
[1:06:31] redemption rights i've come to claim
[1:06:34] their rights and that
[1:06:35] they have a right to everything that was
[1:06:38] lost
[1:06:39] in the fall amen and i paid the price
[1:06:43] my goodness that makes me feel religious
[1:06:45] don't you
[1:06:46] amen to to just think it wasn't by good
[1:06:49] works that we had done
[1:06:51] it wasn't that we were worthy to take
[1:06:53] the book
[1:06:54] but by his mercy
[1:06:58] in fact for the matter is as i review
[1:07:01] the scriptures all together and
[1:07:03] and see what happens in revelation 10
[1:07:06] and the little book that's taken out of
[1:07:07] the hand
[1:07:09] of the angel christ it comes down with
[1:07:11] the open
[1:07:12] book and i and i view that scene and i
[1:07:16] see
[1:07:16] john being commanded to take the little
[1:07:19] book and to eat it
[1:07:21] that i look and i see back that there
[1:07:23] was a time
[1:07:24] he could not even approach the book he
[1:07:27] wasn't even worthy to look on the book
[1:07:30] he wasn't able to get close to the book
[1:07:33] but a kinsmen
[1:07:34] came a redeemer came and paid
[1:07:38] redemption's price and what was not
[1:07:41] john's
[1:07:42] ability to receive it all now it's just
[1:07:45] handed to him
[1:07:46] by grace i want you to know
[1:07:49] grace is a great thing the favor of god
[1:07:53] amen where he paid the price of
[1:07:55] redemption
[1:07:56] no wonder them elders and the that
[1:07:59] began to cry out and threw off the
[1:08:02] crowns and
[1:08:03] the dignitaries got on the ground to
[1:08:05] begin to worship him
[1:08:10] no one could do it he walks right up in
[1:08:12] the hand of god and takes the book out
[1:08:14] of
[1:08:15] his hands and claims his rights and said
[1:08:18] i've died for them
[1:08:21] my blood was shed i became a man
[1:08:24] now if you really look at the scene the
[1:08:26] one on the throne
[1:08:28] not another god the one on the throne
[1:08:31] became the lamb because he's also the
[1:08:35] lion the king
[1:08:37] is that right he's the king yet he's he
[1:08:40] became the lamb
[1:08:42] amen he's the god of the king of the
[1:08:45] universe but he became the lamb
[1:08:47] for us all when i think of the psalm
[1:08:50] that said
[1:08:50] who is man or what is man that thou art
[1:08:53] mindful of him
[1:08:55] or the son of man that's a prophet that
[1:08:58] you would visit him
[1:09:00] amen oh my to think about this
[1:09:03] what does sublime think the statement or
[1:09:06] act
[1:09:07] i have paid it i did it with my own
[1:09:10] blood and
[1:09:11] he demand christ jesus now remember
[1:09:15] he had it as god so it wasn't being
[1:09:18] taken as as
[1:09:20] god getting it but he became a man to
[1:09:23] get it
[1:09:24] for man is that right amen he has it in
[1:09:27] his hand
[1:09:28] and it's been in the hand of god all the
[1:09:30] time since adam lost it but
[1:09:32] now it's in the hand of of the lamb
[1:09:36] the title deed of all creation
[1:09:39] has was in the hand of god and now the
[1:09:41] lamb comes to claim it
[1:09:43] now i didn't come to claim it for angels
[1:09:48] i want you to know as great as the
[1:09:50] greatest angels are
[1:09:52] that the earth is not for them
[1:09:55] and as several and deceitful as the
[1:09:59] most wicked angel is which is lucifer
[1:10:03] amen the earth is not his to possess
[1:10:08] amen amen you just get a revelation of
[1:10:11] that this morning you look at your earth
[1:10:12] and said satan you don't have no claim
[1:10:14] on me
[1:10:16] it don't belong to you it's not yours to
[1:10:20] possess
[1:10:21] amen but again again you know he didn't
[1:10:25] come to claim it for angels
[1:10:27] but he come to claim it for the humans
[1:10:31] that the sons and daughters of god
[1:10:34] make them back in position
[1:10:37] of sonship again you see
[1:10:40] everything was lost the whole creation
[1:10:43] trees everything
[1:10:44] animal life as the bible said they even
[1:10:46] grown
[1:10:47] until now because when the god of the
[1:10:50] earth
[1:10:51] man fell so did all the creation fall
[1:10:54] with it
[1:10:55] but this is all about restoring the god
[1:10:58] of the earth back to his position again
[1:11:03] fully redeeming now
[1:11:07] as we look at this he didn't come to
[1:11:09] claim it for himself
[1:11:12] he already had it as god it was his
[1:11:16] he made the earth it was always his
[1:11:20] and then he came and he gives the earth
[1:11:23] to his son
[1:11:24] adam and adam of course
[1:11:27] forfeits it and but but as we
[1:11:31] think of it here he comes and he becomes
[1:11:34] a kinsmen redeemer
[1:11:36] in that in the old testament when a man
[1:11:39] would get in debt
[1:11:40] and he couldn't pay his debt they would
[1:11:42] many times sell him his children his
[1:11:45] and his property and all and to pay his
[1:11:48] debts
[1:11:50] but you see there was designed in the
[1:11:52] law to have a kinsmen redeemer
[1:11:56] this kinsman redeemer was not only a
[1:11:58] redeemer he was an adventurer
[1:12:00] that if you got hurt unjustly and
[1:12:03] somebody did something maliciously to
[1:12:05] you
[1:12:05] it was iron eye and tooth for a tooth
[1:12:09] even if they if your neighbor knocked
[1:12:11] your tooth out and
[1:12:12] and whatever you had a the kinsman
[1:12:14] avenger had a right to come and knock
[1:12:16] your tooth out
[1:12:17] or the the neighbor's tooth out are you
[1:12:20] with me
[1:12:21] because he's not only redeemer but he
[1:12:23] also does the work of adventure
[1:12:27] and i want you that are troubled to rest
[1:12:29] with us this morning
[1:12:31] knowing this that redemption is almost
[1:12:34] full
[1:12:35] and it's going to be the time for the
[1:12:37] kinsman adventure
[1:12:38] to take his role and pour out the vials
[1:12:42] on the earth
[1:12:44] and he will destroy those that destroyed
[1:12:46] the earth
[1:12:48] and he will avenge his servants
[1:12:51] and i just want you to know whatever the
[1:12:54] devil has done to you
[1:12:55] he's not going to get by with it
[1:12:59] because your retreat your redeemer your
[1:13:02] kinsman is on his trail
[1:13:10] look out satan here he comes
[1:13:15] you got every right and every reason to
[1:13:17] tremble in your boots
[1:13:20] amen because here he's on your trail
[1:13:23] now as we think of this that here
[1:13:27] the lamb as redeemer comes to
[1:13:30] pay the debts against the book
[1:13:34] and to lose its seals so that you
[1:13:37] can enjoy the privilege of its contents
[1:13:42] and and of course this is
[1:13:46] this is what brother branham was saying
[1:13:48] what he says i want to see
[1:13:50] a church in position said the whole
[1:13:53] world
[1:13:54] and nature is growing and crying for the
[1:13:57] manifestation that word is apocalyptus
[1:14:00] which means the revelation
[1:14:04] of the sons of god the unveiling of the
[1:14:07] sons of god
[1:14:09] and brother madam said when they're
[1:14:10] unveiled in this manifestation he said
[1:14:13] when true sons feel son speak
[1:14:16] and their words is back say to this
[1:14:20] mountain let it be so
[1:14:22] waiting for the manifestations of the
[1:14:24] sons of god to position in the church
[1:14:27] god is wanting to place his church
[1:14:30] sons and daughters of god he said god
[1:14:32] let me live to see it
[1:14:33] my prayer is so close i'm only we're on
[1:14:36] the cusp
[1:14:37] we're so close even then amen
[1:14:41] i can almost feel it with my hands
[1:14:44] waiting for that time when walked down
[1:14:45] the street and there lays a
[1:14:47] laying there from his mother's womb
[1:14:49] silver and gold ever none
[1:14:51] waiting for the manifestations of the
[1:14:52] sons of god hallelujah
[1:14:54] when god will make himself known when
[1:14:56] they'll stop this
[1:14:58] sickness they'll stop cancer they'll
[1:15:00] stop diseases
[1:15:03] but to do this the lamb
[1:15:06] had to take the book of title from the
[1:15:09] one
[1:15:10] on the throne who was god
[1:15:13] who he added as god to become a man and
[1:15:16] claim it
[1:15:17] as a man for man
[1:15:20] and since it was closed and sealed then
[1:15:24] remove those seals and to do that
[1:15:26] he must take his blood
[1:15:29] because debts can only be paid for
[1:15:32] by lamb's blood amen because without the
[1:15:36] shedding of blood there's no remission
[1:15:38] of sins
[1:15:40] and then taking that blood erased the
[1:15:43] death of sins
[1:15:44] and that kept the book closed to man
[1:15:49] now we where are we standing where has
[1:15:52] god
[1:15:53] positioned us what has the blood
[1:15:57] done for us when a bloody lamb stepped
[1:16:00] forth to take the book
[1:16:02] and loose its seals and confers
[1:16:05] the title upon us you see it brings us
[1:16:09] back
[1:16:10] to where adam was before the fall
[1:16:14] and where the church was in the book of
[1:16:16] acts
[1:16:18] now i want you to understand there's
[1:16:21] these two
[1:16:22] distinct places where
[1:16:25] the first eve stood and the second he
[1:16:28] stood
[1:16:31] amen now before the fall
[1:16:34] where where the first seed stood and
[1:16:36] before she
[1:16:37] sold the human race and of course adam
[1:16:40] went with her for the sake of redemption
[1:16:42] but before the fall adam was in position
[1:16:45] as a son of god he operated in faith and
[1:16:49] with power and authority of heaven
[1:16:52] and and he spoke and trees moved
[1:16:56] he commanded and winds obeyed he
[1:16:59] exercised
[1:17:00] rights over the animals and called them
[1:17:03] by name and whatever he called them that
[1:17:05] was their name
[1:17:06] and the earth was in in a millennium
[1:17:09] condition
[1:17:12] but then sin enters and adam surrendered
[1:17:15] the title to everything earthly even his
[1:17:18] own body
[1:17:21] and it condemned us all to be born in a
[1:17:24] mortal condition
[1:17:26] sorry to say but mortality works in all
[1:17:29] of us
[1:17:30] and we can we we can get up and make
[1:17:33] pretensions you know that
[1:17:35] that you know we're we're priests like
[1:17:38] melchizedek and we will never die
[1:17:40] but death works in your mortal being
[1:17:43] you can preach sermons that you know
[1:17:45] that you will
[1:17:46] you will be alive and remain and and
[1:17:49] and won't see death but death works in
[1:17:52] our mortal beings
[1:17:54] and unfortunately the most godliest of
[1:17:57] saints die
[1:17:59] but that's not their end for they should
[1:18:02] rise
[1:18:02] first remember they come
[1:18:06] into their inheritance before we do
[1:18:10] and brother banham said actually they're
[1:18:12] favored before
[1:18:13] us amen so you know sometimes we think
[1:18:17] oh we're the favored one because we get
[1:18:19] to be alive and remain actually
[1:18:21] they're the favored ones because they
[1:18:24] get to move from this dimension
[1:18:26] into a dimension of the bless where
[1:18:28] there's no sickness no sorrow no trouble
[1:18:36] there's no worries about election or
[1:18:38] who's president or what's happened or
[1:18:39] the economy
[1:18:41] or this covet or this or that
[1:18:47] no misunderstandings no heartaches
[1:18:51] no separations
[1:18:59] the title deed to the earth when adam
[1:19:01] fell went back
[1:19:02] into the hands of almighty god satan
[1:19:05] couldn't take it
[1:19:06] he had no right to it the earth is not
[1:19:08] his it wasn't made for him
[1:19:11] but now he has a claim he has a claim
[1:19:14] because adam the god of the earth has
[1:19:17] yielded
[1:19:18] his body and the earth beneath
[1:19:23] into the control of satan
[1:19:27] now satan has he's an angel he has no
[1:19:29] right to the earth
[1:19:31] for god is its original owner and the
[1:19:34] earth was
[1:19:36] for god and his sons to dwell upon
[1:19:40] so now again satan has no right to men's
[1:19:43] bodies
[1:19:45] and satan has no right to mend souls
[1:19:50] amen for god is the original owner
[1:19:53] and satan's dirty hands couldn't take it
[1:19:56] yet he
[1:19:56] claims it because man surrendered to him
[1:19:59] so it becomes question
[1:20:01] and there are depths against it and man
[1:20:03] is cast into debtor's prison
[1:20:06] and they're left to work it out by the
[1:20:08] sweat of his brow
[1:20:11] and to suffer upon the earth and there
[1:20:14] on
[1:20:15] under the under this the slavery
[1:20:19] and of of sin let me tell you satan is a
[1:20:22] hard taskmaster
[1:20:25] sometimes you young people want to try
[1:20:27] some of that let me tell you
[1:20:29] you will be a slave
[1:20:32] try your tobacco you'll be a slave to
[1:20:34] try your drugs you'll become a slave to
[1:20:36] it
[1:20:36] try your sex you will be you become a
[1:20:39] slave to it
[1:20:41] all of the things satan is a hard master
[1:20:45] and there'll be
[1:20:46] days upon days on days you'll wish you'd
[1:20:49] never went there
[1:20:52] because sin always takes you further
[1:20:54] than you wanted to go
[1:20:59] now adam lost the title
[1:21:02] but now jesus the second adam comes to
[1:21:05] claim it
[1:21:07] and its redemption means i want you to
[1:21:10] get
[1:21:11] what the redeeming of this book means it
[1:21:14] means all legal possession
[1:21:17] to all that was lost by adam and eve
[1:21:20] wow
[1:21:26] i know that went over your head and you
[1:21:29] didn't
[1:21:30] fully comprehend but it means
[1:21:33] its redemption means all legal
[1:21:36] possessions
[1:21:37] to everything lost by adam and eve
[1:21:40] jesus paid the price by becoming the
[1:21:43] lamb of god to take away the sin of the
[1:21:45] world
[1:21:45] and the legal possession to the abstract
[1:21:48] title deity earth
[1:21:49] means that a man possesses everything
[1:21:53] that adam and eve lost
[1:21:58] so the great account of redemption shows
[1:22:01] that the one thrust
[1:22:03] on the throne holding the book of
[1:22:04] redemption becomes a lamb
[1:22:07] as a sacrifice and he's the perpetuation
[1:22:10] and he provides the blood that wipes
[1:22:13] away
[1:22:14] even the stain of sin
[1:22:21] adam lost the title to the earth it was
[1:22:24] out of their reach
[1:22:26] the old testament saints knew little of
[1:22:29] his content
[1:22:32] their glimpses of this book of
[1:22:34] redemption was so limited
[1:22:35] it was just types and shadows
[1:22:39] they didn't know they didn't know of a
[1:22:42] man
[1:22:42] who would become as it was the lamb
[1:22:45] and whose blood could cleanse us in the
[1:22:48] world they only knew
[1:22:49] a woolly animal
[1:22:55] and that blood could only cover sin but
[1:22:58] it could not
[1:22:59] it could not annihilate sin
[1:23:04] it could pardon sin but could not
[1:23:06] justify them
[1:23:09] and the nature of that lamb could never
[1:23:12] come back
[1:23:13] upon them so they could never be
[1:23:15] innocent
[1:23:17] they would get the lamb and offer it
[1:23:20] only to go back and do the same old
[1:23:22] stupid things again
[1:23:26] they knew nothing of grace but only of a
[1:23:28] law that condemned
[1:23:31] and it was precept upon precept and line
[1:23:33] up online
[1:23:34] and they so feared it that to even pick
[1:23:37] up a stick on the sabbath day
[1:23:42] would be a mortal sin to them
[1:23:45] their sabbath was a day
[1:23:50] and it wasn't a rest day it was an
[1:23:54] arrest from sin
[1:23:55] their circumcision was of the flesh and
[1:23:58] it was not
[1:23:59] of the heart by the holy ghost
[1:24:03] their land was but a physical land and
[1:24:05] not a place of god's presence
[1:24:08] and when they died there was no clear
[1:24:11] view
[1:24:11] of life everlasting
[1:24:15] think of that i mean to preach a funeral
[1:24:18] as it was
[1:24:19] in the in the old testament you had no
[1:24:22] promise of resurrection
[1:24:25] there was debates in question and there
[1:24:27] was no real assurity of anything
[1:24:32] you know there was no clear view of life
[1:24:35] everlasting one that died
[1:24:36] they couldn't go into god's presence
[1:24:38] either
[1:24:40] for the blood only rolled forward their
[1:24:42] sins to be dealt with when the true lamb
[1:24:44] of god came
[1:24:45] that could take away the sins of the
[1:24:47] world
[1:24:50] so they still they went to the grave
[1:24:55] with their sins simply pushed forward
[1:24:58] till the judge
[1:24:59] came
[1:25:05] there were old testament saints they
[1:25:07] waited in a place that jesus called
[1:25:10] abraham's bosom it's called
[1:25:13] also paradise it awaited the souls of
[1:25:16] men and women
[1:25:18] and they were held there the bible said
[1:25:21] they were captive
[1:25:23] he said he led captivity captive
[1:25:26] so they were captive they were waiting
[1:25:29] for someone to come pay sins debt
[1:25:31] so they could go into god's presence
[1:25:34] and it appears that they were and i and
[1:25:37] i and i'm
[1:25:38] venturing a bit without a without
[1:25:39] authority today but
[1:25:41] it just appears that they were in
[1:25:44] unchanged bodies as samuel was seen as
[1:25:48] an
[1:25:48] old man
[1:25:53] this place is known as the bosom of
[1:25:55] abraham or
[1:25:56] abraham's lap it envisions
[1:25:59] you know where a child is taken and
[1:26:01] comforted
[1:26:03] in the in the arms of a father
[1:26:06] and this is where that the old testament
[1:26:08] rested and waited
[1:26:10] for the blood of the true lamb would
[1:26:12] come and take away
[1:26:14] sin it's called abraham's bosom because
[1:26:16] they
[1:26:17] rested upon the hope that one day
[1:26:20] a redeemer would come the seed in which
[1:26:24] they were all be blessed
[1:26:27] and so they took comfort in we're
[1:26:30] abraham's children and there's a
[1:26:32] promise given to abraham and and so
[1:26:34] therefore
[1:26:35] since where abraham's seed will rest in
[1:26:38] the promise given to abraham
[1:26:41] but i want you to know that day on
[1:26:43] calvary jesus
[1:26:44] wiped out the death of the dead saints
[1:26:49] those that were waiting and they rose
[1:26:51] with him in a glorious triumphant moment
[1:26:54] i want to say that it made no difference
[1:26:57] whether they were in the land or out of
[1:26:59] the land
[1:27:00] whether but if they were under the blood
[1:27:02] covenant of god
[1:27:04] of the woolly lamb are you with me that
[1:27:07] day when jesus
[1:27:09] rose he raised them up with them
[1:27:12] having paid completely the debt of the
[1:27:15] old testament saints
[1:27:19] and there was not one of them left in
[1:27:22] that
[1:27:22] prison house but god emptied paradise
[1:27:30] and they rose with him and ascended with
[1:27:33] him
[1:27:33] into his presence debt-free
[1:27:40] hallelujah their sins gone
[1:27:43] dealt with amen no more an old samuel in
[1:27:47] an old body
[1:27:49] waiting for redemption claims but that
[1:27:51] day
[1:27:52] on calvary jesus paid sent
[1:27:55] debt and wiped out the debt of every
[1:27:59] child of abraham and they raised up
[1:28:03] with him according to matthew 28
[1:28:11] they went up and rose with him in the
[1:28:13] glorious triumph
[1:28:16] brother branham will describe in the
[1:28:18] entire message
[1:28:19] the excitement of abraham sarah daniel
[1:28:23] daniel was not was not buried in the
[1:28:25] promised land by the way
[1:28:26] he he was buried down in babylon he was
[1:28:29] out of his own desire he was taken down
[1:28:31] there
[1:28:34] amen it's just a type
[1:28:38] it's a type we've got to be buried in
[1:28:40] christ but all of them didn't have the
[1:28:41] privilege of being buried in the
[1:28:43] promised land
[1:28:48] jeremiah was taken out of the promised
[1:28:51] land died down in egypt
[1:28:54] all different ones and as far
[1:28:58] maybe as law they were condemned
[1:29:01] but that day on calvary
[1:29:05] it changed things forever for them
[1:29:08] amen and now now it was that
[1:29:11] that they were raptured up to with the
[1:29:15] lord
[1:29:16] amen and brother branham would describe
[1:29:19] it in the psalms and he said
[1:29:21] you know that that the heavens would
[1:29:23] would scream out the angels
[1:29:25] who is that king of glory and the old
[1:29:27] testament saints would
[1:29:28] rejoice back and say the lord triumphant
[1:29:31] in battle
[1:29:32] he is the king of glory
[1:29:36] open up your gates
[1:29:40] amen and let the king of glory come in
[1:29:45] what a marvelous moment that was
[1:29:49] and the book of titles that was against
[1:29:52] him
[1:29:52] oh hallelujah was totally cleared
[1:29:56] of every sin debt
[1:30:02] hallelujah and for the living although
[1:30:04] the anointed
[1:30:06] although the holy spirit had anointed
[1:30:07] men never had the holy spirit
[1:30:10] abode in men and they would abide on
[1:30:12] moses and would come down and
[1:30:14] leave and moses just be a man again
[1:30:17] and there he'd get angry and sin and
[1:30:19] keep him out of the promised land and
[1:30:21] you know he you know the anointing would
[1:30:23] come and it would go
[1:30:25] a lot a lot of like a lot of people
[1:30:27] today
[1:30:28] who aren't sealed with the holy ghost
[1:30:30] they'll get the anointing will come down
[1:30:32] and bless them oh
[1:30:34] and next thing you know they're back in
[1:30:36] sin again
[1:30:37] and then repent and come back but i want
[1:30:40] you to know
[1:30:41] let me just tell you friends that the
[1:30:44] holy spirit has promised
[1:30:45] us we'll seal you until the day of
[1:30:48] redemption
[1:30:55] before the living although the holy
[1:30:57] spirit had anointed men
[1:30:59] never had the holy spirit abode men but
[1:31:01] now
[1:31:02] god came and dwelt men
[1:31:05] in the upper room as 120.
[1:31:08] here comes that great pillar of fire
[1:31:11] the same one that had led to children of
[1:31:13] israel
[1:31:14] the same one that had guided the
[1:31:16] prophets the same one that had done
[1:31:19] that had come and abode in jesus and you
[1:31:22] didn't see the pillar of fire
[1:31:24] since it way after it came and abode in
[1:31:26] jesus until he left
[1:31:28] and then when he left he sent back the
[1:31:30] very pillar of fire
[1:31:33] amen the presence of god the holy spirit
[1:31:36] to come down on the day of pentecost
[1:31:40] and there he provided that every child
[1:31:42] of god
[1:31:43] would get a portion as the fire gave
[1:31:46] birth
[1:31:49] they became sons of god sons of god
[1:31:52] another son of god another son of god
[1:31:55] and another son of god
[1:31:56] as it went through like a rushing mighty
[1:31:58] wind
[1:31:59] [Applause]
[1:32:04] when god's newborn sons walked out of
[1:32:07] the upper room filled with the holy
[1:32:09] ghost
[1:32:10] amen let me tell you quite frankly the
[1:32:13] devil didn't know what to do with them
[1:32:16] amen it was a power that the devil
[1:32:18] couldn't stop
[1:32:20] no more was there a betrayal or a denial
[1:32:22] come on somebody
[1:32:24] but now there were men and women who
[1:32:26] were no longer fearful and afraid
[1:32:28] but with boldness would go out and speak
[1:32:30] the word of god
[1:32:31] the wondrous works of god began to issue
[1:32:35] out of their mouths
[1:32:36] [Applause]
[1:32:38] it was manifested in speaking in other
[1:32:40] languages as
[1:32:41] words came out speaking of the
[1:32:43] miraculous power of god
[1:32:46] now keep in mind this new testament
[1:32:48] church was unique it was one of a kind
[1:32:51] it was a seed church it was a mature
[1:32:53] church an elect church
[1:32:56] one let me just say it this way one that
[1:32:58] would not be seen
[1:33:00] again until the church returned to the
[1:33:02] seed grain
[1:33:04] in the last day
[1:33:08] the second age wouldn't be the same the
[1:33:11] third wouldn't be the same
[1:33:14] but rather the seed would go down into
[1:33:16] the ground
[1:33:20] because satan
[1:33:24] again beguiled the church
[1:33:30] this one was unique and one of a kind
[1:33:32] they were endued
[1:33:34] with powerful on high they were baptized
[1:33:37] with the holy ghost and received the
[1:33:39] received power and and the spirit that
[1:33:42] now indwelled
[1:33:42] them began to speak out words of eternal
[1:33:45] life
[1:33:47] and then peter then got up and he began
[1:33:49] to speak
[1:33:50] words and i want you to know that
[1:33:53] there wasn't a presidential speech
[1:33:56] there wasn't something from a great
[1:33:58] oracle they were
[1:34:00] something from from from god they were
[1:34:03] life
[1:34:04] empowering words life-changing words
[1:34:08] words
[1:34:09] that was once received in the heart
[1:34:11] would change that person forever
[1:34:15] amen repent every one of you you would
[1:34:17] say and be
[1:34:19] baptized in the name of jesus christ for
[1:34:21] the remission of sin
[1:34:23] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:34:26] holy ghost
[1:34:30] now power in the form of words flowing
[1:34:32] from the sons of the second adam spoke
[1:34:36] to fallen decrepit cursed crippled
[1:34:38] beggar
[1:34:40] and the same power that adam used over
[1:34:42] nature
[1:34:44] that made winds obey him
[1:34:47] amen to place a tree here or there
[1:34:50] to dress the garden and by which he
[1:34:53] controlled
[1:34:54] eden it is it is this
[1:34:57] begin to work now through the lips of
[1:34:59] sons of god
[1:35:01] the children of the second adam
[1:35:08] let me tell you they received an
[1:35:10] abstract title deed
[1:35:13] that means their debt was cleared it
[1:35:16] didn't matter whether mama did it or the
[1:35:18] daddy did or their grandparents or
[1:35:20] somebody in the past did
[1:35:21] it they were that was clear
[1:35:25] amen amen to think think about it they
[1:35:28] had
[1:35:29] every one of them received an abstract
[1:35:31] that means
[1:35:32] god searched them
[1:35:36] and found that they had genetic
[1:35:40] connections to the lamb before the
[1:35:43] foundation of the world
[1:35:45] and they were his
[1:35:48] and everyone that was kissed he sealed
[1:35:51] them
[1:35:52] to the day of redemption having wiped
[1:35:55] away
[1:35:56] all of his 10 folks death
[1:35:58] [Music]
[1:35:59] [Applause]
[1:36:08] these words would be the same words
[1:36:12] like the centurion recognized and
[1:36:14] realized
[1:36:15] that jesus being the second adam
[1:36:19] standing in position and authority in
[1:36:22] the place that he was like no other man
[1:36:24] the centurion realized that all jesus
[1:36:27] needed to do
[1:36:29] would just speak the word only and his
[1:36:31] servant would live
[1:36:33] amen he he they would be the same as
[1:36:37] jesus
[1:36:38] was where he cast out spirits with his
[1:36:41] word
[1:36:42] and healed all that were sick and this
[1:36:46] is what set him apart from all the
[1:36:48] rabbis and the theologians
[1:36:50] and the denominations of that day they
[1:36:52] were astonished at his
[1:36:54] doctrine for his word was with power
[1:36:58] and let me tell you something every son
[1:37:00] and daughter of god
[1:37:02] when the true church stands in her
[1:37:05] position i mean she will preach the same
[1:37:08] doctrine
[1:37:09] and it will be with power
[1:37:13] that no devil can withstand and
[1:37:16] by their word cast taken out
[1:37:20] [Music]
[1:37:27] the bible said in luke 4 36 they were
[1:37:29] all amazed and spake among
[1:37:31] themselves saying what a word is this
[1:37:35] for with authority and power he
[1:37:37] commandeth the unclean spirits and they
[1:37:39] came out
[1:37:42] amen listen don't play with devils don't
[1:37:46] just say i'm going to whip you that'll
[1:37:47] just make him mad
[1:37:50] don't broke at him and and and then just
[1:37:52] tell him where to go
[1:37:56] this is what jesus said for you do he
[1:37:58] never told you
[1:37:59] to to to poke out a serpent
[1:38:03] i rebuke you i rebuke you i rebuke you
[1:38:05] he just said
[1:38:06] cast them out and go on
[1:38:09] believing that the word you spoke is
[1:38:12] going to come to pass
[1:38:14] because all of heaven is behind those
[1:38:17] words
[1:38:19] as a son or daughter of god
[1:38:22] this is what we saw coming out of the
[1:38:24] upper room men with power endued from on
[1:38:27] high
[1:38:28] and they would speak to a fallen piece
[1:38:30] of of
[1:38:31] human soil and crippled limbs would snap
[1:38:34] and
[1:38:35] ankle bones be put into its place
[1:38:38] and they would tell how it happened by
[1:38:40] faith in the name
[1:38:42] of jesus and the authority given to us
[1:38:45] by our father because we are sons of god
[1:38:49] this man was made strong and completely
[1:38:52] healed
[1:38:55] amen this was a refreshing that came
[1:38:57] from god's presence that
[1:38:59] blotted out sins and generational curses
[1:39:03] and then peter declared a word that
[1:39:06] would
[1:39:07] instantly and automatically change
[1:39:10] a person's nature for through repentance
[1:39:14] and
[1:39:14] turning to god amen and and he preached
[1:39:18] that
[1:39:18] you too can receive this refreshing
[1:39:22] hallelujah and i read in the bible that
[1:39:25] even when they were threatened
[1:39:27] how many of you sometimes feel
[1:39:28] threatened in this age
[1:39:30] i mean you feel like there's pressure
[1:39:32] against you the
[1:39:33] enemy's against you in every kind of way
[1:39:36] and you feel threatened
[1:39:38] feel like the satan is just closing up
[1:39:40] on you
[1:39:41] well that day when they arrested them
[1:39:43] and commanded them not to preach or
[1:39:45] teach
[1:39:46] anymore in the name of jesus christ amen
[1:39:49] he they began to gather together and
[1:39:52] they began to pray
[1:39:53] and as they prayed the house where they
[1:39:55] were city were moved
[1:39:57] and they were filled again with the holy
[1:39:59] ghost
[1:40:00] i'm telling you it's a time that we're
[1:40:03] living in that we need a refreshing from
[1:40:05] the presence of god
[1:40:06] for people who are threatened people who
[1:40:09] are being abused
[1:40:10] people who the enemy has come in like a
[1:40:13] flood against them
[1:40:14] for them to take their stand and their
[1:40:17] bow up on their knees and call out unto
[1:40:20] god
[1:40:21] until the until the house moves
[1:40:24] amen and until the place is filled with
[1:40:27] the holy ghost
[1:40:28] and they are refreshed again in the
[1:40:31] presence of god
[1:40:34] what we needed evening like tabernacle
[1:40:36] today is another refreshing
[1:40:39] from the pulpit or shall i say from this
[1:40:41] back wall
[1:40:42] to that back wall wherever you're at in
[1:40:45] the booth or right there in the
[1:40:47] mezzanine or sitting on the back row
[1:40:49] or the front row or the middle or
[1:40:51] wherever you are it's time for
[1:40:53] refreshing
[1:40:54] from the presence of the lord
[1:41:03] peter declared
[1:41:06] that a word could instantly and
[1:41:09] automatically change a man's nature
[1:41:15] think of that
[1:41:18] reminds me of here not too long ago i
[1:41:21] sat down with a man and his wife
[1:41:24] and she was going through a terrible
[1:41:25] nervous breakdown
[1:41:27] didn't know which way to turn
[1:41:31] and i just sat down beside her and began
[1:41:34] to speak to her
[1:41:36] and began to talk about the spirit and
[1:41:38] the soul
[1:41:39] and began to place some things far into
[1:41:41] scripture
[1:41:42] and with a word i put her nature right
[1:41:46] back in place
[1:41:50] your spirit can all get all out of whack
[1:41:55] your soul never does it's constance it's
[1:41:59] confident once it's sealed it's sealed
[1:42:03] the devil can never break that seal
[1:42:06] amen but i tell you your spirit can get
[1:42:09] all out of whack and your emotions up
[1:42:11] and down
[1:42:12] and things of life can get you all torn
[1:42:15] up
[1:42:16] but the holy spirit in just one moment
[1:42:19] can take your spirit and put it right
[1:42:21] back
[1:42:22] in the socket of your soul where it
[1:42:26] belongs
[1:42:32] by coming into this rest it would give
[1:42:35] power over
[1:42:36] sin unbelief sickness and devils
[1:42:39] we found that sin could not stay in
[1:42:42] their presence
[1:42:43] or in their midst without being exposed
[1:42:46] and dealt with
[1:42:48] words that were spoken from the mouth of
[1:42:50] a son of god would bring
[1:42:53] would bring hypocrites swift judgment
[1:42:57] the same thing would happen in the book
[1:42:59] of acts
[1:43:00] down in cyprus where elements tried to
[1:43:03] hinder the word of god coming to a
[1:43:05] predestinated seed and
[1:43:07] the governor sergius paulus of the
[1:43:10] island of cyprus wanted to hear the word
[1:43:13] and and this false prophet elements
[1:43:16] opposed
[1:43:18] opposed them and and tried to turn the
[1:43:21] governor from the faith and
[1:43:24] paul's standing there filled with the
[1:43:26] holy ghost he looked straight
[1:43:28] in the element's eyes now i remember
[1:43:31] that at a youth camp here some time ago
[1:43:35] going down kneeling right down over a
[1:43:37] young man that was
[1:43:38] withered on the floor saying every kind
[1:43:41] of thing out of his mind
[1:43:43] and locking my eyes on his
[1:43:47] and taking control of the spirit that
[1:43:49] had him bound
[1:43:53] but let me tell you in this case this
[1:43:55] was a man opposing the work of god
[1:43:58] hindering the seed of god from coming in
[1:44:01] and paul looked upon them and looked
[1:44:03] straight at elements and said you
[1:44:05] child of the devil an enemy of
[1:44:07] everything that's right
[1:44:08] you're full of all kinds of deceit and
[1:44:11] trickery
[1:44:11] will you stop perverting the right ways
[1:44:14] of the lord
[1:44:14] and he said now the hand he began to
[1:44:16] prophesy
[1:44:18] words came out of his mouth and he said
[1:44:21] now the hand of the lord is against you
[1:44:23] you're going to be blind for some time
[1:44:26] not even to able to see the light of day
[1:44:28] and immediately mist and darkness come
[1:44:30] over
[1:44:30] him and he groped about seeking for
[1:44:32] somebody to lead him by the hand
[1:44:36] and when the governor saw this happen he
[1:44:40] was amazed about the teaching the lord
[1:44:41] and believed
[1:44:44] you remember i read this last sunday in
[1:44:46] the message communion it struck me
[1:44:48] as i had studied the message and went
[1:44:51] over it
[1:44:52] many years ago now and and
[1:44:55] and was able to finally
[1:44:58] after years of not having everything in
[1:45:00] print and
[1:45:01] years of not having it available and i
[1:45:04] haven't every sermon
[1:45:05] and i finally get it and i go through i
[1:45:08] go through those things
[1:45:10] that the prophet taught and i take it
[1:45:12] one service after another in
[1:45:13] chronological order
[1:45:15] from 63 through 65 and i get down the
[1:45:18] end i said well lord
[1:45:20] you know they say it all changed down to
[1:45:22] the end and he had
[1:45:24] you know that that the some of the
[1:45:25] things that we hold to
[1:45:27] it it's all changed what about it god
[1:45:29] i'm going to go to this
[1:45:30] last one the communion service and
[1:45:33] brother branham says in there you know
[1:45:34] the hour will soon arise
[1:45:36] that right among us will be the holy
[1:45:39] spirit speak out
[1:45:40] like it did in ananias sapphira remember
[1:45:43] the hour
[1:45:44] is arriving the
[1:45:47] hour is arriving for the holy spirit to
[1:45:49] speak out
[1:45:52] it don't just have to be it another nice
[1:45:54] sapphire
[1:45:57] it could be the need the need to
[1:46:00] do a mission trip to japan and god put
[1:46:04] ten thousand dollars in our hands and
[1:46:06] three thousand more
[1:46:07] for for personal money for the ones
[1:46:09] going it could be just that
[1:46:12] amen but the holy spirit will speak out
[1:46:15] like it did
[1:46:15] and ananias far remember that the hour
[1:46:19] is arriving remember that
[1:46:21] that god is going to dwell among his
[1:46:24] people
[1:46:26] that's what he wants to do now
[1:46:31] and that's still true nearly 55 years
[1:46:35] later
[1:46:38] god declared i'll have a bride i'll have
[1:46:41] a church
[1:46:42] without a spot or wrinkle or any such
[1:46:45] thing
[1:46:47] i'll separate the truth from the
[1:46:49] pretenders
[1:46:53] the end time harvest is a time of
[1:46:56] separation
[1:46:58] where where the tares are gathered and
[1:47:01] and bundled
[1:47:04] you see we're we're in a time where that
[1:47:07] god's doing a great separation sometimes
[1:47:10] we don't want to be different we want to
[1:47:12] be like the rest of the world
[1:47:14] but to be like the rest of the world is
[1:47:16] to be bundled with them
[1:47:19] god made you to be different he made you
[1:47:22] to be a peculiar people
[1:47:25] and the bible tells us that these
[1:47:27] newborn sons whose debt was clear
[1:47:29] who is now speaking as adam did in the
[1:47:31] beginning i want you to get it they were
[1:47:34] right
[1:47:34] on the cusp of themselves being changed
[1:47:39] in fact to the matter is paul when he
[1:47:41] preached it he didn't even have in mind
[1:47:43] at seven church ages later he said we
[1:47:46] which are alive and remain
[1:47:54] brothers i show you a mystery
[1:47:58] we shall not all sleep
[1:48:01] they were right on the cusp
[1:48:05] they were on the brink they were about
[1:48:08] to step
[1:48:09] from mortal and immortality
[1:48:13] their their debt of sin was paid they
[1:48:16] had an
[1:48:16] abstract title deed
[1:48:20] i just want to want to go through some
[1:48:22] of this many sick people were healed by
[1:48:25] peter
[1:48:26] the bible said they
[1:48:29] didn't then you find that they would
[1:48:31] arrest them and the apostles were freed
[1:48:34] from prison by angelic intervention
[1:48:39] amen later you know the angels
[1:48:42] angels was common
[1:48:45] come on you say well brother tim we must
[1:48:49] not need angels the bible says that when
[1:48:51] jesus was tempted of the devil that
[1:48:54] angels came and ministered to him
[1:48:59] also at gethsemane for the very thing he
[1:49:02] would have to go through
[1:49:03] angels came and strengthened him for
[1:49:05] gethsemane
[1:49:07] i'd say we still are are ones that need
[1:49:11] not only need but will have angelic
[1:49:14] visitation
[1:49:16] amen because if this is where we're
[1:49:18] standing
[1:49:19] where they were standing then hallelujah
[1:49:23] then angels
[1:49:24] ought to be seen among us and you even
[1:49:26] the common man
[1:49:28] or woman ought to be experiencing
[1:49:31] visitations and brother branham would
[1:49:35] tell you often
[1:49:36] make your house ready for angels to
[1:49:40] visit
[1:49:43] angels attended peter paul other
[1:49:46] disciples
[1:49:48] the bible said that they laid their
[1:49:50] hands on the apostles put them in a
[1:49:52] common prison but the angel
[1:49:54] of the lord came in that night and
[1:49:57] opened the prison doors he can still do
[1:50:00] it for the chinese brothers
[1:50:02] he can still do it for the brothers down
[1:50:04] in iran
[1:50:05] he can still do it for the persecuted
[1:50:07] around the world
[1:50:09] he can even do it for the prison that
[1:50:11] you're in
[1:50:13] whether it's physical or spiritual or
[1:50:15] financial
[1:50:16] or emotional bondage that you're under
[1:50:19] this god
[1:50:20] sends his angels hallelujah i would like
[1:50:23] to inform you there's an angel in the
[1:50:25] pulpit
[1:50:26] a messenger from god telling you you
[1:50:28] don't have to remain in bondage you can
[1:50:31] be free
[1:50:33] amen it's as if it was there standing by
[1:50:36] peter
[1:50:36] when he laid there at night between the
[1:50:38] guards and they were going to make sure
[1:50:40] that he didn't get loose an angel come
[1:50:42] along and tapped him on the side
[1:50:45] and said get up and come with me it
[1:50:48] ought to be today that we could hear
[1:50:50] those words to to everyone that is bound
[1:50:54] for everyone that is afflicted get up
[1:50:57] from there
[1:50:58] your chains are off your debt has been
[1:51:01] paid
[1:51:02] your sins are gone get up and walk with
[1:51:05] me
[1:51:06] and walk out of this prison
[1:51:12] hallelujah amen i
[1:51:16] am telling you that the very reason to
[1:51:19] spear the lord is here
[1:51:20] the spirit of god is upon me he has
[1:51:23] anointed me to preach the gospel
[1:51:25] to set it captive those that are at the
[1:51:28] liberty those that are captive
[1:51:30] amen he had denied it a ministry of
[1:51:33] people in this last day
[1:51:35] that can set you loose from bondage of
[1:51:38] drugs
[1:51:38] a fornication of sin of adultery
[1:51:43] you name any name that you want to i
[1:51:46] want you to tell you there is a jubilee
[1:51:48] trumpet
[1:51:49] that is sounding in this hour and say
[1:51:51] you don't have to remain
[1:51:53] a captive anymore
[1:51:57] but you can be free from depression from
[1:52:01] anxiety
[1:52:02] from the troubles of all that trouble
[1:52:04] you remember because the angel of god
[1:52:07] accompanies this message and the angel
[1:52:10] of god
[1:52:11] is in our midst tapping you on the side
[1:52:14] and saying get up from there get up
[1:52:27] hallelujah it's time you awake like a
[1:52:30] man awaken out of his sleep
[1:52:32] and look around and say angels all
[1:52:35] around us
[1:52:36] a message is coming this day and it's a
[1:52:38] message of deliverance
[1:52:46] hallelujah stephen's great miracles
[1:52:51] stephen began with faith full of faith
[1:52:54] and power
[1:52:55] he was just a deacon they say but he did
[1:52:58] great wonders and miracles among the
[1:53:00] people
[1:53:02] when he was dying he saw a vision
[1:53:06] oh you got these unbelievers today say
[1:53:08] all visions are only for the prophet
[1:53:11] what a lie that is it wasn't in the
[1:53:14] first
[1:53:14] church and it won't be in the last
[1:53:16] church
[1:53:18] not only will angels accompany the
[1:53:20] message
[1:53:21] not only will angels come to strengthen
[1:53:24] but visions and there
[1:53:27] dying stephen has that vision of christ
[1:53:31] it was philip and philip in
[1:53:34] acts 8 that he would cast out an unclean
[1:53:37] spirit
[1:53:38] he went down to samaria and he preached
[1:53:41] christ among them
[1:53:42] i you know i think that's it i mean a
[1:53:44] lot of times we have preached theology
[1:53:46] [Music]
[1:53:49] come on a lot of times we've even
[1:53:51] preached brother branham
[1:53:55] come on and thank god for a prophet
[1:53:58] amen thank god for a messenger amen but
[1:54:02] buddy but peter but philip went down
[1:54:06] and he preached christ unto them
[1:54:10] when he would meet with the eunuch the
[1:54:12] bible said that he opened his bible
[1:54:14] and preached unto them jesus
[1:54:18] i tell you it's time that the message
[1:54:20] believers start
[1:54:21] preaching jesus again and preach about a
[1:54:24] lamb
[1:54:25] that has taken the book and loosed the
[1:54:27] seal and paid your debt
[1:54:30] [Applause]
[1:54:32] i wonder how much of this how much of
[1:54:35] this theology has got us how far has it
[1:54:38] taken us
[1:54:42] people with one accord begin to listen
[1:54:43] to what philip said
[1:54:45] and seeing the miracles he was doing
[1:54:47] because unclean spirits came
[1:54:50] out crying with a loud voice many that
[1:54:53] were possessed
[1:54:55] with them and and many was taken with
[1:54:57] the palsy
[1:54:58] and the lame palsy was the paraplegics
[1:55:03] paralytics and those that were lame were
[1:55:06] healed
[1:55:08] this is what when sons of god were
[1:55:11] operating as
[1:55:12] sons of god this is where they were
[1:55:16] standing on the threshold
[1:55:19] come on i'm telling you this is where
[1:55:22] they were standing this is where we are
[1:55:24] standing
[1:55:26] christ's appearance in the form of a
[1:55:28] light to paul
[1:55:30] at his conversion the bible would tell
[1:55:33] you that
[1:55:33] that this light that he saw he would say
[1:55:36] he would say to paul said saul why
[1:55:39] persecuted thou
[1:55:40] me can you kick against the pricks
[1:55:45] and there there is as he was as he was
[1:55:48] having this conversation
[1:55:50] with this one in the light
[1:55:53] and he said who art thou lord
[1:55:59] come on amen who art thou lord and he
[1:56:02] said i
[1:56:02] am jesus
[1:56:05] that ought to do something to every two
[1:56:07] lord person around the country
[1:56:09] and realize there ain't no two lords
[1:56:11] there's one lord one faith one baptism
[1:56:14] one god one father of us all
[1:56:16] [Music]
[1:56:19] amen where did we get this confusion in
[1:56:21] this day and hour
[1:56:23] it's because the serpent has come to
[1:56:24] defile every
[1:56:30] and paul would say in first corinthians
[1:56:32] 15 and 6
[1:56:34] and he would witness about the 500
[1:56:36] brethren
[1:56:37] that saw jesus i wonder who greater part
[1:56:40] remain unto this present but some have
[1:56:42] fallen asleep
[1:56:44] and after that it was seen of james and
[1:56:47] and then of the apostles
[1:56:50] and last of all he was seen to me
[1:56:55] oh that's one born out of due time
[1:56:59] amen now these could say they saw him
[1:57:03] they saw a physical body they saw him
[1:57:06] when ascended
[1:57:07] there was a cloud took him out of their
[1:57:08] sight
[1:57:10] there was about 500 that witnessed that
[1:57:16] paul talked like they were all saved
[1:57:19] because he said the greater part remain
[1:57:21] unto this present but some have fallen
[1:57:23] asleep
[1:57:25] amen but he said then last he was seen
[1:57:29] of me
[1:57:32] i don't know how you feel this morning
[1:57:34] but we're here in the last race
[1:57:37] and i want to be one of the last ones
[1:57:41] that can say he appeared to me too
[1:57:46] amen that he appeared here and he
[1:57:48] appeared there and he appeared here and
[1:57:49] he appeared there and appeared here and
[1:57:51] he appeared there and appeared to you
[1:57:53] and to you and to you and to you
[1:57:54] [Applause]
[1:57:57] hallelujah and there would be a people
[1:57:59] who loves his appearing
[1:58:02] amen shouldn't there be a church in this
[1:58:05] day and hour
[1:58:06] a congregation of people a bride around
[1:58:09] the world
[1:58:09] who lands for him to appear
[1:58:12] and can say at the last in the last age
[1:58:16] in the last time among the last people
[1:58:20] he appeared to me also
[1:58:22] [Applause]
[1:58:23] he appeared and he changed me amen
[1:58:32] forever
[1:58:35] paul would have a vision at that time
[1:58:39] of ananias there's a different ananias
[1:58:43] ananias would have a vision of him
[1:58:47] think about this paul he's a new convert
[1:58:51] just now gets a vision of ananias
[1:58:56] now he's had a vision of christ now he
[1:58:57] gets a vision of ananias
[1:59:00] and then ananias has a vision of saul
[1:59:05] tells him to go to a certain place
[1:59:09] to street that's called straight there
[1:59:12] and then that there you will meet with
[1:59:15] ananias and paul
[1:59:16] you will meet together and there this
[1:59:19] he will pray for you and the scales will
[1:59:22] fall off your eyes
[1:59:24] so in the new testament church blind
[1:59:26] eyes come open
[1:59:30] hallelujah amen and paul's sight was
[1:59:32] restored
[1:59:33] and immediately the bible said fell from
[1:59:36] his eyes as it been scales
[1:59:38] and they received sight forth with
[1:59:41] paul had a vision he would go from there
[1:59:45] this is one vision of jesus
[1:59:48] where he meets with jesus and he sees
[1:59:51] him second
[1:59:52] well he might not even call it a vision
[1:59:54] maybe it's an experience
[1:59:55] then he comes the next one he has a
[1:59:57] vision of ananias
[1:59:59] and then he goes into the temple into
[2:00:02] jerusalem and he's praying in the temple
[2:00:04] he's this new convert and he said all of
[2:00:06] a sudden i was in a trance
[2:00:09] that word means i was raptured up
[2:00:14] i was pulled into place of ecstasy
[2:00:18] and he said when i did i saw him
[2:00:21] come to me and he said make haste and
[2:00:25] get thee quickly out of jerusalem for
[2:00:27] they will not receive your testimony
[2:00:29] concerning me and he got up right quick
[2:00:33] and he left from there and he said in
[2:00:35] his final words as he was leaving he
[2:00:37] said depart
[2:00:38] for i will send thee for hints unto the
[2:00:41] gentiles
[2:00:44] and little there was
[2:00:47] aneas who was healed of a palsy
[2:00:50] he was a paraplegic or paralytic
[2:00:54] for eight years
[2:00:58] and peter said to him and else jesus
[2:01:01] christ
[2:01:02] maketh thee whole arise and make their
[2:01:05] bed
[2:01:06] i want you to understand words came out
[2:01:08] of a mouth
[2:01:11] spoken word
[2:01:14] oh you think you think third pool was
[2:01:16] just for brother branham
[2:01:18] i want you to understand the spoken word
[2:01:20] would be creative in them

[2:01:25] powerful in the words of in the mouth of
[2:01:28] joshua
[2:01:31] hey man we act like it's some new thing
[2:01:33] this is not something new
[2:01:36] this is something that happens in a
[2:01:38] redeemed church
[2:01:40] this is something that can be expected
[2:01:44] of those who are standing on the edge of
[2:01:46] eternity
[2:01:48] about ready to change from mortal to
[2:01:50] immortality
[2:01:53] those that are at a dispensational
[2:01:55] change
[2:01:58] dorkus she was a believer
[2:02:02] and our name was also tabitha
[2:02:05] she was a woman that was full of good
[2:02:07] works in arms deeds sometimes you don't
[2:02:09] think god sees what you've done
[2:02:12] but he does you can't do one little
[2:02:16] thing for him
[2:02:17] except he acknowledges it you can't sing
[2:02:20] a song about him you young people cannot
[2:02:23] come and celebrate this great event of
[2:02:26] revelation
[2:02:27] 5 and worship god and bless god's people

[2:02:36] and i've come to reward you
[2:02:42] hallelujah amen come on if a woman by
[2:02:46] the name of hagar
[2:02:48] a bomb's woman who would produce an
[2:02:51] off race of the israelites
[2:02:55] and god would take so much concern
[2:02:58] about her till he would come and appear
[2:03:00] to her
[2:03:03] and show her a well or source of water
[2:03:06] for them to drink and give her a word of
[2:03:09] comfort
[2:03:11] and she would say she would name the
[2:03:14] the well of the god who sees me
[2:03:18] i see the church ought to come to that
[2:03:21] well
[2:03:22] amen what a refreshing night is amen
[2:03:25] that you come to a point that you know
[2:03:27] god sees and god cares
[2:03:30] it matters not only by my bonds woman it

[2:03:35] the church
[2:03:36] and driven out god cares and god sees
[2:03:45] darkest or this woman tabitha
[2:03:49] they come to him they show him garments
[2:03:51] and aprons and things and clothing for
[2:03:53] the poor
[2:03:54] and she's made in the armstreet she's
[2:03:56] done
[2:03:57] and peter comes into the room and kneels
[2:04:00] by her bed and prays

[2:04:08] you
[2:04:09] as we have her funeral god and we bury
[2:04:12] her may you be with us and comfort the
[2:04:14] family
[2:04:16] that's not what he did
[2:04:20] he stood on the authority of who he was
[2:04:24] and he called her by name and said
[2:04:26] tabitha i say to thee arise
[2:04:29] and a woman who had been dead opened her
[2:04:32] eyes and sat
[2:04:33] up this is a new testament church
[2:04:38] amen this is a church standing on the
[2:04:41] threshold
[2:04:41] of full redemption with a book open and
[2:04:44] a title
[2:04:50] cleared
[2:04:52] cornelius a centurion has a vision
[2:04:55] now he's a roman but he has a vision
[2:05:00] he's not even christian and he has a
[2:05:04] vision
[2:05:06] and he saw the vision an angel he even
[2:05:09] gets an angelic visitation
[2:05:11] in a vision come on
[2:05:14] and and again the words keep thy prayers
[2:05:18] and their
[2:05:18] arms or come up for memorial before god
[2:05:22] god says i remember what you done for my
[2:05:25] people
[2:05:26] i remember your prayers i heard them i
[2:05:30] take notice of them
[2:05:32] and i'm letting you know i take notice
[2:05:34] of them and i'll tell you what i want
[2:05:36] you to do i want you to send to joppa
[2:05:38] and i want you to call for a man
[2:05:39] by the name of simon whose surname is
[2:05:41] peter and they
[2:05:43] he he lodges in a in a house of one
[2:05:46] called simon the tanner i stood there at
[2:05:48] that house
[2:05:49] a few a couple of years ago now a man
[2:05:52] and there this this is houses by the
[2:05:55] seaside and
[2:05:57] he shall tell thee what you ought to do
[2:06:02] well you know it wasn't just it wasn't
[2:06:05] just cornelius that needed a prompting
[2:06:08] it was old it was old a peter that
[2:06:11] needed a prompting
[2:06:12] you see there was some things that
[2:06:15] wasn't open yet that they hadn't seen in
[2:06:17] the book
[2:06:18] and they didn't understand the mystery
[2:06:20] of the gentiles and the jews being one
[2:06:23] body
[2:06:25] so to them that the the gentiles were
[2:06:28] off-casting they were unclean you were
[2:06:30] talking about
[2:06:31] unclean and or outcasts or are
[2:06:34] prejudiced you didn't eat together you
[2:06:37] didn't touch what they touched you
[2:06:38] didn't
[2:06:39] you didn't speak yet what do you think
[2:06:40] the woman at the well said to jesus
[2:06:42] is it customary for you being a jew to
[2:06:44] talk to me a samaritan
[2:06:46] a woman
[2:06:50] you're not of our race
[2:06:55] prejudice is old it's not a day
[2:06:58] it's not just a problem for today it's
[2:07:01] always been
[2:07:02] because when men's hearts are evil
[2:07:05] there's prejudice and one thinks he's
[2:07:09] better than the other
[2:07:11] and everyone wants to say they are the
[2:07:13] god race
[2:07:15] and nobody else is in part it has
[2:07:17] anything
[2:07:20] so the whites want to be superior and
[2:07:22] then the blacks want to pretend they're
[2:07:24] superior and then the spanish want to
[2:07:26] get on their game and the arabs want to
[2:07:28] get on their game and of course the jews
[2:07:29] have always been on that game
[2:07:37] right amen but i tell you
[2:07:40] when when we talk about another race
[2:07:44] it's called the god race
[2:07:47] [Applause]
[2:07:48] and there's no black and there's no
[2:07:50] white
[2:07:52] amen and even we don't side with black
[2:07:54] and white because they're black or white
[2:07:56] we side with the word every time
[2:08:03] are you with me amen but peter you know
[2:08:07] the book has got to be open to him that
[2:08:10] that has been paid so god
[2:08:11] takes and he says okay peter i want to
[2:08:14] show you something
[2:08:15] that you ain't never seen in the book
[2:08:19] amen because i want you to look
[2:08:22] upon its contents look in here
[2:08:27] and as he watches he sees
[2:08:30] he see he sees a vision now i want you
[2:08:34] to get back to this
[2:08:36] because not just special prophets are
[2:08:40] having visions
[2:08:41] but peter ananias paul cornelius
[2:08:52] and if you're new testament saints it's
[2:08:54] possible for you to have a vision too
[2:09:01] and the next day about noon you know
[2:09:03] cornelius is nearing
[2:09:06] joppa taking him a while to get there
[2:09:09] and peter
[2:09:09] he goes up on the flat roof and he's
[2:09:11] hungry he wanted to eat
[2:09:13] so they were preparing some lunch and he
[2:09:16] lays back
[2:09:17] down and just kind of drops off and
[2:09:20] and as he does he falls into trance
[2:09:23] into an ecstasy a vision
[2:09:27] and he enters into another realm
[2:09:30] and in this realm as this heavenly realm
[2:09:32] opens
[2:09:34] he sees there's something resembling a
[2:09:36] large
[2:09:38] linen tablecloth and it's being let down
[2:09:41] to the earth by four corners and as it
[2:09:43] floats down from the heavens
[2:09:45] it holds many kinds of four-footed
[2:09:47] beasts and
[2:09:48] reptiles and wild birds
[2:09:52] so there's all kinds of things creatures
[2:09:55] that are crawling around there and the
[2:09:57] voice says to him
[2:09:58] peter arise go and prepare them to be
[2:10:01] eaten
[2:10:03] he argues he argues with the voice he
[2:10:05] said i
[2:10:06] i can't do that lord
[2:10:10] for i've never eaten anything forbidden
[2:10:12] or impure according to our jewish
[2:10:14] loss and the voice spoke again and said
[2:10:17] nothing is unclean if god declares it to
[2:10:20] be clean
[2:10:24] amen and and he said the vision now
[2:10:26] repeats through
[2:10:28] three times and suddenly the linen sheet
[2:10:31] snatched back up into heaven
[2:10:33] and he's he's stunned by the vision he's
[2:10:35] wondering what it means
[2:10:36] and three no three men are standing at
[2:10:38] his door knocking
[2:10:41] three times three men
[2:10:45] amen and you know he finds out and then
[2:10:48] he hears cornelius saying
[2:10:50] an angel visited me this is what he said
[2:10:54] and he sent me to your house to the
[2:10:56] house of one simon the tanner
[2:10:58] to find simon also called peter
[2:11:03] and peter began to tell him the way of
[2:11:06] life
[2:11:07] and did anybody ever read that in the
[2:11:09] bible
[2:11:10] while peter spake these words the holy
[2:11:13] ghost fell upon them
[2:11:16] that heard it words came out of their
[2:11:20] mouth
[2:11:20] spoken word
[2:11:26] there would be a man by the name of
[2:11:28] agabus
[2:11:30] and the bible said in acts 11 27
[2:11:34] that in these days came prophets not a
[2:11:37] prophet
[2:11:39] prophets from jerusalem unto antioch now
[2:11:43] we
[2:11:43] understand there's only one prophet
[2:11:45] messenger to an age
[2:11:47] amen but here in the new testament they
[2:11:50] had
[2:11:50] prophets
[2:11:53] and there stood a man one of them by the
[2:11:56] name of
[2:11:56] agabus and he's signified by the spirit
[2:11:58] to be a great dearth
[2:12:00] throughout all the world which came to
[2:12:02] pass in the days of claudius
[2:12:04] and actually the believers was prepared
[2:12:07] and stored up some food and provided and
[2:12:09] took care of those that was in the time
[2:12:11] of drought
[2:12:12] because of a man prophesying there were
[2:12:15] prophecies
[2:12:17] in the new testament church when the
[2:12:20] book
[2:12:20] is handed to man and the title is clear
[2:12:25] and they become inheritors of the
[2:12:27] promise
[2:12:28] there's prophecies and prophets
[2:12:34] amen there's peter and so we already
[2:12:37] preached got released by
[2:12:38] uh by angelic and uh you know
[2:12:41] intervention
[2:12:42] and then god brought vengeance upon
[2:12:45] herod
[2:12:45] because just a few days after that he
[2:12:48] dressed up in his pomp and his
[2:12:50] great apparel and and and began to gave
[2:12:53] a speech and he
[2:12:54] began to cry out this is not a man
[2:12:56] there's a god and something struck him
[2:13:02] and he died right there and crumbled
[2:13:03] right in front of maul
[2:13:05] god brought justice sometimes god brings
[2:13:08] justice fast
[2:13:10] sometimes he waits until the eternal
[2:13:13] judgment
[2:13:14] but he always judges your sins will find
[2:13:17] you out
[2:13:19] unless you have a kinsmen
[2:13:24] amen now there was again
[2:13:27] again you know that the different ones
[2:13:30] that
[2:13:30] like a lame man that was cured by paul
[2:13:33] and lystra
[2:13:34] paul and barnabas encountered a man that
[2:13:36] was
[2:13:37] that was born from birth he had never
[2:13:40] walked and he was crippled in his feet
[2:13:43] and as he listened to what paul preached
[2:13:46] as he started hearing the word all of a
[2:13:48] sudden
[2:13:50] paul discerned that this man had faith
[2:13:52] to be healed
[2:13:54] and he said he just shout out you
[2:13:58] in the name of jesus christ get up and
[2:14:00] walk
[2:14:01] and the man jumped to his feet and for
[2:14:03] the first time in his life
[2:14:05] he walked this is what happens
[2:14:09] in a church whose book the seals are off
[2:14:15] whose debts are cleared you know what
[2:14:18] happened
[2:14:18] this made the people there want to
[2:14:20] worship paul and the heathen priests
[2:14:22] wanted to offer
[2:14:23] sacrifices to him so they got bulls and
[2:14:25] they brought them down into there and
[2:14:27] they put around their horn wreaths and
[2:14:28] whatever
[2:14:29] and they were making this big
[2:14:30] celebration because they said god
[2:14:33] has come down jupiter has come down and
[2:14:35] he's here and this one and that one and
[2:14:37] we're gonna
[2:14:37] we're gonna sacrifice these bulls to
[2:14:39] them and and
[2:14:41] they they stood there and persuaded them
[2:14:44] we are not gods we are just men
[2:14:48] and once they got them persuaded that
[2:14:50] they were only men they stoned them
[2:14:54] and left palford dead and
[2:14:57] drug his body out of the city
[2:15:00] and left him there laying there dead but
[2:15:03] that ain't the end of the story
[2:15:05] the believers came and gathered around
[2:15:07] him and when they gathered around him
[2:15:10] he got up and went into the city
[2:15:12] [Music]
[2:15:15] a dead man came back to life paul was
[2:15:22] going down
[2:15:24] in one city and there was a young slave
[2:15:27] girl that had a spirit of divination
[2:15:31] some say it was a spirit of a python it
[2:15:33] was a snake
[2:15:34] it was a god that they worshipped and
[2:15:37] she made great profits for her owners by
[2:15:40] being a fortune teller
[2:15:43] she could get some things right i'll
[2:15:45] tell you that because she went falling
[2:15:47] along behind him shouting these men
[2:15:50] are servants of the great high god and
[2:15:52] they're telling us how to be saved
[2:15:56] and so you know day after day you know
[2:15:58] she continued to do this
[2:16:01] now in a new testament church it isn't
[2:16:05] men who just in their flesh
[2:16:08] but it's men who allow the spirit
[2:16:12] to speak out of them
[2:16:15] notice it was never peter saying oh now
[2:16:17] i feel sorry for you
[2:16:19] i'm going to say rise up and walk it was
[2:16:22] the spirit speaking out
[2:16:25] it meant them not operating with human
[2:16:27] compassion
[2:16:28] but them operating in sons of god
[2:16:32] knowing what god wanted done with his
[2:16:34] word
[2:16:36] somebody with me and my brother branham
[2:16:38] would preach this whole thing
[2:16:39] this whole thought and paul a prisoner
[2:16:41] of christ
[2:16:43] said he was a prisoner he said he wanted
[2:16:45] to he wanted to
[2:16:46] to cast that devil down he was grieved
[2:16:48] about it for many many days
[2:16:53] until one day
[2:16:57] paul so was so annoyed and the spirit of
[2:17:00] god moved in him
[2:17:02] and he turned and said to the spirit and
[2:17:04] dwell in her and said i command you in
[2:17:06] the name of jesus christ
[2:17:08] to come out of her now and at that
[2:17:10] moment the spirit came out of her
[2:17:16] well you know the men that that owned a
[2:17:19] slave girl wasn't happy
[2:17:21] because their money their money
[2:17:24] scheme was gone
[2:17:27] and so they brought great persecution
[2:17:29] upon paul and caused his arrest and
[2:17:31] different things
[2:17:34] he's going down to damascus and again a
[2:17:37] vision
[2:17:38] appears to paul by night and said don't
[2:17:41] go where you're thinking of going
[2:17:43] but he gives him what we call now the
[2:17:45] macedonian call
[2:17:47] and he said there stood a man from
[2:17:49] macedonia before him and prayed him
[2:17:51] saying
[2:17:52] come over into macedonia's and help us
[2:17:57] and so you know they they go over into
[2:17:59] macedonia and they find
[2:18:01] much seed in the place there again
[2:18:05] you know they get arrested and rather
[2:18:07] than being down and out about it they
[2:18:09] take the opportunity to praise god for
[2:18:11] his goodness
[2:18:12] and they begin to sing and they begin to
[2:18:14] praise god in the jailhouse
[2:18:17] their feet are in stocks and they've
[2:18:19] been whipped and beaten
[2:18:21] and they're thrown down in the bottom of
[2:18:23] the of the cell and
[2:18:24] they're laid there and all of a sudden
[2:18:27] an earthquake comes
[2:18:30] and it takes off their bio their their
[2:18:33] their
[2:18:33] bonds and they get up and they walk
[2:18:37] and you know what it does it brings
[2:18:38] about the salvation of the jailer
[2:18:41] who was about to take his life because
[2:18:43] he would be accountable for these men
[2:18:48] and him and his house were saved god
[2:18:51] knows how to get
[2:18:52] them
[2:18:55] and then of course there would be cyprus
[2:18:58] the ruler of the
[2:18:59] of the synagogue he was the chief ruler
[2:19:02] he believed on the lord and many
[2:19:04] corinthians believed and
[2:19:06] then the the lord spoke to paul
[2:19:09] by night by vision notice again vision
[2:19:13] be not afraid but speak and hold not
[2:19:15] their peace for i am with thee
[2:19:17] and no man shall set on thee to hurt you
[2:19:19] for i have much people in this city
[2:19:21] here he comes and said now you stay here
[2:19:23] and just preach i'm going to take care
[2:19:25] of you
[2:19:26] no man's going to harm you because i got
[2:19:29] a lot of elect in this city
[2:19:32] oh brother we don't have to fear when
[2:19:35] when we know god's with us
[2:19:36] we're in the will of god somebody help
[2:19:38] me preach now
[2:19:40] there in acts 19 he finds there a group
[2:19:43] of people
[2:19:44] who who have heard about the way but yet
[2:19:47] have never
[2:19:48] been baptized in the name of jesus
[2:19:50] christ
[2:19:51] and he tells them to be baptized over
[2:19:53] again to receive the holy ghost
[2:19:55] and they spake in tongues and prophesied
[2:19:59] i want you to understand this was
[2:20:00] response of those
[2:20:02] whose names were cleared
[2:20:09] special miracles would come by the hands
[2:20:11] of paul
[2:20:13] god wrought by spirit special miracles
[2:20:15] by the hands of paul
[2:20:18] so he took from his body handkerchiefs
[2:20:22] or aprons and diseases departed out of
[2:20:25] them
[2:20:26] and evil spirits fled
[2:20:30] look at this this is where a man
[2:20:33] standing here they're standing on the
[2:20:36] brink
[2:20:36] of full redemption
[2:20:41] there would be seven sons of skeva
[2:20:44] that would come and try to use the name
[2:20:47] of jesus as if it was magic
[2:20:49] they get showed up
[2:20:52] they get whipped by the demons
[2:20:56] amen but what did it do it vindicated
[2:20:58] paul
[2:20:59] they realized that paul had the right
[2:21:02] and the authority to use that name
[2:21:05] amen and truest it was euducus you know
[2:21:08] he
[2:21:08] he was like a lot of young boys except
[2:21:10] you know he kind of was sleeping in the
[2:21:12] wrong place
[2:21:13] he was in a window in the third loft and
[2:21:16] brother tim i mean brother paul got to
[2:21:18] preach in a long time
[2:21:22] and he preached past midnight oh
[2:21:25] hallelujah maybe i'll do it
[2:21:28] and he preached for past midnight and
[2:21:31] when he did you know he just overcome
[2:21:33] uticas and he
[2:21:34] he falls and trotters out and falls
[2:21:36] there on the ground
[2:21:38] dead
[2:21:42] but it didn't stop the church
[2:21:46] neither did they can turn and point
[2:21:48] fingers at a guy
[2:21:50] because he had a human weakness
[2:21:54] come on i'm giving some mercy for some
[2:21:56] of you that's already went to sleep on
[2:21:58] me this morning
[2:22:00] am i may may god perform
[2:22:03] the most sacred right today
[2:22:07] that's in the church by us just saying
[2:22:11] arise
[2:22:16] and this is what paul did
[2:22:21] and paul went down and prayed for uticus
[2:22:24] and raised him up
[2:22:26] and went back and preached to daylight
[2:22:29] i'd say after raising the dead you could
[2:22:31] have license to preach the daylight
[2:22:34] i wouldn't want to leave that service
[2:22:36] with you
[2:22:37] [Applause]
[2:22:39] amen there would be paul he would go
[2:22:44] to then journeying toward um jerusalem
[2:22:48] and everywhere that he met believers in
[2:22:50] every city and i want you to notice
[2:22:52] every church has this every city
[2:22:56] the holy ghost would witness in every
[2:23:00] city
[2:23:01] the and saying that bonds and
[2:23:03] afflictions waste you paul
[2:23:05] you see prophecy was in every church
[2:23:08] hello
[2:23:10] believers around the world
[2:23:13] amen i wonder what we're missing
[2:23:16] when we're supposed to be at the brink
[2:23:18] of the edge of eternity
[2:23:22] and there again you see you know
[2:23:25] there was prophecy at every church it
[2:23:27] comes down to caesarea
[2:23:28] and it comes to the house of philip the
[2:23:31] of an evangelist
[2:23:32] and guess what he has four daughters who
[2:23:34] prophesied
[2:23:38] so the spirit of god was moving on men
[2:23:40] and women
[2:23:42] it's not just men alone somebody helped
[2:23:44] me preach
[2:23:46] amen and then of good then then of
[2:23:48] course
[2:23:49] you know as he goes on in jerusalem you
[2:23:52] know the
[2:23:53] the the lord speaks to him and says be a
[2:23:55] good cheer paul
[2:23:57] for thou has testified to me jerusalem
[2:24:00] you must bear witness at rome
[2:24:03] is that right well he needs to get to
[2:24:06] rome
[2:24:07] and you know they ain't delta to get on
[2:24:13] there's got to be a ship that he's
[2:24:14] getting on
[2:24:16] is that right amen so you know what they
[2:24:19] they arrest him they arrest him and he
[2:24:22] appeals to
[2:24:24] caesar and god god
[2:24:27] gives paul an all-expense paid
[2:24:30] trip to rome by the roman government
[2:24:38] guaranteeing his safety there
[2:24:41] somebody help me preach amen because god
[2:24:44] said
[2:24:45] you will witness as you witness to me
[2:24:47] for me and jerusalem
[2:24:49] you will also witness for me in rome
[2:24:53] so now paul knows that no matter what he
[2:24:56] faces on the journey
[2:24:58] no matter the shipwrecks that's going to
[2:25:00] come in the way
[2:25:01] he's going to make it to rome because
[2:25:04] god said you're going to witness
[2:25:06] in rome and god said
[2:25:09] you're going to make it to a rapture
[2:25:17] hallelujah amen and you know that
[2:25:20] nothing between here and there
[2:25:22] is going to stop you no shipwreck no
[2:25:25] problem
[2:25:26] no problem too great no situation too
[2:25:29] hard
[2:25:30] nothing that you're going through is
[2:25:31] going to stop you because you have been
[2:25:33] predestinated
[2:25:35] on a journey
[2:25:39] oh hallelujah hallelujah of people
[2:25:43] predestinated my journey
[2:25:47] and they ain't enough devils that can
[2:25:49] get in the storm
[2:25:50] they ain't enough devils can get in the
[2:25:52] government and there ain't enough devil
[2:25:54] that can stop you from getting where
[2:25:56] you're going because you have been
[2:25:58] ordained
[2:25:59] to go there blessed be the name of the
[2:26:03] lord
[2:26:04] and nothing can stop you because ain't
[2:26:06] nothing big enough
[2:26:07] because there is nothing bigger than
[2:26:09] your god
[2:26:19] paul will be put on a ship to rome and
[2:26:21] he will warn them don't go any further
[2:26:24] because there's a a storm coming and for
[2:26:27] friend
[2:26:28] and they won't listen to him and for 14
[2:26:31] days they are driven by the storm they
[2:26:34] have given up
[2:26:35] they have lightened the load they have
[2:26:37] thrown everything over but the men that
[2:26:39] was on there
[2:26:40] and there happened to be 276 men
[2:26:44] on that boat and paul
[2:26:47] gets down to that place now he also says
[2:26:50] you know he also knows that he has been
[2:26:53] sent to rome
[2:26:55] and the angel of god comes and stands
[2:26:58] beside him and he said now
[2:26:59] paul don't fear because you must stand
[2:27:03] trial before caesar but not only that
[2:27:07] but
[2:27:07] god has graciously given you all the men
[2:27:11] who sailed with you
[2:27:14] now that was an incredible thing to say
[2:27:17] 14 days in a northeastern also called a
[2:27:20] hurricane
[2:27:21] driven day after day after day where
[2:27:24] they couldn't tell
[2:27:25] day from night where they had they had
[2:27:28] unloaded the ship but god said there
[2:27:30] ain't going to be
[2:27:31] one on the ship lost
[2:27:36] and i'm telling you we're going on this
[2:27:38] journey
[2:27:39] we're taking our loved ones we're taking
[2:27:41] our children
[2:27:43] mean we're taking all and we got a word
[2:27:45] from god that said we're going
[2:27:47] and there ain't going to be one loss
[2:27:50] we're going to have them all we're
[2:27:51] taking our mother our brother our sister
[2:27:53] our husband our wife
[2:27:54] we're taking every one of them it's a
[2:27:56] journey
[2:27:58] a predestinated journey
[2:28:06] well it wasn't enough for him to be
[2:28:07] saved
[2:28:09] for him to cling day and night now onto
[2:28:12] a
[2:28:12] a a staffer master the ship
[2:28:16] just a piece and it's all broken up
[2:28:19] they're driven on this island
[2:28:22] but the villagers and the people of that
[2:28:24] island was gracious and built them a
[2:28:26] fire to warm themselves because it was
[2:28:28] cold and
[2:28:29] paul decided to help out and he went and
[2:28:31] gathered some branches too
[2:28:33] and he was bitten by a viper
[2:28:37] but you see he had already been told
[2:28:41] you're gonna witness to me for me in
[2:28:44] rome
[2:28:45] be of good cheer so instead of getting
[2:28:48] excited
[2:28:49] he shook it off in the fire
[2:28:52] and i'm telling you friends whatever
[2:28:54] your opposition
[2:28:55] is today don't get excited
[2:28:59] just shake it off in the fire shake off
[2:29:02] that depression
[2:29:04] shake off that unbelief shake off all of
[2:29:06] those doubts
[2:29:08] shake off all that sin that would so
[2:29:10] easily beset you
[2:29:11] amen you have been told you were witness
[2:29:15] amen we are part of a rapture we're
[2:29:17] standing on the brink of eternity
[2:29:23] well the governor of that
[2:29:26] island his name was publis he had a
[2:29:29] state nearby
[2:29:31] he welcomed the men because now they
[2:29:34] thought he was instead of some
[2:29:36] criminal that had met his fate they
[2:29:38] believed that he was a
[2:29:40] that that he was uh uh you know a man of
[2:29:44] god
[2:29:45] and so now they're they're bringing him
[2:29:47] sickness and different ones
[2:29:48] and he becomes a house guest to publish
[2:29:51] the governor
[2:29:53] and they showed him hospitality and his
[2:29:56] father
[2:29:56] was laying there in the sick bed
[2:29:58] suffering from fits of
[2:30:00] high fever and dysentery and paul went
[2:30:04] into his room
[2:30:05] and after praying he placed his hands on
[2:30:07] him he was instantly healed
[2:30:09] and when the people of the island heard
[2:30:11] about this miracle
[2:30:12] they brought all the sick to paul and
[2:30:14] they were healed also
[2:30:17] that ought to be the response when we
[2:30:19] hear that god heals one
[2:30:21] then we know he's going to heal me too
[2:30:24] because god is no
[2:30:25] he he doesn't show any preference come
[2:30:28] on he's no respected person
[2:30:31] so therefore he will not give you a
[2:30:33] cookie and then refuse to
[2:30:34] another child something somebody help me
[2:30:37] amen but he provides it all
[2:30:39] if he provided healing for one he
[2:30:41] provides healing for another if he
[2:30:43] provides salvation for one
[2:30:44] he provides salvation for another
[2:30:48] if you say my children he'll save yours
[2:30:50] too
[2:30:52] and you ought to get excited about
[2:30:54] seeing what god's doing
[2:30:56] because you know you're standing in line
[2:30:58] for your turn to come
[2:31:03] but i want to say not only were there
[2:31:06] miracles and visions and healing and
[2:31:08] voices and tongues and prophecy
[2:31:11] but the word of the book was open to
[2:31:13] them
[2:31:15] they separated law from grace they saw
[2:31:18] circumcision in the sabbath as types and
[2:31:21] recognized their spiritual fulfillments
[2:31:24] therefore they worshipped on sunday
[2:31:26] because it was the day of the sheep
[2:31:28] waving
[2:31:29] when jesus rose from the dead and they
[2:31:32] honored god on the resurrection
[2:31:36] they knew the mystery of israel in the
[2:31:38] gentiles
[2:31:39] revealing the mystery of the new
[2:31:40] testament church as one body
[2:31:42] composed by both of jews and gentiles
[2:31:46] and and that we who were gentiles we
[2:31:49] learned
[2:31:49] from the open book that we
[2:31:53] also were abraham's seed by being born
[2:31:57] of christ
[2:31:59] and paul would say you see us not to
[2:32:01] seeds
[2:32:02] but to seed and that seed
[2:32:05] was not isaac but that seed was christ
[2:32:09] and if you're born of christ you are
[2:32:12] abraham's seed
[2:32:14] and heirs of abraham according to the
[2:32:16] promise
[2:32:17] which means your seed will possess the
[2:32:20] gate of his enemy
[2:32:22] hallelujah that nothing not even the
[2:32:24] gates of hell can prevail against you
[2:32:26] because you are the royal seed of
[2:32:28] abraham
[2:32:31] they looked in that great book
[2:32:35] of inheritance
[2:32:38] and with the book unsealed paul can look
[2:32:41] and say
[2:32:43] now for them he did for
[2:32:46] know he did also mark out his copies of
[2:32:50] himself
[2:32:54] that they might be the firstborn that he
[2:32:56] might be the firstborn among many
[2:32:58] brethren
[2:33:01] and those that he called he justified
[2:33:05] and those that he's justified he's
[2:33:08] already
[2:33:09] glorified
[2:33:12] [Music]
[2:33:13] so paul says you're already there
[2:33:15] glorified in his presence
[2:33:18] your sins are gone it is though you
[2:33:22] never did it in the first place
[2:33:26] and it's really not as it as a popular
[2:33:28] saying is just
[2:33:29] if i had never but it is
[2:33:33] you never did it
[2:33:41] in the first place where is the first
[2:33:45] place
[2:33:46] you know your life you know your
[2:33:48] troubles you know what you've been
[2:33:50] through
[2:33:50] but i'm telling you when god declares
[2:33:53] you justified
[2:33:54] when he takes the bleach of his blood
[2:33:57] and puts upon you
[2:33:58] he traces it all the way back to the
[2:34:01] beginning
[2:34:02] and he says little child in my mind
[2:34:06] in my thinking in the first place
[2:34:09] you never did it
[2:34:14] and he takes it and he lays it on your
[2:34:17] adversary the devil
[2:34:19] and you are free delivered
[2:34:23] a son of god staying in his presence
[2:34:27] without spider blemish heaven never did
[2:34:30] it
[2:34:31] in his thinking
[2:34:40] chosen let's go over your neighbor and
[2:34:43] say
[2:34:43] chosen chosen
[2:34:47] and guess what he's not a fickle being
[2:34:50] that can change his mind about you
[2:34:55] and you can't go along and make some
[2:34:57] mistake
[2:34:58] and him decide to unchoose you
[2:35:08] you know it's kind of like some
[2:35:10] grandparents didn't want to hold a
[2:35:11] grandchild
[2:35:12] and said you know i i if you'll do this
[2:35:14] for me and that and this and that and
[2:35:16] you'll be my favorite you know i i i'll
[2:35:19] leave you
[2:35:19] a good inheritance
[2:35:22] but god says no that ain't the way i do
[2:35:25] it
[2:35:27] i chose you and there's nothing you can
[2:35:29] do to unchoose yourself
[2:35:34] therefore he said neither height nor
[2:35:36] death nor nor principality or power
[2:35:39] there is nothing that can ever separate
[2:35:41] you from the love of god in christ jesus
[2:35:47] and he said who is he that condemneth
[2:35:49] certainly not me
[2:35:50] is not christ it's the adversary he
[2:35:54] condemns but not me
[2:35:56] and whom i say is justified is justified
[2:36:00] who i declare as righteous is righteous
[2:36:03] because you
[2:36:04] never did it in the first place
[2:36:09] therefore you stand justified
[2:36:12] in his sight
[2:36:18] they recognize there was one god and
[2:36:20] that one god created the earth
[2:36:24] and he come down in the body of flesh
[2:36:26] called the sun
[2:36:28] the father became his own son the son
[2:36:32] couldn't be his own father
[2:36:33] but the father created him a body and
[2:36:35] therefore became the son
[2:36:40] and all the fullness of god was in that
[2:36:42] body
[2:36:44] and the mystery of christ is the
[2:36:46] incarnate fullness of the godhead bodily
[2:36:48] was in that book and they would see that
[2:36:52] the jehovah of the old testament
[2:36:54] is the jesus of the new
[2:36:57] the book was not sealed they understood
[2:37:01] the mystery then of the church as the
[2:37:03] bride of christ
[2:37:05] that she was a wife to the bridegroom
[2:37:08] they recognized the blood of bulls and
[2:37:10] goats would never
[2:37:11] remit sins but only the blood
[2:37:14] of jesus the lamb and they accepted his
[2:37:18] blood as atonement
[2:37:20] and it was needless now to worship and
[2:37:22] offer
[2:37:23] thousands upon thousands of innocent
[2:37:25] lambs
[2:37:26] because their blood would mean nothin
[2:37:31] thus they recognize long before luther
[2:37:34] that the just shall live by faith
[2:37:38] they believed in a holy life of modest
[2:37:42] apparel
[2:37:43] and that men were to cut their hair and
[2:37:45] women were to have theirs long
[2:37:48] this was in the book
[2:37:52] they preached against sexual immorality
[2:37:55] that only in marriage was it honorable
[2:37:58] so they taught marriage between a male
[2:38:00] and a female
[2:38:01] and that homosexual activity was sinful
[2:38:10] they preached the mystery of the
[2:38:12] translation of the living
[2:38:14] saints at the end time they recognized
[2:38:17] the rapture was imminent
[2:38:19] and that jesus would descend from heaven
[2:38:21] with a shout with the voice of an
[2:38:23] archangel with the drum of god and the
[2:38:25] dead of christ would rise first
[2:38:27] they wouldn't be left out but they would
[2:38:28] rise first
[2:38:31] they didn't need the seals opened
[2:38:35] the book wasn't sealed there was no
[2:38:39] seals on the book they were preaching
[2:38:40] from an open book
[2:38:43] the mysteries were known the message of
[2:38:46] the end time to return back
[2:38:48] to the feast of pentecost for an
[2:38:50] outpouring on on high
[2:38:52] they you know that's the that's the
[2:38:54] message
[2:38:55] the message would be we got to return
[2:38:57] back
[2:38:58] to where they were not to something
[2:39:00] different from what they were
[2:39:02] you say well brother tim we got
[2:39:04] something different we got the seals
[2:39:06] listen to seals only opened up what paul
[2:39:09] preached
[2:39:11] when brother branham went beyond the
[2:39:12] curtain of time they said
[2:39:14] he they he testified i preached what
[2:39:17] paul preached
[2:39:19] whatever he preached i preached that
[2:39:21] they said we know that
[2:39:29] and we're resting on that and you can
[2:39:32] rest on it today
[2:39:34] that the message that we believe is what
[2:39:36] paul preached
[2:39:39] because it's a raptured message and
[2:39:42] there is no greater message than the new
[2:39:44] testament gospel message
[2:39:46] and that message must be preached in the
[2:39:49] end times so that the end of the world
[2:39:51] can come
[2:39:52] and it could not be preached that way
[2:39:53] with the seals on the book
[2:39:56] brother branham and souls in prison now
[2:39:58] he made it very clear and he said you
[2:40:00] see
[2:40:00] the seals only declared it for the new
[2:40:03] testament
[2:40:04] not for the old and the reason for that
[2:40:07] is because the old testament debt was
[2:40:09] paid
[2:40:12] and the believers they were given an
[2:40:14] abstract
[2:40:16] but we in this day because that sin
[2:40:19] entered back in the picture
[2:40:20] and the second eve sowed her skirts of
[2:40:23] purity
[2:40:23] as paul said they would do he said i
[2:40:26] fear that as the serpent beguiled eve so
[2:40:30] will
[2:40:30] so will he beguile you in his subtility
[2:40:36] and he began to little by little pulled
[2:40:38] him away
[2:40:40] and it was revealed when it was opened
[2:40:42] up now what they didn't know they didn't
[2:40:44] know there would be seven ages but they
[2:40:48] didn't need to know
[2:40:49] that there would be seven ages god hid
[2:40:51] that from them
[2:40:53] amen that was for your benefit
[2:40:56] that god knew you were coming
[2:41:00] so therefore he waited there as the
[2:41:02] intercessor waiting
[2:41:03] interceding for every age for every one
[2:41:06] of it because he's a kinsmen for every
[2:41:08] age
[2:41:09] and when he comes down to the last day
[2:41:11] what does he do he takes the book and
[2:41:13] looses its seals
[2:41:16] so that the very thing that the early
[2:41:18] church had we have again
[2:41:22] that in that book not only are doctrines
[2:41:25] but there is
[2:41:26] there is power with that doctrine it's
[2:41:29] not just a theology
[2:41:31] it's a word a life-changing word a
[2:41:34] powerful word that heals the sick that
[2:41:36] raises the dead that casts out devils
[2:41:40] that speaks and things happen where sons
[2:41:43] of god are
[2:41:44] led by the spirit of god
[2:41:50] there were miracles coming from this
[2:41:51] open book
[2:41:53] the power of the spoken word was
[2:41:55] happening
[2:41:57] but sadly
[2:42:01] as the servant beguiled eve so did the
[2:42:03] servant beguile the early church
[2:42:06] and the book became close to man the
[2:42:12] seal
[2:42:13] the first seal was a white horse looked
[2:42:16] like christ it was so
[2:42:17] such an insidious spirit such a deceiver
[2:42:21] that it went forth conquering and to
[2:42:23] conquer it had an ambition to take over
[2:42:25] the church
[2:42:30] when it ran out of of its power to do
[2:42:33] that
[2:42:35] it morphed into a red horse
[2:42:38] got the power of state behind it and
[2:42:40] with the sword begin to kill
[2:42:41] millions and begin to wipe out the true
[2:42:44] seed
[2:42:46] those were the real revelation men and
[2:42:49] women went down and
[2:42:51] children went down into death
[2:42:54] and that sword bloodied that white horse
[2:42:57] until it became red
[2:43:01] and further sealed the book
[2:43:06] it comes on down on down
[2:43:09] on down
[2:43:12] until our day
[2:43:19] and in our day there's a messenger on
[2:43:22] earth
[2:43:27] can we look back at revelation 5 as we
[2:43:30] come to close this morning i'm trying
[2:43:33] but i'm getting now to the crux of my
[2:43:35] message
[2:43:38] because i want you to see where we're
[2:43:39] standing
[2:43:41] that we're standing on the threshold
[2:43:44] of full redemption
[2:43:51] and i think it is verse 3 that says
[2:43:57] and i heard a strong angel
[2:44:01] saying who is worthy what verse is that
[2:44:04] we can read it all if we need to but
[2:44:07] verse 2
[2:44:09] in the second verse and i saw a strong
[2:44:12] angel
[2:44:13] he was a mighty messenger and this
[2:44:16] messenger began to proclaim
[2:44:19] he began to preach a message with a loud
[2:44:22] voice
[2:44:24] saying who is worthy to open the book
[2:44:26] this book
[2:44:27] must be opened amen you
[2:44:32] see it became the cry of the seventh
[2:44:34] angel
[2:44:36] it was his ministry it was his message
[2:44:38] it wasn't all roberts who was saying
[2:44:40] who's worthy
[2:44:41] oh his seals have got to be open it
[2:44:44] wasn't it wasn't billy graham
[2:44:46] come on it was another them it was the
[2:44:48] seventh angel
[2:44:50] a mighty angel and he began to cry out
[2:44:53] with a loud voice who is worthy that's
[2:44:55] got to come this time
[2:44:57] the book has got to be opened to an end
[2:44:59] time people it's got to come
[2:45:02] that we'll know what the seven thunders
[2:45:04] are
[2:45:05] amen the voices there that have been
[2:45:08] sealed up that hold the mystery of those
[2:45:10] seven seals
[2:45:12] we got to know this it's rapture now or
[2:45:15] it's the last days it's the last time
[2:45:17] who is worthy we i i've looked in
[2:45:19] denominations and ain't none of them
[2:45:21] worthy i looked at these great men
[2:45:24] ain't none of them worthy
[2:45:28] who is worthy to open the book and to
[2:45:31] loosen the seals
[2:45:34] and as he as that cry went out to the
[2:45:38] earth
[2:45:39] there was a response started happening
[2:45:41] in heaven i want you to know
[2:45:42] heaven has moved in our generation
[2:45:46] i want you to understand an angel the
[2:45:49] pillar of fire would accompany this
[2:45:51] man's birth
[2:45:52] actually the holy spirit start breaking
[2:45:55] in the supernatural realm
[2:45:57] greater than any other age except the
[2:46:00] first age in the azusa movement
[2:46:03] a lot of people mock them and make fun
[2:46:05] of them but i want you to understand
[2:46:06] they were genuine christians they spoke
[2:46:10] in genuine tongues not this rattly stuff
[2:46:12] that somebody beats you on the head and
[2:46:14] makes you say and jabbers your cheeks do
[2:46:16] you say something
[2:46:18] but real tongues prophecies healing
[2:46:21] supernatural begin to happen an angel
[2:46:24] will appear
[2:46:26] pillar of fire over a crib
[2:46:29] there a light and a young man would be
[2:46:32] destined would hear voice of an angel
[2:46:35] saying
[2:46:36] don't smoke drink defile your body i've
[2:46:38] got to work for you to do when you're
[2:46:39] older
[2:46:41] god would begin to hover over and watch
[2:46:43] that gift
[2:46:44] and bring it through all kinds of things
[2:46:46] he would train this man in different
[2:46:48] ways
[2:46:50] you know a word that he would learn you
[2:46:52] don't listen to the great preachers you
[2:46:54] don't obey them you obey me
[2:46:56] he would catch an amoeba down in africa
[2:46:59] in south africa because
[2:47:00] he listened to man instead of god
[2:47:04] he would go through all of these
[2:47:05] different things that he would
[2:47:07] he would have to endure he would lose
[2:47:09] his wife and his little child to teach
[2:47:12] them
[2:47:12] you don't even follow after your mother
[2:47:14] or mother-in-law or
[2:47:15] relatives or nobody you got to follow me
[2:47:19] it was all a part of his training and he
[2:47:22] began to cry out
[2:47:24] from his earliest change who is were
[2:47:26] they
[2:47:27] to take the book these seals must be
[2:47:32] opened
[2:47:36] heaven would open and seven angels would
[2:47:38] step out of it powerful angels
[2:47:41] catch him up in the midst of it it would
[2:47:43] be shown that
[2:47:45] it was shown and displayed the picture
[2:47:46] of christ over arizona
[2:47:48] you know that that full run that time
[2:47:51] and there
[2:47:52] he would he would it would be shown
[2:47:54] there told him go back to the east

[2:48:00] book of acts
[2:48:03] go back to the east and preach the seven
[2:48:05] seals will be open to you
[2:48:07] night after night the angel of god would
[2:48:09] come in the room and
[2:48:10] he would go to preach and he'd say you
[2:48:12] know i had in my mind to preach this
[2:48:15] because i don't know what these seals
[2:48:16] mean and i look to see what the others
[2:48:18] have said about it and about that time
[2:48:21] when i was going to make a horrible
[2:48:22] mistake he came in the room
[2:48:28] amen and it would be revealed who the
[2:48:30] horse rider was
[2:48:32] the red the white the black the pale the
[2:48:35] book would become open
[2:48:36] and would show in there yeah god even
[2:48:38] cared about
[2:48:39] the souls under the altar that had given
[2:48:42] their lives down to tribulation and
[2:48:45] in the in the time of the of the jews
[2:48:47] for the testimony which they held
[2:48:49] incredulous stuff showing god is a god
[2:48:52] of rich
[2:48:53] in mercy and full of grace a lot more
[2:48:56] grace than what we ever dreamed
[2:49:02] and he would open it up the fifth seal
[2:49:05] and the sixth seal and the
[2:49:06] tribulation seal and show their
[2:49:10] 144 thousand sealed into moses and
[2:49:13] elijah
[2:49:14] describe and identify their ministries
[2:49:16] and say
[2:49:17] here that ministry will come again on
[2:49:19] two men anointed with the spirit of
[2:49:21] elijah
[2:49:22] and during that time a multitude without
[2:49:24] number
[2:49:25] sometimes you worry about your loved
[2:49:27] ones you know you worry about your loved
[2:49:29] ones not
[2:49:30] coming into the message quit worrying
[2:49:32] about it put it in the hands of god
[2:49:35] amen all i know is i don't know how he's
[2:49:38] going to do it there's going to be a
[2:49:39] multitude
[2:49:40] without number that are saved during the
[2:49:43] tribulation or they're saved before the
[2:49:45] tribulation but they
[2:49:46] but they wind up in the tribulation or
[2:49:48] given white robes
[2:49:51] wash their robes more correctly in the
[2:49:53] blood of the lamb
[2:49:55] still doing acts of sanctification
[2:49:57] they're sanctified people in the
[2:49:59] tribulation
[2:50:01] but to you you don't wash your robes to
[2:50:03] get them white
[2:50:05] to you has been granted a
[2:50:08] royal grant to be clothed in white linen
[2:50:12] clean and white which is the
[2:50:15] righteousness of the saints
[2:50:18] so the righteousness of abraham and
[2:50:20] enoch and isaac and jacob
[2:50:22] not their sins but their righteousness
[2:50:24] of all the saints of peter james and
[2:50:26] john
[2:50:27] and all the new testament and all down
[2:50:29] to the ages
[2:50:30] you're wearing it today
[2:50:34] something old and something new and
[2:50:36] something borrowed
[2:50:39] something that don't make me blue
[2:50:42] because i realize i'm clothed with the
[2:50:45] faith of abraham
[2:50:46] the grace of jacob the love of isaac
[2:50:50] and the perfection of joseph
[2:50:53] i realize i'm close with the faith of
[2:50:56] enoch
[2:50:57] i'm clothed you know my we could preach
[2:51:00] now
[2:51:01] i'm clothed with all of them because
[2:51:03] it's been granted to me
[2:51:06] that all of their righteousness i would
[2:51:09] be clothed with with one great
[2:51:11] baptism of the holy ghost
[2:51:14] that gives me the right of inheritance
[2:51:17] to every divine promise
[2:51:25] and from there brother branham
[2:51:28] showed us over and over and again the
[2:51:31] book is open
[2:51:33] and he said things like predestination
[2:51:36] and eternal security
[2:51:38] and correct water baptism and immersion
[2:51:40] and all these that we have probed at
[2:51:42] through the years and guessed that now
[2:51:45] we know
[2:51:49] because i'm preaching to a people of an
[2:51:52] open book
[2:51:55] and the debt of the ages past
[2:51:59] has been wiped away by the bleach of the
[2:52:01] blood of jesus
[2:52:04] and everything that kept them from a
[2:52:06] rapture
[2:52:08] is now annihilated and now you
[2:52:11] have been prepared and marked and called
[2:52:14] for a rapture
[2:52:17] because you are on the brink standing on
[2:52:20] the edge
[2:52:21] on the threshold of total
[2:52:26] redemption
[2:52:30] hallelujah let the choir come back again
[2:52:35] i want you to stand together with me and
[2:52:37] worship god just a moment
[2:52:39] just raise your hands to him and say
[2:52:41] lord thank you
[2:52:44] there's a power that's released from
[2:52:46] this book that
