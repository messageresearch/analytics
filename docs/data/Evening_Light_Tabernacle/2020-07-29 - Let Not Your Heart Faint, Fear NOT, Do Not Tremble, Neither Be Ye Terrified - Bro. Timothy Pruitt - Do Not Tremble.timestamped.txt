[32:40] amen
[32:43] how many loves him tonight amen
[32:47] deuteronomy 20 and verse 1 says when
[32:50] thou goest
[32:51] out to battle against thy enemies and
[32:54] see his horses
[32:55] and chariots and a people more than thou
[32:59] be not afraid of them for the lord thy
[33:02] god is with thee
[33:04] which brought thee out of the land of
[33:05] egypt and it shall be when you're come
[33:08] nigh unto the battle that the priests
[33:11] shall approach and speak
[33:13] unto the people and say unto them hear
[33:16] o israel you approach this day into
[33:20] battle against your enemies
[33:22] let not your hearts faint fear not
[33:25] do not tremble neither be ye terrified
[33:29] because of them for the lord your god is
[33:32] he that goeth with you
[33:34] to fight for you against your enemies to
[33:37] save you
[33:38] hallelujah we'll let you be seated this
[33:40] evening
[33:44] i'd like to pull from verse 3 let not
[33:47] your hearts faint
[33:49] fear not do not tremble
[33:52] neither be ye terrified because of them
[33:57] you know i was just going through the
[33:59] bible as we
[34:00] and my wife have been reading the bible
[34:02] chapter by chapter
[34:03] i read this some days ago and it's been
[34:05] on my heart and
[34:06] actually was trying to go some other
[34:08] places tonight but been kind of on this
[34:10] thought of the lord
[34:11] fighting for us or our faith for the
[34:14] battle and i know
[34:15] we are in the midst of a all-out assault
[34:17] from hell
[34:19] sicknesses on every hand and spirits
[34:22] that are rising up greater and more
[34:25] than ever before seems like but you know
[34:28] israel looking at this you know
[34:29] israel would be outnumbered many times
[34:32] in the battle because they were
[34:33] just set out set out as slaves come out
[34:36] of egypt
[34:37] coming through the wilderness and a lot
[34:38] of them had died off and
[34:40] a lot of them had and then god had
[34:42] raised up another generation so
[34:44] there was there was many times they were
[34:46] outnumbered there was no doubt
[34:48] many times the enemy was better equipped
[34:50] or more highly trained or
[34:53] or or been in more battles and more had
[34:56] more opportunities to
[34:57] uh kind of understand the war or how to
[35:00] war but
[35:01] you know god was showing them in this
[35:03] scripture it wasn't dependent
[35:05] it never depended upon their strength
[35:07] and never depended on how well equipped
[35:09] they were
[35:10] it all depended upon him what mattered
[35:14] was he was with them amen what didn't
[35:16] matter is if they could match up with
[35:18] the enemy
[35:19] what mattered is god was with them what
[35:22] didn't matter is if they had horses or
[35:24] chariots or
[35:25] or they had many enough men what
[35:28] mattered
[35:29] is that god was with him it was the same
[35:31] god that brought them out of the land of
[35:33] egypt it was the same god that was
[35:35] bringing them
[35:36] into the promised land and they were not
[35:38] even to look at the numbers of the enemy
[35:40] they were not even to look or count the
[35:42] horses or
[35:43] count the chariots or count how many men
[35:45] there was because it didn't matter
[35:47] what the number was it didn't matter how
[35:49] many chariots there was
[35:51] it didn't matter how impossible it
[35:53] looked what mattered was god was on
[35:55] their side
[35:56] amen they were to look at their god even
[35:59] though it may look hopeless and no way
[36:01] of victory
[36:02] and no way of escape that didn't matter
[36:04] what mattered
[36:05] is their god fault for them amen and in
[36:08] joshua he would
[36:09] he would once again remind them he said
[36:11] have not not commanded thee
[36:13] be strong and of good courage be not
[36:16] afraid
[36:16] neither be thou dismayed for the lord
[36:19] thy god is with thee
[36:21] whithersoever thou goest so it didn't
[36:23] matter if joshua was in a valley it
[36:25] didn't matter if joshua was on a
[36:27] mountain
[36:27] it didn't matter how many stood before
[36:29] him it didn't matter
[36:31] how innumerable it was it didn't matter
[36:33] if their number was as the sands of the
[36:35] sea
[36:36] it didn't matter if it was it seemed
[36:38] impossible to have a victory
[36:40] the enemy it didn't matter how great the
[36:42] enemy was or their capabilities
[36:44] that didn't matter it was but it was it
[36:46] isn't it wonderful to realize that the
[36:49] enemy don't matter
[36:51] [Laughter]
[36:52] hallelujah amen is it wonderful to
[36:55] realize satan don't matter
[36:57] sickness don't matter cancer don't
[37:00] matter brain bleeds don't matter
[37:02] sin don't matter what matters is there's
[37:04] a blood
[37:05] that's greater than any sickness what
[37:08] matters is there's a blood that's
[37:10] greater than any sin
[37:11] what matters is god is on our side
[37:14] that's what matters amen what matters is
[37:17] not how high the waves are
[37:19] how how tumultuous the sea is what
[37:21] matters
[37:22] is he is in our boat amen you know i
[37:25] could see
[37:26] you know joshua as he as he would even
[37:28] stand there
[37:29] some years even before this and he would
[37:31] stand up as it were on a soapbox and
[37:33] he'd begin to proclaim the promises of
[37:35] god
[37:36] because he had seen what the promises
[37:38] that god had given them of the land
[37:39] flowing with milk and honey and that's
[37:41] all that mattered to him as he seen the
[37:43] fulfillment
[37:44] of what god promised so he knew if god
[37:47] had fulfilled the promise and showed him
[37:49] and told him of a land flowing with milk
[37:51] and honey he'd put his eyes upon it
[37:53] then what mattered it god had showed
[37:55] them that god had produced it
[37:57] and god was able to give it to them and
[37:59] so what that what didn't matter was the
[38:02] opposition
[38:04] it didn't matter that jericho had walls
[38:06] so thick
[38:07] it didn't matter how high the walls was
[38:09] it didn't matter how many people was in
[38:11] the walls
[38:12] what mattered god had given them the
[38:14] land god had given them the promise
[38:16] and i want you to understand tonight it
[38:18] doesn't matter how hard the sickness may
[38:20] seem or how
[38:21] incurable the sickness may seem or how
[38:24] impossible to get over it may seem
[38:26] what matters is there is a blood what
[38:28] matters is there is a word
[38:30] for your deliverance what matters that
[38:32] he is more than able yet more than amen
[38:35] a is able for your need
[38:36] so that's where we stand here this
[38:38] morning brother adam would say he'll say
[38:40] it like this
[38:41] this is what where the church of the
[38:43] living god

[39:05] going to be a drunk or you decreed
[39:06] that you was going to be a homosexual he

[39:20] this is where the church of the living
[39:21] god stands he said i don't care what

[39:53] how much he can gather out of hell and
[39:55] bring into this dimension
[39:56] it don't matter what matters is we are

[40:32] preachers are preaching
[40:33] across the land and says it ain't so but
[40:35] the the seed of abraham
[40:37] says it is so and they weighed right in
[40:40] and possess the gates of the enemy why
[40:42] because god said they would and that's
[40:45] all that matters
[40:47] god said you would be victorious and
[40:49] that's all that matters
[40:50] god said you would be alive and remain
[40:53] and that's all that matters
[40:54] god said you're not born for hell you're
[40:56] born for another dimension
[40:58] and that's all that matters amen the
[41:00] devil tried to take you down

[41:06] what matters is god's voice in your life
[41:10] hallelujah hey many thousands of
[41:13] preachers can say it ain't so
[41:14] but they don't matter

[41:23] but that don't matter oh sure we'll go
[41:26] through trials and we'll go through
[41:27] testings
[41:28] and joshua stood there that little fella
[41:30] he said i don't care
[41:31] how big they are i don't care what kind
[41:34] of spear they got
[41:35] how high the cities are walled how great
[41:38] they are
[41:38] what matters is this is our land given
[41:41] to us by

[41:55] that comes along
[41:59] because it's not us our strength we're
[42:00] dependent upon joshua was not dependent
[42:03] upon history
[42:04] caleb's strength or all of israel's
[42:06] strength he was dependent upon what the
[42:08] word said
[42:08] and that's all that mattered i know the
[42:12] world is trying to kill the voice of god
[42:14] and say it don't matter no more and the
[42:16] bible don't matter
[42:17] and the things of the world word don't
[42:19] matter but it does matter
[42:21] it's the only thing in this world that
[42:23] does matter
[42:25] hallelujah and his word will always
[42:28] matter
[42:29] to the seed of abraham what god says
[42:32] will
[42:33] always matter to the seed of abraham
[42:36] amen what the word of god says it's the
[42:38] final voice
[42:39] it's the final say it is the absolute
[42:43] and an absolute is all that matters
[42:53] this is five five kings came against
[42:55] joshua
[42:56] it didn't matter
[43:00] joshua 11 verse 4 says they went out
[43:03] they
[43:03] and all their hosts with them much
[43:06] people
[43:07] read this with me much people even as
[43:10] the sand that is upon the seashore
[43:14] is in multitude so that's a bunch of
[43:16] people
[43:17] in other words it was impossible to
[43:19] stand out there and count them all
[43:21] i mean i've heard them count twenty
[43:23] thousand thirty thousand in the bible
[43:24] fifty thousand hundred thousand maybe
[43:26] but this was as the sand upon the
[43:28] seashore
[43:30] with horses and chariots very
[43:33] many it didn't matter
[43:38] and when all these kings were met
[43:40] together they
[43:41] come and pitch together at the waters of
[43:43] maryland at the fight against
[43:45] israel and the lord said unto joshua now
[43:48] this
[43:49] is what matters be not afraid because of
[43:52] them
[43:52] for tomorrow about this time i will
[43:55] deliver them to you
[43:57] all slain before israel

[44:10] wants to put something upon you
[44:12] and and gather his forces as the sands
[44:15] of the sea

[44:18] kings 10
[44:19] 10 kings 15 kings whatever he wants to
[44:22] bring it don't matter

[44:33] come and they'll be all slain before you
[44:37] that's all that matters and you will hew
[44:39] their horses or
[44:41] hamstring their horses or make them
[44:43] inoperable

[44:59] service

[45:10] got cancer
[45:11] but it don't matter what matters is he

[46:34] congregation of judah
[46:36] and jerusalem in the house of the lord
[46:38] before the new court

[49:29] bugits whatever they were they didn't
[49:31] matter
[49:35] he might have not been at a number of
[49:36] them but it didn't matter
[49:39] assyria didn't matter their king didn't
[49:42] matter in 2nd chronicles 32 1.
[49:47] the king of assyria came and camped
[49:50] against defense cities and
[49:52] thought to win them for himself
[49:55] that's what the devil thought he's going
[49:56] to do he thought he's going to win you
[49:58] for himself
[50:01] and he came in and camped against you
[50:02] and this week no doubt he sent this one
[50:04] against you and that one against you
[50:06] what's he trying to do
[50:07] win you for himself but there's already
[50:09] a word spoken over you
[50:13] hallelujah and when hezekiah saw that
[50:16] santa careb was come and that he was
[50:18] purposed to fight against
[50:20] jerusalem who took counsel with his
[50:22] princes and his mighty men to stop the
[50:24] waters of the fountains
[50:25] which were without the city and then it
[50:27] helped them so they were gathering much
[50:29] people together
[50:30] who all stopped all fountains and brooks
[50:33] and said why should the king of assyria
[50:34] come
[50:35] and find much water also he strengthened
[50:37] himself and built up the wall that was
[50:39] broken
[50:40] raised it up to the towers and another
[50:42] wall without and replied
[50:43] repaired mellow the city of david and
[50:46] made darts and shields in abundance
[50:48] and he said captains of war over his
[50:50] people and gather them together
[50:52] and the street of the gate of the city
[50:54] and speak comfortably to them saying
[50:57] be strong and courageous be not of fear
[51:00] afraid nor dismayed for the king of
[51:02] syria
[51:02] for he don't matter nor his multitude

[51:45] upon the words of hezekiah king of judah
[51:49] god is with us
[51:53] let not our hearts faint fear not
[51:56] do not tremble neither be ye terrified
[52:02] the greatest thing though enemies god is
[52:04] fear

[52:08] of god because he'll try to tell you
[52:09] whether his disease is known as
[52:11] incurable well there's no such thing as
[52:14] an incurable disease when it comes to

[1:08:01] what the indians call the indian
[1:08:03] death walk and he said i began to walk
[1:08:06] right around said i
[1:08:07] had head off in one direction come right
[1:08:09] back to the same tree
[1:08:11] so i thought i couldn't get lost
[1:08:12] anywhere i got instincts enough to know
[1:08:15] where i am at all times he said but god
[1:08:17] has to take you off your feet sometimes
[1:08:20] to let you know that you don't know
[1:08:26] and we have to depend on him
[1:08:30] listen we can't depend on a miracle cure

[1:09:05] slide on razor blades

[1:09:12] but it might end up being a great year
[1:09:20] hallelujah what god wants you to get to
[1:09:22] where
[1:09:23] you have to depend on him you're just
[1:09:25] dependent on your 401k
[1:09:27] you're just dependent on your job you're
[1:09:29] just dependent on all kinds of things
[1:09:30] god wants you to depend
[1:09:32] on him he is all that matters
[1:09:41] and here he had his family way back
[1:09:42] there in a little cabin little
[1:09:44] wife and little billy little baby
[1:09:48] so they'd just die in just a few moments
[1:09:50] if i couldn't get to him in the storm
[1:09:51] because

[1:09:54] didn't know how to take care of herself
[1:09:55] out there
[1:09:56] and said i was on this death walk
[1:09:58] walking in a circle
[1:10:00] fog so low there was no markers or
[1:10:03] nothing
[1:10:04] and i seen i was caught i said well i
[1:10:08] have to take some course i
[1:10:09] i have to do the best i can and i i'd
[1:10:12] start off walking one way
[1:10:13] and i couldn't already see as far as the
[1:10:15] wall and these great trees are swaying
[1:10:18] the wind blowing
[1:10:19] and like what can i do lord i begin to

[1:10:55] a very present help in the time of
[1:10:58] trouble
[1:11:00] oh hallelujah but the devil's trying to
[1:11:02] get you to think the fog matters
[1:11:04] and the storm matters and the trees
[1:11:06] matter and this
[1:11:08] matters but what matters is what he's
[1:11:10] saying in your ear

[1:11:46] two then went out but my wife was in the
[1:11:49] woods
[1:11:49] and i'm just worried and i keep walking
[1:11:52] but at the same time i keep hearing a
[1:11:54] voice saying

[1:16:20] if i could just grab a hold of it if i
[1:16:23] could just grab him tonight
[1:16:25] that's all that matters
[1:16:29] i set my course and i began walking with
[1:16:31] my hands up saying lord jesus

[1:18:09] and all of a sudden you'll go along
[1:18:11] service after service with your hands up
[1:18:14] praising god but after a while you hit

[1:20:51] places of of torture and torment
[1:20:55] spirits that tried to hold us all of us
[1:20:57] had different things we battled
[1:20:59] but he met every condition
[1:21:02] i know people come to this church
[1:21:04] sometimes or at other churches sometimes
[1:21:06] and they come out of the world
[1:21:07] and hey man brother elle talk to me
[1:21:09] about this he said you come in this
[1:21:11] place and you think well man all these
[1:21:12] are holy people
[1:21:15] we weren't always holy
[1:21:18] we weren't always living righteous
[1:21:23] but spirits had us demons at us
[1:21:28] devil's had us so young person don't
[1:21:31] thank you the only one that's ever been
[1:21:32] attacked by the devil or held by the
[1:21:34] devil
[1:21:35] we've all been held by devils
[1:21:38] but that didn't matter because this god
[1:21:40] meets every condition
[1:21:42] and he's a very present help in the time
[1:21:44] of trouble so devils don't matter
[1:21:46] conditions don't matter

[1:21:57] and he's able to bring them under his
[1:21:59] feet he's able to make them bow to the
[1:22:01] name of jesus christ
[1:22:03] that's what matters
[1:22:06] i know coronavirus is trying to tell you
[1:22:08] it matters
[1:22:09] what matters is god heals coronavirus
[1:22:14] cancer tries to say i matter what
[1:22:16] matters is god heals it
[1:22:19] he defeated it at calvary that's what
[1:22:21] really matters
[1:22:23] but he meets any conditions the
[1:22:24] disciples found that out one day they
[1:22:26] was out on a boat
[1:22:28] having a testimony meeting had went off
[1:22:31] and he had went up to the mountains to
[1:22:33] pray
[1:22:35] he was and so the devil saw that for an
[1:22:37] opportunity and said he's not with them
[1:22:39] now and he's
[1:22:39] here well it's my time to get them he
[1:22:41] says the devil says
[1:22:43] i'm going to sink them i'm going to go
[1:22:45] because they went off without him
[1:22:47] and that's just what he's trying to do
[1:22:49] now he's trying to blow his poison
[1:22:51] breath
[1:22:54] and bring the old seas into a nervous
[1:22:57] prostration
[1:22:58] what we are seeing in the realms that
[1:23:00] we're living in is the devil blowing his
[1:23:02] old poison breath
[1:23:04] and the seas are beginning to be
[1:23:06] tormented and
[1:23:08] and and the people are beginning to and
[1:23:10] to scream and cry out
[1:23:12] and try to come against the church of
[1:23:14] god
[1:23:17] saying i'll sink them now standing his
[1:23:20] old evil eyes on every wave
[1:23:22] lashing out with lightning thunders
[1:23:24] roaring
[1:23:25] i'm going to get him we're going to get
[1:23:27] him cause they're without him
[1:23:29] he's gone off seems like and he said
[1:23:31] that's what the devil has done to the
[1:23:33] church today
[1:23:34] he said he thinks he's going off without
[1:23:36] jesus
[1:23:37] he said don't go over to the world
[1:23:38] around and get around to people but get
[1:23:40] let's say they said we we've got to get
[1:23:42] something they haven't got

[1:23:46] got we've got
[1:23:48] jesus he said they got glamour they got
[1:23:51] this and they got that
[1:23:52] but we got jesus

[1:23:59] pain
[1:24:00] you got problems you got situations and
[1:24:02] conditions we've got jesus
[1:24:10] he said what happened the conditions got
[1:24:14] so bad all hopes were gone
[1:24:16] oars broke sails broke and it was a ship
[1:24:20] out there with no
[1:24:21] nothing to guide it just a little bobber
[1:24:23] and bobber on top of a wave
[1:24:25] crashing about
[1:24:33] you know what he done he knew
[1:24:37] they were going to get in trouble
[1:24:41] he saw the waves coming before they got
[1:24:43] there
[1:24:46] he saw 220 before you got there
[1:24:50] he saw the waves that were coming he saw
[1:24:53] the spirits that would be against the
[1:24:54] church
[1:24:55] he knew what was going to take place he
[1:24:58] knew who would get sick
[1:25:01] he knew how the enemy would come against
[1:25:03] the ministry and seemingly pour out his
[1:25:05] vengeance and
[1:25:06] this minister go down with sickness his
[1:25:08] minister's wife be attacked
[1:25:10] time after time and people all over the
[1:25:12] place now coming down with things

[1:25:20] you know what he done he climbed to the
[1:25:22] highest hill that was in palestine
[1:25:23] further up you go the further you can
[1:25:25] see and he climbed up to the top so he
[1:25:27] could watch them
[1:25:28] and when they got in trouble and needed
[1:25:30] him he
[1:25:31] could be a very prison help in the time
[1:25:34] of trouble
[1:25:35] brother when they crucified him at
[1:25:37] calvary the world thought they had him
[1:25:39] death thought he had him hell thought he
[1:25:41] had him devil thought he had him but he
[1:25:43] broke every seal
[1:25:44] and he not only climbed through calvary
[1:25:46] but he went beyond every moon and star
[1:25:48] and he sets to the right hand of the
[1:25:50] imaginative
[1:25:50] majesty tonight and his eye is on the
[1:25:53] sparrow
[1:25:54] and if he knows about a little bitty
[1:25:55] bird i know he watches over me
[1:25:59] he sees her troubles he sees our
[1:26:01] frustrations
[1:26:02] he sees everything whirling around like

[1:30:20] the service for the rapture he would
[1:30:22] read this quote or the scripture
[1:30:24] the lord is my light and my salvation
[1:30:29] whom shall i fear let these words sink
[1:30:33] deep i think are we in the rapture
[1:30:35] time well then i believe these words
[1:30:38] ought to mean more to us than ever
[1:30:40] the lord is my light and my salvation
[1:30:44] whom shall i fear the lord is the
[1:30:47] strength of my life
[1:30:49] of whom shall i be afraid when the
[1:30:52] wicked even my enemies and my foes come
[1:30:54] upon me to eat but my flesh
[1:30:56] they stumbled and fell and though a host
[1:31:00] shouldn't camp against me
[1:31:01] my heart shall not fear the war should
[1:31:04] rise up against me
[1:31:05] and this will i be confident one thing
[1:31:07] have i desired of the lord that will i
[1:31:09] seek after
[1:31:10] that i may dwell in the house of the
[1:31:12] lord all the days of my life
[1:31:14] and to behold the beauty of the lord to
[1:31:16] inquire in his temple
[1:31:18] for in the time of trouble for in the
[1:31:21] time of trouble
[1:31:23] he shall hide me
[1:31:27] in his pavilion in the secret of his
[1:31:30] tabernacle
[1:31:31] shall he hide me he shall set me upon a
[1:31:34] rock
[1:31:36] oh praise the god of abraham isaac and
[1:31:39] jacob
[1:31:39] this god has not left you he knew this
[1:31:44] would be a time of trouble
[1:31:46] but he's going to hide you he knew the
[1:31:49] spirits would be against you
[1:31:50] but he's going to be for you
[1:31:58] psalms 37 39 says but the salvation
[1:32:01] of the righteous is of the lord and he
[1:32:04] is their strength
[1:32:06] in the time of trouble and the lord
[1:32:08] shall help them
[1:32:09] and deliver them he shall deliver them
[1:32:12] from the wicked
[1:32:13] and save them because they
[1:32:16] trust in him psalms 46 says god
[1:32:19] is our refuge and strength a very
[1:32:22] present help
[1:32:23] in trouble daniel 12 1 says at that time
[1:32:27] shall michael stand up the great prince
[1:32:29] which standeth for the children of thy
[1:32:31] people
[1:32:32] and there shall be a time of trouble
[1:32:34] such as never
[1:32:35] seen since there was a nation even to
[1:32:39] that same time
[1:32:40] and that don't matter
[1:32:43] what matters is at that time
[1:32:47] thy people shall be delivered
[1:32:53] i think we can just go ahead and rejoice
[1:32:56] we're going to turn our eyes from a
[1:32:58] trouble because in our trouble at that
[1:33:00] time
[1:33:01] you're going to be delivered every name

[1:34:21] at the right hand of god who also maketh
[1:34:23] intercession for us

[1:34:39] nay and all these things
[1:34:41] we are more than conquerors through him
[1:34:44] that loved us
[1:34:45] for i am persuaded that neither death
[1:34:48] nor life nor angels nor principalities
[1:34:51] nor powers nor things present nor things
[1:34:53] to come
[1:34:54] nor height nor depth nor anything and

[1:35:05] the devil who
[1:35:11] what's what does he say when we're going
[1:35:13] to look onto him
[1:35:14] and that day he said they shall look
[1:35:16] upon on him and say

[1:35:27] look at that demon cancer
[1:35:31] that's the one
[1:35:36] the devil wants to make you think he's
[1:35:37] some big bad dude
[1:35:39] he got his backbone broke
[1:35:43] as far as i can under as far as i
[1:35:45] understand once you get your backbone
[1:35:47] broke which is what happened to calvary
[1:35:49] it broke his backbone therefore he is
[1:35:52] incapacitated
[1:35:54] he has no power he is nothing but a
[1:35:58] bluff
[1:36:01] who
[1:36:05] you know the next thing you need to have
[1:36:06] that demon of fear comes to you and said

[1:36:31] conquerors the king of kings and the
[1:36:33] lord of lords
[1:36:34] the mighty god and he's my god
