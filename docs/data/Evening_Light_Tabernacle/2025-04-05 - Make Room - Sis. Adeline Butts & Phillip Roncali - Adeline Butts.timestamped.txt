[0:01] [Music]
[0:17] A family hiding from the storm found no
[0:24] place at the keeper's door. It was for
[0:28] this a child was born to save a world so
[0:35] cold and
[0:38] hollow. The sleeping town they did not
[0:44] know. Lying in a manger.
[0:50] A savior king who had no
[0:55] home has come to heal our
[1:00] [Music]
[1:02] sorrows. Is there room in your
[1:07] heart? Is there room in your heart?
[1:13] Is there room in your heart for God to
[1:18] write his
[1:20] [Music]
[1:27] story? Shepherds counting sheep at
[1:32] night. Do not fear the glory light. You
[1:38] are preious in his sight.
[1:43] God has come to raise the
[1:49] lonely. Is there room in your
[1:53] heart? Is there room in your
[1:58] heart? Is there room in your heart for
[2:03] God to write his
[2:05] [Music]
[2:07] story? You can come as you are.
[2:13] The may set you
[2:17] aart and you make room in your heart and
[2:21] trade your dreams for his
[2:27] glory. Make room in your heart.
[2:32] Make room your
[2:37] [Music]
[2:40] heart. Mother holds the promise tight.
[2:46] Every wrong will be made right. The road
[2:51] is straight. The burdens light. For in
[2:56] his hands he holds
[3:01] tomorrow. Is there room in your
[3:05] heart? Is there room in your
[3:10] heart? Is there room in your heart for
[3:14] God to write his story?
[3:20] You can come as you
[3:23] are, but it may set you
[3:28] aart when you make room in your heart
[3:32] and train from dreams for
[3:35] [Music]
[3:37] glory. Make room your
[3:42] heart. Make room your heart.
[3:47] Make one your
[3:49] [Music]
[3:51] heart. Make one your heart.
[3:57] [Applause]
