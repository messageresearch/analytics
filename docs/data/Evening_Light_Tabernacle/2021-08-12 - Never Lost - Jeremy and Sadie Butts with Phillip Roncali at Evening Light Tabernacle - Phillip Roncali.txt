Lyrics

Miracles when You move
Such an easy thing for You to do
Your hand is moving right now
You are still showing up
At the tomb of every Lazarus
Your voice is calling me out
Right now, I know You're able
My God, come through again

You can do all things
You can do all things but fail
'Cause You've never lost a battle
No, You've never lost a battle
And I know, I know You never will

Everything's possible
By the power of the Holy Ghost
A new wind is blowing right now
Breaking my heart of stone
Taking over like it's Jericho
And my walls are all crashing down

You've never lost a battle
You've never lost a battle
You've never lost a battle
You never will
And I know, I know You never will
You've never lost a battle
You've never lost a battle
You've never lost a battle
You never will

And I know You won't lose
And I know You won't lose
And I know You won't lose
You never will
You never will
You never will
You never will
You never will
You never will
You never will
You never will

Songwriters: Christopher Joel Brown, Steven Furtick, Tiffany Hammer
