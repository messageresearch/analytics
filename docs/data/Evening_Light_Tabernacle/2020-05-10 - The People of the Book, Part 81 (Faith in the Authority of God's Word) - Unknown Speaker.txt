special way the Lord knows your need knows your situation man you don't have to be here physically present you just right here in his presence today knowing that he is the ever-present water from the

that we do lean on you're the hope o God that we have because our faith is in you Lord the solid rock of the Word of God we're asking for your anointing today Lord that you would anoint a word to us that ever need that you would supply by speaking to our hearts Lord and revealing yourself to us you're the Almighty God and you change not and we're just depending on You Lord as I think about it today as I stand here Lord with fragments of dots that we can speak upon but Lord we're here at your service to speak your word and you know how you want this set and we just pray God did you direct every word to its mark bring healing to your children Lord there's many the Scott needs Lord as we have heard the request today we hear of another with cancer Lord cancers are many sickness or many but Lord we believe that your word will set your people free and we're asking in the name of Jesus since you'll do it today for your children that you'll bring healing in the name of Jesus and deliverance in your mighty name we pray just me they need now we ask in Jesus name thank you Father amen amen god bless you god bless his word today you turn with me to Joshua chapter one we're going to read from the first verse this morning we want to say happy mother's day to all of you mothers that are here across the lamb wherever you are God knows you a man may you have a wonderful day today and a blessed time hopefully you can get together with your children I know some are afraid to even hug their children I just go ahead and hug them if I were you and amen just make this a very special day amen amen so but anyway it's just good to be in the house of the Lord together and to give the the name of the Lord praise and glory and honor I want to say I had a wonderful mother to God the grandmothers of a wonderful wife I have that very special mother to my four children a wonderful mother-in-law real godly women that have been a part of my life and I want to thank God for them and many many of you that are here as mothers out and wherever you are as wherever this reaches you that have blessed me through the years I wanted to say god bless you each one of you today in his name Joshua chapter 1 verse 1 now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of nun Moses ministers sayin Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this Jordan thou and all this people into the land which I do give them even to the children of Israel every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon that I have I given unto you as I said unto Moses from the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river the river Euphrates all the land of the Hittites even unto the grates unto the Great Sea toward the going down of the Sun shall be your coast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of that life as I was with Moses so will I I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong and of good courage for under this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the lamb which I swear unto their fathers to give them only be that strong and very courageous that thou may us observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou may prosper whether so ever thou goest this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth I want you to notice this verse in particular shall not depart out of that mouth but thou shalt meditate in a day and night that thou mayst observe to do according to all that is written therein for then thou shalt make that way prosperous and then shalt I'll have good success have not I commanded thee be strong and a good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest amen what wonderful words of life today god bless you can be seated this actually was my New Year's message that I read from this text here and we want to day just to look at it again as we go to the Lord and and as we're thankful to be able to gather even like we are gathering with the freedoms that we have I just wanted to mention that we have brethren that are in China that are imprisoned just for possessing and and sharing the King James Version Bible so we want to remember those believers that are there in in prison and some of them are have been threatened to be locked away for a lifetime because of this and so we did get word today that brother LV one of the brothers there was able to get out of prison so we thank God for that that he's been released but there are others that are there that we are believed in that God is going to bring a deliverance and that he's gonna set them free and man hi I know he did it for Peter a man he can do it for them and he can do what men thinks impossible and so while we are enjoying the the freedoms that we're having today and even though maybe we might feel like there's somewhat limited on account of the quarantine that's been going on we still have at least some freedoms today to to preach the Word of God and to broadcast this around the world and so we thank God for that opportunity we're looking forward to again being together very very soon and so we we expect things to change as they as things move along and the quarantine is rules changes and hopefully that we'll be able to meet together really really soon and we have been in contact with you on our evening light web page there on the Facebook page just to kind of keep you updated on how that we will go about doing that in time but so if you'll just check there and look well you'll be able to see exactly what we're going to be doing but we're looking to together to get together again and have a wonderful time in the presence of God so we are glad today for those few of you that could be here and share this moment especially you mothers that are gonna have to go on and cook your own Mother's Day dinner and you know so it's probably not gonna be waiting on you today you're out in some restaurant somewhere that's because of the rules that are different but anyway happy Mother's Day amen it's just being a mother cooking dinner amen god bless you ain't meant for your faithfulness I'm sure you'll get a pot or a pan or something that'll help you with your duties today and so I know one of my one of my grandma I heard of one of one child anyway saying about its mom we're gonna get her a pot so you know mama needs another pot I'm sure amen so it's good to be here it's good to be in the presence of God and be able to talk about the good things of God and knowing that his word is the truth and and we can we can expect God to do it tremendous things and I I believe we're living in a day where God is doing some very very extreme things as he works here in this evening time and this process of finishing up all things in the fulfillment of the scriptures and I would like to I would like to look at John chapter 1 and verse 1 for another scripture reading and as you're turning there I'm just going to remind you of a portion of the scripture that we just read this book of the law shall not depart out of that mouth but thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou may observe to do all that is written therein for then thou shalt make that way prosperous and then thou shalt have good success and then John 1 and 1 tells us that in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the same was in the beginning with God and all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men skipping down to verse but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor the will of man but of God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth today we're going to be speaking on the faith in the authority of God's Word now reading here in John 1 we see that the word that was in the beginning was made flesh in Jesus Christ and we know that Jesus came to demonstrate the word in flesh if we want to see what we're to do what the church is to be like all we have to do is look at Jesus and the Ministry of Jesus and to see what the gospel brought us in and brother Branham would speak about this he said the word came to the prophets but Jesus was different from that he was the word the Prophet could only say what was put in his mouth to say but Jesus was that word and the entire Word of God could flow through him and he could create and he could stop the winds and the waves and what more because it was God always in the word now God is trying to find a church that he can project his word through you see God watches over his word to vindicate it so now we we notice God's speaking through the prophets and then God spoke to us in a son but now God is going to project himself looking for church that he can project his word through that the thoughts of God can be manifested through them and and of course in our generation we know that the miraculous has been done and it was done to activate our faith in the world hey man the problem is of course many people's their faith not misplaced he got put in brother Branham but that's not what he was sent to do he came to restore our faith back to the Apostolic fathers and the the early apostolic faith was in the atonement and that's what it was to do it was to put our faith back in the Word of God you see brother Branham can't always be here he's already been gone over 50 years nearly going toward 60 years now but but again I'm you know he can't he can't be here and that he wasn't meant to be here in this time but the Word of God is what we were to have our faith put in because the Word of God is eternal are you with me now phases of victory the Bible said that overcomes the world and that faith must not reside in a man or it will die with the man but it must be in the eternal Word of God now of course you know when we think of that faith is our victory when John wrote that as we would read he could read him first John when he wrote faith is the victory that overcometh the world you you said well he didn't have my troubles or he didn't have to deal with the people that I deal with or didn't have to go through the things that I do and that's right he may not have to deal with the same folks he may not have to overcome the same thing but he never excluded that he said faith is the victory that overcometh the world the whole thing so again how is it it's faith in it so we are to ride above the things of the world that we are to overcome we have the written word of god layin before us and the Holy Spirit also which is also the word because Jesus is the word the Holy Spirit or God is the word come on somebody and so this is the word that and that has been written the thoughts of God written on paper so we have the written word of God in the Holy Spirit here performing and showing the resurrection of the Lord Jesus with the divine promises that are written here that whatsoever things that you desire when you pray that you that you receive it and you know and you shall have it you believe it and you shall have it again with what you do what do you do then you have faith a faith that anchors in what God said not a make-believe faith but a real faith now faith is a conqueror brother Branham would talk about this he said Bates's an overcomer you know it's not just a peacemaker it overcomes faces the victory that overcomes the world and so it is it is a conquering and to to conquer and victory is the same thing it means to beat down to override the handcuff to throw into prison it means that the sin that once ruled you it means that you rule it now and then it means you have overcome it and you have whipped it and you're greater than it is amen so we think about what was first the sin the sinner and the Savior a savior was first so a savior is more powerful than sin so which was first the healer or the sickness you know that couldn't be a healer of course and until until there was sickness but God in his mind already knew this was coming by the choice it man made and so as a healer it could conquer the sickness and the faces of victory that overcomes every curse of the devil faith in what now not in your church not painting a Creed not faith and some man but paid to Jesus Christ you've made the promise man it is the victory you know a lot of times we look at circumstances my arm is still crippled my pain is still there I still feel sick but faith is the victory that overcomes the world and when you climb into God by prayer until you see the thing is conquered underneath you there is nothing can hurt you then you're overcome and man you're sailing free then because you you realize the thing is conquered beneath you man now you you know some of you that were a drunkard or slave to to alcohol you know he used to be your master but you're the master now hey man why what happened when you got faith faith gave you the victory to overcome that Jesus said you can be free the word said you can be free and you started believing what the Lord said and then you begin acting upon what the word said and God brought you deliverance in your life hey man so that when that happens then your enemy is your servant he has to do what you say man now so you know that brother branham talked about this about a woman he said that that she cried and begged and cried to be delivered of tobacco and you know said she she would come to the altar time after time after time wanting to be delivered and and she saw brother Branham I I cried and I prayed and I've cried and I prayed and he said well you're just emotional you're just fighting the air that won't be no good he said I'd get down and pray with her lay hands on her and she'd go back to meet a few days and she just knock you down with cigarette smoke her hands were still brown but one night she went to the doctor and and the doctor diagnosed her with a with a disease and she was ghaleon to die it was Tims she got down to business man you know a drowning man will reach for a straw and as long as you walk out of the church and just go join this church and that church and you know I'm a good person there's nothing wrong with me and that's what she kept doing well I love Jesus and yet I can still smoke and I love Jesus but when she got down to business and you cease all her sins in the light of the Bible and then she repented she got down that place where repent or perish and then then got down to business and with God and of course you know I'm there because of that at that moment in time and brother Branham wouldn't buy her place after prayin time after time after time and but when she reached that point of getting down to business and my words he put her faith in the Word of God and realized this is a sin I must have big tree over it was then that God brought he delivers in her life and man he said well why didn't she overcome before because he was just fluttering around but when she got down to business with God it was then that God moved him to sing for her and the same thing happens for you when you get down to business with God I mean that's when God is going to move on the scene for you in your situation hey man you put your faith in in in God he said when you get down to business he said why wait that long why not get down to business now put your faith in God what is the woman that put her faith in me and failed because I'm a man but when she changed her faith not in the Branham tabernacle and William Branham or anyone else but placed her faith in Jesus Christ did she got faced you raised up above her fears and doubts and God healed her and she overcome faith is the victory that overcomes now we gotta realize that when when Brannen was here he was given a gift sent by the angel of God with a gift to cause our faith to rise in the promise are you with me hey man his gift was not given to heal you but to get you to believe that Jesus is present and he could be touched by your needs amen now brother Branham said this in from that time he said he said now I'm what did she touch she touched a high priest if you believe all things are possible I'm watching just keep praying wherever you are balcony wherever you are keep praying Lord remember me I'm safe now don't now don't now don't try to make you nervous yourself nervous just say Lord I believe the man is telling me the truth I believe he's so what did the angel tell me if you can get the people to believe you now listen not believe me as a man but believe the message I'm telling you believe me and be sincere when you pray nothing will stand before your prayer that's what the man speaking of the angel said to me sees it he told me not to get the people to believe me he said not as a man but believe my message now my message listen his message is the Word of God believe the Bible it was to get you not to believe him the man believed the word that he was bringing now I'm trying to bring something here today faith in the authority of God's Word now again you know we wonder how can I touch him he's a high preach that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities when Jesus was here people would reach out and touches the hem of His garment or part of his garment as he passed behind many were healed right the woman there that reached out and touched him she was healed but genuine faith he says no no defeat it's already done it's already over God said so that finishes God said so not to say they when you really believe it that touches him now get this stop because we wonder how can I touch him he's not here physically but he's yet he's I preach that can be touched he is touched when you really believe him so this is what God's trying to get you to do is to reach out in faith and touch him hey man now and he said the little woman that touched His garment said if I can just touch His garment I'll be made whole and she did it and when she carried out her what her faith wanted her to do touch it he felt it and he turned around and spoke to and he says now he's right now let her faith touches garment he's right now is the high priest that can be touched by the feelings of an Germany we all know that in him he's the same yesterday today and forever he'll have to act today as he did yesterday if he's still the same high priest and he is a man a man now so again this is very very important did you understand we can still touch him with our faith now but it all has to do with your approach to God just like Martha remember Martha she was always busy about every other thing and Mary was sitting at his feet but now Martha gives her chance when Lazarus is dead and she has a right she thinks perhaps or maybe someone would think to to to chastise Jesus she could have been here you could have come we're not when we sit for you you know why didn't you you were his friend but she didn't she stood right there and she had the right approach and she said Lord if you'd have been here my brother wouldn't have died but even now Lord and that approach to God calls God to move on the behalf of Lazarus are you with me because that she had the right approach to God if we can have the right approach to God this morning that God's gonna move on my behalf now so you see if you can get the people to believe that's what brother Branham has said it's only a sign to get you to believe that Jesus Christ died for your sickness and your sins and accepting it on the basis of his shed blood and you draw the attributes from it and anything you not need of God God will give it to you if you can only believe it so again the sign was to give you to believe that brother NSAID not me as a man but that message and my message is that we accept him on the basis of his shared blood and you draw the attributes from the promise of the word now the reason I'm bringing that out is because you know again we're not going through this whole on the scenario again brother Branham standing here and discerning the thoughts and intents are hard and calling this an out now if I can get you to believe but you know we can't we can't come into that round anymore that's a round past that's a day past but the word is still present and if we can have the same faith in the same word that brother Branham was bringing them are you with me a man then we can see the same results again if we can get the people to believe what the automa that is faithful that it's mine that God's willing to heal me that is written in the world it's my promise and every promise of this word is mine now so again believe what believe that brother Branham was a good man believe that it was a prophet no believe that Jesus Christ died for your sickness and your sins and accepted it on the basis of his shed blood that's how you draw attributes from him anything you have need of of God will will give it God will give it to you if you can only believe it now again I want to go back we don't have brother Branham anymore we have the word though and that's what he was trying to get our faith in hey man so we're and if we got the word that we got healing we got delivered we got salvation everything lays in the promise of the word it's just dependent on you believing not that God can do it but that he's done it for you that is a personal God now there is nothing that can take place take the place of the written word now I'm trying to try to get your thoughts into the value of the Bible the Word of God I'm gonna say some very straight things about that because Bible said that faith comes by hearing and hearing the Word of God is that right now brother right incentives we see that they approach and as it is now I'm very happy that know we still have the Bible God's eternal blessed word hey ma'am and he said there's nothing will ever take its place there never be a denomination a church I'll never be a person are an individual that will ever take the place of this written word cuz in the beginning was the word and go and the word was god and the word was with god and the word was gone so there may never be a denomination a church a person aren't individual that can take the place of the word understand Amen brother branham can't take the place of the Bible and it meant no great profit no great man of God no great preacher no great church now that's been the problem churches have come along denominations they have taken the place of the Word of God by interpreted to me something different right Amen but our faith must be in the written word of God let's see the value of this now I'm turn with me to first Corinthians two and four Paul said my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom but in the demonstration of the Spirit and power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God so again Paul was saying our faith is to rest in the power of God and that's found in the Word of God the word has all the power of God right in it amen all the power all the in appearance and meant all the wonderful powers to create to create a world lays in the Word of God now let's just see this in Romans 1:16 I want you to look at this scripture with me well I'm not a shame the gospel of Christ we already know this in Bihar for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also to the Greek so let's look at this a moment I am not ashamed of the gospel now that's the word right I am not ashamed of the word so he says the word is the power of God for deliverance if you can look at it again look at the script real close now and see and read with me what it's saying the gospel the word is the power of God for deliverance that's what the Bible said if the gospel is the word come then the word is the power of God for salvation for deliveries amen so now if you want to know where the power is it lays in the world a map and the word will only be as powerful as what you release it to be from your life a man so again in the Word of God is the power of God for deliverance for salvation for healing for ever need now let me stop a minute let me just add let me just stop for a moment I'm hearing there ever every day it seems like every day I'm hearing of another struck down with cancer another I've never seen such a time in my life just got a just got a word from a dear friend of mine Truman Jackson we prayed about his wife sister Carol there there there longtime friends of mine that I've known for many many years sister Carol has just gotten news that she's got cancer sister Cynthia Parker it's got reoccurring cancer again in her body we've been praying for our brother Ron who's who the enemy has struck down with with cancer we've been praying for sister Salaam in India by the way I'm we're a tire that she sent me god bless you sister Shalom and happy Mother's Day and we're believing that God's gonna give you victory any man for whatever he's done you've done to the least of these my little ones you've done it to me he said and so God seems a very tokens very reason I wore this tie this morning because I'm speaking to you about your need but I want you to know you know when we when we hear about all these different needs and and just hearing the other day of brother Mike walls his wife was that for cancer operation comes down goes in and and it's gotten um sister Wayne that's got a koban nineteen a positive test and he's sick with the with the cove in nineteen and as he was listening listening to the service from Sunday faith just come in as hard as we prayed and his fever left him and he's been fever free since that time because the word went forth and healed him hey man remember his wife there's was was going to be having a very important surgery and was scheduled for surgeon but can't have it because of because of the cove at nineteen but yeah but let me say as we talk about this as we hear so many with cancer cancer brother Adam said it is nothing to Jesus Christ no more than I headache a man so I'll brother Tim you don't know how bad my headache kids I tell you got to heal that headache he'll heal it today we don't have to wait for tomorrow and your cancer is no more of a problem to God and nothing diseases Christ no more than a headache man brother Bradley would say cancer is no bad thing for God to heal cancer is nothing in the presence of God God can make all things well a map so he said there isn't there more sickness in the land today than there's ever been now that Great Plague of cancer sweeping the nations and Christians are dying by it by the thousands and to think at that very hour the angel of God came down and even specified cancer now understood the devil Oh notice a man the angel of God that sent this message specified cancer that nothing would stand before the prayers not even cancer a man brother branham would say again let me just read another little quote and if you be sincere when you pray get them to believe you and be sincere when you pray nothing shall stand before your prayer not even cancer he spoke cancer that's the only disease he said but he specified cancer I want you to know this message has the power against cancer God specifically spoke about it because God knew that that would be something we would come up against and this message will defeat it what message the message of Jesus Christ that the atonement he paid it all and the cancer is defeated at Calvary and it has no right to a believer now I know there are those who want to think that that Zoli was spoken only to brother Branham but that's a lie of the devil hey man if that's true then if that's true in cancer is no more to God than a headache that we don't even have power against a headache Amen Jesus did not designate some Devils he said that believers would cast out Devils in his name ever devil is subject to the name of Jesus Christ anytime a believer uses his name in faith his word said so if you can get them to believe hey man now so we believe that Jesus Christ died for your sickness and your sins and by accepting it on the basis of his shed blood you can grow attributes from it anything you have need of God will give it to you now let's understand all of the power of God lays in his word and the word has specifically spoken against cancer come on we've got the written word that speaks against it in my name you will cast out devils we've got the spoken word through a prophet that - that spoken come on it's the Living Word we got both up we got two wings to fly on it the written word and the living word man and it can lift us above and take us away from any kind of disease or affliction that there is a mouth I've already told you there is a power in this word that will defeat even koban 19 stop the fever right in his tracks hey man it'll stop cancer right in his tracks and I'll tell you we we have put up with the devil long enough it's time for the Church of Jesus Christ to stand to his feet and to realize we have been given authority the word gave us the authority and God is no better than his word if you don't back his words and God is a God he has to give his word now brother Branham told us that God's written word is no less than God himself you can read you know he said you can't rest your faith as I say just upon anything you've got to have some basic fact and that's the reason I can rest my faith upon this word because I believe it to be the Word of God and then if it is the Word of God it is God himself in word form that's right and then if that's God himself and no man is better than his word if I write a declaration here of something that I'll do and now I'm no better than that word is and that word is a part of me it's my word and if this is God's written word it can't be no less than God himself because he's obligated to his word now you believe that now again there it is his written word is God himself when you take that in you are taking Claudia you're taking the power of that in when you speak it out you are releasing the power of that word now again I read this and last Sunday but listen he said let's just believe him that's the death stroke to Satan when a man takes God in his word brother data killed Satan every time that is the hardest ship that Satan can get when a man will take God at His Word hey ma'am yes sir jesus said a man shall not live by bread alone but every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God we are to live we have life by that word now we know that that the battle that we're having here on earth the first battle was ever fought was fought in the heavens Michael and his angels against Lucifer Nate and they had Lucifer and his angels were kicked out of heaven then that great army of the devils and all of his imps fell to the earth now God knew there would be a battle he knows him from the beginning he knew he knows everything that would be ever not that would Betty sire how many I must tell her that to have them all together that they would make but the first thing that Satan did was to come to Eve and try to get her to doubt God's Word he he reasons say yay has God said and he begin to reason and when he broke down that barrier from words he was isolated and hidden behind the word from that moment on Satan won the battle of over over God's people because one of his subjects let the weaker one let down the power right Amen God and fortified her with the word and let me tell you today it is that still the best weapon we got against the enemy is the Word of God there is no greater weapon then it is written hey man now so you see godless God would choose for his army the best weapon that could be given he chose it and he said it's my word my word is the best weapon and he gave his army the best equipment now God can't improve right he can't change he can't change his mind he can't he can't improve on what he does so he gave the best to start with now no matter how many things Satan's get and the N or how many things that other army gets Satan's army it can never nothing will change God's Word is still God's first choice to to defeat the devil with a man now gifts do not defeat the devil brother branham's gift did not defeat the devil the word defeated the devil a man whether you've got the people to believe in the word that's when the devil was defeated if we can get the Bride of Christ to believe in the word that was over and over and over proved and vindicated that's when she'll start defeating Devils which he'll start taking the word and confessing that and believe in that now using it against the devil now so again but you see what the devil does is try to get you to disbelieve your weapon to believe that it's not gonna work he'll talk you out of firing your gun he'll talk you into lay him down your weapon if he can take it without a shot he's going to do it but again I want you to get the picture if you believe if he gets you to believe that your weapon is not strong enough he's got you disarmed hey man where you know he can get you to just believe the word that's your weapon he has you defeated and this is why so many are living a life of defeat it's because their faith isn't myth their faith is even in a prophet but their faith is not in the word now brother Branham held up his Bible like this and he says this is God's voice to the people every word of God is a seed and it will produce just exactly like it spoke in the Bible if it's receiving good ground now that's God's voice to his church right here we've already got it's not coming we already have this is God's voice to the church hey man just say it is written Satan here it is written that does it you know because the Word of God will defeat Satan anywhere anytime anyplace amen the written word will defeat him and Jesus defeated Satan by the written word it is written and what he did that far he didn't use his gifts he didn't use his power come on he used the word and he did it so that that brings it to the smallest weakest baby Christian a man no matter how small or how little you are you can say it is written is that right hey man and I'll tell you when he when he come here Satan comes Eddie you know and he said it is written he tries again Cecil stays with the word he tries again Jesus faced with the word it is written it is written as is written hey man he said Satan got enough of that when he kept pouring a word into him just kept pouring the word into him and that's that's what you gotta do is you gotta just keep pouring the word into him every time the devil comes in another way you pour another scripture into him you just tell him again lame hear the word because the word will defeat him a man now when Jesus was here in the fullness of the Godhead bodily you know where when he met the devil as we said he never used cinemas powers yet the father's never spoke anything through him but he never used it he used the father's written word and he never used his power but he used God's word it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God see he defeated the devil on the father's word and he said let me say this now that the Word of God would have beat Satan the devil any time anywhere or any place he'll defeat the devil and the right mizzle attitude towards any divine promise of God will bring it to pass if you can look at it the way God wrote it and accept it in your heart God will make that word become life so now again the right mental attitude it's important that you give your attitude toward the promise right because Satan is gonna come and try to make you think oh it's just something wrote for thousands of years ago it's not for me it is for you a man it's written specifically for this day for this time Jesus wouldn't look in the scripture and his timing to say it's written at me and this is exactly what we do is a word bride in this thing we must look in the word and say it's written of me the Bible said this about me this is my word not a word of dare to go back but I'm the fulfillment of all the word amen now so again that right mental attitude toward any promise will bring it to pass now brother Branham said on the authority of God's although Jesus on the authority in the word he said every word of God is a written sworn Authority if the absolute right of the believer to accept this as infallible proof am an infallible truth because it is God's Word heaven and earth will pass away now we can only give the bride in the same mind an attitude toward the word that Jesus had amen look God did extreme things in our generation to get us to believe the word again look the denomination said it wouldn't work days of miracles are past God doesn't heal anymore come on is that what the church world was saying okay and the church was believing that is that right but God did extreme things to get us to believe the world that the word he is here a man in the form of the Holy Ghost and he would vindicate his word improved his work and he sued us over and over and over that the word will work it will heal it will raise up cripples a man it will make the blind to see it will open the ears of the death it will make Devils of all kinds to flee a man and even brother Brennan said cancers he said that meant more cancers healed under my ministry than any other disease why because God was showing us that you can defeat Satan with the word at anytime anyplace and anywhere under any conditions is that right a man now now God would actually discern the thoughts and intents of the heart using a prophetic gift now who else could do that who else could do that but the word is self Hebrews 4:12 the Word of God is quick that means it's alive somebody catch that the word is alive and it is powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing to even to the binder the dividing asunder of the soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of heart so what we saw was the word the logos the Holy Ghost at work discerning hearts well I knew that myself when I was a little boy and sat there listening brother branham and saw him discern the hearts I knew that men couldn't do that I knew there had to be somebody else present no matter I had that much understanding as eleven-year-old boy what are we understand today he was showing us the word was present it knows you your name your address what the doctor said demo hey man what's gonna happen if he knows you pass he knows your future isn't right it was the word it was performing where it was said to it meant for the word is full of power the word opened the eyes of the blind time to show you what the work did the word healed the sick the word raised the dead the word casts out Devils the word went forth and healed them the Bible said he sipped his word and healed him He healed him by the word amen now it's the word performing wherever said to listen I know every time that I have prayed for anybody it wasn't anything that I did it wasn't my hands it wasn't the way I laid my hands it wasn't something I reached him there and pull out the sickness or or this disease or or did anything I didn't do anything but speak and it was the word that cast out the devil it was the word that healed the sick and I'm trying to show you the power of the word in the word there is power to heal to deliver to set free and what God was doing was showing us his word is present because he would come a time with brother Branham wouldn't be present but the word still present hallelujah now gonna make a shout today - no we're not here left alone during this time hey man we've got the word and the word was cats out Devils it rebuke Satan he be overcome in power he will heal the sick it will rebuke cancers by the word now is the word perform him where it was said to do for the word is full of power it's the same spirit that was in Jesus the word that is present again in the church in this last age oh listen to that I'm reading from the church age book let me just back up again so you catch it I want you to hear the using the authority of a prophet speaking it is the word it is performing wearing - it is sent for it is a word is full of power it is the same spirit that was in Jesus the word that is present again in the church in this last age as a last sign trying to head people off from gentlemen for they that reject him the word are already come into the gentlemen crucifying him afresh so I want you to understand this isn't sucker what the discernment was far it was to show us Christ is present he is here what forms here in His Holy Spirit which is the word am the beginning wants to learn the Word was God his Holy Spirit not God yes it's God so the word is here in the form of the Holy Spirit is that right and he's here dwelling in human vessels the word made flesh again the word in his people Christ in you the hope of glory now you know you see people are looking for a savior for Messiah and brother branham would say this about this since the world as he said the world is falling apart he said what kind of what about the church what kind of Messiah is the church looking for today you the churches tried that the loudest we're humming about a messiah what are we hollered revival in our time back this that of the other what are they looking for to do it what more do you want what does the church want anyhow we've already got it who God gave it to us is his promise for this hour and we look in the Bible and we see everywhere to the Bible anointed ones came on to men made that word live again right in the hour for that hour and we've got the Messiah this is him the world in the beginning was the word the Word was with God the Word was God in the word remains God Hebrews 13 and 8 the same yesterday today and forever we know what's supposed to take place in this day and we're one in Messiah and God gave us the Messiah his promised word for this day it's just waiting for somebody with faith to ignore Nick and make it live again hallelujah so we've already got it looking for somebody to rise up some great Messiah somebody the word is here and that's what we was pointed to is back to the world back to the scripture back to the Bible he said but the church sits spiritually dead gone the hours passed them they're in a slump they hardly know what to do one run this way and one that way and here every promise that God made in the Bible every one of us lay in here they're just as good as they ever was this hour what makes the church like this we're in the age of Laodicea when she has to come this way this is the hour for it so Laodicea calls his people to what a man to be slothful and meant to fail to recognize their day and now what God did for us he restored back to us the word yeah we had a Bible but but we was covered with men's theology Amen but God restored us back to what Paul preached I'm and so therefore we should look exactly in this work in this work than his healing deliverance salvation everything now notice brother madam said again that these signs of wonders of so in the past future what should be and what has been and all about was a vindication of the approaching Messiah don't we realize what the sign was about don't we realize what the the gift of discernment was about it was to show us the word is here that this is the word that this word will defeat your enemy we don't have to look for another message if we can get the people to believe the message the message of the atonement the message that our debt is free I'm Anna paid for I meant that the message that we don't have to be sick anymore that is a healer of our disease and we can get the people to believe it he's waiting for somebody with faith to anoint it and make it live again are you with me now now so again brother Branham would tell us about that sign he says I challenge you to believe this is in the trial I challenge you to believe that Jesus Christ is revealed in the form of sin a man in human flesh through the bride's body I challenge you to believe that amen you know the devil wants to get us to stop with it with something go by and we can have faith that the Son of Man was revealed through the Prophet but let's take it a little further and realize it wasn't about a prophet it was about a bride that was the whole purpose of the message it was not it was not together just send the Prophet it was to call out a bride in this evening time of people who would believe the word now so he said I challenge you to believe that Jesus Christ is revealed and former southern man in human flesh through the bride's body because that's where is being revealed now the word is being revealed in human flesh now let me share this from you with you from patmans vision Paul said that the word came in power as well as voice that is stuff a minute how did the message come to us it didn't wait wasn't just voice come on it came in power the word preached actually demonstrated itself now that's two doctrine true doctrine is different from the doctrine of Pharisees the true word will cast out Satan it will heal the sick it will feel with the Holy Ghost it will give them something more than psychology but to give them a power to live and overcome in life are you with me so again the word preached actually demonstrated itself like a flame and cutting sword it went into the consciousness of man like a surgeon's knife it cut out diseases it's set the captive free everywhere those are early believers when they went preaching the gospel the word and God confirmed the word with signs following the sick were healed the devils were cast out they spoke in new tongues that was the word in action the word has never failed in the mouths of believing Christians and in this last age are you ready for this it is here stronger and greater than ever in the true word pride hallelujah the word in action the word has never failed in the mouths of believing Christians this last sage it is stronger it is here stronger and greater than ever in the two word bride Oh little flock you little minority hold on to the word till your mouth and heart with it and someday God will give you the kingdom hey Matt now this feel your heart with you got to feel your mouth with it now listen brother madam said in the pergamene church shades again believe us he said when Jesus was on the earth he said believe us not that I am in the father that bothered me the words that I speak to you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works john 14:10 but here is most evidently set forth the perfect manifestation of God in the son was by the indwelling spirit manifest an inward and works notices and that's exactly what we've been teaching all along when the bride will get back to being a word bride she will produce the very works that Jesus produced the word is God and the Spirit is God they're all one one can't work apart from the other and if one has truly the Spirit of God he'll have the Word of God that right let's bear olestra let's try the other way cuz he said it won't work apart from the other so what truly has the Word of God he'll have the Spirit of God if one has the Spirit of God he'll add the Word of God is that right that's how it was for the prophets they had the indwelling Spirit of God though the word though the word came to them but how it how it was with Jesus in him with the spirit without measure and the word came to him and Jesus began to both do tshh said my doctor is not my own but the fathers had sent me now so how are we gonna have a pure word bride again if we water it down with and hybrid with creeds and dogmas to the Asians that's what God without the sieve of message of restoration and the restoration was a restoration of the word but with the restoration of the word comes a restoration at the power that's how you know it's the word hey man I mean we're we're calling things today the word and there's no power with it we're calling it we got the to word and there's nothing to heal the sick there's not even altar calls there's not even prayer lines there's no there's no real cry out into the spirit there's nothing oh we got the word that word isn't person it's not a philosophy and when you have the word of Christ you have the works of Christ you cannot have one without the other so a church without the word and you know will will be a powerless Church but the word the church is claiming to have the word and no power are no science no wonder they are also at powerless fruitless Church they're not the pratik Christ the Bride of Christ has both are you with me now so again this this is what God promised that he would again to bring them bring it back he would bring back the power of infallibility so they're showing us that it was Word how many times did that give fail now because it was the word and the word is always right is that right so to prove it was the word it never failed it was over and over and over it was the power of infallible not the brother branham was infallible but that we have the infallible Word of God again as it was perfectly given and perfectly understood in the days of Paul and that means that the church started with the pure word and it ends with the same pure word amen that means we have the same atonement that Jesus is our mediator he is our intercessor we have the same signs with the same Holy Ghost with the same signs and wonders are you with me amen so so again we we remember then that God sends a prophet in this day to do what bring us back to the word again he would tell us it's the word looking through the word I'm not pointing to myself it's not me I'm pointing to is so worried I'm pointing to but we had too many people that ran after the man and send us the message now so brother Brennan said they will hear him as the first church heard Paul and she will mature in the word until becoming a word bride that the mighty works will be found in her there always attended upon the pure word in faith a math now that's true because true doctor is his word with power Jesus doctor astonished him so again we cannot just have the word only we must have the word empowered not you know this is this is why Jesus had faith with his power brother Branham would tell us this in perfect faith he says I can do nothing in myself we all realize that we realize as human being we're just as totally helpless as helpless can be we can do nothing in ourselves but he relied in knowing that he was the word hey ma'am and he had faith in God who made him the word I didn't make myself or she made me the word have you that filling me with the Holy Ghost then I became the Word of God made flesh is that right the word the Holy Spirit living in mid-may flesh o'clock Tabernacle in a human vessel so we rely upon that we are the word hey man no words the devil left hey man come on because the words come defeat the devil any place anywhere any time and this bride is not leaving out of here defeated she's gonna be a victorious Church he had faith in God who made him the word that's why I prayed lace we're not laying I can in myself do nothing I'm not I'm not even looking at myself I'm looking at what he made me I know I can do all things I can overcome I can rise up above come on hey man she had faith in God who made him the word he was God the word and that gave him faith cause he understood his position now understand you and have faith you've got to have faith in your position what the word said you are if he said I'm a son I'm a son I have a right right to whatever divine promise I have a right to healing I'm an heir I have a right to salvation I'm an heir I have a right to the Holy Ghost I'm an heir I have a right to whatever I need I'm an heir is that right Amen he understood his position is really really important that you when you meet the devil that you position yourself first Who am I I'm a son of God how did I get to be this way not by my own choice he birthed me into the kingdom hey man I was born not of the will of man that's even my own will or the will of the flesh but of God and he gave me power to are the authority to become a son by birth is that right and by birth I am a son and that's the Sun I am heir with him and as an heir with him he gives me authority and with that authority I cast Satan out hey Matt so what gave him faith was cause he understood his position he knew what he wants why cuz he was feeling particularly that day really strong now the reason he knew what he was cuz the scripture said he was this so you go looking into the scripture to see what it said about you it said I can do all things through Christ that's treated me it says no good thing when he withhold from them that walk uprightly oh we fell right then because we're not been walking uprightly good enough hunk who can walk good enough book them who can do that I can because my mistakes are covered in the blood so therefore I'm a blood washed blood box of the daughter of God come on and I take my position and I understand my position base of the authority I thus sayeth the Lord God said it a man he knew what he was because the scripture said he was this here ever scripture tidy and to prove he was exactly what the scripture said he would be and he knew what he was now listen Church this is how Jesus knew who he was somebody help me make the connection because we think well Jesus knew he was because while he was just born knowing and he just listened he had ever voice against him he had the adversary whispered in his ears he can look and see his own humanity come on hey man he are you with me Church hey man he had to look in the word to see what the word said about him I don't know what you reading your Bible for but if you are reading it you need to be looking to see what did God say about me this was said of me it is written to me hey man you so while it was written of David yeah it was wrote of David - but but he was speaking of a greater purpose and this is what Jesus could look at he could look back and see the very Psalms of David and he said David got in the spirit of Who I am and he began to speak things concerning me my bones they stare at me right he can say they'll not leave my soul in Hell neither will he left my Holy One see corruption any new I raised in three days why because the word said he would hey man now Jesus knew who he was it didn't matter how he was feeling today whether he was on Mount Transfiguration or whether he's in the wilderness of temptation would ever devil breathing down his neck he knew who he was a man and if he was in the area if he was in a boat about to be sunk or if he was standing before thousands of demons that were in the man screaming at him hey man Jesus knew who he was now you've got to know who you are because you're facing some of the same things demons screaming at you ever voice of Satan hey man do the ways that are coming back to seek your little boat hey man every kind of problem that there is and there may be high points in your life or you're on a long amount of of change or or you're down in the wilderness of temptation matters not you've got to know who you are and you know who you are because what the word said brother Brennan said he relied upon what God had made him this is this is what I do ever 10 that I face a demon spirit the first thing I do is I said well I'm a son of God hey man I was commissioned to cast his devil out so I know it's gonna go because I've been getting an authority over I'm not its servant it's my servant it's got to do what I say if I say go is gotta go if I say you're bound you're bound amen what because you know what God made you as a son and he did that he said did can't we rely about what God made us as believers these signs shall follow them that believe he had faith in what he was and if you're a believer you have faith and what you are you are a believer hey man it's not the right that's it that's exactly the way we were when we were in the hospital with with my wife with a brain bleed it was very dire news news but I stood there with my children and I said your mother's laying there in the ICU room but I said we're not gonna worry and we're not gonna fret we're gonna believe because that's what we do we are believers and believers believe a man a man believers believe and I said so this is what we have been trained for this moment and we are going to believe and I want you to know this is what all the training has been all the study of the message is to get you to believe and we have been trained to believe no matter what is happening we're going to believe because when we believe all things are possible when we believe Satan's gotta go when we believe the word the work amen and the word will not work for an unbeliever the word works for believers hey man these sons who followed them that believe but he said and he said he relied Jesus relied on what God had made him and if he did that then can't we rely upon what God made us s believers these signs shall follow them to believe he had faith in what he was and if you're believer you have faith in what you are you are a believer now it's good to have faith in Jesus certainly we do we have faith that his atonement is true come on we have faith and believe that he casts out Devils then he healed the sick is that right we have faith in who he was but we gotta bring in another step further that just who he was we gotta believe who we are and we are believer and as a believer I have certain rights and I have certain Authority and I have certain powers and I put base in my my authority on the word the word said on this the word said you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost is come upon you while the Holy Ghost came upon you I have the power a man the word said in my name you will cast up Devils well I can use his name might have the authority to use his name these signs have followed them that believe I am a believer how do I know I'm a believer because the Holy Ghost came upon me if I wasn't a believer the Holy Ghost wouldn't come on me so therefore I'm a son and as a son I think my authority I think my place I take my position now the only thing you have to do then is have faith and what you are listen these words these words are this was these words will really give you some real authority and power and and give you a freedom like you never don't did he said for the only things you have to do then is how faith in what you are have faith listen now and what the word said you are you say what brother Tim you know that's the problem I have faith in what I am you know imabelle you're looking at your human side look at your new birth what did he make you as a son or daughter of God he made you an heir he made you an overcomer he made you powerful he made you where you can cast out Devils you can speak with new tongues will you can bind ever demon power it's underneath you it's as your servant it's your slave that devil is your slave I know those are big words to say but I'm saying it anyway the devil is your slave you have a right to tell him he does not have a right to tell you hey man have faith in what the word said you are Jesus had faith in the Word of God that's what he was it was written it is written of me that's what he was it's written to me didn't didn't David in the Psalms and the prophets all speak of them of him I am the bread of life that came from God out of heaven he could look back and see the manna and he said that was me he looked at the rock where water come out that was me he can look at the tree that that made the better water sweet that was me come on he can look at back and he could see everything in the word and he said that's me and that's what you've got to do you've got to look at this word do you see yourself E in it that's why that story of brother Branham talking about John courts you know where where he looked and then into Isaiah 53 and then read his name into it he was wounded for John courts transgression he was bruised for John courts iniquity the chastisement of John courts peace was upon him and by his flights John was healed what was he doing he read his name in the scripture and man it said if I repent and be baptized in his name I received the Holy Ghost the promises to me it's for my children it's for even those that are far off those in a straightaway it's for you too it's for as many as the Lord our God shall call and you put your name in there [Applause] it's important it's it's important it is as important it's putting Jesus name in there now you want to make sure when you're baptized you get Jesus name in there right you're going to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you get your his name in there you know that's important it's important just as important to put your name in there and we get hung up sometimes on just a doctrine of things and we don't see the application of things you've got to put your name in the promise quit putting it off for another age and another time and other people you're the last you're the final voice to the final age there's nobody coming after you somebody with me amen you say he says I am he said he looked and he said there are they all spoke of it he says I am that tree of life from the Garden of Eden I am all these things I am that I am he knew that with perfect faith that he was anointed Messiah that the Spirit of God was upon him and he said now in myself I can do nothing but my faith is in God and God lives in him the word made manifest and when that word of God comes into you is made manifest for you our believer and the unbeliever is the faith of God that moves in you so so again he knew who he was in the scripture so his faith made him act upon the scriptures that pertained to his own life oh listen brother branham said in Christ's a mystery he said if the church only knew its position it will one day and then the rector will go when it knows what it is and the whole message was about you it was more than guts in a profit but it's about you hey man it's about God either people died in the universe God in his son God in his people and that's what we gotta see it as God and that's Christ in you the hope of glory we're here to fulfill what is written we'll read this scripture Matthew 5 verse 17 let's read this and and and just read along in this trend translation but he said do not think I've come to abolish the law or the prophets I didn't come to abolish but to fulfill for truly I say to you until the heavens and earth pass away not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass from the law until all is accomplished whoever then and knows one of the least of these Commandments and teaches others to do the same to be the least in the kingdom shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven but who's whoever keeps and teaches them he should be called great in the kingdom of heaven so now again if we look at Jesus said don't think I've come to abolish the law I come to fulfill it so Jesus didn't abolish or know the law or the prophets but to fulfill them he was the law the word of the law and the prophets made flesh now let me bring it down now they're opening of the seals made the Bible a new book - brother Branham it was not to make the Bible obsolete but a new book about suing that there is a bride here to fulfill what is written you see we get the wrong impression with it we we begin at noses could it doesn't at all the scripture it doesn't abolish the scripture if it is there to make the book new why new because he was cluttered up with every kind of man's idea and thinking and man we looked at it with theology but God gave us a new look afterward a man without the blue without the glasses of denomination come on a man showing showing us Yunus then it is a new book to us it's not an obsolete but it's made new - brother madam said how can we put our confidence in this written word of God because it's so inspired and that every phrase of it never fades of it hangs together and it's drawing a picture for us of God what God was and what God he is and always will be now Jesus was neat when he was here he would realize that he was here to fulfill the word and that's what we got to realize today we are here for the fulfillment of it so yes David at his part but I'm here to fulfill that part David killed Goliath and he was only speaking of and given faith for time with it men and women with meat their own Goliath I prevailed what David wrote come on Jesus could look and say I am here to fulfill to manifest what was typed out for me and that's why we are here we are here to fulfill what was written of us so how are you gonna know what is written unless you search the Scriptures daily to see what the word said about you if you sit go look what the word said I am the Lord God that healeth all that diseases I will put none of these diseases upon you that also speak volumes to you right now that the Lord has not put this disease upon you the devil did and if the devil did it we got a right to make him move come on because the Lord didn't do it diseases and afflictions are at the devil we got as much right to tell him to go as Jesus did and so Paul did as Peter did come on we got as much right to use the word because they were only promised sign of us Jesus was the manifestation of the written word and that's what the bride would be if we were bride Devon saith why are we letting Satan and his sickness rule us even brother Branham asks a question if God be with us where are his miracles so what is matter you know the god of this evil age is fried to turn this supernatural gospel this endtime message into a powerless religion into just an intellectual theology oh this is exactly what the god of this evil age does listen brother madam said this and God to this evil age she's caused the whole world to accept the scientific leadership of the educational program that Satan has given her on the name of a church the leadership of an educational scientific program I'm pitching to you that god of this world and I'll tell you it describes him many many message churches today I an educational scientific program turning the word into a powerless religion which he is Eve had the very feeling of God's Word in their hand to do that instead of teryan for the baptism of the Holy Ghost let science prove to her that the Holy Ghost was only for the disciples instead of keeping divine healing going now listen would she ought to be now raising the dead doing great miracles she has let Satan under his leadership a religious man take the Word of God and try to say it was for another age and she's believed it well I'll tell you we won't even we don't even want to call prayer lines or altar calls and deliverance has been withheld from the people by a powerless theology but we got the seals not brother Tim it's a higher knowledge the seals only opened us the gospel of Jesus Christ is fall priest and it didn't come and we're down a and the power was not just for the Brotherhood brother Branham it was far a word pride hey man oh my brother Branham said in the church age book and try to wind down and close with this the evidence that are receiving the Holy Ghost today it's just the same it was back in the days of our Lord it's receiving the word of truth for the day in which you live jesus never did stress the importance of works as he did the word he knew if the people got the word the works would follow that is viable so there again we're talking about word word word word we got the word than words the works because it's the true word that works has got to follow the word amen again brother Branham talked about this in the perk of me of age and he said now Jesus knew there was gonna be a terrible drift away from the word and the permian age which Lass's yet two hundred years off from the from the Patmos vision he knew that terrible the drift that would cause him to go into the dark ages he knew that the way that man originally got away from God was my first leaving the word if you leave that word you have left God thus he presented himself to the church at Pergamos indeed all the churches of all ages I am the word if you won't DD in your myths then welcome and receive the word don't let anyone or anything get between you in that word that's what I am giving you the word is a revelation of myself I am that word remember that and then he says I wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst are we sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst let me give you a thought here said how do we pray we pray in Jesus name do it don't we every prayer is in his name there isn't any answer yet in 1st John 5:14 we're told this is a confidence we have in him if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us and if we know that he hears us whatsoever we ask we know we have the petitions that we have desired of God now we asked what is the will of God there's only one that way to know his will and that is by the Word of God lamentations 337 who is he that saith come at the pass when the word when the Lord commanders it not there it is if it is in the word you can't have it so we can't ask unless it's in the word and we can't petition or ask unless it's in his name there it is again Jesus the name is the word the wheel you can't separate God in the word they are one is everybody with me yet now this word that he left behind on printed page is a part of him when you accept it by faith into a spirit-filled life he said his word is life there it is he is spirit and he is life that's exactly what the word is that's exactly what Jesus is he is the word so when a spirit born spirit filled man in faith takes the word into his heart and place it in upon his lips why it's the same as DD speaking every mountain has to go Satan cannot stand before that man hallelujah and neither will it stand before this word bride in this last day because she is the word with signs following them that believe a man what he God return us to the word what it receives the word what is here this morning the word what did the word sell it put position yourself there I am a son of God I am NOT a sinner I don't belong to the world I can't overcome this I can ride somebody he said I could he said they they've got overcometh and I know I'm gonna overcome let the musicians come a man he said I would he said this is what I would do his promise lays in the work the works that I do shall you do also we can't have the word without the works we don't have to preach the worse we preach the word and the signs will follow the word and when the true word gets preached again come on not this theology not to stop of hate the same not the stuff that he doesn't he like he did not the stuff it was only for back then 40 50 years ago we gotta get back to the word a man and realizes God's will for every individual to be well and from when his conditions are met and his word is believe it's going to happen there's no maybe in your case it's not you listen if it's maybe four but one is maybe for everybody a man if God will heal anyone he'll heal you healing is the children's bread what would her father withhold his bread from one child and give it to another we got evidence right here there's a ladder she ate the children's bread she was healed why would God withhold that from another child of God it's over doll and there's enough breath and in vain enough breathing he still multiplies it come on he'll supply all your knees listen sickness and diseases is claiming a terrible toll on people's lives we've got medical science that demonstrated some of the greatest achievements yet at the same time disease persist ravages human lives around the world people are dying right now the tragedy is these sicknesses and diseases are affecting the bodies of thousands of Christians real believers children of God yet we got preachers and teachers influenced but their traditions their theology that can offer them a little more than sympathy or pity that's all they do well must be God's will it'll work out for the best God's teaching me a lesson in humility maybe it's just God's chastisement or you're getting drawn closer to God cuz he works his wheel through our life through sickness all of them are lies they're excuses for powerless religion brother Branham didn't preach those why should we preach them we don't have to be sick we have a healer I'm gonna say it you don't have to be sick any more than you have to be sinful it's always God's desire to save you it's God's desire to heal you why is it why is it why is it here in this new covenant why is it with the message in this day that we're letting the enemy Ren wrap it over us why is it and we're just sittin until we die would you just remember when Israel left out of Egypt he proclaimed I am the Lord God that heals all your diseases and the Bible said there were three million that became well and strong come on the Bible said there wasn't there wasn't a a weak one among them is that right a man but you see it's when we changed God to I was instead of I am or we changed he will be and we hear it all the time when the bride gets her power where would she get her noisy she is the Anointed One the Spirit of the Lord is upon me he has anointed me to preach the gospel to bind up the brokenhearted to to set the captives at liberty amen he healed the sick to open the islands of the by the anointing is here it's the Holy Ghost you Sam receive power after the Holy Ghost is come upon you why are we waiting for the power when the power is already here why have we let theology take us back to attention Christ religion come on somebody or just to a Baptist profession of God can but god but God won't but he can if it be his will it is his will he wrote it in his will if under the old cumin there's three million people could be well at one time then how many people can be well today living under the New Covenant when we've been pointed back to the original atonement where Jesus paid for our sins and our sickness we got a covenant that is on a better promise with a better priesthood to a more excellent ministry it's high time we begin to realize we're the word and we've expressed the word instead of expressing all these other doubts and confusion and unbelief start declaring start by today declaring who you are declaring what the word said declaring every spirit is underneath him declaring that by my god he has made me to run through a troop and leap over a wall declare it not more than a conquerer to him that loved me declare it then he wants us to walk in perfect health in peace that I would that you would be in health even as your soul prospers start declaring what the word said about you stop prama can't claim on that promise start expecting it in the church begin to think put on the mind of Christ because the Antichrist coming in with his lies trying to make us powerless trying to make us disbelieve our weapon get back into the Word of God and begin to see what he made the promise for I will perform my good work towards you and bringing you back to this land and I'll restore to you the years of the cankerworm the palmer worm the caterpillar that great army that was sent to you but i will restore sayeth the lord and i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh and you open up your own life and say lord pour that spirit out into me and fill me with that holy spirit and with a faith and a resolve to believe the promise for myself put my faith back in the authority of the word what did it say about me a man let's stand together right now wherever you are your faith can touch you touching Jesus is all that really matters then your life will never be the same there's only one way to touch him start believing when you call on his name the Bible said if we call on the name of the Lord we shall be saved is that true or isn't it true then if we call on him right now we're going to be delivered we call on his name put yourself in that problems right now want you to put it in there he said I'm healed me and I say I'm healed he said I'm saved so I'm saying what he said he said I'm delivered I'm saying that I'm delivered I'm accepting the word of promise right now for my own he made a promise to me and they cannot return to Him void it must accomplish what he sent it to do and I'm looking to him right now and I want you to reach out and touch him right now and believe him would you reach out your hand to him right now and just believe by faith right now that I'm not gonna be the same I'm not gonna be the same hey man there's gonna be a change stuck we begin right now cuz I put my faith in the word in the authority of the word I know who we are as children of God we have been born by spirit we have been washed by his blood there's not a sin in our lives we stand blameless not rather the blood of bulls and goats but of the blood of Jesus and I'm speaking to you right now wherever you are I don't care maybe cancer that matter this message address cancer specifically you got a bow to the name of Jesus every disease every sickness everything beneath it and the name of Jesus I bind it and I command it to leave the bodies of believers everywhere the Tormentor is tormented God's people long enough I journeyed in the name of the Lord and lead them and commanded to go taking the authority of God's Word what he made me as a son and claiming the promise of God I say Satan you take your hands off of God's problem leave them in the name of Jesus you dowdy not believe in spirit and leave them where that they can believe the Word of God right now in Jesus name the signs follow them that believe and the word is preached and the word delivers in the name of Jesus Lord I'm asking that you bless your people today everyone under the sound of my horse may they receive of that promise right now for their own selves and in their lives for their loved ones for their needs in Jesus name Amen Oh [Music] we'll never be the same there's old [Music] to touch here [Music] when you go it's a oh Jesus [Music] Oh
