them wisdom and leadership as they go through some tough things I'm sure Lord is to make arrangements just ask Lord you guide them and direct them we pray bless our time together we ask it in Jesus name amen amen let's turn to Genesis 4 Amen in verse one says and Adam knew Eve's wife and she conceived and be Cain and said I've gotten a man from the Lord and she again bear his brother Abel and Abel was a keeper of sheep but Cain was a tiller of the the ground and in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord and Abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof and the Lord had respect un Abel and to his offering but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect and Cain was very wroth and his countenance fell the Lord said unto Cain why art thou wroth and why is thy countenance Fallen if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well sin lith at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him and Cain talked with his Abel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel's brother and slew him and the Lord said unto Cain where is Abel thy brother and he said I know not am I My Brother's Keeper and he said what hast thou done the voice of thy brother's blood crith unto me from the ground amen we'll let you be seated this evening amen just kind of getting over a cold that I've had for few little bits and about sick of it amen amen but uh we're just going to give our body and our voice to the Lord tonight and allow him to do what he Wills with it I'd like to speak to you on faith in the blood amen Faith In The Blood we we read here about a very one wonderful passage in the scripture of how life began and how things begin to take place and of course we as message Believers been taught of the different uh Mysteries that's hidden hidden in this very verse but I just want to speak about the blood and and and the offerings that Cain and Abel G gave for just a few moments you know Cain as as we read is was just as religious as Abel was uh he he gave an offering amen matter of fact the scripture calls his name first and his offering is he came to give the offering but uh Cain offered an offering just the same as Abel offered and he built a a place just the same as Abel did Cain got down on his knees and cried out to God and worshiped just the same as Abel did uh Cain did not sacrifice of course the same as Abel did but cuz one came with an intellectual conception he brought the flowers and the fruit of the field and made his offering and his altar beautiful it was an intellectual thing and a but Abel by faith chose a lamb for it was blood amen it was blood that that God required and he drugg him to a rock and hammered his little throat into he bled to death and God said that's righteous AEL why because by Revelation he had by Revelation he brought his offering to the Lord not by intellectual conception but Cain wasn't an Infidel he wasn't an unbeliever he he believed in God he he was a Believer there was something there in his heart that wanted to believe he had a heart of belief inside of him he was religious he was a Believer he came up and built an altar he came to church on a Wednesday night just like Abel came to church on the Wednesday night amen he was religious but Cain's Faith was in the wrong thing Cain's Faith was in his ability Cain's Faith was in what he had done himself he had he had come he had tilled the ground he would learn how to grow vegetables how to grow flowers how to even uh bypass the curse as it were in some ways that God had put upon the Earth you know God had cursed the ground he had cursed the the soil he had cursed everything thing there but Cain by his intellectual abilities had learned on his own his own ways how to grow fruit and how how to Wi to plan and what not to plan in certain times and what to do at certain times and so here he came and he by his learning and his ability he made an offering unto the Lord but that was not what God wanted God does not want our abilities he wants he wants us amen he does not want uh what we have as as our intellectual conception but God wants us us upon the altar amen that's what brother Brandonwood said he said amen he said altars were not made for flowers or or pretty things altars were made for us to lay upon them and so but C but Abel by Revelation by faith offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice nothing clean about it as far as humanly speaking it looked very ugly it looked very dirty it looked very uh put off I don't know if you've ever participated in killing an animal but it's not really a wonderful thing to do we do it sometimes out of Necessities or out out of out out of out of eating H you know to eat or to do whatever amen but if you make a wrong shot or if you don't do something exactly right it ain't a pretty scene amen it's not it's something that tears at your heart if you got any heart inside of you amen I as we've probably spoke about it before but having a a farm you know and we would raise animals to sell but some of them we'd raise them for meat and so it was sometimes my my my my choice or Not by my choice but my lot to go and shoot the animal and listen I wanted to make sure I made a good shot I didn't want him Belling I didn't want him making a bunch of Racket and flopping all over the ground or blood flying everywhere I want him to take the shot fall down and that was it that's just the way it was but this was not what happened Abel brought his lamb and he brought it and he laid it there upon the altar now he didn't have a 22 or or a nice rifle to put up to his head he had a little door old Rock Amen there a little Flint stone that he had laid there he had found and he laid this Altar and he this this lamb upon the Altar and he laid him there and he be to hack at his throat and and it wasn't pretty sight it was a very nauseous sight if you could look at it in the way if I could paint a good enough picture for you tonight it wasn't Hollywood it was something that was real it was a animal laying there and it was screaming for its life and it was Belling out and God looked at this and said this is righteous Abel now according to the world that would be animal cruelty that would be all kinds of other things but God knew that it was blood that took them out of the out of the Garden of Eden it was going to take a greater blood to bring them back into the Garden of Eden and this is where Abel was and it was a bleeding and dying it was a horrible sight amen but God was very pleased with it you excuse me got this stuff in my broke amen so but he offered he offered this this sacrifice and and what was it it was by Revelation he seen that God required blood and and God required something more than our own abilities or our own understanding listen amen when you come to the house of God God wants more than your abilities he wants more than what you have done or what you can do sometimes you don't feel like doing anything you're just right God doesn't want what you can do anyhow he wants what he is already done Amen to be manifested in your life but Cain knelt down and he worshiped God he you know he had a membership he had an altar he had a sacrifice he worshiped God if God only requires you to go to church to be a believer and put your name on the book and pay tithes and worship God Cain was just as just as Abel was and God should be condemned for condemning Cain if that's the case amen but God required more God required blood God required life amen to be laid upon the altar God requires more than our works he requires more than just our lifting of hands out of a d you know we we don't we don't lift our hands out of a out of a Duty it ought to be out of worship unto God we don't come to church because it's just our Christian Duty we ought to come to church because it's out of a life laying our life down upon the altar to worship God Amen if God only requires you to do these things then Cain was just as just but God requires more see Revelation faith is not what he had done but faith in what the blood could do that's what we have to have is faith in what the blood can do and here he comes with this little lamb he had picked out of the flock and he had a grap Vine around his neck and and you know you know well H how how could he how could he do this how could he put him on the alter how could he hack at his throat how could he watch all that happen it was by Revelation knowing that 2,000 years later there was going to be another lamb led to an altar there you go and that blood was going to be shed and that blood was going to be spilled upon the ground amen it was by Revelation Here Comes him with this lamb you know maybe it was a some type of rock and he throws him back his neck back and he begins to hack at this neck and blood begins to sply and blood begins to squirt out and it begin to get all over the Altar and all over Abel and all over everything that was around them amen listen when Cain brought his fruits and he brought of his abilities and what he had done it was so beautiful it was so wonderful it looks so great just like churches today they look so beautiful they look so wonderful listen we want to be more than just a beautiful church we want to be more than just a beautiful people that sits on beautiful pews and has a beautiful sound to our singing but we want blood in our worship that's right we want the the spirit of God moving through our lives but here he comes Cain just glorifying God in his Beauty look what I've done Lord you know my heart but look what I've done I'm here giving you praise I'm doing this and I'm doing that look what I've done and Abel took the lamb and he throws it back like that and he gets a rock in his hand and begins to chop top at his little throat if a man's ever heard a lamb die bleeding bleeding I can see Abel's hands become bloody I see the white wool hanging on that little lamb bloody and God looked down and said that's it you got it that's it you got it what did it speak of of some 19900 years later the Lamb of God that would be lay down a road down to gol gotha and they would beat his body until was almost unrecognizable they would nail him through with nails and his hands and his feet and he would be stuck there between heavens and earth oh the Rock of Ages cried out in an unknown tongue Eli Eli the lamb was speaking in an unknown tongue to who to the sacrificer here he was speaking out to the sacrificer here there's bleeding out who to who to Abel the blood was speaking out and here he comes 2,000 years ago and he begins to speak out in unknown tongues what was it again the blood that was speaking out amen God's provided sacrifice there was Faith there's the faith that was once delivered to the church amen the blood of the Lamb of God that was slain before the foundation of the world now bleeding out now crying out now speaking out and saying it's finished yes sir it is finished it is over with I have waited for this moment and here I am hanging Between Heaven and Earth amen and my blood is coming down my body and is falling down upon the ground what was it it was the life of God being poured out upon the Earth so he can redeem the Earth from the curse yes sir and so he can release a spirit of God to come inside of you Amen to release you from the curse of your Earth amen that you could be set free tonight to rise above sin and to rise above sickness and to rise above depression and every kind of other thing amen we can see this blood as it would begin to be required all the way down through time all the way down through the from Genesis all the way down there was sacrifices that had to be made there was things that had to be done and we can look in we can look into Egypt as as it would type be a type of us in the first Exodus and now we are in the last Exodus and there was all in that time there was a requirement for blood amen there was a requirement for blood I me knows the Story come on Amen here here it's required says know when when I see the blood I'll pass over you amen it required blood and here here what was God doing he was making a way again Amen to protect his people he required blood to bring them out out out out of out of the Garden of Eden not not take their lives not their blood so he found a a replacement he could have took a a Adam's blood he he could have killed Eve but he found something that could take their place and he killed a lamb and he sacrificed it and he tore off the skins and he put it around their naked bodies and they walked out of e eeden what was it God found the way to protect his people that's right and here he comes again and here in the first Exodus and it requires blood what was it God finding a way to protect his people cuz there was a death angel that was coming through amen and here they are everything's black and dark you said you talking about a horrible night Hey listen we thought covid-19 was something to go through what about this night amen when they knew the death angel was coming through and if they didn't have the blood on the doorpost he was going to come in and smite the first born could you imagine the pressure they had to be under cuz they had to find a certain kind of lamb and it' be a certain kind of way and they had to do it a certain kind of way and they had to take his up and put it up on the door in the lentil and if they didn't follow all those steps amen the the death angel had a right to come into their house come on could you imagine the pressure the father was under could you imagine the pressure the firstborn was under did we do it all right did we did we dot our tees did we cross did we dot our eyes and cross our tees did we do everything right father am I going to be okay I'm a firstborn in our family I can imagine the fear that would have been in my heart come on hey you middle children y'all get all down and depressed cuz you're a middle child you've been all right that night amen but the firstborn was going to die amen he had had the pressure upon Him amen but what but the father amen he knew I studied what the prophet said i' done what he said do and and you go out there and you just look on that doorpost I can promise you I applied it like he said apply amen we're going to eat it like he said eat it we're going to cook it like he said cook it come on is there any other fathers that can say the same thing tonight I study what the prophet said yeah there's a death angel that's going through the land again amen but I've studied what he said and I've seen what he's he's required in this age for me to do had to be a lot of faith in a few Stripes over a door had to be a lot of faith to do what he said do I mean what if what if they didn't I mean they could have had a pile a bucket they could could have killed the lamb and they could have put all the blood in a bucket and had it sitting inside the door it wouldn't have done a bit of good it it it had to be applied it had to be done exactly as a prophet said to you had to have faith and he said this little boy well he goes down the window he looks out daddy you know that little Egyptian boy I played with there's two black wings hanging over his home there's his mother in the street she's screaming my baby's dead my first born and he grabs his daddy daddy don't you care for me don't you know that I'm your first born he said I can see that father just as calmly take his little boy by the hand and walk him over to the door and say son you see that blood you see that blood that's on the lle you see that blood that's on the door but daddy what's that got to do with it son that's God's promise he said just get all get all the pressure away from you cuz he said when I see the blood I'm going to pass over you that's God 's promise so those wings that you see there won't come inside of here that little boy goes to the window again and says daddy here he comes but the father was just a busy with something else he wasn't even worried about it why cuz he had done what the prophet had instructed to do and the angel moved towards the door but when he saw the blood when he saw that the price had already been paid he passed right by that house Hallelujah let's just read about it in Exodus 12 and verse 13 and the blood shall be for you a token upon the house where you are and when I see the blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt so there was a promise given when I see the blood I will pass over you I won't take your life brother Brandon brings it right into the today says here we are now living in those shadows and the Wrath is ready to strike and God is requiring something of us it's a token come on now it ain't literally going and killing now killing an animal and finding you know a good sheep or a good goat somewhere and and killing it and doing all these things and getting the hiss up which is Faith and applying it that's not literally anymore but it's still happening amen because why we're not we're not depending upon the blood of sheeps and goats anymore we're depending upon the blood of Jesus Christ but that g blood of Jesus Christ you can speak about it you can talk about it you can think about it you can look upon it amen you can have a little uh vile of it sitting in your closet but unless it's applied to your life that's it unless it's put by faith over the doorpost of your heart that's right then the death angel has a right to you come on now see the animal life in that day could not return back it couldn't come back the blood had to be placed over the door upon the lentil so they couldn't literally they wasn't putting it up their heart because that's not the kind of blood that they dealt with in that day it had to be put over the lentil up on the post and every passor by the whole public everybody coming by the house knew there was a sign on that door come on it's still supposed to be happening today there ought to be enough blood applied to your life it doesn't take very many qu questions to know if you're a Christian or not amen there ought to be a sign over here that blood has been applied this is what happened when they went into into the promised land and there was a there was a harot there by the name of Rahab and she had a sign over her door that she was a harlot come on and they came to her to find refuge and they came there and they she hid them and she said look I've heard about your god I've heard about what's been done I've heard about what happened at the Red Sea and I'm telling you everybody around here scared to death of your God they said well I tell you what since you have done this for us you take take that scarlet cord that you let us down with and you hang it from your door yes from your window and and you bring everybody you can inside of your house you and your house will be saved what was it it was a changing of the sign yeah come on somebody one day she had a sign of a heart and the next day she had the sign of the blood hanging over her body amen this is what you have to have in this time you might one day had a sign of somebody was under fear or under anxiety or under some devil of hell but I'm telling you there's a blood that can be applied to your life and we can have faith in that blood and all of a sudden one day it came to pass that everything around her was shaking and falling down at the sound of the Gospel Hallelujah but there was a bloodline there was something hanging from her window that kept her safe during the time of turmoil come on somebody if you apply that same blood to your life everything around you might be shaking everything around you might be falling down but you will [Applause] remain cuz there's a blood there's a token it's a life of the lamb now when this lamb of our lamb when he died now that life can come back upon the believer we believe that you say well I got the token you in pornography you do not have the token well I just ask for forgiveness well you're just living in a Justified State maybe a Sanctified state for a little while come on but if you got the token that means your sign done changed come on now you ain't no more in pornography you ain't no more Harlot no sir we go come on you ain't no more in sin and iniquity oh you might make mistakes yes you have this Humanity absolutely but you will not practice sin it will not be in your practice to sin and to do things wrong right it'll be a blood over your life it was a show as a show that shed blood of the Lamb the life of the Lamb has returned back that's what me filled with the Holy Ghost means means the blood's been applied to your life amen the animal life you know couldn't come back on the believer because it was an animal it only spoke of a conscious showing that there was to come a perfect sacrifice but it was not a perfect sacrifice it can only cover sin we we we're we're Believers we're me mess students I know we know this amen but that blood can only cover sin the sin was still there and then then then the spirit of God could Ascend on somebody but then it would descend it go back up and descend and go back up like David amen as he would have it get under the anointing of the Holy Ghost go out there and slow slay all kind of Philistines Giants and everything else and then go commit adultery come on that's somebody hasn't been converted he could not be converted during that time he could not be filled with the Holy Ghost not inside of his life he could have a blood he could offer a sacrifice and it would cover his sin but it could not annihilate that sin it couldn't do nothing about that sin that sin's nature was still on the inside of him but there came a perfect sacrifice that's the difference we are not living under the blood of bulls and goats so we're not in to practicing of just covering sin and still living with sin we're not just covering adulteries or covering pornography or covering this or covering that no we have a blood and we have faith in that blood that that life can now come inside of a Believer and not just cover it but annihilate [Applause] it so animal life could not come back because it was an animal but how could there be a more perfect sacrifice than God himself becoming the atonement when God was made flesh in his own creative blood the only way the life of God could ever come back because all of us was born by sex every last one of us therefore the life that was in there of is of the world and that life will not stand it's the thing that's already judged and condemn you can't patch it up there's no way to patch it up you can't patch this old life up that's what problem is too many believers they patch too many things up there's no way to smooth it all out there's no way to make it better this life has to die amen it has to die that's the only requirement there is that's why it's not about bringing your fruit it's about bringing yourself and lay yourself upon the altar it's no more about bringing a lamb and putting him there it's about you coming and laying yourself upon the Altar and saying God take me out I not my will but thy will be done it's got to die so the life of Jesus Christ can come into you which is the Holy Ghost God's token that you have accepted the blood of his son Jesus Christ that's the only way that you can say you've you've you've accepted his blood is you have the Holy Ghost well I I accepted this message is truth you you can do that the devil believes and trembles well I I I accept that it's a good thing to go to church the devil goes to church too matter of fact he's more faithful than most of us he never misses we can have all these things right but if we're not careful we're not nothing but a bunch of cans or bunch of righteous Pharisees come on we're all built up in our righteousness of how we got the message we got the truth we got this we got that but meanwhile our hearts are full of every Darkness our Spirits are full of every kind of unclean thing amen it's is we're we're in the moments of the death angel coming come on we're in the Third Exodus everything parallels through every Exodus there's a prophet there's an angel there's a killing of children check check check amen there's blood check check check come on Amen there's all of these things these parallels amen through every every Exodus there's the death angel that comes in and requires a life right and he's coming again in this hour and we got to make sure that we have the blood it ain't the blood if you got nothing but just a church anity or or you know why I sing I lift my hands I got this you got you got some blood in the bucket come on come come on we want more than blood in the bucket we want blood in lives in Souls of men and women amen have been changed for the glory of God Amen so therefore amen the the Death Angel is coming but there had to come a body of our Lord Jesus Christ That Could Break Forth water blood and spirit so the whole church the bride amen has been again brought through justification and sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is the token do do you know what a token how many knows what a token is a token is something that tells you the price has been paid right for for for this this price has been paid so this one can go to wherever if you want to go fly on an airplane you got to buy a token you got to have a ticket it's got to have your name on it it's got to have your identity on it it's got to you can go up there with brother Joe's identity all you want to you're not getting on that plane come on somebody amen you can go with Grandpa's Identity or this Identity or that one you're not going to get on that airplane but when you go up there and show amen the price has been paid for me I have a right to get on that airplane that's right I have the identification I have the price that's been paid I have a right to be on that plane that's why we cannot go as grandchildren you're not going to go in a Rapture with somebody else's identification you're not going to go on in a Rapture with somebody else's experience your daddy could have it your grandfather could have it your uncles everybody else you got to have your all yes sir you got to have that home moment with Jesus Christ to where he comes in and he changes everything about you and now you're identified with him the church church has to receive the token of the baptism of the Holy Ghost the blood that's been shed and that the Holy Ghost is upon you without it then you will not raise amen it takes the blood amen remember Israel came through many things but it was at the evening time when the token was required not in the morning not in the preparation of the 14 days of keeping of the Lamb Israel knew something was coming he said so did Luther so did Wesley so did finny so did KNX so did Calvary they knew there was coming a time that the pillar of fire would return back to the church again they knew there would come a time when these things would happen but they didn't live to see it but they were looking forward to it Israel knew something was coming but it was in the evening time in the evening time it shall be light it was in the evening time that the Lamb's blood the token was placed upon the door it's been the lamb all the way through it'll be the lamb all the way to the [Music] end the very Spirit itself is the token the Holy Spirit the blood has been applied to my life to where it's not me that liveth but he that liveth on the inside of me you see inside the blood cell was a life it wasn't if it wasn't the chemistry had no life in it self therefore it could not it could not move but the life came from the chemistry of the blood it formed a cell and it Formed its own cell and then cell upon cell as God would create himself a blood cell and place it inside of an incubator that's all Mary was his blood didn't come from Mary and it didn't come from Joseph it came from God otherwise we have limited Blood come on we have limited blood but it came from from God so they could be a token amen so it could be a greater blood greater than the blood that took them out of the Garden of Eden right amen it was blood through sexual transmission that brought them out of the garden so he would have to bypass that amen bring it by his creative power the spoken word of God be it unto me according Thy word and the blood cell was formed inside of a womb God's creative power yeah his death brought forth this Blood upon the Earth and upon the and released a life amen it wasn't just a brother really bringing us down he's trying to show you it wasn't just a limited blood no not even Limited in the third person of the Trinity yeah this what he says he said it wasn't just in the third person of the trinity but the same person the person amen the Holy Ghost who would come back and continue the work and continues on said in the book of Acts it is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that token that is the sign and we must have it upon our hearts we must have it Upon Our Lives we must have it in our hearts and our beings permeating throughout us saying the blood has been applied to this life and when that token is on display and then when when that is done when that blood has been transferred from his life into your life then the same qualities or power that was in that original blood is now inside of you there's where he came to Peter and when he came to the gate called Beautiful notice how it changed Peter amen was a denier he was all kinds of things he he said he said some bad things he done some bad things he actually quit and he went back fishing but that was pre Holy Ghost I always use this sometimes just to kind of be funny I said sometimes you know Peter he was such a guy he just pulled a sword and whack whack an ear off but really he wasn't aiming at the ear I don't believe I you know sometimes you say well you just got to swing The Sword and Let Jesus put it back together but you got to remember that's pre Holy Ghost come on somebody we're good about swinging the sword saying things doing things but if you ain't careful you realize hey I ain't got what I thought I had amen but here he is now after the Holy Ghost came upon him and he's on the way to the gate called Beautiful and here's a blind there's a lame man laying there begging of arms now Peter didn't no longer he did he didn't say well let me go find Jesus and Jesus wasn't there no more he didn't go let me pray he just said such as I have give I unto thee what he knew was the token or the life that was in Jesus Christ has now been transferred to the believer that's right and now he's walking in the power the same Authority the same realm that Jesus walked walk in why cuz the blood had been applied to his life and it had the same effects yes sir is is why you would say not I will but you say to this mountain that's right you will say to this mountain be thou removed why because he knows that when that token that blood transfusion is taking place and the life of that blood comes into a Believer then the same quantities or the same power the same life is now living through them orchestrating and doing what he demands and what his word declares he would go on the tokens are wonderful probably ought to listen to it every chance you get me one of the Premier messages brother Brown said he would preach he would call a highlight of his ministry the token why because he knew it was going to be important to have it to leave here without it you're not leaving I don't care how long you sit on these pews I don't care how long you believe the message I don't care how long you said brother Brown's a prophit I don't care how long you did any of those things if you don't have the token the life of Jesus Christ on the inside of you come on now it ain't no more a father who can apply it to a build house and he brings everybody under this house and it's going to everybody's going to be okay you're under this house you're under this place no it's under your house he brings it down to the individual has the blood been applied to your life has it been applied to your heart to you when it is he said it is your you are gone you are no more that's pretty that's pretty strong you are no more you reckon yourself dead and the token is what now lives on you is not your life it's his life Paul said the life that I now live he lived a different life than what he once did yes come on that's right we can see it all through the Bible through the New Testament Peter lived a different life than what he first did even when he was walking physically with Jesus he lived a different life than what he first lived Paul lived a different life than what he first lived somehow people get the idea that they can be a message believer filled with the Holy Ghost and still live the same old life you cannot do it it's more about than just reformation and reforming and be being a good citizen and being a good person if you want to be that go be a Baptist go go find to go find a church that believes that it's more than that it's a life has to be changed there has to be a transfusion of your life and your life die and the life of Jesus Christ come on the inside of you but when it does you yourself is gone so what he says you reckon yourself dead it's not me that cry but Christ that liveth on the inside of me there is the identified token that God required our identification the life of our savior in us the Holy Spirit oh what a positive token there cannot be any other token oh my if you can only catch the thought of it if I had the power this morning with words to express and a place in your soul that is on on the end not your ears but your soul you can see the guarantee of it it makes you so relaxed hello that's amazing a it's some quite a word if you can catch the guarantee of this token that if you got the token there ain't a chance you're going to miss a Rapture that if you got the token and you go beyond the grave before the body chain there ain't a chance you're not rising up it is a guarantee it's not the guarantee of the Webster bank or or the Federal Reserve it's not not that guarantee is the guarantee of the bank of Heaven that there's enough power in this token that'll carry you all the way to the Rapture it'll carry you all the way to the body chains and there ain't enough Devils that can turn you around there ain't enough Devils that can make you fall down and stay down and kiss carry on in your unbelief but you'll rise up and you'll continue on and you'll be there and those were there shall remain their bodies shall be changed it is a guarantee yes sir listen when I got a guarantee to get on a plane I'm not sitting there worried about it and it's a plane that may not fly it's a plane that may Crash Boy y'all listening tonight it's a plane that might go down it's a plane that may not have a pilot but I ain't worried about it and it's we're talking about Humanity we're talking about people that make mistakes and we're talking about people that that do wrong decisions and make wrong decisions and I ain't sitting there worried about it hope I PID my ticket hope it's all hope hope I got the funds here I hope I'm going to be to get on this plane no I ain't worried about it none because I know the price has already been paid and I'm holding it in my hand am yes and it's just a guarantee that I have a seat on that plane and it's a plane that may not take off it's a plane that who knows might have all kind of technical issues and it may be hours before it can go anywhere but I ain't worried about it why because I have a guarantee right and we have a guarantee of the Holy Ghost inside of our hearts and we get worried about how all this is going to come to pass how this is going to take place when's the Rapture going to happen how's this going to work out quit worried about it as long as you got the guarantee that's all that matters cuz when it's time for this ship to leave here it's going to leave that's right and you can line every devil up in hell and it'll never stop it from lifting off the ground makes you relaxed when you have had that spirit of God come on the inside of you and you realize it ain't no more you living but it's him that's living in you he says what if you had committed a crime and you're going to be tried at federal court and you knew that if you was found guilty you're going to die you're going to electric chair a gas chamber public execution maybe hung or something Lynch whatever the penalty was you knew you were guilty you knew you were guilty and you must die but if you didn't get some eternity to represent you who could get you out of the thing now you want the best attorney you could have and you getting that attorney was good shrew attorney you'd feel that your case was maybe maybe you a little in your favor you could relax a little bit because you had an attorney but still there would be a question whether this attorney would better change the judge's mind or change the jury's idea if this attorney was enough shrew enough and and knowing the laws that would change that and would plead your case and prove that so you could live but yet in all of his great Authority and great speech he can make and the impression he can put on the judge or the jury you may be in your mind you could maybe relax but there' still be a question right can he do it can he do it but in this case on come on now in this case the judge himself is your attorney hello God became man there was no attorney that could do it they couldn't find one good enough Moses the law the prophets nobody could do it the judge became both jury attorney and judge himself and he took the Justice of the law in his own hands and he paid the price how much more secure can we ever be right Hallelujah he sent his own life back upon you as a witness that he has accepted you how safely yeah though I walk to the Valley of the shadow of death I'll fear no evil for God is with me when he becomes both judge jury and attorney he pleaded our case we were found guilty by his own law and he come and took the guilty person's place that was in the sanctuary he took his sin he took it upon himself and he died and he paid the price and he shed his blood and he gave it back as a token his own life while we are perfect brother brand looks at all of this and he says why we are perfect the case is dismissed thank you Lord come on could you imagine going before a judge and you got all kinds of things and you knew you had done wrong you knew you had made the mistake you knew knew that you had done it all but this judge became your attorney and he looked at you and said the price for your sin for your wrong is already paid case dismissed Hallelujah this was exactly what God did amen you don't have to have a question in your mind can he do it right that's right he's a lord god of heals all our diseases can he do it he forgives all our iniquities can he do it he can save the violent sinner can he do it he can heal the sickest person can he do it I say he can I say he already has I say he's already looked at your case and he said I took it I took your sin I took your sickness I took your diseases I took your problem I took it all and I bore it to Calvary and I've already paid the price case dismissed can you have faith in that blood this evening can you have faith in a blood that'll not just pay for one sin it'll pay for every sin can you have enough Faith In The Blood that'll not just save one sinner it'll save every sinner can you have enough faith in the blood that can flow through this building and heal every person here tonight can you have enough faith in the Holy Ghost that can fall in this place and fill with a holy ghost there's the case case dismissed the token is applied the price is already paid it's all already done God came down that was the only way he was going to get us back is he came down thank he came to me though I couldn't go to where he was he came to me that I might go to where he is the token's been applied there's no mistake in this token there's no worry about is there a guarantee of this token there's no worry about is it enough he's a sinless god he's a great God the blood has covered all you say brother Timothy I got a lot of sin there's enough blood to cover it all brother Timothy I got enough I got a lot of sickness I got a lot of issues there's enough blood to cover it all we were not saved by animal blood so our faith is not in a woolly lamb tonight our faith is not some goat Little Goat kid it is not ordinary blood but we were saved by the sinless Spotless Lamb of God come on now I'm trying to I'm trying to turn this just a little bit for a moment amen and get your mind on how great this blood is this blood is not just ordinary blood it's not just blood that's been spelled for thousands of years out of animals and animals blood that you could take every animal in the world it couldn't pay for one human being come on well brother Tim's Used that example several times how how many Admirals would it take to pay for one of these boys there ain't enough animals in the world there ain't enough there ain't enough goats ain't enough sheep you could add them all up it still wouldn't be enough blood it wouldn't be worthy to trade that blood of every animal for one little boy or one little girl so God had to come down and bring his own blood down a blood that had never sin a blood blood that was spotless a blood that was of the Lamb of God this was not ordinary blood that's right this was the blood that crushed the head of Satan this is the blood that broke the chains of sin and death and hell this is the blood not just another man's blood this is the blood of Jesus Christ the son of the L Lamb of God it is the blood that can heal every sick person right it is the blood that can heal the violent Sinner and save him from his sin it is the blood that open it is this Blood I'm talking about that opened the blood of the bles of the blind it cured the sick and the Mame and the feable IT walked on water amen it caled the storms it's a blood that restores oh God there is no mistake there is no sin there is no issue there is no disease there is no devil that is too much for this [Applause] Blood amen there is not enough sin that is too much for this blood so if I was you tonight I would shake off the guilt Hallelujah cuz I got enough blood for every guilty person in here tonight if I was you I'd shake off the sickness cuz I got enough blood for every sick person in the building tonight hallelujah it's enough blood to receive your forgiveness it's enough blood to quit living condemned this is not temporary blood this is the not the blood of bulls and goats your sins are forever forgiven so quit remembering what God has forgot goe all right lay it aside cuz I got enough blood for that forever sin every sickness every sinner every wrong every issue I got enough blood for every family problem I got enough blood the blood of Jesus Christ that'll heal any blood issue handed down through your generational curses there's enough blood when a man sinned he separated himself from God and he crossed a great Chasm and he put himself in death on the wrong side and there was no way back there was no way for him to get back but God accepted a substitute a lamb a goat a sheep or something with blood when he crossed he separated himself from his sunship he was a sinner by Nature he was under the hands and Dominion of Satan God took a sacrifice of blood the blood of bulls and goats it did not divorce sin but it covered it if I got a red spot on my hand here tonight covered it with white white that red spot would still be there it's still there but God sent down from heaven a bleach a bleach it don't just cover sin but when one sin is dropped into that bleach try to find it again the coloring of sin goes back down through the mediators down to the time back to the accuser Satan himself and lays on him till the Judgment where are your sins tonight Church oh if you've asked God to forgive you of your sins where are they at they're laying on Satan that's right that's why he remembers them so well cuz they're always on him they're always tormenting him and he wants to come and say you did this and you did this what sins are you talking about yeah oh you're talking about your sins they're on you you're the one that did this you're the one that caused this you're the one that brought this here in the first place they made back on you and what happens to the son he becomes in perfect fellowship with the father again standing on the other side of the chasm with no remembrance of sin against him anymore there's no more stain or bleach that can be seen or some issue that can be seen he's free Hallelujah and when he's confessed his sin and has been dipped into the blood of Jesus Jesus it kills all symptoms of sin and every molecule of sin goes back to the devil and lays on him to the day of judgment where his eternal destination will be thrown into the Lake of Fire and the chasm is bridged and now there's no remembrance no more and the man stands Justified as a Son of God not guilty he said couldn't you imagine how God could use a man excuse me under the blood of bulls and goats under the BL blood of bulls and goats and have the creative word Let There Be flies let there be this let there be that first thing you know little fly starts flying around then they're piled up everywhere why under the blood of bulls and goats and here we are no longer under the blood of bulls and goat goats we're under the blood of the Lamb yes so where does that place us Church what faith should we have in this blood if if if Moses had enough faith in that sacrifice he could stand there in confidence and say Let There Be flies KN he still had had Desires in his heart KN when there was issues still there but now under this Blood the Nature has been changed and the life of Jesus Christ has been transferred to the Believers you're talking about a transfer of wealth all your sins were transferred on your accuser so the life of your savior could be transferred onto you what a trade what a trade that God has done in our day when he could take the life of your your sins and your wrongs and you say father forgive me and they' be moved off of you and the debts paid and be put on your accuser to remain there till they're throwed in the Lake of Fire and from there his life be transferred onto you oh what a trade oh yes what a place to be what kind of Faith should we have in our blood if Moses could call for flies under the blood of bulls and goats how come we can't call for healing under the blood of Jesus Christ how come we can't call for salvation under the blood of it's in the atonement it is there the price has been paid for just needs somebody to believe I have been forgiven yes the token has been applied to my life therefore I have the rights to use his name and in my name they shall cast out Devils this is not ordinary blood this is the perfect blood of Jesus Christ that you're under tonight so what can we say now woman where is your accuser CU When God when you come to God sometimes Lord I'm sorry he's like what are you talking about it's already been paid for it's over there on him that's where it's at let's by our hearts tonight sorry I wasn't able to really let go tonight because my voice maybe Lord just wanted to get some things across I'm sure we'll look at this even further have you made your call in the election sure do you have the token much as your daddy would love to apply for you he can't not in this Exodus sure daddies can apply it to their homes apply the blood to their homes Mama's sure serve the lamb but when it comes down to your own personal
