us amen we want to thank you for coming and and being a part this weekend he wanted to come and show his support to the shoal family and and we're so thankful for that ask him to come and minister today as we do let's sing that song he is here hallelujah i believe he's here in our midst this morning when he's here there's no telling what can happen because we just song of a god who's not made by mortal hands not a god sitting over there on this a pedestal somewhere made of stone or beautiful gold or some idol this is a god who created you he's not limited because he wasn't made by someone that's limited he's unlimited and there's unlimited power omnipotence in the building today if i was you i believe for the impossible because we've seen him working already among us and i believe he's still the same god today he's still the same amen let's sing this as he would come he [Music] is here [Music] i will bless the name of jesus [Music] [Music] oh he's here and you can touch him and you will that's true you'll never be the same i'll sing it again church here [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] closed captioning not available [Music] oh can we sing you one more time with all of our hearts this morning he is here [Music] he is here oh yes i will bless his name again he is here listen closely hear him calling out your name he is he [Music] can touch you you will never be the same how many witnesses do we have here this morning that you can touch him amen how many can say i touched him and i never was the same amen from that time i was a different individual amen i was just reading the other day where the prophet of god said he wanted to be the touchable god so he came down and became flesh that we could touch him and that we could fellowship with him and tell you this morning you're not serving a god that don't understand what we're going through this morning but everything that we've faced he already faced amen and he he is the great comforter this morning do you believe that with all your hearts and make we just bow our heads together for word of prayer i believe that elohim himself is moving through this building this morning he's here to bless us let's just ask him to come heavenly father lord as your believers have gathered themselves together here this morning lord father i don't believe that we're just here because we woke up and it was sunday morning and we knew it was something we're supposed to do on sunday morning but father i believe we're here because there is a deep calling to the deep lord lord i believe there's a pull on the inside of every believer here this morning father some sending before me today have been serving you lord for many many years some or just a few years but lord we can all relate this morning father to how your prophet talked about something on the inside of us that was lord always different maybe as a child things that didn't bother others seemed to bother us and things that didn't lord settle with others lord maybe it settled with us and lord a long time we didn't know what it was but then one day we recognized it was a gene seed lord of your own life that you placed on the inside of us and lord by that seed you have drawn us together lord you you have drawn us from different paths of life and or drawn us under this great message that you've sent in this hour so this morning lord we're not here for ritual we're not here for tradition but lord this spirit has drawn us here today lord i believe you've called us together because you have something for us this morning and lord there's no way that me as a man can minister to the needs of these people the lord we know that you can and so this morning we ask you to come may you come in the power of your resurrection lord for those that are sick this morning and suffering in their bodies i pray lord that you would just set them free today dear god may the great may the great angel of god just go by their homes or or the hospitals wherever they would be lord and just minister healing to their bodies or those who would be here today with different situations i pray you would come lord the father we know the enemy does everything he can lord to offset your word and to try to discourage your people but this morning lord they will lay aside tiredness lord may may we lay aside the cares of life and the things that work or the things at school whatever it be o god and for these next few moments may we just become more just shut in your presence oh god that we could be ministered to by you and minister lord to you by our worship and our praise and father we commit this service into your hands anoint your word this morning lord you see once again the servants of yours that are sick and suffering in their bodies lord brother ron we ask you to just go there and touch him today lord brother homer father lord of veteran of the cross lord a soldier lord i pray your angels would just go there lord may you may you breathe the breath of air into his lungs oh god lord not the breath of a man but the breath of almighty god that you would drive out that condition in his lungs that he could minister to your people i pray we love you this morning father we ask these things in the wonderful name of our lord and savior jesus christ we pray and all the believers said amen and amen god richly bless you this morning if you have your bibles while you're standing with us we'll invite you in the scriptures to the book of deuteronomy the 29th chapter and while you're returning there we want to greet you this morning in the name of the lord jesus christ we sure count it lord an honor and a privilege to be able to stand here this morning behind the desk and speak to you from the word of the lord and appreciate brother tim sister karen the church here and the fellowship and sure want to just continue to remember the shoal family during this time and we just thank the lord that we have an anchor amen amen and anchor within the veil and we bring greetings from our pastor brother sean martin and all the saints at faith tabernacle back home send their greetings to you and i do want to take this opportunity just to extend a thank you and appreciation to all those that was able to come last week brother tim and brother timothy and the different ones to the meetings there back home we sure sure appreciated everyone that was able to come and i tell you it's a it's a wonderful time to be a christian but it's a terrible time to be the devil amen there's a lot going on right now amen a lot of victories taking place revival burning across the land and for that we're grateful this morning amen amen in the book of deuteronomy the 29th chapter and the 29th verse i have a few places i'd like to read here this morning if that's okay deuteronomy the 29th chapter in the 29th verse the bible here says the secret things belong unto the lord our god but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children forever that we may do all the words of this law the secret things belong unto the lord our god but those things which are revealed belong unto us so at one time they're going to be secret things but then they're going to be revealed and they're going to belong unto us and to our children forever that we may do the words of this law now we ask this question how do we get the secret things if you turn the book of amos the third chapter amos the third chapter and the seventh verse a very very familiar reading to all the believers here this morning but god has got to have a way or a means by which he will reveal these secret things and in the seventh verse of the third chapter of amos the bible says now surely the lord god will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets amen surely the lord god will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets and one of the place i'd like to look this morning is hebrews the sixth chapter and i want to speak to you a little bit this morning about one of those secrets i believe the message of the hour is full of secrets this morning don't you but the beautiful thing about it is they've been revealed amen by a prophet in the book of hebrews the sixth chapter and the 18th verse we believe paul wrote the book of hebrews and paul says here in the 18th verse that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for god to lie we might have a strong consolation how many is thankful we have a strong consolation this morning we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope that is set before us which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast and which entereth into that within the veil whether the forerunner is for us entered even jesus made a high priest forever after the order of melchizedek we asked the lord this morning to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you may have your seats uh this morning from those scriptures we find amen our assignment this one in the word and if i title this today i want to speak to you for a few moments on the secret of a victorious life the secret of a victorious life how many how many desires of victorious life this morning the prophet of god preaches a message in 1965 and he calls it christ is revealed in his own word he said now and my text this morning is christ is revealed in his own word now where i come to the conclusion to talk on this was because knowing that we we say we mustn't just say uh something because we're gathered together just to say something haphazardly to speak on anything but it's something that will help stabilize the people amen something that will help stabilize the people for we are going amen to pass through dangerous and treacherous waters now this is not a possibility it's not something we might do we might pass through dangerous waters we might pass through treacherous waters amen but the prophet of god is saying we are going every one of us amen is going to pass through dangerous waters amen through treacherous waters and he says and we're already sailing through them now he said and sometimes i guess with you like it is with me amen it seems like so much of it is it it's just such a scary thing now amen if a prophet of god could sail through dangerous and treacherous waters and openly tell us amen that selling through those things sometimes brings a fear upon you amen then i'll say it like this it's not uncommon today amen maybe to have a bit of a fear about the things that are before the church but amen a prophet would go on to say but we have been stabilized amen by the power of the word to face these things that we're going through amen now let me say this brother branham was not a defeated preacher he he was not a defeated prophet he was not a defeated individual amen but he was a victorious preacher he was a victorious prophet and it wasn't that he didn't have troubles and he didn't have struggles but what it was was he had an anchor now amen that word victorious means having won a victory he meant being triumphed of or characterized by victory it means to conquer it means to win it means to be the champion it means to be successful so amen to think about this this morning that god has sent a message in this hour amen that you don't have to be characterized by the things you're going through amen or the situations you're facing but you're actually being characterized amen by the victory of jesus christ we we all this morning desire he meant to be victorious amen is there anybody here this morning that doesn't desire to be victorious amen we all desire to be victorious now amen as christians we we have all seen people amen that we look up to as strong believers you you maybe see a preacher or you see somebody in the church and you look up to them and you think i wish i could be like that or i wish i could always have the victory like they have amen i thirst for something that they have the prophet said i find they've been that people struggle he said seems like i meet people and they say it's just such a struggle have you ever seen that wave he said probably there's many sitting here before me now that has ups and downs and ins and outs he said they meant they said the day they're all right you meet them and well they love the lord and tomorrow they're having such a struggle to hold on he says the devil is tempting them and they're having such ups and downs he said then you meet somebody that's on the hilltop all the time he said brother there's nothing bothers them at all now there's bound to be something they've been lacking somewhere because god is no respecter persons can can you agree with me there god is no respecter persons amen or god doesn't respect persons he wants all of his children to have the same hey amen he wants all of his children to have the same a righteous father wouldn't give one a dish of ice cream without giving them all ice cream certainly he wants you to live he said no i am not talking about gifts i'm talking about grace he meant some are called the apostles some are called the prophets some are called the teachers amen but god has placed in the church these things but what i'm talking about is measures of grace amen overcoming grace to each one he meant then to think this morning that it's not just a pastor that can be victorious it's not just the evangelist that can be victorious it's not just the apostle even that can be victorious but it is the housewife amen that can be victorious it is it is the young man that can be victorious it is the teenage girl amen that can be victorious it's not based upon the gift amen or the office that you hold that is producing the victory amen what is producing the victory is the grace amen that is on the inside of the believer amen i'll say it like this it's it's not a natural ain't meant to have a thirst to live a victorious life the prophet said it's not a natural thing to thirst for god it is a natural thing it's just something that you should do god has made you up like that and it's no superhuman amen amen let's say that together it's no superhuman it's no superhuman it's just actually a common human being amen amen it ain't something special for some people they say well i've seen some people live such a victorious life that they're constantly on the housetop and they're praising god i wish i could feel that way he meant well the reason you are feeling that way is it's a first in you and it's for every person to thirst for god amen not now now what what a miserable people we would be here this morning he meant to have a thirst for that but there not be a way to obtain it he meant to have a desire for that but there not be a way to grasp it but this morning church amen every individual under the sound of my voice amen has got a right in authority this morning he meant by the holy ghost not to sit there amen and wish you could have victory amen wish you could have joy wish you could have peace amen wish you could have overcoming grace amen there is a message in the hour amen there's a message in the land today that says you don't have to wish for it you can get up and go get it amen if you want a victory amen you ain't got to wish you could get it it's already yours amen the only thing you've got to do is claim it amen i'll tell you this morning i am sick and tired he meant of the devil robbing the church of the living god from the things that god died that they could have amen christ died that we could have victory and then he died that we could have joy he died that we could have healing and salvation amen and that devil's put these things off in the future somewhere but there's not an army coming there's not a generation coming there is a generation here this morning that says these things are not for the future these things are for right now amen if the pastor could have victory amen then their housewife could have victory he meant if the evangelist can have victory then the young girl can have victory there is no age limits he meant on the victory of almighty god it is for whoever amen wants to raise up and claim it you can have it this morning amen it's a thirst it's a desire amen it's a hunger to live a victorious life actually what you're doing is you're thirsting for the god amen that manifested himself in the individual that made them an overcomer in their situation think about that you're not thirsting amen to be like brother tim or in these preachers amen you're thirsting amen for the god that's on the inside of them when you see them face things and something raises up in them and doesn't pull back and retreat but says let's move forward amen see that's the god in them causing them to do that revelation the third chapter him that overcometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go no more out and i will write upon him the name of my god and the name of the city of my god which is the new jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from my god and i will ride upon him amen my new name now who's doing this it's not the individual amen it's the holy ghost on the inside of the individual manifesting the characteristic of god can you say amen he said now he's not only given crowns but he says these and the bride will be made pillars in the temple of god but what is the temple of god amen jesus spoke of his body as being the temple it was it was the temple of god but now we are his body amen the true church is the temple of god by the holy ghost within us he meant the true church is the temple of god he'd been by the holy ghost within us now he is going to make the overcomer he meant a pillar in the temple he meant but what is a pillar a pillar is actually a part of the foundation for it holds up the superstructure he said praise god amen that puts the overcomer amen right in there with the apostles and the prophets oh help me lord amen that puts the overcomer amen right in the superstructure amen on the same foundation amen that the apostles and the prophets won't think about that this morning amen it's not just the prophet amen in the foundation it's not just the apostle in the foundation it's not just the pastor amen but it's the overcomer amen that's on the same foundation to think this morning that's the reason the devil is fighting you like he is amen because you're not a quitter amen you're an overcomer amen you're not a throw up your hands and turn around you are an overcomer and has been called by the grace of almighty god to be a part of the superstructure in the last days amen paul will say you are no more strangers and foreigners amen but you are fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of god and are built upon the foundation amen of the apostles and the prophets jesus christ himself amen be in the chief cornerstone in whom the whole body fitly framed together amen groweth unto a holy temple in the lord in whom he also are building together for inhabitation of god through the spirit amen so in this age we're living in god it's not building the denomination god is building a church are you with me the problem of god said god is building a church he is building superstructure powerhouses he meant to be witnesses in this last day he said in verse 22 we are building together with him everything went through the door jesus and it's a part of the body or the temple now when god puts a man in the temple as a pillar and makes him a part of the foundation group what is he doing he is giving him the revelation of the word and of himself because that is exactly amen what the apostles and the prophets had amen can i just take a time out and preach to here for a second amen sometimes you get your mind amen that the preachers got more than you've got amen or the event just had a better chance than you had amen i'll say it like this there's no respect of persons in god amen what the pastor god is the same thing you can get amen what the evangelist god is the same thing you can get amen there is a word in this age a mentor come into the heart of the believer he meant to quicken an overcomer on the inside of them that no matter what they go through they'll still be standing amen can i get a witness here today that says i know what you're talking about amen it wasn't because of the family i come out of it wasn't because of the church i was raised in it wasn't because of the home it was because the grace the overcoming grace of god had been brought down in my soul they met and quickened the seed on the inside of me that's why i'm standing here today oh come on church i'm not talking about a bunch of wishy-washy cowards and a bunch of hybrid christians they've been to blow up and throw up amen at the first sign of trouble i'm talking about some rugged aiming warriors i'm talking about some sons and daughters of god that when the devil amen throws everything he's got action you stand there and spray your shoulders back and say is that all you got amen i'm not a part of this layout of sea and lukewarm hybrid religion i am a part of the foundation it is a super structure it is a word-built church it is a church that don't blow apart it's a church that stands in the face of adversaries it stands in the face of sickness it stands in the face of heartache we have got the same thing paul had we got the same thing the apostles had you're not made out of one material and the prophets they have another in the upon oh amen it's the same material it's holy ghost material amen isn't that good it's holy ghost material amen then you know what kind of material you're made out of you're made out of stuff that don't bluff ain't that good you're made out of stuff that don't so the first sign of trouble doesn't cause you to back up it causes you to do the same thing that the forerunners before you done because you're built out of the same material he said what is it it is the word and no one somebody say no one no one can get the word out of them amen no one can get it out of him see in matthew 16 17 blessed are thou for simon barjona for flesh and blood has not revealed unto thee but my father which is in heaven see then this revelation this revelation that's keeping you amen that's putting a power in you it's not coming from flesh and blood it is coming from heaven let me say it like this then there is a bride on the earth this morning who is receiving the revelation and being set free by the revelation she is receiving amen remember johnny crow the prophet god said he been tied down so long he said but one day the good man and combined cut him free he said all the other birds they mean they wanted to go jump they wanted to go fly they wanted to go soar somewhere he said but johnny crowe amen went as far as he could see what johnny crow done was he got used he meant to going so far he got used to going maybe to youth camp and that's as far as he went he got used to going to three services a week and that's as far as he went amen but one day the good man come by he met and cut johnny crow free which meant all limitations have now been taken off of johnny crow and what the rest of the birds do johnny crow can do oh preach with me somebody amen if the rest of the birds fire johnny crow can now fly the brother said you've been tied so long do you think you're still tired he said but your sin is the only thing keeping you from being free but he who the son has cut free amen he who the son has cut free is free indeed amen i think we ought to take a few moments here and i think we ought to cut ourselves free amen from the excuses of why we can't live victorious we ought to cut ourselves free from the excuses of why that we can only shout in youth camp but we sleep in the house of god we can only run the aisles he meant in a convention atmosphere but on whistling out we look like a bump on a pickle oh i'm gonna preach this morning amen i'm talking about a god that didn't come to produce a christian that's up one day and down the next and it's controlled by the elements of the church i'm talking about a christian that if the whole church is cold they're on fire if the whole church is sleeping they're awake amen what is it church it's a power that has come into the life of that individual by the baptism of the holy ghost in a part of the superstructure ah you're free this morning amen the prophet said he who the son is cut free is free indeed see well my pastor nothing about that the bible said you're free amen that's right you are free well my church see what the prophet's doing he's cutting you free from all these excuses well my pastor your bible sets you free what's your next excuse well the church but the bible said you're free he washed us and loosed us from our denominations in his own blood and has made us free so we can think for ourselves and then do for ourselves talk for ourselves act for ourselves well if i went back and told the pastor i had to be re-baptized he would what about you are free amen what about those words you are free well the pastor you are free well my friend you are free well my family you are free amen i'm not a broken record i'm going to drive that home for a minute amen you are free this morning ain't been to live the desires of your heart well the pastor no you're free he says this is a revelation you know all right you are free well you've been sprinkled with a little salt shake like this the name of the father son and holy ghost here's a good pool sitting here amen ready this morning with water in it see yes sir it's not right so you're not bound anymore you are free but maybe you don't know it amen but let me tell you this morning the bible said he loosed us from our sins our unbelief are you ready that we might receive the revelation of jesus christ so we were not just loose to shout we were not just loose to dance we were not just loosed or amen amen to run the aisles but we were loosed to receive the revelation of jesus christ amen that the same victory that was accomplished in the forefathers would be accomplished in this generation what good is a message ain't been they can free you amen but can't keep you can i preach a minute amen what good is a gospel amen that can make us run the aisles but it can't keep us living clean i'll tell you what about this message it'll take a boy and make him live clean make him shout clean make him talk are you with me and then this message will take a young girl it'll wash all the paint off of her face it'll cause her to pick up a white flag and begin to wave it through the air as a sign of victory over everything the devil's held over her i'm talking about a message that didn't come to produce a church it come to produce a bride it come to produce a victorious bride it come to produce more amen than a bunch of religion it come to produce some real even third bread holy ghost peeled and fire baptized christians yes sir you have been free to receive the revelation he said see have you gotten free yet amen here is the revelation you take what god says about it you receive the revelation of who he is now let me say this we are living in the hour when god himself amen is writing the revelation of his word in the heart of his believers amen paul will say for as much as your manifesto declared to be the epistle of christ ministered by us written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god amen brother craig was at the house the other day and i saw him i was talking about bibles i showed him here in my bibles talk about different types of bibles we like and i saw him here i said well i love that thompson chain amen case you don't know i sweat amen and every now and again you get to preach it and sweat starts running down on the page amen you know what sweat does it it smears the ink amen and before long you can't make out what's there and before long everything runs together but here paul is saying that god is going to write a bible amen that ink cannot smear amen that water cannot wash away amen that fire cannot burn oh church of the living god i'm not talking about a bookstore amen i'm not talking about a bible bookstore i'm talking about a living book story let's preach a minute i'm talking about living epistles that have not been read by ink amen that when they go through something the tears can wash away what god has done in their life when they go through the fire amen the fire can burn away what god has done in their life i'm talking about some christians amen that have been written by the spirit of god and my bible says heaven and earth shall pass away but my word shall never pass away it's not been written in the tables of stone but in the fleshly tables of the heart see the promise of the jewish church was brought out of egypt in palestine was the natural church he said that a natural law was a natural people but we today are god's spiritual church with a spiritual law written on the tables of our heart and we are oh god we are being led in a spiritual form we are not here as a natural church with a natural law being led in a natural form we are here as the spiritual church with a spiritual law and then written in our hearts being led in a spiritual form now they looked upon it to see where the pillar of fire was the angel lord but we don't look today now think about this israel looked to see where is the pillar of fire he said they looked there and they looked here he said but we don't look today because there's just something happens that we know he's there okay amen there's just something happens that we know he's there what could happen amen that would cause us to know that no matter what we're going through amen our leader is still with us no matter what we're facing amen our god is still with us no matter what doctor's report we receive the great physician is still with us no matter what trouble we face in the middle of the night brother tim we know that god is still with us what could happen that would cause us to know that i'll tell you what it is it's an experience on the backside of the desert it's you standing the same place moses stood talking that leader face to face there's something happens that we know he's there are you with me we know he's there amen when you receive a bad doctor's report you don't have to walk out of the doctor's office and say oh god where is you hey where were you at you just walk out there and say he said he'd never leave me he said he never forsake me he said he would be with me always even until the end are you hearing me amen i'm not here this morning ain't been guessing the pillar of fire is here i didn't come here hoping the pillar of fire would show up brother hell i didn't come here hoping that the same pillar fire that led israel would come in this building this morning i come here knowing he was going to be here oh help me church we're not a bunch of guesters this morning we are believers amen that knows beyond the shadow of a doubt that the pillar of power is with us this morning are you with me amen we know he's here therefore we know amen that sometimes we've got to sacrifice things in our life to surrender ourselves to the leadership of the holy ghost how many believes you're a part of that spiritual church how many believers you're a part of that spiritual lead church amen spiritual land farm church the prophet said many times spiritual ed people are misunderstood amen to the peoples of the world because it's such a strange amen an odd life to live a full surrendered life to the lord jesus amen it's a strange and an odd life to live a full surrender life to the lord jesus amen now think about that remember the prophet talked about the man there and his baby dying with black diphtheria and he said he was standing there and he was talking to nurses talking the doctors and he said then the prophet come in and he began to pray and he said this saith lord the child will be well amen now think about this they had scans they had reports they had everything they're testifying the baby was going to die but a father amen was able to stand there and say praise god he's going to live amen praise god it's going to be fine and the nurses said sir you've lost your mind no he hadn't he was a part of a spiritual lead church that was not being led by the natural he was being led by the spiritual which was the supernatural oh i'm trying to behave myself amen you know why they looked at him and said sir you've lost your mind it's because he could look at their reports and laugh in the face of those reports because he heard what god said amen are you hearing me this morning you know why this church amen is ridiculed and made fun of it's not because of where you're at it's not because of who you are it's because you broke out of this earthbound realm into a heavily bound realm into an atmosphere where all things are possible and no matter what the devil throws at you it don't have the power to shake you oh the devil had his way this morning we and everyone be out of this church but he didn't have his way because we then broke into another realm and we know no matter what tomorrow holds we've done fellowship with the one who is holding tomorrow if it's a storm it'll be okay if it's a sickness we'll be okay are you hearing me not talking about up and down i'm talking about coming to a place of stability amen by the revelation of the word see then what you got to do is surrender yourself to the leadership of the pillar of fire you can't tell the pillar of fire where to take you you've got to surrender yourself and say pillar of fire wherever you take me i'm not your leader you're mine i'm not your amen you're not my follower i'm your follower well is this okay amen pillar of fire if you leave me in the burning bush i'll go in the burning bush if you leave me the lion's den i'll go there wherever you lead me lord i will trust you you say but then how can you say that because the same pillar of fire that was here while the bible was being wrote is the same pillar of fire that is here while the bible is being interpreted or is being revealed which means being brought to pass in human flesh now let me say it like a prophet said it i challenge you to believe that jesus christ is revealed in the form of the son of man in human flesh amen through the bride's body i challenge you amen to believe the son of man is revealed in human flesh amen through the bride's body amen now how many will accept this call how many will accept that challenge amen let me say it like this amen he wasn't challenging you just to believe that on the platform the son of man was being revealed even when he was speaking the storms the son of man was being he was challenging you to believe in this son of man dispensation that no matter what you go through the same son of man that was there is here leading the church through the bride's body amen like this the prophet said i believe it like this the son of man in human flesh through the bride's body see that what he's doing in this hour is paul is not here peter is not here james is not here can i say it like this william branham is not here amen but joe is here and tim is here and timothy and aaron is here are you with me and young men is here amen so will you accept amen that the same son of man that revealed himself through that part of the body is the same son of man revealing himself through this part of the body in the hour living in now i'll say it like this i believe it's possible to get the victory amen about shouting my my shoe heels off back there when brother tim was singing that song i believe it is possible to get to victory but can i tell you something else i believe i believe it's possible to keep the victory i don't believe it's just possible to get it even i believe it's possible to keep it i believe it's possible amen to live a victorious life in the middle of a neurotic age i believe it's possible amen to live in an atmosphere with god when men are one degree from total insanity i believe there is a stable bride all right let's get cut loose and preach in a minute i believe there is a stable bride up on the earth today that is not being led by what she sees she's not being pulled amen by the child she goes through amen but she's called a glimpse of the other side and there's an anchor over there that is anchored in her heart and it is pulling her through everything she's going through amen it is possible somebody say it's possible to get the victory say it like you believe it it is possible to get the victory it is possible to keep the victory it is possible to keep the victory because the thirst or the desire of the believer is to live a victorious life amen i i i'll say it like this the prophet said the lord knows the faults and the intents of your heart now can i take a minute here and read something to you it's acts in hebrews 4 12 for the word of god is quick and it's powerful and it's sharper than any two-edged sword it is piercing even to the dividing asunder of the soul and spirit of the joint to the morrow and it is a discerner of the faults and the intent of the heart see then what good is it for you to have a desire in your heart if there's not a god here to manifest that is higher that's in your heart see god desires he meant to give you the desires of your heart god desires amen to give you the desires of your heart no matter how big they are no matter how small they are amen god desires to give you the desires of your heart david said delight thyself in the lord and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart listen to this who is god in 1950 just a man and i want to go down here and look in the audience and just look around everybody this way see god bless you brother believe right over the top of your back there step aside i believe i see a lady there looking to me trying to believe i see a lady they're looking at me trying to believe it's a young lady sitting there i believe do you believe me sister with all your heart do you believe god sent me here for your healing you're a stranger to me i don't know you but god knows i know nothing of you now i know nothing of you now but i want you to look this way and i want you to believe one thing i know this that you haven't lived the life that you want to live have you you haven't been the christian that you want it to be and desire to be that is true you haven't lived the victorious life amen because darkness is gathering around you but i see also here's what's wrong with you amen yourself with a kidney it's a bladder trouble is that right amen you believe my word will be authority to you out of the word of god go home and serve god with all your heart you shall be over that you accept it say amen now think about this a lady with an inflamed bladder amen in a prayer line and then desiring him in a healing of the body but a prophet under the supernatural sign oh god can look into her heart and god can see that buried desire under all that all that bladder trouble all that inflammation and see but buried in there is a desire to serve god buried in there is a desire to live a victorious life amen another place you said heavenly father you're here to make known all things you are here manifesting yourself and now father she makes this confession thy servant knowing she wasn't making it to me but believing that you would hear he said now i pray god you give rest in your soul and her soul until you not give her rest until she's really surrendered completely to him i believe that you'll do that right away he said and your heart trouble will never bother you no more and now you go and give yourself completely to him and live a victorious life and forget about all your surroundings and what people are telling you amen don't believe that you go listen to what i've told you now and live happy think about that buried underneath that heart trouble amen brother matt there was a desire there ain't been to live a happy they've been surrendered they've been consecrated amen amen victorious life and the prophet was able to look in there and say now sister god is here amen to give you the desires of your heart listen friends what good is a god amen to leave him in the 50s let's bring him to 20 21 this morning i believe i'm looking at some believers here today that has the same desire amen god i want to sell out amen i want to pursue amen the things of righteousness god i want to live for you can i tell you what church he is here aiming to give you the desires of your heart hell brother andrew you don't realize my family i didn't ask you about your excuses i'm telling you you've got the same opportunity are you hearing me you've got the same opportunity that paul had to overcome the devil matter of fact the prophet said you got more opportunities that's easter 65 in case you want to know you've got more opportunities to overcome in this age of any age before us see then what am i saying i'm saying victory has come to the church amen to stabilize the church amen in those discernments you're seeing the promised sign of the messiah which said it shall be when the son of man is revealed now notice this when light shall come amen light shall cover amen and reveal what is laying there now i just wonder sometimes when that woman stood in the prayer line and she had that inflamed bladder and the other woman come with the heart trouble did they realize that that same light that could uncover the huge need in their life could uncover that other need of desiring to live a victorious life but in the presence of the evening light amen there is nothing hit oh god zechariah prophesied it shall be light see it shall be light about the middle day no at the evening time then what is light set for so you can see how to get around amen see where you're at it shall be light at the evening time brother said so we see the evening lights amen are here think about that church the evening lights are not coming but the evening lights are here and what does it have to do light if you have eyes to see how to get around what is the evening light it's the light that comes on to reveal something see what is malachi 4 to do to do the same thing what was the open of the seven seals to do where all these denominations stand around this is to reveal and to bring out if you haven't got any eyes then what's the what's the use to reveal now think about that god did not reveal the secret things and the hidden things even without there being some eyes on the earth to see what he was revealing oh god have mercy he didn't reveal the seven mysteries of the bible hoping somebody would see it he didn't reveal the baptism of the holy ghost pope and somebody would see he didn't reveal how to overcome amen hoping somebody would see it but he revealed it and then knowing that when the light began to shine there would be some eyes up on the earth that would be able to see what god was revealing old church this morning how many's got eyes to see anybody got eyes to see you ought to be the happiest person in this building today when god has hidden hidden things in his word amen for seven ages but has released them in this age that we wouldn't be here stumbling around trying to find out how to live right trying to find out how to baptize trying to figure out how to have church we have been given the secret things they've been revealed through the channel of a prophet oh the faith this morning church we've got eyes to see therefore god has sent the revelation that we can see by what was the manifestation of the sign the son of man it was a victory in this age amen over the demon of unbelief can i preach here for a minute it was a victory in this age over the demon of unbelief when the prophet god be standing there and he would say you've got this trouble and you've got that trouble and you've got that trouble what would he say do you believe me do you believe do you now believe what would he say if i told you your name would you believe if i told you your address would you believe and then stand there and accurately call out things that was buried in the hearts of individuals to show them in this age there is nothing hidden from the lord are you with me this morning amen the prophet said you want to know what i'm talking about is you might have thought i had something to do with this he said because i'm packing the message i have no more to do with it than nothing i'm no more than just a voice he said see it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel it was the manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that god unfolded it's not a man it's god so now we've found the secret amen to a victorious life is it's not the man it's the god it's not the preacher it's the god he said see the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger but the son of man is christ he is the one you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man his words will fail but you are feeding on the unfailing body word oh help me church you are feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man now let me say like this man does not have the ability to manifest the desires of your heart amen but god has the ability to give you the desires of your heart so quit feeding on a man well i may get quiet here but that's quite all right we'll get through it even don't feel the personality of a man don't feel an idea of a man amen feed on christ which is the unfailing body word of the son of man amen how many can agree the message of the hour came and not to produce halfway christians but to produce total christians even you realize the prophet said moses could not bring a total leverage to israel until he was totally delivered himself moses had to be totally livered moses had to come into a place of consecration with god before he could lead others he said what a marvelous victorious life halfway life is the most miserable thing there is and by the way there's no such a thing as a halfway christian you're either a sinner or a saint you're on one side of the fence or the other if you're born again you're saved if you're not born again you're outside of christ without hope without god but god has made preparation for you to be saved amen let me say this if you're riding the fence this morning there is a way that has been made for you to take a stand on the other side of the fence [Applause] god has made preparation for you to step across on the other side of the side of victory let me just stop here and say victory is not a future tense promise and it is not a past tense promise amen but victory is a present tense promise well brother andrew we'll have victory in the millennium and we victoria brother branham was here i say brother joel we've got victory here this morning amen i wonder is there any brothers here that's got victory is there any sisters here that's got victory is there any young people here that's got victory see then victory is not coming amen victory is here this morning oh some people think well i finally get the victory when i die but we are called to have victory in this life amen by the baptism of the holy ghost see god has made a preparation amen through the message of the hour to bring a stability to the heart of individuals that they can live a victorious life look what paul said in first corinthians 15 54 so in this corruptable shall i put on incorruption and this mortal shall put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the sand that is written amen death is swallowed up in victory o death where is not sting grave amen the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to god which causes us to earn this victory that what it says that causes us to labor for this victory no my bible says but thanks be to god which giveth us the victory through our lord jesus christ then you've been looking for a way to earn it and god has to deposit it into your account god has given you a been the victory here this morning the prophet said i even death itself cannot shake faith man can stand right in the face of death and shout the victory of the resurrection paul o death raise your sting grain rules your victory see because christ raised up and those that are in christ will come forth with him at his coming see the devil can't change it amen the devil can't change it yeah faith makes the word of god it's sanctuary of its eternal rest it lays in the word of god now here's paul he meant an apostle and a prophet amen who's writing about victory and look what he goes through now how many enjoyers reading your bibles do you draw strength from your bible i say thank god for our bibles right amen now let me say this our bibles are full of examples of victorious lives amen each example in the bible shows how that god got the victory came into each life let me say it like this amen god got the victory through moses and god got the victory through david and god got the victory through paul are you seeing the picture it was not the man getting the victory it was the god on the inside of the man getting the victory is that all right in other words amen god is using your flesh amen to get the victory over his enemy god is using your flesh in this age to get the victory over his enemy amen ever since the pawn in the garden he's just been changing bodies but it's the same warrior it's the same elohim it's the same melchizedek it's the same jesus oh come on church you know what the prophet said he said it was a mystery to the devil how that god got into jesus even when that man what was in the tombs there the maniac of gadara he was over there cutting himself in a terrible condition and the prophet said jesus got off the boat and come walking across the water and he said he locked eyes and then he locked eyes with that man and that man screamed out and fell in and worshiped him he said what happened was those demons inside that man had seen those eyes before they had seen they was they was there when they got kicked out amen they had seen those eyes before and the devil asked the question amen how amen did you get in there how did you that i saw up there get in this flesh down here what am i saying this morning i'm saying that's the same god that has come down in this age amen to claim your body and to claim my body what am i saying i'm tired i'm saying it's time the devil start asking the god the same question god how did you get in hell amen how did you get it josiah god how did you get in joseph god how did you get an andrew how did you get in luke i'll tell you how they got in there by the same power of the holy ghost that same god is condemned in this generation amen to claim some bodies not for victory coming and not for victory past but for victories this morning what are you saying i'm saying satan you're exposed i'm saying devil the cover has been ripped off you have no hiding place in the house of god the same son of man is revealing himself in the bride's body here this morning oh give him some praise he's not the defeated god he is the victorious god he's not the grandpa god he is the almighty god if he gave victory one time he can give it again anybody wants a victory anybody wants a victory anybody ever got to victory can i get a witness to somebody in here that's ever got to victory one time you got to victory one time brother l what did it do it put a thirst to you if i got one victory i want another [Applause] if i got one baptism i want another if i got one thing i want to reap i'm not talking about a bunch of campground christians ah prince with andrew thank you i believe i will i'm talking about some stable christians i'm talking about some believers that are sailing they've been through dangerous and treacherous waters but our anchor holes our anchor holds on the other side that no matter what storm we come against no matter what danger we face we've got an anchor this morning [Applause] oh in other words god is using your flesh to get the victory over his enemy [Applause] how did you get in there i know what you used to do amen how did you get in there i know what you used to say how did you get in that body i know what you used to look at i know the places he used to go but it doesn't matter when there is an atonement that has been provided by the blood of jesus christ come on church what are you saying with andrew i'm saying quit wishing and start getting some of y'all been looking here at these promises for years wishing you could get them wishing you could go ahead do you realize this morning you've got an unlimited credit card in your pocket [Applause]

through prophecy [Applause] said bethlehem it's going to be a city that's going to be raised up amen and there's going to be rulers come out of there listen church god raised up the ruler the lord jesus christ out of that bethlehem being but today in god's bethlehem he is raising up rulers over sin over unbelief over demonic spirits come on church even god is raising up rulers today and the world don't see it but bethlehem was there because god looked upon it and said out of these shall come now here's what amazes me is bethlehem how'd i get in this bethlehem was a small little town and everybody pushed it aside they made fun of it they didn't even call its name in the time of the placing of joshua of the place of the providences they didn't even call it but when god done something in bethlehem everybody flocked to it testing one two testing testing when it was not known by anybody else nobody said anything about it but the minute that god done something in bethlehem everybody fought to it do you realize jeffersonville indiana was not even a known town it was another spot on the map it was another place in the state of indiana amen but when god got done with it amen out of there come a prophet i often wonder brother tim all them all the people touring ships candy store i've often wonder what the people think why is all these people here but what it was was it wasn't what a man done he meant god done something that draw attention to that city well let's bring it right on down here even this this community of men to louisiana would be another city it would be another town it would be another village or well y'all call it down here parishes it'd be another parish amen but god has done something can i take some liberty here amen god has done something amen let me say it like this evening like tabernacle is what's put men that on the map well i didn't live like that oh brother you're just bragging on me and no i'm not i'm bragging on the god that placed some seeds here ain't meant to manifest victory through in a neurotic age when are you going to realize it ain't what a man's doing it's what god is doing it's not what a church is doing it's what god has chosen to brother damn god amen chose to claim your body right here in this community amen to get victory over his devil over his enemy lucifer and he's raised up some supports they meant to stand behind you what are you saying in the life i'm saying this church it's time to raise up amen and draw your sword and quit talking about the victory and go get it go get the victory go get your joy go get your family he has made you a part of the superstructure to do it clean your body brother joe he claimed you in this age to defeat his enemy number 10 he claimed you in this age to defeat the devils brother timothy he claims you in this age to defeat the devil but aaron he claims you to defeat the devil young man he claims you to defeat the devil he claims your body the son of man sister has claimed your flesh to defeat the devil miss hate brother andrew what's the sad thing about it because we're people with troubles and we're people with mistakes and we're people with failures but we're still people with victory victory in our hearts victory in our souls victory in the church with everything we're going through brother joel we still got victory with everything we're facing we still got niches with every devil that's come against us we still got victory well go ahead and praise him for a minute you've got a rock too you shouldn't be raising your hands but god rich and mercy you shouldn't be sad here in this church but god claims you to live a victorious life [Applause] and i'm going to go ahead and draw my sword and i'm going to cut another devil's head off while i'm here if that's okay it's an old critical devil that says young people ain't got the right to dance and shout [Applause] yeah i got a devil rebuking on me right now amen that's an old devil that says young people ain't got a right to kick their shoes off and have a good time in the house of god and you know what the first thing i say is why why don't they they say well because so and so done it and they're in the world today amen and so and so done it and she don't live right today amen can i tell you what what about the ones that done it and it's still serving god today what about the ones that stepped out of the outer court into the inner courts into the hurries of holies into a sound proof room where they couldn't hear the devil's talk where they couldn't hear the devil's language and they were shut in in the presence of god what about those young people oh help me this morning church what about those young people that really got something from god ain't they got a right to shout are you hearing me ain't they got it right to praise god oh mercy he said belinda what is the secret i'm getting to right here the secret is an experience the problem god preached a message called why are people so tossed about he said they're tossed about because there's two phases of the same christianity he said one is an intellectual conception he said but two i love this brother tim he says it's an experimental experience [Applause] go ahead and give me some room to dance you know why because you ain't looking at a 25 year old preacher that's got an intellectual conception you're looking at a 25 year old preacher that's got an experimental experience i didn't meet god through an intellectual conception i met god through an experience anybody else met him that way anybody else met him that way that what is that experience it's my anchor it's my anchor within the veil oh god help me jesus i've stepped out of the outer court i've stepped out of the inner court i'm in the inner veil now what did paul say brethren we now have boldness boldness to enter in to the holiest of holies by what by the blood of jesus christ now think about something if the bible's full of examples let's look at one here his name is paul hebrew says the earth or paul says this corinthians i want i want you to i want you to hear this because i still feel that old devil bouncing i'm not talking about a person i'm talking about spirit bouncing back and saying but brother andrew you can't preach after them young people you can't preach that to them christians you can't preach to them they can live in a place with god and all the time have the victory but the bible told me i could and here's what my bible says about one of our examples are they hebrews so am i are they israelites so am i are they the seed of abraham so am i are they ministers of christ i speak as a fool i am more in labors more abundant and now if you can give me this it's second corinthians 11 23. i want you to read this for yourself because there's some will still say but andrew i'm going through too much to really praise god i'm going through too much truly to really worship god i wish i could be like them other people but i'm going to tell you about a man that that went through a lot but he still come out with a victory are they ministers of christ i speak as a fool i am more in labor's more abundant in stripes above measure in prisons more frequent in depths oft of the jews five times received by 40 stripes save one thrice was i beat with rods once was i stoned thrice i suffered shipwreck a night in a day i've been in the deep in journeyians often in perils of water in perils of robbers in dangers perils means dangers in perils by my own countrymen in perils by the heathen in perils in the city in perils in the wilderness in perils in the sea in perils among false brethren in weariness and painfulness in watchings often in hunger and thirst in fastings often in cold and nakedness now is it over is it done here no and besides those things that are without that which cometh up on me daily the care of all the churches who is weak i am not weak shipwrecked three times in perils of water in perils of dangers in prisons often beaten for the gospel sake and he could still stand and say who is weak i'm not weak who is offended and i burn not if i must need glory i will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities thank god and father of our lord jesus christ which is blessed forevermore knoweth and i lie not in damascus the governor under arenas the king kept the sea of damascus with the garrison desires to apprehend me and threw a wind in a basket was i let down by the wall and escaped his hands when's the last time you met somebody that's been through as much as paul just recorded and they didn't sit you down for two hours it's like a pastor of the day asked somebody hey how you doing about about 10-15 minutes later he said well i'm sorry i asked but this man as an example of a victorious life could go through all of that and still be in church on wednesday night [Applause] could go through all of that and still be praising god on a sunday morning i'm preaching

some liberty okay lucifer's pretty weak this morning he's been taking some mighty big lashes he took one over there in oklahoma a few weeks ago i don't think he's got all the wounds banned in judgment then a few weeks later dumb devil showed up here in an easter camp meet and took a few more licks [Applause] can i testify for a minute i was out in flagstaff arizona preaching that week when brother ron stood behind this pulpit i was sitting there studying and brother ron got up and told us what he'd been going through i'm feeling it right here right now told what he'd been going through all the doctor's reports all the surgeries everything coming against him and he got done and he said i'm gonna preach a minute is that okay brother tim when he said that the power of god dropped to my hotel room i about had to run all over that place i started to look at the devil and say who is weak devil a man with cancer in his body amen is going to stand there and he's going to openly publicly testify that why i'm preaching tumors are going to disappear in my body i say who is weak are you hearing me sister elena when you took that life through here a few years ago and can't select your body you know what she can say who is weak oh come on church the world is falling apart the church world is falling apart but there is a pride on the earth this morning that is stronger today than she's ever been before she's feeling a charge from another dimension come on brother joe she's being led she's being laid by the pillar of power and wherever you take me i'll trust you wherever you lead me i'll follow you wherever we go i stand there and say god is my god who is weak who is weak this morning the devil and then we all got together up in the hills of virginia god's country sorry because it's not too far from tennessee we all got up there and the holy ghost come down and started moving you know what we done we start the devil up so bad the cops got called on us we got at the church one night and the cop was standing out there i thought here we go but you know what brother tim brother sean and i we've been in the warfare before that we've been fighting against that therefore the day they put the tent up we got brother brother terry horn was there mowing can i testify for a minute but that terry horn was there mowing and the tent was up brother terry brother shawn and i we all just bowed our heads and we began to pray right there lord bless these meetings father build a hedge of protection around it lord keep your hand upon it amen a few weeks later even somebody come by and said my you all got a lot of chairs out here how many all expecting brother sean said i don't know i've heard it could be up to 700. he said whoa hey man that's gonna be a lot of noise but that was the camp director church of god campground director you know what he died he went home that night and he couldn't sleep and he started praying and he said lord and people's trying to get people saved to you say would you would you build a wall around them people and let all the noise go straight up to you and not the neighbors who is weak the meeting started at about thursday i think it was they called the cops on us we got out of church and there's the cop brother sean says well how you doing sir he said well they called me said there's a lot of noise he said a lot of noise yeah i said there's a lot of noise said what's going on here he said we're just having church he said oh really he said yeah we got people here from louisiana he said louisiana all the way up here he said yes sir they're here for camp meeting he said so all y'all's doing is having church and praising god he said that's all we're doing he said enjoy yourself and have a good time i say who is weak you know what i say if the devil thought he was going to shut us up he ain't never going to shut us up and let me just close this morning by saying he'll never shut us up he'll take us up we'll never be shut up we'll never be back in the corner there will always be a victorious witness on the earth that says i have been through a lodge but i still got victory i've been through a lot but i still got joy are you hearing me can i tell brother tim how much time have i got can i die oh help me can i tie something together right here the same man that wrote that about being shipwrecked is the same man that wrote and said oh death where is thy sting oh great where is thy victory but thanks be to god which gives us the victory through our lord jesus christ can you give me revelation 15. i'm talking about a victorious church i'm talking about a victorious people what if i told you this morning you had victory in the past and you've got victory in the present but what if i read to you about a place recorded in the bible that speaks about you getting victory in the future revelation 15 verse 1 and i saw another sign in heaven great and marvelous and seven angels having the seven less plagues for in them was filled up with the wrath of god and i saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire and them are you seeing what i'm seeing brother hale and them that had gotten the over the beast over his image over his mark over the number of his name stand they were standing on the sea of glass glory to god they were standing on the sea of glass having hearts having harps oh you know what you go back to book of psalms and the bible says the harps they hung up on the willow trees but here oh god but here they got the hearts off the wheel of trees because it wasn't defeat day it was victory day what am i declaring this church it is victory day in the light tabernacle you've had victories but declared you've got victories but jesus christ the spirit of prophecy said to john and said right unto him i saw them over there standing with the victory over the devil what are you saying preacher i'm saying if we got victory here we're going to have victory there and if we got victory there victory here verse 3. wow and they all kind of got quiet said you better make sure all that singing is not in the flesh and it's in the spirit really tim i i don't know all the young people they're dancing some of them is getting in the flesh well we wish you'd get out of the flesh long enough to quit complaining and they sing the song of moses the sermon of god and the song of the lamb saying great and marvelous are thy works lord god almighty amen just and true are thou ways thou king of saints verse 4 who shall not fear thee o lord and glorify thy name for thou art holy for all nations shall come and worship before thee amen why did you read that because i want you for that judgments are made manifest i want you to identify yourself right there god has done seen you standing on the other side with a harp in your hand victory over the mark of the beast brother said it's matching time i'm done right here it's matching time you know that's true it's matching time that must have went home that's right now i'm going to tell you brother i don't care whether my shoes match my trousers or my trousers match my coat i want my experience to match god's bible are you ready are you ready if you want to match something match your experience against paul's amen that's what we need today is a matching time with paul's faith in the bible real matching time don't try to match your neighbor match some of the saints of the bible if you're a saint act like a saint walk like a saint dress like a saint talk like a saint pray like a saint believe like a saint shout like a saint be like a saint live like a saint die like a saint and go to heaven like a saint it may not be proper but i'll tell you what i'm doing i'm preaching to some saints this morning you've been through troubles but you went through your troubles like a saint you've been through some trouble some heartaches but you handled it like a saint you've been through some let downs but you handled it like a saint as the musicians come this morning match your experience with paul's in the bible come to the place where you can sit down and list everything you've been through and say who is weak this flesh it gets weak but there's a god that's come down and claimed this body to get victory through how many can say this morning i want to go all the way in you remember the prophet god talked about abraham and lot he said lot said it i believe he says the gate he said he said at the gate he said because he said at the gate he said he could still be close enough he could hear what was going on outside and he could still hear abraham inside he said but abraham didn't stop at the gate he went all the way to the door he went in the door he said he got as close as he could think about this he didn't want to stay as far away as he could and still be okay he wanted to get as close in as he could here's the secret to all these people hey have you ever seen somebody shouting and you knew what they were going through you knew in your heart everything they're facing and you you knew they had every right to be sitting there but they were they was on their feet praising god they were they were glorifying the lord and had every right to be sitting there having a pity party but you know what happened that individual they went into the whole list of holies they went into a consecrated life it's i didn't have time to get through all of it but it's a beautiful study if you ever listen to why people are so tossed about the prophet shows the three different types of light he said the outside light he said was the natural sunlight he said so one day the sun could be shine and they have light the next day it could be cloudy and they didn't have no light he said then they went in that second cord he said it was the artificial candlelight so they went through the light of the candles he said one day the candles could be burning light go down have to re-light them he said but if they ever went in that shekinah glory in that holiest of holies he said in there the shekinah glory was always shining in there it was soundproof and there was hidden manna you ever you ever seen it's gonna be funny you ever seen a bodybuilder and you wonder what in the world is their secret are they eating what are they doing they're on a special diet you know what this bride's own she's on a special diet it's called the hidden manner and it's producing a victorious life well the andrew paul's experience is good but i don't think i can have it well the prophet of god said you could i brother andrew paul's faith is good but i don't i don't i don't just i just don't think that's a faith we can have i can't tell you paul's faith is the same faith we have fear none of those things which shall suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that you may be tried and you shall have tribulation ten days be thou faithful unto death and i will give thee a crown of life be thou faithful unto death he does not say be faithful unto death but unto death you may have to seal your testimony with your blood thousands yeah millions have died during all the ages they have died in the faith like antibus the faithful martyr they held not their lives to death often we think that it would be almost impossible to be a martyr but dare to recall that that faith we daily use to triumph in christ jesus is the same faith that upholds the polycarps and all the martyrs the same faith that uphill polycarp is the same faith upon the brokenhearted here this morning it's the same faith that's upholding the sick in this building this morning it's a saving faith how many can say this morning lord that's the faith i want the supreme faith will give supreme grace for the supreme hour but andrew i'm not i'm not called like brother tim to stand behind the pulpit and war against spirits and have to stand in a place and fight against all kinds of demons and influences of the world and things i'm not called like in these preachers to stand and preach sermons i don't i don't know what i can do can i tell you this morning surrender your life to the spiritual leadership of the pillar of fire and have a testimony like this lord no matter where you lead me i'll follow you and in there i will have victory no matter lord when i cannot trace you i will still trust you and in there i will have victory we buy our hearts together today so just tumble our spirits in his presence well there be one here today could say lord i want my experience to match paul's i i want my i want my faith to match paul's god bless you god bless you lord i i want to i want to be a victorious christian and i see in the bible today that there's a secret to it that secret is you've provided an anchor which is an experience there's a secret to just surrendering my life to your hands lord you've taken my vessel you claiming my my body my flesh to get the victory through god bless you god bless you god bless you sis god bless you there my hands up different places in the building is that your desire today there's a desire there because there's a god here to give it to you heavenly father lord all across this building this morning lord stands warriors lord stands heroes of the faith soldiers of the cross lord men and women that have served you for many many years lord for a long time as i studied and looked at that on the pillars of the temple lord i always took it that it was just the just be the elders and the elder saints in the church that was the pillars of the temple but lord in this hour you said you would make the overcomers pillars in the temple of our god lord then what a what a blessing it is to know this morning that in this church today we've got some elder pillars and we've got some young pillars lord lord we've got some that's been serving you for many many years and lord how we thank you for their testimonies how we thank you for their life and their witness lord lord i know i'm sure there's young people here today that could testify there's believers in this church that they've seen come to service after service after service with a smile on their face with the with the hallelujah in their heart with a worship unto you nowhere down deep they was broken lord knowing down deep they were going through things that that is devastated and destroyed others the lord the secret to it was they had an anchor they didn't have an intellectual conception they didn't have an intellectual knowledge of this message lord you didn't send william branham in this age as the seventh angel lord to oh god to introduce an intellectual anchor to the church but lord as i read last night where your prophet said we have an anchor within the veil he said that's the same anchor i had when i was having stomach trouble and was was throwing my food up and couldn't keep it down he said my anchor was you lord and that anchor held within the veil something that i know oh god he knew you was a healer he knew you was a deliverer he knew you was a provider and lord that was his anchor and lord that's the same thing here today there's believers in this building today that can raise their hands and say i know you're a savior i know you're a healer i know you're a deliverer father may you bring a stability to every heart if there would be one here today near god lord that's that's desiring to live a victorious life the lord they feel like they're still tied down like johnny crow may they receive a revelation who the son is cut free is free indeed they can go beyond that two or three days out of camp meeting and back to living the same old way oh god it can go beyond that two or three days after church go back to living the same way the old god you've cut him free from that you've called him to a victorious life hallelujah how can we just slip our hands up to him this morning would you just let the lord come and minister to you right
