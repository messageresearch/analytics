[40:08] and turn your Bibles to Deuteronomy 7.
[40:12] verse 6.
[40:14] amen it's good to be in the house of the
[40:17] Lord
[40:18] hey man wanna welcome brother Joe and
[40:21] his family back with us
[40:23] hey man glad you're back home with us
[40:25] sure have missed you and and uh
[40:30] thankful the Lord was able to use you
[40:32] and to do great things for him no doubt
[40:34] and that's what it's all about but it's
[40:37] always good to be home amen
[40:40] amen let's turn the Bible on to
[40:42] Deuteronomy chapter 7 and verse 6. it
[40:45] says for thou art a holy people unto the
[40:48] Lord thy God and the Lord thy God has
[40:51] chosen thee to be a special people unto
[40:55] himself
[40:56] above all people that are upon the face
[40:59] of the Earth could you imagine hearing
[41:01] these words
[41:02] amen when he spoke about you
[41:05] amen this is this is the natural Israel
[41:08] but it's also to spiritual Israel the
[41:11] Lord did not set his love upon you nor
[41:13] choose you because you're more number
[41:16] than any people for you were the fewest
[41:18] of all people but because the Lord loved
[41:22] you and because he would keep the oath
[41:24] which is sworn to your fathers hath the
[41:27] Lord brought you out with a mighty hand
[41:29] and redeemed you out of the house of
[41:32] bondman from the hand of pharaoh king of
[41:35] Egypt now therefore the Lord thy God he
[41:39] is God the faithful God which keepeth
[41:43] Covenant and mercy with them that love
[41:46] him and keep his Commandments to a
[41:49] thousand Generations
[41:51] amen God bless you be seated
[41:56] actually I was going to speak on
[41:59] something else tonight but
[42:01] this
[42:02] this thought the faithful God just was
[42:05] running through me as I was driving to
[42:07] church and
[42:08] you feel to bring this tonight
[42:11] if the faithful God faithful means
[42:14] Worthy
[42:15] it means steadfast it means sure it's
[42:19] wonderful to have a god like that in an
[42:21] unsure world
[42:23] means true it's wonderful to have a god
[42:25] like that in an untrue world it's
[42:28] truthful it's blameless irreproachable
[42:32] amen firm without wavering irrevocable
[42:36] and unmoving this is a God that we serve
[42:40] tonight amen he's not a a god who's one
[42:43] day as we said let me be less service
[42:46] one day he loves you the next day you
[42:48] don't or one day he thinks good about
[42:50] you the next day he hates you but no
[42:52] he's unwavering about his love towards
[42:54] you
[42:55] and he called you and loved you not
[42:58] because you was a great person or a
[43:00] great people or a of great number as he
[43:03] said we were of the fewest of all people
[43:05] but he loved you and he called you
[43:07] beyond all your faults and all your
[43:10] failures and all your mistakes and and
[43:13] all the things that you ever done in
[43:14] your life amen and he called you without
[43:17] with a mighty hand and every one of us
[43:19] could have be a witness of that Mighty
[43:21] hand that he would take us out of a life
[43:23] of sin and a life of ungodliness a life
[43:26] of uh unworthiness amen and bring us
[43:29] right out of that into the place that we
[43:32] are today and redeemed you out of the
[43:34] house of bond men from the ham of the
[43:37] Pharaoh king of Egypt and he said now
[43:40] know therefore the Lord thy God he is
[43:43] God and he is the faithful God you know
[43:46] there there's a belief that's called
[43:48] deism it's a belief where people think
[43:50] that God created the world and then he
[43:53] walked away from it all leaving us to
[43:55] fend for ourselves it's actually one of
[43:58] the first steps towards being an atheist
[44:00] is to believe this way because if you
[44:02] believe this way then in the end you
[44:04] doubt God's faithfulness and when you
[44:07] begin to doubt God's faithfulness and
[44:10] then you begin to blame everything
[44:11] that's happening upon this Earth upon
[44:14] God in this belief system you know
[44:16] people think of like a child who would
[44:19] spin a top and you know how you maybe
[44:21] you used to play with a little spin top
[44:23] and it would Spin Real firmly at first
[44:25] and then it would begin to spin out of
[44:27] control and it would crash against the
[44:29] wall and it would crash against this and
[44:31] it would Teeter and it was totter and
[44:34] ultimately fall and you as a one who put
[44:36] it into orbit you had a the ability to
[44:39] re-spin it or to bring it to his right
[44:41] place but you know just let it go
[44:43] however it wants to go and this is how
[44:45] people think God is they think God spun
[44:48] this all into being and and spun this
[44:50] all into place and now he's walked away
[44:53] and he's left it all and he just kind of
[44:55] forgot all about it and many times we
[44:57] can bring it on down to individual lives
[44:59] we think that a lot of times about God
[45:01] ourselves because we find ourselves in
[45:04] the Calamity or we find ourselves in a
[45:06] in a hard situation and and we want to
[45:09] think that God has left us or God has
[45:11] walked away from us but he has
[45:13] ultimately and intimately concerned
[45:16] about this Earth's well-being and not
[45:19] only is he concerned about the Earth's
[45:21] well-being but he is also concerned
[45:24] about our well-being amen God is
[45:27] faithful God is honest God Is is true
[45:30] you know you may have let people down in
[45:32] your life you know I've let people down
[45:34] in mine and no doubt but there remains
[45:36] one who has never let one person down he
[45:40] has never let you down in the struggles
[45:43] and the trials and the hardships you can
[45:46] see God is still faithful and not only
[45:49] is he faithful but he's sitting above
[45:51] our circumstances and he's working it
[45:53] even though he's working even no we
[45:56] cannot see him he's still working and
[45:58] God's faithfulness though is woven into
[46:01] his character that's who he is a
[46:03] faithful God Amen you know his
[46:06] faithfulness is actually independent of
[46:08] our faithfulness
[46:11] Hallelujah his faithfulness is
[46:14] independent of our devotion or lack
[46:16] thereof he is independent of our
[46:18] faithfulness or lack thereof he remains
[46:21] faithful even if we don't remain
[46:24] faithful Hallelujah he remains faithful
[46:27] to his promises his faithfulness will be
[46:30] fulfilled trustworthy he's trustworthy
[46:33] to his promises amen he's going to stand
[46:35] on him and he's going to Shield us and
[46:38] he's going to protect us and he's going
[46:40] to be there for for us even when every
[46:43] friend on Earth has walked away from us
[46:45] and so God's promises are trustworthy
[46:48] and they are true and I'm going to stack
[46:50] a lot of scriptures on this right quick
[46:52] amen faithfulness is who God is it's who
[46:56] his character is amen and therefore he
[46:59] he cannot move away from that amen it
[47:02] says here in Deuteronomy says know
[47:04] therefore that the Lord your God is God
[47:06] he is the faithful God Amen in another
[47:09] place in Psalms 81 it says who is like
[47:12] you Lord God Almighty you Lord Almighty
[47:15] and your faithfulness surrounds you your
[47:19] faithfulness surrounds you another place
[47:21] in numbers 23 it says God is not man
[47:25] Hallelujah God is not man that he should
[47:28] lie or son of man that he should change
[47:31] his mind hath he's what hath he said
[47:33] that he will not do or what has he
[47:36] spoken that he will not fulfill but God
[47:40] will bring his word to Bass what he said
[47:42] he will do what he speaks he will
[47:45] fulfill he's not man he's not going to
[47:48] say one thing and change his mind and do
[47:50] something else but God is going to
[47:52] fulfill his word that's why he put it in
[47:54] Hebrews 13 8 Jesus Christ is the same
[47:57] yesterday today and forever I I know
[48:00] that's one of our favorite scriptures as
[48:02] a Cornerstone of the message amen but in
[48:04] that scripture is the faithfulness of
[48:07] almighty God because if he was faithful
[48:09] yesterday he's faithful today and if
[48:12] he's faithful today he'll be faithful
[48:14] tomorrow amen God cannot change his mind
[48:17] if he thought about you yesterday and he
[48:19] loved you yesterday he'll love you today
[48:21] and he'll still love you tomorrow now
[48:23] man on the other hand will you and can
[48:26] and can and will change their mind they
[48:29] will one day love you and the next day
[48:30] hate you they will one day call you
[48:32] their best friend and the next day they
[48:34] have a a list of alts against you and
[48:37] how come you did this and that and their
[48:39] faithfulness is dependent upon how
[48:41] faithful you are but that's not God Amen
[48:44] you can walk away time and time and time
[48:46] again and God is faithful over his word
[48:49] and over the seed of God and God will
[48:52] bring that seed to life I don't care how
[48:54] many times you walk away I don't care
[48:56] how many times you try to turn and go
[48:59] down the wrong way God is faithful to
[49:01] his word and he will bring it to pass
[49:04] amen But You O Lord are God that is
[49:07] merciful and gracious slow to anger and
[49:10] abounding in steadfast love and
[49:13] faithfulness
[49:16] he's abounding in it a God in First
[49:19] Corinthians 1 9 said God who has called
[49:22] you into fellowship with his son Jesus
[49:24] Christ Our Lord is faithful
[49:29] amen so he didn't just call you to leave
[49:32] you
[49:35] he didn't just call you son and say make
[49:38] it all the best way you can he didn't
[49:40] just call you and say hey I brought you
[49:42] to this place I brought you out of
[49:44] Darkness but now you make it the best
[49:46] way you can no the one that's called you
[49:48] the one that started the work is the one
[49:51] that's going to finish the word amen
[49:53] he's either he was a faithful one to
[49:55] call you and he's the faithful one to
[49:57] bring you in amen amen the God who
[50:00] called you therefore he had he had to be
[50:02] made like his brothers in every respect
[50:05] so that he might become a merciful and
[50:07] high faithful high priest in the service
[50:09] of God to make perpetuation for the sins
[50:13] of people the Lord is trustworthy and
[50:16] all his promises and is faithful and all
[50:19] he does the Lord upholds all who falls
[50:22] and lifts all who are bowed down
[50:28] maybe I need to bring that one up Psalms
[50:30] 145 and verse 13. the Lord is
[50:34] trustworthy
[50:38] in other words he's somebody you can
[50:40] trust
[50:42] last week we heard about his mercy and
[50:44] his mercies are new every morning and
[50:46] I'm here to tell you that he is faithful
[50:48] no matter what day you wake up in
[50:52] he can be trusted I don't care how
[50:54] impossible the situation may seem I
[50:57] don't care how impossible it may look I
[51:00] don't care if the doctors have wrote you
[51:01] off God can still be trusted
[51:06] Hallelujah medicine may not be trick and
[51:09] be trusted doctors sometimes can't be
[51:11] trusted man can't be trusted but God
[51:14] will and can be trusted
[51:17] he's trustworthy in all his promises and
[51:21] faithful and all he does the Lord
[51:23] upholds all who Falls
[51:30] how many has ever failed
[51:32] how'd you get back up the Lord
[51:36] you didn't get out of that old dirty
[51:38] place on your own you didn't get up and
[51:41] push yourself out of there you couldn't
[51:43] do it God is faithful
[51:49] first second Timothy 2 13 says it like
[51:51] this if we are faithless
[51:54] he remains faithful
[51:57] for he cannot deny himself
[52:02] Hallelujah
[52:03] man these are some rejoicing kind of
[52:05] scriptures here
[52:06] because there's been a lot of times I
[52:09] didn't feel like I had faith
[52:12] it was a lot of times I didn't feel like
[52:15] I was a fat I was a man of faith
[52:20] in other words if you believe not
[52:23] yet he abided Faithfully
[52:26] even when you can't believe he's still
[52:30] faithful to his word
[52:32] even when you can't believe he can do it
[52:34] he's still faithful to his word even
[52:37] when you can't believe he's healed he's
[52:40] still faithful to his word even when you
[52:42] can't believe he can bring your children
[52:44] home he's still faithful
[52:47] [Music]
[52:48] he's still fat even when you can't
[52:51] believe your marriage can be put back
[52:53] together he's still faithful
[53:01] you know why he's faithful because he
[53:04] cannot deny himself
[53:10] you know why he can't turn you away
[53:12] because he cannot deny himself
[53:15] you know why he can't push you away as I
[53:18] give up on you because he cannot deny
[53:21] himself
[53:22] Hallelujah but he stands there faithful
[53:26] when we've lost all faith
[53:31] so Hebrews 10 then says it like this let
[53:34] us 10 23 let us hold fast the confession
[53:37] of our faith without wavering
[53:41] for he who promised is faithful
[53:47] so we can hold it
[53:49] you can hold your peace
[53:52] what are you talking about brother
[53:53] Timothy I'm talking about when you're in
[53:55] a storm you can hold your peace
[53:59] when you're going through trials you can
[54:01] be at peace when you're going through
[54:04] the hardest time in your life you can be
[54:07] at peace because God's faithful amen
[54:10] just because you're going through a
[54:11] storm does not mean that God has went
[54:13] off somewhere and left you alone
[54:16] defend for yourself no he's still right
[54:19] there he's still guiding he's still
[54:21] leading he's still got the boat on top
[54:23] the water amen it ain't you keeping the
[54:26] boat on top of the water it's him
[54:27] keeping it on top of the water and he's
[54:30] watching over you
[54:38] oh my
[54:41] what promises are you looking to be
[54:43] fulfilled
[54:46] I mean he's looking for Promises of
[54:47] healing to be fulfilled
[54:50] how many is looking for Promises of
[54:53] Deliverance to be fulfilled how many is
[54:56] looking for Promises of prodigals to be
[54:58] fulfilled
[55:00] how many is looking for Promises of of a
[55:03] body change to be fulfilled
[55:05] well let's read about it first
[55:07] Thessalonians 5 verse 24 says he who
[55:11] calls you is faithful he will surely do
[55:15] it
[55:19] even when
[55:21] I do it he'll do it even when I can't
[55:24] make it he'll make it even when I can't
[55:26] provide it he'll provide it
[55:29] oh that's for somebody right there even
[55:31] when you've done all you can to provide
[55:33] God is a provider and you can't go any
[55:37] further he will still provide because
[55:40] he's faithful
[55:44] he'll surely do it
[55:49] Psalms 119 says your faithfulness
[55:51] endures to all generations
[55:57] that means my children's in there
[56:00] Hallelujah you have established an earth
[56:03] and it stands fast
[56:08] Romans 3 verse 3 says what if some were
[56:10] unfaithful
[56:12] does their faithlessness nullify the
[56:15] faithfulness of God
[56:17] not at all let God be true
[56:21] and every man a liar
[56:24] no matter how many promises God has made
[56:26] they are yes and so through him the amen
[56:30] is spoken to us for the glory of God so
[56:33] in other words they're not now I am
[56:34] about to go the way of the earth you
[56:36] know all the heart and the soul and not
[56:38] one of all the good Promises of the Lord
[56:40] your God gave you will fail every
[56:43] promise has been fulfilled not one has
[56:46] failed this is Joshua 23 and verse 14.
[56:48] I'm about to go the way of the earth you
[56:51] know with all your heart and the soul
[56:53] that all of God's promises the Lord your
[56:55] God gave you not one has failed
[56:59] but they have everyone been fulfilled
[57:02] not one
[57:08] where's our what's our testimony tonight
[57:11] well God failed here and God fell no no
[57:13] God's never failed
[57:16] you said well what about this one this
[57:18] one died and this one died your mama
[57:20] died well God didn't fail
[57:23] no no God didn't fail God kept his
[57:26] promises
[57:29] amen the Lord is not slow to fulfill his
[57:33] promise and some count slowness
[57:36] but it's patient towards you not wishing
[57:39] that any should perish but that all
[57:42] should reach repentance
[57:46] wow
[57:47] so maybe that's why we're still here in
[57:49] 2023.
[57:51] because the Lord is patient
[57:54] he's going to fulfill his promise but he
[57:56] don't want any to perish
[58:00] God's faithfulness is our protection
[58:04] so how's that well second Thessalonians
[58:06] 3 verse 3 says it like this but the Lord
[58:08] is faithful and he will establish you
[58:12] and guard you against the evil one
[58:16] um
[58:18] boo devil
[58:22] the Lord is faithful the one who has
[58:25] established you
[58:29] why are you here because God established
[58:31] me
[58:34] why are you standing in the place that
[58:36] you are because God did it
[58:39] why are you alive why are you allowed to
[58:41] stand when all hell seems against you
[58:43] because God allows it
[58:47] Garden us
[58:49] against that evil one
[58:51] Deuteronomy 31 6 says be strong and
[58:53] courageous do not be afraid or terrified
[58:56] because of them for the Lord your God
[58:59] goes with you
[59:00] he will never leave you nor forsake you
[59:06] um
[59:07] Hallelujah
[59:09] Psalms 91 says he'll cover you with his
[59:11] feathers
[59:12] and under his wings you'll find Refuge
[59:15] his faithfulness will be your shield and
[59:18] Rampart you will not fear the terror of
[59:21] night nor the air that flies die by day
[59:23] nor the pestilence that stalks in the
[59:25] darkness nor the plague that destroys at
[59:28] midday
[59:33] first Peter 5 says after you suffered a
[59:35] little while the grace of all the God of
[59:39] all Grace has called you to his eternal
[59:41] glory will himself restore
[59:44] confirm strengthen and establish you
[59:51] his faithful promises are something you
[59:54] can stand on
[59:57] the Bible says that we know that all for
[59:59] that those those who love God all things
[1:00:01] work together for the good to them that
[1:00:04] are thee called according to his purpose
[1:00:07] how many are they called
[1:00:09] according to his purpose he said my God
[1:00:13] Will Supply every need of yours
[1:00:14] according to his riches and Glory
[1:00:16] another one let us then have this
[1:00:18] confidence draw near to the throne of
[1:00:20] grace that we may receive mercy and find
[1:00:23] Grace in the help of need the Lord God
[1:00:26] is a son and shield the Lord bestows
[1:00:28] favor and honor no good thing does he
[1:00:30] withhold from them who walk uprightly
[1:00:34] if we confess our sins he is faithful
[1:00:37] and just to forgive our sins
[1:00:39] so he's also faithful in forgiving us
[1:00:45] or something you can learn from you want
[1:00:47] an attribute of God get that one down
[1:00:49] pat
[1:00:51] faithful and forgiveness well so and so
[1:00:53] did me wrong how long has that been 20
[1:00:55] years ago Let It Go
[1:01:01] people are so good about keeping lists
[1:01:05] kind of like that man you know in the
[1:01:06] Bible Jesus talked about who was
[1:01:08] forgiven I never forgotten now is uh I
[1:01:10] preached a sermon on it one time heart
[1:01:12] trouble over 17 dollars
[1:01:16] man went to the king order of his
[1:01:18] insurmountable of dead he could not and
[1:01:20] he couldn't even sell all of his kids
[1:01:21] and his wife and his land it still
[1:01:23] wouldn't pay at all
[1:01:25] and it goes to him and he finds Mercy
[1:01:29] and the King just writes it off
[1:01:32] and he walks right out the door and he
[1:01:34] finds somebody who owned owed him about
[1:01:36] 17 bucks
[1:01:38] and he throwed his hands around his neck
[1:01:40] and throwed him into the prison and the
[1:01:43] King heard about it
[1:01:47] how quickly we are to hold things
[1:01:49] against people and hold things against
[1:01:51] her husband hold things against our wife
[1:01:53] I don't know why I'm here but I'm just
[1:01:54] talking about the faithfulness of God
[1:01:56] and we're supposed to be the children of
[1:01:57] God well we're also supposed to be
[1:01:59] faithful in forgiveness
[1:02:03] because he is faithful to forgive
[1:02:11] the king's going to hear about it
[1:02:18] all the stuff that he's forgiven us
[1:02:24] Mercy Jesus
[1:02:26] he said my grace is sufficient for you
[1:02:28] for my Powers made perfect in weakness
[1:02:30] therefore I will boast all the more
[1:02:32] gladly in my weakness of the power of
[1:02:33] God May rest upon me he said Matthew 28
[1:02:37] I am with you always
[1:02:39] to the end of the world
[1:02:47] Isaiah would put it like this he would
[1:02:49] say oh Lord
[1:02:50] you are my God
[1:02:52] I will exalt thee
[1:02:55] I will praise your name
[1:02:57] for you have done wonderful things
[1:03:00] plans you have formed of old that are
[1:03:04] faithful and sure
[1:03:06] these plans that you know these
[1:03:08] wonderful things you're doing Lord are
[1:03:11] plans that you had before the foundation
[1:03:13] of the world and they're faithful and
[1:03:16] sure
[1:03:19] as we read last Wednesday Jeremiah said
[1:03:21] it like this the unfailing Love Never
[1:03:24] Ends the unfailing love of the Lord
[1:03:26] never ends his mercies by his mercies we
[1:03:30] have been kept from complete destruction
[1:03:33] great is thy faithfulness
[1:03:37] great is thy faithfulness
[1:03:41] Moses would write it like this
[1:03:44] as the Lord passed before him the Lord
[1:03:46] proclaimed the Lord
[1:03:48] the Lord God merciful and gracious
[1:03:52] long-suffering and abounding in goodness
[1:03:55] and Truth
[1:03:57] faithful God
[1:04:02] when he passed in front of Moses he said
[1:04:04] I'm the Lord God I'm merciful and very
[1:04:08] patient with my people
[1:04:14] that's another good attribute to have
[1:04:16] patient with my people I show great love
[1:04:20] and I can be trusted
[1:04:24] sure
[1:04:25] Hallelujah
[1:04:27] know therefore the Lord your God is God
[1:04:31] he is the faithful God
[1:04:34] who maintains Covenant loyalty with
[1:04:37] those who love him and keep his
[1:04:38] commandment to a thousand Generations
[1:04:45] Moses would say it like this to the
[1:04:47] children of Israel when they were
[1:04:48] Unfaithful he said is this the way to
[1:04:50] repay the Lord
[1:04:52] you foolish and senseless people isn't
[1:04:55] he your father who created you has he
[1:04:58] not made you and established you
[1:05:00] and he has been faithful
[1:05:05] the Lord is faithful
[1:05:07] his ways are passed finding out
[1:05:11] brother Tim's been preaching on Sarah
[1:05:15] found that he was faithful she actually
[1:05:18] judged him Faithfully
[1:05:21] you see by faith Sarah herself also
[1:05:23] received strength to concede seed
[1:05:25] conceived seed and she bore a child when
[1:05:28] she was past the age because she judged
[1:05:30] him faithful who had made the promise
[1:05:33] so it was her attitude toward the
[1:05:35] promise that brought it to pass
[1:05:38] even when I don't see him working he's
[1:05:41] still working
[1:05:42] you say well brother Timothy I can read
[1:05:44] over in the Old Testament where where
[1:05:46] Sarah did laughed unless Sarah did this
[1:05:48] and Abraham did this well that was under
[1:05:50] the blood of bulls and goats
[1:05:52] but under the New Covenant the faithful
[1:05:55] God said I don't want a loud to be shed
[1:05:57] every to every day or every month or
[1:05:59] once a year for my people's sin I'm
[1:06:02] going to come down the faithful God and
[1:06:04] I'm going to become flesh and I'm going
[1:06:06] to take on their sins once and for all
[1:06:10] and this lamb the faithful one who knew
[1:06:12] no sin he came and became sin for us
[1:06:17] and in the breaking of that blood no
[1:06:19] more of Abraham's sin is ever mentioned
[1:06:22] no more and if Sarah's doubting ever
[1:06:24] mentioned but she judged him faithful
[1:06:34] II Samuel said oh Lord God
[1:06:37] you are God
[1:06:38] and your words are true
[1:06:41] and you have promised this goodness to
[1:06:45] your servant
[1:06:49] that is so awesome Sunday to hear we're
[1:06:52] a friend of God
[1:06:54] and let me tell you something God is a
[1:06:57] real friend
[1:07:03] God ain't going to come up with all your
[1:07:05] negative side
[1:07:07] and everything negative against you
[1:07:08] because listen if he wanted to he could
[1:07:11] every one of us has a lot of negative
[1:07:14] I have a hard time being around people
[1:07:16] that's all they want to deal with is
[1:07:18] dwell in as the negative
[1:07:20] there's negative everywhere
[1:07:23] and every seat that's filled there's
[1:07:25] negative there
[1:07:27] Everest Place in this whole building
[1:07:28] where there's a human being there is
[1:07:30] negativity there but you have a choice
[1:07:35] listen you can find out all the negative
[1:07:37] stuff about your husband or about your
[1:07:39] wife or about your family about this or
[1:07:41] that and this but we have a choice
[1:07:51] God's a real friend
[1:07:53] he's a friend that won't walk out on you
[1:07:57] he's a friend that won't talk about you
[1:07:59] behind your back
[1:08:03] amen he's a friend that wants first
[1:08:05] thing you say something you go gospel to
[1:08:07] everybody else no no he's not that kind
[1:08:09] of friend
[1:08:11] he's a true friend
[1:08:15] he's a real friend
[1:08:17] and I'm thankful for that friend
[1:08:22] he's faithful to forgive he's a faithful
[1:08:26] high priest
[1:08:28] he will not abandon his people
[1:08:34] friends may walk out on other friends
[1:08:36] but this friend ain't gonna walk out on
[1:08:38] his friend
[1:08:39] he will not abandon his people he will
[1:08:42] not let them they get in a trial they
[1:08:44] get in sickness and they get in
[1:08:45] situations getting a pinch and he walks
[1:08:48] away and says try to figure it out on
[1:08:49] your own that's not the God that I serve
[1:08:51] this is going to stay there he'll never
[1:08:54] leave you he'll never forsake you he
[1:08:56] showed it Omaha I don't know how many
[1:08:58] times in the Old Testament through the
[1:09:00] New Testament you can find God's
[1:09:01] faithfulness where he never walked out
[1:09:04] on his people God's people may have
[1:09:06] walked out on him but he never walked
[1:09:09] out on them amen he would be right there
[1:09:11] with them when they was in Egypt he was
[1:09:13] there when they was at the Red Sea he
[1:09:15] was there in bitter Waters he was there
[1:09:17] with no food no water he was there when
[1:09:20] they crossed the Jordan River it was
[1:09:21] there when they went to take the
[1:09:23] promised land he was there with shamgar
[1:09:25] he was there with Gideon he would get in
[1:09:27] and walked out on him but God hadn't
[1:09:29] walked out on Gideon
[1:09:32] and when God looked at him he didn't
[1:09:35] call him what he was he called him what
[1:09:37] he was in God's mind
[1:09:39] [Applause]
[1:09:41] he said Gideon thy Mighty Man of Valor
[1:09:44] that's a true friend right there
[1:09:46] he'll look at you being a coward and
[1:09:48] call you a man of Courage
[1:10:03] Deuteronomy 4 31 says for the Lord your
[1:10:05] God is merciful
[1:10:08] he will not abandon you
[1:10:10] or destroy you
[1:10:17] or forget the Covenant he'd made with
[1:10:22] your ancestors
[1:10:25] oh my
[1:10:27] God Joshua would read it say it like
[1:10:29] this
[1:10:30] we'll use a different translation
[1:10:32] Joshua 21 verse 43-45
[1:10:36] said the lord gave Israel all the land
[1:10:40] he had swore to give their fathers
[1:10:43] and they took possession of it and
[1:10:45] settled there
[1:10:46] and the lord gave them rest on every
[1:10:49] side according to all that sworn to
[1:10:51] their fathers none
[1:10:56] nine of their enemies were able to stand
[1:11:00] against them
[1:11:01] for the Lord handed over every enemy to
[1:11:04] them
[1:11:06] none of the promises of the Lord had
[1:11:09] made to the house of Israel failed
[1:11:11] everything was fulfilled
[1:11:16] Hallelujah if that's the way it was with
[1:11:18] the physical Israel that's the way it's
[1:11:20] going to be with spiritual Israel
[1:11:23] when we get on to the other side we can
[1:11:25] say not one time did he fail me but he
[1:11:28] was with me every step of the way did I
[1:11:31] see him all the time no I didn't did I
[1:11:33] feel him all the time no I didn't did I
[1:11:35] know he was there all the time no I
[1:11:37] didn't but his word said he was
[1:11:40] and I stood upon his word and God
[1:11:43] fulfilled every promise
[1:11:46] because he is a faithful God
[1:11:51] has not brought us here to this moment
[1:11:55] for defeat
[1:11:58] come on now amen seemed like Cancer's
[1:12:01] coming on every side Demons of every
[1:12:03] kind are coming in and they're getting
[1:12:05] louder and louder and louder and
[1:12:07] proclaiming their nonsense and screaming
[1:12:10] and knocking on the doors inside them
[1:12:11] and doing all that kind of stuff we did
[1:12:13] not come here for defeat
[1:12:17] God did not bring the bride to this
[1:12:19] moment to say Hey you deal with cancer
[1:12:22] by yourself you deal with issues by
[1:12:24] yourself you deal with this over here by
[1:12:27] yourself you figure it out no he is
[1:12:29] still here
[1:12:31] because he's a faithful God and he will
[1:12:34] not leave his bride alone but he'll
[1:12:36] fight with her to the end
[1:12:46] he's faithful
[1:12:51] Hebrews 2 verse 16 says for verily he
[1:12:54] took not on him the nature of angels
[1:12:57] but he took on him
[1:12:59] the Seed of Abraham
[1:13:02] he wanted to know what it was exactly
[1:13:04] what it was like
[1:13:06] to sit in bodies just like you sit in
[1:13:09] because he want to be faithful
[1:13:12] so only way he could be faithful is to
[1:13:15] know
[1:13:19] he had to know what it was like to have
[1:13:20] mind battles
[1:13:23] so he could be faithful deer in mind
[1:13:25] battles he had to know what it was like
[1:13:28] to face sickness so he could be faithful
[1:13:30] during sickness he had to know what it
[1:13:33] was like for when friends walk away or
[1:13:35] this one does this or that one or to
[1:13:37] even in his own Inner Circle Amen to
[1:13:39] deny him or is or to betray him
[1:13:44] he wanted to know what it was like so
[1:13:46] when you faced these things he could be
[1:13:49] faithful
[1:13:53] wherefore in all things
[1:13:56] you hear that in all things it behooved
[1:13:59] him to be made like unto his Brethren
[1:14:01] that he might be merciful
[1:14:05] can I have mercy
[1:14:08] well I know what that's like
[1:14:11] I know what it's like to go Woody
[1:14:13] through what he's going through she's
[1:14:14] going through
[1:14:16] so therefore he could give out mercy and
[1:14:18] be a faithful high priest and the things
[1:14:20] pertaining to God to make reconciliation
[1:14:22] for the sins of the people for in that
[1:14:25] he himself has suffered being tempted he
[1:14:29] is able to secure them that are tempted
[1:14:33] foreign
[1:14:38] myself a fit back there a while ago
[1:14:41] you know what this word secure means
[1:14:44] it means to run
[1:14:47] to run to when you hear a cry for help
[1:14:57] but to write to you
[1:15:01] when you're crying for help and you're
[1:15:03] saying God does anybody out there know
[1:15:05] what I'm going through he says I do
[1:15:09] I know exactly what you're going through
[1:15:11] I know exactly I'm coming
[1:15:15] oh maybe that's what he's wanting to
[1:15:17] scream out to somebody tonight don't
[1:15:19] give up I'm coming
[1:15:21] don't give up I'm coming
[1:15:24] I'm running with Mercy I'm running with
[1:15:27] my faithfulness because it's surrounding
[1:15:30] me
[1:15:34] they would have run to those who cry and
[1:15:39] give assistance
[1:15:42] it means to uphold to help to assist to
[1:15:46] take part with
[1:15:48] that's a real friend
[1:15:54] listen you don't really want to take
[1:15:56] advice for somebody from somebody
[1:15:58] when you're going through something take
[1:16:00] advice for somebody who's never been
[1:16:01] through it
[1:16:04] because
[1:16:06] they can be blowing smoke for all you
[1:16:08] know
[1:16:09] they they might have some good advice
[1:16:11] they might I don't know but but chances
[1:16:14] are they've never been through it they
[1:16:16] don't know what it feels like they don't
[1:16:18] know what it's like to be in that moment
[1:16:19] they have no idea
[1:16:22] therefore having no feeling they can say
[1:16:24] whatever they want to but it's just
[1:16:26] empty words
[1:16:29] but when you have somebody that's been
[1:16:31] through what you've been through
[1:16:34] that's been where you are that's walked
[1:16:38] in the same place as you are walking
[1:16:39] that's been right there where you are
[1:16:45] I can say that I mean I don't mean this
[1:16:47] no no disrespect every word does help in
[1:16:50] this case but there's just something
[1:16:52] about some who's been through what
[1:16:54] you've been through when I lost my mom
[1:16:56] you know what really ministered to me
[1:16:58] was those who had also lost theirs
[1:17:02] because they knew what I was going
[1:17:04] through they knew what it was like sure
[1:17:06] I had great friends that offered me
[1:17:08] Comfort and never lost a mother or daddy
[1:17:11] or or a parent but you know they'd never
[1:17:13] been there and it was great comfort I'm
[1:17:14] not saying that but what I'm saying is
[1:17:16] those who had been there they had some
[1:17:18] deeper things to say to me because they
[1:17:21] had walked where I'm walking they had
[1:17:23] been through what I'm going through and
[1:17:26] this is why Jesus and his faithfulness
[1:17:27] would come down and become human because
[1:17:30] he wanted you to know I walked where
[1:17:32] you're walking I've been through where
[1:17:34] you're going through I've already
[1:17:36] conquered it I've already been there I
[1:17:39] Rose above it so you can also rise above
[1:17:42] it I have conquered it so you also can
[1:17:44] conquer I've overcome it so you also can
[1:17:47] overcome it let me give you some real
[1:17:50] words of encouragement I've been there
[1:17:52] I've overcome it you'll overcome it
[1:17:57] as above it
[1:17:59] and you're defeated
[1:18:01] cause I have been there
[1:18:07] he's taken part
[1:18:12] he's come to your side
[1:18:15] not as a bystander
[1:18:17] but for assistance
[1:18:20] he's come to throw together his help
[1:18:24] and his strength
[1:18:27] he's come to work
[1:18:28] to stand to place oneself right by their
[1:18:32] side
[1:18:33] to provide to take thought for
[1:18:37] that's the God we serve
[1:18:39] he's a faithful God
[1:18:42] he says in First Corinthians 10 and 13
[1:18:44] He says there hath no temptation taken
[1:18:47] you but such is common to man
[1:18:51] how could he say that because not every
[1:18:52] man's been through everything but
[1:18:54] there's one man who's been through
[1:18:55] everything
[1:18:57] so now all Temptations is common to man
[1:19:02] hello
[1:19:03] but God is faithful
[1:19:07] who will not suffer you to be tempted
[1:19:09] above that year Abel but will with the
[1:19:13] Temptation also make a way of Escape
[1:19:18] so that when the acid trial come in so
[1:19:21] is the way of his case
[1:19:24] hallelujah oh come on he will also make
[1:19:27] a way to escape that ye may be able to
[1:19:30] Bear it Hallelujah brother Ben said like
[1:19:32] this Satan May pin you in a corner with
[1:19:34] cancer but God has already made a way of
[1:19:38] his cave Satan May pin you under a car
[1:19:40] but God has already made an escape Satan
[1:19:43] may have taken your family from you but
[1:19:46] God has already made a way which king
[1:19:49] God Will Make A Way
[1:19:53] he has a way
[1:19:55] because he's faithful
[1:19:57] God always makes a way of Escape every
[1:20:00] time
[1:20:03] sickness pinned you in the corner Satan
[1:20:06] pins you down to a place after you
[1:20:08] become a Christian
[1:20:10] did he become a Christian or how it is
[1:20:11] then maybe you've been a gambler
[1:20:13] cars that say the cards are on the table
[1:20:15] come on John you know it was you you
[1:20:17] know what's in you Satan's there to
[1:20:18] tempt you but God every time will make a
[1:20:22] way of Escape if you'll just accepted
[1:20:26] maybe he's a drunk or the glass is under
[1:20:28] your nose come on John now if you heed
[1:20:31] that voice you'll go right straight out
[1:20:32] in your Waller again but God is always
[1:20:35] there
[1:20:40] God is always there turn your mind
[1:20:43] towards heaven and look towards Calvary
[1:20:46] blessed Holy Spirit come to me I'm in
[1:20:49] need
[1:20:52] that's a call for help
[1:20:54] I'm in need and he said watch what takes
[1:20:57] place God will come and he'll make a
[1:21:00] wave Escape every time
[1:21:05] see but that's what the devil likes to
[1:21:07] work on you and depress you and that's a
[1:21:09] trick of the devil to oppress
[1:21:11] but when this Christian knows his legal
[1:21:14] rights when you can quote God's word I
[1:21:16] will never leave you or forsake thee
[1:21:18] that takes all the oppression away
[1:21:25] and the clouds begin to clear back
[1:21:28] and if you just know that God promised
[1:21:31] and God is faithful and he'll keep it
[1:21:33] every time because he promised it
[1:21:39] it was a and you say well what about for
[1:21:43] us older folks was for you too
[1:21:46] it's one thing I've always appreciated
[1:21:47] about our pastors he always has stood
[1:21:50] and very firmly on Divine Healing is not
[1:21:53] just for the Young
[1:21:55] is for everyone
[1:21:58] amen you don't listen I'm older you get
[1:22:00] the more Divine Healing you need anyhow
[1:22:04] so I mean but the devil wants to make
[1:22:06] you think well you just you just you're
[1:22:07] just getting old and you just got to die
[1:22:09] and go no you don't have to
[1:22:12] he said if you want to you can just go
[1:22:13] on that away but you don't have to go
[1:22:15] that way that's what the prophet of God
[1:22:17] said you don't have to go that way
[1:22:20] amen so we're not going that way it was
[1:22:22] old man Simeon in the Bible and Anna the
[1:22:25] prophetess and prophet in the Bible that
[1:22:27] was there in the time of the birth of
[1:22:28] Jesus and he was given a promise that he
[1:22:31] would not die until he saw the Christ
[1:22:34] and the Holy Ghost had promised him and
[1:22:36] he was going to see the Christ and
[1:22:37] Christ was now in the temple he said but
[1:22:40] now it was up to the Holy Ghost to lead
[1:22:43] him to Christ
[1:22:45] if God's made a promise God is under
[1:22:48] obligation to lead you to it
[1:22:55] God is under obligation to lead you to
[1:22:58] his word if God promised Divine Healing
[1:23:01] God's under obligation to place Divine
[1:23:05] Healing here
[1:23:09] come on now did God make the promise of
[1:23:12] Divine Healing
[1:23:14] we can read the Bible where you ought to
[1:23:15] know this by heart
[1:23:17] it's there in the scripture Old and New
[1:23:19] Testament
[1:23:26] I feel sorry for those
[1:23:29] I want to call themselves Church of
[1:23:30] Christ but I call them the Church of the
[1:23:32] Antichrist because there ain't nothing
[1:23:33] about Christ in them
[1:23:36] they've wrote out God that heals wrote
[1:23:39] it off Struck it off you don't do that
[1:23:40] no I don't care how many times you can
[1:23:42] prove they've done it or that he's done
[1:23:44] it it doesn't matter to them
[1:23:51] but it's in the Bible
[1:23:54] come on now
[1:23:56] it's in the Bible
[1:23:57] so we're going to hold it up as a banner
[1:24:01] and we're going to wave it right in the
[1:24:03] devil's face
[1:24:04] right now Cancer's screaming as hard as
[1:24:07] he can but I'm screaming back at him my
[1:24:09] God heals
[1:24:11] my God delivers my God Saves there's
[1:24:15] nothing too hard for my God
[1:24:20] listen yeah the World's Screaming out
[1:24:23] there leftism and their their
[1:24:25] ungodliness Sodom and Gomorrah nonsense
[1:24:28] and they don't mind they're loud about
[1:24:30] it
[1:24:31] and on the flip side the devil wants
[1:24:34] Christians to be quiet
[1:24:36] you're supposed to just be quiet sane
[1:24:38] and sensible and sit there and just nod
[1:24:40] and say Amen no we got something to
[1:24:43] stand for
[1:24:44] give me libertarian give me death
[1:24:47] hey man we got something to declare we
[1:24:50] got something to weigh before the world
[1:24:52] Our God heals our gods are faithful God
[1:24:56] our God's the same yesterday today and
[1:24:58] forever he said well what about this
[1:25:00] when she died this one I does not matter
[1:25:03] our God is still to deliver he's still
[1:25:06] the Healer he's still the Savior he's
[1:25:09] still the satisfying portion he's still
[1:25:11] God
[1:25:12] [Applause]
[1:25:20] he's the same yesterday to him forever
[1:25:23] he is under obligation to place upon
[1:25:26] somebody
[1:25:27] to represent him
[1:25:31] if he promised it he said the things
[1:25:33] that I do shall you do also he is under
[1:25:36] obligation to that word
[1:25:39] hello
[1:25:40] it ain't me trying to bring that to pass
[1:25:42] he's under obligation to it
[1:25:45] if he when he said go ye into all the
[1:25:48] world and preach the gospel these signs
[1:25:50] shall follow them that believe he is
[1:25:52] under obligation to make those signs
[1:25:55] follow
[1:25:57] direct quote how far to all the world to
[1:26:01] the end of the world he's under
[1:26:02] obligation to do it no matter how much
[1:26:05] they try to stop it no matter how much
[1:26:07] they try to put it down there is no way
[1:26:10] of stopping it
[1:26:12] God said so you can stop this world
[1:26:15] easier and you can stop there it'll move
[1:26:17] on just the same Communists or
[1:26:19] unbelievers this that and the other they
[1:26:21] might as well keep still because God is
[1:26:24] going to move on anyhow
[1:26:27] hallelujah amen I don't care how many
[1:26:29] rise up in this message and say there's
[1:26:32] no such a thing as a as a baptism of the
[1:26:34] Holy Ghost sir or Miracles or past or
[1:26:37] signs of Wonders don't follow God's
[1:26:39] going to move anyhow
[1:26:41] God's gonna do it anyhow because it's
[1:26:43] his word believe it or not it's his word
[1:26:46] walk away from it if you want to it's
[1:26:49] his word
[1:26:51] and he's faithful to it
[1:26:53] and he will fulfill it
[1:26:58] Simeon
[1:27:00] sitting there
[1:27:02] way off
[1:27:04] in a prayer room maybe
[1:27:06] and the Holy Ghost says stand up Simeon
[1:27:10] and Simeon stands to his feet
[1:27:13] and here he comes walking out of the
[1:27:15] temple not knowing where he's going but
[1:27:18] led right by the Holy Ghost down to the
[1:27:21] line until he finds and he stops in
[1:27:23] front of this little woman
[1:27:25] with that baby and he reaches over and
[1:27:28] tears begin to run down his white beard
[1:27:30] and he takes that baby in his arms bless
[1:27:33] God and said let thy servant depart in
[1:27:35] peace according to Thy word for my eyes
[1:27:38] have seen your salvation
[1:27:41] the Holy Ghost promised him that and the
[1:27:44] Holy Ghost is under obligation to do
[1:27:46] that and yet he didn't know nothing
[1:27:48] about it but God led him to Christ when
[1:27:51] he was in the temple he said how many of
[1:27:54] you believe in Divine Healing
[1:27:57] well then if David said the Deep calls
[1:28:00] to the Deep there's got to be a deep to
[1:28:02] respond amen how many would like to have
[1:28:04] more of God tonight
[1:28:07] well because you want more of God that's
[1:28:09] a good sign there's more of God for you
[1:28:13] and he's faithful to bring it to pass
[1:28:20] reason Simeon believed that Christ would
[1:28:22] come the holy spirit said so
[1:28:24] and the Holy Spirit no matter how
[1:28:26] strange it seems to people how crazy he
[1:28:28] seems to be yet he believed it because
[1:28:31] there was something in him that told him
[1:28:32] so
[1:28:33] maybe nobody else knew it maybe nobody
[1:28:36] else heard it but it was revealed to
[1:28:38] Simeon
[1:28:40] and that was enough
[1:28:44] the same Holy Ghost said let Simeon up
[1:28:47] to the Christ because he had promised it
[1:28:49] he said if you read it in the Bible you
[1:28:51] believe in the same Holy Ghost LED you
[1:28:54] here tonight

[1:34:29] Revelations 1 5 and says from Jesus
[1:34:33] who is the faithful Witness
[1:34:37] 3 14 these things saith the amen the
[1:34:42] faithful and true Witness
[1:34:46] Revelations 19 11 I saw heaven open and
[1:34:50] behold a white horse and he that set
[1:34:51] upon him
[1:34:52] was called faithful and true
[1:34:56] and in righteousness he just judge and
[1:34:58] make war his eyes were as a flame of
[1:35:01] fire in his head were many crowns and he
[1:35:03] had a name written no man knew but he
[1:35:05] himself and he was clothed with a Vester
[1:35:07] dipped in Blood and his name is called
[1:35:09] the word of God and the armies which
[1:35:11] were in heaven followed him upon white
[1:35:13] horses clothed in fine linen white and
[1:35:16] clean and out of his mouth goes a sharp
[1:35:18] sword and with it he should Smite the
[1:35:21] Nations and he should rule them with a
[1:35:23] root Rod of iron he treteth upon the
[1:35:25] wine press with the fierceness of the
[1:35:27] wrath of almighty God and he hath on his
[1:35:29] Vester and on his thigh named written
[1:35:32] King of Kings
[1:35:34] and Lord of lords
[1:35:40] good read in Isaiah 9 and verse 6
[1:35:43] says the government
[1:35:45] shall be upon his shoulder
[1:35:48] what does that mean
[1:35:50] the answer is this the phrase the
[1:35:52] government upon his shoulder comes from
[1:35:55] a wedding ceremony of the East when the
[1:35:57] bride has been committed to the groom
[1:35:59] she takes off her veil and places it on
[1:36:03] the groom's shoulder signifying that not
[1:36:05] only is she under his Dominion she has
[1:36:07] transferred her rights to him that he is
[1:36:10] the head
[1:36:11] but also that he Bears a responsibility
[1:36:15] and the care
[1:36:17] and that he and he alone no one else no
[1:36:22] other man no other power no other
[1:36:25] anything has any right or responsibility
[1:36:29] and that beloved is the king of Key of
[1:36:32] David God being Sovereign he foreknew by
[1:36:35] Divine decree exactly who would be in
[1:36:37] his bride and he chose her she did not
[1:36:40] choose him he called her she did not
[1:36:43] cover her own he died for her he washed
[1:36:45] her in his blood he paid the price for
[1:36:47] her she belongs to him and to him alone
[1:36:50] she is wholly committed to him and
[1:36:52] accepts him he accepts the obligation he
[1:36:56] is her head for Christ is ahead of us
[1:36:59] church and Sarah called Abraham Lord
[1:37:01] even so the bride is happy to call he
[1:37:04] his her for him that because he is her
[1:37:07] Lord he speaks and she obeys for that is
[1:37:11] her Delight
[1:37:18] all right
[1:37:19] subarians
[1:37:26] foreign
[1:37:47] you know why
[1:37:49] you can see nothing but clouds and Gloom
[1:37:55] fear
[1:37:58] worry
[1:38:00] because you truly
[1:38:01] have not taken your Veil off
[1:38:04] and placed it upon his shoulders
[1:38:11] you truly
[1:38:12] have not allowed him
[1:38:15] to be Lord
[1:38:19] be God worship him give moderation

[1:38:27] Lord

[1:38:43] and your mistakes and your past
[1:38:46] become greater
[1:38:48] than him
[1:38:50] but if you'll take that Veil off
[1:38:57] and you'll lay your rights upon him
[1:39:00] he will accept
[1:39:01] the responsibility to take care of you
[1:39:09] pray that he is here
