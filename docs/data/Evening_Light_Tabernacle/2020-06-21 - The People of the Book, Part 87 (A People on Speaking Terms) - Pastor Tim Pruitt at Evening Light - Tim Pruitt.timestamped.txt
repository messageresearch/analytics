[49:26] Lord and surrender our lives to him and
[49:29] just say God speak in a mighty way a man
[49:32] who knows but the ones that we baptize
[49:35] today may be the last ones
[49:38] hey man you say well wait a little
[49:40] longer please sees us I'll tell you I'm
[49:46] I'm starting to pray like John Deere
[49:49] even so come Lord Jesus a man even so
[49:54] come when we see the world collapsing
[49:56] around us and we realized we hadn't got
[50:01] much little time left I'm sayin Lord let
[50:04] us find that last one soon Amen we built
[50:07] this building we made extra room for
[50:09] prophetess to come home Josh done is a
[50:14] prodigal and he's come home amen some
[50:19] times ago I I preached a sermon on and
[50:23] actually after he stood again up in in
[50:25] that up in Washington State hmm the
[50:31] prodigal son when he came to himself
[50:33] we've seen the Holy Spirit just deal
[50:36] with hearts and lives
[50:37] time after time I believe we should have
[50:40] on on our hearts today Lord deal with
[50:43] those hearts deal with those children
[50:46] deal with those wayward ones that are
[50:49] out there a man I think as I looked
[50:56] you know and I ever one of us noticed it
[51:00] yesterday and of course I took me back
[51:04] all the way to 1981 when I was in
[51:09] Anniston Alabama I went there too after
[51:14] brother George liquors had passed away
[51:16] and I was interned pastor and they're
[51:19] just helping out
[51:20] get ministry in driving 500 miles over
[51:25] there one way to minister and come back
[51:27] try to do that once a month or so Goethe
[51:30] knows I had those times ministering to
[51:33] those Saints there the Lord changed my
[51:37] subject that mornin and I three stones
[51:40] from Chrysler revealed in his own word a
[51:43] little something brother Branham said
[51:44] about stabilizers being put on the ship
[51:48] there was a young man that was there
[51:52] came in with his family jung yong li
[51:56] newly married newlywed hair down his
[52:01] shoulders just like a hippie its shirt
[52:06] wouldn't cover his belly sat down there
[52:10] in the service there and as I come out I
[52:13] begin to preach and I saw the word go
[52:15] and start directing toward this young
[52:17] man and that was Vernon Winters
[52:20] and there he began to cry out and scream
[52:23] out to God for mercy his wife had never
[52:27] seen all the skirt move on anybody she
[52:30] just grabbed him and started petting him
[52:32] and trying to console him but that day
[52:34] he come to the Lord his life was changed
[52:38] as marijuana went out the window on the
[52:39] way
[52:41] another burner has been through some ups
[52:43] and downs and some subside tracks and
[52:46] backsliding but I believe that even
[52:49] today that God has dealt with his heart
[52:52] and brought him back to him he's been
[52:55] back in service with us but now cancer
[52:57] has him down we just need to remember
[53:00] him in prayer we saw his son up here
[53:03] Matthew had a lot of hope for him that
[53:07] God would pull him out because that's
[53:11] what I told mother burning when he
[53:12] straight away I said look around it your
[53:14] family looking around your children
[53:17] they're gonna go the wrong direction oh
[53:19] no no he said I why you don't have to be
[53:22] in the message to to raise good kids I
[53:25] said it won't happen the only way
[53:27] that'll ever be is for you to raise them
[53:31] into the into righteousness and into
[53:35] truth it's children one by one and
[53:37] straight away
[53:38] and pull on the world has been I've on
[53:41] RT we've seen it on Matt winters we saw
[53:46] him yesterday well so no wait you're
[53:50] wrong Kaali the same way those things
[53:54] touch our hearts but I believe on this
[53:57] Father's Day I believe the Holy Spirit
[54:01] can send His angels and tap on their
[54:03] shoulders
[54:04] wake up up in the middle of the night or
[54:07] wherever there are kind of Li save them
[54:10] and bring delivers a man that they can
[54:14] make a full surrender it's Almighty God
[54:16] and I'm just asking you today amen let
[54:21] us let us look up on there as I look
[54:24] just today and I said Oh God hungry
[54:27] hearts thirsty souls that are destined
[54:31] for God but are trying to satisfy on

[55:08] see a seed that has predestinated nor

[55:14] reach that soul that you'll turn those
[55:17] lives around and bring them to you and I

[55:39] gospel is a positive gospel Lorca he can

[59:37] pray it away or I'm gonna take a
[59:38] vacation hey man first Corinthians
[59:46] chapter 10 verse 1 moreover brethren I
[59:48] would not that you should be ignorant
[59:50] how that all our fathers were under the
[59:53] cloud and all passed through the sea if
[59:56] you can just stop and go back in your
[59:58] mind just for a moment and you can't go
[1:00:00] most of you but try to vision it this is
[1:00:03] my text that I took fifty years ago my
[1:00:06] first sermon ever preached came from
[1:00:09] this this passage of Scripture right
[1:00:11] here that I read that I'm reading and
[1:00:15] we're all baptized unto Moses in the
[1:00:17] cloud and in the sea in all did eat the
[1:00:21] same spiritual meat and all did drink
[1:00:24] the same spiritual drink for they drank
[1:00:27] of that spiritual rock that followed
[1:00:30] them and that rock was Christ but with
[1:00:35] many of them God was not well pleased
[1:00:37] for they were overthrown in the
[1:00:38] wilderness now these were our examples
[1:00:41] to the intent we should not lust after
[1:00:44] their evil things as they also lusted
[1:00:48] need to be idolaters as some of them as
[1:00:51] were some of them as it is written the
[1:00:55] people sat down to eat and drink and
[1:00:57] rose up to play and neither let us
[1:01:00] commit fornication as some of them
[1:01:03] committed and fell in one day three and
[1:01:05] twenty thousand neither let us tempt
[1:01:08] Christ as some of them also tempted and
[1:01:11] were destroyed of serpents neither
[1:01:14] murmur ye as some of them also murmured
[1:01:18] and were destroyed of the destroyer now
[1:01:21] all of these things happen unto them for
[1:01:23] examples and they were written for our
[1:01:26] admonition upon whom the ends of the
[1:01:28] world are come wherefore let him that
[1:01:31] thinketh he standeth take heed lest he
[1:01:35] fall amen gonna let you have your seats
[1:01:38] but I'd like you to find also another
[1:01:40] scripture reading in Exodus chapter 17
[1:01:44] and we'll read from the first verse
[1:01:47] a man Exodus chapter 17 and verse 1 amen
[1:01:58] and all the congregation of the children
[1:02:01] of Israel gathered are journeyed from
[1:02:03] the wilderness of sin after their
[1:02:06] journeys according to the commandment of
[1:02:09] the Lord and pitched in rep Adem and
[1:02:11] there was no water for the people to
[1:02:13] drink wherefore the people did chide
[1:02:16] with Moses and said give us water that
[1:02:19] we may drink and Moses said unto them
[1:02:22] why try to eat with me wherefore you do
[1:02:26] you tip the Lord and the people there
[1:02:29] stood there for water and the people
[1:02:31] murmured against Moses and said
[1:02:34] wherefore is it that thou has brought us
[1:02:37] up out of Egypt to kill us and our
[1:02:39] children in our cattle with thirst and
[1:02:43] Moses cried unto the Lord saying what
[1:02:45] shall I do unto this people they be
[1:02:48] almost ready to
[1:02:50] stun me and the Lord said unto Moses go
[1:02:53] on before the people and take with thee
[1:02:56] of the elders of Israel and thy rod
[1:02:59] we're without smothers the river taking
[1:03:02] that hand and go behold I will stand
[1:03:06] before thee there upon the rock in Horeb
[1:03:11] and thou shalt smite the rock and there
[1:03:14] shall come water out of it that the
[1:03:17] people may drink and Moses did so in the
[1:03:20] sight of the elders of Israel and he
[1:03:24] called the name of the place masa and
[1:03:27] Meribah because of the chiding of the
[1:03:30] children of Israel and because a chimp
[1:03:32] to the Lord saying is the Lord among us
[1:03:36] or not I want to speak today and use for
[1:03:43] a text of a people on speaking terms I
[1:03:49] believe that we too are in an exodus it
[1:03:53] is the 3rd Exodus and of course since
[1:03:56] you know the first Exodus is Moses
[1:03:58] leading the children of Israel back to
[1:04:00] their land of promise and the second
[1:04:03] Exodus of course is Christ leading a
[1:04:05] church out of the wall into the Promised
[1:04:08] Land of Grace and the 3rd Exodus is
[1:04:11] where God has taken those people who
[1:04:14] have come into grace into a rapture and
[1:04:17] and then this Exodus we have had a
[1:04:21] prophet to call us out of the world and
[1:04:24] to come into Christ the word now Israel
[1:04:28] has always been a historical example of
[1:04:32] the church as you can see Paul would use
[1:04:35] it in his day an hour and he would point
[1:04:37] out of Israel and their failings and
[1:04:40] there were and and their even their
[1:04:43] victories and he would say now these
[1:04:45] things happened unto them for examples
[1:04:48] for they are written for our admonition
[1:04:51] in other words for us to take warning
[1:04:54] upon whom the ends of the world has come
[1:04:57] and I believe that we are now have
[1:05:01] arrived
[1:05:02] now seven churches later a man upon
[1:05:05] those of whom the ends of the world are
[1:05:08] come and then he gives us warn and let
[1:05:11] him that thinketh he standeth to take
[1:05:14] heed lest he fall and of course we can
[1:05:19] look and see that the Word of God is
[1:05:21] very inspired and this was written some
[1:05:26] two to three thousand years ago
[1:05:28] twenty-eight hundred years ago maybe and
[1:05:31] and the end how that God laid it out
[1:05:35] there for an example and made a shadow
[1:05:39] of something to testify of the positive
[1:05:43] is always important when you read your
[1:05:46] Bible that you see yourself in it
[1:05:49] because it was prop the sign of our day
[1:05:52] and we believe that there is no reason
[1:05:55] to write any history today because we
[1:05:58] believe we are the last generation and
[1:06:00] so being the last generation that we
[1:06:03] believe that we're we we will not write
[1:06:06] history for others to read but we are
[1:06:09] fulfilling all of the scriptures that
[1:06:12] have been spoken of this hour as I
[1:06:15] believe all the Word of God has been
[1:06:17] pointing to this day in this time in
[1:06:20] this hour in which we're living now
[1:06:23] first when we look back at this we must
[1:06:27] remember why that the children of Israel
[1:06:30] were down in Egypt to begin with after
[1:06:33] all God had promised their all the way
[1:06:37] in the beginning that with Abraham Isaac
[1:06:39] and Jacob he'd promised him the land of
[1:06:42] Palestine and he gave them that land and
[1:06:45] said this is yours walk over it and
[1:06:47] claim every sin every bit of it and and
[1:06:50] of course you know then why would not
[1:06:53] the people not be in the place that God
[1:06:56] provided and that's the question today
[1:06:59] for all of us to realize that God that
[1:07:03] gave us a Pentecost and he gave us the
[1:07:07] book of Acts
[1:07:09] by the way just that you might know I am
[1:07:11] quoting this part from the third Exodus
[1:07:14] he said that's a question of today also
[1:07:16] God gave us a Pentecost he gave us the
[1:07:20] book of Acts he gave us the Holy Spirit
[1:07:23] to lead us and guide us he gave us a
[1:07:26] land and why are we out of it
[1:07:29] and why is the church Attaway isn't a
[1:07:32] great Christian Church today living
[1:07:35] again like the book of Acts and bringing
[1:07:38] forth the same thing and there's some
[1:07:40] reason for it and of course we know the
[1:07:44] reason that they were out was because
[1:07:46] they because of the jealousy of a
[1:07:49] brother that the Brothers of Joseph were
[1:07:53] jealous because of Joseph's gift and the
[1:07:57] favor of a father he remember his
[1:08:00] jealousy you name you picked up on that
[1:08:03] in your prayer this morning brother
[1:08:04] Johnny but it is jealousy that is why
[1:08:07] that Cain killed Abel
[1:08:10] you see Cain that is on Alfred and it
[1:08:14] was not accepted and and so you know
[1:08:17] that that made a rise of jealousy in him
[1:08:20] that he killed his brother over worship
[1:08:24] a man over church over religion over God
[1:08:32] accepting one and not accepting the
[1:08:34] other and yet if that wasn't all
[1:08:38] forgiven to him to be accepted people a
[1:08:40] lot of times they all came never had a
[1:08:42] chance yes he did
[1:08:43] he said if you just come the way that a
[1:08:46] foe came
[1:08:48] you see what I bless you see I required
[1:08:52] the blood you see I require dying lamb
[1:08:54] you see the sin that come in the garden
[1:08:58] if you'll just come that way amen I will
[1:09:02] accept you but because of jealousy he
[1:09:06] rises up and he he strikes his brother
[1:09:10] down now jealousy then is at the root of
[1:09:14] every denomination and every set and
[1:09:18] denominational move that's in the
[1:09:20] message that at the root of it is
[1:09:23] jealousy a mad man now in fact of the
[1:09:28] matter is in many cases that's exactly
[1:09:31] the problem with many of the split
[1:09:33] churches and split homes the split
[1:09:36] everywhere division that is aerial
[1:09:39] because of jealousy and jealousy is
[1:09:43] pride in sustainment and pride and
[1:09:46] suspicion and distrust and doubt and
[1:09:50] apprehension about rivals
[1:09:52] progressiveness or possessiveness rather
[1:09:56] and overprotectiveness even brother
[1:10:00] madam dollars from the church age book
[1:10:02] he said the reason that they make their
[1:10:04] manuals and kept down and put a period
[1:10:06] to the Word of God is cuz they see that
[1:10:08] and move and then they said we must
[1:10:10] write it in our manuals and then we we
[1:10:13] must establish this so that the fire
[1:10:15] will not go out and he said it causes
[1:10:18] the fire go out because they don't allow
[1:10:21] God to keep moving on in their lives I
[1:10:26] want you to know wherever you are today
[1:10:29] you better not put a period to it
[1:10:32] you better be looking for God to move in
[1:10:35] a greater way in your life and mine
[1:10:38] cause we're in a very serious time it is
[1:10:42] this jealousy that causes the sex and
[1:10:44] the the sect s-e-c TS sex that is that
[1:10:50] is that that is caught em and the sex
[1:10:55] the divisions among churches and
[1:10:58] personality cults to arise causing
[1:11:01] division in the body of Christ now you
[1:11:06] know I well as I I was not even gonna go
[1:11:10] this way in fact of the matter is I had
[1:11:12] a whole sermon that has been that I had
[1:11:16] and ready to to go and and was just had
[1:11:19] just putting the finishing pieces
[1:11:21] together and the Lord just directed my
[1:11:24] thoughts and I had to turn and go this
[1:11:26] direction this morning and as I was
[1:11:29] coming awake as I was coming awake I I
[1:11:33] saw a group of people and I heard these
[1:11:38] words the house of Chloe and so I am NOT
[1:11:43] not even at that moment and to weld on
[1:11:45] my brain not even remembered where that
[1:11:47] was in the Bible I went quickly and
[1:11:49] looked it up and I just like to go with
[1:11:51] me you to go with me to purchase
[1:11:53] Corinthians 1 and 10 as I looked around
[1:11:57] at these these people and then they look
[1:12:00] like godly sisters men and and then I
[1:12:04] heard the words the house of Chloe and I
[1:12:06] just want to read you as I have read
[1:12:09] about these personality cults that calls
[1:12:12] division in 1st Corinthians 1 and 10 now
[1:12:15] I beseech you brethren by the name of
[1:12:18] our Lord Jesus Christ that you all speak
[1:12:21] the same thing I wonder if we can ever
[1:12:25] come back to this in the message that we
[1:12:29] would all speak the same thing and that
[1:12:31] there be no divisions among you
[1:12:34] and that should be perfectly joined
[1:12:36] together in the same mind in the same
[1:12:39] gentlemen I wonder what it would be even
[1:12:41] if evening like Tabernacle would come to
[1:12:43] this place that we all speak the same
[1:12:46] thing that took me no divisions among
[1:12:49] young perfectly joined together and with
[1:12:52] no funny feelings among us a man but
[1:12:56] before he said it had been declared unto
[1:12:59] me of my brethren of them which are the
[1:13:02] house of Chloe that there are
[1:13:05] contentions among you and he said now I
[1:13:09] say this I say that every one of you
[1:13:12] saith I'm appalled and high of Apollo's
[1:13:15] and I of Cephas at Peter and I of Christ
[1:13:18] he says is Christ divided was Paul
[1:13:21] crucified for you or were you baptized
[1:13:24] in the name of Paul you see there again
[1:13:28] that goes to show is that there's no
[1:13:30] salvation in any denomination even any
[1:13:34] personality cult come on and then
[1:13:38] there's no salvation in here in any of
[1:13:41] these sects of movement because they
[1:13:43] were not crucified for us reminder water
[1:13:47] was crucified for us was Christ and man
[1:13:52] is he that we owe our allegiance to it's
[1:13:54] he we must come in LA booyah hey man I
[1:13:59] don't even I'm not even interested in
[1:14:01] you becoming in love with a prophet or
[1:14:04] love with this ministry but lovable it
[1:14:07] may help me as a pastor I want you to
[1:14:09] get in love with Jesus then he becomes
[1:14:12] the first thing in your life the main
[1:14:15] thing in that you forget every other
[1:14:17] team and the things of the world go
[1:14:19] strangely dim as you look upon him see
[1:14:26] him God worked with Joseph calls his
[1:14:29] brethren to hate him and just remember
[1:14:31] we have had a whole generation today
[1:14:34] that was indicted and it did not just
[1:14:37] indict - the denominational it denied
[1:14:41] nighted even many of the independents
[1:14:45] remember we got a church world under
[1:14:48] indictment for crucifying that means
[1:14:52] taking the effect of the world away from
[1:14:56] the people he said cuz you can't crucify
[1:15:00] Christ the second time and neither can
[1:15:03] you go and mail this to across but he
[1:15:06] said the way we crucified Christ and
[1:15:09] this day is we kill the effect of the
[1:15:12] word that the word don't have the same
[1:15:15] effect to Sheol to deliver to say does
[1:15:19] that breathe to produce joy of peace in
[1:15:25] the church and brother madam would tell
[1:15:32] us today he has another Calvary now and
[1:15:37] it says the only place let me just
[1:15:41] settle down for a minute the only place
[1:15:46] that he meets with ma'am today is under
[1:15:48] the shed blood I'm sharing this from the
[1:15:50] indictment this shed blood of the
[1:15:53] sacrifice I don't care if you're
[1:15:56] Methodist Baptist Presbyterian if you
[1:15:59] can forget your differences and every
[1:16:03] Roman Catholic whatever you might be and
[1:16:05] will come under this shed blood God will
[1:16:08] meet both of us there that's where we
[1:16:10] can all meet and fellowship on the same
[1:16:13] grounds but otherwise he will not meet
[1:16:15] just because you're a Methodist
[1:16:17] he will not meet just because you're a
[1:16:20] Pentecostal he'll meet you under one
[1:16:23] condition and that's under the shed
[1:16:25] blood when your sins have been confessed
[1:16:29] and expelled in his presence then by the
[1:16:32] blood and the blood is always before him
[1:16:34] and therefore he can only see you
[1:16:36] through this shed blood and you're white
[1:16:39] as snow see when you can you confess
[1:16:41] your sin otherwise you're not there you
[1:16:43] can't fellowship and that's the reason
[1:16:47] you don't see things happening in the
[1:16:49] churches they confess to believe in the
[1:16:53] blood
[1:16:54] but to reject the very plan to get to
[1:16:56] the blood the word see there's only one
[1:17:00] way God will honor that word you'll
[1:17:02] never honor that word and come say I'm
[1:17:04] Roman Catholic I demand this to be done
[1:17:06] or I can't you can't do it Methodist
[1:17:08] Baptist Pentecostals you can't do it the
[1:17:11] only way you can do it is come under the
[1:17:14] the mercies of God through His grace has
[1:17:17] come through the shed blood of Jesus
[1:17:20] Christ and say Lord I claim the promise
[1:17:24] and then if you're really under that
[1:17:26] blood God is obligated to that word but
[1:17:29] first you must be under that blood and
[1:17:33] man you see it now no matter
[1:17:34] no wonder they can't believe in miracles
[1:17:37] no wonder they can't believe in the
[1:17:39] supernatural
[1:17:40] no wonder they condemn it the same
[1:17:43] reason they condemned it back there is
[1:17:45] the same reason they condemn it today
[1:17:47] and they're just guilty that's guilty
[1:17:49] can be caused only under the shed blood
[1:17:52] and those who would dare some little
[1:17:56] brother who dares under humility to take
[1:17:59] God at His Word and walk out there and
[1:18:02] confess his sins and forget all these
[1:18:04] dogmas and date and stand there under
[1:18:06] the blood and believe it they want to
[1:18:09] class him a fanatic they want to class
[1:18:11] him as it was save not a good word that
[1:18:13] he uses the booklet but so you
[1:18:15] understand he's an oddball so then he
[1:18:19] says they have crucified the effects of
[1:18:21] the world and Manny said how do they
[1:18:25] crucify the word with Jesus Christ said
[1:18:27] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:18:29] forever Hebrews 13:8 they say in such a
[1:18:32] way he is
[1:18:33] and Jesus said his last commandment to
[1:18:37] the church go into all the world mark 16
[1:18:40] go into all the world and preach the
[1:18:41] gospel and these signs shall follow them
[1:18:44] that believe all the world every
[1:18:46] creature and it ain't happy jet and
[1:18:48] there's millions die every year that's
[1:18:51] never even heard the name of Jesus still
[1:18:54] it's the gentle order it's still the
[1:18:56] commandment of God all the world and
[1:18:59] preach the gospel to every creature he
[1:19:01] that believeth in baptized shall be
[1:19:03] saved he that believeth not should be
[1:19:05] damn and these signs shall follow them
[1:19:07] that believe in my name they will cast
[1:19:10] out Devils they will speak with new
[1:19:12] tongues if they take up serpents or
[1:19:14] drink deadly things you shall not harm
[1:19:16] them if they lay hands on the sick they
[1:19:18] shall recover and they say that was for
[1:19:21] that generation and they make the
[1:19:23] commandment of God of none effect to
[1:19:26] this and they crucify the effect of the
[1:19:30] word to the people
[1:19:31] Peter said on the day of Pentecost were
[1:19:34] the keys of the kingdom that Jesus had
[1:19:36] just given him whatever you say I'll say
[1:19:39] it there and on the day of Pentecost he
[1:19:42] said they asked what they might do to
[1:19:45] receive the holy girl the Holy Spirit
[1:19:47] and they were so enjoying it watching
[1:19:49] others watching others acting what they
[1:19:54] would call silly and stagger and jump
[1:19:56] and fall and acting like they were drunk
[1:19:59] and they were saying these men are full
[1:20:01] of new hands but there was a man who
[1:20:03] stood up by the name of Peter who had
[1:20:06] the keys of the kingdom and said these
[1:20:08] are not drunken acts - as you suppose
[1:20:11] seeing that this is the third other day
[1:20:13] but this is that which was spoken on sea
[1:20:15] right back to the world again showing
[1:20:18] that the Spirit is still word and the
[1:20:21] word is still spirit hallelujah a
[1:20:25] mountain the Word of God and it shall
[1:20:28] come to pass as John has spoken by Joel
[1:20:30] 2:38 and it's a come to pass in the last
[1:20:33] days saith god I'll pour out my spirit
[1:20:36] upon the whole flesh listen that
[1:20:38] brother's said and they will look at him
[1:20:40] fearless standing there on that but scan
[1:20:42] given them and died in him and say this
[1:20:45] in some scripture this is that which was
[1:20:48] spoken by the Prophet I'll pour up my
[1:20:50] spirit upon all flesh your sons and
[1:20:54] daughters shall prophesy on my hands
[1:20:57] made and my certain my maidservant I'll
[1:20:59] pour out my spirit and my oxen glad is
[1:21:03] not just for brothers
[1:21:05] but it's for sisters - come on I saw
[1:21:08] signs in the heavens of bother on the
[1:21:11] earth and pillars of smoke and vapor
[1:21:13] proven by the word and it was the word
[1:21:16] and they laugh and made fun of it and
[1:21:19] they went to judgment and the city
[1:21:22] burned and they ate one another's
[1:21:24] children and to danger scattered people
[1:21:27] throughout all the world showing the
[1:21:29] Holy Spirit still remains the Word of
[1:21:31] God to bring this word to make it live
[1:21:35] think about it the judgment by looking
[1:21:39] upon the actions of the Holy Spirit and
[1:21:44] making fun of it Oh denying it
[1:21:47] it's Sydenham a whole nation to judgment
[1:21:51] and so will it be a dis generation hey
[1:21:56] man
[1:21:57] well now the second crucifixion he says
[1:22:00] if a man accepts Father Son and Holy
[1:22:03] Spirit a Creed instead of the word
[1:22:05] titles instead of the name what does he
[1:22:07] do to the people he crucifies the effect
[1:22:10] of the word to the people when he says
[1:22:13] that much of sixteen was just for that
[1:22:15] generation and God said himself there
[1:22:19] Jesus talking him good to all the world
[1:22:21] preach the gospel to every creature he
[1:22:24] that believeth and is baptized shall be
[1:22:26] saved he that believeth not to me now
[1:22:28] and these signs shall follow them how
[1:22:31] far every nation every Creed every
[1:22:33] tongue every race every people the same
[1:22:36] gospel and when a man tries to cut that
[1:22:39] out the Bible he crucifies the effects
[1:22:42] of the gospel to that congregation
[1:22:45] listen to himself so he says so indict
[1:22:49] you in the name of Jesus Christ you are
[1:22:53] guilty of murdering the Lord you see
[1:22:59] what happens when we did not divine
[1:23:02] healing when we did not prayer lines
[1:23:05] when we deny altar calls when we deny
[1:23:09] the movement of the Spirit you come
[1:23:12] under
[1:23:13] and then a judgment that attracts me
[1:23:15] comes past you might call yourself bride
[1:23:20] you might quote quote you might read
[1:23:22] Bibles you might pray prayers but I'll
[1:23:25] tell you you're no different than the
[1:23:26] Laodiceans hey ma'am you see brother
[1:23:35] madam told us in the third Exodus he
[1:23:39] said they thought these brothers they
[1:23:43] thought they would never have a use for
[1:23:45] a man like Joseph so why not just get
[1:23:49] rid of it they thought you know they
[1:23:53] actually thought of murdering him but
[1:23:56] you know money means a lot and they saw
[1:24:02] a chance to make a dollar and you see
[1:24:07] the same thing has happened today
[1:24:09] because our churches have become
[1:24:12] intellectual that we got the
[1:24:17] best-dressed clouds the biggest
[1:24:19] organization the smartest ministers and
[1:24:23] we have no use for the Holy Spirit in
[1:24:26] the way it was back there he said then
[1:24:30] they are full in other words action
[1:24:33] speaks louder than words so he's saying
[1:24:36] even if you're not saying that with your
[1:24:38] lips your actions are showing it okay
[1:24:43] ma'am that their seminaries and the
[1:24:45] brain of their being and they're coming
[1:24:47] together and they're discussing the
[1:24:49] thing are more able with their own
[1:24:50] intellectual minds to Senate Church in
[1:24:53] order better than what the Holy Spirit
[1:24:55] could do it and so they don't need it
[1:24:57] any more or any longer it's something we
[1:25:01] don't need today it's the days of his
[1:25:04] past now ain't that just right we don't
[1:25:07] need the Holy Spirit to heal the sick we
[1:25:10] got doctors we don't need to all the
[1:25:13] spiritual speak with tongues are all
[1:25:14] intelligent people and when you do you
[1:25:18] take right from your framework then
[1:25:22] I fly a man jesus said to them Jews in
[1:25:26] his day have you read that the stone
[1:25:28] that was rejected is the chief
[1:25:31] Cornerstone that the building said a
[1:25:33] bomb now why is that kind of preaching
[1:25:37] foreign to us today why is it why is it
[1:25:44] I don't want to just bring this down for
[1:25:46] a moment and you bear with me and
[1:25:51] sometimes you you said knows him what
[1:25:52] why why would you do these things and
[1:25:55] why do you preach the way you're doing
[1:25:56] it how come you've been laying some
[1:25:58] things out like this well I'll tell you
[1:26:00] why I won't just church to become a
[1:26:05] church that God can send a lost soul to
[1:26:11] and that we offer them more than an
[1:26:15] intellectual conception
[1:26:18] but we introduce them to the power of
[1:26:20] God that it change her life to a real
[1:26:26] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:28] music Ballentine why are you preaching
[1:26:30] about healing because I won't God to be
[1:26:32] able to send somebody who is sick one of
[1:26:35] his sick children her mommy can come to
[1:26:38] a place where they believe God and that
[1:26:41] believers word but they expect the
[1:26:43] miraculous instead of planning their
[1:26:47] funeral or just committing them to God
[1:26:51] and say poor little thing here I'm so
[1:26:53] sorry you're so sick there ought to be a
[1:26:55] power in the church a people who knows
[1:26:59] that God who knows who knows exactly how
[1:27:03] they cast out Devils in his name and
[1:27:05] ever sicknesses a devil instead of just
[1:27:15] saying Pat them on the back and said
[1:27:16] well you know we know it's God's will
[1:27:18] for you to be sick and God gets glory
[1:27:22] out of your sickness and you know you're
[1:27:24] developing character and we do we
[1:27:26] develop character when in any trial we
[1:27:29] go through and God's gonna get glory out
[1:27:32] of our lives no matter what we get that
[1:27:35] but friends that should not be an excuse
[1:27:38] for not happening healing and
[1:27:41] deliverance in our midst I know people
[1:27:47] are looking at well God's getting a lot
[1:27:49] of glory out of that man dying you know
[1:27:50] and nothing nothing not to not denying
[1:27:53] the Lord and he he died and God got a
[1:27:56] lot of glory out of it well God can get
[1:27:59] a lot of glory out of him being healed
[1:28:02] being a testimony of Jesus Christ
[1:28:06] hey Mountain and if God does happen no
[1:28:12] no this is Father's Day now I've been
[1:28:16] preaching for over 50 years now so I am
[1:28:21] a father I look at where this
[1:28:26] congregation I'm a father to many of you
[1:28:28] I am the father we don't call a minister
[1:28:35] father but you know Paul Paul said to
[1:28:38] Timothy you're my son and you have but
[1:28:41] one father and he's speaking of himself
[1:28:44] in relationship to that son now you're
[1:28:48] with me a man and there's a father
[1:28:51] sometimes as a father sometimes you have
[1:28:53] to speak out some things as you see as
[1:28:56] you see the world coming into the church
[1:29:00] and things begin to change and we begin
[1:29:02] to modernize and get pulled this way and
[1:29:05] that way and we lose our vision and our
[1:29:07] focus sometimes the Koya takes a father
[1:29:11] to be able to call it out amen and soon
[1:29:17] God that does happen to you to sit we
[1:29:21] don't want you testifying of it why
[1:29:23] people who testify of it are just
[1:29:25] wanting glory for themselves and after
[1:29:28] all don't you know the folks vine and
[1:29:30] tears have a 19-2 what's that got to do
[1:29:33] with anything
[1:29:34] hey my god never sent the true anointing
[1:29:39] for the tear he sent there 19 for the
[1:29:41] week and if you can admit the tear has
[1:29:46] anointing that you all really be able to
[1:29:48] admit that's a pride of the we has the
[1:29:52] anointing that sees you how I take a
[1:29:54] look for that stay
[1:30:02] but don't get witness or anything that
[1:30:04] God's doing we sure wouldn't want
[1:30:06] someone knowing that gods among us sons
[1:30:17] 105 verse 1 o give thanks unto the Lord
[1:30:22] and call upon his name and make known
[1:30:26] his deeds among the people let me read
[1:30:30] that again sons 105 1 ok thanks under
[1:30:35] the lord call upon his name and make
[1:30:39] known his deeds among the people we got
[1:30:46] a responsibility and meant to make known
[1:30:50] his deeds among the people you know FF
[1:30:53] Bosworth which was you know a great
[1:30:57] mentor and help in brother branham's
[1:30:59] time in his early ministry went with him
[1:31:02] to South Africa and so on had a healing
[1:31:05] campaign before even brother Branham was
[1:31:07] on the scene back in the 30s and then
[1:31:10] brother Branham came in the late 40s and
[1:31:12] and he said but anyway Bosworth said
[1:31:16] some oppose and write articles against
[1:31:19] us for publishing the testimonies of
[1:31:21] those who are miraculously healed what
[1:31:25] is the matter is there anything wrong
[1:31:26] and obeying the Lord's command to make
[1:31:29] known his deeds among the people since
[1:31:31] Jesus died to open the way for His
[1:31:34] mercies to reach all the needs of man we
[1:31:37] surely ought to be willing for them to
[1:31:40] know it one would think to read some of
[1:31:43] the books and articles that are being
[1:31:45] written that it's a crime to let people
[1:31:47] know about the Lord's compassion by
[1:31:51] there's willingness to heal and let me
[1:31:54] let me just go back and by as I can go
[1:31:56] back back to the 60s on and the actor
[1:31:59] brother right him leaving the climate
[1:32:01] and the message you know that and even
[1:32:04] to now that we are not to testify of
[1:32:07] God's healing power
[1:32:08] he was thought he would take away from
[1:32:10] the profit and it's in his position but
[1:32:14] I think it's a huge discredit to the man
[1:32:18] of God to the prophet of God and meant
[1:32:21] to brother Branham for us to present his
[1:32:23] message that's one that no longer works
[1:32:28] Amen because valid testimonies are no
[1:32:31] longer permitted or wanted the church
[1:32:36] world
[1:32:36] even my brother Bosworth's day that
[1:32:40] predated brother Branham they did not
[1:32:42] want God's deeds to be published among
[1:32:44] the people and there's a spirit in this
[1:32:48] last day the same thing they don't want
[1:32:50] to hear about it now I'm fully aware
[1:32:56] that there was some elements of the
[1:32:57] Pentecostal movement and and some
[1:33:00] elements of the divine healing movement
[1:33:02] that abused and misused this oh yeah you
[1:33:05] know they be turned into a bunch of
[1:33:07] brackets and how big at it and how many
[1:33:09] people and how many people pray for it
[1:33:11] how many people healed and I did this
[1:33:12] and I did that but I'm just gonna say
[1:33:15] this I am NOT gonna let a complex that
[1:33:20] it's caused by their behavior to push me
[1:33:24] on the other side where I failed to
[1:33:26] testify of the works of God I've never
[1:33:30] declared his deeds among the people
[1:33:33] [Applause]
[1:33:38] brother branham said in third Exodus he
[1:33:42] said they thought they would never meet
[1:33:44] it we don't need speakers with tongues
[1:33:48] we don't need interpreters of tongues we
[1:33:51] need no longer no longer need the Old
[1:33:54] Testament prophets to set us an order by
[1:33:57] the Holy Spirit we understand it brother
[1:34:01] Jill come today in this serie suit got a
[1:34:06] cute little hat to go with it go get
[1:34:16] hey man bra bra tit there and he's not
[1:34:22] gonna disrespect the same so worried but
[1:34:24] I'm um I'm gonna just have him put it on
[1:34:26] for a minute my my mind what a joy to
[1:34:33] certain my Savior today a man we no
[1:34:40] longer need Old Testament prophets to
[1:34:42] set us an order by the Holy Spirit we
[1:34:44] understand it stand up mother Jill but
[1:34:49] your hat on him walk forward I looked at
[1:34:57] him today announced today that reminds
[1:34:59] me of brother Brennan he said yeah my
[1:35:01] little girl Rebecca said yeah might look
[1:35:05] like brother branham bet you sure ain't
[1:35:07] no prophet
[1:35:11] you can have your seat
[1:35:18] but the truth of it is he is a prophet
[1:35:22] every New Testament preacher is a
[1:35:25] prophet I'm I'm the one that the word
[1:35:29] comes through in the gilliam of the
[1:35:31] anointing and they say things have never
[1:35:32] even thought about but today we don't
[1:35:37] need an honored man in the pulpit we
[1:35:39] don't need them that sounded streamin
[1:35:42] men rejoice in the truth and get under
[1:35:45] and the noise even speak the word and it
[1:35:47] is proud to I'm like some box from an
[1:35:49] angle we don't want that anymore we want
[1:35:52] dignified preachers they've adopted a
[1:36:00] man-made system to take the place of the
[1:36:02] Holy Spirit therefore there is a people
[1:36:06] that's elected the hazard names of the
[1:36:10] book of life and they can identify there
[1:36:12] they tapped out for that their spiritual
[1:36:16] minded therefore they can't doubt for
[1:36:19] that hallelujah
[1:36:21] that oughta be asked this morning I
[1:36:23] can't go for that
[1:36:26] oh man I can't tolerate that I want to
[1:36:30] see the holy ghost know that our lives
[1:36:32] and speaking a hard commitment bailet
[1:36:35] refuse people who love the dynamic
[1:36:37] Baptists mechanics alone
[1:36:46] hallelujah we're to be a called out
[1:36:51] church who separated church now we're to
[1:36:54] be thought of as peculiar and eyeballs
[1:36:56] and different we've been called every
[1:36:58] kind of names all the way from the
[1:37:00] beginning after the we were tagged with
[1:37:06] the name Christians to start with yeah
[1:37:09] that was not a name that was a nice name
[1:37:12] they were try it was a slur that's right
[1:37:19] today it's oh my everybody's a Christian
[1:37:22] you know why even scallywag presidents
[1:37:27] are born again hello that's their claim
[1:37:37] but then way we you know Israel was the
[1:37:41] people of God until they were called out
[1:37:44] then they were the Church of God and
[1:37:46] you're not the Church of God
[1:37:48] you're not the Bride of Christ until
[1:37:50] you're called out of the world and
[1:37:52] you've got to understand you cannot
[1:37:54] remain in the world and be the church
[1:37:58] you might be identifying yourself as it
[1:38:01] turns me you're not the church until you
[1:38:04] are separated from the world touch means
[1:38:07] called out
[1:38:09] and so God was calling them out out of
[1:38:15] Egypt to be the church and God is
[1:38:18] calling a bride of people out of the
[1:38:20] world to be the church all we don't want
[1:38:25] me the church today we're the bride well
[1:38:26] the bride is the church the churches a
[1:38:28] bride and he's gonna have a church
[1:38:30] without spot or wrinkle and I'm doing
[1:38:32] this rock I'll build my church and the
[1:38:34] gates of Hell will not prevail against
[1:38:36] her so I guess we are a church where the
[1:38:39] called out Israel was called out by God
[1:38:45] separated to God a peculiar people now
[1:38:49] listen listen you know new converts
[1:38:53] you'll never go anywhere for in the
[1:38:56] world in Christ until you separate
[1:38:58] yourself from your associates in the
[1:39:00] world let it off anything that would
[1:39:06] have any influence of sin cut it off
[1:39:09] that's right hey man you're gonna follow
[1:39:14] Jesus and man you cannot you cannot you
[1:39:18] cannot stay with your worldly associates
[1:39:21] your worldly friends your world of
[1:39:23] girlfriends or boyfriends or whoever
[1:39:26] they are you cannot be unequally yoked
[1:39:30] together and then the end in the Church
[1:39:33] of God we cannot be yoke ourselves
[1:39:36] together with unbelievers
[1:39:38] and I'm even gonna warn you there and
[1:39:40] spells family you can and in church
[1:39:43] family here today but don't make your
[1:39:46] friends people of the world it
[1:39:53] identifies the bird of the feather that
[1:39:56] you belong to
[1:39:58] hey man you walk with God in to walk
[1:40:02] with God that you can't cannot walk with
[1:40:04] another unless you agrees is that right
[1:40:09] a man should choose your friends from
[1:40:12] from those that believe separate
[1:40:16] yourself from the gospel or the gossip I
[1:40:18] mean of unbelief
[1:40:21] sometimes that even requires you to do
[1:40:24] the same things with members of it of a
[1:40:29] group church sometimes you have to walk
[1:40:34] along hey man hey man you know I mean
[1:40:41] many years ago I decided I was gonna
[1:40:43] preach this message that's what I was
[1:40:45] gone three times gonna preach what's
[1:40:47] been revealed in this age and I refused
[1:40:51] to let family mother daddy brothers
[1:40:55] anybody nobody who no matter who it was
[1:40:59] to pull me off of that course hey man I
[1:41:05] might have to stand alone I might be
[1:41:07] abandoned I might be left behind with by
[1:41:09] them but I'm not going their way now of
[1:41:14] course we're we're not called to worship
[1:41:17] the gods a world that's fornication the
[1:41:19] Bible said that with Israel when they
[1:41:21] left Egypt a mixed multitude went with
[1:41:24] them right a mile and so you know at the
[1:41:29] end this this mixed multitude started
[1:41:32] eating the same man they like the seals
[1:41:35] too in the church ages and that began to
[1:41:40] call herself bride - and we're
[1:41:43] predestinated we're not gonna miss it
[1:41:46] and still live in like the world still
[1:41:50] unchanged hey man people who are sinners
[1:41:54] even will enjoy seeing somebody healed
[1:41:57] her somebody delivered God moving among
[1:41:59] the people or sermon preached an
[1:42:00] anointing but but again a mixed
[1:42:05] multitude now you know he said that he
[1:42:10] said that brethren I want you to be
[1:42:12] aware I would not let you to be ignorant
[1:42:15] her fathers were under the cloud listen
[1:42:19] this they were under the cloud that pass
[1:42:22] through the sea they were baptized of
[1:42:25] the Moses in the cloud and the sea and
[1:42:27] they're always the same spiritual meat
[1:42:29] and they take from that
[1:42:31] same spirit of drink for they drank of
[1:42:33] that spiritual rock that followed them
[1:42:34] which is Christ of course they did it in
[1:42:37] the natural but with many of these God
[1:42:42] was not well pleased and so again he
[1:42:46] told them said don't be idolatrous and
[1:42:51] some of them were the people sat down to
[1:42:53] eat and drink and they rose up to play
[1:43:00] isn't this amazing people who started
[1:43:04] out with sincerity people who started
[1:43:09] out with the seal I'm determined to hold
[1:43:13] out to the end somewhere along the line
[1:43:17] that lost their vision and their purpose
[1:43:21] and I just want to say what is our
[1:43:24] purpose our purpose is to be conformed
[1:43:26] to the image of Christ to be a bride
[1:43:29] without spot or wrinkle to be a people
[1:43:31] that is cauldrons namesake you know we
[1:43:35] started out with zeal we're gonna leave
[1:43:38] Egypt the world behind us we're not
[1:43:41] gonna be slaves no more hey man there's
[1:43:44] there was all the excitement it's his
[1:43:46] rapture time is rapture hour it's going
[1:43:50] on time where we're going where there is
[1:43:52] no sin no sickness and sorrow no pain no
[1:43:56] death and we're we're under a pillar
[1:43:58] fire I've indicated prophet the book is
[1:44:02] open and the seals have been revealed
[1:44:03] seven previously unknown thunders have
[1:44:07] either devices and we tried to tell our
[1:44:11] Egyptians friends but they were happy
[1:44:14] with being slaves we started out on the
[1:44:19] journey we got baptized in Jesus name
[1:44:22] Amen
[1:44:25] we shouted and danced throughout the
[1:44:27] ELCA denominations and their traditions
[1:44:30] the birds sang different
[1:44:34] and man everybody was sweet with
[1:44:37] sanctify themself from the world we quit
[1:44:39] our drinking and our smoking we stopped
[1:44:42] going to the pool room and man and man
[1:44:48] we quit the gaming we threw out the rock
[1:44:50] and roll' got rid of the country-western
[1:44:54] music the rap and all the other world
[1:44:57] music women let their hair grow out and
[1:45:00] then cut theirs they refused to look
[1:45:04] like the world but we didn't know about
[1:45:07] the delay we thought because the word
[1:45:11] had come
[1:45:12] we were rapture ready and we didn't know
[1:45:15] that we would be tried by the very word
[1:45:18] that we had received and the longer of
[1:45:22] the delay of reaching the land the more
[1:45:25] people wish for what they had in Egypt
[1:45:35] soon we started going back to movies
[1:45:38] again the television was back in the
[1:45:43] home movies became a regular part of our
[1:45:47] diet instead of listening to tapes
[1:45:51] novels and love story books were being
[1:45:53] read that pervert the mind tight skirts
[1:45:58] of slips appeared dresses above the
[1:46:01] knees boys started dressing like
[1:46:05] perverts a man instead of a Holy Ghost
[1:46:10] experienced some took a denominational
[1:46:13] approach like other moves before us I'm
[1:46:16] gonna warn you brother madam said this
[1:46:19] cycle of revival and death has never
[1:46:22] failed and I'm gonna tell you again it
[1:46:25] will not fail even in this mood that
[1:46:29] there will be many who started out in
[1:46:31] this cycle of revival who will go back
[1:46:34] down into death
[1:46:38] because it is never mailed and it won't
[1:46:42] fail in this last day there will be
[1:46:45] those who started out who could back
[1:46:48] down into death again but I'm going to
[1:46:53] tell you that the Word of God also says
[1:46:56] that there's somebody going to be alive
[1:46:59] and remain to the coming of the Lord and
[1:47:02] they will not hinder those that are
[1:47:03] asleep and I'm going to tell you chokes
[1:47:06] we're not just going to be the living
[1:47:07] and breathing but there's gonna be a
[1:47:09] people alive they don't fire for God who
[1:47:12] will not be a little to see that people
[1:47:15] got their mind made up to hearty well
[1:47:17] Christ are you with me Church some
[1:47:20] people that are sold after God and they
[1:47:23] will break the cycle
[1:47:25] [Applause]
[1:47:27] did you hear what I said they will break
[1:47:30] the cycle they will break the cycle of
[1:47:33] sin and I believe and death and the
[1:47:36] creams and the dollars of man and there
[1:47:38] were people that will walk with Christ
[1:47:40] in his age but the madness I've wrote in
[1:47:47] our last week soul and saw the social
[1:47:49] respectability they replaced the
[1:47:53] primitive of Mosul ISM of Kemp meeting
[1:47:55] conversions with a more detailed
[1:47:57] intellectual process that led a
[1:48:01] criminally to conversion you know
[1:48:07] brother it's okay does that just have a
[1:48:10] little faith a little virtue a little
[1:48:13] paces you know you grow up a little more
[1:48:15] you're gonna be all right you've got the
[1:48:16] Holy Ghost
[1:48:17] you know you overcome that pornography
[1:48:19] just keeping it no you're not gonna
[1:48:22] overcome it I said you won't overcome it
[1:48:26] and you're gonna you're gonna have to
[1:48:28] die to it
[1:48:30] and you're gonna have to be born again
[1:48:32] and that's the problem today a man we
[1:48:37] turn churches we have turned churches
[1:48:39] into help centers our Ewing men
[1:48:45] treatment centers for sin hey man you
[1:48:49] know you can't get over sin you're just
[1:48:51] gonna send a little bit every day and
[1:48:53] you'll never live in victory you'll
[1:48:55] never really really overcome this stuff
[1:48:58] you know it went so it's a treatment
[1:49:00] center you know you get a little better
[1:49:01] and you fall back and you come on back
[1:49:03] to church and we'll help you to get
[1:49:05] going again
[1:49:06] whatever listen this gospel this blood
[1:49:10] is not a it's not something for
[1:49:12] treatment or sin it is a second chakra
[1:49:21] be you sad you're doubting your I
[1:49:23] believe in a Care Act
[1:49:25] what's the ball take didn't sire Adam
[1:49:30] out of your life you'll be a new
[1:49:32] creature in Christ but it isn't long we
[1:49:36] take a denominational attitude about
[1:49:38] church you know we once couldn't wait to
[1:49:44] get to church we were very eager to hear
[1:49:46] more about God learn about what he's
[1:49:47] doing but after a while it becomes old
[1:49:51] hat to us in case you don't know what
[1:49:56] that means it means something tediously
[1:49:59] familiar or outdated I wonder today if
[1:50:06] sermons like flashing red light the sign
[1:50:09] of his coming god of this evil age Satan
[1:50:13] Z why I'm against denominations many of
[1:50:19] those sermons invasion of the United
[1:50:22] States many of those sermons that
[1:50:25] brother branham priest
[1:50:26] we're not sound a little bit outdated
[1:50:40] that's the way it becomes expectation
[1:50:45] CSIS from looking and expecting Jesus to
[1:50:48] appear a mosque and I'm gonna tell you
[1:50:51] this is the way that every service must
[1:50:54] be we must come with expectation that
[1:50:58] we're gonna see Jesus he's gonna be in
[1:51:01] the songs he's gonna be in the prayers
[1:51:03] he's gonna be in the preaching he's
[1:51:06] gonna be in the convention he's gonna be
[1:51:08] in the sealing of the set that Jesus is
[1:51:12] gonna be present in ever service
[1:51:15] hallelujah and brother madam would say
[1:51:18] my could get this audience with one
[1:51:19] Accord to see and know exactly that
[1:51:22] Jesus Christ is alive and here among you
[1:51:25] all we said you physically or mentally
[1:51:27] believe it but when it can go beyond the
[1:51:29] mind do you know I did something will
[1:51:32] happen when you can realize the only
[1:51:35] thing is is to see Christ in our
[1:51:37] presence but like his room it becomes a
[1:51:45] ritualistic affair well I guess they
[1:51:49] need to get a lamb and they lose the
[1:51:51] sincerity of their worship the Bible
[1:51:56] said here they were commanded you must
[1:52:00] not present anything with a defect
[1:52:02] because it will not be accepted on your
[1:52:04] mouth he said here not to present any
[1:52:09] animal to the Lord it is blind the
[1:52:10] injured or maimed or anything with a
[1:52:13] running sore festering rash or scab you
[1:52:16] must not put any of those in the
[1:52:17] offering and all the altars and offered
[1:52:19] made by fire to the Lord brother brems
[1:52:24] of our Moloch is 1 in 6 and then but it
[1:52:29] just talks about a son honors his father
[1:52:31] and the servant is master but a man but
[1:52:34] if I am a father where's my honor and if
[1:52:36] if I'm a master words your fear of me
[1:52:39] say if the Lord of hosts you preach that
[1:52:41] despise my name but you ask how that we
[1:52:44] despise your name by presenting defiled
[1:52:46] food on my altar you asked how we
[1:52:48] defines you by saying that the table of
[1:52:51] Lord is contemptible when you offer
[1:52:53] blind the animals for sacrifice is it
[1:52:56] not wrong when you present the lame and
[1:52:58] the sick ones is it not wrong what do
[1:53:00] you offer one that offer them to your
[1:53:02] governor would he be pleased with you or
[1:53:04] show your favor outs the Lord of hosts
[1:53:06] and this is the way Israel came you know
[1:53:09] it didn't have the meaning anymore and
[1:53:12] God didn't deserve their fast anymore
[1:53:17] and I want you to know if he's here
[1:53:19] among us that we want him pleased with
[1:53:22] our worship
[1:53:24] with our offerings upon the altar a man
[1:53:27] we want him to feel welcome among us we
[1:53:30] want him to be so pleased he just comes
[1:53:33] down and bathes over the congregation
[1:53:35] and the Holy Ghost moved back and forth
[1:53:38] over the building in the people but see
[1:53:44] even Israel got this place they got to
[1:53:48] the place where they're so loathe it
[1:53:51] that like bread angels food bread from
[1:53:58] heaven
[1:53:59] see these are testing times and I want
[1:54:02] to say we are in testing times
[1:54:05] understand its hour of delay where men
[1:54:09] say the Lord has delayed is coming and
[1:54:11] the attitude of the people begin to
[1:54:14] change how many still connected ha how
[1:54:26] many just daydreaming
[1:54:29] nobody's daydreaming
[1:54:31] how many sleep
[1:54:35] I'm he's keyed in tuned in said the Lord
[1:54:39] speak to me today she got the quarrel
[1:54:43] and fussing with one another on the
[1:54:45] journey loathe in the light over the
[1:54:47] bread they wanted to go back to Egypt
[1:54:51] they lost their enthusiasm oh you know
[1:54:56] that's something we're not to have in
[1:54:57] church anymore is enthusiasm ma'am
[1:55:01] Lettie you know but yes it's brother
[1:55:05] Brennan said a hazy reason to dad has he
[1:55:08] raised if he hasn't then just forget it
[1:55:10] if he has let's get our enthusiasm
[1:55:13] started let's get filled with his spirit
[1:55:16] and go to prayin and start a meet and do
[1:55:18] something that is that's a 63 quote
[1:55:22] anyway a man he talked about the high
[1:55:25] priest you got in trouble for this one
[1:55:26] time brother David James telling about
[1:55:29] this were you where were you shared with
[1:55:32] some I think some Pentecostals about
[1:55:34] those that went and dressed the high
[1:55:36] priests going behind the holiest of
[1:55:38] Holies and he dress you know when they
[1:55:41] had a bell and a pomegranate weren't
[1:55:42] made a noise as he as he walked into the
[1:55:46] holiest of Holies and and those who were
[1:55:49] waiting on him to come out they could
[1:55:51] they could tell whether or not he was
[1:55:53] still alive because he was making some
[1:55:57] noise
[1:55:58] hey man and brother Maddon said a boy
[1:56:01] and where there ain't no noise then he
[1:56:03] might be dead well I think that's a
[1:56:06] whole lot of matter with our churches
[1:56:08] today there's not enough noise about it
[1:56:11] not enough enthusiasm not enough
[1:56:14] something to wear Jesus ears there's
[1:56:17] always noise
[1:56:19] [Applause]
[1:56:22] hallelujah
[1:56:23] hi man well you see again if you ain't
[1:56:26] hearing no noise in your church - got a
[1:56:28] dead church there are to be some noise
[1:56:32] of the praises of God trained singing
[1:56:59] everywhere Jesus is there's a lot of
[1:57:01] noise he said I don't know why it is but
[1:57:04] it's a sign there's life there hey man
[1:57:08] he said he said a lot of these churches
[1:57:11] have been need to be buried they've been
[1:57:13] dead a long time ago you don't hear no
[1:57:16] noise at all it's like a morgue instead
[1:57:18] of a lively place a place on fire for
[1:57:20] God and that's a 64 quote you know
[1:57:26] something he says has to move when he's
[1:57:29] around and he's referring to them that
[1:57:32] when they begin to cry out and begin to
[1:57:36] say you know Hosanna to the son of David
[1:57:39] and some of got jealous some have got
[1:57:47] jealous and said stop this noise stop
[1:57:51] them them children from from shouting
[1:57:53] and Saint Hosanna to the son of David
[1:57:55] stop all of this him Jesus said ha if
[1:57:58] they hold their peace the rocks will cry
[1:58:03] out
[1:58:04] amen that's gonna help honey that will
[1:58:08] worship him that's gonna have somebody
[1:58:10] that will give him praise that will
[1:58:13] honor his name this is what he says in
[1:58:18] spiritual amnesia notice today's crop
[1:58:21] notice what we do we actually got enough
[1:58:24] God about us who we come on the
[1:58:25] blackboard we say well yeah maybe I
[1:58:27] better come up now thats experience of
[1:58:29] worldwide yeah maybe I was better good
[1:58:32] I'd better go up and stand well I don't
[1:58:34] know Here I am see what a place to be in
[1:58:36] there is no fire burning there there is
[1:58:40] no enthusiasm there's not a go into it
[1:58:45] and as an evangelist that kills me to
[1:58:49] see God's people in that shape we're
[1:58:52] supposed to be on fire hey man
[1:58:57] but he said you know what it is
[1:58:58] revelation three lukewarm Laodicea a mom
[1:59:04] again brother Branham said of this she
[1:59:07] said so he said the bride is a part of
[1:59:11] the groom you know sue we find out it's
[1:59:13] the same thing she do exactly what's
[1:59:15] predicted for her to do this day she
[1:59:18] won't be allowed to see it but no means
[1:59:21] that lukewarm but she'll be on fire for
[1:59:24] God she'll be moving on in the spirits a
[1:59:31] ma'am he tells us in the Easter seal he
[1:59:35] said and I think we mustn't lose our
[1:59:38] enthusiasm he tells us in the message
[1:59:43] ashamed and he says the revival among
[1:59:46] the churches has died everybody knows
[1:59:48] that you'd feel it in this Tabernacle
[1:59:51] you feel it everywhere it's a thump but
[1:59:53] that feeling that something isn't right
[1:59:55] is because the revival enthusiasm has
[1:59:58] gone away from the people going to
[2:00:00] churches you see them sitting there al
[2:00:02] pastor stumbling around for a message or
[2:00:05] something another first thing you know
[2:00:06] he's turned out to some kind of party
[2:00:08] they're gonna have her something it
[2:00:10] seems to be a dead stuff everywhere
[2:00:15] brother branham would say an invisible
[2:00:18] union I'm not looking for revival in our
[2:00:22] generation I'm looking for the coming of
[2:00:25] the Lord in our generation so you say
[2:00:29] brother Jim then what should we expect
[2:00:32] well we shouldn't expect a worldwide
[2:00:34] revival a man we shouldn't expect
[2:00:39] another denominational move a man no we
[2:00:44] should not expect that we're not looking
[2:00:45] for that we're looking for the coming of
[2:00:47] the Lord a man but but he's saying but
[2:00:50] listen brother Brennan said in the
[2:00:52] Easter seal listen the listener he said
[2:00:55] men and women
[2:00:56] it'll make you stand to your feet it'll
[2:00:58] make you do things that God wants you to
[2:01:00] do I don't care what somebody else says
[2:01:02] about you the neighbor said oh that
[2:01:04] person's lost their mind pray all night
[2:01:06] to read the Bible I don't care what this
[2:01:08] is what God told you to do that's right
[2:01:11] oh they say we can't have these are
[2:01:14] old-fashioned Pentecostal revivals oh
[2:01:17] yes we can - you can have it in yourself
[2:01:22] and you are the majority and God no
[2:01:26] matter what the rest of them think
[2:01:29] [Music]
[2:01:31] hallelujah the world ain't gonna have
[2:01:33] one but you can have one hallelujah
[2:01:36] God's will have a bride who's in love
[2:01:38] with him who's enthused about him who
[2:01:42] wants to get him at that Tudor home of
[2:01:45] the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly
[2:01:47] bride who wants to see the world come to
[2:01:49] an end and a people go into a rapture
[2:01:52] but people who are looking for the
[2:01:54] coming of the Lord and the focuses is
[2:01:57] Synod on that hallelujah God he said
[2:02:02] send us for a Bible all of these are
[2:02:05] from 63 on send us a revival before we
[2:02:08] perish that's right we need an
[2:02:11] old-fashioned God sent so Stern revival
[2:02:15] yes Frank Christ back among us find
[2:02:18] Christ in the old fashioned altars and
[2:02:20] meetings that we used to have years ago
[2:02:22] oh my think about that he said the
[2:02:26] reason why we don't have it
[2:02:29] we went off and left Christ that's right
[2:02:33] that's what it was breached
[2:02:35] grumblin carnality cut off the water
[2:02:39] supply think of this people left the
[2:02:41] muddy waters of Egypt to drink from a
[2:02:45] spiritual rock and they were complaining
[2:02:48] people leaving the fleshpots and the
[2:02:51] garlic in Egypt Teen Angels food and
[2:02:54] they were still complaining hey man they
[2:02:57] were leaving the boasting physicians
[2:02:59] amides of saying the days of miracles
[2:03:01] are past and no such things as miracles
[2:03:03] anymore and to go out among people with
[2:03:06] signs following
[2:03:07] with the sign of the king and the camp
[2:03:10] and great wonders and signs and pillow
[2:03:12] fire hanging over them and the blessings
[2:03:15] are fallen and Spears of mana out of
[2:03:18] heaven and they were still grumbly and
[2:03:22] the prophets words is it was an insult
[2:03:26] to their maker
[2:03:29] you see there's got to be a love affair
[2:03:33] come on a love affair man I might have
[2:03:38] to bring this down here first
[2:03:39] in a few minutes there's still some
[2:03:42] points I want to get to but you see what
[2:03:46] happened was is they come in the dry
[2:03:50] places that came into the desert of
[2:03:53] Horeb Horeb means a dry place a desert
[2:03:56] and when we get out of fellowship with
[2:04:01] one another in the church and out of
[2:04:03] fellowship with the Holy Spirit it
[2:04:05] brings us to a dry place a desert where
[2:04:11] everything's got stickers right hey man
[2:04:15] you know in the desert a little piece of
[2:04:18] cactus with that sticker on it it's
[2:04:22] amazing what brother branham can look at
[2:04:24] the earth cactus and see he would say I
[2:04:27] see that sticker being a little tinder
[2:04:32] leaf that because of the desert
[2:04:36] conditions it all shriveled up and
[2:04:39] tightened up until it becomes a sticker
[2:04:46] amen
[2:04:48] are you with me now a precious tender
[2:04:52] leaf that had no water wound itself up
[2:04:57] so tight until it's a sticker a precious
[2:05:00] so if it had been water right a man if
[2:05:06] it had been watered right a man would
[2:05:08] have been a tender little leaf or
[2:05:10] something but instead it's wound itself
[2:05:13] up until it's a sticker a man it just
[2:05:17] needs water
[2:05:19] it's been punchy that everything is
[2:05:22] picking everything criticized and
[2:05:25] everything and it's a precious little
[2:05:29] leaf that all it needs is water all it
[2:05:34] needs is water all it needs is the rock
[2:05:37] to open up for people that knows how to
[2:05:40] speak to that rock but Briana
[2:05:44] [Applause]
[2:05:56] Daniel Williams was dying he's out in a
[2:06:01] wheelchair his boy came to see him in a
[2:06:04] pair of shorts at the end of church
[2:06:10] service showed up in a pair of shorts I
[2:06:15] said something to the boy I said son you
[2:06:19] know what your daddy's preached and how
[2:06:21] he's tried to stand for truth I said
[2:06:24] it's offensive for you to come home to
[2:06:26] an address like this in front of the
[2:06:29] church and church people and right in
[2:06:31] the face of your daddy who's tried to
[2:06:34] hold to the truth and you're in a pair
[2:06:36] of shorts and Daniel looked he said Oh
[2:06:41] Tim he looked at me he looked at me he
[2:06:45] said Oh Tim he's just a thirsty soul a
[2:07:01] thirsty soul that somehow never got his
[2:07:04] roots in the water and he's out here
[2:07:08] trying to satisfy it with the world with
[2:07:12] sin with drunkenness with women with and
[2:07:14] here he comes and it shows us of
[2:07:16] innocence all over his body it's because
[2:07:19] he's thirsty and because of that you
[2:07:25] know he's thinking against the things of
[2:07:27] God but you know there's church members
[2:07:31] that get sticky are you with me that you
[2:07:35] become stickers you don't know this he
[2:07:38] you know it's just him there near a dry
[2:07:40] place and they need a revival hallelujah
[2:07:45] that's why we need water in every
[2:07:47] service that we have it because they're
[2:07:50] those that are still cactuses among us
[2:07:53] and they need a drink
[2:07:54] that's pinnacle so water I'm gonna make
[2:07:57] their leaves come out
[2:07:59] and become fellowship again instead of
[2:08:05] criticizing and finding fault Moses went
[2:08:17] to that rock that rock he was to get
[2:08:21] water out of this dry place God told
[2:08:25] Moses take that rock and gather the
[2:08:27] people gather the elders and I'll stand
[2:08:32] on the rock before you this rock was
[2:08:34] Christ that's what it represented Christ
[2:08:37] come on help me and man Moses took that
[2:08:41] rod that had brought judgment of old
[2:08:44] each other come on man it had smoked the
[2:08:48] waters and then it turned to blood it is
[2:08:51] smoke the frogs it is then called for
[2:08:53] frogs and corrupt their deaths and the
[2:08:55] Flies and ruptor they're dancin and
[2:08:58] brought darkness over the land rough
[2:09:00] death on the first floor and are you
[2:09:02] with me don't sound to the to the Red
[2:09:04] Sea and it switched it out there and it
[2:09:07] makes the way across and then lift it
[2:09:09] over again Aaron left and let down and
[2:09:11] waters come gentlemen it was a judgement
[2:09:16] rod is somebody with me and the israel
[2:09:22] now was in sin and they were grumbling
[2:09:25] and complaining and in a dry place
[2:09:28] amen to the point that Moses said now
[2:09:32] what to do with these people anymore
[2:09:38] and God see he's putting out the people
[2:09:45] the people the people and God said take
[2:09:50] the rod
[2:09:52] that brought judgment on the Egyptians
[2:09:56] that brought judgment against sin but
[2:10:02] instead of fighting the people who
[2:10:05] deserved to die what I want you to do is
[2:10:08] factor out don't you know what happened
[2:10:14] sense was price we were sinners and
[2:10:21] sentence could be but what we deserve to
[2:10:25] die in the judgement robbed us like us
[2:10:28] he's from Christ on our behalf and he
[2:10:34] was wounded for our transgressions he
[2:10:36] was bruised for our iniquities and the
[2:10:39] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[2:10:42] so that bomb strikes we are
[2:10:59] [Applause]
[2:11:21] and there was a cleft in the rock so
[2:11:25] that life-giving water would pour out of
[2:11:29] Jesus hallelujah and there on the day of
[2:11:34] Pentecost is somebody with me amen Derek
[2:11:38] Calvary he was smitten and on the day of
[2:11:40] Pentecost outcome pouring lye give me
[2:11:44] water

[2:11:49] the Spirit of God they began to speak in

[2:11:54] dance around and act like bananas

[2:47:22] amen do you know it's real hey man
[2:47:25] praise God I'd know it's real God
[2:47:28] changed our lives and made us new in
[2:47:30] Christ if you look here behind me today
[2:47:33] we have a crucifix that's not an idol
[2:47:35] that we worship that is simply a
[2:47:38] representation of Jesus death upon the
[2:47:42] cross it's given to me many many years
[2:47:46] ago in the 70s as a young pastor by a
[2:47:49] pastor friend brother George liquors and
[2:47:51] in Alabama and he gave me this crucifix
[2:47:56] here and but it's symbolic as we have it
[2:48:00] over this baptistry it's symbolic that
[2:48:03] we are to be dead and crucified with
[2:48:07] Christ and being that we're dead and
[2:48:10] crucified with Christ we are to rise in
[2:48:13] the newness of life after being buried
[2:48:16] and so of course we wouldn't just
[2:48:19] sprinkle a little water upon someone a
[2:48:21] little dirt upon someone and say they
[2:48:23] are buried but they must be immersed in
[2:48:26] water baptism and this is Scripture all
[2:48:31] through the Bible and there's never
[2:48:34] anywhere anywhere place in the Bible
[2:48:37] where anybody was ever baptized in any
[2:48:39] other way than the name of our Lord
[2:48:42] Jesus Christ and we come today in
[2:48:45] obedience to that to fulfill God's Word
[2:48:48] and to know that he sent us into all the
[2:48:51] world to preach the gospel and those
[2:48:54] that believed and that we that we would
[2:48:57] we are to baptize them and he gave us an
[2:49:00] order to baptize him in the name of the
[2:49:03] Father and the Son and of the Holy Ghost
[2:49:04] and we know that name
[2:49:07] is the Lord Jesus Christ and so today in
[2:49:10] obedience to that divine command were
[2:49:12] coming today to bury sister Shasta she
[2:49:16] has testified that she has given her
[2:49:20] life to Christ the old man is dead and
[2:49:23] we are going to bury it that she might
[2:49:26] rise in the newness of life to serve the
[2:49:29] Lord Jesus as a new creation Amen sister
