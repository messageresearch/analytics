deliverance in the land there's holy ghost in the land there's salvation in the land the land belongs to you now turns lord we've seen the evidence all over our lives wonderful amen and amen let's just go to the lord and pray our father thank you for the evidence lord thank you for a land that flows with milk and honey lord thank you for the fruits of the land lord a word that's been opened up to a people father lord we can come into the realities of the holy ghost lord we can come into follow the rims of the supernatural dear god and lord no longer on the outskirts looking in but father we're on the inside father feasting on the great things of god and we just trust today father you'll come by once again and speak to us lord minister to the lives to our hearts to our needs this morning oh god may we just feast once again on the evidence the evidence that's in the land god we're so thankful for what you've done in our lives where you brought us from lord god we can look back years ago in the life that we once lived and we see where we are now and it's all about your mercy and all by your grace dear god truly the evidence is all over us it's all over even like tabernacles all over the bride worldwide and we just asked the lord you'd have preeminence today you'll bless this service you just come by and speak to us father for us in jesus name amen amen hallelujah love the lord this morning hey man let me just find my place here just thinking about wednesday night and trying to figure out what to preach you know sometimes you just a minister will study and have things on his heart and then only to get to it and things just completely change at the last minute and i'm just thinking about wednesday night and how the lord just used the end of the service and we had all the evidence of the land and we know that it's a good land and you know i just couldn't get away from it so today we're just going to look at the promised land and as it pertains to the believer and i want to speak to you on god does impossible math part 17 but i want to give this a subtitle make your move i want to be personal to each of you this morning not your neighbor not your mama not your daddy not your brother not your sister but you got to make your move amen we find here in deuteronomy verse 1 or chapter 1 and verse 19 and when and when they had departed from horeb we went through all the great terrible wilderness which you saw by the way of the mountains of the amorites as the lord our god commanded us and we came to kadesh barnea and i said unto you you are coming to the mountain of the amorites notice he's telling them where they're coming you're coming to the mountain of the amorites which the lord our god doeth give unto us behold the lord thy god set the land before thee go up and possess it as the lord our god of thy fathers hath said unto thee fear not neither be discouraged and you came near unto me every one of you and said well we will send men before us that they shall search out the land and bring us word again by what way we must go up and into what cities we shall come and the saying pleased me well and i took 12 men of you one of a tribe and they turned and they went to the mountain and they came into the valley of escola and they searched it out and they took the fruit of the land in their hands and they brought it down unto us and brought us word again and said it is a good land which the lord our god doeth give us not withstanding you would not go up but rebelled against the commandment of the lord your god and you murmured in your tents and you said because the lord hated us now notice how the devil can flip the script the lord hateth us and he has brought us forth out of the land of egypt to deliver us into the hand of the amorites to destroy us now god just said i've taken you to the land of amorite so you can have it it's going to be yours whether whither shall we go up our brethren have discouraged our hearts saying the people is greater and taller than we the cities are great and walled up to heaven moreover we have seen the sins of anakin's there then i said unto you dread not neither be afraid of them the lord your god goeth before you he shall fight for you according to all that he did for you in the in egypt before your eyes and in the wilderness where thou seen how the lord thy god bear thee as a man do with bury his son and all the way that you went until he came into this place yet in the thing you did not believe the lord your god who went in the way before you to search out the place to put your tents in in the fire by night and to show you by way you should go in the cloud by day you can have your seats this morning like i said we want to speak to you this morning and i'll make your move and we find that the children of israel have come through egypt they come out they crossed over uh the red sea god done miraculous they've seen the ten supernatural signs being performed and yet they get to a place brother will call it as the scripture says kadesh barnea and this word cadish barnea means a holy place of desert wandering it's uh the judgment seat of the word a judgment seat of god it's a it's a word showdown it's a place that the children of israel had to make their decision on what they were going to do were they going to trust god and move into the land or were they going to listen to the unbelief of the spies and camp down on where they were at and and i believe before us lays here this morning we have a kadesh bar near setting before us do we allow our doubts to keep us out of the land do we allow our doubts to keep us from living free do we eventually die in the desert in this wasteland of never overcoming never ever been able to rise above some sin or some habit never able to claim the promise for myself because we're afraid to trust god maybe you've seen somebody go out in faith and or go out and try to trust god and they failed and you're looking at their failure and you say well if they couldn't do it i can't do it either and we realize every person here this morning you're seated at a k-dish barnea you have a decision that you must make every service is a showdown every service is have to make a decision will i believe the message will i move further with god or will i will i allow the word to change me or will i continue to circle around the mountain of unbelief that i've been camped out around so they come and they come out of sin they come out of unbelief they left the harsh treatment of egypt they left the world they put all these things aside and here they followed the word they followed the prophet until they got to this point and this was a very pivotal point in their walk in their journey do you take god at his word do we believe god sent a vindicated prophet do we move into the land or do we listen to all the hearsay and all the negativity that surrounds the messes of the hour do we do we believe all the negativity about brother branham and about how he missed it and about has humanity got in the way and and we listen to all the lies of the enemy or do we listen to what the word of god says i've given you the land the land belongs to you i'm bringing you to the place of the amorites but the land is yours you must go in at once and possess the land now brother baby tell us here in the message the results of decision he says we're no longer in egypt we've done pulled up our tent stakes and left we've come through the red sea the blood of the lord jesus we've seen all the old habits and things of life drowned the taskmasters that drove us through the bar rooms and to the cocktail lounges and so forth we've seen all that drown like pharaoh and his horses and now then we're in the wilderness moving along following the angel of the covenant the holy spirit and knowing that we're on the road to the great land he says they'll be here and during the days of the millennium he says and we're going for a thousand years in a million but he's saying we're on the road to the great land we're on the road to our millennium we're on the road into the promised land so there they were taking a physical exodus they were leaving egypt behind and if we're in another exodus church that means we're going to find another cadence barney that means god is bringing a people to a pivotal point do you move on with god do you move on with the word or do you stay camped out what i believe do you stay camped out with your sickness do you stay camped out with the things that beset you before or do you pack up your stead steak and move forward say god i'm trusting you i don't know how i'm gonna get through it god but i'm gonna believe anyway god i don't care what's in the land i'm trusting you lord because you gave a promise you gave a word you gave us an exposition to go forth into the land and possess what belongs to you see we got to get to a point in the journey where we have to make a decision trust god and go or listen to the negativity and we find that because of their negative report they discouraged and disillusioned many of the would-be believers and if we listen to the discouragement we listen to the lies we listen to believe the sign and all that filth and garbage what is it does it discourages the believer it disillusions because what is satan trying to he's trying to plant a seed of negativity he's trying to plant a seed of doubt and if you give reason if you give a credence to that doubt that doubt begins to overtake you and you can't see the blessings that's in the promised land program says the greatest sin i find in the church today is unbelief notice not out in the world but the greatest sin that he finds in the church today is unbelief that's the only sin there is there's no other sin but unbelief how much of that is night out there how much is dark you couldn't say this much as dark go out from my hands it's all dark he says now there's only one way to designate and determine sin and that isn't about whether you drink or whether you smoke or whether you gamble is designated this way because you are an unbeliever you do that because you're an unbeliever he said if you was a believer a firm believer those things will be dead and black as the night is before you certainly those things are attributed to unbelief and we find unbelief kept those out of the promised land and unbelief in the church of the living god today will keep us out of the promised land it'll keep the spirit of god from moving it'll hinder every service it'll keep people cramped down and they can't rise up and accept the promises of god we need to get our belief out of our midst and trust god and believe god and serve god and say yes lord your word is james your word is amen your word belongs to me i'll take the land [Applause] see their failure the failure of the children of israel at cadence barnea was due to their unbelief toward god and toward his promise see god is faithful and his word cannot fail but the people neither believe god nor do they believe the promise that's right well i know we all have at some point have the enemy sit on our shoulder and whisper in our ear it's not for you you can't take it you're not good enough you're a nobody a has been never will be right see their unbelief though offended god their unbelief offended god they refused to go up and possess the land and they began to murmur in their houses around the dinner table they begin to murmur in the tents where brothers so and so this and brother seven said that and this sister and that sister and the first thing you know is they killed the influence they killed the influence of the land the land had this and the land had that but because they began to murmur and show all the negativity and all the faults in all the humanity it kept others from wanting to enter into the land it discouraged all the other believers from going into the land and we find those that genuinely don't believe they're the ones that don't fully obey they may dress like a believer they may act like a believer when they're around believers they may talk like a believer but when it comes to the showdown deep in their heart they don't believe there's something that's nagging that them said this is not for you this is not for you and we find they're willing to die out there in their own ideas than to take god at his word they're willing to circle out in the wilderness versus go into the promised land of truth deuteronomy 1 and verse 6 it said the lord our god spake unto us in horrible saying you have dealt long enough in this mount you have dealt here long enough and some of us we have camped down on ideas we have camped down on why we can't do it why we this why aren't we that i believe i can say that we have camped down and we've been at this mountain long enough it's time this mountain of sickness has to leave and we move forward this time this situation it may be unsurmountable it may be a great big mountain in your life but you've been camped there long enough it's time to go forward maybe it's some habit that's keeping you from receiving the holy ghost it's time that you go forward you've camped out there long enough you've you disbelieved the word long enough now it's time to go forward some of you camped down on justification but i want you to know you need to move on into the sanctification and those of you here today that you camped down on sanctification you're just good we're living a sanctified christian life it's time that you move forward into the baptism of the holy ghost you move forward into the promised land of the word and either the things of the lord even the greatness of god it's time that we pack up we dealt in this mountain long enough it's time to move church it's time that the church of the living god makes its move right now [Applause] it's time that we take our journey into the promised land of the opening of the word we're no longer look this message is no longer in its infancy we're no longer a little baby this message has been the pride has come to maturity and it's time that we possess all that belongs to us we were without excuse today the word has been opened and we now know what he wants done with this bird he's looking for somebody brother aaron that will believe somebody that will believe against all the naysayers somebody's gonna take him at his word god gave the promise that the land is before you and all he's looking for is somebody that'll say i'll go i'll go i don't care what they say i don't care what they criticize i don't care how i have to act i don't care what our service looks like i'm willing to go i'm willing to trust god i want to let myself go and get be influenced by the supernatural if it means i speak in tongues i'll speak in tongues if it means i'll dance in the spirit i'll dance in the spirit if it means i'll run around the church i'll run around the church if it means i'll say amen to the word i'll respond back to the word i'm ready to go [Applause] go and occupy the land belongs to you the promise belongs to you deuteronomy 1 and verse 20 and i said unto you you are come unto the mountain of the amorites which the lord our god does give unto us notice it's a promise he's given it to you behold the lord thy god has set the land before thee go up and possess it as the lord god of thy fathers has said unto thee fear not neither be discouraged see every promise is yeah and amen to the believer every promise in the book brother brown said belongs to the believer now how many is a believer this morning so every promise belongs to you now you search your life you do an inventory of your life is there a promise out there that's just in reach that you haven't attained to yet it belongs to you make your move it's time to make your move you can't sit i don't you can't stay where you are you're going to die bro man says now christ keeps all his words he has to he has to do it i don't have to do it i'm mortal subject to mistakes but he is immortal infallible he has to keep it but i don't have to keep mine you don't have to keep yours but he does oh doesn't that place something in you to know that he he absolutely is or he's absolutely bound to that word god is absolutely jesus is absolutely bound to that word and we find here in ephesians 5 and verse 27 that he might present to himself a glorious church now that's a promise god is going to have a bride he's going to have a glorious church not having a spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish and then the message is invisible union the prophet of god i believe he tapped into the mind of god and show you us exactly who we are in this hour he says you are the pure virtuous sinless bride of the son of the living god every man woman that's born of the spirit of god and washed in the blood of jesus christ and believes every word of god stands as though you never sin in the first place you are perfect this is a promise given to you oh you make wake up in the morning you look in the mirror and the first thing you see is false first thing you see is failures first thing you see is shortcomings but god doesn't see your faults he doesn't see your shortcoming he doesn't see your affairs he says you are the pure virtuous sinless bride of the son of the living god every man and woman that's born of the spirit of god and washed in the blood of jesus and believes every word of god every word of god you stand as though you never sin in the first place see you're standing completely you never seen it the first place god don't even know it's in the sea of forgiveness you never did it you were accused of it by the accuser but really from the beginning you were predestinated to be a son and daughter of god you're standing there washed see your old book of divorcement is put away it's dead absolutely out of existence even in the mind of god you're the virtuous bride of christ washed in the blood of christ precious virtuous sinless son of god standing with a pure unadulterated bride word that he's washed by the water of his own blood that become flesh and manifested that he might take you which was predestinated in the bosom of the father before the beginning the same as he was hope that's who we are church that's the promise to you this morning oh you're not some little sinner you're not some castaway you're not some cast down i know you're the pure the sinless bride of jesus christ that's who you are that's what the word claims that's manna leave from the heavenly land that's the word from the promised land telling you who you are not what you want see that's the promise to every believer that's promised land man you never sinned in the first place in the first place you were in the mind of god in the first place god never seen you as a sinner in the first place you were a thought of god and god saw you as the son and a daughter of god you're standing the pure unadulterated bright word that's who you are that's what god wants you to understand this morning and you can claim that that's your promise now go and take the land so but israel made their mistake they turned and went into the mountain they came to the valley of escort they searched it out they took the fruit of the land and their hands noticed they partook of it even like tabernacle we are without excuse we have seen cancer delivered cancer delivered cancer delivered we have seen the supernatural we have seen eyes being opened we have seen god moving the miraculous in this church we have tasted of the land we have placed it in our hands service after service after service we have seen the dynamics follow the mechanics and produce what the word said it would produce he says they took of the fruit of the land in their hands and they brought it down unto us and brought us word again and they said it is a good land which the lord our god doeth give us notwithstanding you would not go up but rebelled against the commandment of the lord notice israel made its mistake when it stopped israel made its mistake when it stopped see if they had went on they would have possessed the promised land right there for god gave them the promise he's good to his promise if they had gone on over but they stopped marching and notice he said when they stop or when they stopped marching they started wandering now you're at a cadis you can keep marching or you can start wondering see when you stop moving forward in this present truth you start wondering is it for me is it for my family have my kids gone too far have they sent away their day of grace i got all these faults you begin to complain we begin to murmur we're thinking to find what so and so did this and so and so it said that you know the problem church is not so and so the problem is you stop short of the promise you find people you've been around people we all have it seems like every time you get around they're talking about a problem they're talking about this they're talking about that and they fail to do a deep dive into their own self and realize there's a common denominator and all this in the common denominator it's me it's because i stop short of the promise because if you keep walking into the promised land you're not looking at this and you're not looking at that you're tasting you're feasting on the grapes you're feasting on the heavenly manna you're not worried about what this one said or how that one acted no you've got the land in your hands and you're a potato of the heavenly promise we wonder about this and we wonder about that is this right and that's right what about the cloud was it really a rocket or was it the head of christ what about the bridge how many fell you know we were we're wondering about the humanity of a prophet not allowing him to be a human are you making him infallibly wonder about is the holy ghost for us can i be healed have i gone too far can i even enter into the land is there enough time for my children to come back see the promised land is unto you unto your children unto them that are far off those that ain't even looking to come to church those that ain't been looking for god the promise is still unto them because the promise pertains to you you got sons you got daughters out there in the wilderness wasteland you keep believing you keep trusting because the promise is yours the promise is unto them that are far off not even looking for god god's able to reach down and get them keep believing until you see it manifested notice what they said in numbers 13 verse 27 and they told him and they said we came unto the land whether thou sentenced us and surely surely it floweth with milk and honey and here this is the fruit of it could you imagine you come before a prophet he sent you down into the land and you come back bearing fruit the pet scan two months before showed cancer two minutes after after you visit the promised land for 40 days there's no cancer and then you refuse to go in you refuse to tell people god's a healer god still does miraculous god still saves because you're worried all the days and miracles has passed let the naysayers say what they want we got the promised land in our hands see nevertheless the people notice the people be strong that dwell in the land the cities are wall they're very great and moreover we saw the children of anak there and the amalekites rather than the land of the south and the hittites and the jebusites and the amorites dwell in the mountains and the canaanites dwell by the sea and the coasts of jordan notice these 10 of the 12 spies came back and all of them had evidences they were non-believers to this point but they went into the land and they come back with fruits the evidence all over their life they were probably wiping grape juice off of them they had the evidence it was all over them they've been in the promised land but notice they walked through the land they explored every inch of the promised land their eyes witnessed the amazing amazing things of the land the beauty in which it be held they tasted of all that it had to offer they said it was a land that flowed with milk and honey and milk and honey depicts fertility of the soul productive in a prosperous land a land that was rich in natural resources that you could cultivate and produce in the oriental the milk and honey represented food for the gods and we find this land here they come back they said this land is only fit for god and what am i telling you church i'm telling you this is your land you are sons and daughters of the most high god he will call you messiah that's where we're going it's the land only fit for god not for unbelievers and we're not unbelievers but we're believers this morning and the land belongs to you but you got to take your time you got to make your move and enter into that later possess everything but notice they went in for 40 days and explored the promise man they've seen cancer healed they've seen the supernatural man they seen one event after another event they had speaking in tongues they had all kind of supernatural experiences in the land but when they came back there's giants in the land we can't take it we can't take it it's not for us there's the sons of of anakin are there and the jebusites and this one there the people they're strong in the land the cities are walled up every excuse they could come up with to not occupy the land every excuse see it's like the devil to bring a negative report to scare you from going beyond the negativity and reaching into the promise you know i love how brother man would say and he would say the devil is nothing but a scarecrow he just scares you into something he has no legal rights at all he was stripped of every right principality he spoiled everything when he died at calvary he said there was a man that lived down here who really loved birds i'm not sure what's going on here on the platform but something is not right okay there was a man that lived down here and he really loved birds and he had a wild strawberry patch and he wouldn't let nobody bother he kept that for the birds he went to florida one year he didn't come back in time and some fella wanted to pick them barry so he he put a big old scarecrow out in the field like that notice somebody came into his land and erected a scarecrow because he wanted the berries for himself he wanted what was in that promised land for himself he says now he said well all these birds are making their habit of coming every year they come and they found this great big patch and it had this scarecrow in it and some of them were just sitting way up in the trees some of the telephone wires some on the poles and some were just squawking and carrying on about it why is this scarecrow there we can't get in there we used to come here time and time and we used to go and we used to eat these strawberries but now we can't go in there's a big scarecrow he goes well i thought that was amazing but somehow right in the middle of the patch setting right there the arm of the scarecrow said two big crows just eating till their belly was full and they was hard as they could go two big scarecrows wasn't worried about with a staircar two big crows they wasn't worried about the scarecrow they knew what was beyond the scarecrow what am i telling you church satan is there to put scarecrow after scrackle in your life but just go beyond the scarecrow we have tasted up the evidence we have tasted on the land we know that it belongs to us we've been here once before we've been here before now go beyond the scarecrow go beyond the things that you see the things that you feel the things that the little awkward moments in your life and move into the blessed promised land they come to the borderland cadis barnea but they make a great mistake notice they made a great mistake we can't take it they're three days journey from enter and in three days three days journey from the blessed promised land all the trouble all the tolls of life all the hardships all the fear of pharaoh all that behind them three days journey from moving in and here they were they go in and they said there's grass we're grasshoppers so they looked at their circumstances instead of looking at the promise they looked at the walled cities instead of looking at the promise they look at what we're not able to do in our humanity instead of looking at the one who gave the promise see we've been taught by this message though not to look at circumstances we've been taught to look at the word in the word only we've been taught to believe the promises of god and so many believers continue to look at the giants so many believers today continue to look at the giants and allow the scarecrows from keep you from living a victorious life scarecrows are complexes scarecrows of depression scarecrows of fear scarecrows of unbelief scarecrows of sickness that you're never going to get well to keep you from feasting within the land see because they lack faith all the spies except caleb and joshua were discouraged and we find many preachers and many pastors today they don't want prayer lines they don't want prayer lines they don't want to move another spirit in their church though they've been in and received and testified of the promised land well they've been in there and they've seen the tongues of the real initial tongues they've received a genuine tongues they've seen the miraculous take place they've seen a real dance they've seen a real movement of the spirit but when they come back they don't want their churches to have that they don't want their churches to be labeled pentecostal though they were willing and they enjoyed their time in pentecost in the promised land but because everybody else was nay saying this and you know we got to get away from pentecost and we're not going back to azusa pentecost but in order to go into the promised land we got to go back to the original we got to go back because look this book of acts is going to produce the same book of acts it's going to produce the same signs the same wonders this branch ever puts forth another branch it's going to be exactly like the first branch but see their doubt had turned to unbelief and their unbelief caused them to rebel against god see their doubt turned to unbelief and their unbelief caused him to rebel numbers 13 and verse 27 we came unto the lamb whether thou sent us notice how they interpret this we came into the land whether thou sent us not the land the lord our god is giving us see they didn't take possession of the promise lord you're sending us here but not this is the land that god is giving us and i want you to know church god has given us a great land god has given us a tremendous land this is not a land that that we're just to go into that he sent us out to explore no he's given us this land and yet when they got there they saw grasshop or they saw josh and they they saw themselves as grasshoppers and they looked at the obstacles they looked at the giants they looked at the walled cities they allowed everything that they saw with their flesh to influence their perception of the land they looked at the people they looked at all these things and i wonder how many times we look at the circumstances it's not for me how many devils ever told you that it's not for you see their eyes were on the obstacles on the giants on the walled cities and their eyes wasn't on the promise and they allow what they saw in their flesh to influence their perception i wonder you know and we think about this we only see how big our situation is a lot of times we only see how difficult our trial is because we're human and that's what we can relate to but church we got to realize how big our god is we got to realize who made us the promise he made us the promise nothing will stand before your prayer not even cancer see if they would only looked at god by faith they would have seen the one that made the promise they would have been another caleb and another josh would have been 12 caleb's and 12 joshuas versus 10 and 2. but we find back their crowd of unbelief had such an influence and a sway over the people that the entire congregation began to withdraw themselves from the promise they were excited at one point man they've seen the miraculous they've seen the the evidence of the land they were willing to go but as they heard all the negativity and all the the bad report they were willing to settle to live on the outskirts of the promise and never obtained and never occupy than to go in and possess the land for themselves they were willing to live on the outskirts of the promise just so far looking over just so far looking over looking over to somebody else's house that has victory looking over in somebody else's house that their children are serving the lord looking over in somebody else's house that where they got true divine healing and miracles taking place they were willing to sit back on the outskirts and look what god is doing versus partaking of it themselves they resolve themselves just to be wilderness wonders rather than possessors of the promise and i hope i'm speaking to possessors of the promise this morning not wilderness wonders see we're not a people that are to pull back from the promise god gave us a promise and he said heavens and earth will pass away before his word will pass away and we know that the word of god will not return boy so we need to train our attention to look away from our obstacles look away from the situations and the hard trials and look to the word of god look to the one who gave the promise to us as believers see our unbelief will always see the obstacles you can always count on that your unbelief will see the obstacles your unbelief will see the challenges your unbelief will say we are not able i can't measure up but faith will always see the opportunity your faith in the promised world will place you into the land of promise and we find here in philippians 4 and verse 13 the bible says i can do all things through christ see that's faith that's not unbelief unbelief says you can't measure up unbelief says we can't take the land but we find faith says i can do all things i can do whatever the lord tells me that i can do and we find notice moses here in numbers 13 and verse 1 the lord spoke to him they said moses pick you some men and send them over into the lamb and moses picks every he picks a ruler among them notice he picks a special man out of every tribe and this man wasn't just men they wasn't just some fly by light but they were preachers moses hand-picked certain preachers to go into the land and tell them how good the land is and these preachers got down there and they enjoyed the benefits of the land they enjoyed the supernatural presence of the land but when it came back to influence earth to influence their churches they said it's not for us we don't want to be labeled pentecost it's all emotion it's all work we're okay with our psychology we're okay with our intellectual doctrine we got the message and that's all we got the mechanics church if we're not careful that's where every message church is headed oh we got the message and absolutely right we got it we got the evidence we've got to have more than just the evidence we've got to have the land don't settle for just the evidence notice brother brown would say when they got to cades the judgment seat then the testing time come so i want you to notice after the great miracles and things that were ready to go over and possess the land and the testing time come they were afraid to go and i think brethren today that's what the matter with the church is at the end of the great doctors and the theology i think the testing time for the church he goes i think it's a testing time for the church i wonder how many see the great miracles that are done here at even like tabernacle how many witness the living god manifesting here in our church how many look and they desire the freedom of worship that we have here but when it comes time to say let's go we can do this they pull back we don't want that in our church well they they like it they like what they see or maybe even someone will say well you know what that's just emotion or that's just work of them young kids they need to have some church order obama says now he says and just before going in they sent 12 spies that come back and when they did 10 of the spies oh it's a good land the 12 said it's good said it had a bunch of grapes cut down that two of them in packed and there it's a land flowing with milk and honey he goes i imagine that it was a pretty good bait don't you milk and honey that would make a good pentecostal cocktail he goes wine milk honey all stirred together man talk about vitamins that's more than a drugstore ever did have oh what's wrong with a pentecostal cocktail no today we got dead churches we've got dead preachers we've got churches that don't got no young people because there ain't no preaching to inspire them there's nothing there they went into the land they know that the land they know that the land of the message is good they know that it can produce the results but they're afraid to let the land be to be manifested in their church he says now notice he said it's flowing with milk and honey ten of them's oh but brethren we can't do it it's all walled up it's impossible the denominations are too high i'm telling you just because he goes down but one little old fella knowed what it was talking about two of them caleb and joshua he says we can take it that's what it is today they said can we have an interdomination or old-fashioned sanctified holy ghost filled with arrival he says certainly we can can we have divine healing certainly we can can we have divine healing in the presbyterian in the methodist in the lutheran in the baptist churches let me say can we have it in the masses churches can we have he said certainly we can god said so he said them man was looking at the circumstances caleb and joshua was looking at the word that made the difference he said these spies were looking at the conditions what the price they had to pay but caleb and joshua was looking at the promise of god and what god had given him go and possess the land see the the holy ghost is for whosoever is called to the wedding supper and i trust this morning that you've been called he goes i don't care what the price you got to pay he says go get it god says it's yours if you don't get it then he's going to ask you why if you don't get it he's going to ask you why why didn't you get it why it was there for you see if they didn't possess the land there's too many against us he said he said well if god said i'm for you then who can be against you what's the matter there's something wrong with the individual not the church there's nothing wrong with the promised land there's nothing wrong with the evidence there's something wrong with the individual why didn't you get it yes so if god be forced and who can be against it but we find borderline believers they come right up to the border and they see the supernatural they witness and testify the greatness of god and they sit there and they refuse to go in brother brown would tell it like this in the message why in phoenix he said then when he brought when he talked about a borderline believer when he brought right up to the borderline sit right in the meetings and watch the working of the holy spirit see others get healed hear them speak with tongues and see signs and wonders done they'll sit around and watch it but afraid to put their hand on it they'll sit around and watch it but they're afraid to put their hands on it he said that's a whole lot like today that's what the matter with many of the churches they've taken their carnal intellectual route and being cut off from the supplies of god's blessing and healing and power in the baptism of the holy ghost and they have took to the desert route therefore we have argument we have fusses we have stews we have complaints but those who are still remaining in the way it's joy unspeakable full of glory with god with the pillar of fire over them with power with joy with the signs and wonders how the real born-again church is moving on into the promised land the promise of eternal life a land flowing with eternal life he says where there's no sickness no death no sorrow nor nothing to harm that's where we're headed church let's keep our eyes on the promise but he says when the carnal minds begin to come among them and finally drove them off the main path into the desert he said they made their fatal mistake when they failed to go on and many people have failed to move on into the promises of god's word they failed three days journey so close but yet because of unbelief they were so far away in church we're so close we're so close don't let unbelief keep you from enter into that land see when they got there they camped god have been good to them showed them how great and wonderful signs he'd done in egypt on their journey he had prepared everything for them but when they got to kadesh barnea they resolved to settle down right there and refused to move forward they came back with heavens they cut down branches they cut down clusters of grapes but when they came back they brought the great big clusters brother brown said he said they all gathered before the congregation the lord they brought the report and god had told them of the truth that the lamb is flowing with milk and honey it's a good land it's a land of seed it's to grow it'll grow anything it's a wonderful place we've got plenty of water rivers irrigations everything to make the the great nation but but there's amorites there's hittites there's other things there and some of them are giants and we are as grasshoppers see but two of them two of them said we're able two of them said we're able we're able to take the land we're able to possess the land we're more than able we're well able to do it and brother baby said it all depends on what you're looking at this morning churches all depends on what we're looking at if you're looking at your affliction you'll never go any further but if you're looking at the promise you can be healed and delivered see if you look at the promise of god you've got it right to every redemptive blessing that god promised in his word the christian always looks to the unseen every redemptive blessing belongs to the believer but you have to fight for every inch you have to fight for every inch i remember when i first became a christian you had to fight for every inch but you know now as a believer you have to fight to keep every inch that you gain see god's given every sick person in here divine healing every one of you jesus was rooting for our transgressions with your stripes we were healed it's yours but you'll have to fight for every inch you possess everywhere the soles of your feet travel god told joshua i've given it to you footsteps means possession let's move in tonight he said let's go on footprints is possession let's take every inch of ground that god gave us if you haven't got the of the holy ghost peter said the promise is unto you to your children to them that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call the works that i do he said you're going to do also that's a promise that's in the promised land let's possess it let's let's god's promise be made manifest don't look at the circumstances don't look how hard it is let's look at the promised land and let's possess what belongs to us see joshua fought for every inch and he says whether there's giants whether there's atheists prom he says whether it's infidels whether there's cold formal churches what different does it make god give the promise let's take it it's ours it belongs to us it's our possession let's go get it don't be afraid so you got to fight for avery inch church it ain't going to come we're not in a flowery bed of ease when others fought to win the prize who sail through bloody seas we got to fight if we should reign increase our courage lord strengthen us lord god's promises are true nothing can stop them and they're god's promises he give the promise to every believer that's here this morning now you must occupy you must take possession but the man says now he says i can't tell you how divine healing works i can't tell you how a black cow can eat green grass and give white milk but i'll drink it anyhow i can't tell you how divine healing works i don't know the form of it but i've tasted it i've witnessed we've seen it here in our own church i know it's part of the promised land i know it's results i know it's it's for me and i may not be able to produce it in my own life but i'm not going to stand before anybody else that can i'm not going to i may not have the faith to believe but i'll tell you what i'm not going to stand in somebody else's way that does have the faith to believe but see they made their mistake when they begin to murmur and complain and i say let them murmur and criticize our worship let them make fun of us and say what they will we're only rejoicing about the evidence oh if they know what we know they knew how good those grapes tasted they knew how good it was to believe for the promise they knew how good it was to be miraculously healed see we're just rejoicing about the evidence in the land we're not focused on all the obstacles we're not concerned about the giants we're not concerned about how high the walled cities are our focus is on that the land belongs to us and i'm going after it see there's healing in the land there's deliverance there's miracles there's joy there's peace he said but the carnality had cut their spiritual supply off carnality had cut off their joy and they began murmuring and fussing and they took them off in the desert so there is a principle right here you go and you start murmuring you start complaining and you start murmuring it'll cut your spiritual supply right off you won't move past that point so be careful what you murmur about be careful what you complain about be careful how you criticize the ministry furthermore refuse don't criticize the ministry we're human just as much as you're human there's not one of us that's perfect he walked 2 000 years ago and made a way for us who are unperfect to be made perfect through his blood see they left the garlic pots of egypt eating angels food they crossed through the red sea and yet they get to a place where they're three days away and they complain i gotta go to church again i mean really didn't we just hear brother joe wednesday night we just heard them last sunday we got to go through this rigmarole all over again begin to murmur but we've seen the presence of god the evidence begin to flow through our young people begin to flow through the older people we've seen the fruit of the land we're tasting on it nobody can tell us that it's not real nobody can tell us that it's not for us but see we've been around here 40 40 years brother graham said 40 years is up they stayed on that mountain 40 years we stayed in our denomination 40 years fussing this way in that way do you ever think them people done he goes did you ever think what them people done out there for 40 years 40 years they wandered around the mountain looking at the promise that was for you that was for you that was for you 40 years they wandered until the old fighters had to die off those ones that said we can't take it it's not for us oh they want to fight with this group and they want to fight with that group and they want to fight with this group and they want to fight well you can't listen to you know if you don't listen to my tapes you're not going to make it they just keep fighting here and they keep fighting there or you got to push play and we just keep fighting here and we just keep fighting there all the old fighters has got to die off and brother brown said there's a new generation being raised up the entire time he goes oh but the end of the 40 years is up brother he said there's a new generation being raised that's right there was a joshua raised up one day he absolutely believed the word every bit of the promise he says now he says this new this new group they wasn't fighters he goes he let all the old fighters drop when the old fighters died off he took the sons raised them up among joshua and sent them over into the full promise and i believe that's where we're seeing today we're seeing not old fighters anymore we're not seeing sons being grafted down and they're taking the mantle from their pastor or their mantle from their dad and they just continue to want to fight with this group and fight with that group we're talking about a new generation that's looking at the land it's time that we possess the promised land it's time we put our shields and us and our scammers and move to the promises of the word of god quit fighting with one another great fighting with the churches and let's move into the promises of god let's move upward he says let's get off this mountain move up into the promised land let's start going up possess the land god told them go and possess it and all the old fighters is gone now they're dying off one by one one by one put your sword back in this sheath and don't fight he says listen man don't make the same mistake your fathers did or you'll be here for 40 years how many years have we been circling around this mountain after the prophet went off the scene for some 50 60 years waiting to go into the land but we're on our road we're on our road and notice he says now don't go over by mount sir he says don't bother him don't fuss at him just pass him on by he goes how do you do brother walk right on by you've been you've been wanting to get to him and shake him and tell him that he hasn't he ain't got nothing he said that's esau mount syria belongs to esau he said don't go over there because he goes i'll give that to esau that's all that's all the fathers that he's supposed to that's all the further he's supposed to go that's all that he knows about that's the only thing that he knows in his denomination he goes that's all that god gave him just pass him on by don't go to fussing and fighting with him just pass by quietly but look here jacob you pentecostal jacob you're really born again got the experience and led by the holy ghost don't go fussing with him but pentecostal jacob has the full promise down in the land oh church we ain't got to try to straighten everybody else out that's not our promise no we let them if they want to criticize let them criticize that's as far the further they can go but somebody's going into the land somebody's tasted of it somebody's made their way we're going lord we're going to make our move possess the promise possess the promise the promise is unto you we've been here 40 years he says using this as an evidence speaking in tongues he says we've been using that as an evidence for 40 years speaking in tongues and divine healing he goes that's just a few grapes brought back from the promised land the land is ours it all belongs to us he goes don't be afraid that the other fellow is going to beat you down there no he says join up with them and go take over go join up with them let's take over worried about this church having something we ain't got we don't need to worry about that let's just join up with him and go take over because we've been on this mountain for 40 years let's get off of it and let's go toward the promised land see our difference has turned him away our separation of brotherhood he says in the way that we have sent after all these things of the world instead of the things of god you find men today they're kingdom building they got something that's different from than this message oh that they proclaim that they have the message but yet there's something that's different in their ministry different in their church different in their circle of influence but when god sent us a prophet he sent us a prophet and that prophet revealed to us the fullness of the word he didn't break anything out different so why are we separating brotherhood why are we separating fellowship it's time that we move into the promised land of the world and keep what the prophet of god had said stop all the division and bring back to unity so we're not fighting against the men we're fighting against the spirits just trying to come in there he goes what have you done he goes in the wilderness for 40 years walking around over and over the same old grounds we got acts 2 and we got acts 4 and we got acts 2 and we got acts 4 where he goes we're going to run that to death let's go on the promised land is there for whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe that you receive it and you shall have it he says acts 2 and 4 is all right but it ain't all of it oh acts 2 what is that repent and be baptized in jesus name you shall receive the holy ghost he goes that's good but that ain't all of it oh church there's more to the promised land there's more for the believer don't just camp out on the outskirts let's go in let's make our move god don't want you to be the borderline believer god wants you to go in and possess the promise the promise is just beyond the river just beyond there he says now let me start bringing this down to a close i got a few more minutes but we're gonna we're gonna get you out here a little bit early this morning he goes don't take these new things we find ministers today they got this new idea you got them all over the place we got elohim now and we got this one and we got that one we got men all around the world raising their self up to a pinnacle now we're in the laodicean church age which is completely are the bright age which is different than the lay of the cna so now we've got to have a messenger that's going to bring us in and out and all this kind of garbage we got more man-made hoopla than we have but god sent us a message and it's clearly one thing the land belongs to you he goes don't take anything else new he goes they're flying everywhere there'll be more than that come he says don't take these new things the lord your god has declared to you what is truth he's declared to us what is truth the lord your god has vindicated what is truth and by his word and by his spirit he says not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the lord god seeks those that will worship him in spirit and in truth and he has thoroughly vindicated jesus christ to be the same yesterday today and forever he showed the evening seeds to you he's revealed it to you in the word he has proven it to you by his spirit he says now don't never get nothing among you if you see something coming in your heart against somebody get it out of there right then oh you know some some of us you know we're so supernatural and spiritual we like to just keep that thing there just in case we need it to let it loose oh prick the nerve era well i'm just going to put that thumb and push it back a little bit and when it needs to come out there's going to be a line he says don't never get nothing among you if you see something come in your heart against somebody get it out of there right then don't let that thing fester don't let that thing boil over don't let that thing keep you from the blessings of the promised land he says don't let and satan will do his best to get among you so it's not your brother some of you probably had a squabble on the way to church this morning it's not your wife it's not your kids parents hey man to that one huh yeah you got teenagers you know what i'm talking about he says it's not your wife it's not your kid satan will do his best to get among you why because he wants to block the blessing that you're about to receive he doesn't want you to enter into the land he wants you to stay on the outskirts and just fester a little bit let them come say something to me today and i'm just not in the mood for this don't you mess with me today my boss told me one time it was so funny he just got newly married and at this point in time and his they it was about three o'clock in the morning and the baby done something i don't know and and apparently she was not in such a good mood and she looked over and thought you start with me today three o'clock in the morning my good lord they starting early that's how sometimes we feel don't you say nothing to me hey i'll go to church today but they better not say the thing because i just probably gonna get into carnal i'm gonna be fleshy flesh he said don't let that get among you that keeps you from the promise it keeps you from the joys of the lord it keeps fellowship and brotherhood broken god doesn't want us to break our fellowship he wants us to enter into the land he says some slick tongue fellow might come along and try to take you away says you think that they could talk moses out of the presence of god where he stood there and he seen he says no he goes we don't take it we don't add to it we don't take from it we just keep the word the way the lord gave it that's what we're to do church so they can add all they want to ask they can take away all they want to take away they want the blood out take the blood out that's fine he saw you can do what you want you don't want the emotion you ain't got to have the emotion you don't want the presence of god you don't have to have the presence of god you don't have to have none of that but for me in my house we're going to serve god in the fullness of his word we're going to trust god we're going to enter into the promised land i'm not looking at this family or that family what this one's doing or what that was doing i'm looking right here i know what the word declares and it's time for somebody to make their move caleb steal the people before moses and said let us go at once and possess it we are well able to overcome he goes i thank god or thank god he has some caleb and some joshuas that's ready to go over go over and bring back the evidence hallelujah it's a great land bringing back two branches of grapes they was walking there he goes wow what a ground what a place thank god for people who's crossed over out of the old cold formal shackled down ungodly church moss back christian hallelujah got to a place where they stepped over in the canis land eat a lot of good grapes that even make you slobber in the pulpit and they said brother branham didn't get emotional man he probably spit out a bunch of slobber eating the grapes of canaan man if you would have been where he'd been you'd have seen the supernatural you've been lifted up in heavenly places the way he's been lifted up and he come down as they foreshadow to tell us that we can go beyond the curtain of time that it is a good land oh it's a good land church we're no longer old in that land we're no longer hurting in that land but that joy is unspeakable and full of glory in that land he's going beyond the curtain of town and he's telling you it's a good land it's a land flowing it's got milk it's got honey it's got young eggs and we're going to that land and ain't no devil can keep us no unbelief will keep you from that land it'll make you slobber at the pulpit it'll make you spit i don't care yes that's right i'm going to that land i tasted of the milk and honey i tasted the stimulation of the wine of victory [Applause] oh how many you can testify have you crossed over oh yeah we tasted of the milk and honey we're feasting on the land fresh manna oh hallelujah he said god sent the lamb before him go possess it bring back the evidence he goes really he goes you right you really get down i mean it before god god i take you over across there no matter what the seminary preachers say we can have the holy ghost let me just say we can have a dance a genuine dance we can have a run a victory we can have an emotion as long as it's genuine let me just tell you if we have something that's not junior-wide i'd rather have a little bit of wildfire than no fire because you can't get warm by a painted fire but if you've got a little bit of wildfire it'll get you heated up and that wildfire begins to move and begin to move to this one and begin to jump over on this one and then finally you'll find that the whole church is set on fire why because they're tasting of the land they taste another goodness they taste another milk and honey they taste it in the blessing of god vacation of it hold on fire don't scare you i want more for her i want more word i want more revelation i want more pills i want more honey of the word of god let me get into that land he says don't let the devil squat he goes just let the devil squall and scream have all his chances that he wants to thus saith the lord this is right don't stop church don't wonder if it's for you quit wondering about it is it for me is it for my family can i make the rapture can i be saved am i even a christian do i have the holy ghost you can put every one of those questions to rest right now by going forward but as long as you're wandering and wondering and not moving forward you'll stay there you'll be camped out the holy ghost ain't for me well i'll tell you what it is if you go forward healing ain't for me it is if you go forth it's yours it's already been promised to you just take it we're in our our decision we've seen the fruits of the land if we declared this across here wednesday night sister mariah sister atlanta sister sharon sister marilyn brother gary sister karen pruitt brother drew dexter sister jessica conroy we got brother and we got

outskirts and say today i'm moving forward today i'm going into the land don't cap don't camp out on the land that doesn't have fruit let me bring this to a closed musicians can make their way back robron says we can take it it's ours we're able we need tinnitus to do it he says what we need tonight is to do it it's yours the promise is unto you it's unto your children to them that are in chicago as many as the lord our god shall call freedom of choice to me he's the same to me he will keep his promise to me he was wounded for my transgressions he was bruised for my nickel did the chastisement of my peace was upon him and with his stripes i am healed see because i believe hallelujah do you believe it's your choice we're at the borderland i can hear joshua i can hear our joshua say the move is on for the bride that's thus saith the lord the move is on for the bride now notice every one of you that came up here the other night wednesday night as a evidence of the land there's five out there saying you can't have it five to one ten against two the odds are against you the odds are against us just play something yes last year there was a two-year-old colt finished dead last in his first race and i'm bringing this to a close and i'm gonna end it right here disappointed his owners placed him on a claiming race where anyone can take ownership of the horse four feet thirty thousand dollars was the price paid for this horse thirty thousand that looks like a big number but it's immaterial an older man claims a cold after missing his chance to claim another horse that he wanted he says his last this is his last attempt to find some success in the racing industry in the next race the colt wins by 17 links and his new owner is encouraged but in a few races that follow he finishes third twice fourth once and fifth once but his owner still believes oh i think we got an owner that's looking down upon us he still believes in this little cult this year in 2022 is the colts only chance to race in a major thoroughbred race which is limited to three-year-old horses the day before the kentucky derby the field of horses is already full but then at the last moment a famous trainer scratches and he withdraws his horse the colt takes his place in the field of 20 horses just 30 seconds before the entry deadline 30 seconds that's all you need today church just 30 seconds 30 seconds before the entry deadline now he's in the game now he has a chance but all the metrics and all the predictors are against him neither his own or his trainer nor his jockey has ever been associated with any horse in the kentucky derby this was a brand new area his jockey had never won a major event and the they they were outsiders and newbies in the elite arena and on the morning of the race the odds of winning are set at 80 to 1. this horse shouldn't even been in this race this jockey shouldn't even been on this horse he had never won a major event this horse has never won a major race and now they find herself in the kentucky derby and all the odds are against you all the odds are against them and halfway around the track the colt is 16 horses back from the lead just as we suppose why are you even here look at you you're 16 you're way at the back of the pack you're just four horses from the back he can't even be seen in the field of view by the drone that's flying over and look he's a nobody he's a throw away he's an on insequential participant he's just there to make sure they have a a quorum to have a race just to make sure they got 20 horses but then he makes his move oh there it is church but then he may be 16 back nobody may give him any recognition but then he makes his move he begins to work his way through the crowd he begins to find little paths here and a few opportunities there and he has as they head toward the finish line he's moved up the fifth then he's moved up to the fourth and still no one notices him no one sees him no one mentions him everybody's attention's on the first two the two well-known horses but only seconds before the finish before the finish he suddenly and magically passes the two front horses and the announcer struggles to identify and to say his name he almost almost in a single breath rich strike is coming up on the inside oh my goodness the longest shot has won the can derpy derby i'm gonna tell you tonight church all the odds may be against you they may say you can't take the land anybody say you shouldn't be feared but i'm gonna tell you make your move make your move right here this is
