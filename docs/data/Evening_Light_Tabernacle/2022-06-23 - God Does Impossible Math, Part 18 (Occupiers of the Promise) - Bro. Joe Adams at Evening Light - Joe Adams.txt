holding services there for him this weekend so we do appreciate your prayers and appreciate what god has been doing on our behalf and on behalf of even like tabernacle it's the right time it's the right time we rejoice in god's time and in his leadership it's the right time so with that i want to speak to you tonight on god does impossible math part 18. you're probably getting tired of hearing that but that's okay i still believe it with all my heart even so much that my family bought me a pair of of god does have a possible math socks for father's day i don't have them on tonight but i had them on sunday some of y'all probably saw and we believe it i'm walking in it i believe the promise of god is to each and every one of us and tonight i want to speak to you on occupiers of the promise occupiers of the promise look don't make it just for somebody else don't make it for the preachers don't make it for the deacons don't make it for those people that we hold in high regard make it for your own self you are an occupier of the promise of god we are occupiers tonight and we look here in exodus 23 and verse 20 it says behold i send an angel or a messenger before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which i have prepared beware of him and obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name or that word their name means reputation his fame and his glory is in him but if thou shall indeed obey his voice and do all that i speak then i will be an enemy unto thy enemies and an adversary unto thy adversaries for my angels shall go before thee to bring thee unto the amorites the hittites the perizzites the canaanites the hivites the jebusites and i will cut them off god did not hide who the enemies were he told them i'm to bring you into the land this is who you're going to face but he's already promised you i've given you the land oh church god's not going to allow you to be blindsided he's telling you right here he says i will cut them off thou shall not bow down to their gods nor serve them nor do after their works but thou shalt utterly overthrow them and quite break down their images god said what he is going to do and god's telling you what he expects you to do oh this is a two-part relationship he says and you shall serve the lord your god and he shall he shall bless thy bread and thy water and i will take sickness away from the midst of thee and i it's noticed now and there shall nothing cast her young nor be barren otherwise he's saying there's not going to be any abortions in that land there's not going to be any miscarriages in that land there's not going to be any sterility in that land or any barrenness in that land but you're going to be fruitful in that land and he says now the number of thy days i will fulfill and i will send my fear upon thee and i will destroy all the people whom thou shalt come and i will make all thy enemies turn their backs unto thee and i will send hornets before thee we shall drive out the hive the canaanite the hittite from before thee and i will drive them out from before thee in one year he goes excuse me i will not drive them out before thee in one year lest the land become desolate and the beasts of the field multiply against thee by little and little will i drive them out from before thee until thou be increased sometimes we want god to do it overnight but god says i'll do it little by little so that the land does not be increased and notice what he says now and thou shall make no covenant with them nor with their gods verse 32 and they shall dwell they shall not dwell in thy land lest they make thee a sin against thee for if thou serve their gods it will surely be a snare unto thee god bless you you can have your seats tonight so i want to speak to you as i said occupiers of the promise there are over 8 800 promises in the bible if you turn me down just a tad bit brother david 8 800 promises in the bible the word promise appears more than 100 times in the scriptures there was a gentleman by the name of everett r storms he was a school teacher in canada who made a detailed study of promises and the promises in the bible and he read on his 27th reading of the bible a task that which took him a year and a half he totaled up 8810 promises of those 8810 promises 7487 of them promises were made by god to humankind so i don't know where you are tonight but i believe there's a promise there for you i believe that we as children of god can reach up and grab hold of one of the 7487 promises that god has afforded to us as believers tonight he said well brother joe i can't understand that but look what the bible says in first kings 8 and 56 blessed be the lord that hath given rest unto his people israel according to all that he promised there has not failed one word of all his good promise which he promised by the hand of moses his servants there's not one promise of god that he can fail to deliver on if you can believe god and take god in his word tonight now this portion of scripture that we read here in exodus as i read those 13 scriptures or those 13 yeah scriptures i counted 12 to 13 promises that god promised you as a believer so i want to say this tonight that out of all these promises god is calling for occupiers to occupy the promise so no matter what you're facing no matter what you're needing today you can rest assured that laying in the word of god is a promises that will fit your need that would heal your body that will deliver the situation god can meet your financial situation god can meet your children's situations god has got a promise laying in the word tonight and he's looking for somebody that will believe and occupy the word of god so i firmly believe tonight no matter what we're facing we're occupiers of not just one but every promise i believe they're entitled they're for us and so much that god will promise us he says i'm going to send an angel before you notice i'm going to send a messenger that he's going to go to before you he will keep you in the way and not only will he keep you in the way but he will lead you into the land that i prepared for you and god as he sent that promise to them and that day god has sent a messenger in this day for one purpose is to keep us in the way and when you get out of step it's resonating around the message get back in line get back in step stay in tune with the word stay in tune with the message of the hour so he sent us a message to keep us in line to bring us to the place that he had prepared for us john 14 and verse 1 he says let your heart not be troubled you believe in god believe also in me in my father's house or many matches if it were not so i would have told you but i go to prepare a place for you oh we may mourn on this side of the passing of our brother jerome but god had already gone before to prepare a place he's already in a new a new place a new body no more sickness no more sorrow no more to old age no more weariness no more difficulties no more disappointments he's in a well body god had already gone before to prepare promise and look brother jerome cashed in on the dividends of that promise he believed to the end he says now if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again what a promise what a promise if i go to prepare a place i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am there you may be also and whether i go you know in the way you know the word prepare here means to get everything ready god has already prepared and has every ready he's going to prepare a place for us for where he is his desires is to have his bride right there with him by his side god wants you next to him i know sometimes you pray and god doesn't move sometimes you pray and god remains quiet but god is preparing a place he's already gone before you he's given you that promise that where i am you can be also as a children of israel notice as they were in their exodus so are we as the elected god are in our own exodus we're pilgrims and strangers i hope you don't plan on sitting setting up camp on this side and make the best of this life because this life is full of disappointments see they were in a conquest they were promised to land there was the land of canaan god promised them i'm gonna bring you to all these different individuals all these different tribes all these different ones in that land but i want you to know i've given you the land that land belongs to you it don't belong to the occupants that are already there in that land but i've given it to you and just as god promised him a natural land god has promised us a supernatural land god has given us a promise on this side look don't cash in on this side god has given you a word hang on to the bitter end one day these bodies are going to be transformed notice they had a natural land but for us it's not a natural land it's a land that will never grow old never get weary never get sick never have a disappointment never need a doctor's visit never need medicine what a land church what a land that god has promised us and there's been others who have gone before us and they're occupying it right now and if i believe they can look over that grand stand that banister they would be hollering they would be cheering you on press the battle press to battle don't give up you're you're closing in the finish line is drawing near press the battle occupy the promise occupy the promise notice he's promised us the land beyond this jordan beyond death the land that flows with milk and honey and land that is just beyond the curtain of time and if i could say it the way the prophet would say it i may have it just exactly wrong but that's okay but it's just a few feet above us right now just going a little bit faster than what we're going and one day when that slows down and we speed up we're going to be in a new body church one day that's not a that's not a fairy tale that's a promise and we're going to cash in on the promise and occupy a new body occupy an eternal reign notice what brother branham would tell us in the message things that are to be talking about going beyond the curtain of time he said it's perfect he goes oh it wouldn't even touch us sublime there's no english vocabulary that i know no word at all that could ever express what it is it's beyond anything that i know there he was there was no sickness no sorrow you couldn't die you couldn't sin it was just perfect just perfect friends you mustn't you mustn't miss it what a promise what a promise to a people notice god gave abraham a covenant 4 000 years ago i'm going to take you to a land moses led israel out of egypt and joshua led in the conquest of the land 3 400 years ago david established jerusalem as israel's capital 3000 years ago after the exile of babylon or to babylon and then return again jesus came to die on the cross after jesus extended ascended back to heaven israel was again dispersed by the romans two thousand years ago but after the millennia of the dispersion of their sins at the proclamation of the british and the u.n israel again became a nation in 1948 unlike during the roman occupation where caesar's and herod's rule today israel as in is in its own government and military or it has its own government its own military it's a bona fide independent nation has its own borders so today we can say that israel is back in our homeland natural israel is now occupying the promise that god gave to abraham 4 000 years ago and as a prophet god will say this he said israel back in her promised land she don't know how she got back there she was just automatically put there why national force put her in there national force put israel in her homeland national force put we'll put the church in the world council of churches but the power of god will put the people in the bride oh church i'm not looking at national forces we got a promise we got a word that's going to put this people this body right here tonight in the body called the bride of christ he said world forces the world forces this way and the world forces that way but god forces upward the spirit of god which is the word of god my word is spirit and life we'll put the bride in her place because she'll recognize her position in the word then she's in christ will put her in her place no national force would do it but the national forest did drive israel to our homeland the natural or national forces of the council of churches will drive every organization into it but the power of god will raise the bride into glory and out of it i say oh glory to god what a promise tonight and god looking at people tonight that are occupiers of that promise why are you here you've been through heartache you've been through disappointments but you're here tonight because why you believe the promise you believe the word of god you're hold known for that body change for that realization that one day one day soon one day soon it's all gonna change israel back in our homeland with their own government own money own flag their own borders look church we've been dispersed down through church age after church age we've had our trials we've had our tribulations we've had our battles we've had disappointments but we will occupy the promised land that god has gone to prepare for this bride he has sent us a word he has sent us a message and it's this message is going to raise us into the body of christ it's going to raise us raise us up out of these old pest house and lift us up into a heavenly atmosphere this word occupy it means to take hold of to take possession of it means to reside in as an owner not a tenant not somebody who's written a place but you own the place oh i'm talking about sons and daughters of god tonight i'm preaching them with men and women tonight who are owners of the promise i'm talking about those like that have taken hold of a body change they're taking hold of a rapture i'm talking about those that are owners of a new body that one will never grow old woman ever gets sick one that'll never need a doctor i'm preaching to young people tonight who will take hold of that promised land and it ain't just mama it ain't just daddy it ain't just one camp meet to a next family but you have met god you have met the pillar of fire and he's real in your life and that's why you're here that's why you're serving god because you want to occupy that same promise that's been given to generation after generation notice now joshua 5 and verse 1 and it came to pass when all the kings of the amorites which were on the side of jordan westward and the kings excuse me and the kings of the canaanites which were by the sea they heard that the lord had dried up the waters of jordan from before the children of israel until we were passed over that their heart melted neither was their spirit in them anymore because of the children of israel church hell is afraid of you oh come on somebody church hell is afraid of you let me just say they heard how cancer's been defeated they heard how cancer been defeated they heard how alopecia was defeated they heard how brain bleeds were defeated oh they heard how little boy drew but couldn't walk got up and began to walk and i preached his testimony in newfoundland canada three or four weeks ago and a young boy who they said was going to be put in braces i gave that testimony and the spirit of god came behind it and that little boy today he don't need braces he's totally well what am i talking to you about hell is afraid of the occupiers of the word hell is afraid of you tonight you've got jurisdiction over the word over the enemy tonight [Applause] hell isn't where there's a people in the land that's focused on one thing occupying the promise they refuse to live in a defeated state they refuse to live in a contented state they are determined to move in and take possession you know it's like how brother branham would talk if you got a new home you just wouldn't sit on the outside of it and just admire it would you you go in and you explore and you look at the kitchen and you look at the bedroom and you look at the bathroom and you look at every room and say that's all mine it's all mine it's all my you occupy you don't stay outside oh i got me a new house and you're camped out in the yard no you go in you occupy you set up households and that's what god is calling us to do notice now chapter 5 and verse 2. so this new generation this new generation came in but before they can possess the promised land that brother tim had been speaking on they had to be circumcised he said at the time the lord said unto joshua make these sharp knives and circumcise again the children of israel the second time and joshua made sharp knives and circumcised the children of israel at the heel of the foreskins and this is the cause while joshua did circumcise all the people that came out of egypt that were males even all the men of war died in the wilderness by the way after they came out of egypt now all the people that came out were circumcised but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of egypt then they had not circumcised verse seven and their children whom he raised up in their stead them joshua circumcised for they were uncircumcised because they had not circumcised him by the way see that generation had to have their own experience that generation couldn't get in on the generation before it was because they were circumcised because they had an experience because maybe the prophet spoke to them and called them out in a prayer line they had to have their own experience they had to be circumcised for themselves and we find here circumcision was the key to occupying the land circumcision was the key to occupying the land they were told they had to be circumcised in order for the new generation to move into the promised land they had to be circumcised and for them to take possession of what god told moses many years ago and how god reiterated showing that he's the same yesterday today and forever the same promise that he gave to moses to occupy the lamb was the same promise that he gave to joshua to occupy the land look he's showing that god is the same he doesn't change but as long as you can go forth and occupy the word he said the men who were born in the wilderness they had to be circumcised they had to receive the holy ghost they had to meet the god of moses they had to meet the god of joshua they had to meet god for themselves that's why a young person you need to meet god not just did by obama's religion or daddy's religion or tim pruitt's religion or joe adams religion or aaron hogan's be religious but you got to get by on knowing the god of abraham the god of jacob the god of isaac you've got to know the god of william branham that he's the same yesterday today and forever you've got to be an occupier of the same word the same fruit the same supernatural strength and power that he possessed you dare to possess as well so if we're going to possess the promise of god then we got to meet god we got to meet god we plan on occupying our promised land we just can't occupy based on somebody else but we got to have our own experience brother braham says this and he swore by himself god give him a sign speaking about abraham he circus circumcised him as a sign of seal and abraham's seed still receives circumcision see they did it all through the age until the moon faded out the law and the sun came in he said every son of abraham is circumcised today not of the flesh but of the heart the holy spirit circumcises the heart cuts away the things of the world and makes you a new creature in christ makes you a new creature circumcision is to cut off the surplus flesh so abraham received circumcision as a confirmation that new generation receive circumcision as a confirmation of their faith to be able to occupy the land and if they did so do we we got to have the holy ghost why do we do youth camps why don't we do it it ain't so you can pick up a mate though it's the best place for it if that's what you're into but so you can you can beat god so you can walk in his presence you can step forward and come through a prayer line and knowing the angel the lord is right there not only is that he's there to feel you he's there to heal you he's there to deliver you that's why we do these things you think it's just so brother tim can get a big name it's not so he can get a big name and have big name preachers it's so that you can have an experience with god and that's not for just the youngest for some of you old hands as well because you need to touch of god just as much as these young people need a touch of god and what greater atmosphere than a young person create an atmosphere for themselves and for you so you can walk through that same prayer line and the same holy ghost to touch them the same power of god that delivered him is the same one that'll touch you the same one that'll meet your need so notice once oh i love this notice what he says here let me just go back and read this and no children whom they raised from the stead from joshua circumcised for they were circumcised because they had not been circumcised and by the way and it came to pass when they had done circumcising all the people their abode in the places in the camp they were both there in their places in the camp until they were whole and the lord said unto joshua this day have i rolled away the reproach of egypt of all philippi wherefore the name of the place is called gilgal until this day that word gilgal means rolling so we find here that the children of israel for many years they lived in egypt they thrived in egypt they once were successful in egypt but there came on the throne of pharaoh who didn't know joseph and things began to change they began to suffer they began to be involved they began to be beat harassed threatened mistreated they became slaves in egypt and to egypt but i want you to know this day he wrote the reproach of egypt off their life why because they came according to the promise of god if you'll circumcise you'll enter into that promised land and the reproach of egypt the history of egypt the stars of egypt will be removed off your life and god will never remember your past in egypt god has provided something better for your church oh let me just tell you you may have been identified with smoking you may have been identified with drinking you may have been identified with sex sins or church answering but i'm gonna tell you today god has sent you a word and he's wrong to replace the reproach of the world lost your life now you're free you're free to occupy the land you're free to possess your promise their life was scarred and maybe your life had been scarred choices you made people you heard opportunities you missed but this day this day the lord has rolled a reproach have sent nature off your life you no longer identify with this world you're no longer identified with sin with drinking smoking sex sins you're no longer identified with your past now you are identified as a son and a daughter of god that's who you are now beloved what manner of love hath the father bestowed upon us that now we should be called sons of god oh what a greater death what a greater honor than to be called a child of god notice he tells us through moses deuteronomy 30 and verse 8. and thou shall return and thou shall return and obey the voice of the lord and do all his commandments which i commanded thee this day and the lord thy god will make thee plenteous in every work of thy hand in the fruit of thy body in the fruit of thy cattle and the fruit of thy land for good for the lord will again rejoice over thee for good and as he rejoiced over thy fathers and he's telling the new generation what he's going to do and what they're they are to do verse 11 for this commandment which i command through this day is not hidden from thee neither is it far off it is not in heaven that thou should say who shall go up to heaven and bring it to us that we may hear it and do it neither is it beyond the sea that thou should say who shall go over the sea for us and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it but the word is very not unto thee in thy mouth and in thy heart that thou mayest do it well church this is not hard god has prom god had promised him that if they wholly follow the lord he would bless them beyond measure he will bless the fruit of their hand he will breast the fruit of their land he will bless their cattle there'd be no barrenness in that land and all that israel had to do was obey the voice of god but we find israel began to forsake god and forsake his word and forsake his counsel and give up on his promise see it was due to their disobedience that they became they began to live below their god give them privileges and each of you tonight god has given you a god-given privilege to serve him god has given you a privilege it's an honor to sit on this pew tonight church you don't understand these brothers and myself we receive messages around the world wishing they could sit where you're sitting how else would a sister with her two children in a moment's time get on a plane and travel 30 plus hours to sit in a seat that you occupy because she wants to be an occupier of the promise don't take this opportunity for granted see the same god that was with moses was the same god that was with joshua the same god that was with the prophet is the same god with us tonight and as he told the prophet i'm going to show you beyond the curtain of time that was giving us a glimpse of where we're headed church there's a land beyond the river there's a land and it's not a fairy tale it's not a pipe dream it's not air castles it's a land and there's been different ones out of this congregation who are right now on that other side jerry shull jerome bus different ones memo buzz karen pruitt different ones are already on the streets of gold just fellowshipping waiting on us to occupy our portion of that promise but notice now they begin to live below their god-given privileges let's look in judges 2 and verse 8. judges 2 and verse 8. and joshua the son of nun the servant of the lord he died being 110 years old and they buried him in the border of the inherit inheritance of that wonderful word there that i can't pronounce in the mount of ephraim on the north side of the hill of gash and also all the generation were gathered unto their fathers and they arose another generation after them which knew not the lord nor yet the works which he had done for israel and there's men today that they don't want you to give a testimony what god has done they look they're afraid they shy away from testifying of the power and the supernatural of god well if we don't tell how would the next generation know if we don't tell how will the next generation have faith to believe in the god that we believed in see the children of israel did evil in the sight of the lord and they served balaam and they forsook the lord god of their fathers and brought them out of the land of egypt and they followed other gods the gods of the people that were round about them and they bow themselves unto them and provoke the lord to anger verse 13 and they forsook the lord and served baal and ashtaroth and the anger of the lord was hot against israel and he delivered them into the hands of the spoilers that spoiled them and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies so they were living below what god had promised them god had given them a land god had given them a promise that they would be fruitful that he will bless their land he would bless their cattle he would bless they would not be barren in that land there would not be miscarriages in that land or abortions in that land but you would be fruitful and multiply in that land in that promise and after joshua and the men who served with joshua that outlived him when they all died and went off the scene then the children of israel began to flirt with the gods of the nations that they were sent to be to take captive of or to destroy they forsook the lord and they went whoring after the gods of the nations that they were to conquer and the prophet of god will tell us he said the church has been in the minority it's always been it will always be in memories until jesus comes he says but it's living on under its god give him privileges if we only knew this is the church of the living god not branham tabernacle for the branham tabernacle just part of it there's other such tabernacles through the country now we find here and there's many such churches throughout the country but we're all living seem like on a defeated side more or less i heard brother neville announced this morning back there that it kind of come to my mind that the people are seemingly are getting away from deliverances it seems that to be something that the people seem to just push off out to one side oh well god can do it but it's just he goes but that's just not the attitude so we find here and we think well brother joe we're in the messes and you know we're not living it even like tabernacle we're not living underneath our god-given privileges but you go travel to church to church and other churches and you come and acquaint us with other ministries and some of those ministries don't believe the same way some of those churches don't have the same freedom by which you're able to worship the lord tonight and you find people are living below their god-given privileges and like the prophet that god will say here seems like people are giving away from deliverance's message oh they got the great deep intellectual knowledge of the word but where is the people where is the deliverance where's the young people in the church where's the fire in the church where's the supernatural in the church i believe in preaching on the deep things of god we need that to lift us up into a heavenly atmosphere but we also need a god that delivers a god that sets free a god that's still healed a god that still moves we still need to preach of god that delivers he's delivering esa and he's here to deliver you tonight he's the same god church oh i want the deep things of god but i want the simplicity of the word i want the simplicity of a god that destroys cancer and heals sugar diabetes and removes heart trouble and cures us sick when the doctors can't find it i got a god that knows the answer he does impossible math notice brother branham will say this said brother joe you're just preaching you're just getting onto it because not everybody believes the way we believe that's how let's see how prophet would say it 1957 here you him some of we ministers we should be ashamed of ourselves as we keep our congregation way below their privileges somehow we ministers we should be ashamed of ourselves because we keep our congregation way below their privileges the whole christian church today is living thousands of miles below their god-given privileges because of just so half asleep dismal life take the promise bullet they're gonna take the promise and believe it god said god said so that settles it forever he says no matter how long it takes to materialize he said time doesn't mean nothing to god see it's his word that we take and we believe abraham waited 25 years for that child to come but it arrived and you may have may have waited a long time for your promise to come but i want you to know your promises in the room your miracle's in the room tonight you ain't got to wait another long a minute longer oh brother andrew you had a promise it took seven years something like that to manifest but when when a man of god came by and said it's on this road it's on its way oh he didn't just shove it off he occupied the promise god came by god was so mindful to stop by him see there's still a spirit of discernment that still moves in the church today there's still a spirit of prophecy maybe not the major prophet but they're still gifts of prophecy that moves in the church to be able to tell you what your needs are god still moves sure don't put him in a box it's part of the promise and i'm glad that we can be associated with men of god that can yield their gift to that level because it's not for that man but it's for the body god knew you got a need and god sent a man your way and he spoke that need and what we saw little drew he saw him in a vision what did god do that vision came to pass didn't it he's still god but you got to be the one that occupies that promise see god started his church the way he wanted it god started his church not man god started his church the way he wanted it and now today he wants his church the way he started it well brother joe you mean we got to get in an upper room if you plan on being like the first church so how did he start an in and out room all in one accord and all of a sudden tongues of fire began to descend and they were all sat real quiet and they began to nod and there wasn't a voice heard everybody was just as quiet because they were scared the preacher may say something and call them out because they got a little emotional a little fanatical no that ain't how my bible reads the bible says when those tongues of fire begin to fall they all in one accord begin to what they begin to speak in an unknown language they begin to get beyond the realm of their humanity they begin to get outside the borders of their flesh and they begin to worship god and the presence of god came down and they staggered out oh my god they staggered out like drunk men let me tell you if you don't just act like you're drunk you come to the house of god get dropped on the holy ghost get drunk on the water stimulation get drunk from the presence of god it's okay it tastes good my brother i don't want to act like that well you gotta act like you have to get back to the original church god won't see his church on fire don't paint him a fire create him a fire do you know that god created a fire in babylon he heated that thing up seven times hotter than it ever been hit before because he desired fellowship he had three young boys down there who were missing mama and daddy but god's like i got this i want to have fellowship with it god created a fire it wasn't a picture it wasn't a pitcher no but when they stepped off that ledge and they was in that fire the man of god god himself said this is no job for an angel wormwood and this one and that one i'm gonna go myself and he grabbed a lightning bolt zigzags and a cloud and came down into that and that same god if he left glory for them he'll leave glory for you tonight to do what so that you can occupy the word of god to show you that he is a living god he is a god that's mindful of your knees he's the same yesterday today and he'll be the same god the same healer the same deliverer a same way baker the same miracle worker that he was being he is tonight why did the doctor say that the cancer they can't find it because he's a living god [Applause] they can't find it it's gone i don't know if y'all just heard what i just said since the roof went to the doctor and they did a pet scan i did a scan and they can't find cancer they said it's gone the night is gone why because god gave a promise not even cancer but stand before the believer's prayer let me just he's the same god tonight he's a healer tonight he defeated cancer one time he'll do it again and again and again and again and again enemy he's the same god i say glory to god let it be lord the holy ghost comes and you feel a dance coming over don't shy away from it no you dance under him yes well i'm worried about what they gonna think about me well i got you a scripture hope david oh brother joe you're gonna act stupid yep what was david so excited about because the promised word was now coming back oh church you know why some of these churches can't preach the excitement to joy the lord because the promised word ain't coming there oh but why is it coming even like tabernacle because there's a people to occupy the promise and there's a promised word coming and david oh he saw he saw those men of god the levites with the the the the uh the altar on their shoulders and here they were bringing that the the word back into the camp oh david begins to dance and he got a little bit beside himself and his wife got a little upset david you embarrassed me i can't believe that it was a wednesday night service you know the whole world's watching and you got up and ran around the church how dare you david david said you know what you didn't like that watch this there need to be some david's in the house of god tonight some of you ain't moved in years but you need to be a david and i said you don't like that watch this you want to criticize my worship why oh i tell you i know where i was i know where i am i know that i was invited but i know you're not free you don't like it i'm here to worship god i'm not here to worship you i'm gonna praise god to worship my living god hey healer and delivered come wave maker that's who i am that's what i'm here to praise i feel like upon the word i'm gonna take projections of the promise and i may look stupid i may lose food it don't matter but i don't care what you don't like satan i said i don't care what you don't like because we're going to praise god with all of our minds [Applause] why because we are people on the books we've got a promise give it to us for sons and daughters of god he may speak in tongues you make self but whatever you do don't live below your god-given privilege whatever you do don't settle don't settle don't settle for being on the outside [Applause] oh i don't believe that brother aaron and i've been preaching kind of on the same lines for for for happened since god is telling us i've given it to you what now make your move make your move occupy the land take possession of it take possession of oh let me just you can be seated i won't hold you much longer notice now they begin to live below their god-given privileges we find here in judges wanting or let me just go back judges 119. no judges 1-1 excuse me judges 1-1 now after the death of josh but it came to pass that the children of israel asked the lord saying who shall go up for us against the canaanites first to fight against them and the lord said unto judah said judah shall go up behold i have delivered the land into thy hand notice the words of god i have delivered the land into thy hand key that write that in your notes stick it on your refrigerator i have delivered the land into your hand he has given you a promise a total victory i've given it to you i have given the land into your hand and judah said unto simi and his brother come up with me unto my lot that we may fight against the canaanites and i likewise will go with thee into thy lot so see me and with him verse 17 and judah would with sema and his brother and they flew the canaanites that inhabited zephath and utterly destroyed it and the name of the cd was called horma verse 19. and the lord was with judah and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain but he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley because they had chairs of iron verse 21 and the children of benjamin did not drive out the jebusites that inhabited jerusalem but the jebusites dwell with the children of benjamin in jerusalem until this day verse 27. neither did malassa drive out the inhabitants of machine in her towns nortenac and her towns know the inhabitants adore and her towns northern habits of ebelin and her towns northern inhabits and medigo and her towns verse 29 neither did ephem drive out the canaanites to dwell in geezer verse 30. neither does zebulon drive out the inhabitants of ketron nor then heavens and nahol neither did verse 31 neither did asher drive out they didn't have us an acor nor then have a society or a lab or the accident nor of hellbar or effect or rahorb in verse 33 neither did naphtali drive out in heaven it's the best shemesh nor the inhabitants of batana it says but he dwelt among the canaanites or but he dwelts among the canaanites and the inhabitants of the lamb nevertheless the inhabitants of besh and bethana became tributaries unto them and the amorites forced the children of dan into the mountain for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley god never promised god never gave a promise of a halfway deliverance god never gave a promise of a halfway he says i've given you the land i've given the land into your hand and we find they begin to live below their god-given privileges god not only said what he was going to do through moses he reiterated what he was going through through joshua he declared that he would give them the land and he would only he would not only deliver them through the lamb but he was going to give them a land which they did not labor cities which they did not build and they would dwell in them and their vineyards and olives and they would give them all these things that they didn't plan all that they had to do was go and drive out the inhabitants of the land god had promised him the land he had promised him victory in the land but they had to have faith to drive out the occupants of the land let me just tell you church we're here tonight we got to fight for every promise we got to fight that whatever belongs to us every inch of ground i must fight if i should reign increase my courage lord if i face cancer god give me the strength to fight if i face alopecia god give me the strength to fight if i face brain please god give me the strength to fight no matter what clementine follows me tonight god give me the strength to fight we gotta fight for divine healing we got to fight for deliverance for joy for peace for the supernatural for the word of god to be preached not only in mechanics but in the dynamics of the word we got to fight for prayer lines we've got to fight for altar calls we gotta fight to keep youth camps alive we gotta fight so our young people can have a chance at their revival to have their opportunity at the word we gotta fight for the word so that it can be preached in mechanics in dynamics oh church i must fight if i must reign increase my courage lord what you find see how much time i got i'm gonna give me just can i go a few more minutes they find god told them there was already somebody living in the land there were squatters in the land but notice god before the foundation of the world knew who he was going to give that land to god possessed the title deed god had the land god knew he was going to bring his people into that land he knew that they were going to be a spirit-filled people walking in victory and we believe tonight that god has promised us a same kind of promise there's a land just beyond the jordan there's a land just beyond this life what a land it is but we find there were squatters in the land what is a squad or brother joe one that settles on property without the right or the title or payment or rent someone let me just put it in old louisiana language that don't belong come on look at me like you're enjoying this some of y'all just like wish you could hurry up and get over so let's just think about let's just say tonight you own a vast estate more land than you can ever look at it you know you pay taxes on it and you go out and you get on your horse and you ride around your property and you ride and you ride and it takes you days right and you finally get to the far edge of the land and you find some evidence of somebody squatting on your land and you think well you know what it's okay i got plenty of property it doesn't matter and you just pass it on by but then your property passes on down to your son and that son he rode with you out on the land and he seen how you treated those that were squatting on the land how you say well i guess dad's struck an agreement with him it doesn't matter we're just gonna pass this on by and you find things just passed down and passed down but now the land changed ownership now it's to the grandson and the grandson's got he's got great big ideas he got great big plans for the land and now he inherited and he rides out there and he sings his little cabin now it's no longer just one cabin it's three or four cabins and that ain't just cabins now they got garbage and they got fences and they got stores and they got all this stuff being built up on the outskirts and they're squatters and he goes down there there's a new owner in town you got to get off and they look at him like you're stupid i ain't leaving i've been here for years we've been here for generation after generation after generation we don't have to leave well that grandson says y'all tell you what old boy i'm going to go to the authorities he goes down to the authority he gives him an eviction notice and he comes back like like martin luther and he nails it to the door you know what the squadrons do i ain't worried about your doctor's report i ain't worried about this they can tell you heal it all you want no i got access i got cancer i got you i got you where i want you they rip that victim report down and throw it in the garbage keep on building keep on eating keep on multiplying keep on doing their thing they're squatting on a land that don't belong to them but finally he goes down to the courthouse and he has a deed drawed up and he places his borders and he knows exactly where he goes and he brings the authorities this time with him oh i think he come packing the holy ghost this time he brought him into the service he said i'll tell you what oh boy you may have been here through generation and generation but today is your last day you can't say another minute i got the authority here i got the abstract title d on here today you've got to leave you can't save father you've got to go in the name of jesus i assure you tonight through the word of god oh heaven is behind this word you've got to go you can't say another minute they packed up and they just crossed on the other side and they just watching well old son's gonna go back he's gonna go back to his house several hundred miles away and we'll be able to get no this son was determined he tore down the home he tore down the fences he tore down the garden tilled it up said you know what i'm gonna do i'm gonna build something better he began to erect something that honors him oh i hope you're hearing what i'm telling you tonight and maybe you've had generational curse passed down passed down passed down you didn't think nothing about it this is just who i am this is how i made no there's somebody that's gonna say i'm here to break the cycle tonight i refuse to let that generational curse that squad will stay on my land anymore in the name of jesus tonight i'm sure you say that you've got to leave tonight i'm going to ask you for the land every square inch of it belongs to me too i'm not giving up i'm not giving it we're not leaving the hook behind we're taking it all and we're gonna leave this place satan has come musicians if you'll come set up residence in your body causing you pain and agony grief sickness mind battles he squatted on your peace squatted on your happiness robbed you your victory squatted on your freedom to worship quietened your praise he began to build complexes strongholds in your mind in your life put fears on you so you're afraid to occupy he's done everything he can to keep you from occupying your promise oh but listen phil brown says and then when you become a christian and you accept christ as your savior when god sends down the abstract it shows that no matter what your father did oh hallelujah it don't matter about that generational curse it don't have to be passed down any longer what your father did what your mother did what anybody else did your mother your daddy they might have been drunkers prostitutes whatever it was every sin is stricken off you've got an abstract title there's nothing can put you off of it everything that on that ground belongs to you amen he goes when you get jesus christ or christ jesus by the baptism of the holy ghost every gift of god belongs to the church it's an abstract title d he says what does an abstract mean it means it's been searched all the way back to the beginning like a little drop of ink this morning when it was struck that bleach it goes all the way back and the sin that that's been confessed and fall into the blood of jesus christ oh my he gives an abstract right straight back to the creator again and you become a son of god the abstract title deed is held in the hand of almighty god it's redemption it means all legal possession to all that was lost by adam and eve oh what it ought to do to avoid a green christian it's legal possession to the abstract deed the title deed of eternal life means that you possess everything that adam and eve love i say oh glory to god tonight i am a possessor of eternal life adam stepped out of eternity in the time but i'm stepping out of town back into eternity i said oh glory to god that's my promise and you are occupied by the promise of god let's stand and worship the lord tonight he said god sent the holy ghost back and he run all the squatters out write him out tonight maybe you've got a squatter on your leg he don't have to stay you've got a promise that promise belongs to you you've been called to occupy the promise whatever your need is you got a promise he said whatever you ask in
