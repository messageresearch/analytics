[11:45] [Music]
[11:48] early this morning i was
[11:52] teaching and we were studying the book
[11:55] of revelation chapter five and
[11:58] as i was just going through uh that
[12:00] chapter and
[12:02] just some of the the points that brother
[12:04] branham was bringing out
[12:05] one of the key things is just
[12:07] recognizing what the blood of jesus
[12:10] has actually done for us um
[12:13] sometimes i think we don't we don't
[12:15] reflect on it enough
[12:17] but uh he was just sharing how the blood
[12:20] actually restored
[12:22] everything that adam lost
[12:25] has been giving back to us since jesus
[12:28] died on the cross
[12:29] and uh sometimes we we fall short of uh
[12:32] what god has for us amen
[12:36] and you know his plans that he has for
[12:38] us but uh
[12:39] sometimes just just reflecting and just
[12:41] thinking about what the blood has done
[12:43] you don't have to accept anything that
[12:45] the devil just
[12:46] gives you a man i was reading a quote
[12:49] brother random say adam didn't have to
[12:50] be sick
[12:52] i didn't have to be tired adam didn't
[12:55] have to go to funeral services
[12:57] adam didn't have to you know i mean you
[12:58] just name about all the negative things
[13:00] that we go through all the stress that
[13:02] adam didn't have stress right you just
[13:04] think about that but that's what the
[13:06] blood came to take us back to
[13:07] to that place where we don't adam didn't
[13:10] have no worries
[13:11] i don't worry about how the bills was
[13:13] going to get paid you just think about
[13:15] it church that
[13:16] that that was not adam's condition and
[13:19] and as the the bride of jesus christ he
[13:21] has restored us back to this place
[13:23] amen that adam lost so amen i'm
[13:26] determined to walk
[13:27] in that amen i'm determined to walk in
[13:30] there
[13:31] praise the lord just a couple
[13:32] announcements that we'll make mention of
[13:35] amen and um we will prepare
[13:39] to receive our precious brother scott
[13:43] some of you all may know brother sherman

[13:48] twice and for he comes down for virginia
[13:51] and
[13:51] he often comes to the meetings there in
[13:54] uh

[14:51] and also uh we have a combined services
[14:54] for all the churches in this area
[14:56] we have not been able to do that since
[14:59] the outbreak of covet
[15:00] and um and and this would be the first
[15:03] time that we are coming back together
[15:05] and what we're
[15:05] what we're trying to do amen in all
[15:08] honesty churches
[15:10] uh i don't know about you but i've been
[15:11] missing having meetings
[15:14] i've been i've been missing that just
[15:16] having meetings you know with with the
[15:17] other believers and
[15:19] i believe there's a lot of other snakes
[15:20] been feeling the same way just missing
[15:22] that that meeting
[15:23] atmosphere uh it's one thing when we
[15:26] come together but it's a whole nother
[15:27] thing when
[15:28] everybody come together and uh so what
[15:30] we you know we were just trying to
[15:32] pray over some things and i was talking
[15:34] with brother westchester you know what
[15:35] would be good is that
[15:36] less you know rather than try to have a
[15:38] big meeting because every time i go to
[15:40] south carolina everybody saying when
[15:41] y'all gonna do something in florida
[15:43] when y'all gonna do something i don't
[15:45] know i don't know uh
[15:46] but uh but you know there's some things
[15:48] in the works and we'll let you know
[15:49] about it but i said
[15:50] before we do that maybe we should just
[15:52] have a meeting just amongst ourselves
[15:54] and let's just see how it all works out
[15:56] you know just do a couple of those
[15:58] amongst ourselves
[15:59] let's see how it all works out and i
[16:01] know that you know i i i made mention to
[16:03] the pastors i said you're going to have
[16:05] some saints that's going to feel
[16:06] comfortable with mass some that don't
[16:09] want i mean feel comfortable without the
[16:10] mask i say it's
[16:11] quite all right let everybody come as
[16:14] they as they feel
[16:15] right we're not putting no mandates on

[25:54] the word denied and the the revelation
[25:56] of god
[25:57] and just his word in this hour we can
[26:00] never
[26:00] underestimate revelation and the power
[26:03] of revelation i told the church just
[26:06] recently back home
[26:07] i said you know revelation in in my
[26:10] terms
[26:10] revelation is is is getting
[26:14] uh the the original mind of god
[26:18] uh out of the word and in other words
[26:20] when god
[26:21] when god placed that word here in in the
[26:25] bible the
[26:26] original intent and the original
[26:29] purpose and meaning amen revelation
[26:32] brings that out amen and it so it's it's
[26:35] a powerful thing you you actually
[26:38] see uh the original intent
[26:41] that god had in placing that there amen
[26:44] revelation brings that out to us
[26:46] amen revelation 22 and 17 and the spirit
[26:50] and the bride say come
[26:54] and let him that heareth say come
[26:58] and let him that is a thirst come and
[27:00] whosoever will let him
[27:02] take the water of life freely
[27:06] amen may god add his blessings you can
[27:09] be
[27:10] seated tonight i want to speak to you
[27:13] just for a few minutes this evening if
[27:15] we could from
[27:17] this verse 17 and i want uh if we would
[27:20] title it tonight i wanna
[27:22] title this uh the bride's attitude
[27:26] or the attitude of the bride can
[27:29] somebody say amen
[27:31] you know when you think of attitude it's
[27:33] it's a powerful thing even
[27:35] naturally when you look at attitude how
[27:38] how that it affects so many
[27:40] aspects of our life of course it'll make
[27:43] an employee a better employee
[27:46] it'll make a boss a better boss are you
[27:48] with me
[27:49] it it helps attitude it's proven
[27:52] scientifically medically
[27:54] that uh attitude is a difference maker
[27:57] you know i've heard it said that when
[27:59] things are equal
[28:01] the person with the best attitude will
[28:04] win when all other things are equal
[28:06] the person with the best attitude will
[28:08] win i've always
[28:10] heard it said that other things not
[28:13] being equal the person with the best
[28:16] attitude
[28:17] still usually wins amen in other words
[28:20] it it it gives an advantage are you with
[28:23] me
[28:24] uh it it will it it it is always
[28:27] right to have the right attitude amen
[28:30] and it's never right to have the wrong
[28:33] attitude
[28:34] are you with me and and so you you see
[28:36] all of these things and we could deal
[28:38] with a number of things
[28:39] naturally uh how even down to the health
[28:42] how
[28:43] a negative attitude how it how it tears
[28:46] the body down
[28:47] uh medically speak and it weakens the
[28:50] body and
[28:51] you know not not long ago i was looking
[28:53] i had some blood work done and one of
[28:55] the counts on it was
[28:57] um was a little bit off and i and and i
[29:00] began to look to see what could could
[29:02] could bring that
[29:03] that number down or that that certain
[29:05] count down and
[29:07] and i started looking at just pressure
[29:09] and
[29:10] and uh and and and anxiety and
[29:13] and you know and all of all of those
[29:15] things how that that that plays a part
[29:17] in your body
[29:19] your body knows that's going on and it
[29:21] and it responds and it begins to weaken
[29:24] certain things and how that you know a
[29:26] bad attitude begins to tear down and it
[29:29] begins to weaken
[29:30] things uh and and medically it's not
[29:33] good and
[29:34] and so we could look at you know a
[29:35] number of those things and we'll just
[29:37] we'll just
[29:38] move from uh you know that natural with
[29:41] saying this
[29:42] again it's never it's never good it's
[29:45] never healthy to have a bad attitude
[29:47] amen naturally it's it's it's good to
[29:50] have a good attitude
[29:52] are you with me now now when you look
[29:54] and you take the prophet of god and all
[29:57] the things that
[29:58] you know when that was revealed uh about
[30:01] attitude and
[30:02] and and how he ministered on you know
[30:05] our attitude and how
[30:07] it determines the outcome and so many
[30:09] things and
[30:10] how you know how he would tell us that
[30:13] in one place he says it this way he said
[30:15] no one ever
[30:16] come to christ in the right attitude
[30:20] but what went away with what they asked
[30:22] for
[30:24] no one now think about no one he says
[30:28] no one you'll not find one person in the
[30:31] scripture that ever
[30:33] came to god ever came to christ it with
[30:36] the right attitude that
[30:38] ever went away without what they had
[30:40] need of not one
[30:41] it's a powerful thing amen brother
[30:43] branham says of course the right and
[30:45] mental attitude toward
[30:46] any divine promise of god we'll bring it
[30:49] to pass
[30:50] amen so the attitude toward the word our
[30:53] attitude toward the word as the word is
[30:55] coming forth
[30:56] amen often determines what will happen
[30:59] amen in any given service
[31:01] amen at any given time amen he he taught
[31:04] us
[31:04] amen when you when you study all of you
[31:07] know of what the prophet said about
[31:09] attitude he
[31:10] he taught us that our attitude toward
[31:13] one another
[31:14] is actually our attitude toward god
[31:18] you know now some people you see they
[31:20] they they have a sorry attitude
[31:23] but they play spiritual but let me let
[31:26] me
[31:26] let me let me tell you something tonight
[31:28] amen according to the prophet of god our
[31:31] attitude
[31:32] toward others is our attitude toward god
[31:35] it's not a switch that we turn on and
[31:37] off amen there's not
[31:39] we're not a double-minded people amen we
[31:42] really don't have a double
[31:43] attitude tonight amen we've got one
[31:46] single attitude
[31:48] and that attitude determines aiming the
[31:51] outcome of most things that take place
[31:54] amen so our attitude toward one another
[31:57] he would even bring it down your
[31:58] attitude towards your
[32:00] spouse oh can i get a witness tonight
[32:04] amen is your attitude toward cr amen
[32:07] toward christ
[32:08] amen our attitude one to one another see
[32:12] is our real attitude i remember years
[32:14] ago even we had a
[32:16] we had a you know a sister that she had
[32:17] a a little gift in her life and could
[32:20] play music
[32:21] and things and and and you know could
[32:23] have could have been a real blessing
[32:25] but she had a she just had a real lousy
[32:28] attitude
[32:29] and and and so she she you know
[32:33] when she played she wanted all everybody
[32:35] to you know to
[32:36] listen to her and when she would sing
[32:38] everybody here and
[32:40] and and but what what happened people
[32:43] began to
[32:44] she began to lose you know influence and
[32:46] people's confidence
[32:48] in her was lowered because outside of
[32:51] the piano and outside of
[32:53] that gift she had a had just a poor
[32:55] attitude
[32:56] and and and so the people they came to
[32:59] me and said well you know why
[33:01] why is uh she asking why are the people
[33:04] not
[33:05] receiving me i said well you you got to
[33:07] understand
[33:08] something they they recognize that
[33:11] attitude you won't hardly speak to
[33:13] nobody when this church service is over
[33:15] you just ignore the other sisters come
[33:18] on
[33:18] oh my you just go on you've got some and
[33:21] then you want to play
[33:22] spiritual and act spiritual and have
[33:24] somebody to receive that
[33:26] amen but listen listen saints of god and
[33:29] i told her i said it don't work that way
[33:31] i said your attitude will will repel
[33:34] people
[33:35] that attitude listen the bride's
[33:37] attitude is an attraction
[33:39] oh listen the spirit and the bride say
[33:41] come
[33:42] see there is a drawing power there's a
[33:45] drawing attitude
[33:47] inside this bride and she draws people
[33:50] to him
[33:51] she's not looking to put people away
[33:53] amen there's a draw
[33:55] with this bride there's life in this
[33:58] bride
[33:58] there's a pool with this bride she's not
[34:01] repelling
[34:02] amen her attitude is not pushing people
[34:05] away
[34:06] she's drawing them to christ
[34:10] she's pulling them to the lord oh we're
[34:13] seeing one of the final moves of the
[34:15] bride in revelation 22
[34:17] and she's got a spirit on her that says
[34:19] come
[34:20] she's got a spirit that's amen that's
[34:22] becoming to something that is desired
[34:28] oh not just all not pushing oh i don't
[34:31] want to i don't want a spirit that
[34:32] repels people
[34:34] i don't want to spear i don't want to be
[34:35] that god all they don't want to talk to
[34:38] amen that one that they can't have a
[34:40] conversation with but
[34:41] i want to i want a spirit that would
[34:44] attract amen somebody to the lord
[34:46] amen that when you get done talking to
[34:49] them they want more of the lord not more
[34:51] of you
[34:52] amen but they desire they want more of
[34:54] the lord
[34:55] amen they see something in you amen an
[34:58] attitude
[34:59] amen of godliness see
[35:03] oh are you with me oh we're talking
[35:06] about a real attitude
[35:08] amen a right attitude the prophet of god
[35:10] told us that right attitude that right
[35:12] approach
[35:14] it'll move god it'll move him every time
[35:18] oh hallelujah i'm thinking of that sir
[35:20] phoenician woman
[35:23] how she came to christ remember now
[35:27] her approach was a little off at first
[35:30] when she called on him
[35:32] she called on him as son of david but as
[35:35] a seraphination woman
[35:37] she had no claims on him as son of david
[35:40] is that right amen she come to as a
[35:42] gentile she had no claims that way
[35:45] amen her approach is wrong she's coming
[35:48] now now deep down in
[35:49] she's right let's let's let's put it
[35:51] where it is deep down in
[35:53] we find out in the heart of hearts thank
[35:55] you brother you know
[35:56] in the heart of hearts we know that this
[35:58] sister is really right but i want you
[36:01] i want you to notice amen the wrong
[36:03] approach it didn't matter how
[36:04] right she was in it we could say in her
[36:07] seed life
[36:08] amen or the deepest part of her amen
[36:11] when she come with the wrong approach
[36:13] the bible said he didn't answer her
[36:15] brother amen never answered her a word
[36:18] she come oh son of david see she had no
[36:21] claims on him that way
[36:23] it didn't matter what hey come on amen
[36:26] you got you got no claims on him that
[36:28] way and remember the disciples began to
[36:30] say
[36:30] send her away she's troubling us and
[36:32] amen and finally remember
[36:34] amen she called on him and she said lord
[36:38] lord oh have mercy come on
[36:41] lord amen at that moment amen that
[36:44] approach was different
[36:46] amen and she got an immediate response
[36:48] from him
[36:49] amen because now her approach was
[36:52] aligned
[36:52] amen with who she really is listen bride
[36:56] i tell you
[36:56] he'll never deal with you outside of the
[36:59] capacity of who you really are
[37:01] amen you can't come to him as something
[37:03] else amen if you're a believer you come
[37:06] to him as a believer
[37:07] amen if you're the bride you come to him
[37:09] as a bride
[37:10] amen otherwise he'll stay silent oh but
[37:13] i'll tell you when we find that channel
[37:15] amen we find that approach amen and we
[37:18] come
[37:19] amen as who we are i'm telling you he's
[37:21] there to answer that need
[37:24] oh she come all right when she said lord
[37:27] he said oh my
[37:29] see see she now she was now coming
[37:34] with the right approach lord
[37:37] see you see these people today they're
[37:39] gentiles they want to act all jewish
[37:42] and you know and and do all listen
[37:46] if you're a gentile you got to come to
[37:47] him that way are you with me
[37:50] if you're a believer you've got to come
[37:51] to him that way if you come to him
[37:53] posing as an unbeliever you're probably
[37:55] not going to get far with him
[37:57] he may know deep down he knows all
[37:59] things he knows deep down in but you've
[38:02] got to come to him
[38:03] in the capacity that he's called you to
[38:05] and listen as the bride of jesus christ
[38:08] amen there's a capacity that we're in
[38:10] tonight
[38:11] a capacity that you've been called to
[38:14] amen and your approach to him comes that
[38:16] way
[38:17] amen and that's where help comes from
[38:20] [Music]
[38:22] oh my listen see we're living in an
[38:25] hour it's prophetic amen of another
[38:28] attitude there's an attitude on the
[38:30] on the overall population of the world
[38:33] second timothy chapter three paul would
[38:36] tell us about it
[38:38] he would say it this way
[38:42] i had it he would say it this way in 2
[38:45] timothy chapter 3 this know also
[38:48] that in the last days perilous times
[38:51] shall come
[38:52] for men shall be lovers of their own
[38:55] selves
[38:56] covetous boasters proud blasphemers
[39:00] disobedient to parents unthankful
[39:04] unholy now paul is showing you the
[39:06] attitude of the end time
[39:08] he's showing you the attitude of the
[39:10] general population
[39:12] now this is not just a a spirit on a
[39:14] small minority of people
[39:16] amen but this is the description of the
[39:19] of the
[39:19] of the last day population there's more
[39:22] of them with this
[39:24] than there are without it in other words
[39:27] this
[39:27] this is the attitudes that you come in
[39:30] contact with
[39:30] every day every day at work every day at
[39:33] school
[39:34] everywhere you go this is the attitude
[39:37] that we're dealing with
[39:38] hey man he would say though they would
[39:40] have a they would be heady high-minded
[39:42] lovers of pleasures
[39:44] more than lovers of god having a form of
[39:47] godliness
[39:49] but denying the power thereof from such
[39:52] turn away now he would tell us that this
[39:55] is
[39:56] this is the mannerism of the last day
[39:59] now
[39:59] you see this is where we got to be
[40:02] careful
[40:02] because it's so easy when you're around
[40:05] that all day
[40:06] and all that negativity and all of all
[40:09] of those things he described
[40:10] if you're not careful when you're around
[40:12] it so much you'll start acting like that
[40:15] i mean you'll pick that up and that
[40:17] negativity up
[40:18] and and down up and and the mannerism of
[40:21] the nation
[40:22] can you say amen amen the manner you
[40:25] know listen over in leviticus
[40:27] amen god was talking amen there in
[40:30] leviticus 20 and he told the people
[40:33] i mean the conditions of the day and
[40:35] what they were doing in their lifestyles
[40:37] and their
[40:37] and and their marriages and such he told
[40:40] them this he said and ye shall not
[40:42] walk in the manners of the nation
[40:45] leviticus 20 23 he said which i cast out
[40:48] before you
[40:49] for they committed all these things and
[40:52] therefore i abhorred them now
[40:54] when you look at the verse before that
[40:56] he actually tells them in verse 22
[40:58] that he spewed them out they were used
[41:01] as that word spew
[41:02] i mean you'll find that he uses that in
[41:04] leviticus 20 uses it i believe over
[41:06] leviticus 18.
[41:08] in in this in this manner he only uses
[41:11] it in this manner in one other place and
[41:13] that's revelation 3
[41:14] amen over into laodicea where they're
[41:17] again a people
[41:18] that have the mannerism of the nation
[41:21] and not the mannerism of god
[41:23] amen they've got the attitude of
[41:25] laodicea and not the lay
[41:27] and not the attitude of god amen they've
[41:29] got a laodicean attitude instead of a
[41:31] bride attitude
[41:32] oh but i'm telling you we're going to
[41:34] get we're going to get an attitude
[41:35] adjustment tonight
[41:36] amen god's going to help us tonight amen
[41:39] we're going to cast that other thing out
[41:41] amen amen god said i'll spew that out
[41:46] see this brother brown taught every
[41:48] every nation had spirits and
[41:50] they were controlled all even our
[41:53] precious america is controlled by
[41:55] by spirit and and the media see the
[41:59] media pulls the people
[42:01] amen in a design direction in a desired
[42:05] direction are you with me
[42:06] to promote whatever they want to promote
[42:09] and
[42:10] and you get caught up in that and before
[42:12] long you got some old mannerism of the
[42:14] united states
[42:15] but i'm telling you we don't need the
[42:16] mannerism of the united states
[42:18] we need the mannerism of another kingdom
[42:21] amen it is the kingdom of god
[42:24] and come on it is a bride kingdom it is
[42:27] a kingdom of belief
[42:28] listen that other kingdom there's
[42:30] nothing but doubt there's nothing but
[42:32] death
[42:33] there's nothing but sickness amen but we
[42:35] are amen
[42:36] pulling from another kingdom tonight
[42:40] and our attitude is reflecting that
[42:44] amen oh hallelujah
[42:48] see it used to be that the church
[42:50] influenced the nation
[42:55] now there's more national
[42:59] influence on the church and the nation
[43:02] has influenced the church
[43:03] they take on the same mindset and a lot
[43:06] of things get caught up in
[43:07] some of the same old foolishness amen
[43:10] driven
[43:11] a direct opposite of the way that it
[43:13] should be it should be this
[43:15] church penetrating that world
[43:17] penetrating that
[43:18] system penetrating the nation but it's
[43:21] the other way around
[43:22] 100 years ago was a little different are
[43:25] you with me
[43:27] amen but we are we are of another
[43:29] kingdom amen
[43:30] there's a there's a mannerism i'm
[43:32] thinking of the king son
[43:33] amen how i sold into slavery sold and
[43:37] sold into bondage amen and but you know
[43:40] what
[43:40] this man never let that out of the
[43:42] prophet of god said never did
[43:44] did he take on the attitude of those
[43:46] other people do you know why he knew
[43:49] amen there was nothing they could do to
[43:51] change who he really was
[43:53] amen he was a king son i may be
[43:56] surrounded by all kinds of craziness
[43:59] but i'm a king son i might be surrounded
[44:02] by all kinds of negativity
[44:04] but i'm a king son amen and nothing
[44:07] could change that
[44:08] amen nothing could change who he was
[44:11] amen in his attitude
[44:13] amen reflected that amen
[44:17] everybody else just took on
[44:20] just that mindset well it's not going to
[44:23] get any better
[44:24] [Laughter]
[44:26] it's just always going to be this way oh
[44:30] my
[44:32] i'm always going to have this problem
[44:34] i'm just i'm just gonna have to learn to
[44:36] live with it
[44:37] oh my i think we need to learn to live
[44:39] without it i think we need a different
[44:41] attitude
[44:42] i think we need an attitude i heard
[44:44] pastor talking about it early amen the
[44:46] blood of jesus christ
[44:48] has made a way it cleanseth us from all
[44:51] unrighteousness
[44:52] amen it purchased our healing amen it
[44:55] purchased our peace of mind
[44:57] amen it purchased our sanity in this

[1:06:48] for some time but he took a
[1:06:49] he took several pieces of jewelry uh
[1:06:52] rings did different things that he had
[1:06:55] and he wanted to make his wife
[1:06:57] a a certain a certain ring
[1:07:00] comprised of of several things i guess
[1:07:03] that he'd gotten her over the years and
[1:07:04] he took it to a
[1:07:06] a jeweler in town
[1:07:09] and so he they made the ring he was able
[1:07:12] to give it to her
[1:07:13] before he passed away and this ring was
[1:07:15] a six i don't know 65 or 70
[1:07:18] 000 ring and so no cheap ring
[1:07:22] and so she called me and and once she
[1:07:24] got the ring and she said well i need
[1:07:26] i need this thing insured i don't want
[1:07:28] to um
[1:07:29] you know just just have regular
[1:07:31] insurance that won't pay but a couple
[1:07:33] thousand dollars on jewelry
[1:07:35] and i said well sure no problem i told
[1:07:37] her what to do you know we had to have a
[1:07:38] an appraisal that was within just a
[1:07:41] month or two
[1:07:42] and and those kind of things and some
[1:07:44] photos and and things real simple
[1:07:47] process and we got it and we insured the
[1:07:49] ring
[1:07:50] she said it's she said there's no price
[1:07:52] uh you know that that
[1:07:54] could replace it she said it's it's so
[1:07:56] special
[1:07:57] and she was telling me the background of
[1:07:59] it and what he did and of course then he
[1:08:00] passed away
[1:08:01] and so we insured that ring well several
[1:08:04] months later literally just several
[1:08:06] months later
[1:08:08] it can always happen in the in the
[1:08:09] insurance business
[1:08:11] but several months later i get a phone

[1:08:39] to house and she said it's gone
[1:08:41] she said i have turned the place she
[1:08:42] said actually happened i don't know a
[1:08:45] week or so back and said i've just been

[1:08:58] don't know what else to do
[1:08:59] um it's gone and and and so i'm gonna

[1:09:10] course this type of policy
[1:09:12] um there there's no deductible the
[1:09:14] premium she pays kind of covers that

[1:09:19] gonna have to just cut a check for this
[1:09:20] after they do their
[1:09:22] their little investigation and so she's
[1:09:24] heartbroken and and
[1:09:25] and so i was talking to her and i said
[1:09:28] well
[1:09:29] you know has anybody been in your home
[1:09:31] and she said well
[1:09:32] she said you know honestly she said no
[1:09:35] but i said i had a couple contractors
[1:09:37] over

[1:09:40] out outside
[1:09:42] and there was some wiring and lights
[1:09:44] that needed to be done and they had to
[1:09:46] bring in
[1:09:46] an electrician and so we had the
[1:09:49] landscaper and the electrician there
[1:09:52] and she said but they were outside the
[1:09:54] whole time she said
[1:09:55] the only time anybody come in my house

[1:27:11] house of the lord tonight
[1:27:13] and i believe we all leave here
[1:27:16] just a little drawing a heartstring a
[1:27:19] little closer to the lord jesus
[1:27:21] the attitude of the bride and
[1:27:24] this is one that we certainly want to go
[1:27:26] back and listen to
[1:27:28] uh you know as much as we can and and
[1:27:31] i'm just
[1:27:32] grateful that a precious brother scott
[1:27:35] just
[1:27:35] saw fit to take time from his vacation
[1:27:38] drive two and a half hours
[1:27:40] down here to minister the word of the
[1:27:43] lord to us
[1:27:44] and the this is what i call a
[1:27:46] life-changing sermon
[1:27:48] all right a life-changing sermon you
[1:27:50] know thinking about
[1:27:52] some of the things that we talked about
[1:27:53] on on sunday as far as
[1:27:55] you know i was reading a quote where
[1:27:56] brother randall was talking about you
[1:27:58] know
[1:27:58] you just have to be who god made you and
[1:28:01] i was saying no that some there's some
[1:28:02] things in us that we know we gotta work
[1:28:05] on
[1:28:06] and the word has a way of just working
[1:28:08] these things out so he comes right back
[1:28:09] and just kind of connects that
[1:28:11] and uh and and i am i'm taking that
[1:28:15] first corinthians 7 14.
[1:28:18] taking that one with me your your
[1:28:21] righteousness
[1:28:22] is greater than their unrighteousness
[1:28:26] your holiness is greater than their
[1:28:29] unholiness no matter what you see
[1:28:33] what you fail to see is who you are
[1:28:36] right and as as he was just kind of
[1:28:38] going through that there's a
[1:28:40] couple situations that came uh to mine
[1:28:43] there and
[1:28:44] you all remember brother branham talking
[1:28:45] about uh
[1:28:47] the the drunks that was in the bar and
[1:28:50] talking about
[1:28:51] uh who uh who was a real christian who
[1:28:53] wasn't and the one man said
[1:28:55] my wife is a real christian her
[1:28:57] righteousness
[1:28:59] was greater than their unrighteousness
[1:29:02] her holiness was great in their unholy
[1:29:04] limbs because the end of the stories
[1:29:06] that
[1:29:06] they got saved not she backslid
[1:29:11] right hallelujah i think about
[1:29:14] hattie wright her righteousness was
[1:29:17] greater than her son's
[1:29:18] unrighteousness both boys
[1:29:22] right and by her requesting the
[1:29:24] salvation of those boys she got exactly
[1:29:26] what she asked for
[1:29:27] uh church we got to recognize who we are

[1:29:34] stronger

[1:34:06] they want to be

[1:34:10] our life has got to be centered around
[1:34:12] what happens at the church

[1:34:18] going to get you out on a limb and now
[1:34:20] you ain't going to be able to get back
[1:34:21] to church
[1:34:21] but try to find something right in the
[1:34:23] church i was right near the church i was
[1:34:25] telling a brother
[1:34:26] uh years ago there was a scripture that
[1:34:28] came to me
[1:34:29] deuteronomy 28 i believe i was reading
[1:34:31] and the bible says
[1:34:32] i would be blessed in the city blessed
[1:34:35] in the field
[1:34:36] blessed coming out blessed going in you
[1:34:39] know and i started reading that and then
[1:34:41] it just kind of struck me
[1:34:42] the lord said i'll be blessed in my city
[1:34:45] what that meant to me is that i didn't
[1:34:47] have to leave my city to get blessed
[1:34:49] i can be blessed in my city
[1:34:52] [Music]
[1:34:54] and if the devil telling you that you
[1:34:55] have to leave here to get blessed tell
[1:34:56] the devil hear a liar
[1:34:58] the bible says i'll be blessed in this
[1:35:00] city
[1:35:01] i don't care how expensive it is to live
[1:35:03] here i'ma still be blessed
[1:35:09] so i want to just give you all that but
[1:35:11] y'all pray for brother frankie
[1:35:12] amen and sister gene they really want to
[1:35:15] be closer
[1:35:16] and um god just doing some amazing
[1:35:18] things in our midst that's all i can say
[1:35:20] and i just appreciate them so y'all be
[1:35:23] seated

[1:35:38] north carolina on saturday keep them in
[1:35:41] the church in prayer
[1:35:42] amen lighthouse of lenoir
[1:35:45] and then brother scott was telling me
[1:35:47] the testimony of the church he
[1:35:49] just they put a lighthouse they brought
[1:35:51] it from out of nowhere he saw this thing
[1:35:53] he was taking a trip to go preach and
[1:35:55] he said where that lighthouse come from
[1:35:56] he say that's the lighthouse gave him
[1:35:58] inspiration it's going to be lighthouse
[1:35:59] of lenoir of the
[1:36:01] the name of the church and he just just
[1:36:03] took that by inspiration they called it
[1:36:05] that's what they called it and a few
[1:36:06] years later a minister passed through
[1:36:08] that was coming from uh
[1:36:10] i guess he spoke french and i think he
[1:36:12] was overseas and he spoke french and he
[1:36:14] says
[1:36:15] lighthouse illinois he said that's
[1:36:17] pretty amazing
[1:36:18] he says because in french lenoir means
[1:36:21] darkness
[1:36:23] that's what lenore means but this is the
[1:36:25] lighthouse of darkness
[1:36:27] in the midst of darknesses light is
[1:36:30] still shining
[1:36:32] i said well god know how to do things so
[1:36:35] we just appreciate the lord
