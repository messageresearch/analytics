[31:26] we really appreciated that special
[31:30] praise the
[31:31] Lord I have a prayer request up here
[31:34] from Sister
[31:35] Zelma amen we don't have any written
[31:39] praise reports
[31:43] but praise reports are very very
[31:47] important sometimes we
[31:50] don't it's a testimony somebody has been
[31:53] through a
[31:54] test I remember Sister Zelma getting up
[31:57] and she was is testifying when she made
[32:00] mention that if God could hear our
[32:03] prayers for us the Johnson family over
[32:05] in Dubai he could hear her
[32:08] prayer during that time we weren't
[32:11] happy but when you hear that somebody
[32:14] else was encouraged and got faith to
[32:17] overcome their test and their trial then
[32:19] you can shout
[32:21] hallelujah so it's very important to
[32:24] give your testimony don't matter how big
[32:27] or how small
[32:28] God is God and he moved in your life so
[32:31] we want to give him
[32:35] praise amen thank God for not breaking
[32:38] my
[32:39] glasses
[32:40] Hallelujah uh sister Zelma writes
[32:45] uh I'm asking the church to pray for my
[32:48] brother his name is Jerry Taylor he fell
[32:52] yesterday and broke his hip he's already
[32:55] in a nursing facility and we seen the
[32:57] hand of God move on him and he was back
[32:59] up walking from a stroke he had last
[33:02] year I know the devil wants to take his
[33:05] life but I claim my family for the
[33:07] kingdom of God that they are
[33:10] saved so the token is applied I truly
[33:14] believe through every sermon that has
[33:16] been taught that this is the year of
[33:19] restoration it's been too many
[33:21] testimonies that has that has been
[33:22] coming forth to get discouraged I know
[33:26] God is able to do exceeding abundantly
[33:29] above all I ask or thank you amen I
[33:33] believe that if you believe Give the
[33:35] Lord a hand clap of Praise
[33:40] hallelujah
[33:41] amen he's a Healer savior deliverer
[33:47] restorer and more than that amen praise
[33:51] the Lord so that's the only prayer
[33:53] request we have I haven't seen brother
[33:56] quu but I believe he's back in his
[33:57] States and the Lord has brought him back
[33:59] home safe so we want to thank the Lord
[34:01] for that amen can I have the

[40:41] [Music]
[40:45] come God bless you I'm getting over cold
[40:47] so please bear with me um I just want to
[40:50] explain this song I actually wrote this
[40:52] song last year um and it came
[40:55] from something that I was feeling that I
[40:58] know many uh Christians feel as well as
[40:59] children of God sometimes we feel that
[41:03] we're not loved by God that um we've
[41:05] messed up too much anything you know
[41:07] feelings of discouragement feelings of
[41:09] doubt and um you know sometimes the
[41:13] devil will use those times when you're
[41:14] feeling that way to speak all types of
[41:17] Lies into your mind um and you know the
[41:19] word of God but sometimes you're just so
[41:21] discouraged but um I wrote this song
[41:24] from a standpoint of you have to know
[41:27] that the word of God is your ultimate
[41:29] absolute no matter what you're feeling
[41:32] it's not the truth the word of God is
[41:34] your truth so hope it's a
[41:45] blessing I'm feeling weak I can't talk I
[41:50] can't see do you still hear me oh I'm
[41:55] down on my knees
[41:58] God you promised me that you would never
[42:03] leave so why do I feel so
[42:09] lonely feelings lie that's the fact of
[42:16] life you are all that I need I can't
[42:22] deny but God in emotions I can't see
[42:27] your
[42:28] devotion you God no matter what I
[42:34] see and even now I choose to
[42:50] believe you might feel down like you
[42:54] won't turn around
[42:58] you wear us M but inside is tough around
[43:03] but God sees you way you are with your
[43:07] doubts and with your scars tell his know
[43:11] he isn't very
[43:14] far and no
[43:17] feelings Li that's the fact of
[43:21] life he is all that you need you can do
[43:27] Li the C in emotions you won't see his
[43:34] devotion he is God no matter what you
[43:40] see so even now please choose to
[43:49] believe choose is that God knows the way
[43:54] that we feel
[43:57] he knows that we sometimes doubt and
[44:01] can't feel that he is always near in our
[44:06] fear and in our Che so please turn a
[44:10] little Sun
[44:13] ear and no feelings lie that's a fact of
[44:20] life he is all that we need we can't
[44:25] deny
[44:27] the C in emotions we can't see his
[44:32] devotion he is God no matter what we
[44:38] see and even now we
[44:41] choose even now we choose all feelings
[44:47] they right that of facts our
[44:51] life here is all that I need I can't Den
[44:56] now
[44:57] but God in emotions I can't see your
[45:03] devotion you are God no matter what I
[45:08] see and even now I choose to
[45:15] believe yes you're God no matter what we
[45:21] see and even now we choose to believe

[1:02:47] life and uh and I and I made a promise
[1:02:50] to the Lord that I would serve him till

[1:02:59] going to glorify in the midst of this
[1:03:01] you know I just I was just I was just
[1:03:03] working my way down memory lane and just

[1:03:12] is a lot of times we we um we have
[1:03:15] people uh um we we we we put down um
[1:03:21] where we come from all right I can put
[1:03:23] it that way it's the grace of God that
[1:03:25] brought us to the Revelation that we
[1:03:27] have but everything that you went
[1:03:30] through back there wasn't
[1:03:33] bad it did introduce you to the Lord
[1:03:36] right and some of those things can be a
[1:03:38] blessing you know if you just allow it
[1:03:40] to be a blessing to you praise the Lord
[1:03:43] and man some of the young people y'all
[1:03:45] don't y'all y'all didn't go through any
[1:03:46] of that back there but that's that's
[1:03:49] part of our our our
[1:03:52] history that's that's where we come from
[1:03:54] and and and sometime I don't mind going
[1:03:57] back and just touching it just a little
[1:03:59] bit praise God praise God that was that
[1:04:04] was the Baptist Church Hallelujah see
[1:04:06] then we would we when you go to the
[1:04:08] Pentecost Church they they didn't use a
[1:04:12] lot of
[1:04:13] hymns actually the songs that they wrote
[1:04:16] didn't have any

[1:11:43] 11 and 12 amen verse 11 and 12 says this
[1:11:47] verily I say unto you among them that
[1:11:50] are born of women there are not risen a
[1:11:53] greater than John the Baptist
[1:11:55] notwithstanding he that is least in the
[1:11:58] Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he and
[1:12:01] from the days of John the Baptist until
[1:12:03] now the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth
[1:12:05] violence and the violent take it by
[1:12:08] force amen Let's uh have a word of
[1:12:10] prayer father we thank you for your word
[1:12:12] we thank you for the uh ability Lord to
[1:12:16] come here and worship we feel your
[1:12:19] spirit amen in this place and just trust
[1:12:21] oh God that uh as we turn to the word
[1:12:24] that you would bring instruction that
[1:12:27] you would bring direction that you would
[1:12:28] bring encouragement that you bring
[1:12:30] correction that you bring everything we
[1:12:32] need uh from the word today bring
[1:12:35] healing bring Deliverance God let the
[1:12:38] word do what it has the power to do uh
[1:12:41] ask oh God that you take control over
[1:12:42] every thought every thought being
[1:12:44] presented every thought being received
[1:12:46] and uh may you get all the glory out of
[1:12:48] this portion of the service in Jesus
[1:12:49] name we pray amen amen God bless you um
[1:12:54] also I did want to thank God for the
[1:12:55] sisters that are here with us amen came
[1:12:58] with sister Esther God bless you all
[1:13:00] amen and and I was back there just uh
[1:13:03] watching online too what about while um
[1:13:06] waiting to come out and um I don't
[1:13:09] typically do I don't usually watch too
[1:13:11] much online but I did today and I saw um
[1:13:15] uh some comments coming from sister
[1:13:18] fulford and I believe that is uh brother
[1:13:22] maris's grandmother amen we want want to
[1:13:25] say God bless you and uh we looking
[1:13:27] forward to seeing you in person sister
[1:13:30] fford amen God bless you God bless you
[1:13:34] amen but uh our thought today is going
[1:13:37] on the offense and um you know I just
[1:13:40] like the way that the Lord uh aligns
[1:13:44] things amen uh the way he he just he
[1:13:47] does it he does all things well uh in
[1:13:51] his own timing and uh what I what I I
[1:13:55] noticed is that as we were uh entering
[1:13:58] into this uh sermon I knew it was coming
[1:14:02] and I was just waiting waiting waiting
[1:14:04] there were a couple things the Lord
[1:14:05] began to do one was a sermon that
[1:14:07] brother Mark preached where he said it's
[1:14:09] time to fight and I knew that was a
[1:14:12] confirmation and then um you know and
[1:14:15] then on in our Wednesday night uh Bible
[1:14:18] study we've been going through Ephesians
[1:14:20] 6 and we're currently talking about that
[1:14:23] that armor of God
[1:14:25] amen and I believe that the Holy Ghost
[1:14:28] aligns things so perfectly like that and
[1:14:31] just even on this Wednesday we were
[1:14:33] talking about having your feet
[1:14:35] shot uh with the preparation of the
[1:14:38] gospel of peace and just a little note
[1:14:41] that I had in my Bible uh what that
[1:14:44] means is the uh there's it means
[1:14:47] eagerness that comes from the gospel of
[1:14:50] peace that having your feet sha with the
[1:14:52] preparation of the Gospel peace is an
[1:14:54] eagerness that comes from the gospel of
[1:14:57] peace and they said the Roman soldier
[1:15:00] would wear special shoes called uh calay
[1:15:04] right and and they put the calay on the
[1:15:06] feet and the reason that they wore these
[1:15:08] shoes is that these shoes enabled them
[1:15:12] to advance against the enemy and I like
[1:15:17] that definition because when you're
[1:15:18] going on the offense you're not backing
[1:15:21] up from the enemy like we read last week
[1:15:25] there's no jumping back when the devil
[1:15:26] say boo no we say boo back and that
[1:15:31] devil begins to get smaller and smaller
[1:15:34] and smaller and notice the thing that in
[1:15:37] the dream the man only use his mouth
[1:15:40] amen and his boo was whatever the word
[1:15:43] of God said right he going going to only
[1:15:45] repeat what the word say it's let me let
[1:15:48] me just say this it's okay to tell us
[1:15:51] your problem Hallelujah but we know that
[1:15:55] you also have the solution on the inside
[1:15:58] of you so we want to hear your solution
[1:16:01] don't just end with just what the
[1:16:02] problem is tell us what the word of God
[1:16:04] say concerning your problem praise the
[1:16:07] Lord that way we can touch and agree
[1:16:09] with you on what the word say hallelujah
[1:16:14] hallelujah let me just uh inject this uh
[1:16:17] you know brother Quinton sto me this
[1:16:19] morning just to tell me something he was
[1:16:20] just listening to Service uh there and
[1:16:23] brother brother Benny per was preaching
[1:16:25] in in London at brother brother gw's and
[1:16:28] brother Benny Perry was preaching on a
[1:16:29] sermon um um kind of kind of being ready
[1:16:34] for when inspiration strikes right when
[1:16:36] inspiration strikes you got to be ready
[1:16:38] you got to be ready to speak something
[1:16:40] so uh you know as they were he was going
[1:16:42] on he say the Holy Spirit just kind of
[1:16:44] told him uh he's like well what would I
[1:16:46] ask for if inspiration struck me what
[1:16:49] would I ask for he says he didn't he's
[1:16:51] like I don't know what to really ask for
[1:16:52] so start going through little things I
[1:16:54] mean things in his life that he might
[1:16:55] want he said no no I don't want to ask
[1:16:58] for me I want to ask for somebody else
[1:17:00] then start thinking about different
[1:17:01] people in the church he said maybe I ask
[1:17:03] this for them he said no I got to go
[1:17:04] further than that he says I got to think
[1:17:06] about the whole church as a whole He if
[1:17:09] I if if inspiration was to strike me I'm
[1:17:12] going to ask God for a church and a
[1:17:18] school yes sir and you see if you abide
[1:17:21] in me and my words abide in you then ask
[1:17:25] what you will right so the inspiration
[1:17:27] struck so he asked for I say I touch and
[1:17:30] agree with you and I'm believing God we
[1:17:32] going to get
[1:17:34] it but this this this this this
[1:17:38] preparation of the gospel of peace you
[1:17:40] have to have a eagerness amen an an
[1:17:44] eagerness uh to advance against the
[1:17:46] enemy right and the Christian must have
[1:17:49] on his feet or possess a sense of
[1:17:52] eagerness or a willingness to Advance
[1:17:56] against the devil and I and I like this
[1:17:59] take the fight to
[1:18:02] him you know the devil don't have no
[1:18:04] problem bringing a fight to
[1:18:06] you he brought one to me this week I
[1:18:09] wasn't expecting that he hit me my car
[1:18:11] got got had all kind of I took it for
[1:18:13] one thing and had three or four problems
[1:18:16] I said well Leisa and and and and
[1:18:18] brother Frankie being a mechanic I was
[1:18:19] running some things by him he said
[1:18:20] brother I actually thought after I had
[1:18:22] it fixed and and I paid for it I say I
[1:18:24] said brother I wasn't expecting all that
[1:18:26] he says brother I thought it was going
[1:18:28] to be an engine failure I said oh well
[1:18:32] uh if it ain't engine failure and I got
[1:18:33] something to be grateful
[1:18:36] for and I my attitude shifted and I
[1:18:40] began to be uh more uh thankful than
[1:18:43] actually complaining about how much I
[1:18:44] had to spend the devil didn't have no
[1:18:46] problem bringing the the the battle to
[1:18:48] me and I didn't have no problem coming
[1:18:50] right back with part two of this sermon
[1:18:52] today brother we advance
[1:18:56] against the enemy right Glory you better
[1:18:59] get out of our way we coming after you
[1:19:02] devil hey
[1:19:05] hallelujah amen amen amen it says that
[1:19:09] to the willingness to advance against
[1:19:10] the devil and take the fight to him such
[1:19:14] eagerness Amen to contend with Satan
[1:19:17] comes from the gospel of peace amen the
[1:19:21] gospel gives peace to the believer
[1:19:23] freeing him from
[1:19:26] anxiety now what what gives you freedom
[1:19:28] from anxiety is the word of God it frees
[1:19:31] him from anxiety like my my daughter say
[1:19:34] don't don't trust your feelings trust
[1:19:36] the word y your feelings change like the
[1:19:39] weather that's right praise the Lord
[1:19:42] amen and and and you can't trust this
[1:19:44] Florida weather especially this time of
[1:19:45] year my you you get rain and and the
[1:19:48] rain is is it might be raining here but
[1:19:52] it's not raining there and all you need
[1:19:55] to do is just switch positions and you
[1:19:57] won't get drowned in rain come on
[1:19:59] somebody amen or actually the floorida
[1:20:02] rain it only last like this so if you
[1:20:04] can just endure it just for a little bit
[1:20:07] you'll see the sun shine again yes
[1:20:11] hallelujah amen but it says uh they said
[1:20:14] here such eagerness to contend with
[1:20:16] Satan comes from the gospel of peace the
[1:20:18] gospel gives peace to the believer
[1:20:21] freeing him from anxiety through the
[1:20:23] advance of uh uh though he advances
[1:20:26] against such a powerful opponent amen
[1:20:30] hallelujah so we we got this this feat
[1:20:32] sharp of the preparation of the gospel
[1:20:33] of peace I'mma go to a quote out of the
[1:20:36] fundamental foundation for Faith but you
[1:20:39] know yeah let's let's just go there for
[1:20:41] right now uh and I want to read this to
[1:20:44] you brother Brandon makes a statement he
[1:20:46] says if you want to go back a little
[1:20:48] further it says just as far as
[1:20:52] historical you could
[1:20:53] see it says um you can see the word in
[1:20:57] the beginning was the word but what is
[1:21:00] the word it says a word is a thought
[1:21:03] manifested a thought spoken forth God
[1:21:06] first he perceived the thought and spoke
[1:21:09] it and meant become a word and the word
[1:21:11] became material and it says so
[1:21:14] everything that God has spoke in his
[1:21:16] word received into the right
[1:21:20] channel received into the right channel
[1:21:24] everything that God has spoken his word
[1:21:26] if it's received into the right channel
[1:21:30] then it will materialize that word for
[1:21:32] whatever the promise behind it is now
[1:21:35] you know this is important to me because
[1:21:37] when brother Frankie just kind of sent
[1:21:39] me that text and say brother I thought
[1:21:41] this was when you text me what the
[1:21:42] problem was I thought it could have been
[1:21:44] engine failure and I'm thinking engine
[1:21:46] failure I'm not getting ready to put no
[1:21:48] new engine in my truck I'm going have to
[1:21:50] go buy another truck and I just paid
[1:21:52] this thing off I don't want to buy no
[1:21:54] another truck truck right so engine F I
[1:21:57] said Lord I Thank you but see the thing
[1:21:58] of it is is um I was complaining about
[1:22:01] how much money I had to spend on it but
[1:22:03] but not realizing that the god that
[1:22:05] allowed me to spend the money is able to
[1:22:07] give me back the money because I'm under
[1:22:11] restoration not losses come on church
[1:22:15] right so so so so but but in order to to
[1:22:18] reach restoration my attitude got to be
[1:22:21] right see before before the word can be
[1:22:24] man manifested to you amen before it be
[1:22:26] materialized it's got to be received
[1:22:28] into the right channel that mean your
[1:22:30] attitude got to be adjusted amen your
[1:22:33] attitude got to be right in order for
[1:22:34] God's promise to be fulfilled in your
[1:22:37] life oh Hallelujah I thank God for this
[1:22:40] it says whatever promise behind it
[1:22:44] behind it is God will do it he's
[1:22:45] obligated to it can I say that again it
[1:22:48] says uh the he the uh the god it
[1:22:51] everything that God has spoken his word
[1:22:53] Reed into the right channel will
[1:22:57] materialize that word for whatever the
[1:23:01] promise behind it is God will do it he's
[1:23:05] obligated to
[1:23:08] it Hallelujah I say Amen then if you
[1:23:13] abide in me and my word abide in you
[1:23:17] then you have God the word in you and
[1:23:21] you believe the word just as you believe
[1:23:24] God because it is God and it's
[1:23:26] Inseparable then if you have God's word
[1:23:29] in you you have God's life in you you
[1:23:32] have God in you and whatever God's word
[1:23:35] speaks forth out
[1:23:38] uhoh I don't know if we catching I'm
[1:23:40] trying to slow down here the prophet is
[1:23:43] telling us that we have God in us we
[1:23:46] have his word in us he's he ain't coming
[1:23:51] he's already here yes sir come come on
[1:23:54] Church he's already here I don't have to
[1:23:56] wait for a special feeling because God
[1:23:59] already dwells on the inside of me amen
[1:24:03] I know his word is already in me right
[1:24:07] so he says and whatever God's word
[1:24:10] speaks forth out of
[1:24:13] you whatever his word speaks forth out
[1:24:16] of
[1:24:18] you it'll have to come to pass just like
[1:24:22] it was spoke from God
[1:24:25] and I I I serve a God the god that
[1:24:28] dwells inside of me is the same God that
[1:24:31] spoke at the beginning when he saw
[1:24:34] nothing when he felt nothing praise God
[1:24:39] he was looking at emptiness everywhere
[1:24:42] but in order to change the situation
[1:24:46] that God said let there
[1:24:52] be praise God that's the god that's
[1:24:56] living inside of you all you got to do
[1:24:59] is open your mouth say the same thing he
[1:25:02] said let there

[1:25:59] like it was spoke from God
[1:26:01] hallelujah
[1:26:06] hallelujah and the prophet goes and puts
[1:26:09] it right back in Scripture it says Jesus
[1:26:12] said whatever you ask the father in my
[1:26:17] name that will I do did you ever realize
[1:26:21] what that means did you realize guys if
[1:26:25] we go before God In The Name of
[1:26:28] Jesus it's just the same as Jesus
[1:26:31] himself
[1:26:33] praying yes sir yes sir it isn't me
[1:26:37] praying
[1:26:38] anymore if I come in his name and he
[1:26:42] recognizes his name and Jesus said
[1:26:47] whatever you ask the father in my name
[1:26:51] that I do and then I I go to the father
[1:26:56] in Jesus name it isn't me praying
[1:26:59] anymore it's
[1:27:02] jesusall it's his Spirit praying through
[1:27:05] me and then I've got to
[1:27:09] receive Hallelujah it don't matter how
[1:27:13] long it take I got to receive it do you
[1:27:17] know when God said let there be
[1:27:22] light the Bible only records one thing
[1:27:26] after he said let there be light the
[1:27:28] Bible records there was light but the
[1:27:32] prophet told us that it could have took
[1:27:33] millions of years before light came but
[1:27:38] the God we serve when he spoke it he
[1:27:41] stopped well actually he never even
[1:27:43] started he didn't worry about what he
[1:27:46] said you can't speak it and then start
[1:27:50] worrying as the weather's going to come
[1:27:52] to pass that's not the way God operates
[1:27:56] when God said let there be he just went
[1:27:59] to start working on something
[1:28:02] else sir sir because God believed his
[1:28:06] own
[1:28:07] word and if that God is living inside of
[1:28:11] you it's time for you to believe the
[1:28:13] word of God that is in you yes sir yes
[1:28:17] sir
[1:28:24] this going Beyond believe it and receive
[1:28:26] it I'm telling you it's already in you
[1:28:30] the secret is you want to know the
[1:28:33] secret the secret is the word is in the
[1:28:38] blood and the mind of Christ to know
[1:28:43] what he wants done with his word yes
[1:28:47] [Applause]
[1:28:50] sir brother it's going on this is offens
[1:28:53] of material
[1:28:55] amen we're going on the offense so here
[1:28:58] the prophet goes on it says uh whatever
[1:29:02] you ask the father my name that I do and
[1:29:04] then I then I go to the father in Jesus
[1:29:06] name it isn't me praying anymore it's
[1:29:08] Jesus is his Spirit praying through me
[1:29:10] and then I got to receive what I asked
[1:29:12] for because he said it and it's God's
[1:29:15] Own word it can't do nothing else but
[1:29:18] produce just what it said amen says so
[1:29:22] then we we believe that
[1:29:24] we are this is the confidence that we
[1:29:26] have in God that we get what we ask for
[1:29:28] now he's quoting another scripture out
[1:29:29] of John this is the
[1:29:32] confidence as that we have the
[1:29:34] confidence we have in God that we get
[1:29:36] what we ask
[1:29:38] for we get the church we get the school
[1:29:41] we get the healing we get the
[1:29:44] Deliverance amen and and and can I put
[1:29:47] it this way cuz brother Brandon preached
[1:29:48] the me he well he might have preached
[1:29:51] the message called Deliverance but what
[1:29:52] I'm in what the one that I'm thinking
[1:29:53] right now that he preached he said
[1:30:01] total so we're not selling for partway
[1:30:06] deliverance can I go can I say it like
[1:30:08] this I'm happy to see you in
[1:30:10] church come on but you got a little
[1:30:13] further to

[1:30:51] warriors in the church

[1:30:58] believe that we are this is a confidence
[1:31:00] we have in God that we get what we asked
[1:31:02] for for he's God and cannot take back
[1:31:05] his
[1:31:06] word and that's even a word that's
[1:31:08] coming out of you God can't take that
[1:31:10] back amen it says uh cannot take back
[1:31:13] his word he's got to stay with his word
[1:31:15] so then if you abide in me and my words
[1:31:17] abide in you ask what you will and it'll
[1:31:20] be given unto you isn't that simple it
[1:31:23] says Faith created we was made for that

[1:31:36] go I'm going read the rest of this quote
[1:31:37] I'm going tell you why we're not doing
[1:31:39] it amen and the rest of the quote says
[1:31:42] this we was made for that purpose then
[1:31:45] through the fall why we was taken away
[1:31:48] from that then in
[1:31:50] Redemption we was brought back to do it
[1:31:54] again yes Lord
[1:31:56] hallelujah and the only thing that
[1:32:00] hindered the human race today from being
[1:32:04] Superior and
[1:32:06] controlling like they did in the
[1:32:08] beginning is because that the power
[1:32:11] lines of the outlet of God made in the
[1:32:15] human being has been clogged
[1:32:19] up oh I read that and got a little I I
[1:32:23] got up set with the devil it's time my
[1:32:26] power lines have been clogged up any of
[1:32:29] y'all ever had a clogged up sink or tub
[1:32:32] or something like that and it just it
[1:32:34] the the if the tub get clogged up S

[1:32:55] and and you got to get special uh uh
[1:32:58] stuff to pour into that in order to
[1:33:02] break it all
[1:33:03] down and once once you pour whether it's
[1:33:06] Drano or whatever it is you pour it in
[1:33:09] there and just let it
[1:33:10] sit it has a way of just breaking down
[1:33:13] all these chemicals and a amen the
[1:33:16] chemicals break all the stuff down and
[1:33:18] before you know it's all running smooth
[1:33:21] again Hallelujah the Holy Ghost has been
[1:33:24] coming into the church with the message
[1:33:27] The transformational Power of Love
[1:33:30] breaking down things oh I I know what
[1:33:33] I'm talking about walls are being broke
[1:33:36] down by the power of
[1:33:39] love amen the transformative Power of
[1:33:43] Love things are being broken down and
[1:33:45] and when things are being broke down
[1:33:47] then that's when things start running
[1:33:48] smoothly again the gifts can run
[1:33:51] smoothly again when we got the line the
[1:33:54] power lines free yes sir amen thank you
[1:33:58] Lord all right I was made for this you
[1:34:00] was made for this it's been God's plan
[1:34:03] all along so here we got to understand
[1:34:06] that we've been under attack by the
[1:34:08] enemy that's why the scripture tells us
[1:34:11] amen the kingdom of of of God the
[1:34:14] Kingdom of Heaven been suffering
[1:34:15] violence it's been under attack but the
[1:34:19] violent have to take it by force that
[1:34:22] mean the devil ain't just going to give
[1:34:23] give this to you you going have to do
[1:34:25] something to go get what belongs to you
[1:34:28] am I was looking at this amen scripture
[1:34:32] and uh I went to my Greek Lexicon this
[1:34:35] is a scripture that I've heard for years
[1:34:37] but I've never preached it before and um
[1:34:40] and and like I said when brother Mark
[1:34:41] Struck it in the sermon said okay that's
[1:34:43] my release I got to go and and now I can
[1:34:46] I can preach it it was it was it was it
[1:34:48] was something you know for me that
[1:34:49] Wednesday night and um you know so I
[1:34:52] went started looking at this and I
[1:34:54] wanted to look and see what the
[1:34:55] theologians had to say Let me let me let
[1:34:57] me just I need to just Coast a little
[1:34:59] bit I'm trying to I'm trying to let me
[1:35:02] just look at a couple things here before
[1:35:05] I get yeah all right I think I can I can
[1:35:08] go here all right so I I went to look at
[1:35:11] what theologians said what different
[1:35:12] people might on the internet might have
[1:35:14] had to say about it and then uh I also
[1:35:17] uh just went into a little meditation on
[1:35:20] it myself just just thinking about this
[1:35:22] scripture and um you know when when I
[1:35:26] clicked in the Greek Lexicon like it's
[1:35:29] very
[1:35:30] confusing that it was say the Kingdom of
[1:35:32] Heaven suffereth violence but the
[1:35:35] violent take it by force it seemed a
[1:35:38] little confusing amen but let's just
[1:35:40] look at it and and see if we can get
[1:35:42] some of there when I looked in the Greek
[1:35:44] Lexicon when that that suffereth
[1:35:46] violence it says that it's uh that means
[1:35:50] that they are applying Force to us right
[1:35:53] they're inflicting violence on God's
[1:35:56] people now you can look at there's
[1:35:57] there's so many scriptures where you can
[1:35:59] see go back to Daniel and aliance then
[1:36:02] there was force right the Hebrew boys
[1:36:05] being cast into a man a fire furnace
[1:36:07] they they they suffered Force I mean
[1:36:10] Jesus going to a cross it was it was
[1:36:13] force I mean and and even today we're
[1:36:15] all we all suffer from something amen
[1:36:18] people don't like this Christian Life
[1:36:20] some of y'all been ostracized by your
[1:36:22] families they don't even like when you
[1:36:24] come around they can't wait for you to
[1:36:27] leave that's when they can crank up the
[1:36:29] music that's when they can pull out
[1:36:31] their weed sir that's right right they
[1:36:34] all they drinks that they want to drink
[1:36:36] they hate when you come and and they
[1:36:38] just be under their breath when when she
[1:36:40] going to
[1:36:42] leave your your testimony bring too much
[1:36:46] light in the midst of all that darkness
[1:36:49] and and it used to be a time they
[1:36:50] wouldn't even drink in front of you but
[1:36:52] now they getting more and
[1:36:54] bold Hallelujah if the devil can get
[1:36:59] bold then we as Believers can also get
[1:37:01] bold yes sir let me tell you brother and
[1:37:04] sister I don't care what they situation
[1:37:06] don't let them bring that stuff to your
[1:37:08] house sir when God bless you at that
[1:37:11] house tell them they can't drink there
[1:37:13] and they can't smoke

[1:38:02] something don't don't don't don't fall
[1:38:04] for that see the kingdom of God suffer

[1:38:11] take it by force who are these violent
[1:38:13] in in the in in the Hebrew lexicon it's
[1:38:16] it's the strong the violent ones that

[1:38:49] let me tell you something we know our
[1:38:52] God is is able to deliver us but but but
[1:38:57] we but we we want to be on record King
[1:38:59] that if he
[1:39:02] don't if he don't deliver it's not that
[1:39:05] he
[1:39:08] can't it's just his choice that he
[1:39:10] didn't but we know that our God we ain't
[1:39:13] never seen nobody get delivered from no
[1:39:15] fire we never heard no trial like this
[1:39:18] but we know that our God that we serve
[1:39:21] is more than capable of delivering us
[1:39:25] from your
[1:39:27] fire yes sir I can just see them tell
[1:39:30] that fell he say oh y'all talking you
[1:39:32] don't know you don't know who you
[1:39:33] talking to yeah we know who we talking
[1:39:35] to you ain't nothing but a man well I
[1:39:38] heated it up seven times harder it ain't
[1:39:41] hard enough put it 14 or 15 if you want
[1:39:44] to it ain't hard enough for us and Them
[1:39:47] Boys knew what that God was able to do
[1:39:49] they say but if he don't they were
[1:39:52] forceful they were strong if he don't we
[1:39:54] still not going to bow down to
[1:39:59] you tie these fellas up get my strongest
[1:40:02] men tie them up and and they begin to
[1:40:04] Usher him down into the Fire King didn't
[1:40:07] realize because he heated the fire seven
[1:40:08] times harder it did not affect the
[1:40:11] Hebrew boys but his strong men died
[1:40:14] never even going in the fire just around
[1:40:16] the fire and they
[1:40:17] died
[1:40:19] Lord and when they get inside seven
[1:40:22] times hotter my Lord how could they I
[1:40:24] mean the the they measuring with the
[1:40:26] temperature whatever seven times and
[1:40:28] they get in and these boys just walking
[1:40:30] around and
[1:40:34] manall Lord just in there dancing and
[1:40:39] and and worshiping and praising God and
[1:40:41] King look like what is going on these
[1:40:45] boys should be dead by now and I'm
[1:40:47] telling that's the way the devil feel
[1:40:49] about you you should have been wiped out
[1:40:50] by now how many accidents you done had
[1:40:54] and you done walked away from all of
[1:40:56] them praise God that the devil don't
[1:40:59] realize he can't touch you till God
[1:41:03] says here they are in the fire and just
[1:41:06] dancing and worshiping and pray and he
[1:41:08] said now this is this is UN this is just
[1:41:09] unbeliev they should been dead by now my
[1:41:12] God God looked into the fire and said
[1:41:15] now now I'm having a math problem my
[1:41:18] like my daughter say the math
[1:41:26] I know I can count how many y'all throw
[1:41:29] in there three we know there three three
[1:41:33] Hebrew boys that went in well why when I
[1:41:36] look inside this fire now I need you to
[1:41:39] understand he didn't show up before they
[1:41:42] got in the
[1:41:46] fire he he didn't show up while they
[1:41:48] were standing Amen in front of the king
[1:41:51] he could have yes sir but you understand
[1:41:53] the testimony is greater because he
[1:41:57] showed up in the fire not out the fire
[1:42:02] the testimony get greater because he
[1:42:04] shows up with whatever you going
[1:42:07] through and when he showed up in the
[1:42:10] fire they said now I count four and one
[1:42:13] of them looks like now when did he ever
[1:42:16] see the son of man but one of them look
[1:42:19] like the son of man I don't understand
[1:42:21] what's going on here
[1:42:23] they all come out the fire
[1:42:28] unhinged didn't even Smell Smoke on
[1:42:31] them no
[1:42:33] impact no effect that's when you make
[1:42:36] the devil upset that everything he I'm
[1:42:39] through in your
[1:42:41] direction yes sir you got a
[1:42:45] Hallelujah
[1:42:48] anyhow never never let your problems get
[1:42:51] you down
[1:42:53] whenl problems come your way hold your
[1:42:56] head
[1:42:58] up
[1:43:01] Hallelujah y'all got to understand when
[1:43:04] when a songwriter put something like
[1:43:06] that together they said I'm going
[1:43:08] through a lot but
[1:43:15] Hallelujah the strong forceful resilient
[1:43:20] these are the violent right now I was uh
[1:43:24] looking at something because the
[1:43:25] theologians as I was looking through
[1:43:27] they they just not in Harmony on the
[1:43:29] definition of the scripture that we're
[1:43:31] referring to in Matthew uh 11 and and 12
[1:43:35] now I'm going to say a couple things I
[1:43:37] read verse 11 for a reason because I do
[1:43:40] want to read a quote for that verse 11
[1:43:42] it said verily I say unto you among them
[1:43:45] that are born of
[1:43:47] women they're not risen or greater than
[1:43:50] John the Baptist
[1:43:52] notwithstanding he that is least in the
[1:43:54] Kingdom of Heaven is greater than
[1:43:58] he so uh thank you my
[1:44:03] brother it is
[1:44:07] Florida uh but I I did find a a
[1:44:09] gentleman that was that wrote something
[1:44:11] in a in a website daily word for all
[1:44:13] about this scripture that I I like one
[1:44:15] of the statements that he made and it
[1:44:17] says uh in Matthew 11:12 says and from
[1:44:19] the days of John the Baptist until now
[1:44:21] the kingdom of God
[1:44:23] suffer violence and the violent take it
[1:44:25] by force the Bible verse records the
[1:44:28] violent take it by force it means that
[1:44:31] entering God's kingdom takes
[1:44:33] courage it's takes unwavering faith it
[1:44:36] takes determination and it takes
[1:44:40] endurance see weeping may endure for
[1:44:42] night but joy going to come in the
[1:44:44] morning you got to endure through the
[1:44:45] night sometimes right it says
[1:44:47] determination and endurance and it says
[1:44:49] examples in the Bible that illustrates
[1:44:51] the meaning of this verse Jacob held God
[1:44:55] tightly and forcefully saying I will not
[1:44:59] let you go unless you bless me and he
[1:45:02] got his Blessing right j j j i mean J no
[1:45:06] I got to use some Force here I'm not
[1:45:08] going to Turn You Loose you going have
[1:45:10] to do something for me before I let you

[1:46:50] and turned and walked away but had no
[1:46:52] IDE idea that it was going to stop the

[1:47:42] willingness your eagerness that has made
[1:47:45] you whole and no longer you going to
[1:47:47] have to deal with that condition You'
[1:47:49] been made whole from this time for that
[1:47:52] lady got her healing because she was
[1:47:54] willing to be
[1:47:56] violent yes sir she was willing to be
[1:47:58] forceful yes
[1:48:04] sir another example that they gave is
[1:48:07] even blind barus was asked to keep quiet
[1:48:11] but he refused crying out the more Jesus
[1:48:14] thou son of David have mercy on me see
[1:48:17] the violent take it by
[1:48:20] force he took his healing
[1:48:24] everybody saying man hush he can't hear
[1:48:25] you louder and louder he
[1:48:28] got his faith get louder sir and that
[1:48:31] was the last miracle that Jesus was
[1:48:33] going to perform before he went to the
[1:48:35] Cross amen hallelujah we don't know when
[1:48:38] our last moment going to be let's take
[1:48:41] advantage of every moment we have here
[1:48:43] you know uh I I looked in the emphatic
[1:48:46] diglot and let's bring up uh verse 11
[1:48:48] and 12 again there on the screen Matthew
[1:48:50] 11 uh 11 and 12 uh you can read on the
[1:48:53] screen but I'm going to read it amen out
[1:48:55] of the emphatic diaglot it says
[1:48:59] indeed I say to you among those born of
[1:49:02] women there has not risen a
[1:49:06] greater than John the bapt John the
[1:49:09] immerser and because baptism is by
[1:49:12] immersion it's not sprinkling baptism
[1:49:15] has to be by
[1:49:16] immersion and and and it's just like
[1:49:19] Jesus went into the heart of Earth for 3
[1:49:20] days you go into that water for 3
[1:49:22] seconds
[1:49:23] Jesus rose to New Life when you rise
[1:49:25] from the water you rise in a new life
[1:49:27] yes sir and you start walking in new
[1:49:29] life amen amen
[1:49:32] amen great and John Johnny merer yet the
[1:49:36] least in the Kingdom of Heaven is
[1:49:37] superior to him then the next verse says
[1:49:41] and from the days of John the immerser
[1:49:43] till now the Kingdom of Heaven has been
[1:49:46] forcibly
[1:49:47] assell and the violent sees it so you
[1:49:51] know when I looked at that word a
[1:49:54] sell the the kingdom of God has been
[1:49:56] forcefully saell it means the kingdom of
[1:49:58] God has been attacked or strongly
[1:50:03] criticized the kingdom of God has been
[1:50:07] strongly
[1:50:08] criticized well I think we live in a
[1:50:11] time period where we have seen the
[1:50:13] kingdom of God strongly
[1:50:18] criticized forcibly a sell but but but
[1:50:21] here's the thing hey
[1:50:23] amen the violent sees it the violent
[1:50:27] take it by force that mean we ain't got
[1:50:29] to take everything people
[1:50:31] say
[1:50:33] amen sometimes you get to a point where
[1:50:36] that's
[1:50:38] enough glory to God you done said enough
[1:50:41] now it's time for me to
[1:50:44] speak all right but we done been attack
[1:50:47] on every hand amen and you know all kind
[1:50:49] of stuff out there about this message I
[1:50:51] I and it only
[1:50:53] well it only came out in the fourth
[1:50:55] generation it only came out then this
[1:50:57] did not happen years ago it there was a
[1:50:59] spirit that was released in this day sir
[1:51:02] and you got to understand that same
[1:51:04] Spirit happened way back in in Moses day
[1:51:06] when they came to the fourth generation
[1:51:08] they got to a spot where they did not
[1:51:09] even know who God
[1:51:11] was they didn't even know who God was I
[1:51:14] mean the thing the things they saw in
[1:51:15] the days of Moses in the days of Joshua
[1:51:18] it was all past tense but they didn't
[1:51:20] know that he was the same yesterday
[1:51:21] today and forever right right but we see
[1:51:23] that same Spirit released today young
[1:51:26] people watch it don't sir look if you

[1:54:06] going to be sitting here and the place
[1:54:08] going to be canceled and this going to
[1:54:10] happen that you think you think God that
[1:54:13] that's that small that he would also
[1:54:15] show this man the revelation of the
[1:54:19] word come on no you that
[1:54:23] God ain't that
[1:54:24] small your mind is that small your
[1:54:27] thinking is that small your flesh is
[1:54:30] that small yes sir amen but not the God
[1:54:34] we serve this message has been
[1:54:36] thoroughly
[1:54:38] Vindicated God himself Vindicated it we
[1:54:42] ain't got to vindicate no message it's
[1:54:43] already
[1:54:45] Vindicated right brother brandom say
[1:54:47] look I tell you what I God already told
[1:54:48] me y'all had a trap set before me any
[1:54:51] brother
[1:54:53] just just bring this yeah bring this
[1:54:57] bring your Bible this is why we can say
[1:54:59] to you the message that we believe comes
[1:55:03] from
[1:55:05] this we can show it to you here right
[1:55:10] amen
[1:55:12] amen
[1:55:13] now use this to disprove
[1:55:17] it I'mma go back to my scriptures now
[1:55:21] don't make me go back cuz I I I I we're
[1:55:23] suffering violent but now a violent
[1:55:24] getting ready to take it by
[1:55:27] force Jesus
[1:55:29] said that Elijah was coming uhuh and he
[1:55:33] restore all things yes
[1:55:36] sir but I say to you Elijah is already
[1:55:39] come and they did them what whatever
[1:55:41] they they desired that's what Jesus said
[1:55:45] and then the disciples
[1:55:46] understood he was talking of John the
[1:55:49] Baptist understood which one one was
[1:55:53] John the
[1:55:54] Baptist because Jesus spoke of two
[1:55:56] different Elijah one that would come and
[1:55:59] restore yes sir and then uh what's that
[1:56:03] act say uh to the restitution of all
[1:56:05] things John the Baptist is already gone
[1:56:07] right sir so all things were still
[1:56:09] coming yes sir so John I mean here the
[1:56:12] scripture said the restitution of all
[1:56:13] things it didn't happen in John the
[1:56:14] Baptist day this happened after Christ
[1:56:17] true so there's another message that
[1:56:19] comes after Christ according to the
[1:56:21] Bible right amen so now if you going to
[1:56:24] tell me John the Baptist was the one
[1:56:25] that fulfilled that Matthew scripture
[1:56:27] you know my question what that John the
[1:56:32] Baptist restore and if you ain't got no
[1:56:35] answer your Doctrine is false yes sir
[1:56:39] exactly right the kingdom of God has
[1:56:42] been suffering violence but the violent
[1:56:44] today are taking it by force yes sir
[1:56:47] your Doctrine is false and you need to
[1:56:49] repent of that Spirit yes sir evil
[1:56:52] Spirit yes sir
[1:56:55] [Music]
[1:56:57] amen let me read a quote real quick and
[1:57:00] I I'm I'm I forgot to start my time so I
[1:57:03] know I'm a little
[1:57:04] overtime but that's okay CU that there's
[1:57:07] more to
[1:57:08] this let me read a quote out of
[1:57:13] influence the scripture
[1:57:17] said there had not been one greater than
[1:57:21] John the Baptist
[1:57:26] but the least in the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:57:27] is superior to
[1:57:29] him look at this in the message
[1:57:31] influence brother random says what did
[1:57:34] John the Baptist
[1:57:36] do the man that Jesus
[1:57:39] said there was
[1:57:42] never a man born of woman like
[1:57:45] him or could compare with him
[1:57:58] there's no one can compare to him until
[1:58:01] that
[1:58:03] time now I I'll just give it away real
[1:58:07] quick so you a got to be too you got to
[1:58:09] try to let just blow your mind why was
[1:58:12] John the
[1:58:13] Baptist acknowledged by Jesus that there
[1:58:16] was none born among women that was like
[1:58:20] him why because John had the specific
[1:58:26] responsibility of
[1:58:29] introducing Christ at his first coming
[1:58:32] now Jesus says there is another one
[1:58:35] where the spirit of Elijah is going to
[1:58:36] come and restore all things so until
[1:58:39] that time there was not one born like
[1:58:42] John the Baptist nobody that could
[1:58:44] compare until that
[1:58:47] time right now we're dealing with the
[1:58:50] second coming of the Lord
[1:58:52] and as John the Baptist the angel said
[1:58:56] as John the Baptist amen was sent his
[1:58:58] message was ident was to identify the
[1:59:02] first coming he was the Forerunner of
[1:59:03] the first coming of Christ your message
[1:59:07] will forerun the second coming of
[1:59:11] Christ so now we have a prophet that
[1:59:14] could be
[1:59:17] compared to John the
[1:59:20] Baptist ooh
[1:59:24] because his ministry according to the
[1:59:27] angel is to allow him to
[1:59:30] introduce Christ
[1:59:35] sir we not following something blind we
[1:59:38] know exactly where we are and we're not
[1:59:40] just serving a god of History our God is
[1:59:43] the same yesterday today and forever let
[1:59:45] me finish reading this all right what
[1:59:49] did John the Baptist do the man that
[1:59:52] that Jesus said there was never a man
[1:59:53] born of a woman like him or could
[1:59:55] compare with him until that time the
[1:59:58] great prophet ordained of God before the
[2:00:00] foundational World spoke of 127 years
[2:00:02] before he ever come on or 712 years
[2:00:05] rather before he came to the Earth by
[2:00:07] the prophet Isaiah here what did he do
[2:00:11] when he seen a man come walking down out
[2:00:15] of the audience amen and he looked up
[2:00:19] above and saw that fire coming down from
[2:00:22] heaven in the form of a dove he cried
[2:00:24] out I have need to be baptized Of Thee I
[2:00:29] must decrease he must increase God can't
[2:00:33] have two on the earth at the same time
[2:00:36] only one has the message you know I must
[2:00:39] decrease he is the messenger I've been
[2:00:42] up to this time now he takes my place as
[2:00:46] Elisha when Elijah went up and throw
[2:00:50] back his robe to Elisha his ministry was
[2:00:53] finished Elisha must take up where he
[2:00:56] left off he must increase I must
[2:00:59] decrease John the Baptist there was a
[2:01:02] lot
[2:01:04] said in that
[2:01:06] quote the types that he gave Sir were a
[2:01:10] little different than what we were
[2:01:11] expecting because the increase and
[2:01:13] decrease that John was talking about he
[2:01:15] was talking about
[2:01:18] Christ I must decrease so Christ can
[2:01:22] increased brother brandom did the same
[2:01:23] thing he decreased Christ increased but
[2:01:26] in this quote he showed he said like
[2:01:28] Elisha and
[2:01:30] Elijah well who is Elijah Elijah is the
[2:01:34] prophet that brings the word and
[2:01:36] restores us even in the book of Kings
[2:01:39] Elijah was the one that restored the
[2:01:42] worship they were worshiping Idol gods
[2:01:45] and then he had to go in the office with
[2:01:46] him and say uh choose you this day whom
[2:01:48] you going to the god that answer by fire
[2:01:50] let him be God he said let that God be
[2:01:53] God said we tired of this bail thing
[2:01:54] going on let he got bold yes sir right
[2:01:58] he said now let let let let that let the
[2:02:00] god that answer by fire be God get your
[2:02:02] altars all set up and when when they got
[2:02:04] the altar set up he said you know what
[2:02:06] man they went all day long cutting
[2:02:08] themselves and doing all kind of crazy
[2:02:09] things trying to get their God to
[2:02:11] respond they bleeding all all he said
[2:02:12] y'all just get back all y'all just stand
[2:02:15] to the side and he and he he say he said
[2:02:17] now Lord I come here according to your
[2:02:19] word let them see that restoration is
[2:02:22] coming through this ministry amen yes
[2:02:24] sir he said Lord send your fire down
[2:02:27] I've done everything I prepared the
[2:02:28] altar the way amen that you want to
[2:02:29] prepared now let the fire come down and
[2:02:31] fire came down and consumed everything
[2:02:34] not just Elijah's aler alar but also the
[2:02:37] altar Bell consumed everything proving
[2:02:40] that God was God sir Amen brother random
[2:02:43] say now that that spirit that was on
[2:02:46] Elijah falls on
[2:02:49] Elisha Elisha types
[2:02:55] can I mean let me let me make it very
[2:02:57] clear Elisha does not type
[2:03:05] Jesus Elijah was the first prophet that
[2:03:08] came but then he his anointing
[2:03:11] settled on
[2:03:13] Elisha and Elisha does not type
[2:03:17] Jesus
[2:03:19] Elisha types
[2:03:25] you you are the
[2:03:28] Elisha we had an Elijah but now we're
[2:03:31] looking for
[2:03:35] Elija and Elisha carries a double
[2:03:43] anointing you think if I got a double
[2:03:45] anointing I'm going to run from Devils
[2:03:49] no I'm going on the offense
[2:03:52] I got I got twice as much
