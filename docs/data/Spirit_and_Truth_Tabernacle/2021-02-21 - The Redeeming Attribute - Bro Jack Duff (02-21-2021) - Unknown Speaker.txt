god for all the uh our couples that were able to come out on yesterday we had a wonderful time of fellowship and uh now we want to turn to trying to do something for the whole church um just my desire for us to maybe do a picnic or something like that so i will keep you all posted and give you a date a man and uh but we just want to have some fellowship we're going to be intentional about sticking together amen uh this year the devil just you know come to try to divide us and just you know that that's that's ain't number the devil for the devil you know and um i'm i'm looking forward to a place that we can go in got to worry about no more viruses uh we gotta worry about you know getting sick no more that day is coming it's coming soon so i'm under expectation for amen but uh but we do appreciate everyone coming out and being a part of that on yesterday um i'm turning here to psalms 107. i believe uh brother solomon was reading from 106 is that right uh so sometimes as a minister you're looking for just little things that would help solidify you going in the right direction uh because this is the sermon that i want to bring to you today is something that i was i was trying to push it just you know just no i'm not no no no lord no and i come to find out that every time i fight god he always win so i say lord okay i'ma just i'ma just yield and i'm gonna just let you have the preeminence we we find sometimes that god's thoughts and not like our thoughts and his ways are not like our ways and i just felt like this sermon challenged me amen and just my thinking about certain things and you know it's okay amen we need to be challenged and uh my prayer uh this morning is that if revelation is beyond us that we will look up and ask god for it amen so let's read here in this uh psalms 107 and uh it states to us uh oh give thanks the lord praise god for he is good amen god's been good to me for his mercy endureth forever praise the name of the lord and then uh the next verse uh tells us here uh let the redeemed of the lord say so whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy amen amen the lord of the blessing to reading of his word shall we pray amen father we are uh grateful for the reading of the word but we know the holy spirit wants to speak something to us this morning so god as it was just stated revelations beyond us help us to look up and just ask you for it and that's exactly what we do now um your prophet has shared some things with us things that we can fellowship around and god and um just the way that he brought the word it challenges everybody's thinking uh denominations are challenged and and everybody else uh almost like uh when you came and you stood on the uh on the face of this earth and you just made a statement that shook a church it said unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part with me and you did it and didn't explain it uh god you uh you you allowed your prophet to say certain things lord and i just prayed it as we would just enter into some of these things that he said that you would help us lord to catch what he was trying to tell us and uh lord we know uh you he was vindicated we know he was elected he was chosen he was predestinated according to scripture to come and speak certain things to us the lord as we just try to endeavor upon this thought lord use it for your glory hide us all behind the cross that we might not be seeing but may christ be on display today it's in jesus name we pray amen and amen god bless you you can be seated in the presence of the lord amen um you all know that i have been um on this journey of uh the junctions we wanted to we still have a a few more junctions that we want to preach you know brother branham talked about seven junctions and we just the lord just been leading me to just take each junction and to bring that you know to the church uh but this morning we have what i would call uh interruption in the series amen amen just a little interruption uh in the series and and i didn't even i forgot to bring a particular quote that i that i read um but um nonetheless i think it'll be something that would be very very helpful for us uh i forgot i see orion there good to see you uh brother ryan god bless you amen um i want to just take the subject the redeeming attribute amen the redeeming attribute and um just a couple things that we want to start off here with and i'll start with the sermon identify christ of all ages here the prophet makes the statement now god is is a great like a great being in the beginning god see he wasn't even god uh to begin with god is an object of worship and he was called there was nothing to worship he was self-existent elohim and there wasn't nothing to worship him when he created angels then there was something to worship him a man but in this great god uh elohim was attributes uh there was attributes in there to be god now just catch that right he wasn't god but because he had nothing to worship him but there were attributes in him to be god amen in order to become god then he had to create something to worship him and there's where the angels come in all right so he says uh uh the there was attributes in there to be god attributes to be father attributes to be son all right it says in attributes to be savior attributes to be healer all these attributes was in god and if you've ever got eternal life you were in god's attributes amen because you got eternal life jesus came as redeemer and redeemed means bring it back to where it started from oh glory to god bring it back to where it started from right you were in god's thinking he might have had to breathe this with that and down here and down here you know and and i'll just leave it right there uh but uh but you know he's we were in god's thinking jesus came to redeem and bring us back to a specific place hallelujah church amen now i want to just uh uh maybe we'll go up a little further here another quote here uh the fundamental foundation for faith amen we want to just try to lay a background uh here for what we want to say this redeeming attribute uh he says man was made as a secondary god on earth he was given the power to control all things so this is something that he's bringing us back to to be able to control all things all elements of the earth that was adam adam was given these great powers but then the power that he was given to make himself is where he oh my amen the power that adam was given to make himself is where he failed says and adam could speak to the winds and it would stop he could speak to the trees and they would obey him he could speak to the wildlife it would obey him he could speak to the waters ever what it is everything obeyed adam no struggle at all everything obeyed him says now that is the beginning of man uh that's what god that's what god give him power over everything on the earth now through the fall he lost that power then he becomes unconscious of the fact after losing his relationship and friendship fellowship with the father then he lost that and all of his great channels become clogged up and he couldn't get through hallelujah this is where we have been for a number of years uh all clogged up and we need to get through amen i pray that the holy ghost amen will become a plumber of this morning amen brother and get the clog out a spiritual plumber we need to get some clogs out hey hallelujah amen says uh uh because you got eternal life uh i'm sorry i'm in the wrong he says um uh i've become unconscious of the fact after losing his relationship fellowship with the father then he lost that and all of his great channels become clogged up and he couldn't get through now what adam was in god what adam was in god christ these are this is a past tense thing that we're talking about here christ has redeemed us back to that says now a redeemer to redeem anything is to bring it back to its origin again hallelujah now i i want you to just try to stay with me here you know we said that there were attributes in god now you know i don't believe that those uh attributes just stayed in god by us becoming sons and daughters of god some of those attributes are actually inside of us hallelujah you know the attribute to be father every young man wants to find himself a wife so he can also become father come on praise the lord every young lady is looking for a husband so she can become mother amen these things are already inside of us when we are born these these attributes if i can just call them these genes that was inside of god they're now laying inside of us bless it be the name of the lord hallelujah amen i think this is why we have uh uh we get a certain feeling or emotion for somebody when they get sick amen we want to actually see them made well amen we'll put in a prayer request because we want to see them made well we'll actually go and lay hands on them hallelujah because we realize if we lay hands on the sick come on somebody [Applause] you know the bible say just lay hands on the sick and they will recover and what the prophet said it said it didn't say pray [Music] when when we talking about that scripture it actually did not say pray it said lay hands well if you lay hands on the sick and they recover who's healing who's doing the healing is god inside of you doing the healing if you're a sinner you can't lay hands on nobody but if your holy ghost feel believable hallelujah all authority that's in heaven is now inside of you i didn't bring the quote but i have it brother branham said you know i say that the same um he said that same god that stood out on the invisible platform and said let there be light and there was life he said that same god that creative power is laying and sitting inside those that are filled with the holy ghost so you got creative power in you that's an attribute of god hallelujah right amen you have that attribute to want to be a father i want to be a mother oh my there's so many other attributes that were in god that are now inside of us let's look at this amen a little bit more i want to talk about this redemption this redemptive attribute amen that the redeeming attribute now uh just um let me give you a couple definitions on this redemption praise the lord amen redemption means deliverance by payment of a price salvation from sin death and the wrath of god by christ's sacrifice amen and also in the old testament redemption was applied to property it was applied to animals it was applied to persons and the nation of israel as a whole in nearly every instance freedom from obligation freedom from bondage freedom from danger i mean or danger was secured by the payment of a price also it was a ransom a bribe a satisfaction a sum of money paid to obtain freedom favor or reconciliation all right in the new testament when uh redemption is kind of emphasized it's talking about the tremendous cost that christ had to pay on the cross amen for our sins amen this is this is all a part of redemption let me let me let me make that very clear see i want to i want to uh say i'm picking up a diamond this morning i'm picking up this diamond of redemption and uh and when you pick up the diamond just depending on how you shine it uh uh in the sun depending on what angle it hits it'll it'll reflect a different sparkle glory to god so one of the sparkles that i could give you is the sparkle of what christ did for us glory to god amen another spark i could give you is what happened in the old testament glory to god before christ died on the cross i can give you that sparkle so so this morning we just hope that the lord will just help us see something here in some of the quotes that i want to provide all right let's go here's uh here's uh something that just shook me this week to my core amen glory glory glory are you ready for this amen i was just kind of sharing something on the on the phone on a little fellowship call that i do in the morning and one of the brothers uh commented after i had uh talked that morning we were actually uh talking about revelation chapter four and uh and some things that you know that i was bringing out there and uh and after after the after the uh the conversation after the the little fellowship the brother said you know uh brother's just something how you know we were talking about the uh the speckled birds amen and the great speckled bird and brother branham talked about how in leviticus that they took one bird and they killed them and then they put the blood on the living bird they took two one was killed and then they put the blood on the living one and it says and that was christ dying but then the living bird was us as the bride and we were going across the earth fluttering our wings with the blood of the dead bird on us because brother branham said the the bride has become the blood of jesus see uh these are statements these are statements that uh that challenge our thinking he said the bride is the blood of the lord jesus so i had to go back to the scripture to identify how did the bride become the blood and brother branham's shoulder say say it was that it was that that that that that that that that the dead uh the blood of the dead bird was sprinkled onto you know the the living bird and that living bird had to go out through the earth just fluttering his wings crying holy holy holy unto the lord and that's how that that that that bird became the blood all right all right so you know we were fellowshipping around that and brothers say you know there's just that just really struck me brother jack and this just kind of helped add to you know just a little quote that i was looking at and this is how god's gifts always find their places now i love the title i love the title god's gifts always finds their places now this is deeper than just finding your place in church this is finding your place in christ recognizing who you are right so so now watch this statement amen that that is made here in this sermon brother random says mary the mother of jesus in the city of nazareth the meanest city there was in the land but out of there god chose a little lady to give birth to his son an incubator a womb he says there had to be a baby had to be born by he took such a person to it now understand this the reason that god god uh uh because of what adam lost in the beginning hallelujah take that down just for a second because of what adam lost in the beginning amen i i want to i want to say this the right way uh adam adam couldn't bring eve back to the place that she fell from redemption is to bring back right now adam could not bring eve back to where she fell from hallelujah this is why we needed a kissman redeemer christ to bring us back to where mankind actually fell from hallelujah we realized the importance of needing jesus in order to bring us back to what was lost in the garden everything adam lost jesus restored hallelujah hallelujah now i i i want us to be uh on the same page with that we realized that but but we have to we have to look at all the scripture you understand we just can't stop at that because we've heard the story of redemption for a long time and that's real good what jesus did was perfect but he restored us back to everything that adam lost everything now let's let's go a little further in this quote hallelujah this will challenge you i'm gonna read it again mary the mother of jesus in the city of natural the meanest city there was in the land but out of there god chose a little lady to give birth to his son an incubator a womb that had a baby that had to be born by he took such a person to do it god works through human beings to reading human beings i want to say that again god works through human beings that's plural plural right to redeem human beings that makes you a part of the redemption process hallelujah now look at what the prophet said says he can take you work through you to redeem humanity [Music] now i could just read this and just go right over the top of it just act like it wasn't even there but i got to slow down on that right i wait a minute you say god can take me now he started to court off by saying how mary had come from the meanest city right and you would look at mary and think now how could god use a woman like this from this mean city to work the process of redemption and what you got to do is start looking at where god brought you from where did god lift you up out of what city did you come from what kind of family background did you have in order to bring you to where you are right now i'm telling you here because the grace of god has brought you here hallelujah glory to god and and and and i'm gonna just read the rest of this quote but i'm gonna tell you i'm gonna get a little ahead of myself god wants to take you from the environment that you came from clean you up change your life turn you all around to send you back into that environment to bring somebody out and then god is working through a human being to bring redemption that's the same thing he did with christ now you won't be going to no cross you won't be going to no cross you're not going to do it like that hallelujah but redemption comes to what we say out of our mouth [Music] that's why i say let it redeem of the lord can we just read a little bit more god wants god works through human beings to redeem human beings he can take you work through you to redeem humanity if you'll completely dedicate everything you are let's go on if you're a young woman dedicate your morals hallelujah through the way that you live sis through the way that you live my brother you're bringing somebody to the cross you're not doing the work yourself but they'll they'll get to the cross through your life right it says if your young woman dedicate your morals you're a young man dedicate your morals dedicate your mind hallelujah oh hallelujah dedicate your thinking dedicate your heart dedicate your soul dedicate all you are he says and let christ work through that what a glorious thing got some rivers across you got the bridges to go over you got you got the brian practice you got the thickets you got the woods you got the dark places you got the high heels you got the high climbs what uh what are you what are you doing someday you'll have to stand and look back see where you come from and you're going to be judged by the course you take your all your mind and your thoughts on that north star the sin of god and don't move from it stay right with it it'll bring you straight like that amen like it did the magi right straight to christ i just love this statement it challenged me when i read it this week god works through human beings to redeem human beings god works through human beings to redeem human beings that tells me that there's an attribute of redemption that is laying inside of the believer all right let's go on a little further here now i think it's good for us to understand who we are now this this this let me just also make this very clear uh i'm gonna read this quote i'm gonna read this quote out of that day on calvary i'm gonna read this now when i read this i'm just setting you up i'm letting you know ahead of time it's gonna actually sound like it's contradicting what i just said hallelujah but i want to bring both sides of it i'm trying to walk right down the middle of this amen i'm trying to walk right down the middle you know um we got to understand our place do you know as the bride of christ because you overcome in the age of laodicea do you realize what your reward is you actually sit in the same throne as christ as an overcomer you sit in the exact same throne as christ hallelujah i was you know listening to brother jason watkins uh make a statement he says when we look at the story of esther when she revealed what heyman was getting ready to do she was giving a man uh a reward the reward by the king said i'll give you up to half of my kingdom he said that wasn't just a physical thing he said that was pretty much said i'm gonna share my throne with you if you got control of half of the kingdom that means what you say is just as good as what i say hallelujah all right let's go on a little further listen i'm in paragraph 47 on that day on calvary look at this now let me just let me preface this by saying this this this this uh this attribute of redemption you can only express it as you have as you have a relationship with christ just because you human don't give you nothing but it's through a relationship with christ that brings you back to everything adam lost all right let's let's read this hallelujah it says and when sin struck the earth back in the beginning adam and eve states all right like a sheet of blackness fallen from the heaven it literally paralyzed the earth it throwed every creature on the earth and all of god's creation in bondage man was under bondage of death so we gotta understand what adam and eve did it caused us to lose all of this hallelujah amen we needed a kissman redeemer that's why christ had to go to a cross and i'm gonna tell you since christ went to the cross now we can preach sermons like this hallelujah glory to god because he brings us back to a specific place all right stay with me says uh he throwed every creature on earth and all of god's creation in bondage man was on the bondage of death sickness trouble sorrows all nature fell with him sin was a anesthetic that actually paralyzed the earth and then we set we sat here hopeless because every creature on earth was subject to it and everyone born on earth was subject to it so it had to come from some place where there was no sin it could not come from the earth hallelujah in order for us to get to this place it couldn't come from the earth god had to come himself and restore us back to this so it's only through the blood that you can express these attributes of redemption he says one of us could not redeem the other that's why i was saying now adam could not take eve and put her back in her place once she fell from it he couldn't take it like that she had fallen from a place in christ adam when he fell in the garden he couldn't redeem himself he needed christ to come the second adam in order for mankind to get back to that place now let's try to put this let's try to balance this hallelujah hallelujah let's call him readers says therefore says when man realized that he was separated from his god he became a wanderer they wept they cried they tore they wandered about uh through the mountains and through the desert seeking a city whose building maker was god for he knew that if he ever got back in the presence of god he could talk it over with him amen but there was no way back we're talking about at the beginning glory to god he becomes lost he didn't know which way to turn so he just took out wandering trying to find somewhere that he could find a way back to that place amen something on the inside of him told him that he come from a place that was perfect now you know this is what brother branham's saying now now i'm reading in the statement that he mentioned that is one of us couldn't redeem the other but the quote before amen he says human beings god works through human beings to redeem human beings we gotta find balance to this we gotta find balance now i to go forward in this message that day on calvary paragraph 84 hallelujah look at what he says in the same sermon glory to god church he says he was just one man the perfect man he gave his life and he made an example he made an example for you and he says now what must we do now the first thing i want to say jesus never lived for himself his life was spent for others amen that's perfectly eternal life he says when you say you got when you say you go to church and you do good things that's fine he says but when you live your life for yourself you have an eternal life eternal life is living for others let's go a little further it proved it when it come in the lamb of god he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself he lived for others and you receive eternal life by receiving that day and you don't live for yourself the more you live for others oh let me let me just let me just inject something and hold on just put that down just for a second you know um you know i was listening uh brother eugene braun he kept bringing out this point this week when uh abraham paid tithes when abraham paid tithes amen to melchizedek hallelujah when he met melchizedek and he paid tithes he says uh the ties was actually the bible say that that that affected four generations all the way down to levi it was as if levi was paying ties god was receiving it all the way down to four generations i want you to get this what you do hallelujah whether it's good or bad what you do right now will affect four generations so i i advise you to choose to do right your tithing right now will cause four generations of your family to be blessed and they don't even realize they're being blessed [Applause] hallelujah somebody right we gotta understand what what you know what an impact we make by the decisions that we we actually make amen hallelujah your faithfulness to god impacts four generations remember my grandmother used to tell me i'm i'm praying for my children i'm praying for my grandchildren i'm praying for my great-grandchildren and i forget how many generations my grandma lived to see all because she decided to pray one day for her children hallelujah praying for their salvation hallelujah and we are standing here today on grandmama's prayer can i put it this way grandma had a pro a part of the process of the redemption [Applause] all right all right i'm going a little further in this quote i'm going further amen see what you live your life yourself you have an eternal life eternal life is living for others now look at what he says he said someone said how can you stand and let anybody call you such bad names just take it down again because i i got to make sure these points come home you want to know why you in certain situations how come this person's coming against you here on the job and this one don't like you here and that one don't like you and then and then rather than you quit you stand there and take it all right come on hallelujah somebody i mean because you know as believers we got to be able to endure something you got to have something to overcome and let me tell you can't pick your trials you can't pick and choose the trout right you know i always tell a little story about the man that that had to carry across right you know we all got to carry across right so this man had a cross and he was complaining to the lord of how heavy this cross was lord is too heavy for me to carry out i can't do this no more lord said okay i'll tell you what come into this room you say you can drop off that cross it says but go back out after you drop it off because you're going to go back in another room and you're going to pick up a cross everybody has to carry a cross you say i get it lord everybody got to carry across but i just can't take this one so he put it down he said come on out the room now come on through this door go find yourself a cross he looked and he saw a real big car they said i don't know who got the carry that but i ain't carrying that one right now he's like oh look at that man that one right there oh hey oh lord have mercy ain't no way i'm carrying that he said he saw a real small cross in the corner and he went to the little small cross and and picked it up say lord i'll take this one what that god say that's the same one you just put down hallelujah church see sometimes it's just our vision is a little blurry it's the way we're looking at things and that's why we respond the way that we respond because we're looking at it the wrong way hallelujah amen glory to god but sometimes you need to understand why you're going through what you're going through why were you placed on that job [Music] why when you could when nobody else would even open up a door for you to get an interview and then god opened up the door for you to get that specific job you remember when you gave the testimony you were so happy about being there but then you started going through trials and you was ready to quit and some of us did quit come on somebody i got a quote for you this morning i need you to understand it's greater than what you're going through on the job it's greater than that [Music] hallelujah hallelujah somebody was sharing a testimony with me and i don't know if it's a direct quote or anything but they were saying how this uh this man had uh come to church one sunday and say uh you know i um i i want to give my heart to the lord i want to be a christian so the pastor uh the pastor said okay well you know what what sermon did i preach that made you want to be a christian saying i passed that you preached some good sermons but sorry one sermon that you preached that made me want to be a christian say uh say what what um what uh uh what choir what's something that the choir sings say you know the choir song some real good songs but it won the songs that they saying that made me want to be a christian so well what is that make you want to be a christian say it's this guy on my job and i was just watching the way that he handled himself through every situation every circumstance he said i knew that there was something different about his life than mine and i wanted that same thing that he had all right amen you're there for a reason your place there for a purpose glory see god god god god wants to uh uh use human beings to redeem human beings see if you can look at it from a higher level yes sir amen it'll keep you steady yeah yeah glory to god when things get a little rocky you ain't got to get up and run too fast just hold steady god god got something that he's doing hallelujah god wants to use human beings to redeem human beings can i tell you something i mean somebody some of your co-workers will never go to church they'll know never know anything about christ and the reason they know a little bit that god can judge them is because you're living i mean you're working there can i put it this way god gonna bring some people to truth because you work in there they will never stream the service hallelujah they'll never listen to a tank they'll never pick up their bible and read but you have become a liberty pistol read by all men you become the tape you become the message hallelujah you become the bible you become redemption glory to god let me finish reading this quote glory hallelujah it says you said someone said how can you stand and let anybody call you such bad names you don't live for yourself you live for others and you want to know why you live others you live for others that you might redeem that man amen so you got a part of this there's an attribute of god that must be reflected inside of you you don't live for yourself you live for others that you might redeem that man you become sons and the trouble of it is the church has begot they were sons i'm going to look i told you this is in the same message that day on calvary in the same message he says you become son the church has forgot that they were sons you are sons you are taking christ's place amen amen that's what i said brother jose when i read it it challenged me i said but the prophet said in god amen say i'm not gonna run from this sermon i'ma preach it i got to be this you are sons you're taking christ's place you're a son so you don't live for yourself live for others amen that means you got to die to yourself just like christ died on the cross praise god you have the sacrifice you got not my will but your will be done because see you're not you're not just showing up on a job just to get a paycheck that's just part of it but you're showing up there because somebody needs redemption and god uses human beings to redeem human beings i i i want this to just get heavy on the church i want i want i want you to feel the weight of what the prophet is saying to us god uses human beings to redeem human beings let me go on let me go on um and he says in this this quote just going to it says it says well brother branham i can live for this brother because he sure is a nice man that's not it amen live for that man who hates you live for that man who hates you live for the person who killed you if they could amen that's what they've done to him see you taking christ's place so what you saw happen in the life of christ should also be happening in your life that's how you know you're a christian live for the person who killed you if they could that's what they've done to him they killed him and he died that he might save them that's eternal life when you get that and when you get it that's in your bosom you are facing heaven then says but you sacrifice your own things give them up like the sheep gives its wool you look on towards calvary i just i i have to just drop this in the church let me just go on a little further amen amen amen amen here out of the message the king's been redeemed i met paragraph 168 in this sermon now we'll we'll just we'll talk a little bit more i drop some quotes and then i'll just give you a couple examples and i'll be done at least it'll be off my shoulders this was something i was carrying for days and just could not get it i couldn't shake it so i got to read these quotes look at this the prophet says this in the kinsmen redeemer it says now sons and daughters because your sons and daughters sons and daughters who has the most power before god right what is an angel an angel's a servant is that right they're his servants what are you his son and daughter he says who has the most power in heaven then now i need you to understand you are living on earth but the quote is saying you actually have power in heaven now if you have power in heaven don't you also think you have power in earth amen and what you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and what you lose on earth will be loosed in heaven says he says this que he asks a question who has the most power in heaven then a sinner that's been saved by grace or an archangel that's standing by his right side he says the sinner that's been saved by grace has more authority in heaven than the archangel that stood by sight without sin [Music] because he's a son and a son has more authority than a servant of course oh we forget what we are we forget many times what made us what we are see what happened at the cross is is what put us in this position what happened at crossing you accepting what happened at the cross this is what this is what brings you back to this position now let me finish reading this quote and i'm gonna read your scripture it says we forget many times what made us what we are after we become what we are then we forget how we got here now let me read your scripture let's let's turn to uh revelation one let me give me verse five and six see this is not something that you just kind of you know you're born and you have this no you got to come through the sacrifice of the cross but when you come through the sacrifice of the cross it brings you back to a place hallelujah where you get everything adam lost now look at revelation 1 verse 5 and 6. let's look at this amen says and from jesus christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth hallelujah unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood look at verse six and hath made us kings and priests unto god and his father to him be glory and dominion forever and ever amen to be a king amen means that you are the final authority and the blood has already made you this you're not coming to this you are this now to be a king you you you become the final authority to be a priest makes you an intercessor [Music] one that stands in the gap for other people oh hallelujah somebody glory to god it's saying and brother adam said in the church but he says right now yeah we ring with christ i like this statement right now that's not something that's coming right now we reign with christ he says having dominion over sin you talk about you can't help yourself you a lie you can help yourself if you will submit yourself to the word of god you can help yourself if you want to know how to help yourself submit to the word of god right now we reign with christ having dominion over sin having dominion over the world having dominion over the flesh and he didn't stop there he said we also have dominion over the devil amen amen right i love this i love this i love it oh my all right let me keep going in this so you know we we're looking at this this redemption god uses human beings to redeem other human beings now there's another i want to keep going in the kinsmen redeem and then we'll drop into a scripture paragraph 194 in this kinsmen redemon praise god it says now one more quotation before i leave to start the prayer line one more quotation i looked up this morning the word redeem says excuse me my armenian brethren but i i just have to put this in not to hurt but just to make you think that's what i'm doing today just to make you think uh look up what redemption means he says redemption actually applied in the greek word to taking a slave from the market i can't spell the greek word just now but it means take a slave from the market to redeem it says a man's done something wrong his master sold him into slavery actually unto death and he's in the market he's a slave but a man comes along a worthy man that's able to do it yeah and finds this man if you're living in sin you ain't no worthy man or no worthy woman you can't do nothing like this you got to be living way above sin that's right hallelujah right i mean this this is not for the sinner right man this is not that's not you know uh a novice hallelujah amen this is from a tour christians understanding that god uses human beings to redeem human beings that you go to work with a purpose a purpose now you realize this is greater than than just getting a paycheck i'm here for a purpose every customer that god give you those that own your own business every customer that god gives you you're there serving them for a purpose amen you know how many other customers do that that don't potential customers that don't call that don't want your business hallelujah you're there for king's business amen all right all right you understand you're there for king's business not not your business yeah you you're gonna use it to pay your bills and all that but no it's a greater purpose i want to tell you the family that you're a part of you're there for a purpose why is it that you can see the truth and they can't but i want to tell you something your actions will either bring them to the truth or push them further away and if you allow christ to be expressed through you then christ can redeem somebody amen amen amen all right uh oh he says uh a man has done something wrong his master sold him into slavery action unto death and he's in the market he's a slave but a man comes along a worthy man that's able to do it and finds this man and and finds grace in the sight he redeems him the worthy man that finds i mean the worthy man that sees somebody in bondage he goes pays the price he redeems him this is what christ did to us it says thus take him from the slave market and takes him out to himself notice and that slave once redeemed i love this statement the slave once redeemed can never be sold in the market again hey man can never be sold again he he's marked he's marked and if he was thought if he was thought enough of one time to be redeemed no one can ever sell him again for a slave i love that because that just that just that just applies to each and every one that's been bought by the blood of christ we're not going back into the devil's market no more once i realize i've been redeemed i'll never be sold into slavery again never it says oh thanks be to god that when a man has once come to christ and been redeemed by the precious blood the devil can never make you a slave again amen he says you're secure in the blood of jesus christ until the day of your redemption that slave look it up in exodus and find out if that ain't the levitical law i mean in leviticus it says see if that ain't the law the slave once redeemed can never be sold again for a slave that's right oh i'm so glad i'm so happy to know that our kinsmen redeemer that the god of heaven who was spirit came down to earth and was made flesh made like i am made like you are and took on the former sinful flesh knowing no sin that our sins might rest upon him and become kin folks thus made a public testimony of dying paying the full price god's spirit witnessing back the temple was rent the veil from top to the bottom not from the bottom to the top from top to the bottom showed that god himself tore it open from above really from the top to the bottom open the way and the sacrifice blocks turned over and the lightning fought through the dark angry skies the sun went down in the middle of the day the stars refuse to shine and everything give a testimony we are redeemed hallelujah amen now brother randall said go back to leviticus so can we go back to leviticus let's turn to leviticus 25. leviticus 25 because this is where we get god's law of redemption amen uh i'm i'm starting at verse 25 leviticus 25 25 is where i want to read amen and there's a lot more here that can be read but here leviticus 25 25 it says this if thy brother be waxing poor now remember uh god uses human beings to redeem human beings now when i heard i said lord i gotta find a scripture that support this and and so the lord take us back leviticus 25 so here leviticus 25 if thy brother be waxing poor and have sold away some of his possession and if any of his kin comes to come to redeem it then shall he redeem that which is brother soul and if the man have none to redeem it and himself be able to redeem it then let him count the years of the sale thereof and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it that he may return unto his possession but if he be not able to restore it to him then that which is so shall remain in the hand of him that bought it until the year of jubilee and in the jubilee in the jubilee it shall go out and he shall return unto his possession now it goes on um uh i'm going to skip over to uh this other there's a lot more to read here but i'm gonna skip over to uh verse four to seven and and other thing i want to just kind of get here in this year jubilee what it what it what it shows if you could just get this one thing from the year jubilee it shows that at some time amen uh those that are in bondage must be set free what i want to what i want to tell you there is a law concerning freedom there's a law the year jubilee came every 50th year and there was a law saying i don't care how much stuff you lost amen when a year if you didn't have the money to get it back that's okay and when the year jubilee came you were gonna get everything you got back not just your stuff but even if you sold yourself into slavery when the year jubilee came you were going to go free we don't have people blowing physical trumpets today hallelujah but when the gospel is preached then the trumpet is blowing and you no longer have to stay bound to a devil you can go free the gospel releases you from the slave market [Applause] look at this in leviticus 25 i'm skipping over to verse 47. and if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee and thy brother that dwelleth by him wax poor and sell himself unto the stranger or sojourner by thee or to the stock of the stranger's family now this is a stranger you're not even being sold to your own brothers right this is a stranger look at this he said and i like to look at this stranger as the devil he says after that he is so he may be redeemed again and look at who can do it one of his brethren may redeem him god uses human beings to redeem human beings one of his brothers can do it oh my god i i just got to pause your your your brother is in the slave market your sister is in the slave market your wife is in the slave market your mama is in the slave market your daddy is in the slave market do something about it [Applause] [Music] you got the money do something let me just read this uh verse verse 48 it says uh and after that he is so he may be redeemed again one again one of his brethren may redeem him either his uncle or his uncle's son may redeem him ain't that some it's not even his son right this this extended family i don't know if y'all getting that yet extended family can claim your loved one [Music] can't let me put it this way i'm claiming my nieces i'm claiming great nieces nephews i'm claiming them all in the name of jesus amen because i've been redeemed i can lay claims like this glory look at this he says either his uncle or his uncle's son may redeem him or any that is nigh of kin unto him my god he says uh of his family may redeem him or if he be able he may redeem himself and he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him that the year to him until the year of jubilee and the price of his sales shall be according unto the number of the years according to the time of a higher servant shall it be with him if there be yet many years behind according to them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for and if they remain but a few years into the year of you jubilee then he shall count with him and according to his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption and as a yearly higher servant shall he be with him and the other shall not rule with rigor over him in thy sight listen and if he be not uh if he be not redeemed in these years then he shall go out in the year of jubilee so if they don't get them if they ain't got the money to get them all these other times hallelujah amen god still has a time limit amen oh i love this church god still has a time limit as to how long the devil can hold your loved one [Applause] [Music] praise god you ain't got nothing to worry about if if if the sons say i just i ain't got the money daddy to get you out you don't want to see your family bound like that think about if this was your daddy in bondage think about if this was one of your family members in box you wouldn't want to see him like but daddy i just don't have the money but you were going to encourage daddy that in a year jubilee is coming hallelujah i don't know what day that trump is going to sound daddy but you ain't going to work here no more [Applause] glory to god you can drop amen out the the the whatever you plant with whatever tools you're using you can drop it and go free daddy and you know what you coming back to your possession because redeemed mean to bring you back to what you lost in the first place hallelujah i say it's time for mama to go free it's time for daddy to go free time for sons and daughters to go free let the redeemed of the lord say so hallelujah nieces and nephews uncles and aunties everybody going free if you came to me you going free my god my god hallelujah lord i believe this amen i'm here verse 54 says and if he be not redeemed in these years then he shall go out in a year of jew believe both he and his children with him for unto the children for unto me the children of israel our servants they are my servants whom i brought forth out of the land of egypt i am the lord your god in this particular passage god was showing how he used humans to redeem other humans redemption amen let me just uh again just give you a couple more definitions and then i'm going to something redeemed means to buy back it restores everything back to the original owner also brother branham say redeemed means to be taken out of the pawnshop that satan has put us in our redemption is also to take one from the slave take a slave from the market and it's through the shedding of the blood on the cross christ has redeemed us amen we have been restored to everything that adam lost now i was just kind of thinking to myself what are some examples in scripture outside of what we just read in leviticus where a human being is being used to redeem a human being it's very easy for us to go to the story of boaz and ruth but here we see boaz uh when he went to redeem naomi right that's what he was going to do this was a human being going to redeem naomi naomi had lost everything she lost her husband she lost her children she lost the land she lost everything but the only way she can get that back is that she had to have a kinsmen redeemer do the work and and here boaz decides to do it but in redeeming naomi to restore everything that naomi lost he also got a gentile bride which was ruth we can see it in that story yeah amen but what about you know because again a redemption is to is to bring it back to its original owner or maybe bring you back to your original land your original possession amen i could see this also in the story of abraham and lot hallelujah amen when lord got so tangled up down there in sin and sodom glory amen until that there were kings that came down and took over sodom and and captured all the people and took them a captive glory to god but abraham said you can't have my nephew god uses human beings to redeem human beings he said you can't have my nephew like that amen i don't like the fact that he down in sodom is enough is enough you can't take him from sodom and to wherever you got you you trying to take him he said i'm coming after my nephew glory to god he got his his service they didn't there was not even a real army but they went down by faith taking maybe some rakes and all kinds of stuff down in a fight or battle but when they went down their praise god god got into those instruments that they were using and they won the battle and defeated five kings and they recovered a lot in everything lot lost god used a human being to redeem a human being what about david when he was fighting with the enemy y'all know david one time a great man of god he actually went and signed up for the enemy's army the same army army he defeated they they they giant he defeated now he's working for the army while david's there working for the army he was they had a battle that data said that we're going to go fight israel and uh and the guy david was dealing with saying yeah david i trust you come on you know let's go down here and fight israel now and david hardy thinking oh lord how i'm gonna fight israel see god has to make a way but let god do it david showed up to the battle with his men and then the some of the philistine lords looked to say wait a minute these fellas can't go with us what you mean we came and they had to put on a show you know what you mean we can't go with y'all now y'all know you know look they're gonna be gonna turn their heart against us and they're gonna start fighting nothing about them don't let them go with us no not not that man was smart i mean because he might not have known david's story but david had multiple opportunities to kill saul and david refused to do so david would not touch god's anointing so ain't no way no matter what battle he was in he was not going to touch god's anointing so they sent david home david goes back and when he gets there he fires that all of his family has been taken captive glory to god the bible say uh you know david uh david had to do something that many of us found ourselves having to do some time david had to encourage himself for the lord i know you're going through on your job but stop and encourage yourself in the lord hallelujah you might be going through with this and going through with that stop and encourage yourself with the lord hallelujah amen amen encourage yourself in the lord david stopped and encouraged himself even when his men thought about the uh killing them saying man we you don't let us like this all of our families are gone he prayed and god showed them what to do david when it found and and the way the story goes in the bible that david found a man that they they kind of threw to the side they they pushed him off and thought that he was going to die so they just let him sit there for three days and die but david found him restored this man to health oh glory to god fed him a little food and restored the man back to health and and when they got him amen their health they begin to talk to them now where you say you're from are we from uh such and such you know and they they left me here a couple days ago to to you know to die it's saying uh and what did they do but when they left you they went down into this area and they invaded and took all these people and uh and where did they go back to right now yeah uh well you know i know exactly where they went back to say but no no no i need i need a favor from you if if i'm gonna go and show you where they went please don't deliver me to my master if i'm gonna be a spy don't don't deliver me to my master i should have just died right here he said you got my promise david went down there and the bible says that david recovered all i'm here to tell you glory to god god uses human beings to redeem bring back other human beings praise god glory to god amen god gonna use you to bring your family back [Applause] you looking for god to use somebody else god gonna use you to bring your family back god uses human beings to redeem human beings we know that we know jesus redeemed us let me see i got i got some things here that i i i want to try to read david oh my oh my let me read a quote um oh my my my my mama before i read that one i'm just i'm gonna tell you i'm coming from adoption part one just lining it up but another one that i thought about god using a human being to redeem human beings i thought about that prodigal son left his father's house and took all his money and when i lived a riot a riotous life ungodly life but daddy kept praying for that boy and mama kept praying for that boy and one day god began to deal with that boy's heart while he was at the lowest state of his life eating with pigs and as a uh as a as an israelite he was not supposed to have nothing to do with pigs that was the lowest job that boy could take someone's got some loved ones really got some low jobs you know they they know better than to work in a place like that but don't fuss at them pray for them amen pray for and as dad is praying for this boy and one day while he's sitting there in this in this in this filthy job in the pig pen uh the the holy spirit begin to deal with so you know what even the servants in my daddy's house live better than the way i'm living out here says you know and it and it took something for him to come to the point that he had to humble himself and go back to daddy's house it took something you can imagine what that boy was going through i know they're going to say this they're going gonna say that they're gonna say this they're gonna say that and and i'm just you know i i don't really want to go through all that i don't want to hear what daddy got to say but the boys say you know what still the servants a little better than my then then i'm living i'm going back to daddy's house i know i'm messed up but i'm going back home now don't be a stumbling block when people trying to come back home amen [Music] amen sometimes god uses different situations to get people's attention to try to bring them back home and god wants to use you to redeem another human being hear this boy say i'm going back i'm coming i'm coming home and his daddy could see him from a distance walking coming daddy got excited told mama guess what your boy is on the way how you know i can tell by the way he walked that's your boy and daddy went running from the house maybe left the porch ran out there to grab his son and just kiss him and hug him and say you know son i'm happy to have him and it's dad i'm happy to be home but daddy don't don't say another word i got to tell you something daddy what is it so i said daddy i'm sorry for the way that i messed up your name i'm sorry for the way i handled myself i i'm sorry daddy and i just felt sad daddy servants in your house live better than the way i'm living i don't i know i'm not worthy to be called a son but if you just let me be a servant daddy i'll be all right daddy looked at him and said uh son i got servants i hired him and i fired him and i do all this he says but it's one thing different about you than no servants you were born a son and since you were born a son you will always be a son and it's through the words that daddy shared that allowed that boy to come back to his place as sun see human beings god uses human beings to redeem other human beings our actions our thoughts is what kind of brings this let me let me let me let me i want to i want i want to it's what brings it past let me just give you uh just a couple more quotes and now i'll wind it up uh i think i want to go back to that day on calvary sorry i'll skip adoption let me go back to that day on camera and this is a paragraph 127. glory to god look at this it says uh now watch jesus said watch how he stated the works that i do he's doing them right now the works that i'm doing now healing the sick raising today open the eyes of the blind these works shall you do also you'll do these if you believe in me you you do these works and then a greater than this shall you do for i go to my father a little while in the world won't see me no more yet you'll see me i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world i will not leave you confidence i'll pray i'll pray the father he'll send you another confidence which is the holy ghost whom the world cannot receive you cannot you but yet you can receive him he says now notice the greater works was to have the power in the church not only to heal the sick by prayer cast out devils by prayer see the greater works was but to impart eternal life to believers the holy ghost was coming and given into the hands of the church to impart life oh that's what calvary meant it took stooped degraded men and women and lifted them into a place to be sons and daughters of god to heal the sick and to impart eternal life by giving the holy ghost to obedient believers men who were once unbelievers be made believers and impart east in part spiritual eternal life how much greater is it to say to the sick woman laying here i can pray a prayer faith and she'll be healed that's a great thing that's what he was doing then but said greater than this shall you do i'm going to give you power not only to raise them up for a while because you can get sick again not only raise them up for a while but to give him eternal life which will be eternal forever right now y'all know that happened in brother branham's ministry had it right when she was uh wondering what to get he she gave a offering a building fund and he went there to the house and says uh you know i was coming back to get this money but the lord told me not to do it on the way say howdy uh he started talking about them squirrels being created and and had it just said that's nothing but the truth and when she said the right word the right time her amen please god amen please god god say tell her whatever she wants she can have right now and uh brother graham say had it the lord told me he said whatever you ask for right now you can have i know you're a poor woman i know this you got a sister that's been sick your mom and dad is sick whatever you ask for you can have right now and say well what do i expect i can't tell you what to ask for but you asked for it and whatever you asked for you can have had it looked around the room looked at everybody and said and the thing that that that stirred her heart the most was her children when she looked at her sons who were not interested in the things of god he says you know the greatest thing that i can ask god for is the salvation of my two boys brother ram say in the name of the lord jesus received the salvation of your two boys right now spoken word salvation was given to them boys right on the spot and that wasn't the only time he did it brother dalton was in church one night with a burden for his kids i think i forget how many kids brother dalton had brother branham told him say uh brother i give you your children in the name of the lord jesus christ everybody got saved in a matter of days all the kids were saved now i'm gonna tell you something when i hear testimonies like that i just i can't help but have faith and i'm going to tell you after preaching a sermon like this it's not just faith for my children i got faith for your children amen praise the lord amen hallelujah let me go in with this quote uh uh poor uh where where am i uh poor blind wretched uh people how do you miss that don't you see what the greater thing is that's the greatest thing that could ever happen was to impart eternal life to people he says what's eternal life the life that he lived the life that was in him impart that to others see so let the redeemed of the lord say so give it to somebody can a man do that can a man impart that to others can a man do that the prophet answers he says the son of god can a son of god can jesus said whosoever sins you remit to them they are remitted whosoever says you retain to them they are retained now here's where the catholic church and many of the others made their big mistake they go out and say i forgive your sins that wasn't it we're not sitting in a confession booth says how did they get their sins forgiven in the bible peter answered that question on the day of pentecost and said what can we do to be safe see you got to open your mouth and share with somebody that's how that's how that's how eternal life is imparted that's how redemption is given to him by you being a testimony to him see don't run from the trial stay there in the trial god wants to use you to redeem somebody they need to see real christianity glory to god you know that the man that was in the bar with his friends yeah brother brandon told a story and he and they he said they say ain't no such thing as a real christian right they say uh uh the man was drunk he said well i i beg to differ uh no ain't no such thing a real christian say i i beg to differ my wife is a real christian your wife come on man your wife ain't no real christian say i'll tell you what we'll prove that she's a she's a christian say let's act real drunk and let's go home to the house and and we'll see i'm gonna prove to y'all that my wife is christian can you imagine that this man was bringing his friends to his house to create a trial in order to prove what his wife was amen the whole thing was specially designed it was specially designed in order for him to show them what his wife was now and he didn't tell her he said he said we're gonna act real drunk now come on let's go again let's act and say so uh um then we want some breakfast okay she got on up fixing all day breakfast and everything and and uh and and she getting their breakfast all fixed and you know and they're just kind of watching and they just acting up you know really giving her a hard time but she bring the breakfast all night anyway and when she finally get it all made yeah that's that i mean all over the slaved over the stove get it all made then he bring it up to him and and uh and when he gets it said now watch this boys watch this acting all drunk take it and push push it off the table you know i don't like my eggs like this go make them again now this was the proving ground see some of us would have failed the [Music] test but she got a song in her heart she said okay honey don't worry about it i'll make it the way you want it i'll do it the way you want i'm sorry i'm sorry i'll get it the way you want it should just begin to sing must jesus bear this cross alone and all the world go free she said no there's a cross for everyone there's a cross for me just come on boys let's go outside and they just sit there on the outside listening to how she was responding inside when they heard how she was responding on the inside them fellas looked that they looked at the man okay there's at least one real christian and he's sitting out there saying i told y'all my wife is a real christian the whole test was designed thought of calculated in order to prove whether she was a real christian or not and do you realize because she displayed her christian attributes god used a human being to redeem human beings all in a man gave their hearts to the lord jesus because of that one lady's testimony let me finish reading this quote we'll see we'll bring this to a close oh hallelujah whosoever sends your remit to them they're remitted whosoever sends you retain to them they retain let me go back and read that what is eternal life the life that he lived the life that was in him impart that to others can a man do that a son of god can jesus said whosoever sins you remit to them they are remitted whosoever sins you retain to them they are retained now here's where the catholic church and many others made their big mistake they go out and say i forgive your sins that wasn't it how did the si how did they get sins forgiven in the big in the bible peter answered that question on the day of pentecost they said um what can we do to be saved how can we get this that you all got he laid down the prescription he told them what to do he said repent every one of you towards god see let the redeemed of the lord say so open up your mouth and say something repent every one of you towards god be baptized in the name of jesus christ what for the remission of your sins there's the greater works he says how many of you preaches this morning how many of you listening to my word on magnetic tape are willing to go to calvary this morning and look and look what god did there for you and forsake your denominational creeds and preach the gospel hallelujah it's in your lap now what are you going to do with it why repentance and remission of sins must be preached in his name to all the world beginning at jerusalem hallelujah there you are what does calvary mean to you what that day do to you did it stuff you out with some theology did it make your stuffed shirt or did it make you a christian sold out hallelujah center minute greater works than this shall you do you you you see where where uh uh where where these are don't you greater works than this remaining sins in the name of jesus christ but through creeds and denominations so forth it's bound you down to a place you're still serving the world church we've been free from that calvary came to set us free from that caliber came to restore us back to everything that adam lost calvary came to cause us to live like christ we're taking the place of christ in the south the only hands that god got is your hands the only feet god has are your feet the only mouth god has is your mouth i say let the redeemed of the lord say so and let god use human beings to redeem human beings you want to see your family delivered pay the price pay the price you want to see them free pay the price hallelujah you'll see them go free let's pray father in the name of jesus lord your prophet has given us something to challenge us and we as believers lord is very easy just to mentally agree with the word of god but lord i don't want to mentally agree with it i i want to pay the price the same way that you paid the price at calvary's cross i know that we don't have to die for sins but we certainly have to die to ourself we have to be willing to take this corner wheat go in the ground and die the bible says if we we if we if we don't do it lord we abide alone and that's that's why many of us are lord in the situation that when we're abiding alone because we're not willing to die to ourselves the bible says if we do it but willing to take this corn a week go on the ground and die the bible says we will bring forth much fruit lord we surrender our hearts to you we surrender our lives to you as your prophet told us lord you use human beings to redeem other human beings and god he he challenged us even when we're going through great testing trials help us to realize it's a reason that we're going through that trial you want to use that in order to bring redemption to somebody else somebody needs to see christ reflected in and through us the same christ that was spit upon the same christ that had to wear thorns the same christ that was lying on same christ that they they had nothing to convict him of but yet they accused him anyway god we have to go through these similar trials because we're taking your place help us to surrender ourselves to that god it's in jesus name that we pray amen amen amen amen let's give the lord a hand of praise um this is uh something i say just challenges me you know as a as i as i um was just meditating on it and there was a a quote that i remember [Music] um that was ministered here some years ago and brother branham was was he had a i believe it was the prophet that had a dream and um and in this dream there was a lady saying you know what uh brother branham uh you've been misunderstood and and we've been i mean you misunderstood us and you know we we're fine people with this that the other brother ramsey saw the people locked up in bars and in a cage just uh just in a really really bad situation that they they couldn't um get free from and he saw the spirit of the lord actually come to him in this dream and say you know i'm expecting you to deliver the people he said now how can i deliver the people these iron bars and this and that and you know all of this going on so how can i be the one to deliver the people he said but he heard christ say i'm expecting you to deliver the people brother branham says he he looked at the condition and he realized that he didn't have strength to break the bars open to get the people free so he said so i said [Music] say let the redeemed of the lord say so right so i said house of hell give way to the name of the lord jesus christ and i'm saying that right now in the name of jesus house of hell give way amen to the name of the lord jesus christ that's the only way we can get the job done is by releasing it out of our mouth we don't have strength to do anything else but there's enough power in the spoken word to create worlds we thank you lord for your power that you've given us hallelujah shall we stand to our feet amen brother solomon i'll have you come and close out the service amen on today there's an attribute of redemption that is in each and every one of you god bless you the lord keep you [Music] available [Music] i'm available to you my will i give you my will i give to you i'll do what you say do [Music] me lord to show someone away and enable me to say my storage is
