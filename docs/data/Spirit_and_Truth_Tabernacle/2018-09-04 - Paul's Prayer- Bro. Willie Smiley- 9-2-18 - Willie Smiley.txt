morning so I hope they ready because brother Juan ain't nothing play with we appreciate the Lord this morning but we want to start Ephesians chapter 3 I want to start at the 13 verse appreciate I don't know if we have any visitors this morning but appreciate all the visitors being here this morning I'm just stepping in for the bishop bishop this morning since wherefore I desire that she faint not at my tribulation for you which is your glory for this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth his name that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that Christ may dwell in your heart by by faith that you being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and the length and the depth and the height and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fullness of God now to him that is able to do exceedingly abundant of all that we can exit think according to the power that worketh in us to him be the glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages world without any man that's about heads forward prayer Heavenly Father we just want to give thanks and praise this morning we're just trusting and dependent on you we just want to get the human part pushed to one side so that the Holy Spirit can take control you know of every heart every need in the building this morning Lord we we trust that father that somebody need deliverance healing whatever it might be that your grant answer questions whatever's on the heart of your people we're just a vessel this morning and not trusted in any human ability that we possess but we're just trusting in the gift of God and we understand that's the ability to get ourselves out of the way we asked that Lord God that you just used brother Jack this morning to break the bread of life in the Lima area Lord God and just give him safe passage back home we just thank you and praise you for all things this morning in Jesus name Amen amen amen maybe see we we want to use as a topic the paulus Prayer and now I've preached this at home and I've kind of did it in a couple of services but we we want to we want to maybe see how far we can go and then brother Jack I pick it up if he like to but we trust that we could say something that a bless us this morning about a grace of God now one of the things we know if you look at the beginning of the third chapter Paul was was working with the the Ephesians church and he was telling them that you know Paul was in prison that's just kind of the backdrop of what's going on here Paul was in prison and he was talking about it in the beginning of the chapter about being a a prisoner of Jesus Christ he was he wasn't he wasn't a prisoner because he was doing something that was evil he wasn't an evildoer he was in prison for the sake of the gospel right but not as evildoer and and you know Paul being the the messenger of the age and I guess you know more or less like a father figure to a lot of folk Timothy and the different ones you know his absence sometimes tribulation causes people a lot of times to get faint-hearted and Paul Paul was saying say I desire that G faint not right let's lose courage you know when people are going through something or when people see other folk going through something a lot of times we we we get discouraged especially especially around church when when we see Church and church folk going through things it tries to bring the spirit of discouragement you know the devil wants nothing more for us to be discouraged he wants nothing more for us to be down he wants nothing more for the spirit of depression and oppression and I think sometimes when when we were going through things we begin to lose sight on our very existence in why God called us said right we get caught up in what we're going through the problems that we're going through and the situations that's upon us and and we lose sight on why God called us and and one of the things I realized and studying the scripture Paul was telling the dispensation of the gospel was given to him he was given he was under mandate from God to preach to the unsearchable riches of Jesus Christ to bring the gospel to the Gentiles is that right and and one of the things imprisonment and all the things that that Paul went through it didn't change that right but present didn't change God eternal purpose right that look one thing I realize I'm a priest this morning one thing I realized no matter what we're going through and what we will go through it does not and it will not change God's eternal purpose and why God called us God called us to be the church God called us to be the bride God calls us called us to be victorious God called us to be on top is there right and one thing I realize what you are going through will not change that tribulation will not change what God has called you for prison prison did change them the right amen God called Paul to preach the gospel and because he was in prison Paul still wrote four books on the Bible in prison that prison didn't stop the panel God tribulation and what we might be going through will not stop the pipe well I'm going through and it will not stop y'all lot of pre holdin it will not stop God not at all not at all it will not stop stop the program of God see we got to understand something I wanna I want to maybe stop here for a second the prophet makes a statement hearing the message called unpardonable sin it's just now when you get unsettled foundationally right but what is what is what the quote is alluding to is the church being a settled and the church being taught properly a lot of times we think with ministry well they're upset with us well brother Jack just don't want us to do anything well brother jack jessee's know i could say it like that because i've been pastor in 20 years brother Jack don't want us to go anywhere and we and listen to the fact and we can't do anything and we can't go anywhere and we can't wear what we want to wear it's not that you gotta be fundamentally taught fundamentally sound in order to be able to fulfill the purpose of God in your life understood see we can't be Christians on our own accord with our own mind and our own thoughts you gotta come God's provided way when you become a Christian you leave your thoughts on the outs you're feeling on the outside you you come here to be taught right so that you can understand what what's what's the mind of God right what's the characteristics about what's the nature of God they're right in order to be able to fulfill an eternal purpose you have got to have understanding right a lot of folks won't religion a lot of folk like you know just going to church and have it being identified but that God don't call you for that God called you and have something for you to do in mind and then all of us to be able to do it properly we gotta be trained properly right we have got to be trained properly right from from the onset see folk love shopping we love having a good time but that's fine and I'd love to do that I like to have I love to have a good time well but but I think we're missing it is that people aren't understanding the purpose of the ministry and the why God has a ministry and what the objective of the ministry if it's if it's fundamentally sound it has the that the mind of God in you and in you you know as a church at heart right see if it's somebody that's just trying to build a kingdom and make themselves something and make a big name for themselves then they're not going to do it properly they got to purposely leave out something because that's something that they leave out is the thing that maybe else exposed them right right but but when you don't have an agenda when you realize God for purpose you approached the ministry realizing that you're going to be responsible right you want to be responsible for the souls that you see every time I get in the pulpit I don't know anybody I don't see you till we get outside I joke what you did but in here you know I don't jump I don't play right because I realized that I'm gonna be held accountable and that it's important that we be taught right in order to fulfill God's eternal plan and purpose for our lives is that right if you're coming to church for any other reason you coming for the wrong reason right well they got a great climb I just like the way you know the pastor move is he it's the wrong reason right you know the past is phony that's the wrong reason you're looking at the wrong thing see you you've got to be fundamentally talk right and see Paul was Paul was trying to make sure that the church was fundamentally tunnel my skipper here in just a minute in something else that I was preaching it at my church this week I'm gonna move back and forth because I've been kind of working with this for a couple of weeks it's something that I was trying to share with with the church there is that Paul Paul in the fourth chapter was bringing thanks right a man could see differences and I think in the things that nature has nothing to do with it right what anchors the church is its facts we've got to have the facts not feelings not emotions not well I think what your thought has nothing to do with it because it you can't think higher than go and see what we gotta keep in mind God was his own counsel that was an uncounseled God didn't give a group of men and put him together so watch out bank right he was his own counsel right he he had his own plan laid out before the foundation of the world when we will just attribute in the mind of God God had a plan I had a plan before Eve ever coming to existence being infinite knowing that they will fall knowing that it was like mistake he slay them laughs that's a fact and what we need is facts in that we got so much feelings and emotions in church you can hardly work with folk no mo if I said please both smiling y'all gonna have to blame your pastor when you get back huh but but this is what we need we need to remove our feelings that I emotions and get the facts because the facts of God don't change see people change people decide that well the folk one day we in the next day we ain't one day I'm going on the way just to see him and the next day we sippin liquor on the corner somewhere now I want to talk to me up in y'all believe it alone in a minute get over some you all right what but you we need to be fundamentally trial see because you're not going in the glory amen side of the word of God stay right seek it takes the Word of God because uh uh faith has got to have a place for your emotions it's gonna be on the one who God right I'm gonna get on that for that I'm gonna get off for that y'all get him to acquire right faith faith has got to have a place right and in fact the rest o your emotions because we up and down one minute we say we got into the next video he said Oh God you see uh it's just like it's just like even when the Prophet was on the scene and you pray for people and telling the goat goat a goat a way and they here they come back and say well I thought you said he said I thought you believed I thought you believed right and people say they believe you know it's easier to believe this morning because you're monks you must this the group of people on the atmosphere been created but you gotta believe with it's nobody exam huh when nobody's there when you ain't feeling good you gotta believe when when the dominant tuck turn loose all a half against you you gotta know where you stand is that right could you imagine that day when when when King David and in the brother and came back and the enemy had came and got all families all arises all cheer well how you gonna catch yourself or you'll know it Rosie's the deliverer you don't beg Alina trusted but we know see then you can stand there say the devil's a lot see you see pop I was in prison for power understood God called me and in prison you know what time they took Paul I think pilots also put them in prison but Paul had an eternal practice Paul say you know what let's not a revival up in here to be up in here he let's start with my right they got the singing we would have been the crime they got the same and they got this shot huh things stop moving things are stopped moving if you want to get the singing is young when you're going through that get the devil wants you to be down right the devil want you to say well if I would've did this no you're gonna did all bad it's just yo season to go through what you've gone through but go season don't change nothing huh oh praise be his wonderful name right see you know Paul's it like we say pause imprisonment could juice folk bolts of the Bible right amen he wasn't going through some things but what he produced right I asked my church this question I say we go through things right and and we do we lose sight of the God's eternal purpose right hmm when I ask them what's coming out of your tribulation for the sake of the gospel what's being produced y'all better write that down that that was profound there cuz I we do all we do to see problem are we doing see the situation but we miss God and I will read that again that came to me why I'll tell you what all moans bust see what's coming out of your tribulation for the sake of the gospel what's being produced see if something was being produced if Paul was still doing something even though he was in prison for the sake of the thing that he believed then what about us see you've got to be able to see what is God doing what's been if

of Joseph right a man see now I don't huh they put him in prison and put him in prison he still came up huh he still came up right stick watch this even from prison operating in a gift huh just like Paul Charlie was in prison but the gift was still being it operated right a man had a dream Joseph interpret the dream Joseph they imprison all these way a mentor position in place that God had

business Mona like this devil cleanup hitter small mean y'all happy please feel ready to tell appeal about this bill him we'll see you saying you the body returned to the passer huh look look Church can you how to dream all the smartphone see wait sometimes we thank the sponsors people around us know stuff if either suppose people around us sometimes getting their bat in trouble and sometimes I be the smiles people allow you to be really that when you're really looking at other words they don't really know what they think they know huh sometimes we think because folks sound smart so smart I mean you're smart but hey man you might know a few things about a few things but that'd be people a lot of times around you this this really quiet reserved huh cuz the proper God he made just let me say that those apostles need a few words until they got in the pulpit huh hey man that one they weren't always trying to project and try to show how much they know me like me I'll be around a group of preachers up really only you like to be around a group reaching thank I time to try to be be playing games look man I got time for that man hmm give me some people sometimes I want to enjoy life and laughing oh that not trying to you know he'll you know the prophets had this right the organ is fussing about stuff I don't have time for that my time is valuable right the smart man right they couldn't figure out the interpretation of it but God had that one man Oh see watch God God does things in season the season had arrived I was in jail with a man that and we had some dream he interpreted to the ladder King say go get it go see it season four chains had come see it didn't come when he wanted it to come but it was right on time it's that right don't waiting got Joseph out of prison clean him up a little bit you know put him on no son sudden he company before the key see you can't come before a key in account away we go to any kind of way no you not you gotta be last that's another subject huh they brought they brought Joseph up out of prison right amen Joseph interpreted the dream told him he's gonna be seven years of famine and seven years of plenty right listen let me tell you some only joseph could interpret that dream Joseph was on the sea for such a time as then right Joseph jump Joseph was there with his gift a man and a God came on the scene for letting his dreams of visit to his folk did he come back not and void is that right come on after he interpreted it the king sitting round the teens sitting around looking like well what we ought to do only Joseph had the revelation i what to do in that time he would look like uh well can't realize listen thank you nobody around here can get this job done cuz come nobody tell me what was going on and so nobody can nobody had the answers to the problems but Joseph see I always had a man that he could Amen give up hope though to me you got too many opinions right amen two men see that's right you know the problem we have around church folk listen to too many folk in church instead of coming God to right away and listening to the pastor we listen to the parking lot preachers we listen to a whole lot of folk but we and then we turn death ear to the pastor why because he here Michael you know why they were mad with Michael because he never promised I'd mangoo first day was concerned Michael only prophesied it could only prophesy what God had given them the prophesied and when you don't say things that people want to hear they get upset with you huh they're good upset with you he always this no we tell my god now we took my serving God well should be God just fool us to worship God in vain right well you may attend we can worship God yes jesus said in vain do you love him teaching for doctrines the commandments of man right see then infidel he was a washable but he worship wrong see you got to find out what God is doing for the day and our two children living in it right when Jesus came on the scene and started talking to the woman at the well she was trying to talk about Abraham and in a position of in place in Jesus tones and it's coming a time and now he is that the true worshipers are worship it mean spirited until we faint worshiping upon their mountain right they think worship bringing it back down to the Word of God right bring you back to Joseph Joseph had the answers to stow up right to store in the years of plenty right so in the years of famine a man will be stored up right and see they start up right they start up but then who else around had that revelation brief with me now who else what what other churches had that revelation to spoil in the land of plenty huh what are the communities what are the people around them Joseph's family didn't have a revelation right they weren't identified with Joseph they didn't had a revelation so the land of plenty they did like everybody else around them right didn't the famine came see but Joseph's and the people around Joseph a man in the land of plenty had than right see did outside had to come to Joseph right because chosen now was seated in a position of power and authority see Joseph throughout all the tribulation that Joseph went through it was only moving them into an eternal purpose and God right Joseph I would jump to this right quick before I get to it this is why when the brother came and they thought Joseph was going to kill him Joseph said no I couldn't do it I can't do it right God was in control man widening control gods were see you saying what I was one but see one guy performing his work you can't tell god what to do well I want my children to come in but then we get in the way with God stop snapping them all up making their life manual don't do that why not god knows what we've been praying about all kind of stuff helpers and wives and all that but then we all like how God does things see Joseph said he did like he said he did it for me he to jail the things he went through in part of the house and all of that was only to get him to the position in the police that he was in see in the season questions in the season of famine if he hadn't have been in that place they all would have perished huh they already perished right they all want to perish everything would have perished around Joseph in the season of famine and she witnessed oh y'all are people see we the seasonal back but Joseph got the goods see tells me see they brought in money and job to say lo here in seed for you [Music] right in a time of famine the scripture says this is a time of famine not for me but to see Joseph has seen in the season of famine right - so for ration for body change Joseph have see low is seen were you go back to the Bible right amen you know that you know this is you know [Applause] [Music] right yeah praise the Lord for the regulation that he'd given me right this is this is the hardest time a man went went when there's a famine there there see right there see we can eat come on preach y'all get my pot on me huh in a famine we can eat just about how many many Bible in the time of famine we can see when when it's just a bunch of cliches and all that kind of stuff we could see some an uncle a full seven-course meal amen we tweekin we can go to the book of Revelation and realize this is the children's playing when it's our preachers fear roaches wondering we know what the White Horse rather you we know what the black horse the Red Horse the pale horse right we understand a man what's going on man we can see that at the Medical Council because without without knowledge everything is going worship the Beast whose name is not written in the lab book of life before the foundation in the world and the only reason we don't because we understand what the Beast eels right so you can see all what I'm gonna sound like I huh you can understand how with Revelation in truth with facts to tell them blue don't faint don't lose heart don't be discouraged right because of what I'm going through right hey man realize what I'm going through I'm going through for the Gospels sake if you go through something today you go through it because you're Christian Jesus told us that huh hey man you going through I'm going through with joy I'm going through praising him so the time you you can't shout out to Lakes I don't want what songwriters say I can't do number way my hand on the way what come on talk to me I like the pop you got he was talking about his mama when his mama was down and she was getting real all about the transition he told us she got to the place where she couldn't speak she couldn't do nothing say mama if you still love in the same way just break yard she's just stopped right that's how Jesus come on so my father didn't want the church to be this right Oh Gloria I must get down to a pot no man get out of here hang on way y'all out but I feel good I feel good this morning amen you know I always have a good time when I come over to spin the truth hey man I don't know about y'all y'all probably say Oh Lord here come brother smiley Jesus I'm gonna make plans to go out of town no you got to make

you know how we like to say what I've heard yeah you might be hurt doc got salve for her let's still barbecue yeah come on we close this oh no that's still bothering Gillian I think somebody needed this this still bombed see you know what I realize that's what people we talk about I'm in the message but people don't really realize what the depth of the message really is folk the steals our real shallow right we cut off in all kinds of stuff where's the heart of God show me God God long-suffering all right God they cut off his church God didn't cut off his family in Genesis he provided a way that right amen he provided in a way see a man he killed an innocent lamb right and dressed his church the innocent had to death for the guilty we all see when you put your finger at me a man I could point my finger and that's how he got that's all we got another thing for free even when the prophet of God at that time when he walked into place and he saw that old woman there and the police and all of the carrying on the first thing he say oh boy she ought to be killed a man of God see just like they it shows a maturity just like the church world's before Pentecost right talking about calling five down heaven Jesus amen sit shut this thing down call it the Pentecost and getting something see right come on hey man you want to call fire down you wanna this and that and get the heart of God God came down and provided a way for his children covered them and bloody sheep scared and gave them when you know when God looked at that thing God had compassion right and then gave them a promise of a savior of a redeemer right amen God came down in love he saw the real love right the real love of a family was displayed in Genesis in in the list of a fault and failure there was you saw Jin because it's easy that's the easiest thing to do is walk out but a lot of time we walk out and don't know the detriment of what we're doing right see hey man you know what I'm determined man I've taken a stand for this word for 30 years right amen I brought my kids to church right I brought it right up in heaven use Newton's you think imma turn my back now I can't do it no matter what it look like they don't even know by the way out there but I'm still the same I need those things like that right frustrated a little bit yeah right but I know God knows the plans he has for me huh godliness before I knew it you God knew it before it happened but that ain't the end of the story huh tell you labor ain't the end of the story no matter what you go through it's not the end of the stone then the musician come God's got the last say so you know you know we used to say it over Turner I did a fat lady say when it ain't over cuz she ain't saying she won't be singing as far as I'm concerned I

I like I like that my system I got me a little plaque if God brought you to it he'll bring it through it huh God is bringing me through it from day one right it's a process overcoming you know our biggest problem is us I realized that church I big astrak-- we don't realize as Christians how much of us got to die huh how much of how much we rely on us and our abilities and our safeguards and all of this this got to die you there yet brush my nope not yet be real with hey but I'm trying to get there because because God presents things and show you thing and all you could say is Lord like Paul strengthen me give me strengthen inside to overcome the outside see I'm glad I said inside work right God has to deal with deal with us you think with Joe God knew what was really in joke he say he was perfect enough right right a minute but God looted there was something in joke he still needed to deal with right God knows God places us in situation with music uh-uh-uh-uh God knows there's something in us that he has to deal with right god no I know we put a good Christian wait for the good people we present know how to do it glory to God we got it all down pat we got to learn heard sisters and we got the look you know that in our behavior that's nice but real Christianity is where you can overcome yourself which self say go right you go left yeah cuz the words say go left flesh said don't you go that way the words say for me to go this way born-again really been a change in me born-again just like Jesus see I've got a saying cause later positions come born-again is all because of Calvary so glad so glad I've been born again anybody need prayer we don't pray for anybody prayer praise like me prayer anybody need prayer amen any prayer prayer we still believe in the power this is different situations up in this morning how many know that God is able he he said he's able to do the exceedingly abundantly above all that we can ask we got we got different situation God is able to do above that's what they asked for but God is able to do above [Music] that's five heads races Heavenly Father Lord multiple situations multiple cases they're all different Lord this morning and I'm just I'm just a man they got to have faith to touch you we know Lord God you can do no more form than what you've already done two thousand years ago you paid the price that with the stripes we could be healing Lord you you you want us to be in health and prospers you see the situation's lawyer here overcoming flesh and heart problems and back problems and kidney problems and jobs and that's nothing the Lord if I could walk into a place with zero credit then you're able to give us a substantial adequate amount of finances to be able to make it you're able to do above that this
