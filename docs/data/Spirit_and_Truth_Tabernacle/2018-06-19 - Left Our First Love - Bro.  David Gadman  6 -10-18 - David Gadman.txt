of Revelations the second chapter like I said just appreciate him having this while he's away appreciate brother Quentin just hoping his home up to me and my wife and just to good fellowship yesterday and then last night just this morning and so we just appreciate that mm a little or bless him also a man would just appreciate that revelations chapter 2 and verse 1 says unto the Angel of the Church of Ephesus write these things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks my is Christ in the church a man Christ indeed which is the life of the church amen no other life and without him it's just a religious Society if he ain't in here this morning if he ain't with us this morning it's just a meaningless gathering of people Amen I trust that he's here this morning verse 2 I know thy works and thy labour and thy patience and how thou candidates cannot bear them which are evil and thou tried them which say there are apostle's in or not and has found them liars oh how beautiful the savior parades in command convince his people hey man he said I know about worse and I labor he knows all about us this morning amen and it takes it to full account of their attitude a man don't ever be discouraged God's not ungracious a man verse 3 and has board has patience and for my name's sake has labored and has not fainted nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou hast left thy first love remember therefore from whence thou art fallen and repent and do the first works or else I will come unto thee quickly and remove thy candlestick out of his place except thou repent but this thou hast thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans which are which I also hate he that have an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh wha give ear the treeline or give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God may the Lord had his blessings to the reading of the world you may be seated like to maybe take for fuc thought for a few minutes left our first love left our first love and like I said here it was he addresses this to the Angel of the church which Paul was the endings of that church we all know amen and he said these things says he that holdeth is Christ talking because he held the seven stars in his right hand and he was walking to the midst and like I said no other life and amen it sets he is and without him this morning this this this this gathering this meeting would be it'd be just meaningless would just be gathered together by him here this morning and I'm trusted he's here this morning I mean we prayed we asked God to come amen and be with us we asked him to come and dwell amongst us this morning amen we pray for the service before it begin and everything and I think brother Quinton said they some of y'all gathered here this morning I'm a prayer-meeting I'm sure y'all pray for their service and that's what we work because we will ensure they won't Christ here with us this morning a man because if he ain't here then wish him go home amen amen we might as well send go home because it won't mean nothing then it begins to say I know about labor not work say man and and thy patience and how thou kill it's not their doom which are evil and that has tried them which said there are apostles it or not and has found enlarged he was commending them amen so you know I thought my it is good what other people say about you those we are every one of us here this morning of we be honest with one another we want people to say nice things about us I want somebody to say something nice about me and you want somebody to say something nice about you and then we always wear that we're human beings and and in just that way we we want people to like us we don't want to be disliked we want to we want to fit in we don't want to be a like a misfit or aren't outcast we want to fit in somewhere and it's nice like I said what what people say about you if you got friends and and that's good because even the Bible says he they have friends but sure self friendly hey man boo but let me ask you this question and then like I said it is good where the people say about you and it's good that you that you got friends and that you can show yourself friendly but what about the Lord committed you one that does he have to say about you this morning what's he have to say about me this morning closely there's no big guys and there's no little use a man there's no big it's like this somebody told this God this preacher years ago and you might have heard of it by the name of Jack Coe and they told him said Jack you better better be kind of calm down and be quiet enough not not get too excited goes up years in the congregation so he gets up there nice as I understand the mayor's in the congregation this morning he said let me tell you something mr. mayor said if you don't get right with God said you'll go to hell just like the trash man will pay man so that's the way it is God don't have no up he's not a respect a person's this morning just because I'm Who I am just because I'm a preacher because you might be a preacher maybe because you can say good or whatever it is that don't think it with God we got to have our hearts right we gotta have our attitude Rhyno we gotta have our last rides hey man that's what I won't hold my wife ride I won't my attitude ride I want my franking ride I want my life ride that I wanted my life right that's what I want a man and so it's good like I said but what about what's the Lord have to say about you hey what is he have to say get let him get you under his microscope say some of us were the only Christians by profession oh we can talk and talk but can we walk the walk I'm talking about myself this morning a minute I don't want to just be a Christian by profession that I'm a Christian but I want to be a Christian because God has come in my life and then birth leave our new pope not only inside the inside not by what I do about how I act but is because I come to church amen but I want to be a Christian because I'm bored again let me ask you a question there's a little statement that I sing one time it said if you were arrested for being a Christian would there be enough evidence to commit you I'm talking about myself in a head were there did enough evidence to convict you all all our help us this morning and then they said they commended these people he said in said I know your works I know your labor I know your patients and help out at Kenneth's not their gym which are evil and that has tried them which say they are apostles and that you bet they are not and you found them to be liars I take all that into full count and I ask no more it has born and has patience and for my name's sake that was labored ha he said it has not painted but you braver for my name's sake you had patience you borne the burden and you've had patience and and all this and he labored for my name's sake and you can't have it found it find it but listen to verse 4 nevertheless I have somewhat against you and that's that you left your first love a man let me read that much for how they amplified if I can it says they're like this but I have one charge against you I have one charge to make against you that you have left abandon their love that you had it first you have deserted me your first love I thought God help us this morning if we look around a man we've been here you know the message and and then from these messages then we can go back and look at what the Prophet preached some 150 years ago and then we can look at our lives and how long we been here I wonder how to spell my love for him is this morning what it was when we first started Jeremiah 2:13 says like this for my people have committed two evils they have forsaken me oh can you imagine forsaking him the very one that can take us in a rapture the very one that can give us a lot this morning the very world that can save ourselves this morning that the married one but if you're in trouble this morning he can set you free but he said they'd forsaken me the fountain of living waters they've forsaken me oh god help us this morning I wonder how close we are this morning to him than we used to be oh you remember when you first got say when you first came to the message how close are you now how much do you love him I'm talking about him ain't talking about the Prophet amen well I believe the Prophet I loved the Prophet amen but I'm talking about Christ this morning how much do you love him this morning how much do you love him this morning that they've forsaken me the fountain of living waters and then food for themselves cisterns broken cisterns which cannot hold water hey man they cannot hold water they percent they committed two evils first therefore secondly the fountains and living waters when they clean to themselves cisterns trying to trying to get something that a whole water without him the broken cisterns payment systems which cannot hold water I believe God has created me new this morning for an intimate relationship with himself a man he wants us to love him above everything he wants me to love him more than I love my wife he wants her to love me for him more than she loves me if I should quit this morning she would hire my desire would be for her to keep personal and I assisted quit probably her desire would be for me to keep pressing on and that's stealing what he wants I remember when the prophet of God he driving down the road one time he asked his wife sister meaning he said how much they said you love the most me or him she said bill as much as I love you as much as I care about you said I love him more than I love you all she's he said that's a better answer that since I was willing to hear Mary man oh he's created us the church this morning for that intimate relationship with him a man old draw help us this morning amen and in keeping that relationship with him must be our top priority hey man God you helped me this morning a man to keep that relationship between me and you top priority hard don't let nothing get in the way Lord God help me Lord Jesus because things may get away a man wouldn't a good they wouldn't that just prophet said we wanted to get closer to God we'll greet our problem pray everyday and so many times things get in the way of that relationship a man cuz I mean that's our relationship that's our communication with him a man for to get in there and read that word a man and not only read that word but getting there and listen to them tapes and did beginning there and begin to pray amen and talk that talk to a man and let him talk back to you have that personal relationship a man 101 I remember when the program's I've said about that black woman you remember we talked about it many times when he was in Memphis Amen Tennessee and how that the plane he all know the story he said the spirit total to keep walking and before he knew he was down there amen and he said it in the back part pound and all that and he begin to you know say keep walking and he's seen that he caught her Aunt Jemima standing out by the fence by the gate of the fence around there and as he started walk on she said hello parson he said how did you know how were the bugs that I've seen you coming I seen you coming amen and she begin to tell the story said hey you remember the Bible God the shooter mount woman she begin to identify herself in the world a man I'll be that's one thing you need to do to get that dinner power itself in the Word of God she said I'm just like that woman a man oh that's not what I want to do say God and begin to identify and thank God and if you've got a problem amen identify yourself in the scripture or some Bible character and if God will work it out for them they did work it out for you you know man and so she what she he she said possum then she remember and then she wanted to them and she wasn't concerned about history she didn't know he didn't care about this minute about Indiana kid meta feel a get them before healing the

before Oh God helping allele in such a way Lord but when I get down on my knees Lord and that they will recognize that hey I spoke with the Lord before he has that personal relationship hey man that's what I was hey man hallelujah and y'all know the story what happened oh but what the point I was trying to make is that she talked them before she knew him she had that personal relationship with them

hearts on fire they meant to gently love him hey man I want to draw flee love him hey man drop me the Bible says the joy of the Lord is our strength you know joy comes from it's different than happiness happiness in order to be had happy happy something that has that happen because that's where it comes from that happened in order for you to be happy in other words they have to sing you're right the favorite song somebody has to sing your favorite special hell you be hey have to get the raise on the job and you'll be happy you have to do this ripping jack has to shake your hand if you don't you won't be happy if they don't sing your favorite song you won't be happy if you don't get the raise on the job you won't be happy but joy comes from a different source altogether that comes when the creator to sell and if they don't sing my favorite song then for the jack don't shake my hand I'm still got that joy of the Lord and the joy the Lord is my strength oh they draw near to me with their heart when their lips but their heart is far from them god help me not to have my heart far from you this morning a man again the scripture says mark 12 33 and to love him with all the

said you'll earn wages to put them in bags for the holes they can send consider your ways you so much but you reap little in other words I like what somebody sitting like this one time you've got what you rolling but you lost what you had you wanted that big raise on the job you'd like that but you lost what you had your time that you spent in prayer a man you got what you wanted but you lost what

all that but now we care about everything else a man we can all everything else about everything else hey man instead of him we care more about doing this and doing that instead of coming to the house of God amen now let's look at this where did we lose our first look to the world when we didn't have nothing hey man we have but now we got more than we used to but less grace for one another hey man oh we got more than what we used to have when we didn't have hardly anything we fellowship we called each other over as they come eat supper with me let's have fellowship with each other but now we got more we don't have time to fellowship with one another amen we got less grace for one another than what we had hey man maybe we were little been closer to God when we had nothing than one yeah we got a whole lot more cuz we knew we had to depend on God but now we depend on their insurance and ain't get night knocking alone that hey that's alright you've got a good job and thunder'd insurance I use it what do we depend on that or than we depend on God when you're in churches ran out a man with everything like our friends hey cut all he has can't do it I can't do nothing else god help me to

of that things are ain't knocking all that but let me depend on God well I'm going to that doctor say God you get the doctor ability you're doing the education God have you help them to help me but that's how you gonna do it Lord but Lord if you want to do a miracle I'm wrong for that too hey man hey man we didn't have a whole lot we was closer to God which is closer one another like I said we had more grace for one another now we got a whole lot more we don't have grace for one another hey man too much with the worldly copy first look hey man when we head up no company would shoot us but the but did you know it would suit us and we if it didn't it didn't all right in order I'm playing I'm dedicating my life to you but now we got company worldly company an ungodly boyfriend I'm darling a girlfriend and that's alright Lord I'd rather take that than take your words and god help us the scripture says over there proverbs get a person can a person take finds his bosom and not be burned you ever heard that old sayin I used to hear years ago you came like that if you lay down with the dogs you'll get up with the fleas a man or whatever god help us this morning hey man knock we better be careful who we choose to hang with a man well we're gonna be careful who we choose to run with amen if they get me closer to God than God I asked you to help me Lord to just assemble myself from them so I could get closer to you or if they're driving me further away from your Lord then help me Lord to get back to what I was once was let me get back to my first love amen all we talked about the election amen and then things alright because I believe in election we talk about our calling hey I believe God's called us we talk about we talk about sanctification nobody we needed to see Levi sanctified live a holy life amen but sometimes we forget the pit well we were dug out of you take this in the world out there in the world have been around some you take people sometimes they get promoted they do the same kind of job you do work right beside you like you do but they get commode promoted and get to a supervision supervisors position they forget where they came from they forget and they won't you I told one God this time this place that funny but I remember me and this one guy was working together and this God we worked on Saturday Saturday was overtime so we worked in and the boss he'd like to get in there and work with us to get the job done we had to stay the full eight hours but he wanted the supervisor our boss wanted us to get finished by two o'clock and have everything cleaned up all of our equipment put away and then we could hide - four o'clock he said I don't want to see you - time to clock out well remember this one guy he said we got to this place we was doing some cleaning he got the discipline right room where you can sit down and smokey said David I got to just have a cigarette so you went in there so I went in there with him he sat down about that time the boss came in there he said what are y'all doing sit down said y'all need to get him get finished well they had a layoff and my boss got laid off well six months later this guy that I was working with he got promoted to supervisor and he said something to me one day and I said hey his name was Jerry I said hey Jerry you remember back then when he said all right David be quiet he didn't want to admit they forgot where he come from God let me not forget that bidois came from lord I was lost and and died without God inside but you reach down your hand for me it was Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me I don't want to forget my desire to live for Jesus it's my desire to live for him then you could see really probably from to where I'm at now you would know the reason why I love him soul a man a man he brought me from my body long way it's my desire to live from him amen I don't want to forget the pit where he dug me out of put my feet on rock to stay hey man hey man we lost referred by the neglect in communion with him hey man you know that's my wife there and she's my we love one another but Warner today we said to one another although we be married but we can talk to one another normal one what a miserable marriage that would be what about you to the Lord he said that room before the foundational world he slipped that band of predestinated unmerited grace upon your anger you're married to a man he wants to talk to you he wants to talk back to you hey man I want to talk to him hey man I want to talk to him said boy I Love You Lord words can't express how much I love you Lord but I want to try with all month with all that's possible within me my human ability Lord say how much I love you I want to have that sweet communion with him hey man oh I remember there was this lady who ran a story about this lady and she sitting like this he said she said you know it would be nice and we could get together all the apostle's she was talking about that all the apostle's and everybody and we just had one big church meeting we could hear but we could hear what Paul said we could hear Peters testimony we could hear all these testimonies we can hear all about this one big one big meeting I've got mine and you think about it today would it be nice to have one big meeting somewhere central located and we could hear brother Donnie and brother golden and brother Tim Purdon different brothers you know and the people that we look up mighty to your pastor my path we could hear all that we could hear their testimonies and all that that would be good that would be good all I'd love to have a meeting like that with you but what about our own personal walk with God it'd be nice to hear all of them it'd be nice to have a meeting like that amen but one of what they're doing for me what about my personal life did they hear their testimonies in him preach at all preacher for the any richer Brotherhood great you brother Jack that's good but what about my own personal life my own time of prayer my own personal closet of worship and attitude toward him it'd be all right to have them kind of means not knocking it I'd be all for it but what about my personal life what's it doing for me amen my own closet it's kept me out of my own closet my own personal walk with God then all that preaching with it listen to all the good singing I would listen to all the testimonies would be in vain if you kept me out of my own personal experience of personal walk with God hey man oh Christ depends upon our nearness to him he must be our friend and we must stick close to him as he does hey man he must stick to him he must be closer than a brother or we never have our first love hey man you know why Pluto or whatever they come up with another planet but you know why it's the coldest how many knows why it would be the coldest planet furthest from the Sun why do we get so cold every now man because we're getting far away from the soe n hey man we ain't close to the Esso n should be and because we're close to there so in like we should be we become cold when you come down and the churches spent at Dennis quill o'clock midnight man and we try to get people to get in there and worship God but because we disclosed through the Esalen as we used to be we can't get nobody to say hey man we can't get nobody to raise our hands we can't get nobody to watch we lost our first love can I read you some things the Prophet said he said now I tell you jesus said you are the salt of the earth but the salt lost its savor it is his fourth good for nothing but to be trod under the feet of men and I say tonight brethren that the church when it's lost its love it's lost its Savior and now we become a laughing block no matter how many gifts we got how many miracles we can perform how many anything first Corinthians tells us that though I speak with tongues of men and of angels I can move mountains with faith I give all my goods to the poor but I haven't got love I am nothing you lost the song when you lose low when you lose the love and so does the same it is it in the context there's only one thing left for the world the church to do that's to be salty and God will make the world thirsty like you that's right they'll close to be like you if you'll just be salty but we've lost that you want to be like you let me go outside I wonder I preached the message years ago what would church be like if it was like you wouldn't start on time - some of us be late if it's left up to some of us we wouldn't raise your hands if it was to worship Him if it was left up to some of us cuz we don't raise our hands if it's Church was like here what would be like help us Lord Thomas or again he says he said I don't care if you're Methodist Baptist Pentecostal Presbyterian expert Aaron come let us rejoice together when that time come when the church burnings brotherly love amen when the church finds its holy decency when the church finds its place in Christ in a call to the other members of money come and rejoice with us God wants to church the love heal a man because he went over here in the first to loosen his lost her sock light the Methodist churches lost in their life the Baptist churches lost her life the Pentecostal church has lost her life every light seems to be going what about me and you what about me I get he says and then tomorrow night talking in the Philadelphia Church age and then tomorrow night when it goes out just at the end you'll notice the angel appears right the end time and just at the end times will rebuke the church for losing its first love and how it's got away from God like they did them to the their the ages and at that time the rapture comes to take the church home their church goes up just at that time of the message and we we are nearing that age now did you get that alright see just at the time the angel the Church of messenger the age comes in to rebuke you for losing their first love brain trying to bring them back same thing to mention toward us tonight Angela comes back to rebuild them each age like that for what they had done so that makes my lap over in each every of the church ages this lap over one another for like that like climbing up as a step it's laying in laps like that going on they said it comes to their abuse why because they lost her love and this and this of this again he says our Heavenly Father we can see Lord that the church has lost its first love we can see that the church is fooled all over the nation has dropped not only the nation but the world we realized that she spoke the other morning and said that the seaton time is over here but the only place the sow seeds is in the foreign fields this is AG leaning over the stubble and Oh God rooted in words was right and now tonight when we see those precious ones as made a start a fair showing in the flesh trying to move up they realize that their lives don't coat up with a word there's something wrong somewhere they got pleasure tempers and in differences no God are ugly things that makes them behave and not act like Christians they found themselves not satisfied that weren't about from one organization to another from one place to another brother that was in 1962 what about it now we see the same thing happening people not satisfied going from here to there wondering is that there mrs. Sunday yeah time to get back Lord amen he said it's the so women of a seed it's it's over here he said they said they're just a gleam now help us again he says and now father that was you not Solomon that was you and Jesus where he said God was in Christ reconciling the world tencel he was the beginning of the creation his body was the Redeem creation and now for the ages the church lost its first love and then in the last days you promised to call no minority the little flock at the last days but our hearts are jumping and my heart's a pounding when I think of that and know that your words are true none of them can fail that these people today understand that let the centre seek you at this hour before the gates closed and there'll be no more time let the brightest she starts getting out of step from this and that base she come back into step as a vision showed it a few weeks ago y'all remember that vision - screaming get back in line get back and step god help me this morning to get back in stem help me to get back in step Lord hey man we looked at what our first love was we look where did we lose our first love look at this what I mean you got to do dis mornin is to seek to have our first leverage door brothers and sisters young people today though we be a child of God and I believe we all are here this morning our children of God amen but if we've lost our first love trouble is in your hand I don't care who you are today what's your name maybe have we lost her first love trouble is near hand from the Lord loveth he Jason if the scripture says he'll take the rod of my love cools God to let my love cool but if it does take that rod your word and get me back in line help me to get back in step like I once was lord help me to get back up there you know I was thinking you know the brother Quentin told me said going down there and you know together to hell I don't know how many came this morning but I commend you all for that like man you don't find too many churches that have per meetings anymore they get together I wonder what the world would say to us because when you first came you remember we talked about when we first met God our first love was blazing burnin we did things that seem ridiculous to the world they could call prayer meeting that church would be there but I wonder what the world says now they look at us we weren't beside people and they say oh yeah y'all haven't / meet tonight yep we ain't going what they think what they say oh I thought y'all went to church this time in this time yeah they got Church but you know I don't believe it's important to go all the time so I'm just gonna hang on go wonder what they think what people look at when they see us whatever when the children of Israel when they had to turn their backs in battle you remember when Joshua chosen hey the Lord promised and he fell in his place and lo you promised and then I wonder what happened when we turn our backs in battle and we die amen and we die without the Lord I wonder what people would say he lacked Morrow and strength and he died he just drifted away because he lacked strength in that marrow see if we'd lost her first love was I ever a child of God at all something to ask yourselves Bible says they went out from us because they were not of us might not think that I repented and really are not fully repented all I say Lord if I need to repent this morning I want to repent I want a full repeal if I have to make things right I want to make things right Lord then we not paid that I really repented and I have not helped me Lord may not be said that I only thought that I had love for Christ or love to Christ and never had it at all I don't want that to be said about me hey man may not be true me that I am as a wandering star for whom is reserved blackness of Darkness forever may not think that I'm a child of God but I but thank it but may I know that I know I know but I really know this morning before this service is over yeah I am really born again I am really a child of God are there some here this morning I'm talking to myself does are there some that profess but they don't possess what they profess we hear people I've heard of people saying they get up I heard her sister one time she got up saying I'm sheltered in the arms of God so let the dark clouds rise as throne clouds row I'm sheltered in the arms of God you've heard that song then all of a sudden something happens her husband go through a divorce he was a minister he quit preaching she went to the world where's that shelter at and she's something about that she was sheltered maybe not just saying about it but let it be a reality that I'm sheltered in the arms of Almighty God amen it is my shelter let the storm clouds rise let the devil do whatever he wants to I'm sheltered in the alarms of the Almighty God I go to church but I don't really possess I just go to be going all right in prayer meeting but I'm not really converted I
