[52:52] couples that were able to come out
[52:53] on yesterday we had a wonderful time of
[52:56] fellowship
[52:57] and uh now we want to turn to trying to
[53:00] do something for the whole church
[53:02] um just my desire for us to maybe
[53:05] do a picnic or something like that so i
[53:08] will keep you all
[53:09] posted and give you a date a man and uh
[53:12] but we just want to have some fellowship
[53:14] we're going to be intentional
[53:15] about sticking together amen uh this
[53:19] year
[53:19] the devil just you know come to try to
[53:21] divide us and just
[53:23] you know that that's that's ain't number
[53:25] the devil for the devil
[53:27] you know and um i'm i'm looking forward
[53:30] to a place that we can go in got to
[53:32] worry about no more viruses
[53:34] uh we gotta worry about you know getting
[53:36] sick no more
[53:37] that day is coming it's coming soon so
[53:40] i'm under expectation for
[53:42] amen but uh but we do appreciate
[53:44] everyone coming out and being a part of
[53:45] that on yesterday
[53:47] um i'm turning here to psalms 107. i
[53:50] believe uh
[53:51] brother solomon was reading from 106 is
[53:53] that right
[53:54] uh so sometimes as a minister you're
[53:57] looking for
[53:58] just little things that would help
[54:00] solidify you going in the right
[54:02] direction
[54:03] uh because this is the sermon that i
[54:05] want to bring to you today is something
[54:06] that i was
[54:07] i was trying to push it just you know
[54:09] just no i'm not
[54:10] no no no lord no and i come to find out
[54:13] that every time i fight god he always
[54:15] win
[54:18] so i say lord okay i'ma just i'ma just
[54:20] yield and i'm gonna just let you have
[54:23] the preeminence we we find sometimes
[54:26] that god's thoughts and not like our
[54:28] thoughts
[54:29] and his ways are not like our ways and i
[54:31] just felt like this sermon challenged
[54:33] me amen and just my thinking
[54:36] about certain things and you know it's
[54:38] okay amen we need to be challenged
[54:41] and uh my prayer uh this morning is that
[54:43] if revelation
[54:44] is beyond us that we will look up
[54:48] and ask god for it amen
[54:52] so let's read here in this uh psalms 107
[54:57] and uh it states to us
[55:01] uh oh give thanks
[55:06] the lord praise god
[55:10] for he is good
[55:13] amen god's been good to me
[55:18] for his mercy endureth forever
[55:22] praise the name of the lord and then uh
[55:25] the next verse
[55:26] uh tells us here uh
[55:29] let the redeemed
[55:32] of the lord say so
[55:36] whom he hath redeemed from the hand of
[55:39] the enemy amen amen the lord of the
[55:42] blessing to reading of his word shall we
[55:44] pray
[55:45] amen father we are uh
[55:49] grateful for the reading of the word but
[55:52] we know the holy spirit wants to speak
[55:55] something to us
[55:56] this morning so god as it was just
[55:59] stated
[56:00] revelations beyond us help us to look up
[56:02] and just ask you for it and that's
[56:04] exactly what we do now
[56:06] um your prophet has shared some things
[56:09] with
[56:10] us things that we can fellowship around
[56:12] and
[56:13] god and um just the way that he brought
[56:15] the word
[56:16] it challenges everybody's thinking
[56:19] uh denominations are challenged and and
[56:22] everybody else
[56:23] uh almost like uh when you came and you
[56:27] stood on the uh on the face of this
[56:29] earth and you just made a statement that
[56:31] shook a church
[56:32] it said unless you eat my flesh
[56:36] and drink my blood you have no part with
[56:38] me and
[56:39] you did it and didn't explain it uh god
[56:42] you uh you you allowed your prophet to
[56:44] say certain things lord and i just
[56:46] prayed it as we would just enter into
[56:48] some of these things that he said that
[56:49] you would help us lord to
[56:51] catch what he was trying to tell us and
[56:54] uh lord we know
[56:56] uh you he was vindicated we know he was
[56:58] elected he was chosen he was
[57:00] predestinated according to scripture
[57:02] to come and speak certain things to us
[57:04] the lord as we just try to
[57:05] endeavor upon this thought lord use it
[57:08] for your glory hide us all behind the
[57:09] cross
[57:10] that we might not be seeing but may
[57:12] christ be on display today it's in jesus
[57:14] name we pray
[57:15] amen and amen god bless you you can be
[57:18] seated
[57:18] in the presence of the lord amen
[57:22] um you all know that i have been um
[57:26] on this journey of uh the junctions we
[57:29] wanted to
[57:30] we still have a a few more junctions
[57:33] that we want to preach you know brother
[57:34] branham talked about
[57:36] seven junctions and we just the lord
[57:39] just been leading me to
[57:40] just take each junction and to bring
[57:43] that you know to the church
[57:45] uh but this morning we
[57:48] have what i would call uh interruption
[57:52] in the series amen amen just a little
[57:56] interruption
[57:57] uh in the series and and i didn't even i
[58:00] forgot to bring
[58:01] a particular quote that i that i read um
[58:04] but um nonetheless i think it'll be
[58:06] something that would be very very
[58:07] helpful for us
[58:09] uh i forgot i see orion there good to
[58:12] see you
[58:12] uh brother ryan god bless you amen um
[58:16] i want to just take the subject the
[58:19] redeeming
[58:20] attribute amen the redeeming
[58:24] attribute and um
[58:27] just a couple things that we want to
[58:30] start off here with and i'll start with
[58:33] the sermon identify christ of all ages
[58:38] here the prophet makes the statement
[58:42] now god is is a great
[58:46] like a great being in the beginning god
[58:49] see he wasn't even god
[58:52] uh to begin with god is an object of
[58:55] worship
[58:56] and he was called there was nothing to
[58:58] worship
[58:59] he was self-existent elohim
[59:02] and there wasn't nothing to worship him
[59:05] when he created angels
[59:07] then there was something to worship him
[59:10] a man but in this
[59:13] great god uh elohim
[59:17] was attributes uh there was
[59:20] attributes in there to be god
[59:25] now just catch that right he wasn't god
[59:28] but because he had nothing to worship
[59:30] him
[59:31] but there were attributes in him to be
[59:34] god
[59:35] amen in order to become god then he had
[59:38] to create
[59:39] something to worship him and there's
[59:41] where the angels come in
[59:43] all right so he says uh uh
[59:46] the there was attributes in there to be
[59:48] god
[59:49] attributes to be father
[59:53] attributes to be son all right
[59:56] it says in attributes to be savior
[1:00:00] attributes to be healer all these
[1:00:03] attributes was in god and if you've ever
[1:00:06] got eternal life
[1:00:08] you were in god's attributes
[1:00:12] amen because you got eternal life jesus
[1:00:15] came
[1:00:16] as redeemer and redeemed
[1:00:19] means bring it back to where it started
[1:00:24] from
[1:00:25] oh glory to god bring it back
[1:00:28] to where it started from right you were
[1:00:31] in god's thinking
[1:00:32] he might have had to breathe this with
[1:00:34] that and down here and down here you
[1:00:36] know and and i'll just leave it right
[1:00:38] there
[1:00:38] uh but uh but you know he's we were in
[1:00:41] god's thinking
[1:00:42] jesus came to redeem and bring us
[1:00:46] back to a specific place hallelujah
[1:00:49] church amen
[1:00:50] now i want to just uh uh maybe we'll go
[1:00:53] up a little further here another quote
[1:00:55] here
[1:00:56] uh the fundamental foundation for faith
[1:00:59] amen we
[1:01:00] want to just try to lay a background uh
[1:01:03] here
[1:01:03] for what we want to say this redeeming
[1:01:05] attribute
[1:01:07] uh he says man was made
[1:01:11] as a secondary god on earth
[1:01:14] he was given the power to control
[1:01:18] all things so this is something that
[1:01:20] he's bringing us back to
[1:01:21] to be able to control all things all
[1:01:24] elements
[1:01:25] of the earth that was adam adam was
[1:01:28] given these great powers
[1:01:30] but then the power that he was given
[1:01:33] to make himself is where he
[1:01:37] oh my amen the power that adam was given
[1:01:42] to make himself is where he failed says
[1:01:45] and
[1:01:45] adam could speak to the winds and it
[1:01:48] would stop
[1:01:49] he could speak to the trees and they
[1:01:51] would obey him
[1:01:53] he could speak to the wildlife it would
[1:01:55] obey him
[1:01:56] he could speak to the waters ever what
[1:01:58] it is everything
[1:02:00] obeyed adam no struggle at all
[1:02:03] everything obeyed him says now that is
[1:02:06] the beginning of man
[1:02:08] uh that's what god that's what god
[1:02:11] give him power over everything on the
[1:02:14] earth now through the fall
[1:02:15] he lost that power then he becomes
[1:02:19] unconscious of the fact after losing his
[1:02:22] relationship
[1:02:23] and friendship fellowship with the
[1:02:25] father then he lost that and
[1:02:27] all of his great channels become clogged
[1:02:30] up
[1:02:30] and he couldn't get through hallelujah
[1:02:33] this
[1:02:34] is where we have been for a number of
[1:02:35] years uh all clogged up and we need to
[1:02:38] get through
[1:02:39] amen i pray that the holy ghost
[1:02:42] amen will become a plumber of this
[1:02:45] morning amen brother
[1:02:48] and get the clog out a spiritual plumber
[1:02:52] we need to get some clogs out
[1:02:55] hey hallelujah amen says uh
[1:02:58] uh because you got eternal life uh i'm
[1:03:00] sorry i'm in the wrong he says um
[1:03:02] uh i've become unconscious of the fact
[1:03:04] after losing his relationship fellowship
[1:03:06] with the father then he lost that
[1:03:08] and all of his great channels become
[1:03:09] clogged up and he couldn't get through
[1:03:11] now what adam was
[1:03:13] in god what adam was
[1:03:17] in god christ
[1:03:25] these are this is a past tense
[1:03:28] thing that we're talking about here
[1:03:30] christ
[1:03:31] has redeemed us back to that
[1:03:35] says now a redeemer to redeem anything
[1:03:38] is to bring it back to its origin again
[1:03:42] hallelujah now i i want you to just try
[1:03:44] to stay with me here
[1:03:46] you know we said that there were
[1:03:47] attributes in god
[1:03:49] now you know i don't believe that those
[1:03:51] uh attributes just stayed in god by
[1:03:53] us becoming sons and daughters of god
[1:03:57] some of those attributes are actually
[1:03:59] inside of us
[1:04:01] hallelujah you know the attribute to be
[1:04:03] father
[1:04:04] every young man wants to find himself a
[1:04:06] wife
[1:04:07] so he can also become father
[1:04:10] come on praise the lord every young lady
[1:04:13] is looking for a husband
[1:04:15] so she can become mother amen these
[1:04:18] things are already inside of us when we
[1:04:20] are
[1:04:21] born these these attributes if i can
[1:04:23] just call them these
[1:04:24] genes that was inside of god they're now
[1:04:27] laying inside of us
[1:04:30] bless it be the name of the lord
[1:04:32] hallelujah
[1:04:33] amen i think this is why we have uh uh
[1:04:36] we get a certain feeling or emotion for
[1:04:39] somebody
[1:04:40] when they get sick amen we want to
[1:04:42] actually see them made well
[1:04:45] amen we'll put in a prayer request
[1:04:47] because we want to see them
[1:04:48] made well we'll actually go and lay
[1:04:51] hands on them
[1:04:52] hallelujah because we realize if we lay
[1:04:55] hands on the sick
[1:04:57] come on somebody
[1:04:59] [Applause]
[1:05:00] you know the bible say just lay hands on
[1:05:03] the sick
[1:05:04] and they will recover and what the
[1:05:06] prophet said it said it didn't say
[1:05:08] pray
[1:05:09] [Music]
[1:05:11] when when we talking about that
[1:05:13] scripture it actually did not say
[1:05:16] pray it said lay hands
[1:05:20] well if you lay hands on the sick and
[1:05:22] they recover
[1:05:23] who's healing who's doing the healing is
[1:05:25] god
[1:05:26] inside of you doing the healing
[1:05:30] if you're a sinner you can't lay hands
[1:05:31] on nobody but if your holy ghost feel
[1:05:34] believable hallelujah
[1:05:38] all authority that's in heaven is now
[1:05:40] inside of you
[1:05:42] i didn't bring the quote but i have it
[1:05:44] brother branham said you know
[1:05:45] i say that the same um he said that same
[1:05:48] god that stood out on the invisible
[1:05:50] platform
[1:05:51] and said let there be light and there
[1:05:53] was life he said that same
[1:05:55] god that creative power is laying and
[1:05:59] sitting inside
[1:06:00] those that are filled with the holy
[1:06:02] ghost
[1:06:04] so you got creative power in you that's
[1:06:07] an attribute of god
[1:06:09] hallelujah right amen you have that
[1:06:12] attribute to want to be a father i want
[1:06:13] to be a mother
[1:06:15] oh my there's so many other attributes
[1:06:17] that were in god that are now inside of
[1:06:19] us
[1:06:20] let's look at this amen a little bit
[1:06:22] more i want to talk about this
[1:06:23] redemption this redemptive
[1:06:25] attribute amen that the redeeming
[1:06:28] attribute now
[1:06:29] uh just um let me give you a couple
[1:06:31] definitions on this redemption
[1:06:33] praise the lord amen redemption means
[1:06:37] deliverance by payment of a price
[1:06:41] salvation from sin death and the wrath
[1:06:44] of god by christ's sacrifice
[1:06:47] amen and also in the old testament
[1:06:49] redemption was applied to
[1:06:51] property it was applied to animals
[1:06:54] it was applied to persons and the nation
[1:06:57] of israel as a whole
[1:06:58] in nearly every instance freedom from
[1:07:02] obligation freedom from bondage
[1:07:05] freedom from danger i mean or danger was
[1:07:07] secured by the payment of a price
[1:07:10] also it was a ransom a bribe a
[1:07:13] satisfaction
[1:07:14] a sum of money paid to obtain freedom
[1:07:17] favor
[1:07:17] or reconciliation all right in the new
[1:07:20] testament
[1:07:20] when uh redemption is kind of emphasized
[1:07:23] it's talking about the tremendous cost
[1:07:25] that christ had to pay
[1:07:27] on the cross amen for our sins
[1:07:31] amen this is this is all a part of
[1:07:34] redemption
[1:07:35] let me let me let me make that very
[1:07:37] clear see
[1:07:38] i want to i want to uh say i'm picking
[1:07:41] up a diamond
[1:07:42] this morning i'm picking up this diamond
[1:07:45] of redemption and uh and when you pick
[1:07:48] up the diamond just depending on how you
[1:07:50] shine it
[1:07:51] uh uh in the sun depending on what angle
[1:07:54] it hits it'll it'll reflect a different
[1:07:56] sparkle
[1:07:57] glory to god so one of the sparkles that
[1:07:59] i could give you is the sparkle of what
[1:08:01] christ
[1:08:02] did for us glory to god amen another
[1:08:05] spark i could give you is what happened
[1:08:07] in the old testament
[1:08:09] glory to god before christ died on the
[1:08:11] cross i can give you that sparkle
[1:08:12] so so this morning we just hope that the
[1:08:14] lord will just help us see something
[1:08:16] here in some of the quotes that i want
[1:08:18] to provide all right
[1:08:20] let's go here's uh here's uh something
[1:08:23] that just shook me this week to my core
[1:08:25] amen glory glory glory are you ready for
[1:08:28] this
[1:08:29] amen i was just kind of sharing
[1:08:31] something on the on the phone on a
[1:08:33] little fellowship call that i do in the
[1:08:35] morning and
[1:08:35] one of the brothers uh commented after i
[1:08:38] had uh talked that morning we were
[1:08:40] actually
[1:08:40] uh talking about revelation chapter four
[1:08:43] and uh and some things that you know
[1:08:44] that i was bringing out there
[1:08:46] and uh and after after the after the uh
[1:08:48] the conversation after the
[1:08:50] the little fellowship the brother said
[1:08:52] you know uh brother's just something how
[1:08:54] you know we were talking about the uh
[1:08:56] the speckled birds
[1:08:58] amen and the great speckled bird and
[1:09:00] brother branham talked about
[1:09:01] how in leviticus that they took one bird
[1:09:04] and they killed them and then they put
[1:09:05] the blood
[1:09:06] on the living bird they took two one was
[1:09:08] killed and then they put the blood on
[1:09:09] the living one
[1:09:10] and it says and that was christ dying
[1:09:12] but then the living bird was
[1:09:14] us as the bride and we were going across
[1:09:16] the earth
[1:09:17] fluttering our wings with the blood of
[1:09:19] the dead bird
[1:09:21] on us because brother branham said the
[1:09:23] the bride has become the blood of
[1:09:26] jesus see uh these are statements
[1:09:30] these are statements that uh that
[1:09:32] challenge our thinking he
[1:09:34] said the bride
[1:09:37] is the blood of the lord jesus
[1:09:41] so i had to go back to the scripture to
[1:09:43] identify how did the bride become the
[1:09:46] blood
[1:09:47] and brother branham's shoulder say say
[1:09:49] it was that it was that that that
[1:09:50] that that that that that the dead uh the
[1:09:53] blood of the dead bird was sprinkled
[1:09:54] onto
[1:09:55] you know the the living bird and that
[1:09:57] living bird had to go out through the
[1:09:58] earth just fluttering his wings
[1:10:00] crying holy holy holy unto the lord and
[1:10:03] that's how
[1:10:04] that that that that bird became the
[1:10:06] blood
[1:10:08] all right all right so you know we were
[1:10:10] fellowshipping around that and
[1:10:12] brothers say you know there's just that
[1:10:14] just really struck me brother jack and
[1:10:16] this just kind of helped add to you know
[1:10:19] just a little quote that i was looking
[1:10:21] at
[1:10:21] and this is how god's gifts always find
[1:10:24] their places now
[1:10:25] i love the title i love the title
[1:10:30] god's gifts always finds
[1:10:34] their places now this is deeper than
[1:10:36] just finding your place in
[1:10:38] church this is finding your place
[1:10:41] in christ
[1:10:45] recognizing who you are right
[1:10:48] so so now watch this statement amen that
[1:10:51] that is made here in this sermon
[1:10:53] brother random says mary the mother of
[1:10:56] jesus in the city of nazareth the
[1:11:00] meanest city there was in the land
[1:11:02] but out of there god chose a little lady
[1:11:06] to give birth to his son an incubator
[1:11:11] a womb he says there had to be a baby
[1:11:13] had to be born by
[1:11:14] he took such a person to it now
[1:11:16] understand this the reason that god god
[1:11:18] uh uh because of what adam
[1:11:20] lost in the beginning hallelujah take
[1:11:23] that down just for a second
[1:11:25] because of what adam lost in the
[1:11:27] beginning amen
[1:11:28] i i want to i want to say this the right
[1:11:30] way uh adam
[1:11:34] adam couldn't bring eve back to the
[1:11:37] place that she fell from
[1:11:41] redemption is to bring back right now
[1:11:44] adam could not bring eve back to where
[1:11:47] she fell from
[1:11:48] hallelujah this is why we needed a
[1:11:51] kissman redeemer
[1:11:52] christ to bring us back to where mankind
[1:11:55] actually fell from hallelujah
[1:11:59] we realized the importance of needing
[1:12:02] jesus
[1:12:03] in order to bring us back to what was
[1:12:05] lost in the garden
[1:12:06] everything adam lost jesus restored
[1:12:10] hallelujah hallelujah now i i i want us
[1:12:14] to be uh
[1:12:15] on the same page with that we realized
[1:12:17] that but but we have to
[1:12:19] we have to look at all the scripture you
[1:12:22] understand we just can't stop at that
[1:12:24] because we've heard the story of
[1:12:25] redemption for a long time and that's
[1:12:27] real good
[1:12:27] what jesus did was perfect but he
[1:12:29] restored us back to
[1:12:30] everything that adam lost everything
[1:12:35] now let's let's go a little further in
[1:12:37] this quote
[1:12:38] hallelujah this will challenge you
[1:12:42] i'm gonna read it again mary the mother
[1:12:44] of jesus in the city of natural
[1:12:46] the meanest city there was in the land
[1:12:48] but out of there god chose a little lady
[1:12:50] to give birth to his son
[1:12:52] an incubator a womb that had a baby that
[1:12:54] had to be born
[1:12:55] by he took such a person to do it god
[1:13:00] works through human beings
[1:13:03] to reading human
[1:13:07] beings
[1:13:10] i want to say that again god
[1:13:14] works through human beings
[1:13:18] that's plural plural right
[1:13:21] to redeem human
[1:13:24] beings that makes you a part of the
[1:13:27] redemption process
[1:13:30] hallelujah now look at what the prophet
[1:13:32] said says he can
[1:13:34] take you work through
[1:13:37] you to redeem humanity
[1:13:42] [Music]
[1:13:45] now i could just read this and just go
[1:13:47] right over the top of it just act like
[1:13:48] it wasn't even there
[1:13:49] but i got to slow down on that right i
[1:13:52] wait a minute you say god can take me
[1:13:55] now he started to court off by saying
[1:13:57] how
[1:13:58] mary had come from the meanest city
[1:14:00] right and you would look at mary and
[1:14:02] think now how could god use a woman like
[1:14:04] this
[1:14:04] from this mean city to work the process
[1:14:07] of redemption
[1:14:08] and what you got to do is start looking
[1:14:10] at where god brought you from
[1:14:14] where did god lift you up out of what
[1:14:17] city did you come from
[1:14:18] what kind of family background did you
[1:14:21] have
[1:14:22] in order to bring you to where you are
[1:14:24] right now
[1:14:25] i'm telling you here because the grace
[1:14:27] of god has brought you here
[1:14:30] hallelujah glory to god and
[1:14:34] and and and i'm gonna just read the rest
[1:14:36] of this quote but i'm gonna tell you i'm
[1:14:37] gonna get a little ahead of myself
[1:14:38] god wants to take you from the
[1:14:40] environment that you came from
[1:14:43] clean you up change your life turn you
[1:14:46] all around
[1:14:46] to send you back into that environment
[1:14:49] to bring somebody out
[1:14:53] and then god is working through a human
[1:14:56] being
[1:14:57] to bring redemption that's the same
[1:15:00] thing he did with christ now you won't
[1:15:01] be going to no cross
[1:15:04] you won't be going to no cross you're
[1:15:05] not going to do it like that
[1:15:07] hallelujah but redemption comes to what
[1:15:09] we say out of our mouth
[1:15:11] [Music]
[1:15:12] that's why i say let it redeem of the
[1:15:14] lord
[1:15:19] can we just read a little bit more
[1:15:23] god wants god works through
[1:15:26] human beings to redeem
[1:15:31] human beings he can take you
[1:15:35] work through you to redeem humanity if
[1:15:38] you'll completely dedicate everything
[1:15:40] you are
[1:15:42] let's go on if you're a young woman
[1:15:45] dedicate your morals
[1:15:50] hallelujah through the way that you live
[1:15:53] sis
[1:15:55] through the way that you live my brother
[1:15:58] you're bringing somebody to the cross
[1:16:04] you're not doing the work yourself but
[1:16:07] they'll they'll get to the cross through
[1:16:08] your life
[1:16:10] right it says if your young woman
[1:16:12] dedicate your morals
[1:16:13] you're a young man dedicate your morals
[1:16:17] dedicate your mind hallelujah
[1:16:21] oh hallelujah dedicate your thinking
[1:16:24] dedicate your heart dedicate your soul

[1:16:54] course you take your all your mind and
[1:16:56] your thoughts on that north star the sin
[1:16:59] of god and don't move from it stay right
[1:17:01] with it
[1:17:01] it'll bring you straight like that amen
[1:17:03] like it did the magi
[1:17:04] right straight to christ i just love
[1:17:08] this statement it challenged me when i
[1:17:10] read it this week
[1:17:11] god works through human beings to redeem
[1:17:15] human beings
[1:17:18] god works through human beings to redeem
[1:17:22] human beings that tells me that there's
[1:17:24] an attribute
[1:17:26] of redemption that is laying inside of
[1:17:28] the believer
[1:17:30] all right let's go on a little further
[1:17:31] here now
[1:17:33] i think it's good for us to understand
[1:17:35] who we are now this this this
[1:17:36] let me just also make this very clear uh
[1:17:39] i'm gonna read this quote i'm gonna read
[1:17:40] this quote
[1:17:41] out of that day on calvary i'm gonna
[1:17:42] read this now when i read this
[1:17:44] i'm just setting you up i'm letting you
[1:17:46] know ahead of time
[1:17:48] it's gonna actually sound like it's
[1:17:49] contradicting
[1:17:51] what i just said hallelujah but i want
[1:17:54] to bring both sides of it
[1:17:56] i'm trying to walk right down the middle
[1:17:57] of this amen i'm trying to walk right
[1:18:00] down the middle
[1:18:00] you know um we got to understand our
[1:18:03] place do you know as the bride of christ
[1:18:06] because you overcome in the age of
[1:18:08] laodicea
[1:18:10] do you realize what your reward is
[1:18:13] you actually sit in the same throne
[1:18:17] as christ as an overcomer
[1:18:21] you sit in the exact same throne
[1:18:25] as christ hallelujah i was you know
[1:18:28] listening to brother jason
[1:18:30] watkins uh make a statement he says when
[1:18:32] we look at the story of esther
[1:18:34] when she revealed what heyman was
[1:18:37] getting ready to do she was giving
[1:18:39] a man uh a reward the reward by the king
[1:18:42] said i'll give you up to
[1:18:43] half of my kingdom he said that wasn't
[1:18:46] just a physical thing
[1:18:47] he said that was pretty much said i'm
[1:18:49] gonna share my throne with you
[1:18:56] if you got control of half of the
[1:18:58] kingdom that means what you say is
[1:19:00] just as good as what i say
[1:19:05] hallelujah all right let's go on a
[1:19:08] little further listen
[1:19:09] i'm in paragraph 47 on that day on
[1:19:11] calvary look at this
[1:19:13] now let me just let me preface this by
[1:19:15] saying this this
[1:19:16] this this uh this attribute of
[1:19:19] redemption
[1:19:20] you can only express it as you have as
[1:19:22] you have a relationship with christ
[1:19:25] just because you human don't give you
[1:19:27] nothing but it's through a relationship
[1:19:30] with christ
[1:19:31] that brings you back to everything adam
[1:19:34] lost all right let's let's read this
[1:19:38] hallelujah it says
[1:19:42] and when sin struck the earth back in
[1:19:45] the beginning adam and eve states
[1:19:46] all right like a sheet of blackness
[1:19:49] fallen from the heaven
[1:19:51] it literally paralyzed the earth it
[1:19:54] throwed every creature on the earth and
[1:19:56] all of god's creation in bondage man was
[1:19:59] under
[1:19:59] bondage of death so we gotta understand
[1:20:01] what adam and eve did
[1:20:03] it caused us to lose all of this
[1:20:06] hallelujah
[1:20:07] amen we needed a kissman redeemer that's
[1:20:09] why christ had to go to a cross
[1:20:11] and i'm gonna tell you since christ went
[1:20:13] to the cross
[1:20:14] now we can preach sermons like this
[1:20:19] hallelujah glory to god because he
[1:20:21] brings us back to a specific place
[1:20:24] all right stay with me says uh he
[1:20:26] throwed every creature on earth
[1:20:28] and all of god's creation in bondage man
[1:20:30] was on the bondage of death
[1:20:32] sickness trouble sorrows all nature fell
[1:20:34] with him
[1:20:35] sin was a anesthetic that actually
[1:20:38] paralyzed the earth and then we
[1:20:41] set we sat here hopeless because every
[1:20:44] creature on earth
[1:20:46] was subject to it and everyone born on
[1:20:48] earth was subject to it
[1:20:50] so it had to come from some place where
[1:20:53] there was no
[1:20:54] sin it could not come from the earth
[1:20:58] hallelujah in order for us to get to
[1:21:00] this place it couldn't come from the
[1:21:01] earth
[1:21:02] god had to come himself and restore us
[1:21:05] back to this
[1:21:06] so it's only through the blood that you
[1:21:09] can express these
[1:21:10] attributes of redemption he says one of
[1:21:13] us
[1:21:14] could not redeem the other that's why i
[1:21:16] was saying now adam could not
[1:21:17] take eve and put her back in her place
[1:21:19] once she fell from it
[1:21:21] he couldn't take it like that she had
[1:21:22] fallen from a place in christ
[1:21:24] adam when he fell in the garden he
[1:21:26] couldn't redeem himself
[1:21:28] he needed christ to come the second adam
[1:21:30] in order for
[1:21:31] mankind to get back to that place now
[1:21:34] let's try to put this let's try to
[1:21:35] balance this
[1:21:36] hallelujah hallelujah let's call him
[1:21:38] readers says therefore
[1:21:40] says when man realized that he was
[1:21:42] separated from his god
[1:21:43] he became a wanderer they wept they
[1:21:45] cried they tore
[1:21:46] they wandered about uh through the
[1:21:48] mountains and through the desert seeking
[1:21:49] a city whose building maker was god
[1:21:51] for he knew that if he ever got back in
[1:21:54] the presence of god he could talk it
[1:21:55] over
[1:21:56] with him amen but there was no
[1:21:59] way back we're talking about at the
[1:22:01] beginning
[1:22:02] glory to god he becomes lost he didn't
[1:22:04] know which way to turn so he just
[1:22:06] took out wandering trying to find
[1:22:08] somewhere that he could find a way back
[1:22:10] to that place
[1:22:12] amen something on the inside of him told
[1:22:14] him that he come from a place that was
[1:22:16] perfect
[1:22:18] now you know this is what brother
[1:22:19] branham's saying now now i'm reading in
[1:22:21] the statement that he mentioned that is
[1:22:23] one of us couldn't redeem the other
[1:22:25] but the quote before amen he says human
[1:22:28] beings god works through human beings
[1:22:30] to redeem human beings we gotta find
[1:22:32] balance to this
[1:22:33] we gotta find balance now i
[1:22:37] to go forward in this message
[1:22:40] that day on calvary paragraph 84
[1:22:44] hallelujah look at what he says in the
[1:22:48] same sermon
[1:22:50] glory to god church he says
[1:22:53] he was just one man the perfect man
[1:22:57] he gave his life and he made an example
[1:23:04] he made an example for you
[1:23:07] and he says now what must we do
[1:23:10] now the first thing i want to say jesus
[1:23:14] never lived for himself
[1:23:17] his life was spent for others amen
[1:23:20] that's perfectly
[1:23:21] eternal life he says when you say you
[1:23:25] got
[1:23:26] when you say you go to church and you do
[1:23:28] good things that's fine
[1:23:29] he says but when you live your life for
[1:23:32] yourself
[1:23:34] you have an eternal life
[1:23:38] eternal life is living for others
[1:23:42] let's go a little further it proved it
[1:23:45] when it come
[1:23:46] in the lamb of god he lived and had
[1:23:48] eternal life because he did not live for
[1:23:50] himself he lived for others and you
[1:23:52] receive eternal life
[1:23:53] by receiving that day and you don't live
[1:23:55] for yourself the more you
[1:23:56] live for others oh let me let me just
[1:24:00] let me just
[1:24:01] inject something and hold on just put
[1:24:02] that down just for a second
[1:24:04] you know um you know i was listening uh
[1:24:07] brother eugene braun he

[1:24:14] when abraham paid tithes amen to
[1:24:17] melchizedek
[1:24:18] hallelujah when he met melchizedek and
[1:24:20] he paid tithes
[1:24:21] he says uh the ties was actually the
[1:24:23] bible say that
[1:24:24] that that affected four generations all
[1:24:27] the way down to levi

[1:24:33] all the way down to four generations i
[1:24:35] want you to get this
[1:24:37] what you do hallelujah

[1:24:56] generations of your family

[1:31:24] you become the message hallelujah you
[1:31:27] become the bible
[1:31:29] you become redemption
[1:31:34] glory to god let me finish reading this
[1:31:38] quote
[1:31:41] glory hallelujah it says you said
[1:31:44] someone said
[1:31:45] how can you stand and let anybody call
[1:31:47] you such bad names
[1:31:49] you don't live for yourself
[1:31:53] you live for others and you want to know
[1:31:56] why you live
[1:31:57] others you live for others that you
[1:32:02] might redeem that man amen
[1:32:13] so you got a part of this there's an
[1:32:15] attribute of god that must be reflected
[1:32:17] inside of you
[1:32:19] you don't live for yourself you live for
[1:32:22] others that
[1:32:23] you might redeem that man
[1:32:26] you become sons and the trouble of it is
[1:32:29] the church has begot
[1:32:30] they were sons
[1:32:34] i'm going to look i told you this is in
[1:32:35] the same message that day on calvary
[1:32:37] in the same message he says you become
[1:32:40] son the church has forgot that they were
[1:32:42] sons
[1:32:42] you are sons you are taking
[1:32:46] christ's place
[1:32:56] amen amen that's what i said brother
[1:32:58] jose when i read it it challenged me
[1:33:01] i said but the prophet said in god amen
[1:33:05] say i'm not gonna run from this sermon
[1:33:07] i'ma preach it
[1:33:09] i got to be this
[1:33:12] you are sons
[1:33:16] you're taking christ's place you're a
[1:33:19] son so you don't live for yourself
[1:33:21] live for others
[1:33:24] amen that means you got to die to
[1:33:26] yourself just like christ died on the
[1:33:28] cross
[1:33:28] praise god you have the sacrifice you
[1:33:31] got
[1:33:32] not my will but your will be done
[1:33:35] because see you're not you're not just
[1:33:36] showing up on a job just to get a
[1:33:38] paycheck
[1:33:39] that's just part of it
[1:33:43] but you're showing up there because
[1:33:44] somebody needs redemption
[1:33:47] and god uses human beings
[1:33:51] to redeem human beings
[1:33:58] i i i want this to just get heavy on the
[1:34:00] church
[1:34:01] i want i want i want you to feel the
[1:34:03] weight of what the prophet is saying to
[1:34:05] us
[1:34:06] god uses human beings to redeem
[1:34:10] human beings let me go on let me go on
[1:34:13] um and he says in this this quote just
[1:34:16] going to it says it says well brother
[1:34:17] branham i can live for this brother
[1:34:20] because he sure is a nice man that's not
[1:34:24] it
[1:34:24] amen live for that man who hates
[1:34:30] you
[1:34:36] live for that man who hates you
[1:34:39] live for the person who killed you if
[1:34:42] they could
[1:34:46] amen that's what they've done to him
[1:34:50] see you taking christ's place so what
[1:34:52] you saw happen in the life of christ
[1:34:54] should also be happening in your life
[1:34:57] that's how you know you're a christian
[1:35:03] live for the person who killed you if
[1:35:04] they could
[1:35:06] that's what they've done to him they
[1:35:08] killed him and he
[1:35:09] died that he might save them
[1:35:14] that's eternal life when you get
[1:35:17] that and when you get it that's in your
[1:35:20] bosom
[1:35:21] you are facing heaven then
[1:35:27] says but you sacrifice your own things
[1:35:30] give them up like the sheep gives its
[1:35:33] wool
[1:35:34] you look on towards calvary
[1:35:38] i just i i have to just drop this in the
[1:35:40] church
[1:35:41] let me just go on a little further amen
[1:35:43] amen amen amen
[1:35:47] here out of the message the king's been
[1:35:48] redeemed i met paragraph 168
[1:35:50] in this sermon now we'll we'll just
[1:35:53] we'll talk a little bit more i drop some
[1:35:55] quotes and then i'll just give you a
[1:35:56] couple examples and
[1:35:58] i'll be done at least it'll be off my
[1:36:00] shoulders
[1:36:01] this was something i was carrying for
[1:36:03] days and just could not get it
[1:36:05] i couldn't shake it so i got to read
[1:36:07] these quotes look at this
[1:36:09] the prophet says this in the kinsmen
[1:36:10] redeemer it says now sons and daughters
[1:36:13] because your sons and daughters sons and
[1:36:16] daughters
[1:36:17] who has the most power before god
[1:36:20] right what is an angel
[1:36:23] an angel's a servant is that right
[1:36:26] they're his servants what are you
[1:36:31] his son and daughter he says who has the
[1:36:35] most power
[1:36:36] in heaven then now i need you to
[1:36:38] understand you are
[1:36:39] living on earth but the quote
[1:36:42] is saying you actually have power
[1:36:46] in heaven now if you have
[1:36:49] power in heaven don't you also think you
[1:36:51] have power
[1:36:53] in earth amen
[1:36:56] and what you bind on earth
[1:36:59] will be bound in heaven and what you
[1:37:02] lose on earth will be loosed in heaven
[1:37:10] says he says this que he asks a question
[1:37:13] who has the most power in heaven then
[1:37:15] a sinner that's been saved by grace or
[1:37:18] an
[1:37:18] archangel that's standing by his right
[1:37:21] side
[1:37:23] he says the sinner that's been saved by
[1:37:26] grace
[1:37:27] has more authority in heaven
[1:37:31] than the archangel that stood by sight
[1:37:33] without sin
[1:37:35] [Music]
[1:37:36] because he's a son and a son has more
[1:37:39] authority than a servant of course
[1:37:41] oh we forget what we are we forget many
[1:37:44] times what
[1:37:45] made us what we are see what happened at
[1:37:47] the cross
[1:37:48] is is what put us in this position
[1:37:51] what happened at crossing you accepting
[1:37:53] what happened at the cross this is what
[1:37:54] this is what brings you back to this
[1:37:56] position now let me finish reading this
[1:37:57] quote and i'm gonna read your scripture
[1:37:59] it says we forget many times what made
[1:38:01] us what we are after we become what we
[1:38:03] are
[1:38:03] then we forget how we got here
[1:38:06] now let me read your scripture let's
[1:38:08] let's turn to uh revelation
[1:38:11] one let me give me verse five and six
[1:38:14] see this is not something that you just
[1:38:16] kind of you know
[1:38:18] you're born and you have this no you got
[1:38:20] to come through the sacrifice of the
[1:38:21] cross
[1:38:22] but when you come through the sacrifice
[1:38:24] of the cross it brings you back to a
[1:38:26] place
[1:38:28] hallelujah where you get everything adam
[1:38:30] lost
[1:38:31] now look at revelation 1 verse 5 and 6.
[1:38:33] let's look at this
[1:38:34] amen says and from jesus christ who is
[1:38:37] the faithful witness and the first
[1:38:39] begotten of the dead
[1:38:41] and the prince of the kings
[1:38:44] of the earth hallelujah unto him that

[1:41:26] but it means take a slave from the
[1:41:28] market to redeem

[1:42:04] novice hallelujah amen this is from a
[1:42:08] tour christians
[1:42:09] understanding that god uses human beings
[1:42:12] to redeem human beings
[1:42:13] that you go to work with a purpose a
[1:42:16] purpose now
[1:42:17] you realize this is greater than than
[1:42:20] just getting a paycheck
[1:42:22] i'm here for a purpose every customer
[1:42:24] that god give you those that own your
[1:42:26] own business

[1:42:57] i want to tell you the family that
[1:42:58] you're a part of you're there for a
[1:43:00] purpose
[1:43:01] why is it that you can see the truth and
[1:43:02] they can't
[1:43:04] but i want to tell you something your
[1:43:06] actions will either bring them to the
[1:43:08] truth
[1:43:08] or push them further away and if you
[1:43:11] allow christ to be expressed through you
[1:43:13] then christ can redeem somebody amen
[1:43:17] amen amen
[1:43:20] all right uh oh he says uh
[1:43:23] a man has done something wrong his
[1:43:24] master sold him into slavery action unto
[1:43:26] death
[1:43:27] and he's in the market he's a slave but
[1:43:28] a man comes along a worthy man that's
[1:43:30] able to do it and finds this man
[1:43:32] and and finds grace in the sight he
[1:43:35] redeems
[1:43:36] him the worthy man that finds
[1:43:39] i mean the worthy man that sees somebody
[1:43:41] in bondage he goes pays the price
[1:43:44] he redeems him this is what christ did
[1:43:46] to us
[1:43:47] it says thus take him from the slave
[1:43:49] market
[1:43:50] and takes him out to himself notice and
[1:43:53] that slave once redeemed
[1:43:55] i love this statement the slave once
[1:43:57] redeemed
[1:43:58] can never be sold in the market again
[1:44:02] hey man can never be sold again he he's
[1:44:05] marked he's marked
[1:44:06] and if he was thought if he was thought
[1:44:09] enough of one time to be
[1:44:11] redeemed no one can ever sell him again
[1:44:13] for a slave
[1:44:16] i love that because that just that just
[1:44:18] that just applies to each and every one
[1:44:20] that's been bought by the blood of
[1:44:21] christ we're not going back into the
[1:44:23] devil's market no more
[1:44:26] once i realize i've been redeemed i'll
[1:44:28] never be sold
[1:44:30] into slavery again never
[1:44:35] it says oh thanks be to god that when a
[1:44:38] man has once come to christ and been
[1:44:40] redeemed by the precious blood
[1:44:42] the devil can never make you a slave
[1:44:46] again

[1:45:01] slave once redeemed can never be sold
[1:45:03] again for a slave that's right
[1:45:04] oh i'm so glad i'm so happy to know that
[1:45:07] our kinsmen redeemer that the god of

[1:45:23] of dying paying the full price
[1:45:25] god's spirit witnessing back the temple
[1:45:28] was rent
[1:45:29] the veil from top to the bottom not from
[1:45:31] the bottom to the top from top to the
[1:45:33] bottom

[1:45:36] from above
[1:45:39] really from the top to the bottom open
[1:45:41] the way and the sacrifice
[1:45:43] blocks turned over and the lightning
[1:45:46] fought through the dark angry skies

[1:45:49] day the stars refuse to shine and
[1:45:51] everything give a testimony we
[1:45:52] are redeemed hallelujah amen
[1:45:56] now brother randall said go back to
[1:45:57] leviticus so can we go back to leviticus
[1:46:00] let's turn to leviticus 25.
[1:46:05] leviticus 25 because this is where we
[1:46:07] get god's
[1:46:08] law of redemption amen uh i'm i'm
[1:46:11] starting at verse 25 leviticus 25
[1:46:14] 25 is where i want to read
[1:46:17] amen and there's a lot more here that
[1:46:19] can be read
[1:46:20] but here leviticus 25 25 it says this
[1:46:24] if thy brother be waxing poor now
[1:46:28] remember
[1:46:30] uh god uses human beings
[1:46:33] to redeem human beings now
[1:46:37] when i heard i said lord i gotta find a
[1:46:38] scripture that support this
[1:46:40] and and so the lord take us back
[1:46:42] leviticus 25 so here leviticus 25
[1:46:44] if thy brother be waxing
[1:46:49] poor and have sold away some of his
[1:46:52] possession and if any of his kin
[1:46:55] comes to come to redeem it then shall he
[1:46:58] redeem
[1:46:59] that which is brother soul and if the
[1:47:02] man have none to redeem it
[1:47:05] and himself be able to redeem it then
[1:47:07] let him count
[1:47:08] the years of the sale thereof and
[1:47:10] restore the overplus unto the man
[1:47:12] to whom he sold it that he may return
[1:47:14] unto his possession
[1:47:16] but if he be not able to restore it to
[1:47:18] him then that which is so shall remain
[1:47:21] in the hand of him
[1:47:22] that bought it until the year of jubilee
[1:47:25] and in the jubilee in the jubilee it
[1:47:27] shall go
[1:47:27] out and he shall return unto his
[1:47:29] possession now it goes on
[1:47:31] um uh i'm going to skip over to uh this
[1:47:35] other there's a lot more to read here
[1:47:36] but i'm gonna skip over to
[1:47:37] uh verse four to seven and and other
[1:47:40] thing i want to just kind of get here in
[1:47:41] this year jubilee what it
[1:47:42] what it what it shows if you could just
[1:47:44] get this one thing from the year jubilee
[1:47:46] it shows that at some time amen
[1:47:50] uh those that are in bondage must
[1:47:53] be set free
[1:47:58] what i want to what i want to tell you
[1:48:00] there is a law
[1:48:02] concerning freedom
[1:48:05] there's a law the year jubilee came
[1:48:07] every 50th year and there was a law
[1:48:09] saying i don't care how much
[1:48:11] stuff you lost amen when a year if you
[1:48:14] didn't have the money to get it back
[1:48:15] that's okay
[1:48:17] and when the year jubilee came you were
[1:48:19] gonna get everything you got back
[1:48:21] not just your stuff but even if you sold
[1:48:24] yourself
[1:48:26] into slavery when the year jubilee came
[1:48:29] you were going to go free we don't have
[1:48:31] people blowing
[1:48:32] physical trumpets today hallelujah but
[1:48:36] when the gospel is
[1:48:37] preached then the trumpet is blowing
[1:48:41] and you no longer have to stay bound to
[1:48:43] a devil

[1:54:29] our servants they are my servants whom i
[1:54:31] brought forth out of the land of egypt
[1:54:33] i am the lord your god in this
[1:54:35] particular passage god was showing how
[1:54:37] he used
[1:54:38] humans to redeem other humans
[1:54:42] redemption amen let me just uh
[1:54:45] again just give you a couple more
[1:54:46] definitions and then i'm going to
[1:54:48] something
[1:54:48] redeemed means to buy back it restores
[1:54:51] everything back to the original owner
[1:54:53] also brother branham say redeemed means
[1:54:55] to be taken out of the pawnshop that
[1:54:57] satan has put us in
[1:54:59] our redemption is also to take one from
[1:55:01] the slave take a slave from the market
[1:55:03] and it's through the shedding of the
[1:55:05] blood on the cross
[1:55:07] christ has redeemed us amen we have been
[1:55:10] restored to everything
[1:55:12] that adam lost now i was just kind of
[1:55:14] thinking to myself what are some
[1:55:15] examples in scripture
[1:55:18] outside of what we just read in
[1:55:19] leviticus where a human being
[1:55:22] is being used to redeem a human being
[1:55:25] it's very easy for us to go to the story
[1:55:27] of boaz and ruth
[1:55:29] but here we see boaz uh when he went to
[1:55:32] redeem naomi
[1:55:34] right that's what he was going to do
[1:55:35] this was a human being going to redeem
[1:55:38] naomi
[1:55:38] naomi had lost everything she lost her
[1:55:40] husband she lost her children
[1:55:42] she lost the land she lost everything
[1:55:43] but the only way she can get that back
[1:55:46] is that she had to have a kinsmen
[1:55:47] redeemer
[1:55:49] do the work and and here boaz decides to
[1:55:52] do it but
[1:55:53] in redeeming naomi to restore everything
[1:55:56] that naomi lost
[1:55:57] he also got a gentile bride which was
[1:56:00] ruth we can see it in that story
[1:56:03] yeah amen but what about you know
[1:56:06] because again
[1:56:06] a redemption is to is to bring it back
[1:56:09] to its original owner
[1:56:10] or maybe bring you back to your original
[1:56:13] land your original possession
[1:56:15] amen i could see this also in the story
[1:56:17] of abraham
[1:56:18] and lot hallelujah amen when lord got so
[1:56:22] tangled up down there in sin and sodom
[1:56:25] glory
[1:56:26] amen until that there were kings that
[1:56:28] came down and took over sodom and
[1:56:30] and captured all the people and took
[1:56:32] them a captive

[1:57:02] glory to god he got his his service they
[1:57:04] didn't there was not even a real army
[1:57:06] but they went down by faith taking maybe
[1:57:09] some rakes and all kinds of stuff down
[1:57:11] in a fight or battle
[1:57:13] but when they went down their praise god
[1:57:15] god got into
[1:57:16] those instruments that they were using
[1:57:18] and they won the battle and defeated
[1:57:20] five kings and they recovered a lot in
[1:57:24] everything lot lost
[1:57:27] god used a human being
[1:57:30] to redeem a human being what about david
[1:57:34] when he was fighting with the enemy
[1:57:36] y'all know david one time
[1:57:38] a great man of god he actually went and
[1:57:40] signed up for the enemy's army
[1:57:42] the same army army he defeated they they
[1:57:45] they giant he defeated
[1:57:46] now he's working for the army
[1:57:50] while david's there working for the army
[1:57:51] he was they had a battle that data said
[1:57:53] that we're going to go fight israel
[1:57:55] and uh and the guy david was dealing
[1:57:57] with saying yeah david i trust you come
[1:57:58] on you know let's go down here and fight
[1:57:59] israel
[1:58:00] now and david hardy thinking oh lord how
[1:58:02] i'm gonna fight israel

[1:58:33] story but david had multiple
[1:58:35] opportunities to kill saul
[1:58:37] and david refused to do so
[1:58:40] david would not touch god's anointing so

[1:58:49] when he gets there he fires that all of
[1:58:52] his family
[1:58:53] has been taken captive glory to god the
[1:58:56] bible say
[1:58:57] uh you know david uh david had to do
[1:58:59] something that
[1:59:00] many of us found ourselves having to do

[1:59:03] had to encourage
[1:59:06] himself for the lord i know you're going

[1:59:39] a man that they they kind of threw to

[2:02:00] money and
[2:02:03] when i lived a riot a riotous life
[2:02:06] ungodly life
[2:02:10] but daddy kept praying for that boy and
[2:02:13] mama kept praying for that boy and one
[2:02:14] day god began to deal with that boy's
[2:02:16] heart while he was at the lowest
[2:02:18] state of his life eating with pigs
[2:02:21] and as a uh as a as an israelite he was
[2:02:24] not supposed to have nothing to do with
[2:02:26] pigs that was the lowest job that boy
[2:02:28] could take
[2:02:30] someone's got some loved ones really got
[2:02:32] some low jobs
[2:02:34] you know they they know better than to

[2:02:45] boy and one day while he's sitting there
[2:02:47] in this in this in this
[2:02:48] filthy job in the pig pen uh the the
[2:02:51] holy spirit begin to deal with so you
[2:02:52] know what
[2:02:54] even the servants in my daddy's house
[2:02:56] live better than the way i'm living out
[2:02:57] here
[2:02:59] says you know and it and it took
[2:03:00] something for him to come to the point
[2:03:03] that he had to humble himself
[2:03:05] and go back to daddy's house it took
[2:03:08] something you can imagine what that boy
[2:03:10] was going through
[2:03:11] i know they're going to say this they're
[2:03:12] going gonna say that they're gonna say
[2:03:13] this they're gonna say that and
[2:03:15] and i'm just you know i i don't really
[2:03:17] want to go through all that
[2:03:18] i don't want to hear what daddy got to
[2:03:20] say but the boys say you know what
[2:03:22] still the servants a little better than
[2:03:23] my then then i'm living i'm going back
[2:03:25] to daddy's house
[2:03:26] i know i'm messed up but i'm going back
[2:03:28] home
[2:03:30] now don't be a stumbling block when
[2:03:31] people trying to come back home
[2:03:33] amen
[2:03:35] [Music]
[2:03:37] amen sometimes god uses different
[2:03:39] situations to get people's attention
[2:03:41] to try to bring them back home and god
[2:03:44] wants to use you to redeem
[2:03:46] another human being hear this boy
[2:03:50] say i'm going back i'm coming i'm coming
[2:03:52] home and his daddy could see him from a
[2:03:53] distance
[2:03:54] walking coming daddy got excited told
[2:03:57] mama guess what your boy is on the way
[2:03:59] how you know i can tell by the way he
[2:04:01] walked that's your boy
[2:04:03] and daddy went running from the house
[2:04:05] maybe left the porch ran out there
[2:04:06] to grab his son and just kiss him and
[2:04:08] hug him and say you know son
[2:04:10] i'm happy to have him and it's dad i'm
[2:04:12] happy to be home but daddy don't don't
[2:04:13] say another word
[2:04:14] i got to tell you something daddy what
[2:04:15] is it so i said daddy i'm
[2:04:17] sorry for the way that i
[2:04:20] messed up your name i'm sorry for the
[2:04:22] way i handled myself
[2:04:24] i i'm sorry daddy and i just felt sad
[2:04:26] daddy
[2:04:27] servants in your house live better than
[2:04:29] the way i'm living i don't i know i'm
[2:04:31] not worthy to be called a son but if you
[2:04:33] just let me be a servant
[2:04:37] daddy i'll be all right daddy looked at
[2:04:40] him and said uh
[2:04:41] son i got servants i hired him and i
[2:04:44] fired him and i do all this
[2:04:46] he says but it's one thing different
[2:04:47] about you than no servants
[2:04:49] you were born a son and since you were
[2:04:52] born a son
[2:04:53] you will always be a son
[2:04:58] and it's through the words that daddy
[2:05:00] shared
[2:05:01] that allowed that boy to come back to
[2:05:03] his place
[2:05:04] as sun see human beings
[2:05:08] god uses human beings to redeem
[2:05:11] other human beings our actions
[2:05:15] our thoughts is what kind of brings this
[2:05:18] let me let me let me let me i want to i
[2:05:20] want i want to
[2:05:21] it's what brings it past let me just
[2:05:22] give you uh just a couple more quotes
[2:05:24] and now
[2:05:24] i'll wind it up uh i think i want to go
[2:05:27] back to
[2:05:30] that day on calvary
[2:05:34] sorry i'll skip adoption let me go back
[2:05:35] to that day on camera and this
[2:05:37] is a paragraph 127.
[2:05:41] glory to god look at this
[2:05:45] it says uh
[2:05:48] now watch jesus said watch how he stated
[2:05:50] the works that i do
[2:05:52] he's doing them right now the works that
[2:05:54] i'm doing now healing the sick raising
[2:05:56] today open the eyes of the blind these
[2:05:58] works shall
[2:05:59] you do also you'll do these if you
[2:06:01] believe in me
[2:06:02] you you do these works and then a
[2:06:04] greater than this shall you do for i go
[2:06:06] to my father
[2:06:08] a little while in the world won't see me
[2:06:09] no more yet you'll see me i'll be with
[2:06:11] you even in you to the end of the world
[2:06:13] i will not leave you confidence i'll
[2:06:14] pray i'll pray the father he'll send you
[2:06:17] another confidence
[2:06:18] which is the holy ghost whom the world
[2:06:20] cannot receive you cannot
[2:06:22] you but yet you can receive him he says
[2:06:25] now notice
[2:06:27] the greater works was to have
[2:06:30] the power in the church not only
[2:06:33] to heal the sick by prayer cast out
[2:06:36] devils
[2:06:36] by prayer see the greater works was but
[2:06:39] to impart
[2:06:40] eternal life to believers the holy ghost
[2:06:43] was coming and given
[2:06:45] into the hands of the church
[2:06:48] to impart life oh that's what
[2:06:52] calvary meant it took stooped
[2:06:56] degraded men and women and lifted them
[2:07:00] into a place to be sons and daughters of
[2:07:02] god
[2:07:03] to heal the sick and to impart eternal
[2:07:05] life
[2:07:06] by giving the holy ghost to obedient
[2:07:08] believers
[2:07:10] men who were once unbelievers be made
[2:07:12] believers and
[2:07:13] impart east in part spiritual eternal
[2:07:16] life
[2:07:16] how much greater is it to say to the
[2:07:19] sick woman laying here
[2:07:21] i can pray a prayer faith and she'll be
[2:07:23] healed that's a great thing
[2:07:25] that's what he was doing then but said
[2:07:27] greater than this shall
[2:07:29] you do i'm going to give you power
[2:07:32] not only to raise them up for a while
[2:07:36] because you can get sick again not only
[2:07:38] raise them up for a while
[2:07:39] but to give him eternal life which will
[2:07:42] be eternal forever
[2:07:44] right now y'all know that happened in
[2:07:46] brother branham's ministry
[2:07:48] had it right when she was uh wondering
[2:07:51] what to get he
[2:07:52] she gave a offering a building fund and
[2:07:54] he went there to the house and says uh
[2:07:57] you know i was coming back to get this
[2:07:58] money but the lord told me not to do it
[2:07:59] on the way say howdy uh
[2:08:01] he started talking about them squirrels
[2:08:02] being created and and had it just said
[2:08:04] that's nothing but the truth
[2:08:07] and when she said the right word the
[2:08:08] right time her amen
[2:08:10] please god amen please god
[2:08:14] god say tell her whatever she wants she
[2:08:16] can have right now
[2:08:17] and uh brother graham say had it the
[2:08:19] lord told me he said whatever you ask
[2:08:20] for right now you can have i know you're
[2:08:22] a poor woman i know this you got a
[2:08:23] sister that's been sick your mom and dad
[2:08:25] is sick

[2:08:27] now and say well what do i expect i
[2:08:28] can't tell you what to ask for but you
[2:08:30] asked for it
[2:08:31] and whatever you asked for you can have
[2:08:33] had it looked around the room
[2:08:35] looked at everybody and said and the
[2:08:37] thing that that
[2:08:38] that stirred her heart the most was her
[2:08:40] children
[2:08:42] when she looked at her sons who were not
[2:08:44] interested in the things of god
[2:08:47] he says you know the greatest thing that
[2:08:49] i can ask god for is the salvation of my
[2:08:52] two boys
[2:08:56] brother ram say in the name of the lord
[2:08:58] jesus received the salvation of your two
[2:08:59] boys right now
[2:09:01] spoken word salvation was given to them
[2:09:02] boys right on the spot
[2:09:07] and that wasn't the only time he did it
[2:09:09] brother dalton was in church one night
[2:09:11] with a burden for his kids i think i
[2:09:13] forget how many kids brother dalton had
[2:09:15] brother branham told him say uh brother
[2:09:18] i give you your children in the name of
[2:09:19] the lord jesus christ
[2:09:22] everybody got saved in a matter of days
[2:09:25] all the kids were saved now i'm gonna
[2:09:27] tell you something when i hear
[2:09:28] testimonies like that i just i can't
[2:09:30] help but have faith
[2:09:32] and i'm going to tell you after
[2:09:33] preaching a sermon like this it's not
[2:09:35] just faith for my children
[2:09:36] i got faith for your children amen

[2:09:41] amen hallelujah
[2:09:44] let me go in with this quote uh uh poor

[2:09:52] uh poor blind wretched uh people how do
[2:09:55] you miss that don't you see
[2:09:57] what the greater thing is that's the
[2:09:59] greatest thing that could ever happen
[2:10:00] was to impart
[2:10:01] eternal life to people he says what's
[2:10:04] eternal life
[2:10:05] the life that he lived the life that was
[2:10:08] in him

[2:10:28] sins you remit to them
[2:10:31] they are remitted whosoever says you
[2:10:34] retain
[2:10:36] to them they are retained now here's
[2:10:38] where the catholic church and many of
[2:10:39] the others made their big mistake they

[2:10:53] what can we do to be safe see you got to
[2:10:56] open your mouth and share with somebody

[2:13:51] they just sit there on the outside
[2:13:53] listening to how she was responding
[2:13:56] inside
[2:13:59] when they heard how she was responding
[2:14:01] on the inside them fellas looked that
[2:14:03] they looked at the man
[2:14:05] okay there's at least one real
[2:14:08] christian and he's sitting out there
[2:14:10] saying i told y'all
[2:14:12] my wife is a real christian the whole
[2:14:15] test
[2:14:15] was designed thought of
[2:14:19] calculated in order to prove
[2:14:23] whether she was a real christian or not
[2:14:25] and do you realize because
[2:14:27] she displayed her christian attributes
[2:14:33] god used a human being
[2:14:37] to redeem human beings
[2:14:41] all in a man gave their hearts to the
[2:14:42] lord jesus because of that one lady's
[2:14:45] testimony
[2:14:51] let me finish reading this quote we'll
[2:14:52] see we'll bring this to a close
[2:14:55] oh hallelujah whosoever sends your remit
[2:14:58] to them they're remitted
[2:14:59] whosoever sends you retain to them they
[2:15:01] retain let me go back and read that what
[2:15:03] is eternal life
[2:15:04] the life that he lived the life that was
[2:15:07] in him impart that to others can a man
[2:15:09] do that
[2:15:10] a son of god can jesus said whosoever
[2:15:13] sins you remit to them they are remitted
[2:15:15] whosoever sins you retain to them they
[2:15:16] are retained
[2:15:17] now here's where the catholic church and
[2:15:19] many others made their big mistake they
[2:15:21] go
[2:15:22] out and say i forgive your sins that
[2:15:23] wasn't it how did the si how did they
[2:15:26] get sins forgiven in the big in the
[2:15:28] bible peter answered that question on
[2:15:30] the day of pentecost they said
[2:15:32] um what can we do to be saved how can we
[2:15:34] get this
[2:15:35] that you all got he laid down the
[2:15:37] prescription he told them what to do he
[2:15:39] said repent
[2:15:40] every one of you towards god see let the
[2:15:42] redeemed of the lord say so open up your
[2:15:44] mouth and say something

[2:15:53] there's the greater works he says how
[2:15:56] many of you preaches this morning how
[2:15:57] many of you listening to my word on
[2:15:59] magnetic tape
[2:16:00] are willing to go to calvary this
[2:16:01] morning and look
[2:16:03] and look what god did there for you and
[2:16:05] forsake your denominational creeds
[2:16:07] and preach the gospel hallelujah it's in
[2:16:09] your lap now
[2:16:11] what are you going to do with it why
[2:16:13] repentance and remission of sins must be
[2:16:15] preached in his name
[2:16:17] to all the world beginning at jerusalem
[2:16:18] hallelujah there you are
[2:16:20] what does calvary mean to you what that
[2:16:23] day
[2:16:23] do to you did it stuff you out with some
[2:16:26] theology
[2:16:26] did it make your stuffed shirt or did it
[2:16:28] make you a christian
[2:16:30] sold out hallelujah center minute
[2:16:32] greater works than this shall you do you
[2:16:34] you you see where where uh uh where
[2:16:37] where these are don't you greater works
[2:16:40] than this
[2:16:40] remaining sins in the name of jesus
[2:16:42] christ but through creeds and
[2:16:44] denominations so forth
[2:16:45] it's bound you down to a place you're
[2:16:47] still serving the world
[2:16:50] church we've been free from that calvary
[2:16:52] came to set us free from that
[2:16:54] caliber came to restore us back to
[2:16:56] everything that adam lost
[2:16:57] calvary came to cause us to live like
[2:17:00] christ we're taking the place of christ
[2:17:04] in the south the only hands that god got
[2:17:06] is your hands
[2:17:08] the only feet god has are your feet the
[2:17:11] only mouth god has
[2:17:12] is your mouth i say let the redeemed of
[2:17:15] the lord say so
[2:17:16] and let god use human beings to redeem
[2:17:20] human beings
[2:17:21] you want to see your family delivered
[2:17:24] pay the price
[2:17:26] pay the price you want to see them free
[2:17:29] pay the price
[2:17:31] hallelujah you'll see them go free
[2:17:34] let's pray father in the name of jesus
[2:17:41] lord your prophet has given us something
[2:17:43] to challenge us
[2:17:46] and we as believers lord is very easy
[2:17:49] just to mentally agree
[2:17:51] with the word of god but lord i don't
[2:17:54] want to mentally agree with it i i
[2:17:56] want to pay the price the same way that
[2:17:57] you paid the price
[2:17:59] at calvary's cross i know that we don't
[2:18:01] have to die
[2:18:03] for sins but we certainly have to die to
[2:18:05] ourself
[2:18:07] we have to be willing to take this
[2:18:08] corner wheat
[2:18:10] go in the ground and die the bible says
[2:18:13] if we
[2:18:14] we if we if we don't do it lord we abide
[2:18:17] alone
[2:18:19] and that's that's why many of us are
[2:18:21] lord in the situation that when we're
[2:18:22] abiding alone because
[2:18:24] we're not willing to die to ourselves
[2:18:26] the bible says if we do it
[2:18:29] but willing to take this corn a week go
[2:18:31] on the ground and die the bible says we
[2:18:33] will bring
[2:18:34] forth much fruit
[2:18:37] lord we surrender
[2:18:40] our hearts to you we surrender our lives
[2:18:42] to you
[2:18:43] as your prophet told us lord you use
[2:18:46] human beings to redeem
[2:18:49] other human beings and god he he
[2:18:51] challenged us even when we're going
[2:18:52] through great
[2:18:53] testing trials help us to realize it's a
[2:18:56] reason that we're going through that
[2:18:58] trial you want to use that in order to
[2:18:59] bring redemption
[2:19:01] to somebody else somebody needs to see
[2:19:02] christ reflected in and through us
[2:19:05] the same christ that was spit upon the
[2:19:08] same christ that had to wear
[2:19:10] thorns the same christ
[2:19:13] that was lying on same christ that they
[2:19:16] they had nothing to convict him of but
[2:19:18] yet they accused him anyway
[2:19:20] god we have to go through these similar
[2:19:22] trials
[2:19:23] because we're taking your place help us
[2:19:25] to surrender ourselves to that god
[2:19:29] it's in jesus name that we pray
[2:19:34] amen amen
[2:19:37] amen amen let's give the lord a hand of
[2:19:46] praise
[2:19:48] um this is uh
[2:19:53] something i say just challenges me you
[2:19:55] know as a as i
[2:19:57] as i um was just
[2:20:01] meditating on it and there was a
[2:20:04] a quote that i remember
[2:20:07] [Music]
[2:20:10] um that was ministered here some years
[2:20:12] ago and
[2:20:14] brother branham was was he had a i
[2:20:17] believe it was
[2:20:18] the prophet that had a dream and um
[2:20:22] and in this dream there was a lady
[2:20:24] saying you know what uh
[2:20:25] brother branham uh you've been
[2:20:27] misunderstood and
[2:20:28] and we've been i mean you misunderstood
[2:20:30] us and you know we we're fine people
[2:20:32] with this that the other
[2:20:33] brother ramsey saw the people locked up
[2:20:35] in bars and in a cage
[2:20:38] just uh just in a really really bad
[2:20:39] situation that they
[2:20:41] they couldn't um get free from and he
[2:20:44] saw the spirit of the lord
[2:20:45] actually come to him in this dream and
[2:20:47] say you know i'm expecting
[2:20:49] you to deliver the people he said now
[2:20:51] how can i deliver the people these
[2:20:53] iron bars and this and that and you know
[2:20:55] all of this going on so how can i
[2:20:57] be the one to deliver the people he said
[2:21:00] but he heard christ say i'm expecting
[2:21:02] you
[2:21:02] to deliver the people
[2:21:05] brother branham says he he looked at the
[2:21:08] condition
[2:21:09] and he realized that he didn't have
[2:21:11] strength to break the bars open to get
[2:21:13] the people free so he said so
[2:21:14] i said
[2:21:17] [Music]
[2:21:18] say let the redeemed of the lord say so
[2:21:22] right so i said house of hell give way
[2:21:25] to the name
[2:21:26] of the lord jesus christ and i'm saying
[2:21:28] that right now in the name of jesus
[2:21:29] house of hell
[2:21:30] give way amen to the name of the lord
[2:21:34] jesus christ
[2:21:36] that's the only way we can get the job
[2:21:37] done is by releasing it out of our mouth
[2:21:40] we don't have strength to do anything
[2:21:42] else but there's enough power in the
[2:21:44] spoken word
[2:21:45] to create worlds
[2:21:48] we thank you lord for your power that
[2:21:50] you've given us
[2:21:52] hallelujah shall we stand to our feet
