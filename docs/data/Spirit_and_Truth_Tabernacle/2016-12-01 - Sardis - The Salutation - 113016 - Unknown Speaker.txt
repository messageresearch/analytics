TRANSCRIPT
========================================
will you start tonight and the sardis rd zhizn church age here in Revelation chapter three and it was just pull it from the scripture here revelation 3 verse 1 through 6 and we'll be discussing tonight this topic on the salutation revelation 3 verse 1 says and unto the Angel of the church and Sardis write these things saith he that hath the seven spirits of God and the seven stars I know that works that thou has to name that thou liveth and our dead and just so that you know tonight we're focusing really on this person and a portion of it where we're really going to dig into the seven spirits of God so this is the the citation of the greeting to this church unto the angel the church in Sardis write these things saith he that hath the seven spirits of God and the seven stars I know that works that thou has to name that thou livers and art dent be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for I have not found that works perfect before God remember therefore how thou has received and heard and hold fast and repent if therefore thou shalt not watch I will come on thee as a thief and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon the verse for that has a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy and he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life but our confess his name before my father and before his angels he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches alright just kind of some review from you know what we did on last week and just kind of going through the seven churches the key thing that we want to bring out here is that these churches did exist and in Asia they did exist but the thing about these churches is that they had characteristics and them that reflect a future H and we're kind of trying to pick up those characteristics in our next slide here but this age here is a number sardis right here this is where this church existed and as you can see the scripture says the mystery the seven stars which that starts in my right hand and the seven golden candlesticks the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the Seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches so we are dealing with Sardis here which is laying here on on the map alright the age here where let me just get something here you the thus artesian age lasted from 1520 to 1750 and it was called the age of reformation which i think is very very critical to where we are even today when we would just kind of get to just kind of thinking about what what really took place like I've mentioned to you all on last week Luther being the messenger to that age and what he did Luther taking the 95 theses an element to the Catholic Church door that actually opened up some opportunity for hate to say it but it opened up the opportunity for like more denominations not that we needed more denominations but what happened before that if you were not capped that you were going to die that's pretty much what was going to happen but when Luther came forth with his teachings and things like that there was a varus just seems to be just like God lifted up the spirit where people weren't killing people for because their faith they were actually a little bit more open to allowing people to express you know just some other views on Scripture and even to this point where we are right now you know for us to express what we're expressing is because of that that door that opened up during the Sardis interchange that's what even allows us to do the gather the way that we gather even right now so we thank god for certain thank God for this age so 15 22 1750 is is when it occurred some of the other things here in that city we brought this out on last week the capital city of Sardis was ancient Lydia the city was at one time very important commercially very important city brother Branham brought that out to us it was said that gold coins were first minted here gold coins were first minted in this place sardis gold coins being first minted there another thing here the city was desolated by our earthquakes and plagues and thus it is uninhabited it's a heap of ruins today all right and finally the thing I wanted to bring out is they had a religion in that city where they worship it was Emperor worship of the goddess ciple and we were bringing out last week how seibel was supposed to be the mother and her son was do eous and what happens that side will begin to get a little bit more worship than her son do eous and this church age so the characteristic that we see there in that church age and how it reflects in the church itself is that Mary began to get a little bit more worship than Jesus right and i think that's still the situation today especially in the catholic church Mary is she gets a little bit more and I think I heard somebody say that on what what son would not honor his mother by doing whatever she asks what what summer not on his mother so they put Mary a little higher than Jesus however according to scripture jesus never actually called Mary Mother you can't find one scripture where he did that and so you know what people are coming up with nowadays and what they've whether distend on for a long time it's been completely wrong but you never see one time where Jesus called Mary his mother brother branham told us that she was the incubator that just brought forth you know the the body of Jesus you know but she was not the mother of Jesus because God Himself cannot have a mother or a father right so all right let's going a little further here we were bringing out some of this I something happened this week I was um I want to bring this back up because i just showed this last week that slide and when i showed it it was a quote where brother branham said let's look at the side by side and so when I saw the quote there in the church age book I said well I want to list it side by side here on the screen for everybody just to kind of get a view of and you know when I did that I had no idea that I was going to get this book delivered to me this week well I bought it the brother George Smith brother branham son-in-law actually put the church age book and a leather-bound almost looked like a look Bible but I but he put in leather bound as a 50 year celebration you know of the church ages and when he put it he turned to the page where this this statement was made he said brother Brandon said let's list it side by side so in this book he actually listed it side by sides and I say well what a confirmation you know I really I really appreciated seeing that but but I what I want to just kind of bring out here is that delius as we look here on this side the earliest he was the Sun God but Cybele she was the moon goddess all right he was the lord of heaven she was the queen of heaven he the revealer of goodness and truth she of gentle and merton mercy the reveal of gentleness and mercy He the mediator she the media tricks he with the key that opens and shuts the gates of the invisible world she with an identical key doing likewise he was the judge of the Dead she standing at his side he being killed raising ascended into heaven she cared their bodily by the Sun and what brother Brandon brings to our attention says now in Rome the stain God has given the title of our Lord he is called the Son of God while she is called the mother of God so you know some of the things that they were bringing forth in this star degen age and some of the characteristics there we're seeing that has has also just been kind of flowing all the way through to even to this age in the Catholic Church that's going a little further here I'm having a little problem with my technology so I'm going to have to just do this this way so the key thing that we want to try to get everybody to see the reason that the characteristics of that we're pointing out here in Sardis the city of Sardis was known for the worship of the female deity dated by the name of sighs oh and that one inside wendys will worship together but by and by in the city of Sardis it came to worship to the worship of cyber alone leaving the worship of Diaz do is out completely and I believe we are really in the same spot again we're seeing that all over again even in this day it's all about Mary and not about Jesus it's not about Jesus if we were to even think about this season that we're in Christmas season Christ has been completely moved out you okay you all see people where they have it used to be Merry Christmas now it's merry xmas right and when you see that X Christ has completely been taken out of the picture now we know by revelation that it was never his birthday in the first place we know that by revelation but for the church world if they those that have no idea are those things if they were just to look at just basic things like that they can see Christ is no longer even in the picture anymore completely removed you know I was I was talking to somebody this week and you know they were since y'all having service on Christmas Day I'm like yeah I mean I didn't even think about canceling church and I'm thinking to say well whose birthday is it anyway I mean you know who would have a este birthday you don't show for the party on a birthday something wrong with that picture right I mean so if it you know it's like he's just no longer in the picture anymore you know it's really a shame of what we see that has happened but these spirits were released way back in this artesian age and we can see full manifestation full-blown manifestation of it here today also why is it important to the sages because as time went on the Catholic Church began to focus on the worship of Mary and getting further from the worship of Jesus these are some of the key statements of scriptures that were made in our reading as were going through the salutation I love some of this brother branham says God's ministries are not in the power of men but of the Holy Ghost God's ministries and not end the power of men but of the Holy Ghost they also said this Paul set the church in order and taught the proper use of the gifts of the Spirit and confirmed that they were to remain in the Turk church till Jesus came now when I saw that I said Lord God everything that you promised in the Bible we want to see that in the church everything you promised the good thing about this statement is that Paul taught how supposed to be done in order and and I think what is happening over the over over time because things got out of order people just got away from the gifts but no the gifts are supposed to be in the church until Jesus come right so we should we should not be looking for anything less if they had it on impending at Pentecost we should be looking for the same thing right here these are the results that that the Spirit of God is supposed to produce the gifts are actually in the church in order to help keep the church in order yeah that's what gifts are for it helps keep the church in order and I tell you what like I remember coming up especially in the Pentecostal church gifts was all over the church when we were coming up Simmons in your life you know who might find that sin you know who could be some mother in the church could be the past it could be you didn't know who was gonna find it right and I but they would deal with it they did what they call pre you through you gonna get rid of that sin or you want to be coming back no more you know because the reason you wouldn't come back is because you wouldn't want to be embarrassed right that desk that's kind of the way it was but those gifts men they kept the church pure and that's what this photo do even right now now it's I don't I you know I think even gifts nowadays you know people want to use the gift to pronounce blessings well that's not you know you're not going to get a blessing all the time especially if citizen all right you can't expect that to get a blessing right but uh but the thing of it is is that people of you misuse the gifts but Paul Paul said to church in order and taught the proper use to the gifts of the Spirit and confirm that they would remain in the church until Jesus comes the church on I'm putting emphasis on it because that's what I that's what I pray for that's one of my expectations that's one of the objectives that's one of the goals that's why I worship in spirit and in truth a man church I mean I'm looking for the whole package not just part of it I welcome it and we know that it's not supposed to be out of order that that's why you're not even say when we have the our prayer time and we've come here at seven o'clock prayer meeting manage them if them gifts get loose turn it in that prayer they are welcome they are welcome at a time like that what Paul taught us that when we come together in a meeting like this that's where you know maybe the gifts don't go for it right in the middle somebody preaching at each and that's not how you do it but we all sitting around praying and you know just just you know calling up on God if you've got to give you out to be in the prayer in the prayer time you brother Branham said come early before everybody got there guess what that's coming too early come in get in prayer let God speak amen and I'm gonna tell you something I believe God gave somebody a gift of speaking in tongues he also get somebody else to gift of interpreter I believe he did that I think sometimes we just get if we get it fear friend and we get afraid to just allow just surrender ourselves to God and just allow God to do what he want to do that's what I think happens right we you know God the God savings were three hundreds of 65 times fear not don't get afraid of God I mean bit let's welcome him less less mindless Jesus you're welcome in this place look he also say this and bring this out seven spirits of God it was spoken up for time in the book of Revelation and that's revelation 14 revelation 31 revelation 45 revelation 56 we'll get into that a little bit late but the seven spirits actually referred to one spirit of god working out the will and word of God and different generations and we look at this in Scripture and talk about the seven spirits of God that said these things saith he that hath the seven spirits of God we're talking about actually one spirit that's actually manifesting itself and different generations it's the same spirit manifests itself in different generations look at this any people that is truly the body of Jesus Christ the true church will manifest the same works as did Jesus I like that any people that is truly the body of Jesus Christ we heard that on sunday if the head make it in right if the head make it in the body has got to be coming you're never seen going across some finish line just ahead of somebody right the body's got to be connected to the head that's got to be coming somewhere so whatever you seen happen with the head the body has to follow right so if we see these things and I mean Jesus himself spoke in tongues don't know that Jesus spoke in tongues even on the cross you see where there was a state of me Eli sabak the knee that was tongs that was tongs right so I mean if Jesus himself did it why can't be praise the lord church already god I'm under expectation Lord you know sometimes God gets so good to you know you're one language ain't good enough to praise a man you know you you need a little bit motor you know the praising man so I tell you what I'm just under expectation church that's that's me and I'm gonna keep talking about and harping on it until I see God manifests himself the way that he promised to manifests himself a man all right let's go on any other church that does not have any other church that does not have the Spirit and the manifestations is going to have to account to God that means if we don't have it here we have the answer to God I don't want to answer to God saying that we couldn't get this done but I also don't want to go to God say we just created something that made it happen what I want to do is teach you and and keep everybody under expectation because this is what the the New Testament church is supposed to have right now now what happens that there's some churches all they did was focus on the tongs that's it we talked about all nine gifts wisdom knowledge tongues interpretation gifts of healing all that supposed to be in the body oh oh lord help me you know I think I told y'all about the sister that was a part of a church down in Miami she just felt led to go into hospital rules and pray for people that had cancer that was that was her minister she would go with a husband they were going just pray for people that had cancer and and sometimes why I believe happens that you'd go through certain things in your life and you begin to develop feelings you know for other people that might be going through the exact same thing right so if she's overcome cancer then she gets the feeling you know she's touched by the feeling of somebody else's infirmity and she wants to go out there and pray for them that you know what i want to encourage if God did it for me God can do it for you right but sometimes we just want to wait for you know pastor goodbye pray for him no you pray you go back you know why because these signs will follow them that believe not just the pastor but everybody in the church supposed to be able to do that glory God gonna hear your prayer trust me I know he will I know he will aid man i don't mind going but i wanna i want to make sure you went to pray to and i want to hit a testimony behind it alright last minute if the world takes over the spirit departs those are some key statements that we read here all right let's time go on here as we get into this the salutation there in Revelation 31 just a portion of that scripture says these things saith he that half the seven spirits of God now if you have your Bible I'm going to read for places right there in the book of revelation revelation 14 let's read that revelation 14 brother Branham said there was a this this this statement about the seven spirits was actually made four times in the book of Revelation so revelation 14 says this John to the seven churches which are an age of grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before is thrown that's the first place we find it revelation 31 is the next place we find it where it says here and unto the Angel of the church in Sardis write these things says he that have the seven spirits of God and the seven stars I know that works that thou art thou has to name that thou Libous and are dead revelation 4 and 5 let's read that it says this and out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of God now on that that that scripture right there that scripture revelation 45 brother Branham was preaching a sermon my I can't think of the name of this but it was it was a sermon I think on the book of Revelation I forget exactly what the title sermon but there was a statement made when he was focusing on that scripture and the statement that may I grew up in the message hearing it all the time but the statements made what jeffersonville needs is thousands of live voices thundering out in sweetness of humility well brother Branham made that statement based on that scripture right there revelation 45 you made that statement based on that scripture what Jeffersonville needs and we said you know not just Jeffersonville but even West Palm Beach you know wherever the product Christ we need thousands of live voice Thunder live voices Thunder now and sweetness and humility a man also here revelation five and six revelation five and six this is the last place where it talks about these seven spirits here and it says this and I beheld a low and the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth just so that you just just to give you a quick summary 27 eyes represent the seven messengers alright so the seven messengers would also represent the seven spirits of God when you looked at that scripture to seven horns actually represent the seven Church ages and the seven church ages would represent those people that are protecting the word of the Lord they're protecting the word of the Lord our lives are protecting the word of the Lord to aid man all right so i want to i think i want to let me see something here i'd like to read a quote here this is going to be on page 248 starting at paragraph five in your church age book let's see here it says this to begin with scroll down just a little bit on that Yeah right there to begin with we know for certainty that these verses are not teaching a new and contrary doctrine so to script the verses that we just went through revelation alone' revelation 3 revelation for revolution 5 it says that it began with we know for certain that these verses are not teaching a new and contrary doctrine to John 424 Part A which says God is a are one spirit God is a spirit but this is like first Corinthians 12 verse 8 through 11 where and we find one spirit manifest himself and nine ways praise god that's the gifts of the Spirit thus we know that the seven spirits of God mean it is the one and the same spirit coming forth in a Sevenfold way now revelation 45 the same seven spirits are called lamps of fire burning before the Lord since John always use nothing but old testament symbols and the revelation we we go to the Old Testament and fine from proverbs 20 and verse 27 that the spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord these seven spirits are found to be associated with man John the Baptist and John 535 was called a burning light which should actually be translated as burning lamp again in Revelation five six to seven spirits are identified at seven eyes and Zechariah 4 10 4 who have despise the day of small things for they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the handles of ruby bell with those 77 they are the eyes of the Lord it is very evident that the word they refers to men thus we see that the eyes of the Lord and this instance are men of course they will be anointed men full of the Holy Ghost for God's ministries are not in the power of men but of the Holy Ghost putting our scriptural discoveries together it is evident that the seven spirits of God refer to the continuous Ministry of the same Holy Spirit and the lives of seven men with whom God identifies himself very closely they are his eyes they are his lamps they who who these seven men are can easily be seen because the next phrase calls them the seven stars which are already known to us as the seven messengers to the seven ages how beautiful that is see the star was meant to reflect light at night for the Sun has gone for the Sun has gone just so the messenger typify daz a star to each age was to reflect the light of the Sun they all did this by the Holy Spirit all right we'll just we'll stop there so what we got here we'll go back to our slide I just I brought out that scripture there on the spot where said the spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord searching all the inner depths of his heart brother branham just made it very clear sit here you're going to have to click Next warm in here what he made it very clear on their step putting it says putting our scriptural discoveries together as evident that the seven spirits of God referred to the continuous minister the same Holy Spirit and the lives of seven men with whom God identifies himself very closely so when we look at the seven spirits there according to Revelation 31 or even the other scriptures that you looked at that we looked at in a book of Revelation when we talk about the seven spirits of God we're talking about one continuous spirit that anointed seven different man for seven different generations or seven different church ages but it was the same spirit annoying each one the same Holy Spirit unknown each one of them to get the job done for that age gave them a ministry that was if I you know I have to use it this way gave them a ministry that far surpassed the other ministries in their day amen you know and brother branham's case he had a ministry that yes there were many other people out front praying for the sick many people doing a lot of things but I tell you what when it when it came to you know he's calling out things in people's lives my never been to the city before don't know anything about it but never even been in this country for speech spot-on with what he was saying only God could do it only God could do that I was listening to a tape today and just listen to him you know just standing there talking to the system say it's a night if I told you something else about yourself with that give you a little bit more confidence than when I'm saying he told her what was wrong with it and then it said would that give you a little bit more confidence then after he told her what was wrong with her it kept talking then he said now what's wrong with you the actor what's wrong with her because of what he was trying to get her to see it's not me telling you it's the holy spirit telling you threw me right I mean but but here he said he said that's right you got you got stomach trouble you got stomach trouble something like that then then he just kept talking to her kept talking to her Demi you know told about I was just praying for love winning odds of things a high note how would he be able to see that and then one person after the next profound the next person coming through the line so that minister was at a different level it was that a totally different level and and if we can't recognize God in that something wrong so I'm wrong we miss it somewhere it just I'm sorry it was it was too many right even if I could one brother even showed me a quote where brother branham got one of them wrong he got one of them wrong and but what would have happened I think he called a person last name they last name was oh my i think the last name was strong but he used a different different name because of what he saw in the vision was a person with a muscle and so he said you know you your last name is this but it was it should have been strong or something along those lines I said brother I'm sorry I i still believe you know I mean cuz ain't nobody else saying no vision with nobody knows no nothing like that then have to turn around interpret what that vision sent in tellapur that's I'm sorry I still believe you know no matter what people try to bring up a produce it's just I see too much God in it to deny that that that this was God I see too much God in it right we had a we had a genuine profit church and like I'm telling you these seven stars b7 ministry seven spirits the same spirit of god and seven different men but God anointed them especially for that age in which they were living especially for that age yeah very specific purpose for doing so all right let's go on to this next so the notice to the seven stars are the seven spirits is in his hand I want to kind of bring that out right here these seven stars are in his hand and the other thing I want you to see this Jesus hand that's holding the sparks it's Jesus Jesus is behind this you can't tell Jesus we can use and who he can't use you can't tell that to Jesus they are in his hand if these these pictures are kind of faded here but actually this is a picture of paul aranea sand and all the different messengers all the way up to you know a brother branham here but these are the seven messengers and you know just just kind of showing depicting what you know what this whole thing was all about the seven stars the seven spirits are in his hand they've noticed the hand means that it signifies the power and authority of God they have the power and authority of God if you all remember Paul when he was talking American divorce Paul made the comment he said this is not this is not the Lord but I there in the book of the Corinthians that this is not the Lord but I now do you realize that God allowed that man to put his but I in the scripture for us to base our faith on when we talk about somebody got the power and authority of God God stands behind that but I and and don't don't let that don't let that throw you off because all the way back in the Old Testament with the prophet Samuel there's a scripture that actually said as a prophet any person that was that was that God called as a prophet God would not let one word from that profits mouth fall to the ground everything that the prophets that got on earn it oh my god honors we gonna have to honor it now if God gave Paul that kind of that kind of authority that he could put it in the scripture I remember when brother branham I'm talking about marriage and divorce and it comes down off the mountains that God gave me a word for the people that's Authority y'all this man had had people that he hadn't even that wasn't even on the earth yet that would be here be responsible for what he said and what they would pick up off that tape church that's pretty that's somewhat that's some Authority right they the hands signify the power and the authority of God you know when brother branham made those comments there and say you know I'm just telling going sin no more then teach your kids they're going to do anything like this they say some of y'all and these conditions because you weren't taught they say but you teach your kids never do nothing like this that was something that was you say God just like God gave Paul the ability to say something his day he gave Moses did Billy say something in this day God has given me the same ability to say something to my people and my damn power and authority of God oh my mm-hmm listen the gospel is preached by the authority of God in the power of the Spirit so these men were all empowered by the Holy Ghost and they all stood up to the world you know you can't help but see that in Luther's ministry man he stood up against the Catholic Church and I believe every one of those uh I mean I Paul standing up against what the the Jews were doing in that day and how they rejected crises stood up against it so you're going to always find that these these these ministers they'll stand up against the world he lodged in his day stood up against jazzy Belle right so the same spirit today that would be a pun brother branham a stand up against denominational Jezebel praise the Lord they were sent or authorized by God not by self or other men they were sent or authorized by God not myself other men if you again you go back and read brother branham's life you know that it was an angel or that called him and I got him to do what what he was doing he would try to run even even when he tried to kill himself God would not allow it God was not allowed multiple times he tried to kill himself but God would not allowed he belong to God his life was in the hand of Jesus and can i tell you something your life is also in the hand of Jesus praise the Lord listen organization is def organization is def if it's any church that's organized i'm gonna i can speak even in the message i have seen people try to organize and i've watched it die I people have tried to build a own little kingdoms they all look you know programs that they had different people following it and I mean arrange certain ministers I watched all that and I've watched it come to a it just dies breaks up falls apart and it just nothing nothing nothing comes out of it organization is death it just can't be any other way if the world takes over the spirit departs if the world takes over the spirit departs now hear of this this quote says the scripture says yet in a little while Jesus says this is john 14 19 yet a little while and the world sees me no more but ye see me because I live ye shall live also because I live ye shall live also now i want to i'm going to bring out a little quote here on this but then i want to go to our church age book and read something else and this this is a quote from the message jehovah jireh it says a little while in the world sees me no more the world there the greek word cosmos which means World Order sees me no more yet ye shall see me for I I being a personal pronoun I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world making Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he remains he raised from the dead the world that unbelievable want see me they won't recognize it but the believer will recognize him because he's the same Jesus that he always was he hasn't changed the same yesterday today and forever now let's stop pick up this quote out of our church age book page 251 in the church age book there's something here that brother Brandon brought to us that we want to we want to get up we want to get this true so page 251 in the church age book it says this says now they had what the world could not have jesus said that when he went away he would send his spirit which the world could not receive that is right the world or world systems could not receive him that is what organization is it is world system showed me a world system church that is full of the Holy Ghost I want to see it if you can show me such a church you have finding a mistake in the word no sir not one of these messengers was organized either either they were put out or got out now what a statement the you know that's made there they were either put out or got out because they were they were convicted of the sin of organization how can the Holy Spirit possibly be in an organization when it is organization that takes the place of the Spirit and denominations take the place of the word remember organization is death it just can't be any other way if the world takes over the spirit departs I know that um that statement that he made their that either people were put out or they got out you remember and the brother branham was coming up and they in the baptist church and they wanted him to I think of ordeno a woman minister he said no I can't do it because I don't see that in the scripture and the pastor to him to either he got to do it or he going to lose his license you say i don't mind giving you my license right now you know because I don't see that in Scripture these you see the same spirit that was in martin luther nailed his 95 theses to the catholic church door he got out he got out right when they when they got convicted by what they saw in the word they left the organization alone and they stayed with the word of God so you're going to get put out or you're going to get out amen amen I am a personal witness either you're gonna get put out or you're gonna get down I'm a personal witness if you're not going along what they doing you're going to get put out or you're going to get out one of the other hey ma'am there are many days I would come home ready to get out many of these but eventually I was just put out amen I'm a personal witness I'm gonna tell you I tell you anybody standing for this to put a true standard for this word you just you watch you're going to come to that same spot where you either get put out are you going to get out on your own you get out because you just can't take no more of it you see all the different things that's going on like this is not of god I cannot take any more of it organization typically breeds that you see what the Spirit of God has has actually been moved out or do you know people just now when I said that it's a good act that people can put on Pharisees actors they can they can act like they love you they can act like you know they can act like Christians to you know my god that it just it's a big act but you stay around long enough you're going to realize that nothing to this ain't nothing to this these people will do you is my god that do you think the world of do you bad sometimes the church can do your worst hey man and we'll never even apologized about it praise the Lord church and ain't number the truth I tell you what you stick around long enough just like these messengers I believe any seed of God we'll see with an organization you're going to get either get put out are you going to get out because of your how different you are a man we're the bride of Jesus Christ we can't help but be different amen all right let's go a little further so this is a statement that the brother brandon made says so we see that the seven spirits actually refer to the one spirit of god working out the wheel and the word of god in different generations we're talking about the seven spirits of God that's the salutation of this our vision church H says these things saith he that hath the seven spirits of God so we're talking about the seven spirits of God it's one spirit working out the will of God and the Word of God in different generations brother branham gives a type of this and our reading and he talked about how we can look at the spirit of Elijah it was the same spirit but manifested five different times in the scripture benefits of five different times in the scripture you know four different generations oh my i was having lunch this week with big brother george smith brother branham son-in-law and as we were sitting there talking it told me when he went to Israel a couple times you know he went over and he got a particular tour guide that would just kind of take them around and this guy he he began to look at the group that was that was with brother George II noticed it the way that they were dressed and just different things about them having conducted and carrot themselves and so he just was just looking at him and he said you know usually I different groups come over they try to baptize me in the Jordan River and they try to you know get me to do this and get me doing it they got all kind of beliefs you know and they try not they're trying to convert me you know he's a he's a Jew living there in Israel but they trying to convert me I'm just here trying to give people tour you know trying to convert me and he said now I look at all these groups he say and he said he said I'm he gave everybody instructions that you know you go do this you go do that you your room is over here your rooms over there you say but you you point it brother George and said you come with me and I said he said I've been watching y'all he said watched all these other groups but I've been watching our cigna tell me what what's different about y'all what's going on about y'all he said I want to know because I know it's something different about you and brother George same how we know I really don't know how to answer said no no no I know it's something different about you tell me what's going on they say he said cap tell you what he said he said brother George said he noticed as he went into some of the Jewish homes they would have dinner or or like a feast or something like that and say in every home they always had one empty chair in that empty chair they would leave there while they had their meal and then at a certain time of the mill the oldest boy would actually get up leave the tape and go open the front door of the home and the reason that that ball would do that because they had a not just a tradition but they had a belief that Elijah was going to come so they had an open chair waiting for you Elijah this is what they were doing so brother brother George took him back to that you know and they say Sigma you know how y'all waiting on the Elijah he said what y'all was promised for Eli mean they larger the spirit of logical to come to y'all four times but it's full to come to us once as Gentiles and they saying it's already coming going hey saying happen to be my father in lofts so that's what make us different we would both waiting on the Elijah they say but Elijah has already come to us and already coming and going and say he'd happen to be on my father-in-law's okay I need some more information about this he said i neva know nothing about for cummins of elijah so that jewish man began to look at that and look at that and history and as brother George was leaving and say you got any more information I can have you say yeah at an mp3 player gave it to him brother branham's message on it and that jewish man is sitting over in Israel listening to the prophets message and he heard it brother George said the tape up at a certain spot where brother branham was it was actually given a description of what what certain places in Israel look like and as he was given the description on the tape this man will heard it and he acts for the trophy say has this man never been here to Israel before he said because he's describing exactly the way it's supposed to be he said he'd never been here he said he's telling exactly what this place looks like he never went one time one day that's like the vision preaching by vision brother brother brother George was just you know blown away and this man is like 80 years old now and it's still doing tours i pray that i get a chance to to go on a tour with him you know but he's just been absolutely moved you know by this by this message so what we see here when we talk about the seven spirits of God according to Revelation 31 we can see the same thing happen with the spirit of Elijah if you notice there that's a picture of Elijah being caught up by the chariots you know the horse chariot of fire and and there is throwing this mantle back down to your life shop because in the remember Elijah asked to say look they say what do you all say you're like a large axe whatever you wanna say I want to double portion of your spirit that's what he asks for a double portion of the earth sweet said that's a hard thing you say but nevertheless if you see me when I go you'll get a double portion of my spirit if you go back in Scripture you see Elijah did eight miracles Elijah did 16 miracles he had a double portion of the spirit of Elijah amen well that same spirit was promised a John the Baptist was also stabbed that same spirit and we'll pick this up in Scripture are giving the scriptures but John the Baptist was supposed to have that same spirit and actually you all turn in your Bible to Luke 117 Luke 117 says this actually since we got our Bibles up let's just start at verse 13 but the angel said unto him fear not Zechariah for that prayer is heard and my wife Elizabeth should bear thee a son thou shalt call his name John and thou shalt have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink now you know when I read that for myself remember the Brandon drink wine strong drink the the angel told him don't don't defile himself in any way don't do that well that one no odd voice that was a scripture voice John was to the exact same thing right he couldn't drink wine nor strong drink and he shall be filled the Holy Ghost even from his mother's womb and many of the children of Israel shall he turned to the Lord their God listen here verse 17 Asia go before him and the spirit and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of the father's to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the Lord so John the Baptist was supposed to have that spirit on him the spirit of Elijah so we talked about the seven spirits of God it's the same spirit working out God's will and actually fulfilling God's work for that generation it's the same thing that happened with the spirit of Elijah that came at different times here according to Scripture it came upon Elijah pic in plenty Lijah not a third time we find it on John the Baptist well there's a promise here one day that same spirit identify by the same manner of ministry would come upon a man for the end of the Gentile Church age well we found that to be William Branham and that's Malik I four five and six and i just gave you Luke 117 let's go to Malik aathma very familiar scriptures that we are very familiar like I could tell you when I was in I was raised Baptist I cannot remember one we went to church all the time but I cannot remember one service where the pastor ever read from the book of Malachi maybe to talk about ty maybe everybody go to Malachi 3 but a day does go over one more chapter there's a promise there that got put in Scripture that would be very helpful for us to recognize where we are today here in verse 5 but I will send you Elijah the Prophet this is a promise from god I'm going to send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the Great and dreadful day of the Lord now we know that this is specifically talking about end time in time scripture because John the Baptist ministry did not come before the dreadful date of the Lord all right but this would be for the second coming of the Lord and notice also in verse 6 says that he should turn the heart of the father's to the children that's exactly what John did and that's what revelry I mean Luke 117 said he did however it goes on to say this and the heart of the children to their fathers it didn't say John did it didn't say that according to Luke 117 so that was left for this in time that portion of scripture had to be fulfilled in the end time before the second coming of Christ and we have identified william branham as a person that fulfilled that if the scripture identified John the Baptist and we can call this name and show that John the Baptist did that all we don't have to be afraid to call brother branham's name because it's ministry also fulfill these things in my list it says this the heart of the Lord the heart of children to the to their fathers lest I come and smite the earth with a curse that is another coming of the spirit of Elijah and the fifth coming is right here and this and the two witnesses and it's actually a larger coming back himself it's not just the spirit of Elijah but its logic comes up that's why you see in the picture Elijah was caught up like a rapture took place for Elijah but God preserved him for he's coming back for a greater I mean a greater work and a greater time and that's after the rapture of the Gentile bride then God against the deal with the juice you find that in the book of Revelation chapter 11 verse 3 through 6 now when you're going to look at revelation 11 verse 3 through 6 you will not see the name the Elijah you won't see that it's not there and there's many people still debating as to who are the two witnesses some say Enoch and Elijah some say Moses is Enoch they got all kind of things but the way that you're able to tell who the two witnesses are you can look at their ministries and their ministries tell you what their names are glory to God a man and all you got to do is trace it back in Scripture you see what Elijah did you see what Moses did now you got a clear picture as to who the two witnesses are so when we talk about the seven spirits of God if you want clarity on that you know think about this five cummings of the spirit of Elijah it was the same spirit anointing men at different times for a very specific work guess what the same thing the seven spirits of God it was the same spirit of god Norton seven different men at seven different times for a very specific work that the Lord needed time praise the Lord hallelujah alright this quote says yes the spirit is not seven spirits but one he will always be the same and act the same and the seven messengers will have the same spirit and teach the same word and have the same power and if the church is the true church it will have the very same spirit and word and acts of power that they had at Pentecost by experience it will be a Pentecostal church and there will be tongues I'm saying a man today there will be tongues and interpretation and prophecy and healings and we've already seen the healing part we've seen that and we've seen you know different ones that were speaking tongues we've seen interpretation we've had that happen here the one thing that I would say is that uh you know I just I feel like if we would just allow the Lord to to use this it might happen a little bit more a man but it has happened you just want to see it you know God you welcome to come here anytime every time we get together you're welcome to come in here right we just want to see that we just want God to have his way in this place that's that's that's all I want a man a man by experience it will be a Pentecostal church and there will be tongues and interpretation and prophecy and healings God will be in the midst of her and God would declare himself in the midst of her as he always has hallelujah and she will be unorganized don't forget that praise the Lord praise the Lord all right let's go on a couple more slides here and we'll be bringing this to a close so in this let's see here yeah I do have a quote that I want to read on this particular slide this is our page 251 paragraph 3 in your church age book page 251 paragraph 3 on this slide the Prophet says this is as now we can we can see that Jesus Christ is revealing himself through the ages by his Spirit in the messengers they are as Moses was to children Israel as he had the revelation for his day so each messenger had God's revelation and ministry for that day thus when we see that the messengers are in his hand we see the Lord identified himself with these men and granting them its power it is not enough that he has associated himself with the whole church which we saw when he was seen standing amongst the seven golden lampstands nor is it enough that we see the fivefold ministry of Ephesians four apostles prophets teachers evangelists pastors four in each age the church goes astray and it is not just the lady but the clergy group Shepherd's are wrong as well as sheep that's a powerful statement Shepherd's are wrong as well as she then God brings himself on the scene as the chief Shepherd in the ministries of these seven men to lead his people back to the truth and the abundant power of that truth that was thus that was really the sole purpose of having these seven spirits released at different times it was God anointing that man with the ministry to bring the people back to the truth of the word of God that was a whole purpose it was not for people to exalt the man it was God using the man to bring the people back to the truth see that's what that's what the Malachi 4 said it would turn their hearts of the children back to the fathers was that mean our hearts back to the word of the Lord a man hallelujah listen God is at his people all of his people but if any man has not the Spirit of Christ he is none of his can I just interject something I'm a move on here in a second even when in a church when we try to bring correction a lot of times people don't want to hear what the prophets in there they'll say don't shove me with the property at this should look at the Bible say well I don't show you what both of them saying right because the Prophet actually gave you the interpretation of what the Bible said so you have there you'll be very clear as to what God expects and again that wasn't to try to you know to the ministry don't use that in order to try to force people into a certain another yeah that's not what it's all about but the Prophet bro brought clarity so that we wouldn't know what God was thinking about these things a lot of things that we just didn't know what God was thinking we know you that's why we got so there's so many different denominations everybody had a different thought on that Scripture but when a private gives you know this is what God was really saying that's why we say let's quote what the prophecy stable with the prophecy a man listen when Moses left the scene jascha was quoted what Moses said but Joshua was saying exactly what Moses saying he wasn't changing it because God had vindicated Moses and the same God that vindicated Moses vindicated william branham today and you know Joshua went exalted Moses that one that wasn't it just like we're not exhausting brother branham but when you got clarity as to what God has done in this hour then your heart is open to just receive the word a man listen all of his people for freedom has not the Spirit of Christ he is none of his and he is the word that would be the word recognizing the people but he has a he has placed a special leadership in these men of his own choosing and through the determining counsel of his own will they appear once in each age it is the same spirit in them what a far cry is this from the here see of Rome they have a man of their own choosing one after the other non-producing the power of God none of Baden in the Word of God each one different from the one before him and adding what He desires as though he were God God is not in it but he is in his messengers and he who would have the fullness of God would follow the messengers as the messenger is a follower of the Lord by his word let me say that again but he is in his messenger and he who would have the fullness of god that means if you want the fullness of God you will follow the messenger as a messenger is a follower of the Lord by his burg as many people trying to get the fullest of God but trying to exclude the Prophet not gonna happen no matter how much fast and they do how much praying they do if they got exclude the prophets message they'll never get to the depths of God man let's go back to that slide remember he placed a special leadership and these men of his own choosing and and and through the determinate counsel of his own will they appear once in each age it is the same spirit of them and I want to just make sure it appears once anybody trying to get you to believe in the eighth messenger somebody after brother branham as a messenger that's unscriptural unscriptural alright so I said this is a far cry from the Roman hereish see and if you just look at that that's Pope Francis on the left and the retired Pope Benedict Benedict I believe this the sixteenth they were embracing during the ceremony and and what brother branham just told us in that quote is that you know they they don't even agree with each other they change things that the next pope come in he changed something that he don't agree with you at the Pope before him they just stayed they treated as if they were God himself and some of the things that they've come up with have actually been against the Bible some things they tell you to accept we ought to we ought to be open and accept this no the Bible don't serious will be open and accept that now the Pope might say it but God didn't see it we're going to stay what God's saying listen they have a man in their own shoes than one after the other non producing the power of God not abided in the Word of God each one different from 11 before him and Adam what he desires as though he were God God is not in it alright so I last one for tonight I just wanted to bring this out the repudiate it and I put messenger versus as well as messengers they've always been repudiated the Bible said in Revelation 31 these things saith he that hath the seven spirits of God and the seven stars we are certainly living in a day a time where the you here mr. minister after minister you know we just had a preacher right here sunday from Jamaica small island like Jamaica and people still trying to find a way to repudiate the message right there's a spirit that has been released in the land today where people trying to repudiate the message waiting a reputed is they try to try to point out flaws in the messenger and if I can point out flaws and the messenger then I don't have to receive the message right that's coming from the messenger so they constantly looking for flaws look ok this was wrong that one brother said that he he couldn't find 16 men that that bet that kept fell off the bridge so he thought the whole story was a lie well he started to some research research I think he's found two or three people that were you know that died on that bridge he just hadn't found 16 but he found two or three like okay I guess if you keep doing your research you probably my final 16 but I don't need to find the 16 people when all the other visions have come to pass right and and not only that that happened nineteen thirty something they did not have the ability to hold information the way we hold information today they just didn't have it right and I one brother told me to say it take faith for you to believe that Moses went up into the mountain there's a burning bush and and he heard from God and you know and and and went back to you know to deliver two children Israel how do you know that Bush was on fire how you know was there anybody else there with Moses right was there an twas was was Google their Google was not there how do we know that that halfway look you know what you got to take what Moses said by faith if you got to take what Moses set by faith and he was a prophet why can't you take her brother branham set by fan amen but it's it's it's repudiated in so many ways people trying to repudiate it and I'll trying to find all kana for anything they can't find I think they wasted a lot of time remember this God uses Abraham and he liked Abraham was a liar y'all remember when he went down and throw that man that that was a system that the Bible tell us that then he went down and talk that's my sister and the man took a BIM electic her for a wife and God had to come down and since they don't you touch that man's wife he said well he told me is it that's his sister I know what he told you I want you to still go to him and have them pray for you Lord you want me to have a lion pray for me yes but God didn't call Abraham a liar God said I want you to go having pray for you because he's my profit so it's not what we think it's what God thinks God said Abraham was his profit even after hit bold-faced lie he was a prophet look at this Moses rebell but God still used him and I want something else I got here by Moses Moses kill yet he gave us a commandment thou shalt not kill and we follow it but Moses did kill so you can't this Bible blow your mind right God still expect you to follow that word look at Jonah there's sobayed but he was still God's prophet in the belly of the whale he was still God's prophet Samson sin inside a harlots house shouldn't have been there Phyllis time surrounding become at the harlots house picked up their gates and took him up to heal he was still anointed by God even to the point where he lost his eyesight and everything else dealing with Delilah he lost his eyesight he had to suffer from some of the stuff that he did but uh but when he prayed Lord once more he killed more Phyllis times in his death than he did in this life David still God's king but he murdered and I mean had that man took that man's wife got a pregnant and then had them delivered his own death sentence to Joab what a man but he was still God's King and not only that God sent man after my own heart lord have mercy look at this God used joslyn got used Joseph but the key thing I want you to break that I want you to remember those with severe blemishes far outnumber those whose history seem to be perfect all were and are his it's not what we think is what God thinks man I thank God you look at some of the histories of some of these people that we have here and God used them my you ought to be encouraged we all want to be encouraged doc can use us to man the noted that we and that he loves us just that much study later song said he could have let me drown but instead he took me man I'm grateful I'm just absolutely grateful thank god for his love is kindness and I tell you what I'm not gonna frustrate that grace but I'm everything and every day living I just want to show him how much I appreciate how much is done for me next week we encourage you to read pages 252 through 257 in your church age book page 252 through 257 will start going over the denunciation part of the sardine church H and I believe will get even some more than ugh 'it's out of that let's pray amen tonight father we thank you for your word we thank you for truth that has been given to us thank you God for sending a prophet to help us understand these things here in the book of Revelation as we go through them as we can just follow the pattern we can see clearly exactly what it is that she wants to see and like you said the world the world won't see me they won't know they won't understand they're too organized they're just never understand but say you we will see you will know you because the same thing that you did while you were here on the earth God and the same way to manifest yourself through the seven spirits of God the same way you manifest yourself through the church today so God we thank you that we have eyes to see and ears to hear what the Spirit is speaking us our blessed us God in our understanding of your word help us to walk in this and Jesus name we pray amen amen praise the Lord let's prepare for tonight's tyson offering and we'll get the we'll be back here on a friday night
