[53:21] amen you know we never want to get
[53:25] lifted up in ourselves I was just
[53:27] talking to brother Troy just a few
[53:28] moments ago and you know many of us were
[53:31] raised in this message many of us don't
[53:35] have the scars and the things of the
[53:37] world but you know friends even though
[53:40] you live in a good life now if you don't
[53:41] have the Holy Ghost you've got to get it
[53:44] because like I said there's no respecter
[53:46] of persons in God you have to receive it
[53:49] for yourself sin is sin hell is hell
[53:52] amen heaven is heaven god it's still God
[53:55] amen
[53:57] so don't just think just living a good
[54:00] life and doing pretty good is good
[54:02] enough without him without him I was
[54:07] here just a couple of years ago and
[54:09] brother Jack sing a song and he sing it
[54:12] for me and it's a song that take us back
[54:14] to our heritage brother Troy he says I'm
[54:16] going all the way I'm going all the way
[54:19] I'm not going halfway with Jesus I'm not
[54:22] just gonna take maybe a half a step for
[54:24] him because I don't want to end up in
[54:27] hell I don't want just fire insurance
[54:29] I want the baptism
[54:32] I wanted to comment and thirdly change
[54:35] me from head to toe away then I won't
[54:41] know that Jesus Christ has for me he saw
[54:45] me in my sin he saw me where I was just
[54:48] a backslidden message boy and at 20
[54:51] years old he said I'll take that one
[54:53] he set the hook and friends I never look
[54:56] back I don't want
[54:58] as for me anymore Jesus said I offer you
[55:01] mine and I know
[55:03] delay oh it's gonna be wonderful when we
[55:06] get there it's going to be good when you
[55:09] get there but friends why because you're
[55:12] going to have more of the word than you
[55:14] have ever had before
[55:16] oh my don't ever underestimate that we
[55:21] certainly love each and every one of you
[55:22] with the love of the Lord and we're just
[55:24] thankful that brother jacket given me
[55:27] the opportunity to be here with you and
[55:29] we're just a counter to privileged to be
[55:33] here and we pray for you pray for us you

[55:40] visit us anytime we certainly appreciate
[55:42] that amen

[55:46] heads this morning for a word of Prayer
[55:47] Heavenly Father Lord we love you so much
[55:51] Lord we're thankful that you truly are
[55:55] the same yesterday and today and forever
[55:58] you said I am God and I change not Lord
[56:02] and it's in this hour that you have
[56:05] chosen out a little bride Lord and we
[56:08] know that it's a revelation to us all
[56:10] the rest of the world just like the
[56:12] little girl out west who had a
[56:14] revelation that who her husband was
[56:17] gonna be and I believe I spoke on it
[56:18] last time I was here but Lord it means
[56:20] so much to us because Oh God
[56:23] we are that little lady the rest of the
[56:25] world can look at us and laugh at us and
[56:27] say all we dress a certain way we do sit
[56:30] we go to church on Sunday we go to
[56:32] church on Friday we go to church on
[56:34] Saturday a prophet taught us Oh God
[56:36] whenever the doors are open if we've got
[56:39] the Holy Ghost in our heart will
[56:41] in there Oh God and that's truly the
[56:44] case this morning Lord we want to come
[56:47] to church why because that life is you
[56:50] offered us that more abundant life dear
[56:51] God is here in a puppet on us when we
[56:54] come to you under expectation that our
[56:57] God meets that expectation Oh God Lord
[57:01] and we just are under expectation I am
[57:03] myself although I'm standing up here
[57:05] Lourdes I'm no different than anybody
[57:07] else but Lord I'm under expectation to
[57:10] see what Jesus Christ it's gonna do
[57:12] today dear God Lord there's certain
[57:14] things I have in my heart that I have
[57:16] need of and I just pray to your God Lord
[57:19] that is your Holy Spirit's here while
[57:20] you're brooding over your people dear
[57:22] God just go to each and every one dear
[57:25] God and mean each and every single need
[57:28] and desire that your children would have
[57:31] on their hearts this morning dear God
[57:32] Lord we love you we just commit the
[57:35] service to you now and Jess Heavenly
[57:37] Father that you would just be in our
[57:39] midst Heavenly Father Lord we just give
[57:41] you the preeminence we worship and serve
[57:44] you now in Jesus name we pray amen
[57:47] whoo I gotta tell you I was blessed by
[57:50] your song service this morning I'm not
[57:51] gonna sing anymore you a man I just kind
[57:54] of back to thinking you know do you guys
[57:57] have like that a CD or a tape or
[57:59] something like that at my if it did that
[58:02] for me
[58:03] what did it do to the one that you were
[58:05] singing to Amen if it did that for me
[58:08] just a mortal man the very one that
[58:10] spread forth his hands and took this
[58:12] took the nails took your set of mine but
[58:15] now he's you're worshiping him and
[58:17] serving him and giving him glory and
[58:20] praise like he did this morning I kind
[58:22] of thought to myself Prince let's just
[58:24] take a rapture let's just go let's get
[58:27] out of here
[58:29] I'm ready oh I am ready certainly
[58:36] appreciate brother Troy who hosting us
[58:40] this morning and brother Solomon the
[58:42] song service and the musicians I've been
[58:43] in churches they don't have the
[58:46] blessings that you have they don't have
[58:47] the the talent and the gifts that you
[58:50] know sometimes we just take things like
[58:52] that for granted but
[58:53] we just thank God for the the talent and
[58:56] the Worshipful spirit that they bring to
[58:58] you many times the psalmist David you
[59:01] know he wouldn't need he would need
[59:03] encouragement from God or even Saul and
[59:05] any other prophets when they need
[59:06] encouragement from God there's healing
[59:09] and music is that right so they would
[59:11] just bring in some Holy Ghost filled
[59:13] godly music like we have this morning
[59:15] and the Spirit of God would begin to
[59:18] brood amongst them so we're certainly
[59:21] thankful for that amen let's just turn
[59:25] in our Bibles this morning to Luke
[59:27] chapter 1 Luke chapter 1 verse 26
[59:32] through 38 and then you can have your
[59:34] seats this morning Luke chapter 1 our
[59:40] subject matter this morning by the grace
[59:42] of God will be be it unto me according
[59:46] to thy word be it unto me according to
[59:55] thy word Jesus was praying in the Garden
[59:58] of Gethsemane and he you know is a man
[1:00:03] it was a tough thing that he had to do
[1:00:05] and he asked the Father there praying as
[1:00:08] his sweat became blood he said father
[1:00:12] let this cup be pass from me because he
[1:00:15] knew what manner of death he knew what
[1:00:16] manner of suffering he knew what he had
[1:00:18] to do he says father let this cup pass
[1:00:22] from me but you'll notice the very next
[1:00:26] statement he says nevertheless not my
[1:00:28] will but thy will be done chapter 126
[1:00:39] and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel
[1:00:43] was sent from God unto a city of Galilee
[1:00:46] named Nazareth to a virgin espoused to a
[1:00:48] man whose name was Joseph of the house
[1:00:51] of David and the Virgin's name was Mary
[1:00:52] and the angel came unto her and said
[1:00:55] hail thou art highly favoured
[1:00:58] the Lord is with thee blessed art thou
[1:01:00] among women and when she saw him she was
[1:01:04] troubled at his saying
[1:01:05] and cast in her mind what manner of
[1:01:07] salutation this should be and they angel
[1:01:10] said unto her fear not Mary for thou
[1:01:13] hast found favor with God
[1:01:15] friends you have found favor with God in
[1:01:19] this hour and behold thou shalt conceive
[1:01:22] in thy womb and bring forth his son and
[1:01:25] shall call his name Jesus and he shall
[1:01:28] be great and shall be called the son of
[1:01:30] the highest and the Lord God shall give
[1:01:33] unto him the throne of his father David
[1:01:35] and he shall reign over the house of
[1:01:38] Jacob forever and of his kingdom there
[1:01:41] shall be no and that best stretches all
[1:01:44] the way up to 2018 then said Mary unto
[1:01:47] the angel how shall this be seeing I
[1:01:50] know not a man and the angel said unto
[1:01:53] her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee
[1:01:56] and the power of the highest shall
[1:01:59] overshadow thee therefore also that holy
[1:02:02] thing which shall be born of thee shall
[1:02:06] be called the Son of God and behold that
[1:02:10] cousin Elizabeth she has also conceived
[1:02:13] a son in her old age and this is the
[1:02:16] six-month of this is the sixth month
[1:02:18] with her who was called barren she was
[1:02:21] called barren she wasn't barren she
[1:02:22] would just call barren for with God
[1:02:25] nothing shall be impossible glory to God
[1:02:28] and Mary said Behold the handmaid of the
[1:02:31] Lord be it unto me according to thy word
[1:02:35] and the angel departed from her may our
[1:02:39] Lord at his blessing you can have your
[1:02:40] seats this morning
[1:02:49] amen and I love her attitude there she
[1:02:53] said be it unto me according to thy word
[1:02:57] let's just turn for another passage of
[1:03:00] Scripture to 2nd Peter chapter 1
[1:03:03] everybody loved the Word of God this
[1:03:05] morning 2nd Peter chapter 1 we're gonna
[1:03:13] read 3 through 12
[1:03:23] according in as according as his divine
[1:03:25] power has given unto us things that
[1:03:29] pertain unto life and godliness through
[1:03:31] the knowledge of him but he have called
[1:03:33] us to glory and virtue whereby are given
[1:03:40] unto us exceeding great and precious
[1:03:42] promises but by these you might be
[1:03:45] partakers of the divine nature having
[1:03:48] escaped the corruption that are in the
[1:03:51] world through lust and beside these
[1:03:53] things giving all diligence add to your
[1:03:55] faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and
[1:03:58] to knowledge temperance and to patience
[1:04:01] and to patience godliness and to
[1:04:04] godliness brotherly kindness and to
[1:04:05] brotherly kindness charity for if these
[1:04:09] things be in you and abound they make
[1:04:12] you that ye shall neither neither be
[1:04:14] barren nor unfruitful and the knowledge
[1:04:17] of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that
[1:04:20] lacketh these things is blind and cannot
[1:04:23] see afar off and have forgotten that he
[1:04:26] was purged from his soul sense wherefore
[1:04:29] the rather brethren give diligence to
[1:04:31] make your calling and election sure for
[1:04:34] if you do these things you shall never
[1:04:36] fall for so an entrance shall be
[1:04:39] ministered unto you abundantly into the
[1:04:42] everlasting kingdom of our Lord and
[1:04:44] Savior Jesus Christ
[1:04:45] wherefore I will not be negligent to put
[1:04:48] you always in remembrance of these
[1:04:50] things though you know them
[1:04:52] and be established in the present truth
[1:04:55] the present truth you see friends all
[1:04:58] down through the ages God had a truth he
[1:05:01] had something that he wanted to give
[1:05:02] each and every age is that right but
[1:05:05] friends now we have a present truth this
[1:05:08] is the Omega church the Alpha Church had
[1:05:10] it for Christ was right there in that
[1:05:12] church that all through the church ages
[1:05:15] a little bit was lost here the Palmer of
[1:05:17] Decatur were all these things took the
[1:05:19] truth away from the church to the church
[1:05:21] actually became completely apostate not
[1:05:24] even knowing anything about their God
[1:05:26] even denied the very name that's going
[1:05:28] to be baptized in and to take the name
[1:05:31] of the Lord Jesus right and replacing it
[1:05:33] with titles of the name Father Son Holy
[1:05:35] Ghost sisters when you take that y'all
[1:05:38] understand there's gonna be a wedding
[1:05:39] here before long when you take that man
[1:05:41] to be your lawfully wedded husband you
[1:05:44] take his name you take all that he is
[1:05:46] all that he has he freely gives it to
[1:05:48] you he's opening up his bank account to
[1:05:51] you he's opening up his home to you his
[1:05:54] car everything he has he's opening up to
[1:05:57] you or the God of glory is opening up
[1:06:00] everything that he has for you he's
[1:06:02] opening his sickness healing to me from
[1:06:07] from your God he says I will give it to
[1:06:10] you he never denies you anything why
[1:06:13] because you're his little bride oh if
[1:06:17] you've ever been loved in your life it's
[1:06:19] why you're Jesus but this present truth
[1:06:27] it's the restoration of everything that
[1:06:30] was lost all down through the years but
[1:06:32] now in this hour has been restored back
[1:06:35] to produce a bride for the Lord Jesus
[1:06:37] Christ and she will be a word bride not
[1:06:42] the word plus oh there's no additives to
[1:06:44] it there's nothing else to it
[1:06:46] it's Christ the word in the word only in
[1:06:48] her amen I'll read this one to you the
[1:06:53] law and the prophets were until John but
[1:06:55] since that time the kingdom of God is
[1:06:56] preached and every man presses into it
[1:06:59] group be easier for heaven and earth to
[1:07:02] pass
[1:07:03] one tittle of the law to fail heaven and
[1:07:07] earth will pass away but his word can
[1:07:11] not fail did we love the Lord Jesus this
[1:07:14] morning now in our opening Scripture we
[1:07:17] read about a little girl named Mary and
[1:07:21] you know I believe with all in my heart
[1:07:22] that she was just an ordinary woman
[1:07:24] just an ordinary young girl you know
[1:07:26] brother Duane who said she would maybe
[1:07:27] between 16 and 18 years old maybe she
[1:07:31] didn't stand out to the rest of the
[1:07:32] world maybe she just seemed ordinary
[1:07:34] just a good girl for we know that she
[1:07:36] was highly favored of Almighty God so
[1:07:38] she was a good girl we understand that
[1:07:41] but as far as fleshly attributes we
[1:07:44] don't know that there was something
[1:07:45] extraordinary that she did but she was
[1:07:48] highly favored of Almighty God
[1:07:50] a teenager between 16 and 18 years old a
[1:07:54] teenager chosen by God to bear his son
[1:07:57] glory to God you say brother Joel
[1:08:00] contain agers grasp this message I say
[1:08:03] yes to teenagers have the Holy Ghost I
[1:08:06] say yes take teenagers and Laodicea
[1:08:10] live the Word of God I say yes you know
[1:08:13] why because it's not you doing it it's
[1:08:16] you dying that you let go and let me
[1:08:19] talk live his life through you oh so
[1:08:22] many say I try I tried to do it but I
[1:08:26] couldn't well that's exactly right
[1:08:28] that's a good start you try now you die
[1:08:31] you come down to the altar you die you
[1:08:34] give it to the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:08:36] then let him live his life through you
[1:08:41] so many of them try and fail oh then
[1:08:46] they give up and say the message isn't
[1:08:48] true it just couldn't do what it was
[1:08:50] supposed to do the problem that is is
[1:08:54] they tried I tried to give up drugs I
[1:08:58] tried to give up the things of the world
[1:09:00] I just couldn't give it up because the
[1:09:03] lust of the things of the world was too
[1:09:05] great in your life we used to sing as
[1:09:09] long this is all to Jesus I surrender
[1:09:12] all to thee I freely give
[1:09:15] I will ever
[1:09:17] and trust you and your service daily
[1:09:20] live friends it don't say I asked her
[1:09:22] when your most you know why sometimes
[1:09:25] prayers aren't answered the psalmist
[1:09:27] David gives us the answer to that
[1:09:29] because you have iniquity in your heart
[1:09:31] you have an open wide every door of your
[1:09:34] life that Jesus Christ coming to every
[1:09:37] aspect of your life you never let him in
[1:09:40] your computers and your smartphones you
[1:09:42] haven't let him in your thoughts you say
[1:09:44] oh I want the blessings of God but I
[1:09:47] just cannot give up certain things Bible
[1:09:51] says what would a man give in exchange
[1:09:52] for his soul what out there has the
[1:09:56] power to give you true happiness I just
[1:09:59] come back from Louisiana youth can't
[1:10:01] bless Sunday brother Andrew Glover
[1:10:05] powerful man of God really appreciate
[1:10:07] him and his minister in my own pastor
[1:10:09] brother Danny steamed and had the
[1:10:11] services there and you know the climax
[1:10:13] to me was that Saturday night prayer
[1:10:16] line you know why because everybody came
[1:10:19] under expectation and I wondered if they
[1:10:21] we'd even be here this weekend I thought
[1:10:24] maybe the rapture would take place right
[1:10:25] then because the power of God in the
[1:10:27] noisy of God was so strong in that
[1:10:29] building that I just didn't know what
[1:10:32] God was going to do but we do know that
[1:10:34] he has a bride is going to take the
[1:10:36] rapture he said he shall not all sleep
[1:10:38] but she shall be changed in a moment in
[1:10:40] a twinkling of an eye friends I gotta do
[1:10:42] something to hard to know that your God
[1:10:44] creator of heaven and earth would do
[1:10:46] that for you but there stood in the
[1:10:51] bread of life and you know you've seen
[1:10:54] the picture this picture right here of
[1:10:59] the pillar of fire the only supernatural
[1:11:02] picture ever taken and I'm saying
[1:11:04] they're laying hands on God's children
[1:11:06] and asking for his mercy and delivering
[1:11:08] power to come into their life and I
[1:11:11] thought you know Lord Jesus the same
[1:11:13] pillar of fire the same Holy Ghost
[1:11:16] this same Jesus Christ is right here is
[1:11:18] related Hanson for 500 young people's
[1:11:21] they came through that line and you know
[1:11:25] there was a young man sitting there
[1:11:28] it was friends and some other Minister
[1:11:30] brothers have been discouraging him they
[1:11:32] just leave the message it's not true
[1:11:35] just leaving just come and just live a
[1:11:37] good denominational Christian life they
[1:11:41] taught him not to come to this year's
[1:11:42] camp and Dry Creek Louisiana but friends
[1:11:45] under the power of God God began to deal
[1:11:47] with him and he was sitting there to see
[1:11:49] during that panel I don't even know who
[1:11:51] it was I just heard the testimony he
[1:11:53] said that he saw that same pillar of
[1:11:55] fire brooding over that then then that
[1:11:58] pulpit that altar where everybody was
[1:12:00] praying and receiving from Almighty God
[1:12:03] he said that pillar of fire was there
[1:12:06] meeting the people's needs I didn't see
[1:12:09] it but I definitely felt the effect of
[1:12:11] what God was doing for his people that
[1:12:13] day he said that the pillar of fire was
[1:12:16] brooding over the people on that
[1:12:18] platform that day it didn't stop there
[1:12:21] it started to brew down and come down
[1:12:23] amongst the people and meet them
[1:12:25] according to their expectations Jesus
[1:12:29] Christ is the same yesterday and today
[1:12:31] and forever your God has not changed he
[1:12:34] has not lost power the only problem with
[1:12:36] it is it's unbelief the disciples prayed
[1:12:40] and asked for a child brother Branham
[1:12:42] said that it was it was a disease was
[1:12:46] that to throw him in the fire I'm over
[1:12:48] 40 he shook him to cast him into the
[1:12:55] fire anyhow you know which one it was
[1:12:57] you look at your neighbor and say pray
[1:12:59] for brother Joe he lost his mind
[1:13:02] but that's okay we found his this
[1:13:05] morning a man glory to God but the fire
[1:13:09] the devil cast him into epilepsy cast
[1:13:12] him into the fire
[1:13:14] the disciples prayed for him and they
[1:13:17] couldn't cast him out and they Jesus
[1:13:19] came on the scene oh my that devil of
[1:13:23] epilepsy had no power there Jesus cast
[1:13:27] him out the disciples came to see Jesus
[1:13:29] why couldn't we do it he says it's
[1:13:31] because of your unbelief
[1:13:32] oh my no I thought he was posed to be a
[1:13:36] nice Jesus loves everybody Jesus and
[1:13:39] wanna step on toes and things like this
[1:13:42] sometimes the Word of God steps on toes
[1:13:44] but what is it doing its correcting you
[1:13:47] and getting you land line with God's
[1:13:49] birds sometimes he just has to tell you
[1:13:53] that you're wrong but in that correction
[1:13:58] the Bible says he loves who he chastens
[1:14:01] all the chastening I grew up man I know
[1:14:03] what it's like to be chasing I know what
[1:14:04] it's like to take a couple trips around
[1:14:06] the block with a stick behind my back I
[1:14:08] know what that's like but you see
[1:14:11] friends that put some value in you if
[1:14:13] cause you should not want to do what you
[1:14:14] just did again marry a teenager in her
[1:14:23] day a teenager
[1:14:25] oh man teenagers and blue to see you
[1:14:27] just got a bad rap no they don't
[1:14:30] I've had too many people tell me that oh
[1:14:32] they're kids the kids are not even in
[1:14:35] control anymore we just don't know what
[1:14:37] to do
[1:14:37] I do get him - Jesus Christ you get him
[1:14:40] under the anointing you get him in
[1:14:42] church and have a worship service like
[1:14:43] we just had a couple moments ago when
[1:14:45] that fun you want to talk about fun that
[1:14:48] was fun I enjoyed myself hearing you
[1:14:50] sing I'd like I said before I can't sing
[1:14:52] but I enjoy good Holy Ghost music amen
[1:14:55] I was blessed by myself but contain
[1:15:01] Agers be filled with the baptism of the
[1:15:04] Holy Ghost can teenagers take a rapture
[1:15:06] yes they can
[1:15:08] yes they can why because you Mary was
[1:15:14] predestinated before the foundation of
[1:15:17] the world to carry the gospel for her
[1:15:20] day it has listened to a sermon here I
[1:15:24] go again
[1:15:25] invisible Union and our prophet was
[1:15:27] preaching and he said that we have been
[1:15:29] given the merit the wedding band of
[1:15:31] predestinated unmerited grace God gave
[1:15:37] you the wedding band of predestinated
[1:15:41] unmerited grace in other words you
[1:15:43] didn't do anything to get it God just
[1:15:45] says your mind I'll give it to you
[1:15:47] brother Branham said he slipped the
[1:15:49] wedding band on your finger
[1:15:51] glory Holly
[1:15:52] before the foundation of the world you
[1:15:54] may say I come into this world sinful I
[1:15:56] did not raise up in this message I come
[1:15:59] with all kinds of baggage but the
[1:16:01] wedding band are predestinated unmerited
[1:16:04] grace was already on your finger it was
[1:16:08] already there the problem of in us you
[1:16:10] just didn't know it but one day God by
[1:16:13] revelation revealed to you who you
[1:16:16] really are told you might have thought
[1:16:18] you knew who you were you might have
[1:16:20] thought you knew what you're aspiring to
[1:16:22] be what your ambitions were gonna be
[1:16:24] because they don't know you're mine and
[1:16:27] you're having call like Mary was to bear
[1:16:30] the Word of God for your day
[1:16:36] predestinated unmerited grace could Mary
[1:16:41] have doubted what the angel said oh
[1:16:42] absolutely
[1:16:43] she could have doubted it but did she we
[1:16:46] have no weather that says Mary says man
[1:16:48] what will my friends think man I'm not
[1:16:51] even married yet
[1:16:52] now I'm gonna be with child and this is
[1:16:54] a robert joseph thing Oh what am I
[1:16:57] supposed to do now oh let me think about
[1:17:00] this gate room
[1:17:01] maybe I just did hearin ponder for a
[1:17:03] little bit no she sent me in unto me
[1:17:06] according to thy word she just believed
[1:17:13] what he said for her now he says this
[1:17:19] now there is a womb of the physical
[1:17:21] there is a womb of the spirit do you
[1:17:23] believe that thank you brother
[1:17:25] there's a woman the spirit do you
[1:17:27] believe that there is a spiritual womb
[1:17:28] and a physical and the mind is the womb
[1:17:32] of the Spirit spoken word as the
[1:17:34] original see you might say well it was
[1:17:36] easy for Mary to believe and the angel
[1:17:39] came to her home I an angel came to Mary
[1:17:43] an angel Gabriel came for the presence
[1:17:45] of God who wouldn't believe in angel but
[1:17:49] friends listen to me now it took just as
[1:17:52] much faith for her to believe that angel
[1:17:54] is it takes for you to believe the
[1:17:57] message of the hour
[1:17:58] it takes just as much faith for you to
[1:18:01] believe who you are isn't it for her to
[1:18:03] believe the angel you say but all an
[1:18:05] angel didn't speak to me and into
[1:18:07] absolutely this speaks you you have
[1:18:09] 1,100 tape
[1:18:11] the Bible says unto the Angel of the
[1:18:13] Church of Laodicea write these things
[1:18:16] and that he that happened here let him
[1:18:19] hear what the Spirit says unto the
[1:18:22] churches what the Spirit says was it a
[1:18:27] man this is more than a man talking to
[1:18:29] my kids and devotions last night brother
[1:18:32] Perry Greene gave his testimony in our
[1:18:35] church please gone unto glory now but he
[1:18:38] said that he was in when a brother
[1:18:40] branham's meetings this is okay this
[1:18:41] morning he said he was in brother
[1:18:44] Brandon's meetings one time when his
[1:18:45] gives a young boy brother brems said
[1:18:48] y'all just bow your head and be
[1:18:49] referenced this morning praying for a
[1:18:51] little girl that didn't was born without
[1:18:53] eyes in her eye sockets friends that's
[1:18:56] not psychology that's not telepathy
[1:18:58] that's not even a devil the devil can't
[1:19:00] even do that he can pervert it but he
[1:19:02] can't do that so but about the head but
[1:19:05] better Perry just a young boy he's
[1:19:06] always had like that over his face like
[1:19:08] that he said but I still kind of left a
[1:19:10] little hey so I can see what was going
[1:19:12] on brother Brandon began to pray for
[1:19:14] that child and he pronounced her well
[1:19:19] brother Branham still had his hands on
[1:19:21] her head a little head at that point in
[1:19:23] time brother Perry peeking through his
[1:19:25] fingers like this inside of eyelids
[1:19:29] circles begin to circle round and round
[1:19:32] God right before them was creating
[1:19:35] eyeballs in the sockets of a little
[1:19:37] child brother Branham looks down he says
[1:19:40] I'm so sorry little sister I forgot to
[1:19:43] ask you what color you wanted glory to
[1:19:45] God he says I forgot to ask you what
[1:19:47] color oh when she opened up those
[1:19:50] sockets that were less empty she now had
[1:19:52] eyes to see to many people that have
[1:19:59] walked away from this message
[1:20:00] oh they read the things and oh how could
[1:20:04] this be how could that mean but friends
[1:20:05] the people that were there have
[1:20:07] testimonies of what your God did through
[1:20:10] through Scripture
[1:20:12] you say brother Joel was that absolutely
[1:20:14] script it was it was absolutely
[1:20:17] Scripture God said I will send you
[1:20:20] Elijah I will all friends John chapter
[1:20:25] revelations chapter 10 the type of the
[1:20:28] bride is that right he was given a book
[1:20:31] but it was an open book it was not any
[1:20:34] sealed up and sealed up in Revelation
[1:20:35] chapter 5 but it was opened up and when
[1:20:38] it was given to the bride it was an open
[1:20:40] book for friends we are recipient to the
[1:20:43] open book that's why eyes can be created
[1:20:45] in socket that's why lives of sin drugs
[1:20:48] and all these things complete completely
[1:20:50] abolished and take it out of somebody's
[1:20:53] life why because the book is the lie it
[1:20:56] is been given to you for deliverance is
[1:20:58] given to you so you have the power to
[1:21:01] take the rapture I like the testimony
[1:21:06] your brother Bill down close friend of
[1:21:12] our prophet 90 to 93 years old something
[1:21:15] like that he was sitting in the meeting
[1:21:19] power of God come down convicted as hog
[1:21:22] he went to church man he didn't hardly
[1:21:24] ever go to church a very wealthy man as
[1:21:27] his wife died I remember she was early
[1:21:30] 90s the state was worth about thirty six
[1:21:32] million dollars when brother and his
[1:21:34] wife passed away very very wealthy man
[1:21:37] so he didn't have much need for God but
[1:21:41] for the preaching of the word he
[1:21:43] recognized his need for the rate of said
[1:21:46] that light flashed across his life and
[1:21:48] he said I want to go down into the water
[1:21:50] I want to be baptized and take the name
[1:21:53] of the Lord Jesus Christ for my very own
[1:21:56] and you know friends he's the same

[1:22:03] space in our own church how give me a
[1:22:04] little testimony now I told you what he

[1:22:59] promised percent to me and I would
[1:23:01] repent and be baptized in his name that
[1:23:03] I would receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:23:06] Ghost and she said I want that Holy
[1:23:08] Ghost now I don't want to wait til

[1:24:03] that sister in the name of the Lord
[1:24:05] Jesus Christ the saints of God began to
[1:24:08] sing we went down into the water what
[1:24:10] they did is he turned all the cars
[1:24:12] around and shine the lights down in the
[1:24:13] water so we can see what we're doing
[1:24:15] they even told her there might be an
[1:24:17] alligator after we seen him before she
[1:24:19] said I don't care
[1:24:21] if we probably this smart you'll sustain
[1:24:23] me Booya and that's what God did just a
[1:24:33] few months ago and he's the same
[1:24:35] yesterday and today and forever parents
[1:24:39] if you've got children out there that
[1:24:41] haven't received the message they
[1:24:43] haven't received Jesus Christ
[1:24:44] like they should just hold on just keep
[1:24:47] holding on all your profession before
[1:24:50] Almighty God when the children of Israel
[1:24:52] left the land of bondage they didn't
[1:24:55] have to leave us behind when you leave
[1:24:57] and go in your rapture you don't have to
[1:24:59] leave the child behind you don't have to
[1:25:02] leave one loved one behind you claim
[1:25:05] those children in the name of Jesus
[1:25:07] Christ and if they're not applying the
[1:25:09] token do their life you're applying for
[1:25:11] them brother Branham since I have no
[1:25:20] apology for this remark that I'm fixing
[1:25:23] to make I believe that God can prove
[1:25:24] that the right mental attitude toward
[1:25:26] any divine promises of God will bring it
[1:25:29] to pass yes sir the right mental
[1:25:31] attitude but you've got to have the
[1:25:33] right that'll attitude that's what
[1:25:36] brings the results you say yes I believe
[1:25:37] that but I don't know that's not the
[1:25:41] right attitude the right attitude is to
[1:25:43] receive it and stay thus saith the Lord
[1:25:46] that is right thus saith the Lord
[1:25:50] what are you saying here take him at his
[1:25:54] word and don't doubt it
[1:25:55] and this is a quote that just means so
[1:25:58] much to me the mental attitude you take
[1:26:01] toward it will bring now the mind won't
[1:26:04] do it like you just said the right
[1:26:06] mental attitude toward the promise we've
[1:26:07] got to bring them to pass he says but
[1:26:09] now the mind won't do it but if you give
[1:26:12] that attitude attitude rather towards
[1:26:14] something that's got life in it then
[1:26:16] that life comes down and does it you see
[1:26:21] it's not you trying it's not you trying
[1:26:23] and failing and not getting knocked down
[1:26:25] and get back up I can't get my testimony
[1:26:28] here before raising this message spared
[1:26:31] a lot of things but music gripped in my
[1:26:33] life and
[1:26:34] I can't tell you how many times I quit
[1:26:37] listening to rock and roll in country
[1:26:39] music and all these things you start
[1:26:41] with rock and roll you end up and rap
[1:26:43] and then you say well country music's a
[1:26:44] little bit easier to listen to so I'll
[1:26:46] I'll listen to that and then where you
[1:26:48] go well that isn't right so I go to
[1:26:50] Christian country music I go to
[1:26:52] Christian rock friends there ain't no
[1:26:54] such thing because the 90 behind the
[1:26:57] thing is from the pinna now when we
[1:27:01] heard this morning it was good Holy
[1:27:03] Ghost film music and if you don't have
[1:27:05] some Holy Ghost field music like you
[1:27:07] heard this morning you talk to brother
[1:27:08] Solomon or brother Troy or somebody like
[1:27:10] that and they'll get you some good music
[1:27:12] to listen to something that honors and
[1:27:14] glorifies your God but you give that
[1:27:20] attitude towards something that's got
[1:27:22] life in it then the life comes down and
[1:27:24] does it not your mental attitude that
[1:27:28] only brings you in the presence of him
[1:27:30] your attitude only brings you in the
[1:27:33] presence of him that's what you do your
[1:27:37] mind the five senses is all right as
[1:27:39] long as they don't deny God but when
[1:27:41] they go denying God then you leave them
[1:27:44] alone
[1:27:44] the Bible says lay not onto your own
[1:27:47] understanding talking to brother Troy in
[1:27:52] the office this morning
[1:27:53] just one word according to your
[1:27:55] understanding things that the world look
[1:27:57] pretty good but because of one word the
[1:28:00] word not my son and I my traveling buddy
[1:28:03] here come here this morning and I forget
[1:28:06] how many wrecks and things we saw just
[1:28:08] on route 70 early on a Sunday morning
[1:28:10] where you know most people should have
[1:28:12] been just getting ready for church but
[1:28:15] ambulance is coming down the road car
[1:28:17] vets things are happening people in
[1:28:19] turmoil in pain because of one word one
[1:28:24] word but if you take the whole Word of
[1:28:28] God then there's a huge blessing if you
[1:28:30] take the whole Word of God not deluded
[1:28:33] by some man's I think you know one of
[1:28:36] the greatest men ever met I hope this is
[1:28:38] okay this morning well the greatest man
[1:28:39] ever met was my father-in-law brother
[1:28:41] John steam and some of you maybe
[1:28:42] remember him he passed away just a
[1:28:44] couple of years ago but I would go to
[1:28:47] him you know as a young
[1:28:48] and I wasn't ministering yet I was
[1:28:51] running from that but I would go to him
[1:28:52] many times and say well what about this
[1:28:55] what does the Bible say about this or
[1:28:57] what does this mean
[1:28:59] and you know one thing I admired about
[1:29:01] him sometimes he just said I don't know
[1:29:03] I've wondered myself and your prophet
[1:29:05] did that very thing sometimes in
[1:29:06] questions and answers but I never ever
[1:29:09] heard him say I think I think if you
[1:29:13] don't know just say you don't know
[1:29:14] there's no shame in that there's no
[1:29:16] shame in not knowing just place it
[1:29:18] before your God and if you have a
[1:29:20] question just place that there in your
[1:29:22] mind and then one day he will give you
[1:29:26] the revelation of that thing whatever it
[1:29:28] may be you just place it there and say
[1:29:30] God it might be a year you said I can't
[1:29:33] with you Abraham waited 25 for his
[1:29:35] promise and we can't wait a few minutes
[1:29:37] I like one time a minister said this is
[1:29:39] the age of the microwave when I grew up
[1:29:41] yeah they were out there they were real
[1:29:42] expensive yeah I'm dating myself I'm 42
[1:29:44] years old I remember we got one man it
[1:29:46] was about as why does that pulpit had a
[1:29:48] little bitty door in it you put a little
[1:29:49] thing of popcorn in it we got it at a
[1:29:51] garage sale and that's okay
[1:29:55] but today we want everything instant I
[1:29:59] want it now you know they say that
[1:30:01] movies and television and things like
[1:30:03] that they change the picture every three
[1:30:04] seconds so you don't lose interest in it
[1:30:07] every three seconds our mind has to be
[1:30:10] entertained entertained entertained
[1:30:11] entertained
[1:30:14] sometimes I just saw it on brother
[1:30:16] Jack's wall a moment ago says be still
[1:30:18] and know that I am God just meditate on
[1:30:23] him for a little while and let him come
[1:30:25] down let his presence come down you know
[1:30:27] brother Branham said you want victories
[1:30:29] just get into your prayer closet just
[1:30:31] begin to pray and seek Him just wait
[1:30:34] till the house is all clear wherever you
[1:30:37] go to pray some of you may have a a nice
[1:30:39] little place where you can go for a walk
[1:30:40] and just commune with Almighty God tell
[1:30:43] him how much you love him put your
[1:30:45] petitions before him but then just get
[1:30:47] quiet brother Branham said just be quiet
[1:30:49] and let him speak to you but you know
[1:30:52] for instance times it takes a little
[1:30:53] while he may not answer you instantly
[1:30:56] but he said I will answer
[1:30:59] didn't Daniel pray one time it took 21
[1:31:02] days to get his answer because the
[1:31:04] spirit of the Prince of Persia withstood
[1:31:05] the angel they had his answer of course
[1:31:07] Michael the Archangel Christ came down
[1:31:09] and assisted that angel and that answer
[1:31:11] was able to get to so just know your
[1:31:13] answers on the way but it don't always
[1:31:15] happen just the way that you wanted it
[1:31:17] to so many people have just walked away
[1:31:27] from this truth walked away since I
[1:31:30] can't believe it all those preachers
[1:31:31] just don't have a clue about the real
[1:31:33] world I mean he's old listen Matan he
[1:31:36] don't know where I've been and where
[1:31:37] let's go on let me say this we do have a
[1:31:40] clue about the real world many of us
[1:31:42] came from there we've definitely seen it
[1:31:44] but I'm here to tell you this morning
[1:31:46] about the real world and that's the Word
[1:31:48] of God we read it this morning heaven
[1:31:50] and earth are going to pass away but his
[1:31:52] word can not fail you say that that's
[1:31:56] not the real that is the real world
[1:31:58] that's the only thing that is real
[1:32:00] that's the only thing that can get you
[1:32:03] out of this world and into the next you
[1:32:11] see it's not based on your thoughts your
[1:32:14] emotion or even how you feel oh I feel
[1:32:17] so bad but the Word of God is still true
[1:32:19] you see friends often times we feel good
[1:32:23] and I remember in the Penn Harris
[1:32:24] meetings jumping and shouting and having
[1:32:26] a good old time but you know friends
[1:32:28] that did not have the power to keep us
[1:32:31] once we left from that building it's the
[1:32:34] power of God in your life you say
[1:32:36] brother drawer you can see motion
[1:32:37] absolutely not I believe that the power
[1:32:39] of God brings on emotion but it's not
[1:32:42] necessarily the jumping - screaming -
[1:32:44] shouting and the praising and things
[1:32:46] like that that brings down the power of
[1:32:47] God it's the preaching of the word the
[1:32:50] down the power of God just say he just
[1:32:53] prepared your heart you receive what he
[1:32:55] has for you I was in too many meetings
[1:32:59] when they said oh I can't breach now
[1:33:01] I've given so I'll talk then what did we
[1:33:03] come here for any out I could have
[1:33:05] stayed home and watched a video of
[1:33:06] singing I could have stayed home at this
[1:33:08] much I what the word you say well you're
[1:33:12] a preacher I was 12 years old when that
[1:33:14] came to me just a little boy that even
[1:33:18] converted you where the man stayed
[1:33:21] behind the Pope I feel sorry for you if
[1:33:22] you can't dance no well yeah we did but
[1:33:27] the power of God is what should bring
[1:33:30] that on did the preaching of the word
[1:33:32] we've seen so many miracles with so many
[1:33:35] things happen just while the people are
[1:33:37] in their position sitting under the
[1:33:39] sound of the gospel we had a brother in
[1:33:42] our church his ears were healed
[1:33:43] completely healed he was deaf her point
[1:33:45] in those eyes I'm sorry it was his eyes
[1:33:47] he was having a hard time sing a young
[1:33:50] man 56 years old very young I did the
[1:33:56] sound of the gospel God opened his eyes
[1:33:59] we had another man he's exact my age who
[1:34:02] eats younger than I am he's 42 years old
[1:34:03] sit there under the sound of the gospel
[1:34:06] when Jesus Christ his word was being
[1:34:09] preached this man has all kinds of back
[1:34:11] problems he comes in like a little old
[1:34:13] man he had a pretty heavy job he carries
[1:34:16] he sees a Salesman for Benjamin Moore
[1:34:18] paint up in our local church and he
[1:34:20] carries him five gallon buckets all day
[1:34:22] long probably weighs 70 pounds apiece I
[1:34:24] suppose I don't know he carries about
[1:34:26] two peoples trucks and now his 42 year
[1:34:29] old man with ten children he's walking
[1:34:31] around like this and you know he's our
[1:34:33] song leader and he came down off the
[1:34:35] steps like like this walk back to his
[1:34:38] seat and suffered for several months but
[1:34:42] you know one day the power of God came
[1:34:45] down strengthen that back but then
[1:34:48] bounce this backward God created feet no
[1:34:51] he doesn't crawl into church anymore
[1:34:54] he is
[1:34:56] he went to the physical therapist he ran
[1:34:59] three miles than that stayed the day
[1:35:01] before Maddy couldn't walk they said are
[1:35:03] you gonna stop before he could hardly
[1:35:06] move the next day he says Jesus Christ
[1:35:09] heal me want to see me jump up do it
[1:35:11] again I'm here and I'm never ever gone
[1:35:15] back where I was I'm never going back
[1:35:19] who Jesus Christ saved you from sin
[1:35:22] you're never going back to where you
[1:35:24] were Oh
[1:35:25] testimony so many people brother
[1:35:28] Brandon's meetings or healed but they
[1:35:32] didn't hold the testimony they begin to
[1:35:35] doubt well maybe I didn't get healed
[1:35:39] maybe it didn't happen maybe it was just
[1:35:42] a guess
[1:35:43] 100% of the time for 33 years
[1:35:46] oh come on devil I thought you were
[1:35:50] smarter than that and then when they
[1:35:55] began to doubt yeah the devil had an
[1:35:58] open door at that point and he could
[1:36:00] bring the cancer blindness whatever
[1:36:02] would be back on the person don't doubt
[1:36:07] all the time he said just believe don't
[1:36:10] doubt God honors his word and he anoints
[1:36:17] the minister to give you what you need
[1:36:20] you see friends I don't know brother
[1:36:22] Jack just sent me a text says could you
[1:36:24] be here Sunday morning and he said god
[1:36:27] bless you brother
[1:36:28] and their brother Troy you have any
[1:36:30] questions just contact my brother I said
[1:36:32] okay but the Jeff didn't tell me what
[1:36:34] you're dealing with he didn't tell me
[1:36:35] your struggles but Jesus knows Jesus the
[1:36:40] pillar of fire that was not relegated to
[1:36:43] January 1950 that was not relegated to
[1:36:46] try Creek Louisiana when we could go I
[1:36:49] believe with all of my heart that you
[1:36:51] brought him here with you today and he's
[1:36:53] the dissolver announced he's the
[1:36:55] dissolver of fear he's the disarmer of
[1:36:57] sickness he's the disarmer of sin
[1:37:04] so many times have talked with people
[1:37:07] and dealt with them in their problems
[1:37:10] they'll call me on Monday or Tuesday and
[1:37:13] we'll pray and we'll go over some
[1:37:15] scriptures and things like that and
[1:37:17] Wednesday night it might be a visiting
[1:37:20] ministry brother Jul 40 or somebody like
[1:37:22] that just come and really bring down the
[1:37:24] power of God but well something came up
[1:37:28] they needed to get peanut butter they
[1:37:30] just needed to go shopping or whatever

[1:37:41] sick next to me I'll tell you what don't
[1:37:43] don't

[1:37:48] ministering brother that did not know
[1:37:50] what their problem was preaches his and
[1:37:53] tire sermon on the deliverance that they
[1:37:56] needed but for whatever Pedley little
[1:37:59] excuse oh well I thought it I thought I
[1:38:02] was about to come down with something

[1:38:10] faith where is your pain I feel like I'm
[1:38:12] about to get sick I feel like I'm about
[1:38:16] to be healed I feel like somebody's
[1:38:19] about to B's AIDS I feel like somebody
[1:38:21] it's about to be seen the baptism of the
[1:38:24] Holy Ghost let that be your profession
[1:38:29] the Bible says he's the high priest of
[1:38:32] your profession what you confessed he's
[1:38:36] the high priest of amen
[1:38:42] you haven't any business out on the
[1:38:44] field unless you are filled with the
[1:38:46] Holy Ghost and preaching the true gospel
[1:38:47] and demonstration of the power of Holy
[1:38:50] Ghost he says if you're not seeing the
[1:38:53] results that Jesus said you would see
[1:38:55] it's because you're not preaching the
[1:38:57] true gospel
[1:38:58] you see false doctrine pines and we see
[1:39:03] it all around the message
[1:39:04] oh you must belong to this group and we
[1:39:06] just believe so and so and this and that
[1:39:08] and we don't let the fivefold ministry
[1:39:10] into our church all right we're just
[1:39:12] gonna sit home and listen to tapes hello
[1:39:14] hello we're just gonna sit home and
[1:39:16] listen to it
[1:39:17] but if you listen to those tapes What
[1:39:19] did he say What did he say
[1:39:21] it doesn't coincide with anything that
[1:39:23] these people are doing questions and
[1:39:28] answers on the seals they asked him well
[1:39:30] the bride have a ministry before the
[1:39:32] rapture he says that's what's going on
[1:39:35] now that's what's going on now he said
[1:39:39] God choose a man to preach the gospel he
[1:39:43] could have chose the moon he could have
[1:39:44] choose the Stars he could have chose
[1:39:46] anything but he chose a man to bring you
[1:39:50] the good news
[1:39:50] he chose a man to preach Jesus Christ to
[1:39:54] you oh and I like this part he says it
[1:39:57] wasn't a mechanical device or something
[1:39:59] like that God chose a man so young man
[1:40:03] whoever you may be if God is calling you
[1:40:06] if God is dealing with you go go your
[1:40:10] confession should be Here I am send me
[1:40:13] Oh leave us Hudson Taylor one time great
[1:40:16] missionary to China young Chinese boy
[1:40:18] got the baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[1:40:21] power of God and the joy was deep down
[1:40:23] inside him he says mr. Taylor what must
[1:40:26] I do
[1:40:27] should I go get an education so I can
[1:40:30] take this joy to the rest of the world
[1:40:32] that's the Taylor told him he could you
[1:40:34] blow out the candles lid don't go out
[1:40:37] while the candles haplit he said little
[1:40:39] boys I don't know what to tell him what
[1:40:41] do I say
[1:40:41] Hudson Taylor says you just go tell them
[1:40:43] how the candle got Linda that's right
[1:40:46] you go tell them how the candle got
[1:40:48] there you go tell they move out spirit
[1:40:50] and light tabernacle
[1:40:51] either tell them about the power of God
[1:40:54] that comes down in these meetings you go
[1:40:56] tell him about the deliverance that
[1:40:59] Jesus Christ administers to his people
[1:41:01] in this day and that he truly is
[1:41:04] yesterday the same yesterday today and
[1:41:06] forever what time I started brother Troy
[1:41:11] will try to wind this up quickly if you
[1:41:17] would please just turn in your Bibles to
[1:41:18] Galatians chapter 8 Galatians chapter
[1:41:22] I'm sorry Galatians chapter 4 there is
[1:41:24] no Galatians chapter 8 you say God how
[1:41:27] brother Joel to know his Bible everybody
[1:41:31] loved the Lord Jesus this morning a man
[1:41:34] like your best boy says let's have
[1:41:35] church we come to have church amen
[1:41:39] glory to God certainly appreciate
[1:41:42] brother Jack and all that he's doing for
[1:41:44] the bride not just here in West Palm
[1:41:46] Beach but around the world how God is
[1:41:49] just sending him around and maybe you
[1:41:51] say well why would brother Jack have to
[1:41:53] go to Africa why would he have to go to
[1:41:54] Johnson City or Ohio well I would have
[1:41:57] to go there because God ordained him in
[1:42:00] his ministry maybe just to reach one and
[1:42:03] that one soul is worth 10,000 world's to
[1:42:05] your God and God predestinated him to go
[1:42:09] that's why if God's telling you to go go
[1:42:12] it's just that simple
[1:42:14] well I don't know I don't let doubt come
[1:42:16] into your mind go if he calls you to go
[1:42:20] that he'll meet you when you get there
[1:42:24] Galatians chapter 4 verse 8 and you know
[1:42:28] friends that had nothing to do with my
[1:42:30] notes but I believe that God is speaking
[1:42:32] to somebody this morning Galatians
[1:42:36] chapter 4 verse 8 howbeit then when you
[1:42:40] were when you knew not God you did
[1:42:42] service unto them which by nature are no
[1:42:44] gods but now after that you have known
[1:42:47] God or rather known of God how turn ye
[1:42:50] again to the weak and beggarly elements
[1:42:52] where to you desire to be in bondage you
[1:42:58] observe days and months and times and
[1:43:00] years and I am afraid of you lest I have
[1:43:03] bestowed upon you late
[1:43:04] in vain brethren I brethren I beseech
[1:43:07] she be as I am for I am as ye ye have
[1:43:13] not injured me at all
[1:43:15] you know how through infirmity of the
[1:43:17] flesh I preached the gospel unto you at
[1:43:20] first and my temptation which was in my
[1:43:22] flesh she despised not nor rejected me
[1:43:25] nor rejected but received me as an angel
[1:43:28] of God even as Christ Jesus where is
[1:43:32] then the blessedness she spake afore I
[1:43:34] bear you record then if it had been
[1:43:36] possible ye would have plucked out your
[1:43:38] own eyes and have given them to me and I
[1:43:40] am therefore become am I now listen to
[1:43:43] this words 4:16 I love it
[1:43:44] am I therefore become your enemy because
[1:43:46] I tell you the truth mom am I am I
[1:43:51] therefore become your enemy because I
[1:43:52] tell you the truth preach against sin
[1:43:56] they sell ously affect you but now well
[1:44:00] yeh they would exclude you that she may
[1:44:03] not affect me but is good to be
[1:44:06] zealously affected always that a good
[1:44:08] thing and not only when I am present
[1:44:10] with you so you can praise him any time
[1:44:13] and you should praise him everywhere you
[1:44:14] go but I like verse 19 is where I drove
[1:44:17] this thought for this sermon right here
[1:44:19] he says my little children of whom I
[1:44:22] travail in birth again until Christ be
[1:44:26] formed in you my little children to whom
[1:44:30] I travail and birth until Christ the
[1:44:33] word before him then you all could that
[1:44:38] happen in the ephesian church age can it
[1:44:40] happen in Laodicea it did it is it still
[1:44:44] has the power to change lives today amen
[1:44:48] back a chapter in verse 1 Galatians 3 so
[1:44:51] some foolish Galatians who has bewitched
[1:44:53] you that ye should not obey the truth
[1:44:56] before whose eyes Jesus Christ has been
[1:44:59] evidently set forth crucified among you
[1:45:03] they were witnesses have happened in
[1:45:05] their very day but friends our prophet
[1:45:08] said that they're crucifying him again
[1:45:10] don't you love the word in its
[1:45:12] perfectness
[1:45:12] is perfect the sword is there an English
[1:45:14] major here please forgive me but don't
[1:45:16] you love the word in its perfectness I
[1:45:18] think we can say that perfectness Moses
[1:45:22] smote the rock how many times twice he
[1:45:27] was judged for he was supposed to do
[1:45:28] that but the perfectness of God Jesus
[1:45:32] Christ was slain two thousand years ago
[1:45:35] but today our prophet comes around and
[1:45:38] picks up that same verse we understand
[1:45:40] that the rock that followed them in the
[1:45:41] wilderness was Christ and he was spit
[1:45:43] there he was spitting twice he said that
[1:45:45] this day they crucified Jesus Christ
[1:45:48] again a flesh the perfectness of the
[1:45:53] word they crucified him again with their
[1:45:57] denominations they crucified him again
[1:45:59] by denying his word
[1:46:02] they've crucified him again by adding do
[1:46:07] you see friends there's no such thing as
[1:46:10] being baptized in the name of the Father
[1:46:12] Son Holy Ghost he said you must be
[1:46:14] baptized in the name singular the name
[1:46:17] singular of the Father of the Son and
[1:46:21] the Holy Ghost which is the Lord Jesus
[1:46:23] Christ also many people divide their
[1:46:26] Bible and a half and say I'll take the
[1:46:27] red letters over your estimate I'll take
[1:46:30] what Jesus said over Peter but what they
[1:46:32] don't recognize it's Peter had a
[1:46:34] revelation of Matthew 28:19
[1:46:37] lynnie said repent of your sin and be
[1:46:39] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:46:41] Christ for their mission said and ye
[1:46:43] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:46:45] Jesus when he left he said I will be
[1:46:48] with you I will be with you I will be in
[1:46:50] you unto the ends of the world what his
[1:46:53] seal comes upon you according to
[1:46:56] Ephesians 4:30
[1:46:57] you are sail until the day of your
[1:47:01] Redemption there is nothing can take
[1:47:03] that seal off of your life and there's
[1:47:07] no fear in that then Oh
[1:47:09] fear comes and paralyzes believers
[1:47:12] paralyzes people Oh what if I don't get
[1:47:15] it what if I'm not forgiving what if I'm
[1:47:16] not good enough and they walk around
[1:47:19] they down no you're a child of the king
[1:47:23] you remember brother Branham told the
[1:47:25] story of them
[1:47:26] young man on the plantation he walked
[1:47:28] out with his chest out a little bit
[1:47:30] different they said you feed him
[1:47:31] different he says no no he's just one of
[1:47:33] the servants no why does he have
[1:47:35] differences I wonder so myself and I
[1:47:38] found out in his motherland he's the son
[1:47:40] of a game and although an alien in his
[1:47:43] country he's away from his kindred he's
[1:47:45] away from his family he still conducts
[1:47:48] himself as a child of a king well
[1:47:50] friends you are children of a king
[1:47:52] you're pilgrims and strangers in this
[1:47:54] world you look different
[1:47:55] you walk different you talk effort you
[1:47:57] do different things than the rest of the
[1:47:59] world but you walk forward with your
[1:48:02] chest out your head high because you're
[1:48:04] a child I'm not a king put your child of
[1:48:07] a king and his royal blood flows through
[1:48:13] your veins Oh
[1:48:15] friends that's something to rejoice
[1:48:17] about we see the world getting worse and
[1:48:19] worse and worse it works all the time
[1:48:23] I just heard in my home state of Ohio
[1:48:25] and there's been man in the high o
[1:48:27] Supreme Court it's not too pretty bait
[1:48:29] right now whether they can put the
[1:48:31] child's gender on their birth
[1:48:32] certificate when they're born such
[1:48:35] profanity such filth such nonsense
[1:48:39] growing up I never in a million years
[1:48:41] thought something like when I was in
[1:48:42] school we still pray it was against the
[1:48:45] law but we still did it I still had a
[1:48:47] teacher the Hedden of God about her that
[1:48:50] we still pray for our food what's it
[1:48:52] like thirty years later you don't even
[1:48:54] give them just some name tree or apple
[1:48:56] or something like that that's completely
[1:48:58] gender neutral it's for yeah you're
[1:49:02] laughing because it's funny it's
[1:49:03] ridiculous but they think that's real
[1:49:05] and they're paying millions of dollars
[1:49:06] to debate whether it's okay to put em er
[1:49:10] F on a birth certificate as it was in
[1:49:15] the days of Sodom
[1:49:16] so shall it be and the day when the Son
[1:49:20] of Man is revealed if you don't see
[1:49:22] Jesus Christ say open the eyes of my
[1:49:25] heart Lord open the eyes of my heart I
[1:49:27] want to see you I want to see you higher
[1:49:30] lift it up
[1:49:36] Apostle Paul says my little children to
[1:49:39] whom I travail in birth to Christ be
[1:49:41] formed in you you see it's the ministers
[1:49:43] labor of love to preach the word and to
[1:49:46] keep the church in line and so brother
[1:49:49] Branham told the vision that he saw of
[1:49:52] the bride and she was marching to the
[1:49:54] beat of the gospel
[1:49:55] there was one being led by a witch there
[1:49:58] was one listening to rock and roll music
[1:50:00] but it wasn't the one not the sainted
[1:50:02] little lady with her hair flowing down
[1:50:04] her back dressed in godly attire not
[1:50:07] trying to look like the world not being
[1:50:09] influenced by the things of the world
[1:50:11] but she was walking to the beat of
[1:50:13] onward Christian soldiers marching is
[1:50:16] the done to war with the cross of Jesus
[1:50:19] going on before he said that I saw the
[1:50:22] Asian Church no such bill then I saw the
[1:50:25] American Church and he said listening to
[1:50:27] rock and roll music and I thought to
[1:50:30] myself mine maybe it was the influence
[1:50:32] of the rock and roll on the Christian
[1:50:34] music of the day but just recently some
[1:50:39] of the brothers in our church have been
[1:50:40] invited to a prayer meeting at one of
[1:50:43] the mega churches of the of Sarasota and
[1:50:46] when they got there when they opened the
[1:50:48] door to get out it wasn't Christian rock
[1:50:50] and roll music playing it was just plain
[1:50:52] old Led Zeppelin
[1:50:53] it was just straight-up music from the
[1:50:55] pit of hell you say well the recipe
[1:51:00] we've got to do something to draw the
[1:51:01] masses in friends were not here for the
[1:51:04] masses
[1:51:04] he's a Gleaner he picks that one he says
[1:51:07] that one's mine
[1:51:08] that one's mine that was mine he picked
[1:51:10] you out of all the West Palm Beach
[1:51:12] think about how special you are out of
[1:51:16] all the people I don't know how many
[1:51:17] people live in this city he said but
[1:51:19] you're mine you're predestinated to
[1:51:21] emulate me under every process under
[1:51:30] every prophet I'm hurryin under every
[1:51:32] prophets message it Israel God of birth
[1:51:34] pain because that these prophets would
[1:51:37] come on the scene after the theologian
[1:51:39] and the clergyman have the churches in
[1:51:42] all organized form and when the prophets
[1:51:44] come on the scene with thus saith the
[1:51:46] Lord they shipped them churches and
[1:51:48] she had a birth pain finally she had
[1:51:50] birds planes birth pains bum on up into
[1:51:53] the delivered son of the gospel which
[1:51:55] was the word itself made flesh so the
[1:52:00] church really a birth pains tonight
[1:52:02] again for the deliverance of the son of
[1:52:04] God the Son of God to come again all the
[1:52:07] theologians and all the systems and all
[1:52:09] the other denominations had rotted right
[1:52:12] out from under us so we see a birth pain
[1:52:15] and the message from God always throws
[1:52:17] that message throws the church and the
[1:52:20] heavier pain but after a while she's
[1:52:22] going to be delivered of a bride the
[1:52:24] church is delivered of a bride he said
[1:52:27] come out of her my people that will
[1:52:30] bring forth Jesus Christ to his bride
[1:52:33] growing the message of the hour revealed
[1:52:37] Jesus Christ to you and in doing so
[1:52:39] where were you at the cross have you
[1:52:42] ever thought about that you were in him
[1:52:44] what come forth from his body that day
[1:52:46] blood water and spirit what are you made
[1:52:51] of blood water and spirit and every
[1:52:53] birth what comes first water blood and
[1:52:56] then a spirit like a brother just told
[1:52:58] me just a few moments ago he said with
[1:53:01] every birth it's a mess every birth is a
[1:53:04] mess so that day at Calvary Jesus Christ
[1:53:07] was slayed and looked to the rest of the
[1:53:10] world like he could never come back
[1:53:12] he was beaten he was bruised he was torn
[1:53:15] to pieces of course no bone of his body
[1:53:17] was broken according to the prophecy of
[1:53:19] the word but in him put in a grave that
[1:53:22] day but what come forth from that that
[1:53:25] day you and they ought to see you in
[1:53:28] 2018 he was waiting for a bride that he
[1:53:32] could live in that's the reason we can
[1:53:37] make the statement today that the
[1:53:39] message is alive the Word of God is
[1:53:42] alive why because it's living in you
[1:53:45] it's changing you and molding you and
[1:53:48] making you into the image of Almighty
[1:53:50] God that's why I say Prince it's not you
[1:53:54] trying it's not you runnings not him
[1:53:56] their will if you're in the running but
[1:53:57] God
[1:53:59] with mercy its God then directly I heard
[1:54:05] a real sweet music come again and here
[1:54:07] come that same little bride coming by
[1:54:09] again and he said this is what comes out
[1:54:12] though and when she walked by she's
[1:54:15] exactly like the ones was in the first
[1:54:18] place walking to the step of the music
[1:54:20] of God's Word marching on by and when I
[1:54:22] saw it I stood there with both hands up
[1:54:24] crying like that said would he come - he
[1:54:27] was standing out there saying because
[1:54:28] you know she was a couple of them
[1:54:31] towards the back of that line started
[1:54:32] looking at the worldly Church I don't
[1:54:35] know what she was thinking but she was
[1:54:36] looking at that maybe there was just a
[1:54:38] little attraction well maybe that's my a
[1:54:40] friend of mine they used to be in this
[1:54:41] line going up and now they're in that
[1:54:43] line going down and maybe I'll straddle
[1:54:45] the line don't straddle the line friends
[1:54:47] you can't do it but he said something
[1:54:49] kind of got distracted and began to look
[1:54:51] at that other church it was worldly and
[1:54:52] dancing and doing immoral things of the
[1:54:54] world oh there's a dance it's alright
[1:54:56] but it's a godly Holy Ghost and it's
[1:54:59] when the power of God comes down on
[1:55:01] you and then you advance but you don't
[1:55:04] have to do these worldly twitches and
[1:55:06] things that they do it in the world to
[1:55:08] draw attention to themselves
[1:55:09] when you dance you're drawing the
[1:55:10] attention of the Father
[1:55:19] [Music]
[1:55:23] do you believe Jesus Christ is the same
[1:55:26] yesterday today and forever you see the
[1:55:29] Bible says it's through the foolishness
[1:55:30] of preaching that men's souls are saved
[1:55:33] like I told you before I'm closing I
[1:55:36] don't know who has the Holy Ghost and
[1:55:37] who don't but Jesus Christ is here this
[1:55:40] morning if you don't have it in your
[1:55:42] life if you need healing whatever you
[1:55:44] have need of Jesus Christ is here to
[1:55:47] answer your need he said I am the same
[1:55:49] yesterday today and forever
[1:55:51] he's the Alpha and the Omega he is the
[1:55:54] enve he was at with the in between is
[1:55:56] that right he's here in his fullness
[1:55:59] today whatever you have need of what he
[1:56:03] speaks to you through his word the
[1:56:04] brides responsible be it unto me
[1:56:07] according to thy word be it unto me
[1:56:12] according to that word it may bring
[1:56:15] reproach it may bring things upon you
[1:56:18] that you just not wanting to do but you
[1:56:21] responsibly be it unto me
[1:56:23] if the musicians that come forth this
[1:56:25] morning be it unto me
[1:56:28] the little girls response to the word
[1:56:31] for her name let's just bow our heads
[1:56:35] gracious Heavenly Father while you're
[1:56:37] here while you're moving amongst your
[1:56:40] people Lord we know that where the

[1:56:57] your children were bound in a cave and
[1:56:59] big heavy bars have them held up bound
[1:57:02] up and they said brother branham
[1:57:04] delivers he said I can't do it I just
[1:57:06] physically can't do it and then you
[1:57:08] appeared to him and he said deliver
[1:57:10] those people he looked back at them and
[1:57:12] said in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:57:15] House of Hell give way Oh glory to God
[1:57:20] Lord Jesus and he said that there was
[1:57:23] great popping and creaking as those
[1:57:25] doors had to give way to the name of
[1:57:29] Lord Jesus Christ so what there is this
