[16:20] and by his grace and his mercy
[16:23] we shall see the salvation of the lord
[16:26] so uh we're going to turn into a
[16:28] scripture tonight we're going to read
[16:30] joe well chapter 2 verse
[16:34] 25.
[16:39] you could say amen when you're ready
[16:56] all right so it reads and i
[17:00] will restore to you the years that the
[17:03] locusts
[17:04] hath eaten the cankerworm and the
[17:07] caterpillar
[17:08] and the palmer worm my great army which
[17:11] i sent among you
[17:13] and you shall eat in plenty and be
[17:15] satisfied and praise the name of the
[17:17] lord
[17:18] your god that hath dwelt that has dealt
[17:21] wondrously with you and my people shall
[17:23] never be ashamed
[17:25] and ye shall know that i am in the midst
[17:27] of israel
[17:29] and that i am the lord your god and none
[17:31] else and my people shall never be
[17:33] ashamed
[17:34] and it shall come to pass afterward that
[17:37] i will pour out my spirit
[17:39] upon flesh all flesh and your sons and
[17:41] daughters
[17:42] shall prophesy your old man shall dream
[17:44] dreams your young men
[17:46] shall see visions and also upon the
[17:49] servants and upon the handmaids in those
[17:51] days will i pour out my
[17:52] spirit and i will show wanders in the
[17:55] heavens
[17:55] and in the earth blood and fire and
[17:58] pillars of smoke
[17:59] the sun shall be turned into darkness
[18:01] and the moon into blood before the great
[18:04] and terrible day of the lord come amen
[18:08] may the lord has a blessing to his
[18:09] reading you may have your seats
[18:15] again it's uh it's an honor and a
[18:17] privilege to be before you tonight
[18:20] i trust that something will be said to
[18:21] encourage you and to inspire you
[18:24] just a little thought the lord placed in
[18:26] my heart
[18:27] and uh if i could use as a title tonight
[18:30] it would be knowing him
[18:34] i wish to also read um
[18:39] this uh so it says here uh it shall be
[18:43] one day that shall be known to the lord
[18:46] not day nor
[18:46] nights but it shall come to pass that at
[18:50] evening time it shall be light
[18:53] now we're certainly living in a time
[18:56] where it's both great and terrible and i
[18:59] believe
[19:00] brother branham himself even said if he
[19:02] had a chance to choose
[19:04] any day to live in he would choose this
[19:06] day this age
[19:08] uh though it's a terrible day it's also
[19:10] a great day for the believers
[19:12] and certainly the days of king david the
[19:16] days of what jesus even walked on the
[19:18] earth
[19:19] but never was a time like today and
[19:23] i realized that with bef within the uh
[19:27] before the found before the in beginning
[19:30] it was always a matter of knowing who
[19:32] god is
[19:33] and knowing that he he not he wasn't not
[19:36] only was but he
[19:37] is right he's the great i am
[19:40] and now
[19:45] through trials there's many ways you're
[19:47] going to know god
[19:48] you're going to know god through trials
[19:51] and
[19:52] as as david as david said uh david
[19:56] one that went through many trials now
[19:59] the enemy
[20:00] never attacks you to to know to get your
[20:02] life
[20:03] he's limited and he knows he can't get
[20:05] your life
[20:06] but he can try to take your joy and your
[20:09] joy is connected
[20:11] to what god is able to do in your life
[20:13] through you
[20:15] right now in the message
[20:20] everlasting life and how to receive it
[20:23] 54 12 31 the prophet says
[20:27] you'll go through trials and troubles
[20:29] and ups and downs
[20:30] and misunderstood now he said that
[20:33] doesn't have
[20:34] one thing to do with it so when israel
[20:36] backslid
[20:37] and went down to egypt they were
[20:39] black-slid but they never lost their
[20:41] covenant
[20:42] and that's the thing the devil is always
[20:46] trying to attack you with the joy that
[20:48] god has filled your heart with
[20:50] but he can't touch your she can't touch
[20:52] your life
[20:53] and if you can be if you can use god as
[20:55] a shield
[20:56] to not have still your joy you find
[20:59] yourself inspired
[21:01] now
[21:04] i wish to read here
[21:10] one who had stood the test one who
[21:14] went through many trials was job right
[21:18] job lost all that he had we know that
[21:21] he lost his family his uh his wife his
[21:24] daughters
[21:25] his sons uh all all of his blessings
[21:29] he lost all of that but god has such a
[21:31] confidence in job
[21:33] where he allowed he gave permission to
[21:36] the devil to attack him
[21:38] he said uh he said
[21:42] he said uh in the ninth chapter of the
[21:44] first joke of the first uh
[21:45] chapter of job he said
[21:51] now the sixth the sixth verse the first
[21:53] chapter now there was a
[21:55] there was a day when the sons of god
[21:56] came to present themselves
[21:58] before god and satan came also among
[22:00] them
[22:01] and the lord said unto satan winds come
[22:04] as thou
[22:05] then satan answered the lord and said
[22:07] from going to and fro in the earth
[22:10] and from walking up and down in it and
[22:12] the lord said unto satan
[22:14] as thou considered my servant job there
[22:16] is none like him in the earth a perfect
[22:19] and upright man one that feareth and
[22:22] issue with evil
[22:23] then satan answered unto the lord and
[22:25] said thus job fear god for naught
[22:28] has thou not made an edge about him
[22:31] and about his house about all that he
[22:33] has on every side
[22:35] that has blessed him the works the work
[22:37] of his hands
[22:38] and his substance is increased in the
[22:40] land but put forth down hand now and
[22:43] touch
[22:43] all that he hath and he will curse thee
[22:46] to thy face
[22:48] and i want to stop here but the the god
[22:51] had a confidence that he knew
[22:53] job was not going to curse him
[22:57] and if i can tell you god has the same
[23:00] confidence in you tonight
[23:02] he has the confidence because you are
[23:04] his creation you are part of him
[23:07] right now if joel's possession
[23:12] were in the power of satan he had the
[23:15] power to attack
[23:16] all that job had but job's greatest
[23:19] possession
[23:20] was his fear to god because his fear
[23:24] was surrendered was what he feared was
[23:26] that he was surrendered to god
[23:28] he had a fear to the lord and no matter
[23:30] what happened to his possessions
[23:32] his possession of predestination could
[23:34] not be compromised
[23:36] and all that mattered to god
[23:39] was that only upon himself which he told
[23:42] the enemy
[23:43] put not foot thy hand and once god
[23:46] speaks
[23:47] the enemy backs away once god speaks
[23:50] nothing else can stand against it and
[23:52] that was a direct order
[23:53] by by the lord himself so
[23:58] your greatest possession is that which
[24:01] your enemy cannot touch
[24:03] it's your victory and no matter what you
[24:05] go through in this lifetime
[24:07] the enemy cannot come close to your
[24:09] victory
[24:11] now through droves trials
[24:16] satan saw defeat but god saw victory
[24:19] satan saw losses but god saw opportunity
[24:23] satan saw sorrow but god saw strength
[24:26] satan saw discouragement but god saw
[24:28] inspiration and i wish to say job
[24:31] in the midst of his trial got so
[24:33] inspired
[24:34] that he started to prophesy he started
[24:37] to say things out of his
[24:39] experience with god at the time that no
[24:41] matter what the situation was
[24:43] he knew that his redeemer lives
[24:46] he knew though although skin though the
[24:49] skin worms destroy his body
[24:51] he would see god in his flesh and
[24:54] whatever you're going through tonight
[24:56] an inspired son or daughter of god is no
[24:58] match for
[24:59] motivated devil no matter how motivated
[25:02] the enemy is
[25:03] if you have the inspiration of god to
[25:06] strike your heart
[25:07] there's nothing that the enemy can do
[25:12] now
[25:14] job knew god through his trial his trial
[25:17] was to produce something greater out of
[25:19] him
[25:20] and job started looking around now
[25:23] when job couldn't look at his friends he
[25:26] couldn't look at his wife
[25:27] he couldn't look at his blessings he
[25:30] started looking around and as he looked
[25:32] around
[25:32] he saw nothing but life right he looked
[25:36] around in the
[25:36] seventh in joe 14 the seventh
[25:40] verse he said for there is hope of a
[25:42] tree
[25:43] if it be cut down that it will sprout
[25:46] again
[25:47] and that the tender branch thereof will
[25:49] not cease
[25:50] through the root thereof wax
[25:53] though the root thereof whacks oil in
[25:55] the earth and the stalk thereof die in
[25:57] the ground
[25:58] yet through the sin of water it will bud
[26:01] it will bring forth bows like a plant
[26:04] when job couldn't see or couldn't look
[26:07] at his blessings anymore
[26:08] when he couldn't look at his increase
[26:10] anymore when he couldn't look at his
[26:12] family or
[26:13] his good the things that made him happy
[26:16] the things that gave him joy
[26:18] when he couldn't look at those things
[26:19] anymore he just looked around
[26:22] so look around you tonight if you you
[26:24] don't have to look so far god is right
[26:26] there
[26:27] if you just look around you you'll find
[26:28] the inspiration
[26:31] now he then started to realize
[26:34] he said but in man he couldn't
[26:37] understand it he said in
[26:38] but a man dieth and wasted the way
[26:41] yea man giveth up the ghost where is he
[26:45] as the waters fell from the sea and the
[26:47] flood decayeth and drive up
[26:49] so man lies down and riseth and rest and
[26:53] riseth not till the heavens be no more
[26:56] they shall not awake
[26:57] nor be raised out of the sleep thou what
[27:00] is hide me in the grave
[27:01] thou what is keep me secret until thy
[27:04] wrath
[27:05] be passed that thou would disappoint me
[27:07] a set time and remember me
[27:09] if a man dies shall he live again so
[27:13] job at this point is identifying man
[27:15] with failure and dead things
[27:18] but when he got inspired he knew who god
[27:21] was
[27:22] when he got inspired he realized no
[27:24] matter what his situation was
[27:27] god had the final say now first peter
[27:34] chapter 4 the 12th verse
[27:37] it says beloved thinking not strange
[27:40] concerning the fiery trial which is to
[27:42] try you
[27:43] as though some strange thing happened to
[27:46] you
[27:47] but rejoicing as much as you are
[27:49] partakers of christ's sufferings
[27:51] that when his glory shall be revealed he
[27:53] may be glad who also with exceeding joy
[27:56] if ye be reproached for the name of
[27:59] christ
[27:59] happy are you for the spirit of glory
[28:02] and of god rested upon you
[28:04] and on their part there he is evil
[28:06] spoken of but on your part
[28:08] he is glorified now that's wonderful to
[28:12] know
[28:12] that whatever you're going through god
[28:14] is being glorified
[28:16] you may not see the glory but god is
[28:18] being honored and glorified through your
[28:20] trial
[28:21] it's getting to a place where you
[28:23] realize that god is not dealing with you
[28:25] as a sinner
[28:26] but as a saint this like job job was not
[28:30] a sinner he'd never sinned against god
[28:32] but but he had to come to recognition of
[28:34] that
[28:36] the prophet says this message
[28:39] for him will i accept now watch
[28:42] that man that had went through trials
[28:45] that man who had been purged
[28:47] god was not dealing with a sinner now he
[28:50] was dealing with a saint
[28:51] a man that's been purged by god proving
[28:54] to satan that there were mortals
[28:56] who would serve him in the face of
[28:58] conflict
[29:00] praise the lord amen
[29:06] now i'm gonna go to
[29:11] you also know god through faith
[29:14] you know god through faith when faith is
[29:17] revealed to you
[29:18] you know exactly who god is and and
[29:21] revealed faith
[29:22] is the inspiration of god being
[29:25] entrusted
[29:26] in you and that same inspiration
[29:28] produces the power of god
[29:31] so you are entrusted with the very power
[29:33] of god to do all the things that god did
[29:36] then what entrusted means to be
[29:39] entrusted with something
[29:40] is to be assigned a responsibility for
[29:43] doing something
[29:45] and someone that was entrusted with such
[29:47] a responsibility
[29:48] was moses and exodus
[29:51] the 14th chapter and uh
[29:54] this is this is where god was dealing
[29:57] with israel
[29:58] as a nation um and as he was dealing
[30:02] with israel
[30:03] he hardened the heart of pharaoh god
[30:05] heart in the heart of pharaoh
[30:08] so much so israel fled out of egypt went
[30:11] to the red
[30:12] went to the um they were cornered by a
[30:14] red sea
[30:15] and mo
[30:19] um pharaoh in his uh and his army
[30:22] rose up against them ran right after
[30:24] them
[30:25] now when israel was cornered by the red
[30:29] sea
[30:30] it was it was the end of the egyptians
[30:32] but it was the beginning of god
[30:34] and many times when you are pressured in
[30:36] this lifetime
[30:38] it's not your it's not your end but it's
[30:41] your beginning
[30:42] sometimes god will take you to a place
[30:44] of of of discomfort a place where you're
[30:46] not uncomfortable
[30:48] only so you can grow farther sometimes
[30:50] you may feel like you're taking a step
[30:52] backwards
[30:53] but you're taking a step backwards to
[30:54] take a greater step forward
[30:56] and that's where god can inspire you
[30:59] it's recognizing that you're getting to
[31:01] a place where you're nobody
[31:03] so he can be that somebody in you
[31:07] don't let that pressure don't let the
[31:08] pressure of the enemy discourage you
[31:10] tonight
[31:11] now many times
[31:16] many times god will allow uncomfortable
[31:18] situation to perform his miracle
[31:20] to bring you out and take you in and
[31:23] moses
[31:24] said unto the people this is the 13th
[31:26] verse
[31:28] of the 14th chapter and out of
[31:31] inspiration moses said unto the people
[31:33] fear ye not
[31:34] stand still and see the salvation of the
[31:37] lord
[31:38] which he will show you today for the
[31:40] egyptians whom we see
[31:43] whom you have seen today ye shall see
[31:45] them again no more forever
[31:47] the lord shall fight for you and you
[31:49] shall hold your peace
[31:51] now moses by in inspiration prophesied
[31:54] the end the
[31:55] end of his enemies by the spoken word of
[31:57] authority
[31:58] and god had to approve what moses said
[32:02] because he was entrusted with the
[32:03] responsibility and that responsibility
[32:06] was not the responsibility of his
[32:08] leadership
[32:08] it was not the responsibility of his
[32:11] position
[32:12] it was not the responsibility of of who
[32:14] he was but it was a responsibility of
[32:17] faith
[32:18] and as a believer you are entrusted with
[32:20] the responsibility of faith
[32:22] when you have the faith and god inspires
[32:25] you by his word
[32:28] uh in matthew 25 the matthew 21 the 21st
[32:31] 21st verse jesus answered and said unto
[32:35] them
[32:35] verily verily i say unto you if ye have
[32:38] faith and doubt not
[32:40] ye shall not only do that which is done
[32:43] to the fig tree
[32:44] but also if ye shall say to unto this
[32:47] mountain
[32:48] be thou removed and be thou cast into
[32:50] the sea it shall be done
[32:52] and if we just read that again it it
[32:54] never said if i
[32:56] say unto this mountain if you say unto
[32:58] this mountain
[33:00] and that's the responsibility that you
[33:02] have with faith tonight
[33:04] if you say you have to spoken word
[33:06] authority in your possession
[33:08] no matter what the situation is if you
[33:11] say
[33:11] it shall be done unto you
[33:17] now the children of israel went through
[33:21] the red sea
[33:23] and they witnessed the mighty miracle of
[33:25] god
[33:26] but now you can know god's blessings and
[33:29] not know who god is
[33:31] you can know god's miracles and wonders
[33:33] and all of his
[33:35] goodness and never come to who god
[33:37] really is
[33:38] and the what the only way you'll come to
[33:42] know god
[33:43] is by a true born-again experience and i
[33:46] once heard this
[33:48] but the new birth is not man
[33:52] coming out of earth to go to heaven for
[33:55] salvation
[33:56] it's the it's the god of heaven himself
[33:58] coming down and
[34:00] dwelling in men and when god himself can
[34:04] dwell in
[34:04] you and have his preeminence in you
[34:08] you have that same authority you have
[34:10] the same power
[34:11] of the word exodus
[34:18] 16
[34:20] the first verse i wish to read this
[34:23] it says and they took their journey from
[34:25] ellen
[34:27] and all the congregation of the children
[34:29] of israel came unto the wilderness of
[34:31] sin
[34:32] which is between ellen and sinai on the
[34:35] 15th day of the second month
[34:37] after their departing out of the land of
[34:39] egypt and the whole congregation of chil
[34:42] of the children of israel murmured
[34:44] against moses
[34:45] an errand in the wilderness and the
[34:47] children of israel said unto them
[34:50] what to god we had died by the hand of
[34:52] the lord in the land of egypt
[34:54] when we sat by the flesh pots and when
[34:56] we did eat bread to the full
[34:58] for ye have brought us into the
[35:00] wilderness to kill the whole assembly
[35:02] with hunger now the these uh the
[35:05] children of israel did not know who god
[35:07] is they just
[35:08] experienced a mighty miracle a mighty
[35:11] blessings they saw the end of their
[35:13] enemies
[35:14] but never got to know who god really was
[35:18] and the only way you'll nev you'll
[35:21] know who god is is by a revelation
[35:25] the revelation comes through the blood
[35:28] the prophet says here christ is the
[35:30] mystery revealed
[35:33] but the revelation and this is paragraph
[35:35] 255
[35:36] but the revelation come through the
[35:38] blood through jesus christ
[35:40] who is the blood of god created blood in
[35:43] the room
[35:44] and mary and paul knew him by revelation
[35:47] and that's how we know him today it's
[35:50] all it's the only way you can know him
[35:52] not say i'm a methodist that means
[35:55] nothing
[35:55] i'm a baptist that means nothing i'm
[35:57] catholic that means nothing
[35:59] but by the revelation that god has
[36:01] revealed a word to you
[36:04] he is the word and the word how you know
[36:07] it's revealed it lives itself
[36:09] and expresses his self through you
[36:12] and i believe somewhere brother branham
[36:14] mentioned that
[36:15] paul never walked the day with jesus he
[36:18] never saw jesus
[36:20] in the flesh face to face but he knew
[36:23] jesus more than all the apostles did
[36:26] right
[36:27] because he had a revelation of who jesus
[36:29] was
[36:30] he knew jesus the same way peter knew
[36:32] jesus
[36:33] upon this rock i'll build my church
[36:36] right
[36:37] jesus never jesus sitting there with
[36:39] with peter never told peter
[36:42] who he was but it took a revelation it
[36:44] took a time where
[36:46] where god g god himself from heaven had
[36:48] to reveal
[36:49] to peter this is who he is
[36:53] in paragraph 242 christ is the mystery
[36:56] revealed
[36:58] says did you notice paul never knew
[37:01] jesus physically
[37:03] paul never knew him the only way that
[37:04] paul knew him was by revelation by a
[37:06] vision
[37:07] following knew jesus by revelation
[37:11] peter had seen him in flesh but he
[37:13] didn't know him by inf by flesh
[37:15] because jesus said so flesh and blood
[37:17] didn't reveal it to you
[37:18] even my own life didn't reveal it to you
[37:20] but my father which is in heaven
[37:23] has revealed this thing to you that he
[37:25] is the word of god and upon this rock
[37:28] i'll build my church and paul who was
[37:31] persecuting christians
[37:32] thought he was doing right until he had
[37:34] a personal visitation from
[37:36] the lord and as he
[37:40] as as you go through this journey of
[37:42] life
[37:45] god is calling you to have us a personal
[37:48] experience where he can inspire you from
[37:50] day to day
[37:51] not today and gone tomorrow but an
[37:54] inspiration where you can be
[37:55] in his presence or he can be in his
[37:58] anointing
[37:59] in the chapter five i wish to read in
[38:02] acts
[38:07] the third verse paul says word says as
[38:10] he
[38:11] journeyed here as he journeyed here
[38:14] he came near damascus and suddenly there
[38:17] shine
[38:17] around him a light from heaven and he
[38:20] fell to the earth and heard a voice
[38:22] saying unto him
[38:23] saul saul why persecute this thou me
[38:26] and he said who art thou lord
[38:30] who art thou lord and the lord said i am
[38:33] jesus whom thou
[38:34] persecuted it is hard for thee to kick
[38:37] the
[38:37] against the pricks and he trembling and
[38:40] astonish said lord
[38:42] what will thou have me to do and the
[38:44] lord said unto him arise and go to a
[38:46] city
[38:47] and it shall be told thee what he must
[38:50] do
[38:50] and ever since that experience paul
[38:52] never remained the same
[38:55] now one of the many ways that
[38:58] paul knew the lord was through an
[39:00] all-sufficient grace
[39:03] paul in second corinthians chapter 12
[39:08] where paul got to a place where he
[39:11] he recognized god was perfected in his
[39:14] weakness
[39:15] how many of us when we're going through
[39:18] a tough situation can
[39:20] glory in our infirmities paul got to a
[39:24] place where
[39:25] he had to know and recognize that he was
[39:28] completely nothing
[39:29] and this is where god would be able to
[39:31] lift them up this is where
[39:33] god himself who has the power
[39:37] can can fulfill his
[39:40] his word and paul's life
[39:44] now inspiration can only strike
[39:47] in the right atmosphere it takes the
[39:49] right atmosphere for you to receive the
[39:51] inspiration of god
[39:53] the inspiration of his word it's the
[39:56] it's the atmosphere of faith faith
[39:59] when that when you're in the atmosphere
[40:01] of faith it knows no defeat
[40:04] faith knows no condemnation faith only
[40:07] knows the word
[40:08] and when you're in the atmosphere of
[40:10] faith and only in atmospheric faith can
[40:13] you
[40:13] be inspired by the word of god i wish to
[40:16] use someone who was inspired by his word
[40:20] who was inspired by god himself abraham
[40:24] abraham was given a promise that he
[40:27] would have a son
[40:29] and even in his old age abraham did not
[40:32] doubt
[40:34] in genesis the 22nd chapter
[40:37] the seventh verse
[40:42] in that chapter abraham was put to the
[40:45] test
[40:45] after fulfilling what god said that he
[40:48] would have a son
[40:49] what was thought to be impossible and
[40:52] now
[40:52] after fulfilling that promise god's put
[40:56] god puts him to the test that
[40:58] take that same son and bring him to the
[41:00] altar and sacrifice him
[41:02] now what strike me in seventh verse
[41:06] it says and isaac spoke spake unto
[41:09] abraham his father and said my father
[41:12] and he said here i am my son and he said
[41:14] behold the fire and the wood
[41:17] but where is the lamb for a burnt
[41:19] offering and abraham said my son
[41:22] god will provide himself a land for the
[41:25] birth offering
[41:26] so they went both of them together
[41:30] and in the atmosphere of faith abraham
[41:33] believed
[41:34] that the lord would provide himself a
[41:37] lamb for the burnt offering
[41:39] god did not god did not tell him to say
[41:42] that
[41:43] but abraham knew that what god had
[41:46] promised
[41:47] god would fulfill and whatever you're
[41:49] going through tonight
[41:51] is the mere reality of a of you obeying
[41:54] god
[41:54] more important than what it's costing
[41:56] you is
[41:58] are you an atmosphere when you're
[42:00] looking
[42:01] at the cost of what is cost of what is
[42:04] what you're going through
[42:05] then the promise that god has given you
[42:08] abraham had his eyes
[42:09] fixed on what god had said what god had
[42:12] spoken
[42:14] and
[42:19] now he goes on to say the ninth verse
[42:23] and they came to a place which god had
[42:25] told of him
[42:26] and abraham did build an altar there and
[42:29] laid the wood in order
[42:31] and bound isaac his son and laid him on
[42:33] the altar upon the wood
[42:35] and abraham stretched forth his hand and
[42:38] took the knife to slay his son and the
[42:39] angel of the lord
[42:41] called unto him out of heaven and said
[42:43] abraham abraham
[42:45] and he said here am i and he said lay
[42:48] not thine hand
[42:49] upon the lad neither do thou anything
[42:51] unto him
[42:52] for now i know it that thou fears god
[42:56] seeing that hat seeing that thou has not
[42:58] withheld thy son
[42:59] but only son from me and abraham lifted
[43:02] up his eyes and looked and behold behind
[43:05] him
[43:05] a ram caught in the thicket of his horns
[43:09] now what what are you withholding from
[43:12] god
[43:12] or what are you willing to withhold from
[43:15] god tonight
[43:16] where god can provide himself as your
[43:19] sacrifice
[43:20] himself as your lamb and
[43:23] to know him is to know life and in this
[43:27] hour
[43:27] it's gonna take a personal visitation
[43:32] from god where he's inspiring from day
[43:34] to day
[43:35] there's so many noise there's so many uh
[43:38] breaking news but at the end of the day
[43:42] that's all gonna fade away i think i
[43:44] said this before where
[43:46] we ought to just put the world on mute
[43:48] and put god on live where we can hear
[43:51] him daily
[43:52] where whatever god is saying we're in a
[43:54] position to receive
[43:55] we're in a position to to act we're in a
[43:58] position to go forward
[44:00] when abraham was given this order the
[44:02] bible says he woke up early
[44:04] in the morning and in the midst of his
[44:07] faithfulness god show up in a mighty way
[44:10] it's gonna take to know him abraham knew
[44:13] him
[44:13] moses knew him the prophets knew him
[44:17] and they knew this very day it would be
[44:20] a great and terrible day of the
[44:22] lord but yet in this hour there shall be
[44:24] light in the evening time
[44:26] and that's the hour that we live in we
[44:28] live in the hour where we will see
[44:30] the salvation of the lord the salvation
[44:33] of the lord lies in you
[44:34] you are his salvation because his life
[44:38] is living inside of you he just wants us
[44:41] to get to a place where we're
[44:42] wrecked where we understand and
[44:44] recognize that we're
[44:46] insufficient but his grace is sufficient
[44:49] for us
[44:50] his perfect his strength is perfected in
[44:52] our weakness
[44:54] and the inspiration strikes when faith
[44:57] is revealed
[44:58] and the faith is god's faith is not your
[45:01] faith
[45:02] we could never do it on our own we're
[45:04] unworthy to begin with
[45:06] but god himself came down
[45:09] took our place so that we could take his
[45:12] place
[45:13] so that his his faith could be could
[45:16] abide in us
[45:17] day by day
[45:23] another person who was inspired by god
[45:27] and who knew god by love was the
[45:29] samaritan woman
[45:32] now jesus was walking by and
[45:35] thought to to just stop at this time
[45:39] we'll just go and read it this is john
[45:41] chapter 4.
[45:58] all right john chapter four
[46:04] we'll start reading at the
[46:08] start reading at the sixth verse it says
[46:11] now
[46:11] jacob's well was there jesus therefore
[46:14] being wary with his journey
[46:16] sat thus on the well and it was about
[46:18] the sixth hour
[46:20] there cometh the woman of samaria to
[46:22] draw water
[46:23] jesus said unto her give me the drink
[46:27] for his disciples were gone away from
[46:29] the city to buy meat
[46:31] then saith the woman of samaria unto him
[46:33] how is it that
[46:34] some that be thou being a jew asking
[46:38] drink to me of me which am i
[46:42] which am ace woman of samaria for the
[46:44] jews have no dealings with the
[46:46] samaritans
[46:47] jesus answered and said unto her if thou
[46:50] knowest the gift of god
[46:52] and who it is that saith to thee give me
[46:55] the drink
[46:56] thou would has have asked of him and he
[46:58] would have given thee the living water
[47:02] now here
[47:06] jesus begins to speak things of this
[47:09] woman's life
[47:10] that no one else could she was in the
[47:13] presence
[47:15] of life never before was she
[47:18] in the presence of of life but at this
[47:22] very
[47:22] hour she
[47:25] prophet has said she may have gone grown
[47:28] up to
[47:29] hear the the word of the lord to know
[47:32] that
[47:33] there will be a day where the prophet
[47:35] has said
[47:36] a virgin shall conceive she had heard
[47:38] all of that
[47:40] but now she was in the presence of it
[47:42] and
[47:43] god strike her heart with inspiration
[47:47] by the spoken word she was able to
[47:50] recognize who he was
[47:53] and she knew him by love
[47:56] and because of the love that was in her
[47:58] she went and told
[47:59] everybody about this experience
[48:03] and this experience caused many to come
[48:05] running to god
[48:06] now my question what is your experience
[48:09] with god causing your french to do
[48:11] what is your experience with god causing
[48:13] your neighbor to do
[48:15] the scripture says yo
[48:18] my disciples will be identified with me
[48:20] by the love that you have with one
[48:22] another
[48:23] the experience that you have had with
[48:25] the lord has it renewed itself
[48:28] david never said restore to me my
[48:30] salvation but the joy of my salvation
[48:33] which means your experience needs to be
[48:35] renewed from day to day
[48:38] and when that experience is renewed the
[48:41] inspiration that god has given you you
[48:42] can inspire those around you
[48:45] you can inspire your neighbors and it's
[48:47] the experience the inspiration of the
[48:49] word
[48:50] and that inspiration creates it's the
[48:53] power of the spoken word
[48:54] dwelling in you and with the power of
[48:57] the spoken word there's nothing that
[48:58] shall be impossible
[49:00] it says if you say unto this mountain
[49:03] if you say not if i say if you say unto
[49:06] this mountain
[49:07] be thou remove it shall be done unto you
[49:10] god bless you
[49:17] [Applause]
[49:23] i was encouraged by that scripture
[49:27] matthew 21 the 21st verse
[49:31] if you say unto this mountain
[49:34] be thou removed and not doubt in your
[49:36] heart
[49:37] ye shall have what you have asked
[49:41] i pray who are watching online
[49:45] whoever you are it takes
[49:48] a personal experience with god to know
[49:51] who god is
[49:53] you can know god in many ways but if you
[49:56] don't know him by life
[49:58] where he has purged you from your ways
[50:00] where he has
[50:02] brought you out of darkness into his
[50:04] light
[50:05] then you don't know him yet the children
[50:08] of israel knew him
[50:09] in many ways but when it came time to
[50:12] enter into the promised land
[50:13] it was just joshua and caleb they went
[50:16] and came back and said we are more than
[50:18] able
[50:19] to conquer we're more than able to go
[50:22] it's it's to
[50:23] get to a place where we where you know
[50:26] that you are more than able to conquer
[50:28] that the enemy that had you bound you
[50:31] have him bound
[50:32] the enemy that had you chained up he's
[50:35] under your feet
[50:36] can we say man amen let us bound the
[50:39] word of prayer
[50:44] heavenly father lord we want to thank
[50:47] you god that you have
[50:49] you have called us that we may come to
[50:53] know you father
[50:55] lord we can only say we know you because
[50:57] you've knew us lord
[51:00] father i pray that your inspiration by
[51:03] your word
[51:04] would help us to know father what we
[51:07] have in our possessions
[51:09] that no matter how the enemy attacks
[51:12] there's one thing that he can't do

[52:00] that it would
[52:00] inspire from the youngest to the oldest
[52:04] lord

[52:10] bottled in but may we also be an
[52:12] inspiration to our neighbors
[52:14] to those around us that from day to day

[52:20] it would be clear to others lord just as

[53:47] how many enjoyed that
[53:51] amen knowing knowing him
[53:55] amen i was just looking for the quote i
[53:58] read a quote
[53:59] once where the prophet was saying it's
[54:02] not good enough
[54:03] to know your creed it's not good enough
[54:06] to know your catechism
[54:08] you know what is it called did i say
[54:10] that right
[54:11] catechism it's not good enough
[54:15] and this is the part that got me saying
[54:17] it's not good enough to know your bible
[54:20] and i had to stop and say whoa did he
[54:23] just say that
[54:24] it's not good enough just to know your
[54:27] bible you must know
[54:28] him an experience
[54:32] amen job had an experience with the lord
[54:35] amen paul had an experience with the
[54:38] lord
[54:39] that they knew him amen i believe we all
[54:42] had an experience with the lord that
[54:45] when times
[54:47] the children of israel had an experience
[54:50] they knew that they lord had to live
[54:52] with them they knew what he could do
[54:54] it wasn't just about i often say
[54:57] sometimes
[54:58] uh when i'm talking to people the things
[54:59] that that you've actually been through
[55:00] is one thing when you can tell somebody
[55:02] something
[55:03] of what you read say well uh this is the
[55:06] way that should be done or this is the
[55:08] way it should be done because you read
[55:10] it in the book
[55:10] it's different when you've experienced
[55:14] it
[55:14] and you've come out on the other side
[55:16] and then you can actually tell somebody
[55:18] well
[55:18] this is what i went through and god did
[55:22] this for me
[55:23] he brought me through he can bring you
[55:25] through
[55:26] amen by experience amen
[55:29] so even though sometimes the trials are
[55:31] difficult
[55:33] and and and we go through trials and
[55:35] different things
[55:36] uh i i love the way he just used job
[55:39] there
[55:40] uh the the how the devil just couldn't
[55:42] he had access to
[55:43] all of these earthly things even his own
[55:47] children
[55:48] amen but he had faith that god will
[55:50] restore
[55:51] amen but he couldn't touch his soul amen
[55:55] i believe it was paul that said i'll let
[55:57] nothing
[55:59] separate me from the love of god it's in
[56:01] christ jesus
[56:02] sometimes we go through some real hard
[56:04] trials and see that's the thing
[56:06] of it is that the devil he wants to
[56:08] shake us loose
[56:10] shake our confidence in god he wants to
[56:13] shake us
[56:13] loose from our confidence in god but
[56:15] when you've had an experience
[56:17] and you know my redeemer lifteth
[56:21] no matter what coming no matter how hard
