[32:48] it's wednesday service at 7 30 and we
[32:50] continue our streaming through both
[32:52] twitter and facebook and i want to let
[32:54] those know that are following the
[32:56] service i know sometimes um it's just
[32:59] not a good string and we are depending
[33:02] here on the school's network and uh
[33:05] typically they lock things down they
[33:07] don't even want you going to facebook
[33:09] they don't want you doing things like
[33:10] that so
[33:11] it's a um
[33:13] just a challenge and we ask that you
[33:15] just be patient with us one thing for
[33:17] sure is that we are recording the
[33:20] services and uh after the service is
[33:23] done uh i do thank god brother simba
[33:25] tries to his best to get it quickly
[33:27] released to
[33:29] um
[33:30] youtube and you can go to youtube and
[33:32] there's nothing you typically know
[33:34] issues there at the stream so uh just um
[33:37] um just bear with us pray for us amen
[33:40] pray for the technology you know that
[33:42] that god would just just help us amen
[33:44] through that until we can get into our
[33:46] own place amen so just bear with us amen
[33:49] we appreciate it uh our sunday morning
[33:51] service uh prayer service from 9am to 10
[33:53] a.m uh sunday morning service 10 30 and
[33:56] then also don't forget this friday night
[33:58] our first friday night
[34:00] of the month we always have a tape
[34:02] service that we listen to so you'll
[34:03] listen to this in your house 7 30
[34:06] everyone gather around their house
[34:07] listening to this sermon do you now
[34:11] believe
[34:12] amen and the date on that is 53 1106 so
[34:16] just make sure you get that 53-1106 do
[34:19] you now believe that's the tape that
[34:20] i've been we'll be listening to and
[34:22] don't forget on next
[34:24] uh sunday time changes we go back we
[34:27] fall back an hour
[34:29] uh so uh just remember that you'll get
[34:32] an extra hours sleep on next sunday
[34:34] amen as we uh
[34:36] come
[34:37] for our giving
[34:39] we have multiple ways those that are
[34:41] inside the sanctuary we have a box over
[34:45] here to my right on the table
[34:47] if you want to give just make sure you
[34:49] put your offering in the box we
[34:51] typically ask you to do this as you're
[34:52] coming into the service to do that
[34:55] because the brothers have to take the
[34:57] box and process amen the offering
[35:00] accordingly but uh if you didn't get a
[35:02] chance to put it in before you got here
[35:04] to service maybe while we're doing the
[35:06] specials or something like that just go
[35:08] ahead and put your offering in the box
[35:10] and that'll be fine uh you know because
[35:12] the brothers will take it away and you
[35:13] won't see it again amen so that's for
[35:16] those inside those are to join us online
[35:18] you have multiple ways that you can give
[35:20] one is through cash app one is through
[35:21] paypal and uh if you choose paypal
[35:24] choose the option to send to a friend or
[35:26] family member and use the email address
[35:28] of giving at john423.org
[35:31] also if you want to use cash app our
[35:34] handle is dollar sign spirit and truth t
[35:36] if you want to just mail something into
[35:38] the church the uh the
[35:40] address is there at the bottom of the
[35:42] screen we do
[35:43] we sincerely appreciate
[35:46] all those that give online those that
[35:47] mail offerings in we do receive it and
[35:51] we are we're just really really grateful
[35:54] sometimes i i see things come and i
[35:56] might not even recognize the name
[35:58] of the person that's doing it but
[36:00] somehow god has given us favor and they
[36:02] uh they feel uh
[36:05] a need just to be a part of the ministry
[36:07] and we certainly certainly appreciate it
[36:09] so god bless you amen and god i'll keep

[37:51] door so just wait till the door open
[37:54] you ain't got to kick the door down and

[1:02:57] so pilate
[1:02:59] asked the question
[1:03:01] what is truth
[1:03:04] i like to
[1:03:06] title this message this morning what is
[1:03:08] true
[1:03:10] what is truth
[1:03:14] we see that in this day and time
[1:03:17] uh that we're living in we were much
[1:03:21] like pilate of that day
[1:03:24] truth was
[1:03:25] was was was was it was just so
[1:03:28] fleeting today is is it's so much worse
[1:03:34] we have social media
[1:03:36] now social media
[1:03:39] if i'm not mistaken some maybe some of
[1:03:40] the young folks can help me i think it
[1:03:42] started out with a thing called myspace
[1:03:46] all right see it started out innocent
[1:03:48] it's my space this is my space all right
[1:03:51] and i can create it and decorate it like
[1:03:53] i want this is my space
[1:03:56] the spirit entering in yeah
[1:03:59] and then it just sort of grew from there
[1:04:02] to
[1:04:03] facebook
[1:04:05] so i got it put down i said it went from
[1:04:07] my space
[1:04:09] to my rights
[1:04:12] everybody got a right to say whatever
[1:04:14] they want to say
[1:04:18] whether it be true or not
[1:04:23] see
[1:04:24] so when you have
[1:04:26] things of this nature yeah we have
[1:04:30] uh all of these fake news
[1:04:34] we use there used to be a time when uh
[1:04:37] you you you can believe what you see
[1:04:42] now technology has brought us to a place
[1:04:46] where they can
[1:04:48] take one person's face and put it on
[1:04:51] another person's body and
[1:04:53] they can manipulate
[1:04:55] what you see
[1:04:58] put another person's words to another
[1:05:00] person's voice
[1:05:03] all in the work of deception
[1:05:06] we're living in a terrible time period
[1:05:10] paul got to the i mean pilate was so
[1:05:13] confused in his day and said oh my god
[1:05:15] what is truth
[1:05:17] looking in the face of truth he had the
[1:05:20] question what is truth that's right
[1:05:23] that's right good statement
[1:05:25] and here we are today
[1:05:28] 2021
[1:05:30] right looking in the face of troops
[1:05:34] but people are what is truth amen
[1:05:37] amen
[1:05:38] amen i'd like for you to go with me
[1:05:42] to a scripture
[1:05:43] uh over in acts 19.
[1:05:47] all right work with me as we begin to
[1:05:49] just set a
[1:05:50] platform here
[1:05:53] amen
[1:05:54] what is truth acts 19 to 24
[1:05:58] verse
[1:05:59] a certain man named demetrius now listen
[1:06:02] to this
[1:06:03] name demetrius he was a silversmith
[1:06:07] which made silver shrines for diana
[1:06:11] brought no small game unto the craftsmen
[1:06:16] in other words they made a lot of money
[1:06:18] doing this
[1:06:20] they was they was very wealthy uh uh uh
[1:06:24] uh uh uh uh uh uh making these shrines
[1:06:28] glory
[1:06:29] giving the people is false god right
[1:06:33] false hope right
[1:06:35] now it says whom he called together the
[1:06:39] workmen of like occupation amen my god
[1:06:44] and says sirs ye know that by this craft
[1:06:48] we have our wealth
[1:06:51] right
[1:06:53] okay
[1:06:54] moreover ye see and hear
[1:06:57] that
[1:06:58] not alone at ephesus but throughout all
[1:07:02] asia right
[1:07:04] this paul you see how you say that this
[1:07:07] who this paul
[1:07:09] this
[1:07:10] this fellow
[1:07:12] this fellow
[1:07:13] messing with my money all right
[1:07:16] yeah this fella
[1:07:18] has persuaded
[1:07:20] and turned away much people saying
[1:07:23] that they be
[1:07:24] no god which are made with hands
[1:07:30] so that uh
[1:07:32] not only our craft is in danger to be
[1:07:35] set at naught but also the temple of the
[1:07:38] great goddess diana should be despised
[1:07:43] and her magnificence should be destroyed
[1:07:46] whom all asia and the world worship come
[1:07:49] on
[1:07:51] and when they had heard these things
[1:07:53] they were full of wrath and cried out
[1:07:56] seeing greatest diana
[1:07:58] of ephesians
[1:08:01] so
[1:08:02] i no doubt they went all through the
[1:08:04] city great as diana they they like that
[1:08:07] they they picked up their street
[1:08:09] meetings
[1:08:12] they put up their billboards
[1:08:14] right they got a television ministry all
[1:08:17] right
[1:08:18] they had to let everybody know that this
[1:08:20] is it yes
[1:08:23] this is the way
[1:08:25] wow but you had the voice of truth in
[1:08:28] that hour
[1:08:31] saying that this is not the way
[1:08:35] see
[1:08:36] now as we read on
[1:08:39] it says here and they heard these
[1:08:40] sayings
[1:08:44] they were full of wrath and cried out
[1:08:46] saying great to die in ephesians and the
[1:08:49] whole city was filled with
[1:08:52] confusion
[1:08:55] and have caught gaius
[1:08:58] and aristicus
[1:09:00] men of macedonia
[1:09:02] paul's companions in travel
[1:09:04] they rushed with one accord
[1:09:07] into the theater
[1:09:10] these men was in there preaching and
[1:09:12] they go we gonna put a stop to this we
[1:09:14] just we're gonna challenge them right
[1:09:18] and when paul would have entered into
[1:09:21] in unto the people the disciples
[1:09:23] suffered him not saying don't go in
[1:09:25] there paul don't people don't people hot
[1:09:27] with you man don't go in there right
[1:09:30] and a certain of the chief of asia which
[1:09:33] was his friend sent unto him designed
[1:09:36] him that he would not adventure himself
[1:09:39] into the theater
[1:09:43] some therefore cried one thing
[1:09:46] [Music]
[1:09:47] somebody else crying another thing
[1:09:50] for the whole assembly was confused
[1:09:55] and the more part knew not wherefore
[1:09:59] why they even come together
[1:10:03] if that don't paint a picture
[1:10:06] don't even remember why they come to
[1:10:08] church
[1:10:13] and we see that this was all intentional
[1:10:16] and craft
[1:10:17] all behind money right
[1:10:19] that's right
[1:10:20] we're living in the same day yeah yeah
[1:10:24] keep the people confused politics
[1:10:26] politicians
[1:10:28] preachers and everything if we can keep
[1:10:31] the people confused we can keep control
[1:10:37] we don't want the people to know truth
[1:10:42] what is truth
[1:10:45] what is truth this morning my brothers
[1:10:47] and sisters
[1:10:49] so when we when we we truth truth let me
[1:10:51] let me let me say this truth
[1:10:54] there's many different definitions of
[1:10:55] truth
[1:10:58] fact
[1:10:59] and uh the the the
[1:11:02] the thought of being accurate
[1:11:04] you know many different things like that
[1:11:06] but when i look at truth i look at truth
[1:11:08] i look at truth
[1:11:09] we know that the devil mimics god in
[1:11:12] everything that he does
[1:11:14] there's a certain group of uh club
[1:11:18] very popular club
[1:11:20] they they have as their emblem
[1:11:23] a protractor
[1:11:26] and a square
[1:11:30] that's all i gotta say
[1:11:32] and they and and they claim a claim they
[1:11:35] claim to be a religious
[1:11:38] organization
[1:11:40] don't believe that but
[1:11:42] because i know a lot of them
[1:11:44] don't religious about it
[1:11:47] but
[1:11:48] we see the original craftsman was god
[1:11:53] amen the original craftsman has always
[1:11:57] been so when we look at truth when we
[1:11:59] look at truth take this word truth
[1:12:01] when we have
[1:12:03] a
[1:12:04] level
[1:12:07] and a square
[1:12:09] a square is perfect 90 degrees
[1:12:14] anything outside of that
[1:12:16] is not true
[1:12:21] so when we build
[1:12:23] we want to build
[1:12:25] a a a a a a build on truth yes
[1:12:29] right if we start with the
[1:12:32] instrumentation that we use
[1:12:34] it's out off one way or the other
[1:12:38] and then we starting out wrong amen
[1:12:42] so we're building he built
[1:12:45] an ark he gave
[1:12:47] noah everything he needed and
[1:12:49] showed him how to build it
[1:12:51] to build it right to withstand
[1:12:55] the judgment of that day
[1:12:58] i'm feeling my help coming glory
[1:13:01] to withstand the judgment of that hour
[1:13:04] amen solomon built the temple yes
[1:13:07] amen
[1:13:08] he he built the temple amen his heart
[1:13:11] was in it just building so perfectly
[1:13:15] but he had the original blueprint he
[1:13:18] looked at the ark
[1:13:20] there's three compartments to that arc
[1:13:23] amen and he said okay now we got the
[1:13:25] original blueprint
[1:13:27] amen and
[1:13:28] we're gonna build it off the original
[1:13:29] blueprint
[1:13:32] amen following the original all right
[1:13:34] amen the architect
[1:13:36] amen following the same designer
[1:13:39] amen by inspiration
[1:13:41] amen he built the temple
[1:13:44] let's go on
[1:13:45] in the message no no no no let not i
[1:13:48] don't want to go get ahead of myself
[1:13:50] truth why is truth important
[1:13:53] because truth is what we base our
[1:13:56] decisions on
[1:13:58] we make decisions
[1:14:00] in life
[1:14:02] based on the information that we're
[1:14:03] given
[1:14:06] so if we're given bad information
[1:14:10] we're bound to make bad decisions
[1:14:17] we're bound to make the wrong decision
[1:14:20] glory amen
[1:14:23] the prophet is statue of a perfect man
[1:14:26] he said
[1:14:28] now
[1:14:31] in in a statue of a perfect man
[1:14:33] now here is the plan of salvation
[1:14:37] he says and then a vision broke forth i
[1:14:39] want to go down a little more to 31
[1:14:42] first you
[1:14:44] must be
[1:14:45] born again
[1:14:48] you must be born again and then when
[1:14:50] you're born again
[1:14:52] you have faith
[1:14:54] you believe the word
[1:14:57] until you're born again
[1:15:01] you'll argue against it
[1:15:04] if you if you're just religiously
[1:15:07] inclined
[1:15:09] and you got a little human knowledge
[1:15:12] that you should do right
[1:15:15] you'll never be able
[1:15:17] to agree upon the word of god
[1:15:20] you'll never do it
[1:15:22] you've got to be born again
[1:15:25] born again it produces faith
[1:15:29] amen
[1:15:31] now i'm going to move down to the 30 to
[1:15:33] 133 paragraph 133 now
[1:15:37] you're going to build a house
[1:15:41] and you pour a foundation
[1:15:44] say boy i got it see
[1:15:46] you got the foundation to build your
[1:15:49] house on
[1:15:50] now you've got to build the house
[1:15:54] now there's where the thing comes in
[1:15:57] this morning we're going to talk about
[1:16:01] a house
[1:16:02] this foundation is first
[1:16:05] what is the foundation christianity
[1:16:08] faith in
[1:16:10] the word of god
[1:16:12] that's your foundation
[1:16:14] then you begin to grow
[1:16:17] then you start
[1:16:21] you're being to add to the foundation
[1:16:25] now you're building a house
[1:16:27] you put your uprights
[1:16:30] and everything else
[1:16:32] see brother miley said we the generation
[1:16:34] of the uprights
[1:16:38] we're the generation of the uprights
[1:16:40] yeah yeah and see our uprights are true
[1:16:44] yeah our foundation is solid
[1:16:47] and our uprights are true yeah amen
[1:16:50] right right because it's built
[1:16:53] on the truth of the gospel
[1:16:56] our building ain't leaning yeah see a
[1:16:58] weak building a lean building is con
[1:17:01] lord have mercy it's going to suffer to
[1:17:03] collapse
[1:17:06] now
[1:17:08] we see our uprights and everything else
[1:17:11] he talked about brother woods who's a
[1:17:12] carpenter and contractor here

[1:17:31] he wants to make you hims
[1:17:33] you like himself he wants to be
[1:17:36] reflected rather reflecting his being
[1:17:42] so we're building a house
[1:17:44] we're building a structure this morning
[1:17:47] now i want to go down i want you to
[1:17:48] listen here what the prophet said he
[1:17:50] said then after we lay our foundation
[1:17:53] secondly you add your foundation add to
[1:17:57] your faith
[1:17:58] peter
[1:18:00] said
[1:18:01] add to your faith first
[1:18:03] first your faith
[1:18:05] then you add virtue to your faith
[1:18:08] and and and this is the next column
[1:18:12] listen at the words that the prophet are
[1:18:14] using
[1:18:15] virtue is your next
[1:18:17] column
[1:18:19] first you pour your foundation
[1:18:22] then to your faith act virtue
[1:18:25] if i read on down there if you read on
[1:18:27] down there to the 146 virtue must be in
[1:18:30] us and until we get virtue then
[1:18:33] we get
[1:18:34] virtue
[1:18:35] we can add to our faith
[1:18:38] the foundation
[1:18:40] wall
[1:18:43] it the foundation wall see it take
[1:18:46] anybody can can lay blocks
[1:18:49] but it takes a craftsman
[1:18:52] to turn the cone
[1:18:54] see we look back here paul was
[1:18:57] turning the cone yeah
[1:18:59] yeah he was turning the corner
[1:19:01] and and and the same way we we we have
[1:19:03] to and it takes a it takes a profit yeah
[1:19:07] right
[1:19:08] to turn the corner
[1:19:12] oh we just got a wall we don't have a
[1:19:14] house
[1:19:15] we're building
[1:19:17] a house
[1:19:18] amen so we we look here in the message
[1:19:21] uh
[1:19:22] uh uh uh uh uh fellowship by redemption
[1:19:25] but boy what i want you to i want to
[1:19:27] bring to your attention uh in acts the
[1:19:29] seventh chapter solomon said uh uh we
[1:19:33] build him a house how be it the most
[1:19:34] high dweller is not in temples made with
[1:19:37] hands
[1:19:38] i said the prophet heaven is my
[1:19:40] footstool earth is uh heaven is my
[1:19:43] throne earth is my footstool and what
[1:19:45] house
[1:19:46] will you build me
[1:19:48] man i asked that question what house
[1:19:52] will you build
[1:19:54] will you build see
[1:19:55] amen and and and and i venture even
[1:19:58] further i mentioned i venture a little
[1:20:00] further
[1:20:02] in building this house
[1:20:05] just like noah noah no no no no one
[1:20:08] didn't have the knowledge
[1:20:11] but by inspiration the knowledge to
[1:20:13] build that ark god provided god gave it
[1:20:18] all of the material that noah needed was
[1:20:21] provided
[1:20:22] when solomon built the temple oh fine
[1:20:25] material god provided everything he need
[1:20:30] amen and today
[1:20:33] for you to build a house
[1:20:36] the spiritual house
[1:20:38] god has provided everything you need
[1:20:42] the problem is
[1:20:46] let me say it this way
[1:20:48] a lot of people don't want to hear true
[1:20:54] i don't mind if i take this
[1:20:58] coat a lot of people don't don't today
[1:21:01] don't they don't walk true yeah why
[1:21:03] because when you hear truth
[1:21:06] you're responsible for it
[1:21:10] people would rather say well i just
[1:21:11] didn't know yeah you know
[1:21:14] you know
[1:21:16] but they tried to use that excuse well i
[1:21:19] don't know because see i want to hold on
[1:21:21] to what i got
[1:21:23] i want to hold on you see
[1:21:25] lord help me jesus see a lot of times we

[1:37:34] because see not only are you fooling
[1:37:36] with the bride of jesus christ i'm on
[1:37:37] scripture
[1:37:39] [Music]
[1:37:41] you're going against truth
[1:37:46] i just have to be patience
[1:37:48] we're building a house
[1:37:50] add to your faith add to your foundation
[1:37:53] faith virtue
[1:37:54] knowledge
[1:37:55] temperance
[1:37:57] patience
[1:37:58] just being tested my walls are sure
[1:38:01] my walls are strong
[1:38:03] it ain't it and let me let me let me go
[1:38:06] on here let me let me show you this here
[1:38:07] let me show you this here let me show
[1:38:08] you this here my god he says here in the
[1:38:11] message fellowship by redemption
[1:38:13] he says
[1:38:14] here and then build these other things
[1:38:17] bring all these other things unto that
[1:38:19] foundation but you try to bring these
[1:38:21] fundamental truths upon a foundation
[1:38:23] that has nothing to do with it
[1:38:26] like
[1:38:27] putting brother woods here uh somewhere
[1:38:29] in the building he's a contractor well a
[1:38:32] good
[1:38:33] what good would it do
[1:38:36] to take
[1:38:37] for him to take an old building
[1:38:40] that's worm eaten and passed termites
[1:38:44] then
[1:38:45] uh uh has termites
[1:38:48] to eat them eat the building
[1:38:52] and man eat the building down and it's
[1:38:54] rotten to the foundation
[1:38:56] and go out and get the best lumber
[1:38:59] that he could find
[1:39:01] good dry seasoned redwood
[1:39:04] tack it on the house go out here and get
[1:39:07] paint that's recommended by the highest
[1:39:10] painting in the country the company uh
[1:39:13] paint company in the world he says look
[1:39:15] here preacher i can show you that this
[1:39:18] is real genuine redwood
[1:39:22] i say yes brother wood that's right look
[1:39:24] here here's the seal of approval that
[1:39:27] this is the best paint that could be put
[1:39:30] on the house
[1:39:31] that's right brother wood put your but
[1:39:34] but
[1:39:35] your foundation is wrong
[1:39:39] it's got to come down
[1:39:42] see the problem with the problem with a
[1:39:44] problem with we don't we we've got all
[1:39:47] these imaginary ideas
[1:39:49] we've been taught
[1:39:51] all of these different things
[1:39:54] and when we when when truth confronts us
[1:39:57] we don't want to we we got
[1:39:59] gotta tear it down
[1:40:01] we you gotta go back you gotta start
[1:40:03] over
[1:40:05] don't bring your
[1:40:06] yo yo yo denominational id you can't it
[1:40:09] won't mix
[1:40:13] you see we're talking about what is
[1:40:15] truth
[1:40:17] amen
[1:40:19] i can show you he says here uh uh uh uh
[1:40:24] that's what's the matter reading
[1:40:25] scripture is right
[1:40:28] brother branham knocks on the pulpit
[1:40:29] full time preaching the gospel is right
[1:40:32] but your foundation is wrong
[1:40:35] tear out
[1:40:36] your mental conception of things
[1:40:39] and get god
[1:40:42] in your heart
[1:40:43] by the shedding of blood and then build
[1:40:47] from there
[1:40:49] see it goes back to the same question
[1:40:51] when the people got confused they forgot
[1:40:53] why they were coming to church
[1:40:55] that's right
[1:40:56] and i believe that they people so
[1:40:57] confused they forget why
[1:40:59] they come to church
[1:41:02] lord i want my foundation right
[1:41:06] i want my foundation right
[1:41:09] give me jesus or give me nothing
[1:41:14] see cause sometimes we get we get we
[1:41:16] wait
[1:41:17] we it gets so confusing
[1:41:19] they think people think the church is
[1:41:21] just a they come to church with some
[1:41:23] some say i've had people suddenly say
[1:41:25] well i look for a church with good
[1:41:26] programs
[1:41:29] they got a good ministry they got a good
[1:41:31] uh feed ministry and they got a good
[1:41:34] nursery
[1:41:37] but what about the preaching of the
[1:41:38] gospel
[1:41:39] you ain't saying nothing about the

[1:47:26] i'm on solid ground amen i got a sure
[1:47:28] foundation amen my uprights are sure
[1:47:32] because your whole nose is saying to
[1:47:34] them that walk up right before him

[1:47:41] word of god amen
[1:47:43] amen
[1:47:44] you call me man you come to church he
[1:47:46] said well i didn't quite never never
[1:47:47] quite heard it that way you were
[1:47:49] confused because of the demetrius and
[1:47:53] the boys want to keep you feeding their
[1:47:55] money
[1:47:56] so they introduce all of this garbage to
[1:48:00] confuse your mind but there's a prophet
[1:48:03] on the scene
[1:48:04] one like paul who is living you giving
[1:48:08] you the spirit of truth
[1:48:11] you're looking into the face of truth
[1:48:13] [Music]
[1:48:15] there was another fellow who looked into
[1:48:16] the face of truth that rich young ruler
[1:48:19] he said come follow me
[1:48:21] that rich young fool looked right into
[1:48:23] the face of truth and turned it away
[1:48:29] that's why we don't want
[1:48:30] truth because we have to give up too
[1:48:32] much
[1:48:34] just like the rich young ruler
[1:48:36] i don't want to give up what i'm doing
[1:48:38] so i turn my back on truth
[1:48:42] you're counting it's fall
[1:48:45] hallelujah
[1:48:47] pastor was talking about it and a
[1:48:50] bible study not too long that the
[1:48:51] worldlyism
[1:48:53] a lot of people don't want you they
[1:48:54] don't want to give up them things that's
[1:48:56] right
[1:48:57] they want to dress like they want a
[1:48:58] dress
[1:49:00] they want to act the way they want to
[1:49:02] act
[1:49:03] i don't need no man telling me how i
[1:49:05] need to dress how i need i need to carry
[1:49:08] myself
[1:49:09] but you're building leaning
[1:49:12] your building's gonna fall over
[1:49:14] your foundation is wrong
[1:49:19] built on fables and and and and and and
[1:49:22] fairy tales
[1:49:24] there's no solidness there's nothing to
[1:49:25] it
[1:49:27] you're going to bring back to god
[1:49:30] lord i followed the blueprint you didn't
[1:49:32] follow the group and you did what you
[1:49:33] wanted to do
[1:49:34] you did what you made you feel good
[1:49:39] lord i want to be in your will
[1:49:42] make me over
[1:49:44] tear it down to the studs
[1:49:47] bust up the concrete
[1:49:50] reform it lord god and point where it's
[1:49:53] street
[1:49:55] ain't no lumps in it
[1:49:57] it ain't leaning a little bit
[1:49:59] cause if you start out wrong you're
[1:50:00] going to end up wrong
[1:50:06] but you got to be willing
[1:50:08] to put away
[1:50:09] all your imaginary fables
[1:50:12] first of all
[1:50:14] it's got to be in your heart
[1:50:16] lord i want truth
[1:50:19] i want to know you lord
[1:50:21] this is a
[1:50:22] relationship what kind of relationship

[1:50:57] natural teeth
[1:50:59] you're gonna understand that you missed
[1:51:01] it
[1:51:02] because you were presented with truth
[1:51:04] and you turned it away
[1:51:08] that's right i hope somebody hear me
[1:51:11] just like in paul's day than pilot pilot
[1:51:14] pilot pilot co-pilot

[1:52:23] prudent
[1:52:24] and revealing himself to babies

[1:55:26] revelation 10 7 is going to do two
[1:55:28] things one according to malachi 4 he
[1:55:30] would turn the hearts of the children
[1:55:31] back to the fathers two he will reveal
[1:55:34] the mysteries of the seven thunders in
[1:55:37] revelation 10 which are the revelations
[1:55:40] contained in the seven seals it will be
[1:55:42] these divinely revealed mystery truth
[1:55:47] that will literally
[1:55:50] turn your hearts
[1:55:54] of the children to the pentecostal
[1:55:56] father exactly so amen it will be these
[1:56:00] divinely revealed mystery truths
[1:56:06] good god of mine
[1:56:09] we don't have the question of what is
[1:56:11] truth
[1:56:12] we know what truth is
[1:56:15] if you are questioning in your heart
[1:56:17] what is truth let jesus talk to you
[1:56:20] you have to be willing to put away
[1:56:24] all of your imaginary fairy tales about
[1:56:27] who god is
[1:56:29] you have to be willing to put away
[1:56:32] with the old lies that you've been
[1:56:34] taught
[1:56:35] you have to be willing to be to to do
[1:56:38] away with the confusion that they have
[1:56:40] placed on they have fed doubt
[1:56:44] the demetrius is in the boys
[1:56:49] and you're confused
[1:56:52] but truth is here
[1:56:55] just like truth was there with paul
[1:57:00] truth will set you free
[1:57:02] and the bible will become a new book
[1:57:06] i was sharing with a person
[1:57:09] the other day
[1:57:11] because the message was on my heart and
[1:57:12] i'm just going through it and
[1:57:14] i always talk to him and i kind of yeah
[1:57:17] back in revelation and i'm running it
[1:57:18] back revelation new testament oh he said
[1:57:21] how do you do that
[1:57:24] i said because the bible has become a
[1:57:26] new book
[1:57:28] it's an open book now
[1:57:32] until you receive
[1:57:35] the message of the hours these divinely
[1:57:38] revealed mystery truths will open
[1:57:42] amen
[1:57:43] the book to you amen
[1:57:46] you'll see it all together different
[1:57:50] it'll begin to connect
[1:57:53] amen
[1:57:54] when when when in construction and i'm
[1:57:56] getting ready to close
[1:57:58] the musicians
[1:57:59] please come
[1:58:01] when we're
[1:58:04] my father
[1:58:05] he would teach me a little bit about
[1:58:07] construction he was back there building
[1:58:09] the shed
[1:58:10] just love to go he would never let me
[1:58:12] say daddy can i lose a song no boy
[1:58:15] don't you touch that song
[1:58:17] he said you're too anxious
[1:58:21] you want it too bad oh lord i'm doing
[1:58:24] the cutting
[1:58:26] but he would always give me one job he
[1:58:28] would
[1:58:29] got a chalk line
[1:58:31] and he
[1:58:33] he would make a mark
[1:58:35] he would make a mark on the board over
[1:58:37] here
[1:58:39] and he'll measure
[1:58:41] and he'll make a mark on the board over
[1:58:42] here
[1:58:43] and he'd say now hold it on that mark
[1:58:47] and i'ma hold it on this mark
[1:58:50] and he pulled that chalk line
[1:58:53] so we know that it's straight
[1:58:56] see we got to go back to genesis
[1:58:59] and find the truth in genesis
[1:59:02] and make a mark
[1:59:04] we got to come back to revelations
[1:59:06] and find the truth
[1:59:09] in revelation
[1:59:10] and we make a mark
[1:59:12] and then everything in the middle you
[1:59:14] know is right
[1:59:17] it's got to dovetail
[1:59:20] from genesis
[1:59:21] to revelation
[1:59:23] then you know your line is true
[1:59:26] if in any way it don't dovetail i go
[1:59:30] back
[1:59:31] and re-measure
[1:59:35] i go back and remember
[1:59:39] what
[1:59:41] a friend we have enjoy
[1:59:46] [Music]
[1:59:48] jesus

[2:00:19] rethink
[2:00:21] god in prayer

[2:01:52] not care
[2:01:57] thank you lord
[2:02:00] it's the only way we're going to know
[2:02:02] truth in this hour
[2:02:05] if there's a question in your heart
[2:02:07] question in your mind
[2:02:08] take it to god and pray

[2:06:32] [Applause]
[2:06:34] [Music]
[2:06:48] i appreciate the word of the lord today
[2:06:50] from
[2:06:50] brother troy
[2:06:52] amen
[2:06:53] [Applause]
[2:06:55] [Music]
[2:06:57] what is truth
[2:06:59] you know he was um reading a particular
[2:07:02] quote there where
[2:07:03] brother branham was saying that we first
[2:07:05] have to
[2:07:07] go back and have things right in our
[2:07:09] heart that that's where it starts and uh
[2:07:12] just kind of took me to a
[2:07:14] story that i once heard there was a
[2:07:16] a
[2:07:18] gentleman he was a
[2:07:20] carpenter
[2:07:22] and worked for a particular man for a
[2:07:24] number of years
[2:07:26] and
[2:07:28] he was ready to retire
[2:07:30] and his his boss said well before you
[2:07:32] retire if you don't mind just i'd like
[2:07:34] to
[2:07:35] actually build me one more house
[2:07:37] just build one more house for me and
[2:07:39] then after that you can retire
[2:07:41] so he says okay i'll do it and he did it
[2:07:44] very begrudgingly he's like i told you i
[2:07:46] want to retire i don't know why you got
[2:07:47] me doing this so as he start building
[2:07:49] the house he's taking shortcuts
[2:07:52] and doing this and doing that and just
[2:07:53] just really you know didn't do
[2:07:56] the best job that he possibly could
[2:07:59] and uh at the end of the process
[2:08:01] the
[2:08:02] boss came up to him and said i want to
[2:08:04] thank you for building this house and
[2:08:06] the reason i asked you to build this
[2:08:08] house for me is because
[2:08:10] all the years that you work for me i
[2:08:12] want to just let you know how much i
[2:08:13] appreciate you
[2:08:15] and this house that you just built now
[2:08:17] it's your house
[2:08:19] you got it for free you don't have to
[2:08:20] pay anything for it and when he realized
[2:08:23] that he had not put his heart
[2:08:25] [Music]
[2:08:26] into it he hurt himself
[2:08:29] right so it's so important that whatever
[2:08:31] you do for the lord put your heart into
[2:08:33] it
[2:08:33] put your heart into it
[2:08:35] amen it pays off
[2:08:37] in the end
[2:08:38] amen how we appreciate amen
[2:08:41] uh the word of the lord on today let's
[2:08:44] sing just a couple courses this song it
[2:08:46] seems like the holy spirit just
[2:08:49] had a purpose for us
[2:08:51] amen i noticed yesterday i was thinking
[2:08:53] on this song and
[2:08:55] and uh then didn't know brother troy had
[2:08:57] it in his notes and sister rachel come
[2:08:59] out and started the service out with her
[2:09:00] like there's something to this song and
[2:09:03] and as we get rid of singing i want to
[2:09:04] just remind you
[2:09:06] amen um this song was written from a
[2:09:09] very very
[2:09:10] deep place
[2:09:13] very deep place
[2:09:14] the man that wrote this song he
[2:09:17] he had
[2:09:18] gotten engaged he gave his heart to a
[2:09:20] young lady got engaged and i think a few
[2:09:23] uh months before the wedding there was
[2:09:25] an accident the girl
[2:09:27] either she fell off a horse and hit her
[2:09:29] head on the rock and she ended up dying
[2:09:32] and he was very very distraught
[2:09:34] he said you know i don't know if i'll be
[2:09:35] able to ever love again but somehow
[2:09:38] somewhere down the line he fell in love
[2:09:40] again with another young lady and he got
[2:09:42] engaged and getting ready to get married
[2:09:44] and somehow she took sick and she died
[2:09:48] twice he's been engaged in twice he's
[2:09:50] gone through death
[2:09:52] and he just began to just ponder a man
[2:09:54] his trial and his
[2:09:56] distresses and
[2:09:57] while he was pondering
[2:09:59] these words came to his mind
[2:10:02] begin to write this what a friend we
[2:10:04] have in jesus
[2:10:06] all our sins and griefs to bear what a
[2:10:08] privilege
[2:10:09] it is to carry
[2:10:10] [Music]
[2:10:11] everything to god
[2:10:13] in prayer
[2:10:14] let's turn to our feet
[2:10:17] let's sing amen this from
[2:10:21] our hearts
[2:10:22] amen on this day what a friend we have
[2:10:25] in jesus
[2:10:29] what
[2:10:31] a friend we have
[2:10:34] in jesus
[2:10:40] oh
[2:10:43] our sins and grace
[2:10:46] [Music]
[2:11:07] breathing
[2:11:09] to god
[2:11:11] in prayer
[2:11:15] and it says it says oh
[2:11:20] what peace we are

[2:11:34] pains weeping

[2:14:15] instrument for the service and when he
[2:14:16] started playing it inspired many of our
[2:14:19] young sisters and i believe the first
[2:14:20] one to kind of take out was such a
[2:14:23] candace amen and and then sister rachel
[2:14:26] was practicing practice she told me and

[2:14:41] 12 years old
[2:14:43] 30
[2:14:45] 30.

[2:14:51] got something in my heart that i want to
[2:14:52] do for them and amen i'm going to do
[2:14:54] that before they leave amen but i i am
[2:14:57] so appreciative amen of what the lord
[2:14:59] has done and what the lord has given us
