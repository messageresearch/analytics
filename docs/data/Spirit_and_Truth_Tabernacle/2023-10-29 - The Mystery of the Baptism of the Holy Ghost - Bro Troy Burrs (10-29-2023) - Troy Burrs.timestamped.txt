[47:20] it's not by might nor by power but by
[47:23] your spirit Lord God Lord God have your
[47:26] way in Jesus precious name the church
[47:29] say amen amen you may be
[47:33] seated
[47:35] amen amen that scripture that I I read
[47:39] was taken amen out of the book of
[47:43] Jeremiah amen and which I got the
[47:47] inspiration amen and the prophet amen
[47:50] spoke a message on this uh title there
[47:53] of broken sisters yes and I believe he
[47:56] was trying to get us to see something in
[47:59] that title in that message of broken
[48:02] sisters because we'll see there amen as
[48:05] we go on through this message how
[48:08] Jeremiah and the prophet of this day
[48:11] amen paralleled one another okay the
[48:15] things that Jeremiah was going through
[48:17] and the things amen that he was talking
[48:20] about had a very similar parallel to
[48:23] this day and time so I just want to read
[48:26] amen a passage amen from broken systems
[48:30] amen I think it was twice that he
[48:32] preached this one was in 1964 July 26
[48:36] evening amen uh at the
[48:40] 31st chapter is where I'll start reading
[48:43] from amen and he
[48:46] says the reason I thought of this text
[48:49] was because that it runs parallel to
[48:53] what I was saying this morning of the
[48:56] hour that we're
[48:58] living and the cause that we are
[49:02] struggling
[49:03] for and we look at Israel as an
[49:06] example that God was uh he always has to
[49:12] remain the same and there is only one
[49:15] thing that God ever did amen ever did
[49:20] honor that was his way that he provided
[49:25] for his people
[49:28] amen and when they go out of that way
[49:32] then God was
[49:35] Dishonored and God made the people
[49:38] suffer for getting away from what he had
[49:42] told them to do no matter what it
[49:47] was he even give them a
[49:49] law touch not handle not taste not
[49:57] just not because of uh evil
[50:01] doing evil of doing it but the evil of
[50:05] disobeying what he said to do right
[50:09] right and there's all there's always
[50:13] cannot be a law without
[50:16] punishment for the law because if there
[50:21] was no punishment then
[50:23] law not much to the uh to it unless it's
[50:29] it's a penalty to that
[50:31] law now we find that that we find what
[50:35] they
[50:36] did in that day seems to parallel what
[50:40] we are doing
[50:41] today what the church people are
[50:46] doing so we see a strange thing here it
[50:51] might be strange to some people when he
[50:54] said uh you have they have humed
[51:00] themselves
[51:02] systems broken
[51:04] sistern now maybe some of you don't know
[51:07] what a sister is how many knows what a
[51:10] sister is well most all of you if you
[51:15] was Ever Raised on a
[51:17] farm you know what a sistern is I
[51:21] remember I've drank enough bugs from one
[51:25] to know what a sister
[51:27] is he say preached out in the country
[51:31] where in the brush Arbor there you have
[51:35] a big picture full of sistern
[51:39] water sitting there the rain you know
[51:43] and it kind of got a little low uh and
[51:48] the and then the bug at night would get
[51:53] into it
[51:55] and
[51:56] so I know what a sister what sistern
[52:00] water
[52:01] is a sister is a place a thing that's
[52:06] dug out of the ground to take the place
[52:10] of a
[52:11] whale where people don't doesn't have to
[52:15] uh have a whale they get a sister in
[52:19] other words a sister is a manmade tank
[52:24] or a man made well in the
[52:28] ground that made that men dig out to
[52:32] catch
[52:33] water to use it some of them use it for
[52:37] wash water some of them use it for
[52:40] drinking water and different and
[52:43] different way maybe all water sometime
[52:46] we use to get from a
[52:50] sister used to have an old thing you had
[52:54] uh to when around and around and around
[52:58] to get the water up excuse
[53:02] me had little buckets uh to pump the
[53:06] water out of the system well notice
[53:08] about the system that's different from a
[53:10] whale now a whale now I'm sorry now a
[53:14] system gets
[53:17] empty and the sister Cann feel
[53:21] itself amen it's not reliable
[53:25] you can't rely upon a sister it has to
[53:30] rely upon it has to rely and depend upon
[53:33] the rain that fall in the summer or in
[53:36] the winter whatever it is usually in the
[53:39] winter time when the snow and rain comes
[53:43] and it runs uh the water off into the
[53:47] sstn and if it doesn't get the water
[53:51] then it don't have any
[53:53] water if it all dries up and it can't
[54:00] refill
[54:01] itself the old system cannot reveal
[54:06] itself the rains that fall amen and uh
[54:12] we're going to go on I don't want to
[54:14] just continue reading but there's a lot
[54:16] to that maybe I'll come back to it I
[54:20] want to
[54:22] uh speak on a message this morning I
[54:26] want you to look at John the 16th
[54:31] chapter and the
[54:34] 12th and the 13th
[54:39] verse this John the 16th
[54:42] chapter 12th and the 13th
[54:46] verse beginning at the 12th verse it
[54:50] reads I have
[54:53] yet many things to say to
[54:56] you but ye cannot bear them
[55:01] now how be it when the spirit of Truth
[55:05] is
[55:07] come he will lead
[55:10] you uh he will guide you into all truth
[55:16] amen for he shall not speak of himself
[55:19] but
[55:21] whatsoever he shall whatsoever he shall
[55:24] hear
[55:26] that shall he speak and he will show you
[55:29] things to come now when that passage of
[55:32] scripture there we see here that he says
[55:35] I yet have many things to say to you but
[55:37] you can't bear enough see God
[55:39] knows exactly the season of your life to
[55:44] reveal his truth to you right right sir
[55:48] he knows exactly the season of your life
[55:52] right to reveal his truth to you amen he
[55:56] knows exactly the season of your life
[56:00] amen that he may reveal the truth to
[56:03] someone
[56:04] else
[56:06] amen God is always in control he amen
[56:11] and it says here how be it when the
[56:15] spirit of Truth is
[56:17] come amen this is speaking of a future
[56:21] coming how be it when and this is John
[56:26] here speaking when the spirit of Truth
[56:29] come he
[56:30] will lead you and guide you in the all
[56:33] truth a future coming of
[56:37] Truth they had a portion of Truth for
[56:41] their
[56:42] day amen but there was a greater truth
[56:48] coming and the spirit of Truth he will
[56:52] lead he will guide you yeah right into
[56:57] truth I went over into the to the
[57:02] message that the prophet preached on the
[57:06] guide amen and the prophet was talking
[57:10] about here how
[57:13] amen when you go out amen into the
[57:16] forest he's a Avid
[57:18] Hunter and he said especially in some of
[57:22] those Canadian Forest where there very
[57:24] thick
[57:26] brush you don't have a chance out there
[57:30] without a
[57:32] guide I think he said that there's about
[57:34] a 3% chance of
[57:38] survival because what'll happen is
[57:40] you'll get out
[57:42] there and you'll you you go through the
[57:44] trees and you go different
[57:46] ways and all of a sudden the snow will
[57:50] come and you have no idea you look
[57:54] around everything looks the
[57:56] same which way did I come from and which
[58:00] way do I
[58:02] go he was talking about a story of a
[58:05] camp a a a group of
[58:07] campers uh a boy scouts that went out
[58:11] without a
[58:13] God and they got
[58:16] lost they had the national God the
[58:20] forest
[58:22] rangers volunteers
[58:26] helicopters and they never could find
[58:28] those boys and all of them
[58:32] perished because they didn't have a
[58:39] guide to lead
[58:41] them to show them God's provided way
[58:46] amen and we see the parallels to this
[58:49] day and
[58:50] time amen I want to say my brothers and
[58:53] sisters this morning
[58:56] that you need the
[59:00] God I'm not the
[59:04] God we see here talking about the
[59:06] Prophet
[59:08] Jeremiah the prophet Jeremiah Was was
[59:11] was was a prophet sent there to
[59:14] Israel amen that that mimic Moses and
[59:17] his and and and out the prophet of this
[59:20] day he he he he didn't think he was good
[59:23] enough amen
[59:25] he said uh to to do what the Lord asked
[59:27] him to
[59:29] do he said I'll give you what to say it
[59:33] touched his
[59:34] mouth I don't want to read it all but
[59:37] it's right there in Jeremiah
[59:39] 2 Jeremiah 1 and two so he was the the
[59:44] Israel had lost their
[59:46] way amen they they had started H uh uh
[59:52] going and beginning to do things
[59:56] God bless you my brother amen I'm sorry
[59:59] I shouldn't have done that Lord have
[1:00:02] mercy God bless you amen but they was
[1:00:07] going
[1:00:11] and they had gotten off the
[1:00:16] path they had gotten off the path God
[1:00:20] they had begin to take on some of the
[1:00:23] the habits and they had begin to take on
[1:00:25] some of the ways amen of of the people
[1:00:29] around them but God had gave them a
[1:00:33] specific
[1:00:34] way God's provided way it says in there
[1:00:39] that they begin to worship Idol
[1:00:42] gods they had begin to take on the
[1:00:45] Customs amen and of the people around
[1:00:50] them they had begin to develop the cult
[1:00:56] culture of the people around them right
[1:01:00] they had begin to develop and take on
[1:01:03] some of the religious
[1:01:06] spirits of the masses that was around
[1:01:10] them
[1:01:12] amen so we move on here we
[1:01:16] see we need a
[1:01:20] God
[1:01:22] Jeremiah was not the guy
[1:01:26] he was kind a prophet that God had sent
[1:01:31] in that day amen to show them the
[1:01:35] way but they still needed a guide to
[1:01:39] lead them to the word of the
[1:01:42] hour he said here just how be it when
[1:01:45] the spirit of Truth is come he will lead
[1:01:50] you and guide you into all truth he will
[1:01:54] lead you to the message of the
[1:01:58] hour because you can't other than that
[1:02:01] you will go
[1:02:03] lost because all the paths look the
[1:02:08] same it's a tree here a tree there a
[1:02:13] tree there and without a guide you don't
[1:02:16] know which way to go this one looks
[1:02:20] right this way looks right and you begin
[1:02:24] to just look at these things and you
[1:02:27] make an
[1:02:29] assumption I guess I'll just go this way
[1:02:32] why because my Grandmama and my great
[1:02:35] Grandmama yeah and my uncle they all did
[1:02:39] this so I guess I'll go this way too
[1:02:42] right
[1:02:43] amen not
[1:02:46] understanding that the
[1:02:49] gospel as it Journeys it has Junctions
[1:02:55] where the gospel has a junction where
[1:02:57] you have to make a
[1:03:01] turn and it's important that you make
[1:03:03] the right turn at the
[1:03:06] junction amen amen yes or you will get
[1:03:11] further and further off the beaten
[1:03:15] path and when you get off the
[1:03:18] path now you have to make your way back
[1:03:21] to the
[1:03:23] junction and start over and go the right
[1:03:29] way are you with me
[1:03:36] amen a future
[1:03:42] coming in your
[1:03:44] life is that we will that he will guide
[1:03:47] you in the true understanding of the
[1:03:50] revealed word of your
[1:03:51] day this has been the test testimony of
[1:03:55] every elect believer down through seven
[1:03:58] Church
[1:04:00] ages they all saw their day in its
[1:04:08] message for he shall not speak of
[1:04:11] himself but
[1:04:13] whatsoever he shall hear he shall speak
[1:04:17] and he will show
[1:04:19] you things to
[1:04:23] come that
[1:04:25] mean he needed to have the
[1:04:29] vision of prophetic
[1:04:33] Insight you needed to have a prophetic
[1:04:38] Ministry and we know that we are living
[1:04:40] in that age
[1:04:42] now to show you things to
[1:04:46] come a prophet is a
[1:04:50] Seer amen he can look afar amen and show
[1:04:55] you what's
[1:04:57] coming he can look back and tell you
[1:05:01] what's
[1:05:02] been so if you know what's
[1:05:06] coming and you know what's
[1:05:09] been now you can figure out pretty good
[1:05:12] where you
[1:05:16] at amen you'll know whether you in the
[1:05:21] middle at the beginning
[1:05:25] oh my or at the
[1:05:28] end and we've had a prophet in this
[1:05:31] hour that has showed us things to
[1:05:35] come showed us where we come
[1:05:38] from and by all of those
[1:05:41] things we can gather that we're right at
[1:05:45] the end
[1:05:49] time many people are
[1:05:52] wondering uh many can
[1:05:56] see that something's
[1:05:59] happening they can
[1:06:02] sense a
[1:06:04] change they can see that the world is
[1:06:08] becoming more
[1:06:11] evil that those things you can plainly
[1:06:15] see
[1:06:16] that but without prophetic
[1:06:19] Insight you have no way to understand
[1:06:23] how to
[1:06:25] navigate Amen in this hour Lord You're
[1:06:29] Still depending on cultural
[1:06:33] insight you're still depending on the
[1:06:37] word of an age going
[1:06:41] by but it won't suffice in this
[1:06:45] time it won't be enough to carry you
[1:06:51] through I want you to look at something
[1:06:54] with
[1:06:56] me
[1:06:58] Revelation the fourth
[1:07:01] chapter he said the fourth chapter the
[1:07:04] first verse after
[1:07:07] this I looked after
[1:07:11] what D your brother after after re
[1:07:15] Revelation three the church ages he said
[1:07:20] I
[1:07:21] looked and what did he see he said and
[1:07:24] behold a door was open in the
[1:07:29] heavens an Open Door my brothers and
[1:07:31] sisters gives you access to enter into
[1:07:36] somewhere
[1:07:38] different you had to open a
[1:07:41] door Amen to enter
[1:07:43] into the sanctuary this
[1:07:47] morning and door gives you access into
[1:07:51] somewhere different and John said now
[1:07:54] behold and I
[1:07:56] looked and I seen a behold the door was
[1:08:00] open in
[1:08:03] heaven amen and the first and he had
[1:08:06] here a open door access somewhere
[1:08:09] different and the first voice which I
[1:08:12] heard was as of a trumpet talking with
[1:08:16] me saying come up
[1:08:19] hither and I will show you things to
[1:08:22] come now isn't that what he said that he
[1:08:24] will do amen but John I'll show you
[1:08:28] things to come showing you that down up
[1:08:31] under after the church
[1:08:34] ages lady
[1:08:37] Yia I don't want to get ahead of
[1:08:39] myself we had seven Church ages but let
[1:08:43] me say my brothers and sisters we are
[1:08:46] not in Lady of seal right we have been
[1:08:51] lifted up into what's called a bride age
[1:08:54] amen amen we are called out of Lady o
[1:08:58] said come out of her my people amen
[1:09:02] because see we are need a prophetic
[1:09:05] Insight lady Y is blind naked
[1:09:10] wretched miserable and don't know it
[1:09:14] what is it they are they they they they
[1:09:16] they don't have to guide yes sir they
[1:09:19] lost in the wilderness and don't know
[1:09:21] which way to go but the prophet of this
[1:09:24] hour say Amen Revelation 4:1 say come up
[1:09:29] hither and I'll show you things to
[1:09:33] come so you'll know which way to
[1:09:36] go that's where we're at this morning my
[1:09:38] brothers and sisters
[1:09:44] amen bear with
[1:09:51] me this Open Door
[1:09:55] was the opening of the word that
[1:09:57] came by the voice of the seventh angel
[1:10:01] and this door was open that stood
[1:10:05] between lady OA and the bride
[1:10:09] age and so when this door was opened by
[1:10:14] the revealing of the word in this day it
[1:10:17] gave us an
[1:10:19] entrance from Lady oia Church age into
[1:10:23] to a bride
[1:10:28] dispensation Revelation 10:7 says but in
[1:10:32] the days of the
[1:10:33] voice of the seventh
[1:10:36] angel when he shall begin to
[1:10:39] sound the mysteries of God should be
[1:10:43] finished as he has declared to his
[1:10:45] servants the
[1:10:52] prophet
[1:10:58] amen
[1:11:00] so
[1:11:02] now we want to look
[1:11:05] at
[1:11:08] because there are Mysteries amen that
[1:11:12] had to be amen
[1:11:15] revealed we see there in Revelation 41
[1:11:17] the open door in
[1:11:19] heaven amen what was this this was a
[1:11:23] time amen a place at a
[1:11:28] junction amen between the Pentecostal
[1:11:32] age of Lady yosia and the bride age
[1:11:38] dispensation of the time as Believers of
[1:11:41] the message are now living in so since
[1:11:45] we since the opening of The Seven
[1:11:50] Seals in
[1:11:52] 1963
[1:11:54] it is important that we recognize the
[1:11:57] Junctions within the message amen amen
[1:12:01] and the doctrinal changes that took
[1:12:04] place from the Pentecostal age of age
[1:12:07] teaching to the bride age teachings
[1:12:10] right amen
[1:12:13] amen and so it's very important for us
[1:12:16] to understand that brother bam started
[1:12:19] out as a young
[1:12:21] Minister are you with me M he didn't
[1:12:25] know everything from the beginning right
[1:12:28] right he had his
[1:12:31] ministry with many things in his
[1:12:34] understanding that needed to be
[1:12:38] revealed
[1:12:40] right
[1:12:42] amen still a prophet now right don't
[1:12:46] misunderstand
[1:12:48] me so out by the real truth of the word
[1:12:52] and so there were Junctions along the
[1:12:56] way in the
[1:12:58] message the real true light of the
[1:13:01] revelation of this hour was revealed and
[1:13:04] proclaimed clear to
[1:13:07] him and that is also this our
[1:13:11] experience every last one of us in here
[1:13:15] Amen in your life in your natural life
[1:13:18] you're going to come to
[1:13:21] Junctions in your life amen where you
[1:13:24] have to make a I'm talking
[1:13:28] natural from a child to a
[1:13:31] adolescent from an adolescent to a
[1:13:34] teenage or a pre-teen right from a
[1:13:38] pre-teen to a
[1:13:40] teen from a here's the here's one here's
[1:13:43] the here's the here's the trickiest
[1:13:45] one from a teen to an
[1:13:49] adult that's where most people get lost
[1:13:54] amen it's a junction amen amen and in
[1:13:58] the junction what do you need you need a
[1:14:01] guide
[1:14:03] amen amen or you can't you can't
[1:14:08] navigate your way through the
[1:14:10] junction at every Junction of your
[1:14:13] natural
[1:14:14] life when you're embarking on a marriage
[1:14:18] you it's a
[1:14:21] junction it is something that must be
[1:14:24] prayed dearly
[1:14:26] about earnestly about why because you're
[1:14:29] at a
[1:14:32] junction and you can go the wrong way or
[1:14:35] you can go the right
[1:14:37] way it's a time of
[1:14:40] decision amen and you don't want to go
[1:14:43] out assuming
[1:14:49] right because your heart is telling you
[1:14:51] one thing right oh my
[1:14:54] and that's a heavy
[1:14:56] pull amen oh she's everything that I
[1:14:59] wanted he's everything that I dreamed
[1:15:04] of but what does God
[1:15:07] say if you make the wrong turn right
[1:15:11] here it could ruin your
[1:15:16] life amen and in this room you may never
[1:15:20] come
[1:15:21] back you going to have to live with that
[1:15:24] thing amen amen so it's it's it behooves
[1:15:28] you to
[1:15:29] pause sometime in life you got to just
[1:15:32] stand still for a little
[1:15:34] bit wait a
[1:15:37] minute I got to go talk to
[1:15:40] Jesus and I ain't talking about no five
[1:15:42] minute prayer
[1:15:45] wait wait on him we sing the song wait
[1:15:48] on him he's an old time God cuz we want
[1:15:53] to make the right decision amen at the
[1:15:56] junction yes amen
[1:15:59] amen we we we we we we we decide on a
[1:16:03] career on a
[1:16:05] job that's a junction that's right we
[1:16:09] find sometime that if we make the wrong
[1:16:12] decision it takes us out of out of God's
[1:16:17] will sometime we we the job I can't get
[1:16:21] to church now right
[1:16:24] now we follow it all the way the
[1:16:27] decisions especially married people with
[1:16:30] children the decisions that you
[1:16:33] make is not only going to affect
[1:16:37] you I don't care what happened you could
[1:16:41] have been so hurt well I did I did this
[1:16:45] because of the pain in my life I get it
[1:16:48] because I was hurt I went through a
[1:16:50] traumatic
[1:16:52] event
[1:16:53] stand
[1:16:55] still because the decision that you make
[1:16:58] now is not only going to affect you but
[1:17:01] it's going to affect your children your
[1:17:03] children's children your children's
[1:17:06] children's
[1:17:09] children it's not just about over what
[1:17:12] some temporary upset
[1:17:16] feeling you got to think more long term
[1:17:19] than
[1:17:22] that
[1:17:23] amen CZ we're
[1:17:25] upset impulsive
[1:17:28] decisions we got to be more I'm going
[1:17:30] get into that we're no longer see we've
[1:17:32] come up to the the
[1:17:34] dispensation of the Bride we're no
[1:17:37] longer Pentecostal
[1:17:43] babies when I was a child I speak as a
[1:17:48] child I act as a child but when I became
[1:17:51] a man I put away child childish things
[1:17:55] and I carried myself like an
[1:17:56] adult grown man grown
[1:18:01] woman and they're not
[1:18:03] impulsive but
[1:18:06] prayerful amen All Right Moves
[1:18:12] cautiously scripture says that it moves
[1:18:15] HH what's the word I'm looking for like
[1:18:17] a
[1:18:18] cat walking over the walls of nails and
[1:18:21] glass
[1:18:23] very Surf
[1:18:25] footedly not for sure his next
[1:18:30] step not to go the wrong way right right
[1:18:35] amen I said one time long I'm too old to
[1:18:37] make any more
[1:18:40] mistakes cuz it take too long to come
[1:18:45] back I can't afford to make no more
[1:18:50] mistakes amen amen amen but we look at
[1:18:56] this this this the
[1:18:57] picture within the
[1:19:00] message within within our walk with
[1:19:04] Christ through the scripture there were
[1:19:08] Junctions if there was Junctions in our
[1:19:12] life there was Junctions in the
[1:19:14] prophet's
[1:19:18] life
[1:19:20] amen there was the Within message there
[1:19:24] are Junctions within the
[1:19:27] message amen and you have to be able to
[1:19:30] follow the prophet amen or you will miss
[1:19:34] the
[1:19:36] junction that's why he say say what the
[1:19:38] tap
[1:19:40] say or you miss the
[1:19:46] junction shame to say some of Mr
[1:19:50] Junction and so it's very important
[1:19:53] for us to understand when brother
[1:19:56] brandham started out as a young
[1:19:58] Minister am mean he had some things that
[1:20:01] had to be
[1:20:02] revealed amen and so because this when
[1:20:06] people come into the
[1:20:08] message from a Pentecostal
[1:20:11] background they will naturally bring
[1:20:15] their Pentecostal understanding over
[1:20:18] with
[1:20:20] them and so they will also need the Lord
[1:20:23] to straighten out their understanding
[1:20:26] over a period of time by the truth of
[1:20:30] the hour as they walk along in the light
[1:20:32] of the
[1:20:34] message see there may be some here that
[1:20:37] don't quite understand everything now
[1:20:39] but just just keep
[1:20:42] on allow God Amen to give you the
[1:20:47] revelation of what what's going
[1:20:51] on Amen
[1:20:53] but when they start out in the message
[1:20:56] they are looking at the message mostly
[1:20:59] through their Pentecostal background
[1:21:03] religious world
[1:21:06] view and so that is why they they are
[1:21:10] able to
[1:21:12] find
[1:21:16] quotes in the
[1:21:18] message that will seemingly allow them
[1:21:21] to preach amen
[1:21:23] yes a Pentecostal teaching of the Holy
[1:21:27] Spirit
[1:21:28] baptism
[1:21:31] amen because they are bringing over
[1:21:33] their understanding from a bygone
[1:21:38] age of Lady OA yet the prophet tells us
[1:21:43] in many places in the message that we
[1:21:45] have to die out to that understanding in
[1:21:49] order to come into a bride age are you
[1:21:53] with me
[1:21:54] amen
[1:21:56] now he said in the anointed ones at the
[1:22:00] end
[1:22:00] time amen the life keeps advancing on
[1:22:06] but remember it's in another stage it
[1:22:12] can't remain in that
[1:22:14] stage we can't
[1:22:18] eat the
[1:22:20] carryon of some other age
[1:22:23] we can't eat Pentecostal carry on
[1:22:28] Methodist carry on Baptist carry on we
[1:22:34] see it becomes a carry on we have fresh
[1:22:39] food of this hour yeah the real
[1:22:47] fact is that in the message of the hour
[1:22:50] you can find quotes that it support
[1:22:52] almost almost any false teaching just as
[1:22:54] you can in the
[1:22:58] Bible over time with all different
[1:23:03] denominations and we have seen a lot of
[1:23:06] it through the years but the true bride
[1:23:10] will not be deceived because she will be
[1:23:15] guided by the Holy Spirit of the inner
[1:23:18] teacher that will lead her through all
[1:23:21] the mind feels of the false amen this is
[1:23:26] why that scripture is so important when
[1:23:29] the spirit of Truth has come he will
[1:23:32] guide you into all
[1:23:34] truth so we have come to realize that
[1:23:38] brother brandham didn't start out
[1:23:40] knowing everything at the
[1:23:44] beginning and the lack of understanding
[1:23:47] is what he caused many to become
[1:23:53] confused over the years certain teaching
[1:23:56] of the message because when we read the
[1:24:00] message it is important for us to
[1:24:03] understand that the revelation of the
[1:24:06] hour first a journey of progressive
[1:24:10] revelation to the prophet himself as the
[1:24:14] Lord would reveal certain truths to him
[1:24:18] along through the season and the
[1:24:20] experiences of his life
[1:24:23] we all know that he was born a prophet
[1:24:27] but the revelation of the word in this
[1:24:29] hour had to be revealed to him
[1:24:31] progressively by God and so as we came
[1:24:36] so as the word came to him then he
[1:24:40] corrected the errors of the
[1:24:44] doctrine many have had because of his
[1:24:48] own human understanding and this is
[1:24:51] God's pattern for all of us in our
[1:24:55] experiences of Life as we walk through
[1:24:59] this hour listen at what he said in the
[1:25:02] message the unveiling of God Amen
[1:25:05] preached in
[1:25:07] 1964 he said watch them takes as they
[1:25:11] come down watch each one how it comes
[1:25:15] more pler and pler right
[1:25:20] amen amen so there's a certain
[1:25:23] Pentecostal doctrines that were
[1:25:25] corrected as the message Advanced by the
[1:25:29] opening of the Mysteries being revealed
[1:25:32] in the in in this day but when a person
[1:25:37] would come out of a Pentecostal church
[1:25:39] amen background and into the message
[1:25:43] then they would still be able to find
[1:25:46] hundreds of quotes of the message that
[1:25:48] would allow them to preach a Pentecostal
[1:25:50] Doctrine concept of baptism of the Holy
[1:25:54] Ghost as a message Doctrine yet the
[1:25:58] prophet clearly tells us we are not to
[1:26:02] bring doctrine of the Pentecostals over
[1:26:06] age over into the new land of the Bride
[1:26:10] age amen now listen invisible
[1:26:16] Union the word that fell on the day of
[1:26:20] Pentecost will not work this day no
[1:26:25] sir that was for
[1:26:28] Pentecost this is for the
[1:26:35] bride going home of the
[1:26:38] Bride we got something different the
[1:26:42] Pentecostals represented again that
[1:26:45] represented now look the isua street
[1:26:49] represented the first Pentecostal Age
[1:26:51] Again
[1:26:53] again amen and we see in this time amen
[1:26:57] that we have developed or or or some
[1:26:59] have developed and going off of I'll
[1:27:02] call it instead of saying Pentecostal
[1:27:05] I'll say our
[1:27:07] culture I'll say it that way because as
[1:27:11] most of us that have grown up in church
[1:27:13] and around religious system it has
[1:27:16] become our
[1:27:19] culture and what we do we try to come in
[1:27:22] and mix our culture into the message
[1:27:26] that's

[1:29:55] have an end and hell was created notice
[1:29:59] how the seventh angel Prophet was sent
[1:30:01] to straighten out all of these crooked
[1:30:04] areas of man's false interpretation of
[1:30:06] the word and now listen to the next
[1:30:09] mystery that he tells us we'll be
[1:30:11] straightened out in this last Age The
[1:30:14] Mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:30:17] without sensation but the person of
[1:30:20] Christ performing in you the same works
[1:30:22] that he
[1:30:23] did amen it is a mystery amen of the
[1:30:27] baptism of the Holy
[1:30:30] Ghost by the way that's the title of my
[1:30:33] message the mystery of the baptism of
[1:30:35] the Holy Ghost
[1:30:38] amen now we look
[1:30:41] here what did Christ
[1:30:44] do he fulfill
[1:30:48] scripture that were written of him for
[1:30:52] that
[1:30:54] hour you follow me there he was the work
[1:30:59] that he
[1:31:01] accomplished and so as the end time
[1:31:04] bride of this hour this is what we are
[1:31:07] also called to
[1:31:09] accomplish in this day as his body on
[1:31:14] Earth for this hour we are to
[1:31:18] fulfill every
[1:31:20] scripture that has been prophesied at
[1:31:23] the end time bride of
[1:31:26] Christ we are to
[1:31:29] fulfill the prophecy of Rebecca at the
[1:31:34] evening
[1:31:35] time well who meets
[1:31:38] Ela and follows this man all the way to
[1:31:41] her unseen
[1:31:43] bridegroom amen this is one of the
[1:31:47] stories that Christ has been writing in
[1:31:50] your life because
[1:31:52] he is the Isaac part and so there must
[1:31:56] come a Rebecca part to be fulfilled
[1:32:00] also
[1:32:02] amen we are also to
[1:32:04] fulfill the end time prophecy of Abraham
[1:32:09] and
[1:32:10] Sarah meeting the Lord himself in human
[1:32:14] flesh again revealing the secrets of the
[1:32:17] heart we are to fulfill the type of
[1:32:20] Abigail
[1:32:22] who was married to a rich but arrogant
[1:32:25] husband amen type of Lady of see age
[1:32:28] condition but then she came into a new
[1:32:32] age marriage to King David a type of
[1:32:34] Christ amen we are also to fill the type
[1:32:40] of Esther coming into a marriage Union
[1:32:44] after
[1:32:45] vashy a type of Pentecostal church was
[1:32:49] put away for refusing to come into the
[1:32:52] presence of the
[1:32:53] king she refused to O the oh she refused
[1:32:57] to obey the word for her day
[1:33:01] amen but a bride amen must fulfill those
[1:33:05] things we are also to fulfill the type
[1:33:08] of Ruth at the Harvest Time who came
[1:33:12] into a union with Boaz the lord of the
[1:33:16] Harvest and Rahab at the time of
[1:33:19] judgment amen when the talk was
[1:33:22] displayed in Mary Salomon we are in this
[1:33:25] day amen called Amen to fulfill those
[1:33:30] scriptures those scriptures are for you
[1:33:33] and I Amen to fulfill in this
[1:33:40] house all these
[1:33:42] scriptures must be lived
[1:33:45] out by the elect time end time
[1:33:50] people and so this is the work that
[1:33:53] Christ is performing in the lives of the
[1:33:55] elect bride of this
[1:33:57] day these are the supernatural stories
[1:34:00] of Prophecy in this day that Christ has
[1:34:04] been writing unto the story of your
[1:34:07] life amen you may not realize it amen
[1:34:11] but your life is telling a story your
[1:34:15] life is fulfilling a prophecy amen
[1:34:20] amen amen
[1:34:29] so if you only have a
[1:34:33] Pentecostal
[1:34:34] denomination
[1:34:36] interpretation of what it is to do Jesus
[1:34:40] is trying to copy you're trying to copy
[1:34:44] some historical
[1:34:50] event
[1:34:53] amen and bring it over into a this a
[1:34:57] bride
[1:34:58] age and it won't
[1:35:01] work the message of the
[1:35:03] hour it won't be before you will be
[1:35:08] encouraging the
[1:35:10] people hear me
[1:35:13] now you you will end up encouraging the
[1:35:16] people to look back yeah to a first and
[1:35:21] second P experience right of a platform
[1:35:26] performance of a outward Supernatural
[1:35:31] attraction and then all you would do is
[1:35:34] bring confusion into the message and
[1:35:37] attract the attention of the people of
[1:35:40] what the first and second pool did
[1:35:43] Brother Brandon's mystery but we know
[1:35:46] that the first and second pool
[1:35:48] Ministry amen performance draw big
[1:35:52] crowds has now passed because we are now
[1:35:56] living in the bride age of the third
[1:35:59] pool of the prophet's Ministry and where
[1:36:02] the spirit of Christ is now dealing
[1:36:06] privately with a bride under a
[1:36:09] supernatural
[1:36:10] administration of a revealing of himself
[1:36:15] by the opening of the
[1:36:19] word which then there is no public
[1:36:25] show it is between the bride and his and
[1:36:31] the
[1:36:33] bridegroom it's not to the public he is
[1:36:36] revealing himself to his
[1:36:42] bride so we we look at the mystery of
[1:36:46] the baptism of the Holy
[1:36:49] Ghost we don't want want to
[1:36:53] confuse amen the baptism of the Holy
[1:36:57] Ghost with baptismal
[1:37:01] anointing amen because see when the when
[1:37:05] the when when it when Jose I will pour
[1:37:08] out my
[1:37:10] spirit upon All
[1:37:13] Flesh and the prophet said it is the
[1:37:16] genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:37:23] stay with me now it is the genuine
[1:37:27] baptism of the Holy
[1:37:30] Ghost in the message or not ones at the
[1:37:33] end time brother brandham tells us that
[1:37:35] the rain represents the genuine baptism
[1:37:38] of the Holy Ghost that fell on both the
[1:37:41] just and the
[1:37:43] unjust the wheat and the
[1:37:46] CLE and so this was the teaching that
[1:37:50] was a great shock to the Pentecostal
[1:37:52] world of which the prophet was mostly
[1:37:56] preaching to at that
[1:37:59] time because it seemed so contrary to
[1:38:02] what the Pentecostal church had always
[1:38:05] been taught and believed that such a
[1:38:08] major point of this baptism of the Holy
[1:38:11] go Holy Spirit and now they are are
[1:38:14] being told that it will fall on both
[1:38:18] Sinner and Saint alike
[1:38:22] and so this was such a great contrast to
[1:38:25] their to their Pentecostal
[1:38:27] understanding
[1:38:30] amen and being the third work of Grace
[1:38:34] and so in
[1:38:36] 1965 there was a junction of the truth
[1:38:40] that was being
[1:38:41] sent by God to correct this Pentecostal
[1:38:45] error and understanding and so
[1:38:48] all so all of a sudden brother Brandon
[1:38:51] seemed to change the concept and what we
[1:38:54] always thought was The Ultimate Security
[1:38:58] of a person receiving the baptism of the
[1:39:00] Holy Ghost then they sealed them into a
[1:39:04] day of their red that they were sealed
[1:39:06] into the day of their Redemption but
[1:39:09] then from around July 1965 brother
[1:39:12] brandham began to make statements about
[1:39:14] the baptism of the Holy Ghost that seem
[1:39:17] to almost completely opposite of what
[1:39:20] they were taught broken
[1:39:23] systs amen broken
[1:39:27] ssts
[1:39:31] 64726 AR 100 the prophet said notice we
[1:39:36] find today that people there are many
[1:39:41] people believe in spirit fill spirit
[1:39:45] filled
[1:39:46] people I'm slow that down notice we find
[1:39:50] today that
[1:39:51] there are many just can't believe it
[1:39:55] even spirit filled people notice what
[1:39:59] he's saying here that even Spirit-filled
[1:40:02] people can't believe the true word of
[1:40:05] the
[1:40:06] yah I'm going to give you one that'll
[1:40:10] choke
[1:40:11] you the baptism of the Holy Ghost don't
[1:40:16] mean you're going
[1:40:18] in not at all not on that don't have
[1:40:24] anything to do with your soul now let me
[1:40:27] help you explain that so you don't get
[1:40:30] confused notice this Junction of Truth
[1:40:34] the word here is now that brother bram's
[1:40:37] own understanding has begun to see with
[1:40:39] a crystal clear understanding that there
[1:40:42] is a difference between the anointing of
[1:40:44] the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the
[1:40:47] Holy Ghost on the spirit realm the
[1:40:50] person amen the Holy Ghost of the
[1:40:53] revelation of the word of the
[1:40:55] day in the person's
[1:41:00] soul there is a
[1:41:03] difference there is a you have to go
[1:41:06] past amen uh feeling
[1:41:09] Goosebumps it has to go further amen
[1:41:13] than just uh uh an
[1:41:16] experience see because we want to
[1:41:18] understand that it is a process
[1:41:21] amen it is a
[1:41:27] process he said here in
[1:41:30] leadership the outward expression
[1:41:33] shows on the inside the
[1:41:37] CER the outward expression shows exactly
[1:41:41] what's on the inside see the CER many of
[1:41:45] you think I got the baptism of the Holy
[1:41:49] Ghost I I am going to heaven that don't
[1:41:53] mean one thing that you're going to
[1:41:55] heaven no sir you can have the baptism
[1:41:58] of the Holy Ghost every hour of your
[1:42:01] life and still be lost and go to hell
[1:42:04] the Bible says
[1:42:06] so amen so I want you to understand that
[1:42:11] what had happened what was happening
[1:42:13] that you they at at one point in time
[1:42:16] they would feel a little something amen
[1:42:19] the presence of God
[1:42:21] amen would come into a room or or or and
[1:42:25] people would feel the presence of the
[1:42:27] Lord and feel that that's the baptism of
[1:42:30] the Holy Ghost amen now I'm not it it is
[1:42:33] the it is but it has to go further than
[1:42:37] that it has to go deeper than that you
[1:42:41] can't stop there amen because see like
[1:42:44] in Revelation 4 say that there was an
[1:42:46] Open Door amen and John 16 says that
[1:42:50] when the spirit of Truth has come he
[1:42:52] will lead you and guide you into all
[1:42:55] truth amen so it has to be a revelation
[1:42:59] of the word of your hour that identifies
[1:43:03] the Holy Ghost amen amen many people can
[1:43:07] come and jump and Shout amen and and and
[1:43:10] clap and and and when the music
[1:43:13] starts and walk out and live like Devils
[1:43:17] but you know what they felt the real
[1:43:18] presence of the Holy Ghost it came and
[1:43:21] it washed them and they felt clean and
[1:43:24] they went home and had a real good time
[1:43:26] oh didn't we have a good time in church
[1:43:28] but that's as far as it went
[1:43:32] amen it has to go further than that my
[1:43:35] brothers and
[1:43:37] sisters it has to you have to allow the
[1:43:41] Holy Ghost amen the tutor amen amen to T
[1:43:45] to you unto a full baptism of the Holy
[1:43:49] Ghost not just an out pouring or the
[1:43:51] anointing of the Holy
[1:43:54] Ghost something that's going to
[1:43:57] stabilize you yes amen take me to
[1:44:02] Jeremiah
[1:44:04] amen Jeremiah the
[1:44:06] 18
[1:44:17] chapter remember we're parallel
[1:44:19] paralleling this time with Jeremiah so
[1:44:21] Jeremiah the prophet amen the word which
[1:44:24] came to
[1:44:25] Jeremiah from the Lord saying
[1:44:28] arise and go down to The Potter's House
[1:44:33] for I will cause thee to hear my
[1:44:36] words then I went down to The Potter's
[1:44:39] House and beheld he wrought a work on
[1:44:45] the wheel and the vessel that he made of
[1:44:48] clay was m
[1:44:52] in the hand of the Potter so he made it
[1:44:57] again another vessel as seemed good to
[1:45:01] the Potter to make then the word came
[1:45:04] word of the Lord came to me saying oh
[1:45:07] House of Israel cannot I do with you as
[1:45:12] the
[1:45:14] poter this is the Lord behold as the
[1:45:18] clay is in The Potter's hand
[1:45:21] so are ye in my hand oh House of
[1:45:25] Israel at what instant I will speak
[1:45:28] concerning a nation and concerning a
[1:45:30] kingdom and pluck up to pull down and
[1:45:34] Destroy now let me stop right there so
[1:45:38] we come Amen to The Potter's House amen
[1:45:42] it's not enough Amen to just come to The
[1:45:46] Potter's House amen you have to to be
[1:45:51] willing to get on the
[1:45:54] wheel amen he take you up in his hand

[1:46:05] when he picked you up amen clay you had
[1:46:10] all of the materials in you Amen to make
[1:46:13] a Son of God but what happened it was
[1:46:16] mixed up amen with carry-ons and ideas
[1:46:19] and and inuendos from a bygone age amen
[1:46:24] we had involved ourselves in all kind of
[1:46:27] debauchery amen of the devil and
[1:46:29] Confused us amen that had us mixed up
[1:46:32] Amen in the clay all of these additives
[1:46:35] was in the
[1:46:36] clay amen and it was only by the hand of
[1:46:40] the poter amen that can remove these
[1:46:42] things from the clay so what happened
[1:46:45] the poter had to sit down
[1:46:49] amen
[1:46:50] the Potter sat down at the wheel amen
[1:46:56] and he got the clay which is you in his
[1:46:59] hand amen and he put you on the wheel
[1:47:03] but he don't let go he still got you in
[1:47:07] his hand amen and he take down and he
[1:47:10] grab a handful of water amen and he put
[1:47:13] over that clay what was that doing
[1:47:16] making the clay pliable amen you have to
[1:47:20] have have amen the anointing of the Holy
[1:47:23] Ghost to make you pliable amen now you

[1:47:35] nothing sitting up in church with your
[1:47:37] lips poked out can't get along with
[1:47:40] nobody let alone the spirit of God so he
