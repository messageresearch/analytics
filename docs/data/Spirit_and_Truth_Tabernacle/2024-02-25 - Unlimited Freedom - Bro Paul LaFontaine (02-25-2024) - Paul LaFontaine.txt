just we just love the Lord we love love the Lord amen we're so happy on today that uh brother Paula fantain amen will be ministering for us and so good to have his precious wife sister Rebecca amen with us as well on today praise God Amen um they enjoying some of this Florida winter and where it's cold for us but it feels so good to them uh but we we thank God for all things so uh don't don't uh forget this this Wednesday will be um service at 7:30 Amen on Wednesday night and actually this Wednesday we are expecting uh brother Jonathan howchin uh from Indiana he'll be with us on this Wednesday ministering for us uh so keep that in mind uh uh last Wednesday the the Lord did something uh for us on on Wednesday night and uh while we were here um just I was I usually keep all my notes on my computer all the scriptures and everything that I want to read but um as I got here uh in the pull pit the Lord just began to say no no just read it from the Bible read it from the Bible and as I just was obedient to that I was kind of looking at some of the scriptures I had and one of the last scriptures that I had uh to read on Wednesday night um it was a very important scripture because it it uh took me back to a situation where God had spoke to us about uh write some things down uh things that you need from the Lord uh things you're praying about write it down and place it in the scripture and Hezekiah uh did this he received some letters from sonakar rib and when he got these letters this man was just making all kind of threats and and Hezekiah knew that you know the man was capable of doing the things that he said he was going to do but Hezekiah told the people whatever you do just don't say nothing to them don't respond to them and uh he said but God he Hezekiah told him said we got more with us than they got with them y'all just be encouraged be encouraged don't don't be dismayed we got more with us and uh he and he says uh Hezekiah took it and spread it before the Lord and what I found is that this story in scripture is recorded three times in the Old Testament uh it's recorded we read it out of chonicles uh on Friday I mean Wednesday night but it's also o found over in 2 Kings uh I think chapter 19 and then when I got home my daughter was sharing a testimony with me how the night before we come on Wednesday she was at home on Tuesday and um and she was just reading through her Bible and she found in her Bible uh Isaiah 40 uh 36 and 37 uh Isaiah 36 and 37 it's found there again I y'all thank youall just leave it there on the screen but Isaiah 36 and 37 speaks of the same story and she was at home on Tuesday night reading this and as she was reading it on Tuesday night she felt impressed in her heart write something and put it on scripture and she come to the church on Wednesday night and the Holy Ghost picks it up again and say write something down and put it on scripture now we feel like God spoke to us so I'm bringing that forward again this morning for those that were not not here Wednesday night your scripture to write something down is n 2 Kings 19:14 and I say ask God for impossible things big things big things and I and I I wrote some things down I'm asking God to do some things for for for for for for me my wife for my family for the business I'm asking God for some big things for the church I got than before the Lord and and I've done this before and I've watched God just take things right off my list I remember I asked the Lord one time Lord bless me um it was time for my kids to start driving I needed I needed to get cars for them I asked God to bless me with to be able to get those cars you know what I got cars for all of them when it was time for them to come so I don't seen God answer these prayers before Hallelujah somebody amen I believe I asked the Lord for full-time Ministry you know I got that [Applause] and and I also ask him to pay off my house he working on that he working on [Applause] that glory to God but I tell you what I mean I I you know we we did this uh under inspiration years ago brother Diggs was the first one to mention the scripture to us and then brother chende came through and mentioned it again years later and then Wednesday night the Lord brought it back around again so uh I'm I'm trusting and believing that we are going to see uh results uh from what the Lord has placed in our heart amen also uh the announcements we just want to make uh you uh mindful of um of streaming will continue through Twitter Facebook and in our church website John 423.15 very uh sensitive to um I know the Catholics during this time of year they go through lent and and I'm sensitive to not uh trying to have our fast look like lent I I'm very sensitive to that because I know how some people can can take that however I do want to say this I do want to say this uh when I was working at um you know this mega church and they used to take their Church through this you know every year and as an employee there I was it was a mandate that every employee had to go through the fast like you can't work here and and not Embrace what we're trying to do it just didn't make sense you know you're not even agreement with what we're doing here so they would they made it very clear and they they they would do this and I remember when I first did it the first time uh the thing that kind of struck me the most is like I know what we have when it comes to the word of the Lord but also know how we lack in what we give let me what we give back to the Lord how we lack in what we give back to the Lord and uh if no one else will be honest I can be honest with myself there was a lack in some areas of my life and uh fasting is something that Jesus did fast is something that brother brandom did fasting is something that just it's in scripture so when when I heard about it I said you know Lord I got to be able to do better than this so I I decided that I wanted to you know bring this to the church and and it's been I think very very rewarding uh for us but the uh the other thing is that I don't want it to look like we we're not trying to be Catholic anyway but I will say this that even if Catholics can sacrifice things what about the real bride amen so praise the Lord just just something to think about uh so our fast continues March uh through March 9th amen and um and like we said it's not anything whatever the Lord leads you to do summer fasting technology uh no social media that's a good fast no social media for 21 days some are fasting what they eat they're changing their diet and nothing wrong with that some are not eating anything uh until a certain amount of time whatever the Lord leads you to do this is not Le ISM in any way but whatever the Lord leads you to do we just encourage us all to be a part of it amen praise the Lord if you got a TV fast your TV amen praise the Lord all right Sunday school continues amen uh 9:30 to 10:00 a.m. amen we just started that a couple weeks ago and thank the Lord for just opening the door for us to be able to do this but ages 4 to 12 12 and young adults ages 13 to 20 thank you parents grandparents for bringing amen the kids out uh for Sunday school God bless you uh and brother Brandon made it very clear don't send your kids to Sunday school the prophet said that don't send them you take them don't send your kids to Sunday school take your kids to Sunday school amen it shows that you're just as involved am amen you see the importance of it don't send them take them all right um the uh Brothers virtual prayer be this Tuesday at 7:30 and then on Friday night we have a home tape Service uh will'll all be listing at home uh it's Mary's belief is a sermon that we'll be listenting to Mary's belief and you can see the date there uh we are really close to getting a new app up and running some of you all might might have noticed our old app is no longer working we tried to move to the new platform but they just would not give us the King James version of the Bible and uh for us that was a deal breaker amen we must have the KJV uh because some of the other script Bibles that they have nowadays they have taken out scriptures and um U they've just completely changed the meaning of what what what the word was saying so we we want to stay KJV amen that's what God gave his Prophet that's what the prophet gave USS is KJV so uh so we almost in the process of getting that completed and uh I'll let you let you all know once that's once that's uh said and done our giving is multiple ways those that are in the house of the Lord if you desire to give physically there's a box on the back table as you're going out you can give in the Box just drop it in the Box those that are online also in the house you desire you can use cash app dollar sign spirit and truth t as well as zel which is uh giving at John 14 42 3.org and we also receive giving through PayPal also giving at John 423

mailing address is there at the bottom of the screen amen so uh just something that I wanted to also make mention of to the church on um uh um we have have a um u a lot of visiting ministers amen that come through and it's just been a real blessing to us uh here this month uh but um next month the um the Lord had just kind of put something in my heart on the very first Sunday of next month to do

this section of time here this morning and see if God would give you something that would set you free praise the Lord God bless you we just want to say thank you to uh for the pastor inviting us to share this I would come and on my vacation and hear him and enjoy the service anyway and refresh myself but it's a privilege for him I know he's had many speakers in so you may be wanting to hear your pastor by now but uh we we're very privileged to be able to come and fellowship with you my wife and I and I just want to say thank you to brother Jack for his edification to our local church uh back in December to the winter youth retreat was a great blessing him and his wife being there and also then Sunday morning at our church and and I got sick that Sunday so it's a good thing he was there to fill in for me he really stepped in there when I was sick and uh we and uh we just had some sickness run through the church but we was glad he was there and also Sunday night New Year's Eve as well we really appreciate him being uh with us and uh also want to say thank you to the pastor for singing on our latest CD he sang a song with us there I have some of those CDs with us today and I appreciate brother Jack doing that it's a real honor to have him singing with me he makes me sound better he makes me sound a lot better and that's why I get people like that on my CD it kind of I raise up a not you know so he's a what a blessing he is praise the Lord uh before you before we read the scripture I wanted to give glory to the Lord a couple testimonies real quick my sister Sharon uh some of you know her was diagnosed early on last year excuse me in the middle of the year with stage four cancer and she went through through some of the chemo and we took her before the Lord and I'm sure most of you heard the testimony but she is now completely cancer free and God has healed her completely hallelujah amen so we give glory to God I want to give glory to him today amen hallelujah you know Hallelujah just when when that kind of thing hits your own family it it changes it and uh our dad my dad passed away about four years ago here just the other day four years it's been so that was a big thing for our family but when you have that kind of news from one of your siblings it was pretty serious for us and we are just giving glory to God I just like to always give the devil a black eye and tell him he's a liar praise the Lord and then I was telling brother Jack my daughter and her and my son-in-law had to go home early this this morning they were going to be here with us in service they've been vacationing with us and she had a real bad accident acent just a couple Sundays ago on the way home and I can't put the picture up but if You' seen the picture you know as well as me she come away from that without any bones broken or anything truck was total and there's just a lot of things that happened in that accident that once again God spared her life God spared my daughter uh my granddaughter would have been in the truck but she had went with somebody else home and uh then she was in the truck instead of their little Prius and that was of God because if it had been the Prius he certainly would have lost her life as well so it's a joy this week cuz we wouldn't have had her to spend this time with but it was a joy to spend with her my daughter and granddaughter it's just a joy praise the Lord amen I just want to say couple more things that uh the your pastor keeps us uh informed of your building situation and I'm glad he does that CU we're in prayer with you all remember this is my second church here this is my second at home so we're very much I I'm a member that's not here very much I I have I have a bad attendance record I just got a few other responsibilities there but I'm a member of this church hopefully and uh I I I I just want to say this real simply is that there's there is a building for you and I just want to say it may be a wait but it's going to be worth the wait it's going to be worth the wait I believe that that's I what I believe the Lord told me to tell you cuz brother Jack and y'all are having to wait a little longer than you expected but it will be worth the wait God knows how to do things in big ways praise the Lord amen well if you turn with me to John chapter 8 and um appreciate all your love and attention to the word this morning and your hospitality we appreciate brother Quinton giving us a place to stay there that the last couple nights we appreciate that brother may he be blessed for that appreciate the sunshine what I found in Florida is I come down here to get out of the cold and thaw out you know we get Frozen so we have to thaw out and I what I find is the sunshine is all free everything else cost down here but the sunshine is still free and I like that I was I was watching a local weather report and they were saying uh saying it's going to get a little chilly you should put put on a few more layers and I just laugh what are you talking about few more layers you don't need a few more layers this ain't cold y'all come up M we'll show you what cold is few more layers you don't need a few more layers praise the Lord John chapter 8 and a familiar area of scripture here but maybe we could take it and I was just wrestling this morning still with some things and we believe this will be a contribution to the ministry here and we're all here this morning to go deeper in the Lord amen to understand him a little bit deeper in our Christian walk and what he wants to do in our lives through the power of the Cross and Redemption John chapter 8 and we'll just pick it up here in 31 excuse me yeah verse 30 verse 30 and as he as he spake these words many believed on him so there was he spoke some words here and there were many that were Believing on it and and then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him if ye continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed so he's taken people who believe oh this is good yes I believe what's going on but he wants to let them know it's not him that starts the journey it's him that continues in the word so that teaches us that the being in the word of the hour is a journey it's not a one night event that's exactly right God bless you brother Mark it's not a one night event it's a journey and so now he wants to let them know if you continue in the word then are you truly disciples it's not that you're one night and then next week and you're gone and you're in five years and you're in and out and everything else no no there's a mark of a real believer that's got something that he continues in the word because it's a journey and then goes on to say he said ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free they answered him we be Abraham's seed and we're never in bondage to any man what are you saying that ye shall be made free telling religious leaders that they're bound Jesus is bold he tells them the truth yes you don't look bound but you're bound amen you need Freedom through truth right we be Abraham's seed we're never in bondage to any man how sayest th you shall be made free Jesus answered them verily verily I say unto you whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin and the servant abideth not in the house forever but the son abideth forever and if the son therefore shall make you free ye shall be free indeed which means you'll be truly free you're not truly free until you come in touch with the son of man and he's out to make you completely and truly free our heavenly father father we feel very moved by your spirit this morning Hallelujah I love to come and hear the singing Here Lord and the worship and the music Lord for God you have done something in our hearts we have something to sing about I pray father that I would just lend my gift to you this morning that it would be a blessing to the local body here father for we love them we've been praying for them Lord and we've I hope that I can help some portion of how the pastor here has helped our church and helped the young people people bless him and his wife and the family and the church here and Lord you know the needs that are here father you you know God before we even ask so I pray father you pave away for whatever needs be there in the name of Jesus Christ bless the service today in Jesus name amen amen amen you may be seated I've been preaching at home a little bit on the uh preaching about freedom and preaching about bondage a little bit and uh I've been uh just researching and praying to the Lord and just actually uh exploring the different forms of bondage because one of the things I think that we do sometimes is that we all have a certain perception of what bondage is and what someone is bound by and we have a certain way that we think about it and often we think of somebody who's physically bound someone who's in prison there physically you can see that they're in prison uh someone who H has chains on them physical chains it's easy to see that they're in bondage but we we want to present to you this morning that there are other invisible forms of bondage that sometimes we don't see sometimes we don't understand and I think when we come into the presence of the Lord and come into the presence of the son of man if he wants us to set set us free which he does then a part of his ministry will expose all forms of bondage because if we don't know it then we don't know we're Bound by it so one of the blessings of the Lord is that he not only wants to set us free but he can't completely set us free unless he shows us what the bondage is and uh there's another scripture that I use in this series I've been using in that it's just a few chapters before and it says the son of man came to heal all manner of disease he covers it all he comes all forms of bondage it doesn't matter if it's physical sickness it doesn't matter if it's emotional sickness it doesn't mean matter if it's Financial bondage it doesn't matter to God what form of bondage it is let me say this if it's binding you at all he's interested in setting you free from that bondage he so loves you that he's going to show you things that are binding you that you didn't even know were binding you you say that can that be true brother Paul well it's true here with these Jews because they didn't know they were bound and they didn't know what they were Bound by and Jesus is the one who had to tell them the truth you're bound and then they get defensive about it we're not under bondage we're of the we're of the Seed of Abraham we're not under any man we're not under Herod or anybody like that we're we're we're free we're free and Jesus said you're not free because I'm the word of the hour I'm the son of man and some reason for some reason you're resisting me so if you're resisting this word you're not free there's something holding you back and this morning there may be something holding you back you can't quite get where you need to be because there's something holding you back amen amen amen uh I'm a a pastor many years now 30 I forgot how many years but 30 something years 35 years years and you learn to watch people's lives and you learn to watch your own life but there's sometimes people come they worship they're there but you see now when you look deeper like uh Solomon looked deeper into men's lives by the discernment of the Lord you can see sometimes people in their Spirit their facial expression sometimes not even that they can come for many many years but you see ah they're they're not quite as free as they could be wow wow wow there's still something there that's holding them back wow H and if I don't get to say it this morning I believe that the the the freedom and uh uh in Christ is to make us completely I believe there's no limits to how free a human being can be in the Lord and I don't just mean we're free to worship and we're free I believe I I believe that affects it but there's there a lot of people that I've seen worship they seem to worship so freely but they're bound on the inside so we got to have it all we can't just take the worship we just can't be uh praised in the Lord with our voice but we're held back somewhere else he wants to make us completely free so uh I spent quite a bit of time on the Satan's bondage and the different forms I'll never get to all of them today but I want to mention some of them to you that I found in the scripture and also in the message and spent quite a bit of time just exposing the different forms of Satan's bondage bondage does not always look like bondage uh there are some people that's physic physically in prison but uh how many knows people can go to prison but then there's a such a thing called house arrest okay so there's a house arrest so they're allowed to go home and they're allowed to maybe go to work maybe depending on the court order they're they're allowed to be in their home and exist and there might be a little monitor on their ankle because they got to keep track of where they're at GL but you don't see that monitor around their ankle but they're in bondage nonetheless they're in prison none even though they still get to go to work and they still they get to function their home some kids still get to go to school to college but yet that you can't see that they're bound but they are still under bondage and that should tell us something that sometimes bondages you just can't see with the naked eye amen and in John chapter 8 we see then that uh they they open this with Jesus showing the telling the leaders the Jewish leaders you need to be set free free we're Jews we're preachers to the Jews what gives you a right Jesus to say this reason they said that they were in bondage to something that they were not aware of they were defensive because they were not aware of the type of bondage that they were in WoW amen they only knew bondage in slavery is maybe uh slaves to Rome or slave in a home back then they had certain types of servants and slavery within the house I'm going to get to that in a minute because Jesus Jus refers to it he said the son in the house he's free but there's servants in the house and the servants they never get total ownership to the home that's right they never get to be called a son so they're always continually in bondage while while living they can live in a mansion but because they have the title of a servant they'll always remain in bondage but I'll go ahead and tell you he who the son sets free if there's a if there's a son that's in the house that's not bound by anything he has the right to walk up to a servant and give them their freedom brother he has the right to say you're not a slave anymore you're not a servant anymore this day I set you free and now you're a part of the household you're part of the body you're part of the body of Christ yes that's him making us Sons and Daughters of God that's him bringing us out of Egypt From Slavery to Sons and Daughters of God isn't this the whole Ministry of the first Exodus the second Exodus the Third Exodus what is it to bring us out of bondage to the freedom of Sons and Daughters of God hallelujah so we see then that John 8 these they've got a bondage they don't know about and I don't want to spend a lot of time at it because you realize what it is they were under bondage of course by an unconverted nature of the serpent and they had religion relig and they had Pride with that religion and that caused them not to believe the truth that was being presented to them the truth of the hour the word of the hour was standing in front of them in the person of Jesus Christ and they could not receive them so they had to be under bondage their religious pride and their lack of the Holy Ghost and all this caused them to be in a bondage and how do we know because they couldn't freely receive Jesus said there's something wrong because you can't freely receive re the word of the hour so if you can't freely receive it something's wrong and he's pointing that out they didn't want to hear it but he's pointing out so under the light of the son of man we see it exposed invisible bondage it exposes all kinds of bondage why does it do that why does God does God does God like to embarrass us does Jesus like to expose things no he doesn't do it just to embarrass us he doesn't do it for that reason at all he does it because he's out to set the human being completely free right right there's no limits to this Freedom you put limitations on it amen Satan puts limitations on it and I asked my church I said how free could you be how free can a human being be yes yes yes well the way I read it there's no limitations to it I know we have boundaries and we have things in the scripture to keep us protected from the things of the world all that I believe in boundaries but the human being through the grace of Christ is meant to be completely free free from the past free from the fear of the future free from other men's opinions free from losing sleep over what your daddy said about you at five 5 years old right free from the bondage of bitterness free from the all bondage in the atonement he's meant to set us free how free can a human being be how confident can a human being walk amen with this Freedom amen my to me there's no limitations to it that makes it a little hard to preach on this morning because listen I'm only I'm only so capable of bringing it but I can safely say that he has he has given man uh the greatest thing in the world and that is complete Freedom the human being can be completely set free of any bondage in their spirit in their minds right amen I went into an area a couple Wednesday nights ago that was a strange area I'm just going to mention it now that we wouldn't think that Paul could be free from this because you know Paul sought the Lord three times for a thorn in the flesh exactly right exactly right so I was asking my church says and now wait a minut this doesn't seem to work right in our eyes because we asked the Lord for something he's supposed to you know he's supposed to do it he's he said he would do it yeah right but here's something he said so that you won't look at me in too much pride and I wouldn't get too much pride I sought the Lord and the only answer I got from the Lord is your grace is sufficient so there are some things that he doesn't take away wow but my question my church is that could Paul still be free and still have that Thorn In the Flesh and the answer has to be yes as long as he was living in the sufficient grace of God every day he could still be free see how that freedom is even in the things that would irritate us now I know nothing irritates you people here you don't have anything in your life that irritates you I've got about a hundred things but I I know you don't have me here in Florida you got the sunshine and all that there ain't nothing that irritate you but I got a few things that irritate me but I can still live free in my spirit amen Paul said he was talking about doing this and Grace and law and he says there's certain freedoms people have don't use your freedom freedom to offend somebody else there's certain things that's not expressly black and white sometimes in the scripture so you live there say I'm going to pray about it whatsoever is not a faith is sin so you do something you don't have faith to do it you shouldn't do that but he goes on he's talking about he says I will not be brought under the power of any he said all things are lawful for me but not all things are expedient but here's the key I will not be brought under the power of any of those things amen amen amen that means he's free right right Hallelujah Glory so just getting past the Jews he's speaking about here because there's many things we could say uh about them but this being under the bondage of denomination of their conception of God these Pharisees the conception of God was wrong that's what brought them under bondage they're Bound by denominational ideas and it taught them to to believe against God to disbelieve God that it veiled Jesus to them it it it it couldn't be God there in Jesus they could couldn't see him so their bondage was no freedom to just embrace the anointed word for the day that was in front of them they said we're not bound we're in the lineage of Abraham today they would say we're Christians we're not bound we're Christians we have this and I'm a Christian today but if you're bound and being a Christian it's not meant to be whether it's denominational ideas whether it's habits of sin right whether it's something from your past you can claim to be a Christian but Christian means freedom in your soul and spirit amen amen hallelujah amen amen so let but just let me say something this morning about the freedom in Christ the depth of Freedom talk a little bit more in a minute about the different forms of bondage the depth of Freedom a human being can experience in Christ I would say that we can put no limitations on that uh Satan would like to put limitations on it Satan would like I we put limitations on but Satan will probably works overtime to keep uh many from the depths of Freedom that they could experience Satan Works overtime to do that in your life but I I'm thinking that we're called to being more free than what any of us realize uh I'm talking about unlimited freedom in your soul and in your spirit and in your mind uh how how unlimit is it I I think it's to infinity and beh Beyond I think our freedom in the Lord and I'm just trying to do this to to expand our our Revelation glory of the freedom of Christ right so that we don't limit it just by our minds of I I'm only going so far here and I'll never reach Beyond this and we shouldn't ever put those limitations on God we should as you pastor's instructing to write it down and no no vision is too big serve a god of the impossibilities can you say Amen we're the ones in our minds that put limitations on things but the worst thing is when we put limitations on our personal our personal freedom in Christ and we can do that by our own thinking and and we put limitations the devil puts limitations on it and uh when God sets us free it's beyond just from smoking and drinking yes yes by the way drinking is a bondage that's right maybe I need to go back and remind you of that social drinking whatever it is B it's it's a bondage so you have to be set free of that glory to God and when he who the sun sets free is free indeed he's going to do it smoking drinking habits but we often think but he he wants us to set us free to be who we are in Christ completely free from man's opinion this is a freedom you can never find outside of the Lord Jesus that's right it's only in his word only in the person of the word but see the Lord has taught the Lord has taught us his way but you see then the world has taught us many different ways and misconceptions of what freedom is do you think women are that are caught up in the Fashions and styles of this world and the makeup and the phony looking like a mannequin instead of looking like a real woman the world has taught that woman she's free when she does that the Bible says she's not free right brother she's under bondage that's right she's caught into some web of something right you see and and and so this is I'm giving examples now this is the way the world teaches us uh uh that that sometimes you can have something that's presented to you young people listen to me you it's presented to the world this is freedom this is when you're going to really be free but there's a deception in that the the women's Liberation movement had the message that would set women free all right all right but it was flawed it wasn't the true Freedom that Christ and the word offers for a woman in Christ only he has true freedom for a woman that's right but they they sold it as the woman's going to be Li liberated she going to be free from men and free from things and free to do what she wants and wear what she wants and a lot of those Founders and leaders I shouldn't say a lot but a few of them came out of that movement and they're the ones who said when I was in that it actually binds women up it doesn't set them free they set it themselves you can look it up and read it they come out of that woman's and that this is messed up women it's taken them out of their god-given place they say it by their own testimony it's because every time you get away from the image of God you sell yourself into bondage every time the world sells you something it's always bondage yes brother then we think of the word coming back through the message message of the hour and even the devil's tried to attach bondage and tell women that the message has come to bind women up what a lie of the enemy what a lie of the enemy yes this message is the greatest revealing of Christ that's ever hit planet Earth ever before and in that revealing he gave women their respected dignity back again as a daughter of God you say what about the dress what about all that you're getting into the details but all that is a part of the mind of God to give women back their dignity as a daughter of God again wonderful and I say God bless you sisters young sisters whoever you are that are holding up the standard of this message what you wear what your your character Whatever It Is God bless you you don't get praised you won't get praised in this world you'll get put down out in the grocery stores you'll get looked at funny at your schools but I can tell you I want to praise you this morning because you're following the image of God and the image of God sets you free it always sets you free it's the devil that tells you this puts you under bondage oh my hair and my clothes he's the message what a lie my God what a lie so you see the world presenting those things I guess the one who made this beautiful creature of women is the one only qualified to give her true Freedom amen Hallelujah the path that God chooses to bring more freedom to you is truth you shall know the truth and the truth will set you completely free so the path is through truth you're going to live on lies you won't find this freedom but if you Embrace truth that's why he said continue in my word because the next step he's going to bring you be bringing you to more and more truth a lot of you are here this morning because you need to hear more truth and as you hear more truth and embrace it and take it in it sets you more free more truth sets you more free more lies put you into bondage so you must make sure that you're hearing the truth in this hour and speak it and talk about it and write it down as the pastor says we must speak the truth and things that are true in the scripture and to realize that that God is meant to set us free now let me get back to a couple other things that's bondage because I don't want to leave this without saying some more of them so we know and expose the enemy what else can be bondage in your Bible is a whole book dedicated to a group of Believers the Galatians who had come to the Lord been filled with the Holy Ghost and a little time went by and Paul was away I believe he he had brought them to the Lord and here they are as a little message church and some brothers brothers from Jerusalem came and visited them and told them you need to do this you need to do that praise the Lord you new Believers you need to be circumcised you need to do this and so now the the the freedom they had in Christ brothers from Jerusalem come on brother come back into that church and influence them back into legalism that's exactly right can I stop for a minute and say how much this has went on yes for many years in our own ranks it's the truth brother it's happened way too too much where there's influences to take the message itself with quotes and somehow turn it into a legalism to put people under bondage well it's right in our Bible Paul went to the Galatians he said he said he used the word again why will you be entangled again Stand Fast in the Liberty where Christ has set you free he uses the word again because they were free but now they were put into bondage again and so Believers can do the same thing where they found a freedom in Christ they're moving along growing but some influence brings them under bondage some sometimes a message influence can bring in things and bring the people under bondage even under this message this is just us here this morning right turn those cameras off I can be open with my second church here I'm just being open we have had way too much taking this message and making it something God never intended it's only intended to bring us freedom in Jesus Christ not legalism but it was Brothers well- intending brothers from Jerusalem that visited the church and Paul comes in Paul comes later and he's visiting a service and he he realized something wrong now I don't he didn't say what was wrong but he detected the people were not as free as they were before wow they couldn't worship as freely they maybe maybe they had a little look on their face and I'm a pastor I look at faces all the time you can tell when something's not quite right you can tell when they're feeding or they're not feeding sometimes it shows up in the face sometimes it don't but but wonder what Paul seen that day when he come to service and he realized something's wrong something's not right wow something has B bound this thing up where before the people were free and going along in the word as the word would open to them then they would Embrace things then they would take a hold of it and then now these brothers coming and mixing their old uh their old uh laws with the message right right maybe finding quotes to do it yeah yeah teaching these I know what Paul preaches here but you guys are really to be a real believer you're going to have to line and do these things and do do and and I know what Paul's seeing but he says he said you're entangled again wow you're under the who hath here's the gation who hath Bewitched you somebody has cast a spell on you and it wasn't smoking or drinking it was legalism from another message Church wow brother wow it can be another message church or could be a preacher that does it and it cast a spell on the people and they come under they were bound they weren't what they were befor amen I tell you friends if you've lost your freedom in Jesus Christ you need to take a good look at it today cuz he doesn't inue to be under some spell of some preacher or some other some other message influence sometimes the internet is not a good thing sometimes it's a good thing sometimes it's a bad thing cuz people sit on there and hear all kinds of ideas and let me say this since I'm feeling right at home it undermines the local Ministry and the local Pastor so many times in the early church God worked with the local Bishop and the local pastor Pastor to that church and when we have Bishops that are answering the questions for the whole message on the internet that's not the book of Acts way Hallelujah I I like the internet I I I we we're on there some and it's been a blessing to some people but there's a downside to it and I can go on and on about that I don't want to be get uh negative or critical I'm just saying it's real it's real that happens and people all of a sudden comparing what their Pastor saying to what the The Bishop's saying and all of a sudden the bishop becomes you see all those churches in the early church the Ephesians the Galatians the Corinthians were all little message churches that rose up as a result of the ministry of the son of man they were little message churches and you had the Corinthians the book of Correction they always you emphasizing majoring on a minor majoring on the gifts all the time and Paul had to correct them you had the Ephesians moving in their inheritance a little bit more and you had then you have the Galatians and so the whole book is about no no wait a minute stop here somebody's taking your freedom away Lord Merc and it was an influence from other brothers well- intending sincere Brothers No Doubt but I can tell you I'll just I could go on and on but I want to say this we must be ever so prayerful and be respectful of what God wants to do through the local church because in the book of Acts he started and did his work through the local church and then he would send some people out to start other churches from there but it's the Catholic church that ta changed the term of Bishop as being the local overseer to the congregation they changed it to being over so many churches now we don't technically have Bishops in this message but we have the Antichrist spirit that tries to do it yeah it's underhandedly and all of it all of it is to bring the people under a bondage and bringing them under something other than God's intended way the book of Acts church so there there's a the Galatians under condemnation under guilt they didn't have their Joy anymore there was it's kind of awkward when Paul got to the service something was wrong why are you withdrawn in your spirit when there's no need to be withdrawn in your spirit What's Happening Here Paul picked up on it something was wrong they had brought in an influence that wasn't right people say they have freedom from something while they're in bondage to something else I'm free you ever heard a young person say I'm free to do whatever I want wow that's a lie wow I'm free to do whatever I want that's not true Freedom all it may be bondage as well the world's freedom is highly sellable and and it Woos us to a so-called Freer one writer said it this way one Christian writer said when we use our Liberty as an opportunity for our flesh we stick our head through the Yoke of bondage all over again wow that's deep when we use our let me say it again when we use our Liberty as an opportunity for our flesh we stick our head through the Yoke of bondage all over again amen one uh one uh writer talked about intellectual bondage intellectual mental bondage results from ignorance of spiritual things people choose to be ignorant so they're blocked in there I call it stinking thinking it's just stinking thinking amen and they're locked in a certain mindset about something and they're not going to grow beyond that they're not going to be corrected they're not going to change that's a bondage it's called intellectual bondage it's called stinking thinking there's another thing called Financial bondage you probably know more about that one you can debt brings you under as a slave debt brings you under bondage God never intended for you to be living there praise the Lord there's such a thing as emotional bondage that means you're all locked up with something like bitterness or fear from the past or fear for the future some past physical or mental abuse past legalistic teaching or atmospheres that you grew up in and so you're under emotional bondage I have some people like that in my church and I just keep praying I keep preaching to them because they don't realize they come to church they lift their hands but they're emotionally locked upow I said they're emotionally locked up in their Spirit they can't give their full uh their full uhh uh life and their full heart to the body of Christ they stay alone they don't trust anybody they don't trust preachers so they're all locked up in their Spirit somebody say Amen this morning you know I'm telling the truth God didn't intend for you to come and lift your hands and worship and still be locked up on the inside we're not supposed to be locked up from anything from the past from any mental abuse from any sexual [Music] abuse young girl you're not supposed to say your whole life locked up by that and a lack of trust you can trust Jesus Christ you you can trust his word and there's people in the body of Christ he provides that you can trust you see you can be free this morning you can you say Lord I don't want to go another day all locked up in my spirit glory to God they say addictions of course is another bondage rise rafy says there's much that promises Freedom that is actually brings bondage it merely transfers it into a different form rather than conquers the dependency at its core this is addictions while they promise them Liberty they themselves are slaves of corruption second Peter 2:19 when a behavior or use of a substance becomes compulsive despite harm harmful consequences it is an addiction in all of its forms addiction is ultimately bondage to yourself okay now if you have things and medicines that help I Don't Preach against that that's why as long as you don't buy into the idea that this is the all answer to to it unow you don't become addicted to it because that's bondage and Christ didn't intend for you to be addicted to something so he says now in all of its forms addiction is ultimately bondage to yourself your flesh your Cravings addiction is a form of slavery in which millions are bound today amen even in the church sometimes here's another form of bondage rejection oh you're bound by by a lack of faith in yourself and in your position in Christ you have rejection issues in other words the first person your dad rejected your mom rejected you started back to somebody reject you so you rejected so anytime give somebody gives a little hint of rejection then you you you lock up because you're bound by rejection you're bound by a lack of faith and confidence in who God has made you now some people are bound by the the bondage of complexes they never accepted never were accepted in the crowd all of us have some complexes but some people it's extreme so they're they stay Bound by the com worried about what other people are thinking about them estimating some measuring themselves by what other people are measuring themselves by they live in bondage coming to church wondering what everybody's thinking about them I was so bad when I was a kid when they got in a huddle at the football game I thought they were talking about me just kidding that's how bad it can be though they're over there in the corner and I know I know they're probably talking about me and they're probably not it's just your complex is reading into it CU you're not confident in yourself they can talk about me all they want to I'm free in Jesus Christ I know who I am I don't care if they're talking about me Hallelujah there was a saying that says I spent the the first 20 years of my life uh no first 30 years of my life worried so much about what people were thinking about me and then I spent the next 30 years of my life not caring what people thought about me and then after those years were over I realized nobody was really thinking about me the whole time what a waste of time find out they weren't really thinking about me anywhere talking about me it's all in our mind it's bondage of the Mind it's another form of Satan bind you that you can't be totally free in Jesus Christ amen hallelujah wow prise God Amen they say you can be bound by unrealistic expectations of Life brother you just set yourself up for disappointment all the time expectations of people they were supposed to do this and they were supposed to come through and my parents were supposed to come through and my pastor was supposed to unrealistic expectations and somebody fails youu and you stay Bound by that all the time how about I mention the bondage of business and being too busy and no time for god well this is familiar to us in the first Exodus Pharaoh begin to put more work on the people more shifts Pharaoh's probably the first one to come up with three and four shifts the night shift and the the red eye shift and and the system is still doing it but what did Pharaoh what did what did Satan do it for back then brother brand said he says to make them the people of God become busy that he did it so they couldn't produce more children because he did two things then he began to kill the children so two things in the first Exodus and the second is sex Exodus and the Third Exodus is that he tried to make it real busy so they didn't have time with God second of all he's going attacking the children every all three exoduses he's going for the children wow wow so the same bondage of a system that's set up and guess what we can't get around the system but we're not meant to be so Bound by it but we that we no longer have time alone with God that's why brother BR says joked her husband amram he went upstairs he come in so tired he was so wore out but he was he was more tired of another thing that God had a promise to deliver his people he said he went up those stairs he said no I am not going to eat he was out for working all three shifts he comes upstairs to his prayer closet God God are you going to answer are you going to deliver where's your deliverer going to be he was tired but he wouldn't let the system bring him under bondage to not talk to his god wow yeah it's to make our lives busy and some of this business is just not needed as much as we think it Isen glory to God it's bondage to us you know I I remember way back I don't know this what 20 years ago in my Christian walk I remember the devil and he's he's he always whispered and I was going to go do this I was going to call this brother going to call do this he said a little voice you're too busy to do that look at all this stuff you got some bills to pay you got you're too busy to do that and after about a week I just caught it and I said isn't it amazing that little little voice who I recognize is the devil now saying that I'm too busy to do these things it's all things that had Eternal Merit to it wow it's all things that were more important than the things of Life are you listening to me this morning you got to be careful of that little voice that say you're too busy to do that you're too busy to spend time with your children fathers Amen brother you're too busy to teach them the word of God you're too busy to sit down and read them the Bible too busy to bring them to Sunday school amen I got to shift work I got to do I got a business I never understand Brothers in business who work on Sundays because they have a choice they call the shots see there are some things I can't say in my own church that I can say another I never understood somebody who has control of their own schedule and somehow they schedule all these customers on Sunday you're buying into the system of bondage you got a choice man I'll make that choice towards God every time then he'll bless your business praise the lord it's the sunshine that's affected me down here it's the sunshine praise be to God busy too busy too much to the system and so now so now we just want to move on here to something that's real important to wrap this up there this morning because there's a lot here as you can see I hope you see there's a lot of forms of Satan's bondage and you might have become a little uncomfortable with some of them this morning that's all right I still love you I I still love I just wanted to tell you about them you take it home you chew on it but I'm here as a gospel minister to say to you you are meant to be totally free from every bondage of Satan totally free free from the Fashions of the World free from what the world says you free to be your own identity in Christ instead of what they say about you how free can you be how free can you be there's a quote that I read years ago and it came up in this series again I just I've always it taught me so much about this scripture ye shall know the truth and the truth will set you free in in Christ's unlimited Freedom there are no restrictions so we got to find that before we can be truly free you got to pray and but sometimes you can pray hard for someone and we learn this through many quotes with this one especially we can pray hard but there's something else there's another another form of bondage that's keeping them brother Brandon prayed for many people and they didn't get healed because he said there was another issue another problem that was laying there that they weren't dealing with so now you can't just go on with it and say okay well because you might get to this point why didn't God heal them sometimes it's because there's another form of bondage that they need to be delivered from before they receive this freedom of their physical health and if that person's trying to hide that like if it's sin they're hiding it that's a problem because they're holding on to a bondage they don't really want to they just want a quick healing they just want to the pastor to pray for them they just want lay hands and they shall recovers and I believe in all that but they don't want to be delivered from other bondages in their life is this okay so it goes into something here in uh uh in uh let me just look when it's at I think it's way down here water water from The Rock in 1955 if you don't mind it's a little bit of lengthy reading but there's so many good things many times people comes to the house to my house that's been in meetings and so forth and that failed to get healed they wonder why then when they come in maybe there's some hidden something back in their life that they haven't done or should have done and maybe they'd forgotten about it maybe that's the very cause that the brother laying his hands on them or anointing with oil their Church whatever it was they didn't get healed listen friends you've got to find the cause before you find the Cure absolutely if you went to the oh this is great this all high tech here they're they all over this praise the Lord I I'm I'm not Tech savy I need help so this is great so you see here he said uh listen friends you've got to find the the cause before you find the C absolutely if you went to a doctor doctor I'm having a headache just a persistent headache he says well take this and gives you a few aspirin he's not a doctor he's trying to get rid of you the only thing is that doctor if he's a real doctor he would diagnose that case till he finds the cause of that headache then work from there now if you pray for a person that doesn't get well then there's something somewhere causing him because God's Sovereign to his word he's got to stay with his word Peter said on the day of Pentecost repent every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost if a man repents and is baptized he is absolutely God is Duty bound to give him the Holy Ghost if he's repented from his heart why why Terry why wait a long time is because there's something here that isn't right correctly God's got you say well maybe God just don't want to give it to me oh yes he does you take every bit of well you say maybe the Holy Ghost has been just so many God has got plenty of it for you don't worry could you imagine a little fish about that long standing in the middle of the ocean swimming around saying I better get a drink of this water kind of sparingly cuz I might run out someday well that's just about like thinking God hasn't got enough Holy Spirit for you that's right let me say it this morning just thinking that God doesn't have enough freedom for you this morning he's got this is an inexhaustible Fountain of Life there's no limitations to it how how free can a person really breath well why don't you find out because you have the word to do it un praise the Lord why not find out amen hallelujah how free could you be and so uh he says here my that's like trying okay could you imagine a little mouse under the great Garners of Egypt where there stacked in a billions of tons and little mouse down there saying well i' better not eat about one or two grains a day because I might run out of this wi this winter my that's like trying to think that God hasn't got Grace enough to save you heal you and he's wanting to do it more than you are ready to receive that's right sure he wants to do it could you imagine all the Waters in the world packed into a stand pipe about this big round it would go a thousands of thousands of miles through the air and how the pressure of that water coming down pressing down trying to find one little cre one little crevice to get out of it that's the way the love of God and the healing power is trying to pour in this meeting tonight trying his best everywhere God trying to make his way into the heart with all that pressure of divine love and everything trying to press its way into the people if you just show the right approach to it you can walk right up and just receive it just like that brother Braham snaps his fingers that's all because if God promised anything and you don't receive it there's something wrong people come sometimes I haven't I haven't got time tonight to go in the detail I will maybe next week on the testimony but how the people come from everywhere say well I failed to get it and a lady come not long ago saying that someone told her that she had Seven Devils another person told her she only had five and she wanted to know where the fourth went come on brother poor woman Plum gone nearly set in the room take taking her stockings and pulled her feet up in the chair said I haven't eaten for several days and I'm not going to eat till I find out what become of those Devils said where are they and I said well I don't know I never know nothing about it said well one Minister told me that's it I had seven devils and the other lady Minister said I had only five there's two of them gone somewhere now see and come stayed there for about two hours in my house stop right here I mean this with a great disrespect This Woman's bondage she's a Christian This Woman's bondage came from a minister speaking a wrong thing over their life oh that don't happen anymore oh yes it does that a word spoken by a minister not correct puts that person under bondage been a pastor 35 years deal with people coming most the people I minister to come from hurtful damaging situations within our ranks and I don't know why we have some new ones com and baptized but a lot of them are just wounded saints that were just under an abusive situation or told the wrong thing they're not living in truth they've come under the bondage this Minister told me something and for years I've been under that word because I had respect for [Music] him it's difficult you think Satan can work this subtle can yes he can he'll work in any form to bind a person up the source of this came from a minister told her she had seven one she had this and she's she's become a nervous woman she's not cleaning her house anymore she's not taking care of her husband anymore she's got physical problems she's all nervous and she's pulling her stockings up in the living room of brother Brandon he's there and she's just she has an eight for days and she's just going on and on and it all started she's under bondage clearly but it all started by something I just want to say it respectfully if you're going to say thus sayith the Lord on something if you're going to give a word of the Lord you better be sure it's from the Lord or hold your peace I hope that's okay to say it that's the way we're taught by the message of the hour and now sometimes we have this just general thing going on and you give somebody a free pass because they're a big minister no no no we don't do that all the orders place we're interested in God speaking to us truly God the truth not not not just a a a vague thing if it's going to be vague we'd go down the road here and join in with uh Benny Henn that's right that's right and the message didn't call us back to that it called us further on to Sons and Daughters of God the brid will have thus sayith the Lord she'll keep still that's it that's it we got to have the truth and we got to preach the truth over people's lives or we get in trouble is that okay amen Pastor can correct me later if I'm wrong or overstepping my bounds but this is in my heart listen these examples are here but they're still happening today we should be careful and only speak truth over people's life they're too important to God these lives are too precious to God to be messing withow thank amen had two or three teenage girls in a in a camp meeting Youth Camp in the last couple Summers something was said over them what is it wasn't the truth wasn't the truth at all didn't come to pass wasn't the truth how does a young girl deal with that that's right she's a respect the minister and you know she does and and I thank you for respecting him we'll leave it between him and God whatever but that's not a problem with the girl you don't play with these gifts am am amen so she's all bound and she's scared and she's all a mess here you know and nobody really knows the truth as the reason why and somebody has taken her condition that she's in which we're going to find out later as menopause that was the truth of it somebody's going to take her condition you still with me this morning don't you know don't sign out yet we're not done yet you know don't click the time clock yet I got people that come to church my church and they it's like a Time Clock you know click and then I can see them they zone out and it's click it's time to go because they're used to that at work you know punch punch the time time sheet give me four few more minutes you know if you leave the time card open you get paid more praise the Lord but she sat there and the poor woman Plum gone nearly sat in the room taking her stockings and pulled her feet up in the chair and said it's not normal for a woman her age to be pulling her feet up in the chair and you know and so she said uh she said I haven't eat for several days and I'm not going to eat till I find out what become of those Devils said what are they I said I don't know I never know anything about when one Minister told me I had Seven Devils the other lady in Minister said I had five there's only two of them gone somewhere now and come stay there about two years two hours in my house until God begin to speak and said lady listen you come from St Louis she said yes how'd you know that I said your husband's on the police force that's right I said you used to be a lovely housekeeper she said that's right I said recently your house looks like a hog pin wow the truth hurts that's right I said your daughter's over there now taking care of your husband said that's right said who told you that I just kept talking cuz I was in a vision and I said you went down to a little place first you went to a doctor he gave you shots yes those shots was called harmone yes you went down to a place and they told you you had Devils yes because you had a real funny feeling yes they sent you to California and some man told you you had Seven Devils you went to a woman she said you had five yes and they told you to come and talk to me yes that's right said how did you know that I said the holy spirit said so I said you haven't got any Devils to begin with right amen now the vision of the lord we finally get all after all this trouble you finally get to the truth and one of the truths you don't have any Devils Oh Glory now sometimes people have Devils but sometimes they don't and the devil's so crazy you don't have a devil he tells you you have devils and then you have Devils he tell you you don't have any Devils that's the work of the enemy brother that's why we need truth that's why we need the word that's why we need th say the Lord preached to us right from the Throne of God GL Oh my he says now surely lady you know he said uh you got you haven't got any Devils to begin with I don't want to miss any of this it's so good I've use this as a foundational quote for my life that's right she said I haven't no she no she goes I haven't got any Devils I haven't said no lady surely you know your mother went through menopause it's the menopause something natural and I said what do you think caral shots are for she said I don't know I said for the change of life that's what it is no Devils at all it's just absolutely it's just your condition of life and she began to relax my wife was cooking some bacon and eggs out there she began to look through the house and I said you kind of hungry she had refused to eat anything at first and then you kind of hungry yes she went out there and ate three eggs a big bunch of toast two cups of coffee a lot of jelly and she was just as happy as she could be she said brother brandom are you going to pray for me and cast it away I said cast what away she goes the the the the the thing I said there's nothing to Cast Away well I never felt so good in all my life she said what must I do I said go home go home straighten up your house cook your husband a big nice apple pie come on brother about that thick glory to God this is instructional for the sisters today I know it's instructional right now it's a big thick apple pie it's a special Ministry to your [Laughter] husband I love it hallu as you can tell I love it go home straighten your house up cook your house with a big nice applify about that thick when he comes in tonight throw both your arms around him kiss him Brothers can you give me a bigger amen than that kiss him kiss him sit down get on his lap this is coming from the Prophet this is the prophet's advice that's what I'm talking about I don't need to pray for you you need to you need to settle in the peace and the settl of Christ and get back to your duties in Christ and serve the Lord sat on his lap tell him you love him and Live Like a Lady ought to that's exactly that's all there is but see all the pouring out of oil all the Stomping kicking all the loud hollering wouldn't do a bit of good oh there's not as many amens on that you can have shouting you can have stomping you can have all the big thing and people still aren't set free right right sometimes they are but sometimes they're not so that doesn't the we don't judge the presence of God in Deliverance by the deciple of sound amen there's two quotes one says when God's around there's noise but then there's the other one that says he can do Supernatural things and there's no noise at all so we want to balance in the word of God I'm not preaching against noise this morning I'm just saying don't use it as a measuring stick that somebody's coming to the truth in their life to get deliverance from bondage what God is interested in in the services is full deliverance from bondage for people to be truly free amen hey amen so now let me finish this up because this is the climax here where he says all the pouring of all all the Stomping loud out wouldn't do it's the truth that makes you free that's it that's it that's it that's it you know I'm doing little search as young Minister I'm looking up this scripture you shall know the truth that's what he says next you shall know the truth he's quoting the my text today and I did a search and I found this scripture which you can't find it but two or three places in the scripture excuse me in the message and this is where that scripture is found you shall know the truth and the truth and this is the example because see when we think of truth it's the serpent seed revealed it's the godhead it's doctrines but it's all truth will set you free lies will bind you the LIE of the Trinity will bind youen but the lie that you believe that your parents told you that's not the truth of your identity that's a lie too and when you get look into the book of of Life the book of redemption which the seals have been taken off it's the book of our true identity and when you look in that book you get your true identity this is who I am I'm confident in who I am I'm confident the way God made me and now I can go on life with a skip in my step with joy in my heart I don't have to try to be somebody else can you say Amen am I'm free to be me according to the Book of Life I see my name in there I'm free to be me you shall know the truth and the truth will set you free see that's right so many times sure in a group you find a lots of people when you bring three or 400 people through the line there's many clean pure hearts in there that comes right through and they gets healed that's right but there's some that we have to get back and pick up the strugglings like that that fails it now we can only do it as God says so do God says do now if did you know if a man that has a given power power of faith not power not to himself but faith in God to do it to cast out an evil spirit and would do it outside of the will of the God's will would get himself in trouble wow that's some deep things but the point is is truth sometimes we think is other things but it's the truth about yourself it's the truth you know sometimes if you're sick you're sick okay okay you deny the symptoms there the lying vanities as was taught in Jonah that's the faith stand you take but you're not going to be unrealist realistic to say I'm not sick you're sick that's the truth but the deeper truth is I'm Healed by the blood of Jesus Christ it's all truth and there's a truth that trumps all lies can you say Amen oh I love him don't you amen free from all things I'm closing by saying he set us free from all things free from the past how many want to be free from your past free from condemnation free from addictions free from hypocrisy free from the Fashions of the world and the movies of the World free from worry free from Fear free from the damage of another person's criticism free from comparing yourself with other people free from going back to that trash today that's on your phone you've been feeding on you've been feeding on trash young person maybe older you've been feeding on that trash you can be free of that today free from complexes free from how you look at everyone else free from a bad attitude free from depression this morning how many want to be free from that depression free from the fear of people free from your theological background free from free from message Pride I'm in I'm good I'm better than everybody cuz I'm the message you need to be set free from that free from lifting your critical thinking above the word of God free to follow the lord alone if you have lost lose all your friends free to follow him alone if you have to do it free to love people just as if they've never hurt you see I'm just listing cuz I got to close but I'm listing all the things that Jesus sets us free from amen amen free to love people as if they've never hurt you free to love as if nobody's ever hurt you free to be happy even when others are drawing you into their complaining and complaining against you and speaking against you you're free to be happy free from complaining yourself amen free to speak the word positive instead of negative free to be all that God predestinated you to be living the dream not your dream his dream his vision I'm free to live the dream his dream his vision is greater than any trouble you have I tell pastors when I have to speak to pastors overseas and different Ministries being I just say you know there's a lot of challenges that come to pastoring but always remember the vision God's vision for the people will always be bigger than their problems pise God the vision that you have come to know through this message it's a message of a vision of the lord it's not just books and tapes it's God's vision for this hour and that Vision will always be bigger than your problems praise God hallelujah amen one scripture I'll leave with you and I'm closing Romans 8:21 says because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God just think about that a minute as we close just think about this scripture the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bonders because how how many know when Adam fell from his freedom Adam fell was all cre fell with it so when he was leaving living in Freedom as a Son of God and in his position with the title deed to this earth everything else that trickled down from it lived in a freedom as well amen now he falls Calvary brings us back now 2,000 years later after Calvary our our kinsman redeemer the lamb steps into John's vision and it became the theme of the book you you're all so receptive today I can't quit preaching I got to find a place to stop our lamb that went to Calvary our Kinsman went to Calvary but 2,000 years later he steps into John's vision and that whole Vision was about the book of redemption you know why it's about the book now it's about the book of R because our names are in that book amen and when that lamb our lamb stepped into that Vision everything begin to Rejoice he took that book he's going to take the SE cuz everything's about the book now and I'm called The Book of identity it's our true identity it's who we are in Christ everything comes becomes about our identity in Jesus Christ and because of the Bride finding her true identity and feeding on it all these years she will come to her position of power her her Redemption the power Redemption will bring her into that place despite herself he's bringing Sons and Daughters into that place until she comes to this glorious Liberty of the children of God and when she comes into this glorious I love it glorious Liberty this is the Glorious Liberty this book of identity this book of redemption what's it bringing into Liberty amen amen how do you know brother Paul it's a book of identity and positions and say because when they worshiped when he took the book they worshiped but then they said thou has made us Kings and Priests all right all right all right it made them something it brought them back to their true positions Kings and Priests but the main thing is they come into this Glory Liberty and this is the part I want to get to because the creation itself shall be delivered when this bride comes into her full Liberty everything else follows it the Redemption of this Earth follows it how important is it for you to be free this morning how important is it for you to be in this glorious freedom amen amen amen everything follows it and that makes me wonder when I walk into the grocery store I walk into the gas station or I walk into Starbucks or many times to McDonald's I walk with confidence I'm free sometimes I think they recognize that freedom they should they should I'm whistling sometimes I'm I'm talking to myself sometimes I shouldn't do that my wife sometimes they'll catch me in the bathroom I'm talking to myself she says why do you talk to yourself well I said number one there's two reasons I like to talk to intelligent people number two I like to listen to intelligent people talk that's what I tell her don't where you at anyway that's what I tell her but I talk to myself and I'm free in my spirit all right brother and something coms to try to bind me some some problem in the church at home or whatever tries to lose sleepover I have a place I can take it to the Lord say God you're in control you're going to take care of this I bear the burden there you are sweetie I couldn't find you I bear the burden of the flock the burden's something different but I won't let the devil will bring me under bondage because I'm not really the leader of the church God is let me say this to finish if if this has as much glorious freedom in it that actually it will affect all of cre creatures creation being delivered then I think it can affect other people that's around you that's true amen people don't like it when you get really free and you're yourself and you're not concerned about criticism you don't they try to criticize you and and you're not concerned about it they don't like it at first but there's some people that like it I want the freedom this guy has I want the freedom this sister has true people it'll trickle down fathers it'll trickle down to your family you're free they're going to become free that wife's going to become free amen amen the wife of the wife of the husband even the UN unbeliever that's right am you're free in Jesus Christ free to worship free to live you know who you are you know where you're stand not arrogance but confidence confidence if they got anything in their heart they're going to be drawn to your freedom and they be delivered too if all creation can be delivered because of this Glory Liberty the bride comes into how much more can it affect one another amen friends this is a glorious Liberty this is an unlimited Liberty don't you sit here and say well that's for you brother Paul no no it's for you it's for you don't limit it don't hold back talk to a brother and sister I'm going to be Bible says confess your faults whatever you have to do I'm I'm I'm searching for that freedom I'm going to be completely free in Jesus Christ I don't want to come and just Worship the Lord with my hands up I want to be free in my spirit it's not about being free at church to be free on Monday morning on Tuesday on Wednesday it's about being free I'm a human being that's been set free by the blood of the lamb and there's no limitations and he who the sun sets free I just think of that son of the house coming the only way they can get out of their slavery is for the son who's already a son to come and say guess what today I'm giving you your freedom amen and you're no longer a servant you're a part of the household of God the rest of your life hallelujah hallelujah let's stand together let's worship Hallelujah once the son has set you free ye shall be free forever you shall be free indeed freedom to worship freedom to praise

my feeble way of bringing it Lord may it get across to the people may something anchor in their hearts Lord there's something deeper there's something greater Lord I'm asking for it in my life Lord that you bring a little change in my life but God I could experience Freedom like I've never experienced it before Lord we shouldn't put any limitations on it Lord to be happy to be free Lord to have a something in our countenance Lord that others can see that's a person that's been completely set free it's more than just the bondage to smoking and drinking the things of the world but God it's something deep within us it's a fountain flowing out of us Lord something that tells people there's a real person that's been set free no bondage anymore bless the hearts of the people and we thank you Lord for the opportunity to speak to them today and give them Lord what you've given me I commit it to you now in the name of Jesus Christ amen everybody said amen God bless you praise the Lord Lord God bless you Amen brother Pastor is going to come now just turn to somebody shake their hand I'm free in the Lord Jesus Christ I'm I know what deeper what that means I'm free in the Lord Jesus Christ totally [Music] free bless the name of Jesus [Applause] [Music] um I'm I'm just so happy that uh brother Paul um stopped by um you know he's on vacation and he didn't have to just bring a thought to us just could have you know relaxed a little bit but um I'm so happy that he um he agreed to to to speak for us just you know I I feel like this is a series that we probably need to hear the whole series and uh it was just very very rich with a with a lot of content I know he just compressed a lot in just to try to get it to us but uh there there was a lot here church and I hope that we heard um from the Lord even as I was sitting there you know just meditating uh I don't think we should come to church kind of hear a sermon and then just go back home like we didn't hear anything God spoke here today yes he and and we got we got situations that we're all dealing with but God was trying to speak freedom to your circumstance and even showing us how the devil just kind of brings bondage in in so many different ways just basic things that we do on a day-to-day basis that we allow the enemy to bring bondage into our lives and then God comes with a sermon and and and brings Freedom uh as he was sharing that quote there's so much um oh Lord Jesus that quote going in my bag um you know we we had just come from a um a marriage conference in in um South Carolina and one of the things that um that I learned just through the years especially when it comes to husbands and wives is this um thing called the five love languages I've spoke about this to you all before and um now there are some that look at that and say well that's just psychology I need y'all to could we just bringing the quote back up paragraph 34 I want you to get pleased before before he gets there he tells the lady the lady say are you going to pray for me think about it I'm I'm not praying for you right because you're already free amen amen right this is this is this is what he tells her and then the other thing um you know he tells her he gives her advice and I want you to see the advice that he tells her go home not not not pray come here let me take some oil and anoint you and get this out of you no no go home straighten up your house cook your husband a nice big apple pie that thick now this is a Act of service that the prophet is telling this lady to use this is one of the Love Languages oh my when he comes in tonight he tells me to do something else throw both arms around him and look at this kiss him sit down and get on his lap now when when when they when they do when she does that that is physical touch that's right and then the ghost first then tell him you love him this is words of affirmation all in one little quote Oh Lord have mercy he never prayed for look at the advice that he gave her and I got another quote that I I shared I told I told Brother random say try this sometime yeah yeah he did it himself he say try this sometime and sometime we we we we don't even realize how much bondage we be in by just trying to uh avoid certain things God God want us to live in Freedom Church God I I I I don't know if y'all caught all these things today God just want us to live in Freedom we we we we don't realize how how how we how we bind ourselves up you know brother brandom used other people's material you know in order to bring certain thoughts he did that right so so please church let's walk in Freedom that God has given us let's let's understand this and and I just love I mean that quote was just so clenching because when he talked about Galatians and who hath Bewitched you the first thing went to my mind is uh if you if some of our young people may have never seen this and I want to encourage your parents to do this brother random um only recording we have audio I mean video recording is um um um deep color to the deep and you can see that all on it's on YouTube and everything but one of the things that's on that video brother brandom has a sister coming through the prayer line and he's in he's telling her uh what has happened it says you know you went to a preacher and uh they told you that you was a witch and uh when they told you that you was a witch now this has caused all not just trouble in your life but it's also caused trouble in your in your family and in the church because somebody told you this lie you the whole church is bound because because of this one lie and brother brandom told a lady to say look you're not you're not no witch that's a lie from that preacher you didn't got to believe that go on you're free from that now now when she accepted a freedom there's two things I want to say the scripture say he who the son sets free is free indeed how did the son set her free yes sir sir the truth that was revealed through the prophet that's right right and and even I I want to go a little further even today brother Brandon I mean brother brother Paul brings this message to us how did the son set us free today through the ministry of his son you understand is the ministry is flowing through his son brother Paul La fontain amen you know what that Ministry wants to flow through you as Sons and Daughters of God somebody needs to hear this and they can go free Jesus is speaking through you he wants to speak through you but you have to accept your freedom before you can bring somebody else to freedom I I want to tell you this this is revolutionary what we just heard here if you will allow this Amen to really go deep into your your your your your spirit this is revolutionary for your life I've been praying uh asking the Lord as we were um just approaching beginning of this year you all know that my theme has been our restore sayith the Lord and I've been asking the Lord just to kind of send me messages that would actually go right along with that theme I felt today this was a perfect connection but the restoration was something for us if if there is any bondage in your life God wants to to restore you back to a place of Freedom amen you don't have to get entangled again like this this was this was from Heaven I I know this was from heaven and I'm just grateful that God's servant got himself out of the way and allowed God to use him if it was for nobody else it was for me as I was sitting there and thought about uh a sickness that attacked my body some years ago and the reason and I felt I couldn't understand why this thing you know happened to me the way it is and I'm still uh fighting and struggling with it you know even today uh but what what happened I can clearly go back there was something going on in the church there was something happening in the church and um and I took it personal and when I took that personal then Satan had a way to start attacking my body so I learned amen I learned that uh you can't take it personal you have to just give it all to God and let God just handle it and you know not that you're not concerned but but you don't realize that the devil trying to when the devil's trying to wear you out you know what else he trying to do he trying to wear me out so we we heard last week what we're all connected right so so we got to understand Satan uses all of these little tactics and we have to be we have to be we got to be vigilant we got to understand what is going on here this is Attack on the whole body when one part of the body is hurting the rest of the body is hurting so it's so important church that we understand what what what what what's happening in a spiritual real I learned and in this point I just sat there I said Lord if there's anything from that experience that I'm holding that I might be harboring God I want to let that go because I want to experience your freedom your your will is is not for me to be ill and to be sick that's not God's will for me that's right that's right amen God's will is not for you to be sick his will is for us his will is for us to be in good health and to prosper even as our soul prospers I don't want to just take it as another sermon I said Lord if there's anything that I need to let go of I want to be restored back to my perfect health again that's what God had for me at the beginning and I came from somewhere I want to go back to it amen I believe the word of God is what sets us free I believe it and the word has come today to give us this Freedom let's walk in at church amen let's have a word of prayer father God you sent your servant here to speak and Lord I I I know for myself I have received God from Heaven to death day and Lord as I just did a just a a inventory and a reflection over my own life Lord just looking back at different things that triggered sickness Lord uh but the word kind of comes and helps us just to look at those things from a different angle and we can we can bring it to you Lord if there's anything in our hearts that we are harboring that we're holding on to God that we haven't uh released and just uh given true forgiveness to God deal with us in a way that we would do that because we realize uh the only thing that is hindered when we're holding on to things like that the only thing that's hindered is us and our bodies we're hindered Lord and our spiritual Walk we're hindered Lord in so many different ways we're hindered so God we want to really experience your freedom yes oh God we need that we heard that it's unlimited father the places that we can go in your Liberty and in your freedom and and Lord not only that when we as a bride come to a place of true freedom God everything else begins to follow so Lord let uh let let let healing begin to follow let let de Deliverance in our families begin to follow Lord let a joy amen begin to follow father may we see Restoration in our homes and Lord father in families Whatever It Is God we know everything will follow once we have come to this place of true Freedom father we thank you for the challenge that's been given to us Lord don't let it just go in one ear and out the other but let us Lord Jesus receive what you have spoken here today let us take time to reflect on this God bless your servant give back to him him as he has given out to us we trust that you would bless him 100 fold God continue to get Glory and Honor out of all that we do bless BL us as we leave this place but not your presence bring us back at the appointed
