for the the worship Amen brother uh Solomon leading and say is certainly good to have everybody back home amen I know many of the saints were away last um weekend various uh things happening but uh we thank God to see everybody back home and uh we did have a wonderful service on last week and you know just uh towards the uh praise the Lord um just towards the end you just felt an anointing uh coming into the room and um and I believe that anointing is still here today amen and and and and what we have learned to do is that when the angel is troubling the water then we know how to jump in amen so this morning I encourage you just jump in get everything God got for you um praise God as mom was saying this has been a real journey for us uh that started last year and still carrying over into this year and um you know and and I just feel like we are actually in the manifestation of what we're reading in the Bible I feel like we're living in it and uh you know and and and you know once you kind of catch where you are uh then it just it becomes more real to you amen so uh I I I got a couple scriptures that I want to read uh on today you all already know the Joel scriptures but here I'm going to read it I'm going to read it anywhere but I want to go to Revelation 18 after that uh and the reason I'm reading Joel is for those that may not be um aware what I'm reading in Joelle is actually a connection to what I read in Revelation 18 it's a connection to what I read last week in Luke 17 it's a connection to Malachi 4 now the theologians can't make that connection but because uh brother brandham told us that this book this will not be revealed to people that's just got ordinary amen uh understanding of the scripture and they compare verse by verse it says it's going to take a special group uh and he says this special group is going to be one that has to have prophetic insight and when you have prophetic Insight you can say things that the theologians can't say so Joel one 4 praise God this is why it's so important and people just pick up their Bibles and they look at oh Lord Jesus I can't even get started but when we pick up our Bibles you know there different manufacturers for Bibles and every manufacturer has uh pretty much gotten behind somebody that was smarter than them and they say we're going to put our name behind you because we trust what you have studied over the years you know your uh uh Amplified version was written by a sister there was some some people got behind this lady and say we you you seem to understand it better than us so we want to promote you and let her write what she thought the scripture meant and we go there to try to understand can I tell you another source that you can go to so you can understand go to the prophet read the message listen to the message because God sent it through a prophet all right I'm going to read some scriptures today and the only way we're going to understand this scripture is based on what a prophet has told us thank you Jesus all right that which the Palm worm have left hath uh um Locust eaten and that which the Locust ha eaten ha the cankerworm eaten and that which the cankerworm have left ha the caterpillar eaten uh chapter two uh really really quick I'll read 23 to 25 um be glad then you children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for Heath given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floors shall be full of wheat the floors shall be full of Wheat and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil I just believe we living in this amen and um and I will restore to you this is a personal uh thing I restore to you the years that the Locust hath eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the palmerworm my great Army which I sent among you all right Revelation 18 is where we will uh go to uh we'll pick up uh and as I said Joel 2 is connected to Revelation 18 amen um and uh we'll hopefully uh get to that today and uh verse one says and after these things now now there's a lot I can say and I'll just in input this after what things after we've seen this kker worm this Palmer worm this Locus and all I mean this this insect in multiple stages after these things right I saw another Angel come down from heaven glory to God having great power and the Earth was lightened with his glory all right and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon uh the great is Fallen it's fallen and has become the habitation of devils glory to God any devil feel comfortable there y'all know this the truth we talked about it last week it a habitation of devils when when you are ordaining people that ain't even living right one guy called himself a pastor and he also considered himself to be homosexual at the same time and he say he don't see no need to be delivered from his homosexuality who he going to Pastor praise the Lord uh the Bible says it's a habitation of devils all right right glory to God another Pastor feel I don't know if he felt led or what but to go to P Diddy parties a habitation of devil Devils all right amen let's just put it in the scripture so we know where we stand amen it says in in verse again it says he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the great is Fallen it's fallen and it's become the habitation of devils and a hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the Earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the Earth are wax Rich through the abundance of her Delicacies and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues let's pray father we thank you for uh the word of God as it has been read you Lord we thank you Father for this journey that you have us on we see you in scripture um and God when we can see you in scripture Lord it just settles our our hearts settles us in our Spirits we know God exactly where we stand because we stand on the word heavens and earth will pass away but God this word will never uh pass away it's the only sure Foundation I pray God that as we go through this thought today that Revelation would be brought uh to each and every heart God those that are here present those that are online Lord let Revelation uh be brought God we just give you glory and honor we take control of every spirit that's against the spirit of God and may you take control of this portion of the service in Jesus name we pray amen amen amen God bless you can be seated so we continue our our thought here through get back and step and um as I mentioned this is not just for us that are sitting here uh but we have a a number of people that watch Us online and you may not realize it but you actually help the people that are online amen now how how do you do that when you pull on the word it causes us to move in different directions and those directions are helping somebody else online thank you Jesus praise God Amen when you get to heaven one day and you see somebody like you know I now you know I never made it to your church but I watch you on video I saw you on video and and you encouraged me sometime just watching the way you praise God while the word was going forth it did something for me when I heard you sang a song it did something for me when you played that instrument it did something for me you have no idea what you did for me praise God so so what we do here is not just for us amen that the min goes beyond amen these four walls but um as we go back you know just thinking on some of the things that we've already been talking about and uh get back in step and um one of the prayers that was Prayed by the prophet I won't read the quote just I'm just going to read quote this prayer uh out of the message proven his word he said let the Bride As she starts getting out of Step from this and that may she come back into the step as the vision showed a few weeks ago now when when when I'm just you know bringing that before the church I I realize that somebody did get out of Step but they also got back into step because the vision showed that they were going to get back into step amen they can't they can't help it they have to get back in Step God God knew that these things would happen uh he sent this Army amongst us and uh but he also makes a way of Escape in the midst of it all so we we thank God we uh we were we were just mentioning on you know we've been uh a couple things that we've been mentioned we were talking of a um a statement out of the church age book where brother brandom said God's going to take the church back to Pentecost of the beginning amen he said also that uh uh when we look at the denominational church today um my brother was asking a question or yesterday when we had a ministers meeting and he asked a question about you know when we say that the church uh won't go I mean the church will go through the tribulation but the bride won't he said now he say the real Church won't go through the tribulation I say okay you're right you're right I said however when you're trying to separate church and bride uh what you need to do is kind of go back and look at the scripture in Revelation 2 and Revelation three the final statement to every age was he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit says unto the churches exactly pluralized so in every age we find that there is amen a true church and also a false Church yes sir we just not we not playing games we not trying to be just part of a church we want to be part of the true church because when you read in Revelation 2 and 3 for most of the ages there is a rebuke going Amen to the false church but then there is an encouragement happening to the true church but both of them are growing together hallelujah amen when you're driving down the street looking for a church to go till you got the question is this true or is this false hallelujah amen the only way you're going to know whether they're true or not is whether they taken and standing on the full word of God not just the parts that they agree with but we got to take we got to take the whole role so so so brother brandom you know says that you know when you're looking at the the true church and false church one thing that you will find with the false church is that they will out Shine the elect in effort and Zeal oh they got many programs they got this they got that they got this for the young people and that for this and I mean they got everything they got TV night and and bowling night and praise God hello somebody I mean some of these churches they their whole theme for the whole summer is movies and they get their inspiration from movies how you going to get inspiration from something the devil put out look y'all amen it's a it's a habitation of devils all right glory to God Amen it ain't nothing but the truth right and and when you get inside and you see how them Devils start operating people ain't been delivered from nothing I'm talking about a a man that's considered pastor of the church cursing like a saell it's a habitation of devils and they doing this all in the name of Jesus so so so so understand you got to catch these keys that the prophet is given say they outshine elect in effort and Zeal but it says it's Le thean is not of Christ for it looks for big crowds big programs startling signs amongst them they preach the second coming of Christ and and I was telling y'all you know everybody talk about we I I just want to preach Jesus this morning you know what I'm preaching I'm preaching Jesus when I'm preaching anything out of this word I'm preaching Jesus hallelujah amen and and and and don't get me wrong I love amen uh you know the the the about the the fish and five loaves of bread and I love all of that and I mean but but there's there's more in this scripture that's not the only thing Jesus did Hallelujah so we're trying to preach it all but here he says this he says they preach the the second coming of Christ but here's the problem but deny the Advent of the Prophet messenger and uh he says though in power and signs and true Revelation he eclipses them all now now now now when we talk about the Advent of the Prophet messenger we're simply saying it's the arrival of a notable person a notable thing or a notable event the arrival when we say Advent is the arrival and and I'm here to tell you that the prophet has come and gone and and and the scriptures that I'm reading to you have already been manifested what I what I read just read to you in Revelation 18 is not something that we're waiting to to happen it has already happen and people afraid of the Book of Revelation but don't even know many of these things have already occurred amen praise God now this Advent of the Prophet messenger where the Lord has just kind of led me to do here is just kind of take you through scripture by scripture by scripture to show you where God promised us a prophet we're not following this just to follow it now I I I I I mean we got to get Beyond that and and and some would say you just following a man oh I done heard that one before I wonder if they told the people in Paul's day the same thing that you just following a man and and you know what we got to be able to withstand them that type of criticism you know because Paul did make a statement somebody know the word in here Paul said follow me as I follow Christ and can I tell you something Paul was what we call a book in messenger Hallelujah somebody if you got books on the Shelf amen you need to put book ends and the book ends is what holds it all together so you need a book in on the front and don't put your book in in the middle because they ain't going to hold it all together everything after the book in will fall off the shelf come on somebody so I got to put a book in on the front then I got to put a book in on the back and Paul being a book in Messenger to the age of Ephesus my God my God my [Music] God I can't help me Lord but but him being a booking Messenger to the age of Ephesus he made certain statements that that only Paul could make he said if a angel from heaven come and preach something different different than what I preach let the angel be a curse that's a strong statement from a man praise God I got some things I need to share here today but but he was a book in Messenger on the front side but brother Brandon becomes the bookend Messenger to hold it all together on the on the on the inside he's the end time messenger thus we follow an end time message and the end time messenger preach the same thing the same thing the first book in messenger preach ain't nothing different it's just a restoration back to what Paul preached so we walk you through Malachi 4 God used that scripture to promise this Revelation 3:14 Revelation 10:7 last week we talked St Luke 17 um um 26 let me just quickly read that again and um St Luke 17 uh 26 we we read and we just brought out few things that we can look for here in the end time uh and then then today I want to go to Revelation 18:4 all all of these scriptures are scriptures that that that pertain to where we're living amen uh St Luke 17:26 these are the words of Jesus as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man and these are this is Jesus in his prophetic Ministry uh he's prophesying about what will happen and um so he tells us that they did eat they drank they married wives so that that that means marriages were going to be attacked and we have a lot of marriage and divorce situations happening praise God now and we need to know the word of God we need to know the word of God in in God's word he say he hate divorce that's what God Said in Malachi he hated but the we there's going to be an attack on marriages now young people uh that will you know someday get married understand understand there is a spirit that comes against marriages so you got to do everything you can to be able to withstand that devil you need good training you need Good Counsel you need all of those things and put it to action cuz there is a spirit that comes against marriages Jesus said it's going to be here okay now uh and then what happens when people get to the point hello uh that U you know I know I know young young people that might have watched struggle in their family you know and in the marriages in their family they get impacted by that right and uh and then you get young people that want don't want to commit themselves to a marriage vow because of what their parents went through praise God and rather than commit themselves to a marriage vow now they step into this next part of scripture Hallelujah they were giv in marriage that mean they living together and they're not married and let me just make it very clear that is sin Hallelujah that is against God's word the Bible says marriage is Honorable and the bed is undefiled you doing married things and you ain't married amen repent hello They Don't Preach it that way no more in church but it's a truth anyhow and we reading it right out of the Bible glory to God don't let nobody tell you what you should try it out first no you should pray first amen before you and don't hell good God Almighty sisters don't be that free with no boy he ain't he ain't putting he ain't gave gave you no ring he ain't done nothing he ain't no commitment from him at all and you and you giving out free samples no hello somebody I'm trying to get somewhere don't you be giving out no free samples to some young man praise God and even after you engage don't be giving him no free samples you know the first kiss come when you get down the aisle and the preacher say you may kiss the bride hello somebody all right it's the truth anyhow look I'm I'm trying to help you prevent yourself from a lot of uh trouble you don't have to carry baggage into your marriage all kind of thoughts and ideas praise God memories [Music] yes sir that's right in scars you ain't got to have all that going into your marriage hello somebody oh Lord [Applause] Jesus glory to God Amen yeah brother brother digs the one told us about that if if if if you stand out in the in in the uh food cour with a tray of free samples they preaching to me now Lord but it's the truth in high how many of y'all done walk by and got a free sample and did not buy nothing and that's exactly what some young man will do to you young lady he'll take your free sample and not give you no type of commitment and you be sitting around to I thought he loved me no that boy didn't love you because he bought you a lollipop that boy did not love you amen praise God strengthen yourself in the word of God so can't nobody just run over you like that know who you are in Christ I'm fearfully and wonderfully made now you ain't coming around here like that glory to God amen Amen Let me let I'm verse 27 I think I'm I'm at they did eat they drink they marit wise they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and and here's now here's the here's the thing they they they were given in marriage they married wives so the marriage and divorce issue living with people not being married to them they did that until the day Noah entered into the ark they did now so that mean there's some people ain't going to break the cycle even though they've heard the truth they continue to do exactly what they want to do and you'll pay for it so you're going to be judged by what you hear so it's important for me to share with you the truth and the Bible tells that you'll know the truth and the truth will it'll make you free look at this he says until the day that Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all it says this likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat so you comfortable having a uh a a partner or even just somebody but you know we don't do nothing together we no ain't nothing like that they just live here you comfortable with that I don't want to be nowhere where there's no Devils that could jump off on me don't tell me that devil won't jump off on you amen you get into certain environments I don't care how Holy Ghost fill you are you get you hang around certain environments there are spirits in those environments that will attack you I I I can be my own witness I I have been attacked by demons you sitting there thinking what what what is going on in here what I was just sitting in the room one time and this guy's just sitting there I'm like man something is there's a spirit in this room why am I feeling this spirit and this guy he look he looked very normal but it was a spirit coming off of this guy I said nuh uhuh I can't I can't have no more meetings with him there's something wrong with this guy spirits will attack you you were not born that way no God you you can't tell me that when you were born and they announced uh your sex they they knew it was pretty easy to know whether it was a boy or a girl it was very easy and you you didn't come out you didn't even know how to talk then you could not tell nobody what I feel like no we we going by what you we this is what you are and and God made it very simple this is what this is the anatomy of a of a boy this is the anatomy of a girl so what happens that a spirit attacks you at some point in time oh God it come through television yes and and nowadays it don't even have to television you can just on your phone on social media some of the the the the the advertisement that they put in social media it is pouring in social media yes it is that's true and you got you got to catch yourself like oh Lord I was not looking for that the devil would just throw it at you just like that it used to be you had to pay for things like that now it's all free and your get all bogged up with this type of stuff it's a spirit attacking you I want to give you the word of God because we know these things against the word of God but yet we will see it in our day that's why I going to take the Holy Ghost to be able to withstand this amen look at this now uh verse 28 says likewise as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they brought they sold they planted they build it but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rain uh fire and brimstone from heaven and Destroy them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed now that part is so important yes sir even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed let us read a few quotes Amen on that uh I'm going to go to the message called out but um just re just just kind of remind you cuz um um even though we see all these negative things happening uh when I want to say negative I'm saying things against the word of God we see uh the marriage and divorce issue we see the overabundance of eating drinking we see uh uh uh homosexuality uh and and let me put it this way cuz the I think the numbers on people that are homosexual it's probably like less than 10% of our nation it's way less than 10% however it just seems like they got more power than all the other 85% or whatever it is or 90% it is uh 95% they got more power because that that Spirit again has been released in this day and we need to understand that that's what that's what Jesus promis will come now in the midst of all of that don't don't don't don't get your eyes completely on that because while lot in the days of lot uh uh these was that that was happening God was also revealing things to Abraham in the tent and there was a messenger that stayed with Abraham revealing certain things to him Hallelujah that's where we find ourselves amen we're in that group where God is revealing things to us while the rest of the world is going on in sin all right glory to God Amen like mama said I knew this was it when when it came to me when it found me I knew this was it I was looking for else amen praise God now now now now um so what happened with with Abraham he's uh God himself is there revealing the secrets what's happening in the tent uh behind Abraham and I read y'all the quote how brother brandom my God God used him in the same manner here where he turned his back to the audience and he revealing the secrets we s we saw it manifested right before our very eyes and look at this now he made a statement here in the message called out this is 1958 he says Jesus said when the son of man is revealed from heaven right Jesus said when the son of man was revealed from Heaven he says uh let me close by saying this the son the son of man is now being revealed from heaven so here in his ministry uh this scripture that we just read about uh uh uh the days of lot the days of Noah what brother saying that is actually taking place right now oh my this ain't a future tense scripture this is actually a past tense scripture he he says he say he says um let me close by saying this that the son of man is now being revealed from heaven will it come after a while brother brandom it is now he says and I hope I won't have to make this so personal of this on meeting but that your spirit within you that's give you by God can read what I'm talking about look at it the son of man has already come from Glory Oh My My My and is revealing himself for the past few years to his church in Mercy yes sir Lord have mercy Jesus look at it he says showing them his great presence and even last week while we were reading the quote you felt the presence of God you felt the presence of God right here in this room that that is Christ on display manifest himself now amen I'm going on it says already come from glory and reveal himself for the past years to his church in Mercy showing them his great presence doing the same things that he did when he was here on Earth revealing himself like he did to Abraham before the destruction he has come now in Mercy revealing himself to the church it's being being laughed at and scoffed at the next time he reveals himself it'll be in judgment on the world and the Nations that's forgot God and send their send send their way uh uh their day of Grace rather away because they forgotten God and they're doing the same thing that they did to the angel of the Lord back there now what it says mocking and making fun of it but he shows shows now he but he's here now Mercy now now back in in lot's day um when when uh the angels went to to lot's house to try to get him and his family out I told yall lot actually had Sons down there Bible actually declared it lot had Sons down there and the sons did not come out they were just mocking right and and not only mocking but when you got people knocking on the door of Lot's house saying where them men that just came to visit you I mean can you imagine going into a neighborhood and the and the you just jumped out the car to go inside the house and there's somebody come knocking uh we want to get to know the one that just came up in your house brother that's bold that that's that's absolutely bold I mean these people ain't got no no morals anymore not at all right but but but but but here these Angel supernatural beings there trying to get lot out and and uh and and lot just lingering in it oh my God my God I don't know but I don't know if we got some Lots in here today God don't want you lingering in your sin God don't want you to keep making excuses for your sin you need to come out I I read the scripture for you out of Revelation 18 come out of her my people if you call yourself a child of God if you call yourself a daughter of God if you call yourself a Son of God come out of that right that's right walk out with everything you got you don't know when Jesus is coming you need to be ready for when Jesus comes Hall don't be this close to heaven and miss [Applause] it don't be that close to heaven and miss it no I mean come out of that you dwelling in a in a amen I mean I miss some unclean stuff that's right brother amen and God want to cleanse you up God wants to use you but he can't he can't use you like that amen we sometimes we compromise with these sins God don't want us to God going to judge sin yes he amen God going to judge sinen all right come on now let me let me let me keep reading here it says uh it's come now in Mercy reveal himself to the church it's being laughed and scoffed at uh the next time reveals itself it'll be judgment on the world and the Nations that's forgot God and send send their way uh send send their day of Grace rather away because they have forgotten God he says and they're doing the same thing that they did to the angel of the Lord back there're mocking making fun of it but he's here now in Mercy he will come in judgment upon the Nations and while he is being revealed in Mercy oh hurry ye hither glory to God Amen he says run run quickly and that's what the angel trying to tell lot he said he say I can't destroy until you actually come out my God get out of here get out of here get out of here uh uh uh uh lot you got to get out of here amen go ahead and get him praise God thank you DEA I thought he was going to come this way praise God it's all right and I know I know how the sisters get something like that get the fly around yeah good we got him [Music] okay well we thank God for that one more devil going no sorry that had to happen like that but I I I I was I saw it flying early and I say oh man this not might not be a good good spot for you to be it's better for you to be outside but uh oh I'm sorry amen that's my eulogy run quickly children get away from these man-made B bonian theological walls of unbelief and co- formalism run away from man-made theology get out in the middle of the field in God's grace and and there scream for Mercy for it is in his blood for it is his blood of his own son that gives Mercy to us get away from this old world of doubt listen to this now get away from your superstitions accept God's message of mercy and his message of Deliverance and flee to the middle of his grace and there scream oh Jesus thou Son of God have mercy on me for the walls of these man-made doctrines is going to crumble and perish with the unbelieving world for they that believe not perish not I mean perish with those who believe not the world of of unbelief perish with those who believe not but righteous lot was taken out and so was Noah think of it while we pray just a moment so brother brandom is is is screaming to the people here in this message that called out to to leave this you know denominational walls of unbelief formalism and Theological walls of unbelief leave that get out of it run run with everything you got and and and and and when you hear a prophet screaming like that when you hear a prophet and and notice now he's he's saying this you can imagine he's reached the the the end of his message and he's letting out the scream right Hallelujah he's letting out the scream at the end of his message now I had this quote last week but we couldn't get to it the Holy Spirit just just stopped it but it I had to save it because it had to connect with this week oh Hallelujah because you if you can as I was reading that here's a prophet amen scaming out come out from this stuff come out I mean don't don't don't stay entangled with it hallelujah hallelujah because when he's reading I mean when he's when he's saying when when he's when he screaming come out he's actually fulfilling Revelation 18 and 4 hallu now let's go back and read this again oh blessed be the name of the Lord now it's one thing when amen just a preacher says this but it's a different thing when a prophet says it let's let's read what the scripture was telling here telling us in Revelation 18 and I I I just got um so much actually before we read let's go back to Revelation 17 because I want to pick up something here and then we'll come back to Revelation 18 oh Lord so much we already read Revelation 184 where the angel said come out of her my people come out of what come out of what Revelation 17 kind of gives us amen a little picture of what what what this Angel calling us calling us out of now Revelation 17 in the most churches nowadays most churches I'm going to say not even message churches most of the would identify that Revelation 17 is a direct fulfillment within the Catholic Church most people would actually agree this is the Catholic church right here in Revelation 17 let me let's read a little bit let's read a little bit that that that way to help us amen amen amen amen uh it says and there came one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vows and talked with me saying unto to me come hither I will show unto you the Judgment of the great that sth upon many Waters means you got a lot of people following her all right with whom the kings of the Earth have committed fornication amen and the inhabitants of the Earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication now let let's just let's try to break these things down so that we're not we're not overwhelmed by what we read in scripture a prophet helps us understand that spiritual fornication is when we going against God's word amen when we're holding to denominational Rags instead of Amen standing earnestly for the faith that was delivered to the Saints instead of going back and taking the word of God we hold on to a denominational rag let me go a little further with that I mean in denominations we have a hierarchy right Hallelujah we have a local pastor but that Pastor often times is subjected to a bishop hallelujah or a superintendent amen or a cardinal Hallelujah in the Catholic Church they all subjected to a pope praise God and whatever the pope say when it comes from him it goes all the way down to everybody else and and and and and I know amen and some of the other organizations like a pastor could be doing very well with his congregation and then he would go to a uh uh what they call that uh conference he'd go to a conference and the bishop would tell him I feel led to move you from this church to this other church and I'mma put my nephew into your church okay y'all know it's the truth and and the people will happen that they the leaders subject themselves to what that Bishop has said that's right they don't agree with what he said but they subject themselves they oh if I could just put it this way if I can just say it like this they following a [Music] man it ain't nothing but the truth right they following what a man said that man feel L of God and he do exactly what he want to do Church be thriving and they just move them just like that don't even care about the people don't even care it's it it become a political game and they know it's the truth but they'll sit there and give their time their energy everything to that every year when when the angel Lord is calling us out of it all right let me keep on let me keep on reading here it says um verse three says so he carried me away in the spirit in the wilderness and I saw a woman Upon A Scarlet colored Beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and 10 horns and the woman was AR raided in purple and scarlet color deck with gold and precious stones and Pearls having a golden cup in her hand full of Abominations and filthiness of her fornication and fornication they they they they have their own Creeds and dogmas rather than the word of God you can show them in the word where it's wrong and they're going to say no we're going to go what the bishop say no no no no no no no no the bishop ain't got no he can't judge me the bishop ain't got no heaven or no hell to put me in God is the one that's going to judge me so I'm going say what God say Amen brother brandom had to leave the leave the Baptist Den ation because they were trying to get him to do something that was against the word of God what was they trying to get him to do TR trying to get him to lay hands on a woman preach and anoint her he said no what the Bible say I suffer not a woman to teacher you suff Authority Paul Paul so now so this what we get now when when because Paul said that now we hear Paul what Paul wasn't married so since Paul deducing deducing deducing since Paul went married Paul was a woman hater no you a woman hater Paul was telling us the truth hello somebody oh y'all y'all ain't g y look look here why is it that when we get a lot of these ladies in the pull pit they start sounding like men acting like men I I can tell you what it is if you want me to tell you spiritual homosexuality am amen am cuz the church is a woman and you can't have a woman amen uh sewing seed in a in a woman you'll never bring anything to birth we we see it all wrong in the natural but what about in the spiritual hello somebody right amen amen glory to God so you know uh cuz I people well we don't never see no women behind your pullit you never will you actually never will praise God because because Paul told us the bookend messenger said that was wrong and you want to know where Paul got that from he went all the way back to the Garden of Eden and he saw how God uh orchestrated things after the fall and he and he said now uh Eve you G have to be subject to your husband from here on out so when a woman take the pull pit who are the subjects right it don't it never look right having a first man and you know that he don't even look right as a first man hello church we might as well preach these things but the reason that we don't have it because we want to do it exactly the way Paul said amen and the church has gotten away from scripture but what happens God sends a messenger with a message to call you back to scripture come out of that confusion come out of that you know I mean come out of that Babylonian confusion cuz that's what happened in Babylon they got confused I'm I'm going to talk about that in a second but but but we call God calls us out of that confusion to bring us back to the word this is why he said I will restore yeah sayth the Lord this is so much greater than just your money and your family this is your spiritual condition amen oh my God my God look at this verse uh four and the woman was arid in purple and scarlet color and Deck with gold and precious stones pearls having a golden cup in her hand full of Abominations and filthiness of her fornication and upon her forehead was a name written Miss mystery Babylon so she's it's confusing it's a mystery here right mystery Babylon the great but look at this one the mother amen of harlots and Abominations of the Earth let me just just just leave that right there just for a second I I I got to just talk to you we know the Catholic church is all over this scripture and and Revelation 17 speaks so much about the Catholic Church um it's I think when it's talking about them uh seven uh seven heels or what was it um my Lord Jesus they were sitting on um seven seven vows talk with me saying uh great hord that sit upon many Waters there was something about there was sitting oh okay seven heads and 10 horns uh I think later on the Scripture it even tell you how this is seven seven heels of mountains that it sit on and uh now there's a couple no two cities specifically that kind of sit on Seven heels one of them is Cincinnati Ohio Cincinnati Ohio uh they I mean you walk through it it's heels everywhere all all over that City when you're driving through but but but they didn't have the kind of power that what we read here in Revelation 17 where they can control the whole world Cincinnati don't now the IRS is there in Cincinnati but but they don't control the whole world right the other city that sit on Seven Hills is Rome and and and they do control the whole world so when you look at this scripture it's pertaining to Rome I'm I'm going just say some things y'all just bear with me mother of harlots these are this this is these are prostitutes these are these are these are uh uh women that give free samples me and my family went to Rome a few years ago for a little vacation and um you know as we were going on our cruise we had to leave we we we actually went to the Vatican we saw the riches and the wealth and everything that's there we we saw it with our own eyes I mean it's it's massive it's massive it's it's unbelievable uh what they have walking all through the little rooms and and everything we even get to the the little spot I don't know what's the name of that cine chapel and uh they got a a picture of of God uh touching the the finger of Adam on the on the ceiling and when they when you go in you can't take pictures and you can't and they just rushing everybody in like cattle just everybody in move to the middle of the floor move to the middle of floor now get out of here so the next group can get in and we all moving in there and and you got to move in real quick and my daughter uh Rebecca she like you know okay she just moving she just moving she and she moving so much that she moved out and forgot to look up all that time that we don't walked through all this and she didn't look up to see the actual picture ah you got and and now we can't go back into it again we got we I mean got to get another tour at another at at a later date but we but she got to live off our memory right but but but there was there was there was there was I mean I mean it was just it was just so much to to absorb there at the Vatican so much to absorb um as we're leaving the city going to our cruise ship we driving down the highway and we notice that uh on every exit there's a prostitute at the exit what is this every exit ex it every exit so when I started thinking about that said now wait a minute this place is the mother of harlots and I mean in the natural cuz the natural always tight the spiritual in the natural they had harlots all up and down the exits now let's look at the spiritual part of this the mother of harlots cuz most denominational churches what we call Protestant groups well we know Revelation 17 dealing with uh the Catholic church but according to Revelation 175 the Catholic Church got some daughters sir and and these daughters are what we call harlots she's the great but she got harlots which are daughters which is every other denominational church amen hallelujah anything that goes back to denominational stand versus standing on the word of God is against the word of God Amen Hallelujah I don't care if they do change the name cuz you know nowadays they done took the Baptist off their name oh they done took Baptist off and now they just got these generic names and you just think you're going to this generic church that's a mega church but they got Baptist Doctrine Oh My My My anything that'll go against the word of God is Antichrist sir let me keep reading Oh Glory to God uh I'm going to the quote now and why I'm against organized religion and this is where we we get back to Revelation 18 um here in a second oh my look at now look at brother brandom he makes a comment here we're looking through a prophetic lens it says now look immediately after her sin her Secrets was discovered we've had we've had that a long time ago we know it now the next chapter look at Revelation 18 says may I just turn to it just a minute it might be a good thing it won't take us but just a few minutes longer and it might mean a little something to you I hope it does it says now um we see here in the 17th chapter the fifth verse so he he's going back to what we just read it says uh upon her forehead was the name written mystery Babylon the great the mother of harlot's the abomination of the earth and watched and I saw the woman which is the church drunk with the blood of the Saints and with the blood of the martyrs so that's if you would have kept if we' have kept reading verse 6 you would have saw that there he says blood of the martyrs of Jesus when I saw her I wondered with great ad admiration see seeing her she was such a great beautiful thing and she was the mother of prostitutes prostitute religion now see that that take it a little deeper your religion is a prostitute Hallelujah now ain't too many men that would want to marry a prostitute is the truth in high amen I know in in Hosea he was told a mared prostitute but ain't too many men you know now now let me just tell you Hosea had to be told by God to do that cu the average man ain't going to ain't going to marry a prostitute praise God hallelujah amen the average woman don't even want her girl hanging with prostitutes why because Spirits get off on you and if your daughter hanging with the prostitute next thing you know your daughter might become a prostitute and the average woman don't want her daughter to have that type of reputation that's in the natural sir why is it so why we feel so comfortable hanging spiritually with prostitutes I'm just reading the Bible I'm going a little further glory to God see this is a come out of her moment glory to God but I have to preach in a way you realize where you at is not good you got to come out and God is God is actually making a way of Escape for you to get out of that amen all right let me go on he says uh and I saw the woman Church drunk with the blood of saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus when I saw I wondered with great admiration see seeing her such a great beautiful thing and she was the mother of prostitutes prostitute religion denominations exactly what she did see because they injected dogmas just like she did now look at the revelations now that's the 17th chapter ends up with the 18th verse now watch and um uh and now he he he is coming into uh Revelation 18 and he's making a state he says after these things that's Revelation 18:1 after these things after her mystery was discovered after we understood what Revelation 17 was all about after her mystery was discovered after these things I saw another Angel come down from heaven having great power let's go on now here comes another messenger coming down next chapter all right Revelation 181 here comes another messenger coming down next chapter her mystery was discovered Revelation 17 her Mysteries discovered Revelation 18 are angels coming down because a Mysteries been discovered now let me tell you something before brother brandom preached that the the Catholic church was in Revelation 17 there was people preaching that for years before brother Brandon preached it that was no that was no new uh startling Revelation most denominational churches understood that most of them understood now whether they still agree with it or not they they understood and they were preaching that by themselves but notice the the Fulfillment of scripture after this has been made known who Revelation 17 is God sends down a messenger that's right oh glory to God watch it now watch it watch it now even though they they could preach it there you go sis they could preach it but not realize they were still in [Music] it I can't tell you to come out if I ain't out I can't be in telling you to come out I got to actually be on the outside telling you to come out amen amen amen let's let's let's let's let's keep reading here it says uh here comes the messenger here comes another messenger coming down next chapter her mystery was discovered now this is this is now the discovery of a mystery and her children's mystery oh look at that who she is and who her children is who are children the denominational churches now now now I can make it very plain because I don't want to go nobody h Luther came out of the Catholic Church nailed his 95 thesis to the wall he saw things that were afterward and he came out the problem was is that the people that followed Luther created another denomination Wesley came out of Luther he saw all the fallacies and what Luther then was doing he said no no it's it's going to take some sanctification you just can't no you going have to live better than that right he he said he said no no it's going to be more so he saw that but after Wesley left guess what happened the people that followed Wesley out created another denomination that was the Methodist church Lutheran Church Methodist Church I'm giving you a little history and then what happened after that the Pentecost was come along say no uhuh no we can't no we want to see the gifts restored back to we want justification we want sanctification we want the gifts back in the church they start praying God visited them on ausa Street Reed Pentecostal church was birth the gifts were back in the church they came out and left that only problem was they denominated and when they denominated got left what it happened then the word came forth and if you will notice in this whole journey on uh get back and step I'm spending more time on the fourth stage than I did on the other stages because um this is the stage that we're at this is where the word has come to set us free amen amen oh my God my God my God and let me tell you something about this word that we have now it will never be denominated amen amen I might as well be honest with you I've seen many try to rise up and create a denomination every time they do it you just give it a few years it falls apart I'm seeing it time and time and time again Hallelujah we get these these preachers where it's us for no more if you ain't preaching what I preach then you can't preach you get that yeah you get that type of spirit and and and some some of the younger ministers nowadays we don't recognize that and we don't want to be a part of us for no more if you keep inviting me all the time on who are other ministers you know that you can get to come here praise the Lord amen cuz we don't want that type of spirit we don't want to be associated with that Oh Glory to God church I'm I'm trying to get I'm trying to get here I got a few things to just just share and uh I'm I'm coming home I promise you look at this what he says now it says um her mystery was discovered now this is now discovery of mystery and her children's mystery so you understand now exactly what made her a harlot because she committed adultery against God's word and that's what made her an organization she couldn't stay a bible church and accept that right and neither can any organization that don't take every word of it amen the way is wrote I'm telling you as soon as you see a woman preacher walk up you already know they off the word ain't no sense even trying to figure out is this where God lead me no God ain't leading you there no God ain't LED you there you still homos get up in the pullit and start God didn't lead you there I'm going just be I you know we got to stop putting things on God yes God God God God Made You In His Image in his likeness so you got to be able to make some decisions based on his word let me keep reading I'm I'm coming I'm coming uh he says um she couldn't stay a bible church and accept that neither can any organization that don't take every word of it the way it's wrote ever be a bible church and there's none of them that way that I know nothing that I know anything about not a one so there she as soon as she organizes the things she does both by scripture and by evidence she dies right there she accepts the Dogma now look now now that's what happened now look at this God sent in this 18th chapter a mighty angel sir after that mystery was known a mighty angel or a messenger watch here now he's reading Revelation 181 and4 let's let's go back and read Revelation 18 1-4 we'll catch it right here actually you know what leave the quote there he he's I just I'm just telling you what he's reading if you want to follow in your Bible you can but he's reading Revelation 181 1-4 it says this after these things and and I like to read it because brother brandom also gives us his commentary while we're reading it glory to God after these things I saw another Angel come down from heaven with great power and the Earth was lightened by his glory and he cried with a loud voice Babylon confusion the great is fallen and become the habitation of devils the hold of every foul Spirit and the cage of every unclean and and unclean and hateful bird and All Nations have drunk of the wine and the wrath of a fornication and the and the kings of the Earth Earth committed uh fornication with her and the merchants of the Earth was was wax was wax Rich through the abundance of her de uh uh her desence it says look immediately after mystery was made known who she was what she was who her daughters was the mystery has been made known then God sent an angel Messenger to to what call out God sends a messenger to call out and look at what the messenger say come out oh my my my my come out the message of the hour this message that we're following was a message to call us out of that condition I want to tell you something there was John in the Book of Revelation he recorded some of these come outs in uh Noah's day a prophet was sent with a message come in that's right come into the Ark in the Book of Revelation we got a prophet sent with a message come out and I want to tell you something after the church ages have come to en close and we go back to Revelation 4 there will be a voice that will scream out to this group come up in Noah's day they could not hear come in today there are people that can't hear come out and if you cannot hear come out you will never hear come up you have to be able to hear come out in Revelation 18 before you can hear come up in Revelation 4 hallelujah amen amen I want to tell you this is not the voice of brother brandom that's that is calling for you to come out that's right according to scripture God sends a prophet with a message to call you out whose message is it is it brother Brandon's message or is it the message of the Lord Jesus Jesus said my sheep hear my voice and a stranger they won't follow you just have to recognize how he is speaking Hallelujah but it's still his voice oh I trust you can hear it come out I trust you can hear it look at it this this is a scripture not we're waiting to be fulfilled already been fulfilled and it's brother Brandon's message that actually fulfills it yes sir look at it let me go on oh my my my uh he says look immediately after her mystery was made known who she was what she was who are daughters was the mystery has been made known then God sent an angel Messenger to what call out come out the message of the Hour come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her plagues he's going to curse her Watch come out of her God sent a mighty angel or messenger and his light wasn't in a corner it scattered over the Earth come out of her what her and her sisters too he actually mean her daughters to lighten the Earth call the people out of her now you know that's the truth a messenger was sent from heaven to call God's people out of Babylon and his light lighted the Earth great Holy Spirit now you know I'mma just I'm I'm I'm I'mma say something here this uh when he say that his message lighted the Earth God gave brother brandom a Ministry that went seven times around the world I mentioned to you all how I had a friend of mine just he just couldn't get it like you were in Australia and you live in West Palm Beach how you get all the way to Australia who you know in Australia me on the other side of the world and not only you go to Australia but after you leave Australia you end up in Philippines I need to know what's going on well start telling him about this message that actually went seven times around the world and this message is what has connected us and like I told the Saints in the Philippines the message took me to Australia the message took me to Canada the message took me to Georgia the message took me to

message took me to the Philippines sir and the message can take me to all them places this message can also take me to [Applause] Heaven I would have never gone to none of them places if it had not been for this reveal word I heard that angel speak come out right and I came I don't want to be too bold but I'm happy I left amen oh Lord at 3777 J wrote I'm happy I left am amen it's not a building that make the church it's the people that make the church H you see Babylon represented confusion we see it in the beginning of the scripture there with Nimrod and his Tower Babel Babylon is found in the middle of the scripture we see that where Daniel and the Hebrew boys were actually down in Babylon and had to take a stand Daniel had to take his stand in Babylon hello somebody the Hebrew boys had to take their stand in Babylon them Hebrew Hebrew boys are being threatened with fire you're going to be burned you going this this going to happen but them boys took a stand and they they said they said look look look look look here this what we understand we know our God is able to deliver us but if he don't am that's amen and sometime he choose not to but if he don't we ain't going down we we we going down in history with it written that we never bowed Hallelujah to your image now I'm going to go a little further you know the Hebrew boys was actually being asked to bow to the image of Daniel right and in this message there's people trying to get us to bow to the image of brother Brandon amen amen let me tell you something I might as well say this right now you you can't tell me that this not a message church because we don't have the picture of the Prophet hanging in our church you want to know what make this a message church not no picture what making a message church is when you listen to the word that is being preached here pictures don't do it [Applause] amen amen but Babylon Babylonian confusion in the days of Daniel and the and and the Hebrew boys B Babylonian confusion in the days of nimrod and then at the end of the scripture we see God calling the people out of Babylon once again we got to hear that voice calling us out and I want let me let me let me let me let me let me I'm going to skip uh a little something here uh my God my God no let me let me say this when we was reading this about um in Revelation 18 that they was in ver verse two and he cried mightly with a strong voice saying Babylon the greatest Fallen is fallen and is become the habitation of devils and a hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird brother brandom gives us something that uh many of us can identify with because we happen to be people that were in that cage some of us come from these cage of unclean and and hateful Birds hate the message and people actually hate it and hate you following the message but we were in a cage like that once and brother brandom told us what happened is that we didn't realize we was a different type of bird in the cage hello somebody he call it a a chicken cou but we didn't realize we Wen we was we was we was never chicken we were we were born in that condition but we was never that Hallelujah and say say he say he said what happens is chicken is down there Amen in the CP with the chickens and and he think you're a chicken but it just don't look like a chicken he don't feel like a chicken he don't act like a chicken but they trying to make him act like a chicken and it say so he's there and you know and and and and and and when the chicken start eating certain things he like I can't eat this spiritually I can't eat this with they eatting this stuff don't taste good to me I'm I'm about to throw up after I eat this type of stuff you say he he he say say you you you you you you you a special bird my God a an elect bird sitting inside this cage of unclean Birds am but one day what happens is that uh there's another bird that you hear coming by flying way up in the air and like wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute now and something in you connect with a bird that's flying by and like now n i chickens can't fly but I feel like I can fly I feel like I belong up there hello somebody now the only way you going to get up there you got to come out of here come on church on you got to be willing to leave your situation if you want to get up where the Eagles are flying the eagle mother eagle flying over she knew she had lost one of her eggs and didn't know where it was but she come flying over the chicken coop oh my when she come flying over that chicken coop all of a sudden she let out a scream oh I like it I like it brother Joe she say she let out a scream and and before you know that that little chicken on I mean the little Eagle on the inside the CP or Inside the Cage he' say say she talking my kind of language she's speaking directly to me the other chickens can't hear what I'm hearing they can't respond the way I can respond but I need to go where she's at amen they begin to communicate back and forth say you know what I I don't know what to do down here they they told me I couldn't fly that we not born to fly said no no you've been born you born to fly what you going have to do is is is is get rid of chicken thinking and you got to let nature take its course hello somebody and maybe mama say now just stretch Them Wings out and just just let it just just just just just work with him just a little bit Hallelujah just work with him just a little bit and before you know it when you take off the wind going to catch you amen and you'll be right where I'm at but you got to be willing to leave you got to be willing to come out because when Mama Eagle was coming by she was screaming come out amen amen thank you Lord let me give you thank you I'm going down to paragraph uh 218 but before I do that I want to just I want to leave you a a scripture I I'm I'm telling you Revelation 18 after these things after after the mystery of of who the Catholic church is and who her daughters are she's the mother of harlots who her daughters are you know after that's been made known God sends an angel down with a message to come out that message is calling us out and it's calling us out to bring us back to the word amen I'm looking you might be looking at that like well brother Jack how can you say that this is this angel that God is sending down verse verse 4 Revelation 18:4 I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people that you be uh be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues uh how can you say this angel that was sitting down in verse one is a man I want to give you Galatians 4:14 these little keys to help you in your Bible Galatians 4 and 14 this is Paul writing in the book of Galatians and he says this and my Temptations which was in my flesh ye despise not nor reject it but receive received me Paul's a man Paul's a bookend Messenger right Paul writes in his in his own letter you receive me as an angel of God even as Christ Jesus so if Paul can call himself an angel a man on the earth an angel then we can also see the same thing for the book in messenger a man that has come down from God to the Earth as an angel amen Revelation 3:14 called him an angel yes sir Revelation 10:7 called him an angel Revelation 18 is calling him an angel amen amen let me just give you one more quote I'mma y'all I'mma tell y'all my secret I usually try not to preach over hour and 15 minutes to y'all that's my secret and the reason I do that because um there is so much here you cannot get it all in one setting now I've already gone over my time but y'all y'all gave me Freedom last week and the week before to just keep preaching y'all told me that but but I'm always mindful I I we've had preachers I was telling somebody I had a preacher come here I had a couple preachers come and they came on a Friday night Friday night Friday night we all tired we woke out and the pre preacher came and he preached 3 hours I think they only came [Applause] once let's read I'm in paragraph 218 okay now when when I'm when I'm reading this paragraph I'm I'm actually uh I'm actually looking at Revelation 181 where it says that this this a the he had he having great p uh and and after these things I saw another Angel come down from heaven having great power and the Earth was lighten with his glory now let's look at this in Revelation uh in in this in this message why I'm not why why I'm against organized religion notice this is the angel of Light remember the last Angel is the angel in the church age to the L de sea now when he makes that comment that connects it to Revelation 3:14 also connects it to Revelation 107 okay he not just making these comments they're connected to scriptures all right it says it's the layer to see a messenger it's the last because the very next chapter is the 19th Chapter which is the coming bride and this is in the scripture the last angel that came to bring light before the coming of the Bride oh this is beautiful to me before the coming of the Bride to meet Christ it was the lean Church H then what was the Ley in church age messenger calling them out of Babylon look at this now look churches caught in her cage with her with her dogmas denying the word and accepting dogmas see and this why when people say you think just the people in the message now look I'm just going to be honest with you you can't be in a cage full of unclean birds and think you're going to be clean man amen church is caught in her cage with her with her dogmas denying the word and accepting dogmas this is the angel of Light to the Lan church that had rejected Christ and his word for Dogma I mean for dogma and that put him on out put him outside and he stood at the door knocking trying to get in see see it the church age had rejected the Christ and Christ is the word and had uh and and and and and had rejected outside he was on the outside the only church age that we have of Christ on the outside knocking trying to get in and this Angel's message messenger come from God was echoing his message on the earth to come out of Babylon exactly what we just read in Revelation 18:4 come out of the organization look at this now the Holy Spirit today cuz see brother brandham is gone his ministry is already done but yet he did exactly what God wanted him to do he came with the message to call us out of Babylon amen amen look at this now it says but the Holy Spirit today oh my my my the manifestation of the holy spirit is that angel trying to get the people back to the word because the holy spirit will only vindicate the word what is this what is what what are we saying here as we continue to preach this message as we continue to Echo what the prophet said the Holy Spirit today my God my God is that angel still manifesting Revelation 18:4 and it's through this message that we're preaching today we're still saying it again come out of her amen come out of her my people you know I mean no brother brand not here but his message is still here and we're echoing what that Prophet said and we're still calling the holy spirit is calling amen come out oh they were calling in noise they come in come in come in but today we calling come out come out come out and Jesus wants to call come up come up amen yes sir come up but if you can't hear the voice to come out like that little chicken I mean little Eagle amongst them chickens couldn't hear the voice to come out you'll never hear the voice come up when that little eag heard mama say put them Wings together just put them together and you can fly out of that now you can get out of that now but you just got to use what God gave you come on out rise above that chicken coop yes amen you know what when that eagle heard come out from Mama the eagle also heard but you can't hear come up unless you can hear the Holy Spirit today the manifestation of the holy spirit is that angel trying to get the people back to the word because the holy spirit will only vindicate the word it it can't vindicate dogmas there's no life in them he's life which is Christ notice the latan church age had denied him rejected him and put him on the outside that quote is actually telling us what happened in scripture all you got to do is pick up your Bible in Revelation three and you'll see exactly what brother brandom just said he helps us clarify what the scriptures saying am and you say why I read the quote because it helped me clarify what the scripture was saying hello somebody amen Revelation 18:4 has already been fulfilled I hope you can hear the voice come out of her my people come out cuz one day there's going to be a voice in Revelation 184 And1 come up hither and that's a Rapture voice we all want to hear that voice let's pray father we thank you for the word we thank you for truth thank you God that you could Minister
