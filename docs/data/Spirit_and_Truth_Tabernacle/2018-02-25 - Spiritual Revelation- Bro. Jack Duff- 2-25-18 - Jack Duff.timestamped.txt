[54:29] okay as a church we were usually in turn
[54:34] two amen this time of fasting for 21
[54:38] days just before instead think will be
[54:40] breaking the fast right and Good Friday
[54:45] so we we've you know just something that
[54:48] ice I heard about some years ago and
[54:50] just started doing it and you know
[54:53] typically it's fasting fasting typically
[54:56] involves the food and things of that
[54:58] nature but then you fast it does allow
[55:00] you to eat it just you don't eat what
[55:03] you normally eat right and it's no meats
[55:06] no sweets and you don't drink anything
[55:10] but water for 21 days and I tell you
[55:13] what it does your body real good to go
[55:15] through a cleansing like that but but
[55:19] most more importantly is just
[55:21] spiritually we're trying to draw closer
[55:23] to the Lord and now there are you know a
[55:26] number of ways to think through that
[55:27] time will be you know having our home
[55:29] our weekly prayers and things that
[55:31] nature and often us a time if you just
[55:34] get something on your heart during that
[55:35] time of fasting prayer I believe God is
[55:37] able to answer your request a man I
[55:40] believe God is able to beat you and not
[55:42] only that we we live in a society today
[55:45] it's a man where you know back in the
[55:47] Bible days they fast it's probably just
[55:49] be food but today we have so many things
[55:51] we probably need to fast from you may
[55:53] not just food technology really get all
[55:56] footage right but uh but you know we ask
[56:00] that you know try to farm some things
[56:02] that you can just disconnect from some
[56:04] might not be able to do food a man
[56:07] because of health reasons but this
[56:10] actually does let you do food is just a
[56:12] special diet that we're going for 21
[56:13] days and
[56:15] you know but if you can fasten
[56:16] technology if you confess you know just
[56:19] a lot of things that just even games
[56:22] video games hello somebody right it's a
[56:26] lot of stuff we could Vance
[56:28] just 21 days just give it up actually
[56:30] you know what there's there's something
[56:31] that says if you do something but 21
[56:33] days typically it becomes a habit
[56:36] alright it can become a habit to you if
[56:39] you just if you get if you get it for 21
[56:41] days so it could be a habitual lifestyle
[56:44] you know some of us might go off our
[56:46] medication if we can change our volume
[56:49] well praise the Lord
[56:51] hey man I know I know we won't immediate
[56:53] healing God's able to do that we've seen
[56:55] them do it but sometimes God healed
[56:56] through just your diet
[56:59] hey man right but but there's a number
[57:02] of things a man that we could we could
[57:04] we could give up and and some of us free
[57:07] we see well you know what I'm gonna just
[57:08] give up technology but I'm gonna keep
[57:09] eating when I use that's what you did
[57:11] last year I want you to do something
[57:13] different this year
[57:14] a man church praise God we got to stop
[57:17] being weak Christians hello somebody hey
[57:21] BAM you know you know we got to be able
[57:24] to do something sometimes for the Lord
[57:26] so I want to encourage to church a man
[57:29] to to get involved in the Daniel fast
[57:31] will be starting on March 10th amen and
[57:34] kind of bringing it right up into right
[57:37] up until Easter time so just keep that
[57:40] in mind

[57:49] all good to have sus to come back on a
[57:51] horn a man Lord touch our body a man
[57:56] good to have it back at the clarinet a
[57:58] man so I'm gonna read two scriptures and
[58:04] there is a number of different
[58:06] directions that we can go here today but
[58:09] I'm just praying that God would just
[58:10] direct us a man and and and and how we
[58:13] bring this out but I want to read from
[58:16] first Corinthians chapter 12 and also
[58:19] Matthew 16 a man god bless you everyone
[58:22] standing that can of stand as we read
[58:24] the word
[58:25] the Lord amen 1st Corinthians chapter 12
[58:30] just reading one verse from here a man
[58:33] that will be verse 3
[58:45] and it reads as as follows it says
[58:48] wherefore I give you to understand that
[58:51] no man speaking by the Spirit of God
[58:54] calleth jesus accursed and that no man
[58:58] can say that jesus is the lord but by
[59:02] the holy ghost and man no man called
[59:05] them jesus Kurtz and no man say that
[59:08] Jesus is the lord but by the holy ghost
[59:11] turn with me also that the Matthew 16
[59:14] very familiar passage
[59:28] glory to God
[59:31] oh god help us a man Matthew 16 starting
[59:37] to verse 13 Jesus came into the coasts
[59:41] of Caesarea Philippi the yaksas
[59:45] disciples saying whom do men say that I
[59:48] the Son of Man and they said some say
[59:52] that thou art John the Baptist some
[59:53] Elijah and others Jeremiah or one of the
[59:56] prophets you saith unto them but whom
[59:59] say ye that I am and Simon Peter
[1:00:05] answered and said thou art the Christ
[1:00:07] the Son of the Living God and jesus
[1:00:10] answered and said unto him blessed art
[1:00:13] thou simon barjona the flesh and blood
[1:00:16] have not revealed it unto thee but my
[1:00:19] father which is in heaven and I say also
[1:00:22] unto thee that thou art Peter and upon
[1:00:26] this rock I will build my church and the
[1:00:31] gates of Hell shall not prevail against
[1:00:34] him and I will give unto thee the keys
[1:00:37] of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever
[1:00:40] thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound
[1:00:42] in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt
[1:00:45] loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
[1:00:47] then charge Lea's disciples that they
[1:00:50] should tell no man that he was Jesus the
[1:00:53] Christ a man the Lord had a blessing to
[1:00:56] the reading of his word let's just bow
[1:00:58] and a brief word of Prayer father we are
[1:01:03] certainly appreciative of the
[1:01:06] opportunity we have to read the word God
[1:01:10] I'm praying that it would it would that
[1:01:15] your spirit would make the work clear to
[1:01:19] us it is important Lord that we catch
[1:01:25] what the Holy Spirit is trying to say to
[1:01:27] us in this hour things are happening
[1:01:30] very fast and God if we're not spiritual
[1:01:34] we will miss what is going on so Lord my
[1:01:40] prayer is that you'd help us all to get
[1:01:41] out of the way
[1:01:43] help us to surrender our thoughts and
[1:01:46] that God you would just take complete
[1:01:48] control over this portion of the service
[1:01:51] we bind every spirit that is against the
[1:01:54] Spirit of God and we lose the Holy Ghost
[1:01:57] to have its way even right now in our
[1:02:00] midst this in Jesus name we pray amen
[1:02:02] amen you can be seated I took this title
[1:02:14] a number of years ago and and I'm I want
[1:02:17] to take it again it's titled spiritual
[1:02:21] revelation spiritual revelation and just
[1:02:26] bear with me that there's a lot here
[1:02:28] that that's in my heart and I want to
[1:02:31] try to slow down and get it all out if I
[1:02:34] can but just bear with me let's start
[1:02:38] with this quote a man out of the
[1:02:40] revelation of Jesus Christ and and I
[1:02:42] want you to just try to follow these
[1:02:44] words a man try to follow these words as
[1:02:48] I read them from God's prophet it's
[1:02:50] going to be important to you a man
[1:02:52] spiritually I'm in paragraph 13 - 4 and
[1:02:56] the revelation of Jesus Christ says the
[1:02:59] importance of revelation by the spirit
[1:03:03] to a true believer can never be over
[1:03:07] emphasized amen the importance of
[1:03:11] revelation by the spirit first of all
[1:03:16] you need to understand that revelation
[1:03:17] can only come by the spirit I can sit
[1:03:21] and talk with you til I'm blue in the
[1:03:23] face I could spend all night with you
[1:03:27] going from one verse to the next verse
[1:03:30] to the next verse from Genesis to
[1:03:32] Revelation I can try to show you Jesus
[1:03:35] right but but but you're not going to
[1:03:38] actually catch that until the Spirit of
[1:03:40] God gives it to you hallelujah
[1:03:43] if there's anything you should pray for
[1:03:46] it should be revelation right amen Revan
[1:03:50] and praying and asking God for a new car
[1:03:53] I know you need one rather than asking
[1:03:56] them for a new house
[1:03:57] I know you need one you might need an
[1:03:59] apartment rather than bringing and only
[1:04:02] asking god I want to use that word again
[1:04:05] only asking God for material blessings
[1:04:10] you need to stop and ask God for
[1:04:13] revelation extremely important that you
[1:04:17] get revelation and understanding as to
[1:04:21] who Christ is not who he whoops not who
[1:04:26] he will be but who he is right now you
[1:04:31] need to know who Jesus is
[1:04:34] come on somebody right right you know
[1:04:37] you know I was used to have this little
[1:04:40] this little thing amen and they still
[1:04:43] have it I'm just coming to my mind fresh
[1:04:46] this this guy Waldo and they would have
[1:04:51] this little picture a man on the on the
[1:04:55] front of the book and they would show
[1:04:56] you a picture of Waldo and where Aldo
[1:04:59] would have a maybe a red hat and his
[1:05:02] shoes would be black and then you have
[1:05:05] maybe a blue scarf right and there's
[1:05:08] some stripes on or something like that
[1:05:09] and then you have to turn the page and
[1:05:12] you got to find a man the guy in the in
[1:05:15] the midst of all this sea of people you
[1:05:18] got to find the guy with the red hat and
[1:05:20] the blue scarf a man in the strike zone
[1:05:23] and the black shoes because you get you
[1:05:26] start looking at these different men
[1:05:28] guys they look like Waldo but the only
[1:05:31] thing missing is that you know he don't
[1:05:33] have the blue scarf come on this one
[1:05:36] have a white scarf oh and if you got a
[1:05:38] white scarf on that's not Waldo huh that
[1:05:41] guy is imitating Waldo are you with me
[1:05:46] he's imitating Waldo but that's not
[1:05:49] Waldo you can't get your eyes focused on
[1:05:52] somebody
[1:05:53] imitating a man we want the real thing
[1:05:58] hey Lia and there's many churches better
[1:06:02] in the land that they ever pay
[1:06:05] Christianity but you not looking for
[1:06:09] imitation you want the real back
[1:06:11] somebody that's gonna tell you the truth
[1:06:14] whether hurt you I'm not their main
[1:06:19] focus is to get you to heaven but you
[1:06:23] got to you got to find Waldo right you
[1:06:27] got to find Waldo because there's many
[1:06:29] imitators out there and when you looking
[1:06:32] at you got to look real close if there's
[1:06:34] minute at a circle all going you're
[1:06:36] going you're circumcised Valle de right
[1:06:37] hand and then you look at it and you
[1:06:40] look at the front of the book and then
[1:06:41] you look at the big thing that's just
[1:06:42] circling Waldo but he's on the page he's
[1:06:48] on the page you just gotta find them he
[1:06:50] might be hiding behind something but you
[1:06:53] gotta find Waldo he might have one shoe
[1:06:56] out there but that good that black shoe
[1:06:58] that go that red hat that go that blue
[1:07:01] scarf that go this price there's Waldo
[1:07:04] and you know the deeper you get into the
[1:07:06] book the deeper you the more you keep
[1:07:12] turning the pages the harder it is to
[1:07:15] find Waldo seeing the first 13 it might
[1:07:19] have been easy in the second search
[1:07:21] ancient matter if it easy but when you
[1:07:23] get down to the seven church it become
[1:07:27] difficult to find Waldo but he's dead
[1:07:33] and you can't do the necklace but 3x god
[1:07:37] help me to find who Aldo is help me to
[1:07:41] find the truth because the Bible say you
[1:07:44] know the truth and the truth will make
[1:07:46] you free
[1:07:47] hallelujah but this happens through
[1:07:51] spiritual revelation the importance that
[1:07:54] I'm going back to the quote the
[1:07:55] importance of revelation by the spirit
[1:07:59] I mean mama can't explain this daddy
[1:08:03] can't explain this past the can't
[1:08:05] explain this but the Spirit of God can
[1:08:07] so the importance of revelation by the
[1:08:09] spirit to a true believer can never be
[1:08:13] over emphasized
[1:08:14] listen revelation means more to you than
[1:08:17] perhaps you
[1:08:18] realize now I am NOT talking about this
[1:08:22] book of Revelation and you I am talking
[1:08:24] about all revelation it is tremendously
[1:08:28] important to the church do you remember
[1:08:31] in Matthew 16 where Jesus asked the
[1:08:34] disciples this question who do men say
[1:08:36] that I the Son of Man am lord help us
[1:08:40] and then some say thou art John the
[1:08:43] Baptist some Elias and others Jeremias
[1:08:46] or one of the prophets now now now that
[1:08:48] what you need to get there is that there
[1:08:50] were many opinions in the land in that
[1:08:54] day as to who Jesus was and let me tell
[1:08:58] you this many opinions in the land today
[1:09:02] as the way is right now and how he is
[1:09:05] using his service
[1:09:07] yes God didn't use Billy Graham a great
[1:09:12] servant of God a man a mighty servant of
[1:09:15] God
[1:09:15] God used to me out of their unique
[1:09:18] ministry and I can point it out to you
[1:09:20] in the scripture how God used both Billy
[1:09:22] Graham and/or Roberts hallelujah the
[1:09:28] Prophet told us Oh Lord I'm oh I'm Way
[1:09:30] ahead of myself gods
[1:09:32] when the Prophet told us that you know
[1:09:34] when we look at the name Abraham his
[1:09:37] name was Abram and then it was changed
[1:09:40] to Abraham and what God did was give
[1:09:43] Abraham a part of his own name because
[1:09:46] he was hello him and he gave Abraham a
[1:09:50] part of his own name put some letters in
[1:09:52] Abraham's name it had to be pronounced
[1:09:55] different now no longer Abram but
[1:09:58] Abraham came of a partner's own name now
[1:10:02] he st. said now what happened back in
[1:10:04] that time in Abraham's time Abraham had
[1:10:07] a bit three visitors come down God and
[1:10:10] two angels and those two ages come down
[1:10:13] and they begin to fellowship with
[1:10:15] Abraham the fellowship was Herod and
[1:10:17] there they were sitting in inhabited a
[1:10:20] little meal at a tent there now first of
[1:10:23] all if you go back and read the Bible
[1:10:25] the chapter before his name was April
[1:10:29] and in this chapter with God steps in
[1:10:31] they have Abraham's tip he says we're
[1:10:34] sterile I wife because the chapter
[1:10:35] before her name was Surratt now how did
[1:10:39] this visitor with his back turn to the
[1:10:44] tip say where is Sarah not so right but
[1:10:48] Sarah I need you to understand they have
[1:10:52] not they have not either made it to the
[1:10:54] courthouse yet courthouse yet to get
[1:10:56] their name change
[1:11:00] however this visitor knew the name Sarah
[1:11:04] in the name Abraham because the visitor
[1:11:08] was none other than God himself in the
[1:11:12] flesh of man coming to visit Abraham and
[1:11:14] Sarah to make his promise come to pass
[1:11:16] today now you said but the two angels
[1:11:19] and him they sit in the godom two angel
[1:11:21] sitting there visiting talking and
[1:11:22] eating and and you know this is one of
[1:11:25] the reasons why praise the Lord I know
[1:11:26] in the Daniel fast will not gonna eat me
[1:11:28] but I'm not going to that kind of diet
[1:11:30] for the rest of my life I eat meat and
[1:11:34] the reason I eat meat because God ate
[1:11:37] meat he ain't meat he had a calf right
[1:11:44] they kill the calf and they fed that to
[1:11:46] God God ate meat hallelujah so I can eat
[1:11:50] meat hello somebody glory to God
[1:11:55] hey man but up but you know here here
[1:11:57] here they're sitting there and they're
[1:11:58] eating him and he begin to reveal the
[1:12:00] secrets and everything but but before
[1:12:02] you know he sit for two angels he stayed
[1:12:04] back with Abraham Oh God he stayed back
[1:12:07] with Abraham and then he sent the two
[1:12:09] angels over a man insane I ain't going
[1:12:11] down the Sodom and he'd been given
[1:12:13] revealed to Abraham what was getting
[1:12:15] ready to happen in Sodom before
[1:12:17] destruction came to Sodom somebody had a
[1:12:20] revelation on the earth and here today
[1:12:23] that for destruction is the United
[1:12:25] States of America before destruction is
[1:12:28] the entire world God got some people on
[1:12:30] the earth with an understanding as to
[1:12:33] what's gonna what's getting ready to
[1:12:34] happen and if I get let's break it down
[1:12:38] this way these people have spiritual
[1:12:40] revelation
[1:12:41] oh my gosh
[1:12:46] but as the problem since beginning to
[1:12:49] share these things with you know what
[1:12:51] Abraham me said you say now I heard
[1:12:54] about the sinning son I heard about the
[1:12:57] sin and Gomorrah I'm hearing the saying
[1:12:59] did this sin is reaching all the way to
[1:13:01] heaven and I've come down and I got two
[1:13:05] angels from these angels to call
[1:13:07] investigating angels of judgment
[1:13:11] hallelujah stay with me and say that say
[1:13:14] here these two angels come down as he
[1:13:16] Festa gave me angel judgment I'm sitting
[1:13:18] them down into Sodom to see if it's
[1:13:20] really happening in Sodom like they say
[1:13:22] it's happened and you know what was
[1:13:25] going on the side of homosexuality out
[1:13:27] of all time huh
[1:13:28] praise the Lord and tell me it's not
[1:13:30] there again jesus said as it was in the
[1:13:33] days of lot so shall it be in the coming
[1:13:34] of the Son of man so here we see the
[1:13:36] same conditions in life stay out of same
[1:13:38] conditions today we know judgment is on
[1:13:41] the way because of the sin of the people
[1:13:44] hallelujah
[1:13:48] i'ma just i'ma just say these things I
[1:13:50] might be the only preacher in the city
[1:13:52] center
[1:14:07] how you gonna go to church sit in the
[1:14:11] pew and be a homosexual couple and feel
[1:14:17] comfortable in the house of God how
[1:14:27] that's come happening in God's church I
[1:14:30] just saw two women sitting there hugged
[1:14:34] up on each other in the house of God
[1:14:41] sodomized to come to church and feel
[1:14:44] comfortable something is wrong somewhere
[1:14:49] we got shot on my chin the pulpit yell
[1:14:52] about the pulpit somebody need to shut
[1:14:55] that church yeah i'ma just say this see
[1:15:08] when they let women get in the pulpit
[1:15:10] that's what opened up the door to these
[1:15:12] sodomite spirits that were in the Bible
[1:15:18] it ain't in the Word of God where you
[1:15:20] see these things but when we start
[1:15:22] seeing it that oughtta let us know
[1:15:24] something wrong somewhere now we and
[1:15:27] many of us as believers we can we know
[1:15:30] stuff wrong with that that's why we
[1:15:31] start looking for something else we know
[1:15:33] something wrong with it but in order to
[1:15:35] receive right you gonna have to change
[1:15:37] what you're doing you just can't get
[1:15:41] part of God you have to take all of it
[1:15:43] and the only way you can take all of God
[1:15:47] is you've got to have spiritual
[1:15:48] revelation hallelujah if God give it to
[1:15:53] me he can give it to you all right let
[1:15:55] me let me go a little further with this
[1:15:57] cuz I know I'm not there yet I'm going
[1:15:58] back to my mother I ain't finished with
[1:16:00] this Abraham and Sarah so here here God
[1:16:03] revealing to Abraham
[1:16:05] it says they going down the
[1:16:07] investigation Sodom and Gomorrah because
[1:16:10] I'm about to destroy this place because
[1:16:11] of the sin
[1:16:12] and the homosexuality was just just
[1:16:14] ridiculous one other things that God's
[1:16:17] prophet told us about you know that that
[1:16:20] times that there would be a lot of
[1:16:21] buying and selling hey you know he said
[1:16:24] he said I won't have time to read all
[1:16:26] this but I got if you ever need it I can
[1:16:28] show it to you where he said he says
[1:16:30] it's like when you go out and buy
[1:16:32] refrigerator and now this year you
[1:16:35] bought the refrigerator you paid so much
[1:16:36] money for it but next year they come up
[1:16:38] with a new model and your old model you
[1:16:41] feel like it ain't worth nothing no more
[1:16:42] so you just you just run out then you
[1:16:44] buy another one right or if you the Lord
[1:16:47] bless you got a new car but next year
[1:16:49] they changed something with the lights
[1:16:50] and since it don't look like your car a
[1:16:55] man you put yourself in debt trying to
[1:16:58] keep up with the Joneses going to get
[1:17:00] another car you see saying he say when
[1:17:02] you see that that's a sign of the time
[1:17:04] that's a sign of in time when people do
[1:17:06] that and sometime it might not be a
[1:17:08] couple I mean ha ha ha Apple got people
[1:17:14] paying $1000 for a telephone I mean and
[1:17:23] I'm achieve when i dial your number you
[1:17:25] know it's gonna do ring that's all this
[1:17:30] gum do is ring and you gonna pick up and
[1:17:31] say hello and I'm gonna say hello why
[1:17:33] does it cost $1,000 to do that and not
[1:17:37] only that Amen now now you know because
[1:17:40] you know they're gonna think I changed
[1:17:41] one loose feature and then that and
[1:17:43] I'm selling all over till you give them
[1:17:45] another thousand dollars and because you
[1:17:47] wanna Apple it's just a phone it's not
[1:17:52] an apple it's a phone you can't even
[1:17:56] talk with an apple you talk with a phone
[1:18:02] stop around the devil to get y'all and
[1:18:05] get with this nonsense when they showed
[1:18:11] me a phone here say how much is that it
[1:18:14] cost me how much to change only two
[1:18:16] dollars give it to me I ain't got it
[1:18:20] ain't gotta pay they say I give me that
[1:18:22] one well you're gonna have less I just
[1:18:25] take less
[1:18:26] memory can it make phone calls all right
[1:18:31] glory to God but that's a sign of time
[1:18:33] he would get caught up in all this one
[1:18:34] that you know keep up with it that's a
[1:18:36] sign at a time
[1:18:37] praise look when you look around and see
[1:18:39] all this building of developments that's
[1:18:41] another sign of the time right you can
[1:18:43] see all the natural sounds but keep your
[1:18:44] spiritual signs as well Lord help me I'm
[1:18:47] trying to come back to this
[1:18:48] keep your eyes eight men on the
[1:18:50] spiritual things as well because God is
[1:18:52] moving so when he sends Abraham II say
[1:18:55] his destiny since they were Abraham and
[1:18:57] he's talking and and he sends the other
[1:18:59] two angels down a man into Sodom and
[1:19:03] Gomorrah and they have a job to go down
[1:19:06] and investigate what's going on inside
[1:19:08] him what's going on and Gomorrah amen
[1:19:09] before destruction comes let me let me
[1:19:11] let me just put it's way before
[1:19:13] destruction happens God sends messenger
[1:19:16] and I and I got it the church natural
[1:19:20] receive the messenger the church
[1:19:22] spiritual also receive the message I'm
[1:19:25] talking about two churches glory to God
[1:19:27] I hope y'all can stay with me even here
[1:19:30] in the Bible saying the book of
[1:19:32] Revelation to him that have the ear let
[1:19:34] him hear what the Spirit says unto the
[1:19:36] churches that means there's a church
[1:19:40] spiritual a church natural a church true
[1:19:43] and a church false but they all their Oh
[1:19:46] God can't can he can y'all just bear
[1:19:50] with me
[1:19:50] can y'all be are y'all still with me I
[1:19:53] ain't forgot about my thought I just got
[1:19:55] to drop some things here and there
[1:19:58] glory now I told you there's a church
[1:20:02] natural and a church spiritual you got
[1:20:04] to find church spiritual church spirits
[1:20:07] just moving by spiritual revelation
[1:20:09] right so now now the reason that they're
[1:20:11] both churches the reason that we
[1:20:13] consider them churches and now we can
[1:20:15] send them all Christians oh my the
[1:20:18] church down the street got Christmas in
[1:20:20] it
[1:20:20] the church next door got Christians in
[1:20:22] this church got Christians in it this
[1:20:25] church also got non-christians in it
[1:20:27] this church got three kind of believers
[1:20:30] in it some true believers some
[1:20:32] make-believe us and then some
[1:20:35] unbelievers learn in that scenario
[1:20:37] churchyard
[1:20:40] so who you are cuz a tree got me no but
[1:20:44] it's true
[1:20:46] glory to God alright so so here we got
[1:20:49] these things going on but but the
[1:20:51] reasons that we call them our Christians
[1:20:53] and this where this where we get back to
[1:20:54] that Waldo conversation this way I get a
[1:20:57] little confused because they they all
[1:20:59] churches well did not stand on the word
[1:21:01] of dark can you really call them a
[1:21:02] church if you found waiting off one bit
[1:21:06] you need to get out of there because one
[1:21:09] word oh you're hanging over hell now the
[1:21:13] reason the reason that we called it
[1:21:16] they're all churches because you have
[1:21:17] what we call or we call them our
[1:21:18] Christians because you have these two
[1:21:20] different types you have Christians of
[1:21:22] the Spirit that you have Christians of
[1:21:25] the flesh Oh y'all bear with me I forgot
[1:21:28] my phone I'm coming back little Lord
[1:21:29] just it just helped me to bring it all
[1:21:31] together but you got creatures of the
[1:21:33] Spirit and krystal depression the reason
[1:21:34] that it gets so confusing because
[1:21:35] sometimes you got your eyes on a
[1:21:37] Christian of the flesh and you might
[1:21:40] think that their Christian of the Spirit
[1:21:41] but they're not because they can't go
[1:21:43] all the way with the word they don't
[1:21:45] have true relation now-now-now the
[1:21:47] prophet actually tells us something here
[1:21:49] and I'm gonna I'm gonna stop and read
[1:21:50] this when this is our thoughts here in
[1:21:52] church age I'm in our paragraph 226
[1:21:54] paragraph 1 I'm going back to to Abraham
[1:21:57] and Sarah and them them to angels just
[1:21:59] this y'all don't forget that that's well
[1:22:01] that's where I was because I'm I'm
[1:22:02] getting a little old and sometimes I
[1:22:04] forget so y'all don't forget hey man
[1:22:06] y'all can tell me where I was not get
[1:22:07] back over there I want to read this back
[1:22:10] here in Turkey I'm trying to help you
[1:22:12] understand who Waldo Waldo is who Christ
[1:22:14] it hey man listen he says this in fact
[1:22:18] here in church age he says now why does
[1:22:22] God call these churches his churches
[1:22:23] even though they are the false vine I'm
[1:22:25] in 226 paragraph 1 he says that the
[1:22:29] truth of the matter is that they are
[1:22:31] Christians but they are not Christians
[1:22:34] of the spirits they are Christians of
[1:22:37] the flesh listen they are bearing the
[1:22:40] name in vain mark 7 7 howbeit in vain do
[1:22:44] they worship Me teaching for doctrines
[1:22:46] the commandments of men but indeed they
[1:22:48] are Christians for what else could they
[1:22:50] be that Christians what else
[1:22:52] maybe is a that is
[1:22:56] his religion no matter how he lives it
[1:22:58] because he subscribes in theory to what
[1:23:01] the Quran teaches in the same way a
[1:23:03] Christian is a Christian as long as he
[1:23:06] subscribes to the fact that Jesus is the
[1:23:08] Son of God born of a virgin was
[1:23:11] crucified and died and rose again then
[1:23:13] he is the savior of mankind etc in fact
[1:23:17] in the latest in age which is the age in
[1:23:19] which we live in it right now
[1:23:20] in the latest in age there will be those
[1:23:23] who call themselves Christians because
[1:23:25] they subscribe to the fine qualities of
[1:23:27] Jesus while reserving to themselves the
[1:23:30] right to deny his deity Christian
[1:23:33] scientists have done that already as
[1:23:35] well as multitudes who preach a social
[1:23:38] gospel now when I just started talk
[1:23:40] about homosexuality a man in the pulpit
[1:23:42] that man a social gospel that's what
[1:23:45] that that's that's the type of sermon
[1:23:47] that the only place I can preach is
[1:23:48] right here I'm not going to invite get
[1:23:52] invited to no church to say that they
[1:23:54] will kick me out of there oh my god
[1:23:57] the truth is still the truth no matter
[1:23:59] where we got our I'm glad God gave me
[1:24:01] some place I can see it and be free to
[1:24:03] sing Amen glory guy says preach it they
[1:24:06] said and in multitude who would breach a
[1:24:09] social gospel let me else we'll just
[1:24:11] drop in it social gospel is the one that
[1:24:14] tell you're gonna get rich by tomorrow
[1:24:18] they were they a blessing plan and you
[1:24:21] know we go to church we want somebody to
[1:24:22] prop us all of us you know you you uh
[1:24:29] one time my sister went to the fair and
[1:24:32] there was a lady out there reading
[1:24:34] crystal balls and she saw my sister
[1:24:37] walked by she began to say hey you got
[1:24:39] this going on you got that going on you
[1:24:40] got this going on you got that going on
[1:24:42] that lady told her exactly what was
[1:24:44] going on I like this she was she was
[1:24:45] right we all look the same
[1:24:48] now that they didn't even confess
[1:24:50] Christianity but she was dead right you
[1:24:52] know that was a gift and gifts and
[1:24:55] callings are without repentance so
[1:24:57] anybody can have that kind of gift we're
[1:24:59] not looking for that but you know but
[1:25:01] church don't become that but everybody
[1:25:02] just walked onward from
[1:25:04] I'm giving it to you I'm giving you the
[1:25:07] word from the Lord I'm reading to you at
[1:25:09] the Bible that's your word from the Lord
[1:25:12] right but but everybody looked at this
[1:25:14] type of stuff when they go to church we
[1:25:16] want to be entertained we got the music
[1:25:18] got to be just right and you know and it
[1:25:21] come on y'all worship with me come on
[1:25:22] and worship with come on everybody come
[1:25:24] on come on
[1:25:25] wave your hand and I got to do that
[1:25:28] every time you come to church you
[1:25:29] missing the reason while you're in
[1:25:31] church you out you'll need nobody to
[1:25:34] tell you to worship you already got that
[1:25:36] only inside of you and I'ma tell you
[1:25:38] saying something
[1:25:39] anointed then we will worship you know
[1:25:46] we got all this lunch that's going on in
[1:25:48] church a lot of nonsense a lot of
[1:25:50] nonsense and people people don't
[1:25:52] understand that they missing true
[1:25:53] revelation right God not God not coming
[1:25:56] just to entertain people he's trying to
[1:25:57] get something into your spirit let me
[1:26:00] stay witness I'm trying to show you that
[1:26:03] there's there's these two groups that
[1:26:04] you need to just kind of be watchful of
[1:26:06] two groups all right sorry says
[1:26:09] Christian Sciences have done that
[1:26:10] already as well as multitudes of preach
[1:26:12] the social gospel he is a nominal
[1:26:14] Christian and belongs to the church but
[1:26:16] he is not a true or spiritual believer
[1:26:19] that kind of believers one who is I was
[1:26:23] I've been baptized into the body of
[1:26:25] Christ and as a member of him but
[1:26:27] nonetheless it is in God's order that
[1:26:30] the tears grow up with the wheat and
[1:26:32] they are not to be uprooted that is the
[1:26:34] command of God their day for binding and
[1:26:37] burning is coming but not yet now I'm
[1:26:40] using that and if you always just let me
[1:26:42] y'all bear with me here I want to drop
[1:26:45] these things off I'm getting back over
[1:26:46] here - what happened with Abraham and
[1:26:48] Sarah but I need to drop off a couple of
[1:26:51] things so you can get some spiritual
[1:26:53] revelation Lord help us lord help us I
[1:26:55] want to read I want to read something
[1:26:57] else
[1:26:58] amen this is out of why other people so
[1:27:00] tossed about I want to try to help us if
[1:27:03] I can glory to God now yes these are
[1:27:06] Christians and yes they're Christians
[1:27:07] but what's the difference some are
[1:27:08] operating under spiritual revelation or
[1:27:11] what we would call they're they're
[1:27:13] Christians of the spirit not Christians
[1:27:15] of the flesh
[1:27:16] glory to God amen anybody can believe
[1:27:18] Jesus died for this is anybody can do
[1:27:21] that and like we heard last week God so
[1:27:23] loved the world that He gave His only
[1:27:25] begotten Son but the question is what
[1:27:27] world what world it God loves it's not
[1:27:30] the were you thinking that he loved
[1:27:32] because he said he said he hate the
[1:27:34] world and the things not the world so
[1:27:36] how you gonna love the world and hate
[1:27:38] the world at the same time we need to
[1:27:39] know which were all he talking about
[1:27:41] Loreena God hey man we don't misuse the
[1:27:45] scripture we already got God trying to
[1:27:48] bring us back to truth though hearing
[1:27:49] this this message while the people still
[1:27:51] talks about listeners now speaking this
[1:27:53] there is two different types of
[1:27:55] Christianity's oh look at that two
[1:27:58] different types of Christianity seem
[1:27:59] strange but I would not say two
[1:28:02] different types I say two different
[1:28:03] phases would be a better word to use not
[1:28:06] two types two phases the same
[1:28:08] Christianity but two phases of it and
[1:28:10] one of them is an intellectual or mental
[1:28:13] conception of what God has said in his
[1:28:15] word and of Jesus Christ by the way of
[1:28:18] knowledge and alright I mean why other
[1:28:20] people so tossed about he says and the
[1:28:23] other is an experimental experience that
[1:28:27] God has given the man in his heart the
[1:28:30] one intellectually is a hungry he is
[1:28:32] he's a piece of young God his feast
[1:28:35] doesn't hold out oh my lord
[1:28:38] he's feast young God but his piece
[1:28:40] doesn't hold out what is he trying to
[1:28:42] say that you know you can go to church
[1:28:43] amen and get a little blessing glory to
[1:28:47] God and let me tell you something yes it
[1:28:49] is the same Holy Ghost that were falling
[1:28:52] here that will fall in any other Church
[1:28:54] it's the same exact Holy Ghost right you
[1:28:58] can get a little blessing you think man
[1:28:59] God is in this but for some reason the
[1:29:01] blessing don't hold out who you at some
[1:29:05] point in time that blessing prior right
[1:29:07] and you're going looking for something
[1:29:09] else and reason you're looking for
[1:29:11] something else because there is
[1:29:12] something else for you to have if
[1:29:15] there's a deeper you calling out to the
[1:29:17] deep the children has a deep to respond
[1:29:18] to that cry now listen says the one
[1:29:21] intellectually is a hunger and he's a
[1:29:22] feasted on God but his feasts don't hold
[1:29:25] out the other one seems to have victory
[1:29:27] all the time
[1:29:29] I like Christians like that victory all
[1:29:31] the time
[1:29:32] there's nothing bothers them they're
[1:29:35] just as solid and anchored as they can
[1:29:38] be no trials no storms bothers them at
[1:29:42] all but they seem to have something
[1:29:44] about them that people who are
[1:29:46] Christians are trying to live forgot
[1:29:47] admire that type of Christian and that's
[1:29:50] the type of Christian you want to be and
[1:29:52] I've often wondered Lord what is it that
[1:29:54] that these people have that others crave
[1:29:56] so much for and yet seem to fail to get
[1:29:59] it so what he's trying to tell us here
[1:30:00] now there is there's two different types
[1:30:02] a men are two different phases of
[1:30:04] Christians you have you have something
[1:30:06] that's approaching God with an
[1:30:07] intellectual conception and then others
[1:30:10] have a true revelation of who he is
[1:30:12] now I'm going on I'm gonna read a little
[1:30:14] bit more I want to read from the message
[1:30:16] to the 3rd Exodus amen the 3rd Exodus
[1:30:19] I'm trying to get you to see that
[1:30:21] there's a difference in and what you see
[1:30:23] that the true spiritual seed and then
[1:30:25] also amen and if I could just put it in
[1:30:27] and in that term Abraham had a spiritual
[1:30:31] seed and he had a natural seat right so
[1:30:33] we got we got to kind of catch the
[1:30:35] spiritual seed and what God's doing
[1:30:36] specifically job is experience and they
[1:30:39] that worship Him must worship Him in
[1:30:40] spirit and truth we trying to approach
[1:30:42] it naturally but God can't be approached
[1:30:44] that way it's got to be spiritually you
[1:30:47] got to have spiritual revelation only
[1:30:48] the father can give you that that's this
[1:30:51] one out of third Exodus stay with me
[1:30:53] here God had Moses to be prophet and
[1:30:59] though he had already prophesied and it
[1:31:01] proved that he was right but yet he was
[1:31:03] in the school of wilderness hid away
[1:31:05] from the rest of the world but he was
[1:31:07] school being trained out in the
[1:31:09] wilderness the enemies were proposed
[1:31:11] always his system and unbelief will
[1:31:13] accept because the enemy is the
[1:31:16] intellectual side so now remember
[1:31:18] there's only two don't forget this
[1:31:20] there's only two powers one is spiritual
[1:31:23] power of the Holy Spirit the other is
[1:31:26] the devil working through intellectual
[1:31:28] power so you have to balance one is
[1:31:31] spiritual power of the Holy Spirit and
[1:31:33] the other one is the devil working
[1:31:35] through intellectual power since but
[1:31:37] then that's where he entered in the
[1:31:39] Garden of Eden
[1:31:40] through intellectual powers to make you
[1:31:43] believe in intellectual conception
[1:31:45] against the word just as friends it can
[1:31:47] be the kids could get that see see and
[1:31:51] that's the way it's been all the way
[1:31:52] down I really want to take my time and
[1:31:55] break into that garden of eatin a man
[1:31:58] conditioner I'm just not gonna have time
[1:32:00] today I already feel like I'm have to
[1:32:02] come back and preach this in two parts
[1:32:04] but I but whatever the main thing that
[1:32:07] I'm trying to get you to see if I can
[1:32:08] just just just just drive this point
[1:32:10] home when you're looking for Christ
[1:32:13] you're gonna have to catch it
[1:32:14] spiritually right I mean even today all
[1:32:17] the way back in that time they had to
[1:32:18] catch things spiritually a man when they
[1:32:21] say who do men say I am they had to
[1:32:22] catch them spiritually and today we
[1:32:24] gotta have to be we gotta catch it
[1:32:26] spiritually it's not because somebody
[1:32:27] sat down and share these things with you
[1:32:29] God gotta open up your understanding in
[1:32:34] order for him to open up your
[1:32:35] understanding you need to be in a place
[1:32:38] where he can do that you you can't be
[1:32:43] feasting on false and expect God to open
[1:32:47] up something real to you now he can't do
[1:32:48] that
[1:32:49] he can't do that but but but if you
[1:32:51] already know that there's a difference
[1:32:52] why not give everything you got to
[1:32:56] what's real just for a little bit Trilok
[1:32:58] for a little bit why not give everything
[1:33:00] you got what I mean by that come to
[1:33:02] church on Wednesday night come to church
[1:33:06] on Friday night I mean when you're
[1:33:08] really seeking God should go through
[1:33:10] great extremes to find him I mean it's
[1:33:14] not just a Sunday morning thing here I
[1:33:16] mean anytime the church doors open I'm
[1:33:18] seeking God for more revelation I want
[1:33:22] to be there to hear what God got to say
[1:33:23] to me give God everything you got just
[1:33:26] for a little bit let me go on now
[1:33:29] hallelujah get on back over here to
[1:33:32] Abraham Sarah these three angels God and
[1:33:36] two angels come down and God's in the
[1:33:37] two angels away and tells Abraham
[1:33:39] they're on their way to Sodom they're on
[1:33:42] the way to Gomorrah and they're going
[1:33:44] down to check out what's going on down
[1:33:46] there in this land because you know the
[1:33:48] stands are reaching heaven and and I
[1:33:50] can't allow I cannot allow people to
[1:33:52] live on my
[1:33:52] the Earth's thinning like that I'm gonna
[1:33:55] have to destroy these people off the
[1:33:56] face of the earth so Abraham when God
[1:33:59] told him exactly that he was going to
[1:34:01] you going where Lord and say they're
[1:34:04] going to Sodom and they're going to
[1:34:05] Gomorrah
[1:34:06] so Abraham being outside the city glory
[1:34:10] to God because that's where we
[1:34:11] Christians live outside the things of
[1:34:13] the world hello we don't do what the
[1:34:16] world does we Christians we don't go to
[1:34:19] the places that the world goes we
[1:34:20] Christians we don't drink like the world
[1:34:22] drink we Christians we don't dress like
[1:34:25] the world's rest we Christians we don't
[1:34:27] look like the world look we Christians
[1:34:31] so here you know here here Abraham
[1:34:34] sitting out there and God reveals to him
[1:34:36] say now and notice the spirits
[1:34:38] revelation came to Abraham light didn't
[1:34:40] even know what was giving than half the
[1:34:41] light down there having a good time
[1:34:43] partying up something glory to God he
[1:34:45] just pardon up something and his wife
[1:34:47] just so wrapped up in her society and
[1:34:50] got all her friends if I can just put it
[1:34:53] this way she got so many followers she
[1:34:59] got so many followers and and do you
[1:35:01] realize that because you got something
[1:35:03] that followers you become a slave to the
[1:35:05] followers you got to keep producing
[1:35:07] content you become a slave to it because
[1:35:12] you got so and everybody looking for you
[1:35:14] to do some you become a slave to it
[1:35:16] because you've got so many followers if
[1:35:21] you just get offline Chester look
[1:35:23] everybody where you at what happened to
[1:35:25] you I'm fasting
[1:35:37] Abraham is sitting there with God in the
[1:35:40] tent it was god of two angels and
[1:35:42] Abraham sitting there and God beginning
[1:35:43] some said now they're going down there
[1:35:45] they going down to destroy a lot had no
[1:35:47] idea that destruction was coming but
[1:35:49] here in God's grace I'm not even kind of
[1:35:52] talked about there's this I hope you can
[1:35:54] follow me there's two scenes going on
[1:35:57] there's one theme in Sodom and there's
[1:36:01] another scene with Abraham but God is
[1:36:04] working in both areas
[1:36:05] all glory to God so here we have here we
[1:36:09] have God amen moving with Abraham and
[1:36:12] revealing Abraham giving them spiritual
[1:36:14] revelation of the things that's get
[1:36:15] ready to happen and when Abraham
[1:36:17] captures it by revelation saying I keep
[1:36:19] going away they go away they're going
[1:36:21] down on the stopped Abraham say oh we
[1:36:24] say they're gonna destroy it they if you
[1:36:26] know we if we find out that they're
[1:36:27] doing down there what we heard that it's
[1:36:29] going to be the trucks Abraham say real
[1:36:31] quick he got in the prayer mode it's a
[1:36:33] long curved engine there be 50 in Sodom
[1:36:40] you know 50 righteous say where to
[1:36:43] destroy the whole city you got 50
[1:36:45] righteous people on that he said no I
[1:36:47] won't destroy if I can find 50 righteous
[1:36:48] they ran say okay what if it's lacking
[1:36:51] five and you got forty five righteous
[1:36:54] will you destroy the city of your final
[1:36:56] 40 messing on no no I wonder struggle
[1:36:58] around forty five say okay Lord I don't
[1:37:01] get upset with me but what about 30 he
[1:37:03] was back in 20 and you find 39 with you
[1:37:06] with your destruction say no i won't i
[1:37:08] won't this rope I can find 30 okay God
[1:37:10] now I know I've been I'm overstepping my
[1:37:13] you know my space here what about 20 if
[1:37:16] I find swinging righteous you got my
[1:37:18] promise that I will not destroy that
[1:37:20] place Abraham so Abraham just thinking
[1:37:23] in his mind cuz they knew he knew what
[1:37:26] was going on down in that city but he
[1:37:28] also knew that he had relatives down
[1:37:30] there I heard somebody tell me yesterday
[1:37:34] the family first family first no matter
[1:37:39] what family first
[1:37:42] hallelujah I like that I said I'm gonna
[1:37:44] use that family first no matter what
[1:37:46] family first
[1:37:47] glory to God right so here Abraham got
[1:37:50] it in his mind family first and he said
[1:37:52] he said he said now I'm trying to count
[1:37:55] them out I'm trying to calculate this
[1:37:57] thing I'm trying to figure this thing
[1:37:57] out you saying I know lightest down
[1:37:59] there no I know I know Lot's wife is
[1:38:02] down there and and not only that I know
[1:38:05] I know lots of children have gotten
[1:38:07] married now you know what Abraham knew
[1:38:11] that they was married and and I'm sure
[1:38:13] I'm sure
[1:38:14] Abraham probably told a lot a few things
[1:38:16] before his daughter's got in there
[1:38:18] to them people down there in Sodom hello
[1:38:21] somebody
[1:38:22] I'm sure Abraham spoke some things but
[1:38:25] yet Lots daughters went ahead and got
[1:38:27] married but the man that they married
[1:38:30] can I just be honest with y'all I'm
[1:38:32] telling y'all Bible the man that they've
[1:38:35] married we're men that we're not looking
[1:38:37] to get married to have real wives
[1:38:40] hallelujah these men had other
[1:38:42] intentions maybe it was because they got
[1:38:44] a good tax return they got they got they
[1:38:52] got other reasons why they getting
[1:38:54] married right but by here here they are
[1:38:57] here let's let's say uh they say uh
[1:38:59] Abraham said now I got lunch Lot's wife
[1:39:03] lots of two daughters their their
[1:39:07] spouses these things now maybe maybe
[1:39:09] maybe just maybe the people that that
[1:39:14] lot gave his daughter to maybe their
[1:39:16] parents I believe us - maybe you counted
[1:39:20] them folks I got ten so I said okay lord
[1:39:22] I know you said 20 what if it's only ten
[1:39:26] righteous it said if I could find ten I
[1:39:29] won't try to get this and a city
[1:39:32] probably larger than West Palm Beach God
[1:39:35] could not find ten folk living right 10
[1:39:42] 10 we got more than ten in the church
[1:39:44] today and if this was in Jesus right now
[1:39:47] as it was in the days of life so shall
[1:39:49] it be in the coming of the Son of Man
[1:39:51] Willy farm 10 I stand would be one of
[1:39:56] them
[1:39:57] I'm gonna be one of them and and and
[1:40:00] here here's the things that I love about
[1:40:02] this this particular passage of
[1:40:04] Scripture is that before I mean even
[1:40:08] though Abraham did not actually ask God
[1:40:10] for life God knew what his prayer was
[1:40:15] and he went down there and pull a lot
[1:40:18] and his daughters and his wife out now
[1:40:20] you know you go back and read Genesis 19
[1:40:22] lot tried to get his son-in-law to come
[1:40:25] but they couldn't it wouldn't come it
[1:40:27] was so it was so bad in that city that
[1:40:30] when the angel showed up the men of the
[1:40:32] city wanted to sexually get to know the
[1:40:36] angels that's how bad it was in that
[1:40:40] city that they would go after angels
[1:40:42] these men was so wicked that women
[1:40:45] didn't do anything for them anymore oh I
[1:40:50] might there you want to know why can I
[1:40:54] tell y'all why the women didn't do
[1:40:55] nothing for them do y'all want to know
[1:40:57] why the reasons that the women then do
[1:41:01] nothing for them anymore because the men
[1:41:03] had sought a woman's flesh so much that
[1:41:05] it stopped appealing to them they saw
[1:41:10] their flesh so much you know right now
[1:41:13] everybody trying to push this out and
[1:41:14] push it out
[1:41:15] I mean you you're doing so much that men
[1:41:17] don't even want it now you got women
[1:41:19] whistling at you
[1:41:25] that's how sad it was no glory to God I
[1:41:29] know anything about the troop and I go
[1:41:31] to church and see two women sitting up
[1:41:32] there hugged up from each other I know
[1:41:33] something wrong with this this this is
[1:41:35] this is Sodom and Gomorrah conditions in
[1:41:37] the house of God and I'm a and I know
[1:41:40] right and I thought wouldn't come to
[1:41:42] this church and do that I know it I know
[1:41:43] it they might they might start out might
[1:41:45] not know what type of church it is and
[1:41:46] then then after a little sermon like
[1:41:48] this you see their hands light down and
[1:41:51] then you see them
[1:41:56] we put a mark only on this I'll never go
[1:42:00] back to that church again but as as
[1:42:05] locked back by the grace of God got a
[1:42:08] visitation from two angels heavenly
[1:42:11] beings but yet still they had a
[1:42:13] designing heart where they wanted the
[1:42:15] things of the world each day now when
[1:42:16] y'all leave the city don't look back and
[1:42:18] hear Lot's wife when she turned she
[1:42:19] didn't turn physically it was in her
[1:42:21] heart that she turned she won it back
[1:42:22] and when she would turn it on heart she
[1:42:24] turned into a pillar of salt now I need
[1:42:26] you to understand what the Prophet told
[1:42:27] us about this and I'm bringing this I'm
[1:42:29] trying to bring this all the way back
[1:42:30] around what the Prophet told us say now
[1:42:32] when Abraham received a piece of
[1:42:35] elohim's named God's name himself when
[1:42:37] his name was changed from April to
[1:42:39] Abraham right he says now there was
[1:42:42] never of time in all history where God
[1:42:45] dealt with the world the way that he
[1:42:47] dealt Amen the way that he dealt back
[1:42:49] there in that time he said notice he
[1:42:51] changed Abraham's name he was a
[1:42:53] messenger I mean he received the
[1:42:55] messenger Abraham received message but
[1:42:56] also lot and the people of Sodom they
[1:42:59] received two messengers he said that's a
[1:43:02] tight for two modern messengers that
[1:43:04] went to them today
[1:43:05] the to modern messages for Oral Roberts
[1:43:07] and Billy Graham you say notice now
[1:43:10] Graham H am GRA H a.m. there's never
[1:43:15] been a man of God on the scene with that
[1:43:18] last name like that ending with h8m and
[1:43:20] God using the way he used Billy Graham
[1:43:22] oh there's never he said in all history
[1:43:27] God I can look at all the great revivals
[1:43:29] that happen there was never a time where
[1:43:32] God used the man with the last name
[1:43:34] ending in H am g ra h am is that what he
[1:43:40] said but spiritual revelation spiritual
[1:43:47] revelation
[1:43:49] Billy Graham and Oral Roberts went to
[1:43:51] church Stalin they pursued the church
[1:43:54] the Christians of the flesh if I can put
[1:43:57] it that way they they went to they went
[1:43:59] to a different group and they did a
[1:44:00] mighty work God used them just like he
[1:44:02] used the two angels damage in Genesis 19
[1:44:04] but remember he said there was never
[1:44:07] time that God used a messenger with the
[1:44:11] name ended with H a.m. and gr8 h8m and
[1:44:16] they say he said now he went on to say a
[1:44:17] little further they say six letters and
[1:44:21] they stop there we say six letters why
[1:44:23] because it's gonna take spiritual
[1:44:25] revelation for you to catch something
[1:44:27] else there was two things happening yes
[1:44:30] God was dealing with the church out here
[1:44:32] but he's also dealing with this group
[1:44:33] over here where Abraham was now Abraham
[1:44:37] a B are a saint em seven letters 6
[1:44:44] represents the number of men but 7 is a
[1:44:47] number of completion so in Abraham's
[1:44:55] tent God was revealing certain things
[1:44:57] Abraham that locked them had no idea
[1:45:00] what's happening so spirits revelation
[1:45:04] also tells us that God dealt with
[1:45:06] another man in this generation and his
[1:45:09] name also ended with H I am NOT just GRA
[1:45:15] H am Graham six letters but there was a
[1:45:19] man with seven letters and God used his
[1:45:21] ministry as well his name happen to be
[1:45:25] BR am H am seven letters Brenham take
[1:45:37] spiritual revelation to understand what
[1:45:40] God was doing over here with this group
[1:45:42] and what God was doing with that group
[1:45:44] and God was involved in both groups
[1:45:55] hallelujah
[1:45:58] here's the the significance behind this
[1:46:03] after the two angels went down into
[1:46:07] Sodom and they pull lot in his wife and
[1:46:12] his children out after they left now I'm
[1:46:17] gonna tell you was a hard time to get
[1:46:19] him out of there
[1:46:19] it was hard I mean they was a lingering
[1:46:22] just a lingual just I mean and I don't
[1:46:25] know maybe a lot really realizing and I
[1:46:27] ain't gonna be Mary anymore I lost my
[1:46:29] status here I haven't lost it and he
[1:46:31] said sit man you better start worried

[1:46:40] your status

[1:55:52] Sodom their City I mean they started
[1:55:54] deducing Thanks
[1:55:55] it ain't as bad as what they doing in
[1:55:57] Sodom no God didn't like that either she
[1:56:04] was with Abraham that would've never
[1:56:05] happened but you didn't hear that kind
[1:56:10] of stuff going on Abraham's camp
[1:56:11] praise the Lord when it's time to get
[1:56:14] married
[1:56:15] Abraham when it's intently 0/5 somebody
[1:56:17] bring them back for my son but they
[1:56:19] didn't have them kind of problems in
[1:56:20] Abraham's camp a lot compromising always
[1:56:24] compromise and always compromise and
[1:56:26] always compromising and looking for the
[1:56:27] trouble it produced and lot gathers our
[1:56:30] own two daughters pregnant and i'ma tell
[1:56:32] you I don't think he was that drunk I
[1:56:35] know he won that drunk I know it I'm
[1:56:38] 100% sure I can prove it by the Bible
[1:56:40] life was not that drunk cuz we lookin
[1:56:45] Davis day when David got this other
[1:56:47] woman pregnant Bathsheba he called her
[1:56:50] husband off of the field I in the battle
[1:56:53] Uriah
[1:56:54] come on home and got the man drunk I
[1:56:56] said nah man you ain't got to be out
[1:56:58] there battling some man going down there
[1:56:59] in special town with your wife
[1:57:01] Uriah say nine going home say man the
[1:57:04] attention he just drunk he was drunk as
[1:57:06] I don't know what he was so drunk he
[1:57:08] fell asleep at Davis house they sent the
[1:57:12] man outside father's gonna go home
[1:57:14] because you don't drink and puts fear
[1:57:15] some somebody say it's the truth
[1:57:21] Amy hi they say not going down anyway
[1:57:27] flame man fell asleep right at Davis DOE
[1:57:29] and David no no I got me not that effect
[1:57:34] on the battlefield I can't go down there
[1:57:36] and have no pledge with my wife I gotta
[1:57:38] stay right here and get ready for the
[1:57:39] battle
[1:57:40] that's not light when that drunk cuz
[1:57:42] your Rio when that drunk either and he
[1:57:45] had good sense some people like to bling
[1:57:48] they talking on they drink no they've
[1:57:51] been want to say that all alone they
[1:57:53] using a drink to get it out
[1:58:05] the the thing that I need you to see is
[1:58:08] that spirits revelation is what Abraham
[1:58:12] had so that he could avoid what was
[1:58:15] given to happened down to Sodom and
[1:58:16] Gomorrah a lot didn't had that lot was
[1:58:21] what we would call a nominal believer
[1:58:23] and God loved him so much that he still
[1:58:25] brought him out before he destroyed it
[1:58:27] right and what God's trying to do is get
[1:58:29] people attention again that they just as
[1:58:31] I gave you as God had God Himself in two
[1:58:34] angels that went down in suffering the
[1:58:36] most time God did the same thing day God
[1:58:38] came down in the Ministry of William
[1:58:40] Branham and he used that ministry to get
[1:58:42] the bride's attention that's all the way
[1:58:44] not to exalt brother Branham but God was
[1:58:47] using his ministry if God could enter
[1:58:50] into a man's body and Abraham's time get
[1:58:54] God can enter into a man's body today
[1:58:56] it's still God oh just like he used
[1:59:03] Billy Graham in Oral Roberts
[1:59:05] he used brother Branham it was the same
[1:59:08] God using them all now I'll tell you
[1:59:11] what I'm gonna read one quote I got some
[1:59:13] other things here that I need to say to
[1:59:15] y'all and but it's gonna come at a later
[1:59:18] time I want to talk a little bit more
[1:59:20] about this spiritual revelation but here
[1:59:22] let me uh let me let me let me kind of
[1:59:24] find a way out of here today since you
[1:59:28] know Billy Graham we honor this great
[1:59:32] man of God God called him at ninety nine
[1:59:36] years old but like I told you before
[1:59:38] when when the angels left song
[1:59:41] destruction immediately came and I don't
[1:59:44] know what's going to happen here in our
[1:59:46] time but I know descriptions about to
[1:59:48] come we we are turning a spiritual
[1:59:51] corner and you better be ready to turn
[1:59:53] you better be ready to turn
[1:59:55] don't miss this church things are
[1:59:58] happening very fast I honor this man of
[2:00:03] God
[2:00:03] I went out and just found a couple
[2:00:05] quotes I'm coming coming home
[2:00:07] the last quote I'm gonna read is out of
[2:00:09] proving his word so just get that ready
[2:00:11] but before we before we say that I think
[2:00:14] that might be the last one I read but
[2:00:16] here just
[2:00:18] a couple quotes that I pulled from from
[2:00:19] Billy Graham Amen some things that he
[2:00:21] stated while he was here with us we
[2:00:23] thank God for this great man of God and
[2:00:25] man he made a statement says God proved
[2:00:29] his love on the cross when Christ hung
[2:00:30] and bled and died it was God saying to
[2:00:32] the world I love you says being a
[2:00:35] Christian is more than just an
[2:00:38] instantaneous conversion it is a daily
[2:00:42] process wherever you grow to be more and
[2:00:44] more like Christ so being a Christian is
[2:00:46] not some type of instantaneous
[2:00:48] conversion right he also said this this
[2:00:50] is a good one I like this when wealth is
[2:00:52] lost nothing is lost that's because you
[2:00:56] can get it all back right when health is
[2:00:59] lost something is lost but look at this
[2:01:05] when character is lost all is lost
[2:01:12] I want you to think about that when
[2:01:15] wealth is lost nothing is lost when
[2:01:17] health is lost something is lost when
[2:01:21] characters lost all this loves when your
[2:01:25] character don't mean nothing to people
[2:01:26] you know lost everything you said my
[2:01:30] home is in heaven I'm just traveling
[2:01:32] through this world he says he says I've
[2:01:36] read the last page of the Bible it's all
[2:01:38] gonna turn out all right says God will
[2:01:42] prepare everything for our perfect
[2:01:43] happiness in heaven he says God will
[2:01:45] prepare everything for our perfect
[2:01:47] happiness in heaven and if it takes my
[2:01:50] dog being there I believe he'll be there
[2:01:55] that's what that's it now what do you
[2:01:57] think he heard that because the Prophet
[2:02:03] talked about his dog being in heaven he
[2:02:06] had a vision of his dog being in heaven
[2:02:08] soon everything I love and everything
[2:02:10] that ever loved me God has given me a
[2:02:16] prophet said William Branham and here
[2:02:19] Billy Graham is quoting that said if my
[2:02:21] dog would be there I believe he said he
[2:02:24] said God would prepare everything for
[2:02:26] our perfect happiness in heaven ever it
[2:02:27] takes my dog being there I believe he'll
[2:02:30] be there had a vision he was there on
[2:02:35] the other side he saw the dog come lick
[2:02:37] him on the hand the dog was there even
[2:02:39] saw his horse there I was with you on
[2:02:46] this vision thing but horses and dogs
[2:02:49] and stuff in heaven say come on brother
[2:02:51] you don't went off you say brother I
[2:02:53] appreciate you know your you know your
[2:02:55] criticism and everything he said but
[2:02:57] just tell me where the divorces come
[2:02:59] from that carry Elijah home you say
[2:03:05] where the horse come from that Jesus was
[2:03:07] riding on an axe night I mean in
[2:03:09] Revelation 19 where did that horse come
[2:03:11] from if it didn't come from heaven he
[2:03:14] just put him right back in the work this
[2:03:18] other one that he said a child who was
[2:03:21] allowed to be disrespectful to his
[2:03:23] parents will not have true respect for
[2:03:26] anyone
[2:03:31] notice this statement a child who is
[2:03:33] allowed that's the key allowed to be
[2:03:38] disrespectful to his parents will not
[2:03:41] have true respect for anyone
[2:03:43] so that means pairs got to step up and
[2:03:45] be parents even if the law I saw y'all
[2:03:49] all gonna take me away if I knew they
[2:03:52] was taking me away cuz that's something
[2:03:53] I said it dated my daughter I'm gonna go
[2:03:55] to jail with a smile
[2:03:59] something got happened before I go to
[2:04:01] jail I'm just let you know I'm gonna I'm
[2:04:03] gonna go and when I'm sitting there
[2:04:05] behind bother I will be smiling real
[2:04:14] good ain't gonna get me there for
[2:04:17] nothing right imma beat under something
[2:04:27] but if they allow if a child a child was
[2:04:31] allowed to be disrespectful to his
[2:04:32] parents will not have to respect for
[2:04:34] anyone
[2:04:35] alright let me just finish this by
[2:04:36] reading this this little quote I'm gonna
[2:04:39] do a part two the de sermon because I
[2:04:40] got some more than I need to share with
[2:04:42] you proving this word is what I'm
[2:04:44] reading from and I'm going back I'm
[2:04:47] reading a quote just to solidify what I
[2:04:49] was talking about with Abraham and with
[2:04:52] Sarah and the two that God and two
[2:04:54] angels coming down to visit them since
[2:04:57] now he said that will return again
[2:04:59] son of man which that was that was the
[2:05:02] son of man right there and when he said
[2:05:04] that will return again that's that's
[2:05:06] Jesus said that it's a group 17 as it
[2:05:08] was in the days of life social of you in
[2:05:11] the coming of the Son of Man so it says
[2:05:13] now he said that will return again in
[2:05:14] the son of man which that was that was a
[2:05:17] son of man right there when it called
[2:05:19] him Elohim Lord God Elohim anybody knows
[2:05:22] that's right elephant is the Lord God in
[2:05:24] the beginning
[2:05:25] Elohim created heavens and earth the
[2:05:27] all-sufficient one the son of man made
[2:05:30] flesh there he was standing there in
[2:05:32] flesh at that time like a theophany
[2:05:34] standing there discerning what Sarah was
[2:05:37] saying in the
[2:05:38] behind him they promised watch the Royal
[2:05:40] seed of Abraham its promised to see the
[2:05:43] same thing but notice luck
[2:05:44] he had a messenger down their lot had a
[2:05:47] messenger down there - two of them went
[2:05:51] down there one of them went down another
[2:05:53] one went down with them and they
[2:05:55] preached and call the people to flee
[2:05:58] from the wrath that was to come says
[2:06:00] positionally the world has never sit in
[2:06:03] that estate from that day that Jesus
[2:06:06] made the promise them to write now I
[2:06:08] want to ask any historian that might be
[2:06:11] in the building or if you here even on
[2:06:14] this tape and here at any time please
[2:06:16] write me
[2:06:16] I've study history now for some 30 years
[2:06:19] the Bible history and there's never
[2:06:21] there never has been a person that I've
[2:06:23] met I've ever seen in all the history of
[2:06:25] the church through the seven churches
[2:06:27] that we're now and laid to see it and we
[2:06:29] know that now let me also just drop this
[2:06:32] off the reason I'm reading to you what
[2:06:34] the Prophet said of what brother Ram
[2:06:36] said we had never heard these things in
[2:06:38] the churches that we preached that we
[2:06:40] went to we didn't hear these truths we
[2:06:43] wouldn't even know these things existed
[2:06:45] so it's important for me to kind of tell
[2:06:48] you look a prophet is trying to tell you
[2:06:50] something here what the Prophet is
[2:06:53] saying in the Bible time when the
[2:06:54] Prophet said thus saith the Lord
[2:06:56] you better be listening and God sent a
[2:06:59] prophet in this day he had thus saith
[2:07:01] the Lord
[2:07:02] we better be listening listen it says
[2:07:06] now has there been a messenger that ever
[2:07:10] went to the entire church with his name
[2:07:11] ending with h8m till now g ra h am billy
[2:07:17] graham there has been moody's vinny
[2:07:21] Senki knox luther he just going through
[2:07:23] church history giving you names and so
[2:07:25] forth but never a h8m now how many
[2:07:29] people would have been able to catch
[2:07:30] that but the Prophet did write never H
[2:07:33] am father to nations and if you go back
[2:07:36] and look Billy Graham's ministry went to
[2:07:39] every nation and the prophets say he was
[2:07:43] a father to me everybody acknowledged
[2:07:45] this man's ministry
[2:07:46] the mint I mean even the president's
[2:07:49] every I mean a president got an office
[2:07:51] he went to seek out Billy Graham Clinton
[2:07:56] got in trouble
[2:07:56] talking to Billy Graham anytime anything
[2:08:02] happened I mean Eisenhower all the way
[2:08:05] up this man was a I mean this man was
[2:08:07] was was just their Minister and tar the
[2:08:09] president's they wouldn't have brother
[2:08:11] branham come in and minister today we
[2:08:15] call that they seen but see been a
[2:08:19] nominal or social gospel preacher God
[2:08:23] used them but in what we call a social
[2:08:25] gospel preacher he's one that don't rub
[2:08:27] nobody wrong Oh
[2:08:30] sometimes you gonna come here and you're
[2:08:32] gonna get rubbed the wrong way sometimes
[2:08:37] I come in and get rubbed the wrong way I
[2:08:38] don't have preachers cut me in my shoes
[2:08:42] if y'all can see my feet inside my shoes
[2:08:45] they just like this please don't step no
[2:08:50] more my toes but you know what that let
[2:08:52] us know that God loves rebuke and
[2:08:58] chasten hello somebody when you do wrong
[2:09:02] you should get rebuked Amen tell us
[2:09:07] somebody is the truth Amy hi all right
[2:09:15] let me go on father the nations now
[2:09:18] remember he is gr aham six letters but
[2:09:22] Abraham a br aham and seven letters
[2:09:26] notice they're down there daily Billy
[2:09:30] Graham going into all parts of the world
[2:09:32] and calling out a song calling out of
[2:09:34] Sodom come out flee the wrath that is
[2:09:36] that is to come there is no man that I
[2:09:39] know of in the field that has got ahold
[2:09:41] of God on the word of justification like
[2:09:43] Billy Graham does he can present it he's
[2:09:46] not such a theologian I guess he's a
[2:09:47] theologian but he's he's not just a
[2:09:49] powerful teacher but God is with him
[2:09:51] that man will stand there with like a
[2:09:54] Sunday School lesson hold those people
[2:09:57] spellbound he is God's servant of the ow
[2:10:00] that's what a prophet said about him to
[2:10:02] who the church natural that's in Sodom
[2:10:05] but remember see his his message went to
[2:10:09] Sodom now Abraham didn't receive the
[2:10:12] message inside
[2:10:13] Abraham was outside aside he had a
[2:10:16] different messenger all right
[2:10:19] says but remember there was one church
[2:10:22] spiritual that wasn't in that
[2:10:25] denominational outfit either called out
[2:10:30] group and they received the message also
[2:10:32] and a messenger and what was it discern
[2:10:37] of the thoughts that was in the heart
[2:10:39] God always proves his worth and if you
[2:10:43] just caught that scroll back up like
[2:10:45] paragraph 204 right there just take your
[2:10:48] finger and go up 204 all right now I'll
[2:10:51] keep going right there notice that way
[2:10:55] it says name ending in with H am too now
[2:10:59] gr8 H am Billy Graham there's been
[2:11:02] moody's fini finish thank Enochs
[2:11:03] Luther's so forth but never a H am
[2:11:06] father to nations but remember he is gr
[2:11:10] aham six letters but a b r8 h am is
[2:11:16] seven letters notice there down there
[2:11:24] even preach him h a.m. and knew that his
[2:11:30] name in h PM and his name has seven
[2:11:34] letters he knew it but never said
[2:11:37] nothing about it why it took spiritual
[2:11:42] revelation for you to understand that he
[2:11:45] was the messenger to abraham see not
[2:11:49] church mama no church spirit job and you
[2:11:55] are Church parrot job always been to
[2:12:00] groups from the days of Cain and Abel
[2:12:02] has been to groups
[2:12:06] two different worship services to
[2:12:10] different churches two different waves
[2:12:12] of worship two different way are they
[2:12:14] offering it to the same God Cain had an
[2:12:20] offering Ava had an offering both going
[2:12:23] to the same God one was accepted the
[2:12:30] other was rejected and the reason a Abel
[2:12:36] could offer way he offered it's because
[2:12:39] he had spiritual revelation and let me
[2:12:43] tell you a flesh and blood did not
[2:12:45] reveal this unto you but my father and
[2:12:49] heaven has revealed this unto you and
[2:12:53] I'm gonna tell you something I'm tell
[2:12:54] you something else when you cast a

[2:13:58] grateful for the word a man that you
[2:14:03] speak to heart
[2:14:05] God what a what a critical hour that we
[2:14:09] live in we've been praying
[2:14:14] we've been lord just gathering together
[2:14:19] and father just seeking your face on
[2:14:24] behalf of our loved ones on behalf of
[2:14:27] our friends Lord and then our desire to
[2:14:29] see them come to truth because the Bible
[2:14:32] say well know the truth and it'll make
[2:14:35] us free so help us God to walk in this
[2:14:37] truth that has been given to us and when
[2:14:40] truth will change us truth will
[2:14:42] transform us truth will will make us
[2:14:45] look like Jesus
[2:14:46] we won't compromise with this word and
[2:14:49] yes there are some things that we do in
[2:14:51] this world look at look at Silas I'm
[2:14:53] inside of him and what lot and his
[2:14:55] daughters and all the things that they
[2:14:56] were doing down there father
[2:14:58] it was wickedness in your sight even
[2:15:01] though they come out and and and and and
[2:15:03] maybe they're not living the homosexual
[2:15:05] lifestyle like the others but look for
[2:15:06] them to come up with the idea that they
[2:15:09] did in order to bring forth children
[2:15:11] those girls look at that look in the
[2:15:14] waiting minds were to even think to do
[2:15:16] something like that with a
[2:15:17] and for the father look at where his
[2:15:19] mind was that he would even do something
[2:15:21] like that
[2:15:22] with his daughters God it shows you the
[2:15:25] wickedness that's in the land today in
[2:15:27] and it's so easy foster to compromise
[2:15:30] and feel like well at least we better
[2:15:33] than this person that's not what you
[2:15:34] called us to to do is be better than
[2:15:36] somebody else you're calling us to be
[2:15:38] Christians we got to be like Christ help
[2:15:43] us to stop the compromising the hours
