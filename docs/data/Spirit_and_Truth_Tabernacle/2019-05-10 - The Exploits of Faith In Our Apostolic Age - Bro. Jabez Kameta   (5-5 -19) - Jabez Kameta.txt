other time and and of the the thing of the sermon so what I did was I put the sermon out there on our church website even though he didn't preach here it's something I think everybody needs to hear that brother from Zambia brother Emmanuel did a wonderful job and I put on the Church website as well as it's under the app if you look underneath um podcast you'll see it there it's titled god holds the key to key to expression and uh all I can say is Go and listen to the message we heard some preaching we heard some preaching and just just a real wonderful anointing and that was there and God God really did something real special amen for us on on that night and I wanted a brother Solomon just to take a moment to kind of share something special that happened and then I got some other things I need to share but uh but you never know when God's gonna move right and I remember I remember on um Saturday we had a picnic last Saturday and uh and I told Brother something so y'all stand up for the combined service tomorrow you say brother I'm just finding out about it right now I said yeah we'll be there found out about Saturday now Palm Bay and they stayed and I want to tell you something there's always a blessing impressive always a bliss always I want him to just kind of share just to bless him from from the service last week [Music] [Applause] [Music] praise the Lord she actually wanted to give the testimony foreign actually about two weeks ago I had to take it to the to the doctor because she was having real bad stomach pains and um she had complaint she was complaining about it for a while and then over three day period it just started getting worse and worse so she was at school one day I had to leave work and go pick up take it to the doctor they did the CAT scan and found out that two weeks no bowel movement it was just there she couldn't go they gave her medicine but barely but then the Lord did something foreign like he's freaking like the brother was preaching and stuff and [Music] he was free tea and so I was like okay okay I was just like I believe what he was saying when I'm just like so when he when brother Jack started singing He's Able that's when I started to believe that I can get healed so I started to like like yesterday my mom was talking about um I was listening to it again on Instagram and when they he got after we were done shaking hand um the octave got higher and so like so I started believing it once I got so far so I closed my eyes and I don't know like I just let go and everything like I started jumping and screaming and then what I like when my eyes were closed there was like a light like it was just white like I could not see anything else but it was just white so I was like okay this is like a couple days later nothing was happening I was not feeling any pain and I can use the bathroom normally [Music] God Is A Healer amen if you never know when you walk into a service like that and you know just what God gonna do and they press their way you know listen but it was a long weekend but they pressed away and God met them there in that service and and all we can say is praise the Lord amen praise the Lord for his healing power amen amen amen amen Well church um uh if you come this morning I want to tell you that if you haven't eat God will meet you here right amen he's more than able to do that amen I just wanted to quickly we have a couple of things that will happen here before we get in the word the Lord has blessed us we got we got two visiting preachers on the same day amen two visiting preachers on the same day and um uh our precious brother Jabez cometa is from Nigeria and he's going to be speaking for us I had the the wonderful privilege of uh preaching with him a couple times we were in Ghana together and we preached and then also we were in Jamaica on last year and we preached together so he was passing through and and we made arrangements for him to stop by and be with us Amen on today and and I know that you'll be blessed by that but we also have brother Gabriel amen with us as well and um uh brother Gabriel's coming to us from Columbia yeah amen and uh just just so International today it just feels so good and I'm so International right Nigeria Colombia hey man where you from brother I'm just messing up myself hey man but uh but it it feels you know just just it's good to have friends amen just just stop by and see you and uh brother Gabriel he's a missionary and he spends a lot of time Amen on the missionary field so I asked him just to come today and just greet us we we know brother Gabriel through brother kwaku and man threw brother quick coup right and and you know God sent brother Quaker here uh via uh Texas but originally from Ghana right and my brother quick oh let me let me also say this while I'm there uh brother quick who the Lord has used this ministry amen mightily he uh he shared many of the testimonies of how God has just healed people underneath this ministry and and different places that he's going and he spent a lot of time in Mexico and and uh and everything like that in some in South America but uh the Lord has uh has blessed him uh and and I think it's going to be June I gotta I got to say this I appreciate this I appreciate this um you all know brother Simba is getting married couple weeks from now we'll be going to the wedding uh but uh brother the quick who had an opportunity to go to Mexico at the same time that we were going to be going to um uh Zimbabwe and and not only his brother Quaker gonna go but going to Mexico the church he's going to he needed an interpreter so God made a way for brother Josue to join brother kwaku on a trip to Mexico has been kind of coordinating everything behind the scenes and and uh you know so brother Quaker and brother Oswego working and then when brother brother Jose called me and told me you know their their imitation and I said Lord It's a Wonderful invitation I don't want to get in the way of it but in my heart I'm like lord it's the wrong weekend because you know it's the weekend I'm gonna be away and I didn't want to tell them that right so brother Josue got with brother Quaker and he told him and he was calling the pastor back he said he asked the pastor could we move the meeting and the Pastor said no it's already planned we can't move nothing so brother Josue got in touch with uh brother quick when he told him everything brother Craig could say tell the pastor we can't come because we got to take care of home first first and you talk about somebody that appreciate that I I say Lord God this is real Health right amen so uh when brother brother Jose you know called back and and was you know letting them know everything brother holster said these are my responsibilities in the church and this is what's going on and this is why we that's a bad weekend can we move it up one week and the past say oh okay I understand now say hold on let me get back with you Cole got the other ministers tickets rearranged right we got their tickets rearranged and looks like we're gonna move it so that we don't conflict with what's going on there at home so I'm appreciative and I want to say that and I'm I'm doing all this but I'm gonna let her brother come but uh brother Gabriel's gonna come in a second but um we haven't taken offer because I want to share some of this um these brothers are going from our church our church and and what the prophet told us that if you can't go help send somebody right because every soul that'll get saved or any person deliver amen God would give it to your account because you actually helped these brothers and you know now uh I'm gonna just be transparent their tickets were only 200 something dollars to it that's that's that's that's not much and and I'm saying that because I want us as a church to take care of their tickets [Applause] that should be something we should be delighted to do and if everybody just said I'm gonna give twenty dollars towards that a 20 I mean I their tickets will be taken care of and all of us would get the blessing and I believe this just beginning of what God want to do so so so I'm I'm asking that you got these envelopes and I don't see it on there but you can write on there just say missions we got we got a special fund for Missions and just put in the envelope and put missions on it if you might say you know what I want to pay for that ticket that's fine if we get extra next time it come up we'll be able to sit them with something is that all right now that's the least we doing as paying for day tickets I'm letting you know that they're going I'm letting you know and Advance they're going so if you feel led hello hello to just say brother I want to give you a little something just to have for some spending money if you feel led to do maybe you ain't never been led to do that pray about it pray about it ask God to lead you to help somebody be a missionary come on somebody so you know we we thank God for what he's doing here in our midst and and we want to be a blessing Amen to our brother so the reason I see don't don't do the offer yet I want to kind of set all these things up because we just normally let's do something abnormal today amen so you can grab yourself an envelope say I just want to be a blessing to those Brothers I want I want I want the Lord to use them in a special way amen I like it when people can go on the field and not worry about they financed that's a beautiful thing amen praise the Lord hallelujah so uh so if you if you say I want to do that today I saw brother Quinn run over there and get some envelopes just lift your hand he'll give you an envelope amen and and you can you can take time to fill that out and I'm gonna let you pray about it while brother brother Gabriel speaking he's a missionary and he's coming just to kind of talk a little bit and why he's speaking you just be praying come on somebody you just be free God know what he's doing let's receive brother Gabriel at this time amen from Colombia glory to God God bless you my precious brother well praise the Lord I'm really really really happy to be in this place this morning uh so brother Jack said I am from Colombia my name is Gabriel my last name is Geraldo uh I was born in in Bogota Colombia South America 1964. you know and I am 55 years old today is the fifth day of the fifth month right I feel really blessed [Applause] I feel wonderful because we know a god of Grace we know a god of Faith you know and the way we move as a missionaries you know we have to move by faith every everywhere that we go I just came from Lavana Cuba Cuba you know where brother Vladimir Raul again the pastor that we pray for this morning got a heart attack this morning I was in his church I was preaching there we had wonderful times in in Cuba you know there is a lot of needs in the people there and of course is is it's a country and a special country they call a revolution okay and it was beautiful I have a great testimonies over there but today I'm really concerned in my heart about brother Vladimir because of his heart attack we don't know yet what happened we know that it's intensive care so keep him in his prayers his lovely lovely lovely Cuban Pastor uh there is a church there there is a brighter on wherever we go in in our missionary work we find beautiful people but I'm really concerned this morning yes to testify about something you know when I was in Uganda in Africa it was my first experience with people of your color and it was something awesome because I found something that I really love from you and I felt it this morning and that's why I decided to talk about it for a while praise the Lord you know all right and is what I call reverence reverence okay uh I am from Colombia we are in Western Country where there is not much reverence about God okay and I see that unfortunate you know because you don't see many miracles when the people are not reverent okay you don't see Faith working through the people you know when they are not reverent about God you know and when I was there in Uganda the pastor that invited me by Pastor Leo Robert from Michiana Uganda okay the first thing that he did he arranged to go to the hospital okay with the with the director of the hospital yes so it was something very strange for me because I was expecting to go to churches first you know but when we arrived to that hospital I noticed that the director of the hospital came all true to say hi to us and to invite us to each one of the his offices you know and he present to us as doctors but not tours of medicine but doctors of Heaven praise the Lord amen so reverence reverence you know the main Doctrine and the director of the hospital in Medina Uganda what they want that was introducing us to all the people that all of his staff that was working with him there you know the administrative people and everybody you know and the last thing that he did he took us were the people that has AIDS you know there was a complete Babylon there you know full of people I I would say so many people you know wow and I didn't know what was going on because you know I was in front of people that I never met before you know I was with this pastor and they have to translate from the English language I speak Spanish of course but they have to translate from the English language you know to the mediana language you know to tell the people the things and the doctor was speaking and his brother was translating for me in English you know and he started saying well he's saying that you guys are doctors from Heaven that you are here because you are going to help them in their souls etc etc you know and I had my backpack put on in my back I had my Bible on you know and I didn't say I didn't say much you know but when the doctor ended my brother turned around and looked at me and I said now what now what and he said he started preaching brother praise the Lord you know so we start preaching we had a service in the Babylon in that hospital with people with AIDS praise the Lord so if the Lord Jesus Christ is the same yesterday it is the same today and he is the same forever there has to be faith in somebody there has to be reverence in someone you know to understand that God is still bailed in people [Music] and we have to notice that today there is a bright beer on Earth I'm not preaching I'm testifying bro praise the Lord you know I get excited when I speak about these things you know amen but there has to be a bride on Earth today yes that's right amen and she is the mouth of God on Earth and he has to speak this word and there has to be people to believe it and there has to be a faith that God will encounter that God will find and that God will respond according to that faith and I truly believe that that is what God is doing these end times brother amen you know we have to wake up amen but uh you know I I felt this morning when I I was back there listening to your songs and to the sisters oh my God remind me Uganda and I understood when I was in Uganda why brother Branham loved you guys so much and why he decided to come back in 1965 we which he couldn't for the reason that God knows but he says I will go to Africa now who said so who's that song amen amen I am the beginning and I am the end those words and the Holy Spirit is visiting Africa to missionaries my brother and the Holy Spirit is working true African people everywhere you go my brother and that's why we see Miracles that's why we see people feel it with the Holy Spirit and that's why we are seeing something else today on the world and God will still doing things in America in Colombia and everywhere where people believe amen that's why we sing only believe only believe only believe we we keep singing we keep singing until one day will happen something like happened with this lady praise the Lord this young lady amen when your faith is in line with the faith of God when the Sixth Sense is aligned completely something Supernatural will happen amen right I love missionary work I do when I go out in missionary field I I get excited everywhere of course you know each charge must have a plan you know to send missionaries to the field because there is still somebody somewhere right that which would be the last one amen I don't know where it's at could be this morning here right you know we think that because we are in the church we are in the church amen yeah do we think so right you know if you were seated there in the predestination seat and you say I am the bride okay I don't want to preach you because I know you have better preachers than me praise the Lord you know but I want to make conscience in the church okay that if you don't have the Holy Ghost if you don't have the Holy Spirit in your soul you're still out of the church even if you are inside the building even if you are seated there if you don't have the Holy Ghost you're still out of the church right amen that's why we need to go sometimes to the basics you know that's right the type of work that we're doing back in Colombia and out of the country you know is I preach all the time about the Holy Spirit because that's the beginning but let me tell you there will be the end also amen because if you get baptized and you start by the new bird praise the Lord that's wonderful but how do you get to the perfect stature of the perfect man all right amen without Divine love in yourself and that's the work of the holy spirit in your life amen so what we do in our missionary work we have 10 months per year that's what we're doing today okay and we're spending one week per month one week per month with people that are seeking the Holy Ghost amen people that doesn't understand about these things we keep preaching preaching preaching until they understand what they have to do for that change in their lives okay and we open a week we we don't open in certain way we looked the the guidance of the Holy Ghost okay until he confirms this week okay and we tell the people we will open this week so let's pray about it you know until they feel the call and when they feel the call when they feel the call is not the call of a person is the call of the Holy Ghost amen and when they get in that situation they spend a complete week until they receive the Holy Ghost even if we have to spend more than a week we do it of course you know because we don't know what the Lord needs to do in the heart of the person until the Lord himself you know appears in the scene and he starts showing what the people needs okay until everything is taken out of the way that person gets baptized in in the in the fire departments of the Holy Spirit praise the Lord amen so we are working on that really hard really hard because it's hard to stay awake or sometimes more than that you know with a person or with a few people you know during all that time we're ministering them in different ways listening tapes of programs even preaching to them seeing in songs you know sometimes praying you know like the word of God says you know you have to wait until something happens amen so we keep doing that besides that well I translate sermons of brother Abraham to the Spanish language in simultaneous way for the people to listen you know in congregation or even to Listen by themselves in their houses you know but simultaneously no lapse it like a boys who got recording does we are not competing with them we're doing just our own work okay and we just put that in the hands of the people that is something that God letters us to do some years ago and it has been a blessing I am really surprised that their work is being used in Argentina in Chile for example in Venezuela in Mexico even here in the United States it's something awesome even in in in some places really far from us you know New Zealand for example okay not many but people are listening I'm very surprised that number seven in the list is Japan and you say in Japan yeah there has to be somebody there praise the Lord there has to be a group of Spanish people there for sure that are downloading the material and are using it praise the

Mexico so keep us in your prayers please okay this is just a short a short testimony okay but the Lord told us that when you receive the Holy Ghost you will have thirst and hunger for those lost souls right amen when I go out in the streets and I see somebody from another denomination I don't judge them right right you know because the Holy Spirit when it comes to your heart does not judge the Lord didn't judge you know even as the word says also judge all things you know but you have to judge it with it with it with a true balance you know what I mean of course you know but don't judge the people the feel compassion for the people right amen because if you don't remember let me remember you this morning that you were a blind person also that you were lost also like all of us all of us we were blind but God used somebody to come to your life yeah you know to tell you there is a truth somewhere yeah amen I know that truth didn't come to you because you deserve it amen that that came to you because of the grace of God Amen and I truly believe that this is the time to rescue that last Soul where I don't know where it is like I said could be this morning in this place that person needs to receive the Holy Ghost and that will be it amen because that is a true a true a conversion amen the true conversion doesn't come when you say I want to serve the Lord or I want to oh Jesus you know that that is not the true conversion the true conversion comes when you are baptized in the fire baptism of the Holy Ghost amen so I just want to finish with this of course it's not it's not mine it's probably brand names okay number one on one it says long as God's got a People God's got a church God's got the Holy Ghost marching with it that's what God gave the Holy Ghost for intellectuals will rise of course always have right amen but God's got a minority somewhere minority doesn't say minority praise the Lord amen God's got a little church where is that little church what is that little church brother hey praise the Lord many are called but just a few are chosen my brother amen God's got a little church that will move right on with the baptisms of the Holy Ghost

we we started uh last year uh that we wanted to raise some money and start you know get into a place where we can get our own church and we believe in God for that uh we believe in God for something incredible amen uh we talk about something that man can't do only God can do we believe him for that and one of these days y'all gonna walk right in and sit in this in the new church and amen you're going to see the new school we we walking into that and I'm claiming amen not many days since right that's what I'm claiming but what we what we did we pledged we made pledges actually we voted that

get 56 809 towards that hundred and five thousand uh received of that 56 000 received year-to-date is 10 841.13 uh so we thank God for that foreign to this little update is you'll see an interest column so the money that we have received we have placed in the bank in order to gain some interest right and we've made 81.65 in interest I am still a good good numbers we have not used any of that money for anything else right but for the building fund so no transfers have happened we've been able to keep the money where it needs to be so when it's time to purchase we'll be ready to purchase amen amen amen so our net uh this uh so far that we have accumulated this year is 10 922.78 and we thank God for that so let's give God praise one more time as you saw our goal was 105 000 pledges for 56 000. if you would like to pledge to help us reach that goal of 105 000 there's these little forms there on the table as you're going out and if you would just want to further attack we want to be a part of that we want to give a one-time pledge do you want to do something monthly amen we'll receive it in Jesus name and and we pray that God will bless you uh uh for trying to help us get there but we we are under expectation for something really really great and and I believe everybody that's a part of it God will bless them amen especially amen for that so keep us in prayer uh if you don't do any more keep us in prayer because we we really are under expectation for God to do something we actually got our eyes on a piece of property right now amen amen [Applause] right now I'm the type of person believe that if you just give God two fish and give them five loaves of bread right that he can take that yes he can bypass some process and multiply your fish and your bread so he can take my ten thousand and make it a million that's the God that I serve Hallelujah so all we're going to do is what we can and God's gonna do the rest amen we trusting to the rest and even what I am able to do

chapter 11. um Joe chapter 1. mark 16. we take it from verse 14. from verse 14. so after all they appeared on to the 11th as they sat at Mid and not break them with their own belief and Hardness of Heart because they believe not them which had seen him after he was risen so you you see that God always wanted to believe the testimony of true weakness right amen so and he said unto them going into all the war and preach the gospel to every creature and he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved and he that believeth not shall be done right and and this science shall follow them to believe right amen not them the priests amen this sign is not following the preachers amen Jesus never said the preachers he said but this sign shall follow them that believe he's a Believer to have the sign following them Hallelujah praise God all right so in my name they shall Caster Devils yes and they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up sabbaths and if they drank any deadly thing it shall not hurt them and they shall lay hand on the sick and the sick shall recover right right so then after the Lord has spoken unto them he was still it was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of God and they went forth precious and preached everywhere the Lord walking with them and confirming his word the word with signs following amen Done Yet 11 31 and 32 Danny 11. 31 32 say an arms shall stand on his path and they shall they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength and shall take away the daily sacrifice and shall place the uh shall place the Abomination that make it desolate and such as though wickedly against the Covenant shall be corrupt by flatteries but the people that don't know their God shall be strong and shall do exploit Hallelujah then George chapter 1 verse 3 is that beloved when I give all diligent to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exalt you that issue aimlessly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints that Lord add blessed to his word in our heart in Jesus name never seen it so I want to take a title uh this morning I would like to speak briefly on the exploit of faith in our Apostolic age amen the exploit of faith in our Apostolic age because I believe that we are living in Apocalypse Apostolic times right amen I believe that we are living in Apostolic age with Apostolic power Apostolic Doctrine and Apostolic science following the church Hallelujah so because Pentecost should not cease in the church and the cosmos always remain in the church Hallelujah if I'm God if you find Healing as not God so the blessings must still remain in the church Hallelujah so I want to read a contest scripture here in Saint John Saint John chapter 12 for the Conte description Amen to begin the message he said and there we're setting Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast and came therefore to Philip which was advertising of Galilee and desired him same son we will see Jesus Hallelujah and Philip come out and tell Andrew and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus so friends notice that the Greek came to meet the disciples Hallelujah because they know that it takes a disciple right Amen to take it to Jesus hallelujah amen and when they come between disciples they were looking for Jesus amen they're not looking for are looking for Peter no sir they never asked for Peter right they are looking for John they are not looking for gems amen they were disciples but they said sir we will see Jesus Hallelujah I believe that the desire of everyone again believer every born-again Christian that ever heard about him they will always want to see him Hallelujah they come to church to see him right right yes they don't come to church to see one another that's right though it is good to see one another Hallelujah they don't come to church to see the pastor or to sit and dig it but they come to church so see him hallelujah praise God in the duty and the duty of every true minister of God not to bring the people to himself amen yet the people are to believe on the medicine in order for the minister to help them praise God hallelujah let the minister is to bring them to Jesus because it's the object of adoration in the update of worship so every True Believer of in Christ is ordained of God to bring the people to Jesus Christ that is what the word of see him in action and I believe that's how we're here this morning we come to church to see him we come to church to meet him we come to talk to receive from him Hallelujah and his son is angels in charge Amen to give the people the minister to their needs yes for he gave them Ministry Spirit to minister to the hands of salvation a minister for the hands of Salvation amen oh Hallelujah and I believe that the acts of Salvation are here this morning I believe that here this morning yes sir as long as you're here angels are here right right right the spirit is here amen amen praise the Lord so now because Apostle Paul said yeah yeah same here in First Corinthians chapter 4 he was saying that the kingdom of God Amen which we preach is not in word only right amen he knows what the minister is commissioned to do amen I know what the people are to expect so for the kingdom of God which we preach amen is not in words only right and the prophet said is the duty of the minister to bring the kingdom of God to the people hallelujah amen and then to bring the people to the kingdom and this money we are entering the kingdom praise God to take all our intempted blessings amen amen we're not going to put it up to another day amen I'll put it for some some days ahead remember we're taking it now because now Faith is amen hallelujah so the kingdom of God is not in what only but it's in power also in power amen demonstration of the holy spirit that your faith might not lean upon the wisdom of man or the intentional ability of man to fall worse right no praise God in the power and the demonstration of the holy spirit amen amen amen and that is how to make the gospel preach remember the gospel is not in what only the gospel is a demonstriction is to see God in action [Applause] Hallelujah and that's what we are here this morning we want to see God in action amen praise the Lord so you know this is Greeks amen and the prophet saying here is that the Greeks we just across type of people that came to look for Jesus said Paul I believe it was said a Greek sick wisdom amen and the Jews seek for science when the Greeks seek for wisdom so when they come designing to see Jesus amen they will not desire to see to receive miracles they want to hear the wisdom of God right right right that's right praise the Lord I believe that's how some people are in church he just come to church so they come with the need to church and they go back home with a need from church and it's not supposed to be so because it's there to meet their needs praise God and that is the duty of Jesus is to meet the need of the people in other words you have no right to go home without need amen hallelujah I don't care what the problem is I don't care what that student is amen that is what the church is meant for hallelujah it's meant to meet the need of the people hallelujah I don't care how much you are bound I don't care what you find yourself praise God I don't care what frustration it is every church is made for that yes it's where Jesus can be the need of the people [Applause] in my map I will be in your midst Hallelujah so we're going to find him here and if I to find him here then we find him in a way of meeting our needs amen glory so the Greeks seek wisdom amen amen amen they have to kill him up how is able to withstand the Pharisees praise God so so that is that is the manner of people today right some just want to come to church and my daughter to see a sign amen but they are not particular of the sign amen that is the attitude of every every Greeks that is here right now right praise God Amen and the Jews just throw me aside just showed me a sign praise God but a True Believer is not showing me a sign but the True Believers are the sign [Applause] that's what Jesus said from me and the children are given unto me we are for Science and wonders oh I am for a sign for God perform his word through the Believers amen amen God perform his word through the Believers not the unbelievers they come to stare at you praise God and take the signs for entertainment that is what the unbelievers does I am the sign yes sir I'm the one to make this to happen I came to church not to see this happen when I come to church to be the one that peace will happen to [Music] me Hallelujah amen why because this Jesus amen is not an historical God thank you Jesus Hallelujah it's not an historical God that's right awesome God that came down to work in the form of man all right praise God that we cannot stand and then sing say all done from his glory have a living story my God and my savior came Jesus what his name that was that is very fine praise God Amen to sing about Jesus in a manger that is very fine that Jesus had raised up and went to heaven that is very fine praise God but that is not what he said he said I will never leave you comfortless and that word confirmness and often is I will never leave you an orphan praise God you will not be an orphan but I will come with you I will come to be with you and not only to be with you I am come to live in you [Applause] [Music] amen so and my contention is this amen William Brown was speaking the message on A God Called man he was saying here that my contention is this Emir that Jesus Christ remained the same yesterday today and forever amen and give you the same it got to be the same in every principle this the same in everything that he was right when he was on Earth Here amen praise God that when the Greek came to sit we will see Jesus Hallelujah so when the Greek came to say we will see Jesus and they want to see him and I believe that the desire of every believer on the earth amen every true child of God on the earth they want to see him praise God hallelujah a woman Every Man a woman that ever heard of Jesus they want to see him amen if he isn't the same then we cannot see him if it's not the same then we cannot see him Hallelujah but it is the same as it was then then we can see him yes sir amen ah he taught us something wrong a little while we see me no more right amen the one won't send me no more but he shall see me yes amen I will be with you and even in you to the end of the age right then Jesus promised to be in his church amen today right now doing the same thing that he did that until the age end yes sir amen praise the Lord hallelujah and it said a little while they won't send me no more I'll see you wherever you will see me so well then how could we see him how could we see him who have to see his spirits if he is in us then that spirit will have to do the same thing yes sir amen that he did that or it won't be the same Spirit Hallelujah for he said he said John chapter 15 that I am Divine I hear the branches and if we bear

Catholic Branch it was a Pentecostal Branch yes sir amen praise God the hard visions that Branch they have visions they have powers they have healings they have the baptism of the Holy Spirit hallelujah amen they have the assaulted God associated with the people amen with great signs and wonders and then the next Branch will have to have the same thing kind of kind of Branch Amen on down to the end it have to be the same thing that's what Jesus said amen do you believe that that's what Jesus said so I said I'm the vine and you are the branches and the branch Barefoot fruits and the vine the vine and the vine uh the branch beer for fruits the vine and the vine energizes the branch oh praise God I like that amen so if I'm the branch I expect the vine to energize me immature amen

Vine or next branch that come out of that vine we have to grab fruit on it in the first touch that Comfort out of the vine was a Pentecostal church with all the gifts of the Spirit Hallelujah in that
