[18:40] speaking with sister Lydia before and I
[18:44] wanted her to come and give a testimony
[18:46] if you will come at this time sister
[18:49] [Music]
[18:54] [Music]
[19:12] [Music]
[19:16] God bless you all
[19:18] to
[19:19] I'm just trying to get my bearing so I
[19:21] don't cry
[19:46] I want to thank God this morning for who
[19:48] he is
[19:50] God is truly truly amazing
[19:53] he's an awesome awesome father there's
[19:56] not words enough to describe who God is
[20:00] last year in November
[20:04] I had a fall
[20:06] and what I thought was just a simple
[20:09] fall I was going to sit
[20:11] and what I thought was a simple fall
[20:13] turned out to be very very bad
[20:16] I was in so much pain that I could
[20:18] hardly walk at times I mean I was trying
[20:21] to do everything that I had to do still
[20:23] but it was not easy it was very very
[20:26] very difficult
[20:28] the pain got so bad it was really really
[20:31] bad that I could hardly walk at times
[20:34] there are days actually that I could not
[20:36] walk
[20:39] so I had been to the doctor
[20:41] um they did a series of tests they did
[20:44] MRIs more than one CT scans whatever
[20:49] and so they sent me
[20:51] to do treatment because they discovered
[20:54] that I due to the fall that I had three
[20:57] or more herniated discs in my back two
[21:00] of which are the major discs they said
[21:03] and one was a bulging disc
[21:08] there was a lot of inflammation as far
[21:11] as I understand
[21:12] and so it was really hard to tell you
[21:16] how bad it was
[21:18] can't describe it and I mean I would be
[21:20] crying out to God brother jaram and I
[21:22] would be praying I didn't tell it we
[21:24] didn't tell it to anybody really
[21:26] actually at First a very few people knew
[21:29] about it except Pastor Jack your
[21:32] brothers and sister are candy sisters
[21:34] brother Stanley knew about it we didn't
[21:37] really tell it to anybody I told him I
[21:39] said sometimes when you're going through
[21:40] stuff
[21:41] you just want people to stand in faith
[21:44] with you you don't want everybody to
[21:45] know sometimes it's not good to do a
[21:47] whole lot of talking you know you have
[21:49] to limit what you say you know
[21:53] I believe that because sometimes the
[21:56] enemy could take things and and I don't
[21:59] you know
[22:01] so I said okay he said
[22:04] um we know that Pastor Jack and your
[22:06] brothers have been praying thank you so
[22:08] much God bless you all sister Erica and
[22:10] his sisters brother Stanley thank you my
[22:13] husband stood with me the ideas I would
[22:16] try to do stuff I would be in the
[22:17] kitchen trying to cook and I could
[22:19] hardly move I'd be leaning over the
[22:21] kitchen sink and screaming with pain and
[22:24] if he had to cook his way of cooking his
[22:27] I'll just buy food that's my way of
[22:29] cooking
[22:30] so
[22:35] I would try to sit in the vehicle
[22:39] if I had to come out of the vehicle I
[22:41] couldn't get out on my own I needed help
[22:43] to sit in the vehicle I needed help to
[22:45] go up the stairs I needed help
[22:47] everything I had to do I needed help
[22:51] but we I didn't give up on God
[22:55] I kept trusting God and saying Lord why
[22:58] is this happening I don't understand but
[23:00] then I said you know what Lord you
[23:02] created this body so because you created
[23:05] this body you are able to fix this body
[23:08] or we've been treating twice a week by
[23:10] the doctor every week every week
[23:13] sometimes I really did not even want to
[23:15] go
[23:16] you know and it got to the point where
[23:19] the doctor said this is so bad you'll
[23:21] never get better not even God could help
[23:23] you
[23:26] when he said that
[23:30] he hurt my mouth and healed brother John
[23:32] I'm smart and I was like never I said
[23:36] God is more than able I have experienced
[23:40] them before and you'll do what I get he
[23:43] said no no but let me retry I said no
[23:45] God is able so my husband had to give
[23:48] him a long letter lecture I thought he
[23:50] was going to preach to the doctor that
[23:51] morning you know and
[23:54] you know what is amazing after that that
[23:58] same doctor two weeks after called us
[24:00] and he said would you keep my in-law in
[24:03] prayer she's very ill the same Doctor
[24:05] Who said not even God can help you
[24:08] called us for prayer
[24:10] I was like wow
[24:13] he said okay we need to send you to this
[24:16] surgeon no
[24:18] surgery I said Lord I don't want to do
[24:21] any surgery because three years ago when
[24:24] I had this surgery it was a really bad
[24:26] experience
[24:28] I stopped reading and I'm alive today
[24:30] because of difficult because of the
[24:32] goodness of God
[24:34] so I said I don't want to do that alone
[24:36] that is not an option for me and I keep
[24:41] talking to God in my heart praying the
[24:43] Lord will bring songs that comfort me
[24:45] and stuff like that anyways we went to
[24:47] the sir General he said this is just for
[24:50] a consultation the first visit said okay
[24:52] when I when we got there she was a she
[24:55] was ready to put needles into my spine I
[24:58] said no
[24:59] so she looked at me she was not too
[25:01] happy
[25:01] I said I'm not doing that I'm not
[25:03] prepared to do that today
[25:06] he tried to convince us
[25:08] you know that we should do it you know
[25:11] it is going to help so brother Jaya
[25:13] Master well then
[25:14] what are the benefits of doing that she
[25:17] said
[25:18] well she went like um he said how long
[25:22] does that last does that take the pain
[25:24] away she said there's no guarantee
[25:26] people have died from it people were
[25:29] paralyzed from it
[25:31] he said would that touch bone when you
[25:33] go in that deep into her spine she said
[25:36] well there's no guarantee it would not
[25:38] and I'm just listening to her and I'm
[25:41] saying Lord I'm not doing that she got
[25:42] to be crazy I'm not doing this in my
[25:45] mind
[25:47] okay and I'm having a conversation with
[25:50] going in my mind I was like I'm not
[25:52] doing this Lord
[25:55] so she said let's schedule another
[25:56] appointment for next week you'll do it
[25:58] next week
[25:59] I said I'll think about it when I left
[26:01] there I said Lord is this something you
[26:04] want me to do
[26:05] I said if it is Lord it is very scary
[26:08] but if it's something you want to take
[26:10] me to I'll do it if it is not I'm not
[26:12] doing it
[26:14] we went back the next week she was ready
[26:16] to do the same thing this one was a
[26:18] little different where they go further
[26:21] into your spine said let's see the
[26:23] procedure room so I look at the
[26:26] procedure room no problem he said he was
[26:29] not going to look at it
[26:32] then she brought in
[26:34] other people to convince us
[26:36] that we should do this I said I'm still
[26:39] not doing this today
[26:40] she looked at me like
[26:42] you must be crazy
[26:44] I was like no I I'm still not prepared
[26:47] so brother John said listen okay we'll
[26:51] talk to the surgeon since they insisted
[26:53] we'll talk to the surgeon let's hear
[26:55] what he have to say and so we'll decide
[26:59] from there well of course they did not
[27:01] want us to see the surgeon write her
[27:05] because she insisted that I do a series
[27:06] of injections into my spine about three
[27:09] different types each going further into
[27:12] your spine
[27:14] but of course she said it would only
[27:16] last for one day
[27:19] so we said
[27:21] met with the surgeon
[27:25] and I totally Lord that morning and I
[27:27] was really nervous I said Lord I don't
[27:29] want to do this I don't want to go there
[27:31] today I wish I did not have to go there
[27:33] today I said do you have any Christian
[27:36] doctors out there
[27:38] I said I have not seen one yet with this
[27:41] whole situation
[27:43] a better time said we go in we're going
[27:45] to listen to what you have to say
[27:48] of course he asks us questions and the
[27:51] first doctor she had someone from her
[27:54] staff with these surgeons standing in
[27:56] the back maybe just to hear what you
[27:58] have to say or whatever
[28:00] but I want to say thank God because I
[28:03] know everybody's been praying and when
[28:05] he had that last parameter with the
[28:07] brothers he came and he said
[28:09] he said we you know God did it that I
[28:12] believe God did it I said okay he said
[28:14] you should have heard how they cried out
[28:16] for you
[28:18] every day from that point he would be
[28:20] asking and I know these sisters were
[28:22] praying are you in pain no are you in
[28:25] pain in the next thing no I even did I
[28:27] was like you need to stop asking me if
[28:29] I'm in pain
[28:31] but till then to know I want to see God
[28:36] is good I stand heal completely heal in
[28:39] the name of Jesus
[28:41] [Applause]
[28:45] all the glory the under the praise be
[28:48] unto God when we met with that surgeon
[28:51] the doctor actually did not even take
[28:54] the MRI discs and look at them I said
[28:57] don't you want to see them she said no
[28:59] no that won't be necessary I have the
[29:01] report I have people to look at
[29:03] so we were confused by that we said well
[29:06] but you could look at this you know
[29:09] decision said can I see the disc
[29:11] we gave it to him when he came in they
[29:14] said he's a tough man from what I
[29:16] understood he was the nicest nicest man
[29:19] I said he have to know Jesus the way he
[29:22] presented himself the way he spoke and
[29:24] he was like did you do any of the
[29:26] injections I said no he went like
[29:29] so the guy was standing back maybe he
[29:32] didn't want the other guy from the
[29:34] doctors or first doctor's office to see
[29:37] that was his hint to me not to do that
[29:39] he said oh and brother jerem asked him
[29:42] did you see this he said yes
[29:44] he said you know what you're going to
[29:46] live there's no need for surgery I don't
[29:48] see any need for surgery yet I don't
[29:51] know this that I had
[29:55] was the same report they gave in people
[29:57] but I guess it was not corresponding
[30:00] anymore whatever God did
[30:03] All To His glory
[30:08] but I want to say this to also the Lord
[30:10] reminded me of a dream that he gave me I
[30:13] know with all the prayer going up
[30:15] I heard in my dream you will see a
[30:18] miracle and I want to thank God
[30:21] [Applause]

[38:57] started with uh a burden that my my wife
[39:00] had in her heart and um she mentioned it
[39:03] to me and you know and and she would
[39:06] want just invite the sisters to get
[39:07] together and just pray about things and
[39:08] I want to say that's been over
[39:11] eight nine years ago and uh she she
[39:15] asked me just to uh you know could they
[39:17] get together and I said yeah that'd be
[39:19] great and they was doing it for a few
[39:21] years and uh next thing you know I said
[39:24] well we Brothers man we ain't doing
[39:25] nothing
[39:27] so we jumped up and we took the other
[39:30] Tuesday every other Tuesday night we
[39:32] took the sisters do first and third
[39:34] Brothers do second and fourth but we get
[39:36] in there and we just pray about
[39:37] different things and God is God has
[39:39] certainly been answering our prayer so
[39:42] we're grateful for that this Friday is
[39:44] First Friday of the month and uh
[39:46] typically first Friday month we always
[39:48] have a tape that we encourage uh
[39:51] everybody to listen to a man whether in
[39:54] your home or wherever but take Friday
[39:56] and try to listen to the tape and it's a
[39:58] hidden life in Christ this is the date
[40:01] 55 uh I guess it's 0 11 there must be
[40:07] something missing there on that date uh
[40:10] but uh it's hidden life in Chrysler to
[40:12] be in November of 55. all right uh don't
[40:16] forget your the time is changing this
[40:19] Saturday and we go back one hour we fall
[40:21] back so we will be looking forward to
[40:24] that also our upcoming meetings we have
[40:27] have um December 2nd through 4th
[40:32] Sarasota brother Stephen will be

[40:49] we do have a couple Services coming up
[40:51] in the month of December brother Diggs
[40:54] is going to be coming to visit us and uh

[41:00] Friday night and on a Sunday morning and
[41:03] just before brother Diggs come on that
[41:05] Wednesday night brother Paula Fontaine

[41:24] lineup coming Amen in December and we're
[41:27] looking forward to all God guidance

[41:46] the ministers are going to speak I I try
[41:48] not to just give them a short notice
[41:51] like brother brother Quake who scheduled

[49:30] I prayed I said well Lord I'ma just
[49:32] leave it open you give it to me at the
[49:35] last minute and he just did
[49:37] okay amen
[49:39] we're going to read
[49:41] uh from this first verse of uh Second
[49:45] Kings
[49:46] the seventh chapter then Elijah said
[49:50] hear ye the word of the Lord thus saith
[49:53] the Lord tomorrow about this time shall
[49:56] a measure a fine flower be sold
[49:58] and a shekel
[50:00] and two measures of barley for a shekel
[50:05] in the gate of Samaria then it then
[50:10] a lord whose hand then a lord on Whose
[50:15] hand the king leaned answered the man of
[50:19] God and said behold if the Lord
[50:22] would make Windows in heaven might this
[50:25] thing be and he said behold
[50:27] Thou shalt see it with thine eyes but
[50:32] shalt not eat thereof and there were
[50:35] four lepers men at
[50:38] the entering of the gate
[50:41] and they said one to another
[50:43] why sit we here
[50:46] until we die
[50:48] and I want to move on down to the eighth
[50:52] verse
[50:54] and then the lepers came to the
[50:57] uttermost part of the camp
[50:59] they went into the tent
[51:02] and did eat and drink
[51:05] and carry this for silver gold and
[51:07] Raymond and went and hit it and came
[51:10] again and entered into another tent and
[51:13] carried dents also and went and hit it

[52:02] all right in his head
[52:06] he's always trying to find out what's
[52:09] ahead of him

[52:15] what's the next move shall I make
[52:18] where
[52:20] do I go from here
[52:23] it's like a man crossing a stream
[52:26] he steps on a rock and he looks around
[52:29] to see
[52:30] where his next step shall be
[52:34] for he doesn't he just can't just jump
[52:37] anywhere
[52:40] and if he does he'll drown himself
[52:43] he must Swatch where he go
[52:47] after I cross
[52:49] this then where
[52:53] all of us
[52:55] are that way
[52:56] that's been The Cry of the human race
[52:59] down Through the Ages
[53:02] where
[53:03] from here
[53:05] I'd like to title this message as I say

[53:41] back the emotions O Lord
[53:44] seeing that it's so late in the hour
[53:46] Lord and
[53:47] uh Lord and the world is just falling
[53:52] apart Lord

[53:56] hearts of the people Lord
[53:58] those that are present here in the
[54:01] building those that are online Lord hide
[54:03] me behind the cross so father God that

[54:38] amen uh he learned an answer that there
[54:42] was a a a a a a famine

[54:50] and we find that a lot of times in the
[54:53] scripture when God want to get people to
[54:55] move a man he he allows a famine to take
[55:00] place
[55:01] amen and the mess in in the scripture
[55:05] there in Amos I think it's Amos for he
[55:08] said in this day that there is a famine
[55:11] there'll be a famine not for bread not
[55:14] for water but a famine for the word of
[55:18] God
[55:19] amen
[55:22] so uh to those that are hungry there
[55:25] should be a search amen for food in this
[55:29] hour
[55:30] amen we want to uh if you go with me to
[55:34] Luke the 15th chapter
[55:37] and unless uh
[55:41] take our
[55:44] message starting from near
[55:49] we'll see it kind of tie together here
[55:58] man
[56:09] Amen in Luke 15 11 says here Ace certain
[56:13] man
[56:15] had two sons
[56:17] and the younger of them
[56:20] said to his father
[56:22] give me the portion of goods that
[56:26] falleth to me
[56:28] and he divided unto them his living
[56:33] and not many days after the younger son
[56:35] gathered all together and took his
[56:38] journey into a far country and there
[56:42] wasted his substance with riotous living
[56:47] and when he had spent all their a rose
[56:51] here we go a mighty famine in the land
[56:56] and he began to be in want
[57:00] and
[57:02] he went and joined himself
[57:06] to a citizen of another country
[57:11] and he sent him into the fields
[57:15] to feed
[57:17] with the swine now let's let's let's
[57:19] just hold right there
[57:22] we see this this story of popular story
[57:24] called The Prodigal Son
[57:29] now it's called The Prodigal Son but
[57:32] it's a story about two sons
[57:38] I I I'm on a uh uh bring to you today
[57:42] to show you a man that that that that
[57:46] that that there is a revelation in that
[57:50] the first son
[57:52] and the same son is the same son
[57:57] Stay With Me
[58:00] I want to
[58:04] show you here
[58:06] Let's uh I don't want to get ahead of
[58:08] myself I want you to take let's go back
[58:10] to job
[58:12] the first chapter
[58:14] and and we're gonna we're gonna work
[58:16] with this a little bit so bear with me
[58:19] I I I want to build a bridge so that you
[58:22] can get to where I'm at
[58:24] amen
[58:27] now there was a day when the sons of God
[58:32] came
[58:34] to the to present themselves before the
[58:37] Lord
[58:38] and Satan came or Saint came also among
[58:42] them
[58:43] and this lord said unto Satan which
[58:46] cometh Style
[58:49] then Satan answered the Lord and said
[58:52] from going to and from the earth and and
[58:55] from walking up and down it and the Lord
[58:58] said unto Satan has thou considered my
[59:02] servant job
[59:04] that there is none like him in Earth
[59:08] a perfect and an upright man
[59:13] and one that fears God and assures evil
[59:18] then Satan answered
[59:21] and he said doeth
[59:23] job fear God not fear not has Thou made
[59:29] a hedge about him and about his house
[59:32] and about all that he has on every side
[59:37] thou has blessed the work of his hands
[59:40] and his substance in increase in land
[59:44] so we know the story amen uh God gave
[59:48] him he said he can go home but his soul
[59:52] belongs to me
[59:54] amen
[59:55] uh now we see here we're going to go
[59:59] back to Genesis
[1:00:01] and we see that in job here I'm sorry in
[1:00:05] job here
[1:00:06] he was talking about his sons
[1:00:10] that went to the presence of the Lord
[1:00:13] and here in in in in in in in in in in
[1:00:15] Luke Jesus was talking about amen this
[1:00:20] man that had two sons
[1:00:23] speaking about the one song that wanted
[1:00:26] all of his inheritance and uh uh wanted
[1:00:29] to go his own way
[1:00:31] now let's go we see in Genesis God
[1:00:35] amen came down and uh he desired
[1:00:40] to have a son
[1:00:44] but before amen he can do that he had to
[1:00:48] prepare
[1:00:49] a place
[1:00:55] uh there's a message here
[1:00:58] the prophet said I don't
[1:01:00] I hope I don't make myself sacrilegious
[1:01:03] by calling God Papa
[1:01:05] but I want to say in that way
[1:01:10] so you'll understand it
[1:01:12] Papa wanted some children
[1:01:16] now I'm gonna tie this thing down so
[1:01:18] y'all don't think I just done lost my
[1:01:20] mind
[1:01:22] so what he did
[1:01:24] he said let there be angels
[1:01:28] and there came around him
[1:01:31] he said oh that's fine
[1:01:33] they worshiped him
[1:01:35] then he was God
[1:01:39] but you have to understand
[1:01:41] he just he he he would want it to be
[1:01:44] worshiped as God but he had attributes
[1:01:49] that he wanted to display
[1:01:52] amen he wanted to be a savior
[1:01:58] he wanted to be a Healer
[1:02:01] but he had no one to save
[1:02:04] and he had no one to heal
[1:02:07] to display his glory
[1:02:10] to reveal who he who he really is on the
[1:02:13] inside
[1:02:15] you find when a man amen has uh children
[1:02:19] has a wife he wants to be their hero
[1:02:23] yeah he wants to show a man that I got
[1:02:28] you nothing to worry about
[1:02:32] I'm going to take care of everything
[1:02:36] you don't have to worry amen I got you
[1:02:42] now we see that remember he was Elohim
[1:02:47] the self-existing one nothing but him
[1:02:51] the first thing came around was the
[1:02:53] angels and the angels could do no more
[1:02:56] than worship
[1:02:58] but they couldn't be lost
[1:03:01] they couldn't be sick they were Immortal
[1:03:05] beings
[1:03:06] so he couldn't display all of his
[1:03:09] healing power and attributes
[1:03:12] so we know the story there in Genesis
[1:03:14] where they came long and God created
[1:03:18] this beautiful kingdom
[1:03:21] amen he created this beautiful place
[1:03:25] there
[1:03:26] amen for his children
[1:03:32] amen
[1:03:36] I want to get to a place here where I
[1:03:39] can bring you right up and show you
[1:03:42] what I'm talking about here
[1:03:45] now he he he he he he built the kingdom
[1:03:48] amen so what happened is
[1:03:50] amen
[1:03:52] they begin we see that through uh the
[1:03:57] serpent
[1:03:58] amen through Eve
[1:04:00] uh uh there was a fallen away
[1:04:05] amen
[1:04:06] we know the story they they sinned
[1:04:09] against God
[1:04:11] amen and and and and and and and and
[1:04:13] uh some things happen
[1:04:16] amen
[1:04:18] so they they lost their inheritance
[1:04:22] so this directly coincides a man with
[1:04:27] Luke uh uh when the the son who had it
[1:04:30] all
[1:04:31] who had everything there in the garden
[1:04:35] this son asked to say give me my portion
[1:04:38] amen that I may go when riotous living
[1:04:43] so we see here in Genesis that you know
[1:04:46] he didn't ask for it but the same thing
[1:04:48] happened amen so it started out Amen in
[1:04:53] a place there he had nothing to worry
[1:04:55] about Papa God had everything under
[1:04:58] control amen he had his inheritance but
[1:05:01] he wanted to he didn't want to but
[1:05:03] circumstances God already knew a man
[1:05:07] that that this would happen
[1:05:11] yeah
[1:05:13] now
[1:05:15] he had lost
[1:05:17] where he once was
[1:05:19] now what I want to get you to understand
[1:05:21] is that son
[1:05:23] that prodigal son is you and I
[1:05:28] because we lost our inheritance
[1:05:32] but we see that that that that that that
[1:05:35] that God Amen had already had a plan to
[1:05:39] redeem us back into the kingdom
[1:05:43] back to our inheritance
[1:05:46] so we see this Prodigal Son
[1:05:49] amen being you and I amen now now stay
[1:05:53] with me now we're we're we're here also
[1:05:56] in Genesis where the son that was a
[1:05:58] fallen away
[1:06:01] amen but God never stopped loving his
[1:06:05] son
[1:06:06] amen he had already made a way for him
[1:06:10] to come back home
[1:06:15] God had already made a way because you
[1:06:19] see you have to understand that in the
[1:06:22] see before God created all of that
[1:06:25] there was a thought in his mind
[1:06:30] and the thought became word and then the
[1:06:33] thought the word became a manifestation
[1:06:37] so the thought that he had in his mind
[1:06:41] amen
[1:06:43] was you and I oh
[1:06:47] the thought that he had in his mind amen
[1:06:50] was his great family of God
[1:06:55] he had a desire amen not only to be
[1:06:59] worshiped but he had a desire for his
[1:07:01] attributes to be displayed
[1:07:05] and his children
[1:07:08] and his children
[1:07:10] now no doubt this uh prodigal son his
[1:07:14] father had the same desires
[1:07:17] to see his attributes and and his things
[1:07:21] passed on to his son
[1:07:25] but this younger son
[1:07:29] uh uh he had other ideas
[1:07:34] just like children have today
[1:07:37] sometimes you you you you just can't uh
[1:07:40] you try to tell them things
[1:07:43] and and they want to go their own way
[1:07:46] I want to experience it for myself
[1:07:49] so we see Adam and Eve begin to
[1:07:52] experience some things for themselves
[1:07:56] they uh Adam had to work by the sweat of
[1:08:00] his brow
[1:08:02] Eve had to suffer in childbirth
[1:08:07] amen and the Earth
[1:08:09] uh was cursed no more amen did we have
[1:08:14] the ease of planting there was thorns
[1:08:16] and thistles and and and and and and the
[1:08:19] Earth began
[1:08:22] to to to it wasn't what it was I should
[1:08:25] let me say that
[1:08:28] all because of sin
[1:08:32] so this
[1:08:34] young Rue not say young rule I'm sorry
[1:08:36] this Prodigal Son
[1:08:39] when
[1:08:40] and he began
[1:08:42] to go his way
[1:08:45] uh I want to tie job and say man that is
[1:08:48] born of a woman
[1:08:50] is born of a few days
[1:08:53] and it's full of trouble
[1:08:58] now we go back here
[1:09:01] amen
[1:09:03] we look at this Prodigal Son
[1:09:07] we see that
[1:09:09] he gathered and he went on a far Journey
[1:09:12] the Bible says
[1:09:15] and he wasted his substance
[1:09:18] on righteous Living
[1:09:21] God had given him certain gifts
[1:09:25] talents
[1:09:27] that he was supposed to use a man for
[1:09:31] the kingdom of God
[1:09:33] but he went away and he began to waste
[1:09:37] these gifts
[1:09:39] amen and do these type of things amen
[1:09:42] for the world
[1:09:44] and we see that he joined himself to a
[1:09:47] citizen of another country
[1:09:50] and begin to feed
[1:09:52] on the swine
[1:09:54] you see
[1:09:56] you can get to a point
[1:09:58] where you won't listen
[1:10:01] and you get off the word
[1:10:04] and you begin to feed
[1:10:07] on things on on unfamiliar Foods
[1:10:13] now what happens then is you get sick
[1:10:20] you you you you you you you you get
[1:10:23] things uh certain diseases began to
[1:10:26] creep into the body
[1:10:29] from a poor diet
[1:10:32] one of those things is is is is a
[1:10:36] spiritual amnesia
[1:10:40] spiritual Amnesia begins to to creep in
[1:10:46] first the body begins to break down
[1:10:50] and then the Mind follows
[1:10:53] you begin to forget who you are
[1:10:59] amen you think you're one of them
[1:11:03] but you're a citizen of another kingdom
[1:11:08] we see here that this prodigal son had
[1:11:12] gotten to a place
[1:11:14] where he forgot who he was
[1:11:18] all that his mother and his father had
[1:11:22] put into him
[1:11:23] amen he just pushed it to the side
[1:11:27] I'm not going to say he forgot it
[1:11:30] because let me tell you something you
[1:11:32] have to fight over it
[1:11:35] to do everything that you want to do
[1:11:39] but that voice in the back of your head
[1:11:42] doesn't go anywhere
[1:11:46] the train up a child the way he should
[1:11:50] go
[1:11:51] and in the end he will not depart
[1:11:55] so many of us even now I started out
[1:11:57] talking about our children
[1:12:00] they're just like this
[1:12:02] Prodigal Son
[1:12:05] but I want to tell you something about
[1:12:06] this Prodigal Son
[1:12:09] there came a famine
[1:12:12] there came a problem
[1:12:15] and he found himself into a point
[1:12:18] where he was out there
[1:12:21] feeding with the swine now you have to
[1:12:24] understand this this was a Jewish fellow
[1:12:27] yeah
[1:12:28] all right
[1:12:28] [Music]
[1:12:30] they wasn't supposed to have nothing to
[1:12:32] do with no oink oink
[1:12:36] nothing to do with no Pig
[1:12:41] and he out there not only is he taking
[1:12:46] care of pig he out there eating with the
[1:12:49] pig
[1:12:51] how far
[1:12:54] will the devil take you
[1:13:00] when you walk away from his word
[1:13:03] foreign
[1:13:05] but the story ain't over
[1:13:08] you got he got down so low
[1:13:13] but something happened
[1:13:15] [Music]
[1:13:17] it says there that uh uh he fed with
[1:13:22] this wine and he would feign have filled
[1:13:26] his belly with husk that the swine
[1:13:29] didn't eat that no man gave unto him
[1:13:34] he had lost all his money
[1:13:36] lost all his friends
[1:13:39] lost all his prestige
[1:13:42] and you know what I say to that
[1:13:44] glory to God
[1:13:49] Got Away of running you back home

[1:14:15] the mother didn't go running him and
[1:14:18] saying son would you please come back to
[1:14:20] the Lord
[1:14:21] would you please come back home

[1:14:49] debauchery and riots is living

[1:15:00] went over mountains and in valleys and
[1:15:02] crossed rivers and all kind of things
[1:15:05] and found himself in another country

[1:15:13] begin to say Lord why am I even out here

[1:15:45] here
[1:15:47] we see that this product this prodigal
[1:15:50] son amen something happened
[1:15:54] and he came to himself
[1:15:56] he began to remember all of the lessons
[1:15:59] that he taught that he was taught in
[1:16:01] Sunday School
[1:16:04] things begin to come back
[1:16:07] you see because amen he there was
[1:16:10] something placed on the inside of him
[1:16:12] amen that told him that who he was

[1:17:30] you begin to think in your mind
[1:17:33] oh I did this person this way

[1:18:15] you got to lay aside every sin and
[1:18:19] weight
[1:18:21] you got to lay it aside
[1:18:24] something has to happen on the inside of
[1:18:26] you
[1:18:27] amen that give you that I'm just saying
[1:18:30] I don't care what I have to go through
[1:18:33] I'm going back home
[1:18:40] but let me tell you something
[1:18:43] you can make it
[1:18:46] why amen because you're not on your own
[1:18:52] amen because there was something placed
[1:18:54] down in you
[1:18:56] amen from the for the foundation of the
[1:18:59] world Amen that is pulling you back home
[1:19:04] amen you think that that that that
[1:19:06] you're making a decision no I feel the
[1:19:10] pull
[1:19:11] you begin to feel the pull
[1:19:15] and no matter how hard it is no matter
[1:19:18] how far you've come amen no doubt his
[1:19:22] father and mother was back home praying
[1:19:25] amen and every time he lay down and
[1:19:29] close his eyes those prayers going forth
[1:19:34] amen and he began to feel the pool yeah
[1:19:41] I got to make it back home
[1:19:45] Hallelujah
[1:19:47] now this is the same thing amen when
[1:19:50] Adam and Eve fell in the garden amen we
[1:19:53] see that that that that the children of
[1:19:56] God Amen had lost their inheritance they
[1:20:00] had lost their place amen and they began
[1:20:04] to live to to waste their inheritance on
[1:20:07] riotous living I know yeah
[1:20:10] let me
[1:20:12] calm down
[1:20:13] and get back to these notes
[1:20:18] I want you to understand here
[1:20:21] that
[1:20:23] all scripture has compound meaning
[1:20:28] the prophet said that it has compound
[1:20:31] meaning
[1:20:33] and it runs in Cycles
[1:20:36] this is the way I can tie this story in
[1:20:40] Luke all the way back to Genesis
[1:20:43] because it runs in Cycles
[1:20:46] the cycle of time swings back every so
[1:20:50] often he says history repeats itself and
[1:20:55] scripture repeats itself down Through
[1:20:58] the Ages
[1:21:00] and I want I'll go from a literal
[1:21:04] standpoint
[1:21:05] to a spiritual standpoint
[1:21:09] amen
[1:21:10] bear with me
[1:21:13] now we see here
[1:21:16] that uh there was a promise
[1:21:20] amen that Drew nine
[1:21:22] and God raised up
[1:21:25] a man by the name of Moses
[1:21:28] and notice a very real type
[1:21:33] was given to us
[1:21:35] to the promised land Christ
[1:21:39] now we have a promise cause our promise
[1:21:42] is a spiritual rest
[1:21:47] I want you to keep in mind that uh that
[1:21:51] prodigal son at the time he had found no
[1:21:54] rest
[1:21:55] but he was tired
[1:21:58] of being sick and tired and he wanted
[1:22:03] some rest
[1:22:04] and he wanted peace in his life
[1:22:08] and he began to remember I had rest and
[1:22:13] peace back home
[1:22:15] amen so this young prodigal son uh our
[1:22:22] for the sake of dramatization I'll name
[1:22:24] her Israel name him Israel
[1:22:27] so God had to send the deliverer
[1:22:30] amen by the name of Moses down to a a
[1:22:35] free Israel from bondage
[1:22:39] amen and uh uh uh now we see
[1:22:43] that Israel down through the land
[1:22:46] they came amen through bondage and
[1:22:49] delivered and they began to make their
[1:22:52] Journey Back Home
[1:22:54] amen and they uh went through the desert
[1:22:58] and God brought them through a Red Sea
[1:23:02] amen only to find themselves at another
[1:23:07] place where do we go from here
[1:23:11] Where Do We Go From Here you see down
[1:23:14] through your life you may come over
[1:23:16] different hurdles and on your way back
[1:23:19] to God Amen that's what's called the the
[1:23:22] the seed and the wheat but there's a
[1:23:25] husk around it you had your time you
[1:23:28] come through certain things amen you you
[1:23:31] you were one time in denomination and
[1:23:34] you will at one time amen you was in
[1:23:37] this and at one time you may have been
[1:23:39] in that but you get to a point in
[1:23:41] everybody's life you have the question
[1:23:44] where do I go from here
[1:23:47] [Music]
[1:23:49] I see these children of Israel they
[1:23:52] would come to a place they seen the
[1:23:54] great Miracles God had brought them from
[1:23:57] a mighty long way
[1:23:59] but I'm telling you they get to that
[1:24:01] point there and they say well Moses
[1:24:03] Where Do We Go From Here both and sages
[1:24:07] follow me as I follow him
[1:24:13] Now The Story Goes On
[1:24:15] that they find themselves at a place
[1:24:21] it took him a while to get there
[1:24:24] they wandered in the desert
[1:24:27] wandered and wandered
[1:24:30] amen and they found them Place had a
[1:24:32] decision
[1:24:34] barnia
[1:24:37] and that was a place of decision
[1:24:41] they had journeyed from a long way
[1:24:45] and they found themselves in a place
[1:24:47] where they now we have to make a
[1:24:51] decision
[1:24:52] and no doubt amen it was a very hard
[1:24:55] decision
[1:24:57] now I'm comparing to this Prodigal Son
[1:25:01] this prodigal son had to make a decision
[1:25:05] why should be here until I die
[1:25:10] he had to rise up
[1:25:12] amen and begin to start movement
[1:25:17] he had to go back
[1:25:19] let me read something here
[1:25:21] let me read something here this prodigal
[1:25:25] son he said I will rise and go to my
[1:25:30] father
[1:25:31] see he made a decision
[1:25:33] there come a time in your life where you
[1:25:36] got to make a decision
[1:25:39] you can't sit there and continue in your
[1:25:43] sins all you would die in your sins why
[1:25:47] seek ye here until we die there come a
[1:25:50] place where you have to make a stand
[1:25:55] you have to stand for something or
[1:25:57] you'll fall for anything
[1:26:00] amen so this prodigal son he said I'm
[1:26:03] going and I will say to my father I have
[1:26:08] sinned against
[1:26:11] heaven
[1:26:12] and I have and before thee
[1:26:16] so we see that that son
[1:26:20] said to his father he had a repentant
[1:26:24] heart he came and he began in his mind
[1:26:28] he said Lord
[1:26:30] Lord I'm sorry
[1:26:32] I got myself in this condition
[1:26:35] I'm out here and I'm breaking all of the
[1:26:39] rules and I'm breaking the laws and I
[1:26:42] have disappointed heaven
[1:26:44] and my father
[1:26:47] but Lord God I'm going home
[1:26:51] I'm going home
[1:26:53] I have sinned against heaven and before
[1:26:55] thee and I am no more worthy to be
[1:26:59] called son make me one of the highest
[1:27:02] servants you see what happened he don't
[1:27:06] got spiritual Amnesia see because you
[1:27:09] can never be a servant because you was
[1:27:11] born a son he had lost his identity he
[1:27:16] didn't even know who he was anymore
[1:27:20] he didn't know who he was anymore make
[1:27:23] me one of thy hired servants and he
[1:27:27] began he says I'm no more worthy amen
[1:27:30] that was a Godless sorrow amen you see
[1:27:33] first before you come back amen first
[1:27:37] there has to be a Godless sorry you have
[1:27:40] to be Godless sorry for your sins amen
[1:27:43] and then you just got down to your knees
[1:27:46] amen come to the altar find somebody a
[1:27:51] man of God and say I want to turn my
[1:27:55] life around amen we see that this Rich
[1:27:58] I'm sorry this Prodigal Son
[1:28:01] amen he had been converted but see
[1:28:05] because converted means that you're
[1:28:06] going to make a 180. he turned around
[1:28:09] and he began to making steps to find his
[1:28:13] way back home but before he made a move
[1:28:17] he repented before God he said Lord I'm
[1:28:21] sorry Lord I sinned against heaven and
[1:28:25] I've sinned against you Lord God help me
[1:28:29] get back home
[1:28:32] help me get back home and that's all he
[1:28:35] had to say now the journey is going to
[1:28:38] be difficult but you said the magic word
[1:28:42] Lord I'm sorry
[1:28:45] Lord forgive me and help me get back
[1:28:50] home
[1:28:54] so they come to a place here Israel
[1:28:58] and conditioner amen and they they they
[1:29:02] had to go over now I wanna bring
[1:29:06] something out here
[1:29:08] amen
[1:29:12] and did you notice Moses the great
[1:29:14] miracle worker
[1:29:15] that brought down Israel
[1:29:17] down through the land
[1:29:19] and brought them up to the promised land
[1:29:23] but did not Place their inheritance
[1:29:28] he did not give them their inheritance
[1:29:31] he led them up to the land
[1:29:34] but Joshua
[1:29:36] divided the land to the people is that
[1:29:38] right
[1:29:40] and Christ brought the church
[1:29:42] to the place
[1:29:44] where their possession was made
[1:29:47] and he gave them
[1:29:49] just the Jordan to cross
[1:29:52] but the holy spirit is one who sets the
[1:29:57] church in order
[1:30:00] Joshua today puts the church in its
[1:30:04] order
[1:30:05] giving each one gifts places position he
[1:30:11] is the voice of God through the inner
[1:30:14] man that Christ has saved the Holy
[1:30:18] Spirit now do you get that much now
[1:30:21] we're getting over into the book of
[1:30:24] Ephesians now he's positionally placing
[1:30:29] the church belonging now Joshua placed
[1:30:33] them in the natural land now the holy
[1:30:37] spirit is placing the church
[1:30:39] positionally in the land spiritually
[1:30:44] Hallelujah I I I have to draw the
[1:30:47] comparison so that you will understand
[1:30:50] amen that the story is still vital today
[1:30:54] it's still relevant right now amen we we
[1:30:59] we we want to get back the prodigal son
[1:31:02] is trying to get back Amen to home
[1:31:06] amen but he has squandered away all his
[1:31:10] inheritance and I want you to notice
[1:31:12] that when Adam and Eve fell in the
[1:31:14] garden they lost their inheritance
[1:31:18] amen but we're going Amen to a place
[1:31:22] amen where we can get our inheritance
[1:31:25] back amen now stay with me
[1:31:29] now we see this Prodigal Son
[1:31:33] he repented
[1:31:35] but that wasn't it
[1:31:38] amen
[1:31:39] he made his way
[1:31:41] making his way back home
[1:31:44] but before he got home
[1:31:48] his father ran out to meet him the
[1:31:54] let's read a little bit
[1:31:56] he says I will rise and I'll go to my
[1:32:00] father
[1:32:01] and we'll say unto him Heaven present
[1:32:04] him I've sinned against heaven and
[1:32:07] before thee
[1:32:08] and I'm no more worried that just
[1:32:10] because son
[1:32:13] make me as one of the high servants
[1:32:16] and he rose and came
[1:32:20] to his father
[1:32:21] but when he was yet a great way off
[1:32:25] his father saw him
[1:32:28] and had compassion
[1:32:31] and ran and fell on his neck
[1:32:35] oh my
[1:32:37] all you have to do
[1:32:39] is make a decision
[1:32:42] repent before God
[1:32:44] and begin making your way back home
[1:32:48] amen God will carry you the rest of the
[1:32:50] way
[1:32:51] before he got all the way home his
[1:32:54] father ran out to meet him
[1:32:57] amen and hugged him on his neck
[1:33:00] kissed him and let him know that I'm not
[1:33:03] mad at you
[1:33:05] the father didn't say hey son where's my
[1:33:08] money
[1:33:12] he wasn't worried about the money
[1:33:16] he said my son who was once dead
[1:33:19] is now alive
[1:33:22] kill the fattest cow
[1:33:25] servants bring me out a ring
[1:33:29] amen and a row
[1:33:31] now first we have to remind him because
[1:33:34] my son's sick
[1:33:36] he's got amnesia I'm gonna put this ring
[1:33:40] on his finger and every time he look at
[1:33:43] this ring he knows I'm the son
[1:33:47] of almighty God I am not a servant amen
[1:33:52] I belong to my father
[1:33:54] that ring signifies his identification
[1:34:00] not not only
[1:34:03] he put him on a road
[1:34:04] he's saying you're dressing like the
[1:34:06] world son
[1:34:07] I gotta take that off of you
[1:34:10] I gotta put you on the right of time
[1:34:14] I got a sanctifier
[1:34:18] so you're set aside for service
[1:34:20] I can't have you going in
[1:34:23] like this because you was once a son
[1:34:26] always a son you are leader before the
[1:34:29] people
[1:34:30] [Music]
[1:34:32] so I gotta clean you up
[1:34:36] I gotta clean you up
[1:34:39] now
[1:34:41] he put him on the road
[1:34:43] put some shoes on his feet
[1:34:46] made him looks hot like something
[1:34:48] hey man begin to change them now see
[1:34:51] he's repented
[1:34:52] and then along the way now he's been
[1:34:55] sanctified
[1:34:56] he's been cleaned up
[1:34:59] and he's ready
[1:35:00] to do the father's bidding
[1:35:03] now I but I got to do nice feed you
[1:35:06] I gotta feed you from the bleeding
[1:35:10] bloody lamb
[1:35:12] see you've been out there eating that
[1:35:13] old swine and you're you're messed up in
[1:35:17] your mind
[1:35:18] you don't mean to eat from Heart Diet
[1:35:21] let me let me let me slow down here
[1:35:23] cause see the other son
[1:35:26] kind of told a little more of the story
[1:35:30] the other side
[1:35:32] said he out dealt with them harlots
[1:35:39] John that's where I just lived no other
[1:35:41] son described it say he out there now
[1:35:43] you know what he doing you know what he
[1:35:45] done
[1:35:46] out there with them Harleys and see the
[1:35:49] prophet told us that those harlots amen
[1:35:53] was those denominational churches amen
[1:35:57] because that Catholic is the great
[1:35:59] and they are the Harless you left the
[1:36:02] word and you went feeding all
[1:36:05] denominational food you went laying with
[1:36:08] those harlots found yourself joined up
[1:36:10] in another country
[1:36:13] and I forgot who you are
[1:36:21] amen
[1:36:22] so I said I'll bring you the fatted calf
[1:36:27] I got to feed you the bleeding bloody
[1:36:31] word of God
[1:36:34] to build up your strength
[1:36:36] you've been on a long journey
[1:36:39] you've been through a lot
[1:36:41] but I gotta get you to a point now amen
[1:36:45] where you can handle some things right
[1:36:48] now your mind ain't right yet
[1:36:50] spiritually you're sick
[1:36:53] you can't handle nothing but just steal
[1:36:56] my son
[1:36:58] you got the ring on your finger the robe
[1:37:01] on your clothes but sit here under this
[1:37:04] word for a while
[1:37:08] I gotta feed you this bleeding bloody
[1:37:11] lamb
[1:37:15] so we see
[1:37:17] amen
[1:37:19] it's the same thing
[1:37:21] for us today
[1:37:23] we've drifted so far from God
[1:37:29] all have seen
[1:37:31] and come short
[1:37:33] we were all the Prodigal Son
[1:37:38] and we had to come back home
[1:37:41] the same place
[1:37:43] and I remember I'm talking about a
[1:37:46] spiritual location
[1:37:50] back then the examples and The Parables
[1:37:53] is a natural
[1:37:55] but put on your spiritual thinking
[1:37:58] you had to make your way back home
[1:38:02] now I asked the question where do we go
[1:38:04] from here
[1:38:06] now that question is relevant to
[1:38:08] everybody in the building
[1:38:11] you may uh be like The Prodigal Son
[1:38:16] amen eating the swine with the swine
[1:38:20] you may not understand who you are
[1:38:24] you may be lost and sick and tired of
[1:38:28] being sick and tired
[1:38:30] but you stand up and say well where do I
[1:38:33] go from here
[1:38:35] do I sit here until I die
[1:38:39] hey man so you have to make a decision
[1:38:44] this morning hey man some of us have we
[1:38:48] come from a mighty long way
[1:38:50] amen we we've been uh we've come through
[1:38:54] the nomination and and things of that
[1:38:56] nature and and and and it was good
[1:39:00] it was good we enjoyed ourselves but God
[1:39:05] has brought us a little closer
[1:39:08] we probably joined up there I'm telling
[1:39:11] my own testimony to another denomination
[1:39:14] amen a church that was just a little bit
[1:39:17] more down in the business amen back in
[1:39:20] the first church that we belonged to it
[1:39:22] was all about playing and everything
[1:39:24] else I didn't know God from from from
[1:39:26] from nothing
[1:39:29] but we went to church sung in the choir
[1:39:31] and that was about it
[1:39:35] I love him but I tell you he I used to
[1:39:39] tease him all the time say uncle I love
[1:39:41] you but you can't preach your way out of
[1:39:42] a wet paper bag
[1:39:45] but you know what he has gotten better
[1:39:50] food with him if you want to he thought
[1:39:52] he got better
[1:39:54] and I appreciate him you know why
[1:39:57] because he started me out the right way
[1:40:02] even when I went her straight he would
[1:40:05] call me and say guess where I'm going
[1:40:07] this morning I say well the church
[1:40:10] and then he would say where you going
[1:40:14] I say Ark I love you
[1:40:17] but I'm not coming to your church
[1:40:19] [Music]
[1:40:22] can't eat that
[1:40:25] but I love you not I don't think I don't
[1:40:27] love you
[1:40:28] and I'm praying for you
[1:40:31] Lord have mercy
[1:40:33] so we go on in this prodigal son amen he
[1:40:38] had to be fed
[1:40:39] amen he had to come back home and now we
[1:40:43] we we we switch to the other side
[1:40:47] the other son amen let's let's take it a
[1:40:50] little further here let's continue to
[1:40:51] read amen and he arose and the son said
[1:40:55] unto him father
[1:40:57] I've sinned against Steve in the sight
[1:41:00] of God and no more worthy to be son but
[1:41:01] the father said unto him bring the best
[1:41:03] robe and a ring on his hand shoes on the
[1:41:05] streets and bring the calf and kill it
[1:41:08] and let us eat and be married
[1:41:11] for this son was dead and now alive
[1:41:14] he was lost and is not found and they
[1:41:18] begin to be merry
[1:41:20] amen now the Elder son
[1:41:25] was in the field
[1:41:27] and has came and Drew Nye into the house
[1:41:31] he heard music and dancing
[1:41:34] and he called one of his servants and
[1:41:38] asked these servants and and asked the
[1:41:41] what these things meant and he said unto
[1:41:44] that he said unto him thy brother is
[1:41:47] come
[1:41:48] and my father has killed the fatted calf
[1:41:52] because he has received him safe and
[1:41:57] sound and we see that this older son got
[1:42:00] angry
[1:42:02] and would not go
[1:42:04] go into the celebration
[1:42:10] yeah not a father come amen but let's
[1:42:13] hold on right there
[1:42:15] we see
[1:42:17] the story here of the two sons
[1:42:20] one went off and wasted his inheritance
[1:42:23] on riotous living
[1:42:25] but he came back
[1:42:27] he came to himself
[1:42:29] he made the Journey Back Home
[1:42:32] he came through repent he repented
[1:42:36] sanctification
[1:42:37] and now to be placed in that land to
[1:42:41] receive the inheritance is a type of the
[1:42:43] Holy Ghost
[1:42:45] amen
[1:42:46] so
[1:42:50] he was justified
[1:42:55] sanctified
[1:42:57] and filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:43:00] so when you justify
[1:43:03] it's just as you've never done it in the
[1:43:06] first place
[1:43:10] just as you've never done it in the
[1:43:12] first place
[1:43:14] so now we go to the second son
[1:43:17] he said I've been here all along
[1:43:19] I didn't do nothing
[1:43:23] but where do I go from here
[1:43:25] now I want to mind you that I'm saying
[1:43:28] the first son
[1:43:30] is the second son
[1:43:32] because his sins were forgiven
[1:43:35] he is back where he was he never done it
[1:43:39] in the first place
[1:43:43] however where do we go from here
[1:43:48] he began to get a little bit beside
[1:43:50] himself
[1:43:52] well I'm somebody
[1:43:55] I've I've been here all along
[1:43:59] and this person did this
[1:44:02] and this person did that
[1:44:05] and the scripture tell us that he was
[1:44:07] angry and would not go in
[1:44:10] hey son you got some Journey in to do
[1:44:12] yourself
[1:44:14] the journey is not over
[1:44:20] amen
[1:44:21] the journey is not over
[1:44:25] amen
[1:44:27] we'll read here
[1:44:30] amen I wanna
[1:44:33] let's see here
[1:44:44] amen amen
[1:44:48] we see in the message
[1:44:51] amen adoption
[1:44:54] the prophet was saying how
[1:44:58] amen
[1:45:00] go to uh

[2:21:55] let's give the Lord a hand of Praise
[2:21:59] amen
[2:22:01] I certainly appreciate brother Troy on
[2:22:05] this morning why sit we here until we
[2:22:08] die and
[2:22:10] um just a really really beautiful
[2:22:11] thought and I just never really looked
[2:22:14] at that part of the Sun in the way that
[2:22:17] he presented it
[2:22:18] you know he was telling us the second
[2:22:22] son is really the first son still on the
[2:22:24] same Journey right and uh and when you
[2:22:27] look at that um that that second son
[2:22:29] that
[2:22:30] the oldest son that was revealing you
[2:22:33] know the sins of his brother said he
[2:22:35] went out with the harlots and just never
[2:22:37] looked that the harlots represent a man
[2:22:41] the the nominational church system right
[2:22:44] that's what he left and went to the
[2:22:45] denomination churches but uh but you
[2:22:48] know what in there God will allow famine
[2:22:51] to bring people back Amen to the truth
[2:22:54] so God know exactly what he's doing all
[2:22:55] you got to do is have the right heart
[2:22:57] and have the right spirit and have the
[2:22:59] right attitude and just let God be God
[2:23:04] and I just I just love how that story
[2:23:07] goes the father never went after the
[2:23:08] first son never went after him but if
[2:23:11] the second son that the daddy need to
[2:23:13] deal with the daddy left the party to go
[2:23:16] outside to talk to him because the
[2:23:18] Second Son really had some problems but
[2:23:21] he didn't realize he had him
[2:23:23] amen and that's why you know the Holy
[2:23:27] Spirit just began to pick up the malice
[2:23:29] and the envy and the strife and that's
[2:23:31] where the real problem is we got to have
[2:23:33] love flowing in our hearts for our
[2:23:35] brothers and sisters what a wonderful
[2:23:37] thought this morning I appreciate amen
[2:23:39] our precious brother Troy God bless you
