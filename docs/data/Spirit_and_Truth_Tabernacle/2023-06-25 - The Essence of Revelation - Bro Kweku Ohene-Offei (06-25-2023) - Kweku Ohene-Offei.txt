devil gonna have some trouble [Laughter] the devil's gonna have some trouble we thank the Lord I I I I don't want to take too much time this morning I um I do need to just make a couple announcements and um uh after service I do need to just give you all a quick update amen as to where we are with a few things uh in our project but um um one of the things that I wanna have prayer over is um we had a sister that called this morning and she solicited praying for my church just some things that she's going through spiritually and just looking for God just to help her through this time and um uh so we we want to just take her before the Lord God knows her name amen and and uh but we want to take it before the Lord she asks our church to pray so we're gonna do that amen and we want to just remember uh her in prayer um the two other things that I want to make mention of brother Solomon didn't mention about brother brother Robles and I wanted the church to realize that this is a very serious uh situation that our brother uh is in I had a chance to visit him and visit with the family at the moment there is a machine that is keeping him breathing and so we need a miracle because at some point in time they'll have to take them off the machine and we know God is the one that is the he's the one that started breath he breathed and just the breath of life and it's going to take God not the machine God is the one that has to do it so we want you to please remember this family in prayer sister Robles the children are starting to come I believe we picked up Rosanna from the airport on Friday and then I believe Erica is going to come today with her family and his son Daniel will be here tomorrow so just be in prayer for the family during this time we need God we really need God a man to move on our brother's behalf another just praise report I got a telephone call on yesterday and a sister left me three messages and um and she was telling me that I guess it was last year sometime she knew about the um the US you know trying to get into a church and she wanted to bring a building fund offering and she came here to the school she never actually made it into the sanctuary but she was just outside and she came just to bring her building fund um offering and she said I just want to I want y'all to use this for you know for that for the for the building and as she was going back to the car she was so weak and just really going through so much of the body she didn't tell anybody but she said brother Troy recognized uh that something was going wrong and uh and he grabbed one of the other brothers and they went outside and they prayed for their sister at her car and uh when they prayed for her she said that um something was going on where she was losing feeling in her foot and you know the doctors were trying to get the doctors like how did you let it get this bad I mean you couldn't feel that like no I don't know what's going on and she knows she suffered from diabetes there but she just couldn't understand what was happening and the doctors were just saying we don't know how bad this is but uh you're gonna really need a miracle so you should come here and she dropped off her building fund and then the brothers prayed for her and when they prayed for her she went back to the doctor and everything that they saw begin to reverse Hallelujah you can't tell us that God is Not A Healer she say she heard brother Smiley preaching inside and and brother Troy was out there praying and I don't know who else went out with him but they just laid hands on and prayed for and got reversed that thing oh yeah yeah so I was I was just very happy you know just to hear uh that testimony you know from her and she said she had been meaning to let us know about this for a while but she just so happened to call at the right time just to encourage our faith amen just to encourage our faith we know what God's able to do amen so we just trust him we lean on him we depend on him amen we call him up we tell them what we want amen amen amen amen so let's just have a word of prayer amen at this time for our sister and we also want to remember brother and sister Robles in the family in our prayers again father we come before you God you know the precious sister that call this morning you know her name not only do you know her name you know her condition you know everything she going through right now and father we know that you're able to bring peace that passeth all understanding you're able to guide and guard a heart and mind even through this season of life we ask that you would Lord just speak to or minister to her show yourself Lord and that God in the midst of it that she would realize that it's sometimes the Tim to handle Jehovah he does things in such a way that we we have to respond so make sure you feel your tender hand Lord just gently leading her and guiding her through this season and Lord may you direct their fathers our prayer just committering to you into your capable hands I want to remember brother Robles God we know this is a very serious uh situation that our brother is enduring but we heard a testimony how you healed already God just through the words of prayer and Lord as I uh stood over his uh his bed and I read scripture God you just put in my heart to read Ezekiel 16 and 6 and father there uh the prophet said live I say unto thee live God we speak those words over our brother live I say unto you live glory to God Hallelujah as Sons and Daughters of God we take our authority over the devil you say what we bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and what we loose on Earth shall be loose in heaven so we lose Lord your breath to flow through his body even right now in the name of Jesus Satan take your hands off our brother loosen and let him go in the name of Jesus Hallelujah Lord we ask that you just moved by your spirit even right now God we give you all the glory all the honor and all the praise it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen amen [Applause] Hallelujah amen amen praise the lord well this morning I was um I had arranged for brother kwaku to take the Wednesday night service because I knew that my traveling when I got back from Romania so I didn't know how it's going to be but God just gave us it gave us a wonderful journey home the trip there was a trial my first flight was delayed by six hours and which means that I was going to miss all my connecting flights and um so then you know we found another flight we had to go down to Miami and I'm just one that I don't like to fly out of Miami I'd rather fly out of Fort Lauderdale or West Palm but you know they gave us vouchers and sent us down to Miami and we got there and and we flew all night to Germany and uh then we had to go from one airport in Germany to another airport in Germany and when we got there they uh had a we had a 10 hour layover and I said oh God uh so we we did The Layover and um and then got on a flight and I think arrived to Romania about about 12 30 1 o'clock in the morning and we got in the car said how long is the drive to uh the place we stay in an hour and a half yeah thank you Lord it's three o'clock in the morning and we sliding into the hotel and I say oh my my I was in the airport praying I said Lord it's easy to stay right here it's much easier but if it's your will and you want me to go God you're gonna have to open up some doors and as I just sat back I said these are those clothes I'm getting in my car now I know where to go right back to West Palm Beach but Lord if it's your will I'll go and God open up the door so we went by by the grace of God and you know we're happy that we were able to go and be a blessing to the people amen but uh but brother quaku I was telling sick brother I'll probably need you on that Wednesday night and when I got back on that that Monday because everything just went very smooth no no problem with the flight coming back the only thing happened I was sitting at the airport eating and it was a just a little bar holding up the the little table there and I moved my leg underneath that table [Music] and I hit my knee real good now um at the airport I ain't feel nothing but a few days later things start my knee got bigger and uh so I'm just you know y'all bear with me I'm I'm claiming my healing in Jesus name amen but uh the devil always attacking some kind of way you know but we we thank God for victory but I told Brother I think I'm good enough to take Wednesday can you take Sunday and they say yes brother I say I appreciate his flexibility but I didn't know that on when when I got back uh brother Robles was going to be going through what he was going through and I was back and forth back and forth just trying to see about him and so I'm happy amen that our precious brother kwaku was imposition just to just slip in this morning and just carry the service it's a big help amen I thank God for all the help that is given spirit and Truth Tabernacle amen I don't have to try to carry it myself oh man we got some we got some real soldiers amen and we we just appreciate the Lord for each and every one of them so amen as we welcome brother quicker to the pulpit let's stand to our feet amen Amazing Grace amen and let's just welcome him to the pulpit as he comes uh this morning [Music] same Grace how

and honor to your name for the things that you did you are doing and whoever do father we hear the Miracles and the Wonders Lord because you are the same yesterday today and forever Moon you are not God of the Dead you are God of the living father you are God of Abraham Isaac God of Israel God of Joseph God of brother Jack brother brothers of my sisters and brothers Lord you are the living one who dwells in our hearts father this morning we have come in your presence Lord father Lord we to hear from you not to hear from a man let us know the Lord take permanence Lord let every man every vessel be a vessel and father you'll be the speaker Lord Jesus that you speak your word from our heart and then you hear the word from the heart blessed are they thus be the word and blessed that they die hear the word father give us the spiritual ears to hear the word and even as we hear the word father do the Miracles Lord let the supernatural father I pray take prominence Lord father and bless every brother and sister we thank you Lord father for brother but I will bless we pray Lord father and claim his life for the glory of your name father for your name's sake and for his dear wife sister Robles father blessed by the Jack bless all the body of Christ we give praise and honor to your name we thank you in Jesus Christ let me pray amen [Music] us also forgot to mention I did hear from Brother Capers they they said they're doing fine they just weren't able to make it today so just keep them in prayer amen amen amen return the Lord amen shall we take our seat for now the Lord is good we thank you for his goodness and mercy I don't know where to start from where to go and how to end but the Lord knows amen someone to preach and I have a testimony from Mexico the trip almost three weeks trip but then we see how the Lord will help us to infuse some of the testimonies some of the reports in the sermon so we want to speak on the essence of Revelation if you can give me my slide and the essence of Revelation amen how important Revelation is to us and I try to look at the word essence essence is indispensable quality something that you cannot do without right and then the other meaning is absolute necessity because it's independable it's an absolute that you need just like the oxygen that we breathe for you to be able to live on this side you need to breathe oxygen in your lungs to carry on some of the metabolic processes in the body and the natural is a type of the spiritual that we need the revelation of Jesus Christ which is the supernatural oxygen to be able to live in this life and why do we need those Revelations we want to find out let's go to the next slide we need to recognize that we have eternal life which was placing us before the foundation of the world without being revealed to you you even know eternal life you might not even think about it eternal life because you don't know it but then when the Lord revisits you that you are part of him you existed before the foundation of the world you have life eternal in you and you are the son of the Living God and you've got all the attributes and qualities of your father the Lord Jesus Christ in you amen and also it helps us to express Eternal attributes and the characters that the Lord placed in us before the foundation of the world and as we walk on this Earth definitely nobody is spared everybody has his challenges and trials even the children the first day they are born they begin to cry who cry when this is happy you cry when there's something wrong so even children have their challenges so now the revelation will help you to surmount those challenges and God placing you Ministries calling talents gifts for the body of Christ for you yourself and the god the people that God has called you for amen I don't think brother Jack just came from heaven and dropped here as a pastor his Precious mom is here he went through thick and thin mother knows what he went through with his son and even when the Lord called him he give his testimony how it wasn't he didn't want to go but the Lord even his professors were telling him that you a preacher wherever he go there a preacher he will preacher so he couldn't do nothing else because that was what God ordained for him to do and I think last week you heard about that Troy talking about his grandmother praying for him when he was a young boy watching the grandmother praying and bombarding prayers in his own eardrum so that prayer has become a manifestation so the Lord has to reveal those things to you to know your purpose on Earth amen people are going through life they don't know why they are here they think they are here because of money they think they are here because of Fame they think they are because of things of this world but things of this world begin and they will end but life eternal revelation of Jesus Christ is a tenor amen and also to overcome trials and facilitate the growth we need to grow from Grace to Grace from glory to glory from Mercy onto Mercy from Christ unto Christ amen from one understanding to another and it's all come by Revelation and then for your calling God puts you not just for yourself we are the word of selfie I me and mine that is what the world is about that is the cosmos world but the logos is about eternal life living for others so for you to live for others guide us to express that life from within you unto the others you are living for so that you can Excel your family your people around you your community your church whatever your job whatever the Lord places you that is what the Lord has called you for so that is what Revelation does for us amen Glory Hallelujah and we want to look at our scripture uh let's go to the scripture read the scripture and then I will we have some video get a video ready for me slide five after the scripture I will try to look at that video Mark chapter 12 verse 18 to 27 and we have the same scriptures in Matthew go to the next slide Matthew 22 23-33 it was what Jesus spoke about and then his disciples Mark and Matthew they scripted they were scribes they wrote what Jesus was saying so let's read from Mark um let me see what are you from yeah let's read from Mark chapter 12 18 to 27 Mark 12. let's go to the the previous slide Mark 12 18-27 shall we if you can be on our feet let's stand to hear the word of the Lord he said then came unto him that the Sadducees sad to see means sad you see farazim is far you see because always look to the past they don't see the person and the Pharisee looks so far whilst the Lord Jesus Christ was with them they didn't see him but we don't want to be like them we want to be the present-day God Amen so he said which then came unto him the Sadducees which says there is no Resurrection there is no Resurrection they didn't say there will be no but there's no they don't believe in the present they somehow believe in Resurrection but not in the present tense so and they ask him saying Master Moses wrote unto us if a man's brother died and if a man's okay if a man's brother died and leave his wife behind him and leave no children that his brother should take his wife and raise up seed unto his brother that's an Old Testament law now there were seven Brethren and the first took a wife dying left no seed and the second took her and died neither left he any seed and they fed likewise and the Seven had her and left no seed lasso for the woman died also in the resurrection therefore when they shall rise whose wife shall be of them for the seven had to wife and Jesus answering said unto them thee not therefore in other words you make mistake you make an error because you don't know the scriptures neither the power of God because they don't know that Revelation they don't know their scriptures they read but they don't have the revelation of faith and so the the air 25 for when they shall rise from the dead they neither marry nor are given in marriage but as Angels which are in heaven you are still funny amen as touching the dead that they rise have you never have he not read in the book of Moses how in the bush God spoke unto him saying I am the god of Abraham and God of Isaac and God of Jacob he is not the god of the dead but the god of the living He therefore do greatly Heir shall we take our seed glory to the Lord amen now the Pharisees and they said this is where they were not people who were ungodly people they were if our time we call them Christians they could be you can call them by any name any sector they were Christians but then they couldn't accept the word of God for their day they accepted the word of God previously because they told Jesus that we are Moses disciples this is what Moses wrote that if a man marries and doesn't have children with his wife when he dies then his brother should marry the woman and then raise children for the name of the of the brother some people had a wife have this woman neither of them had children so in the resurrection in other words when we reset they believe there's no they say there's no Resurrection but now here they say that in their Resurrection whose wife is gonna be so they believe in Resurrection but not in the present tense form they believe in future Resurrection they believe Moses but not in a present tense form amen and want to extrapolate this scripture to our day how do we believe Resurrection how do we believe the word of God for our day are we also like the Francis and the Sadducees that look behind see we are far but what the Lord is doing right now we don't see it amen Abraham said that the the Jews of that time in Jesus time they were not ungodly people they were high priests they were not drunkards they were not fornicators but they were people that lead holy life but they were able to see God of yesterday right Hebrews 13 8 says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever so they recognize God did something in Moses time and they held on to it and they know God is going to do something in the future but what God was doing at their time they were oblivious of it they were blinded to it they didn't want to see it they couldn't recognize Jesus was their son spoken word of God so for that they crucified the our own Messiah and when did Chris Van they said we don't crucify for healing our children for healing our wives and husbands but for you a man we don't even know how you were born and in their mind he was he was the son of Joseph he was born in in fornication claiming you are the king of Israel you are the Son of God in other words you are the almighty God from heaven we can't chew that we can't masticate that we can't swallow that and for that they ask who do we release to you the thieves Barabas or Jesus the king of the Jesus no he's not the king of the Jews don't even call him King of the Jews and they crucify him but the scripture said that he was a king but for the foundation of the world when he was born he was a king and wise men presented gifts gold man and incense because he was born a king even at a baby he was a king amen but the Jews couldn't see and as such they killed their own Messiah they've been praying for years their fathers have been praying they couldn't see and want to see how it relates in our time that how we see God is it God of yesterday is he got off in the time of only Paul God of William Abraham you see brother Solomon's God is he brother Joseph's God is he my God is he in you amen the only way you can claim it when it's in in your life if it's not in your life you can profess him but you don't possess him you can be in Christ by Christ you're not being you you can have the setting of a church of Christendom of Christianity you can firm it on your documents Christian religion but that doesn't make you Christ what makes you Christ is Christ in you the Holy Ghost baptism Glory Hallelujah to the Lord I want us to before I go into the preaching itself I want us to look at the testimony of a young lady that graduated from high school recently and had testimony her mom passed just around two years before she graduated if uh stabby can you get a video for me it's in YouTube if you can copy the link and copy the link and I want us to hear from from from her Amen to see how as young people this is the position for the young people and for adults I was inspired for somebody who could stand for the Lord just a teenager and let's see how do we stand for God do we compromise because of the pressure from the world or we can stand for God even in school even wherever we are amen Glory Hallelujah to the Lord if you can copy it then put it in a in Google or something like that it will come up but let's let's continue as they are trying to get us there the Lord he's good praise the Lord hallelujah okay we are there okay listen just about five six minutes but I believe to be a blessing for you and I there you go give it some volume can you start is it a starting okay great at Beaumont High School in the three minutes each oh and shares how her decades long says was redirected two years ago can tragedy struck my life it was not my prayers nor my accomplishments that helped me navigate that loss when everything else in my lifelong certainly the only is Jesus always says her mom was her biggest inspiration or she always pushed me with me invited so she only encouraged me last week um she would be available to me of how to be a Godly woman and how to love people intentionally but it wasn't always easy I got really into like a hard place where I was really doubting God and just like what he's praying for me was I didn't understand how and just said you know I don't really know where we go from here to do it together also just remembering that's what my mom wanted me to do is keep going encouraging those around her despite the hardships life brings you don't have to worry about whether or not your music his grace is sufficient for us and that his power is made perfect in our weaknesses I asked Lydia what it was like hearing the Roaring Applause from her peers okay like this this was the moment that God wanted like my what happened with my mom two years for um it was really difficult and it was really scary but I got a very overwhelming positive feedback I definitely did have some people tell me that like oh I needed to talk about Jesus but like that's gonna happen no matter what you say I was small like a baby I obviously there's a lot of joy and pride there but likewise knowing that her mom wasn't there to hurt but I also take recognition of the fact that I know that she was looking down and she was definitely smiling I don't want anyone to say well Lydia you did a great job like you were the one that said all those words that wasn't me speaking against I said the words around speaking through me Olivia says being a graduate doesn't quite feel real just yet but in the fall she's actually going to be attending Anderson University majoring in elementary education so we wish you the best amen glory look at this young lady a man just about 18 at most 18 years maybe 16 17. and she was she wasn't shy or proclaiming the Christ in her she didn't succumb to the pressures around she didn't succumbed to the school system who has lost her mother she had challenges she said she was almost about to how can God you know take my mom away and that become your testimony but when the Lord revealed it to her on her graduating ceremony she was able to stand before thousands of people and speak about her where her strength coming from her friend didn't come from a great didn't come from the family wealth from the riches but from Jesus and Jesus alone even when you listen for what's one of the we didn't finish but he said the things of this world is tempera regardless of whether you fail or you succeed it's still gonna it's not gonna last but what will last is your Jesus and and I was encouraged even me a preacher that if a little girl can stand for God like this why can't we stand for the Lord young and old why do we want to compromise let the word recognize it don't let the world Define you when you let the cosmos Define you it's going to destroy you because the Bible said that the devil come to what he comes to kill to steal and to destroy but Jesus Christ comes to give life and give it abundantly remember my sermon on the sweet 16 some months ago it wasn't too long I think it was April 25th 2023 there was a young lady celebrating her sweet 16 and had a party and then somehow some adults 18 year olds came around so the mom went to tell them that you know if you are more than I think 16 or somewhere just leave so she kicked them out but there was a gang related issue so those young men came back with gun and blew the people and I think one of the if I remember the story one young man he said he skipped and he remembered that her sister was there so she went wrapped herself around her sister drop her on the floor and she received a bullet for for the sister she died but the sister made it you see how the Holy Ghost can save you certain atmosphere you don't even have to be there going to Club where these these people can shoot at any time that is not your place it doesn't matter the the security somebody can just take a bullet AK-47 and spray you look at the country where AK-47 can kill 200 people within a short time it's like a nation at war with itself why do we possess AK-47 are we at war with somebody and people mad people intoxicated people people with hatred with Richard hatred can tick and kill people but with the Holy Ghost with decision for the Lord you won't find yourself at those places Club is not your place the dancing Hall is not your place if you want to dance You Can Dance for the Lord amen when I was in Mexico oh my I hadn't done slide up in a long time their songs will just lift you up and I was I was on the floor I charged and I was dancing and I realized my shoe was a shoe I bought from UK I said no this is the right shoe I was dancing and jumping and dancing around I didn't care whatever the Holy Ghost just touched my heart and I was just dancing to the glory of the Lord I dance and dance and dance and dance and dance and I got two brothers who are from Ghana one from uh he's a pastor in Cancun oh my we had a wonderful trial dancing we dance and dance and dance and Dance So In Christ you have all your joy [Applause] you have all the positives if you can sing sing for the Lord if you can talk talk for the Lord if you can speak speak for the Lord if you can love love the people of the Lord but don't give you affection don't give your talent don't give your life to the world because the life the world will destroy you but you've got a choice to make the cosmos this world the order of the world or the logos the word of the Lord you choose the logos it's a tenor amen Abraham it doesn't mean you're not going to have problems Abraham had his problems but Abraham was rest assured because Melchizedek gave him the promise and Abraham received making that milk kisadek is me and I am a kisadic and even in this trial the Lord came down he said my seven Abraham can I do anything on Earth without telling you amen little sister little brother when you walk with the Lord God will speak to you directly from your heart there's a song that said it's me it's me oh Lord I'm in need of prayer it's me it's me oh Lord how many door pray not my pastor not my father not my mother it's me oh Lord I'm in need of prayer it's me it's you it's You O Lord we are need our prayer God speak to Children God speak to adults amen and I think Linda Owens example is a good example for us even the young people that when you stand for the Lord God will stand for you amen never compromise for the high school program don't compromise for the for the disorder of The World God made you a man you're a man you're a girl you're a girl you're a boy you're a boy you are not confused about who you are amen your biological you can see brother Solomon and you can realize his name is a man you can see his wife sister uh knowing me and she's a woman even if they close your eyes let me show you something and a woman come close to certain circumference you can feel in your spirit thus there's a woman around you if you're a woman and you'll close it blind for you and they bring a man at certain point your spirit can detect that there's a man close to you so you don't have to have struggle to know you're a man or a woman but if you made that choice you're gonna live with it people made that choice and later they repent but they are destroyed their physical body they are destroy their biology and you can't bring their biology back it's a aggressive spirit that is moving all over the world is starting here it's moving all over Europe even they want to permit in Africa they want to push it everywhere and African nations have signed law no this is not our culture we don't impose superimpositions on United States United States please stay where you are don't impose this is on us amen and even if Nations who are political can't take they understand that we are not gays and lesbian we know we are you a daughter of God a Son of God you should be able to take your stand that this is me making sadak is my father the Lord Jesus Christ is my father Adam Kato and bow to the things of the world Amen Glory Hallelujah to the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen let's go to some of our quotes I've got a bunch of something things to say so what I'm going to do is I'm going to run through quickly and then from there we can hit on the Highlight so let's go to the the next coats right just give me a second to get water glory to the Lord I want to look at Auntie Jemima one more time and I we have preaching today has preached her some of the time how her faith stopped Jet Plane which was scheduled to fly from I think from a somewhere in um I don't remember this I don't remember it keep going go to Memphis Alabama right Memphis Alabama Tennessee thank you Memphis Tennessee to wherever he was going to she had grounded a plane but today we're not going to talk about her faith we're going to talking about how she knew who she was revelation of Who You Are it's good to know who Jesus is by you have to know who you are amen a lot of Christians in the world know who Jesus is they can tell Jesus the son of God is God in flesh but they do not know who they are and the most important thing is not just knowing who Jesus is but knowing that you are Jesus walking on two feet amen so let's go to I'm going to do a little bit of reading let's go to the next one because of for the sake of time I don't want to read go to the next one Bingo okay this is uh anti-jamima she declares her position now babram was at the airport he didn't really know the Lord was telling me to leave the airport plane is about to fly and to just walk he was walking on the street singing only believe not knowing exactly what the Lord had in mind for him but he kept walking and they kept walking and the Lord kept telling go this way go that way you think God doesn't speak God has a voice God speak amen he speaks and then he met Auntie Jemima he didn't God didn't re review that part about Abraham the only sad he revealed to him is you just take a walk okay let's keep going pass this route turn left turn right he didn't know what was in store and she made this uh Khalid lady called Auntie Jemima and she said let's see where to read from okay a typical Aunt Jemima is she had a man's what a man's tied around her head she was looking over the gate I come walking by going maybe probably it was the son's church that she taught her around her head because the son she would tell a story let's keep going he said she looking tears over her big fat cheeks she said good morning person I said how do you do Auntie it caught me that's what the prophet began to have a revelation this woman doesn't know me how did he know I'm a preacher person is a preacher good morning person said did you ever hear about the China might woman that had a baby the Lord promised her the baby and the baby died I said yes she said I was a woman that way and I promised the Lord that I will raise my baby for him and said Lord give give the Lord give husband and I a lovely boy and said person he took the road that was wrong when he was about when he he's about a few years ago and said he got a dangerous disease veneral disease and said it went so long on him we didn't suspect it parents thought he was a Christian boy maybe he goes to church on Sunday with Dad and Mom but then after high school when school closes he goes to his girlfriend he goes to live with women thinking he was deceiving that their mom little didn't know he was deceiving himself because when the price come you're gonna pay the price so he took the road that's wrong and then he got a dangerous and the parent didn't even suspect that that was his lifestyle and said now he's laying in the room dying saying the daughter has given him all kinds of shots he said he can't get well and he said he's been unconscious since yesterday the daughter was back here and said look for the West at any time probably that's the only son they have and then look for the West at West at any time there was no hope for him his blood was four plants and nothing could help him at all and said he's dying and said I got down on my knees and said I pray and I said I prayed oh lord said I is a woman like the China might where's your where's you Elijah that's where you when you know your position in the Lord in the times of hardship in challenging times you can invoke to the Lord the Lord this is me I'm your daughter amen and I have such and such need and Lord you have to come to my Aid the Lord ordained a prophet just for the woman because the Lord knew that this woman would need Elijah Lord where is your Elijah I need Elijah here amen and I said and just begin praying I said I prayed and prayed and the morning just before they lied okay the Lord told stand at this gate let's go to the next one okay yeah and there was let me see let me see let me just cut it short okay let's read and that was her back was wet when she's been standing she wasn't telling me anything wrong and that was brother I'm talking about the woman's comments I walk into the house there was a great big Husky looking boy and she patted him he was laying there with blanket on his uh in his hand and it was um and he was saying mommy it's so dark when you get to the end of the road the choices you make it be like a video recording it will come right back to you it will not come to your dad it won't come to your pastor it will come to your mom it will come to you yourself if you truly Jesus Christ You're Gonna See the Light you're gonna sing Glory you're gonna meet Jesus Christ himself but he chose the things of the world the darkness will be upon you he said it's so dark what did I get to it's so dark and said do you know Mommy you you know you know your name he didn't seem like he recognized her he couldn't even recognize her mom mommy going on he was unconscious condition said can we pray person I said yes ma'am let's go to the next one okay is going to jump in the red he said Mommy it's getting light okay after they prayed said mommy is getting lied in a few moments he was up and on his feet I passed through there a few months he met me at the Abbey station said brother Abraham I'm perfectly normal and it's all gone from me the love of her mother a mother who knows her position and that is important why we need a revelation personally for ourselves your neighbor cannot have it for you he can pray for you can enjoy his anointing you can enjoy the anointing of the church you can enjoy the anointing of your family your parents but you need to have your own Holy Ghost for yourself amen the Lord has to reveal himself to you personally glory to God let's go to the next slide go to the next go to the next rice so now I want us to ask a question Auntie Jimmy my knew her position do we know our position in the Lord as not as a church as individual because you have to know Christ for yourself and I think the question we should ask ourselves is do I have Christ in me do I have the Holy Ghost In Me regardless of how the world will look fanciful to you one day you're gonna drop this flesh it came from the earth it will go back to the Earth the only thing you're going to take with you not your money not your riches not your house the only thing you can take with you is the Lord Jesus Christ in you the revelation of him in your life amen now I want us to look at this scripture Revelation 10 8-11 if you can read uh it's three full scriptures Revelation 10 1-6 is the Lord Jesus Christ himself the mighty Angel who descended put one foot on the ground one foot on land and one foot on the sea and then when you read Revelation is called the book of symbols it's not talking about a big huge might Mighty Angel come in and put one foot on West Palm Beach beach and one foot on some land no is the baptism of the Holy Spirit Landings to represent people when the Lord put his life in you human being is made up of about 85 percent water or even more liquid and the rest is just dust it's just one spoonful of dust take a big old fella if you die and in India where they increment people it's just one one spoonful the rest is just a fluid and the gases that we make that is all we amount to so but when the mighty Angel the Lord himself by the holy ghost power buy for the nation he quickened the seed in you that is claiming you footprint is possession so when you put one foot on the land your land and one foot on they see your body you have become the possession of the Lord Jesus Christ you become a temple of the Living God and if the Lord is with you who can be against you let all the demons come against you the Lord will stand for you amen and so we need to seek one thing Revelation so what I want to read Revelation 6 sorry 10 one to six is the lord lord Jesus himself and then seven is his prophet Elijah and the seventh angel messenger that was his ministry the Lord has fulfilled his path William has done his part but this scripture is for you and I to fulfill and he said and a voice which I heard from Heaven speak unto me saying and said go enter the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which stand upon the sea and upon the Earth what is the little book for is the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ is the message of the hour when you eat a message it will make you who you are it will give you in your ministry it will help you to surmount the challenges of life and I went and and on I went to the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up it shall make that thy belly bitter but it shall be in their mouth sweet as honey when you receive the Gospel it doesn't mean everything is going to be cozy and roses flowers even gonna have more trials but that trial is growth that trial is blessing that that trial is character building right that trailer will make you become the spoken word of the Living God that when you speak your word is eternal when you speak Angels come to your disposal because you are speaking as what as Elohim and verse 10 and I took a little book out of the okay I think I've read up at verse 11 and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples Nations tongues and Kings amen now when you take the book it's going to change your mind it's going to change your heart it's going to change your thinking but then when after eating it going through all the trials and affliction and when the Lord is formed in you when it sees a reflection in you he send you out there my son Solomon my son my daughter hadasha go there and manifest me whatever he'll put you in your school in your in your neighborhood in your job in your ministry when you speak when you speak is not you the flesh speaking the sound is the flesh but they say being on the inside of you speaking and your word can bring healing your word can bring Resurrection your words can raise the dead your words can transform lives that is the power of the spoken word and this scripture is what is for us at this moment amen Revelation 10 7 Ram has finished his part yeah yeah like John the Baptist he said I must decrease that he might increase John came and John we didn't he had only a minister of six months he was preaching God was going to bring the Messiah he was going to come then it wasn't too long he changed his sermon he said behold the lamp of God that takes away the sin of men when it was revealed to him that Jesus Christ is the messiah and within Sixth Man John finished his ministry he said I should decrease I'm not even worthy to untie the list of his shoes and John faded he was put in prison the character said killed him and now Jesus Christ came under sin William Brown was a type of John the Baptist he came as well finished his ministry I mean brought all that the Lord ordained him to bring and then he left the sin now you can't claim William Abraham yes we can go back and refer to him he said type for you and I to fulfill our ministry what the Lord did in him the Lord can do the same thing in you amen it doesn't have to do all of them if your daughter is sick if you've got a wayward son the same holy ghost that was in William Abraham that was Auntie Jemima the same oligos is in you and you buy your token can place your token on your son or your daughter can place your talking on your loved ones and claim them back to Redemption because you've got their power you've got the authority the absolute Authority and you have an absolute necessity and so the supernatural authority of God has to display in your life amen babram said that the most important thing in the believer's life is what money is that right it's our houses and buildings is your family but it's a revelation of Jesus Christ because with that you can do all things because God created the world by his word by his faith do you know God has to believe his own word when he spoke if you put it in time it could be billions and trillions of years but he has to sit back lay back and believe that his word that has gone out of him will never come back void the word will accomplish what is meant for and so when you speak When you pray you believe your prayer that the prayer that you prayed will never come to your Void it will go around and around and around and work and work and work and it will bring your desire to pass amen do you know God has a Feeling oh God doesn't have feeling we imagine God has some abstract object somewhere but it's a being he has feeling like you the Bible said that we have a high priest who can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities so God has feeling you know God expresses love and he also want to receive love do you know you have confidence in God God wants to have confidence in you and he has confidence in you amen when you stand as a Son of God as a daughter of God God is proud of you when you can manifest his glory amen that's why he'll book Moses when Moses was crying become a crying baby and the Red Sea he said Moses why cry speak and go forward because he had made Moses god unto the people the Lord has made you God in your family he has made you God in your job he has made you God in your church he has made you God in the community that you shine reflect me amen and be like Auntie Jemima know who you are and stand on your grounds that this is me I'm a China might woman and I need my son to be raised up I need the resurrection of my daughter I need my wayward children to come back to me Lord I claim them by my token the devil has no control over my children I speak them into creation I spit a new birth into their lives it doesn't matter their circumstance I see only your promise and the manifestation of those promises in my life Glory Hallelujah to the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the Lord put gifts in you and as you go along you might not understand everything but the things the Lord is doing in your life a lot of children coming to church with your parents sometimes it could be bothersome to you other kids are going to play football they're going to play basketball on Sunday but you have to come with your parents don't let it be a bothersome something to you but let it be a blessing that the Lord is forming your life for your ministry for your calling on Earth amen just like a Esther Esther experience were taken to Heaven while she was young but the Lord wanted to form a character of prayer and fasting because she was going to be a queen she was going to be a savior she was going to be the Lord Jesus Christ to the people of Israel and deliver her people as a queen as a daughter of God and so the Lord formed that character in Esther Carter burden was it wasn't an easy one we are not made to enjoy trials no not even Jesus he was 100 human being and 100 said Elohim as a human being he cried I said he wanted to Swerve the cross he even prayed that if it's Thy word let his cross over me but that was the purpose on Earth if he didn't go you wouldn't be sitting here and the Holy Ghost in him sent Angels brought Moses and Elijah brought through furnace to strength him Lord go to Calvary if you don't go the whole generation the whole human race is condemned and the Lord rose up and went to Calvary for us and now he's done his part and he's put his confidence in you and I that is your turn you are not supposed to die but you're supposed to manifest him right here on Earth Glory Hallelujah to the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus Christ let's go to the next slide please now this is a marriage certificate I want to dwell here a little bit how can you have a marriage certificate when you are not married take a let's say you have a son or a daughter and your son comes back to Mom I found a girl a beautiful girl I want to marry okay that's great and then introduce this lady to you then he comes back a couple of weeks or months and said Mom the lady is asking me to wall my house my properties the land you give it to me the business to her you're gonna son he said he's a gold digger you are not even going to the courthouse you have not come to church and now this girl is asking you to wall your houses and properties no run away from her because as a bride you can't claim what the man has you have to be married to the man before you can make a claim the same way we can't remain bright and claim all the Eternal blessings of the Lord you have to marry to him as Jesus as as personally by the Holy Ghost baptism and as a generation the Lord married us to the Son of God Barbara married us to the Son of God let's do a little reading here invisible union he said well you separated from the your first Union by spiritual death when you get the Holy Ghost you don't die naturally but Supernatural you die now you are born again or remarried to the new spiritual union of not your natural life of the things of the world but of eternal life that gem that was in you at the beginning found you now your old book is gone your old book is the character the nature with your old union now your name is in your in your old the name in the in your old has been transferred do you mean to tell me my old book God put in the sea of his forgetfulness all your sins all the atrocities that you committed the Lord deleted them they don't exist no more you stand perfectly before God now your name is now in the new book not the Book of Life not the natural life but the Lamb's Book of Life which is eternal which is with the lamb redeem not the old book of your natural Union by by your new but your new bride Hallelujah your name is now your name sorry your new life is in the Lamb's Book of Life your marriage certificate Hallelujah where your true Eternal gem from the beginning takes hold amen and look at when the prophet prayed this message November 25th 1965 just before a month a couple of months he passed away onto the other side the prophet gave a marriage certificate for us because as as a generation we were married to Jesus Christ I'm not talking about the term time will not save you I'm not talking about jargons whether you call yourself bride wife Queen Jesus Christ if it's only temps and jargons and movement my brother my sister there's no power in it but I'm talking about your position in the Lord what the Lord has done for you we are not going to physically be married to Jesus Christ in the physical sense like the way we marry our wives no but we're talking about marriage in the Supernatural sense that we are in the age where like just like John the Baptist he came to look for a bride for Christ in his generation the Lord has seven churches Paul came to look for a bride Arenas Luther math and Columba Wesley Martin Luther and after all of them married the bride to Christ at that time by receiving the word of the day the Holy Ghost marries you to Christ amen don't look at God is going to come in millions of Christians you know women are jealous men are jealous too So Adam is going to say hey I opened it I opened a Redemption story I'm the one should claim the Lord and then Sarah will say no it's me and who is going to marry to Jesus Christ if it's a natural sense it's not a natural marriage the natural is a type of the spiritual so the Lord uses natural things to tie the spiritual but the marriage itself is the word the supernatural they feel funny the Lord himself taking your flesh and uniting your flesh with the spirit that's the invisible Union of the bride of Christ which is the wife of Christ at this hour that will become a wife and because you're a wife you can claim everything that the husband has Glory Hallelujah you're not just a bride that someday is going to marry you that's why Jesus told the people that you don't know the scriptures on the other side we don't marry you with your family where my brother made his wife he said he's going to call me sweet he didn't call him sweet I said my brother so on the other side in the Ethiopian the natural side is meant to to procreate children here the theophany speaks into existence the sufani doesn't have to marry a physical wife so the marriage is going on right now amen not at the other side amen the marriage of Christ is going on right now it's been going on since creation anybody that has the Holy Ghost baptism is married to Jesus Christ you are missing Jesus Christ you are the Queen of Heaven that is living in this earth Glory Hallelujah let's go to the next slide now this is another concept of the Bible that we only look at the future and look at the past almost every message believer will tell you that yes they've been what is this six raptures which you can talk about Enoch talk about Elijah talk about Jesus talk about a couple more others but what is going on even in the church ages let's look at what the Rapture you know the concert of the Bible if you look at it linearly you get stuck God moves in cycles and in circles God doesn't move in linear because we are human beings he let us understand things linearly but when God is moving he moves in a circle and I'll explain a little bit is that to be to be sure Christ The Mystery of God revealed the whole Rapture now Luther was a part Wesley was a part the prophet was a part How can there be a part I think we are waiting for Rapture are we not waiting for rapture but here's the professor that there was a part not even that now but they said they was so the churches were rapture but we didn't see nobody flying anybody jumping and flying in the skies what are you talking about let's go on he said well he said it's uh if they are if they aren't a part just in the Revelation that they was making up their body feet toes arms and so forth until the head which we get into that a few minutes that makes the entire rapture so the Rapture is parts it's a circle it's a body of the word which is Christ so the Rapture is Christ it's nothing it's strange the things that will imagine our human mind that's not the way the word the Lord does it it's so simple that's one time it will pass on top of our head and that that's what Israel did Israel read Isaiah 55 and all the books they were read it and they would take the scroll and read it every day in India synagogues but when the Lord Jesus Christ came a virgin birth they said no that's not him he didn't come in the house of kaiaphas you should have come in the land of Iran it didn't come in the land of Moses he came in Judah but did you know he said he's a trap line of the Trap of Judah and so now we think so high we think the things of the Lord Rapture you are if you have got the Holy Ghost you've been raptured it might sound like a big nugget if I've got Christ in you you've been raptured and you're still being raptured each time you the Lord strike a revelation in your heart it elevates you bring you up higher and higher and higher so is that it's a path that means the body the body of the word outside of that you are lost so the Rapture people even in the churches were raptured already how can it be those are the things that we when we the Lord reveal it to us it empowers you the essence of the power of Revelation when you know who you are you don't get scared am I going to be the Rapture am I not going to make it is my son going to make is my father going to make it gonna make it because we're a human being but when the Lord reveals to you that you have been raptured the Rapture is in you and the end result will come out amen there's more there's the resurrection is in you even resurrected and you still resurrect because the Bible says Jesus Christ Hebrews 13 8 same yesterday today and forevermore he's done it already he's doing it and he was still doing it because he break one cycle in your life and manifest something in your life break another cycle and manifest in your life even in our own personal lives we see certain Cycles manifesting Our Lives amen Glory Hallelujah let's go to the next one the Feast of the trumpet the Holy Ghost was bound two thousand years how can Holy Ghost be bound can you even entertain the idea of somebody binding almighty God but then if Christ is in Sister Jemima and we offices you are burning the Holy Ghost if you refuse Christ in brother Jack you are binding the Holy Ghost because Christ cannot impact your life if you refuse Christ in Sister verse you are binding the Holy Ghost so that is the way we bound the Holy Ghost not like somebody has a chain the devil chain God Almighty then the sea will come and flood the whole world and kill other human beings because there must be somebody on the throne to order the universe but if God is in his people and you have what you call it you you you you discard them you refuse them you have bound the Holy Ghost if you receive brother Smiley brother Troy sister Brown sisterica sister Virginia you have refused the Lord Jesus Christ so in the church ages when God sent Paul they kill them they become martyrs and they bound God gave them the spirit of a lion to stand they gave their lives women they rip their stomach take their belly children from their belly and they will soon ever deny Christ they will tell you that if you want us to spare your wife denounce Christ both there and their wife and their children they'll go through death the Lord give them a spirit of a lion to stand and they were murdered thousands and millions of them that's how they bound the Holy Ghost but the Lord was reflecting through a star in the night time that's when we see stars so all the seven churches were night time when the church was in darkness but God sent Messengers to reflect their light unto them amen but after seven churches Brown preached at someone it is the rising of the sun we are no longer in the night time but the Lord has come the Lord himself came 1963 Abraham talked about the picture of Jesus with his white wig how can you see since uh somebody's awake without not seeing her how can I see but but Solomon Wayne he sued and then Solomon is not in the suit that was Jesus even describe his beard Black Beard describe his face you have pictures features but he didn't show his body why didn't he show his body the body was already on Earth that was a marriage that was the wedding that's invisible to the world but it's made visible to you to marry us as a generation to the Lord Jesus Christ so now the Lord is dealing with dealing with you directly amen that's why he's done with the uh what they call it the serving messenger he's finished with them but it's giving you the fifo ministry the five is the outermost part this uh fingers that's where the Lord is touching you the faithful Ministry perfecting you the pastor the prophet the Evangelist the teachers and the apostles that is the Lord himself perfecting you through his faithful Ministry Glory let's go to the next one let me just run through quickly the seven trumpet now Abram wanted to preach the seven trumpets and he thought it was going to break just like the seven seasons were broken and the Seven chair changes but each time you try to preach there was something hindering him David had a air-conditioned room with Billy Paul and everything ready but there was something pressing him and let's see let's go to read okay yeah let's read read a little bit let's read a lot and said when I went into prayer I told the wife I'm going in and sincerely I knelt down before God to pray and he revealed to me that them seven trumpets sounded under the Sixth Seal I have done preached super naturally how can reject preach at someone he doesn't know he prayed a sermon but a Troy you a preacher how can you preach and you don't know that I preached someone how can kwaku preacher someone how can brother Solomon lead a song and how can it be when you sang this song you sang an amazing belief you sang Only beliefs Lord are this sing only believer I sang Amazing Grace he said the only belief sounded under your Amazing Grace when you sign that is the supernatural manifestation of the word and so the prophet didn't have to preach the seven trumpet they preach the Feast of the trumpet it's now a feast it's a party and join the blessings of the trumpet because he's been preached supernaturally pertain to Israel so now let's rejoice the wife of the lamp is what the major the lamp is ready and his wife is ready so let's have a feast and enjoy the marriage of the lamp the atonement has already been attuned for us your sins have been atoned The Mercy Seat is already cleared for you the Lord has already taken your sin individual people come at their time but as as the work of God God has already finished the work amen Glory Hallelujah let's go to the next one I think I read it right let's go and yes if you want to and remember in the 60 the same thing let's go to the next one yes I want to be our Bible student so I want to just highlight this so that we can go back and and study now God never sent two major prophet on Earth at the same time we talk about Revelation 11 Moses and Elijah did Moses and Elijah the two the two Olive plants now most and larger is going to come now the prophet said in numerous standards God never never his contrary to his his ambition program to send to major prophet now Moses a major prophet and Elijah is a major prophet so how are they going to bring them at the same time we're going to find out how they come because God didn't make people the same the same Holy Ghost is in brother Solomon the same only goes his brother brother Marquis but when you go to their home they run their home differently they may eat different dinners they made different their wives can cook different food so no two human meats are exactly the same God made this one differently put this material in him give him this understanding and God uses him this way he made the other minister this one put his understanding him and uses him differently he made this sister put his gift in her or this understanding in her and he uses this sister differently he put this gift in this person so there's no two people they will have the same Holy Ghost the same almighty God in them they have the same fundamental Doctrine but the understanding the way of doing things are different because the almighty is trying to achieve something with brother Solomon and he's trying to achieve something else with brother Marquis so you can't compare brother solomona quiz neither can you compare but a Solomon because God made them differently to achieve his purpose you can't compare to brother brother smiley how am I going how is somebody going to wear my shirt he's going to rip off his skin and the forgive him but a Smiley's suit they're going to say could you borrow from somebody everybody's gonna know I borrowed it God says you to just probably go to it will be halfway here I'm going to look like look like a southern preacher with their long suit here but the Lord brother brother brother brother Smiley the way he is for a Divine Purpose and if I try to be better Smiley I'll Crush I can't I can't reach his height he made me the way he is and I have can be who I am God has made me and brother Smiley can be who is the Lord has made him and the business find out what Lord what have you made me to be and when you show you won't imitate somebody copycat your brother you won't try to be somewhere where you don't belong to it's so sweet when you are in the perfect will of the Lord when the Lord placed you here it might be the littlest the minutest but it's the best in the side of the Lord and you can do their best when you find yourself that way amen let's go okay I didn't read it so now God always is a prophet a man if you use a bunch of men you get different ideas see each man never did he have two major prophet on Earth at one time he takes one so that the other one can take his place for another another message he never has to he has one at a time let's go to the next one praise be to the Lord and never this another message and uh I never too major prophet on Earth at the same time let's go to the next one okay let me let me finish then every man is different he's got a different makeup if God could get one person that's all he has to have right in his hand he can do what he wants he just have to have one in the days of Noah this of Elijah this of Moses so God just need only you and he can do a whole lot let's go to let's go to to the next amen now let's see how the prophet taught us the 64. how much and Elijah Ministry is going to be because that he never God bring two major prophet but the same God said is going to send Muslim Elijah let's see future homes I remember God took Elijah after the Rapture and translated or transplanted him back among his people to take the place as a prophet among his people pretty soon he'll do that so he's going to transplant them just like he did and he has kept him alive these 2500 years he's to appear again notice his race Moses from the dead where is his grave can anybody find it read a book of Jude the Archangel disputing with the Archangel Satan the Lord rebuke you disputing over the body of Moses and here Peter James and John were standing there looking at him on Mount Transfiguration Prophet don't die Christians don't die dropping your body on this flesh you're still alive let's go a little bit further so right in the land where the mountain is to be raised we have we have supernatural beings standing here but this ice is not ordained to see them it takes the supernatural eyes of Faith to see them let's let's go to the next one right so another church age he said there'll be some standing here which shall not his death to they see the son of man coming in his kingdom and the three Apostles just see that the order of his second coming they saw him transfigured there on my on the mountain top his Remnant was Blazing white and his face Shone like the Sun at its Zenith and they and there as he appeared stood Moses and Elijah on either side are we waiting for Muslim Elijah to to raise from their dead they are not dead we're gonna see Moses spirit of Moses and Elijah ministered in brother I think brother Jack must change in Shreveport Louisiana amen and we are in raja's church right now here let's let's go to the next slide let's go to the next slide most and Elijah let me see where am I oh I think I've done finished with this one haven't I oh no okay okay great great is where I want to be so now they have to taste it that's right after their Ministry is finished why the seventh Angels Ministry the seventh Angels Ministry Elijah's Ministry to the seventh angel not why don't why could you not rather I'm trying to say the seventh Angels Ministry then be by Moses if it's Immortal the same as it could be by Elijah why don't they why didn't God just send Elijah you've done your work hard now Brian was time to say that the seventh he was the seventh angel Ministry let's go back to even Malachi four five and six if you go to Malachi four three he said let's read a little bit if you can give me the scripture quickly just to show that Baba exhibited those two Ministries he was Moses and Was Elijah I said behold I'll send you the the scripture before behold I'll send you Elijah the prophet can brother Solomon you're going to help me let me see Moses right here okay you want four or three yeah three okay and you shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this saith the Lord of hosts remember ye the law of Moses my servant which I commanded unto him remember ye the law of Moses my servant which I commanded unto him and hub for all Israel with the statues and judgments go to the next one behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse now it's a behold remember the love Moses and Brahma was a law Giver unto you and I he was also a prophet to the Pentecost house so he had the ministry into two and let's go to the next slide stabby that one person let's see a prophecy that went forth that within three months there'll be a the spirit of Moses and Elijah ministering and the spirit of Jesus we are ministering in Jack Moore's Church spoke the word of the Lord Nancy this is very profound and then when I got to Shreveport Louisiana a woman who is a gifted woman her name is Mrs Schrader many years ago when the angel of the Lord met me down here at the river the first time and appeared in the light the words that he spoke there 11 years later God uses our women too 11 years later 11 is a number of perfect discipleship when I walk into a meeting this little woman Rose and spoke in tongues and interpreted it was word for word the same thing that the angel said the woman wasn't there when the angel of the Lord spoke to Abraham but the same angel that spoke to about Abraham was in the woman and spoke to the woman Abraham to confirm something from Abraham and this same little woman I work in Tabernacle or the place at Shreveport that will end the live Tabernacle the Holy Spirit move on that woman and said word for word what he said to me up there on the hill the spirit began to move and give interpretation for telling Revelation by prophecy and things like that so now this is things that problem the Lord told him when he called him at the cave praying and a woman has put the same thing brother from Louisiana from Brother Life Tabernacle Shreveport Louisiana the same Holy Ghost doesn't have limitation let's go to the next slide just wanted to wrap up the revelation of Jesus Christ okay he said now before a little man stood up a Baptist woman come over not knowing what she could do she was standing in the midst of the meeting and the Holy Spirit fell on her and she began to speak with tongues a Baptist woman from the First Baptist Church of Shreveport and then she didn't know what she had did and then before she could say anything the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit gave the interpretation and said thus says the Lord within three months there will be the spirit of Moses Elijah and Christ ministering in this Tabernacle there it happened perfectly but we are still waiting for Musa and Elijah our entry was ministering in brother Jack's Church Jack Moore's Church when the prophet went there how how did it happen the spirit of moose and Elijah was right there into Tabernacle prophecies fulfilled and we are looking it way ahead and some somehow well behind but the Lord is doing the right thing right here and as we are in brother Jack daft's Church I have no doubt the spirit of Moses Elijah and Jesus Christ is ministering to you and I right now amen if you can believe it the Lord is here God bless you Sister Dixon she's Struck it amen Glory Hallelujah God bless you my precious sister God bless sister Dixon amen Glory Hallelujah to the Lord amen the Lord is here let's go to the next one Glory Hallelujah is that an okay a Baptist a man from Meriden Mississippi started to lay his hand on his refrigerator to get something out of the refrigerator and the spirit of the Lord came upon him he spoke in tongues not knowing what he was doing you know Baptist is really don't speak in tongues baptism if you get baptized and they have that Revelation strong you can never take it from Baptist but they don't speak in tongues sometimes they don't drown if I'm right and things like that and he spoke in terms not knowing what he was doing and before he could understand what he was doing the Holy Spirit spoke back and said go to Shreveport Louisiana my servant will tell you what to do and he came there and said I don't understand this never happened before Oh My we are living in the last day just before the coming of the Lord amen I think we went to pray for brother Troy's mom if I'm right somewhere maybe two years ago and but I Smiley if I'm right by Jack but I Smiley spoke in tongue right there our Lord is omnipotent God Amen Let me just go let's go for it let's go to the next next slide Glory Hallelujah is that the last slide praise God hallelujah I'm done almost almost done now let's come back so now the Lord is here that's a surprise I'll go a little bit further okay are you done I'll go I'll go further okay I'm not done it's like is he dead that's not better quickly I'll go a little further God bless you the Lord is here the Lord is not far from us and let me tell you something I will help you even little sister little brothers that you might not know what God is doing you might not understand just like the woman that spoke in tongues they didn't even know that the Lord is fulfilling scriptures in their lives when I was just a new quiet let's say five years in the message there was a time a pastor was traveling and then he was going to Belgium through the pastor at the Belgium church has died and then he was going to help them raise a pastor and also baptize not baptize dedicate a baby so I took care of his house and we went for a youth meeting on Saturday just an informal meeting pray and fasting and after that I remember that they can pick me up from there we went pray had they just used prayer and fasting pray and fasting and I came back in the night and I had a dream in the dream somebody told me this is Paul Paul and Paul was one of my heroes before I even got the message I really love I read about Paul I did in my high school we had what they call Bible knowledge so I took that course for for three years and I know almost everything in the book of Acts Paul's genius I just can recite it to you verbatim so Paul was one of my will I say my mentors my heroes in the Bible and I said Paul I will show light to see Paul and there was a fire if I you know we use natural things to understand spiritual things not the physical fire burning but the glory of the Lord he was wearing a green smoke and the glory of the Lord around him I said that is Paul everything about him and the dream left I didn't understand I was just I wrote in my little dream book but later in years when I was a kid at the age of about maybe 6 10 12 the Lord revealed to me that I was spent part of my life in the United States I knew that one always in my heart but I never knew I would go to Latin America I never had a clue I never knew nothing was mean so later in years that dream became oh I see just like the the the Auntie Jemima I knew that God has a purpose for this dream letting me see Paul because part of Paul is not poor as a human being but I also be doing what Paul is doing my calling part of it looks like Paul's Ministry and I said Lord that's why there was a sister we had an international meeting and pastor's wife one person's wife said brother the Lord showed me a dream or for the seven Church ages from Paul to Wesley and I didn't see by the brown said Lord where's my prophet I didn't see my prophet and so the Dream came back again and he showed me from the first one Paul and I saw about Abraham and I said I had a desire a need and said Abraham would the Lord do this for me there's a desire on my heart would the Lord did this for me he said brother if I if I know how to draw I could draw the face of all the seven churches Messengers I I said I have a place Crystal clay only I'm not an artist I can't I can't put it in in drawing God loves his people and then that ComEd their heart to the Lord sometimes we look at things in a big fanciful way but the Lord that is so simple that if you are not careful to pass on top of you the Lord is doing things right here the Lord has you right at the right place young sisters young Brothers I'm glad some of you have found your ministry hold on to it don't let nothing of the world attract you but hold on to what the Lord is teaching you under the ministry of brother Jack you might not understand everything right now but as you grow up it's going to be real to you amen just a little bit about the testimony of in Mexico I left after my graduation on May May 12th I left May 15 to Cancun and in my mind I was going to kind of do some holidays in Cancun I'll preached just one service and continue to Vancouver cruises where the meetings was actually going on they were having a 52nd anniversary they had a message very early and the pastor passed like seven years ago he scored brother Lazarus and then they call it Lazaro and his son brother Ruben is a is a pastor so his brother invited me for his daughter's wedding but I smiled and I said the time was so close so I wish I could come but I couldn't make it so brother come for the anniversary if I know it's kind of short time for you short notice so come for the anniversary and I heard about I think two months I said okay that will work so we went I went to Cancun on the 15th and the 15 I thought I was going to rest no you are here to preach the person was actually gracious brother we thank you tired if you want to rest in the hotel but I said I can't I can't stay in the hotel where something is going on I'm not that kind of person so don't worry just rest for one hour I'll come for you and then we administered on the Monday and then Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday morning took a flight to Cancun and we had I met two ministers pastors from Puerto Rico don't the Stars where are you at so I met one their lovely brother oh and they they are into plant-based food is that why is it Amanda okay she's not here the pastor told me they've done plant-based food for 30 years I said wow and it's called Pastor has done it for 25 years and the whole church is plant-based food I said wow that's amazing it's like since Amanda is everywhere where have we go assistant Amanda so we went to uh Veracruz they call it a San Andreas and it was one of the amazing times brother they have other ministers from their brother is called brother Leonard he said he knows uh I think brother Smiley and it's one of the brothers from Okeechobee and he's been there for years ago and passes from uh they call a place called Berlin it's close to Mexico but they were colonized by the British so they speak English we have finished it from then a lot of pastors Minister from Mexico brother there's nothing greater than to be in the perfect rule of the Lord the Lord did so many things I'll just caption it and then we have how many Services Agency services and I preach the pastor doesn't tell you when you're gonna preach you know he said he just will tell you where it is a brother two of you are going to preach Saturday on Sunday one of you can take Saturday one of you can take Sunday and I told us okay you can take Saturday and say oh no I'm I'm older I need more time to prepare so you take Saturday I said okay no problem and I have preached in many places and I thought we could have I had never felt weak after I don't I don't eat I'm not a breakfast person and I don't eat when I go to the puppet that's why I drink a lot of water to restore my the water in my body and brother sisters the Lord is God is real if you serve the Lord the anoint the supernatural presence the songs even the young girls where are your tambourines never despise the days of small things use your tumble bring it to church and use it from tamborine God will upgrade you something else remember Jack just said that God hasn't subtract he doesn't divide but he would ask and multiply if you take the tambourine Faithfully God will keep adding you'll bring more attitude out of you you bring things out of you you bring this out of you so what the Lord has given to you use it the lord gave David just a slingshot and David did what with the slingshot kill a bear a lion and even go out with a strange screenshot so what God has given to you make use of it amen and a man when you serve the Lord God blesses your generation I believe the man I never met a man but I saw his children his grandchildren great grandchildren his daughters-in-laws and I saw this man serve the Lord he was a Visionary he bought a land outside the city city center about just about less than 15 minutes and it was cheaper a case of land he put his little church over there and now his children grandchildren they all have learned to put put their burdens over there so all of them leave the children were telling they used to live in the city but they come back to the to the town just about 12 minutes from the city and mangoes were everywhere those Place mangoes were like wildlife every house has gone mangoes in the woods eating language like that natural mango not a hybrid type everywhere they pack like half suitcase of mango to take you to the next station I didn't know next time I'll go there and fly directly to the US because I had went to another place to preacher I gave all the mangoes to to the person's wife over there laughs they live just natural and you could see the blessing of the of the brother Lazaro and his family when you serve the Lord some of you sisters the decisions you take now is going to affect your generation the blessings of your fathers grandmothers grandparents your pastors will run into your life when you say the Lord you might be the first person in your generation to receive the word of God this way but God is using you for a purpose and a blessing that is given to you you might not even manifest everything by your children your children children who manifest those blessing and the people they blessed will call them bless amen so from there we went to a young brother that's his testimonies called brother Rolando he invited me about six years ago and it's not even 20 it's going to be 20 now you are shocked right brother Joseph is showed he invited me to preach in his uncle's church and so when I went I said brother I will be able to preach one day and go say brother I've invited you for six years and you're gonna just come here one day no way it's not going to happen he said we're going to hold you for one week but I'll be missing for I'll hold you for three days so you have to be here for three days I said okay so we were there we preached in the ankles chat for three days and the parent told me the story said the son almost died when he was young his land collapsed but the Lord Prayer they stuck on their grounds and prayed and believed the Lord against the doctor's report and the Lord brought their son's life back and God is using the ministry it's a young brother 19 almost 20 you'll be 20 July and he was with the ministers the brothers all they will just admire him Brother Joseph brother Xavier and and all of you little sisters what the Lord is doing for you take it to heart don't take it lightly God give you a pastor by the jack who loves you who preaches his heart laboring every day at night Adam Smiley by the Jerry brother Quentin Jr and mothers and sisters you might not know they are watch Towers watching over you tomorrow you're gonna find out that thank God I chose I made the right decision even if you don't understand it you just stay here the more you understand even if you feel bored coming judge is bored I want to go have fun you just stay remember Esther stay tomorrow you're gonna find out why God is putting you here while somebody probably a baseball having fun so called having boyfriends drinking alcohol drinking marijuana you know why God separated you from this life and put you here amen and then from there I went to Mexico and went to Mexico City the capital we had three services over there and one brother gave you a testimony he said brother his son is a minister I have a little uh online prayer group and we preach ministers young ministers old ones so one of the youngest brother Carlos is his father said brother I have a testimony for you remember you sent a recorded prayer I said I don't even quite remember say I was sick and you send that prayer to my son Carlos he said the doctor declared me that I was going to die in a couple of days so I should do my documents because they didn't have any hope for me and then my son brought that um that prayer prayer that you prayed in Spanish at the hospital and I believe it that I'm going to be healed and I didn't prepare no documents because I knew I wasn't going to leave my wife and my children and said I listened to it and the Lord brought my life back I didn't die because I said I was from foot to this week was gone and the daughter said there's no way you're going to be vegetable because you are you're gone so just if you have a document do it before you finally give in and he said I didn't give in but I believe the Lord and the prayers that you pray for me and the Lord brought my life back you wouldn't know what God will use you for unless you surrender yourself to the Lord from there I went to another church to preach and I preach in Spanish I had one young brother who was going to interpret for me but he was so nervous I said brother don't worry we're gonna be fine so I'm preached in Spanish if I miss something I don't know the past tense too much but if I miss something the brother will help me the next I preach Wednesday and Friday and Friday I preach totally in Spanish and if I did told me that they prefer me to preach in Spanish the church in Veracruz one of them the the pastor and the family said brother preaching Spanish I said my past tense is not good I need the translator so they've got their brother from Phoenix Arizona but I was it's called Jose and then he when I preach it goes into the system he picks it up and then translated in a speaker and they hear it so some of them I just move on as a brother move on move on and I kept moving on kept moving but I said I'm enjoying myself keep keep on going we understand everything they said at least we understand 95 and I said my past tense is not good I'm selling the past and so I need a translator and then I did it but you don't need the translator just just keep going and so the Lord did something marvelous I preached 11 sermons in five churches and I came back on the Monday which is may not June the 5th oh I it was a round trip so I came back to I didn't plan to go to Cancun I had an open ticket because I know God has something I didn't know exactly so I just bought only one-way ticket and then when I was coming back I passed through Cancun I left Saturday came to Cancun uh Saturday then the Pastor said we're going to have two services but then he also they have a Minister's meeting where I mean he says meet every I think two months about 36 something pastors so say brother uh from there you're gonna put two Services You Preach in my church I'll take you to one church and then when he came he was worn out just like me so say brother we're gonna make it once ever say praise God hallelujah I was almost a dead body so we had one service and the Lord did marvelous and then the next day he went to Dubai he has a business in Dubai he went to Dubai on the Monday and he said brother we're gonna have a meeting in my church on August and I want you what you taught us I wanted to you can't preaching every one of the churches so teach with the pastors so that we can also teach it to our people so they have a they're going to have a meeting in August somewhere ending of August and invited me and the brother from Belgium to come and minister to them so keep in prayer and I think that's just a just a snapshot of the trip to Cancun the Lord bless you and shall we be on our feet [Applause] our heavenly father we thank you for this day we give all the glory and

the word of the Lord today for my brother quaku the essence of Revelation amen amen oh so good uh for us to recognize a man what God is doing in our midst right now uh it's um he was it started off by saying how the Sadducees and the Pharisees Pharisees looking way off Saturday's failing to see what was happening right there before them and uh and it's very easy for us to get into the same type of spirit today we miss what God is doing right in our midst uh always look into some future work and you know as he was even just going through the Rapture and how you know there's uh this raptor is going to be made of of Believers of every age right you know and I believe the scripture tells us the first would be last and last will be first so you know those that went down a man that went down before us in this latest in age they'll be the first ones to rise up you know and then just work back to the other ages but we we know that it's going to be a part of this this body amen it's made up of Believers from every age every age we're just so happy to be a part of this age so we we thank God for that 11 services and I don't know how many days that's a lot of preaching I tell you uh we thank the Lord for using our brother amen there in uh in South America and pray that God will just open up the door for him to go back and to be used again but that that's uh it's just wonderful to see uh people leaving this pulpit and going into all the all the places in the world and just taking the Gospel of Jesus Christ that is the the uh the Great Commission that the Lord Jesus has called us to go into all the world and preach the gospel and it's happening right here at Spirit and Truth Tabernacle so we thank the Lord amen I'm not going to delay the time we'll have a word of prayer and uh and then quickly uh I just want to just give you all a quick update as to where we are with some things and uh and then we'll go from there all right so let's just pray father we thank you for uh the this wonderful service you gave us here on today thank you for uh your servant brother quick who just get themselves out of the way and just sharing the word with us Lord how just little examples that he was just sharing along the way how it's so easy to miss what God is doing even just how the prophet was trying to go and preach the trumpets and you had to show him it's already been preached it was supernaturally preached and and gone after you showed it to him he began to realize what had already happened God opened our eyes open our understanding we can see the things that you're doing even right now the prophet told us that uh man is always thinking for what you did and they always thank you for what you're going to do but they fail to thank you for what you're doing right now so father we just asked that you Lord Jesus amen will continue to open up our understanding and give us Revelation that we might draw closer to you blessed Lord the people as they prepare to leave this place but not your presence give traveling mercies to each and every one and uh we again want to remember brother Robles that she would touch him God raise Them Up For Your Glory fathers our prayer we commit them down to your hands it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen praise the Lord you can be seated Amen in the presence of the Lord amen foreign thank you
