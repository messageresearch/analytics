[48:32] to talking about um
[48:35] uh running up your credit cards for uh
[48:37] for for christmas and she said you you
[48:40] didn't know that you said you don't you
[48:42] don't know why you were saying what you
[48:43] were saying and i said she said but i
[48:46] need you to know that you were saying
[48:47] that for me and she's online
[48:49] and i'm here saying something that she's
[48:51] online i don't even know she's like that
[48:52] was for me she said of some things that
[48:55] i had done and um and it caught up with
[48:57] me
[48:58] and you know so i got to a little
[49:00] situation where i was a little impressed
[49:02] you know with my finances and
[49:04] and uh she was telling me she says um
[49:07] you know i i was kind of in between two
[49:09] spots and and i needed to pay my taxes
[49:12] and she said but i also needed to pay my
[49:15] tires
[49:16] and i said so what i i decided to do
[49:19] was just uh sit write a check for my
[49:23] tires
[49:24] and write a check for my taxes
[49:26] and i just sent them both out by faith
[49:32] and i just i like you know i'm like wow
[49:35] she said she said i knew that i need to
[49:37] do this and i didn't have enough money
[49:38] to do it but i hadn't paid my times i
[49:40] said so i'ma just write it out by faith
[49:42] and just i just began to pray and just
[49:44] lord i don't want that check to bounce
[49:46] god i don't want that check to bounce
[49:48] lord i need you to move you know and she
[49:51] said all of a sudden um somebody could
[49:53] start driving down the street
[49:55] and uh she says a car that she's
[49:57] somewhat familiar with you know and
[49:58] they're like why is this person driving
[50:00] down the street and they just driving
[50:02] they're driving next thing they stopped
[50:03] at a house and what they want
[50:06] and they get out the house get out the
[50:08] car and they come up to the house and
[50:09] they're not going to do it like okay i
[50:10] wonder what they want and they walked up
[50:13] and they uh put an envelope in a ham
[50:16] praise the lord
[50:19] and uh they say they said god told me to
[50:21] give you this
[50:25] say god told me to give you this and
[50:27] left just like that so she went and
[50:30] counted up the the money that was in it
[50:32] and it was enough to take care of
[50:33] everything
[50:35] so her checks didn't bounce and god made
[50:37] a way
[50:39] he said prove me
[50:41] see when i open up the windows of heaven
[50:43] and pour you out blessings where you
[50:45] have room not enough to receive
[50:48] so she she she not only did that so she
[50:51] you know she paid a time she paid uh
[50:54] her uh her taxes and then she gave an
[50:56] offering so god bless you my bev amen we
[50:59] appreciate the testimony and

[51:07] god still works his word still works
[51:11] amen if we just trust him amen he will
[51:14] do exactly what he's saying
[51:16] amen so praise the lord amen we thank
[51:19] god turn with me to genesis chapter 15.
[51:23] glory hallelujah
[51:26] genesis chapter 50
[51:28] amen
[51:30] and um
[51:31] verse 19 i i trust today
[51:34] that we will be able to bring a little
[51:37] closure to this thought that we've had a
[51:40] man will hurt people
[51:42] hurt people
[51:43] amen i have been talking i've been
[51:45] reading from genesis but i've never
[51:47] actually talked about it so hopefully
[51:49] today we can do that now genesis 50
[51:52] and in verse 19 says
[51:54] and his brethren also
[51:56] went
[51:57] and fell down before his face and they
[52:00] said behold
[52:02] we be our servants
[52:04] and joseph said unto them fear not
[52:08] for am i in the place of god
[52:11] but as for you
[52:13] he thought evil against me
[52:16] but god meant
[52:18] it unto good
[52:20] to bring to pass as it is this day
[52:23] to save much people
[52:26] alive
[52:27] amen
[52:29] let me let me go into verse 21 here says
[52:32] now therefore fear ye not
[52:34] i will nourish you
[52:36] and your little ones
[52:38] and he confident them and speak kindly
[52:41] unto them so we have a word of prayer
[52:43] father we thank you
[52:45] for
[52:46] amen all that you're doing in our midst
[52:49] we thank you father for allowing us to
[52:51] be able to gather
[52:53] uh once more um we pray father that as
[52:56] we come here today that you administer
[52:59] uh to our hearts and to our needs you
[53:01] know exactly what we stand in need of
[53:03] let the word of god
[53:05] do only what the word can do and we
[53:08] trust god that you would just not only
[53:10] be with us but those that are at home
[53:12] those are looking online be with them so
[53:15] many god going through in their bodies
[53:16] we pray a special touch upon each one
[53:19] and uh god those that are away for
[53:21] whatever purpose actually should be with
[53:23] them and thank you for the powerful
[53:25] testimony you gave us there from my bev
[53:27] and may you just continue to prove
[53:29] yourself to your people uh over and over
[53:32] and over again we ask god that you would
[53:34] take control of the thought that'll be
[53:36] presented here today and may you receive
[53:38] all the glory and all the honor from
[53:40] our gathering it's in jesus name we pray
[53:43] amen amen god bless you you can be
[53:45] seated
[53:46] um again we want to continue our thought
[53:49] of
[53:50] hurt people
[53:52] hurt people this is part three we have
[53:54] just been bringing this um
[53:57] because it is a real thing
[54:01] uh in in church uh we have seen it i
[54:04] i've brought it to you from just various
[54:06] different angles we you know we see it
[54:09] in family uh i i've given you some of
[54:11] the results of what happens in families
[54:14] uh when uh families go through hurt
[54:17] um you know we're giving you you know
[54:19] just just uh some talked about last time
[54:21] and i was so blessed how um when last
[54:24] sunday we were there at the at brother
[54:26] west coast and brother nathan got into
[54:28] talking about brother ramsey
[54:30] and uh i just finished preaching about
[54:32] brother ramsey how he was a minister
[54:34] that was hurt
[54:36] i mean he was a pastor that got hurt you
[54:39] know uh and in ministry and just through
[54:42] his hurt it caused him to give up cause
[54:44] him to quit just throwing the towel and
[54:46] uh you know and and and i think the the
[54:49] reality that i was trying to bring to is
[54:52] that yes even here in the pulpit
[54:54] ministers get hurt
[54:56] ministers can get hurt this is something
[54:58] that we all
[54:59] uh have to bear jesus said it's it's
[55:02] impossible for offenses not to come
[55:06] amen so so as as believers we understand
[55:09] that there will be offenses in our life
[55:11] there will be things that uh we will we
[55:13] will endure things that we'll have to
[55:15] you know go through uh but uh the the
[55:18] thing of it is is not to allow your
[55:20] experiences to make you bitter
[55:23] come on somebody but the experiences
[55:25] actually come to make you
[55:27] better
[55:28] right so not to make you bitter but
[55:31] better and what you need to understand
[55:32] what you need to try to find out god
[55:34] what are you trying to speak to me amen
[55:36] through this situation what what where
[55:38] are you trying to take me to uh it's one
[55:41] thing just i i i mean i know we've all
[55:43] been hurt but i don't i don't think we
[55:44] should dwell in our hurt
[55:46] amen that that's not where we should
[55:48] dwell is in our heart uh i mentioned it
[55:51] before god wants to turn your pain into
[55:53] purpose
[55:54] amen god wants to turn your process into
[55:58] praise
[55:59] amen god wants to turn your misery into
[56:01] a masterpiece
[56:03] glory to god and god can turn your mess
[56:05] into a message
[56:07] right so god can use your hurt if you
[56:09] will allow him to
[56:11] amen so you know today we want to you
[56:14] know try to give some practical things
[56:16] that we could use to to make it through
[56:18] her it's one thing to be heard and you
[56:19] know and a lot a lot of skills you know
[56:21] man yeah i've been hurt but where are
[56:23] you at now
[56:25] glory to god where are you going to
[56:27] amen so so so so the thing of it is is
[56:29] that we want to be moving forward in
[56:31] christ i want to use amen just a little
[56:34] a a little quote here this morning from
[56:36] the sermon uh or actually the book the
[56:39] 20th century prophet uh there was a
[56:41] statement made here to a woman that was

[1:00:22] amen and and not only did she suffer in
[1:00:25] her own body but she caused others in
[1:00:28] her church to suffer from what she was
[1:00:30] going through
[1:00:32] my god and i want to tell you here her
[1:00:34] freedom came when she was able to
[1:00:37] release the lie and accept the truth
[1:00:40] and i'm here to tell you this morning
[1:00:42] your freedom will come when you're able
[1:00:44] to release those lies
[1:00:47] and accept god's truth over you
[1:00:50] glory to god
[1:00:52] amen
[1:00:54] so you know uh i want to maybe come back
[1:00:56] to her a little bit later amen but but
[1:01:00] the thing that the thing of it is here
[1:01:01] is that we got to understand god has
[1:01:03] purpose for everything
[1:01:05] and and hurt you know is is something
[1:01:07] that uh like i say it's real you know
[1:01:10] the definition
[1:01:11] of of of hurt is
[1:01:14] to cause physical pain
[1:01:16] or injury
[1:01:17] uh or to cause mental pain or distress
[1:01:20] to
[1:01:21] or you can have a lot of mental pain
[1:01:23] mental distress
[1:01:24] amen you got to let it go
[1:01:26] you got to find some kind of way to let
[1:01:28] it go i'm talking even to myself this
[1:01:32] morning you got to let it go
[1:01:34] amen i i i can i don't want to be a
[1:01:37] brother ramsey
[1:01:39] but but i mean things happen you got to
[1:01:41] find a way to let it go
[1:01:44] god i'm giving this thing over to you
[1:01:46] and ain't nothing i can do about it
[1:01:48] amen ain't no sense of me crying about
[1:01:51] it ain't no sense of me worrying about
[1:01:53] it i'm here to release it to you father
[1:01:56] oh glory to god amen i was reading a
[1:02:00] little something there this week and you
[1:02:01] know brother branham saying you know
[1:02:02] sometimes things happen
[1:02:04] and maybe somebody do something and it's
[1:02:06] hard for you to say something nice to
[1:02:08] that person
[1:02:10] y'all ain't gonna talk to me
[1:02:12] but sometimes people say something or do
[1:02:13] something it's hard for you to say
[1:02:15] something nice to him
[1:02:16] it's very hard he said he says what he
[1:02:19] says if it's hard for you to say
[1:02:20] something nice it says what you need to
[1:02:22] do after amen you get out of their
[1:02:24] presence go on your knees and start
[1:02:26] praying for them
[1:02:29] and you don't realize why you praying
[1:02:31] for them god is changing you
[1:02:34] oh glory to god
[1:02:36] god is actually changing you while
[1:02:38] you're praying for them
[1:02:40] and before you know it the next time he
[1:02:42] comes to any presence you can greet him
[1:02:44] with a smile
[1:02:45] because god has dumped something on the
[1:02:47] inside of you
[1:02:49] but you got to be willing to release it
[1:02:56] no sense in holding on to it
[1:02:59] you know i i was uh looking here at a at
[1:03:02] a little statement here and i think i
[1:03:04] have time to read this so let's let's go
[1:03:06] to godhead explain
[1:03:08] amen a quote out of godhead explain here
[1:03:11] the prophet is is making a statement
[1:03:13] here
[1:03:14] a amen because you know i want to tell
[1:03:16] you denominations are usually started
[1:03:19] because somebody got hurt
[1:03:21] another church gets started because
[1:03:23] somebody got hurt
[1:03:24] amen that's how church did another
[1:03:26] church get started another church so i
[1:03:29] sometimes a pastor come and preach and
[1:03:31] he's not trying to say nothing that
[1:03:32] caused no hurt but he's just saying just
[1:03:34] preaching but somebody take it the wrong
[1:03:36] way hurt and i'm leaving i'm gonna start
[1:03:38] another church
[1:03:41] and i'm gonna tell you when the church
[1:03:42] has started like that it usually don't
[1:03:44] last
[1:03:45] amen you can't build a church like that
[1:03:49] another thing i found out you can't you
[1:03:50] can't you can't build your ministry on
[1:03:52] putting other people down
[1:03:56] you got to lift yourself up by putting
[1:03:57] other people down something wrong with
[1:03:59] you
[1:04:03] your ministry got to be built on the
[1:04:04] word of god
[1:04:06] all right look the prophet says this and
[1:04:08] god had explained this now you see what
[1:04:09] i mean brethren
[1:04:11] i'm driving towards
[1:04:12] the one thing jesus christ
[1:04:15] and the uniting of the body of jesus
[1:04:18] christ
[1:04:19] that's what my purpose is that i don't
[1:04:22] say nothing about hey you ain't baptized
[1:04:24] in jesus name you're going to hell
[1:04:27] now he said now that's nonsense
[1:04:30] oh i i i love this i
[1:04:33] ah
[1:04:34] i feel jesus
[1:04:37] i'm i'm going to tell you something
[1:04:38] there's many people that are not walking
[1:04:41] according to this message because the
[1:04:44] message has been given to them the wrong
[1:04:46] way
[1:04:49] we don't package it right
[1:04:53] i mean we put people in hell real quick
[1:04:56] amen if they don't see it this way you
[1:04:59] set up a denomination in the message you
[1:05:02] got to wait for god to show them things
[1:05:04] ain't nobody forced this revelation on
[1:05:07] you
[1:05:08] amen it came to you by grace you got to
[1:05:10] let god give it to them by grace
[1:05:13] amen then jesus tell peter flesh and
[1:05:16] blood have not revealed these things
[1:05:18] unto you but my father in heaven has
[1:05:21] revealed it
[1:05:23] you gotta wait for god to open things up
[1:05:25] to people and until then be patient with
[1:05:28] them
[1:05:32] you gotta you amen you just gotta be
[1:05:35] patient and you gotta handle things with
[1:05:37] nurse's gloves
[1:05:43] that's to try your patience you
[1:05:44] understand
[1:05:46] that's to try your patience
[1:05:49] oh glory to god
[1:05:54] i don't say nothing about
[1:05:57] hey you ain't baptized in jesus name
[1:05:59] you're going to hell brother bran i'm
[1:06:01] saying now that's nonsense
[1:06:03] even though being baptized in the name
[1:06:05] of the lord jesus christ is the right
[1:06:06] way it's just the approach
[1:06:11] sometimes our approach creates hurt
[1:06:14] and i'm and i'm here to tell you i see
[1:06:16] many people that that have walked away
[1:06:19] from this truth because they've been
[1:06:20] hurt
[1:06:23] it was presented the wrong way
[1:06:25] and i'm gonna tell you another thing
[1:06:27] even even we as believers we've had to
[1:06:30] grow
[1:06:33] we didn't have this thing all together
[1:06:35] at the beginning when we first got ahold
[1:06:37] of this it was like dynamite we were
[1:06:38] blowing everything up
[1:06:42] we blew up everything
[1:06:44] and in the process we destroy everything
[1:06:48] destroy our families destroy our homes
[1:06:50] destroy the church
[1:06:53] we not lost jobs because of a man being
[1:06:56] unwise
[1:07:01] we have to grow we have to develop we
[1:07:03] have to mature
[1:07:05] amen
[1:07:07] i thank god the word can bring us to
[1:07:09] maturity
[1:07:10] amen not only are we all hurt people but
[1:07:13] we have hurt people along the way
[1:07:16] oh god help us
[1:07:18] all right let me keep reading i'll tell

[1:09:17] grace of god we all be gone with our

[1:09:52] you know when when when i when when the
[1:09:54] churches came together last year we i i
[1:09:57] remember making some statements that you
[1:09:59] got to be ready for the
[1:10:00] growth right and you got to be ready for
[1:10:03] the things that are going to change
[1:10:04] around you and and as you get ready for
[1:10:06] it you're bringing a uniting

[1:10:13] oh
[1:10:14] hallelujah oh i i i know what i'm
[1:10:17] talking about
[1:10:19] amen because if you're not prepared you
[1:10:21] don't know what the next season gonna
[1:10:23] bring
[1:10:24] amen and if we can't get over these
[1:10:26] petty hurts
[1:10:28] these petty you know your sister didn't
[1:10:31] mean to do that you know your brother
[1:10:33] didn't mean to do that
[1:10:35] why are you gonna let the devil
[1:10:36] let you hold on to things like that
[1:10:39] let it go
[1:10:42] let's go on here let's go on let's go
[1:10:44] let's go on
[1:10:46] my god he says um
[1:10:49] then and so you know what the general
[1:10:51] superintendent over the church called me
[1:10:53] up
[1:10:54] he said did you know what you did last
[1:10:56] night now they couldn't get nothing
[1:10:57] outside of the service
[1:11:01] this all they got this brother patty
[1:11:03] sitting on the on the platform he said
[1:11:04] do you know what you did last night
[1:11:07] uh my second night there i said what i
[1:11:10] said we had a wonderful meeting
[1:11:12] oh hallelujah i can go back to last week
[1:11:14] we had a wonderful meeting but how many
[1:11:17] gonna find something
[1:11:19] in the weekend oh god
[1:11:40] i i i i have to let it go i it's
[1:11:42] something
[1:11:44] something something did happen last
[1:11:46] weekend and i'm i'm sitting here
[1:11:47] debating i'm gonna have to let i'm gonna
[1:11:49] have to pass it by
[1:11:52] because something did happen and and and
[1:11:54] i have to release it
[1:11:56] i'm gonna just let it go and the way i
[1:11:58] release it just don't say nothing
[1:12:01] just don't say it
[1:12:03] don't say nothing
[1:12:05] i mean but you just don't know sometime
[1:12:07] what i mean like i said medicines can
[1:12:09] get hurt different things you're accused
[1:12:11] of this accused of that but you know
[1:12:13] what you just gotta let it go
[1:12:16] let me let me just keep reading
[1:12:20] amen
[1:12:22] hey
[1:12:23] man
[1:12:24] you know you know just you know when i
[1:12:26] do that sometimes y'all don't realize
[1:12:28] when i have to pause i have to stop and
[1:12:31] and just process real quick
[1:12:33] lord do i say that or not because
[1:12:36] sometimes the devil
[1:12:39] actually want me to say something
[1:12:41] that could create some problems
[1:12:44] now i can be justified in what i'm
[1:12:46] saying
[1:12:48] right but but but i got i got to use
[1:12:50] wisdom
[1:12:52] is that really edifying anybody
[1:12:55] is that helping anybody is it only
[1:12:57] helping me
[1:12:59] is it helping because i'm not here for
[1:13:01] me i'm a gift to the people
[1:13:07] so as a minister i got i got to be
[1:13:09] careful take us to take a step back
[1:13:11] pause call time out
[1:13:15] before you just release something out of
[1:13:17] the atmosphere
[1:13:20] all right so sometimes even in preaching
[1:13:22] you battle it because the devil right
[1:13:24] here trying to say that say that
[1:13:26] i ain't saying nothing but what god told
[1:13:28] me to say
[1:13:30] all right
[1:13:31] all right all right let me keep going
[1:13:34] i'm trying to get through this series
[1:13:37] but but he says he says um
[1:13:39] my second night there said what so we
[1:13:41] had a wonderful me he said you had a man
[1:13:44] on your pulpit was a sinner
[1:13:47] now holy ghost filled man they calling
[1:13:49] him a sinner he said i said i i didn't
[1:13:52] know it who was it i it said that mr
[1:13:54] petty
[1:13:56] and notice that the title they use mr
[1:14:00] petty
[1:14:01] rather than
[1:14:04] rather than brother give him his two
[1:14:06] respect
[1:14:08] brother repented brother petty
[1:14:10] not mr petty he said he says oh i said a
[1:14:14] sinner well i said he's an assembly of
[1:14:16] god preacher brother and look at how
[1:14:18] brother brandon put that brother on the
[1:14:19] end of it assembly god preacher brother
[1:14:22] he said yes but he's still a sinner
[1:14:26] because he hasn't been baptized right
[1:14:29] and i said brother pray tell me why i
[1:14:32] said he's got the holy ghost
[1:14:34] he said brother branham what did peter
[1:14:36] say repent and be baptized in the name
[1:14:38] of jesus christ for the remission of
[1:14:40] your sins therefore your sins cannot be
[1:14:43] remitted until you're baptized in jesus
[1:14:45] name
[1:14:46] now watch them now because they don't
[1:14:49] build their doctrine on this
[1:14:51] glory to god but they don't realize
[1:14:53] their doctrine is about to be shook by
[1:14:56] another scripture
[1:14:58] that's why you can't put a period on
[1:15:00] what you believe put a comma there
[1:15:03] look at this he says is that the formula
[1:15:04] my brother he said that's the formula i
[1:15:07] said god upset his own apocart and then
[1:15:10] in acts 10 49 for while peter yet spake
[1:15:13] these words the holy ghost fell on all
[1:15:16] them which heard the word and they had
[1:15:18] never been baptized at all then god gave
[1:15:20] the holy ghost to people that wasn't
[1:15:22] even converted i said where in the world
[1:15:24] are you standing now
[1:15:30] see brother brandon was trying to show
[1:15:31] him a
[1:15:35] a greater way to handle things
[1:15:37] and this is this is what i what i want
[1:15:39] to try to drive home for for hurt people
[1:15:42] there's a greater way that we can handle
[1:15:44] things
[1:15:44] amen because hurt people usually kind of
[1:15:47] pull back to themselves
[1:15:49] hurt people go into isolation hurt
[1:15:52] people want to avoid everybody
[1:15:54] you know that that's what hurt people do
[1:15:56] when you get sick yeah that's what
[1:15:57] you're about you just want to lay in the
[1:15:59] bed
[1:16:00] you want you want to try to avoid
[1:16:01] everybody and you know and i understand
[1:16:03] that's the way i feel i don't want to be
[1:16:05] bothered by nobody i'm not feeling well
[1:16:07] right now
[1:16:08] amen this is what hurt people do
[1:16:11] but when you're hurt spiritually you do
[1:16:13] the same exact thing
[1:16:15] you withdraw from people
[1:16:17] you pull back and god don't want you to
[1:16:20] pull back he wants you to go forward
[1:16:23] look at this
[1:16:24] look at this brother brahma is going to
[1:16:25] teach us a lesson here
[1:16:27] let's go on in the quote you asked
[1:16:29] brother where you standing at now you
[1:16:30] say the man was a sinner but god filled
[1:16:32] him with the holy ghost even though he
[1:16:34] has not come to the understanding of
[1:16:35] water baptism he's still got something
[1:16:38] you got to learn to work with people
[1:16:40] where they are
[1:16:43] i don't have seen too many times where
[1:16:45] people try to i mean
[1:16:47] let me you know i'm gonna use fishing as
[1:16:49] an analogy how many i mean you don't you
[1:16:51] ain't even caught the fish yet
[1:16:54] you got your knife out and you about to
[1:16:56] scale it you don't even have it yet
[1:17:00] you gotta wait to catch the fish before
[1:17:03] you can scale a fish wait until you got
[1:17:05] him in the boat
[1:17:07] in the bucket
[1:17:08] amen then bring your knife out
[1:17:11] my god but don't scale until you catch
[1:17:13] them
[1:17:15] oh you got to change this you got to
[1:17:17] dress like this you got to you know what
[1:17:19] they can do all that
[1:17:21] amen just for you
[1:17:27] they can do it all just for you but when
[1:17:30] they get out
[1:17:32] and by themselves they're doing
[1:17:33] something you want something that's in a
[1:17:35] person's heart
[1:17:36] that'll keep them 24 hours a day
[1:17:39] seven days a week not just on sunday and
[1:17:42] wednesday
[1:17:44] we want the real thing in people's
[1:17:46] hearts
[1:17:49] hey if god can give you that conviction
[1:17:51] he can give that conviction what you got
[1:17:53] to do is pray that god would give it to
[1:17:55] him
[1:17:56] pray and wait
[1:17:58] pray and wait
[1:18:02] that's the hard part
[1:18:04] the waiting part because we we we we we
[1:18:06] we microwave christians
[1:18:09] we pray and we want something right now
[1:18:12] god don't do things that way he he teach
[1:18:14] us patience
[1:18:15] and so and if you don't realize how long
[1:18:17] you got to wait ask noah he waited 120
[1:18:20] years abraham waited 25 years amen pray
[1:18:23] and wait
[1:18:24] let me go on look at this this this this
[1:18:28] this principle that we get from here he
[1:18:30] says um
[1:18:32] you know
[1:18:34] you know we're going to do
[1:18:35] so we're going to draw a little ring
[1:18:38] and drawing you right out of our circle
[1:18:41] it was the man telling brother branham
[1:18:43] after he just had a good service because
[1:18:44] brother branham had brother patty
[1:18:47] see this this preacher is picking up
[1:18:49] something petty
[1:18:54] and he says uh brother man in response
[1:18:56] to the man says then i said i'm gonna
[1:18:59] draw another one
[1:19:01] i'm gonna let you draw a circle and
[1:19:03] you're gonna draw me out but um since
[1:19:05] you can draw
[1:19:06] then i can draw
[1:19:08] and you're gonna draw a circle and
[1:19:11] you're gonna draw me out but i'm gonna
[1:19:12] draw another circle and i'm gonna draw
[1:19:15] myself right back in
[1:19:20] oh we don't let the devil draw circles
[1:19:23] in here
[1:19:24] but it's time to i want you to get your
[1:19:27] finger in the sand and draw a bigger
[1:19:30] circle put yourself back in fellowship
[1:19:33] with your brother or your sister
[1:19:37] says then i'm gonna draw another draw
[1:19:39] another one and draw you right back in
[1:19:41] again so i said you can't draw me out
[1:19:43] cause i love you
[1:19:45] so you just can't do it i said there's
[1:19:47] too many of you brethren out there that
[1:19:49] love me and believe in me and i said
[1:19:51] they'll come anyhow i said they'll come
[1:19:53] and you can't draw me out if you draw me
[1:19:55] out i'll draw you back in
[1:19:57] when you make one circle god uh by his
[1:20:00] grace will let me draw another one and
[1:20:02] pull you right back in that's right draw
[1:20:04] them right back
[1:20:06] again
[1:20:07] it's time for us to draw bigger circles
[1:20:10] amen stop letting hurt people keep
[1:20:12] hurting people but let's draw bigger
[1:20:14] circles and just let the love of god
[1:20:16] amen be expressed from our hearts to
[1:20:18] others
[1:20:18] god uses human beings
[1:20:21] to redeem other human beings
[1:20:23] i want to go back to a scripture here in
[1:20:25] john 18
[1:20:27] 35 brother troy uh brought this to us a
[1:20:31] man a few
[1:20:34] months ago and and i'm picking up this
[1:20:36] uh this scripture again because i want
[1:20:38] to just kind of make this point i'm
[1:20:40] trying to move on
[1:20:42] jesus was crucified
[1:20:44] by hurt people
[1:20:47] jesus was crucified
[1:20:50] by her people
[1:20:51] the religious leaders were hurt in john
[1:20:54] 6
[1:20:55] a man
[1:20:56] and and that caused him persuade the
[1:20:58] peop persuade the the people of that day
[1:21:01] uh to ask for barabbas rather than jesus
[1:21:04] in matthew 27 but we pick up in john 18
[1:21:07] 35 this scripture pilate answers jesus
[1:21:11] is standing before pilate amen before uh
[1:21:14] judge to be judged amen pilate answered
[1:21:17] him and am i a jew
[1:21:19] in john 18 35 says thine own nation and
[1:21:23] the chief priests have delivered thee
[1:21:25] unto me
[1:21:26] what hast thou
[1:21:28] done
[1:21:29] amen and when brother troy was
[1:21:31] ministering on this he you know he he he
[1:21:33] he made the statement he says pilate is
[1:21:35] you know just using it in today's
[1:21:37] language what have you done to make
[1:21:39] these people so upset
[1:21:42] what did you do jesus i mean these
[1:21:45] people are running you to my to to my
[1:21:47] hall to be judged by me and i can't
[1:21:50] figure out what i'm not a jew i don't
[1:21:51] understand your law and why this and why
[1:21:54] that but they running you here to be
[1:21:56] judged what have you done
[1:21:59] hallelujah i want to go back to john 8
[1:22:02] verse 36 and let's kind of show a little
[1:22:04] bit of what was done
[1:22:06] jesus amen did not come necessarily to
[1:22:09] try to hurt people intentionally amen
[1:22:13] not like this preacher that got in the
[1:22:14] pulpit and he told that lady she was a
[1:22:16] witch
[1:22:17] and i just got i need to say this i need
[1:22:19] to say this
[1:22:21] you say she a witch
[1:22:23] but she came to church to be prayed for
[1:22:27] she came to church to be praying for why
[1:22:29] didn't you pray that spirit off of her
[1:22:32] but you just let the lady leave there
[1:22:34] you a witch
[1:22:35] and just let them let her leave there i
[1:22:37] don't know what what that what was in
[1:22:39] that preacher's mind to do that to that
[1:22:41] woman to have her messed up like that
[1:22:44] she was hurt emotionally she was hurt
[1:22:46] mentally she was hurting all kind of
[1:22:48] with and it hurt her church
[1:22:50] because of that but the lady was there
[1:22:53] to be delivered why didn't they pray for
[1:22:54] deliverance
[1:22:56] maybe he thought he was something by
[1:22:58] just telling how she was a witch
[1:23:00] oh my
[1:23:02] but thank god she ran into a real
[1:23:04] prophet
[1:23:06] amen someone that told us they just lied
[1:23:08] on you and all you got to do is release
[1:23:09] that lie and you'll be free
[1:23:11] accept god's truth of what he said about
[1:23:13] you here
[1:23:15] amen jesus came
[1:23:17] uh not not intentionally bringing hurt
[1:23:20] but what jesus did was bring truth
[1:23:24] and here i'm here to tell you something
[1:23:25] this morning the truth does
[1:23:29] hurt
[1:23:31] now the truth is not coming to hurt you
[1:23:33] in a way amen to to uh to make you make
[1:23:37] you bitter
[1:23:38] but the truth comes in a way to to help
[1:23:40] you to make you better
[1:23:42] glory to god the truth will hurt
[1:23:46] glory to god but but but the truth
[1:23:48] actually has a healing bomb in it
[1:23:50] if we could accept it
[1:23:53] now jesus brought fruit to the religious
[1:23:55] leaders of his days they did not want to
[1:23:57] receive it now look here in john 8 36
[1:23:59] pilate want to know what hath thou done
[1:24:02] here are some of the things that jesus
[1:24:04] did john 8 36 says
[1:24:06] if the son
[1:24:08] shall
[1:24:09] if the son therefore shall make you free
[1:24:12] ye shall be free indeed
[1:24:15] amen i know that ye are abraham's seed
[1:24:17] but ye seek to kill me because my word
[1:24:20] have no place in you he's given them
[1:24:22] truth
[1:24:24] i speak that which i have seen my or
[1:24:26] seen with my father and you do that
[1:24:29] which you have seen with your father now
[1:24:30] look at this truth that's going now he's
[1:24:32] he's telling him now you of your father
[1:24:34] the devil that's what he give me to tell
[1:24:35] him says they answered and said unto him
[1:24:38] abraham is our father
[1:24:41] jesus saith unto them if you were
[1:24:43] abraham's children ye would do the works
[1:24:46] of abraham my but now you seek to kill
[1:24:49] me a man that have told you the truth
[1:24:53] which i have heard of god this did not
[1:24:57] uh of this did not abraham ye do the
[1:24:59] deeds of your father then said they to
[1:25:02] him we be not born a fornication we have
[1:25:05] one father even god now they're trying
[1:25:08] to use their words to even hurt jesus
[1:25:10] we be not born a fornication
[1:25:13] oh hallelujah see i'm gonna tell you
[1:25:15] something jesus knew he was not born a
[1:25:17] fornication he was the virgin born
[1:25:21] son of god and let me tell you something
[1:25:23] you don't have to wear the title
[1:25:27] that people assign to you
[1:25:29] when you know who you are
[1:25:34] we be not born upon uh we be not born of
[1:25:37] fornication we have one father even god
[1:25:40] jesus said unto them if god were your
[1:25:42] father you would love me for i perceived
[1:25:45] forth and came from god neither came out
[1:25:48] of myself but he sent me
[1:25:50] glory and look at this now he says why
[1:25:53] do you not understand my speech even
[1:25:56] because you cannot hear my word oh
[1:25:58] here's the one that hurt him here it is
[1:26:00] here it is ye
[1:26:02] are of your father
[1:26:04] the devil
[1:26:06] and the lust of your fathers he will do
[1:26:09] he was a murderer from the beginning
[1:26:12] identifying where this murdered spirit
[1:26:14] came from it came from satan
[1:26:17] amen he was a murderer from the
[1:26:19] beginning and abode in the truth because
[1:26:22] there is no truth in him when he
[1:26:23] speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own
[1:26:26] for he is a liar and the father of it
[1:26:29] when jesus gave them this truth this
[1:26:31] created a great hurt
[1:26:34] it caused hurt amongst these religious
[1:26:36] leaders
[1:26:37] and because of the hurt that they
[1:26:39] experienced amen they themselves began
[1:26:42] to call for his crucifixion through the
[1:26:45] people
[1:26:46] oh hallelujah how many have been heard
[1:26:49] in church because a preacher has told
[1:26:51] the truth
[1:26:52] and then they go spreading all kind of
[1:26:54] nonsense
[1:26:55] all throughout the church and what they
[1:26:57] try to do is kill that man's influence
[1:27:01] they i mean brother branham say you
[1:27:02] don't have to necessarily take a knife
[1:27:04] amen and stick it in the back of
[1:27:06] somebody but you can just the way that
[1:27:08] you talk about them and you kill their
[1:27:11] influence
[1:27:12] that that's you might as well just to
[1:27:14] murder them just by killing their
[1:27:16] influence you should have just went
[1:27:17] ahead and murdered him
[1:27:19] and i'm gonna tell you something when
[1:27:20] when oh i'mma just say it when parents
[1:27:22] kill the influence of the preacher
[1:27:25] the preacher can't help their family
[1:27:28] can't help their kids you have destroyed
[1:27:31] the influence of the preacher in your
[1:27:33] family's life and now that preacher
[1:27:35] cannot help your kids
[1:27:37] and it's because of what you said
[1:27:40] oh you know i i can go back in the
[1:27:41] scripture now you know brother brother
[1:27:43] brother brother branham told us that you
[1:27:45] know that when them she bears came and
[1:27:46] destroyed all them kids
[1:27:48] it was because of what the parents were
[1:27:50] saying in the house
[1:27:52] what they were saying in the house it
[1:27:54] destroyed i mean it i mean they were
[1:27:56] disrespecting the man of god they were
[1:27:58] disrespecting the prophet and as they
[1:28:00] were disrespecting the prophet their
[1:28:02] kids got it
[1:28:03] and didn't know how to how to control it
[1:28:05] on the outside oh my
[1:28:07] see the parents talk about it on the
[1:28:09] inside but the kids don't know how to
[1:28:11] control what they heard on the inside
[1:28:13] how to stop it from coming out on the
[1:28:14] outside
[1:28:16] and here they come old bald head prophet
[1:28:19] go on up like your master did and they
[1:28:21] they just criticized he got upset
[1:28:25] now i won the holy ghost but he got
[1:28:27] upset and it caused she bears out and
[1:28:29] they destroyed i think 42 children
[1:28:32] but that came because of parent
[1:28:34] delinquency
[1:28:38] amen if even if you don't agree with the
[1:28:40] pastor just respect the office
[1:28:45] respect the office glory to god
[1:28:48] many all are blessed today because you
[1:28:50] respected the office
[1:28:51] you might not agree with everything but
[1:28:53] you respected the office and you're
[1:28:55] blessed
[1:29:01] all right let me keep going
[1:29:04] verse 44 says you have your father the
[1:29:06] devil and the lust of the father you
[1:29:07] will do
[1:29:08] he was a murderer from the beginning and
[1:29:10] a vote not in the truth because there is
[1:29:11] no truth in him
[1:29:13] when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of
[1:29:15] his own for he is a liar and the father
[1:29:17] of it
[1:29:19] and because i tell you the truth you
[1:29:22] believe me not
[1:29:23] which of you convinces me of sin
[1:29:26] and if i say the truth why do you not
[1:29:28] believe me he that is of god uh he that
[1:29:31] that is of god heareth god's words ye
[1:29:34] therefore hear them not because ye are
[1:29:36] not of god now they could uh take the
[1:29:39] lineage and show you where they were
[1:29:42] born and how they were born and how they
[1:29:43] were abraham's seed physically
[1:29:45] spiritually jesus told him you are of
[1:29:47] your father the devil
[1:29:49] this truth
[1:29:51] this truth
[1:29:52] generated an internal hurt
[1:29:55] it caused the religious leaders to
[1:29:57] encourage the people to call for the
[1:29:59] crucifixion of matthew 27 uh we also see
[1:30:02] in the scripture that uh even after
[1:30:05] jesus died
[1:30:06] uh stephen a man who was a a deacon in
[1:30:10] the church there uh he ran into the same
[1:30:13] religious group
[1:30:15] glory to god
[1:30:17] hurt people
[1:30:18] hurt people this same religious group
[1:30:20] and he picks him up in acts 7 and and
[1:30:22] i'ma tell you hurt people will continue
[1:30:24] to hurt people these hurt people amen
[1:30:27] these religious leaders that that took
[1:30:29] jesus to a cross and he did nothing
[1:30:31] wrong
[1:30:32] nothing wrong they took jesus across the
[1:30:34] same her
[1:30:36] her group would take stephen and stone
[1:30:38] him
[1:30:39] hurt people continue to
[1:30:41] hurt people
[1:30:43] look at it in acts 7 51.
[1:30:46] it says you stiff-necked
[1:30:49] and uncircumcised and hardened ears this
[1:30:51] is a deacon preaching to him now
[1:30:53] he says you do always resist the holy
[1:30:56] ghost as your fathers did so do ye now
[1:30:58] can i can i just inject a little
[1:31:00] something here this is a deacon
[1:31:03] preaching
[1:31:04] and notice what the deacon the deacon is
[1:31:06] coming straight at him
[1:31:08] oh i'm saying something because
[1:31:11] sometimes when a deacon speaks he say
[1:31:13] something that might generate
[1:31:15] hurt
[1:31:16] not intentionally amen he's not picking
[1:31:19] on you he's picking off of you
[1:31:21] amen but god gives him an anointing to
[1:31:24] be able to say certain things
[1:31:26] and let me tell you they need to be seen
[1:31:30] you stiff neck
[1:31:32] and uncircumcising hardened ears you do
[1:31:35] always resist the holy ghost as your
[1:31:37] fathers did so do ye
[1:31:39] it says which of the prophets have not
[1:31:41] your fathers persecuted and they have
[1:31:44] slain them which look which show before
[1:31:46] the coming of the just one of whom ye
[1:31:49] have been now the betrayers and murders
[1:31:51] he's telling y'all jesus said you of
[1:31:53] your father the devil
[1:31:55] as he murdered the beginning you
[1:31:56] murdered me i ain't did nothing wrong
[1:31:58] now here's stephen picking up the same
[1:32:00] sermon and so y'all murdered him
[1:32:02] hallelujah then let him off the hook
[1:32:05] y'all murdered the king of kings he says
[1:32:08] we have received the law by disposition
[1:32:10] of angels and have not kept it
[1:32:14] when they heard these things they heard
[1:32:16] again
[1:32:17] they were cut to the heart and they
[1:32:19] gnashed on him with their teeth
[1:32:22] my god you can imagine what they were
[1:32:24] thinking they gnashed on him with their
[1:32:27] teeth but he being full of the holy
[1:32:29] ghost looked up step fast into heaven
[1:32:32] and saw the glory of god and jesus stand
[1:32:34] on the right hand of god and said behold
[1:32:37] i see the heavens open and the son of
[1:32:39] man standing on the right hand of god
[1:32:41] then they cried out with a loud voice
[1:32:43] and stopped their ears and ran upon him
[1:32:45] with one accord
[1:32:48] and cast him out of the city and stoned
[1:32:50] him
[1:32:51] and witnessed witnesses laid down their
[1:32:52] clothes at a young man's feet whose name
[1:32:55] was saul here we see
[1:32:57] hurt people
[1:32:59] continuing
[1:33:00] to hurt people
[1:33:02] they never go through a process of
[1:33:04] healing
[1:33:05] and this is what i want to tell you uh
[1:33:08] we all like i said we've all been hurt
[1:33:10] at some point in time and we're going to
[1:33:11] be hurt in the future if you haven't
[1:33:12] been you're going to be hurt at some
[1:33:13] point in time it's how you handle the
[1:33:16] hurt
[1:33:17] it's how you process the hurt
[1:33:20] but sometimes the hurt is for your good
[1:33:23] actually i'm gonna say it like this all
[1:33:24] the time
[1:33:26] the hurt is for your good
[1:33:28] how can you say that brother jack
[1:33:30] because the bible said
[1:33:32] all things
[1:33:34] work together for good to them that love
[1:33:36] god to them who are called according to
[1:33:38] his purpose
[1:33:39] let's pick up a quote here out of the
[1:33:41] mighty conqueror
[1:33:42] here brother brother branham's talking
[1:33:44] about the lord jesus amen he was hurt
[1:33:47] the very people that he came for
[1:33:48] rejected him
[1:33:50] and and this hurt actually is what what
[1:33:52] caused him to die on the cross he died
[1:33:54] from a broken heart it wasn't from the
[1:33:56] nails in his hands and things like that
[1:33:58] in his feet it was from a broken heart
[1:34:00] hurt people go through things in the on
[1:34:02] the inside on the inside
[1:34:05] it manifests itself sometimes in our in
[1:34:07] our in our
[1:34:08] physical being but it's something that's
[1:34:10] happening in the heart at the heart
[1:34:12] level we got to have god come in and
[1:34:14] bring healing
[1:34:15] to the heart
[1:34:17] and i'm gonna tell you because if god
[1:34:18] bring healing to the heart it'll
[1:34:19] manifest
[1:34:21] in every other area of your life
[1:34:24] look at this this this this statement
[1:34:26] out of the mighty conqueror
[1:34:27] he says uh
[1:34:28] and his own dear mother walking
[1:34:31] in his bloody footprints god let me walk
[1:34:33] the same way
[1:34:34] and as he went yonder to calvary
[1:34:37] down in her heart
[1:34:38] was a wandering
[1:34:40] and when she seen her darling child die
[1:34:42] young the man 33 years old and looked
[1:34:44] like 50 the bible said of his strained
[1:34:47] weight probably turning grave
[1:34:49] and the grim look on his face to where
[1:34:51] he was suffering not so much physically
[1:34:54] the grim look on his face where he was
[1:34:55] suffering not so much physically but as
[1:34:58] it was agony and what agony means is
[1:35:01] extreme physical or mental suffering
[1:35:03] that's what hurt is
[1:35:05] it's mental suffering right it says the
[1:35:07] bible said that his blood and water
[1:35:10] separated from each other and any doctor
[1:35:12] anything can tell you that knows the
[1:35:14] chemistry of blood that only sorrow will
[1:35:17] do that
[1:35:18] only sorrow will do that he never died
[1:35:21] from a roman spear neither did he die
[1:35:24] from a nail drove in his hand or his
[1:35:26] feet but he died
[1:35:28] of a broken heart
[1:35:31] being rejected
[1:35:33] amen he came to his own in his own
[1:35:36] received him not said brother branham i
[1:35:38] wish i could stood there that day at
[1:35:41] calvary brother you're standing in a
[1:35:43] better place today you're standing in
[1:35:45] the presence of a resurrected lord jesus
[1:35:47] who has proved himself triumph so here
[1:35:50] we see it was hurt that actually caused
[1:35:53] him a man to die at calvary's cross this
[1:35:57] internal pain that he that he went
[1:35:59] through even though he was hurt by the
[1:36:00] people that rejected him i want you to
[1:36:02] understand why he was there on the cross
[1:36:04] he did something that all of us need to
[1:36:06] do i told you we got to draw the circle
[1:36:09] bigger amen when they draw you out you
[1:36:11] got to draw them back in glory to god
[1:36:14] and what jesus did they drew him out but
[1:36:17] the way he drew them back in he prayed a
[1:36:19] prayer even on the cross
[1:36:21] father
[1:36:22] forgive them
[1:36:24] for they know not what they do
[1:36:26] can you say that to the people that
[1:36:28] might have hurt you
[1:36:30] father
[1:36:31] forgive them for they know not what they
[1:36:34] do
[1:36:41] hallelujah
[1:36:43] hallelujah
[1:36:45] this
[1:36:47] is found
[1:36:49] a man this this this whole um
[1:36:54] example
[1:36:56] is found in the life of joseph
[1:36:59] what we see in the life of christ yes he
[1:37:01] was hurt as well
[1:37:03] everybody gonna get hurt by something in
[1:37:06] life
[1:37:08] you can get hurt by family members
[1:37:10] you can get hurt by co-workers you can
[1:37:12] get hurt by church members you're gonna
[1:37:14] get hurt by something but what you gotta
[1:37:16] learn to do is commit things to the lord
[1:37:18] in prayer husbands can be hurt by wives
[1:37:22] wives can be hurt by husbands children
[1:37:24] can be hurt by parents parents can be
[1:37:26] hurt by children
[1:37:28] i mean it's just heard everywhere the
[1:37:30] congregation can be heard by the pastor
[1:37:32] the pastor can be hurt by the
[1:37:33] congregation
[1:37:35] it's hurt everywhere
[1:37:38] but we don't want to just have a cycle
[1:37:39] of hurt people hurting people
[1:37:43] somewhere that cycle got to be broken
[1:37:46] and i pray that through the word that we
[1:37:47] can break the cycle we recognize it but
[1:37:51] god how do we break out of this
[1:37:54] how do we break out of this lord what
[1:37:56] can you and not only what can you do but
[1:37:58] i know you can do something on the
[1:38:00] inside of me where you can take the hurt
[1:38:03] away
[1:38:04] i want to be like jesus i want to pray
[1:38:06] like jesus father forgive them
[1:38:09] for they know not what they do
[1:38:12] joseph life was a perfect type of christ
[1:38:17] he also is in agony for for many things
[1:38:20] that he suffered we're picking him up in
[1:38:22] genesis amen again now
[1:38:25] he was hurt by the fact that his own
[1:38:27] brothers rejected him just as christ was
[1:38:29] hurt that he the bible says he came to
[1:38:31] his own and his own receiver not he was
[1:38:33] hurt through that by that rejection
[1:38:36] oh my
[1:38:37] oh glory
[1:38:38] says
[1:38:39] uh and joseph life
[1:38:41] you know
[1:38:43] i want to just see if we can let's see
[1:38:44] here
[1:38:46] yeah
[1:38:46] yeah
[1:38:48] uh and joseph life
[1:38:50] so many things that happened in his life
[1:38:52] was a was an exact uh replica what
[1:38:55] happened in the life of the lord jesus
[1:38:57] uh when they threw joseph in a pit
[1:39:00] and supposed that he was dead
[1:39:03] but joseph was raised up out of the same
[1:39:06] pit that they threw him in glory it was
[1:39:09] a type of lord the lord jesus going into
[1:39:12] a grave
[1:39:13] but he was raised out of the same grave
[1:39:15] that they threw him in and i'm here this
[1:39:18] morning to tell you it's time for you to
[1:39:19] come out your pits
[1:39:22] it's time for you to be resurrected from
[1:39:24] the hurt
[1:39:25] it's time for you to be resurrected from
[1:39:27] the pain
[1:39:28] it's time for you to release those
[1:39:30] things that amen have had you bound god
[1:39:32] wants to bring you out of the
[1:39:35] the pit of despair the pit of feeling
[1:39:38] like you are a victim
[1:39:40] no you are a victor
[1:39:45] hallelujah amen uh the other thing is
[1:39:48] they sold joseph into slavery
[1:39:51] amen they they lied about his death
[1:39:54] glory to god when they went back to
[1:39:56] their father they lied about joseph
[1:39:58] death and they they said you know we
[1:39:59] found uh this uh this this coat of many
[1:40:02] colors and it's been and maybe a wild
[1:40:04] animal might have got them and we don't
[1:40:06] know what happened daddy but we found
[1:40:07] this and knowing that they had sold him
[1:40:10] into slavery but they lied about his
[1:40:12] amen about his death i found the same
[1:40:14] thing in scripture that when jesus rose
[1:40:17] again amen the soldiers were told a lie
[1:40:20] about the resurrection
[1:40:22] hallelujah hallelujah his life was the
[1:40:25] perfect type of the lord jesus
[1:40:27] he spent years
[1:40:29] a man uh and
[1:40:31] as a slave and and he was bought and and
[1:40:33] took down to potiphar's house and and
[1:40:36] they had to serve under potiphar's roof
[1:40:39] and and there and part of his house
[1:40:41] would lie again
[1:40:42] hallelujah by part of his wife
[1:40:45] i want to like i started with the quote
[1:40:47] where this lady had a lying black sheep
[1:40:50] that's a a black sheep followers a lying
[1:40:52] spirit following her amen joseph had lie
[1:40:56] after life following him you might have
[1:40:58] lie after lie following you but you
[1:41:01] don't have to accept the lie
[1:41:04] and maybe the lie amen as it as it did
[1:41:07] in joseph like it have created some
[1:41:09] really difficult times for you
[1:41:12] maybe the lie have made it very
[1:41:14] stressful in your life
[1:41:16] maybe the lie has caused you to make
[1:41:18] decisions that you never thought you
[1:41:20] would have made maybe the law has been
[1:41:22] doing that to you but you don't have to
[1:41:23] accept a lie anymore
[1:41:26] accept god's truth to what he says about
[1:41:30] you here joseph is in prison because of
[1:41:34] a lie
[1:41:35] here joseph is in prison because his
[1:41:37] brothers sold him into slavery here
[1:41:40] joseph is in prison because his brothers
[1:41:42] hated him without a cause here joseph is
[1:41:45] is going through all these things you
[1:41:46] talk about a man that has been hurt
[1:41:53] we see a man that's been hurt
[1:41:55] but here we see while he's in prison god
[1:41:58] allows a man a particular thing to
[1:42:01] happen here
[1:42:02] uh he sends
[1:42:05] the butler and the baker into this
[1:42:07] prison
[1:42:08] and when he gets there the butler and
[1:42:09] baker has a dream
[1:42:11] and joseph amen interprets uh the dream
[1:42:15] glory to god of both men and when he
[1:42:17] interprets one one is going to be raised
[1:42:20] back to life and the other is going to
[1:42:21] go on to death
[1:42:23] mine was a perfect type of the lord
[1:42:25] jesus because when he hung on the cross
[1:42:27] there were two male factors
[1:42:29] amen and one was going to meet him in
[1:42:31] paradise and the other was going to go
[1:42:33] on to his eternal rewards
[1:42:36] hallelujah glory to god a perfect type
[1:42:38] of the lord jesus and i want i want to i
[1:42:41] want to ask you a question
[1:42:43] and i want to pick up something here in
[1:42:45] in genesis 45
[1:42:46] we're going to go here to genesis 45 and
[1:42:48] start in verse 1 in a second
[1:42:51] but i want to just ask you a question
[1:42:53] about joseph
[1:42:56] class
[1:42:58] did joseph attend
[1:43:00] to learn how to process hurt
[1:43:05] what internet site
[1:43:08] did he go to amen to get some
[1:43:10] information on how to go through things
[1:43:13] like this
[1:43:16] i want to ask another which pastor
[1:43:18] did he sit down with to get counseling
[1:43:24] see he didn't have none of those joseph
[1:43:26] had the word of god to carry through and
[1:43:28] and and i'm gonna tell you what what the
[1:43:29] other thing i feel joseph at is he had
[1:43:31] the dream that god gave him
[1:43:34] amen all he had was a dream that he and
[1:43:36] i
[1:43:38] i can just uh just imagine that when the
[1:43:40] butler and the baker came with their
[1:43:42] dreams it might have reminded joseph of
[1:43:44] his dream
[1:43:45] and that's why he might have told him
[1:43:46] brother says down now now look when
[1:43:48] y'all leave hey when he told the butler
[1:43:50] when you leave don't forget about me now
[1:43:52] he knew that god was going to bring him
[1:43:54] out somehow someway
[1:43:56] but that wasn't the season for it
[1:43:59] had to wait two more years
[1:44:02] i want to tell you amen right now you
[1:44:04] might be
[1:44:05] you might be pressing god for a man
[1:44:07] particular thing to happen right now
[1:44:09] could i tell you this might not be the
[1:44:11] season
[1:44:14] god always has an answer it's going to
[1:44:15] be either yes
[1:44:17] no
[1:44:19] or just not yet
[1:44:28] genesis 45 verse 13 joseph has gone
[1:44:31] through all these things and
[1:44:33] what i'm i'm just
[1:44:35] here to
[1:44:36] just just kind of get you to see
[1:44:39] yes we all been hurt and we have reasons
[1:44:41] for you know maybe feeling the way that
[1:44:43] we feel but
[1:44:44] at some point in time we got to be able
[1:44:46] to identify with some of the characters
[1:44:47] of scripture
[1:44:49] and we can see how yeah they've been
[1:44:50] hurt too but look at how they came
[1:44:51] through i want you to watch the words of
[1:44:53] joseph
[1:44:56] now we we see him after he's been raised
[1:44:58] out of prison we're picking him up in
[1:45:00] scripture he's been he's come out of
[1:45:01] prison he's standing in pharaoh's court
[1:45:03] he's revealed pharaoh's dreams and and
[1:45:04] now he's been elevated to a place of
[1:45:07] second and command in the kingdom but he
[1:45:09] had to go through all these things god
[1:45:10] was using all that for joseph's
[1:45:12] betterment
[1:45:14] god's using everything you've gone
[1:45:15] through for your betterment
[1:45:18] look at this in genesis 45 then joseph
[1:45:22] could not refrain himself
[1:45:25] before all them
[1:45:27] that stood by
[1:45:28] him and he cried
[1:45:31] caused every man to go out from me
[1:45:34] and there stood no man with him while
[1:45:36] joseph made himself known unto his
[1:45:38] brother
[1:45:40] verse 2 says and he wept aloud
[1:45:43] and the egyptians in the house of
[1:45:45] pharaoh hurt
[1:45:46] and joseph said unto his brethren
[1:45:49] i am joseph dove my father yet live
[1:45:52] and his brethren could not answer him
[1:45:55] for they were troubled at his presence
[1:45:59] look at this
[1:46:00] and joseph said unto his brethren
[1:46:03] come near to me i'm drawing the circle
[1:46:06] bigger
[1:46:08] come near to me
[1:46:10] amen and i pray you
[1:46:12] i pray you and they came near and he
[1:46:15] said i am joseph your brother whom he
[1:46:18] sold into egypt they couldn't imagine
[1:46:21] they they you know they totally lie so
[1:46:24] long
[1:46:25] that our brother is dead they believe
[1:46:27] their own lie
[1:46:29] but now joseph is standing who said no
[1:46:31] i'm joseph your brother come near to me
[1:46:36] oh glory to god look at this
[1:46:38] amen uh now therefore be not greed
[1:46:43] nor angry with yourselves
[1:46:46] that ye sold me hither for god did send
[1:46:49] me before you to preserve life oh i just
[1:46:52] love the way joseph is approaching this
[1:46:54] i know you hurt me i know you caused
[1:46:57] pain in my life but i don't want you to
[1:46:59] be grieved by it
[1:47:01] god allowed these things to happen for a
[1:47:04] reason
[1:47:06] not only am i here to save myself but
[1:47:09] i'm here to save you as well god wants
[1:47:12] to use human beings to redeem other
[1:47:15] human beings
[1:47:19] there's a cause for redemption a price
[1:47:22] has to be paid for redemption
[1:47:26] look at this
[1:47:27] amen verse six for these two years have
[1:47:29] the famine been in the land and yet
[1:47:32] there are five years in the which there
[1:47:33] should neither be earring nor harvest
[1:47:37] and god
[1:47:38] sent me before you
[1:47:41] to preserve a pot
[1:47:43] preserve you a posterity in the earth
[1:47:46] and to save your lives by a great
[1:47:48] deliverance
[1:47:51] i i want y'all to get this look at this
[1:47:53] next verse
[1:47:54] look at this look at what joseph says
[1:47:59] so
[1:48:00] it was not you
[1:48:03] that sent me there
[1:48:08] oh it wasn't you that sold me into
[1:48:09] slavery
[1:48:11] it wanted you to cause me to go through
[1:48:13] all this
[1:48:14] it wasn't you it ain't got nothing to do
[1:48:17] with you
[1:48:20] oh i can go back in my life
[1:48:22] i can go back in my life when when i
[1:48:25] lost my job the second time i so had a
[1:48:28] problem with the guys that were set
[1:48:30] across the table from me but i had to
[1:48:32] realize it was not them
[1:48:35] god just god had to give you a certain
[1:48:37] disposition
[1:48:39] to make you do what you needed to do in
[1:48:42] order to put me where he wanted me to be
[1:48:44] had he not made you the way that you
[1:48:46] were i would not be standing here today
[1:48:49] so here i can say thank god
[1:48:52] for the man he made you to be
[1:48:54] thank god that you had the amen that the
[1:48:57] unction and the courage to make the
[1:48:59] decisions that you made
[1:49:03] it was not you
[1:49:04] [Music]
[1:49:06] it was not true i'm here to tell you it
[1:49:08] was not your brother it was not your
[1:49:10] sister it's not them
[1:49:14] your hurt was not them
[1:49:16] [Music]
[1:49:20] it was not you
[1:49:23] that sent me hither
[1:49:26] but god
[1:49:32] and he hath made me a father
[1:49:35] to pharaoh
[1:49:37] and lord of all his house
[1:49:39] and a ruler throughout all the land of
[1:49:41] egypt
[1:49:44] it's not you
[1:49:46] brothers y'all ain't got nothing to be
[1:49:47] worried about
[1:49:49] and they couldn't believe it
[1:49:51] they couldn't believe this but you know
[1:49:53] you know a man that had been sold by his
[1:49:55] brothers he had a reason to be upset
[1:49:59] he had reason to to get revenge and he
[1:50:02] was in a place
[1:50:04] he was in position
[1:50:06] in order to be able to take revenge and
[1:50:09] nobody would stop him
[1:50:12] but something that changed on the inside
[1:50:19] man he sent him back home said go get
[1:50:20] daddy

[1:51:33] dad is gone
[1:51:35] and they thinking joseph doing all this
[1:51:36] because daddy was alive

[1:52:05] oh no when god dumped something on the
[1:52:07] inside
[1:52:09] and when god doesn't release me from all
[1:52:11] that hurt and all that pain and all that
[1:52:13] stuff i ain't going back to it

[1:52:18] to be free
[1:52:22] when joseph's brethren saw that their
[1:52:24] father their father was dead
[1:52:26] they said joseph with her adventure hate
[1:52:28] us and will certainly require us all the
[1:52:30] evil which he which we did unto him and
[1:52:33] they sent a messenger to joseph saying

[2:07:33] to deal with us right where we are
[2:07:37] follow the truth that has been spoken to
[2:07:39] us lord bring
[2:07:40] a man healing
[2:07:42] to our hurt
[2:07:44] lord let the truth that has been spoken
[2:07:46] to us bring a release and a freedom help
[2:07:48] us to realize that
[2:07:49] uh every step that we have taken in life
[2:07:52] has been ordered of you we're not here
[2:07:54] by accident
[2:07:56] god you are involved in everything you
[2:07:58] don't allow things to happen just
[2:08:00] uh by happenstance at halfhazardly
[2:08:03] god you always have a plan
[2:08:06] you always have a purpose
[2:08:09] lord let us rest ourselves
[2:08:12] on the word of god and in the word of
[2:08:14] god
[2:08:15] may we find our soulless
[2:08:17] when we find our comfort may we find our
[2:08:19] strength
[2:08:20] may we find our peace may we find it all
[2:08:23] may we find all that we need right there
[2:08:25] in the word of god
[2:08:28] and father may we
[2:08:29] lord rather than turning and running
[2:08:31] from situations may we turn to you
[2:08:33] [Music]
[2:08:35] knowing father you god
[2:08:37] are able to see us through sometimes we
[2:08:39] have to patiently wait
[2:08:42] not get in a hurry and get ahead of you
[2:08:43] but patiently wait father
[2:08:46] for you god to
[2:08:48] to do the things that only you can do
[2:08:50] god so we just pray father that you
[2:08:51] would help us
[2:08:53] lord let your word amen have preeminence
[2:08:56] in our circumstances and in our
[2:08:58] situations and lord may we be like like
[2:09:01] joseph
[2:09:02] god he could go through and process the
[2:09:04] situation he can realize that no it
[2:09:06] wasn't my brothers that did this it
[2:09:08] wasn't my brothers that that that that
[2:09:10] that that uh caused me to have to go
[2:09:12] through these things but it was god's
[2:09:15] positioning and placing me in a spot
[2:09:19] where i could be a help to them
[2:09:23] god he realized amen what are you going
[2:09:25] through and he stopped a man uh
[2:09:27] complaining
[2:09:28] and maybe
[2:09:29] just lord just blaming everybody as he
[2:09:32] stopped being a victim
[2:09:34] he became a victor
[2:09:37] jesus
[2:09:39] this is where we want to move to today
[2:09:40] god and we can't do it without you
[2:09:42] so bring us to that place where we're no
[2:09:44] longer seeing ourselves as victims
[2:09:48] lord but we're victors we're more than
[2:09:50] conquerors through him that loved us
[2:09:53] father we love you
[2:09:55] god we praise you
[2:09:57] we thank you
[2:10:00] oh it's in jesus name

[2:10:31] just offer a man and just to be able to
[2:10:34] pray for
[2:10:35] anyone that may have felt that
[2:10:37] the lord was speaking to you through not
[2:10:40] just discernment but this series of
[2:10:41] sermons
[2:10:43] maybe today
[2:10:46] come to the conclusion that you really
[2:10:48] want to release
[2:10:50] all the hurt
[2:10:52] you want to release the pain you want to
[2:10:54] release
[2:10:55] these things that may have hindered you
[2:10:57] and entered your walk with christ maybe
[2:10:59] handed your relationship with a brother
[2:11:01] a sister
[2:11:04] sometimes it hinders in families and
