[0:00] so that's that's why the scripture
[0:01] actually say you have a name that you
[0:02] live but you're dead they organized just
[0:05] like the other churches and as soon as
[0:07] the church organizers they leave God out
[0:09] they leave God out and and man takes
[0:13] complete control but God's nowhere in
[0:15] the picture and brother Branham toes
[0:17] once organization sets in that's been
[0:19] deaths that's in I've seen that not only
[0:22] and denominational churches but even in
[0:24] the message where people try to organize
[0:26] things you might have maybe only certain
[0:31] preachers preach all the time that's the
[0:33] denomination right that's the spirit of
[0:35] denomination when people begin to do
[0:36] things like that and you know you just
[0:39] got to be ever so careful when you see
[0:41] that you know when you see that spirit
[0:42] rising up but what we've watched that
[0:45] over the years on a certain preachers
[0:46] you want Santa wait other people say you
[0:48] need to say it you weren't going to be
[0:50] involved and that was a denominational
[0:52] spirit and when when the leader passes
[0:55] away the denomination falls apart right
[0:58] and that's what you've seen in the
[1:00] message over the past few years so god
[1:02] help us to avoid that a man's avoid that
[1:06] completely okay just bring him back out
[1:11] to you this is what we call the
[1:16] labyrinth that that was generated from
[1:18] this age so like I said there's some
[1:20] good things that happen they broke free
[1:21] from Catholic teachings but when they
[1:24] broke free they started all of this and
[1:26] pretty much everything you see here is
[1:27] just German American churches which is
[1:31] more Lutheran type churches this that's
[1:33] that's not representing 45,000 that
[1:35] other denominations that are out there
[1:37] but you can see Church Christendom
[1:40] became a labyrinth became a big maze
[1:43] people trying to sort through to figure
[1:45] out what's right you know what's wrong
[1:47] who got the right teachers and who got
[1:49] the you know just people just confused
[1:52] as to which way to go but the only thing
[1:55] we can say that's right is the Bible
[1:56] that's what's right and that's where
[1:58] we're trying to get people back to his
[1:59] back to the Bible and that's what
[2:01] brother Brandon mission was to do turn
[2:03] our hearts back to the Bible back to the
[2:05] Bible so this labyrinth we thank God
[2:07] that he has brought us through
[2:10] like the at the top of that slide says
[2:12] there's there's only one life but death
[2:14] comes to us and a thousand forms there's
[2:18] only one Christ but a thousand
[2:20] Antichrist so we want to follow the one
[2:24] Christ a man that's what we want to
[2:26] follow and we'll find him and his word
[2:28] okay we hit this last week and we'll
[2:33] just touch this real again real quick
[2:35] again we're revelation 35 which will
[2:39] spend a little bit more time in tonight
[2:40] says he that overcometh the same shall
[2:43] be clothed in white raiment and I would
[2:46] not blot out his name out of the book of
[2:47] life but I will confess his name before
[2:50] my father and his oly angels now again I
[2:54] want to underline the section which says
[2:56] the same shall be clothed in white
[2:58] raiment and what brother branham said
[2:59] there was a statement that came forth
[3:01] from that scripture and that section of
[3:04] the scripture says the same should be
[3:05] clothed in white raiment he says the
[3:07] statement was keeping skirts clean that
[3:10] was a statement that was made just
[3:12] people used that over the years keep
[3:14] your skirts clean and what that meant
[3:16] was too it meant don't get involved in
[3:21] questionable things don't don't get
[3:24] involved and questionable things I
[3:27] remember a statement that the Prophet
[3:29] said if you if you if you got a decision
[3:31] that you got to make interview if you
[3:34] got questions about that decision don't
[3:37] do it you don't do it if you got any
[3:39] little question about if you're not
[3:41] clearing your heart about whether do
[3:43] that and not do that the best thing to
[3:45] do is don't do it right but but anything
[3:48] that's questionable don't don't get
[3:50] involved and I love the way you put this
[3:52] others will be involved and you might be
[3:56] tempted to be involved because others
[3:59] are doing it and I mentioned this last
[4:01] week I want to say it again do not
[4:03] measure your Christianity by what
[4:05] somebody else is doing measure your
[4:07] Christianity by what the Word of God
[4:09] tells you to do and not not not Lord
[4:12] they doing it now God and accept it not
[4:15] an act right it's going to be based on
[4:17] his word so you know if other people get
[4:20] involved let them do it right but but I
[4:22] mean
[4:23] me I got my own convictions and i'ma
[4:26] stay with what God reveals to me right
[4:28] but but don't get involved in
[4:30] questionable things others will be
[4:32] involved you might be tempted to be
[4:35] involved or someone might even try to
[4:37] involve you but stay clear at all by
[4:40] steering a course away from it and I
[4:44] tell you what that quote could probably
[4:45] circle a lot of things in our Christian
[4:49] experience as what stuff we shouldn't be
[4:51] involved with what stuff we should be
[4:53] involved with but just remember keep
[4:55] your skirt clean you know you as an
[4:57] individual keep your skirt clean nobody
[5:00] like to walk around with stains on their
[5:02] clothes nobody amen so keep your your
[5:06] skirt clean that's that's the key thing
[5:07] you want to get from that scripture
[5:09] where it says the same shall be clothed
[5:11] in white raiment all right on a little
[5:15] further here we want to we talked about
[5:24] this last week but I want to go a little
[5:25] little deeper in this where it says also
[5:29] in Revelation 35 it says I will not blot
[5:32] out his name out of the book of life
[5:34] that's found in this section so brother
[5:38] Brandon begins to talk a little bit more
[5:39] about the book of life Lamb's Book of
[5:42] Life beginni clarify for us last week
[5:44] that is the same but the other thing I
[5:47] want to bring into here is when we're
[5:49] talking about this it says the
[5:51] possibility of the removal of a name for
[5:54] the records the record of God deserves
[6:00] more than a casual study for up until
[6:04] now most students have merely drawn a
[6:06] conclusion that got places the names of
[6:09] those born again within the Lamb's Book
[6:12] of Life at the time of the rebirth there
[6:16] was a song we used to sing when we were
[6:19] in church man that we used to turn up
[6:22] just about every Sunday we were Baptist
[6:24] Church sign me up for the Christian
[6:26] Jubilee write my name on the roll I
[6:32] haven't changed this the Lord lifted me
[6:36] yeah something like that and I want to
[6:38] be ready when Jesus comes but my wee boy
[6:40] every time the offering bachelor come
[6:42] around they'd assign me up you know is
[6:45] what we had the church rocking but when
[6:47] you think about it but that song was
[6:49] completely wrong when you get saved is
[6:51] not when your name is being signed an
[6:53] opponent will let me let me tell you my
[6:58] god even for you to just be introduced
[7:03] to this message your name had to be
[7:08] there now now there are some people
[7:12] that's been introduced to this message
[7:14] but have rejected it and their names
[7:17] will be erased we're going to get into
[7:20] that tonight right Judas was Judas was
[7:27] in the message for his day when he was
[7:30] standing right there with Jesus Christ
[7:32] working signs wonders and miracles but
[7:35] Judas got to a point in his life where
[7:38] he rejected that word and his name was
[7:40] blotted out right so we brought that out
[7:43] last week and we're going to go a little
[7:45] deeper because brother Brandon brought
[7:46] some more things and you know it is this
[7:50] is a very serious subject to me it's
[7:54] because I look at the people that are
[7:57] rejecting the word today or trying to
[8:00] reject or they don't know what they plan
[8:01] whipped right you know if you add to the
[8:04] word of take away from the word that
[8:07] your name would be blotted out that's
[8:09] revelation 22 right if you add to this
[8:12] were to take away now if you take it and
[8:14] how you have we take away from the word
[8:15] when we deny that God sent a prophet we
[8:18] take away and we was walking in that
[8:20] fellowship and around it one day
[8:23] shouting around it and didn't get to
[8:25] Fort online don't oh god help us I'm
[8:30] going to tell you when it went when you
[8:31] when you get to to Revelation it causes
[8:33] a burden becoming your heart where you
[8:36] can't help but pray for people right
[8:39] when Abraham knew destruction was on the
[8:42] way to Sodom Gomorrah Abraham began to
[8:44] pray right that that was that was his
[8:47] response it was there was I mean
[8:49] he wasn't rejoicing and jumping and
[8:50] saying that man that man began to seek
[8:52] God / adventure / adventure and when you
[8:56] when you get a true revolution what you
[8:57] know what we're kind of going through
[8:58] here tonight it ought to be / aventure /
[9:01] adventure / adventure my God my God
[9:04] Church so you know this is a this is
[9:07] this is serious this is serious
[9:11] information that God has given us you
[9:14] know very serious it's almost best that
[9:16] you didn't know it then actually notice
[9:20] and don't do nothing with it it was
[9:22] better that you just never heard it one
[9:24] of the worst things you can do is and
[9:26] you know and I think all of us probably
[9:29] we're all in some way we've probably
[9:33] experienced this here you got this truth
[9:37] and you notice truth and you trying to
[9:41] live in the world but this truth just
[9:43] keep hitting yet it everywhere you go it
[9:49] just hit you right you can't even live
[9:52] comfortably you know it whether it
[9:55] whether it hit you and somebody said
[9:57] something and it hit you or just running
[9:59] into the Saints it hits you right this
[10:02] truth just got away of just ooh it dig
[10:05] and dig in deep it's almost better that
[10:08] you just didn't know because other
[10:10] people that ain't got no problem they
[10:11] like well why are you feeling waving
[10:12] because you don't know what I know
[10:14] alright god I'll tell you this is this
[10:17] is I think got that he called us to it
[10:21] that's that's all I can say listen the
[10:24] possibility of the removal of a name
[10:27] from the records of God deserves more
[10:29] than a casual study and that's we're
[10:30] going to take our time and go through
[10:33] this says for up until now most students
[10:36] have merely drawn a conclusion it got
[10:38] places the names of those born again
[10:40] within the Lamb's Book of Life at the
[10:42] time of their rebirth and if any reason
[10:46] that man must be removed the space on
[10:48] the record will simply be a blank as it
[10:51] was before name have been placed there
[10:53] this is one hundred percent opposite to
[10:57] what the word actually teaches so if
[10:59] your name is on the Lamb's Book of Life
[11:02] it was placed here before the foundation
[11:03] of the world amen and we thank God for
[11:07] that that's the good part about it
[11:10] because if it's there can't be lost no
[11:14] matter what you go through in life you
[11:17] cannot be lost what a beautiful
[11:21] revelation right to know that you belong
[11:24] to him and there's nothing against you
[11:26] if his blood wipes it clean my delicate
[11:30] hold nothing nothing on if our name was
[11:33] there it was there and it was dead
[11:34] before was even born e before any
[11:37] mistake the name was placed in thank God
[11:39] for that thank God for had all right
[11:42] here's some key statements of scriptures
[11:44] that came out of our reading this week
[11:46] and one of them descriptors deuteronomy
[11:50] 29 18 where it says left there should be
[11:53] among you man or woman or family or
[11:58] tribe whose heart turneth away this day
[12:01] from the Lord our God we're going to
[12:03] read more on that scripture but
[12:04] basically if you skip you know get down
[12:07] to a few verses after that it says that
[12:09] if there's tribes would turn away you
[12:12] know from following the Word of God then
[12:14] that tribe if they turn towards idolatry
[12:16] then that tribe what that entire tribe
[12:19] would be blotted out right they were
[12:22] blotted out from under heaven is what
[12:24] the scriptures say that we want to we
[12:26] want to take our time and help you know
[12:27] try to help people understand what that
[12:29] really means i will read will read
[12:31] through it a little bit but but that was
[12:34] a key statement deuteronomy 29 18 also
[12:38] he says the tribe that turned out dollar
[12:41] tree was to have his name blotted out
[12:43] that was a key statement he also said
[12:46] you can't go along with just part of the
[12:48] word you have to take all the word glory
[12:54] now that's a that's a good one you
[12:56] cannot just to go at part of the word
[12:59] just the part that make you happy and a
[13:02] part that make you shout you got to eat
[13:04] the whole roll a man you came just half
[13:07] part of it you got that you got to take
[13:08] all of it listen Jesus did not die a
[13:11] partial death he went he went through
[13:14] the whole thing
[13:15] and he had purpose for doing that all
[13:18] right listen to this this is another
[13:22] says that great God who is bringing
[13:24] Israel back to Palestine knows exactly
[13:26] which tribe every true Israelite us from
[13:28] and from all the assembled 144,000 Dan
[13:32] and Ephraim will be missing and we're
[13:34] going to get into wise Dan and ate from
[13:36] missing you know from 144,000 when they
[13:39] were part of the original tribes that
[13:42] were that were going out of Egypt and
[13:45] into the Promised Land why they miss him
[13:48] over the book of Revelation we'll get
[13:51] him to that here's the other thing
[13:54] revelation 22 22 19 which says if any
[14:00] man shall take away from the words of
[14:02] the book of this prophecy God shall take
[14:05] away his part out of the book of life
[14:07] and out of the holy city and from the
[14:10] things which are written in this book
[14:12] brother Branham tells us that when Judas
[14:15] left and betray the Lord his name was
[14:19] removed from the book of life and the
[14:21] other thing that he did it went in our
[14:23] reading he told us that there are
[14:24] multitudes of people doing the exact
[14:26] same thing today I want to just forewarn
[14:31] you most of the people that are
[14:38] defecting from the message most of it is
[14:44] over money and money money's been behind
[14:49] a lot of that and thus the sad part is
[14:51] that the people that don't know that
[14:56] they just kind of get swept up
[14:58] underneath the spirit but don't realize
[15:00] that there was there was money there was
[15:02] various there was Lenny that was
[15:04] controlling that's causing people to do
[15:06] what they did right had no idea that
[15:08] that and let me you know why Judas left
[15:12] Jesus money a Judas Judas wanted to get
[15:16] paid right and and and if Judas would do
[15:20] that if Judas would forsake the word in
[15:22] his day because of money many people do
[15:25] the same thing today but a lot a lot of
[15:28] folk just don't know
[15:29] the real details behind it and it just
[15:31] gets swept we're just going a website
[15:33] just read a lot of nonsense right and
[15:35] not even going through their own Bibles
[15:37] that really sort through this you know
[15:38] cuz I'm gonna tell you if you want to
[15:40] find something wrong you'll find it
[15:42] you're fine it's there to be found if
[15:45] you if you want to be anointed by the
[15:47] devil to find wrong you'll find it no
[15:49] matter whether you're looking for it in
[15:50] the message if you want to find in the
[15:52] Bible you'll find some things that come
[15:53] for dick in the Bible it's there if
[15:56] you're a Bible reader you know it's
[15:58] there all right but but the thing it
[16:01] don't for me it don't shake me right I'm
[16:04] not putting the Bible down I'm fine I
[16:06] find nothing nothing else like it you
[16:08] know and I'm not looking for anything
[16:10] else right so you know but if you're
[16:13] looking for wrong you'll find it if
[16:15] that's what your spirit is annoying it
[16:16] for you're going to find it and you'll
[16:18] be operating and not even knowing that
[16:20] the reason that it even started the
[16:23] reason that that thing even triggers
[16:24] because somebody it was all about money
[16:27] for them all about money somebody wasn't
[16:30] going to give them no more money if they
[16:31] didn't come out and say that they
[16:33] denounced the message my all right
[16:38] that's why you can't have relationships
[16:40] like that glory to God all right he also
[16:46] said this Judas fail and multitudes fell
[16:49] right there and when they fail to go on
[16:51] and that word their names are taken off
[16:53] the book of life that was a very very
[16:55] strong statement when people fail to go
[16:58] on in the word their names are taken off
[17:01] of the book of life write their names
[17:04] are taken off if you fail to go on and
[17:06] the word it got revealed this to you and
[17:09] then you just kind of reject it don't
[17:13] want it you know just kind of throw it
[17:15] right back in God's face oh that's like
[17:17] crucifying Jesus all over again I mean
[17:21] my you look at him on that crossing and
[17:24] all the pain everything he daughter Jess
[17:27] to you and like you know I'm doing this
[17:28] so that you don't you don't have to die
[17:30] for your sin but i don't care i'm a die
[17:32] for my scene anyway what how could we
[17:36] how could we respond that way to someone
[17:38] that would show us that type of love
[17:41] the first thing we ought to do like man
[17:43] if you would give all your heart for me
[17:45] I can't help but give all my heart for
[17:47] you that's what God wants all right last
[17:53] week we hit this and I'm going we're
[17:56] going to go a little further again this
[17:59] is not when we talk about this book of
[18:03] life your name was put there before the
[18:06] foundation of the world it's not being
[18:08] added right now for the brand instead in
[18:10] the church age but let it let it be
[18:12] known that there's not one scripture
[18:14] that teaches that God is presently
[18:18] compiling a record of names this was all
[18:20] done before the foundation of the world
[18:22] and when we look at the last book of
[18:24] life also called the book of life the
[18:28] first we're going to find like I said
[18:30] there's three groups but that would have
[18:35] been on the book of life and then
[18:36] there's one group that never even never
[18:39] their names was never even there so
[18:40] we're going to be going through over the
[18:41] next couple of weeks you know talking
[18:43] about the names that were on the record
[18:45] before the foundation world and no
[18:47] matter what oh caps our names were on
[18:51] that record before the foundation world
[18:53] and they will have their names remove so
[18:55] Judas would have been one of those
[18:56] people that had his name on the book but
[18:59] had her lube now we went through a
[19:00] scripture mount and we we we pointed out
[19:03] where Jesus over in Luke chapter 10 the
[19:07] total disciples don't rejoice because
[19:10] the Devils are subject unto you you say
[19:13] rejoice because your name is written in
[19:15] heaven right and when he said that Judas
[19:18] was standing right there as one of the
[19:21] disciples where he told him your name
[19:23] was written in heaven so Judas name was
[19:25] on that book of life but his name was
[19:28] removed when Satan entered into him and
[19:31] he did what he did when he sold out
[19:33] Jesus that's where his name was removed
[19:35] my the other other big thing I'll tell
[19:41] you that what Satan really annoys people
[19:43] with is the spirit of rebellion and
[19:46] rebellion is something that comes in so
[19:48] many forms people repel against their
[19:50] parents people rebelled against the pass
[19:53] two people rebelled against you know
[19:56] they rebelled against a deacon in the
[19:57] church there I mean and it's sometimes
[19:59] it's just any anybody and authority they
[20:02] rebelled against teachers administrators
[20:04] they were just rebelled against anybody
[20:06] right they were rebelling against the
[20:08] government you know it's Jeff it's just
[20:11] rebellion is all over the place and that
[20:14] is a spirit that's in my land the day
[20:15] the Bible say rebellion is that the same
[20:17] as the sin of witchcraft that's where we
[20:21] got to be careful don't let the devil
[20:23] anoint you with that don't let the devil
[20:26] anoint you with that fight rabay with
[20:28] everything you got just the Riddler to
[20:30] God surrendered a whole situation to God
[20:32] don't don't just don't cuz we're begging
[20:34] to take you further than you ever want
[20:35] to go alright so there's the names that
[20:38] were on the record before the foundation
[20:40] world and they will have their names
[20:41] removed Judas it's one of those we're
[20:43] going to talk about some others tonight
[20:45] another statement when we talk about the
[20:51] sections of the book of life there's
[20:52] names that cannot be removed under any
[20:55] circumstances and I am by faith
[20:59] declaring that everybody within the
[21:00] sound of my voice is in that section
[21:02] that name that cannot be removed under
[21:05] any circumstances no matter what I do my
[21:09] name can't be taken out now I'm going to
[21:12] tell you when you when you have a
[21:13] revelation of that you don't want to sin
[21:18] see it's not it's not what no matter
[21:20] what I do I ain't goin on oh you mean he
[21:23] loved me that much that he put my name
[21:26] man no matter what I did he I can't help
[21:29] but there was a brother branham told a
[21:32] story of them the husband that got
[21:35] married and he was a man of the world
[21:38] didn't know too much about the things of
[21:40] God and when they got married his wife
[21:42] had been a woman of a Christian for a
[21:45] number of years and she told them she
[21:47] said you know I've didn't walk in in
[21:49] this way for quite some time I've been
[21:50] I've been a Christian for a number of
[21:52] years and Sam know that you just getting
[21:54] to become a Christian you're just
[21:56] accepting Christ and you know you're
[21:58] going to go through some trials you go
[21:59] and go through some tribulations and you
[22:01] know things don't get a little difficult
[22:02] sometimes here and there just saying if
[22:04] you if you ever slip up you know and
[22:06] something go wrong you know when you
[22:08] your way from home something wrong she
[22:10] said whatever you do don't stay away
[22:11] from the house you come right on back
[22:13] home no matter what you do I want you to
[22:16] always come back home and that man
[22:18] looked at his wife he went to work and
[22:19] told his friend what his wife said he
[22:21] said now with a woman talking like that
[22:23] to me how can I do anything to hurt her
[22:27] right see I'm going to tell you there
[22:30] some people look for escape clauses they
[22:33] want to frustrate God's grace but
[22:35] there's others that actually appreciate
[22:37] his grace and like Lord of you can give
[22:39] me grace like that I can't help but
[22:41] serve you a man no matter what the
[22:46] circumstance there's a group of people
[22:47] their names will never be removed from
[22:51] that Lamb's Book of Life thank God for
[22:53] that brother branham also gonna bring to
[22:56] our attention look at this multitudes
[22:58] who were not even born again we'll go
[23:02] into you're going to eternal life not
[23:04] even be the bride not as a difficult one
[23:07] but we're gonna dig in there and we
[23:09] don't get it right multitudes going to
[23:12] receive eternal life and they were not
[23:14] even a bride now I didn't say they'll
[23:15] make the rapture but they're get eternal
[23:17] life right it didn't say that they live
[23:20] in the palace but they'll give eternal
[23:22] life right and actually the scripture
[23:25] exitos that God remembers people that
[23:27] just give you a cold glass of water God
[23:32] remembers them a man will get him taller
[23:37] that I tell you I look forward to this
[23:39] is this is good and also this this group
[23:41] is not in the book of life that's why I
[23:43] said I couldn't say four sections would
[23:45] be three sections but there's another
[23:46] group that we need to identify there's a
[23:48] group their names were never on the book
[23:52] of life never never there never and
[23:55] we'll we'll start talking about some of
[23:58] them as well as we go forward so try to
[24:01] keep that in mind the section that we
[24:03] are focusing on for tonight is the names
[24:07] that were on the record before the
[24:09] foundation world but their names were
[24:11] removed their names were removed all
[24:13] right
[24:19] we're starting with this tribal idolatry
[24:26] and it says that the names will be
[24:29] blotted out from under heaven brother
[24:33] Branham brought to our attention here
[24:35] Genesis 35 verse 23 through 26 he there
[24:40] is these are the twelve tribes as it was
[24:43] in Genesis as it was in Genesis we had
[24:47] Reuben we had Simeon we had leave on
[24:50] Judah Issachar Zebulon joseph benjamin
[24:53] dan Naphtali GAD and Asher now that's
[24:59] where it started out in Genesis if we
[25:01] moved over to numbers chapter 10 where
[25:07] the children of Israel you know kind of
[25:09] recording when they're coming out of
[25:10] Egypt brother branham makes this
[25:11] statement thus when Israel left Egypt
[25:13] and God gave them the tabernacle on the
[25:15] witness we wilderness in the wilderness
[25:18] we find the tribe of Levi ministering to
[25:22] the twelve twelve tribes named Reuben
[25:26] Simeon it's a car Judah zebulon Benjamin
[25:31] Dan Naphtali GAD Asher Ephraim and
[25:37] Manasseh now here that was that would be
[25:40] again found in the Book of Numbers Levi
[25:44] is ministering to this to this group now
[25:46] there was a statement that brother
[25:47] Branham made and I just want to kind of
[25:51] bring this for it don't worry about
[25:52] pulling this up on the screen will leave
[25:55] the screen as it is but in your church
[25:57] age book on page 269 brother Branham
[26:02] said he said these twelve sons
[26:07] descendants become the twelve tribes of
[26:09] Israel with the exception that Joseph
[26:11] did not have a tribe named after him but
[26:13] in the Providence of God there were to
[26:15] be 13 tribes and josephs two sons were
[26:18] given the honor bringing the twelve to
[26:21] thirteen you know of course that that
[26:24] this was necessary to leave I was
[26:25] separating to God for the priesthood so
[26:28] Levi
[26:29] to the other 12 and what we got there if
[26:33] there was a scripture that I wanted to
[26:35] just kind of bring in to you really
[26:37] quick yeah Genesis 48 and five Genesis
[26:43] 48 and five when this is when Joseph got
[26:49] reconnected with his family all know the
[26:51] story of him being sold into slavery and
[26:53] so on and so forth and down in Egypt but
[26:56] when he was when he finally met his
[27:00] father he brought his father down to
[27:01] Egypt and finally met his father his
[27:04] father action to bring his two sons and
[27:06] he's and he says Jacob actually tells
[27:09] him it says now that two sons Ephraim
[27:12] and Manasseh which were born unto thee
[27:14] in the land of Egypt before I came unto
[27:16] thee into Egypt our mind and Reuben and
[27:20] Simeon as Reuben and Simeon they shall
[27:23] be mine so here Jacob is actually
[27:26] adopted taking these two two sons of
[27:28] Joseph and making them his so that's why
[27:30] we see their names actually also going
[27:32] to be a part of the twelve tribes
[27:34] because Jacob took them as his own on
[27:37] boys okay so so when we read there if we
[27:41] were to go back and read their out of
[27:42] Numbers chapter tim brother branham
[27:45] already kind of you know summarizes it
[27:47] for said at the bottom of the screen
[27:48] since that's when Israel left Egypt and
[27:50] God gave them the Tabernacle in the
[27:53] wilderness we find the tribe of Levi was
[27:56] ministering to twelve tribes named
[27:59] Reuben Simeon it's a car Judah zebulon
[28:03] Benjamin Dan Naphtali GAD Asher Ephraim
[28:08] and Manasseh Ephraim and NASA happened
[28:11] to be Joseph sons okay so these were the
[28:14] twelve tribes as they were leaving Egypt
[28:17] going to the promised land now when we
[28:19] pick them up these twelve tribes over in
[28:22] the book of Revelation we got different
[28:25] names okay and when we get here to over
[28:29] the book of Revelation we got Judah we
[28:31] got Reuben we got gap we got a sure we
[28:35] got enough tally we got Manasseh we got
[28:38] Simeon we got Levi we got it's a car we
[28:41] got zebulon
[28:42] Joseph and Benjamin all right now I
[28:45] highlighted leave I'm and Joseph because
[28:48] when I when I share with you all over in
[28:50] numbers 10 Levi was serving the other
[28:53] tribes right and Joseph his name was not
[28:56] there because his two sons actually took
[28:58] his place ok but now over the book
[29:00] revelation receive Joseph's name has
[29:02] been added and Levi's name has also been
[29:05] added back in the book of Revelation now
[29:07] what happens in Revelation during the
[29:09] Tribulation Period just 144 thousand
[29:11] that God is going to deal with its
[29:12] 12,000 out of each one of these tribes
[29:14] that we have listed there from Judah
[29:17] Reuben GAD Asher Neftali Manasseh Simeon
[29:20] Levi instacart zebulon joseph benjamin
[29:22] well what happened is that we missed dan
[29:25] and we miss Aoife dan which you can see
[29:32] right here I'm sorry to give you that
[29:34] but dan is missing over here in this
[29:38] section dan is missing and then also
[29:40] this was now here Ephraim that was
[29:43] substituted and numbers ten Ephraim
[29:46] that's what Joseph sons Ephraim and Dan
[29:48] and no longer showing up over here in
[29:50] Revelation now this is important the
[29:53] reason that is important God made a
[29:55] promise of his word and we're going to
[29:57] read that scripture promise here in a
[30:00] second actual read it right now there's
[30:03] a reason why they're missing this is the
[30:05] reason the Bible says here in
[30:08] Deuteronomy chapter 29 verse 16 says for
[30:13] you for you know how we have dwelt in
[30:17] the land of Egypt and how we came
[30:19] through the nations which you passed by
[30:22] and he have seen their abominations and
[30:24] their idols wood and stone silver and
[30:28] gold which were among them let's there
[30:31] should be less there should be among you
[30:33] man or woman or family or tribe whose
[30:40] heart turneth away this day from the
[30:42] Lord our God to go and serve the gods of
[30:45] these nations let's there should be
[30:48] among you a route that birth gall and
[30:50] wormwood and it come to pass when he
[30:53] here at the words of
[30:55] this curse that he bless himself in his
[30:57] heart saying I shall have peace though I
[30:59] walk and the imagination of my heart to
[31:02] add drunkenness to thirst the Lord will
[31:05] not spare him but then the anger of the
[31:08] lord and his jealousy shall smoke
[31:10] against that man and all the curses that
[31:13] are written in this book shall I upon
[31:15] him and the Lord shall blot out his name
[31:18] from under heaven alright so if they
[31:22] turn into idolatry if a tribe went
[31:25] towards idolatry then God was going to
[31:27] block their name out from under heaven
[31:29] so what I'm trying to what I'm trying to
[31:30] show you that if I can go back yeah when
[31:36] God made this promise in Deuteronomy and
[31:39] we never show in the scripture out of
[31:41] first King's and also out of other book
[31:43] of Isaiah where Dan turned to idolatry
[31:46] and Ephraim also went to idolatry and
[31:50] because they went to idolatry god
[31:52] remember what he said way back and
[31:54] Deuteronomy and it showed up in the book
[31:56] of Revelation the promise that God said
[31:59] if thats right turn the idolatry then
[32:01] that would be blotted out from under
[32:03] heaven so what that meant is that when
[32:05] these trials are dealt with in the
[32:06] tribulation dan will not be a part of
[32:09] the 144,000 and Ephraim will not be a
[32:12] part of that because that would break
[32:14] God's Word here Deuteronomy 29 God left
[32:16] them out over here because we remember
[32:19] what they did when they and I'm going to
[32:21] read the scripture you remember what
[32:22] they did when they went after false gods
[32:24] they went into idolatry I'm gonna tell
[32:26] you something if God remember his
[32:27] promise on something negative he
[32:30] certainly remembers it on something
[32:31] positive all you got to do is hold to it
[32:35] God did not forget what he said let's go
[32:39] back let's go Andrea turn with bring
[32:40] your bibles first Kings chapter 12
[32:47] we're talking about names being blotted
[32:50] out Judas was one that was blotted out
[32:53] now we're picking up some other examples
[32:55] in scriptures in Scripture of others
[32:58] that have been blotted out the God said
[33:04] he would block the name out from under
[33:05] heaven that's what exactly what he did
[33:08] here in first Kings chapter 12 verse 25
[33:11] now just so that you understand what
[33:16] happened here in this particular passage
[33:18] of Scripture Solomon King David had a
[33:23] son and Solomon who reigned in his stead
[33:27] when turned David pass Solomon because
[33:32] he began to serve Idol gods he got
[33:36] married to the wrong women and those
[33:39] women pulled his heart from God and he
[33:42] ended up serving their Idol gods that's
[33:44] why you got to be careful who you marry
[33:47] praise the Lord you just can't get
[33:50] connected with anything it's so
[33:52] important you believe this message you
[33:54] find somebody else that believe this
[33:55] message don't you be out there fooling
[33:58] around with somebody don't know this
[33:59] message that that would set you up for a
[34:02] lifetime of heart ache and right now I
[34:07] see my oh it's just so beautiful I don't
[34:09] just you you keep playing that devil and
[34:12] you watch what your life turned out to
[34:14] be don't play games don't thank you
[34:18] smarter than a devil even using these
[34:20] tricks for years and and you know what
[34:21] you want to know why the devil use the
[34:24] same trick over and over generation
[34:26] after generation because it works that's
[34:29] why he uses he ain't got to change it it
[34:31] works and i haven't seen people my
[34:35] generation thought they were smarter
[34:36] than the devil now i'm watching another
[34:39] generation come up they think they
[34:41] smarter to the devil you're not it's the
[34:44] best that your best fortification to
[34:46] stay behind this word and get the Holy
[34:48] Ghost all right but outside of that the
[34:51] devil got you on the owner you just wait
[34:53] you just wait oh that's all you got to
[34:57] do look you know that's why when the
[34:59] truth
[34:59] were going to different countries and
[35:03] God were giving the land he tell them
[35:04] destroy the babies kill the babies
[35:06] killed the babies now most people say
[35:09] why would God cute little innocent
[35:12] babies you know why cause I'm David's
[35:13] gonna grow up one day and one letter
[35:15] gonna ax what happened to their mom and
[35:17] daddy and when they found out you killed
[35:20] a mom and daddy what you thinking a
[35:21] little baby don't want to do to you you
[35:23] better kill the baby it looked things
[35:30] your life little baby things right man
[35:32] you better kill them because if you
[35:34] don't kill it is going to kill you I'm
[35:38] just church i'm telling you look at this
[35:42] because so what happened redbone a
[35:47] Solomon because he because he went out
[35:50] to these I ragazze God told him say I'm
[35:52] going to split the kingdom I'm a split
[35:54] the kingdom and i'ma give ten tribes to
[35:56] one leader and then i'ma give another
[35:58] two tribes to another leader and and at
[36:02] this time Raya bone actually became the
[36:05] leader of a couple of the tribes and
[36:07] then Jeroboam was given ten other tribes
[36:11] right so Jeroboam was it was a prophecy
[36:14] that he was going to lead to lead the
[36:16] children of Israel God had given them
[36:18] ten tribes prophet came to him told me
[36:20] exactly what was going to happen here
[36:22] God has already manifested it and
[36:24] Jeroboam does something that he should
[36:26] not have done verse 25 says then
[36:34] Jeroboam bill Shechem and mount ephraim
[36:37] Ephraim Ephraim right and dwelt therein
[36:41] and went out from dense and built a
[36:44] pinwheel and Jeroboam said in his heart
[36:47] now shall the kingdom return to the
[36:50] house but David now what he was afraid
[36:52] of is that as as he built these the you
[36:55] know different places in these when it
[36:57] when it's time for the people to go to
[36:58] worship oh my help us Lord right here so
[37:01] when it's time for the people to go to
[37:02] worship he was afraid that when they
[37:04] went back into Jerusalem or something
[37:06] like that the worship that their hearts
[37:07] would turn towards rainbow so what he
[37:10] did was actually build a tabernacle set
[37:12] of people did not have to
[37:13] Oh to talk to Jerusalem to worship now
[37:17] God have established certain places for
[37:19] the people to go worship even me
[37:20] Jeroboam building nothing else but
[37:23] Jeroboam did this because he was afraid
[37:24] that the people when they went to
[37:26] worship my when they went to worship he
[37:29] was afraid that he was going to lose the
[37:31] people that same spirit lives today
[37:34] that's why some people don't fellowship
[37:37] because when the church go to worship
[37:39] they afraid that they might lose some of
[37:41] the people so to actually keep the
[37:43] people away from the fellowship you got
[37:47] the oh my god you got to be confident in
[37:51] the God that is called you remember
[37:55] brother Anderson made a comment one time
[37:57] said of God told you to God called you
[37:59] to Pastor 500 you are not going to have
[38:01] 499 you like I have 501 you're gonna
[38:04] have 500 if God called you to pass 25
[38:07] you're not gonna have Tim they're not
[38:09] gonna have 20 you're gonna have five you
[38:11] got to be confident what God called you
[38:13] to do but you got people now that but if
[38:16] they come up with all kind of things as
[38:18] why they can't they will not announce
[38:20] meetings amen they're not going to
[38:24] announce the meeting because they're
[38:25] afraid if they go so I oh lord have
[38:29] mercy I've seen people know that a
[38:32] meeting meeting been announced for
[38:34] months and then they set up their own
[38:38] meeting on the same weekend that keep
[38:41] day people waiting from that other
[38:42] meetings in the message that's that's
[38:49] that's way if God gave you God gave you
[38:52] and the other thing I found out my
[38:54] church is that every Church could have a
[38:58] group of people that's what you call the
[39:01] pillars the backbone no matter what
[39:05] happened nectars that group right there
[39:07] going nowhere every church got him I
[39:10] could I could tell you churches that we
[39:13] we grew up in you know Pentecost
[39:15] Baptists all that their families still
[39:17] hitting them churches that we was there
[39:19] that was there when we was there 35 40
[39:23] years ago they still there they're not
[39:25] going nowhere and I've watched the
[39:27] churches
[39:27] through all kind of changes guess what
[39:29] their families are still right there
[39:31] every church got families like that
[39:33] every church got got a group like that
[39:36] and all you got and those ones that are
[39:38] called a bill that that community praise
[39:43] the Lord church as a pastor you you
[39:45] never thought you don't want to be like
[39:47] this don't be like this this this guy
[39:50] right here Jeroboam God God gave him
[39:53] them tribes he didn't have to do nothing
[39:55] to try to keep them people God gave him
[39:58] that but look at what he does verse 27
[40:03] if this people go up to do sacrificing
[40:05] the house of the Lord at Jerusalem then
[40:08] she'll the heart of this people turn
[40:09] again unto their Lord even unto redbone
[40:12] king of Judah and they shall kill me and
[40:14] go again to rebel king of Judah so he's
[40:17] afraid look at what he does whereupon
[40:20] the king took counsel me two calves ago
[40:23] oh and said unto them it is too much for
[40:27] you to go up to Jerusalem but hold on
[40:29] God's Oh Israel which brought the up out
[40:36] of the land of Egypt and he set the one
[40:40] in Bethlem Bethel and the other put he
[40:43] in dan and this thing became a sin for
[40:49] the people went to worship before the
[40:52] one even unto Dan so brother branham
[40:58] tells us here is that when they did that
[41:01] that's when their names were blotted out
[41:05] and that's why you don't the ones that
[41:06] went to Dan that's why I Dan right here
[41:09] is not over here in the book of
[41:10] Revelation during the Tribulation Period
[41:13] 144,000 12,000 out of each tribe dan is
[41:16] not represented because what just
[41:18] happened here in first Kings 12 that's
[41:21] why dan is not their God remember his
[41:24] word and even all the way over the book
[41:27] of Revelation let that promise was still
[41:29] in effect that's powerful to me if God
[41:34] remember what he said in first king I
[41:36] mean action Deuteronomy and saw the peg
[41:38] manifests in first Kings 12 he
[41:41] would not let dance now another other
[41:43] thing i want you i want to make it clear
[41:44] is that it's only under heaven under
[41:48] heaven but will read another scripture
[41:50] where when things go back into the
[41:52] millennium millennial reign when it gets
[41:56] back to their then all wrongs are made
[41:58] right and you'll see dan is back in at
[42:01] that point in time my god alright so
[42:04] let's another scripture here Hosea for
[42:06] and 17 wise a will see that he from is
[42:14] not there because of Hosea for and 17 oh
[42:28] my alright says this and Hosea for and
[42:33] 17 Ephraim is join the idols let him
[42:36] alone because II from winning ty dolla
[42:38] tree they also were their names were
[42:43] blocked out under heaven which mean that
[42:45] they would not be represented here in
[42:47] 144,000 leave on Joseph was substituted
[42:50] for Dan and Ephraim over here in 144,000
[42:55] when Godzilla with the Jews again the
[42:57] the that that day I mentioned you all a
[43:01] few weeks ago how they're even right now
[43:04] in Israel there are families that have a
[43:07] table set and they have a chair sitting
[43:11] there at the table and while they're
[43:13] sitting there eating their meal I have a
[43:15] certain time of the mill the oldest boy
[43:17] of the family get up and go to the front
[43:19] door just open the front door and when
[43:21] he opens that door they are actually
[43:24] under expectation that he lied the
[43:26] Elijah will come and join them for meal
[43:28] this is happening right now in Israel
[43:30] been happening for years they're
[43:32] actually looking for their witnesses and
[43:34] if they are actually under expectation
[43:37] church we don't have much longer where
[43:39] God's going to stop dealing with the
[43:41] Gentiles and he's going to start dealing
[43:43] with these Jews right we don't have much
[43:45] longer so we got to get things right now
[43:48] get our skirts clean now right we don't
[43:52] have much longer other thing I want to
[43:54] since we there in the book of Hosea
[44:08] verse 6 it my people are destroyed for
[44:11] lack of knowledge because thou has
[44:14] rejected knowledge i will also reject
[44:17] thee that thou shall be no more no no
[44:20] priest to me seeing that has forgotten
[44:23] the law of thy God I will also forget
[44:26] that children and here it is people are
[44:29] rejecting knowledge rejecting the Word
[44:32] of God that is happening in our day and
[44:34] when you reject it you'll be destroyed
[44:36] because of that right so be very very
[44:40] careful that's what God has given to us
[44:42] is special it's precious we ought to
[44:45] cherish it let's thank God for it
[44:47] alright let's go on a little further
[44:49] here let me see i think i have i got
[44:53] something that I want to read maybe
[44:56] we'll pull this up this is a pretty long
[45:00] quote here let me just see something I
[45:03] want to just trying to go back and show
[45:05] you yes under heaven under heaven
[45:10] according to Revelation 743 these are
[45:14] these tribes Dan and Ephraim were
[45:16] missing because of the idolatry they
[45:18] found themselves involved in so what
[45:21] we're seeing is their names were blotted
[45:22] out under heaven that's what the Bible
[45:25] actually told us see if I can just pull
[45:28] this up for you can I go to the next /
[45:35] Deuteronomy it told us that they would
[45:36] be blotted out I want to just remember
[45:39] I'm going to try to read a quote here
[45:40] for you and this is a if you could just
[45:49] fill up the quotes also on on slide 11
[45:55] and your church age book if you would
[45:58] get to page 270
[46:17] alright actually go back down that's
[46:20] where i'm going to start it in your
[46:23] church age book if you have it it would
[46:25] be a lot easier for you just follow me
[46:27] here in your church age but others you
[46:28] could just follow right on the screen
[46:29] this will be a lungful i'll read this
[46:32] and then we'll actually stop at this
[46:36] point tonight I do have a like I said
[46:39] there's I got a few more slides on this
[46:41] subject as far as people that would be
[46:44] blotted out their names were there but
[46:47] they were actually blotted out but I
[46:49] just want us to take up time to really
[46:50] get this the way that brother Branham
[46:52] just brought it to us so here the key
[46:55] thing that I wanted you to get is that
[46:56] it was under heaven according to
[47:00] Deuteronomy 29 verse 20 says the low but
[47:04] not stare him but then the anger of the
[47:05] lord and his jealousy shall smoke
[47:07] against that man and all the curses that
[47:09] are written in this book sure lie upon
[47:11] him and the Lord shall blot out his name
[47:13] from under heaven from under heaven now
[47:16] let's pick this up page 2 71 right in
[47:20] the middle of the page is that right 270
[47:25] yes yes the first paragraph where it
[47:29] says note particularly that the
[47:31] punishment for idolatry was that the
[47:33] name of that tribe was to be blotted out
[47:35] from under heaven Deuteronomy 2920 it
[47:39] does not say that it would be blotted
[47:40] out in heaven but from under heaven
[47:45] that's very key it wouldn't be blocked
[47:47] out in heaven but under heaven and that
[47:50] is exactly as as it is for now Israel is
[47:53] back in Palestine and soon the Lord will
[47:57] seal the 144,000 of them but from that
[48:01] number dan and Ephraim are missing and
[48:05] he's rereading here at the book of
[48:07] Revelation verse of chapter 7 verse 43
[48:10] four through eight and I heard the
[48:12] number of them which were sealed and
[48:14] there were sealed 144,000 of all the
[48:18] tribes of the children Israel of the
[48:20] tribe of Judah were sealed 12,000 of the
[48:22] tribe of Reuben were still 12,000 of the
[48:24] tribe of gad we're still 12,000 of the
[48:27] tribe of Asher Asher were sealed 12,000
[48:31] of the tribe of neft alum were still
[48:33] 12,000 of the tribe of manassas were
[48:35] sealed 12,000 of the tribe of Simeon
[48:37] were sealed 12,000 the tribe of Levi was
[48:39] still 12,000 of the tribe of Issachar
[48:41] were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of
[48:43] zebulon were sealed 12,000 of the tribe
[48:45] of Joseph was sealed 12,000 of the tribe
[48:48] of Benjamin were sealed 12,000 note Dan
[48:51] and Ephraim missing now you know the
[48:55] average person going through that
[48:57] particular scripture you just looks at
[48:59] the 12 tribes of Israel but the Prophet
[49:02] picked up no there was two things
[49:03] missing then he took his back in the
[49:04] scripture showed us why they were
[49:06] missing right very very important
[49:09] statements there it goes on said now
[49:11] with this see Daniel 12 1 which refers
[49:14] to these 144,000 being sealed during the
[49:17] sixth seal and the time of the Great
[49:19] Tribulation or Jacob's trouble and at
[49:21] the time and at that time shall Michael
[49:23] stand up the Great Prince which standeth
[49:24] for the children of that people and
[49:27] there should be a time of trouble such
[49:28] as never was since there was a nation
[49:30] even to that same time and that and and
[49:34] and at that time by people shall be
[49:37] delivered every one that shall be found
[49:39] written in the book however after this
[49:42] period of tribulation during the
[49:44] Millennium as seen by Ezekiel in chapter
[49:48] 48 verse 1 through 8 and verse 22 to 29
[49:52] we see the tribes back once more in
[49:55] divine order but from the time that
[49:57] Ephraim and Dan joined themselves to
[50:00] idols they died and those tribes have no
[50:03] more recognition now I realize that
[50:05] since the destruction of Jerusalem all
[50:07] records of all tribes have been lost so
[50:10] that no one can say for sure what tribe
[50:13] he is from but God knows that great
[50:17] guard who is bringing Israel back to
[50:19] Palestine knows exactly which tribe
[50:21] every true Israelite is from and from
[50:23] all the assembled 144,000 Dan and
[50:27] Ephraim will be missing now let me also
[50:29] inject because there's people that feel
[50:31] like there's this lost track and they
[50:35] feel like a lot of
[50:38] african-americans are part of the Lost
[50:40] Tribe of Israel that's not they not even
[50:43] reflected in the book of Revelation
[50:44] they're not there the Lost Tribe is not
[50:47] there right and like I try to tell you
[50:50] if I saw you I'd know where he was born
[50:53] I was there at your birth you came
[50:55] telling you from Israel you can't tell
[50:57] me that I'm not buying it right are you
[51:01] from pleasant City you're not from
[51:02] Israel right but you know it's just a
[51:06] lot of this stuff that people getting
[51:08] into we don't have to you know please
[51:10] talk just just a void that it's just
[51:12] it's a sad and I people surfing
[51:15] searching for knowledge and all they got
[51:17] to do is just follow profit they have
[51:19] everything they need it's right there
[51:21] thank God listen he goes on to bring out
[51:25] here in Ezekiel 48 verse 13 and verse 22
[51:30] through 29 it says here the tribes of
[51:32] Israel so now these are the names of the
[51:35] tribes he's reading right out of the
[51:37] Bible now these are the names of the
[51:39] tribes from the north end to the coast
[51:41] of the way of Heflin and again what is
[51:44] telling us in Ezekiel this is after
[51:46] Tribulation Period descriptors represent
[51:48] the Millennium it's representing a
[51:50] millennium so they were blotted out
[51:52] under heaven but not blotted out in
[51:55] heaven all right so which meant that God
[51:58] was not going to deal with them when the
[51:59] word went back to the Jews those two
[52:01] tribes would not be dealt with during
[52:03] that time when the word went back to the
[52:05] Jews but it's not that God forgot about
[52:07] them two tribes it's just they would not
[52:10] be dealt with right so we want we just
[52:13] want to kind of catch that but it also
[52:15] shows that people can have their names
[52:17] blotted out you separate from the word
[52:20] your name can be blotted out it happened
[52:22] to two tribes it happened to Judas and
[52:25] we're going to find where it happened to
[52:26] some others as well so let's just go on
[52:29] and try to finish this tonight now these
[52:31] are the names i'm reading from ezekiel
[52:33] 48 verse 1 now these are the names of
[52:35] the tribes from the north end to the
[52:38] coast of the way of hell I'm as one
[52:40] gorph to Hamas has a rent in the board
[52:43] of Damascus north wit to the coast of
[52:45] Hamas for these are his his side's east
[52:48] and west a portion for Dan
[52:51] so you can see Dan's name is brought
[52:53] back in and by the border of dan from
[52:55] the east side I'm to the west side a
[52:57] portion for Asher and by the board of
[53:00] Asher for the east side and to the west
[53:01] side a portion for Neftali and by the
[53:04] board of natalia from the east side them
[53:06] to the west side I portion from the NASA
[53:08] and by the border of Manasseh from the
[53:10] east side into the west side of portion
[53:11] for Ephraim you can see Ephraim's name
[53:13] is brought back in all right and by the
[53:16] border of Ephraim from the east side and
[53:18] to the west side a portion for Ruben and
[53:20] by the board of Ruben from the east side
[53:22] into the west side of portion for Judah
[53:24] by the board of Judah from the asylum to
[53:25] the west side etc says moreover from the
[53:28] possession of the Levites and from
[53:33] possession of the city being in the
[53:34] midst of that which is the princes bench
[53:38] between the border of Judah and the
[53:39] board of Benjamin shall be for the
[53:42] prince as for the rest of the tribes
[53:44] from the east side them to the west side
[53:46] Benjamin shall have a portion and by the
[53:49] border of benjamin from the east side
[53:51] them to the west side Simeon shall have
[53:53] a portion and by the border of Simeon
[53:55] from the east side them to the west side
[53:57] it's a car a portion and by the Board of
[54:00] it's a car from the east side them to
[54:01] the west side zebulon a portion and by
[54:04] the border of zebulon from the east side
[54:06] and to the west side gad a portion and
[54:07] by the by the border of gap at the south
[54:11] side southward etc so he's bringing in
[54:14] you know those scriptures out of Ezekiel
[54:16] chapter 48 verse 13 and verse 23 through
[54:21] 29 showing how the tribes are back in
[54:24] perfect order at that time that was
[54:27] during the Millennium rain that they
[54:29] were back in perfect order but when it
[54:31] was time for them for God to deal with
[54:33] 144,000 those two tribes of missing
[54:37] because they went into idolatry I would
[54:42] not want to take a chance as a Gentile
[54:44] and I turned towards idolatry and have
[54:48] my name removed from this Lamb's Book of
[54:50] Life I also went on to sell Christ out
[54:52] for for money I wouldn't want to do that
[54:55] I won't want to take my chance
[54:58] there's others that with you know when
[55:00] we get to the section that will talk
[55:02] about others that will receive eternal
[55:04] life and they weren't even a part of the
[55:06] bride it's because they actually gave a
[55:07] cup of cold water there is people that
[55:09] if they heard that they'd probably be
[55:11] out trying to give a cup of cold water
[55:13] to everybody you don't know who brought
[55:18] her new not so it's not giving that cold
[55:20] water it's living right that's what it's
[55:23] all about you living for Jesus that's
[55:25] what you want to do right but uh but you
[55:28] know some people have a back-up plan i'm
[55:30] gonna give cold water to everybody
[55:31] because i don't know i don't know and
[55:33] that just in case just in case I miss it
[55:35] I want to make it now now trust me i
[55:39] think the people that's gonna make it as
[55:40] people that didn't even know they gave
[55:42] cold water somebody had no idea but but
[55:45] the lord will remind me you know you
[55:47] said when he said when matthew 25 when
[55:50] can i do this you know that what you've
[55:51] done it to the least of these my little
[55:53] when you did it up to me not even
[55:55] realize that you actually did something
[55:56] nice for somebody amen all right so much
[56:00] more to go into will cut off there
[56:02] tonight and we'll get started I will
[56:04] pick up that and go in a little deeper
[56:06] next time we get together let's pray
[56:09] father we thank you for this time will
[56:12] we get a chance to study your word and
[56:15] as your profit is bringing Lord the
[56:18] depth of God to us revelations when we
[56:22] talk about in the book of life now you
[56:24] can't just take a casual study and try
[56:25] to go through this but Lord just really
[56:28] going through the scripture and
[56:29] following it to seeing Lord all the all
[56:33] the little nuggets that are there we
[56:36] thank you for that we thinking that you
[56:38] would give us eyes to see and ears to
[56:39] hear and our prayer God is that as we
[56:42] hear these things that would just cause
[56:44] us all to fall more in love with you we
[56:49] trust father that you continue to be
[56:51] glorified and magnified in our hearts
[56:52] and in our lives some Jesus name we pray
[56:55] amen
