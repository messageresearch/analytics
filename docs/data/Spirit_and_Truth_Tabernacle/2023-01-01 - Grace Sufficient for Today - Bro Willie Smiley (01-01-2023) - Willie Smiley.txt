amen amen praise God if he supplied last year he'll Supply this year and uh what I asked God was for better for more amen because I know there's more where that came from [Music] glory to God the glory to God Amen let's see brother Mark here today God bless you brother Mark uh so good to have you Amen in fellowship with us uh for this new year a man a precious precious brother uh humble brother amen but a very very precious brother we thank God for him I miss you at the camp amen but yeah you had you came to South Florida a little bit better weather down here but we we thank God for all things I just got back in me and sister Erica last night we were traveling from Tennessee and uh had a chance to go and be a part of the winter youth retreat and just had a wonderful wonderful time uh there and uh in service and um and but we were happy to be able to kind of get back into some of this Florida weather as well I just had a desire to be back in church on Sunday morning I I actually have a desire always have a New Year's Eve service it's always my desire because I find that um I think that just the the probably the best thing you could ever do is just go into the new year praising God I think that's just the best thing you can do other folk want to go to parties and all kind of stuff like that but we want to go to church amen we want to just Usher in the year just just worshiping the Lord so God knows I'm going to read a scripture here for us today I'll have you have the just to get it ready on the screen that for me first chronicles 16 uh but before I read that uh Verse 18 is what I'm going to start from um before I read that I did want to just just thank God for a couple things that has happened uh this week we had a couple saints that were in the hospital or had to go to the hospital for different things this week but God brought them out uh and we're grateful for that praise the Lord thank God for watching over sister Capers amen she had an outpatient procedure and we thank God for just watching over her amen [Applause] praise the Lord before I left town I had a chance to go by and visit uh brother Robles and uh and I I know that they were waiting to do a special test for him but they needed his his uh his levels to come down to stabilize and um so we he says brother Jack would you pray for me and I said sure brother I'll pray and we prayed the prayer of faith and I thank God I pray for him on a Tuesday and they were waiting gonna do the test on Thursday so he had to stay there for a couple more days and uh we prayed and then I got word the next day that they gonna do the test Wednesday and uh and that they were trying to get him released from the hospital and everything so I thank God for just answering prayer and uh and touching our brother and just stabilizing him also Brother Joseph went through a man of tremendous surgery there but I've been getting all the updates and the pictures and you know and I think if the right people was in the right place he'd be home right now uh but uh but but the Lord has him there but he's doing so much he's doing so much better and um I mean when I went uh there to see him before I left and I was just just feeling my heart just going out for him but I see him up and doing his things that he normally does and say well we can't wait to have him back in church amen that right before he went in uh we went down there brother Diggs that come here and we went down to Boynton and we were in service and Brother Joseph was sitting kind of in the middle section of the church and my brother did exactly preaching and he'd start running down the aisle like we used to do when we was you know going to the meetings and everything even at brother Wesco church we come from the back running down the aisle amen I mean well we had church and brother I saw Brother Joseph doing that the next thing you know I looked in the audience and I saw two other young men that had got uh uh it became contagious and these two young men looked at him said I think they were saying itself if he can do it praise God I can do it and I start seeing them coming out in the aisle amen Glory train them up the way they should go because when they get old they won't depart from it but I say praise God you know I said the devil don't like this young man for some reason but but uh God loves him amen and we thank God for Brother Joseph praise the Lord amen we also had a a a a new one and add it to the number uh brother Christopher amen help burn Chris Christopher D Anthony Hepburn Junior has been added to the number uh born yesterday a man at eight pounds 12 ounces and we thank God for watching over him and eyes wide open already praise the Lord we thank God for him and uh bringing sister Gabby through amen God is good God is good I I I think it's a a nice sign for for us to enter to the new year with new life amen so we thank God for for that amen I also want to thank the Lord for brother Troy on on Wednesday night withstanding the effects of a changing culture a wonderful wonderful sermon uh just really really appreciate that and I think it's very timely you know for us to understand Satan is just just throwing everything he can at us and we have to withstand what he's doing don't get caught up in the politics don't get caught it's it you know the political realm is controlled by the devil yeah yeah if you don't believe that go back and read Luke 4. where Jesus was told by the devil if you bow down to me I'll give you all these kingdoms the devil is over every government so don't get caught up in that right and you know just all the stuff floating social media you gotta withstand withstand you know Discerning withstand is what the prophets say you got to discern it and withstand it we don't need to be caught up in all of that we're Christians praise God Amen but I appreciate that sermon Amen brother Troy God bless you uh for that amen and um I believe brother Solomon mentioned this little Warriors talking about the devotions we're starting a brand new year and um some of you all I'm not sure if you're aware but we we do have a church app uh where you can kind of go back listen to some of the sermons that we had uh and then also in that church app is a one-year Bible reading program um and um uh I am one of the things that that the Lord put in my just he he called me to it years ago it's been well over 20 years uh that I've read through the Bible every year and I still do it and uh and I want to invite you to come along the journey with me amen this year uh but uh years ago I was I was there at my house and I was picking up my newspaper I wanted to read the sports page just to kind of see what was uh what what had happened in sports and um and I heard the voice of the Lord say if you read your Bible as faithful as you read that newspaper you'd be much further up the road and uh when I heard that I I kind of looked around I said I know that wasn't the devil telling me to read the Bible they would try to put me to sleep when I read the Bible but I know that when the devil said that was the voice of God and I said okay so at that on that day I found a one-year Bible reading plan I started reading on that day it wasn't January 1st I don't know what day it was but when I heard it I responded and I just started reading going through the Bible you know One Year Bible reading plan so I've you know just kind of did different ones over the years and the one that we used in a church app is the one that I found that was just very effective for kind of keeping you engaged amen as you go through the scripture so uh on the app a man we want to encourage you um um you know just just get the app and you can actually just go through day by day and just read you know the Bible reading plan uh not only do we do that but there are other churches that got a little text yesterday from brother Larry Nichols up up in South Carolina I mean North Carolina it says brother Jack did it again this year and I think this has been his second year in a row so he's starting all over again amen today Amen in 2023 so I want to invite you to join us on the journey the way that you get closer to God Is by reading your Bible and praying come on somebody read your Bible and pray if you want to withstand right the stuff that's happening in our culture day you're gonna have to be able to read the Bible and see what the Bible say and look I don't care I know man changes but God don't change God don't change right so we're going to stay what what's what's I mean let's stay stand with something that's unchangeable and uh and that's the word of God so I want to encourage you let's get started again this year reading our Bible and drawing closer uh to the Lord amen we are we're one year closer one day closer one hour closer one minute closer to the coming of the lord we must be ready for his coming I don't want to draw further away from God Amen I want to draw closer to God draw me nearer nearer blessed Lord to the Cross without his diet Amen Let me just read this scripture for you I I uh my daughter had told me something she said dad last year you had made a statement says you said you believe God was going to provide us with our church in 2022 you believe that and um you know uh so I want to come up on the first day of 2023 and I want to State my faith again I believe God can provide us a church this year imma state it again and and I'm gonna keep stating it until I walk into my manifestation amen but this was something that was given to me uh I just looked on it and we didn't date it and I think there might be a reason uh God didn't want us to date it but it's something it's an eternal word that we can hold on to my mother-in-law gave this to me and she was reading uh uh her Bible see you can you can get inspired by reading the word and what I want to do is I like to just take my spam on the word of God man you know that it's more sure than anything you got that you get you can stand on what God Said so as we start the year off I want to just read to you something that God said and and I'm glad my mother-in-law she was there she says reading the Bible and just like the Lord just beginning to Quicken this to her as she was reading the scripture I can stand on that come on somebody I thank God for dreams and things like that but when I get it in the word I got something I can I can anchor myself to because though I mean heavens and earth have passed away but that word will never pass but here in first chronicles 16 Verse 18 the Bible says this is unto thee uh versus saying unto thee will I give the land of Canaan the lot of your inheritance uh when ye were but few even a few and strangers in it and when they went from Nation to nation and from one Kingdom to another people he suffered no man to do them wrong yeah he reproved Kings for their sakes sin touched not mine anoint him and do my Prophets no harm amen it says Sing unto the Lord all the Earth show forth from day to day his salvation now uh what happened go back to verse 18 because what happened is as as my my mother-in-law sister Cobb amen she was reading this uh just the spirit of the Lord just began to speak to her uh through the through the word and and so let's read that verse again saying verse 18 saying unto thee will I give the land of Canaan and she put your own church but that's what the Lord spoke to her uh the land of Canaan in your own church amen the lot and she said the portion of your inheritance when ye were but a few not a lot of members even a few and strangers in it and when they went from Nation to Nation as you said from location to location and from one Kingdom to another people he suffered no man to do them wrong yea he reproved Kings for their sake saying touched not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm sing unto the Lord all the Earth show forth from day to day his salvation and she signed it God's Got Us if he had Israel he's got us blessed be the name of the Lord so I just wanted to read that I think it was very important that we you know just established where our faith is and we are trusting the Lord and just but just holding on to God that he will provide amen just as he did for Israel he's he's the same yesterday today and forever amen amen amen amen all right um so I don't want to hold too much I do want to uh at the end of our service today I want to just read a blessing over you and I'll do that um but um let's just prepare our hearts now for the word ax brother Smiley uh to um to bring the word of God today and and we thank God Amen that uh just I thank God for all the help that we have I forgot to mention it's good to have brother kwaku back he was away Amen in in South America and the Lord took him there and brought him back safely uh I I just thank God I you know all I can say is that God's been good to this little church here amen God's been good and and we will uh we'll we'll always be grateful uh for what he does in our midst amen we'll be very grateful uh let's let's um let's stand to our feet

another year amen I'm grateful to God for bringing us to another year had not been for the Lord who was on my side I don't know where I'd be at this morning it definitely wasn't my strength it definitely wasn't because I was so good last year I'm gonna say this again if it had not been for the loud on my side maybe I don't know nothing about that that's an old time saying maybe some of y'all too young I understand that but I'm gonna say it again if it had not been for the long it was so much sad hey man it's good to be here it's good to have brother Jack with us he I didn't know whether or not he was going last week he was like I got to get out of this it was so much going on so much sickness and you know the heart of a pastor but uh he was like we're gonna be looking at Joshua chapter four and second Corinthians chapter 12. I just want to salute brother Troy that Masterpiece I had to call him the next day because I had to Jet after service and tell him how much I just appreciated um uh his message um on Wednesday night and uh once he preached it it became my message so brother Troy I'm I'm gonna use a little bit of that this morning so uh uh I I appreciate I appreciate the Lord this morning so y'all y'all pray for me because sometimes you know in your mind maybe you don't know but as ministers you start out one way and things kind of just change you so uh yeah I just pray for us this morning uh we want to read from Joshua chapter 3 the first five verses then we'll go to Second Corinthians it says Joshua and Joshua Rose early in the morning and they removed from sidom and came to Jordan he and all the children of Israel and Lodge there before they passed over and it came to pass after three days that the officers went through the host and they commanded the people saying when ye see the Ark of the Covenant of the lord your your God and the priests and the Levi's bearing it then you shall remove from your place and go after yet there shall be a space between you in it about 2 000 cubits by measure come not near unto it that you may know the way by which you must go for ye have not passed this way uh here the two uh hear the two four and Joshua said unto the people sanctify yourselves for tomorrow Lord will do wonders amongst you all right now let us go to uh uh Second Corinthians I noticed just seemed like two random scriptures to put together but we're gonna work on it this morning um it says in the ninth verse and he said unto me Grace my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me amen let's just buy a hit gracious father we just thank you and we praise your God this morning for just allowing us this opportunity to be in the service of the Living God this morning and we're just trusting and depending on you Lord to give us Direction and unction and we appreciate you for all things when it's said it all said and done may you get the glory and honor out of it in Jesus name pray amen amen you may be seated this morning um I would just like to use as a topic this morning uh Grace sufficient for this day all right and uh maybe as a context I'm gonna use brother Troy his message uh uh withstanding cultural influence and uh we like we say we appreciate the holy spirit for God bless you brother kwaku it's good to have him back but with us all Soul trust that he had a blessed uh a couple of services over in Colombia um we we just want to give God thanks and praise for allowing us to see uh just another year uh a year that no doubt was filled with with uh trials and tests on every hand but we we got to give God thanks a praise for his grace is that right you know something that we probably don't deserve half of the time but we just thank God that we we serve a a risen savior a sovereign God a you know a compassionate God a loving God you know because you know we what we think we are y'all ain't gonna be quiet on me already I'm just getting started uh we sometimes what we think we are as Christians and and we we full of mistakes and and we we we we do different things but you know what one thing I'm grateful that God don't look at those things God don't see our shortcomings God don't see the mistakes that we make God only focuses on his word yeah yeah now we focus on our mistakes and the errors that we make and and and you know the the battles that that we might lose we you lose battles but you don't lose the war we have listen at the end of the day we're never going to lose this war right we might lose a battle here is there we might do something and and might you know feel a little conviction uh that's another message I want to preach but not today uh but but you know what we we're not going to lose the war um looking at the scripture in the Book of Joshua just to kind of uh get started uh we we know the children of Israel uh are were called out by promise amen they had come out um and Redemption is in two parts is that right uh you're not fully redeemed unless you come out and you go into Christ right right is that right not not a handshake you know uh some affiliation right some Association that's not Redemption Redemption is you gotta come out right he the call come out and then go into the promise right and and what we find it that the children of Israel they had come out but they hadn't gone in yet is that right uh uh a lot of the people that had come out you know uh originally with with Moses under the ministry of the word for that day a lot of those people who perish because of because of unbelief is that right now we going somewhere but but uh uh here here we find that that it was it they had come to a junction where where you know uh I I like to say this because sometimes you hear people talk about you know uh there's nothing moving and there's nothing going on I don't believe stuff like that uh even even when you look at the children of Israel they were constantly on a journey right they were constantly on the journey and and being on the journey just some people didn't make it into the fullness of the promise but they weren't a people that were standing still they they might have been going around in circles and eventually God had to tell them let's let's go Northwood but um here here we find out I just want to focus on this for a few minutes because of the the hour that we're living in we we realized something church this morning we we've we've come out of of one year right amen no matter how many circles we probably ran in how many things we did on a continuous basis but but you know what there was a change getting ready to take place and I'm I'm gonna drop something that I think that's going to be key for us Amen in this upcoming year right um one of the things we find it's important to follow instructions one of the problems I I think we we have with Christianity and we're going to get into something this morning is that in Christianity you find people trying to lead themselves and people try to you know uh even try to do God a service without it being his will stay right we we found that amen uh uh when Moses was on the scene and in his ministry you had these Brethren raises up and you ain't the only holy you you find all of that and but what you find in all of that you find death you you find Death when you when it when any time you begin to break the the standards and the programs of God I'm gonna happen I'm gonna have to take this off uh you you find you find people dying is that right God it's important for us to understand something from The Young to the old God sets principles in the scripture for a purpose and the purpose is for your benefit is that right God God God God has an order and anytime the orders of things is broken I said this last last time I preached but sometimes people misunderstand things but I'm only preaching y'all uh the reveal words and I'm gonna show you why if I get to it all because I got a lot of hair on my foot this morning uh it's it's so important and we gotta keep this in mind no matter how long you've been in church no matter how long you've been around no matter what your position is how much money you got how educated you are it's important to follow in the program of God if you're ever going to be successful in God foreign if if you're ever going to fulfill the purpose and plan of God what God has for us it's important for us to you know following the program and the standards and ordinance and different things that God has laid out right right this is this this is a God thing amen is that right it's it's his plan his program we're fulfilling his purpose it's what God had in his mind right is that right because let's let's think about it when we were in sin we have a whole lot in our mind all right we might have wanted to be educated we might have wanted to do things like that but outside of God you would have perished with all of your money with all of your success if it's not connected to the thing that's Eternal you perish is that right well you never you never even spit on the sidewalk no matter in all of your goodness if if you don't accept Christ you perish with our good selves you you still perish so you you just have to appreciate God for his grace I do right I do I'm I'm here 35 years uh plus by the grace of God right The Sovereign Grace of God by the program of God because of what God had in his mind and here uh God's family God's Church who we are this morning right at a spot where they were getting ready to cross over and into a new day all right a new time right right new Fellowship new experience that's where we are this morning is that right we we've come out of a one year and and we leave we listen to church hindsight they say it's 20 20. right right and you know sometimes when I think about it uh it's like yeah but even sometimes in knowing certain things we still do the opposite that's just goes along with human nature so we can't live in the past we gotta refuse to live in the past right yesterday is gone all I didn't accomplish yesterday I can't look back at it I just gotta you know uh uh keep focus and keep moving forward see amen and that's what we got to do this morning we got to just continue to move forward right and and scripturally why watch something Watch the watch the order of God and it's gonna bless us right there's an order to the things of God God speaking the Joshua Joshua and watch what he tells Joshua and it's going to be good for us this morning church right see to break the order you lose you you just really lose your life right yeah he he tells the church he says listen we're getting ready to go on the move right amen you don't you don't even know anything about where you go in the direction or anything else is that right you you don't even know see we don't even we don't even begin to know what this year gonna hold what we gonna be able to encounter but he does [Music] come on yeah come on Joshua greater man as he was a great warrior and everything else right he didn't know either but he had the amen learn to follow God follow the order of God right you told him listen I want y'all to do something for me I the priest's gonna go first right and you don't get too close because if you get too close you might not know they might change you might be too close and don't know where they going you you stand back up you stand back a little ways and and let and let these guys with the word right lead you right right not just saying something all right we ain't shout real good but I just said something see you don't want to try to do God of service without it being his will right come on like like David and David's time right he he did direct opposite of the original thought of God right because because God showed us a principle right here in the Book of Joshua right it's it's always the the uh priesthood with the uh carrying the Ark of the Covenant not the businessman not the smart people not not the sisters not all of that no it ain't it don't go like that right it's it's not that it's it's the ministry carrying the word David consulted and this is what we do we consult the captains of this one and the captains are doubt winning your best friend and your co-workers and and girl y'all don't talk to me this morning right and and they they built see watch culture culture causes you to build right uh just something new see amen a new organization a new ministry a new and bring forth a new thought but from that new thought brought death to a man right because there was a principle there and and if they would look back at the word and saw the order of God that man would not have died reaching out trying to catch the the Ark of the Covenant when it was falling see because it would have been on the shoulders of the Levites the Levites would have been carrying it not a new way not a new order yeah I just said something but I don't even know if y'all caught that see when any time you bring in new ways new orders now this is going to be this is gonna be good right for where we going next Watch what it produces it produces death right right because if the ark was on the shoulders of the Levites they was positioned to handle it right it shows you something the cart wasn't wasn't efficient or sufficient it broke the order of God we don't think about these things amen as as Christians and to see the importance of it right amen this year let us let us make sure we find ourselves behind the word right behind the word because right it's that's where your protection is that's where your Victory lies right that's where your leadership lies behind the word behind the ministry carrying the anointed world now we're still moving this morning right amen amen this this was the the order that was given to the church a man that that unfolds itself all the way over into this hour that we're living in because God don't change he don't change his mind about his word that was just a shadow but there's a truth in these things also we must God anoint because how could you uh uh hear a letter preacher preach and he got to be called right no matter how much education you got it's because it's got to be a calling it's you got to be gifted and those things is there before the foundations of the world no matter how much schooling you got no matter how much you read it how many takes you got that don't make you a preacher it won't make you a preacher right and if you ain't gifted the shepherd you won't be a shepherd right if if no matter what you say right if you if you ain't gifted an evangelist you will never be a good evangelist right you might say well I'm a teacher and you get the fumbling with the scriptures and and and just having the thing tied up all over the place it shows you ain't no teacher come on you stumbling you're stumbling and bumbling he's like bro you ain't no teacher a real teacher got a real good handle on the word right amen a teacher and a teacher can't pastor right but one thing I I you you know about a pastor a pastor can teach maybe not like a teacher but he can teach he can get under an evangelistical anointing and not be an evangelist he can have prophetic insight and not be a prophet see we've been giving folks titles and all kinds of stuff it's like what in the world are people doing gifts and stuff like that is in the body you don't even have to be a a preacher to be used Amen in the body to prophesy something this morning well praise the Lord I feel I'm starting to feel good is that right amen we can't be given titles we just gotta understand the order but I better move off with this his stuff huh but but I want to encourage us this this morning Amen to follow a man the lion of the thought of God right let's let us learn how to follow the word put the word before us and follow follow the world not us getting ahead of the word right amen but let us stay behind the word let us stay behind leadership that's where we get messed up at right amen we don't we don't see the importance of leadership and following behind not getting ahead of feeling like you're on the same level because you're not all right you not and all you're going to do is make a mess and and wreck up right I I've seen I've seen it over the years um where people people don't understand the layout and the importance of uh of following behind the word right this is just January 1st y'all it's a new season it's a new day right glory to his wonderful name so so you know y'all got that part this morning that that is that is of the utmost importance going into another year if we do that right look at the scripture we'll find ourselves a blessed right we'll find ourselves blessed amen even when the enemy comes in we'll find ourselves blessed right amen uh let us let's just kind of move a little a little further this morning like we said um we we I want to kind of use a little something I'll tell you what brother track brother Troy did he always do a good job you know I always get a whole lot of out of the things that he he brings out he sometimes you know and that's just the nature of preaches you preaching you'd be like why well I don't think I brought that across and this that the other and the next man be like what dude you did your thing you did your thing amen and I and I don't be impressed by a lot I but when I hear certain things I feel like but I was that was that was that was real good yeah we wanna we wanna look at the day and hour that will that we're living in because uh we we want to look at culture and and I want to maybe try to Define culture uh I'm not a smart smart dude I could read a little bit so I'm gonna read y'all the definition right uh because people people people from a scripture's standpoint in the day and hour that we live in and I find that people taking a lot of things for granted and I think it's because we just really lack spiritual understanding right and and we don't realize there's an influence right and we're gonna get in we're going to talk a little bit about the Pale Horse right right there's an influence yeah that's there's a there's a a law of contrast all the time there's a there's a there's a negative and a positive influence right come on that's that's a when we think about culture it's it's it has some negative parts and it has positive right glory to God it does and you just gotta you just got to be able to look at this holistically and and and just really be able to understand uh and then it'll help us to understand uh us as Ministries you'll understand me better right you understand brother Jack brother Troy and the ministers you'll understand us a little bit better uh as as I bring this out this morning because I want I want to help us this morning because a lot of times you know you might think well these guys and and these guys it's not it's that's not what it is right it's it's it's an anointing that we're under that we can't do anything else I I read the quote to you in a minute but so did you listen no matter how much I want to do something else and and no matter how much I wanna I wanna maybe be like TD Jakes come on somebody you know because he got a dynamic Ministry for for you know but it it I don't like to be critical like that but it's the truth it it fits a certain uh group right right right and it appeals to a certain group and it has a he has a lot of Truth and I hate to even that I called his name but uh because I don't like to call ministers names but there's a difference because even even in the spoken word is the Original Seed your Prophet was trying to explain his ministry in the day that he was in and showing what these other brothers Ministries was all about and then what his ministry was all about and the anointing that he was up under that was vital that was key for the day that we living in and I'm gonna get to it if I can and with with without it we'd be sucked up right we'd be sucked up wow because of the the influence right right see that that's an inspiration there's a writer going forth and that writer is to pair horse and his ministry is death come on Church see and and this is in multiple levels we don't even people can't even begin to grasp right what he's writing it's it's the inspiration of the the white the red and the black all can jail into one and it's a a power horse riding and that Rider is death right glory to God but culture culture is is a way of life of a group of people watch this and it's negative and positive it's the the behavior because you know we have a behavior as sons of God right adoption is based upon Behavior right right it's the report back to God of the behavior of the Sun what's their behavior right just to see all them mature enough to really handle the checkbook right Amen to see if they so it's it's it's the negative because there's a negative behavior that we're seeing that we have got to combat right right because we we don't have no choice it's the anointing that we're up under because of this eagle right amen that we cannot do anything else but they seem so critical and they seem right they above you just don't understand that's all that is when it just seemed like you know you know you hear all sorts of things right but they just seem like they better right than everybody else and and this no you just don't understand the the level of understanding that we have it's humility it's the grace of God but in this age people just just just not getting it right but and here's the thing you got to thank God for being elected amen right like brother Brandon would say that's not skilled milk being predestinated right having representation that's not skim milk right we're not talking about religion we talking about a man being a part of a body a body move right but culture is a way of life of a group of people the behavior beliefs values symbols that they accept right genuinely without thinking about them right that there's a lot of things that people accept that they don't really think about they don't filter these things through a thinking man's field to and and we we we're willing to accept all right right behaviors thoughts that's political that's religiously from a humanistic standpoint and then we we start breaking it down to where I wear this I'm white and they're black and and we're Superior and we're looking for Supermans and I'm going somewhere church this morning that stuff majority of this stuff come from the pit of Hell realistically most of that stuff will not get you in the globe whether you American you Chinese you Haitian you you know I don't care where you from Africans whatever right you you those those cultural things you can't pass through a man of thinking man's filter that's why I thank God for the son of man I thank God for a an inspiration of equal anointing for the hour that we're living in because you know the the the the age and the hour and the inspiration and the spirits of this age is on steroids yeah right just that thing just struck me thinking about all of the things that I've heard said through the lips of a prophet and studying I'm like man he he he saw it right right but I don't think he he could really imagine it being this bad right because I don't think he was shown everything right but I think he saw enough to lay things out that when we start to seeing things we like wow he had a real Point amen amen he had a real point right because let's let's let's look at some things this this morning I'm still going I'm still going somewhere right uh we realized we back in Genesis right yeah Genesis Luke right look at the look at look at and I'm something that I was something that I I I was reading maybe a week or two ago uh as it pertains to uh marijuana hope nobody don't smoke weed praise the Lord glory to God nah nah I ain't gonna lie I used to stop let me say that I used to smoke weed I haven't endowed in 35 years or better uh but one of the things I get into I get into an argument because I work I work around I work around a bunch of pot heads and wine biblings and everything on my job and we get into this we get into these arguments about my day and this day right and and I argue with them now from experience I hope it's all right I don't smoke weed Church but I did smoke weed I y'all know me I wasn't a great I had a great guy now but I definitely one of the great guy then my greatness is because of Jesus Christ anything that I am I attributed to God and we argue because they I'll be saying buying the stuff that y'all know is stank it has such an aroma and uh I said man we could smoke and hide it y'all okay it don't even have to be lit right it could just be in your pocket and you can smell it you like and my cousin he arguably like cause you got a nose like my mama well that was my aunt she didn't smoke so it's like if I get around it automatically my body reacts I start coughing it I lost somebody somebody smoking weed up in here right and we and and but in the article what the article said it talks about the the the people that smoking it and what is causing more of anxiety right everybody I'm nervous and I'm this yeah you need to stop smoking that weed depression this smoking because of the high levels of TAC that's in it right trying to get them to see these things are manufactured right and and my cousin we argue it's like bro wait mentally we just on different levels right it's like brah these guys have tapped into the laboratory of God and they've experimented right bringing all of these things right taking taking what was natural and and through through through knowledge placing things in there and and look at the effects right we got more murder right we we got more of a mental disease right I couldn't quite comprehend um years ago when when I used to preach things and I used to read things and I just really didn't have the the the the data and the information I believed it but but now you know uh being able to really see means to understand uh I could really see how pathetically brother Bradham would talk about this age that we're living in right and and how insanity right uh all of these things is on the we got more churches but we got more institutions right we got more technology more information more more medicine but we got more hospitals more infirmities we got we got more of everything right man that's tapped into the laboratory of God eating from the Tree of knowledge of Good and Evil but and everything ain't bad right right but just look at the the detriment yes right and this is what a lot of young people ain't understanding they thinking they're having a good time no you messing yourself up right now you you know you can't think writing and you seeing stuff and you it's it's all of this Tac hallucinative and they're experimenting and watch culture is promoting right right they look what they they it used to be illegal for you to smoke weed all right they've legalized it they're getting they cut but it's an underlying thing in that also they making it accessible but with accessibility that comes damage comes comes damage break the dangers that's associated uh you know when do we eat smoking that's right right come on I would I I didn't think about it until earlier and I didn't have the art I can't even know where I read it at but I read it right you could probably look it up yeah uh so uh say it that say this don't smoke weed young people don't let anybody entice you because it's and I know y'all said it's influence if if you got kids going to school daddy gotta go to school I ain't gonna say that they got Neighbors if they got cousins well praise the Lord most of the trouble I got in was with my cousins most of the bad influence was because of older cousins sisters right so just can't say school but you you gotta you gotta be able to sit the these kids down and show them the the the detriment of it right drinking been taking folk out since way way Bible days been causing the breakages of families and things of that nature right amen uh but but in in the culture right look at look at what's been released on society and I'm gonna tell you something Church Society is insane and don't know it exactly right but I'm telling you people people are insane and and y'all sisters hold on I'm gonna have to say something but this don't pertain to y'all but I just wanna I just wanna get give us an opportunity to look at things thinking about some of the things that brother Branham talked about and the Visions he saw you know women you know to be with fig leaves and and all of these different things and and I'm gonna hit something real quick because people like to argue with me about you know wearing pants and and it's a big discussion right but it's something that people don't really really want to look at we want to argue about it but we don't really want to look at these things right and and from this seed form look look where we are with these things now right at a point where folks thought that well maybe back in the day that you know they're taking something from us and then we got women's live and we got all of this and we we got all of that and you know we no it is something that because it's always something that starts out innocent [Music] right come on now because if you look the white horse rider well I know ain't gonna be able to read these quotes from uh the fifth C Obama try to get to it I ain't got that much time but right um um everything starts out in an emphasis infancy form or or stage of Innocence seem like it's don't right but from that look just let's look at where we are amen look at look at what they come out in now look at because of culture look at the dress standard right and it's supposed to be the backbone but look at the dress standard see-through that's right come on and they say d this is closed they sell this stuff as cold and there's nothing it's nothing there some Twigs or something you know but is the truth that you have yeah see look look at look at where it has has gone look the little leotard things y'all know a little bit more about spandex y'all know what I'm talking about now don't don't get quiet on me the little spandex stuff right that probably was a time where you know it was worn underneath something nah they come right outside yeah you you go to the airport it's a hunt uh it's two below zero out and they just got a little spandex so I'm walking through there it's like people are they mine it just it just right it shows you the insanity and and the the influence of of of culture right the influence and what we gotta fight right yeah they don't say that brother I won't preach this mountain all right we've got to fight these things even in the church I ain't gonna get much witness but it's okay because I know what I'm talking about right things start from an infancy standpoint right but but okay let's be realistic right look at where it's at now come on look it look just look at the this is the standard this is what culture is saying is the standard right right and and this is what's you know I'm reminded of a statement that the prophet of God made about uh Jacqueline Kennedy right being the president the president's wife right and and her in the water head them dudes that they had back in the days right and then he said she influenced she was the influence right and and I'll take it a little bit further we had Michelle Obama and I ain't got nothing against Michelle right Michelle Obama right but she is an influential figure especially for African-American yes culture culture right we're not we and I'm not even dealing with Christianity right now right right we're just dealing with culture and how and how culture has has actually and I heard a preacher say this but culture has entered into the church but I heard a preacher says culture shouldn't be influencing us we should be influencing culture we should not want to try to be like the world but we should want the world to be like us we supposed to be the standard not culture my culture but culture has dictated Humanity's beliefs on every level but it's it's in line with scripture we're in the days of Noah right we're in the days of life and and look at the mindsets and and the thoughts and different things that's that culture has dictated and look at the influence and and look how they fight us right this becomes hate speech and and and culture has become the norm these things has become the norm we want to normalize these things right up even in the church well praise the Lord amen but the inspiration of it is coming from the Devil right the inspiration of it is coming and I'm gonna tell you something here's here's the thing the only way that God could ever have a church without spot a wrinkle any such thing right God was smarter than us see God watch this and I'm gonna show us something from a spiritual standpoint that God down through the history has set certain things in motion every time the devil moved and set something in motion God said something in motion also to combat that to combat that right because if there was nothing to come back the invasion of the thing that thing takes completely over come on come on it's it's just it's just like if if there wasn't a f uh opposing force over in the Ukraine did they say it's not soap this is our country just give me what it takes amen and we'll drive back the enemy Russia would have been took over you Ukraine and all of his occupants all of his resources and everything else and they would be slaves to Russia right but but because a man that that's people that's there that's saying not so under uh the inspiration right right to say listen we we we will combat this thing yeah to the death right we're willing we're willing to die like that fella that was willing to die for uh what was that yeah foreign yeah he was inspired right people around them fearful he got anointed amen inspiration fell on her right they didn't know what he was doing right amen but he was inspired yeah yeah and and that game that gave that gave the the men around him the courage the fight right when he ran down there and gave his life right he he gave us not just his countrymen he had a wife he had children he had nephews and nieces and sometimes amen you know you gotta you gotta just lay yourself down realizing you got wives and children and nephews and nieces and and people that might look at you and perceive you to be a little bit crazy foreign but see it's not that I you know I I'm in a war I'm fight I'm fighting so that y'all don't be overcome Brother Jay and you gotta sometimes say some hard stuff right yeah but but it's spiritual warfare man right and this thing is so subtle Church we're going into 20 uh 2023 right but we're gonna go in there with something this morning right so that we could understand right what's happening the influence of the culture right basically it's man's thinking yeah men that have been from the Tree of knowledge of Good and Evil because to eat from the Tree of Life Is Life and peace and Hell right glory to God enjoyment Glory about 15 minutes y'all y'all I I I hate to hold us too long but uh I I want to show us something brother Brandon brings this out in the fifth seal uh and maybe we're gonna start it uh verse 105. boy I know I need a lot more time than that but I'm I'm shorting it up you know Grace sufficient for this age he says now now uh terms of the Bible said these beasts and Powers knows he said I want you to know this the devil had four uh changing colored beasts all right to go forth on right he had four beats now I'm gonna tell you something I thank God for the opening of the seventh seal right to be to be operating up under that anointing living up under that anointing right because if not we would be consumed uh-huh right we would be consumed because we we wouldn't understand the the ministry right of the Antichrist right because we've made it all natural right we made it natural and we look at everybody natural and we look at everything natural right and these is my children natural you're choosing to go to hell too just like mine if they don't get converted now come on preach with me religion won't do church I'm telling you you got to come God's provided way oh y'all don't talk to me now I ain't putting nobody children in hell ain't even putting mine in hell but I'm just saying right yes sir okay so he said the devil had his his Force changing colored beasts to go forth on he had his four beats uh that was all three of them put it into the the color of one right and made that one to pay a horse and see that's what's riding today a white horse a red horse a black and we've seen each one of those was a stage of his ministry that's the devil's Ministry right yeah yeah amen he's been in stages but God has had something too he said a state a stage of the early church that had formed into denominationalism I'm gonna stop right here for a second now either God started denominationalism or he didn't right come on church and I think any real good theologian no God never started that they might be trapped in it because of meal tickets and everything but realistically they realize God never started one right amen God God birthed the church in the book of Acts right gave them word to base the Ministries on is that right the people call them Christians because they saw the Life of Christ in them is that right amen and they just took the word and preached the word but they never separated and and broke the thing down into well this is our little saying we got to be careful with that stuff too now and right even though we got truth we just got to make sure that we don't have the same kind of mindset even even with the word now I hope y'all hear me clear now and sometimes I'm talking I don't know if people things really register right I'm not doing away with with us but you can see you know sometimes the way that people handle the word it's just a little bitty Spirit there and that's all it takes because look at what we got now I've been somewhere right from all of this truth not the prophet makes a statement he says you know what this been going along and it has not denominated and it can't I believe that part I believe that part you can't denominate Christ right but from what what's here men can make their own little right men can do that and and we help them because nobody steps up with any boldness in the right Spirit to say wait a minute this ain't right this ain't right right but we blow me let me leave that stuff alone but it's the truth anyhow right because because when he started out in the beginning on the White Horse Rider what started out it started out it was innocent right I mean it was it was it was it was innocent but I might have to just preach it come hold y'all too long but but I feel like preaching y'all two hours today praise the Lord hey man I'm telling you something church we we have something that's powerful oh I hope I I ain't mess up my my party okay he says uh uh he says stage of the early church to have formed into denomination and now I see it he said the original Pentecostal Church uh upon whom uh the Holy Ghost was poured out coming down took upon an antichrist spirit for watch this formed and oh now God didn't do this man did this gave birth to some Daughters of organization right changing his power three times this this is the devil right right sure how the devil has moved down through the history of the church and how he's operated under these anointings right glory to God because we we just we we living in a natural world and we look at everything natural and and I'm not sure we catching the spiritual application of things and and the war that that you're in right we are in a war Church and the and the battle and the war that the ministry is fighting right I'm fighting a war right and I'm in a war I ain't no different than y'all I got my fight right but I know when when you you get anointed I realize I'm not fighting y'all as an individual this ain't even I don't do individualism not like that it's spiritualism bringing us the word right amen see brother Smiley Pickett you carnal you call them yeah yeah if if if it's your mindset is that it's carnal you don't you don't even understand what Ministry is is doing it's all about you don't even see your enemy aren't you enemy right right I'm just anointed I'm just inspired I'm living under the seventh seal right I've been writing up under a seventh seal anointing right amen because see party Lord help us I know I don't I'm gonna tell you how to do this because I'm a skill and I'm gonna give y'all some some research go back to the fifth seal if you haven't read it and maybe start at uh 150 and go going down and you're you're nowhere but I'm gonna skip because for time's sake could y'all do that so y'all don't think I'm crazy when y'all leave the church I don't want y'all to think I'm crazy but I knew I I knew I like these Pages start these Pages start building up and I'll be like man I can't get through this stuff you know one setting man it'd be just too much it'd be too much um y'all give me a second I I want to skip down to the fourth seal just to I mean the fifth seal and the four of beasts and then we'll get out of here okay y'all give me 20 more minutes I'm gonna try not to take 20. I'm gonna try to take 10. all over the guy but I gotta find my spot okay because to me this to me this is uh it's it's good it's something that I I think that we we um we need to know okay um like I say the enemy the enemy had four stages of his ride and God sent the different Ministries to to combat that for the purpose that those things don't take the people out right right amen because God's gonna have a church without spot a wrinkle uh brother Banner makes a statement say we're living in a day of perverse teaching right you say Wars will come to do what draw us away all right the devil wants to draw you away from life right I tell you what these things are sticky Church it's a lot it's a real spiritual warfare watch um 139 let's let's go there and I'm gonna try to run out of here he says that's Gallant men he says that's men who can stand he talking about a different name he say the models down Through the Ages there he said they they suffer terribly he said but what was they they were under the inspiration of the spirit of God in all of those ages they did things because of the inspiration of the spirit of God not the spirit of man the spirit of God he said the power 140. don't forget this church and you Brethren on tape I want you to examine this how could men do anything else beside the power of God that had been released to them and when I read that I said Lord I feel free I can't do anything else brother Jack these Brethren can't do we can't this is what's been released to us for your benefit though right and then and then if when it strikes you right you realize I can't do anything else because this is what's been released to me as a Believer as a son and daughter of God I gotta live this because of the inspiration of God that's been released to me as a Son of God and a daughter of God regardless of you know you just have to pray for other people right we're not trying to put nobody in hell right amen but but we're just trying to we're operating under a certain anointing right amen uh he said the power of God that's been released to them he said I'm going to set this box up here to represent that if God sends a certain Spirit amongst them that's the only thing that they can work by it's the spirit that works amongst them so I say Lord thank you that I'm not crazy yeah you know because sometimes I want to change right I want to change but then I can't I can't I'm gonna say this again I can't amen I can't that's right even if I wanted to I can't cause soon as I get anointed here I come I can't why he let me know I can't right amen glory to God see it's the spirit that working amongst them now we will prove that to you by the history of the church by the opening of the seals and the power that's let loose watch exactly the church respond to that anointing but y'all gonna make me tell this building up see if y'all don't respond to this something wrong with y'all if this don't make you say Amen something wrong with y'all I'm telling you y'all sit here instead but something wrong with y'all when I see y'all here sitting looking and saying oh I better smile it is another something wrong with y'all maybe this ain't been released to y'all right oh praise the Lord oh praise the Lord we're gonna run the devil up out of here this is seven Thunder Revival it's a real seven Thunder Revival cause it's been released to us and we can't do nothing nothing I wish Little Brother Joseph was here this morning to run down the island brothers act like we used to see now a man and I maturity brother Jack we realize it's more than just a Saiyan right we understand now more what's been released to us and why we shout and why we aim man right he says by the opening of the seals the power that's let loose watch exactly the church responded to the anointing and they couldn't do nothing else right uh he says now the fourth Beast that was sent forth to combat the Antichrist in this last Beast right are you ready the last Beast that was sent forth are the last power to combat the Antichrist was against the teaching of God Auntie is against see and and this is why people say what's this this is why I'm kind of against a lot of these podcasts and and I sometimes you just have to hate you just have to hate but you realize it's the Pale Horse utilizing these platforms to kill right because it's it's changing the thoughts it's changing the morality right come on Church come on church it's changing the morals yeah just I mean the the way people think right and and just look what we got even in church men afraid but I'm gonna cause if they preach like this that they gonna empty that thing out right but see they can't preach like this because it ain't been released to them right Oh Glory I'm almost there amen he said combat the Antichrist was against the teaching of God the Antichrist he said was it was an eagle so forth he said the fourth living Beast was an eagle now you just study the ages study the scriptures is the eagle showing us something God always sends a an eagle and in in the Bible the last age was an eagle age right so they will know where we at and and what we're living up under right he says and God liking uh the eagle To His prophets now watch the last Age The Eagle age a revealer of the true word right when people come against it you're like wait a minute then you just don't understand the ministry right you'll understand what a prophet Ministry is all about why God civil prophet right amen see these other guys was just reformers this ain't Reformation yeah this revealing just turning our hearts back this exposing the works of the devil right okay let's keep moving he said before God moves into action like he did in the days of Noah he sent forth an eagle when he brought Israel brought Israel Pharaoh's Army was ready to go he sent an eagle right every time he sends an eagle at the last right at the end of it and here he sends an eagle again that's exactly what the word so how can you make it anything else sends an eagle a revealer of the truth aren't you glad for that that's been um falling all through the age 1 189. so how in the world could the ox or the man or whatever Beast was riding how could it ever be revealed into the eagle comes right they had their place they were Godly right Luther Wesley and all those guys under those under those different anointings they had their day they had their place right but if the eagle didn't come culture will suck us up like a vacuum all right we will be overtaken is that right see you say well you know you got to do this and you got to do that for the young people who said that where'd that come from God has an original original Bible Way right as Prius preach the word right yes sir we break down every standards and we still don't get the young people foreign are you getting them to Christ huh what are we getting them to we break it down break it down you keep breaking down the medicine you ain't got no no no healing virtue in the thing is that right because it takes you know enough this and enough debt to make it a man what it's supposed to be to kill but see smart man we we want to take out this and take out that and that's hard preaching and and that maybe yeah why no um let me tell you what the Bible said the Bible said all that the father give us will come on now you preached the word and the Believers will come oh that the father is giving a cop I never lost one [Music] praise God not not one greatest shower he ain't gonna lose him you'll see the trickery of the devil but it's the influence and it's the despair horse riding this power Ministry of death that wants to kill the church take all the oxygen out of the church a lot of form and a lot of religion and a lot of shout and all of that but no word it's the the word that a man brings to life amen is that right cause shout out you want to shout now I ain't got nothing against that now I like the shot but I can't right that ain't what I'm talking about but if we if we break the word down break the word what you shouting over what you got to shout over what's what's stimulating you where's the wine right come on now I'm almost God I'm about ready to go I don't win over my time praise the Lord I'm starting out wrong breaking the order somebody might say well brother banham say you shouldn't preach a good message is 45 minutes then I said God ain't moving but if God move he might take you to 50 minutes y'all gonna be all right okay I'm I'm really there boy I tell you what okay let's get 91. he says and then he raised up another Power he sent a power to meet it then he raised up another Power God sent another power to meet it and then in the last power he brings down the eagle to restore the children back to the original Faith again of their fathers the eagle age then you notice there is no more beast that's all of it that's the end now if if you would take now Revelation 10 1-7 I referred to it remember in the last messages age what was to happen all the Mysteries God would be revealed the eagle amen and remember when the eagle finally comes it'll be a hundredth of one percent that'll listen wow it's an eagle age remember it's all these other Riders and then even Jesus predicted if he did Haitian is coming there wouldn't be no any flesh at all to save for the Rapture it's the scripture right you see where we're at then don't you brother sister let musicians come uh uh amen listen church let me tell you something there's there's a there's a influence there's a pale horse that's riding the name on it is death to kill to kill the church to kill the power of the church to kill the anointing in the church the power and the anointing in the home right just just to do mass destruction but God sent an eagle to meet that to combat right and so church I'll just say this I can't do anything else right I can't I can't because of the age that I'm living in and the inspiration that we're under right we can't help but preach the Untouchable Riches of Jesus Christ we can't help but amen preach a prophet's message a eagle message for Eagles right amen we needed something to meet this evil day right amen we we needed something give me something to meet this evil day if not man we'd have been consumed like a vacuum right we wouldn't be here wouldn't be no Spirit In Truth Tabernacle right might be a little Spirit but won't be no truth come on might have a little bit on it [Music] won't be no truth right because the vacuum beaten sucked all of the word out of the church and we got formed and we got emotions and and things of that nature which is fine but we want that mingle with the word I want to shout over the word don't you I want a shout out to a promise I want to shout over what God is doing church God I believe I believe when I was reading that scripture in Joshua I believe God was speaking to us this morning letting us know we can look forward to some great things some great things to come amen that the new church I I believe it it's going to come in this season all right amen uh 2023 I believe is going to be our year that we'll go in and we'll be able to shout on the coffin and and run down the aisle we'll have our own hour run down have our own eyes thank you y'all didn't come to have church y'all be too starchy for me I need some some good old musicians

appreciate brother a smiley one of the things that um I pray the Holy Spirit will really drive home for us I know we live in a natural world I know that but we cannot continue to look at things from a natural point of view we have to we Are Spiritual Beings and we I mean we come from God we're going back to God we got to see things from a spiritual sign and oftentimes people just uh you know they they don't get it and I know um uh let me also just say this to while I'm here um we stream and we just had this conversation at the at the youth youth meeting um streaming is not the same as being in in the house it's not the same and I was talking about even just in a husband and wife relationship if husband and wife was separated for I mean an extensive amount of time like years and they're just streaming one another is that really a relationship I don't think it is right I mean that you know we we need to be together not not seeing each other on FaceTime and uh so I mean I mean I think I think we you know um we're glad that we're able to help those that you know that might not be able to get to church but but if you can come to church uh we want to encourage you to come to church that's that's that's that's what we want to do and the other thing I want to say is that um you know a lot of times things are preached from this Pulpit is streamed on john423.org which belongs to Spirit and Truth Tabernacle and uh and uh and so when it's when it's preached from Spirit into Spirits preach from Spirit and Truth Tabernacle it is for spirit and Truth Tabernacle I'ma say that again

commandment don't try to get in front of the word and also you're not supposed to get too far behind the word right but everything you do this year keep the word in sight everything every decision you make make sure you're getting something out the word of God to give you a man something to solidify that but don't make no decisions based on feelings and emotions let the word of God lead you amen

attacking in this day oh God we want to draw closer to you we need that a closer walk with thee so I pray God that you would bless us as we leave this place but not your presence thank you for
