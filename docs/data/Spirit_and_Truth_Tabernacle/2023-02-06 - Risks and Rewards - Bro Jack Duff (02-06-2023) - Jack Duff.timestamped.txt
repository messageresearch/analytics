[5:25] we're going to read
[5:27] from verse 23.
[5:30] amen I was going to start with a song
[5:32] but this came across my heart as I when
[5:34] I woke up this morning and
[5:37] you know just thinking of how
[5:39] this man was healed
[5:41] and then the church came against the
[5:43] apostles for the healing and they wanted
[5:46] to know by what power and what name they
[5:48] did these things so we're going to pick
[5:50] up that's just a little background
[5:52] start at verse 23.
[5:55] praise the Lord let me find where I'm at
[5:57] okay
[5:58] and being let go
[6:00] they went to their own company and
[6:02] reported
[6:04] I want everybody to say praise report
[6:07] amen ain't nothing wrong with a praise
[6:09] report
[6:10] amen it and being let go
[6:13] they went to their own company and
[6:15] reported all that the chief priests and
[6:16] Elders has said unto them
[6:18] and when they heard that they lit and
[6:21] when they heard that they lifted up
[6:22] their voice to God with one Accord and
[6:25] said Lord Thou Art God which has made
[6:28] Heaven and Earth and the Sea and all
[6:30] that in them is who by the mouth of thy
[6:32] servant David has said why did the
[6:34] Heathen rage and the people imagine vain
[6:36] things the kings of the earth stood up
[6:39] and the rulers were gathered together
[6:41] against the Lord and against his Christ
[6:43] for other truth thy holy Child Jesus
[6:47] whom thou has anointed both Herod and
[6:48] Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles and the
[6:51] people of Israel will gather together
[6:54] for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy
[6:56] Council determined before to be done
[6:59] and now Lord behold their threatenings
[7:02] and Grant unto thy servants that with
[7:05] all boldness we may speak Thy Word
[7:08] by stretching forth thine hand to heal
[7:10] and that signs and wonders may be done
[7:12] by the name of thy holy Child Jesus and
[7:15] when they had prayed and the place was
[7:18] shaken where they were assembled
[7:20] together and they were all
[7:23] filled with the Holy Ghost and they
[7:25] spake the word of God with boldness

[50:50] um
[50:51] we have a dedication
[50:55] this morning that we we want to do and
[50:59] as we just make ready for that
[51:01] um brother a Christian sister Gabby will
[51:05] be bringing their children a man to be
[51:07] dedicated to the Lord
[51:09] uh on on this morning and so we make
[51:12] preparation just want to read a couple
[51:14] scriptures
[51:15] [Music]
[51:16] um
[51:18] Luke 18 verse 15 through 17 is is what
[51:22] we use amen when we're doing dedications
[51:27] the scripture says and they brought unto
[51:31] him also infants
[51:34] that he would touch them but when his
[51:37] disciples
[51:38] saw it they rebuked them
[51:41] but Jesus called them unto him and said
[51:43] suffer little children to come unto me
[51:46] and forbid them not
[51:48] for if such is the kingdom of God
[51:52] verily I say unto you whosoever shall
[51:55] not receive the kingdom of God as a
[51:57] little child shall in no wise into
[51:59] therein a man so as the prophet taught
[52:03] us we don't
[52:05] sprinkle babies
[52:07] I remember a friend of mine I mean I
[52:10] don't think he went to church one day in
[52:12] his life but when his child was born he
[52:16] um he said I'm going to church and they
[52:19] took the baby to the church to get
[52:21] sprinkled I'm like well why did they
[52:22] rush to that church to get that baby
[52:23] sprinkled like that what's going on come
[52:26] to find out that they were taught that
[52:28] if the child is sprinkled by the priests
[52:30] then
[52:32] um
[52:33] they automatically go to heaven I say
[52:35] what never repented not one time so now
[52:39] I don't know about that so I don't think
[52:41] that's gonna work you know they're gonna
[52:42] need a little bit more than some water
[52:43] to get them to Heaven amen they got to
[52:46] repent of their sins you know and um you
[52:49] know but we don't do that here but what
[52:51] we do is is we dedicate the babies back
[52:54] to the Lord amen we realize that the
[52:57] children came to us from God and we give
[53:00] them back to Lord and we accept the
[53:01] responsibility and we're giving them
[53:03] back to the Lord we accept
[53:04] responsibility we're going to be the
[53:06] ones to raise this child in the ways of
[53:09] God and we're going to teach them the
[53:11] ways of God and just make sure that they
[53:13] they understand who God is we're going
[53:15] to live before them the ways of God
[53:17] right this is what our dedication to the
[53:19] other children is all about so uh we uh
[53:22] we thank God this morning that we we
[53:24] have parents bringing their their
[53:26] children back to the Lord uh here uh the
[53:30] the prophet said this in the message to
[53:31] Paradox it says therefore we bring them
[53:33] and dedicate them any Mothers any church
[53:36] any Creed any color anything else we
[53:40] dedicate all little children to the Lord
[53:44] Jesus Christ amen another scripture I
[53:47] just want to read is out of Psalm 78
[53:49] verse 1 through 7.
[53:52] it says give ear o my people
[53:56] to my law
[53:57] incline years to the words of my mouth
[54:01] I will open my mouth in a parable I will
[54:04] utter dark sayings of old which we have
[54:07] heard and known and our fathers have
[54:09] told us we will not hide them from their
[54:12] children showing to the generation to
[54:15] come the Praises of the Lord and his
[54:17] strength and his wonderful works that he
[54:19] have done for he established a testimony
[54:22] in Jacob and appointed a law in Israel
[54:24] which he commanded our fathers that they
[54:27] should make them known to their children
[54:30] that the generations that come might
[54:33] know them even the children which should
[54:34] be born who should arise and declare
[54:37] them to their children that they might
[54:40] set their hope in God and not forget the
[54:42] works of God but keep his Commandments

[59:52] let's give the Lord another hand a
[59:53] praise
[1:00:01] appreciate uh you all
[1:00:06] um I do need to just have a um a meeting
[1:00:10] with the church after a service there
[1:00:14] um so if you all could just remain man
[1:00:17] uh there I just need to meet with you
[1:00:21] um
[1:00:22] I wanna
[1:00:24] just uh uh take a little thought here
[1:00:27] and we'll read our scripture out of
[1:00:30] Matthew 14. amen
[1:00:34] Matthew 14 and just stand with me if you
[1:00:38] don't mind
[1:00:39] amen see brother Nehemiah back there God
[1:00:42] bless you and man good to see you my
[1:00:44] brother
[1:00:45] praise the Lord
[1:00:48] Matthew 14.
[1:00:52] this whole chapter is good
[1:00:56] but I'm trying to shorten it
[1:01:00] but it's it's
[1:01:02] um it is really really
[1:01:04] good food amen
[1:01:09] when you studied a chapter you'll see at
[1:01:12] the beginning we lost
[1:01:15] a prophet
[1:01:17] uh the prophet John was murdered because
[1:01:21] of what he preached
[1:01:23] but
[1:01:24] he had to decrease so that Christ could
[1:01:27] increase and that was just the way God
[1:01:30] did things
[1:01:31] and uh immediately following you know in
[1:01:34] this chapter I don't know if that's the
[1:01:35] way it really happened in life but but
[1:01:37] in the chapters written after that
[1:01:40] tremendous seemed like defeat then we
[1:01:44] saw this great miracle of 5 000 people
[1:01:46] being fed with two fish and five loaves
[1:01:51] of bread
[1:01:52] lets us know how powerful our God is
[1:01:56] amen and um
[1:01:59] after that we could skip down here
[1:02:04] to verse 22 which is where
[1:02:08] I guess the most of my inspiration is
[1:02:11] coming from
[1:02:13] uh this section of Matthew 15 says and
[1:02:16] straightway
[1:02:18] Jesus
[1:02:20] constrained his disciples to get into a
[1:02:24] ship
[1:02:25] to go before him unto the other side
[1:02:29] while he sent the multitudes away
[1:02:33] and when he had sent the multitudes away
[1:02:36] he went up into a mountain apart to pray
[1:02:39] and when the evening was come he was
[1:02:42] there alone
[1:02:45] but the ship was now in the midst of the
[1:02:48] sea tossed with waves for the wind was
[1:02:52] contrary
[1:02:55] now I guess the the the the the the the
[1:02:57] first verse of our reading Jesus
[1:03:01] encouraged him to get in this boat
[1:03:04] and um the thing that I know about Jesus
[1:03:07] is he already knew
[1:03:09] that the winds was going to be contrary
[1:03:11] but yet he encouraged them
[1:03:15] get in the boat
[1:03:18] constrained them and just imagine what
[1:03:20] he was going through trying to push
[1:03:23] these fellas inside a boat
[1:03:25] don't worry about this don't worry about
[1:03:27] I got that I got I send the people away
[1:03:29] get in the boat get in the boat get in
[1:03:31] the boat right but look at this
[1:03:34] um the verse 25 says
[1:03:37] and in the Fourth Watch of the night
[1:03:40] Jesus went unto them walking on the sea
[1:03:45] and when the disciples saw him walking
[1:03:47] on the sea they were troubled saying it
[1:03:49] is a spirit and they cried out for fear
[1:03:54] but straightway Jesus speak unto them
[1:03:55] saying be of good cheer it is I Be not
[1:03:59] Afraid what words
[1:04:01] and Peter answered him and said Lord if
[1:04:04] it be thou
[1:04:06] bid me come unto thee on the water
[1:04:11] but he thought he was challenging Jesus
[1:04:14] and he said
[1:04:16] come
[1:04:18] and when Peter was come down out of the
[1:04:20] ship he walked on the water to go to
[1:04:23] Jesus
[1:04:25] but when he saw the wind boisterous he
[1:04:27] was afraid and beginning to sink he
[1:04:29] cried saying Lord
[1:04:32] save me
[1:04:34] and immediately Jesus stretched forth
[1:04:36] his hand and caught him and said unto
[1:04:38] him oh thou a little faith wherefore
[1:04:41] this thou doubt
[1:04:43] and when they were coming to the ship
[1:04:45] the wind ceased
[1:04:48] than they that were in the ship came and
[1:04:50] worshiped him saying of a truth Thou Art
[1:04:52] the Son of God Amen the Lord had a
[1:04:55] blessing to the reading of his word
[1:04:56] let's just bow in a word of Prayer

[1:06:44] my name because she always get me
[1:06:45] something really really nice you know I
[1:06:47] really appreciate this year she she gave
[1:06:50] me you know two two gifts one of them
[1:06:53] was a calendar that has just different
[1:06:56] words on it words for the day a and she
[1:06:59] knows that I'm a I like to play Scrabble
[1:07:01] and so she she trying to just boost my
[1:07:05] vocabulary you know and I'm like okay I
[1:07:07] appreciate that some of them words I
[1:07:09] might not ever remember again but
[1:07:11] sometimes you never know something might
[1:07:12] hit you and you can you can play that
[1:07:14] word uh but the other other thing that
[1:07:17] she gave me was a devotion a a daily
[1:07:20] devotion for men uh and uh believes for
[1:07:24] you know all all days of the year and
[1:07:26] while I was going through this devotion
[1:07:28] there was three devotions that happened
[1:07:31] three days in a row that just kind of
[1:07:34] struck me and uh and as I read them I
[1:07:37] said wow you know this is something you
[1:07:39] know here and uh and the title of the
[1:07:41] devotion was risk risks and
[1:07:46] um that first slide there I believe
[1:07:49] um the this was the on January 14 2023 I
[1:07:52] got this it says and this is the
[1:07:55] devotion that I'm reading that morning
[1:07:56] says when God asks you to follow him
[1:07:59] he often doesn't give all the
[1:08:02] information about what is happening
[1:08:05] right away
[1:08:06] amen when you step out in faith he gives
[1:08:11] you guidance as you go
[1:08:13] I said wow he gives you guidance as you
[1:08:16] go Moses risks his life by approaching
[1:08:20] pharaoh and leading the Israelites out
[1:08:22] of captivity Mary risked her marriage
[1:08:25] her reputation and her future by
[1:08:28] becoming the mother of Jesus Amen and we
[1:08:30] we realize that she was yielding to the
[1:08:32] prophecy of a virgin shall conceive amen
[1:08:36] and there is a lot on the line for Mary
[1:08:38] being a man a uh engaged woman and
[1:08:41] having to go tell Joseph that she was
[1:08:43] pregnant by an Angel this was real this
[1:08:45] was a great you know step of Faith amen
[1:08:48] let's put it that way but it says this
[1:08:50] following God's will is not without risk
[1:08:54] the only thing more risky than trusting
[1:08:57] God
[1:08:59] is not trusting him
[1:09:01] I want you to think about that the only
[1:09:03] thing more risky than than trusting God
[1:09:06] is actually not trusting him
[1:09:09] the next when Amen on January 15th uh I
[1:09:13] go and I pick it up again and it has it
[1:09:16] says no great things happen without some
[1:09:21] risk
[1:09:23] no great things happen without some risk
[1:09:27] they say no arrest his his reputation by
[1:09:30] believing that God would flood the Earth
[1:09:32] as he as he said he would Abraham left
[1:09:36] his home and Country to go where God
[1:09:39] sent him those who walk close to God
[1:09:41] have evidence based on their past
[1:09:44] experiences that God is real and active
[1:09:47] in the lives of those who love him God
[1:09:49] loves to accomplish The Impossible in
[1:09:52] the lives of his people take him up on
[1:09:55] it
[1:09:56] man I start reading this I say well my
[1:09:59] goodness God loves to accomplish amen
[1:10:03] The Impossible and the lives of his
[1:10:06] people but you have to be willing to
[1:10:09] take him up on it
[1:10:11] if I could just borrow these words you
[1:10:14] have to be willing to take the rest
[1:10:16] amen amen now I'm not going to leave you
[1:10:19] at risk because I do believe that
[1:10:21] Christians operate at a different level
[1:10:23] than that risk level we'll get there in
[1:10:25] a little bit
[1:10:26] bear with me the next day January 16th
[1:10:30] amen that says this you should be ready
[1:10:33] to risk resources
[1:10:37] reputation and even some relationships
[1:10:40] in order to be faithful to God
[1:10:44] Joshua and Caleb unlike the other spies
[1:10:47] were willing to risk everything because
[1:10:49] they trusted God's promises more than
[1:10:52] their human fears God had already
[1:10:55] promised the Israelites the land all
[1:10:58] they had to do was take it
[1:11:01] amen amen hallelujah
[1:11:04] God had made many promises in his word
[1:11:07] for his people will you take the risk of
[1:11:10] moving ahead and claiming them or will
[1:11:13] you lose heart and miss the blessing God
[1:11:15] has in store
[1:11:17] for you
[1:11:20] I I I I I I I I I was pondering it you
[1:11:23] know as I was you know just just real I
[1:11:26] said man this is really something here
[1:11:28] you know just reading that and I said
[1:11:30] you know I Lord just kind of start
[1:11:31] dealing my heart and I just just kind of
[1:11:33] put some things together what this word
[1:11:35] risk means and I'm giving you multiple
[1:11:37] definitions but uh the first definition
[1:11:39] is to expose
[1:11:41] uh to Danger harm or loss a risk is to
[1:11:47] expose to uh uh to Danger harm or loss
[1:11:50] and they have different phrases that
[1:11:53] they they use the word risk and they say
[1:11:55] something is at risk that means it's
[1:11:58] exposed to harm or danger they'll also
[1:12:01] use something like
[1:14:10] it's not seen amen and for for by it by
[1:14:14] what by by Faith by it amen the elders
[1:14:18] obtained a good report Oh Glory to God
[1:14:21] through faith we understand that the
[1:14:24] worlds were framed by the word of God so
[1:14:26] that things which are seen were not made
[1:14:28] of things which do appear it goes on to
[1:14:31] say this in verse 4 by faith Abel
[1:14:35] offered unto God a more excellent
[1:14:37] sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained
[1:14:40] witness that he was righteous God
[1:14:42] testifying of his gifts and by it he by
[1:14:45] he being dead yet speaketh amen he says
[1:14:48] by faith Enoch was translated that he
[1:14:51] should not see death and was not found
[1:14:53] because God had translated him for
[1:14:55] before his translation he had this
[1:14:57] testimony that he pleased God Amen look
[1:15:01] at this verse 6 says this but without
[1:15:03] faith come on somebody amen it is
[1:15:07] impossible Amen to please him for he
[1:15:10] that cometh to God must believe that he
[1:15:12] is and that he is a rewarder of them
[1:15:15] that diligently seek him
[1:15:18] faith is a thing that moves God our
[1:15:22] faith in believing that he can do amen
[1:15:24] the supernatural for us amen I want to
[1:15:28] just uh catch a couple quotes here amen
[1:15:30] as we just kind of move on this first
[1:15:33] was coming out of the message a super
[1:15:35] sense I said you know when when the
[1:15:38] world looks at it it's a risk amen but
[1:15:41] as Christians we look at it it's a step
[1:15:43] of faith oh hallelujah it's a step of
[1:15:46] Faith amen and it take Faith to please
[1:15:49] God but here in the message of super
[1:15:51] sense brother random makes this
[1:15:53] statement and says and we are grateful
[1:15:55] to God that we have the five senses you
[1:16:00] know even when you're talking the term
[1:16:01] of risk sometimes that goes against your
[1:16:04] senses
[1:16:05] come on somebody amen I'm a re I don't
[1:16:09] know if I get to it today but I'm gonna
[1:16:10] get to it eventually but even uh when it
[1:16:13] comes to Investments right we make it we
[1:16:15] take a risk on the investment Hallelujah
[1:16:18] and sometimes it goes against your your
[1:16:20] senses amen but yet you're willing to
[1:16:22] kind of take a chance
[1:16:24] glory to God hallelujah and he and
[1:16:26] brother Brandon even give you advice
[1:16:28] that you should make investments
[1:16:31] glory to God Amen he said just put it in
[1:16:34] something solid though a company that
[1:16:36] can be trustworthy but you shouldn't
[1:16:38] make investments some and and everybody
[1:16:40] when they're making Investments
[1:16:42] everybody got different strategies some
[1:16:44] people want to make money right away
[1:16:46] amen they very aggressive with their
[1:16:48] strategy others are what we call
[1:16:50] moderates and others have little to no
[1:16:53] risks
[1:16:54] amen if they can make two percent that's
[1:16:57] fine they can put in a CD they'll put in
[1:17:00] a CD and be happy by making two percent
[1:17:03] I'm not one of them kind of people amen
[1:17:05] I want 20 I want 25 I want the most I
[1:17:09] can get out of my investment
[1:17:13] brother Brandon says that he says we are
[1:17:15] grateful to God that we have the five
[1:17:17] senses but by no means was these five
[1:17:20] senses given to you to guide you
[1:17:23] listen he says they were given to you
[1:17:26] for Earthly contact
[1:17:28] but there was given to giving you the
[1:17:30] sixth sense and that Sixth Sense is
[1:17:33] belongs only to the Christian
[1:17:36] let me just stop right there some people
[1:17:38] don't understand the decisions that you
[1:17:40] make because they have not been gifted
[1:17:43] with the sixth sense that you have
[1:17:48] see other people make their decisions on
[1:17:50] the five senses that the the seed The
[1:17:52] Taste the smell to hear you know they
[1:17:54] they make they make the uh the touch
[1:17:55] they they are they they make their
[1:17:58] decisions based on what they have but
[1:17:59] you got something extra and because
[1:18:01] you're a Christian God has given you
[1:18:03] that extra sense you make different
[1:18:05] decisions because you see different
[1:18:06] things
[1:18:09] I'm willing to take a step of faith
[1:18:12] I can trust my God
[1:18:15] Hallelujah says it only belongs belongs
[1:18:18] only to the Christian and you cannot
[1:18:21] have this sick since until you become a
[1:18:24] Christian
[1:18:25] it says it's the only way that you can
[1:18:28] ever have any more than the five natural
[1:18:30] senses for the natural person but the
[1:18:33] Sixth Sense is better known to the
[1:18:35] Christian as faith
[1:18:37] I like that it is the one that governs
[1:18:40] and guides you and is superior to all
[1:18:44] the other senses it's a superior to all
[1:18:47] of the senses the other five senses
[1:18:50] let's read faith is the substance
[1:18:53] glory to God
[1:18:56] I thank God that I got this this Sixth
[1:18:59] Sense
[1:19:00] and when I'm activating it I'm not
[1:19:03] taking a risk
[1:19:05] I'm actually just stepping out in faith
[1:19:09] hallelujah look at what the prophet says
[1:19:14] says uh and the message faith is the
[1:19:16] subject says all right now you see what
[1:19:19] faith is
[1:19:20] now look friends I know that all of you
[1:19:23] are at least know this this body is
[1:19:26] controlled by five senses is that right
[1:19:28] all right it's got five senses is
[1:19:30] everything that controls this human body
[1:19:32] now listen real close and give me your
[1:19:34] attention now these senses five senses
[1:19:37] is this right see taste feel smell here
[1:19:41] is that right then five senses control
[1:19:43] the entire human body it says is that
[1:19:47] true see taste spill smell and hear now
[1:19:51] there's none of them that declare faith
[1:19:55] none of them declare faith faith is the
[1:20:00] Sixth Sense known to some people as you
[1:20:03] want to as mental telepathy or whatever
[1:20:07] you want to call it see since he says
[1:20:09] whatever you want to call it I'ma call
[1:20:10] it risk
[1:20:13] that's what some people would call it's
[1:20:14] a risk no not for the Christian it's not
[1:20:16] a risk it's a step of faith
[1:20:21] and without faith it's impossible for me
[1:20:24] to please my God
[1:20:26] amen amen oh hallelujah amen whatever
[1:20:28] you want to call it many of them call it
[1:20:30] names but to me it's faith and that is
[1:20:34] that is in and above all five senses of
[1:20:37] the human body you see what I mean faith
[1:20:39] is the only direct and positive sense
[1:20:44] glory and it's the Sixth Sense faith is
[1:20:47] more than sight
[1:20:49] faith is more than feeling
[1:20:53] you do not feel Faith
[1:20:56] amen you don't taste faith you don't
[1:21:01] smell Faith come on Church you don't see
[1:21:05] faith but faith is the substance of
[1:21:09] things hoped for the Eminence of Things
[1:21:12] Not Seen
[1:21:13] it says here see this Bible now I want
[1:21:16] the Bible now I'm looking at it now I
[1:21:18] want it I mean you know just just just
[1:21:20] kind of uh imagine the prophet you know
[1:21:23] what he's saying here see this Bible say
[1:21:25] I want the Bible I'm looking at it I
[1:21:28] want it now Faith is a substance of
[1:21:29] things hoped for the evidence of things
[1:21:31] I do not see see what I mean it says now
[1:21:34] here in my pocket
[1:21:36] I think
[1:21:37] there's an old barley knife Barlow knife
[1:21:40] I've carried for years
[1:21:42] now I don't see that knife
[1:21:45] glory to God I do not feel that knife
[1:21:49] I do not taste that knife I do not smell
[1:21:54] that knife but I know that that knife is
[1:21:58] in there how do you know because I
[1:22:00] believe it's in there
[1:22:03] watch this now if it's not in there
[1:22:09] if it's not in there what you see won't
[1:22:13] put it in there
[1:22:14] what you feel won't put it in there what
[1:22:18] you hear won't put it in there what you
[1:22:21] tapes will not put it in there amen but
[1:22:23] your faith will put it in there if it's
[1:22:27] not there
[1:22:32] brother random say that chokes you
[1:22:37] that chokes you but that's true he says
[1:22:40] if you believe all things are possible
[1:22:42] you afraid to take God friends you're
[1:22:45] scared
[1:22:46] now I might have left that knife laying
[1:22:49] on the dresser where I changed clothes a
[1:22:52] while ago but just as sure if that knife
[1:22:55] is on the dresser right now if I believe
[1:23:00] if I believe with all believing with all
[1:23:03] my heart it'll be in my pocket
[1:23:07] how does it get from the dresser to my
[1:23:09] parking faith

[1:23:23] could do when you activate your faith
[1:23:27] come on somebody you got the most
[1:23:30] powerful thing you can have in your
[1:23:32] perception faith in the almighty God

[1:23:43] chokes you but God is able to put it
[1:23:45] there if you believe it
[1:23:47] you know I was just kind of thinking on
[1:23:49] this because it just it just blesses me
[1:23:52] you know we we we're reading there in
[1:23:54] the scripture
[1:23:55] with with Peter
[1:23:58] you know and uh when you when you like I
[1:24:00] told you go back and you read the story
[1:24:02] right after they had uh fed these these
[1:24:05] these 5 000 people with two fish and
[1:24:07] five loaves of bread now you gotta you
[1:24:09] know if you go back and we don't have
[1:24:11] time to read it all but you go back and
[1:24:12] you just look at that that story the
[1:24:14] disciples were coming to Jesus and tell
[1:24:16] them saying now look you're gonna need
[1:24:18] to send the people away
[1:24:20] they uh it's getting late they don't
[1:24:23] have nothing to eat the Shop's gonna be
[1:24:25] closed by the time they get there so you
[1:24:27] have to cut your sermon short Jesus and
[1:24:29] send the people away and Jesus Jesus
[1:24:32] already knew what he was getting ready
[1:24:33] to do can I tell you that amen uh just
[1:24:36] encourage you whatever you're going
[1:24:38] through right now the Lord already knows
[1:24:40] what he's gonna do
[1:24:41] and in his mind it's already done we
[1:24:45] just trying to figure it out right but
[1:24:47] but Jesus already knew what he was going
[1:24:49] to get ready so he just kept preaching
[1:24:50] he kept preaching and the disciples
[1:24:53] maybe if I can just imagine Peter being
[1:24:55] the one like Jesus we we told you to
[1:24:57] send these people away Jesus said now go
[1:24:59] out and find what we got out there what
[1:25:01] kind of what food we got say now Jesus
[1:25:03] ain't no shops opening you know he said
[1:25:05] just go find what we got they come back
[1:25:07] from you know 5 000 people in the camp
[1:25:11] five thousand and and I love to just put
[1:25:14] it this way because they went to one
[1:25:15] person say you got anything that you can
[1:25:17] share that we can feed the people with I
[1:25:19] ain't got nothing
[1:25:20] went to the next one you got anything we
[1:25:22] can share we can see to be with I ain't
[1:25:24] got nothing
[1:25:25] went to the next one you got anything we
[1:25:27] can you can share we can feed the people
[1:25:29] with I ain't got nothing now every time
[1:25:31] they hurt I ain't got nothing they got
[1:25:33] more and more discouraged
[1:25:35] Hallelujah and here's the here's the sad
[1:25:37] part they went through four thousand
[1:25:40] nine hundred 99 people and found nothing
[1:25:46] nobody had nothing but there was a
[1:25:49] little boy
[1:25:50] say well you know what I did bring my
[1:25:53] lunch I got two fish and five loaves of
[1:25:56] bread said well he told us to ask so if
[1:25:58] that's all you got we'll take that back
[1:26:00] to him and he'll compete I can it's just
[1:26:02] in my imagination Jesus you told us to
[1:26:06] go through all these people guess
[1:26:07] without a 5 000 people only one person
[1:26:10] has something that we can work with
[1:26:12] only one and you want to know what he
[1:26:14] got two fish
[1:26:17] and five loaves of bread Jesus did not
[1:26:20] tell you that you should have sent the
[1:26:21] people home earlier Jesus why did you do
[1:26:24] it like this say Peter just relaxed calm
[1:26:26] down give me the two fish in the five
[1:26:27] loaves of bread and they took the two
[1:26:30] fish and the five loaves of bread and
[1:26:32] then he broke it he blessed it he broke
[1:26:35] it and then he said now you give it out
[1:26:36] to the people
[1:26:38] and as they begin to give it up to the
[1:26:40] people praise God they take one fish out
[1:26:44] of the basket and one loaf of bread and
[1:26:46] give it here and they look back in the
[1:26:48] basket it was another fish and some
[1:26:51] bread and Not only was it fish it was
[1:26:53] cooked fish
[1:26:54] it all and it bypass processes
[1:27:00] hey we serve them we serve a God that's
[1:27:02] concerned about every need he wants
[1:27:05] serving raw fish it was cooked fish
[1:27:08] and I can imagine the disciples saying
[1:27:10] you wanted baked or you want to boil
[1:27:12] what kind of fish you want because we
[1:27:15] got it right here every time they
[1:27:18] reached in there was something there
[1:27:20] amen amen
[1:27:23] but they had to take a step of faith and
[1:27:26] just follow what Jesus was telling them
[1:27:29] and after this great miracle
[1:27:31] powerful miracle
[1:27:33] Jesus finally tells him now y'all y'all
[1:27:36] y'all go on
[1:27:37] get in the ship
[1:27:39] I'll get the people out I'll get them
[1:27:41] back to their place but y'all going and
[1:27:43] getting the ship and the Bible say he
[1:27:44] constrained them just imagine what he
[1:27:46] was going through to get them fellas in
[1:27:48] the ship and imagine maybe they said no
[1:27:49] no we ain't going nowhere we just saw
[1:27:52] them fishing in bread we ain't going
[1:27:54] nowhere we gonna stay right here and
[1:27:56] watch for the next Miracle but they
[1:27:58] didn't realize where the next Miracle is
[1:27:59] going to be happening
[1:28:01] amen Jesus is already a couple steps
[1:28:04] ahead he knew what the next miracle was
[1:28:08] but in order for you to see the next
[1:28:10] Miracle you got to be in the right place
[1:28:12] at the right time
[1:28:15] amen go get him the boat fellas go get
[1:28:18] in the boat go get in the boat
[1:28:19] oh all right Jesus can you handle it you
[1:28:22] can handle all them as 5 000 of them now
[1:28:24] can you I got them I got him go go get
[1:28:26] in the boat go get in the boat all right
[1:28:29] they're sitting there in that building
[1:28:31] and they just they just you know just
[1:28:33] probably rejoicing over you know the uh
[1:28:36] the miracle that just happened and all
[1:28:39] of them would partake us of that Miracle
[1:28:40] they all were giving out Fish and Loaves
[1:28:43] everybody had some Jesus told them to
[1:28:45] give it out to the people so all the
[1:28:47] disciples were partaking in this miracle
[1:28:50] now they're on the boat just maybe
[1:28:51] having a testimony service
[1:28:53] and you know sometimes things can be
[1:28:55] happening you can be talking about the
[1:28:58] Lord and you don't even realize the
[1:28:59] dangers that's around you
[1:29:01] amen the devil don't like King your
[1:29:03] conversation so that's why he surrounds
[1:29:04] you with danger but here they are on the
[1:29:06] boat and a storm just presents itself
[1:29:08] out of nowhere
[1:29:09] and I just love the way the Bible uh
[1:29:11] reads because Jesus knew that that storm
[1:29:13] would be there
[1:29:14] and in here you know as we read and
[1:29:16] let's go back and just kind of pick it
[1:29:18] up here in Scripture
[1:29:20] amen back in uh uh Matthew 15.
[1:29:25] verse 24 it says but the ship was now in
[1:29:29] the midst of the sea
[1:29:31] toss with waves for the wind was
[1:29:34] contrary
[1:29:36] a man and in the Fourth Watch of the
[1:29:38] night Jesus went unto them walking on
[1:29:41] the sea
[1:29:42] my God and when the disciples saw him
[1:29:45] walking on the sea they were troubled
[1:29:48] now here's here's the thing that I get
[1:29:50] then I I here's the thing that just kind
[1:29:52] of gets me when I read this they weren't
[1:29:54] troubled at the uh at the sea in the
[1:29:57] conditions of the sea but they were
[1:29:59] troubled by Jesus coming to walk to them
[1:30:02] Hallelujah somebody glory to God Amen
[1:30:05] they were in trouble by the conditions
[1:30:07] they were men of the sea so they
[1:30:08] understood that and they knew they could
[1:30:10] probably work work through that but what
[1:30:11] they got troubled by is when Jesus came
[1:30:13] walking to them Lisa is saying it is a
[1:30:15] spirit that cried out for fear can you
[1:30:18] see these men on the boat crying out
[1:30:20] because Jesus is walking to him look he
[1:30:22] says but straightway Jesus spoke unto
[1:30:25] them saying be of good cheer in his eyes
[1:30:28] be not afraid I think right when they
[1:30:30] heard them words that just dropped
[1:30:31] everything that dropped that level of
[1:30:33] fear once they heard from the word of
[1:30:34] God it drops the level of fear anytime
[1:30:37] you hear from the word of God it will
[1:30:39] drop your level of fear
[1:30:44] and I just love this next statement
[1:30:47] Peter answered
[1:30:49] and say Lord if it be thou bid me come
[1:30:52] unto thee on the water
[1:30:54] and he said come
[1:30:55] now now let's let's just get on the
[1:30:58] scene and imagine what is going on here
[1:31:00] amen Peter actually thought he was going
[1:31:03] to challenge Jesus
[1:31:05] Peter says if it really be you because I
[1:31:08] think this is a spirit but if it be you
[1:31:10] then speak back to me and tell me to
[1:31:11] come out there Oh Glory to God now now
[1:31:15] when we use the term risk this is a
[1:31:17] risky move
[1:31:18] you know I heard my daughter recently
[1:31:20] say there's no way that I'm gonna jump
[1:31:23] I'm gonna jump out of a perfectly good
[1:31:26] airplane
[1:31:27] you know people go uh uh pair uh
[1:31:31] skydiving in there I think the parent
[1:31:32] Paris something
[1:31:34] Pierce that man said but it's a it's a
[1:31:37] I'm in a in a I got a parachute on my
[1:31:39] back I'm in a good airplane and I'm just
[1:31:41] gonna jump out of it she says no way I'm
[1:31:44] gonna jump out of a perfectly good
[1:31:46] airplane
[1:31:47] now if the airplane going down that's
[1:31:49] another story I might jump out I'm gonna
[1:31:51] take that risk but if the airplane is in
[1:31:54] good shape ain't nothing wrong with it
[1:31:57] I'm not getting out the plane
[1:32:00] parachute or no parachute I'm not taking
[1:32:03] that risk
[1:32:04] same thing about Peter this is a
[1:32:06] perfectly good boat
[1:32:08] I know that there's a storm out here but
[1:32:10] it's still a good boat we ain't taking
[1:32:12] no damage yet and you invite me to get
[1:32:14] out of this good boat to come walking on
[1:32:17] the sea but the problem is Peter you put
[1:32:19] out a challenge
[1:32:20] [Applause]
[1:32:23] it came out of your mouth Peter you the
[1:32:26] one said if it be you then bid me come
[1:32:30] and Jesus ain't gonna explain it
[1:32:33] Jesus ain't gonna give no paragraphs he
[1:32:37] ain't gonna give no sentences he can't
[1:32:39] even show you what somebody did this
[1:32:41] before you
[1:32:44] this is the very first time this has
[1:32:46] ever happened
[1:32:48] oh my and I I like this because as I was
[1:32:51] pondering this and thinking on it you
[1:32:53] know Jesus could have told Peter no
[1:32:55] Peter you can't come this ain't for you
[1:32:57] you weren't born like I was born I was a
[1:33:00] virgin boy Son of God Amen and see I got
[1:33:02] I got a I'm God Almighty In the Flesh
[1:33:05] and you know I realize I got control
[1:33:07] over this so Peter you can't do that
[1:33:09] that's not what Jesus said
[1:33:12] Jesus said come there is an invitation
[1:33:16] for you to experience the supernatural
[1:33:21] Peter Peter took a great risk but there
[1:33:24] was great reward because Peter is the
[1:33:26] only man That Ever Walked the water just
[1:33:30] like Jesus did never was recorded before
[1:33:33] and never was recorded after
[1:33:36] there was great reward because he was
[1:33:38] able to take a step of faith
[1:33:41] but when you read the scripture
[1:33:44] the Bible says he said come
[1:33:47] and notice the very next thing and when
[1:33:49] Peter was come down
[1:33:51] how long do you think it took Peter
[1:33:54] to get down out the boat
[1:33:57] for me I don't think Peter just just
[1:33:59] jumped out that boat
[1:34:01] I think Peter's really thinking about it
[1:34:04] now wait a minute I know I see him and
[1:34:06] he and now he just invited me to come I
[1:34:08] told him if it was him then beat me
[1:34:10] coming he just invited me to come like
[1:34:12] oh
[1:34:14] come
[1:34:15] say it again Jesus
[1:34:19] say it like you mean to Jesus
[1:34:22] say with some authority Jesus please I
[1:34:25] can't do this
[1:34:27] come
[1:34:30] and I can see Peter just working maybe
[1:34:33] working to get off one side of the boat
[1:34:35] maybe and ain't like oh Lord ain't no
[1:34:38] way I'm gonna be oh this is this is I'm
[1:34:40] not I'm impossible unheard of no way I
[1:34:44] know about the fishing lows I fed them
[1:34:45] yes I did do that but now I walk on
[1:34:48] water
[1:34:49] come
[1:34:53] and I can see Peter just taking his time
[1:34:55] getting out that boat because I I think
[1:34:58] Peter's a little bit like me and I'd be
[1:35:00] a little afraid to jump out a perfectly
[1:35:02] good boat
[1:35:03] and try to I be reasoning all in my mind
[1:35:06] see Jesus you can do that because you
[1:35:07] Jesus but you talk about me I'm a
[1:35:10] failure I'm this I'm that ain't no way
[1:35:12] the water gonna hold me like that come
[1:35:15] oh I don't want to hear your excuses
[1:35:19] I don't hear you're failures I don't
[1:35:21] want to hear none of that come
[1:35:25] I can see Peter just just oh maybe
[1:35:28] looking at the boys he told you to come
[1:35:30] Peter you asked you got it Peter go not
[1:35:33] there
[1:35:34] don't push me don't push me don't push
[1:35:36] me
[1:35:40] and I can see Peter take a a just a
[1:35:42] small step of Faith he put one foot on
[1:35:45] the water one foot in the boat and he
[1:35:48] kept this one in the boat because he's
[1:35:49] like hey if this don't work I got
[1:35:51] something to hold on to but then he put
[1:35:53] a little weight in the water Brothers
[1:35:57] Brothers is just as strong on the water
[1:35:59] as it is in the boat
[1:36:04] Brothers I I ain't never felt nothing
[1:36:06] like this but since he bit me to come
[1:36:09] I'm coming Peter got out there begin to
[1:36:12] walk on water but the Bible say he began
[1:36:15] to look at the winds you weren't looking
[1:36:17] at that before why are you gonna look at
[1:36:19] that now you already walking you might
[1:36:21] as well keep on walking
[1:36:23] guess what
[1:36:25] you already done took a step of Faith
[1:36:28] just keep walking by faith not by sight
[1:36:32] [Applause]
[1:36:34] man Peter was walking
[1:36:36] next thing they saw them boisterous wins
[1:36:38] and he's saying you know what
[1:36:40] this is impossible
[1:36:42] this is impossible and I just love the
[1:36:45] way the scripture let's let's says but
[1:36:46] when he saw divorces wins he was afraid
[1:36:48] to begin seeking he cried Lord save me
[1:36:50] this is the thing that I really like
[1:36:52] about it just I just you know it's a
[1:36:54] it's a story that we we've heard many
[1:36:56] times amen but it's just so refreshing
[1:36:59] different different seasons of your life
[1:37:00] you know I was just saying to say uh
[1:37:02] even though Peter fell
[1:37:06] he walked
[1:37:09] and all another thing in that is that he
[1:37:12] was walking with the right person
[1:37:14] [Applause]
[1:37:16] because Jesus was still there that when
[1:37:18] he cried out for salvation Lord save me
[1:37:21] he had somebody that could lift him up
[1:37:24] even in his Fallen condition he had
[1:37:26] somebody can lift him up he was already
[1:37:28] there he knew that Peter was going to
[1:37:30] walk he knew that Peter was going to
[1:37:32] fall he knew that he has to lift Peter
[1:37:33] up but you can't take Peter's testimony
[1:37:36] from him he walked on water
[1:37:39] hey man
[1:37:42] and the reason Peter could do that is
[1:37:44] because he was willing
[1:37:47] to take a risk
[1:37:49] and I like to use this where he was
[1:37:51] willing to step out on faith
[1:37:54] and I set my time a little shorter today
[1:38:00] and I want to just share 10 things with
[1:38:02] you and I'ma leave and I'll come back
[1:38:03] and pick this up
[1:38:06] but there's I was reading you know that
[1:38:09] that that uh the these devotions on risk
[1:38:12] and it just kind of led me I was
[1:38:14] thinking about Peter I got a lot of
[1:38:16] other people in Scripture that I can
[1:38:17] talk about but uh for time's sake I'm
[1:38:19] not going to do it today
[1:38:21] but um it took me I went and and just
[1:38:24] kind of did a quick search on uh on
[1:38:28] wrists and um 10 inspiring quotes about
[1:38:31] the rewards of taking risks and these
[1:38:34] are business people that say this and I
[1:38:35] just want to just give you this the
[1:38:37] first one came from Martin Luther King
[1:38:38] Jr
[1:38:40] he said take the first step in faith
[1:38:43] you don't have to see the whole
[1:38:44] staircase
[1:38:45] just take the first step
[1:38:49] the next one comes from Sarah Parish
[1:38:53] she says living with fear stops us from
[1:38:55] taking risks
[1:38:57] and if you don't go out on the branch
[1:38:59] you're never going to get the best fruit
[1:39:06] next one comes from Paula uh
[1:39:10] Coelho says pitiful is the person who's
[1:39:13] afraid of taking risks perhaps this
[1:39:16] person will never be disappointed
[1:39:18] or this a disillusion perhaps she won't
[1:39:23] suffer the way people do do when they
[1:39:25] have a dream to follow
[1:39:27] but when the person looks back
[1:39:30] she will hear her heart
[1:39:33] I like that right I mean you know when
[1:39:36] you know when you're afraid to take a
[1:39:37] risk you know you probably never
[1:39:38] experience any disappointments because
[1:39:40] life will always stay the same you'll
[1:39:42] never be disillusioned
[1:39:43] yeah you'll never you'll never
[1:39:45] experience any of those highs and lows
[1:39:46] but but but but but but when you are
[1:39:49] willing to take that risk you'll look
[1:39:50] back and you'll realize I gave
[1:39:51] everything I had
[1:39:54] the next one says 20 years from now
[1:39:58] you would be more disappointed by the
[1:40:00] things you didn't do
[1:40:03] no matter ones you did
[1:40:06] so throw off the bow lines sail away
[1:40:09] from the Safe Harbor catch the trade
[1:40:11] winds in your cells explore dream
[1:40:14] discover
[1:40:15] Mark Twain
[1:40:18] the number five number the fifth one
[1:40:20] comes from a person by the name of
[1:40:22] yvetta uh turn of the mark
[1:40:26] it says only those who play win
[1:40:30] only those who risk when
[1:40:33] history favors Risk Takers it forgets
[1:40:36] the tenant
[1:40:38] everything else is commentary
[1:40:41] and just think about the different ones
[1:40:43] in scripture you know I mean uh I I
[1:40:46] didn't I didn't tell you that John got
[1:40:48] out the boat
[1:40:49] I didn't tell you amen that that that uh
[1:40:52] uh Andrew got out the boat you know
[1:40:55] Thaddeus I I ain't tell you no no other
[1:40:58] disciple that got a Peter is the one
[1:41:01] that got out the boat because Peter was
[1:41:04] willing to take a step of faith
[1:41:07] that's true
[1:41:09] oh Jesus here the number six one says
[1:41:13] I always did something
[1:41:16] I was little
[1:41:18] not ready to do
[1:41:21] I was a little not ready to do I think
[1:41:24] that's how you grow when there's that
[1:41:26] moment of wow I'm really not sure I can
[1:41:30] do this and you push through those
[1:41:33] moments that's when you have a
[1:41:35] breakthrough
[1:41:38] you I mean you ain't got nothing else
[1:41:40] but I all I can do is go full for it
[1:41:43] that's when you have a breakthrough
[1:41:46] and I I always I make this statement say
[1:41:48] when you get to a point of a
[1:41:50] breakthrough you can have two it's one
[1:41:51] of two breaks either break through or
[1:41:53] break down
[1:41:55] I ain't breaking down for nothing I'm
[1:41:57] going through
[1:41:58] glory to God
[1:42:01] look at this number seven if you are not
[1:42:03] willing to risk the unusual
[1:42:07] you will have to settle for the ordinary
[1:42:12] from Jimmy Ron if you're not willing to
[1:42:14] risk the unusual you'll have to settle
[1:42:16] for the UN for the for the ordinary
[1:42:18] number eight
[1:42:20] the biggest risks
[1:42:23] is not taking any risk
[1:42:27] in a world that is changing really
[1:42:29] quickly the only strategy that is
[1:42:32] guaranteed to fail is not taking risks
[1:42:37] that's mark
[1:42:38] Zuckerberg
[1:42:41] it should have been a g I messed up on
[1:42:42] that one I'm sorry
[1:42:46] number nine do the thing you fear most
[1:42:50] and the death of fear is certain
[1:42:54] anybody want to kill fear
[1:42:58] fear you're no longer welcome here
[1:43:01] Papa's here
[1:43:03] praise God hey Mark Twain said that do
[1:43:05] the thing you feel the most and the
[1:43:07] death of fear is certain
[1:43:09] like I told you all one time people that
[1:43:11] were afraid of spiders one of the ways
[1:43:14] to overcome you know being afraid of a
[1:43:15] spider they said just run through a
[1:43:17] spider web
[1:43:18] run through it just run through it run
[1:43:21] through it run don't walk through it run
[1:43:23] through it
[1:43:24] run through it
[1:43:26] you break that fear
[1:43:28] glory to God glory to God here the last
[1:43:31] one
[1:43:32] create a risk taken is essential to
[1:43:35] success
[1:43:37] in any goal where the stakes are high
[1:43:39] faultless risks also are destructive of
[1:43:42] course but perhaps even more wasteful is
[1:43:45] thoughtless caution
[1:43:48] which prompts inaction
[1:43:50] and promotes failure to seize
[1:43:52] opportunity
[1:43:54] Gary Ryan Blair
[1:43:58] see it takes something to take a step of
[1:44:01] faith and and here's the thing we have a
[1:44:04] sense that others don't have and that's
[1:44:06] why I can I can go through the
[1:44:07] scriptures I mean I'll call out some
[1:44:10] amen amram and yoshibed amen David
[1:44:16] right uh when he faced Goliath I mean
[1:44:18] different ones uh that that's in the
[1:44:20] scripture so so many others that we can
[1:44:22] just kind of go down and and for they
[1:44:24] took a risk the Hebrew voice Daniel and
[1:44:27] the Lion's Den I mean all of these
[1:44:29] people took a risk at some point in time
[1:44:31] but the reason that they're recording
[1:44:32] scriptures because they was willing to
[1:44:34] take that step of faith
[1:44:36] when I read
[1:44:40] Hebrews 11.
[1:44:43] sir
[1:44:44] and I see here in in the Bible it has
[1:44:47] all these different
[1:44:49] Risk Takers if I can if I can just call
[1:44:51] them that way amen if I can just calling
[1:44:54] away but but you know you you read There
[1:44:56] by faith

[1:47:27] and I'm going to tell you one thing
[1:47:29] everyone that we read here in Scripture
[1:47:30] that moved out by faith they were
[1:47:32] rewarded for their faith
[1:47:34] there's great rewards when we use our
[1:47:36] faith God bless your church
[1:47:39] [Applause]
[1:47:44] let's pray

[1:47:51] for your word we thank you for your
[1:47:53] truth
[1:47:55] God we can look at uh different ones in
[1:47:57] the scripture realize they weren't moved
[1:47:59] they weren't just moved by risk taking
[1:48:01] they had a sixth sense on the inside
[1:48:04] that caused them to ex to to accept the
[1:48:09] challenge that you would present
[1:48:11] Lord sometimes they were not able to
[1:48:13] read stories about other people that had
[1:48:16] done some of the things that they did
[1:48:18] but yet oh God uh they they took that
[1:48:21] step of faith and you produce great
[1:48:24] things
[1:48:25] Lord these are testimonies we can go
[1:48:27] back and read and get strength and
[1:48:29] encouragement we look at Peter stepping
[1:48:31] out of that boat mine Lord that was just
[1:48:34] something that that um had never been
[1:48:37] done before they had never seen it but
[1:48:38] when they saw you walking on Warden and
[1:48:40] I'm so glad that Peter he probably
[1:48:43] didn't even think about it but he said
[1:48:44] it before he could think he says if it
[1:48:46] be you then then bit me come he didn't
[1:48:48] realize what he said but he had to
[1:48:51] operate on come
[1:48:54] father we're operating on that today by
[1:48:57] faith we accept whatever you've placed
[1:48:59] before us
[1:49:00] and father we know that we'll be
