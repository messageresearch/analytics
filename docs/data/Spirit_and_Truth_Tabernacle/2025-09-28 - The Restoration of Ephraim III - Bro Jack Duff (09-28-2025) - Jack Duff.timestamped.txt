[35:18] &gt;&gt; now you have to catch him."
[35:21] &gt;&gt; If you don't catch him now, he can get
[35:23] away with it.
[35:25] &gt;&gt; But if you catch him, according to the
[35:27] scripture, the thief has to repay you
[35:31] &gt;&gt; double.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if I catch you stealing $1,
[35:36] you got to give back.

[35:44] all you got to do is catch them
[35:45] stealing.

[35:48] soul,
[35:52] &gt;&gt; then
[35:54] I'm supposed to get double.

[36:43] Take with you words, and turn to the
[36:47] Lord. Say unto him, Take away all
[36:50] iniquity and receive us graciously." So
[36:53] will we render the cows of our lips.
[36:58] Uh Asher shall not save us. Uh we will
[37:03] not ride upon horses. Neither will we
[37:05] say anymore to the work of our hands. Ye
[37:09] are our gods. For in thee the fatherless
[37:14] findeth mercy.
[37:16] I love this promise. I will heal
[37:20] their backsliding.
[37:23] I will love them freely
[37:25] for mine anger is turned away from him.
[37:30] Uh I will be as the dew and unto Israel.
[37:34] He shall grow as the lily and cast forth
[37:37] his roots as Lebanon. His branches shall
[37:40] spread and his beauty shall be as the
[37:43] olive tree and his smell as Lebanon.
[37:47] They that dwell under his shadow shall
[37:50] return. They shall revive as the corn
[37:53] and grow as the vine. The scent thereof
[37:56] shall be as the wine of Lebanon. Ephraim
[38:01] shall say, "What have I to do anymore
[38:05] with idols? I have heard him and
[38:09] observed him. I am like a green fur
[38:12] tree. From me is thy fruit found." Uh
[38:16] who is wise? and he shall understand
[38:19] these things prudent, and he shall know
[38:22] them, for the ways of the Lord are
[38:24] right, and the just shall walk in them,
[38:27] but the transgressors shall fall
[38:30] therein.
[38:32] Let us have a word of prayer
[38:36] um over this. Father, we thank you for
[38:39] your word that has been read. Uh but
[38:44] God, it takes the Holy Spirit to help us
[38:47] to apply what we've read to where we are
[38:50] right now. And I trust Lord Jesus that
[38:53] you would speak to every heart uh
[38:55] through uh the word. Take control over
[38:59] every thought that is being presented.
[39:01] Take control over every thought that is
[39:03] being received. And Father, we ask that
[39:06] you would just come and have your way,
[39:08] Father, in this portion of the service.
[39:10] Thank you for everything that has
[39:11] happened thus far and uh just asking God
[39:15] that you would uh you would speak to us
[39:18] now in Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can be seated in the presence
[39:24] of the Lord. Uh again we are taking our
[39:30] journey uh through this subject the
[39:33] restoration
[39:35] of Ephraim. Amen. And um as I mentioned
[39:41] um we were last time we were together we
[39:45] were just talking about just the history
[39:48] of Ephraim. Uh Ephraim is and when we're
[39:51] talking about the restoration we're not
[39:52] talking about just an individual. We're
[39:55] actually talking about uh a group of
[39:57] people a tribe if we can put it that
[40:00] way. uh because Ephraim his roots come.
[40:03] He was one of the sons of Joseph that
[40:06] was born uh in Egypt and um you know
[40:09] there Joseph was placed there by uh a
[40:13] dream that God had given him years
[40:15] before and he ends up down there um and
[40:19] the way he got there just it wasn't uh
[40:22] pleasant but God turned it for his good
[40:27] and uh and he got into a situation where
[40:29] he became second in charge in the
[40:31] country. uh his family was restored to
[40:34] him. His daddy, you know, uh when he saw
[40:38] Joseph's sons, he wanted to bless those
[40:40] boys. And when he blessed them, he
[40:43] crossed his hands in the blessing. And
[40:46] when he crossed his hands, uh Ephraim
[40:49] was the younger son. And the blessing
[40:51] actually went to the youngest son. And
[40:54] Joseph was trying to stop his daddy from
[40:55] doing this. Like, no, you're not
[40:56] supposed to do that, daddy's like, "No,
[40:58] no, no. God has crossed my hands, right?
[41:02] And I believe brother Mark had uh told
[41:04] me, you know, he says, you know, when
[41:06] you think about that, uh even I think it
[41:09] was Jacob and Esau coming out the womb,
[41:13] right? And Jacob was the younger son,
[41:16] right? and uh and and and and and when
[41:19] um uh Jacob Jacob actually stole the
[41:23] blessing and the birthright and
[41:24] everything from his brother, but God had
[41:26] allowed all that to happen, right? God
[41:28] had told his his mother that that he was
[41:31] supposed to be blessed. So, you start
[41:32] seeing these things just kind of flowing
[41:34] down, you know, and from generation to
[41:36] generation, these blessings and and no
[41:38] matter what your position is, you're
[41:40] still going to get a blessing.
[41:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah to the lamb of God. Amen. But
[41:46] but but we see the history of Ephraim
[41:49] and and then we get down here to the
[41:51] book of Hosea and uh this tribe of
[41:54] Ephraim has found themselves in a very
[41:59] um uh I want to call a separated place
[42:02] from God. They're so bad off that God
[42:05] makes a statement uh over in Hosea 4. Uh
[42:09] and I let me just get the slide here on
[42:12] this one. Uh let's see here.
[42:16] Oh my. Yeah. Uh the slide is slide five.
[42:20] He makes this statement here. It says uh
[42:23] for Israel slideth back as a backsliding
[42:26] heer.
[42:28] Now the Lord will feed them as a lamb in
[42:31] a large place. And then he says Ephraim
[42:34] is joined to idols. Let him alone. And I
[42:38] and I that those those that statement is
[42:40] so strong to me that God get to a spot
[42:43] where I don't want anything to do with
[42:45] you because of all the idols that you're
[42:47] worshiping. Right? I I just don't want
[42:50] anything to do with you anymore. But but
[42:52] here, you know, we know that God is a
[42:54] God that's gracious. Uh God is a God
[42:57] that is forgiving. God is a God of love.
[43:00] He don't like us to frustrate his grace.
[43:02] He don't enjoy that. Right? But but but
[43:05] but but uh but he is a God that
[43:08] actually, you know, he told us there in
[43:10] what we read in in Hosea 14, I'm going
[43:12] to heal your backsliding. Now, I know
[43:14] you backsliding and you separated from
[43:17] me. You join the idols and I really
[43:18] don't want nothing to do with you, but
[43:20] I'm going to heal your backsliding. It
[43:21] also goes to show that really it's not
[43:23] much we can do. We need we need God's
[43:26] grace. We need God's love. I I mean, if
[43:29] we didn't have that, we'd be finished,
[43:32] &gt;&gt; right? We we really need God more than
[43:34] than you more than you need anything
[43:36] else. You need God. Yes, sir. Amen.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; So, so we thank God for this promise
[43:41] that he's given. But as we go forward
[43:44] here today, um I want to slip over here
[43:48] to
[43:50] uh I think it's going to be slide
[43:53] uh 13. Let me just make sure. Nope. Let
[43:56] me um Yeah, I think I uh we we Yeah, we
[44:01] caught this. This is where we ended at
[44:03] uh on our last time. Slide slide 14.
[44:06] Slide 14. Slide 14. Okay.
[44:11] The verse there is uh Hosea 14:8.
[44:14] Ephraim shall say, "What have I to do
[44:16] anymore with idols? Uh I have heard him
[44:20] and observed him. I am like a green fur
[44:24] tree. From me is thy fruit found." and
[44:27] and and and what we find here in the
[44:29] Bible, uh the green fur tree or or the
[44:33] green tree often symbolizes life,
[44:37] vitality,
[44:38] uh and the enduring presence of God.
[44:41] It's a metaphor for resilience. And as I
[44:44] was telling you all, uh you know,
[44:46] sometimes you have to see yourself as a
[44:47] green fur tree. No matter what I'm going
[44:50] through, I'm a I'm a green fur tree.
[44:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm resilient.
[44:56] Give up ain't in me.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; Quit and going back ain't in me. Come
[45:02] on, somebody. And I'm gonna be
[45:05] established in the winter time. I'mma be
[45:07] established in the spring. I'mma be
[45:10] established in the fall. In the heat of
[45:12] the summer, I'mma still be in the same
[45:14] spot.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I I I mean, when I'm going
[45:18] through, you're going to find me in
[45:19] church. When I'm on the mountaintop,
[45:22] you're going to find me in church. When
[45:24] I'm in a valley, you're gonna find me in
[45:26] church. No matter what the situation is,
[45:28] I'm a green fur tree.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; It's a metaphor for for resilience,
[45:35] especially in the face of adversity and
[45:38] can represent hope, divine blessing, and
[45:41] I love this, and restoration. And and as
[45:44] we were saying, when you just look at
[45:45] the book of Hosea, just where it's
[45:47] placed in the scripture is just in front
[45:50] of the book of Joel. And we know the
[45:52] book of Joel is a book of restoration.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Here another uh statement
[45:59] here is that evergreen uh trees are
[46:02] characterized by their year round
[46:05] foliage meaning they retain their leaves
[46:07] or needles throughout all seasons. I
[46:11] love that. Don't never fall off no
[46:12] matter what's going on. Uh and a AI
[46:15] summary. Amen. In a Google search it
[46:18] said evergreens often symbolize
[46:20] immortality and eternal life because
[46:23] they return retain their leaves
[46:25] throughout the winter. And then the next
[46:27] thing it says it also symbolizes eternal
[46:30] life and the promise of ultimate
[46:34] restoration. Amen. In the scripture I I
[46:38] like that statement. I'm like a green
[46:40] fur tree because they're saying it
[46:42] symbolizes
[46:44] ultimate restoration. Now, now, now,
[46:47] now, and I know that um you know, we as
[46:49] I I brought this out the last time some
[46:51] of the brothers got together and we were
[46:52] talking about ultimate restoration and
[46:54] what that looks like and and and I think
[46:56] I think there's certainly a lot of
[46:58] angles that we can take on that. Uh one
[47:00] of the ones I believe Brother Solomon
[47:01] brought is is we as sons of God,
[47:04] ultimate restoration for us is to come
[47:06] back to that place that God had for us
[47:08] at the very beginning. Brother Brandham
[47:10] said God had a three-fold purpose. He
[47:12] wanted to reveal himself to his people.
[47:14] He he says also he wanted to have
[47:16] preeminence in the people. And then the
[47:18] third thing he wanted to restore them
[47:20] back to Eden conditions again. Certainly
[47:23] that's ultimate restoration for the
[47:25] believers to come back to eating
[47:27] conditions again. I I don't know about
[47:29] you but I like to exercise amen. My um
[47:33] my rights
[47:36] &gt;&gt; a a as as a son of God and as a daughter
[47:39] of God, we should exercise our rights
[47:42] sometime. And and and when we had prayer
[47:44] this week, one of the scripture that the
[47:46] Lord gave me for the brothers is, you
[47:48] know, if you say to the mountain,
[47:51] &gt;&gt; be thou removed
[47:53] &gt;&gt; and don't doubt in your heart,
[47:55] &gt;&gt; the Bible say you can have what you say.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; And and so when I'm exercising my
[48:01] authority as a son of God, I'm going to
[48:03] have to let some things come out my
[48:05] mouth.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; I I got to expect heaven to back up what
[48:10] I'm saying. Yes sir.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. But but but but we we we
[48:15] see something here that ultimate
[48:17] restoration is promised to Ephraim. And
[48:19] we want to look at this from the angle
[48:21] of Ephraim. What does ultimate
[48:24] restoration look like for Ephraim? Stay
[48:27] with me this morning. All right. Um
[48:33] this next slide gives another definition
[48:37] from Benson Bible commentary. They're
[48:39] they're commenting on this very verse of
[48:42] uh uh Hosea 14:8. And in there when we
[48:46] read it again, Ephraim should say, "What
[48:48] have I to do anymore with idols?
[48:51] I have heard him and observed him. I am
[48:54] like a green fur tree. From me is thy
[48:56] fruit found." Now, now this is just
[48:59] another angle that they're giving on
[49:01] this scripture. Amen. And they're
[49:03] they're saying it is I not his idols who
[49:06] have heard his petitions and watched
[49:09] over him to preserve him. So they're
[49:10] saying it's God that's that's watching
[49:12] over him and to preserve him. It says
[49:14] I'm like a green fur tree. If these be
[49:17] understood as the words of God, the
[49:21] meaning is it is I who am ever existing
[49:26] and have it in my power to give my
[49:29] people blessings at all times. Amen.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; I got power to give blessings at all
[49:36] times. Cuz if this is speaking of God,
[49:39] we know he's the same yesterday, today,
[49:42] and forever.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; That would be like a fruit tree.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; That that I I I'm telling you, sis,
[49:53] that's that's when when it's year round,
[49:55] it don't matter what season you are in
[49:57] life.
[49:59] You still going to get a blessing
[50:02] &gt;&gt; when things are going down. When the
[50:04] economy is down,
[50:07] [Music]
[50:08] &gt;&gt; but you belong to God. You still in line
[50:12] for a blessing.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; It It's not based on economy because
[50:17] he's a green fern tree.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:25] We we can see God and and just in
[50:28] nature.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; It says this. It is it is I who am ever
[50:32] existing
[50:33] &gt;&gt; and have it in my power to give my my
[50:36] people blessings at all times.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; As the fur is evergreen and flourishing
[50:42] and afford it shelter not only in the
[50:44] summer but in the winter too
[50:47] &gt;&gt; when all the rest of the trees are
[50:49] stripped of their leaves
[50:50] &gt;&gt; and can and can afford no shelter at
[50:53] all. In other words, as a weary traveler
[50:56] finds rest and safety under under a a
[50:59] green thick and flourishing tree, so
[51:02] there are safety and refreshment under
[51:05] the protection of Jehovah.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I believe that and I thank
[51:12] God for his divine protection.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; Just a little statement from the prophet
[51:17] in this message where I think Pentecost
[51:20] fell. He says, "Well, then over on this
[51:25] uh other side of the hill, there's a
[51:28] little tree standing there." Says, "I'll
[51:31] be leaning back under that tree,
[51:34] listening at them,
[51:37] listening at them singers singing over
[51:39] there." Glory to God. Glory to God.
[51:43] Uh I'll be I'll be leaning back under
[51:45] that tree, listening at them. You see,
[51:47] that's where you'll find
[51:50] uh it says, "Oh, if I if I could only
[51:53] sing." Now, now I think somebody had
[51:55] made a a mention of that. And I I I I
[51:58] know I they got a they got a a singing
[52:00] tape of Brother Brandham um just singing
[52:04] in prayer lines and you know nothing I
[52:06] praise God. I I I certainly appreciate
[52:08] but the prophet all he's told us
[52:11] &gt;&gt; that that is not his gift.
[52:15] said, "If I could only sing." That's
[52:17] what he said.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; He said, "I said there's one song
[52:23] &gt;&gt; that I always wanted to sing and love it
[52:25] so well, that's amazing grace."
[52:28] He said, "And I I never could sing." Oh
[52:30] my sist. So when you all get over home,
[52:34] a lot of you maybe if you happen to go
[52:36] before me
[52:38] &gt;&gt; and you're living in your great big fine
[52:41] place over there, I'mma be a
[52:45] a poor man
[52:48] &gt;&gt; with two houses
[52:50] &gt;&gt; on this side.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; He said when you if you're living in
[52:54] your great big fine place over there
[52:58] &gt;&gt; and you hear an echo
[53:00] &gt;&gt; coming across the hill somewhere, look
[53:02] over on the other side of the hill.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; You'll see my little hut down there
[53:07] somewhere
[53:09] &gt;&gt; among
[53:11] &gt;&gt; the
[53:12] &gt;&gt; evergreens.
[53:14] You'll see my little hut down there
[53:15] among the evergreens and I'm standing
[53:17] out on the front porch singing Amazing
[53:20] Grace. How sweet the sound. You say,
[53:23] "Well, praise God." Oh, Brother Brandham
[53:26] finally made it.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; So, I'll be over on the other side over
[53:29] there with amazing grace. We need God's
[53:33] grace. Ain't no way we gonna make it
[53:35] without his grace.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Brandon said he
[53:40] going to be on the other side underneath
[53:42] the shelter,
[53:44] the the the shade of the evergreens.
[53:48] See, this evergreen, there's something
[53:49] special about it. The way God designed
[53:51] this tree and made this tree, something
[53:53] special about it. But Ephraim identifies
[53:55] themselves, Amen, there with this this
[53:58] evergreen tree. Even though they've gone
[54:00] through this season of of idolatry, just
[54:04] just just I mean you you I I don't have
[54:07] a a better word to put, but some of the
[54:09] things they got themselves involved
[54:11] with, it was it's and and not only them,
[54:13] but some of the things we find ourselves
[54:15] getting involved with,
[54:17] &gt;&gt; it it's idolatry.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It It's idolatry. And and we
[54:22] got to be ever so careful uh cuz cuz you
[54:26] know, God is the one that wants the
[54:28] glory. God is the one that wants to
[54:29] honor. He He He designed us to be able
[54:32] to give him glory, right? But but some
[54:35] people make cars they idols.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you can make a house your
[54:39] idol.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; I mean there there's so many things we
[54:43] get involved with. Your job becomes your
[54:45] idol. More important than church.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; I mean so many things that people fail
[54:51] to fail to put God first in. We don't we
[54:54] never want to be guilty of any of those
[54:55] things.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[55:00] Again, this
[55:02] this uh
[55:05] Ephraim shall say, "What have I to do
[55:07] anymore with idols? I have heard him and
[55:10] observed him. I am like a green fur
[55:11] tree. From me is thy fruit found." And
[55:13] and and I pray that you would even see
[55:16] yourself. And it's like, you know,
[55:18] rather than just saying, "Ephraim shall
[55:19] say, Jack shall say,
[55:23] &gt;&gt; what have I to do anymore with idols?"
[55:26] God, I don't even want these things in
[55:28] my life anymore. Free me from this
[55:30] stuff.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; And the Bible even says that sometimes,
[55:33] you know, uh we have to lay aside every
[55:36] sin
[55:37] &gt;&gt; and every weight that so easily besets
[55:40] us.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; So some things in your life might not be
[55:42] sin,
[55:43] &gt;&gt; but it's a weight.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; It weighs you down.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; You got to get rid of the weight.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Here we go forward just looking at what
[55:57] this ultimate restoration looks like for
[56:00] Ephraim.
[56:04] Brother Random gives us something here
[56:06] in the Sardisian church age.
[56:10] It says in Genesis 35
[56:14] verse 23- 26,
[56:17] &gt;&gt; the sons of Jacobs
[56:18] &gt;&gt; were 12 in number and their names were
[56:21] as follows. Reuben,
[56:23] &gt;&gt; Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and
[56:28] Zebulon, Joseph and Benjamin, Dan and
[56:31] Napali, Gad and Asher. These 12 sons
[56:36] &gt;&gt; descendants become the 12 tribes of
[56:39] Israel with the exception that Joseph
[56:42] did not have a tribe named after him.
[56:46] It says uh for in the pro providence of
[56:49] God there were to be 13 tribes
[56:53] &gt;&gt; and Joseph's two sons were given the
[56:55] honor of bringing the 12 to 13.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; You know of course that this was
[57:01] necessary as Levi was separated unto God
[57:04] for the priesthood. Thus, when Israel
[57:06] left Egypt and God gave them the
[57:09] tabernacle in the wilderness, we find
[57:11] the tribe of Levi ministering to the 12
[57:13] tribes named Reuben, Simeon, Issachar,
[57:17] Judah, Zebulun, Benjamin, Dan, Napali,
[57:21] Gad, Asher, Ephraim, and Manasseh, the
[57:23] order of the host of them. Thus, amen.
[57:27] In Numbers 10 11-28, there is no mention
[57:30] of Joseph or Levi.
[57:34] We're studying how this ultimate
[57:37] restoration for Ephraim. Let us go
[57:39] forward.
[57:41] Now, brother Brandon just gave us the
[57:43] history. I'm just kind of reiterating
[57:44] what he said. The history of the 12
[57:46] tribes. He gave us Genesis 35 verse 23-
[57:50] 26. And this is really the birth order
[57:52] of the sons of Israel. Sons of Israel,
[57:54] sons of Jacob. Same person. His name was
[57:57] changed from Jacob to Israel after he
[57:59] wrestled with God. Amen. He got a name
[58:01] change. Some of us need to wrestle with
[58:03] God so we can get a nature change.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We need to have a wrestling
[58:11] match with God so our nature can be
[58:13] changed.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When when when Israel or
[58:16] Jacob wrestled with God, his walk
[58:18] changed.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; His testimony changed after he had an
[58:21] encounter with God. And and what we need
[58:23] is a Holy Ghost encounter.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; It changes everything about us.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Like I I mentioned a
[58:31] few weeks ago, we don't want church just
[58:33] to become a sound,
[58:34] &gt;&gt; right?
[58:35] &gt;&gt; People people can go to church and they
[58:37] hear the music just uh revved up and and
[58:39] the musicians playing a certain thing
[58:41] and they feel like when they hit that we
[58:43] had church, but they go out living the
[58:45] same old ungodly life
[58:47] &gt;&gt; after they've had that experience.
[58:49] Church has simply become a sound to
[58:51] people. Amen.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; Church should be an experience
[58:56] &gt;&gt; where you experience God. You hear his
[58:58] word. Something that purges you from the
[59:00] inside.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; Brother Random brought out Genesis 35
[59:05] 23-26. This birth order of the 12 tribes
[59:09] of Israel and or the sons, I should say,
[59:12] the sons of Israel. Reuben, Simeon,
[59:14] Levi, Judah, Issachar, Zebulun, Joseph,
[59:19] Benjamin, Dan, Napali, Gad, Asher, these
[59:22] 12 sons of uh of Israel. But then he
[59:25] also brought to us in numbers 10 uh
[59:28] 11-28. This is the Exodus. And in in the
[59:32] Exodus uh we see the the tribes in this
[59:35] order. Judah, Issachar, Zebulun, Reuben,
[59:40] Simeon, Gad, Ephraim, Manasseh. All
[59:44] right. Uh, Ephraim, Manasseh, Benjamin,
[59:48] Dan, Asher, Napalia. What we see from uh
[59:52] the first list is we see no Joseph and
[59:54] no Levi. They were in the first list,
[59:56] but here in Numbers, as they're going
[59:58] out leaving, Amen. Mount Si and and and
[1:00:02] when they're moving, Amen. And when
[1:00:03] they're moving from Mount Si, this is
[1:00:04] the story of them moving with the cloud.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and I love because in the
[1:00:13] wilderness journey, you you you had to
[1:00:15] know where God was.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; You had to know where God was.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. If if if they were at a certain
[1:00:25] mountain this day, but they could see
[1:00:27] God lift up the cloud of glory lift up
[1:00:30] and begin to move in another direction,
[1:00:32] you couldn't stay where you were and
[1:00:35] expect to experience God.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; No. God had moved on from there.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, can I go a little further?
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; God has moved on from denominations.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Even though people go
[1:00:50] back and they they say, "I felt
[1:00:51] something." You might feel a little bit,
[1:00:53] but you'll never have the fullness of
[1:00:55] God in a denomination.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God is trying to get you out
[1:01:00] of there. You got to be able to
[1:01:02] recognize when God moves, you have to
[1:01:05] move.
[1:01:06] [Music]
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; Children of Israel learned this this
[1:01:10] this this this process is that when God
[1:01:13] will lift up and begin to move, they
[1:01:15] packed up everything they had.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; And they begin to move with that cloud.
[1:01:19] And whenever the cloud would settle,
[1:01:21] that's where they would settle. And no,
[1:01:23] how no matter how long, it could be a
[1:01:24] month, it could be uh h five years, it
[1:01:29] could be five days, but when that cloud
[1:01:31] move, they move.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Somebody need to understand when it's
[1:01:35] time to move with the cloud.
[1:01:37] [Music]
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. People just don't have
[1:01:40] that no no that that understanding
[1:01:42] anymore. You know, when the cloud moves,
[1:01:45] you move.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:49] But we have that who move my cheese
[1:01:52] mentality.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; We think the glory going to come back,
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; but God has moved on
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; and you better move with the cloud.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; So here when they're coming and they're
[1:02:05] moving. Amen. And uh in the Exodus we
[1:02:07] see Judah, Issachar, Zebulun, Reuben,
[1:02:10] Simeon, Gat, Ephraim, Manasseh,
[1:02:12] Benjamin, Dan, Ash, Nefali. But no
[1:02:15] Joseph or Levi is mentioned here uh as
[1:02:18] in the tribal order. No Joseph or Levi.
[1:02:20] And brother Brandham just told us that
[1:02:22] it was God's providence that he would
[1:02:24] have 13 tribes. And then what happened
[1:02:27] with Levvis? They begin to be the
[1:02:28] servants or they they serve the other
[1:02:31] tribes through the offerings and things
[1:02:32] like that. Hallelujah. That's what
[1:02:34] happens with a a minister. When he's
[1:02:37] called to uh h to be a minister, he's
[1:02:41] called actually to be a servant. Let me
[1:02:44] say that again. When a man feels a
[1:02:46] calling to the ministry, hallelujah, I I
[1:02:49] remember uh brother Eve told me this
[1:02:51] years ago, God rest his soul. When I got
[1:02:54] called to the ministry, say, "Brother
[1:02:55] God, just make you a greater servant." I
[1:02:58] say, "Praise the Lord." And sometime we
[1:03:00] get we get called to minister, we think
[1:03:02] we got some type of position over the
[1:03:03] people. No, it's not a position over the
[1:03:06] people. Hallelujah. It's you become a
[1:03:08] more of a servant to the people.
[1:03:11] God can actually trust you to serve his
[1:03:15] people.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; And in any situation that they find
[1:03:20] themselves in, you got to be able to
[1:03:23] serve.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; That's what ministry is all about.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; So when he call a man, he call his wife.
[1:03:29] And the wife also has to be able to
[1:03:31] serve the people.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; We all that that's what that's what this
[1:03:38] whole call is about is about service.
[1:03:40] the children. Amen. The the the tribe of
[1:03:42] Levi was serving the other tribes.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; And through their service, God actually
[1:03:48] took care of them for their service.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; God blessed them for their service.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; God will bless you for your service.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; Oh my my my my.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Let me go on and and I I'll say this
[1:04:05] because some people here, well, that's
[1:04:06] what the pastor for to serve. To serve.
[1:04:08] Now, don't take advantage of the
[1:04:10] service.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Don't take advantage of it now. Glory to
[1:04:16] God. And you find yourself in something
[1:04:18] all the time.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Are you in a ditch all the time?
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; Something wrong here.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; Are you sheep
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; or goat?
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; Cuz the pastor serve sheep.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; All right. Now,
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; glory to God. You find goats kicking and
[1:04:41] bucking.
[1:04:43] Uh-uh. No. No. No. This ain't no. Uhuh.
[1:04:45] No. We looking for sheep.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; All right. Let me go on a little
[1:04:51] further.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; So, we see these these tribes and we see
[1:04:55] Joseph and Levi missing from the tribal
[1:04:58] order as they're moving through uh in
[1:05:00] the Exodus. We see this. Let's go on a
[1:05:03] little further.
[1:05:08] Brother Brandham tells us in Sardisian
[1:05:10] church age
[1:05:12] when we look
[1:05:13] at Revelation 7 verse 4-8
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; where it says they were sealed 144,000
[1:05:20] of all the tribes of the children of
[1:05:22] Israel. It names thus
[1:05:25] Judah,
[1:05:27] Reuben,
[1:05:28] Gad,
[1:05:30] Asher, Napali,
[1:05:33] Manasseh, Simeon, Levi, Issachar,
[1:05:38] Zebulun, Joseph, Benjamin.
[1:05:43] It says we're back to the 12 tribes with
[1:05:45] Levi and Joseph named among them, but
[1:05:48] with Dan and Ephraim missing. Just hit
[1:05:51] next on that. Now, you know, I I'm I'm
[1:05:54] I'm giving you just a couple scriptures
[1:05:55] and and this is one thing I'm gonna say.
[1:05:58] I thank God
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; that he sent us a prophet.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; I would not be able to share these
[1:06:10] things with you. It'll just be
[1:06:12] information in the Bible,
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; but no connection at all. But when a
[1:06:18] prophet comes on the scene and he begins
[1:06:20] to reveal things to us, we start seeing
[1:06:22] more than we ever saw before.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; That's why he said after the seals were
[1:06:27] open, he said the Bible became a new
[1:06:30] book to him.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; How could you go into Hosea 14 and pull
[1:06:34] all this out
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; because of a prophet?
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; He just gave us a couple scriptures. He
[1:06:42] took us to to to Numbers, took us to
[1:06:45] Genesis. Now, he's taking us from
[1:06:47] Genesis all the way to Revelation.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; All right. And then when we get to
[1:06:50] Revelation 7, this is tribulation
[1:06:53] period. Hallelujah. And and let me just
[1:06:56] forewarn
[1:06:57] uh some of my young people, you don't
[1:06:59] want to miss a rapture. And and just in
[1:07:02] case you don't know, the hour in
[1:07:04] scripture that you are living in is the
[1:07:08] hour where you can expect a rapture, a
[1:07:10] changing of your body
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; to be called up to meet him in the air.
[1:07:15] And and and now that needs to happen
[1:07:17] before the Jews receive Christ as their
[1:07:20] savior,
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; right? And and the Jews already are are
[1:07:23] are already talking about, you know,
[1:07:26] trying to find I mean I mean there's
[1:07:28] Jews already uh coming in and accepting
[1:07:30] Christ. I mean, some of them are
[1:07:32] Messianic Jews are accepting this
[1:07:34] already. Hallelujah. But but we know
[1:07:35] there's a greater work that's going to
[1:07:37] happen and it's 144,000 going to be
[1:07:40] dealt with. This is promised in the
[1:07:42] scripture.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; But it happens during the tribulation
[1:07:45] period.
[1:07:48] But when those God begins to deal with
[1:07:50] the Jews in the tribulation period
[1:07:51] because the same gospel that they
[1:07:53] rejected in order to give us an
[1:07:55] opportunity to accept the gospel. Now
[1:07:57] this gospel is being rejected by us
[1:07:59] Gentiles and is going back to the Jews.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; When they get it, God's going to call
[1:08:06] 12,000 out of each tribe. And notice the
[1:08:09] tribes that he would he would call.
[1:08:13] Hit next on there for me. It's going to
[1:08:15] be Judah,
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; Reuben, Gad,
[1:08:20] Asher, Nefali,
[1:08:23] Manasseh,
[1:08:24] Simeon, Levi, Issachar, Zebulon, Joseph,
[1:08:30] and Benjamin. And look now in this order
[1:08:33] in book of Revelation chapter 7, there's
[1:08:36] no Dan or Ephraim that's being dealt
[1:08:40] with during the tribulation period.
[1:08:43] No Dan, no Ephraim.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; How did they lose their position?
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; How did they lose their position?
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; Why? I mean, before we we we saw them in
[1:08:51] ex I mean in the Exodus, they were
[1:08:53] there. But now at this time in scripture
[1:08:56] when when God is dealing with the Jews
[1:08:58] through the the tribulation period, no
[1:09:00] Dan, no Ephraim.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; How did they lose their position?
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Let us go a little further.
[1:09:16] Brother Brandham gives us the answer to
[1:09:17] how they lost their position. It goes
[1:09:19] back to a scripture out of Deuteronomy
[1:09:21] 29 verse 16- 20.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; And I and and I want you to notice
[1:09:27] because brother Brandham tells us, and
[1:09:29] I'll read it later, he says, "The same
[1:09:31] way God remembers his good promises,
[1:09:34] he also remembers the bad ones, too.
[1:09:38] God remembers every promise that he that
[1:09:40] he that he that he has given,
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; you know, um I mean over in Deuteronomy
[1:09:46] 28 when when you when you when you
[1:09:48] follow the Lord and you follow his word,
[1:09:50] you know, he actually makes you promises
[1:09:52] that that my God, you'll be blessed in
[1:09:54] the city, you'll be blessed in the
[1:09:57] field, you'll be blessed going out,
[1:09:59] you'll be blessed coming in, you I mean,
[1:10:01] you'll just be blessed. Yes, sir. But
[1:10:03] also in that same chapter, if you if you
[1:10:05] keep reading, it's a long chapter. There
[1:10:07] are more curses when you fail to follow
[1:10:10] the word of God
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; than there are blessings when you do
[1:10:13] follow.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Here we find Deuteronomy 29.
[1:10:18] For ye know
[1:10:21] how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt,
[1:10:24] and how we came through the nations
[1:10:26] which ye passed by, and ye have seen
[1:10:29] their abominations, and their idols,
[1:10:31] wood, and stone, silver, and gold, which
[1:10:34] were among them,
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; lest there should be any am lest there
[1:10:40] should be among you man or woman or
[1:10:43] family or tribe or tribe whose heart
[1:10:48] turneth away this day from the Lord our
[1:10:52] God to go and serve the gods of these
[1:10:54] nations. Now, now he he's I mean, here
[1:10:56] Moses giving him instruction like y'all
[1:10:58] done seen all this this this this
[1:11:00] negative stuff, these nations that God
[1:11:02] have destroyed because of their
[1:11:04] idolatry. He's destroyed them and given
[1:11:06] you their land.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; Now, here you going to turn around and
[1:11:09] go and serve some of the same gods that
[1:11:11] God gave you their land. Come on now.
[1:11:14] Something wrong with this.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:11:16] And and and and if I could just make it
[1:11:18] plain, you know, how you going to get
[1:11:20] delivered from something and you give
[1:11:22] testimony being delivered from it and
[1:11:24] then you go right back into it
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; here. He he God gives some instruction
[1:11:31] through through Moses. Lest there, verse
[1:11:33] 18, lest there should be among you man
[1:11:36] or woman or family or a tribe whose
[1:11:39] heart turneth away this day from the
[1:11:40] Lord our God to go and serve the God of
[1:11:42] these nations, lest there should be be
[1:11:45] among you a root that beareth gall and
[1:11:47] wormwood and wormwood.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; And it come to pass
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; when he he curse that he blessed himself
[1:11:54] in his heart, saying, I shall have
[1:11:56] peace, though I walk in imagination of
[1:11:58] mine heart to add drunkenness to thirst.
[1:12:01] drunkenness.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; You're not going to have peace when
[1:12:04] you're serving the devil. I can tell you
[1:12:05] that right now.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; The the the the uh the way of a
[1:12:10] transgressor
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; according to the Bible,
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; the way of a transgressor is going to be
[1:12:16] hard.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; Don't ever think you're going to get by
[1:12:19] when you choose to serve the devil.
[1:12:20] Right?
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; You might be like the the rich young
[1:12:23] ruler
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; who rejected Christ. And the Bible
[1:12:26] actually says his barns got so small, he
[1:12:29] had to build bigger barns because of all
[1:12:31] the money and all the stuff that he'd
[1:12:33] accumulated, he had to build bigger
[1:12:34] barns. And while he was building, maybe
[1:12:37] got finished and was enjoying everything
[1:12:39] he had, he died.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; And the scripture say, "Oh, fool."
[1:12:45] Because he did not consider what was
[1:12:46] going to happen after he left here. And
[1:12:49] he ended up in the Bible say in hell he
[1:12:52] lifted up his eyes.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; You don't win serving the devil.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; You may have all kind of blessings or
[1:13:02] feel like you got blessings on this
[1:13:04] side, but when you lift up your eyes in
[1:13:06] hell, you're going to realize it didn't
[1:13:08] pay off to serve the devil.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; Here the ver the Bible says this.
[1:13:15] And it come to pass, verse 19, when he
[1:13:17] he curse, that he blessed himself in his
[1:13:19] heart, saying, I shall have peace,
[1:13:21] though I walk in imagination of my
[1:13:23] heart, to add drunkenness to thirst, the
[1:13:25] Lord will not spare him. But then the
[1:13:27] anger of the Lord and his jealousy shall
[1:13:29] smoke against that man, and all the
[1:13:32] curses that are written in this book
[1:13:34] shall lie upon him, and the Lord shall
[1:13:36] blot out his name
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; from under heaven.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; Now, what happened here? The reason that
[1:13:44] we didn't see Ephraim and Dan there in
[1:13:48] the book of Revelation as one of the as
[1:13:50] two of the tribes that will be dealt
[1:13:52] with during the tribulation period
[1:13:54] because their names was blotted out
[1:13:56] under heaven. Yes, sir.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; This scripture that if you turned and
[1:14:01] went into idolatry,
[1:14:04] your whole tribe could be affected by
[1:14:06] going into idolatry. Yes, sir.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And therefore, the reason
[1:14:11] you don't see their name listed is
[1:14:13] because they got involved in idolatry,
[1:14:15] even from to his idols, let him alone.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; Because they're involved with idolatry,
[1:14:21] they were not dealt with during the
[1:14:22] tribulation period. But remember, we're
[1:14:24] looking for ultimate
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; restoration.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, I thank God.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; I thank God that that that that
[1:14:33] restoration can go beyond the
[1:14:35] tribulation period. Lord,
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; oh, I'm going to say it again.
[1:14:38] restoration can go beyond the
[1:14:40] tribulation period.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; We we we don't we when we dealing with
[1:14:45] God, you we dealing with something
[1:14:46] mighty here.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; Watch this.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; Watch this.
[1:15:00] Brother Brandham says, "Note
[1:15:02] particularly that the punishment for
[1:15:03] idolatry for idolatry
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; was that the name of that tribe
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; was to be blotted out
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; from under heaven."
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Deuteronomy 29:20, which we just read,
[1:15:17] he said, "It does not say it would be
[1:15:19] blotted out in heaven,
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; but from
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; under heaven."
[1:15:26] And that's exactly as it is for now,
[1:15:29] Israel is back in Palestine. And soon
[1:15:31] the Lord will seal 144,000 of them. But
[1:15:35] from that number, Dan and Ephraim are
[1:15:38] missing.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; How did they get to this spot where they
[1:15:42] were missing? Let me just camp here just
[1:15:45] for a little bit. Just stay on that
[1:15:47] slide.
[1:15:49] Little history of how Israel got into
[1:15:52] this state. Let me take you back on a
[1:15:55] little journey.
[1:15:57] the time that Solomon
[1:15:59] became king of Israel. I mean, he was
[1:16:02] considered, I guess, would be the third
[1:16:04] king. You have Saul as their first king.
[1:16:06] And and um Saul was disobedient. And and
[1:16:11] do you know that his disobedience
[1:16:14] actually the scripture says his
[1:16:16] disobedience was as the sin of
[1:16:18] witchcraft
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; and I believe idolatry, right? So his
[1:16:23] his disobedience was as the sin of
[1:16:25] witchcraft. God looked at that really
[1:16:26] really bad. So bad that God rejected him
[1:16:29] as king.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; God wants complete and full obedience to
[1:16:33] his word.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Do you know when we have full obedience
[1:16:36] to the word that entitles us to the
[1:16:38] token?
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Right. So so so so uh here you know Saul
[1:16:43] being their first king but Saul Saul got
[1:16:45] rejected. God raised up another king.
[1:16:47] His name was David. Amen. David becomes
[1:16:50] the second king of Israel. and and and
[1:16:52] and David was uh was known to be a man
[1:16:56] after God's own heart. I'd rather have
[1:16:59] that testimony
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; over my life than anything else. I want
[1:17:03] to be known as a man that's going after
[1:17:05] the heart of God.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; You ought to be known as a woman that's
[1:17:09] going after the heart of God.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; David David has a a very positive
[1:17:17] testimony of God. Even though David
[1:17:18] sinned with Basheba, he repented and um
[1:17:22] you know and and God just had a
[1:17:24] beautiful relationship. Uh brother
[1:17:25] Brandham said you can see the life of
[1:17:27] Christ just typed all through David's
[1:17:29] life. A beautiful be beautiful servant
[1:17:32] of the Lord. But David had a son even in
[1:17:34] his sin.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[1:17:39] Even in his sin, David gets Basheba
[1:17:43] pregnant and has a son from Basheba
[1:17:46] after he had done killed her husband.
[1:17:48] The man was wrong. Just dead wrong.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; But even in the midst of this mess,
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; God did something special for David.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; Oh my. It shows you that when God
[1:18:02] forgives you, then God forgives you.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; It ain't nothing that nobody can say.
[1:18:06] No, nothing that nobody can do when God
[1:18:10] has dropped it into the sea of
[1:18:11] forgiveness.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Brother, like nothing ever even
[1:18:16] happened.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; He gives him a son from this this this
[1:18:21] adulterous relationship.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; And causes that boy out of all the boys
[1:18:27] that David had, he caused that boy to be
[1:18:30] named the next king.
[1:18:33] Solomon gets this position and and and I
[1:18:36] mean we can
[1:18:38] there's so much we can talk about there.
[1:18:40] I mean Solomon had a gift in his life.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; Solomon was wise. Solomon was Solomon
[1:18:48] was was one that when God came to him in
[1:18:50] a in a dream begin to talk to him say
[1:18:53] you know what do you want?
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; You know you can you can have this you
[1:18:56] can have that. What do you want? It's
[1:18:57] it's it's got to it's got to come out of
[1:18:59] your mouth as to what you want.
[1:19:02] You can be the richest, you can be this,
[1:19:04] you can be that. Solomon said, "No, no,
[1:19:05] no, no, no, no, no, no. God, God, I tell
[1:19:07] you what I want." He says, "I just need
[1:19:09] some wisdom
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; to be able to discern things here in
[1:19:13] this and to be able to kind of help your
[1:19:15] people. I I'm a servant to the people.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; So, I I I need wisdom to know how to
[1:19:20] serve."
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; God said, "You know what, Solomon?
[1:19:25] Because you ask for wisdom,
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you both wisdom,
[1:19:29] money, and popularity. The richest king
[1:19:32] to ever live. Because he asked for the
[1:19:34] right thing, he got all God all all God
[1:19:37] wanted for.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; And after he got this this this this
[1:19:42] wisdom,
[1:19:44] the very probably next day, he's sitting
[1:19:47] in the court and a challenge comes
[1:19:50] before him. A a case
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; comes before him.
[1:19:53] In this case, and let me just mention
[1:19:56] this to
[1:19:58] sisters, you can choose what kind of
[1:20:00] woman you want to be.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; The life that you live, you choose what
[1:20:05] kind of woman you want to identify with.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; Because Solomon had to deal with a
[1:20:11] couple women
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; and these two women had a lifestyle of
[1:20:16] uh prostitution.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And and they became
[1:20:20] roommates.
[1:20:22] And and but but but let me just go a
[1:20:24] little further. Amen. Because everybody
[1:20:26] that's involved in prostitution
[1:20:29] might not want to be involved in
[1:20:32] prostitution.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Some of them might have a a real Amen.
[1:20:37] some real character in them and just you
[1:20:39] don't know how people get into some of
[1:20:41] the conditions at the end. So you just
[1:20:42] can't judge everybody.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; That's right. And the way we can tell
[1:20:47] that one of these ladies was a little
[1:20:49] different
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; because these two prostitutes got
[1:20:52] pregnant at the same time,
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; gave birth to babies at the same time.
[1:20:56] And when they gave birth to these
[1:20:58] babies, Amen. Uh, one lady is is is is
[1:21:01] in the room with her baby and and she
[1:21:04] lays on top of the baby and smothers the
[1:21:06] baby to death.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; And when she does that, she sneaks into
[1:21:10] the other room of the other lady and she
[1:21:12] swaps the babies. Yes.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; And when they woke up in the morning
[1:21:16] that this this lady say, "This ain't my
[1:21:18] baby." "Yes, that is your baby. This
[1:21:21] ain't my baby. That that's your baby.
[1:21:22] You done killed your baby." Lying to
[1:21:24] her. So, we going to have to take this
[1:21:26] to King Solomon.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; They bring the case before Solomon.
[1:21:32] Solomon say, "Uh, oh, this one saying
[1:21:34] this is her baby and the other one
[1:21:35] saying this is her baby."
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; We don't know who baby it is. He said,
[1:21:39] "I tell you what to do.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; Bring me a sword.
[1:21:43] and we're going to cut the baby in half
[1:21:46] and we're going to give half to this
[1:21:47] mother and half to that mother.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; And one of the mothers say, "That's
[1:21:51] right. Cut the baby in half."
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; Let me let me also just interject this
[1:22:00] before I go a little further. If you got
[1:22:02] people that don't mind splitting the
[1:22:04] church
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; and don't care about the conditions,
[1:22:08] this church gonna split and you don't
[1:22:10] care nothing about it. You like that
[1:22:12] mother in the story.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; But the other other mother said, "No,
[1:22:21] no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't don't
[1:22:23] cut the baby in half.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; Let let her have the baby.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Let her have the baby. Don't cut the
[1:22:29] baby in half." And when Solomon saw how
[1:22:31] that mother responded, he said, "He knew
[1:22:33] who the mother was."
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; Your actions say a lot about who you
[1:22:38] are.
[1:22:41] That's right.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; All these great things. Solomon was
[1:22:45] considered the king of the golden age of
[1:22:48] Israel.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; A lot of powerful things happened. But
[1:22:52] what happened in Solomon's life
[1:22:54] is his standards begin to drop. As he
[1:22:57] got older,
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; his standards begin to drop.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; And Solomon began to marry women from
[1:23:03] foreign countries.
[1:23:05] Now, he's supposed to stay just with the
[1:23:07] women of Israel and and all that. And
[1:23:09] even he got I mean, Solomon had 1,000
[1:23:11] wives. I don't know what what man.
[1:23:17] No man can handle no 1,000 women.
[1:23:21] Can't even handle one.
[1:23:25] How you going to handle a thousand?
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; Right. It it shows, you know, just the
[1:23:30] passion that he had and the lust spirits
[1:23:32] that he dealing with and everything
[1:23:33] else, right? But but but here you know
[1:23:36] Solomon as he got older, Amen, God used
[1:23:39] him to build the temple for Israel, the
[1:23:41] first temple. But but he also built
[1:23:44] temples for his foreign wives.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; And God had given him instruction. Don't
[1:23:49] marry one of these foreign women because
[1:23:51] they're going to pull your heart from
[1:23:53] God.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Young people, be be careful about who
[1:23:56] you get involved with.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; They will pull your heart from God.
[1:24:02] Amen.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Years and years of life of misery.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; Here Solomon gets himself in this
[1:24:12] situation.
[1:24:14] He's he's married to these foreign women
[1:24:16] and and worshiping with them and
[1:24:18] building building h temples. I mean
[1:24:21] Solomon is in is in idol worship. The
[1:24:24] very same man that built the temple for
[1:24:27] God finds himself now at the end of his
[1:24:29] life in idol worship.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; Because of this idolatry,
[1:24:37] God came to Solomon. You find this in
[1:24:39] First Kings 10. Uh because of this
[1:24:42] idolatry, God comes to Solomon and tell
[1:24:45] him said, "Because you did this, because
[1:24:47] you did that, because you did this, I'm
[1:24:48] going to split this kingdom
[1:24:51] and your son going to be still ruler
[1:24:53] over a couple tribes, but but I'm going
[1:24:55] to split this kingdom." And you know,
[1:24:56] because because he said, "I'm not going
[1:24:58] to do it while you're still living, but
[1:25:00] your son going to have to go through
[1:25:01] this because of the things that you've
[1:25:03] done."
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; You got to be careful. your your your
[1:25:08] actions
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; affect your family.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; Things that you do, things that you say
[1:25:15] impact your family.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; And sometimes things go on for
[1:25:19] generation after generation and it
[1:25:21] started somewhere. That's why if you can
[1:25:23] do something right for God, let that be
[1:25:25] that let that legacy begin to flow in
[1:25:27] your family. Amen.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Solomon
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; ends up dying and
[1:25:39] and and and and before he dies, God has
[1:25:42] already given him a uh a prophecy that
[1:25:46] hey, you're going to lose half of your
[1:25:47] kingdom. You're going to do this. Now,
[1:25:48] what happened? Solomon had a young man
[1:25:50] that was in his kingdom. I believe the
[1:25:52] Bible called him very industrious.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; His name was Jeroboam. And uh Jeroboam
[1:25:58] was just gaining favor with the people
[1:25:59] and everything. And Solomon recognized
[1:26:01] this. So Solomon began to try to go
[1:26:02] after this guy. So Jeroboam end up
[1:26:05] running to go to Egypt to get away from
[1:26:08] Solomon. But on his way running,
[1:26:10] hallelujah. Jerobom gets a prophecy.
[1:26:13] Actually before he left to run from uh
[1:26:16] run from uh Solomon, he got a prophecy
[1:26:18] by Hija I believe his name. He say he
[1:26:21] say now God is going to Amen. take some
[1:26:24] of the kingdom from from Solomon and he
[1:26:26] is going to use you to be the leader of
[1:26:29] this other group.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; You're going to be a king to this other
[1:26:32] group. Jerb has a prophecy
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; that he's going to be the leader. He
[1:26:37] takes off running from Solomon. He goes
[1:26:40] down into Egypt. And I I don't know. I
[1:26:42] don't know. I don't know what happened.
[1:26:44] What happened while he was down in
[1:26:45] Egypt? Because the same Jerobone that's
[1:26:48] given the prophecy that you're going to
[1:26:49] be the leader,
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; he led the people into idolatry.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; That that that that strikes me,
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; man. You've been prophesied to by
[1:27:06] almighty God.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; When when God gives you a prophecy,
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; oh my my
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; if God tell you you going to be the
[1:27:15] leader, There is nobody
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; that can take that from you.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; When God has given you the word, there
[1:27:24] is nobody. I don't care what they do,
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; they can't take that from you.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; People be scheming and doing all kind of
[1:27:32] things, but they can't take it when God
[1:27:34] has given that promise to you.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; Jerobam was living underneath this
[1:27:39] promise.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. One of the things and this just
[1:27:42] just my own imagination. Maybe by him
[1:27:45] going to Egypt. You know what Egypt
[1:27:47] represent?
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; The world. Maybe by him going to Egypt
[1:27:52] he got contaminated.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; While he was waiting he got contaminated
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; and that affected his thought process.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Now Solomon dies. Jeroboam comes back.
[1:28:06] Solomon's next son, Rahab, is becomes
[1:28:09] the next king in Israel.
[1:28:12] Jerobone comes back
[1:28:14] and he has a conversation with Rahab.
[1:28:16] Says, "Look, your daddy was pretty hard
[1:28:18] on us. Could you just lighten the load
[1:28:20] just a little bit?" And Rahab
[1:28:23] had two groups of counselors.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; He had the older counselors and he had
[1:28:30] the younger counselors. And the older
[1:28:33] council say, "Yeah, if you want to keep
[1:28:35] the kingdom all within, you know, you
[1:28:37] better get you better you better lighten
[1:28:39] the load of the people because you can
[1:28:40] hear the complaints of them now. Just
[1:28:42] lighten their load just a little bit."
[1:28:43] But Red Bone say, "Well, what what y'all
[1:28:45] young fellas got to say?" The Red Bone
[1:28:47] Red Bone say, "You know, the young young
[1:28:50] fell say, tell them your daddy won
[1:28:52] nothing.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; You you going to feel a scorpion power
[1:28:58] now.
[1:28:59] I'mma show you what real leadership look
[1:29:02] like. I'mma put my foot down. Let me let
[1:29:06] me just just just just park there for a
[1:29:09] little bit. Sometimes when leaders are
[1:29:11] stepping in, how you got to know how to
[1:29:14] handle certain situations
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; and you kind of you try to come in like
[1:29:18] Rayaboom and put your foot down, you'll
[1:29:21] lose the kingdom.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; Hello. The older counselors was trying
[1:29:27] to tell them just just be patient, just
[1:29:29] be wise, just wait on this. Don't go
[1:29:32] trying to change everything when you
[1:29:34] become the leader.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They say, you know, you know
[1:29:39] how to cook frog.
[1:29:42] If you want to kill a frog and cook
[1:29:44] them, people eat frog leg. You know the
[1:29:46] best way to kill a frog and cook him.
[1:29:49] Says you got to put him in water that
[1:29:52] he's comfortable with. Yeah.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; And then you got to slowly
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; turn up the heat.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Cuz if you if you put him in and it's
[1:30:00] too hot,
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; he going to jump.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; And when you see people jumping because
[1:30:07] you done turned up the heat a little bit
[1:30:08] too hot.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Is that all right, church?
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; All these things are in the scripture.
[1:30:17] But but Raome had was given some he
[1:30:20] didn't realize that the advice that he
[1:30:22] was taking from Amen these these younger
[1:30:25] leaders or younger advisors the advice
[1:30:27] that he was taking was actually causing
[1:30:29] a prophecy to come to pass.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; And here the nation was divided.
[1:30:35] Jerobone took one group. Rayon took two
[1:30:38] tribes. The other 10 tribes went with
[1:30:40] Jerobone.
[1:30:42] Two of those 10 tribes that went with
[1:30:44] Jerobone happened to be
[1:30:47] then
[1:30:49] and Ephraim.
[1:30:58] This next slide tells us what Jeroboam
[1:31:00] did.
[1:31:05] Remember, Brother Brandham says, "The
[1:31:08] tribe that turned to idolatry
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; was to have its name blotted out blotted
[1:31:15] out." And notice now blotted out under
[1:31:17] heaven, not in heaven.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; The history of those of the two tribes
[1:31:23] whose names were blotted out because of
[1:31:25] idolatry is found in Kings 12. First
[1:31:28] Kings 12 verse 25-30. Brother Brandham
[1:31:31] is reading the scripture.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; Then Jeroboam
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; built Sheckchum.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Where is he built it at?
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; In Mount Ephraim.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; And dwelt therein.
[1:31:43] and went out from then and built
[1:31:45] Pinuuel.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; And Jerobom said in his heart, now
[1:31:49] remember God had given him a prophecy,
[1:31:52] you're going to be you're going to be
[1:31:54] king. And if I' if I've established
[1:31:56] this, if God has established this in the
[1:31:58] heavens and now it's coming to pass on
[1:32:00] earth, there's nothing Jeroboam need to
[1:32:02] do to worry about whether the people
[1:32:04] going to go over here and do this and do
[1:32:06] that. Oh Lord have mercy. Let let me
[1:32:08] just read it. Jeroboam built Sheckchum
[1:32:11] in Mount Ephraim and dwelt therein and
[1:32:12] went out from this and built Pinuel. And
[1:32:15] Jerobom said in this art, "Now shall the
[1:32:17] kingdom return to the house of David. If
[1:32:20] this people go up to do sacrifice in the
[1:32:22] house of the Lord at Jerusalem, then
[1:32:24] shall the heart of his people turn again
[1:32:25] unto their Lord, even unto Rahab, king
[1:32:28] of Judah, and they shall kill me and go
[1:32:30] again to Rahab, king of Judah." Can I
[1:32:33] put it in uh uh current day terms?
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, uh I uh we don't want to
[1:32:40] encourage people to go to certain
[1:32:42] meetings because they might go there to
[1:32:44] those meetings and see things going on
[1:32:47] that church and actually get pulled and
[1:32:48] want to go to that church.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; So we won't say anything about the
[1:32:52] meeting meeting of another church. We'll
[1:32:54] just keep doing what we doing.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; We'll just isolate the people over here.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But when God has given you,
[1:33:03] Amen. and assurance of your your
[1:33:05] leadership. You don't have to worry
[1:33:07] about the people going nowhere.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; They'll come back home. I'm telling you,
[1:33:13] because they know where they get fed.
[1:33:17] [Music]
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; They know where they get fed. You I
[1:33:20] mean, let them go and enjoy themselves.
[1:33:23] You don't know what God will do in that
[1:33:25] meeting atmosphere for the people. They
[1:33:27] come back better Christians.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't have to be afraid of
[1:33:33] these things,
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; but Jerobom type leadership,
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; you're afraid of who they go around.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; Don't go to that meeting. I'm not going
[1:33:42] to announce that one. I ain't going to
[1:33:44] say nothing about it. I'mma act like it
[1:33:46] don't even exist.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; Watch that.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; Watch. Watch what you're doing there.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because that type of
[1:33:56] leadership don't last.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; Hello. Hello. I I I try to let people
[1:34:02] know about whatever going on. I want you
[1:34:03] to be blessed.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; I want you to be blessed. Amen. And and
[1:34:07] and I realize, look, I mean, uh we all
[1:34:10] got different angles that we bringing it
[1:34:12] bringing the word to you. You know, all
[1:34:14] the different ministers got different
[1:34:15] angles, but you know, sometimes we can
[1:34:17] bring another minister in with a whole
[1:34:18] another different angle and it's a
[1:34:19] blessing to the people.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; And sometimes it's good to have other
[1:34:23] ministers come in because it it help you
[1:34:25] to see that God is speaking to you right
[1:34:27] here. He'll come and use that minister
[1:34:29] to say something she already heard.
[1:34:31] You're like, "Look at God."
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Jeroboam said in his heart now shall the
[1:34:40] kingdom return to the house of David.
[1:34:41] This is if this people go up to
[1:34:43] sacrifice to sacrifice
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; uh uh if this people go up to sacrifice
[1:34:49] in the house of the Lord at Jerusalem.
[1:34:50] Now, now I want you to also notice God
[1:34:53] had established a particular place for
[1:34:54] the people to go. It was in Jerusalem.
[1:34:57] Oh my. God has a provided place of
[1:35:01] worship.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; Can I tell y'all where God wants y'all
[1:35:04] to worship?
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord. Is that in the Bible? He is
[1:35:12] seeking those to worship him in spirit
[1:35:15] and in truth.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; Now that's just not a church name. That
[1:35:21] is a real place in Christ. Amen.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; Everybody can come to a place where
[1:35:26] you're worshiping in spirit and in
[1:35:29] truth.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; Now, I will say this. The name of the
[1:35:33] church should tell you something.
[1:35:44] Um,
[1:35:49] and they shall kill me and go again to
[1:35:51] Reabon, king of Judah, whereupon the
[1:35:53] king took counsel, and look at what he
[1:35:56] did. Made two calves of gold.
[1:36:00] Do you know anything about the history
[1:36:04] of of these people? Do you realize when
[1:36:06] Moses came out the mountain, his own
[1:36:08] brother had made a calf
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; and God destroyed it and you going to
[1:36:13] lift up two calves again?
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Whereupon the king took cows and made
[1:36:24] two cows of gold and said to them, "It
[1:36:26] is too much
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; for you to go up to Jerusalem." That
[1:36:30] that's a long journey. Don't take that,
[1:36:32] y'all. It's hours and hours of driving
[1:36:35] and and it's just it's going to be such
[1:36:37] a sacrifice.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; Behold thy gods,
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; oh Israel, which brought thee up out of
[1:36:44] the land of Egypt. And and and the sad
[1:36:46] part is they fell for it. These ain't
[1:36:48] the gods that brought us out of Egypt.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; And remember I told you this man was
[1:36:53] spending time down in Egypt. I think
[1:36:54] maybe he got twisted down there. Why he
[1:36:58] was waiting on this prophecy to come to
[1:37:00] pass.
[1:37:02] Look at this now. Which brought thee up
[1:37:04] out of the land of Egypt. And he set one
[1:37:06] in Bethl that was Ephraim.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; And the other the other one he put in.
[1:37:12] So the two calves of gold idolatry
[1:37:15] Ephraim to his idols. Let him alone.
[1:37:19] They're calves of gold that they're
[1:37:22] going to worship saying these are the
[1:37:24] gods that brought us out of Egypt. This
[1:37:26] is why their names are not found in
[1:37:28] Revelation 7. Dan or Ephim because of
[1:37:31] what happened here way back in the book
[1:37:33] of Kings.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; God remembered it.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; God remembered it all the way down to on
[1:37:40] the other side of the rapture
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; that they will not be dealt with.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; But remember I said ultimate
[1:37:49] restoration.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; They're not dealt with. Their names were
[1:37:53] blotted out under heaven,
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; but not blotted out
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; in heaven. Amen sir. Amen.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; Let's go a little further.
[1:38:03] It says he set one in Bethl and the
[1:38:05] other one he put in Dan and this thing
[1:38:07] became a sin for the people went to
[1:38:09] worship before the one even unto Dan.
[1:38:11] And then Hosea 4:17 Brother Brandham
[1:38:14] brings this in Ephraim is joined to his
[1:38:17] idols.
[1:38:18] Let him alone.
[1:38:25] I told you I thank God for
[1:38:28] a prophet
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; because a prophet go and get all these
[1:38:34] little secrets and and helps us see the
[1:38:36] whole picture
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; here in the Sardisian church age. He
[1:38:40] makes another statement says, "However,
[1:38:45] after this period of tribulation,
[1:38:50] during the millennium,
[1:38:52] as seen by Ezekiel
[1:38:55] in Ezekiel 48:1-8, as well as uh verse
[1:38:59] 22- 29, we see the tribes back once more
[1:39:03] in divine order. But from the from the
[1:39:07] time that Ephraim and Dan joined
[1:39:08] themselves to idols, they died. And
[1:39:11] those tribes have have no more
[1:39:13] recognition. Now I realize that since
[1:39:16] the destruction of Jerusalem, all
[1:39:18] records of all the tribes have been
[1:39:20] lost. So that no one can say for sure
[1:39:23] what tribe he is from. But God knows
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; that great God who is bringing Israel
[1:39:29] back to Palestine knows exactly which
[1:39:32] tribe every true Israelite is from
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; and from all the assembled 144,000 Dan
[1:39:40] and Ephraim will be missing.
[1:39:48] Hosea 14:8 again says Ephraim shall say,
[1:39:51] "What have I to do anymore with idols? I
[1:39:54] have heard him.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; Now, Benson said, "Maybe that's God
[1:39:58] talking, but I I like to I I look at it
[1:40:00] from a different angle. This is me
[1:40:01] talking. God, I've heard you speak to
[1:40:04] me."
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; Ephraim can say, "I've heard you speak
[1:40:07] to me. I have observed him. I'm like a
[1:40:11] green fur tree.
[1:40:15] From me is thy fruit found." Remember
[1:40:18] there in the AI summary at the bottom it
[1:40:20] says this this this this green fur tree
[1:40:23] it it it it was uh it symbolized eternal
[1:40:25] life and the promise of ultimate
[1:40:28] restoration in the scripture. Well, we
[1:40:31] just saw how they lost their position.
[1:40:33] They will not be dealt with. Amen. In
[1:40:35] the tribulation period that because
[1:40:37] their names was blotted out under heaven
[1:40:38] because they went into idolatry.
[1:40:42] Jerobone gave them a a idol god to
[1:40:44] actually worship and they went to that
[1:40:46] god worshiping and they the whole tribe
[1:40:48] was in idolatry blotted out from under
[1:40:52] the heaven. But Ezekiel a great prophet
[1:40:58] saw what was happening in the millennium
[1:40:59] which is on the other side of the
[1:41:01] tribulation. There's a rapture,
[1:41:04] there's a tribulation period and there's
[1:41:06] a great millennium. That's what we're
[1:41:08] living for, church. That's what we're
[1:41:10] living for. And here's here's where we
[1:41:11] see this restoration of Ephraim. My
[1:41:14] there's a lot of things when you when
[1:41:16] you um when you sow bad seeds, you're
[1:41:21] going to reap
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; bad seeds.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; Whatsoever man sow.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; That's what he going to reap.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; So you can't sow bad and expect to reap
[1:41:31] good.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; No, no, no. You sow bad, you're going to
[1:41:34] reap bad. And Ephraim went through a lot
[1:41:36] of stuff in this earth. But I tell you
[1:41:37] what, I tell you what. When God say,
[1:41:39] "I'mma heal your backsliding,"
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; God is looking well beyond. I I know I I
[1:41:44] Oh, Lord have mercy. This the story just
[1:41:46] kind of come to me about the the
[1:41:47] preacher that Brother Random talked
[1:41:49] about. Um, somehow the man got so
[1:41:52] discouraged he just stopped preaching
[1:41:54] and and gave up on his ministry and and
[1:41:56] stopped serving the people and and went
[1:41:58] to work and and one day brother Random's
[1:42:00] down there at the store I think getting
[1:42:02] his or the um uh not the store but uh
[1:42:05] the mechanic getting his car worked on
[1:42:08] and the man said, "No, I'm not serving
[1:42:09] the Lord." He said he said, "You ought
[1:42:10] to go with me sometime to the field,
[1:42:11] brother. You ought to go." He said, "No,
[1:42:13] I ain't serving the Lord no more." He
[1:42:15] says, he says, "No, you're just kidding,
[1:42:17] brother." Said, "No, no, Brother Brand.
[1:42:18] I'm I'm done with that. Brother Random
[1:42:20] went home and just uh you know after he
[1:42:23] said he just couldn't get it off his
[1:42:24] mind. He said the man say I'm done with
[1:42:25] it Lord. No he man can't be done with
[1:42:27] it. No Lord I I got to do something. He
[1:42:30] went back down there. He said brother
[1:42:31] you said that you was done with this.
[1:42:33] You're not serving the Lord. Let me say
[1:42:34] brother Brandham I'm not done. I'm done
[1:42:36] with it. I am not serving the Lord no
[1:42:39] more. I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I just can't.
[1:42:42] Now being a prophet, brother Brandham,
[1:42:44] God could have showed him what happened
[1:42:46] in that man's life to get him to that
[1:42:48] point. You some people get so
[1:42:50] discouraged in their walk. You don't
[1:42:52] know why they in the position that
[1:42:54] they're in. But brother Brandham said,
[1:42:56] he says, "I just couldn't understand. I
[1:42:57] just prayed for the brother, but I I
[1:42:59] couldn't understand." He say, "A few
[1:43:00] days later, that same man, the accident
[1:43:03] happened in the garage and the man
[1:43:05] died."
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; Now look, the man had just told the
[1:43:08] prophet, I'm done with it.
[1:43:11] I ain't serving the Lord no more. Now,
[1:43:14] in our minds, if a person backslides and
[1:43:17] they ain't serving the Lord, that's it
[1:43:19] for them. They're going to hell. That's
[1:43:20] that's what we that's in our mind. But a
[1:43:22] prophet
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; a prophet says
[1:43:28] that God actually had to destroy that
[1:43:30] man's flesh
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; in order to save his soul.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; He said, "I believe that man made it."
[1:43:37] Look, you're going to pay one way or the
[1:43:40] other. If you belong to God, he ain't
[1:43:42] going to lose you.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; But you might lose, you might have a
[1:43:45] short life
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; because of your disobedience to God
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; because you can't separate from your
[1:43:53] idols.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; Thank God.
[1:44:04] I mean this restoration of Ephraim went
[1:44:06] beyond the tribulation.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; This restoration of Ephraim actually
[1:44:12] was was found in the millennium.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; You think about all the things that they
[1:44:17] lost on this side of of glory,
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; but yet they could not be lost.
[1:44:23] Hallelujah.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; I mean, when you go all the way back to
[1:44:26] when when when when when uh when when
[1:44:28] when uh Jacob his Israel had his hands
[1:44:30] crossed praying, he says, "Let his name,
[1:44:34] let Ephraim's name be named among mine."
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; When he when he made that prayer, we
[1:44:40] look all the way down into Ezekiel and
[1:44:43] we find his name is named among them.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:44:48] You talk about ultimate
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; restoration.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, I I'm I'm encouraged, church.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; We got loved ones that are still out
[1:44:58] there and not serving the Lord.
[1:45:01] And and sometimes you look at their
[1:45:03] conditions and you look at their
[1:45:04] situation, you wonder how what what it's
[1:45:06] going to take in order to get them to
[1:45:08] come in. I don't know. But I do know the
[1:45:11] prophet said this. He said somehow
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; majestic fingers will untangle the
[1:45:18] knots.
[1:45:21] [Applause]
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; And he say, "Mama, don't worry. They'll
[1:45:24] be there at the table. Daddy, don't
[1:45:26] worry. They'll be there at the table.
[1:45:28] God will bring them in." Yes.
[1:45:32] [Music]
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; Prophet prophet told us
[1:45:41] everything I loved
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; and everything that ever loved me.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; He said God has given to me
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; and I'm I'm I'm just crazy. If if he
[1:45:57] would say it, I don't believe God was
[1:45:59] just saying that to him because God has
[1:46:02] no respect
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; of persons. He was a servant to get a
[1:46:06] bride ready. And if if if if I if the
[1:46:09] servant got that type of promise, what
[1:46:10] you think the bride going to get?
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; Everything I ever loved
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; and everything that ever loved me,
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; God will give them to me
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; there. Hallelujah.
[1:46:25] This restoration
[1:46:27] goes beyond the tribulation.
[1:46:31] Hallelujah.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:36] This restoration,
[1:46:38] this season that we've been in, of
[1:46:40] restoration goes well beyond the
[1:46:42] tribulation.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; Let's read this.
[1:46:52] Brother Random says that in the seventh
[1:46:53] seal,
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; he says, "See Ephraim at
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; Bethl
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; and Dan, they set up idols
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; and there there went out to worship this
[1:47:02] and here we are plumbed down into the
[1:47:05] millennium age almost." And God stills
[1:47:07] remembered that sin. They're not even
[1:47:10] counted in there. Amen. Glory. Just as
[1:47:13] sure as he remembers every good promise,
[1:47:16] he remembers every evil one, too.
[1:47:19] Just remember that's the reason I
[1:47:21] believe friends I've always tried to
[1:47:22] stay with that word no matter how
[1:47:24] strange it seems. See now they wouldn't
[1:47:27] think about that there then they didn't
[1:47:30] think about it then. So this what he's
[1:47:32] saying when they got involved in this
[1:47:34] idol worship they didn't think about the
[1:47:35] implications.
[1:47:37] And sometimes young people when you get
[1:47:39] involved in certain sins you do not
[1:47:41] think about the implications of that
[1:47:43] sin.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; There will be implications. You know in
[1:47:45] in in the in the book of uh Genesis uh
[1:47:49] with Adam and Eve, God told them the day
[1:47:51] you eat thereof, that day you die.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; There was implications from them getting
[1:47:56] involved in sin.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; Look,
[1:48:01] see now he says they wouldn't think
[1:48:03] about that uh that there then they
[1:48:05] didn't think about it then. And that's
[1:48:07] the problem. You don't think about
[1:48:08] because the devil don't show you that.
[1:48:09] The devil just show you how much
[1:48:10] pleasure you're going to have, but he
[1:48:11] don't show you the implications.
[1:48:14] It says they thought well they got by
[1:48:16] with it.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, you'll never get by
[1:48:19] with sin.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; All right. But the Bible say, "Be sure
[1:48:24] your sins
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; will find you out
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; and what you do in darkness.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; It's going to come to the light.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, help me."
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; Epstein list,
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; what you do in darkness,
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; it's coming to the light. And people
[1:48:43] going to press till they see light.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; And then when they see light,
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; oh y'all, y'all come on y'all. I I I I I
[1:48:53] I I I I was telling the preacher, man, I
[1:48:56] I try to stay away from political
[1:48:57] subjects in the pull pit. I I really do.
[1:48:59] Cuz there there is there's no salvation
[1:49:01] in politics.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; None.
[1:49:10] Ain't no politician going to put you in
[1:49:12] heaven.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; Not one.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; And this is why brother Brandham said,
[1:49:16] "I vote for Jesus."
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; It's wickedness on both sides.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; Just wicked, wicked, wicked. That's
[1:49:26] right.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; You you if you put the Democratic party
[1:49:31] in in in in in position, they would be
[1:49:34] pushing the homosexual agenda like
[1:49:37] crazy.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; Changing laws and everything.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; And we got confused by bathrooms. How
[1:49:43] did that happen?
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; We don't even know what a man and a
[1:49:48] woman is. No. Come on now. This is
[1:49:49] ridiculous.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; But then we get the Republican party and
[1:49:54] we get a Yeah. pedophiles
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; and and yeah, you just wait till the
[1:49:59] list because you know when you've
[1:50:01] trafficked all these young girls and
[1:50:02] they realize what you've done,
[1:50:04] somebody's going to do time for that.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; And that's why one guy did time, but he
[1:50:09] you know he knew he was going he he knew
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; and they said that he let me get out of
[1:50:14] this.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; It just it's filthiness. It's just
[1:50:20] filthiness.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; And and I ain't going to put no
[1:50:22] politician in heaven or hell. Amen.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; Only God can do that.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; A I I don't care what you do.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; You can't do this one thing and live
[1:50:34] like
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, so I ain't putting no
[1:50:41] politicians in heaven or hell.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; Let me read what the prophet said.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; He says, "Amen. Glory. Just as sure as
[1:50:54] he remembers every good promise, he
[1:50:57] remembers every evil one too.
[1:50:59] Just remember when that's the reason I
[1:51:01] believe friends I have always tried to
[1:51:03] stay with that word no matter how
[1:51:04] strange it seems that uh he says see now
[1:51:08] they wouldn't think about that then they
[1:51:11] didn't think about it then they thought
[1:51:13] well they got by with it all right but
[1:51:16] here they are over here in the
[1:51:18] millennium age setting in when their
[1:51:20] names and tribes is blotted out from it
[1:51:23] because they served idolatry that God
[1:51:26] cursed. Didn't he say he hated the
[1:51:28] nickelans and and that Jezebel? Stay
[1:51:32] away from it.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; Didn't he say he killed Jezebel's
[1:51:37] daughters with killing of death, which
[1:51:39] is eternal separation from his presence?
[1:51:41] Don't trust in it at all. He's talking
[1:51:43] about don't trust in the denominational
[1:51:44] system. Don't trust in it all. Get away
[1:51:47] from it. When he's saying get away from
[1:51:49] it, that is Revelation 18:4 happening.
[1:51:52] Come out of her, my people.
[1:51:55] move with a cloud.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Get away from it. He says, "So God
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; remembers."
[1:52:05] We find in Ezekiel 48 verse 1-8 as as
[1:52:09] well as verse 20 through to 29. This is
[1:52:12] Ezekiel seeing the tribes in their
[1:52:15] tribal order during the millennial
[1:52:18] reign. After the tribulation period, now
[1:52:21] it's during the millennial reign. He
[1:52:23] says, "Now these are the names of the
[1:52:25] tribes from the north end to the coast
[1:52:28] of the way of of Hethlon as one goth to
[1:52:32] Hamoth, Hazernand, the border of
[1:52:34] Damascus, northward to the coast of
[1:52:36] Hamoth. For these are his sides east and
[1:52:39] west, a portion for Dan in millennium,
[1:52:44] we see Dan's name is represented. His
[1:52:47] tribe is there even though he was in
[1:52:49] idolatry." So we saw actually through
[1:52:51] this restoration of Ephraim, we also saw
[1:52:54] the restoration of
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; Dan.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It says it says and by the
[1:53:04] border of Dan
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; from the east side unto the west side a
[1:53:07] portion for Asher. Now this is in the
[1:53:09] millennium,
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; right? This is this is so under heaven
[1:53:13] is what happened here on earth. But in
[1:53:15] heaven, this is what we're talking about
[1:53:17] in heaven. They were not blotted out in
[1:53:19] heaven. just under heaven.
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; And by the board of Dan from the east
[1:53:25] side and to the west side, a portion of
[1:53:26] Ash and and by the board of Asher from
[1:53:28] the east side, even into the west side,
[1:53:30] a portion for Naftali. And by the And by
[1:53:33] the board of Napali from the east side
[1:53:35] and to the west side, a portion for
[1:53:36] Manasseh. And by the board of Manasseh,
[1:53:40] from the east side unto the west side, a
[1:53:41] portion for
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; Ephraim. This is the restoration
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; of Ephraim, the ultimate restoration.
[1:53:51] And by the border of Ephraim from the
[1:53:53] east side unto uh even unto the west
[1:53:56] side, a portion for Reuben and by the
[1:53:58] border of Reuben from the east side and
[1:54:00] to the west side a portion for Judah and
[1:54:03] by the border of Judah from the east
[1:54:05] side and to the west side, etc. Brother
[1:54:07] Brandham says he goes on and then he
[1:54:09] moves on down to verse 22. Moreover,
[1:54:12] from the possession of the Levites, from
[1:54:14] the possession of the city begin being
[1:54:15] in the midst of that which is uh which
[1:54:17] is the princes between the border of
[1:54:19] Judah and the border of Ben Benjamin
[1:54:21] shall be for the prince. As for the rest
[1:54:24] of the tribes from the east side and to
[1:54:26] the west side, Benjamin shall have a
[1:54:27] portion. And by the border of Benjamin,
[1:54:29] from the east side and to the west side,
[1:54:31] Simeon shall have a portion. And by the
[1:54:33] border of Simeon from the east side and
[1:54:34] to the west side, Issachar have a
[1:54:37] Issachar portion. And by the border of
[1:54:39] Issachar, from the east side and to the
[1:54:40] west side, Zebulon a portion. And by the
[1:54:43] border of Zebulun, from the east side to
[1:54:45] the west side, Gad a portion. And by the
[1:54:48] border of Gatside,
[1:54:50] southward,
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; etc. What we see is that God has
[1:54:54] restored
[1:54:56] Dan. God has restored Ephraim in the
[1:55:00] millennial reign. This is the ultimate
[1:55:03] restoration.
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; That's when all sin is done.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; Thousand years just my no sin just Satan
[1:55:13] is bound for a thousand years. You talk
[1:55:16] about just enjoying
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; life.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; And there's going to be one more battle
[1:55:21] after that.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; But we already promised to know who
[1:55:24] going to win that battle. And then
[1:55:26] there's a new heaven and a new earth.
[1:55:28] You just so happen to be living during
[1:55:30] the time where you can expect the
[1:55:32] rapture of the body before all this
[1:55:33] settles in.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; And my prayer is that you won't be
[1:55:37] missing at that great getting up
[1:55:39] morning.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; Let me read this last quote. I thank God
[1:55:46] I was able to get through this.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; I got one minute left.
[1:55:52] This last quote in the seventh seal,
[1:55:53] brother Random says, "Notice."
[1:55:56] Did you notice there it was to be
[1:55:58] blunted out why? Under heaven there was
[1:56:01] no immediate sacrifice that could give
[1:56:03] him the Holy Spirit to let him see these
[1:56:07] things. But he did it anyhow in his own
[1:56:10] selfish mind. So back back there when
[1:56:12] Ephraim and Manasseh I'm I'm sorry,
[1:56:15] Ephraim and Dan did this, there was no
[1:56:17] Holy Spirit. There was no sacrifice that
[1:56:20] was given for them at that time. Christ
[1:56:22] had not come and died. This is why they
[1:56:24] were blotted out from under the heaven.
[1:56:26] Don't do you realize how important the
[1:56:29] grace of God? How important the blood of
[1:56:32] Jesus is? Cuz when you think about some
[1:56:34] of the things we did,
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; we should have been wiped out a long
[1:56:39] time ago.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; But thank God for his blood that covers
[1:56:43] us.
[1:56:46] Thank you, Lord.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; Thank God for his grace that keeps us
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; under the heaven. There was no immediate
[1:56:54] sacrifice that could give him
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit to let him see these
[1:56:59] things. But he did it anyhow in his own
[1:57:01] selfish mind. But Ezekiel in his vision
[1:57:03] in the millennium, he sees them again in
[1:57:06] perfect order. Ezekiel, if you want to
[1:57:08] read it, just put it down and you can
[1:57:09] read it to save time. Ezekiel 48 verse
[1:57:12] 1-7. Also read 23-29. Ezekiel seen every
[1:57:16] tribe just exactly in order. And when
[1:57:19] Ezekiel seen them in perfect order, what
[1:57:22] he saw was the restoration
[1:57:25] of Ephraim.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:57:31] [Applause]
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; My my my
[1:57:38] I told the Lord, thank you for your
[1:57:41] word. Amen.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; Thank you for sending us a prophet
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; that we could go into scripture and pull
[1:57:49] these things out.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; God is a good God.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's pray. Musicians, you all
[1:57:56] make your way up. Father,
[1:58:01] how blessed and how privileged we are
[1:58:07] God, just to be able to take this
[1:58:09] journey
[1:58:11] and not only see Ephraim but see
[1:58:14] ourselves in the midst of it.
[1:58:17] And when we see ourselves, we see
[1:58:20] uh the abundance of your grace,
[1:58:24] the abundance of your mercy,
[1:58:27] God, that to to to a promise that can be
[1:58:30] given to us and we can see it in
[1:58:31] scripture that restoration
[1:58:34] even went beyond the tribulation
[1:58:38] because Ezekiel saw them in tribal
[1:58:41] order, perfect order in the millennium.
[1:58:44] Father, if you could see that for for
[1:58:47] Ephraim, what can you see for our loved
[1:58:49] ones? Help us to get a glimpse of this
[1:58:52] and how powerful this is, how powerful
[1:58:55] this promise is,
[1:58:57] Lord, that we would just begin to pray
[1:58:59] and commit um things into your hands,
[1:59:03] God. We know that you you do all things
[1:59:06] well.
[1:59:08] We also know that you told us that in
[1:59:10] scripture, no good thing will you
[1:59:13] withhold from those that walk upright
[1:59:16] before you.
[1:59:18] Let us turn from our wicked ways.
[1:59:21] Let us turn from our idols. Let us turn
[1:59:24] from our sins,
[1:59:27] Father, that you would be glorified and
[1:59:29] you would be exalted and you be
[1:59:31] magnified in and through us.
[1:59:35] Father, how we appreciate you.
[1:59:38] how we love you, how we exalt you,
[1:59:42] how we bless you.
[1:59:45] It's in Jesus name
[1:59:48] we pray. Amen.
[1:59:52] Amen.
[1:59:54] Let's give the Lord a hand of praise.
[1:59:59] Do we have the words?
[2:00:03] I'll I'll I'll grab them real quick.
