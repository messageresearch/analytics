[41:21] All right. Our giving is uh multiple
[41:24] ways. Those that are inside the
[41:25] sanctuary, we do have a box in the back
[41:27] that you can use for your giving. Uh
[41:29] those that are online, we have Zale,
[41:32] PayPal, and Cash App. Preferred method
[41:34] is Zale because they do not take fees.
[41:36] But uh um if you have to use Zel or
[41:39] PayPal, it's giving at john423.org. And
[41:42] cash app is dollar sign spirit t. And we
[41:45] have a mailing address, too, if you want
[41:46] to mail uh your giving in. Amen. Let's
[41:50] have a word of prayer over our giving.
[41:54] Amen. Father, we thank you for
[41:59] uh the opportunity to be able to give
[42:01] back to you as you have given to us. And
[42:04] we trust Lord Jesus that um you would
[42:07] use this for the furtherance of your
[42:09] kingdom. We also God want to just ask
[42:13] that you would as we give that you would
[42:19] manifest your word on behalf of your
[42:21] people because you said that if we
[42:24] brought our tithing and our offering uh
[42:27] into the house of the Lord. You gave us
[42:30] a promise that you would rebuke the
[42:34] devour for our sake. Not only would you
[42:36] do that, you said that you would open up
[42:39] the windows of heaven. Oh yes.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; And that you would pour out a blessing
[42:44] &gt;&gt; where we have room, not enough to
[42:45] receive. And and God, I know that as
[42:48] we're approaching the meetings, um many
[42:51] are being attacked in their finances.
[42:53] So, Father, this morning, we're asking
[42:55] for that release as you promised it in
[42:59] your word. And we know uh we know that
[43:02] you don't fail. Not in your word. every
[43:04] promise you made, the prophet told us
[43:06] that you would bankrupt heaven
[43:08] &gt;&gt; uh before your word would fall to the
[43:10] ground. So Lord, we ask and we know that
[43:12] it's nothing but the enemy that is
[43:14] trying to block the people from their
[43:15] blessings. So Father, this morning we
[43:18] come with the authority of the word of
[43:20] the Lord. We rebuke the devil.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you say what we bind on
[43:25] earth shall be bound in heaven and what
[43:27] we loose on earth shall be loosed in
[43:30] heaven. So we loose the flow of
[43:32] finances.
[43:34] Even right now in the name of Jesus, we
[43:36] loose it in every home. We loose it in
[43:39] everyone that desires to come to these
[43:41] meetings. We loose it right now in the
[43:43] name of Jesus. And God, we're expecting
[43:46] to see and hear great things in Jesus
[43:49] name we pray. Amen. Amen.
[43:56] Praise the Lord. Amen. Couple things I
[43:58] just need to make mention of. Um on
[44:03] Tuesday night, brothers were in prayer
[44:05] and um I believe brother Maris had
[44:09] mentioned he says you know I just have
[44:10] this strong burden to pray for brother
[44:13] Jean obvious you all know brother Jean
[44:15] had a stroke tends there at rapture
[44:18] faith um tabernacle and he had a stroke
[44:21] and a few of us brothers went to visit
[44:24] him um in the hospital a few I guess a
[44:27] few months ago and um so brother Maris
[44:30] said I just I haven't heard about what's
[44:32] going on with him. We just I just feel
[44:35] led that we should pray for him. I said,
[44:36] "Okay, brother." So, we put him on the
[44:38] prayer list that night and we prayed.
[44:40] And I want to say two days later, I got
[44:44] a telephone call from Brother Jean.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[44:50] Amen.
[44:52] And Brother Jean told me to tell the
[44:54] church, "Thank you for praying." Uh he
[44:57] says he's been totally healed.
[45:02] [Music]
[45:05] Oh, won't he do it?
[45:09] &gt;&gt; And um so he just wanted the church to
[45:11] know that he's doing much better. Uh his
[45:14] I could hear him very clearly. His
[45:16] speech was not slurred in any way. And
[45:19] uh but he said God had totally healed
[45:21] him and he's doing doing very well. So
[45:22] he's back home. He's no longer in the
[45:25] hospital. He's back home and and just uh
[45:27] getting getting about with life. So, we
[45:29] thank God for touching brother J.
[45:33] We certainly thank God for touching him.
[45:35] So, good to have uh Brother Steven and
[45:38] Sister Rachel in there with us on today.
[45:42] Praise the Lord.
[45:44] Amen. And and I have a a thank you. Um
[45:48] thank you very much that I want to read
[45:50] to you all. Um, it says to my SAT
[45:54] family, thank you for your prayers and
[45:58] continued support. Uh, every prayer was
[46:01] deeply felt and appreciated. It's
[46:04] comforting to know that we have a team
[46:06] of prayer warriors to help us through
[46:08] some of the the hardest moments of our
[46:11] lives. Uh, your requests
[46:14] have met God's ears and has and he has
[46:18] answered them. We are excited to soon
[46:22] introduce you all to Baby Thunderberg.
[46:27] [Applause]
[46:43] Heat
[46:46] [Applause]
[46:57] up
[47:06] here.
[47:08] [Music]
[47:18] [Music]
[47:29] Heat. Heat.
[47:34] [Music]
[47:36] [Applause]
[47:48] [Applause]
[47:49] [Music]
[47:53] the uh man brothers
[47:56] was just sharing with me
[47:59] that he uh he sat down there in the
[48:01] chair this morning and Uh, he just wrote
[48:05] on an envelope. He He showed it to me.
[48:08] See, he wrote it on an envelope. Sister
[48:10] Rachel's going to have a baby.
[48:14] They didn't even know.
[48:20] [Music]
[48:23] It says, "Thank you for being on this
[48:25] faith journey with us. Looking forward
[48:27] to celebrating this new life with you
[48:29] soon. Love the funies." Um, I was um
[48:35] reminded of a um a dream that one of the
[48:41] brothers had here and he shared with me
[48:46] could have been a couple years ago. I I
[48:48] don't we have to go back and get the
[48:50] date now. But he had told me uh there
[48:53] was two things in this dream that that
[48:55] that happened. He said we were the first
[48:58] thing I remember he says we weren't at
[49:00] this church. We were somewhere else. We
[49:03] were we were in in a service but we
[49:05] weren't here. We were somewhere else.
[49:08] And he said I turned and I looked and he
[49:10] said I and I saw Sister Rachel with a
[49:12] bump.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; That's that's what he told me.
[49:19] So it's uh I think it's nothing but the
[49:23] uh plan of God
[49:25] &gt;&gt; because he in the dream there were two
[49:27] things happened. We had moved
[49:30] &gt;&gt; and Sister Rachel had a bump.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; So y'all see over the bump and y'all
[49:36] know we got to move.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; So it's it's this is nothing but God.
[49:45] Nothing but God. Right. and uh we we
[49:49] celebrate with brother Steven and sister
[49:51] Rachel. Uh I believe this is year seven
[49:54] for their marriage. Um and we have all
[49:58] been on this journey together. Um I know
[50:01] last year we went to London and when we
[50:04] went there um had a prayer line for
[50:08] especially for those that were not
[50:10] conceiving and um and God has answered.
[50:13] Uh God has answered. So ask that you
[50:16] continue to keep uh them in your prayers
[50:19] that everything will go well. But with
[50:21] this confirmation this morning from
[50:23] brother Capers, not even knowing,
[50:26] &gt;&gt; right? Uh we know everything going to be
[50:28] all right.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; We know everything going to be all
[50:31] right.
[50:33] We know everything going to be all
[50:35] right. So praise God.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; Ain't God good?
[50:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:44] I just saw you shout.

[50:57] &gt;&gt; Now I know what's inside you.
[51:00] [Applause]
[51:03] &gt;&gt; I know what's inside you.
[51:05] [Music]
[51:12] &gt;&gt; God is good.

[51:46] different paths God allowed us to
[51:48] reconnect. And I was in Jamaica a few
[51:52] years ago and and he and I preached some
[51:55] meetings together in Jamaica. And then

[1:12:46] like that. They always thank God for
[1:12:47] what God will do in future but they fail

[1:13:22] said in first chapter 4, he said that

[1:13:55] Corinthians chapter 15, he said, I show
[1:13:58] you a mystery. That's what he's saying.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; He said, we all shall not sleep,
[1:14:01] otherwise we that are alive here will
[1:14:03] not prevent those that have slept.

[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, but he did not reveal the
[1:14:31] mystery. Paul did not reveal the mystery
[1:14:33] of the translation.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Now, but revealed the mystery of this
[1:14:36] rapture to you and I.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. For he said, "Three things
[1:14:40] happened as the Lord descend out of
[1:14:42] heaven." Are you following? He said, "A
[1:14:45] shout, the voice of the archangel, and
[1:14:48] the trump of God, and the Lord does all
[1:14:51] three of them as he is descending."
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Did you get it?

[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now a shout. Jesus does all three
[1:15:12] of them.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; When he is descending,
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; are you following?
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; As he's coming down, a shout went forth.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; He descended voice went out descending.
[1:15:23] Then the trump of God. Don't forget that
[1:15:26] he's not stepping his feet on the earth.
[1:15:27] It is you and I is going to meet him in
[1:15:29] the cloud.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are going up to meet him in the
[1:15:32] cloud.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; So he said a shout. What is a shout?
[1:15:37] It's a message. Now, the prophet telling
[1:15:39] us what it is. It's a message going
[1:15:41] forth. Amen. First, the living bread of
[1:15:44] life bringing forth the bride.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; Did you get that?
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; A shout, a message getting the people
[1:15:52] ready.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you get that? So, you see, uh,
[1:15:57] where we are right now, we are believers
[1:15:59] of this end time message,
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; We can stand for that.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. that will believe the message. Are
[1:16:05] you getting me? And this message, you
[1:16:07] know what it is? It called us out
[1:16:09] because Abraham said that we are taken
[1:16:12] into the mystery of the seven seal
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; which is the mystery of the going away.

[1:17:14] you're wearing a wedding bound
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; of predestination.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; That's what he said.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; And the amazing grace of God.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; The devil can't touch that.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; The enemy can't touch that.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; Corruption know his own.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you see get not ready. Then the
[1:17:31] second is the voice of the resurrection.
[1:17:34] Do you get that? Second, the voice of
[1:17:36] the resurrection. Now he said the same
[1:17:39] voice the loud voice. Amen. That in St.

[1:18:04] Lazarus sleep. Amen. Then they said
[1:18:08] that, "Well, if you sleep, you do well."
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because they don't understand what
[1:18:12] he's talking about. They said, "Well,
[1:18:14] let me speak to their language." They
[1:18:16] said, "Well, our friend Lazarus, Amen,
[1:18:19] is dead,
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; right?"
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; And they said, "Then let us go and die
[1:18:22] with him.
[1:18:23] Let's go and die with him." Right.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; But Jesus said, "Let us go and wake him
[1:18:27] up."
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Right.

[1:18:32] trip. Amen. And when they get get into
[1:18:35] the city, here come master matter how he
[1:18:38] came. As she came in and said, "Uh,
[1:18:41] master, uh, if you have been here, your
[1:18:44] friend Lazarus would have died."
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; Don't forget, we are his friends.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; We are Jesus friends.

[1:18:54] Lazarus will have died. Said but even
[1:18:56] now Lord whatever you ask the father he

[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; And Matthew say yes I believe that they
[1:19:11] shall live again at the resurrection of
[1:19:13] the dead. You see he postponed the
[1:19:15] promise and but Jesus said I am the
[1:19:17] resurrection.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; I am the life.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right.

[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; I get to that place there. You see that
[1:19:28] the condition of Lazarus that is why you
[1:19:30] see that's the same condition of the
[1:19:32] church today.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know Lazarus was already
[1:19:36] burned in grave clothes and then sealed
[1:19:39] up in the tomb. They cut him out of
[1:19:41] fellowship.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Seal the tomb says it's hopeless on
[1:19:46] Lazarus.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; He can't make it again. Praise God. You
[1:19:50] know sometimes the devil can try to get
[1:19:52] you know our family, our children, wife,
[1:19:54] husband, all kind of things around us,
[1:19:56] put circumstances around us and make it
[1:19:58] like as if impossible situation. But let
[1:20:00] me tell you the devil is only playing
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; with time. Are you following? But at the
[1:20:06] appointed time, the devil can stop that.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; No matter what it is,
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; your loved one will be there.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; That is the promise that God gave. He
[1:20:15] said, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:20:17] and thou shalt be saved.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Thee and thy house."
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; Did you say that?
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Did he say that?
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. And as I said, and they and their
[1:20:29] offsprings shall be dead.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; He said that.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; So your sons and daughters, your wife
[1:20:35] cannot miss it.
[1:20:38] Amen.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; I believe
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; many of times we think that well no they
[1:20:44] can they cannot be they cannot make it.
[1:20:46] After the sister came to meet Abraham he
[1:20:48] said brother Bill he said my husband is
[1:20:51] not a seed of God.
[1:20:54] Abraham said why do you say that? He

[1:20:58] husband. I've witness to her to him but
[1:21:02] he just wouldn't believe. There's
[1:21:03] nothing in him to believe. He said I I
[1:21:06] have prayed and prayed and there's
[1:21:08] nothing nothing happening. Uh my husband
[1:21:12] I think that he's a serpent seed.

[1:21:31] hand in hand in a million. You and your
[1:21:33] husband holy hand in hand in the

[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; It shall be there. Your wife shall be
[1:21:45] there. Your husband shall be there. Your
[1:21:48] sons and daughters shall be there.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; Nothing's going to stop there.

[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Say roll take off the tomb. Roll the
[1:22:09] tombs. Take it off. The stone. Roll that
[1:22:12] stone away. Praise God. And mother say,
[1:22:15] "Oh master, behold his stink.
[1:22:19] Behold his stinker. The situation is too
[1:22:21] bad. Taking the stone off it just the
[1:22:25] whole place will be disaster. Said
[1:22:26] behold stink. We shouldn't do that."
[1:22:29] Amen. And Jesus said, "Take off that
[1:22:32] tomb off
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; because I need fellowship now."
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; They have cut Lazarus off for 4 days out
[1:22:38] of fellowship.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; Say, "I need a fellowship now."
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Roll that stone.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; And they rolled the stone. Amen. You can
[1:22:45] see Jesus stand there and he look at the
[1:22:47] grave. And Abraham said if Jesus did not
[1:22:49] mention the name of Lazarus, he said all
[1:22:52] the dead in that place will have raised
[1:22:53] up
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; because he's the resurrectional life.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; He said Lazarus Glory.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; And Lazarus who have been fellowship,
[1:23:00] Amen, right in eternity with them,
[1:23:02] Abraham and the rest of them, he heard
[1:23:04] his name.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; And it was a friend that is calling.
[1:23:08] Amen. It was a familiar voice.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, if you're not familiar
[1:23:13] with the voice of the archangel,
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; with the voice of the resurrection,
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; you cannot answer your name.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; It must be a familiar voice,
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; with a familiar message,
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; with a familiar word.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; Do you get that?
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. That is why Abraham said,
[1:23:30] "How can a bride, Amen, identify her
[1:23:33] mate?"
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; How can she identify a mate? Except he's
[1:23:36] constantly on the word.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; You get a church. Amen. You must be
[1:23:41] familiar with that voice, the word, the
[1:23:43] voice word.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; So Lazarus was familiar with that voice
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; and he answer his name. He cut off the
[1:23:49] service and he came back. And we see
[1:23:52] that the Bible said a man that has been
[1:23:54] wrapped with grape clothes wrapped
[1:23:55] around lie on the grave that must stood
[1:23:58] up. Praise God. And a power pick him up
[1:24:03] to the door of the grave.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Are you following?
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said lose him and let him go.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; Say lose him and let him go. And I'm
[1:24:12] saying this morning, whatever that ab
[1:24:14] bound you, whatever situation you find
[1:24:17] yourself, I speak to you in the name of
[1:24:20] the Lord, Satan, loose them and let them
[1:24:23] go.
[1:24:25] Loose them and let them go. Let them go
[1:24:29] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:24:32] [Applause]
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; Let me see there.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; God. Amen.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; Said the voice of the archangel, the
[1:24:46] voice of the resurrection raise the dead
[1:24:49] sea to be caught up with him.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; So he was not telling us in question and
[1:24:55] answer
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; as we move on question and answer is the
[1:24:59] first thing happen when we are
[1:25:01] resurrected. Right

[1:25:08] that happen the one which are sleeping

[1:25:24] will set in first. Amen. Then the
[1:25:27] resurrection of those that are asleep.
[1:25:30] There will be awakening time.
[1:25:33] Amen. And those which are sleep in the
[1:25:37] dust now, not those who are sleeping in
[1:25:39] sin. Are you following? Cuz they will
[1:25:42] sleep right on.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; They don't Amen. They don't awake for
[1:25:46] another thousand years. The foolishness
[1:25:49] of them say but those who are sleeping
[1:25:51] in the doors will be awake first.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Are you following?
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. They we awake first and they
[1:26:00] this corrupt corruptible bodies will put
[1:26:03] on incorruption.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. We put on incorruption. We put on
[1:26:08] incorruption in the rapturing grace of
[1:26:10] the Lord. Do you see that? In the
[1:26:13] rapturing grace of the Lord.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; And then we will all get together.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; With the resurrected sent.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; That's right. And when they begin to get
[1:26:25] together said then we which are alive
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; and remain shall be changed

[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. After the water baptism and then

[1:34:52] looking for Phillip
[1:34:54] said where is brother Phillip. I thought
[1:34:56] the man told me his name is called
[1:34:57] Phillip said where are you Philip?
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; He said is he a human being that
[1:35:04] baptized me or a spirit baptized me.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; This man could have gone to Ethopia
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; and testifying that if Philip bapt a
[1:35:11] spirit baptized him and the name of the
[1:35:13] spirit is called Philip.
[1:35:17] Praise God.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; I know Abraham called that
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; Abraham called that redemption by power.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.

[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Redemption by power.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; She don't you don't need to debate
[1:35:29] because the angel interrupted the
[1:35:31] revival.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; Say go Philip go that go and meet that
[1:35:33] you know.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; And the Bible said the spirit caught him
[1:35:38] and he was found in Aatos.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; No transport fair.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; There's no char to ride. Amen.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; He found himself in Aats preaching the
[1:35:45] gospel.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; A thought was he traveled like a with a
[1:35:49] thought
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; and God have displayed that before. So
[1:35:53] it wasn't strange for Philip to believe
[1:35:54] that because no example like Enoch like
[1:35:58] Enoch walked with God. The Bible say it
[1:35:59] wasn't found.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. But he had a testimony they please
[1:36:02] God.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. You remember you remember Elijah
[1:36:05] Elijah on Mount Car camel. Praise God.
[1:36:08] When Elijah went before Ahab and tired
[1:36:10] of all the behavior of all these
[1:36:13] Israelites and so forth, you know,
[1:36:15] Elijah was be was tired of it because
[1:36:18] Jezebel has went out with scholarship
[1:36:20] and he has awarded the young people
[1:36:22] scholarship for sending to the Bible
[1:36:23] school and they have overrun the city
[1:36:26] and convert the whole Israel to Edenism
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; until Elijah thought that he was the
[1:36:30] only one left.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; That's exactly the only one alone.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Right. And you see Elijah he was tired
[1:36:37] of the system and he went to meet Ahab
[1:36:39] met Ahab there. Amen. I said Ahab said
[1:36:43] well I'm in here for a business as a son
[1:36:46] of God. I said okay what do you want?
[1:36:48] Said let me tell you.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; So as I'm standing here there will be no
[1:36:52] doom.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; There will be no rain.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; Until I Elijah call for it.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; And they took the key of binding like
[1:37:02] the Bible said whatever you bind on
[1:37:03] earth. Even as you are sitting here, you
[1:37:05] can bind.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; Whatever you lose on, it shall be loose.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; And Elijah got a hold of that key of
[1:37:12] binding
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; and he lock up the heavens and put the
[1:37:14] key in his pocket.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; And Elijah went away.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. The same authority is you have the
[1:37:22] same power.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; You having the same anointing because
[1:37:25] this Elijah's message.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; You are Elijah's believer.
[1:37:30] You see, you have the key, the same key
[1:37:33] that Elijah used.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; Amenise God. Amen.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; Elijah walked his way down.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; And we found out there was no rain.
[1:37:41] There was no due was looking for rain
[1:37:45] and looking for due and you know and
[1:37:47] called the Bon Bon you got to pray
[1:37:49] because God need to give us rain. You
[1:37:51] can't imagine them praying for three and
[1:37:52] a half years. No rain and no due. We are
[1:37:55] seeking the face of the Lord. You know
[1:37:57] God have to answer them. So I don't
[1:37:59] understand why you are praying for rain.
[1:38:01] I asking me to give you rain. I don't I
[1:38:03] I don't hold the rain.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; I'm not the one that hold the rain.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Say it's Elijah that hold the
[1:38:08] rain.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; If you look for Elijah,
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; that is why Ahab was looking for Elijah.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; Because the prophet have said the Elijah
[1:38:19] hold the key of heaven.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; So you look for Elijah.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; Then you can have rain.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. I can say Elijah came came down
[1:38:28] there and then called them for I man
[1:38:32] and then with this this message we bring
[1:38:34] the bride and the world council of
[1:38:36] churches to a manion showdown.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; You see that
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; it will be a showdown between the bride
[1:38:43] and the big system.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; They cannot say that to watch the third
[1:38:47] then when the press come down watch that
[1:38:50] then
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; do you see that?
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:55] And they took Elijah down. Elijah have
[1:38:57] the children called the fire down. Of
[1:38:58] course, you know the story. And he said,
[1:39:00] Ahab said, "Come on now, you run, guide
[1:39:02] up thyself. Rain bid not for I hear a
[1:39:05] sound of abundant of rain."
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; And Ahab enter into the charot and begin
[1:39:10] to drown in speed while Elijah was on
[1:39:12] Mount Camel. Are you getting it church?
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; It was on Mount Camel with an acrobatic
[1:39:16] prayers. Praise God. At the end of the
[1:39:19] prayer as El as Ahab ran down to the
[1:39:21] gate of Jezrael, Elijah was standing at
[1:39:24] the gate of Jezrael
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; waiting for Ahab.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; Elijah that he left on man camel.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; And there he was there standing at the
[1:39:32] gate of Jezrael.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Something must have
[1:39:35] happened.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Elijah was translated
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; from up from camel down to the gate of
[1:39:40] Jezrael.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; That same anointing is upon your life
[1:39:43] now. Not shall be, not will be. I said
[1:39:46] now. Now faith is
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; hallelujah. Do you believe that?
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; Now faith is
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; a substance of things so far.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; You think that in this rapture God is
[1:40:04] looking at you?
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; God is not looking at you.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; God looking at his word.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; Abraham told us in the message, I will
[1:40:12] certainly return to thee according to
[1:40:13] time of life. He told us what happened
[1:40:15] there. Amen. He said when when when when
[1:40:19] Sarah was waiting for that promise just
[1:40:21] like you're waiting for the promise of
[1:40:22] the rapture now.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. To receive that son. He said but
[1:40:26] Sarah was you know was all filled with
[1:40:28] with wrinkles of unbelief all kind of
[1:40:30] ideas and you know she was so depressed
[1:40:32] with all kind of thought
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; because of the circumstance of his body
[1:40:36] of her body.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; say all said all that s look was a look
[1:40:41] at the caravans that were coming from
[1:40:43] Egypt and they're going to Sodom and
[1:40:46] they was Mrs. Lot caravan fashion and
[1:40:48] fashion and so forth materials that are
[1:40:50] going forth and and Sarah will look at
[1:40:53] them when I hit Abraham say can you see
[1:40:57] it again can you see the caravan going
[1:40:59] now this is a new set of heat that is
[1:41:01] going now in Todd you see it Mrs. slot
[1:41:04] caravan. Can you see it? We cannot be
[1:41:06] sustained on this mountain like that.
[1:41:08] Have I been established or what's
[1:41:10] happening to me? Abra, can't you see
[1:41:12] that?
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Praise God. So, was brooding daily until
[1:41:15] he missed the visiting of angels. When
[1:41:17] the angels came down, three angels came
[1:41:19] down. You see, Lot did not receive three
[1:41:22] angels coming to them.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; But Abraham and Sarah received three
[1:41:26] angels
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; that came down to Abraham. And Abraham,
[1:41:30] Amen, could see because he had the
[1:41:32] vision. Yes,
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; Pastor Abraham. Praise God. He's a
[1:41:36] preacher. We shall be raptured.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sarah, we shall be changed. Sarah,
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; we have a son. Sarah,
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; praise God. I said, when will that end?
[1:41:44] Every service we shall have a son. We
[1:41:46] shall be raptured. Every service. When
[1:41:48] will the rapture take place? This about
[1:41:50] 20 years now. We be talking. We shall
[1:41:51] have a rapture.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; 25 years now. Abraham, 25 years now.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; Abra said, "Honey, don't worry. We shall
[1:41:59] have we shall have that son. We shall be
[1:42:00] raptured."
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; Praise God. So Rabam said she was
[1:42:04] brooding. Sarah was brooding until he
[1:42:06] missed the angel sitting down there. He
[1:42:08] looked them like ordinary men. Are you
[1:42:10] getting me church?
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. And she was in a tent after
[1:42:13] preparing their meal. And and these men
[1:42:15] were having conversation with with
[1:42:17] Abraham. And Abraham said, "Where is
[1:42:19] your wife Sarah?" Amen. Elohim said,
[1:42:22] "Where's your wife Sarah?" Abraham,
[1:42:24] "Where's your wife?" He said, "Oh, she's
[1:42:26] behind the tent. She's in our place."
[1:42:29] They said, "Oh, uh, I will come to you
[1:42:33] and Sarah, your wife shall have a son."
[1:42:35] Amen. I said, "I had it right in a
[1:42:38] tent." And the Bible say, she laughed.
[1:42:40] She smiled
[1:42:42] in her sleeve. What did she say? Said,
[1:42:45] "Can I of a shorty have a son at this
[1:42:49] old age? Look at my condition. How can I
[1:42:52] look at what I am faced? Look at all my
[1:42:54] circumstance. Look at what I'm facing in
[1:42:56] life. All this difficulties and so
[1:42:57] forth. Did God really love me?
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; Praise God. If God love me, why should
[1:43:02] this thing be happening this way happen?
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; How can I how will I have pleasure with
[1:43:08] my husband and my husband being old
[1:43:09] also?
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; Actually, naturally they are pastbearing
[1:43:13] time.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; She has a reason to doubt that.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And Elohim called Sarah
[1:43:19] said, "Come up Sarah."
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; Abraham said, "Why did your wife Sarah
[1:43:23] laugh?"
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I said I jumped out. He
[1:43:27] said, "Who laughed?"
[1:43:30] Uh, who laughed? Said, "Abraham, you
[1:43:33] were there. You You are here. Do you
[1:43:35] hear me laugh?" And actually Abraham
[1:43:37] never heard her laugh.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; The Bible say she laughs. She smile.
[1:43:43] Honey, do you have me laugh?
[1:43:45] I never laugh. And Elohim say, "You
[1:43:47] laugh." I said, I said, "No, I never
[1:43:49] laugh." Elo said, "No, you laugh." You
[1:43:52] can see the conversation
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; an unbelief conversation.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; Can you see that church?
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; Now Abraham said God could have kissed
[1:43:58] Sarah instantly
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; because Sarah was making God a liar.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; Are you following church? But God
[1:44:05] bypassed Sarah's circumstance. He said
[1:44:07] that is how God bypassed the church.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; Are you following?
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; He said if God will ever send his power
[1:44:14] to the church is it will not be on their
[1:44:17] merit.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; It will be by the grace of God. Amen.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; Are you getting me church?
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; Say because
[1:44:26] Isaiah prophesied, he say, "Oh, the way
[1:44:28] finished over said, but yet he said
[1:44:31] Jerusalem was guilty of sin." Are you
[1:44:34] getting me church?
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; So, but God has wiped away our weakness.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; So, the same God is taking the message
[1:44:41] of William and is dealing with the
[1:44:43] faithful.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; Are you getting me church?
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; He's dealing with the faithful. those
[1:44:49] who believe
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; who really believe in him like Abraham
[1:44:53] are you getting me like Sarah
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; are you following so he's not counting
[1:44:57] the circumstance at which is find
[1:44:59] herself he look at Abraham he said are
[1:45:02] we certain double sure
[1:45:05] return unto thee according to the time
[1:45:08] of life
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; and Sarah shall have a son
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; right
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; that's right
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; nothing could stop that
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; that's right
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; because the next day Amen the last 20 uh
[1:45:19] uh 28 days you find that Elohim returned
[1:45:22] back not in the form of a man
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; right
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; not an angel coming back not a return
[1:45:28] ministry of some man
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; are you getting me church
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; but it was the spirit dynamics of God
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; exactly
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; that came down upon Sarah
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; and change Sarah's body
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; change Abraham's body

[1:46:00] time. Yes. It also said we will ride
[1:46:03] this one more time.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; And then on the wings of his wife say
[1:46:09] and she will turn west.

[1:46:29] take one and run away.

[1:46:38] of his power

[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; Now God did not send mechanical device
[1:47:05] to preach the gospel.

[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; Fivefold ministry.

[1:47:54] sound and the dead in Christ shall rise
[1:47:56] first. We which are alive and remain
[1:47:58] shall be caught up together with them."
[1:48:02] Now here is the order. He said, "Meet

[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He said we will meet one

[2:02:49] in this age than even in Jesus age.

[2:05:54] prison. He locked them up in the prison
[2:05:57] and waited to deal with them the next
[2:05:59] day. But when they sent for them they
[2:06:01] couldn't find them. Praise God. They got
[2:06:04] there. The prison doors were actually
[2:06:06] locked.
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the soldiers were there still
[2:06:08] standing waiting. Are you getting me?
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; In position.
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; But opening the door, they couldn't find
[2:06:16] those who locked.
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; What happened? That was the quickening
[2:06:20] power

[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; Either they could have long gone in the
[2:06:47] rapture
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; but they have to wait for us.

[2:07:43] praying?
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; Calling not God.
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; All right.

[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; I walk around the land
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; and I possess it.
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; I quote the scripture. I will possess
[2:09:24] the gate of my enemies.
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; So whatever the soul of my feet are
[2:09:28] tread upon, you give to me as an
[2:09:29] inheritance. I it
[2:09:31] &gt;&gt; amen.
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; So I went to I told the guy said look I
[2:09:35] need it and I will need this land. Tell
[2:09:36] you the owner of the land.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; So I went home. So and somebody came to
[2:09:40] buy the land but they said no they
[2:09:41] cannot buy you cannot sell it. So they
[2:09:43] couldn't sell the land because I have
[2:09:45] already put my feet on it.
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:09:53] &gt;&gt; So the man I was now facing a
[2:09:54] circumstance the owner of the land say
[2:09:57] wanted money. Then he called uh my
[2:10:00] friend who was selling the land. He said
[2:10:02] my friend please he said that they is a
[2:10:04] buyer that wanted to buy the land.
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; My friend said yes let us go and see
[2:10:07] him. I was in the just sitting in the
[2:10:10] house. He just they came. So I said the
[2:10:13] man said, "Are you the one that want to
[2:10:15] buy my land?" I said, "Yes, I am the one
[2:10:17] that want to buy your land." He said,
[2:10:19] "Well, are you ready with the money
[2:10:21] now?" I said, "Well, you you just came
[2:10:24] now."
[2:10:27] Just came now. And you asked him about,
[2:10:29] "Am I ready with the money now?" He
[2:10:31] said, "We don't do things that way
[2:10:33] because a man has a plan."
[2:10:35] &gt;&gt; I said, "So you don't work like that."
[2:10:37] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; He said, "Then what do you have?" I said
[2:10:40] I only have the land was about 160,000.
[2:10:44] I said I only have only 60,000. He said
[2:10:46] give it to me.
[2:10:47] [Laughter]
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; So give it to me now.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; So when I gave him the the 60,000 he
[2:10:54] wrote a receipt for it. He said when
[2:10:56] will I come and take my balance? I said
[2:10:57] come January 25th. You come January
[2:11:00] 25th. It was December that time that
[2:11:01] time.
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; So I said Lord I thank you. I've got a
[2:11:06] receipt. Amen.
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; This is this is the earliest now. That's
[2:11:09] right.
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; The down payment
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; I've taken that place. No man can take
[2:11:13] it again.
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; So by the end of December, you now came
[2:11:17] to my house and knock at my door. I
[2:11:18] said, "Okay,
[2:11:20] fine." He said, "Yes, I've come to
[2:11:22] collect the money." I said, "Well, this
[2:11:24] is not our agreement." We say 25th of
[2:11:26] January. Why you coming now?
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; He said, "I needed money to buy keys." I
[2:11:30] said, "Sorry, what I have now is
[2:11:32] 40,000." He said, "Give it to me."
[2:11:35] So I gave it to him and he went. You see
[2:11:38] this eye? I took the money. I was paying
[2:11:39] it 20,000 splitting the money until I
[2:11:42] just finished paying the money. And the
[2:11:44] land become my land.
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; And that is where I build my church

[2:12:19] it." I said, I said, "Then you buy it,

[2:18:59] to them of how God take cancer off.
[2:19:02] Amen. Of the breast and so forth after
[2:19:04] praying in Oscar's church in Louisville,
[2:19:07] Kentucky. So and uh this sister it
[2:19:10] happened that he was having a a tumor a
[2:19:14] grunt in the breast. So and she went to
[2:19:16] the doctor and the doctor examined it
[2:19:19] and uh they told her that well uh they
[2:19:22] say cancer and that they will have to
[2:19:24] operate it.
[2:19:26] So the sister came from out of the

[2:19:30] have an issue. I said what is that? He
[2:19:35] said, "Pastor,

[2:19:45] go to the hospital today and the doctor
[2:19:47] said it is cancer and they need to
[2:19:50] operate it, remove it." So uh now I
[2:19:53] don't have morning.
[2:19:56] I don't know what to do to go in
[2:19:58] operation. I said, "You don't have
[2:20:00] money?" Say, "Yes." I said, "But do you
[2:20:02] have Jesus?"
[2:20:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Mhm.
[2:20:05] &gt;&gt; Do you have Jesus?
[2:20:07] &gt;&gt; He said yes. I said but Jesus will
[2:20:10] charge you without money, without price.
[2:20:11] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:20:12] &gt;&gt; You don't have to pay nothing for to
[2:20:13] Jesus.
[2:20:14] &gt;&gt; He will do it.
[2:20:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:20:15] &gt;&gt; Why do you cry? You don't have money. If
[2:20:16] you don't have money, you got to consult
[2:20:18] Jesus Christ.
[2:20:19] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:20:20] &gt;&gt; He said I said do you believe? He said
[2:20:22] yes. I said let us pray. Then we prayed.
[2:20:26] So on the day that we go and collect the
[2:20:28] result for the the test result, he went
[2:20:31] it was he went there and he called me
[2:20:33] and say pastor he said shall I go to the
[2:20:35] hospital? I said yes go there go and

[2:20:43] everything.
[2:20:43] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen.
[2:20:45] &gt;&gt; So she went and she sat down on the
[2:20:47] waiting room waiting for the with the
[2:20:49] patient other patients waiting for the
[2:20:51] doctor. So the doctor started attending
[2:20:53] to each of the patient. So attend to
[2:20:56] them. So and uh from morning till
[2:20:59] evening to about 4:30 she had not been
[2:21:02] called and all all other patients had
[2:21:06] been called. So you had to approach a
[2:21:08] nurse who was in attendant said sir ma I
[2:21:12] have been sitting here since morning and
[2:21:14] they have not called me. Why they have
[2:21:16] called others I'm the only one left.
[2:21:17] Why? So not say oh sorry she now went in
[2:21:21] to meet the doctor and I said sir uh
[2:21:25] there's a lady out there that you have
[2:21:27] not called.
[2:21:28] So doctor said no I've I've attended to
[2:21:31] all patient there's no patient that I
[2:21:33] have not called. So there was an
[2:21:35] argument. The doctor said, "Look at it.
[2:21:37] Look at all my record. I have attended
[2:21:39] to all the patient. Nobody's out there.
[2:21:40] Nobody's nobody that is left." And the
[2:21:44] the
[2:21:46] lady went out and met his sister
[2:21:48] outside. I said, "Woman, the doctor has
[2:21:50] attended to you." But as I said,
[2:21:52] everybody said what are you what what
[2:21:54] are you doing here? She said, "No, the
[2:21:57] doctor has not attended to me."
[2:22:00] So I said, "What is your name?" He said
[2:22:03] her name is uh lovelin.
[2:22:06] So uh the nurse went in he said sir that
[2:22:11] lady named the lady out there name is

[2:29:51] from now to the resurrection is not in

[2:30:12] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[2:30:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:30:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. But many of times it's just fear
[2:30:17] that trouble us
[2:30:19] &gt;&gt; and the power of God is just dearly dat.
[2:30:24] But we are afraid to speak it. We are
[2:30:26] afraid to ask after it. But sometime we
[2:30:29] pray and then we think that God doesn't
[2:30:34] answer prayer.
[2:30:36] Amen.
[2:30:37] Andraham said that if you come to church
[2:30:43] with a problem, with a need,
[2:30:46] &gt;&gt; with a desire,
[2:30:47] &gt;&gt; yeah,
[2:30:47] &gt;&gt; and then you go home the same way you
[2:30:50] come.
[2:30:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said you have insulted God.
[2:31:00] &gt;&gt; For you to go home the way you come,
[2:31:02] &gt;&gt; you said God is not able to do it. Oh
[2:31:05] my.
[2:31:06] &gt;&gt; You just insult God.
[2:31:08] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[2:31:13] &gt;&gt; Now look at this uh demon of Gadra
[2:31:18] that Jesus crossed over this cl and they
[2:31:21] went to Gadra and that brother was bound
[2:31:25] with legion.
[2:31:27] He was in the tomb and the Bible said no
[2:31:30] man could tame him.
[2:31:32] Are you getting me? But when Jesus
[2:31:35] stepped in the coast, amen on that coast
[2:31:38] that day, you know the man look he said
[2:31:42] legion legion demons has invested their
[2:31:45] life in that brother. But despite the
[2:31:48] situation the brand make an advance
[2:31:52] &gt;&gt; and came to meet to came to meet to
[2:31:54] Jesus come to Jesus. But our problem is
[2:31:56] that we don't make any advance at all.
[2:31:59] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:31:59] &gt;&gt; We don't make an attempt to step out to
[2:32:01] meet Jesus.
[2:32:02] &gt;&gt; All right. with that with our situation.
[2:32:06] &gt;&gt; You got to come to God's level.
[2:32:09] &gt;&gt; And then he met Jesus and Jesus
[2:32:13] speak with him. He said, "What is your
[2:32:15] name?" He say, "I am Legion." Demon
[2:32:19] speaking said because we are many.
[2:32:23] We are in charge. We are in control. We
[2:32:26] are many.
[2:32:28] And uh he said but have you come to
[2:32:31] destroy us before our time?
[2:32:34] Said please. Now this demon have to
[2:32:38] write a prayer request.
[2:32:41] &gt;&gt; Are you getting me?
[2:32:42] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:32:43] &gt;&gt; Yes. They write they wrote a prayer
[2:32:45] request.
[2:32:46] &gt;&gt; He said I pray you don't just cast us
[2:32:49] away.
[2:32:50] &gt;&gt; Do you see those swine
[2:32:52] &gt;&gt; that is that pray investment? That man
[2:32:55] has invested so much in that swine.
[2:32:57] said, "But you know he doesn't pay his
[2:32:58] tithe."
[2:33:02] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[2:33:05] &gt;&gt; He doesn't pay his tight.
[2:33:07] &gt;&gt; And he said he will send the devor and
[2:33:09] we are the devorh.
[2:33:12] Oh, he said we send the devil and he
[2:33:13] will devour him. Said then we pray you
[2:33:16] please just let us go there and devour
[2:33:17] that man finish his business. Enter that
[2:33:20] swine and send it to the sleep.
[2:33:22] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And demons demons are
[2:33:25] miserious. But I would ask the question,
[2:33:27] did Jesus answer his prayer?
[2:33:30] &gt;&gt; Did Jesus answer the demon's prayer?
[2:33:32] &gt;&gt; When he prayed, did did Jesus answer his
[2:33:35] prayer?
[2:33:36] &gt;&gt; Then if Jesus could answer a demon
[2:33:38] prayer, what about your prayers?
[2:33:44] &gt;&gt; What about your requests?
[2:33:46] What about your needs? So right now, I
[2:33:49] challenge you now. Whatever you desire
[2:33:52] now, don't insult God. Stand your feet.
