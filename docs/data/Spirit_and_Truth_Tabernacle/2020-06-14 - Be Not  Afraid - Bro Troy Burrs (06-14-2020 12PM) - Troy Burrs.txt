the way we've been doing it via periscope of our Facebook and but we let the Saints those that are above 60 are welcome to come to the service on Wednesday night but everybody else we actually just continued to spring amen those too via one of those two platforms also I know no services on Friday until again for the notice and and Sunday will continue to do 9 a.m. and 12 p.m. as I mentioned before they have they have opened the open up South Florida a little bit more but from what we hear and there's a lot more cases they're actually starting to come to the forefront so again we're just we're just taking our time being a little slow a man with with how we bring everybody back together thus far this has worked and there's been no outbreaks and that's one thing that we want to prevent is outbreaks I know that there's some other churches that are going through amen we want to pray for them amen I know Church a man where the pastor's wife actually has come down with it now the past is not feeling well himself and some of the Saints in the church not feeling well and you know and I heard another about another Saint here in the areas she's about 84 years old and she's also come up with some of some of the symptoms as well and I believe she has a granddaughter that might be in her 20s and she also has some of the symptoms and they're both were leaving comas in the hospital so we just want to pray a man for people and just pray that God continued to be a covering a man around us during this season just trusting God to bring us through all of this amen also if you haven't done already just please download the church app with your with your phone that way you can be on a platform that will be moving to a man shortly the church app is what you get out of your play store and let's just look for a Spirit of Truth Tabernacle also as a reference to our giving a man I wanted to just make mention that we are we made a change here with our the way that we produced the periscope video in the way that we do Facebook we've been able to bring everything into one platform and running off this new computer that was donated to the church and grateful for those that came together and put running together just to buy the computer but we've been able to just kind of bring these things together and we no longer have to use the iPad that we use set up set up here in the middle of the of the floor but we're bringing all together and just trying to improve the experience for those that are online and you know the brothers just kind of brought to my attention a brother Jack there's some things we just need to upgrade and we need to do in order to really make it special and you know we have we have put together a budget and we want to upgrade a camera and some things like that and also there's a piece of equipment that we have purchased that we want to put in place as the stream is going out because kind of the way that I preached I'll be talking soft like this and I was certain my voice to get elevated and so when you're when you're at home and you're watching that sometime I might just blow something away with that but we bought a piece of equipment that would actually just kind of tamper all of that down it will compress that and just make the experience just just real good just kind of balances all of that so it's like a compressor so we have to invest some money into the and to the equipment that we have in order to just keep up with the demands that are out there and and the brothers just gave me a budget say brother Jack we're gonna need about four thousand dollars just to do all the things right for the video side of things that with cameras and and and just a number of things that we need we need about four thousand dollars so I acts a man if you don't mind a men of those that can we accident you just to grab one envelopes off the the table they're a man we have some envelopes sitting and all you got to do is just write for video a man for the video project and just puts you know something there we need about four thousand if if twenty people gave two hundred dollars the four thousand dollars is done just like that if forty people gave a hundred dollars four thousand is done if one person get full thousand it's done but but we just we just want to just present this neat to everyone and those that are joining us online if you'd like to help us with that you can give online a man through cash app you can use a cash app assemble spirit and truth tea and then also if you want to send through PayPal you can just send to a friend or family member and use giving at John four to three dot org as the address that you would send it to just put in a notes that you're giving towards that we have a special account that would put the money in and and we're gonna try to upgrade and make things different for those that are joining us online we don't know how long this is gonna be but I do know this much that the online services will not go away even we all come back together we'll still be doing things online and we just want everything to be very very good for those that are watching and I want to have the best

man a man it's just so good a man be back in the house of the Lord a man I really had a wonderful time this morning we thank the Lord for that if you just grab your Bibles we're going to go straight to the word I wanna amen we'll be reading from Matthew the fourteenth chapter xxvii first a man pray for me yeah and I realized with a quick who was not gonna be here you know I had something that that was already prepared I just I told with it and I just trust and believe that the Lord has led me down this path Amen just trust that it bring comfort to your soul amen I will begin reading our said 27th we'll start from the 22nd verse Amen of Matthew the 14th chapter Amen and straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into his ship and to go before him unto the other side and while he sent the multitude away and when he had sent the multitude away he went up into a mountain apart to pray and when the evening was come he was there alone but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with ways for the wind was contrary and in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were trouble saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear but straightway Jesus spoke unto them saying be of good cheer it is I be not afraid and if I can title this message just have to know what I will title it be not afraid and Peter answered and said unto the Lord if it be thou bid me to come unto thee on the water and he said come and when Peter was come down out of the ship he walked on water to go to Jesus but when he saw the wind the boisterous he was afraid and began to sink and he cried saying lord save me and immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and called him and said unto Him old thou of little faith wherefore wherefore didst thou doubt and when they were come into the ship the wind ceased then they were in the ship came and worshiped him saying of a truth thou art the son of God amen let us pray most gracious God we ask you O Father causes we have the ability to read these words law but only you can make them live Lord we ask you to let us take full control of father God and speak to the heart share people in Jesus name pray amen amen and as we said we want to take this little thought I'm sorry you may be seated take this little thought be not afraid a man we see so much is going on around us so much is happening across the landscape in every aspect of our life and I see I look at the same and and I say what's really going on because it has always an underlying thought here underlying a trick the devil always has and and and I begin to look at some things I begin to look back into the UH until a different movement of similar to this you know when the civil rights movement and and I begin to compare compare some of the key events and and and we looked at the civil rights and and started that with Truman and he put out a building it was just around the time when the Prophet ministry was beginning to gain steam and there we had year-old immaterial and the different things that started to give the the movement a little bit of momentum and all this if you take it no idea who completely compact have it all prepared why can can can take you from date the date I was working on it but I felt that was a little premature but I just want to give you just a basis of it as these things were happening everybody's attention was on or what's going on over here and what's going on over here this movement going on and people protesting and me locking arms in there marching and they're doing all of these things but they fail to see that God had sent a prophet amen the Savior was already coming they were looking for a savior they were looking for a man or someone that would give him a man what they had neither they were looking for someone that was able to give him the blessings a man that they had desire they wanted to be equal but what would they fail to see and we had a minister a man that that no doubt good man but he failed to see the prophets he failed to see what God was really doing there was a savior already here to lead the back the people back to work now after all of the work all of the the the marching all of the protest what did we gain we're here now we're here right now so so what did it what was it really their prophet preached the message what is the attraction on the mouth what is it that CCC when government when God beginning to move what the devil's job is the to to cause a distraction to take your focus away from what God is doing not since I've been alive I've never seen a greater distraction in the day so what I see what's going on today it gives me any cries maybe say well what is God is doing Oh Advent you to say hold on hold on big things are happening we see the Bible says when the devil when Satan comes in like a flood the Spirit of the Lord raises up a standard against it hey man so we see what this is seeing this is evil Oh both sides because this God Jesus was here there was stains but he had nothing to do with those things because he was sick here that wasn't the purpose he was seen here he stayed focused on what his job was he staying focused on the reason that God sent him here to redeem fallen man amen you can't start prophecy you can't protest stop seeing you can't protest morality it takes the Holy Ghost amen it takes the Word of God to change the heart of me I don't care how about how long you March huh you forgot everything don't worry that will be a protesters go burn you go clean it up you make sure you in the Ark if the people would just look to Jesus we see here in the scripture that I read that Peter and the disciples they were in the same type of condition amen they were out on the sea and the one thing that could save them they was afraid of and I want you to tell you that their whole reason amen why people are so tossed about it's all being fear driven this group is afraid this group is afraid everybody is being led by fear but we know God is not the author fear so where is it coming from this is a concerted plot scheme of the enemy to get your mind and your hop what happened he beat Peter to come say blood if you bid me to come now come Peter stepped out in the boat and what happened it was a supernatural thing he failed to recognize oh man if he just kept desires oh Jesus but he took his eyes off Jesus and began to look at the world problems get his mind on the world's problem that's we are in this world but we are not of this world we are not of this world you can't not see believe me I tried and it's horrible I see it things every day every day is something something just our Lord Jesus I can't even go horrible horrible things everybody in an uproar everybody's emotionally worked up emotionally worked up fear both sides from the highest office to the lowest fear so and they ever say that on the scripture here we look at this and it says uh Peter walked on water now the ship was waterlogged the sail was broken the Oz was gone they were holding on to each other screaming the ship was what alone our jobs are in jeopardy we got the pandemic and uh I don't even know what you call this other thing they call it up another pandemic going on at the same time all it takes now is a natural catastrophe we on the brink right on the brink where what we're going to have to at this time is imperative to keep our eyes straight on the world this is the time we've been preparing for to be sure footed to be steadfast amen abounding in the world staying fortified because it is the only thing that's going to hold we said here the ship was water long they're very scenic they were selling it was seeking the very economy that we had hope in and the jobs and our what we call it this deep my Chrissy it's sinking amen the sale was toward amen they had no direction they had no way to steer the ship amen no way to cut no compass tossed about with every wind Amen tossed about amen Oh like a ship without a sail no rudder they had no direction they had no way hey man the oars were gone so in in in in and a ship the sail gives you and if the Salomon now you got but those were gone they will act the complete mercy of the situation the only one that could save them was Jesus the only one that could save them was the Word of God was the only thing a man that they could find some sort of comfort but when it came when Jesus came amen walking on water they feared him they feared him what is it Peter say is that you if that shoe Lord beat me to come and I'll say to you this morning the Lord is beating you to come I say to you this morning those of you that are online the Lord is beating you to come the ship is sinking all hope is gone economy is in trouble politics is done over with amen the Prophet preached a message all this in 55 indictment well he indicted this nation for rejecting the Word of God for rejecting the Word of God it began and I believe it was in oh I can't remember the date now buddy preached invasion of the USA he said through Hollywood amen there was a great invasion decaying the moral fiber of this country it was stunned and he said it was not something from the outside but is the worm at the core the Apple that was going to destroy and you can see now that we're destroying from the is it's not the enemy out there it's our own immorality that's destroying amen now we see here the only hope that we have the only hope and they were afraid of the only thing that could save them a man the prophecy here is that in a true picture of the day say a man they thought it was spooky you know they cried out in fear it's a spirit but you just do like they did when they cry out they heard the voice and the voice said fear not now he was talking to an Alexa you're not I told you to go to the other side I told you to go to the other side fear not be not afraid amen but you just we see that that if you just watch the word of promise for this eight prophecy you'll hear the same voice speaking through his word it's me fear not be not afraid to hit a word of this thing he says I promised to do this in the last days fear not don't be scared put your trust in me the son of God amen if you turn to sister why we are so tossed about 56 Oh 101 paragraphs ix Amen paragraph 79 why we're so tossed about a man if there was ever you know people talk about the Bible days if these in the Bible days I don't know what he if there was another generation another behind this one they were and if they were read this oh my this would be some good reading this would be some good reading going on here amen why we're so talked about 79 now I've noticed many Christians in my life to be up and down I wondered about that and without preaching such a text as this out of the other churches to where I go I thought best to deliver this to my people here at the Tabernacle he says why people are so tossed about you find them people who seem to be very religious seem to have such a deep desire and daily they search and hunt and seek for God and never come to any settlement of any kind to where they could ever be settled and anchored in Christ and this I have learned to be in the experience that it is people of intellectuals amen people of intellectuals now speaking this there are two different types of Christianity seems strange but I would say to you different types I'll say different phases would be better word to use - not two types but two different is the same Christianity but two phases of it and one of them is an intellectual or mental conception and the other of what God has said in his word and of what Jesus Christ by the way and by the way of knowledge okay and the other is an experimental experience that God has given the man in his heart see not staying with me next night not not hold that one is an intellectual conception the other is an experience that God has that God has give the man in his heart a man now the one intellectually is hollering he is feasting on God but his feasts doesn't hold out a man the other one seems to have victory all the time nothing bothers him there's just a solid anchor and they can they can be no trials no stones that bother him at all but they seem to have something about them that people who are Christians and trying to live for God admire that type of Christian a man and I've often wondered Lord what is it that these people has that the others crave so much for and yet seem to fail to get it amen now now to see this hovering yeah the probably went into something else and that's a real good thing there he was talking about I'll go ahead and do it he was talking about here I was speaking to this yesterday to a little old colored man who told me of of a minister walking back and tearing up his preaching papers and throw them into the trash and said I'm through with it and the following Sunday he got a case of beer he said I'm done I quit the father was something he went and got a case of beer see let me stop right here let me stop right now let me tell you something I've been there you can give if you under such a strain under such a strain and you feel like oh it's too hard and and and the devil is the devil is just working on you you begin to lose all hope and the devil will get you to a point just like he got a preacher oh wait let me tell you something never hear me well never let go I don't care how hard it gets I don't care how difficult to test I don't care how this one may upset you and you feel like don't nobody love me and this one is against me never never never let go never let go I don't kick he'll see he will take you through he bring you out let me read this on I mean let me bring this up that preacher preaching that next Sunday he went and got a case of beer and saved my place and drank it a couple of weeks after that he lay dying on the bed he said if I prophesied man if I had time I'd explain that but I'd be getting off on to another subject how that Satan come in and took the person God had to take his child home that's all there was that's all that could happen he had to take his child home amen never let go there's gonna be things that come up there's gonna be situations that come up and and and the devil is always gonna be trying to just just quit just give up never let go a man never let go now we go on not to see this hungry for people and yet not able to reach it's this place that they wanna play that they desire to be in and many of our teachers and schools have brought in much theology telling the people well it's because you didn't show well it's because you didn't speak in tongues well it's because you didn't get slained in the spirit telling them all of these different things the Prophet brought out he said when they were crossing the Red Sea and they come over to the promised land each night it rained down manna from heaven amen the people were going to take the manna and they make it the bread into bread and cakes and something and they would eat this bread which sustained them for the life's journey and when they found out many times they had left the manor laid just a little bit too long on the ground and it would melt away and run like the Frost something on the ground run like a frost or something on the ground and it didn't hold now stay with me here now we see that the same thing is happening in Christianity many people before 9 o'clock get hungry and have you have a lot of what they call campground well what would I say campground stores amen many people go to the services and rejoice and they shout and they praise the Lord while the Spirit of God is falling all condemnation has left their heart and as soon as the day as soon as a day of soul or two after the revival they find themselves right back to the old grind again yet they were eaten matter they were eaten manna the Bible says here st. John the fifth chapter xxi he that hears my word man hears my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall never come into judgment but has already passed from death unto life now we look at that Scripture he that heareth my word and I thank God this morning the pastor read a quote that was just so wonderful I had to go and jot it down amen what do we have to do we have to believe first we have to hear hear bleep now like to get into something here jesus said the word he that hears my words believeth on him that sent me hath eternal and never ending always existing life he says isn't that marvelous ever existing life and shall never perish but have already passed from death unto life has passed from separation or to everlasting presence everlasting presence you passed from death unto life from darkness today from mortality to immortality from corruption to incorruption from weary to joy from death to life from rest and resting fully in thus saith the Lord not upon feelings not upon mental emotion theory or theory apart not upon some unknown something that somebody has said to you that has no basis a lot of times we get caught up in emotion we get caught up in mental conception a man we caught up in theories a man in all of this is based on what some body told us that has no scriptural basis and we wonder why our anchors not holding it won't hold him man a man now four things faith cometh by hearing hearing the word and believing and applying and then resting there's four things hearing believing applying and resting a man since then if you will turn to take your size with Jesus 62 Oh 601 paragraph 67 a man taking sides with Jesus paragraph 67 a man now Sancerre no I want you to go go down something go go go up you up my down whatever hold on hold on slow down go down I want to get well we'll just read it in the house of Cornelius I don't know which way you win she went up God is no respected person we see a person deeply and sincere he can be sincerely wrong but if he is sincerely a man second line oh I got you sincerely God would lead him to the light somewhere he'll come to it amen got a leader to the light somewhere he'll come to it if he sincerely because God is obligated to do that and we think about the coming of the Lord being such a great thing and the message no more than its wint remember there's a predestinated group to be here when the Lord returns and it might not be over a dozen Amy it might not be over a dozen see we don't know it might be a hundred million might be ten thousand but if the predestinated will hear the message now listen now the predestinated will hear hear what the message and believe and believe now I said there's four things here believe apply and rest amen he said here the predestinated we're here the message and believe first you got it here faith cometh by hearing hearing the Word of God amen and then there comes the hope now if you will turn to that the message the darkest hour then the darkest hour then Jesus came 55:11 14 5511 14 paragraph 26 37 I say I gotta go to paragraph 26 let's see here this came to me later I didn't have I would have had it all printed out but the Lord gave me this at the lad at the twelfth hour and he looked around okay parents going to see yeah okay good okay he's he's seen a woman how he did it that's a secret but he found her he said the little woman with the blood issue said your faith has saved you that faith has saved me he says now watch the same word there is the Greek word Sozo Souls o means applying to salvation of the soul or body faith he says that faith has saved me physically amen that faith has saved thee physically just the same as my faith saved thee spiritually the same Greek word Sozo is that right all right see the same word thy faith hath saved thee amen go down to paragraph 35 35 amen amen I think that's a man all right paragraph 35 we're talking about applying he said the Greek works souls old means applying so as far as we hear believe now we have to apply the word how do we apply the word how do we do that preach it see go down a little bit go up a little bit because I got here thirty five thirty no go to thirty seven I told you wrong thirty-seven keep going you're doing good okay keep going I know but I said I got here thirty seven point five okay stop see the Bible is written I want to make sure I don't miss it see the Bible is written on words but the Bible is a love story to the church okay he says when I preach here not long ago a few years ago on Abraham and Sarah turning back to be a young boy and girl again from when they was a hundred years old and preacher laughed at me and said word that the same preacher wrote a book on it not long ago and passed it out across the country God did turn Abraham and Sarah back to young boy and girl and came to prove that gonna okay but you see the Bible you'll never learn it in a seminary he says I don't care that might sound awfully flat but the Bible said God said that he has hid these things from the eyes of the wise and the prudent and we reveal it to babes such as would learn is that right you see he revealed it to babes you don't have to be smart to understand in the Bible you have to have a humble heart keep going the Bible is God's love story to the church that's hid a may from all of the scholars in the world and only note by the scholar by one scholarship that's through me I love gee he does know about one scholarship Amen through the great School of Theology it ever had any of it do you know what I mean down on your knees not a Bible here a man is you have to read between the lines make it right now and then it goes into my wife but you can take that down so earlier he was talking about souls oh and they asked the question how do you apply first you hear you hear did you believe the third thing is to apply it how do you apply the word down on your bended knees it's how you apply the word to your life down on your knees Lord I don't understand it how how do I become the question was asked earlier and while some total he said there were two phases some are here and believe but there's a physical and a mental conception today but when you get down on your knees and began to plead to God begin to talk to God amen to the things that you hear I believe in law but I don't understand he said he's obligated to give you the revelation there what it goes from here down into here and it becomes a relationship right but applying happens on your knees the next is resting amen the next is resting we're gonna move on I have another quote there for resting amen so we got the four things here believing applying and resting on the Word of God resting on what the word has taught us told you not being tossed about we see the trouble to the rawness we see the calamity and everything but if we hear the word we believe the word we've applied the word why do we got to worry about Amen we got nothing to worry about much like Peter and the disciples on the boat and everything was going wrong but they had a word jesus said go to the other side he said go to the other side Danny turned around and made him to come let him know that I'm with you I'm with you whatever the situation is be of good courage be not afraid amen see what's going on riding and all of these things if I could stand that on the caller ID right it be not afraid they have no hope they're fearful throwing rocks and burning down places and acting a fool go home get on your knees and tuck the garden a ShowMe law what's going on what's really happening cuz we seen the last time we had uproar like this in this country a prophet was on the scene there's another distraction so what's really going on what if that devil is trying to keep you from what is it that he's trying to keep you from the little church in the corner and it ain't about that little Church in the corner believe me this churches all over the world God are getting ready to take his people home God is preparing amen so we look at these things and we can't get sidetracked that's later you see a problem I'm not a lady to see you ladies see of me people's rights everybody got it right the dog got a right right let's go right right right everybody fighting funny right is he but a she forfeits his rights she forfeits his rights amen no take me take my life and use it for your wheel take all I have and use it for your glory I'm not buck fight I'm just coming humbly to the throne of grace lead me great Shepherd leave me great Shepherd keep your eyes on the ship the Prophet was talking about how the great Shepherd was leading the Sheep amen and he led the Sheep down through the city right through the market right through the middle of market they were food on this side food on that side now once she got out of line they all stayed right there in a single-file line keeping their eyes on the ship keep that and he led them a good grazing land good grazing land they didn't have to we know the shepherd own feeders okay what's going on lady ASEA yeah we yeah we officially have to go to work I forgot to cut this thing up see this all been they taking temperatures on my job and they put this armband on you to let everybody know that you're good they got a different color Fred I forgot to take it out sore anyway no bracelet a night not just what this is they preach up there preach up there bringing with the pink bracelet I forgot to cut it off a man so if you see the whole everything society is everything is shaking it's just gonna get worse and we're you know you deceive you don't get better ain't gonna get no better maybe we'll get better don't get better far but I tell you what right now it is time to make sure Amen that it's gonna be on our in too late and the word is sinking them to our heart we have to apply to work on your knees on your knees amen not gonna keep you much longer he says here you passed from death unto life from darkness today for mortality to immortality from corruption to incorruption from weary to joy from death unto life and resting upon thus saying see that's what we put our amen cuz see that ain't gonna sing and I don't dust saith the Lord not a punk feelings mental emotion theory upon what somebody else says that has no basis but upon the Word of God the human soul rests solidly God said so that settles it that makes it real amen he says what makes these people go out on the ground and eat the matter and did before nightfall many of them go hungry many of them go to church and they hear the word of God I hear the sermon and they rejoice but is that the thing that comes in and but but what is that thing that comes in and take it away from them the first difficulty that rise truly if you are hearing the word and your soul is rejoicing in the word it's the Holy Spirit and you are eating amen I believe that you believe unto everlasting life I believe that you accept the word of Jesus Christ of Jesus Christ gives you everlasting eternal life when you believe I believe by one spirit that you are baptized into the body of believers see your face anchors you in Christ amen that's that's intellectual you believe it you accept it you say that's right you recognize it to be truth and you're a Christian and you've got everlasting life by believing it you've entered into God you're on the campground manna is falling and you're eating and did you notice the strength thing that went that there was a mixed multitude eating the same manner a man a mixed multitude eating the same manner people who are sinners who do not accept the Lord Jesus can still enjoy seeing the moving of the miracles of God heal another city came rejoicing the people doing right can open their hearts and rejoice in a sermon that's preached under the anointing and that's the same type of manner that Christians are eating amen the same type of manner then you always remember my doctrine here at the Tabernacle you have to follow God in threes because he's perfected and free a man he says now we wonder why and we find out that this manner would vanish and it would come on the ground and vanish then come again and vanish every day some of it we're by 9 o'clock it's gone he said I've met people stand in church and see and just rejoice and see them go outside the church and maybe Monday or Tuesday or just living on behaving becoming too Christian and the man or woman who ever it may be would turn and shake your hand and say I don't want to do these things you feel sorry for them a man you've seen people accept divine healing and say oh yes I see I see it it's the word oh thank you lord thank you lord I believe it and they go right out in a few days first little storm strikes their back they go again amen you've noticed it it's true and the people can't help it so what is it all about what causes these things to happen he said now let's notice now we notice the matter when it failed God sending it down to provide life for the children of Israel in their journey then God told Moses Angie don't make golden puck and to fill it a man full of mana and put it in the holiest of the holiest of holy places by the ark this manner was to be set by the ark and there's no and there it never failed it would never go oh it never lost its weakness it was always inside there amen he said that you ever meet a person that's been in there and has tasted and on the living manner you can meet him on Monday and on Tuesday and on Wednesday and on Thursday and on Friday Saturday Sunday cloudy day bright day gloomy day things gonna be all right amen everything's good he is always sweet always full of joy never to talk or do anything wrong he's living under the glory of God he never gets hungry he's never has to go to church to get built up he come already built up a man he's just always full of God amen why because he doesn't step beyond he not went into the holiest of the holiest place and he made of the living matter so what is he saying amen it has come beyond his intellect it has gone beyond just getting goosebumps it has don't beyond freeship it has gone beyond amen just a feeling turn on your flesh amen the word hey man has entered into his heart it has taken it to the holiest of the holiest place in a city to a place that will change his nature how because he was on his knees how do you answer how do you play it there amen you can do all of the mechanics right you can clap right you can sing right you can stomp your feet you can shout you can speak your tongue but unless you get down on your knees and say Lord changed me through and through Lord car met Lord the word I've heard it I've heard the word of the Lord down on my knees on my bended knees lord help me acceptance of the word that's how you apply it now you applying the word and it's changing you not from the outside but from the inside Amy morally God amen now you will becoming a solid Christian Amy it's not about works amen you come and just do things cause the past to see then you living for the pastor amen you come and do it and man you do you you get to justification and sanctification you stop lying you start doing some of you stop drinking you stop doing some of those things that ain't good enough you have to go all the way he said you gotta the man of the living matter is in the holiest of holy place amen go into that room shut the door behind you where's nobody but you and go see Laura lord I don't know Wainwright I know I'm not there yet I have little little things Lord Lord the word I heard your word see don't be like the can't breath they kitty emotionally worked up they shout they have a good time and go home and that's as far as it go they never take the time to get down on the knees we know about is around said lord help change me from within take me into the Holdings you mean that's where you go he'll take you beyond the veil and burn out everything that is not like him amen because in Kate nothing follow you in there and you eat from the manna a man like I said before from mouth to mouth you know it's God Himself feeding you he said he said that manna was for life you recognize that you're eating in life it is the body a man the Word of God it's gone he is eternal you're feeding on the eternal Word of God that is changing you from the inside a man and now you have a hope Amen is normal fear amen because you are changed from the inside amen you are no longer tossed about because now you have an anchor a man you have an anchor that reaches into glory a man in grips and hold on a solid rock a man that rock is Jesus amen that rock is Jesus not some emotion Amen not some screed or Dogma Amen not some some some some some some some somebody I said that's I'm good it's a lot of that cuz it sound good amen now you're feeding on the original manner that was Kepler amen in the holiest of the Holies we must press beyond the veil amen apply here believing applying and resting amen we looked at Joe in closing you know that one thing that Jobe feared the most is the one thing that happened to them the one thing that he feared the most amen bear with me let me get to it I got a bunch of Nohr they see here be not afraid my brother the Lord has given us something special he's given us something in this wilderness journey to sustain us through this journey through these perilous perilous times amen let's see if I can find this here amen oh thank you Jesus thank you Jesus amen now me I may just forego that but you see that the one thing that Moses I mean I said Moses jo-jo fear the most wonder one thing that he feared the most is what happened to him Amen I had to hear in my notes but I'm just gonna forgo that I'll probably find as soon as I get out the pool okay amen praise the Lord the book of Joel he says here Joe what he feared it actually happened what brought it the musicians come his fear that's what made it happen his faith could have kept him from it but his fear brought him brought him to brought it to him he was scared it was going to happen and it did happen perfect faith perfect faith 63 mmm-hmm a man brought a his fear and that's what made it happen his faith would have kept him from it but his fear brought him brought it to him he was scared of it going to happen and it did happen now it been he know it would happen it wouldn't happen see what I mean I'm gonna read that again he was scared it was going to happen and it did happen now if been he knowed it wouldn't happen it wouldn't have happened see what I mean if you're afraid when you come by the prayer line maybe I just maybe I just haven't got the faith sufficient it'll never happen don't worry see but if you if you know it's going to happen it'll happen it's a substance of something job had a fear that these things would come upon him and they did if you have fear that your disease is going to leave you're going to leave you or won't leave you it won't if you have faith that it will and it will a man you ask any medical doctor the first thing they try to do they try to get you to do is to have confidence in the medicine he's giving you if you haven't got confidence in it you better leave it alone see sure what is it it's faith that does that does the healing it's faith that does it all the time so I see my brothers and sisters don't be afraid don't be afraid by the covert or political oppress or national chaos all of the things that's going on around us they're doing it because they're afraid but we've had a word that come from the Lord and be it us to come he said be not afraid be of good courage because we know we're in the ship and he told he gave us a prophecy and he gave us the manner a man to give us what it takes for life for this journey feed on the secret things of God go beyond the veil apply it here believe it apply it and then rest on it Amen god bless you let us pray most gracious God lord I thank you before you just gave me this message Lord within the last 24 hours and no idea what you want him I just knew that you wanted me to speak something Oh God I couldn't just bring anything that I had up here Lord God but you even into this morning Lord you was breaking forth I trusted someone Lord God you know all things someone that might be in a situation Oh Lord God of fear of what's going on may they find comfort in your word this morning Oh God that Jesus you walked on water and you didn't to come what was it Lord as it was a supernatural and you beat them to come and Peter walked on water let us not look at the situation around us the things that's going on but keep our eyes steadfast on you let us not be sucked in by the distractions of this world but to see what you are doing in this hour Lord and Lord God used me I'm reminded probably was talking about the man coming back from war and they didn't the winter was coming and they had too little time to plant the seed or there'll be no harvest they didn't have time Mathilde ground [Music] so they was able to just scratch the surface and plant the seed it was all hands on deck me and women and children one child would sleep while the other one work and when the other one wake up the other one would sleep by the other child work Lord wit we're in that time again let's plant deceive let there be no harvest I look at the zeal and things of these young people in the streets Lord only if they had that zeal for you oh god what a powerful thing it would be help us get the word out old father Oh God look are we know that this is this this time is winding up prophecies are coming to fulfillment Lord God everything is maturing in this our keeper so father God steadfast unmovable and always about and in your word take us beyond our emotions Lord all but beyond our mental conception of God Oh Lord where we eat the manna Lord God in the holiest of the Holies Oh God in the secret place that solidify as an anchor uh so father God well we no longer tossed about Oh Lord a grandfather and Jesus precious name I pray amen [Music] me safe and secure if you stand [Music] leaning on the everlasting what a fellowship what your divine leaning on the everlasting all near blasting are you leaning on the everlasting arms [Music] safe and secure from [Music] leaning on the everlasting arms sing it one more time say leaning wooly [Music] safe and secure from all the lungs I am Ling leaning yes I am leaning lean in all the ever let sting arms hey man you can keep playing that softly let's just give the Lord a hand of praise for the word of God that's been spoken to our heart today be not afraid and certainly appreciate just the inspiration behind that when we look at all the circumstances that are surrounding us and just seem like we get through with one thing and then something else rise up and something rise up but in the midst of all of that we have been encouraged not to be Amen afraid just don't don't show any fear God's got everything under control they meant everything that sometime it may not look like it may not seem like it but God is still God in the midst of everything that we see in this world we thank God for brother Troy and then we thank God for him just yielded himself and speaking to our hearts they man on today let's just bow out a word of Prayer and we're prepared to dismiss you on today father we thank you for the word of the Lord thank you God for this sermon of be I'm not afraid and God we can easily see so many things happening now where our world has changed it's not the same world that we were living in maybe just a few months ago and God we're all trying to make adjustments what one thing for sure as believers we know this world is not our home and we're just strangers we're passing through so Lord they're things that were happen in this world and God has nothing to do with us so god help us to keep our mind and our attention on you the reason that Peter began to sink is because it took his his tuchus is a focus off of you so help us not to keep our focus on you God in this hour we know that you'll see us through we know that you'll bring us out we know God that somehow you will turn things in our favor and what we trust you we believe you pray God to bless the Saints as they prepare to leave this place but not your presence may we go Lord meditating on the words that we've heard today bring us back at the appointed time well next week God be glorified and magnified in our hearts in our lives keep us Lord is our prayer it's in Jesus name that we pray amen and amen god bless you a man you may be seated the brothers will come at this time to dismiss you a man god bless you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
