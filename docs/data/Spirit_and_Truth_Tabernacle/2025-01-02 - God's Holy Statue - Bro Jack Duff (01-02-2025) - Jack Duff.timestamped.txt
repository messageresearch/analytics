[52:06] all uh we just we just appreciate the
[52:09] Lord Jesus amen and I I just needed to
[52:13] take just a little time uh to mention a
[52:16] couple things did we put the
[52:17] announcement on our corporate fast is
[52:19] that okay um just want to make mention
[52:23] that is um something that's coming at
[52:26] the end of this month the last Sunday
[52:29] this month we'll be starting uh our our
[52:31] 21-day corporate fast we do it as a
[52:33] church together and uh and everybody
[52:36] does something different whatever the
[52:38] Lord leads them to do uh we don't put
[52:41] any pressure on that but we just ask
[52:43] everybody to join in some way some uh
[52:46] fast till 3:00 in the day some 6:00 in
[52:49] the day some do the Daniel Fast um which
[52:52] means they still eat uh but they just
[52:54] eat differently uh so fast
[52:58] technology social media now back in in
[53:02] the Bible days that wouldn't have really
[53:03] been considered a fast but today it
[53:07] truly is a fast when you can fast uh
[53:10] social media right so there's all all
[53:13] types of ways that we enter into this
[53:15] amen and we just want to encourage
[53:17] everyone that that'll be coming uh on
[53:19] the last Sunday of this month amen we'll
[53:21] be we'll be uh going 21 days I I changed
[53:25] it we used to do it 21 days before
[53:27] Easter but uh I changed that because I
[53:30] didn't want us to be considered
[53:32] [Music]
[53:34] Catholic I know the Catholics do that
[53:36] with the um lent and that's not what
[53:40] we're trying to do uh you know I just I
[53:42] think fasting is actually a part of the
[53:45] Christian
[53:47] experience amen the Bible speaks of it
[53:49] brother Brandon did it and uh and I
[53:52] believe it's something that we should
[53:53] all incorporate uh in our own personal
[53:56] lives amen so uh we'll be doing that as
[53:59] a church uh corporately and we get that
[54:02] from when Esther told the um the
[54:06] children of Israel uh y'all go in a
[54:08] three-day fast for me because I got to
[54:10] go before the king and and I have not
[54:12] been invited into his presence so uh she
[54:15] say if I perish I I'll perish but I'm
[54:18] going to go see the king but y'all fast
[54:20] before I go right and then you know uh
[54:23] so that's where the corporate part comes
[54:25] in the entire nation began to fast on
[54:28] behalf of Esther uh believing that God
[54:31] would open up a door and he did uh for
[54:33] Esther if he can open up the door for
[54:35] Esther anybody need any doors open Amen
[54:39] in this season I'm one that believes he
[54:41] can open doors for us amen let's be
[54:45] sincere about how we approach the Lord
[54:48] amen uh I uh also yes yesterday I was um
[54:55] I was
[54:56] in asked to preach a eulogy at a at a a
[55:01] homegoo service my mother-in-law's Uncle
[55:05] uh passed and you know I'm I I I I
[55:09] didn't I was trying to figure out how
[55:11] did they get to me so many preachers in
[55:13] the family and and I could not figure
[55:16] out how I was the one to get the
[55:20] invitation uh to minister and uh and you
[55:24] know when you're going to
[55:26] uh environments like that I I can't
[55:30] bring the sermons that I bring here it
[55:33] would be way too
[55:35] heavy you can't choke
[55:38] people right uh so I have to always in
[55:42] my mind try to get back
[55:45] down praise the lord I can't go in with
[55:48] get back and
[55:50] step hello y'all y'all can eat that but
[55:53] they can't it's a little too rich
[55:57] so I have to always in my mind try to
[55:59] figure out okay how can I get this down
[56:02] to a level where we can still minister
[56:04] to the hearts of the people and I was
[56:07] searching amen that the scripture says
[56:10] in the Book of Ecclesiastes the preacher
[56:12] searches for acceptable words and uh and
[56:15] I was searching for some acceptable
[56:18] words and uh and I was just waiting on
[56:20] the Lord and I asked the brothers on
[56:22] Tuesday night to pray for me cuz I was
[56:24] just waiting on the Lord and and um you
[56:27] know so um uh Thursday night we happened
[56:31] to go to the the fair and uh you know we
[56:35] were there first the young people went
[56:37] at last Sunday with the young people and
[56:39] I really enjoyed myself they hurt my
[56:40] feet with them young people walking with
[56:43] them all over the place but but
[56:45] nonetheless we made it through and uh
[56:48] and I went back on Thursday night and
[56:49] you know as we were just kind of there
[56:52] uh you know at the fair uh Brother
[56:54] Joseph uh walked up to to me and he says
[56:58] um brother Jack I got a question for you
[57:01] and uh I said yeah what's that he says
[57:04] um it says I was reading my Bible doing
[57:08] my own Bible study and I was reading and
[57:10] I ran across this scripture in Matthew
[57:13] 18 and uh my dad asked me you know what
[57:16] did I what did I think this meant and I
[57:18] really I just couldn't get anything out
[57:21] of it but uh I figured I would ask you
[57:24] and I say well he say it's talking about
[57:26] the lost sheep I say uh Lord let's read
[57:29] it together I pulled it out on my phone
[57:31] real quick and I and it talked about how
[57:34] the shepherd would leave the
[57:36] 99 and go and find the one lost sheep
[57:41] and I said oh Joe this is the value of
[57:43] one soul to God that he would leave 99
[57:47] and go after that one and he didn't even
[57:50] know he had struck the
[57:54] cords and right there I got a sermon
[57:57] from brother Joe thank you brother
[58:03] Joe thank you my brother brother that
[58:07] that that that that that that that
[58:09] helped us we walk right through that and
[58:12] talked about how it was a shepherd's
[58:14] responsibility to find his lost sheep
[58:18] and and you know just a lot of little
[58:20] things we brought and I said now if he's
[58:22] a hirling he will just leave the Sheep
[58:26] if the Wolf come he'll leave the sheep
[58:28] and he'll run for his life but a
[58:29] Shepherd a true Shepherd will lay his
[58:32] life down for the sheep and I say I'm so
[58:35] glad that I'm Not underneath a
[58:38] hirling I said I'm underneath the
[58:41] covering of a Good Shepherd I said how
[58:44] you know you underneath the covering of

[1:01:05] to them quickly uh Joel 1 Joel 2 and
[1:01:09] then uh I want to pick up in Mark 2 as
[1:01:13] well um Joel 1:4 simply says that which
[1:01:17] the Palmer worm uh hath left hath the
[1:01:21] Locust eaten and that which the Locust
[1:01:24] ha left hath the cankerworm eaten that
[1:01:26] which the Kink worth left hath the

[1:01:48] rain the former rain the latter rain in
[1:01:50] the first month the floor shall be full
[1:01:53] of Wheat and the fat shall overflow with
[1:01:56] wine and oil and I will restore to you
[1:02:01] the years that the Locust ha eaten the
[1:02:04] canker worm and the caterpillar and the
[1:02:06] Palmer worm my great Army which I sent
[1:02:09] among you uh also I want to just slip
[1:02:11] over here to Mark chapter
[1:02:14] 2
[1:02:22] amen um
[1:02:28] let see I think I want verse
[1:02:34] 18
[1:02:35] yeah um says
[1:02:38] and The Disciples of
[1:02:41] John and uh of the Pharisees used to
[1:02:47] fast and they come and say unto him why
[1:02:51] do the Disciples of John and of the
[1:02:52] Pharisees fast but thy disciples fast
[1:02:55] not
[1:02:57] and Jesus said to them can the children
[1:02:58] of the Bride chamber fast while the
[1:03:00] bridegroom is with them as long as they
[1:03:03] have the bridegroom with them they
[1:03:05] cannot fast but the days will come when
[1:03:09] the bridegroom shall be taken away from
[1:03:12] them and then shall they fast in these
[1:03:16] days verse 21 says no man also sth a
[1:03:21] piece of new cloth on an old garment the
[1:03:26] new piece that filled it up taketh away
[1:03:29] from the old and the rent is made worse
[1:03:34] the tear is made worse the rent is made
[1:03:36] worse and no man putteth new wine into
[1:03:41] Old bottles else the new wine does burst
[1:03:45] the bottles and the wine is SPO is is
[1:03:49] spilled uh and the bottles will be
[1:03:53] marred but new wine must be put into new
[1:03:59] bottles amen the Lord had a blessing to
[1:04:03] the reading of his word let us pray
[1:04:06] father we are grateful for uh the
[1:04:10] privilege
[1:04:11] to read the scripture but it takes the
[1:04:16] Holy Ghost to make the scripture live uh

[1:04:22] we pray that you take control of every
[1:04:24] thought as presented take control of
[1:04:27] every thought that is received May the
[1:04:30] spirit of God be pleased father with the
[1:04:33] word that goes forth and God not only

[1:05:19] uh Channel if I can put it that way the
[1:05:22] title this morning is God's holy statue
[1:05:26] man God's holy uh statue and um I want
[1:05:31] to uh focus a little bit amen our
[1:05:35] attention on the Holy Ghost because in
[1:05:38] Joel it was speaking about the Holy
[1:05:42] Ghost amen the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:05:45] and we want to make a few comments on
[1:05:48] that um this morning and just trust the
[1:05:51] Lord will just just direct us let me
[1:05:53] start with a quote out of uh what was
[1:05:57] the Holy Ghost given for uh brother
[1:06:01] brandom makes a statement here it says
[1:06:06] one more scripture it says if you want
[1:06:09] to write it down John
[1:06:13] 12:24 he says let me quote it to you
[1:06:16] right quick Jesus said if a corn of
[1:06:21] wheat falls into the ground except it
[1:06:24] die it cannot bring forth another life
[1:06:29] amen except it die it cannot bring forth
[1:06:32] another life he says now look one
[1:06:34] closing remark now it says remember that
[1:06:39] it is
[1:06:42] absolutely uh now to you people he says
[1:06:45] it's
[1:06:46] absolutely
[1:06:47] essential and
[1:06:49] necessary and compelling and
[1:06:53] compulsory that you receive the Holy
[1:06:56] Ghost now for if you don't you can't
[1:07:00] come in the
[1:07:02] resurrection now uh I I wanted to just
[1:07:06] just take a little time and look at that
[1:07:09] he uses so many
[1:07:11] adjectives in order to try to get to our
[1:07:15] attention uh how important it is for us
[1:07:20] to receive the holy ghost look let me
[1:07:22] just try to make this plain it's not
[1:07:24] good enough
[1:07:26] for you just to come to
[1:07:28] church that's right it's not good enough
[1:07:30] for you to say that you believe the
[1:07:33] message hello somebody amen those things
[1:07:36] are good but it's not good enough what
[1:07:38] what you must go on to receive is the
[1:07:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost and that's
[1:07:43] something that changes you from the
[1:07:46] inside Hallelujah when when you don't
[1:07:48] have strength on the inside to say no to
[1:07:51] sin the Holy Ghost comes to give you
[1:07:53] strength to be able to say no to sin
[1:07:56] the Holy Ghost you to live a different
[1:07:58] type of life than you were living before
[1:08:01] Hallelujah somebody so so brother Bram
[1:08:03] uses these amen adjectives he says
[1:08:07] essential amen he says
[1:08:10] compelling he says compulsory what is
[1:08:13] this word essential it means absolutely
[1:08:17] necessary extremely
[1:08:20] important you know eating food is
[1:08:22] extremely important right it's abs
[1:08:25] absolutely necessary if you want to if
[1:08:26] you want to live but receiving the Holy
[1:08:28] Ghost spiritually is more important than
[1:08:30] you eating your
[1:08:31] food he says this compelling that means
[1:08:34] evoking interest attention or admiration
[1:08:38] in a powerfully irresistible
[1:08:42] way amen it's compelling that we receive
[1:08:45] the Holy Ghost he also said compulsory
[1:08:47] which means it's required by
[1:08:51] law I like that
[1:08:54] statement it it's required by law and
[1:08:58] and I just I just love the way uh I love
[1:09:00] the way the prophet just uses this type
[1:09:02] of language the composure mean required
[1:09:05] by law a rule is
[1:09:08] obligatory you obligated to receive it
[1:09:10] now now here the other thing that we uh
[1:09:12] that we find that the prophet tells that
[1:09:14] if you
[1:09:16] repent amen according to Acts chapter 2
[1:09:18] if you repent and you're baptized in the
[1:09:21] name of the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah
[1:09:23] brother Brandon say God is
[1:09:26] obligated to fill you with the Holy
[1:09:30] Ghost if you come according to his word
[1:09:33] hallelujah you can hold God to his
[1:09:36] promise this morning if you know that
[1:09:39] you've already repented and you know
[1:09:41] that you were baptized in the name of
[1:09:42] the Lord Jesus Christ now you can expect
[1:09:46] God to fill you with his
[1:09:50] Spirit it it's it's
[1:09:53] necessary absolutely NE necessary that
[1:09:55] we talk about the Holy Ghost it's it's
[1:09:58] important for this this generation amen
[1:10:01] we must receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:10:04] Ghost here in the message hidden life

[1:20:34] Christianity and
[1:20:40] uh Hallelujah I think it's the one where
[1:20:43] it says so I set in amazement that's the
[1:20:45] one you want to pull up sis but before
[1:20:47] you do that I just want to set this
[1:20:49] quote
[1:20:50] up you know uh brother brandom was uh uh
[1:20:55] in this sermon impersonation
[1:20:56] Christianity he was talking about how he
[1:20:59] uh he was in the in the wilderness and
[1:21:02] he was tracking a grizzly bear he was
[1:21:04] trying to he saw a grizzly bear he said
[1:21:06] he didn't want to shoot it he simply
[1:21:07] wanted to just just just observe it and
[1:21:11] just sit there and and enjoy one of the
[1:21:13] God's natural creatures and uh he said
[1:21:16] he would just tracking and just just
[1:21:17] just running you know uh trying to get
[1:21:19] this bear but while he was tracking the
[1:21:22] bear uh he was riding a horse he said
[1:21:25] his horse was about 3 years old so he
[1:21:26] had not really been broken in and uh he
[1:21:30] say every time he turned around that
[1:21:32] horse was trying to do something in
[1:21:33] order to kick brother brother brandom
[1:21:35] off the horse cuz he just didn't want
[1:21:37] him riding and uh he said they would
[1:21:40] they go around one corner that that
[1:21:41] horse will raise up and try to kick him
[1:21:43] off and he's stuck in the wilderness
[1:21:44] here and this horse just bucking every
[1:21:46] every everywhere he can and he says uh
[1:21:49] uh he says while fighting with the horse
[1:21:51] he actually lost sense of direction he
[1:21:53] didn't know where he was in the wildness
[1:21:55] he didn't know what know what North what
[1:21:57] south east or west was he was completely
[1:21:59] lost because he was fighting with this
[1:22:00] horse it says but by God's grace he he
[1:22:03] caught his direction again and he
[1:22:05] realized he had to turn and go in a
[1:22:07] different way and I hope somebody will
[1:22:09] come to that Rec uh that that reality

[1:22:29] different direction today Hallelujah the
[1:22:33] spirit of God is here to help you do

[1:22:42] direction said a storm was there in the
[1:22:44] area and and a storm had passed and now

[1:24:17] spooky because he heard some strange and
[1:24:20] strange noises some mournful noises in
[1:24:23] this area he said it look real spooky
[1:24:25] but yet in this place he's worshiping
[1:24:28] God he says he looked around and noticed
[1:24:31] that he was in what we call a burnover
[1:24:34] and brother Adam says it's where the the
[1:24:36] fires went through years before and burn
[1:24:39] amen burned all the bark off the trees
[1:24:41] and and they didn't stand it says but
[1:24:42] when that sun or moon rather come out
[1:24:44] from behind the clouds and all those
[1:24:46] bleach white uh poles standing up trees
[1:24:49] it looked like
[1:24:53] tombstones while he D he made a
[1:24:55] statement he said Lord I I always knew
[1:24:57] that you lived in the
[1:24:58] forest and he said why was I attracted
[1:25:01] to stop at this place amen for this
[1:25:04] place looks terrible why am I attracted
[1:25:06] to stop here amen and just worship you
[1:25:09] what's going on here so we want to pick
[1:25:11] up amen this quote because God begins to
[1:25:13] show him why he was there in that place
[1:25:16] it says so as I sat in
[1:25:19] amazement looking I thought well what
[1:25:22] caused this well why are these trees
[1:25:24] like this what caused this this this
[1:25:26] this this uh this burnover it says he
[1:25:29] says what what caused this what what
[1:25:31] what what uh what stripped the
[1:25:34] life it says uh what the Lutheran
[1:25:38] left the methodists eaten where the
[1:25:41] Methodist left the Baptist eaten where
[1:25:44] the Baptist left the nazarin eaten where
[1:25:48] the nazarin left the Pentecostal eaten
[1:25:51] and brother we haven't got nothing but
[1:25:54] just a church
[1:25:56] name I thought isn't that something no
[1:25:59] wonder there's so much
[1:26:03] impersonation of Christianity and and
[1:26:06] you got to understand many of these
[1:26:07] churches that's all they're doing is
[1:26:08] imperson impersonating Christians
[1:26:10] brother random said you got
[1:26:12] demons
[1:26:14] impersonating
[1:26:17] Christians demons and and often times we
[1:26:19] looking at this demon and we thinking
[1:26:22] they got something if they ain't got The
[1:26:24] Life of Christ ain't got
[1:26:27] nothing amen it said he says uh uh uh no
[1:26:31] wonder there's so much impersonation of
[1:26:33] Christianity nothing but a mock it says
[1:26:36] I won't go over uh to that building no I
[1:26:38] wouldn't Co cooperate with with such a
[1:26:40] thing a lack of life that's all not a
[1:26:42] lack of church it's a lack of
[1:26:45] life it say so I said in my heart to God
[1:26:48] I said why do you still send me send the
[1:26:51] wind then why do you still send the wind
[1:26:53] through amen and this burnover it says
[1:26:56] then my my mind went on down uh in the
[1:26:59] scriptures too dark to read my little
[1:27:02] Testament in my pocket but I said why
[1:27:05] would you send me uh send the wind and
[1:27:08] and my mind went on down the scripture
[1:27:10] said I will
[1:27:12] restore sayth the Lord all that the
[1:27:16] caterpillar has eaten all that the
[1:27:18] Locust has eaten I will restore it says
[1:27:22] and then to my amazement he says looking
[1:27:25] out in the bottom of the corners of the
[1:27:27] trees and their different seeds down on
[1:27:30] the ground not quite so high not so big
[1:27:34] but there was some
[1:27:37] undergrowth I like that there was some
[1:27:39] undergrowth coming up new trees coming
[1:27:42] up and when the wind blew they just
[1:27:46] frolicked and
[1:27:48] shook Glory Glory Glory Glory and jumped
[1:27:52] and quivered and when I said if that
[1:27:55] isn't an oldfashioned Revival I never
[1:27:59] seen
[1:28:01] one Glory Glory Hallelujah says th the
[1:28:04] children of God just rejoicing and
[1:28:07] frolicking in the blessings of God as it
[1:28:09] pours down well something come to me

[1:37:14] said God
[1:37:17] never left
[1:37:19] anything for relics and
[1:37:22] tokens he sent the Holy Ghost and see
[1:37:25] I'm we have to say it like this we got a
[1:37:28] lot of defeated Christians in the
[1:37:31] message sir because they looking at the
[1:37:33] wrong
[1:37:35] thing I'm I'm I know what I'm talking
[1:37:37] about you get people looking at the
[1:37:39] wrong thing they can't get strength from
[1:37:42] that that's the truth because I give you
[1:37:46] a belt buckle that don't mean that
[1:37:47] brother brother you ain't got nothing
[1:37:51] tell them that you ain't got nothing you

[1:37:55] replica and I mean that's all it is and
[1:37:58] and what you going to do with that look
[1:38:00] you better take what's on these books it
[1:38:02] what's on these tapes and you ready to
[1:38:05] put that inside of your
[1:38:08] [Applause]
[1:38:08] [Music]
[1:38:10] heart no we we we talk about lives being
[1:38:13] changed and just coming to the message
[1:38:15] ain't going to change you you you need
[1:38:17] the life that was in the message and
[1:38:20] that's the life of Christ which is the
[1:38:23] baptism of the Holy
[1:38:27] Ghost all
[1:38:29] right Hallelujah God never left anything
[1:38:33] for relics and tokens he sent the Holy
[1:38:36] Ghost something
[1:38:37] alive cannot be
[1:38:41] destroyed look at that what would a what
[1:38:44] would a
[1:38:45] nail do me any
[1:38:49] good it says what with the original
[1:38:52] cross he hung gone what would it do me
[1:38:56] any good not a bit so now now y'all look
[1:39:01] at me and you and you say now how can
[1:39:02] brother Jack say that and you get
[1:39:03] offended at me but the prophet just said
[1:39:06] it that's what he said amen he might not
[1:39:09] have been coughing like I was coughing
[1:39:11] but he said
[1:39:14] it not a bit not to know the nail know
[1:39:18] the
[1:39:19] cross but to
[1:39:22] know him
[1:39:25] is life see it says now so we're we're
[1:39:30] holding on nails we're holding on relics
[1:39:34] and we're holding on
[1:39:36] places and today people walk up and down
[1:39:40] in the city of Jerusalem and all up and
[1:39:43] down in different places and holding to
[1:39:47] relics in things
[1:39:55] now he said in Jerusalem what if I what
[1:39:57] if I put another city that started with
[1:40:06] [Music]
[1:40:07] J sir amen I'm going have to have you
[1:40:11] read between the
[1:40:12] lines and and and and and and what what
[1:40:15] I've come to realize that things that I
[1:40:16] preach for spirit and Truth Tabernacle
[1:40:18] people feel like they have a need to
[1:40:20] share our videos with other folk and and
[1:40:23] and and what happens they they they find
[1:40:25] people that's kind of leaning in a
[1:40:27] certain
[1:40:28] direction and what I'm trying now I'm
[1:40:30] not leaning here and I'm not leaning
[1:40:34] here I'mma tell you where I'm
[1:40:39] at this is where I'm at hallah so
[1:40:42] sometime they take the videos and try to
[1:40:45] give it to the person that might be
[1:40:46] leaning this way I ain't leaning over
[1:40:48] there but I am right here in the middle
[1:40:50] trying to keep my church in alignment

[1:47:47] nine or 10 different times they have to
[1:47:49] mold another foot on it
[1:47:58] such that's what the prophet called it
[1:48:00] nonsense and we ain't going to be caught
[1:48:02] up in the midst of nonsense such
[1:48:06] nonsense superstitions that's all it is
[1:48:09] Creeds of man-made
[1:48:11] Doctrine God sent the Holy Spirit life
[1:48:17] of God to be in you not in a statue
[1:48:23] you are the
[1:48:24] guy that God wants to live in not a
[1:48:28] statue but in
[1:48:30] you people call Holy statues there ain't
[1:48:34] no holy statues you are God's holy
[1:48:41] statue yes sir you are God's holy statue
[1:48:46] they should see Christ in you the hope
[1:48:49] of
[1:48:50] glory yes sir brother
[1:48:53] the Bible says so that's right a body
[1:48:57] has thou
[1:48:58] prepared for me and I I just want I just
[1:49:01] I I just wish that we can get some
[1:49:02] people that would want to just prepare
[1:49:03] their
[1:49:04] bodies that God could dwell inside your
[1:49:07] body God can take control of your
[1:49:10] thinking from the top of your head amen
[1:49:13] he can dwell all the way through the
[1:49:14] souls of your feet that God can direct
[1:49:17] you wherever he wants you to go that
[1:49:18] you'll go
[1:49:21] hallelujah oh my my my my my my I was
[1:49:24] thinking on the scripture uh how um uh
[1:49:28] when when Isaiah uh had an experience
[1:49:31] with God and and God had to had to
[1:49:33] cleanse the prophet Isaiah he he
[1:49:35] realized man I'm undone I need a
[1:49:38] cleansing I need I need I need the fire
[1:49:40] from the altar of God to come and touch
[1:49:42] my lips and cleanse
[1:49:45] me Isaiah got his cleansing and here's
[1:49:49] the here's the beautiful thing about
[1:49:50] after Isaiah got his cleansing
[1:49:53] and and and we have many today that that
[1:49:55] are afraid of this but but when you go
[1:49:57] back and look in the scripture you see
[1:49:58] what happened to Isaiah the question was
[1:50:01] asked after he got his cleansing the
[1:50:04] question asks
[1:50:06] who who will go for us now people not
[1:50:11] registering to go anymore people want to
[1:50:14] sit in the background but the question
[1:50:16] was who will go for us God needed a man
[1:50:22] God need needed a woman God needed
[1:50:24] somebody that would be willing to go for
[1:50:27] him who will go for us after Isaiah got
[1:50:32] his cleansing he can respond with
[1:50:35] honesty in his heart Lord send
[1:50:39] me send me
[1:50:41] Jesus I will
[1:50:47] go
[1:50:49] Joel two
[1:50:52] verse 24
[1:50:55] said and the floors shall be full of
[1:51:00] Wheat and the
[1:51:03] fats shall
[1:51:05] overflow with wine and
[1:51:08] oil now we looked at this to start the
[1:51:12] year off cuz this is considered the year
[1:51:15] of
[1:51:16] overflow amen because we're overflowing
[1:51:18] the theme from last year into this year
[1:51:21] so this is a year of over flow but I
[1:51:23] want us to be very very careful with the
[1:51:25] scripture that we read there's a lot
[1:51:29] there amen the
[1:51:31] fats shall overflow with wine and with
[1:51:34] oil let's go back and just look at that
[1:51:37] wine and oil again brother brandom gives
[1:51:40] us that in the third seal
[1:51:43] Hallelujah he says this and this is at
[1:51:46] the very end of the quote sis when you
[1:51:48] get that paragraph up it's like the last
[1:51:50] uh sentence in it uh in the third seal
[1:51:53] he says now oil
[1:51:56] typifies Spirit
[1:51:59] right glory to God and wine
[1:52:03] symbolizes
[1:52:05] stimulation of Revelation so the fats
[1:52:08] are going to overflow with wine and with
[1:52:09] oil they're going to overflow with the
[1:52:12] spirit and also overflow with
[1:52:14] stimulation of Revelation watch this now
[1:52:17] and it says uh it says boy I like to run
[1:52:20] all over the place it's a wonder I
[1:52:24] didn't wake up the neighborhood when the
[1:52:26] Lord showed me that
[1:52:29] stimulation of Revelation so brother
[1:52:32] brandom experienced it himself before he
[1:52:34] actually came to preach
[1:52:35] it not only did God reveal it to him but
[1:52:38] he showed him what it felt
[1:52:40] like and when he when he got a feeling
[1:52:42] he took off running thought he was going
[1:52:44] to wake up the neighborhood you talking
[1:52:45] about a fool for
[1:52:47] Christ praise the Lord look at this he
[1:52:50] says uh stimulation revelation see oil
[1:52:52] and wine in the Bible is associated
[1:52:54] together always I got the concordance
[1:52:57] and looked and there's a string of them
[1:52:59] like that where wine and oil goes
[1:53:01] together all the time see says when the
[1:53:03] truth of a promised word of God has been
[1:53:07] truly revealed to his Saints that's
[1:53:10] filled with oil amen filled with the
[1:53:13] spirit they all get stimulated it says
[1:53:16] wine is a stimulation Glory it says I
[1:53:20] feel it right now
[1:53:23] stimulated with joy shouts and when it
[1:53:27] does it has the same effect upon them
[1:53:30] that wine does upon a natural man
[1:53:33] because when the Revelation has been
[1:53:34] given of a truth of God and the True
[1:53:37] Believer filled with oil and the
[1:53:39] Revelation is revealed the stimulation
[1:53:41] becomes so great that it makes him
[1:53:45] behaves him behave
[1:53:47] itself
[1:53:49] unnormal see that's why brother Jerry
[1:53:51] come running all all the way from the
[1:53:53] back all the way to the front make him
[1:53:55] behave your
[1:53:58] unnormal brother I come here to get
[1:54:00] something from
[1:54:03] God and when you get what what you
[1:54:05] looking for from God it'll make you act
[1:54:09] crazy let me tell you something you
[1:54:11] ain't even worship God until you've been
[1:54:13] called crazy for worshiping him Paul
[1:54:16] said I worship God in a way that's
[1:54:18] called
[1:54:21] hey Hallelujah makes them behave himself
[1:54:24] unnormal that's right Glory maybe that's
[1:54:26] what's the matter with them now that's
[1:54:29] right it makes them behave thems
[1:54:33] unseemingly a little
[1:54:36] Wildfire is better than no
[1:54:39] fire at
[1:54:41] all Joel 2:24 told
[1:54:45] us the
[1:54:48] floors shall be full of wheat
[1:54:52] and the
[1:54:56] fats shall overflow with wine and
[1:55:02] oil who are these
[1:55:09] [Music]
[1:55:12] fats a
[1:55:15] fat is a
[1:55:17] vessel that actually
[1:55:19] contains new wine and
[1:55:23] [Music]
[1:55:28] oil we need
[1:55:32] fats that can actually contain the wine
[1:55:36] and the
[1:55:38] oil come on somebody Hallelujah now in
[1:55:43] Mark 2 verse
[1:55:45] 22 it told us that no
[1:55:49] man putteth new wine
[1:55:53] into Old bottles or can we call them old
[1:55:59] fats else the new wine doth burst the
[1:56:04] bottles and the wine is spilled and the
[1:56:07] bottles will be Mar but new wine must be
[1:56:10] put
[1:56:11] into new bottles yes sir yes sir now now
[1:56:15] now now now brother Paul you know called
[1:56:17] it it's it's the skins that they Ed
[1:56:19] animal skin back in those days and what
[1:56:21] would happen I'm going to I'm going on
[1:56:23] to impersonation of Christianity the
[1:56:24] second quote there uh what what happened
[1:56:27] is that they would take this uh this
[1:56:29] wine they put it in an old animal skin
[1:56:32] but what would keep the wine is actually
[1:56:35] the
[1:56:36] fat that was in the skin because that
[1:56:39] was a oily substance and it allowed amen
[1:56:43] the skin because of the fat to be
[1:56:46] flexible but if the fat dried out in the
[1:56:50] skin then when you put new wine in that
[1:56:52] it would burst the bottle because it had
[1:56:53] no
[1:56:56] fat hallelujah amen but you need
[1:56:59] something that that'll keep it oiled on
[1:57:01] the
[1:57:03] inside because what's what's containing
[1:57:06] what what is holding on the inside will
[1:57:08] not cause it to break on the outside if
[1:57:11] we got a little
[1:57:14] FS come on
[1:57:17] church but you but we need some facts we
[1:57:20] need some people feeling and yielding
[1:57:23] their body to Christ Hallelujah yielding
[1:57:26] their their person to Christ that he can
[1:57:29] fill it with oil and
[1:57:31] wine that other other people can be
[1:57:34] edified by what's coming out of
[1:57:39] you hey the facts and you are these
[1:57:44] facts you're going to be filled with oil

[2:02:07] message impersonation of
[2:02:10] Christianity he says I often
[2:02:14] wondered why that statement was
[2:02:18] made why you can't put new wine in old
[2:02:21] bottle
[2:02:23] he says I come to find out that look
[2:02:25] where we got a glass jug a bottle why
[2:02:28] couldn't I put new wine in those things
[2:02:32] they put old wine in it but I found out
[2:02:35] that back in the days when Jesus was
[2:02:37] speaking of the bottles wasn't made of
[2:02:40] glass they didn't have the glass blowers
[2:02:43] in those days and they was made out of
[2:02:45] an animal
[2:02:47] skin and the animal skin had been tanged
[2:02:51] and and what was and was sewed up or
[2:02:53] tied up and they put the wine the water
[2:02:56] the liquids in a skin bottle so you're
[2:02:59] the skin
[2:03:00] today amen a skin bottle and then after
[2:03:03] that bottle becomes so old until no wine
[2:03:07] in it or anything it dried
[2:03:10] out Hallelujah we need a fresh
[2:03:12] experience with God the animal oil of
[2:03:15] the skin left it and and see that's the
[2:03:18] fat the animal oil the animal oil of the
[2:03:20] skin left it and then it got hard and
[2:03:27] stiff help us Lord Jesus I don't want to
[2:03:31] be hard and stiff be so
[2:03:35] mean I don't want to be that way
[2:03:38] Jesus always trying to give somebody you
[2:03:40] know you cross me I'm going to give you
[2:03:42] a piece of my mind if you keep giving
[2:03:44] out pieces of your
[2:03:47] [Music]

[2:03:52] you won't have no
[2:03:59] mind that's right
[2:04:05] brother it says uh they made out of an
[2:04:08] animal skin animal skin I'm sorry an
[2:04:11] animal oil of the skin left it and then
[2:04:13] it got hard and stiff and I see what
[2:04:17] Jesus meant then if you put new wine
[2:04:20] unfermented
[2:04:22] wine into a bottle like
[2:04:25] that and that new wine had life in it it
[2:04:30] went to working and fermenting it would
[2:04:34] burst the bottle and that's the way you
[2:04:38] take the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[2:04:40] put it in an old dry formal cide it'll
[2:04:45] blow up as sure as the world you just
[2:04:48] can't have it like that
[2:04:51] he says you try to take the baptism of
[2:04:54] the Holy Ghost with an old experience of
[2:04:56] some long drwn out Church experience
[2:04:58] it'll blow up as sure as the world but
[2:05:01] new wine said Jesus goes in new bottles
[2:05:07] the new bottles has steal the animal oil
[2:05:10] in the skins that means you got some
[2:05:14] fat
