[1:39] get Glory out of it but it's for the

[2:13] people Lord God oh Lord bless the people
[2:15] Lord God and be with us in the service
[2:17] in the precious name of Jesus Christ
[2:20] amen amen so we are continuing our
[2:23] journey uh and this is actually going to
[2:26] be this should be the finishing uh of
[2:29] the spiritual gifts of the church part 4
[2:32] um so we're going to turn to First
[2:35] Corinthians H and then we're going to
[2:37] read verses of 1 Corinthians 12 we're
[2:39] going to read verses
[2:41] 29 through
[2:43] 28 and just say Amen once you get
[2:50] there well hold on one second 28 through
[2:55] 29 yeah 28 through 29
[3:02] and it reads here and God have set some
[3:04] in the church first apostles secondarily
[3:07] prophets thirdly teachers after that
[3:10] Miracles then Gifts of healings helps
[3:13] governments diversities of tongues are
[3:16] all Apostles are all prophets are all
[3:19] teachers are all workers of Miracles so
[3:23] we're going to we've actually finished
[3:26] up um and you guys may be seated uh
[3:28] we've actually finished finished up our
[3:31] um kind of working working with these
[3:34] nine spiritual gifts to identify what
[3:36] they are how they're to be operated into
[3:38] the church uh and it's for you to be
[3:40] able to identify in your life if you
[3:42] could see if you have one of these gifts
[3:45] uh and we've already seen these gifts
[3:48] actually operating uh and I like how
[3:50] brother Jack
[3:52] had he feels anger uh and he and uh he
[3:55] had for companionship meaning he wants
[3:57] to speak to his people he's always
[3:59] wanting to speak speak to his people
[4:02] um so we've talked about those non uh
[4:06] spiritual gifts we've experienced them
[4:07] we seeing God working them but in this
[4:10] verse um I believe it's verse 28 there's
[4:13] a little thing in here um a little part
[4:15] in here in verse 28 that talks about
[4:18] helps uh helps in the church um and I
[4:22] like how it says the word helps with a s
[4:25] right and not just help right right
[4:27] meaning that it's a plural thing that
[4:29] it's uh uh it's a it's something where
[4:31] it's it's many people that should be uh
[4:33] doing these things uh and this isn't uh
[4:37] of course this isn't a uh one of the
[4:39] nine spiritual uh spiritual gifts and so
[4:42] I don't know if everybody will have
[4:44] spiritual gifts I don't know that but I
[4:46] know that you can find a place within
[4:49] the body to be beneficial to the body
[4:51] right so you know uh you see the seats
[4:54] you're sitting in uh the partitions that
[4:57] are up the
[5:00] sound stuff that gets put up the camera
[5:02] people can enjoy the stream it doesn't
[5:04] just magically just pop up there you
[5:06] know people are making an actual
[5:09] sacrifice right every single week out of
[5:11] their schedule in order for that to go
[5:14] up so now when the gifts coming into the
[5:16] church as we've experienced and people
[5:18] see it on the stream they're blessed by
[5:20] that right so it's right with his eyes
[5:22] he was making these clicking sounds that
[5:24] was kind of bouncing off the wall so he
[5:25] was able to get it I believe his brain
[5:27] was able to create an image in his mind
[5:30] for him to be able to see that I thought
[5:31] that's really that was a really really
[5:33] cool thing um but the thing about it is
[5:36] God gave you eyes to see right God gave
[5:38] us eyes to see not for not for our uh
[5:41] it's not the job for our ears to be able
[5:43] to do that and the thing about helps in
[5:45] the church is that when someone is not
[5:47] playing their part the body is going to
[5:50] compensate in another way where someone
[5:52] else has got to take over that thing
[5:54] right right and then that causes a
[5:56] strain in the body now the body is not
[5:58] functioning like it should be
[5:59] functioning right that's why Paul said
[6:01] our all eyes are all ears are all the
[6:04] teeth no we all have our individual
[6:06] roles in order to help out and I believe
[6:09] that that's how the gifts uh God is
[6:12] concerned about those things because he
[6:14] wants his church working together God
[6:16] wants to see his body working in Harmony
[6:18] and so that's why I believe when uh
[6:21] annias I believe it was when they came
[6:23] to the uh came up to Peter and they told
[6:25] that lie uh cuz they weren't putting
[6:28] their full share of things they dropped
[6:30] dead right there God didn't want anyone
[6:32] in the church he said you got all these
[6:34] people coming in here and they're giving
[6:36] 100% everyone that's coming up to this
[6:38] line and giving 100% you going to come
[6:39] up in here and then try to cheat the
[6:41] people like that and try to cause
[6:43] Discord God said no I can't have this in
[6:46] my church that's how serious God was
[6:48] because and it's not to scare people you
[6:51] know it's we want we all want we all
[6:53] want to work together we all want to
[6:55] Bear each other's burdens we all want to
[6:57] uh um come to church and be able to
[6:59] enjoy the presence of the Lord without
[7:01] having to you know worry about if this
[7:03] thing be happening or this thing is uh
[7:05] happening so help is a very important uh
[7:08] gift that I believe is a part of the
[7:09] body um it's one of those things where
[7:12] Paul said he said those ones that are
[7:14] not mentioned as much those are the ones
[7:17] that you really got to keep your eye on
[7:19] so I believe I believe help is one of
[7:20] those things right so now we're going to
[7:23] switch off gears um to the Minal gifts
[7:27] of the church that are actually part of
[7:29] the body and of course everyone knows
[7:31] this as the fivefold ministry uh we're
[7:34] going to turn to Ephesians 4 and we're
[7:37] going to read verses uh 11 through 13
[7:40] and so we're kind of going to we're
[7:42] going to going to talk about these so
[7:43] we're going to talk about how the
[7:46] fivefold ministry fits in also with
[7:49] these nine spiritual gifts to complete
[7:51] the
[7:53] church so Ephesians 4
[7:56] 11-13 and the Bible says and he gave
[7:58] some apostles and some prophets and some
[8:01] evangelists and some pastors and
[8:03] teachers for the perfecting of the
[8:05] Saints for the work of the ministry for
[8:08] the edifying edifying of the body of
[8:10] Christ we're go ahead and read verse 13
[8:12] to till we all come in the unity of the
[8:15] faith and the knowledge of the Son of
[8:17] God unto a perfect man unto the measure
[8:19] of the stature of the fullness of Christ
[8:21] so this work that these five individuals
[8:24] that are doing uh is what unifies Us in
[8:27] faith and what brings us into to a
[8:30] perfect man so when we talk about a
[8:32] perfect man you're talking about some
[8:34] something that is that is now can be
[8:37] presentable to God God can be pleased
[8:39] with this person God can have faith in
[8:40] this person God can trust this person
[8:42] with his word God can tell the person to
[8:44] go that way God can tell the person to
[8:45] go that way and have full confidence
[8:47] that whatever he sends him to do he's
[8:49] going to do it fully right so that is uh
[8:53] the uh work of the uh of the ministry
[8:55] and we're going to start with some
[8:57] preliminary quotes uh out of question
[8:59] questions and answers on the seals
[9:01] preached in 63
[9:03] 0324 and it's paragraph 233 and I know I
[9:06] have a lot of quotes so I'll just I'll
[9:08] just start reading
[9:11] them um and it this was a question that
[9:15] um somebody had asked the prophet and it
[9:18] says with the bride of Christ with the
[9:20] bride of Christ have a Ministry before
[9:22] the
[9:23] Rapture the prophet says sure that's
[9:26] what's going on right now amen see the
[9:28] bride of Christ certainly it is the
[9:30] message of the hour see the bride of
[9:32] Christ sh she consists of Apostles
[9:35] prophets teachers evangelists and
[9:37] pastors is that right that's the bride
[9:40] of Christ sure she's got a Ministry
[9:42] great ministry the ministry of the hour
[9:44] it'll be so humble amen right so we all
[9:48] have a Ministry and we're going to read
[9:50] out of the message perseverance uh
[9:52] preaching 62 and 0 0218 paragraph
[9:58] 240 just to kind of kind of uh hammer
[10:01] this thing
[10:06] down it says 240 it says now he set in
[10:09] the church to keep the church in line
[10:11] with the word right so their job is to
[10:13] keep make sure everyone is staying on
[10:15] the word because as your gifts are
[10:17] coming forth and everyone's going to be
[10:19] wanting to use their gifts you know we
[10:21] all got to we always have to make sure
[10:23] that the word is is kept first and that
[10:25] the word is is is in the church and not
[10:28] just the gifts in the church right so
[10:30] now he set in the church to keep the
[10:32] church in line with the word what
[10:33] Apostles prophets teachers pastors
[10:36] evangelists offices of the church now
[10:39] this is an important thing God sent not
[10:42] man called God sent inspired men to keep
[10:45] the church lined up right now what is it
[10:48] gifts of the Spirit in the church not a
[10:50] bunch of fanaticism which just means
[10:52] your own idea what you think about it
[10:54] what you feel about it because that just
[10:56] creates chaos because when when a bunch
[10:58] of people come together
[10:59] they got their own ideas some of you
[11:02] that have been in a marriage you know um
[11:05] now you may have been an American right
[11:07] and you came from your own culture you
[11:09] came from your own household and your H
[11:11] the wife came from her own household the
[11:13] husband came from her own household you
[11:15] know and when they get together they're
[11:16] talking but what they don't see is the
[11:19] differences that they have behind each
[11:21] other so then when they get into the
[11:23] marriage they realized there was a lot
[11:25] of ideas that didn't always match up
[11:27] Line to Line and so now you got to work
[11:29] do that thing right so God sets in order
[11:33] and that's why um I think brother
[11:35] Solomon was was the one that said he
[11:37] when he had uh talking talking about it
[11:38] Sunday that marriage is actually three
[11:40] people it's a man a woman and Christ and
[11:43] Christ is the one that comes down and
[11:45] breaks up all the fanaticism and says
[11:47] hold on a second y'all need to stay
[11:48] right right down in line with this so
[11:51] God creates God calls these five4
[11:53] ministers to come down here uh to keep
[11:56] the church uh in in line with the word
[11:58] so it says not a bunch of fanaticism but
[12:01] truly gifts of the Spirit in the church
[12:03] that's right keeping the church if a
[12:04] real church was ordained of God really
[12:06] filled with the Holy Spirit if sin would
[12:08] appear in a church it would be like it
[12:10] would be another like a a niist for when
[12:12] a real church I walk into one of one I
[12:15] walk into one see all the women and men
[12:17] under the power of the Holy Spirit if
[12:19] somebody had done something wrong the
[12:21] Holy Spirit rise right up reveal it
[12:23] they'd have to clean it up that's the
[12:25] gifts of the Spirit in the church oh God
[12:28] send us a church like that send us like
[12:30] that one you believe it so and what he's
[12:32] saying is that these gifts make sure
[12:35] that the church is clean right because
[12:37] we want a clean church we don't want to
[12:38] just be coming a church and you know
[12:40] everyone living there in everybody
[12:42] living any any old kind of life and
[12:44] allowing any old kind of sin because
[12:46] that's how the church eventually becomes
[12:48] a separated church or you start to have
[12:50] issues in the church and people start
[12:51] living in the church but when the Holy
[12:53] Spirit when the Holy Spirit has full
[12:55] control of the church amen it's the one
[12:57] thing that he does is he always calls
[12:59] out s always calls out sin no matter how
[13:02] much uh God may love you right and he
[13:05] does love us but he does not like sin
[13:08] and we saw that when uh when Christ uh
[13:11] when Christ was in the temple as a as a
[13:13] young child and Mary came up to him and
[13:15] said hey me and your father we were
[13:17] looking for you and he corrected her and
[13:18] said hold on a second God is my father
[13:21] right cuz she had testified of that so
[13:24] the word always comes to correct to make
[13:26] sure that we're staying in line with our
[13:28] testimony he wasn't rebuking her he was
[13:30] actually trying to make sure that she
[13:32] kept her testimony right that the Holy
[13:34] Spirit had overshadowed her so the word
[13:36] was correcting to make sure she was
[13:37] staying in line and that's what God
[13:39] comes with the fivefold ministry so now
[13:42] we're going to read from the samiran
[13:44] church age uh preached in
[13:46] 61206 paragraph 19-20 and this is this
[13:50] is the one that's going to kind of tie
[13:51] it all together uh with the gifts in the
[13:54] church and the ministerial
[13:57] gift and the and we want to see and like
[14:00] I said this first sentence is the most
[14:02] important one God never intended the
[14:04] church to be run by men so the church is
[14:07] not ran by men none of us in here you
[14:11] know you know I love every single one
[14:14] one of you guys and I know you guys love
[14:16] me and I know we may be buddies and
[14:17] friends but ain't no one in this church
[14:20] running it this church is not being run
[14:22] by men right the prophet said God runs
[14:25] his church amen and he runs it through
[14:28] gifts of the spirit right gifts of the
[14:31] Spirit so each one of us has a gift and
[14:34] God wants us to yield that to so he can
[14:36] run his church it says here the gifts of
[14:39] the Spirit is in the church to correct
[14:40] the spirit he's got five ministerial
[14:43] offices in the church first of them is
[14:45] Apostles or missionaries missionar is
[14:47] the highest calling there is Apostle the
[14:49] word missionary means one sent Apostle
[14:51] means one sent and we're going to uh
[14:54] skip down to uh 20 paragraph 20 and it
[14:56] says then in each local church there's
[14:59] nine spiritual gifts so you have the
[15:01] five ministerial gifts and then in each
[15:03] local church there's nine spiritual
[15:05] gifts that come among the people that is
[15:07] knowledge wisdom Gifts of healing
[15:09] working of Miracles speaking with
[15:10] tongues interpretation of tongues and
[15:12] all these things go in each local body
[15:14] and every person in the church has an
[15:17] individual Ministry that means every
[15:20] single one of you guys has a Ministry
[15:23] which means God doesn't just expect you
[15:25] just to come to church and just to sit
[15:27] God wants to work through you God has
[15:29] put a gift inside you and God wants to
[15:31] see you doing something right toefit the
[15:34] church right as a whole and he says and
[15:37] that individual Ministry goes together
[15:40] with the rest of the ministry to edify
[15:42] the body of Christ so you see how we're
[15:45] all in this thing together it's all of
[15:47] us working together it's not one person
[15:49] it's not the just the fivefold ministry
[15:51] or just the gifts of healing or just the
[15:53] gifts of faith for nothing we're all
[15:55] working together in order to edify the
[15:57] body praise God so with this journey
[16:00] we're going to start off with um as the
[16:02] fivefold ministry we're going to start
[16:03] off with the Evangelist all right and
[16:05] this is a Ministry that is the one that
[16:08] gets everybody excited right uh when a
[16:10] when when evangelist comes out when
[16:12] evangelist comes out I feel like he's
[16:14] and I don't want to say it in this way
[16:16] but I feel like evangelists are the
[16:18] famous ones like when you think of like
[16:20] a minister right and you think of an
[16:23] evangelist it's just there's just
[16:24] certain names that you go to and it's
[16:26] just like they kind of have like kind of
[16:27] a Fame in Fame in the uh in the message
[16:30] right right they do they kind of they're
[16:33] like the famous ones that's I don't want
[16:35] to say it like that but it's you know
[16:37] but it's true right because you know
[16:39] evangelists they have such a way of
[16:41] bringing down the spirit of God that is
[16:43] so unique from every other position and
[16:47] so when I think of an evangelist I think
[16:49] of people like brother Diggs I think of
[16:52] brother Burley I think of brother Jewel
[16:54] I remember when I was a kid and brother
[16:56] Jewel I think they called him like the
[16:59] because I mean like when he get
[17:00] preaching and he would just to get to
[17:02] stomping his feet up on the platform and
[17:04] it was just like it was just so much
[17:06] fire and I think also kind of like
[17:08] Donnie Reagan these are people that like
[17:10] when they start preaching they just just
[17:12] explode like they just uh it's just a
[17:15] fire that they have right and so when an
[17:17] evangelist is done preaching is you feel
[17:19] so spiritually energized right you know
[17:22] you feel like can go right down to the
[17:24] gates of hell knock on the door and just
[17:25] smack the devil in the face
[17:29] a pastor may not be able to do that to
[17:31] you a teacher may not be able to do that
[17:32] to you but evangelist just gives you
[17:34] that he just gives you that um where you
[17:36] feel like you can just do anything
[17:39] right you know and and that's why
[17:42] usually when people say when brother
[17:43] Diggs is coming to town you know then
[17:45] then everyone want to come to church or
[17:47] if if if it's was brother digs coming on
[17:48] a Wednesday everybody's coming on a
[17:50] Wednesday to hear Brother Diggs right
[17:52] but it's just it's just their position
[17:54] it's just the way God made them that
[17:56] Charisma that he's given them which is a
[17:58] gift that you can't impersonate that
[18:00] thing you cannot impersonate that thing
[18:02] right uh so we're going to read uh in
[18:04] the message God doesn't call man to
[18:07] judgment without first warning him
[18:09] paragraph
[18:10] 63 uh I mean preaching 63072 but
[18:14] paragraph 107 and we'll see what the
[18:16] prophet said about this uh this uh
[18:20] Evangelistic uh evangelist gift and I'll
[18:22] just go start start reading it says the
[18:24] Evangelist is a special man he's a man
[18:26] that's burning like a fireball runs into
[18:29] a city and preaches his message then
[18:31] gets out of there somewhere else see
[18:33] he's a special man so he's just got he's
[18:36] just got fire he's just got energy he
[18:38] just comes in there preaches his word
[18:40] and then he's on his way right um so an
[18:43] evangelist is uh one of the things that
[18:45] we love about the evangelists is how
[18:47] they bring the blessings of God down
[18:49] they make you realize you can really
[18:50] attain what you're praying for what
[18:52] you're what you're having faith for they
[18:54] make you really really believe that you
[18:56] can do it uh and the opposite side of
[18:58] that is not just the blessings but
[19:00] they're also good at bringing conviction
[19:02] down onto people right bringing uh
[19:04] bringing people into uh conviction and
[19:06] so I like to think of as an evangelist
[19:09] is also a a Christian manager who a
[19:11] Christian minister who preaches to
[19:13] convert the souls he can he can go into
[19:16] a town of people that are not Christian
[19:18] and then when he finishes talking
[19:20] everybody wants to be a Christian now
[19:21] everybody wants to uh serve the Lord now
[19:24] people that didn't didn't know what who
[19:26] God was but they just have that Charis
[19:29] they just have that anointing that they
[19:30] just make anybody want to follow Christ
[19:33] right um and I feel like one of the
[19:35] biggest biggest things uh that are part
[19:38] of that's a part of an evangelist is
[19:39] they have a courage to them right they
[19:41] really really have a courage to them uh
[19:43] because I feel I believe that some of I
[19:45] believe EV a part of the uh the office
[19:48] of an evangelist is they're going to
[19:49] people that don't know God right they're
[19:51] going to people that don't know what uh
[19:54] um uh the uh the first verse of the
[19:56] Bible is or the last verse they don't
[19:58] know any of the books they don't know
[19:59] who Jesus Christ is they may have heard
[20:01] about these things but they don't really
[20:02] know but evangelist comes down there
[20:04] just to convict those souls to make them
[20:06] realize you know you're a sinner but
[20:08] Christ died for you right um and so
[20:11] that's why I believe um that's why I
[20:13] believe that evangelist usually have
[20:15] very powerful testimonies uh when you
[20:18] when you uh look at evangelists and what
[20:20] they go through in life their testimony
[20:22] is just as loud as they are you know
[20:24] what they've gone through right uh so
[20:27] that before they say anything you just
[20:29] can see the walking living example I
[20:31] mean people that have gone through
[20:32] Cancers and stuff like that you just see
[20:34] them walking and talking and then get up
[20:36] here and start ministering you're like
[20:37] this is just a miracle right it just
[20:40] makes you want to believe right so and I
[20:43] guess I kind of want to uh tie this
[20:45] thing to uh an example here we're going
[20:47] to turn to Jonah uh chapter 3 and Verses
[20:52] 4 through
[20:56] five we're going to start with four 4-5
[20:59] now I want you to realize that Jonah was
[21:02] someone that was he was running away
[21:04] from God and God had put him in the
[21:06] belly of a fish and he repented to God
[21:09] and God had delivered this man out of a
[21:11] fish so you can imagine how the people
[21:13] were when they saw this guy a fish pull
[21:17] up on the beach and they saw Jonah just
[21:18] walk out of this fish you can imagine
[21:20] what their what their what their mindset
[21:22] was seeing this man right and so in
[21:25] verse four it says and Jonah began to
[21:27] enter into the city of days journey and
[21:29] he cried and said yet 40 days in Nineveh
[21:31] shall be o be overthrown that's the
[21:34] thing about evangelists they don't need
[21:36] to say much they don't really a couple
[21:39] of verses uh and they just start taking
[21:41] off and that fire just starts building
[21:43] up that's right and in verse five it
[21:45] says so the people of Nineveh believed
[21:47] God and proclaimed a fast and put on
[21:50] sackcloth and from the and I want you to
[21:52] notice this this sentence this last
[21:53] right here from the greatest of them
[21:55] even to the least of them I believe
[21:57] evangelist they capture everybody it
[22:00] doesn't matter who you are everybody
[22:02] will remember an Evangelistic uh uh
[22:04] message right um and then reading in
[22:08] verses
[22:10] 9-1 um it we just see the people says
[22:13] here who can tell if God will turn and
[22:15] repent and turn away his Fierce anger
[22:17] this is what the people are saying that
[22:18] we perish not God saw their works and
[22:20] that they turned from their evil way and
[22:22] God repented of the evil and he said
[22:24] that he would that he would do unto him
[22:25] and he did it not so we see that when
[22:28] Jonah came with this message and the
[22:30] people repentant it was a real
[22:32] repentance it wasn't no dry eyye
[22:35] repentance the people really really
[22:36] repented to God and God stopped the
[22:38] Wrath that he was going to do so the
[22:41] this this position of evangelist they
[22:42] can really really cause conviction on
[22:44] the people and uh allow people to be
[22:47] serious with God right and when you're
[22:49] serious with God then God can uh you
[22:51] know God can come down and make a change
[22:54] so that's the Evangelist next up is the
[22:57] uh the apostle
[22:59] so we're going to go back to that
[23:00] message uh God doesn't call a man to
[23:02] judgment without first warning him uh in
[23:04] 63 we're going to read from paragraph
[23:10] 107 pull that up all right and it says
[23:15] uh let's
[23:17] see okay 107 it says here it says and
[23:20] then we find out the Apostle is a
[23:22] special man he's a Setter in order he's
[23:25] a man that's sent from God to set things
[23:28] in order right so I believe Apostle is
[23:33] kind of like a temporary Pastor right um
[23:36] they're there to kind of make sure that
[23:39] uh things are being set in order before
[23:42] a pastor comes to kind of take on a
[23:44] group of people um we can kind of look
[23:46] at it from a scriptural standpoint when
[23:48] we see the Apostle Paul kind of uh
[23:50] introducing Timothy because Paul was an
[23:53] apostle Paul Paul was not just a prophet
[23:55] and a teacher he was also commissioned
[23:57] to be an apostle as well well and we see
[23:59] him being we see him also laying on the
[24:01] hands I believe and kind of ordaining
[24:04] and blessing Timothy to be the minister
[24:06] for that church and then Paul just went
[24:08] off somewhere else right to set things
[24:10] uh other things in order so they they
[24:13] get a group of people that are believers
[24:15] and they kind of you know start that
[24:16] start that uh start the church off and
[24:19] then God will select a pastor for the
[24:22] group so the Apostle's work is a
[24:24] temporary work is he's not supposed to
[24:25] be there all the time it's a temporary
[24:27] work cuz will elect a pastor and we'll
[24:30] get to that because the pastor is the
[24:31] head of the church right um and the
[24:34] pastor will come in there and then take
[24:35] over the church right and so after that
[24:38] is done the Apostle work is done and he
[24:39] either goes back to his home church or
[24:41] he goes wherever God leads him next uh
[24:44] so we're going to turn to the message
[24:45] Jesus Christ the same um preached in 56
[24:49] paragraph 16 and I'll just go ahead and
[24:52] read it um says but God and for the
[24:56] perfecting of the church has set the
[24:58] church Apostles you say Apostles yes sir
[25:01] now how how would people ever want to
[25:03] change their name and call themselves
[25:04] missionaries instead of Apostles I don't
[25:06] know a missionary and Apostle is exactly
[25:09] the same word uh one cent that's right a
[25:12] missionary is an apostle so that an
[25:15] apostle is a missionary it's one that's
[25:17] been sent and when a man feels LED of
[25:19] God and sent to uh s of God to go to
[25:22] Africa India that makes him an apostle
[25:25] uh and or a missionary right so when you
[25:27] feel God has placed in a calling on you
[25:30] to go to a certain area right that makes
[25:33] you an apostle that makes you a
[25:34] missionary you're going to set things in
[25:36] order for a group of people that are not
[25:39] in order right um and so there's a
[25:42] couple of things that we we kind of want
[25:44] to see with the of this role of apostle
[25:47] uh is because so Paul was not only an
[25:50] apostle Paul was actually the prophet
[25:52] messenger for his age EXA so Paul went
[25:54] around correcting the churches and it's
[25:56] not it's not the job of an apostle to go
[25:58] around correcting churches right because
[26:00] we have the message to uh of the day in
[26:03] each Church to correct us right an
[26:06] apostle just goes and does the work and
[26:08] so and I've seen brother brandom
[26:11] actually
[26:12] mention uh uh males and females as
[26:16] missionaries and so I believe you know
[26:19] people can go to people can do
[26:21] missionary work and I believe I believe
[26:24] what you call them is you call them
[26:25] mission trips right so you're going on
[26:26] the mission to set something in order
[26:29] Set uh um set a group of Believers into
[26:32] order you know some people will you know
[26:34] get a water supply for them some people
[26:36] will get Bibles and message books and
[26:38] get the correct translation for them to
[26:40] be able to read their Bibles and read
[26:41] the message they'll bring food they'll
[26:43] bring clothing uh they'll share the word
[26:45] with them and stuff like that uh and
[26:47] it's a of course like I said it's a
[26:49] temporary work because you're not going
[26:51] there going there to conquer so if you
[26:53] have a missionary you have a mission
[26:54] you're going to an area and you've been
[26:57] there for years that's not missionary
[26:59] work you you're you're conquering right
[27:02] you know and we can see that with the uh
[27:04] with the Catholic church and where they
[27:06] went wrong and also you hear about the
[27:08] if you've read in history about the
[27:09] Crusades where people were going in the
[27:12] name of God to go and convert the people
[27:14] and if you know the people ain't believe
[27:15] they throw them in jail and build up
[27:17] churches for them and they forc people
[27:19] into a religion in order to keep that
[27:22] religion they set the military there but
[27:25] when God doesn't the holy spirit is what
[27:27] keeps the people together you don't have
[27:28] to worry about converting people or
[27:30] forcing people to serve God no God knows
[27:33] exactly who's his own God knows exactly
[27:35] who he needs to go to and and the Holy
[27:37] Spirit will keep them and you don't have
[27:39] to worry about staying there and
[27:41] watching over them to make sure are they
[27:42] going to still are they still going to
[27:44] live this are they going to still live
[27:45] that no the same holy ghost in Africa uh
[27:47] is the same holy ghost in the United
[27:49] States is the same holy ghost in Europe
[27:51] and it will always keep his people by
[27:53] the word right so right so that's a
[27:55] tempor that's that's a temporary work
[27:57] and um and I believe that the uh the
[28:01] Apostle is is is the head of that thing
[28:03] because he's ordained to this uh uh he's
[28:06] ordained to this uh position in the fful
[28:08] ministry to be the head of it because it
[28:10] has to be by the word right it has to be
[28:12] by the word the fful ministry is by the
[28:14] word so the next person that we have up
[28:17] on here is the prophet and this one is
[28:20] uh this one can be a this one can be
[28:22] very very confusing because you see the
[28:24] word Prophet all over the place in the
[28:26] Bible we all know we have a prophet of
[28:28] our age um but I believe brother Brandon
[28:31] kind of clears this thing up for us
[28:33] about the differences between these
[28:35] things so we're going to turn to the
[28:36] message the voice of the sign preached
[28:38] in 64 0214 and it's paragraphs 81-
[28:45] 83 um because and um the because the
[28:49] prophet has also he preached the message
[28:52] a year before that referring to prophets
[28:54] as seers and I'm not the one I I am not
[28:57] a person that will be to uh correct a
[28:59] prophet so I believe however you kind of
[29:02] Define if you define a prophet how the
[29:03] prophet is defined it's it's okay I'm
[29:06] I'm just kind of just shedding shedding
[29:08] some light on you know what I've kind of
[29:10] read through uh these things and based
[29:12] off what he said so this is paragraph 81
[29:15] he says now the English word a prophet
[29:17] just means a preacher and the prophet
[29:20] has gone on and said that a new
[29:22] testament Prophet is a preacher right
[29:25] see anybody every preacher is a prophet
[29:27] cuz he for telling something preaching
[29:30] the word under inspiration is called a
[29:32] prophet but when we read versus uh
[29:34] paragraph I mean paragraph 82 but in the
[29:36] Old Testament they were more than that
[29:39] they were seers see they were man that
[29:41] they were men who told things that was
[29:43] coming to pass and happened that give
[29:45] the rights to be The Interpreter of the
[29:47] word for that day because God took the
[29:50] word of the day and interpreted it
[29:52] himself through that man and that's what
[29:53] come for that's what come on the earth
[29:55] for he always is a sign when a prophet
[29:57] comes on Earth just watch as we go
[29:59] through and see if it isn't so he always
[30:00] sends a prophet and when you see a
[30:02] prophet rise on the scene look out we're
[30:04] looking for uh one to come right so and
[30:09] and in this in this instance because
[30:11] when you read the New Testament you'll
[30:14] see that there were people that also
[30:15] because a lot of times we refer to
[30:17] prophets uh we reference vision and
[30:20] prophecies and stuff like that and it is
[30:22] true there are people in the New
[30:24] Testament that have visions there was a
[30:26] guy uh named uh an anas and God gave him
[30:29] a vision to go and talk to Paul or Saul
[30:33] and to uh start his work right and so he
[30:35] gave him a vision right so um but I I um
[30:40] and like I said this this is kind of
[30:42] brother Jack he can correct me later on
[30:44] uh but this is kind of my personal uh uh
[30:46] thought on this is that uh as just as
[30:49] the prophet said uh uh there's a
[30:51] difference between a prophet Seer and
[30:52] then also a prophet preacher within the
[30:54] fivefold ministry the fivefold ministry
[30:56] you're carrying the word right you're
[30:58] actually carrying the word so you so you
[31:00] have to be able to rightly divide the
[31:02] word right it's not it's it's it's it's
[31:05] it's a lot it's a lot it's it's it is
[31:07] seeing V seeing visions is very very
[31:09] important but you have to be able to uh
[31:11] um preach the word in season out of
[31:13] season if you come up here and you're
[31:15] preaching a message and it's just all
[31:16] over the place I I don't know if I can
[31:19] fit you into the fivefold ministry I
[31:21] can't I don't know if if uh if that if
[31:23] that is a gift of God working through
[31:25] you uh but the people aren't being
[31:27] blessed by it right and so I what you
[31:30] can kind of I guess you can kind of look
[31:32] at this as an example is like when you
[31:34] kind of see motivational speakers now
[31:36] motivational speakers um they'll come to
[31:39] you and they'll say hey if you invest in
[31:41] your dreams in tomorrow you won't feel
[31:43] the I mean if you investing your dreams
[31:44] today you won't feel the guilt tomorrow
[31:46] right and so they kind of kind of try to
[31:48] uplift you up and they're very and
[31:50] they're very if you notice a lot of
[31:51] motivational preachers are very very
[31:53] preachy as well you can you can ask
[31:55] those ones as they grow up some of them
[31:57] benefited from and some of them didn't
[31:59] but that person was trying to forell you
[32:00] of something right so and I think that's
[32:03] kind of the difference between a prophet
[32:05] is that he is a preacher right um and
[32:08] he's able to uh uh uh handle the word um
[32:13] and so uh that's what I believe um you
[32:15] call that's why I believe as the prophet
[32:17] as in a fivefold Ministry someone that
[32:19] can come preach the word because if you
[32:20] you even notice with brother brandom you
[32:22] know when brother Brandon would come and
[32:24] he would preach right he would preach
[32:27] the word and the word would come forth
[32:28] then after the preaching of the word
[32:30] then he would have the prayer line then
[32:32] he would see Visions as people that come
[32:35] so those were two different roles that
[32:36] he was doing when the Visions when the
[32:38] when when he came to the prayer line he
[32:40] was seeing the Visions he wasn't
[32:41] preaching to the people he was just
[32:42] repeating the Visions as hey hey God I
[32:44] see this I see that I see that and that
[32:46] but when he was preaching it's no it's
[32:48] not a time for prayer line this for the
[32:50] time for the word to come forth in order
[32:52] to get into the hearts of the people and
[32:54] the reason why I say this is because you
[32:57] don't want people to get confused when
[32:59] cuz I believe people can still see
[33:00] Visions brother brandham said his son
[33:03] was a prophet and I believe it and I
[33:05] believe people today still see visions
[33:07] and stuff like that but you got to be
[33:09] careful about how you fit because one
[33:11] you got to be if if you want to say
[33:13] you're a prophet in the fivefold
[33:14] ministry you have to be able to handle
[33:16] the word which means you got to be able
[33:17] to rightly divide it right because you
[33:19] don't want people kind of mixing into
[33:22] stuff and that's where the problem comes
[33:24] when you know someone will get a someone
[33:27] will get a gift of prophecy on them and
[33:28] they'll they'll say utterance and
[33:30] they'll prophesy on somebody and all of
[33:31] a sudden now they believe that
[33:33] everything that they say is you know
[33:35] they're a prophet it's like no no no no
[33:37] no no no you got to you got to keep it
[33:39] in order and make sure you define these
[33:41] things correctly so that it doesn't lift
[33:43] you up right yes so that is uh the
[33:48] prophet uh in the fold fold
[33:51] Ministry and then next we're going to
[33:53] talk about uh is the pastor right so
[33:56] we're going to go to he Hebrews uh the
[33:58] message Hebrews chapter 7 it was
[34:01] preached in 57 uh and 0922 and paragraph
[34:05] uh
[34:10] 282 so it says here that but the full
[34:14] and complete authority of the church is
[34:17] the pastor read that in the Bible see if
[34:20] that's not Bible order that's exactly
[34:22] right there is no one above the Elder uh
[34:26] this is this is what the prophet is
[34:27] saying he says I have nothing to do with
[34:29] what brother Neville does here that's up
[34:31] to you and brother Neville if brother
[34:34] Neville wanted to preach Jehovah Witness
[34:35] Doctrine that's up to him and you and
[34:38] this was brandom Tabernacle right you
[34:41] see if he wanted to preach anything he
[34:43] wanted to that's between you and him
[34:45] that's all right if the congregation
[34:47] votes for him there to preach that
[34:49] that's all right that's up to him right
[34:52] so the pastor uh the the prophet said
[34:54] the Pastor is the full and complete
[34:56] authority of the church uh so you may
[35:00] have Apostles you may have evangelists
[35:02] you may have teachers you may have
[35:04] prophets uh but these positions still
[35:06] need a home Church you can't say you're
[35:08] an evangelist you can't say you're a
[35:09] teacher you can't say you're a prophet
[35:11] and then not going to church no
[35:14] everybody has a
[35:15] pastor right and so if if these
[35:18] positions that are called from God which
[35:20] the high positions have a pastor that
[35:22] means every single body on the face of
[35:25] the Earth need think about it every cuz
[35:27] God expects everyone to follow him every
[35:30] single body on the face of the Earth and
[35:32] this is why it's such a big position
[35:34] everybody on the face of the earth needs
[35:36] a pastor Amen brother brandham even
[35:38] referred to uh as Jezebel when he she
[35:41] said cuz she wasn't in line with the
[35:43] word but he still referred to Elijah as
[35:45] her pastor whether she wanted it or not
[35:48] still referred to her as that was her
[35:50] pastor that's right right so everybody
[35:53] needs a pastor everyone has to go to
[35:55] church everyone needs a home Church
[35:57] Church all right and the pastor is uh is
[35:59] the head of the church he's the one
[36:01] that's in charge um and it's it's the
[36:03] position in the fivefold ministry that
[36:05] it's the only position in the F Ministry
[36:07] that actually comes with qualifications
[36:09] and that's just to show the importance
[36:12] of the position right so and and it
[36:14] doesn't mean that the pastor is a
[36:16] dictator right no he's there to Serve
[36:18] the People he's there to protect the
[36:20] people he's there to help the people the
[36:22] prophet said that a pastor is likened to
[36:23] a Shepherd it is protecting sheep he's
[36:26] there to be your protor he's there to
[36:28] look out for you which is why it's it's
[36:30] it's it's of such uh uh importance you
[36:33] know so a pastoring uh cuz a lot of
[36:35] people can get it a lot of people can
[36:37] get it wrong pastoring is not just
[36:38] preaching it's not just coming up behind
[36:40] a pull pit and you just preaching a
[36:42] sermon every Sunday and preaching every
[36:44] Wednesday no no no no you're there to
[36:46] serve the people after the church
[36:48] because when people in the church
[36:50] everyone's feeling good but the battles
[36:51] really come through the week uh and so
[36:54] if you feel led you know just to be a
[36:56] preacher you might just be a prop
[36:58] right but but a pastor is a lot more is
[37:01] a lot more than that and so we're going
[37:03] to we're going to read from the message
[37:05] God doesn't call a man to judgment once
[37:07] again preaching 63 to see what the
[37:09] prophet said of uh of a pastor to to
[37:12] really really fully understand what this
[37:15] um what this role
[37:18] encompasses um and right and and it's
[37:20] important for you as a church to
[37:22] understand what these positions are and
[37:24] these different gifts are because you
[37:26] don't go to a teacher if you're looking
[37:29] for someone to Bear your burdens which
[37:31] is supposed to be the pastor you don't
[37:33] go to leadership to an apostle if you
[37:35] have an A if you have a pastor in your
[37:37] church right you have to make sure that
[37:38] you know these roles and how they
[37:40] operate amen all right so we're going to
[37:43] read uh I believe it's paragraph uh
[37:47] 104 and what it says here is but you see
[37:52] in the church there is the pastor and
[37:54] the pastor is a special person he's
[37:56] built to where he can he can put up with
[37:58] the fusses of the people he's a burden
[38:00] Bearer he's the ax of the team he's a
[38:02] man that can sit down when when uh
[38:05] somebody's got something against
[38:06] somebody else and sit down with them two
[38:09] families and take neither side and
[38:12] reason it out and bring it right back
[38:14] into sweetness see he's a pastor he
[38:16] knows how to take care of things and so
[38:18] I want you to notice it didn't say
[38:20] anything about preaching in that it
[38:22] didn't say nothing about the preaching
[38:24] it talked about dealing with the people
[38:26] and they
[38:28] being able to take these two sides
[38:31] because it's very political these things
[38:33] get very very political and and politics
[38:36] is I know we don't bring politics in
[38:38] church but when you're dealing with a
[38:40] lot of people and different ideas it
[38:42] always gets political and the pastor has
[38:44] to be somebody that doesn't have any
[38:46] point of view he doesn't he doesn't
[38:48] agree with any point of view and he just
[38:49] sets the people down and just kind of
[38:51] bears with them because the problems and
[38:54] I mean you see with our political State
[38:56] now uh problem problems don't just get
[38:58] solved in one
[38:59] day it may take time for people to kind
[39:02] of get over their differences but a
[39:04] pastor he's gifted in a way that the
[39:06] prophet says he can reason it out and
[39:08] bring it right back into sweetness so if
[39:10] you can't do that you're probably not
[39:12] called to be to be a
[39:15] pastor right it's more it's more than
[39:17] just preaching right and brother Jack
[39:19] had told me that you know one time he
[39:21] had preached before a congregation and
[39:23] he said that he could feel the burden of
[39:25] the people uh and what that means is
[39:28] that he a pastor is able to is able to
[39:31] Bear your burdens right he's a person
[39:33] that can bear your burdens he knows what
[39:35] you're feeling he knows what you're
[39:36] going through you know he's someone you
[39:38] can talk to he's someone you can uh sit
[39:40] down with he's someone you can share
[39:42] your problems with because he's
[39:43] literally built to Bear what you're
[39:45] dealing with so you don't have to bear
[39:47] it by yourself amen right all right so
[39:50] that's the pastor right so you got to
[39:51] pray for your pastors right they're the
[39:53] they're the quarterback of the of the
[39:56] church and so
[39:57] lastly um what we'll talk about uh is uh
[40:01] the teacher all right and we'll see the
[40:04] importance of this role uh especially
[40:06] with a theme of this year because uh a
[40:08] teacher is also a very special role
[40:10] right uh and teaching is is associated
[40:13] with uh
[40:14] restoration right so back in that
[40:17] message of God doesn't call a man to
[40:19] judgment without warning him first we're
[40:21] going to see what the prophet said about
[40:22] a preacher is in paragraph
[40:25] 106 and the prophet says the teacher is
[40:27] a special man he sits back under the
[40:30] anointing of the spirit and is able to
[40:31] take the words and put them together by
[40:33] the holy spirit that the pastor or
[40:35] evangelist either one could not compare
[40:38] with him that's right right so it's a
[40:40] whole different Ministry than uh uh than
[40:43] um the other Ministries and so we're
[40:46] going to read uh in questions and
[40:48] answers uh preaching
[40:50] 5401 038 and uh paragraph 20 through 23
[40:55] we're going to see exactly this
[40:58] how important uh this position
[41:05] is
[41:07] okay and it's paragraph 20 through
[41:10] 23 all right and I'll just start reading
[41:12] it and it says and a man's got to have a
[41:15] leader and the leader is the Holy Spirit
[41:18] and the holy spirit sets in the church
[41:19] first apostles after that prophets and
[41:21] so forth someone said someone said not
[41:24] long ago said why brother Brandon we
[41:25] don't need anybody to teach us
[41:27] when the Holy Ghost comes we don't need
[41:29] anybody to teach he said the Bible says
[41:31] you don't you do not need teaching I
[41:34] said then why did the same Holy Spirit
[41:36] set in the church teachers see see and
[41:40] set the church in order they would we
[41:43] got to have teachers that's right but
[41:45] you oughtn't to have anyone don't have
[41:47] don't have to teach you saying Thou
[41:49] shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not
[41:51] swear and take you already know that
[41:53] your very conscience of the of the Holy
[41:55] Spirit tells you it's wrong to do that
[41:56] so that's not not teaching a lot of
[41:58] people think they I just read the Bible
[42:00] and have God teach me no that's that's
[42:02] that's not teaching 23 says but now as
[42:05] far as spiritual teaching it takes a
[42:07] holy ghost anointed that's right and God
[42:10] has set the church in order by Apostles
[42:11] and Prophets gives a healing and
[42:13] miracles and so forth he sets in the
[42:14] church in order and puts teachers and so
[42:16] forth in there to guide and direct his
[42:18] church uh um and then we're going to
[42:20] also read from Hebrews uh chapter 5 and
[42:25] six uh and it's number the number one
[42:28] sermon and it's preaching 57 and it's
[42:31] paragraph
[42:33] 51-52 and I'll go to read that quickly
[42:38] watch she's pulling it up so it says
[42:40] Paul speaking to this Hebrew group yet
[42:43] Scholars he is speaking to now Scholars
[42:45] we well learned we find that in a few a
[42:47] few moments very very scholarly but the
[42:49] Deep spiritual mystery the church is
[42:51] still blinded to it he said when you
[42:53] ought to be teaching others you're still
[42:54] a babe oh I know there's many rise up
[42:57] and go out and say oh I don't need to go
[42:59] to church anymore praise God the Holy
[43:01] Ghost has come he's the teacher when you
[43:04] get that idea you're wrong for why did
[43:06] the Holy Ghost set teachers in the
[43:07] church if he was going to be the teacher
[43:10] see there's first apostles prophets
[43:11] teachers evangelist and pastors the holy
[43:13] spirit sets teachers in the church so he
[43:15] could teach through the teacher and if
[43:17] it isn't according to the word God
[43:19] doesn't confirm it then it isn't the
[43:20] right kind of teaching that must compare
[43:22] with the entire Bible right so teaching
[43:25] is important because
[43:27] um so when you think about the mind of
[43:30] God right I I I would say that
[43:33] evangelists are in the Forefront of the
[43:35] Forefront of of the mind of God prophets
[43:37] are in the Forefront of the mind of God
[43:39] Apostles are in the Forefront of the
[43:40] mind of God that's where God is doing
[43:43] kind of like the initial work I'll say
[43:45] pastors would be kind of like in the
[43:46] middle but teachers are in the back side
[43:49] back side of the mind of God so when
[43:50] anointing comes down every single
[43:53] position in the ministry catches
[43:54] something and a teacher catches the
[43:56] backside mind or what God really means
[43:59] about his word right so a teacher is
[44:01] someone is uh uh they tell you when
[44:04] they're telling you about the word of
[44:05] God they're they're giving you an
[44:06] interpretation saying hey this is what
[44:08] God means when he says this thing this
[44:11] is what God really means or when he says
[44:12] this thing this is what God really means
[44:14] and questions and answers preached in 61
[44:17] paragraph 51 you'll see the PE uh the
[44:19] the prophet will say um someone had
[44:22] asked the question God called me to be a
[44:24] teacher Pro the prophet said watch how
[44:26] he interprets the word see if he gets it
[44:29] all mixed up and everything then you can
[44:31] tell that he's not a teacher right you
[44:33] can tell that he's not a teacher If he
[44:35] if he gets the thing all mixed up and
[44:37] stuff like that that's not coming from
[44:38] the mind of God but when everything he
[44:40] says you can take it from Genesis all
[44:43] the way to Revelation and it lines up
[44:45] then you know that you have a complete
[44:47] the complete thought of God uh uh and
[44:49] the mindset of what God had uh uh what
[44:52] God was meaning right so a teacher is uh
[44:55] is God's interpreter of the word that's
[44:57] why you can't stay home and read your
[44:59] Bible and I will even go further to say
[45:02] this uh humbly that you can't just stay
[45:04] home and listen to the tapes that's
[45:06] right you can't just stay home and
[45:07] listen to the tapes um because there are
[45:11] a lot there are a lot of things and even
[45:13] and a lot of us have been in the message
[45:15] now you know a lot of us been in the
[45:16] message for years and there are things
[45:18] that people don't agree with about what
[45:20] the prophet said right so you need
[45:22] someone to come down at God can say this
[45:24] is what God meant or this is what the
[45:27] prophet meant so that's why you can't
[45:29] stay at home and listen to tapes because
[45:32] and when you think about that if you're
[45:35] if you're at home and you're just
[45:36] listening to tapes you're just you're
[45:38] just you're just hearing the prophet in
[45:40] the tapes tells you that that's wrong
[45:42] amen the tapes tell you that they're
[45:44] wrong exactly right so if you can't
[45:47] understand that basic stuff what else
[45:49] are you missing exactly what else are
[45:51] you missing amen there's got to be other
[45:54] things that you're uh uh that you're
[45:55] missing that you're not understand and
[45:57] the Bible says that the bride has made
[45:59] herself ready and what is it with it's
[46:02] with the word and what that means is the
[46:04] bride knows what pleases God right so
[46:08] how can you know what pleases God if you
[46:10] don't understand what he's saying so
[46:13] when you're staying at home and you're
[46:14] listening to tapes and you're you're
[46:16] you're ignoring the authority of the
[46:18] fold Ministry you're ignoring the pastor
[46:21] that's in that's ordained for your area
[46:23] you're ignoring the teachers you're
[46:24] ignoring the prophet how can you please
[46:27] God how can God how can you expect to be
[46:30] in a Rapture when God comes back and
[46:33] he's expecting to see a word bride not
[46:36] just people that are enthusias about
[46:38] being in the message and listening to
[46:39] the message but God's coming back to see
[46:41] a bride fully clothed in the word how
[46:44] can you expect to make the Rapture
[46:47] praise God when there are people that
[46:48] are keeping the word and the Bible said
[46:50] that there were two types of virgins
[46:52] both were virgins one was uh wise and
[46:55] one was foolish and the difference was
[46:57] was oil right which was the Holy Spirit
[47:00] which is a teacher which teaches you to
[47:02] plead what what you need the life you
[47:04] need to live to please God so that uh uh
[47:08] it'll be acceptable and uh just to kind
[47:10] of see a type of that one of a story
[47:13] that I uh that's just a beautiful story
[47:15] in the Bible is Esther right Esther is a
[47:18] a beautiful type of this thing and I'll
[47:20] just kind of go to that and read a
[47:21] little bit of it um so you can turn to
[47:24] Esther uh chapter
[47:27] chapter
[47:29] 2 uh we can start at verse 7 uh and I
[47:33] like Esther because it's a short book
[47:35] but it's got so many good nuggets that
[47:39] we can uh bring and type to what we're
[47:41] at today so I'll start reading uh from
[47:44] verse S and it says and he brought up
[47:47] hadassa that is Esther his uncle's
[47:49] daughter for she had neither father nor
[47:52] mother and I like that how the Bible
[47:55] kind of starts this thing out for you
[47:56] had uh father nor mother meaning that
[47:58] she didn't she didn't have a beginning
[48:01] right you can kind of type it as she
[48:02] didn't have a beginning and anything
[48:04] that has the beginning has the end so
[48:06] this is kind of a type of predestination
[48:09] and when you receive the baptism of the
[48:11] Holy Spirit you no longer have a father
[48:13] and a mother because you have a new
[48:15] birth right you're a new creature and
[48:17] and I'm not saying that you just go home
[48:19] and say you know tell your dad that you
[48:21] ain't my dad no more you know you're not
[48:23] my mama no more I a't I ain't saying all
[48:26] that that but the Bible says you are a
[48:30] new creature and that's how and when you
[48:32] noticed how Jesus languaged when he was
[48:34] on the cross and Mary had cried the
[48:36] prophet said he called her woman didn't
[48:37] call her mother so when you've received
[48:39] the baptism the Holy Spirit you no
[48:41] longer have a father and mother because
[48:42] you've been born again you have a new
[48:44] birth right and so what we're then going
[48:48] to read
[48:50] um let's see it's down here to uh
[48:57] give me one
[49:01] second um and I just kind of I just kind
[49:05] of it's I just kind of say the overview
[49:07] of it but what what happens here is that
[49:10] um Esther and the prophet will talk
[49:12] about this in the in the message Esther
[49:15] is being presented to goba uh all these
[49:17] women are coming together because um the
[49:20] king is uh trying to get a new Queen
[49:22] vasy wasn't uh living according to what
[49:24] he wanted and so now this King uh this
[49:28] great king is now trying to choose a new
[49:30] wife right and so Esther is um now it's
[49:34] her turn to go before the king and she
[49:38] and they ask if she wants to wear
[49:40] jewelry and all of these other stuff and
[49:42] she just rejects all of it right uh and
[49:45] the B and what the Bible says is that
[49:46] she didn't take all of that and brother
[49:48] brandom typed that to the world she
[49:50] didn't take any of the world on her she
[49:52] didn't want none of she didn't want
[49:53] nothing what the world wanted even
[49:55] though everybody else want it and notice
[49:57] they were all virgins not just Esther
[50:00] all of them were virgins right they
[50:01] lived the life right but she didn't want
[50:04] the jewelry she didn't want the the
[50:06] dressing and all that that they had but
[50:08] what it says you'll notice in the Bible
[50:10] that there was a unic in the Bible that
[50:12] his name was haay and she own the Bible
[50:15] says that she only took the vi the
[50:17] advice of this unic who she had found
[50:20] favor with right so she you can look at
[50:23] that as a type of her being taught what
[50:26] it was to please the King right so in
[50:29] order to please the king you have to be
[50:31] taught to do it right you can't go with
[50:33] what the popularity or the popular
[50:35] opinion is right that gets you rejected
[50:38] by the king and so when Esther came
[50:40] before The King The King was like wow
[50:43] this is exactly what I wanted well how
[50:45] did she know right she took the advice
[50:48] of this unic right amen and so we know
[50:51] that a unic is someone that is uh
[50:53] consecrated uh is uh is living a life of
[50:56] kind of cons cration if you turn to
[50:58] Matthew uh
[51:02] 1912 we'll see uh Jesus Christ speak
[51:05] about this um this Bible verse and I
[51:08] think I had I read this a couple a
[51:10] couple weeks ago says for there are some
[51:12] Unix which were so born from their
[51:15] mother's womb and there are some Unix
[51:17] which were Unix of men and there be Unix
[51:20] which have made themselves Unix for the
[51:22] kingdom of Heaven's Sake right so uh a
[51:25] unic is some it's unit can be is it can
[51:28] be a type of someone that has
[51:29] consecrated their work for a service so
[51:31] this this uh hay guy person was a unic
[51:35] and he was consecrating his service for
[51:37] the King right and so
[51:40] um we can look at brother brandom as a
[51:44] type because a lot of times people
[51:46] worship brother brandham but they don't
[51:48] understand the role that he that he uh
[51:50] uh played and you can see it in the type
[51:51] of Isaac and choosing of the Bride
[51:53] brother Brandon was actually put on to
[51:55] the scene to prepare us in order to be
[51:58] received by Christ and we know that
[52:00] brother brandom consecrated his life to
[52:03] God because brother brandom you don't
[52:06] understand that the gift that brother
[52:07] brandham had he could have been a great
[52:10] man the gift that he had during his day
[52:12] he could have been a popular man he
[52:14] could have made a lot of money and in
[52:16] fact it was a struggle for him because I
[52:19] remember I think he was one time he was
[52:20] going in or he was in or Robert's church
[52:23] and he was wishing that he know man I
[52:25] wish I had some things like that and God
[52:26] said you know your your Porsche is in
[52:29] heaven and the uh the prophecy had come
[52:31] to him and said because you chose the
[52:33] harder route which is my way right
[52:36] you've chose the right way so we know
[52:37] that the prophet that we have right now
[52:39] he's consecrated his life in service it
[52:42] wasn't for him to become a great man but
[52:44] it was it was for him to prepare each
[52:46] and every single one of us to be
[52:48] presentable to God right that's what his
[52:50] service was now a lot of time and so you
[52:53] got to be careful because teaching is is
[52:56] is teaching is the heart of the things
[52:58] right so the Bible says in the beginning
[53:01] by one man fell which was Adam and so by
[53:04] one man must everybody be restored which
[53:06] is Christ and you notice that actually
[53:09] the first sermon uh the first sermon or
[53:12] the first uh yeah I guess you could say
[53:14] the first sermon or the first church
[53:16] meeting was actually uh uh in the Bible
[53:18] that we can see that we see in the Bible
[53:20] was a teaching and that was when God
[53:22] told Adam hey there's this tree of
[53:24] knowledge of Good and Evil and there's
[53:26] this uh Tree of Life eat from this tree
[53:29] right and you'll be okay and if you eat
[53:31] from that tree you'll perish and that
[53:33] was a teaching he was teaching them how
[53:35] to please God then the serpent came
[53:38] around and said oh Eve you'll surely not
[53:40] die and that was an anti- teing that was
[53:43] teaching them to not please God right
[53:45] and the reason why that uh and that
[53:48] that's how you can tell brother brandham
[53:49] said is if someone gets their teaching
[53:51] mixed up that uh that interpretation was
[53:54] the wrong interpretation because when
[53:56] they took from that tree they did die
[53:59] right the serpent told them that it
[54:00] wasn't going to die but God meant
[54:02] exactly what he taught to them that
[54:03] you're going to die and they and they
[54:05] exactly did die so a teacher has to come
[54:07] and interpret the word so a lot of
[54:10] people can believe the signs and the
[54:12] gifts and the healings and all that
[54:14] stuff and you got to be careful about
[54:15] that cuz um we're going to listen to
[54:17] what the prophet has said about a story
[54:19] about a guy so it's in the it's uh the
[54:21] message the queen of Queen of the South
[54:23] preached in
[54:25] 61127 e it's paragraph
[54:28] 89-90 and we're going to be closing in
[54:30] uh in a
[54:32] few we're going to see how uh important
[54:35] uh teaching is
[54:42] um okay so it says the prophet says here
[54:45] not long ago there was a man in a
[54:47] certain meeting just didn't believe in
[54:49] my teaching on the Bible and he goes to
[54:52] the meeting a certain fellow did and not
[54:54] knowing that I know about it cuz he's no
[54:56] more than saying it and I seen it in a
[54:58] vision in my hotel room I don't know I
[55:01] don't see how some people can do that
[55:03] and come up and say these things when
[55:05] you know you know better see you can't
[55:08] get past you can't get past the prophet
[55:10] right so he said now brother brandham
[55:13] this is what the guy has said he said
[55:15] now brother brandham is a prophet of the
[55:17] Lord he said but don't listen to his
[55:19] teaching because he's wrong so some
[55:22] people can believe the healing some
[55:23] people can believe the uh the gifts in
[55:25] the church and blessings and all that
[55:27] kind of stuff but when someone says a
[55:30] teaching is wrong you you got to really
[55:33] be careful that's what's restoring you
[55:35] back to God gifts and all that stuff are
[55:37] without repentance but in order to be
[55:40] taught and if you and if you
[55:42] realize teaching is uh teaching is what
[55:46] is being is what restoring us back to
[55:48] God so when you think of messages like
[55:50] marriage divorce that was a teaching
[55:52] right that restored what the purpose of
[55:55] marriage and divorce was because people
[55:57] had gotten away from it Paul had to
[55:59] preach it Jesus Christ had to teach it
[56:01] as well because people had gotten off of
[56:03] it you know the Pharisees that said you
[56:05] know Moses gave us a letter of divorce
[56:07] that was a wrong teaching because that
[56:09] wasn't what God that wasn't the backside
[56:11] of God in the beginning of the uh uh in
[56:14] the beginning of the garden there was no
[56:16] such thing as divorce right they had
[56:18] been taught to do something which God
[56:20] allowed but it wasn't the backside of
[56:23] God's mind and that's what a teacher
[56:24] does they get back there and say no this
[56:26] is what God really expects out of you
[56:29] right so he says but don't listen to his
[56:31] teaching because he's wrong the same
[56:33] holy spirit that preached the service
[56:35] tonight the same Holy Spirit preaches
[56:37] all these things is the same holy spirit
[56:38] that discerns the thoughts of the heart
[56:40] certainly and in verse 9 he says what is
[56:43] the mark of a prophet he's a Divine
[56:45] interpreter of the of the Divine word
[56:48] and so a teacher is of course under that
[56:51] position of a prophet because a prophet
[56:53] comes with the fullness of the word and
[56:55] a teacher comes under that and I want
[56:56] you to realize that teaching is not an
[56:58] intellectual thing it it's something
[57:01] that is divine God gets a hold of a man
[57:03] and while they're reading the Bible
[57:05] while they're uhh reading the uh What uh
[57:08] uh uh the mysteries of God God is
[57:10] unveiling himself to that person that
[57:13] vessel that's why he's not doing it to
[57:16] everybody so that's why you have to have
[57:18] the teachers that come into the church
[57:19] in order to teach the word in order to
[57:21] show you this is what God means
[57:23] otherwise you wouldn't get it right so
[57:25] he's a divine interpreter of the Divine
[57:27] word that's exactly the word of the Lord
[57:29] come to the prophets that's who it come
[57:31] to not the theologians people trying to
[57:34] you know people and and you can actually
[57:36] think of people that try if if you want
[57:38] to say that you're staying at home and
[57:40] listening to tapes and reading the Bible
[57:42] you're really just a theologian because
[57:43] what you're trying to what you're trying
[57:44] to say is you're trying to you're trying
[57:46] to understand this thing by yourself
[57:47] through your own wisdom and knowledge
[57:49] but God doesn't come to theologians and
[57:52] theologies right God has the order of
[57:53] how the word is to be received right
[57:56] that's who it come to not the Theologian
[57:58] it's the prophet right do you know what
[57:59] a prophet means take the dictionary look
[58:01] what look and see what it means and
[58:03] interpreter of the Divine word right so
[58:06] we don't just we don't just appreciate
[58:07] brother Brandon for his you know for the
[58:09] healing Ministries and the the the gifts
[58:12] of healing all that is great and the
[58:14] visions and stuff we love him because
[58:16] what he taught us he taught us what
[58:18] pleases God right he taught us how to
[58:22] please God what God expects uh uh out uh
[58:25] out of of us right uh and just as um
[58:29] just as Esther was uh prepared um just
[58:33] as Esther was prepared and taught uh to
[58:36] please the king it came to a spot that
[58:39] when she wanted to ask something from
[58:41] The King The King said he would have
[58:43] give her half the Kingdom right so
[58:45] because she was taught right to present
[58:47] herself before the uh King she was
[58:49] taught to please God right so those are
[58:52] the ministerial gifts of the body and
[58:55] we're going to kind of we we'll end this
[58:57] series with uh going to First
[58:59] Corinthians and kind of tying all these
[59:02] things together
[59:06] um and we'll kind of start with verse um
[59:10] let's
[59:15] see we'll start with kind of verse 12
[59:17] and kind of read through just to kind of
[59:20] end up this series says for as the body
[59:23] is one and have many members and all the
[59:26] members of that one body being many are
[59:28] one body so also is Christ for by one
[59:32] Spirit we are we all baptized into one
[59:34] body whether we be jew or Gentiles
[59:36] whether we Bond or free and have been
[59:38] all made to drink into the spirit for
[59:40] the body is not one member but many
[59:43] we're all working together every one of
[59:45] us has a job every one of us has a gift
[59:47] to all work together uh uh to make this
[59:49] thing work Paul says if the foot shall
[59:52] say because I am not the hand I am not
[59:55] of the body is it it is it therefore not
[59:57] of the body and if the ear shall say
[59:59] because I am not of the eye I not of the
[1:00:01] body is it therefore not of the body if
[1:00:03] the whole body were an eye where were
[1:00:05] the hearing if the whole body were
[1:00:07] hearing where were the smelling but now
[1:00:10] God have set the members everyone in the
[1:00:12] body as he have pleased them so that
[1:00:14] means that every one of us is unique not
[1:00:17] no no one can take somebody else's place
[1:00:20] and this this and when I really
[1:00:22] understood this when I really kind of uh
[1:00:24] uh kind of meditated about this thing
[1:00:26] it's that's why it's important to pray
[1:00:28] for backsliders right a backslider is
[1:00:31] someone that's still a part of the body
[1:00:33] they're just out of position which means
[1:00:35] you're not a complete Church you are not
[1:00:38] a complete Church without that person so
[1:00:41] that means that they have you may have a
[1:00:43] need and only they can be the person to
[1:00:46] address it right God ordains these gifts
[1:00:50] God ordains these people before the
[1:00:51] foundation of the world to be in these
[1:00:53] gifted positions right to be able to
[1:00:56] understand certain things or uh you know
[1:00:58] Gifts of Faith Gifts of healing and all
[1:01:00] those things but if the if if our gift
[1:01:03] of faith is backsliding well how do we
[1:01:06] uh take advantage of our gift of faith
[1:01:09] you know if someone in a church is
[1:01:10] backsliding they have a gift of healing
[1:01:12] how do we take uh uh advantage of that
[1:01:14] gift of healing if they are not here
[1:01:17] right uh and the thing I like about the
[1:01:18] body is it's not something that's
[1:01:20] replaceable right when we're talking
[1:01:22] about restoration these things we can't
[1:01:24] just say okay well so and so left the
[1:01:25] church we just replace them no no no no
[1:01:27] we need that person so that's why the
[1:01:30] and that's why Christ has said when one
[1:01:32] person suffers we all suffer right so
[1:01:35] whether you realize it or not you
[1:01:36] suffering because everyone is dealing
[1:01:38] with stuff every single day we all
[1:01:40] dealing with battles we all dealing with
[1:01:42] stuff and the the uh the the the thing
[1:01:45] that we don't want to get stuck in our
[1:01:47] head is we don't have to fight these
[1:01:48] battles alone God has placed gifts in
[1:01:51] the church to help us out you don't got
[1:01:53] to struggle by yourself that's what the
[1:01:56] world does you see all the people
[1:01:57] dealing with mental heal health issues
[1:01:59] and anxiety and all that kind of stuff
[1:02:02] if you have a god a holy ghost filled
[1:02:05] Church you wouldn't be dealing with
[1:02:06] those things gifts are in the church to
[1:02:08] kind of help you overcome your mental
[1:02:10] problems and your anxiety and your
[1:02:11] stress you can't find a job or uh
[1:02:14] healing or you need uh you need Faith to
[1:02:17] overcome some kind of Victory God has
[1:02:19] placed all these uh gifts in the church
[1:02:21] so that we could all lean upon each
[1:02:24] other exactly right amen so we'll go
[1:02:26] ahead and uh end this uh in this in a
[1:02:29] word of
[1:02:30] prayer Lord Jesus Christ Lord your word
[1:02:33] is gone forth oh Lord God lord we know

[1:04:56] [Applause]
[1:05:07] Lord
[1:05:10] bless amen thank God for the
[1:05:14] word uh tonight appreciate our brother
[1:05:17] Quinton and um just the way the Lord has
[1:05:20] gifted him to present to us the word of
[1:05:24] God um
[1:05:26] I've been a part of the message for a
[1:05:29] number of years and um uh I want to say
[1:05:33] this the second time I think I've heard
[1:05:35] someone actually focused on that word
[1:05:40] helps in the uh book of Corinthians and
[1:05:43] and and people understanding that um God
[1:05:47] actually send helps to uh the church and
[1:05:52] and helps he he just went into so many
[1:05:55] many different areas like you know with
[1:05:57] the sound uh equipment with the um
[1:06:02] projection of the
[1:06:03] words um I I think about anytime there's
[1:06:07] a funeral and sisters getting together
[1:06:09] and uh uh uh getting the food and
[1:06:12] everything together whether if it's a
[1:06:14] fellowship you know uh and the way that
[1:06:17] that's coordinated all all that is it's
[1:06:20] it's it helps um when we just did the um
[1:06:24] the um the message believer choir there
[1:06:26] were things happening behind the scenes
[1:06:28] that a lot of people didn't even know
[1:06:29] was going on but it was the helps that
[1:06:32] was taking care of all of that and
[1:06:34] people that were gifted to be able to do
[1:06:36] those things it just makes um it makes
[1:06:39] the burden a little bit lighter but I
[1:06:41] tell you I um I I appreciate I
[1:06:44] appreciate uh the journey that the Lord
[1:06:46] has taken us through and and and and
[1:06:48] just wonderful one other thoughts he
[1:06:50] brought about the prophets um especially
[1:06:54] when it comes to 5old Ministry brother
[1:06:56] Brandon made it very very clear and I
[1:06:58] love the quote that he used uh a prophet
[1:07:01] is a is a modern-day preacher so um if a
[1:07:06] person is going to claim that they're
[1:07:08] part of fivefold minist as a prophet and
[1:07:11] and I I got to make it very clear that
[1:07:14] there are people that claim that
[1:07:18] position not that God actually put them
[1:07:21] in that position but they claim it and
[1:07:24] the reason that people claim it is
[1:07:25] because they feel that um if you're part
[1:07:28] of the fivefold ministry then you're
[1:07:31] kind of at this elevated level but in
[1:07:34] God's mind we all we all just doing what
[1:07:38] we supposed to do you know we're all a
[1:07:39] part of the same body and we're just
[1:07:41] doing what we're supposed to be doing
[1:07:43] right so uh but but when people claim
[1:07:46] that and and they they realize they
[1:07:49] cannot take the same position as brother
[1:07:51] Brandon cuz they know soon as you say
[1:07:53] something like that we done cut you off
[1:07:55] just like that ain't no way what you
[1:07:57] talking about you ain't got no Dove
[1:08:00] showing up at your your house when you
[1:08:02] born and you know no you ain't got come
[1:08:04] on no Vindication like that so so they
[1:08:08] won't say that they're on that level
[1:08:10] they won't claim to be like Moses or
[1:08:12] brother brandom or Jeremiah Isaiah but
[1:08:15] uh but they will claim that I'm a part
[1:08:17] of the fivefold ministry but you don't
[1:08:19] preach You Don't Preach so or or if you
[1:08:23] do try to preach and and actually before
[1:08:26] before a person even preach all you got
[1:08:28] to do is sit down and have a two to
[1:08:29] three minute conversation with them
[1:08:31] about the word and you can tell whether
[1:08:34] they got a anointing on them to preach
[1:08:36] or not preach amen you how they tie the
[1:08:39] word together tells you whether this is
[1:08:41] really a true anointing or not amen
[1:08:44] church so when you're trying to help
[1:08:46] people see their position uh maybe it's
[1:08:49] not five-fold Ministry profit however
[1:08:53] when we look at the gifts of the Spirit
[1:08:55] the nine spiritual gifts one of those
[1:08:57] nine spiritual gifts is the gift of
[1:08:59] Prophecy another thing that was said
[1:09:01] here tonight if you got some gift in
[1:09:04] your life and you cannot subject
[1:09:08] yourself to the leadership of a pastor
[1:09:11] something's wrong with your
[1:09:15] gift amen church if you if you if you
[1:09:19] got if you got I mean just beautiful I
[1:09:21] just never even heard it put that way
[1:09:22] even when you think about a pastor and
[1:09:24] just the way God
[1:09:25] um makes that person up in the way that
[1:09:27] he has to be able to handle certain
[1:09:29] things um you know in the church but not
[1:09:32] just the preaching but it's the things
[1:09:34] outside of the preaching you know he got
[1:09:36] to be able to handle it and uh but God
[1:09:39] has to give that anointing you know to
[1:09:41] the pastor to be able to do that and you
[1:09:43] know he was just saying how even that's
[1:09:44] the only Ministry of the fivefold
[1:09:46] ministry has got qualifications around
[1:09:48] it when you look at in the scripture uh
[1:09:50] so it's really it's really it's really
[1:09:52] really special I I'm I'mma get to this
[1:09:55] um announcements but he just said so
[1:09:57] much that just kind of got me going um I
[1:10:00] don't think I ever shared with y'all
[1:10:02] this testimony some of y'all may know it
[1:10:03] but most most ever most don't know it
[1:10:07] but before we started this church um I
[1:10:10] remember being invited to my uh cousin's
[1:10:14] Church uh a he's a retired Methodist uh
[1:10:19] Minister and he invited me to come to
[1:10:22] his church and and Minister and and um
[1:10:25] and I remember
[1:10:26] going and I think I ministered on you
[1:10:30] must be born again and when I got there
[1:10:32] to the church he had told me as soon as
[1:10:34] I I walked through the door he says well
[1:10:36] I didn't tell you this before you came
[1:10:38] but uh you got 30 minutes to deliver
[1:10:40] your sermon CU if you can't delivered in
[1:10:42] 30 minutes then um you ain't saying
[1:10:46] nothing that's what they told me you
[1:10:48] ain't saying nothing so I got up there
[1:10:50] and I did 30 minutes so uh with that
[1:10:53] training I give that to the brothers my
[1:10:55] training I give to the brothers I put
[1:10:57] them on a time limit amen
[1:11:01] brothers so uh I told watch it watch it
[1:11:04] watch it watch your your time because
[1:11:05] you got to know how to do that and uh so
[1:11:08] I went and I preached and after the
[1:11:12] service I was I went
[1:11:14] home um and I'm trying to think whether
[1:11:17] because he invited me back a sec
[1:11:19] actually his church invited me back the
[1:11:21] second time I didn't uh the first time I
[1:11:23] went and then I thought it was all done
[1:11:26] and he called me up and said my church
[1:11:27] want you to come back you I said your
[1:11:29] church want me to come back he said yeah
[1:11:31] yeah they asked you to come back on
[1:11:32] Mother's Day and I preached give it keep
[1:11:35] it keep it lose it and uh and when I
[1:11:38] when I came back um man I was just
[1:11:41] feeling just this weight on my shoulders
[1:11:45] and I and it was feeling like I maybe
[1:11:47] said something wrong uh and I couldn't
[1:11:50] figure out what it was that I said wrong
[1:11:52] and so I called him up and I said you
[1:11:55] you know I don't know if I said
[1:11:56] something wrong in your pull pit or not
[1:11:57] but I'm just I'm not feeling well I just
[1:12:00] got this weight on my shoulders and I
[1:12:03] think I just need to make something
[1:12:04] right and he said oh you're just a young
[1:12:06] preacher you ain't said nothing wrong
[1:12:08] you know you said exactly what the Lord
[1:12:10] wanted you to say you a you don't have
[1:12:12] to apologize to nothing I said well if I
[1:12:14] ain't say nothing wrong then I don't
[1:12:16] know what this weight is and as I just
[1:12:18] begin to pray and um you know process
[1:12:21] what this weight I mean I could feel it
[1:12:23] was literal weight on my shoulders I
[1:12:25] just I I could not understand and this
[1:12:28] was before the ministry started and what
[1:12:30] God showed me that weight that I was
[1:12:33] carrying was the weight of the people so
[1:12:37] before um this church even started God
[1:12:41] put the weight on my shoulder to be able
[1:12:43] to carry the weight of the people praise
[1:12:47] the Lord everybody don't have those
[1:12:49] experiences right everybody don't have

[1:18:12] today I've I've seen her a few times met
[1:18:15] her U our paths cross because I know her
[1:18:18] parents and um she came in the office
[1:18:21] maybe few months ago around the
[1:18:23] summertime and I and I spoke to her
[1:18:25] because I recognized her but I didn't
[1:18:28] say a lot cuz I was working so today she
[1:18:31] came in the office again she had come to
[1:18:34] a job fair that was at the Airport
[1:18:36] Hilton and she came into our records
[1:18:39] area because there was
[1:18:41] a um kind of a black ball restriction on
[1:18:46] her hiring being able to get back into
[1:18:48] the county and so she came to see if
[1:18:51] that had been lifted so in the process
[1:18:54] one of the guys was you know checking
[1:18:56] the records to see if it was lifted so
[1:18:58] when he came back he said you know yeah
[1:19:01] it's lifted so she just went out into a
[1:19:03] hallelujah praise right there in the
[1:19:06] office and um so as she as she finished
[1:19:10] I said you know you you she said I I I
[1:19:14] just been praying she said I've been
[1:19:15] crying out to the Lord I was just
[1:19:17] praying that this would be lifted I'm
[1:19:18] just so happy I said God had already
[1:19:21] answered your prayer when you were
[1:19:23] praying because that had been lifted
[1:19:25] from the last time she came in the
[1:19:27] office it had already been lifted but
[1:19:29] she didn't know it and so I said it
[1:19:32] already been lifted so she and I just
[1:19:33] started talking and she was sharing some
[1:19:36] personal things that she was going
[1:19:37] through and I really was able to make a
[1:19:39] real um spiritual connection with her
[1:19:42] and she said where where where do you go
[1:19:44] to church I need you to pray for me pray
[1:19:46] for me and I said I will and so I'm at
[1:19:49] work at the front office and the front
[1:19:50] desk so and I said I would and so she
[1:19:53] said well where did you go to church
[1:19:54] church and I told her and she said well
[1:19:56] what time is um Sunday school and and
[1:19:59] and you have prayer Mee and different
[1:20:01] services so I told her yes so she has a
[1:20:04] 17year old son and um she's planning to
[1:20:07] be in service on Sunday and I just
[1:20:10] really believe that God is leading her
[1:20:12] to this ministry I think it's more than
[1:20:14] just her praying for that job to be
[1:20:17] lifted I really believe God is dealing
[1:20:20] with her and bringing her to this
[1:20:22] ministry all right praise the Lord amen

[1:21:05] telling me how her husband killed her
[1:21:09] six six years old boy and then he also
[1:21:12] killed him himself and then she was
[1:21:15] crying and then she was like she was

[1:21:21] months ago and then I told her that I
[1:21:23] was going to pray for her
[1:21:25] and then I feel a desire that I need to
[1:21:27] call her but I don't want that to like
[1:21:30] give me a problem with my job because
[1:21:31] I'm not supposed to take number and then
[1:21:34] call people but I feel like a burden
[1:21:36] that I need like to call her and then
[1:21:38] pray she said like sometimes I just call
[1:21:40] friends to pray with me because I I just
[1:21:42] can't believe what my husband did and
[1:21:45] then it's so hard for her because she
[1:21:47] had to change her name she don't want to
[1:21:49] like carry like like her husband name so

[1:22:14] um the pressure that people going
[1:22:16] through and they don't know where to go
[1:22:18] to to let off the pressure um but that's
[1:22:21] that's that's rough um for a mother to
[1:22:24] have to deal with that let's uh let's
[1:22:27] let's let's let's pray for these uh
[1:22:29] different
[1:22:30] requests father we
[1:22:32] are grateful that we can come to you we
[1:22:37] um sometimes we hear these uh different
[1:22:40] needs that and people from all walks of
[1:22:42] life and that they go through and Lord
[1:22:46] they just that they don't know where to
[1:22:48] turn but uh if they could only turn to
[1:22:51] you Jesus they would find the peace and
[1:22:53] the hope and um the satisfaction that
[1:22:56] they need at all lives in in
[1:22:58] Christ um and we we know that you have
[1:23:02] us in certain places at certain times in
[1:23:05] order to be able to hear um these uh uh
[1:23:10] these needs and then we can do something
[1:23:13] about it as as Kings and Priests we can
[1:23:16] stand uh in the Gap Lord we just pray
[1:23:20] that uh you would just intervene somehow
[1:23:23] and bring confidence strength Lord
[1:23:25] there's a family that has uh lost a
[1:23:28] loved one there in Sister Virginia's
[1:23:30] family and and the family didn't even
[1:23:32] know that he was
[1:23:34] gone uh hidden but now revealed and so
[1:23:38] many are dealing with the the the Lord
[1:23:41] just everything that goes along with
[1:23:42] this dealing with this grief and not
[1:23:44] even having closure and and all of that
[1:23:46] but we just pray that you give them
[1:23:48] peace that you would um Lord just
[1:23:50] minister to their needs uh even uh
[1:23:53] during this great time and father I pray
[1:23:55] that the spirit of forgiveness would
[1:23:57] come uh into that family and that God
[1:24:00] they would just somehow be able to just
[1:24:02] sort through uh all that occurred and
[1:24:05] also want to remember this young lady
