[39:04] forth amen just getting our hearts
[39:07] prepared for the word of the Lord man on
[39:10] today and I know we have a few
[39:12] announcements that I'd like to uh give
[39:15] but um I was just encouraged by
[39:18] something this week and you know we all
[39:20] are very aware of the uh the things that
[39:25] are happening there in in Israel and our
[39:28] hearts certainly um are for uh the
[39:33] people and all that they're going
[39:34] through and uh but there was a gentleman
[39:38] that um be begin to just rehearse all
[39:42] the things that have been happening um
[39:45] you know the the he made a statement he
[39:49] says you know uh typically there Israel
[39:53] has the Iron Dome that when people fire
[39:55] Rockets
[39:57] uh they can block a lot of stuff with
[39:59] this Iron Dome and they said that uh you
[40:02] know with this um Iron Dome you know we
[40:05] did block some but others did get
[40:08] through and it says you know the way
[40:10] that they got through we are convinced
[40:13] that this was not just Hamas doing what
[40:17] Hamas was doing and uh he says they have
[40:20] they got help from somewhere else and it
[40:23] says and you know there is only um two
[40:27] superpowers that have the ability to
[40:30] disrupt our Iron Dome and one of them is
[40:33] the USA and we just don't believe that
[40:36] the US has anything to do with this uh
[40:40] especially US citizens being in there it
[40:42] says but Russia also has the ability to
[40:46] uh to do some things to kind of mess up
[40:48] our Iron Dome so we have a feeling that
[40:51] Russia might be behind amen helping
[40:54] Hamas and um the you know the um um he
[40:58] you as he exit you know he just began to
[41:01] just kind of walk through that and at
[41:02] the end of it he said but I'm Not Afraid
[41:05] amen he says we're we're we're not in
[41:07] fear in Israel and he dropped this
[41:10] scripture you know on the people and
[41:12] then just dropped the mic uh Psalm
[41:16] 121 amen and uh he just dropped just one
[41:20] verse but I'mma drop the whole chapter
[41:21] on y'all is that's all Psalm 121 says I
[41:25] will lift up my
[41:27] eyes unto the heels from whence cometh
[41:31] my
[41:33] help I'm talking about me I don't know
[41:35] about you but but my
[41:39] Help Cometh From The
[41:42] Lord which made Heaven and
[41:46] Earth he will not suffer thy foot to be
[41:50] moved they not leaving
[41:52] Israel he will not suffer thy foot to be
[41:55] moved
[41:57] he that keepeth thee will not Slumber
[42:00] and this is the verse he left with them
[42:02] behold he that
[42:04] keepeth he made that thing
[42:08] personal he made that thing personal not
[42:10] he that keepeth the US or he that
[42:12] keepeth some other Nation it say our
[42:14] nation in the Bible he that keepeth
[42:20] Israel shall neither
[42:23] Slumber s nor sleep amen
[42:26] The Lord Is Thy keeper The Lord Is Thy
[42:30] shade upon thy right hand the son shall
[42:33] not smite thee by day nor the Moon by
[42:36] Night the Lord shall preserve thee from
[42:39] all evil he shall preserve thy Soul the
[42:43] Lord shall preserve thy going

[43:07] and I just love the way he he he walked
[43:09] him right through it and then just

[43:12] mics I said that's that's just a perfect
[43:14] scripture I and if I had been in the
[43:18] session all
[43:20] right and that man had done something

[1:02:45] that the Lord will touch this this body
[1:02:49] of mine uh I've been uh giving the devil
[1:02:52] back the package that he's been trying
[1:02:54] to give me uh all
[1:02:58] week um but by his grace uh we heal this
[1:03:05] morning uh let's start at the 25th verse
[1:03:09] of Luke chapter
[1:03:11] 25 and it and it reads and there shall
[1:03:14] be signs in the the Sun and in the moon
[1:03:17] and in the stars and upon the Earth
[1:03:19] distress of nations with
[1:03:23] perplexity the Sea and the ways Ru men's
[1:03:27] Hearts fell in them for fear and and for
[1:03:31] looking after those things which are
[1:03:34] coming on the earth for the powers of
[1:03:36] Heaven shall be shaken and then shall
[1:03:41] they see the son of man coming in a
[1:03:44] cloud with power and great glory and
[1:03:47] when these things begin to come to pass
[1:03:49] then look up and lift up your heads for
[1:03:53] your Redemption draw if not let's bow
[1:03:56] our heads gracious father we just thank
[1:03:59] you Lord once again for allowing us this
[1:04:02] opportunity to be here this morning and
[1:04:05] uh we just trust that we could share
[1:04:07] something that will uh encourage the
[1:04:09] Believers oh God this morning help us to
[1:04:13] get ourself out of the way give me
[1:04:15] strength in in my physical body just
[1:04:17] kind of been going through the last
[1:04:19] couple of weeks but uh we claim the
[1:04:23] victory am amen this morning uh open up
[1:04:26] our hearts and our minds to receive the
[1:04:29] word of God uh we ask these and other
[1:04:32] prayers and blessings in Jesus Christ's
[1:04:34] wonderful name amen amen you may be
[1:04:36] seated um this morning I just like to
[1:04:39] use uh I guess our topic from the last
[1:04:43] time we preached uh scriptural absolute
[1:04:46] amen and uh as a subtopic of the S poost
[1:04:52] of the second Advent
[1:04:54] of the Lord Jesus and uh the last time
[1:04:58] we had the opportunity to minister
[1:05:00] brother Jack was out out of town and
[1:05:02] like we say we always appreciate brother
[1:05:05] Jack and his confidence in us um you
[1:05:09] know you don't want to take uh these
[1:05:11] opportunities likly it it takes a lot
[1:05:14] for a man to allow you to to get behind
[1:05:18] his platform you know because you want
[1:05:20] to be able to trust the things that's
[1:05:22] being said will be be edifying not
[1:05:25] something that'll you know be
[1:05:28] distracting or leave questions in the
[1:05:30] hearts of of the people and and just do
[1:05:34] much damage so we I appreciate that like
[1:05:37] I say I pastored for a while and and if
[1:05:40] I didn't really trust you I would not
[1:05:43] let you preach it's just as simple as
[1:05:46] that we could be
[1:05:48] friends but I realize you you could say
[1:05:51] something that could make a mess and
[1:05:54] make it difficult or you could say
[1:05:57] something to unskilled people and people
[1:06:00] don't don't have the spiritual Insight
[1:06:03] that you have and do damage you I've
[1:06:06] I've you know I've watched folk you know
[1:06:09] I've been a Christian since 1988 and
[1:06:11] I've seen a lot and you you watched
[1:06:13] statements and you watched things that
[1:06:16] were not scriptural affect
[1:06:19] people right and uh so we appreciate the
[1:06:24] opportunity uh we we were talking about
[1:06:26] a scriptural absolute and just in my
[1:06:30] mind and just the way that I'm built in
[1:06:32] the way I look at things maybe a little
[1:06:35] bit of difference we got quite a few
[1:06:36] ministers in the house this morning but
[1:06:39] uh just in the way that I approach
[1:06:42] things and look at things from my years
[1:06:44] of experience we we want to you know try
[1:06:47] to make sure most of all that people are
[1:06:50] solid and
[1:06:51] anchored uh and I believe in
[1:06:55] praise but but one thing I realize if
[1:06:58] that's all this is all about uh you're
[1:07:00] not going to be able to be an
[1:07:03] overcomer and we realize according to
[1:07:06] the scriptures in the Book of Revelation
[1:07:08] every age is supposed to produce
[1:07:12] Overcomers right and and just in
[1:07:14] emotions emotions don't help you to
[1:07:17] overcome right you can shout all day and
[1:07:20] night but uh when you finish shouting if
[1:07:23] you ain't getting no word on you know
[1:07:25] like it used to be in the old days you
[1:07:27] run across people child we had just
[1:07:30] today you know boy we shouted the place
[1:07:33] that what the preacher preach the
[1:07:35] preacher did preach the Holy Ghost came
[1:07:38] in and just took over the service and he
[1:07:42] like we can't let that happen too many
[1:07:45] times you know maybe sometimes may that
[1:07:48] might happen but we got to feed upon the
[1:07:51] word but you know we we're living Liv in
[1:07:54] an hour where where we we must have I I
[1:07:58] I believe it's imperative that we have h
[1:08:01] a a Amen to what we believe an amen to
[1:08:05] what we're standing standing on and
[1:08:08] standing for is that right you you don't
[1:08:12] want to be uh shifting we going
[1:08:15] somewhere this morning y'all just y'all
[1:08:17] just pray for me I'm gonna get out the
[1:08:18] way in a minute I'm looking for the
[1:08:20] preacher to preach this morning but but
[1:08:23] we we got to have an an amen something
[1:08:27] that speaks of finality yeah
[1:08:31] right religion won't do it because
[1:08:35] religion is just a covering yeah you you
[1:08:38] cuz you can go to church out of
[1:08:40] traditions and not even be
[1:08:43] converted not even know where you stand
[1:08:45] at in the
[1:08:47] word right amen just do it from a
[1:08:51] customary uh perspective and and just
[1:08:54] really don't don't understand the book
[1:08:57] of redemption why we got a Bible and why
[1:09:00] the Bible was ever written right and and
[1:09:03] why we hold to the things that we hold
[1:09:05] to yeah right so this is what I believe
[1:09:08] I believe the preaching of the Gospel
[1:09:10] comes to give us an anchor in the
[1:09:14] soul to to settle us something that's
[1:09:18] that's an amen to us when when our world
[1:09:21] is turned upside down
[1:09:24] we we we can sleep on the
[1:09:30] boat when when when the wind when the
[1:09:33] winds and the waves when there's a
[1:09:35] hurricane going on we could just rest we
[1:09:38] can
[1:09:41] sleep right you know a lot of times when
[1:09:44] when the winds in the way especially
[1:09:45] hurricane season it's about over with
[1:09:48] thank God you know uh uh people people
[1:09:52] panic the first s of something out there
[1:09:55] I'm always seem like the last person to
[1:09:58] know huran
[1:10:00] what l i done wait it too long you go to
[1:10:02] Home Depot to try to buy some boys for
[1:10:05] you when like they done bought up
[1:10:06] everything all the water all the food
[1:10:08] all the something right but but but it
[1:10:12] says something that when when when
[1:10:14] things is happening you know you can
[1:10:17] sleep you you you you at a place of rest
[1:10:21] you know you know uh Jesus the disciple
[1:10:24] was going on in the hurricane and they
[1:10:27] had a commission to go to the other
[1:10:30] side right and and and if if they had an
[1:10:34] absolute if they had a clear perspective
[1:10:37] of their
[1:10:38] position come on the brother was just
[1:10:40] preaching on that other night they're
[1:10:42] placing the scriptures and understand
[1:10:45] what discipleship was all about those
[1:10:48] things never would have moved them but
[1:10:51] but but being face to face with those
[1:10:53] things they was pushing the panic
[1:10:56] button is that right they ran down and
[1:11:00] and Peter was you know
[1:11:02] distraught uh Master don't you care that
[1:11:05] we perish
[1:11:07] yes it's like you down here sleep on and
[1:11:12] and our whole world is being turned
[1:11:14] upside down come on right Jesus was at
[1:11:19] rest right because Jesus didn't have the
[1:11:22] same kind of concern that they had
[1:11:26] because Jesus was the
[1:11:29] absolute he he real you know even even
[1:11:32] when when he spoke and things of that
[1:11:34] nature they was like what kind of man is
[1:11:37] this right that even the winds and the
[1:11:40] waves and the Sea obey him they still
[1:11:44] could not comprehend right until after
[1:11:48] they went up to uh uh Calvary not
[1:11:51] Calvary y'all but to to the upper room
[1:11:54] and got and got a a a
[1:11:57] birth and and really locked in into that
[1:12:01] position that changed things for him is
[1:12:04] that right and and that's why that's why
[1:12:06] the new birth is important a handshake
[1:12:10] won't do it if that's all you got is a
[1:12:13] handshake you won't get in the
[1:12:16] glory you will not get in the glory with
[1:12:19] just a
[1:12:21] handshake right glory to God you know I
[1:12:25] I kind of came came up in church H me
[1:12:28] and an we go way back we we used to go
[1:12:30] to the same church when we was young and
[1:12:33] I remember those days that you know they
[1:12:35] used to open up and I think a lot of
[1:12:37] churches still do open up the doors of
[1:12:39] the church and people would come up and
[1:12:41] they would put the chairs out and you
[1:12:44] would come up and and sit and the pastor
[1:12:46] would come and then the whole church
[1:12:48] would come around and shake your hand
[1:12:51] and and and everything and they would
[1:12:52] assign you to a a deacon and and you
[1:12:56] know what all they did was induct you
[1:12:58] into just some other kind of Lodge or
[1:13:00] system or something of that nature but
[1:13:03] that that's never been the
[1:13:06] requirement right amen that that's never
[1:13:10] been the requirement the requirement has
[1:13:13] always been amen you must be born
[1:13:16] again see Jesus let let us know uh what
[1:13:21] the requirement was
[1:13:24] uh uh for the church and that's that's
[1:13:28] the change to be be born again to allow
[1:13:32] New Life to come into you is that right
[1:13:36] not not a handshake and not you know
[1:13:38] because there's there's nothing really
[1:13:40] in really
[1:13:43] right but you need something to take
[1:13:46] place in
[1:13:47] here right I I mean you know that that's
[1:13:51] good that people come forward and and
[1:13:54] and try to make a a confession but then
[1:13:57] you know when when when uh the day of
[1:14:00] Pentecost had fully come and Peter
[1:14:03] preached a sermon and and it it see and
[1:14:06] it still takes the word to prick your
[1:14:10] heart is that right to do to do the work
[1:14:13] in the heart if that's going to be any
[1:14:15] change it's got to take place by the
[1:14:18] word see see in the hour that we living
[1:14:21] in we we people do a lot of things to
[1:14:23] try to
[1:14:24] Captivate you know uh and there's
[1:14:27] nothing wrong with some of the things
[1:14:28] that we do I guess uh uh but you know
[1:14:33] people try to do all sorts of things
[1:14:35] hoping to get the Young Generation in
[1:14:38] well you know that's never been
[1:14:41] scriptural that's exactly right we we do
[1:14:44] things after they get a conversion just
[1:14:47] to kind of keep them in good Christian
[1:14:50] company and things of that nature but
[1:14:53] but but to to to have all of these
[1:14:56] different things in in hopes that we
[1:14:59] would we would get a a a
[1:15:03] generation right um this unscriptural
[1:15:07] all right see we got it we got to get
[1:15:10] back to biblical
[1:15:13] principles yes sir right because outside
[1:15:16] of biblical principles people might come
[1:15:19] up but they won't have anything to uh
[1:15:22] anchor to them and stabilize them is
[1:15:25] that right and so like we were saying we
[1:15:28] got to be stable because then when the
[1:15:31] winds come we could have
[1:15:34] rest right we we could sleep when when
[1:15:37] we don't have answers to
[1:15:40] questions we can still
[1:15:43] sleep when we when we don't know why our
[1:15:46] world is being turned upside down we we
[1:15:49] could still you know have a a a a peace
[1:15:54] in our
[1:15:55] hearts amen yes sir because just as show
[1:15:58] as you're a Christian this morning you
[1:16:00] going to have some
[1:16:02] unrest amen because the guns of the
[1:16:05] devil amen is aimed after you everything
[1:16:08] that the devil got he's shooting at you
[1:16:11] is that right 36 years he's been
[1:16:13] shooting at me right and and and the
[1:16:16] only hope and the only rest that I got
[1:16:19] is in Christ y'all keep praying for me
[1:16:22] I'm I'm go somewhere this morning see so
[1:16:26] so this is why we we got to have an
[1:16:29] absolute which is something that speaks
[1:16:32] of an amen an assurity something that's
[1:16:36] that's real something that's our anchor
[1:16:39] as an
[1:16:41] individual can't be a family
[1:16:43] thing God ain't got no grandchildren all
[1:16:46] right I got my first grandbaby but you
[1:16:49] know he won't be able to go in all right
[1:16:52] notless he a baby you know because the
[1:16:55] token is applied right right right but
[1:16:58] if he get to an age accountability he
[1:17:00] own his own see like the young people
[1:17:03] this morning you know you on your
[1:17:06] own they might have the token applied
[1:17:09] but you got to make your own personal
[1:17:13] confession and have your own personal
[1:17:16] possession Oh Glory to God well well my
[1:17:19] daddy's this and my daddy that well I
[1:17:21] was the pastor of the church
[1:17:25] but but but what does that
[1:17:27] mean what does that mean to
[1:17:30] you where what's your absolute right
[1:17:34] brother Jack got
[1:17:35] children right and but they got their
[1:17:38] own personal absolute thank God for my
[1:17:42] nieces right amen I got I got children
[1:17:45] amen and and and you know they got to
[1:17:48] have that their
[1:17:50] absolute right they got to have the amen
[1:17:53] manner on the inside of
[1:17:55] them glory to God hallelujah all of our
[1:17:59] children you know we only thing that we
[1:18:02] could do we we could bring them up in
[1:18:04] the way that they should
[1:18:06] go right that that if they
[1:18:09] depart see we still in the
[1:18:12] Bible right see well well they doing
[1:18:15] this you know and I I remember when my
[1:18:17] children were young and and everything
[1:18:20] and and I didn't know what they would do
[1:18:22] and and what what they would be and what
[1:18:24] they would become and things of that
[1:18:27] nature you know uh you can only hold on
[1:18:31] to the fact of what the Bible has
[1:18:34] said and so so now you know they they
[1:18:38] they got their own minds and their own
[1:18:40] makeups and their own characteristics
[1:18:42] and they doing their own things but you
[1:18:45] know I've gotten to a place that those
[1:18:46] things don't even bother me all right
[1:18:49] all right right it it don't it it can't
[1:18:52] only only thing that I can trust in I
[1:18:55] could trust in the promised
[1:18:58] word right glory to God and that that's
[1:19:01] it no no matter what it looks like today
[1:19:05] it don't even matter glory to God no
[1:19:08] matter what your situation look like
[1:19:10] this morning you know if if it's not
[1:19:13] what you think it ought to be it it
[1:19:16] shouldn't matter to you as long as you
[1:19:19] got a promise in his word hallelujah
[1:19:23] that's the thing that amen you hold on
[1:19:25] to glory to God that's that's the thing
[1:19:29] that's that's your amen amen so so this
[1:19:32] is this is where we at this morning uh I
[1:19:35] I want to kind of shift gears into kind
[1:19:38] of what we we we want to preach a little
[1:19:41] bit on that's just our our title uh for
[1:19:45] the next hundred
[1:19:48] sermons all right it's scriptural
[1:19:51] absolute because because because I
[1:19:53] believe the ministry is is trying to
[1:19:55] stay
[1:19:57] scriptural and prove What We Believe by
[1:20:00] the
[1:20:03] scripture not not emotions not our
[1:20:06] opinions but but what what God has
[1:20:09] already already
[1:20:11] said is that right glory to glory to God
[1:20:16] y'all bear with me for a
[1:20:19] second now uh if we could pull up our
[1:20:23] our first quote this morning from faith
[1:20:25] is De substance
[1:20:26] 1947 uh to just kind of we we got to get
[1:20:30] in an understanding of of the climate of
[1:20:33] the day yeah right we we know there a
[1:20:36] lot of lot going on and and and brother
[1:20:39] Jack was just talking about isra and I I
[1:20:41] I've kind of been hearing bits and
[1:20:43] pieces I haven't taken the time to
[1:20:46] really you know look at it because I
[1:20:48] already have my my understanding about
[1:20:51] it so
[1:20:53] uh uh I don't spend a lot of time uh
[1:20:57] kind of getting into the well they doing
[1:20:59] this and doing that well one one thing
[1:21:02] scripturally we know that amen they
[1:21:05] can't destroy all of
[1:21:08] Israel right because because of the
[1:21:11] Bible they they got to receive their two
[1:21:16] witnesses right they got that that's
[1:21:19] that's that's got and it's got to be if
[1:21:22] that's the case has got to be somebody
[1:21:25] there is that right when those two
[1:21:28] witnesses appear that'll receive their
[1:21:31] day in its
[1:21:33] message is that right so so I'm I'm not
[1:21:36] really and and and you know in the book
[1:21:38] of uh uh Romans if you go back to Romans
[1:21:42] 11 you know uh they were they even back
[1:21:46] then they were wondering about you know
[1:21:49] Israel and Paul let them know says
[1:21:52] listen
[1:21:53] they were blinded in part for your
[1:21:56] sake right amen because had they receive
[1:22:02] amen
[1:22:03] Christ then we wouldn't had an
[1:22:07] opportunity so God blinded Israel that
[1:22:11] they could reject Christ right amen so
[1:22:15] that we can have an opportunity at at
[1:22:18] the
[1:22:19] word at the grace right right that that
[1:22:24] we could be a Biblical part of
[1:22:28] scripture because according to the
[1:22:30] shadows and types of the Old Testament
[1:22:33] we were there even when we didn't even
[1:22:36] understand the Old Testament
[1:22:38] Bible we were we were
[1:22:41] represented even when we go all the way
[1:22:44] back to
[1:22:45] Genesis amen we were
[1:22:48] represented all right right glory to God
[1:22:52] Amen we were represented in the all way
[1:22:55] before even Genesis 1 and one we were in
[1:22:59] the mind of
[1:23:01] God is that right that's right God God
[1:23:05] fornew us that's right right if he
[1:23:10] didn't for know you you wouldn't be here
[1:23:13] this
[1:23:15] morning see we not here by chance this
[1:23:18] not happen stance this
[1:23:21] morning right everything that God done
[1:23:25] amen God done it for
[1:23:27] me when when the Jews amen cried out for
[1:23:31] his blood right yes sir amen those
[1:23:35] things happened because I was in the
[1:23:38] mind of God I was in the mind of God
[1:23:42] predestinated when I was messed up in
[1:23:44] the streets and on drugs
[1:23:47] amen Calvary was about me their
[1:23:51] rejection
[1:23:54] was about
[1:23:56] me glory to God see if you go in there
[1:24:00] see we we was grafted in you know not
[1:24:04] according to Nature right that's right
[1:24:08] but but the sovereignty of God grafted
[1:24:12] Us in amen right right and in the book
[1:24:16] of Ephesians when they were
[1:24:18] struggling with the Gentiles coming in
[1:24:22] those those you know Jews in the they
[1:24:24] was struggling it was a real
[1:24:27] struggle right for him talk about it cuz
[1:24:30] they was they was on the
[1:24:32] outch y'all know how it is when when
[1:24:35] when when somebody new come in everybody
[1:24:39] that was there get funny feelings and
[1:24:41] and all of that who is him and who is
[1:24:44] she
[1:24:45] and y'all ought to preach with me this
[1:24:51] morning and and Paul had to settle the
[1:24:54] people way back there realizing it's
[1:24:56] just a part of Amen God's plan and
[1:24:59] purpose because God Amen had a a picture
[1:25:03] in View and that the picture in the
[1:25:05] beginning was uh natural Adam and a
[1:25:08] natural Eve the picture in the in in in
[1:25:11] the in the in the end will be am man a
[1:25:14] spiritual Adam and a spiritual
[1:25:17] Eve right glory to God if Adam had a
[1:25:21] wife in the beginning Adam going to have
[1:25:23] a wife now right right in order for the
[1:25:27] picture to be what the picture amen was
[1:25:29] in the
[1:25:30] beginning right if he had a Eve then he
[1:25:33] got a Eve now oh everybody ought to
[1:25:36] praise him off of that
[1:25:39] see and and having the ability to
[1:25:43] recognize these things is
[1:25:46] Paramount right not not just
[1:25:49] religion right to recognize amen
[1:25:52] yourself in the scripture Amen to be
[1:25:55] able to recognize your day in this
[1:25:58] message come on man is that right that's
[1:26:01] that's
[1:26:03] Paramount yes sir cuz a lot of people
[1:26:05] can't see themsel in scripture that's
[1:26:09] right right looking looking at the
[1:26:12] shadows and types they can't see that's
[1:26:15] me right
[1:26:17] there right when I look at when I look
[1:26:19] at Rebecca I see myself
[1:26:24] come
[1:26:25] on oh we could preach on
[1:26:28] that glory to God we can preach on
[1:26:32] that Ela went to find Isaac a wife
[1:26:36] amongst his kid
[1:26:38] folk huh yeah and and right she she they
[1:26:43] got to a place and and and you know uh
[1:26:46] uh and we've had our spiritual Ela right
[1:26:50] hunting a hun the wife we move from that
[1:26:52] I'm me get into that
[1:26:55] huh see we can see ourself in the types
[1:26:58] and shadows of the scripture you know
[1:27:01] when I was a new convert man you used to
[1:27:03] read the Old Testament especially when
[1:27:05] they was doing all this killing and all
[1:27:07] of that stuff man he's like man what's
[1:27:09] this all about but but it's
[1:27:12] spiritual right they had natural Wars we
[1:27:16] got spiritual
[1:27:17] battles right but if God brought them
[1:27:21] through
[1:27:22] God to bring us
[1:27:25] through I like I like Marvin Sapp Never
[1:27:29] Would Have Made
[1:27:32] It glory to God but but let's let's look
[1:27:36] at something this morning right uh it
[1:27:40] says this day that we're living in it's
[1:27:44] such a day of unsettled
[1:27:47] peace but it's scriptural
[1:27:50] now glory to God it's a day of unsettled
[1:27:55] peace but I I I want to stop here right
[1:27:59] but that's for the world
[1:28:03] right that that's for the world see
[1:28:07] that's that should be a peace in the
[1:28:11] heart of the believer right when when
[1:28:14] when everything when everything is going
[1:28:17] on around us that should that should be
[1:28:21] a piece right that should be a
[1:28:24] settling right glory to God glory yeah
[1:28:28] because these things has been spoken
[1:28:31] about and they're not coming they're
[1:28:35] here right amen he says uh It's A
[1:28:39] unsettling peace and unsettled rest
[1:28:45] everywhere
[1:28:46] amen he says people are running to and
[1:28:50] fro speaking what whatever they
[1:28:53] may
[1:28:55] right most anybody can get a
[1:28:59] follower that's
[1:29:02] true most anybody can get I'm telling
[1:29:06] you Church you you I'm going say
[1:29:09] something this is why God gives us
[1:29:12] Shepherds come on people don't believe
[1:29:15] in hardly believe in pastors no more we
[1:29:17] we got our own way of doing things now
[1:29:20] but but you cannot break the order of
[1:29:25] God an evangelist if if you ordained to
[1:29:29] be an evang you can't be a pastor you
[1:29:32] won't have you won't have the tools you
[1:29:35] won't have the
[1:29:36] makeup a teacher none of those different
[1:29:39] things right God gives us Shepherds to
[1:29:42] feed us and lead us they're ordained to
[1:29:47] lead you through brother Jack is
[1:29:50] ordained to lead this Church
[1:29:53] through that there's an order go back to
[1:29:56] the Book of
[1:29:58] Joshua right you could not get ahead of
[1:30:03] Moses go Moses was God's mouthpiece to
[1:30:06] the
[1:30:07] people Moses had the
[1:30:11] instructions right amen and who could
[1:30:15] get ahead of that that's right right
[1:30:18] yeah amen I'm I'm a minister and I got
[1:30:21] pastor story experience but amen I'm
[1:30:25] under
[1:30:27] headship I'm under the leadership of
[1:30:30] brother Jack I don't try to be annoy at
[1:30:32] all I stay out of his
[1:30:34] way and let him lead this
[1:30:37] church is that right because I already
[1:30:40] know the damage that can be done when
[1:30:44] ministers get out of
[1:30:46] place I already know that firsthand all
[1:30:49] right all right yes sir yes sir it's a
[1:30:54] it's a real task Amen brother quo used
[1:30:59] to Pastor it's a real task it it's a lot
[1:31:02] that goes along with it more than just
[1:31:04] preaching a
[1:31:06] sermon that's probably the easy
[1:31:09] part that's right especially once the
[1:31:11] preacher come and you start feeling your
[1:31:14] help and uh you know you feel like
[1:31:16] growling and groaning
[1:31:18] and you know that's the easy part all
[1:31:22] right but the the the hard part is is is
[1:31:26] trying to cultivate people and manage
[1:31:30] people and and and keep people anchored
[1:31:33] and settle people and and and point out
[1:31:36] things to a younger generation and and
[1:31:39] help the Young Generation to know that
[1:31:41] that boy don't mean you no
[1:31:44] good and that g don't mean like my
[1:31:47] grandma used to say that g don't mean
[1:31:49] you no good amen and and and and and
[1:31:53] that's that's where the difficult part
[1:31:55] come in well see D we can't do
[1:31:59] nothing what

[1:32:06] is go to

[1:36:09] move co co
[1:36:14] they like
[1:36:18] rockets
[1:36:20] am
[1:36:22] amen but but let's get back on
[1:36:25] task glory to God glory but he says
[1:36:28] people are running to and
[1:36:32] okay we we got to be careful of what we
[1:36:36] following this is the great age of
[1:36:39] information and and and and podcast I
[1:36:43] ain't never seen so many
[1:36:46] podcast in my
[1:36:48] life and and I I be curious ious about
[1:36:51] the information you know everybody a
[1:36:54] can't do this but you know I'm I'm
[1:36:56] pretty seasoned and and I like to listen
[1:37:00] but I have trouble with the information
[1:37:03] most of the time because I realize most
[1:37:06] of it is secular and it's not biblically
[1:37:10] based right some of it is good but just
[1:37:15] as a whole if if we if we would get back
[1:37:18] to the
[1:37:20] Bible back to the order of things we
[1:37:23] wouldn't really need all of the things
[1:37:25] that we have all of all of these
[1:37:28] different podcast and then a lot of that
[1:37:30] stuff is just really
[1:37:33] foolish right but they got followings
[1:37:36] and they making
[1:37:39] money right and and you you can get on
[1:37:42] these different things and you you could
[1:37:44] listen to these things and I mean it's
[1:37:47] it's all sorts of levels and ring
[1:37:52] right
[1:37:53] spiritually you got to be careful what
[1:37:55] you listening to and who you listening
[1:38:00] to right because it's it's something
[1:38:04] that's out here that'll feed your
[1:38:08] spirit right amen something out here
[1:38:12] that that that'll feed you especially
[1:38:14] when when you a little weak and weary
[1:38:17] and broken a little bit it's something
[1:38:21] out here what looking for my God
[1:38:25] right but the thing that's out here is
[1:38:29] it getting you closer to
[1:38:31] Christ is it strengthening
[1:38:35] you is it producing a holistic view of
[1:38:40] the the person that you
[1:38:44] are come
[1:38:46] on all right all
[1:38:49] right I know brother wo told me don't do
[1:38:52] it but sometime I want to just pull
[1:38:53] y'all I'm trying to change a little
[1:38:55] bit I know things have to
[1:39:00] settle come on got to settle a little
[1:39:06] bit now y'all got to realize I ain't no
[1:39:08] evangelist now all right all right I got
[1:39:11] some years on me yeah but but it's it's
[1:39:15] the truth you got to be careful who you
[1:39:17] listening to right right glory to God
[1:39:21] what who's feeding you what's what what
[1:39:23] you're feeding
[1:39:25] on right glory to God CU cuz one word
[1:39:29] could unsettle you for for
[1:39:32] years in church and you could be so iffy
[1:39:38] yeah and and and kind of on the
[1:39:41] fence and and the gospel doesn't come to
[1:39:44] produce that
[1:39:47] am right see if if we if we're on the f
[1:39:51] this morning pertaining to any Doctrine
[1:39:55] we we need to find out how we get off of
[1:39:58] the fence and that's why we got a
[1:40:02] Shepherd like I told y'all y'all don't
[1:40:04] ask me no questions cuz I ain't the
[1:40:05] pastor asking the brother J but but if
[1:40:09] if there's something if there's
[1:40:11] something that you don't understand
[1:40:14] that's being taught then then then
[1:40:17] brother Jack is
[1:40:19] obligated by his
[1:40:22] calling to do his best to make sure that
[1:40:26] you're
[1:40:28] clear all
[1:40:30] right right amen because you you could
[1:40:33] never walk into a Rapture and be
[1:40:39] wavering right come on Church you you
[1:40:41] can never walk into a
[1:40:43] Rapture just really wavering yeah amen
[1:40:47] you you got to be stable you got to be
[1:40:49] anchored right go back to
[1:40:53] Ephesians that that's the calling of the
[1:40:55] fivefold
[1:40:57] ministry right but but
[1:41:01] see the thing that we're trying to do
[1:41:04] Christ is doing the calling yes amen cuz
[1:41:07] you can't come to you
[1:41:12] call and all that the father give me
[1:41:15] they
[1:41:17] coming sister T ain't you sing this song
[1:41:20] and he never lost
[1:41:23] one he didn't lose one he will not lose
[1:41:27] one this morning no matter what state
[1:41:30] they in this morning God cannot will not
[1:41:35] lose
[1:41:37] one see I can't be
[1:41:39] lost and I'm in the fight of my life but
[1:41:43] I ain't worried about
[1:41:44] [Applause]
[1:41:48] itall see God call me all right I ain't
[1:41:53] call
[1:41:55] myself that's right God called me when I
[1:41:59] was when I was at my worst he didn't he
[1:42:00] didn't call me when I was at my
[1:42:03] best right as a young fell going to pom
[1:42:07] God he ain't called me then thinking I
[1:42:09] was spoty with my crew and and had
[1:42:12] aspirations to go to the NBA and all
[1:42:15] that he a call me then come on he waited
[1:42:18] till my life was turned upside down
[1:42:23] right then God called me say you in the
[1:42:25] condition
[1:42:26] now for me to to get you where I need
[1:42:29] you to
[1:42:30] go right and I'm still a work in
[1:42:33] progress right I realize that every day
[1:42:36] like K day man I'm still a work in
[1:42:40] progress y'all is too you might as well
[1:42:43] say
[1:42:44] amen I know y'all be trying to be deep
[1:42:47] and
[1:42:49] sanctimonious
[1:42:51] we could come through here with a hammer
[1:42:53] and won't nobody say Amen when we got
[1:42:56] done y'all don't get sanctimonious on me
[1:42:58] this
[1:42:59] morning like I'm the only one got
[1:43:04] problems uh we all got work in progress
[1:43:08] and if that's the case nobody can't look
[1:43:10] at nobody
[1:43:12] funny amen that's right is that right
[1:43:15] glory to
[1:43:16] God amen amen because when the word
[1:43:20] comes you we realize boy it's a whole
[1:43:21] lot that I don't know it's a whole lot
[1:43:24] that I'm not
[1:43:25] doing glory to God amen glory to
[1:43:30] God now y'all know I just I just preach
[1:43:34] he says uh but no matter what they teach
[1:43:37] or think somebody will listen to them
[1:43:40] and it's a day that the prophet spoke of
[1:43:44] people when they're hungry they they eat
[1:43:47] from
[1:43:48] anywhere if children and people people
[1:43:51] are starving they'll eat from a garbage
[1:43:54] can that that once eat from a nice
[1:44:00] table right so you got to be
[1:44:03] careful but if they're hungry they'll
[1:44:05] eat somewhere so I think real true
[1:44:08] Ministers of the Gospel ought to be up
[1:44:12] and going and and ought to be giv the
[1:44:15] people the right things meet in
[1:44:19] season yes sir
[1:44:22] that's right right amen we're trying to
[1:44:25] give you meet in season something that's
[1:44:29] that's relevant right glory to God glory
[1:44:33] to God trying to give you something that
[1:44:36] that's relevant something that that
[1:44:39] that's scriptural something that's
[1:44:42] that's
[1:44:43] stabilizing yeah right be
[1:44:47] because we we can see where we've gone
[1:44:50] through the the history of the Gentile
[1:44:53] church right we we've come through seven
[1:44:56] Church ages yes sir exactly right
[1:44:59] according to the Book of Revelations and
[1:45:02] and now we we in the
[1:45:04] cap right we we in the head we we've
[1:45:08] been we've been called out and
[1:45:12] up amen right Amen brother glory to God
[1:45:17] see the ra I'm I'm not looking for the
[1:45:22] Rapture right we we we we are and we're
[1:45:26] in
[1:45:27] it right glory to God hallelujah amen
[1:45:32] see we we've been called out of the
[1:45:34] Pentecostal amen uh
[1:45:37] age we're we're not a Pentecostal
[1:45:40] denomination we're not Apostolic by
[1:45:43] denomination we're Apostolic because of
[1:45:46] the book of Act is alive and
[1:45:49] real amen amen we Pentecostal by an
[1:45:54] experience an expression of Jesus Christ
[1:45:57] in our life not by
[1:46:00] denomination see by denomination they
[1:46:04] only had the restoration of the gift not
[1:46:06] the restoration of the word amen see we
[1:46:10] we have all of that plus hallelujah amen
[1:46:15] right amen glory to God Amen true not
[1:46:19] just not just you know uh signs wonders
[1:46:23] and miracles and you know speaking in
[1:46:25] tongues and Prophet line and a lot of
[1:46:28] that stuff you know that's right amen
[1:46:33] which was which was they had genuine
[1:46:35] gifts and they had their part the isua
[1:46:38] street and all that that was that was
[1:46:40] their portion yes but but we've we've
[1:46:43] moved out of that in into a great light
[1:46:46] yes sir AR rise and shine thy light has
[1:46:49] come the glory of the Lord is was risen
[1:46:51] yes sir is that right we we got
[1:46:55] light in another day they had light for
[1:46:59] their
[1:47:01] day right but see we understand the
[1:47:06] history of the church ages from Paul all
[1:47:10] the way up right amen is that right
[1:47:13] glory to God Amen we understand amen
[1:47:17] Paul's Ministry to the ephes
[1:47:21] Teaching Ministry we understand that and
[1:47:25] and just all the way up to Luther and
[1:47:27] Wesley Pentecost we understand their
[1:47:30] Ministry by the
[1:47:32] word right glory to God amen amen but we
[1:47:37] we're in another day and and it's it I'm
[1:47:40] me tell you something it's a blessing to
[1:47:43] be able to recognize your day in this
[1:47:47] message that that's not a skim milk
[1:47:49] statement
[1:47:51] right cuz because there's a lot there's
[1:47:54] a lot that's that's that's transpiring
[1:47:56] around us amen but the way that I look
[1:48:00] at it from a scriptural standpoint I'm
[1:48:01] not moved by it right because I
[1:48:04] recognize the day and hour that I'm
[1:48:07] living in another quote from uh 1954 the
[1:48:11] great and coming revival and outpouring
[1:48:13] of the Holy Spirit he says um uh do not
[1:48:18] like to say this but after to travel in
[1:48:20] many many nations and seeing the
[1:48:24] conditions of the other
[1:48:26] nations right thinking of our our lovely
[1:48:30] Nation here it's great and they say to
[1:48:34] be an
[1:48:36] American yeah I say this to be a
[1:48:41] Christian I've been
[1:48:43] elevated glory to
[1:48:45] God because being American comes with a
[1:48:48] lot but we got to be identified with
[1:48:50] with in glory and the shame to be
[1:48:52] American and sometime it's more shamed
[1:48:54] than it is
[1:48:56] Glory come on
[1:48:58] Church come on church it's more shame
[1:49:00] than it is Glory but but we
[1:49:04] identified glory to God I mean way back
[1:49:07] way back in the day when when the
[1:49:10] American people they used to put a sign
[1:49:12] up in the catacombs over there and say
[1:49:14] to the American women you know put on
[1:49:17] some clothes right the the what
[1:49:20] reference the
[1:49:22] dead right but but come on Church look
[1:49:26] at look at it
[1:49:28] now look just just look at what's
[1:49:32] reality to the people now yeah right and
[1:49:36] and and I'm quite sure an could attest
[1:49:39] to this when we went to school we went

[2:00:11] destructions are hanging everywhere this
[2:00:15] is this is what we're we're we're seeing
[2:00:17] right the of Destruction because men are
[2:00:22] walking right like they did in the days
[2:00:26] of
[2:00:27] Noah after their own will
[2:00:31] instead of seeking the will of
[2:00:35] God right God's will is his
[2:00:39] word glory to God check check check your
[2:00:43] walk out by the
[2:00:45] word and that that'll show you whether
[2:00:48] or not you you in the will of
[2:00:51] God right amen if if you can't find what
[2:00:55] you're doing in the word you might not
[2:00:59] be in the whe amen right
[2:01:03] Glory he says our world has become
[2:01:06] modern every civilization that's built
[2:01:09] up till they hit the
[2:01:13] climax then the Pinnacle swings and she
[2:01:17] goes to the bottom and and that's where
[2:01:19] we
[2:01:20] haded right glory to God I'm pretty sure
[2:01:25] by the reading of the scripture and the
[2:01:28] signpost that that we're passing that
[2:01:32] we're nearing the coming of the Lord
[2:01:36] Jesus right see what we're
[2:01:39] seeing is signpost to us right of his
[2:01:44] his second Advent to the world then he
[2:01:48] will have one one more event to come I'm
[2:01:51] I'm I'mma go here and then I'mma quit
[2:01:54] y'all bear with
[2:01:55] me all right he says there'll be three
[2:01:59] advents of the Lord
[2:02:01] Jesus the first to redeem his bride that
[2:02:06] was that's that's what Calvary was all
[2:02:07] about right to pay the price of
[2:02:11] redemption we had a debt we couldn't pay
[2:02:13] it was it was too big sir right he says
[2:02:18] um he says the first is to redeem the
[2:02:21] bride when he died for her he said now
[2:02:24] the second this where we at now to
[2:02:28] receive his bride that's what that's
[2:02:30] what the Rapture is all about that's why
[2:02:32] we're here trying to get in condition to
[2:02:35] leave here yes sir right you get in
[2:02:38] Rapture in condition that's a quote amen
[2:02:42] right and and see the only thing that
[2:02:45] can get us in that condition is the
[2:02:47] word that's right amen you can be
[2:02:50] excited all you want to but it takes the
[2:02:52] word to get you in the condition to to
[2:02:56] wash you to cleanse you right to
[2:02:59] transform you to renew you is that right
[2:03:03] to settle you amen if it wasn't for the
[2:03:06] word of God I don't know where I'd be at
[2:03:07] this
[2:03:09] moment is that right that's that's my
[2:03:11] only hope is the word amen glory to God
[2:03:16] all right I'm almost there amen he said
[2:03:19] says uh he said when uh when he comes
[2:03:22] for her he said then the third with his
[2:03:24] bride for the
[2:03:26] Millennium and and and there'll be three
[2:03:28] advents and one of them is pass and the
[2:03:32] signposts are showing that we're near
[2:03:35] the second
[2:03:37] event right sir that's the
[2:03:41] arrival right or the emergence or the
[2:03:44] materialization right the second event
[2:03:47] of the Lord Jesus we've tried everything
[2:03:50] we've had all kinds of big you know four
[2:03:54] meetings and so forth but but Church you
[2:03:58] know
[2:04:00] um we we we're we're at a we're at a
[2:04:04] point now where it's important that
[2:04:08] we're clear about what's going on that's
[2:04:11] right is that right that that we we when
[2:04:14] we when we look at things we we are
[2:04:17] clear about what we're looking at
[2:04:20] it's it's it's a blessing to be able to
[2:04:23] recognize the
[2:04:26] signpost and and the sign post produce
[2:04:29] an
[2:04:30] urgency right cuz when when anything
[2:04:34] major
[2:04:35] happens right it it if you're a part of
[2:04:38] God it seem like it sends an
[2:04:41] urgency right it like wait a minute wait
[2:04:44] a minute wait a minute I heard that
[2:04:46] before huh but to not be able to
[2:04:50] recognize let the musicians make their
[2:04:52] way to not be able to recognize the day
[2:04:56] and hour and the sign post that's on the
[2:05:00] you cuz we've been on a journey and and
[2:05:03] and you you're going somewhere we've
[2:05:05] been going to a
[2:05:08] Rapture right a change of our
[2:05:11] bodies we've been preaching this second
[2:05:14] coming and now we we we've been seeing
[2:05:17] all along
[2:05:20] and just to see what we see it's an
[2:05:23] indication that we this thing is coming
[2:05:25] to its
[2:05:26] end right cuz I ain't even get to it but
[2:05:30] he's going to graft in again yes sir
[2:05:34] right Israel the gospel is eventually as
[2:05:39] it relates to the Gentile churches this
[2:05:42] thing is going to come to an
[2:05:45] end right we we don't know when that
[2:05:48] last predestinated seed comes in then
[2:05:51] we'll
[2:05:52] go we don't know who that is when
[2:05:55] that'll
[2:05:57] be but you got to be
[2:06:00] ready right you just got to be ready we
[2:06:04] just sing that song will you be
[2:06:08] ready right when Jesus

[2:06:30] Jack know this one when Jesus
[2:06:35] come will you
[2:06:40] be de in
[2:06:42] [Music]
[2:06:45] Jus
[2:06:47] comes let's give the Lord a hand of
[2:06:51] praise for his
[2:06:55] word appreciate brother
[2:06:58] Smiley man I was just um thinking just
[2:07:02] how perfect uh the sermon was for just
[2:07:06] where we are um if you go back and look
[2:07:09] at the scripture that he
[2:07:11] read uh out of Luke chapter
[2:07:14] 21 there should be signs in the Sun and
[2:07:17] in the Moon and the stars and I believe
[2:07:20] it was just
[2:07:22] yesterday uh we had a a solar
[2:07:26] eclipse uh and um again that's a a sign
[2:07:30] you know we we know that the war and
[2:07:33] everything is going on over in Israel
[2:07:35] and and uh the scripture you know just
[2:07:38] talked about these things these are
[2:07:41] SST uh you know he was just reading that
[2:07:44] and and as we just just sometime pause
[2:07:46] and just take a look around uh listen to
[2:07:49] what's going on around you you you
[2:07:50] realize that the sign post are just
[2:07:52] showing uh all the time and uh the the
[2:07:56] the critical thing here is that when we
[2:07:59] see the signpost we need to start making
[2:08:02] greater
[2:08:03] preparation a little bit too much amen
[2:08:07] uh and um I don't I
[2:08:11] um I'm sure many of you all have taken
[2:08:14] uh trips before and I've with my family
[2:08:18] I
[2:08:19] uh I was blessed to have my wife and
[2:08:21] three daughters and uh so when we would
[2:08:25] take trips especially in the car um if
[2:08:29] we were going to a meeting um something
[2:08:32] you know going to a convention or
[2:08:33] something like that they always wanted
[2:08:35] to know give me just about let us know
[2:08:40] how long before we actually gone G get
[2:08:42] there because before we get there I need
[2:08:45] to make a
[2:08:47] stop and and um they would be dressed a
[2:08:50] certain way in the car not not you know
[2:08:53] anything ungodly or anything like that
[2:08:55] but maybe they might have
[2:08:57] rollers in the hair are y'all talking to
[2:09:00] me
[2:09:02] yet they might have rollers in the hair
[2:09:05] they might have that scarf on Bonnet
[2:09:08] Bonnet they might have the Bonnet on
[2:09:10] because the Bonnet is on to protect the
[2:09:13] hair y'all talking to me but before we
[2:09:17] get there I need to have all these
[2:09:18] things in place but but but but but when
[2:09:21] we arrive I'm not walking into that
[2:09:25] place with this Bonnet on I'm not
[2:09:27] walking in there with this these rollers
[2:09:30] in my hand I'm going need to stop and
[2:09:33] I'm going need to get myself prepared
[2:09:35] before I actually present myself and and
[2:09:38] see so so there was greater
[2:09:40] preparation that took place at the time
[2:09:43] of
[2:09:47] our yes and and and I'm here to let you
[2:09:50] know this morning I stopped by to tell
[2:09:53] you it's it's it's greater preparation
[2:09:56] needed right
[2:09:57] now you got to look at the signpost that
[2:10:00] brother Smiley was talking about it's
[2:10:02] the second Advent of the Lord Jesus
[2:10:04] Christ and now it's time for greater
[2:10:07] preparation not just preparation but
[2:10:09] greater
[2:10:12] preparation amen we need a scripture
[2:10:16] absolute we need a scripture absolute
[2:10:18] abute and and there's no need for us to
[2:10:20] be wavering now we've been we've been
[2:10:24] this this we we've been in this way for
[2:10:26] a long time and uh and and and I I I am
[2:10:30] I was telling my wife this morning that
[2:10:32] um you know uh people that have these
[2:10:36] different thoughts about the prophet and
[2:10:39] about the message and and all of this
[2:10:41] just just I don't know where they get
[2:10:42] these thoughts from all I can tell it's
[2:10:44] a spirit that comes into the land and
[2:10:47] attacks the people people and and the
[2:10:49] sad part is that they don't realize that
[2:10:51] is a signpost the signpost actually said
[2:10:54] that you know there would be a greater
[2:10:57] there would be a fallen away right and
[2:11:00] uh so so uh there's a couple things I
[2:11:02] can tell you the the scripture also says
[2:11:04] that as it was in the days of lot so
[2:11:07] shall it be in the coming of the son of
[2:11:09] man so a signpost is is that there is a
[2:11:13] spirit that will enter into the land
[2:11:16] amen that will attack people people and
[2:11:18] cause them to move into the life of a
[2:11:21] man this homosexual lifestyle right it's
[2:11:23] a spirit that comes in it's a spirit
[2:11:26] that causes people to do the great
[2:11:28] Fallen away it's a spirit that actually
[2:11:31] comes into the land and and if you're
[2:11:32] not uh uh um if you're not if you don't
[2:11:36] have a scriptural absolute then you
[2:11:37] won't recognize the spirit that's
[2:11:40] attacking people that's all it is it's a
[2:11:42] spirit so the Lord showed me say you
[2:11:44] know brother brandom had a vision one
[2:11:46] time he had so certain
[2:11:49] seeds it sold these seeds you know in
[2:11:52] the earth traveled around the world
[2:11:54] seven times and he sold all these seeds
[2:11:56] but he said then after he left there was
[2:11:59] a man dressed in black that came at
[2:12:02] right after him and what did that man
[2:12:03] begin to do he began to seow seeds now
[2:12:07] here's the thing it's not our job to go
[2:12:09] pick up the seeds that the man in black
[2:12:13] sowed according to the scripture we let
[2:12:16] them grow together
[2:12:18] and when they grow together you just
[2:12:20] keep living your life but let them grow
[2:12:22] together and at the end Jesus Christ
[2:12:24] himself will do the
[2:12:28] separated sheep on this side goats on
[2:12:32] that
[2:12:33] side so we ain't got nothing to worry
[2:12:35] about it nothing to fight about nothing
[2:12:36] to I mean just just you just keep doing
[2:12:38] what God called you to do and and know
[2:12:41] that somebody there's going to be
[2:12:42] somebody dressed in black coming right
[2:12:44] behind everything you doing yeah hello
[2:12:46] somebody amen amen but I'm holding on
[2:12:49] with everything I got I thank God for
[2:12:51] the promises that God has given me no
[2:12:53] matter what my family is going through I
[2:12:55] I ain't looking at I ain't thinking
