years that he's kept me and he's kept me through this year uh the beginning of the year even last year I was going through with my mortgage um basically it started out because I had damage in my kitchen and they um it didn't get done in time as they felt it should have been so they dropped my insurance and dropping my insurance they put a force Insurance Force insurance was like say 7,000 for 3 months then they added on about 3,700 then 45 it was really bad it was it was stressful to say the least um I ended up filling out a form twice uh for modification and um when you do that it's a lot of paperwork a lot of paperwork and I truly thank God that in all of that the Lord saw fit to give me that modification and I'm really grateful to God I'm grateful for this ministry because in all all of that it was a lot um I didn't want to really involve the children cuz they get so nervous and um but I thank God for my church family my pastor brother Jerry my sister car just different ones that really help me out through different things and I'm really grateful to you all all your prayers your love because um um you know it's not easy being by yourself um I do it's just God has really kept me through these years and I am so grateful for my church family um I can truly say that God is real and I'm standing here saying see what the Lord Has Done bless [Applause] amen thank the Lord um I just want to thank God for being here tonight I want to thank God for Life health and strength and I was just um thinking today well it started last week um you know during the holidays you know the devil come with like depression and sadness but I know um the the Lord took me back to when I first started this journey alone and I said to him I said God I've never been alone how am I going to do this and he said to me forget about you and think about others so down through these years I've been a caretaker for so many family members been there for other people and and throughout that and I've just seen so much but like sister Brown say it's not easy being alone but I just want to thank God for his grace and his Mercy I want to thank God for most of all how I've been a caretaker for so many people and I just want to thank God up until this point right [Music] [Applause] now how he kept me amen I can say it's truly a blessing for me that I'm whole I'm Healed I'm healthy I've never taken any medications and I do everything for myself like sister Brown say I don't like to invar my kids cuz I always say they have their own lives and I just thank God for how he kept me and blessed me to be able to do that my daily prayer is Lord blessed me to be a blessing so in order to be a blessing you have to be healthy hold your right mind you know sometime I'm driving down the road and I think to myself I'm a senior and I'm flying down the road I can really take care of myself I'm in my right mind you know I can do for me you know I can still do for others and help others and Saints that's a blessing that's really a blessing because now in this age it's so much going on so much I mean in all areas of your life in all areas of the world is so much going on and to say that you're whole you're healthy you're in your right mind is truly God Amen not not me not us it's God and to be here another year and be gathered together to still give him the Glory Hallelujah it's a blessing and I just want to give him all the praise and all the honor amen [Applause] God bless you Saints uh just want to thank God for um uh an incredible 2024 for uh my family uh my my household um so three about 3 years ago um brother Jack spoke to me uh um and asked me to start praying about potentially uh being a deacon now this is something that I've never desired in my life um where where I come from um the deacons are normally the the Elders of the church and normally growing up the deacons of the people you dislike the most so it's not something that I ever desired and even when he asked me to pray about it it's I can't I can't say I I when he told me that I was praying hard about it because it's hard to pray for something you don't really want um but I I would pray um and you know you know year a year passed uh brother Jack uh checked checked back in with me and I told him I wasn't ready um you know time kept passing um and like I said it was it I I did pray but it was hard to you know pray for something that I didn't really desire um but in 2023 brother Jack uh spoke a lot about yielding to the perfect will of God and um my wife and I were just were talking and we were just wondering like why why us you know why why me when you know I I don't feel worthy for for that but uh I remember I believe my wife said something along the lines of you know brother brother Jack is you know a spiritual man so if it's put it was put upon brother Jack's heart to ask you for that he didn't just wake up and do that God God probably spoke to him about that um so we started looking at it differently and by the end of the year um we brother Jack checked checked back in with us and I told him that while I wasn't thrilled about it I would just yield to the perfect will of God and so the amazing thing about it was once I yielded to the perfect will of God God blessed us with the most incredible year that we've had since we've been married um beginning of 2024 um uh our green cards came out and we became permanent residents of this country [Applause] um and that's that's that was a a long journey for us and it it's like the devil just kept fighting bringing thing after thing after thing that just kept blocking us from becoming permanent residents up until you know we had to try and shift certain things almost had to leave the country but God just worked it out that after we yielded within I think about 30 days or so uh our green cards were approved um so I thank God for that and um I was also able to uh to travel with my family for the first time we went to England for Easter had the most incredible time there uh when we when when we got back um we were both blessed um with you know with with with financial increase on our jobs which we were praying for um with thank God for that because it allowed us to be in a position where we could uh purchase a new home and so we thank God for blessing us with the new home um he gave us he did he did exceeding abundantly above uh all we could ask for um we were looking for uh a five-bedroom home but by God's grace he gave us uh six bedrooms uh so we thank God for that um and I also want to thank God cuz I was able to finish uh my second Masters this year as well and so 20 2024 has been an incredible year and we're just under great expectation for what God has for us in 2025 so thank you hallelujah thank you thank you Lord a good evening Saints um I just want to thank the Lord first of all I thought I was going to be going live I um pray on Facebook and I thought I was going to be going live to pray tonight um but the Holy Spirit put in my heart to come to church and I was when I got out the park out the truck I said I was glad when they said when you said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord and when I came in I saw testimony you know I don't you don't see that anymore in the churches testimony meeting it's so very important you know to have testimony meeting so as I was sitting here I wasn't goingon to say anything but God has been really good to me in 2024 you know um it's been a very very for me I think since 2000 every year has just gotten worse and I've just wanted God to just take me from this Earth so many times and he just refused uh he saved me from a heart attack at 42 uh he delivered me from blood clots in my lungs I wouldn't even take the medicine cuz I wanted to to die and um I remember the one time the doctor a team of doctors they said Miss Clark you know you have several clots you have several pockets in your lungs and you have several clots in your pockets and if one burst you could die and I was just like saying why can't it just burst and I never knew that um God wanted to use me in the way he's been using me on my different platforms um I went through so much I just didn't feel like I had anything to contribute but I didn't realize I was an olive being pressed and so I thank God for keeping me when I didn't want to be kept I thank him for everything that I went through I still can sing and praise His name you know the enemy has tried to get me to just stop praising God all together and uh there was one time I told the Lord if I ever go back I'm not coming back no more I've been out left him and come back and left him and come back and I just felt like a yo-yo but I thank God for loving me when I didn't know what love is and uh I just thank God for this beautiful church cuzz I've been to several churches and the testimony of those churches is a bad report this church has the spirit of the Lord in it it has the spirit of the Lord in it and so I thank God for the fire that burns here and I ask the Saints to just pray much for me that I will continue to seek God like never before I want to read my Bible more I want to fast more um I just want to be sold out to God more Hallelujah because I don't have anything else in this earth my name is Angela so my greatest investment is in people and not in things so I just thank God for my place here tonight I thank God for being alive with the land of the living and uh I just want to just tell you all stay encouraged Hallelujah stay encourage Hallelujah I I I said to somebody a while ago that that God looked over at Jesus and said this girl really is crazy she want to die for real she don't want to take her medicine let me go ahead and heal her and so I'm so thankful that he loved me y'all pray my strength in the [Applause] Lord God bless you um I just want to thank God for this year it has been a wonderful year um like sister Smith and sister Brown has said you know sometimes you go through things and it's not easy when you're alone but we're never alone um because even when we don't have anybody there physically we have somebody there that we can just pray to and um just Comfort us and during that time where you don't feel like you you you just don't feel like yourself I'll say it like that um but I also want to thank God for our church because brother Jack not only preaches natur uh spiritually but he also preaches natural things we we have to learn how to live naturally while we're here but while we're here naturally we also have to get ready to to to leave here so that's where the spiritual part comes in and um I had put my house on the market and I was just like uh whatever um at first I was like yeah yeah yeah I want to sell it then as it didn't sell I just got to the point where I was just like well I ain't got to move I'm fine and um I had two contracts to fall through and that was kind of discouraging and um when I kind of got to the point of whatever I really don't have to move I'm fine you know this this big house I just stay in here by myself is fine um somebody came through and they they offered us um you know a certain amount and I thank God for brother Jack and sister Erica just helping me navigate through something like this um I haven't purchased a home in almost 30 years so to navigate through all of that it was like I I don't know what I'm doing and just to see how not my brother-in-law but my pastor not my sister but my my my pastor's wife they encouraged me they helped me they helped me go through all of it and I just thank God that um I was able to sell my house in the morning and purchase another house in the afternoon and I'm I'm really grateful for that how God just worked everything out so smoothly and uh you know I I I also thank God because during all of this time I just didn't feel good in my body was sick here sick there just not really knowing what was going on and things like that and through it all God just bought me through it all through it you know just a whole bunch of things were going on just with the house and still trying to work and just just trying to figure everything out and uh God just bought me through through through it all and the other thing that brother Jack tells us is you know you don't need to be financially strapped you know that you get out of debt if you can you know and I thank God that I've paid off my my car I don't have any bills and all I have is a very small car uh house note that's it that's all I have you know and I thank God for being financially stable where as Sister Sister Smith was saying I want to bless others the more you bless the more you open the door for God to bless you and I have seen that in so many ways in my personal life but now God has put me in a position where I can bless people and and and not saying you know Lord okay I'mma bless this so now you got to bless me but you know just being able to say you know here's a little something here's a little something and also given of my time and and everybody that's worked at the pantry you know I'm so grateful for that where we've gone out and blessed the people of the community and and just how God has opened so many doors that I have been able to be affiliated with and just all in all I thank God for 2024 it has truly exceeded my expectations and I I just thank God I'm getting comfortable in my little house you know but um it's just been a blessing it really really has and I just thank God for 2024 [Music] [Applause] hallelujah thank you God bless you amen oh boy I just can't leave here tonight without giving God the Praises am reaching 75 years coming into 2025 I never saw myself here but I'm here and I thank him for my life my health even though I have some issues I still save my health and my strength and I'm trusting him to uh touch my body but uh I'm just reminded of a little chor the lord gave me so many years ago but it's sort of coming alive again and uh too many to number too many to number my blessings are far too many to number when I try counting and keeping score his sweet Spirit shows me so much more Hallelujah His blessings abound to me and that's where I am tonight thank him for bringing me through 2024 a lot of changes for how he healed my daughter through uh amen hallelujah hallu hallelujah I thank him for how you know you all know the situation in my household but God has given me wisdom how to handle it and I see fruit coming from it I'm so thankful you know I feel like any day now any day now things could change and I like I say my blessings are far too many to number tonight [Music] [Applause] God bless everybody it's good to be in the house of the Lord tonight you know I really wasn't going to say anything but uh I just thank God for his grace and mercies and for Just For His blessings uh Brothers was laughing at me they they say yeah you a senior citizen and I said well you know what I am and it's good to to be able to say I'm a senior citizen you know I I just never thought uh I'd be 62 years old uh the way I grew up and you know but I've been I mean I've been saved a long time now but just the start of the journey was kind of rough up until 25 and then I got converted but I I I appreciate the Lord I appreciate God Grace and mercies I had a a a tremendous mental battle I think this year not so much physical but just mental not really having no real Direction um I I just felt led this this year not to do too much uh traveling and I just kind of sat sat back and just you know fed on the word and was encouraged and just tried to help out when Jack asked me to preach just preach but I In the Flesh I didn't want it in my mind I didn't want to do anything but uh I I said um the beginning of the year you know I've I've had several Brothers calling me to come and preach for him and uh I just you know I just decided that well you know this year I'll start uh getting back out in the field um and just trying to exercise the gift uh that God has placed in my life one thing I know that uh if if God gives you something we know he's not an Indian giver it it ain't gone anywhere it just needs somebody to to pull on it and and it it'll work so uh y'all just continue to pray for us uh for 202 you know I'm just kind of preparing I already got several meetings lined up you know uh in state and out of state so y'all pray for me like you said I a I ain't a spring chicken no more I don't really like planes but I got to get on

you brother Smiley my testimony um I just thought it'd be robbery if I didn't you know just thank the Lord for just what he's done throughout the year um uh there's so much that I can think about that the Lord has done for my family and I but just uh just several weeks ago this this really uh Quicken my heart and uh just speaking with my wife through a few things and just thinking about how God has just dealt with me throughout my life and I just was brought back to some 13 years ago when I I accepted his invitation to serve him and I just realized that uh when I accepted that invitation um it was also the birth of certain complexes in my life and I was reminded of the word of God where it says where Christ spoke to his disciples about the parable of the field and he said uh he sowed seeds but the enemy came and and seeds as well his disciples asked them uh shall we pluck them out and Christ answered no let them grow together and he'll do the separating at the Harvest Time and just through the years I I've just seen how God has has been allowing uh certain things uh to mature in my life um concerning the the gifts he's given uh and the the responsibility he's called me to and just this year I I really feel like he's allowed me to really come to a place of of yielding to his perfect will um where I can see him doing the separation uh between what he calls me to do and the trials uh that the enemy would bring on my in my life so thank God for the Deliverance uh from the complexes um and thank God that he's given uh us a spiritual Pastor uh to speak about these things and and to bring awareness of of what the word of God is doing um in each season of our lives and the other thing I want to thank God for is each of you all um the love that I've received throughout the year the fellowship um it it means more to me um then you'll never know and my desire is is the desire that I've heard from many you know is to be able to give more and more of myself so I want to thank God for that and and trusting that as we Embark the new year he open up those doors God bless [Applause] you God bless you all sounds like uh we a blessed Church man I I'm pretty sure that I could uh repeat many of the things that people are the Saints are thanking God for um as the testimonies we're going um I every single year since I've been serving him he's been more than good to me even on my worst year that I've ever could think that I've had he was good enough for that year cuz he kept me you know and and ever since the day 15 years ago when I gave my life to the Lord I haven't taken a step back I fought through it and it hasn't been it's been because of him but um um out of all the things I can think of it's one thing that um helped me with and and and I told that I would share and and and it just kind of got upet it was a testimony in the last day of the year was like I did Lord that I would share this little thing that he helped me with and um uh I guess the the as you're walked with God the the devil uh I believe that brother brandham said that the the devil and the and his angels are not just throwing like some crazy punches they they're studying each and one of us and they're making a plan on how they're going to be effective in what they throw at us so as we go through our walk and go through different uh uh uh uh stages he different battles you know maybe at the beginning he's you struggling with drinking smoking and he throw some of that and then maybe it's a and and then after that it could be music or I can think of so many things but this the devil uh was was fighting me and and I think that's a pretty good place to attack if you can actually do some damage if you can get somebody's then then you mess up some stuff um it was happening for for for a couple of months and and I remember um uh a couple of years ago because it goes some sometimes you know like that scripture they were saying that that sometimes you you you got to pray and kick a devil out and the brother Jack brought that he said you you I'm kicking you out and you're and come back no more you know so so I never heard that like that and that's a big big one for me a big Revelation when I heard that but one year I was going through something like that and and and the Bible tells you to uh uh confess your faults to one another so I I spoke to brother Jerry and I was telling him what was going on talking me with prayer and and we got to talk and he actually told me what brother I thank you so much for coming and talking to me because I'm going through the same thing right now and and both of us exposed the devil at that moment and I I got deliverance from it and I'm pretty sure that he also did we never went back and talked about it but um point this year was going through for a couple of months and and it's hard because it's not that you don't want to pray it's hard it's not that that that you're trying to get away from it it's actually you have a desire to pray you want to see the Lord you know that that's what you're looking for this is not a situation whether I'm like debating whether I want to serve the Lord or whether I want no this is a full complete surrender to God in in in everything do myself and and and and when it gets to the prayer time it it's interrupted in many different ways uh things you don't even think about and they come to that H H uh children come across wife uh uh phone uh every everything possible and and and the place where I started talking talking to the Lord not praying every time I tried praying I talk I said you know what's going on like can you please help me out so then I'm study this you know I had that thought about the devil say stud to attack I'm going to study what's going on so at this point we get to PTO we're going to the trip in PTO and I'm asking the Lord said Lord we were praying for the trip and I maybe my Deliverance is not here maybe it's over there you know we over there and first night there uh they give us a a really nice little apartment and and and it's just me and the girls they give us a whole house for us and I said here it is you know there's no girls got their own room you know because I the conclusion that it was that was really busy that we had CH young children that that live stuff that and I couldn't I I couldn't like come to say okay it cannot what's holding me from being able to pray cannot be the things that God has blessed me with it kind it it wouldn't make any sense to me but um so anyways so that night I tried to enter we we're in the when you go outside it was just like woods and it was dark and and I put some prayer music I couldn't couldn't same thing again um service that night and and I came back the next night and the same thing again you know um the the next night after that the girls asked me if they can stay over the pastor's wife uh the pastor's house with the daughter and I was like this is this is it now now I'm here I'm by myself it's going to happen and I'm asking the Lord I say Lord help me I I I want to spend some time I don't just want to I didn't want to just KN and pray I wanted to spend time with the Lord couldn't happen so that night when when when when I it couldn't happen I was like this is it you know I I I've came to the place where I it's not all those it had to be the devil putting those things in my head like is this is this is this is this um uh and and and so we went to the to the service and when we came out of the service I I asked brother quu and brother Mark I said man I need to talk to y'all right now like I need you guys to pray for me right now because the devil has not is not attacking my prayer life he has Tak prayer life so um they said no problem we're going to pray right now so we got we went to a little corner and and and they land on me and they started praying for me as we were praying e I I felt like a a third hand on my back and and and and when when when we finished praying I I didn't call this third person this third person just popped up and was also praying cuz when I asked them there was nobody around they didn't hear that I needed prayer and when I finished when we finish praying uh I I start talking to to the the brother that came up and and I started telling him you know because he didn't know what we were praying I had told the other two brothers so I started talking to him and I telling him and I can't believe this and and I got to the point where I had to expose the the expose the devil and he then starts talking to me and telling me that he is actually going through the same thing at that moment um so um after the brothers pray for me you know um that night I was I was able to pray it I can't say that it was a full Deliverance but I accepted it as uh when when they're in the meetings and somebody came through a prayer line and and and and and the prophet uh uh uh uh told them that they were healed go home and and receive your healing maybe they didn't feel the healing at the moment but it was already spoken it was a spoken word um and and and and going to that um uh uh today uh I for for for about about a month I've been I've been asking the Lord you know brother Jack one time he said you know the Lord don't speak as much people say he speaks you know and and a lot of times people maybe they think that the Lord is speaking to them he's speaking all this in my in my walk with the Lord the the when he when he does when I feel that he actually speaks to me is it's it's it's big you know um um and and and I've been seeking the Lord for for for for for certain answers and and and I just wouldn't hear back you know but but but I never my faith was never never wavered it was just like a concern that I was having uh um and why the Lord is not speaking to me and I'm I'm really seeking and really asking and and getting no answer back and kind of just holding back you know W with with certain examples in the Bible where uh certain uh prophets have spoke to the Lord and he has not spoken to them for a certain time so I've been been patient and um uh the other day about 5 days ago um I I was read I'm reading in a certain place in the Bible and and all of a sudden something led me to read somewhere else and in in actually in second chronicles and and and I was like why am I going over here this is kind of throwing off where where I'm at and and I started reading for a couple of nights I kept reading there and and just you know kind of not uh uh not knowing what was going on but today um I was reading another in that same uh uh uh scripture a little lower and the Lord spoke to me today directly in that scripture and I can see how for a few days I've been reading there and it was just the Lord kind of just see uh guiding me to where he was going to speak to me because I truly believe that that's one of the ways that he speak to you is actually through his word and and and today it is he spoke to me directly to what I the answer that I was looking for I mean so directly that it almost kind of like like shook me a little bit but it but it didn't shake me because I I contained myself and I said you know this is what he promised that he would do this is exactly what he said that it would do and and we shouldn't be surprised but we should be grateful and we should be joyful and and and and receive it and today I I believe that that's what he gave to me as a gift a word from the Lord directly and and and a part of that scripture said that when when when uh uh uh uh uh uh a Affliction not afflictions when when when uh uh uh uh Trials come come to you if you stand in his house which is uh uh in his house in the name of the Lord he will hear you and he will help you paraphrasing what the scripture said but but the scripture directly spoke to my situation and I just so grateful for that and I think that that's probably one of the biggest thing that could happen to us is for the Lord to speak to us amen God bless you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] all amen amen it would be Rober to sit here and I say something about what God has done for me and my family appreciate my precious wife appreciate all y'all it's a wonderful thing uh God the Lord been good to us uh I guess about another hour and a half or so we been together for 64 years amen amen amen

oh God bless you uh just want to thank God for being here tonight definitely it's good to be back home um I was away for a couple days and of course when you're going away especially as a young woman you start to have fear um especially going to a new state that I'd never been to and you're hearing all these bad things about California so it was it was definitely uh I was definitely nervous going but I'm thankful to God that he kept us safe uh me and Jessica as we went and everything was fine um without a hitch um but I definitely want to thank him uh even today I um we get to the airport at 5:00 in the actually it's 4:00 in the morning and I don't know what was I I don't know what happened but we missed our flight um we were literally there and I don't know what was going on but we missed our flight and it was very stressful for both of us cuz I was like I had done it so early so I could get back home and get some rest before coming to church tonight but because it was missed I didn't end up Landing till about 6:40 in Fort laale so we had to drive up didn't get home till 8:00 but um I was I was very annoying um having to go through that but I had to thank God as well because you know in the last couple days all you hear in the news is about plane crashes and I was like you know what everything happens for a reason and I'm pretty sure the other plane didn't crash but it's like sometimes God wants you to stop and think and like I know what I'm doing stop worrying about it and so I was had to really thank God for that because I was like even though I was annoyed he knows everything that we go through and why we go through those things um so I just really want to thank him for that and I just want to thank him for this year it was definitely very stressful year for me um a lot of things that I kind of wanted to happen were just not falling into place the way I wanted and I just through it all I had to really just trust God and remember that everything is is in his timing and when the timing is right he will make it happen and so I had you know I wanted to actually go to school this year and I was like it just wasn't working out I don't know I don't know what I was doing really but it just didn't work out but I thank God that will be able to go next year and like I said pay for it um and and I just I'm thankful for that and I know that even like with my car that I have now that was not something I wanted at all I did not want a new car but God worked that out and even when I had my issue just a couple uh months ago with my transmission I was looking and I'm like there's no way I can pay for a transmission and I was just like you know I I can't I can't handle this and it I was very very upset but I just kept hearing God tell me you know like stop worrying stop worrying stop worrying and of course we're human so it's like no I'm going to worry anyway but um in the end in the end he really did take care of it I didn't have to pay a thing and it was like and I was like you know I was I was talking to the lady who did my hair and we were just talking about the goodness of God and I was like you know what like it just he just really goes to show all the time even for me it's like you continue to worry and you continue to stress over things and it's like I already told you I will take care of it even if you don't have the money there's still going to be money coming from somewhere even if you don't see you know a way through the valley like there's going to be a path made for you you just have to trust me and I honestly felt like what that's what God's message to me this year was learning to uh really have faith because you know the Bible is not just saying words it what it says is it's true you have to walk by faith and not by sight you have to walk in the spirit you have to do these things because without it you're not going to make it and so I just I thank God you know for his grace towards me this year cuz so I was a mess a lot and but I thank God that he really did help me sorry through this year and just brought me to the end and I I'm looking forward to next year you know sometimes you get a little scared you're like what is the next you're going to bring but I know whatever he takes us through is his love towards us and he will be with us even through if we have to go through some dark valleys he said that he'd be with us so I just thank God and I know that he'll give us great next year as well praise the Lord Brother Jim Hallelujah I'm sorry guys I really don't need a mic loud um but I truly thank God for being in the presence of God tonight um the devil really tried to um hinder me tonight but but I just that's just something just was wouldn't let me not just starting the Year this this is how I was raised and I was born um honestly I have a whole lot of testimonies I can give for the year and I could truly thank God cuz I always tell my friends I say friend you know even when I encourage them I always say you know what one thing about God he always let me fall but when it be it be on my knees um he never lets me fall to the ground I I I try to be as faithful as I can to him I'm not always in service no I'm not um honestly you guys truthfully I can just tell you the truth it's been my haircut um I love my church that much that it it bothers me bad you know I have alipa but that's that's nothing to do with it my mom goes crazy about it we talk about it a lot but it's really my haircut that I don't come to church as much as I should come but y'all forgive me for that cuz it has nothing to do with my faith one thing about me I love the Lord I I don't care who I'm in front of I care who I'm around I'm going to praise him that's me I I know how I was raised um I don't know how to say the ministry the 54 Ministry how we said it I love I have to I have to sometimes argue with my my friends even about the message and they say I'm in the C yeah say I'm in the cup but one thing about God he going to judge me on my cup you understand me so I don't I don't really worry about those type of things but I I love my church and I just want to share y'all little test on real quick so I can get out the way I've been looking for a job I've been struggling with a job back and forth um convicted felon it's just actually it been 20 years and I've been working for the school board for like 10 years honestly did a background check didn't have a problem got a job then I I start working for this this lady she's she cool lady now she like maybe 49 tough tough honestly I mean literally example of somebody I would want to be but um so now she they required she got into one of her employees and they inquired to her to do all these backgrounds and then we end up having to do background man you for these people 10 years when my background came back no no no I'm sorry y'all just give a testimony but when my background came back the job didn't didn't said I wasn't allowed to work for them no more and that really hurt my heart cuz I'm like God do my going to be 20 years old 20 years old the charges I'm like I've been working for these people 10 years now and you go get into it with somebody else and now it cause problem on me you know she didn't see it like that but you know Jamaican I forgive me for anybody for if you are and thinking I'm saying that but you know kind of whatever what it make a long story short I I I knew she lady fir me I called my momma my mama tell I made an announcement to everybody well M got fir Kan and next day she called me she's like you coming to work I said oh yeah I'm coming y' I'm coming and and and I've been there ever since I just I just thank God of just just the glory of of God because like I'm like key you through like what you going to do you know I've been studying for my insurance off and on finally y'all I'm finally being content to it I I've been really really studying for those who know my journey but either way to make a long story short don't give up amen one thing about God he is definitely there like you just got to be faithful to him you be faithful to him he gonna be faithful to you and I know it's probably saying oh you coming from you no no no no no I'm telling you you be faithful to him he's going to be faithful to you and that's all I got to say God bless y'all hallelujah hallelujah thank you Jesus God bless you Saints I think it'll be robbery if I didn't give God Praises um just uh picking back on when um brother Solomon had an issue with his the passport for his daughter and I just grabbed hold of Faith cuz I said Lord if you can do it for brother Solomon way over and I think Dubai and I was I requested for a prayer for a car and it didn't come right then but I had to keep the faith and you know the devil coming cuz when you uh sending out for a prayer request or anything you know he's coming he ain't going to stop coming he's going to keep coming and then sometime you have battles in your mind you know the word of God is real but you just still having mind battles cuz we still in this flesh here but I say God I just trust you that you're going to do this for me and God gave me a car and I want to I want to thank God even though a lot of other details haven't worked out for me with the car I still trust God for the process and um I think this is our first uh Night Watch service here I I believe it is yeah but um I've been on jobs where you can't come to can't come to church and you tied to the job just like they got their foot on your neck you can't do anything but just you got to keep going because you know you got to pay your bills right and I was in a dark place at Walmart overnight and I encourage anybody do not get a job overnight because it take from you from the presence of the Lord we know God to make a way but it has to be a it is a better way and uh you know just you just have to choose and pray and let God direct you cuz I look back over 15 years overnight it was a nightmare cuz I lost contact with God but when you get a hunger and a thirst and if God ever touch your life you going to start digging you going to start praying and that's what I did I had to take time I to go to the bathroom and pray on my way going home when I was off I prayed and God brought me so now I have another chapter in my life where my finances is not where it was but I have to trust God and I tell you this year I tell you we've been coming off of Faith cuz it it just been faith that we've been getting here Lord I'm not going in detail but I know it's God bringing us here by faith cuz when you look in your account there's nothing there you know it's God doing it and I have to testify God been doing it this year in 2024 and I thank God for Pastor Jack and his his wife and the whole body of Christ for the many blessings I can't tell you who all but it's not nobody's business but I know God been using different ones in the body to bless us and I want to give God praise uh last week on Christmas day um I have a neighbor that he had a stroke of a year ago and God pressed upon me to start just giving him a plate of food I didn't think n of it and cuz I family grew up we always help people so it wasn't no big deal to me so the Lord pressed upon me to help him and I got a knock on my door Christmas Day his daughter came and she asked my name and everything and I you know I was talking to her and everything she said I really appreciate you for helping my dad I can't give you a whole lot but here's something to help you I was blown away because you know sometime when you do things you not looking for nothing in return but you know sometime we think God have abandoned us he haven't been thinking about us cuz I get up early in the morning cuz I have more time to pray and I had more time to fast cuz when I was on the job I couldn't do any of that but now I have more time to do it and it blew me away I'm like God just thinking about me it it really touched me it really touched me cuz sometime you think God has left you even though you come to the building and fellowship sometime you just still feel like you out there by yourself and I tell you it's been a tough year and um you know I come here and I I try to just absorb the word as much as I can the devil's still coming yes he's still coming and I know you know the service has been going on different sermons and thing you know get back and step so I said Lord you help me get closer to you cuz sometime you feel like you're still distant even though you come you sometime you still feel like you distance and I said God you got you got to help me cuz this is personal yes God going to judge us individually but we come here as a whole but you know we have to take it personally I mean put your whole heart and mind and soul into when you come here yes cuz it's so important cuz once you leave out the devil's still coming that's right I don't care how much you have in the natural and sometime things that you wasn't struggling with but sometime things happen that you do have a struggle with at the present time and I said Lord I can't give up you have to encourage yourself and I've been encouraging myself and a lot of times I fail at it too but I say no I can't quit cuz God has brought me too far he has brought me too far to give up and pastor Pastor Jack said write everything down that you need God to do I said God I need you to do everything everything I just tell God I need you to fix everything cuz I can't fix nothing when I tell you we've been coming on faith it's been nothing but Faith this year in 2024 but I look for God to open The Impossible doors I say bigger doors because I want to take them flight to London wherever the Saints are going I am going I'm going by faith I am going by faith and I speak it into existance I don't care what the devil doing I say I'm walking by faith in 2025 H Hallelujah either you prophesy or Tes Hallelujah well thank you Lord I was going to say some anything but sister zma and everyone else and even Aisha was saying about trusting God and um a few months ago I had an interview here um in Palm uh Palm Beach downtown and out of a hundred people I was two of the hundred that was um Chosen and um the fourth interview when I went um I just had such a funny feeling like almost like you know I prayed I said Lord if this is for me you will open the door so while I was sitting there I was just going to meet the head bosses and um just to introduce myself so while I was sitting there um they came an a person and I looked like a woman dressed like a woman everything looked like a woman and while the person was sitting there with a coworker the person started speaking and it was a male so I'm sitting there and I was like oh and here comes the boss that hired me already for this job and he said hey Naomi and he was just giving me tips and tell me this is just an introduction to the two people the main people that's over the whole place and I was like okay and I just still didn't feel right and as he was talking to me he introduced himself to the two people that were sitting there and uh I just like oh my gosh this is not going to be good so anyway so while I was going in my uh my third interview well it's a fourth interview but it was two 15 minute interviews um the lady was telling me well you know you have to participate in all these things like um everything you have have to participate in this like a and I sat there I said oh okay and I sat there and I was like no this is just not for me but I didn't say anything well a couple days later I just didn't feel right the money was good it was what I wanted and they sponsor you with everything they even told me Naomi if you need clothes there's a store downstairs we pay for everything you could pick up what you want and everything and they were just so excited we all were excited there supposed to send me an offer letter that Friday cuz I got the job and then 2 days or 3 days went by and I contacted the lady I said what happened I didn't get my offer she said oh we decided to move on with the different person I was like oh thank you cuz it looked good it sound good and everything was just good so I was like oh thank you and then I just got a little discouraged and I was like Lord we've been trying to move here and the door seem to open up and then it just shuts and it opens up and then it just shuts so I laid that Friday I was just laying Thursday cuz brother Jack mentioned something sometimes we ask God for things and we just we don't wait for God to answer back so I sat there and I was just like I woke up at like 3:00 in the morning and I was like all right Lord you got to have to tell us what to do cuz Solomon was like I'm just going to stay here you know he was just giving up and everything so I was like no I was like Noom mm I'm not giving up that easily we've been doing this for 10 years I I'm I'm not giving up this easy so I was just laying there and um I fell asleep at the Thursday I fell asleep Lord didn't say nothing I said okay well so I did I woke up again at 3:00 a.m. Friday morning and I just sat there and I said Lord what do you want us to do what do you want want me to do is there something that it's not right what you want us to do and I could clearly hear like I heard it say believe and I sat there I said Lord I don't believe I said I'm believing and then the Sunday on our way to church I told someone what happened that Friday Sunday went on our way to church we was listening to brother whisper preaching and brother wper said sometimes we ask God Lord what it what is it that you want us to do he said all God wants you to do is just believe and I said that's a confirmation so I'm resting on that and I'm resting on this scripture right here uh it was Mark 10:29 and Jesus answered and said verily I say unto you there is no man that had left house or Brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my sake and the gospel but he shall receive a h hundredfold now in this time houses and Brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands with persecution in the world to come Eternal so I said I'm resting on that CU God gave me brothers and sisters and family here so I'm just waiting for my land 2025 [Applause] God bless you um so sorry I'm like standing up in front of people okay um God bless um so I um in 2022 I think I um no sorry when was the first Camp yeah 2022 so I went to the camp I uh I enjoyed myself and um every I hope everyone has enjoyed thems um and I came back from the camp and I actually had an experience at the camp um and I went up to the altar nobody else was up there so I was like not going up there there's nobody there so instead I was like okay I'm just going to go up anyways so I went up and brother Jason Watkins came up and he's like well what are you why are you coming up sister and I told him I I want to receive the Holy Spirit and he he said okay we'll start praying and he said well lift your hands and I was like oh okay so I lifted my hands and he started praying and um he said don't leave until you feel like you've got it I was like okay so I didn't feel like I got it but I still left um and um I just kept he kept saying that to keep saying it until I felt like I got it so I kept saying well I have it so I went to tell poppy well my Dad sorry I went to go tell my dad and he was he just starts crying I'm like okay what are the Waterworks for um why crying and he's like he's just he said he was happy so then I say about 3 days after I came back I had started feeling I was like okay well that camp was nothing I started getting mind battles left and right and um started feeling like I didn't need to be here why am I he like I kind of don't want to do this be Christian why there's so many better things better and in 2023 um I was still having the same thing but instead it was getting stronger so instead of it being on the inside it was coming out on the outside and I started doing things that Christians don't do and even through all of what I was doing um I couldn't see any way out or I couldn't see God in any of it and I still felt like you like a glimpse like I could see a glimpse of me still serving God like I would have a dream of me serving God and I would have a dream of me in a box and dark and I try to climb out of the box and I couldn't get out so then in 20 this year it kept going and I um it started getting even worse um but I I tried to keep like a smile and I tried to L it and lo lock everyone out kind of just keep it insulated in myself but it it at that I would I it was kind of difficult and I was crying and I want I don't want to say depress cuz I don't I don't want but yeah I kind of was and I kept feeling like that and I got to the point I was like I went outside and I would walk around the yard and I was just like okay I was crying and nobody was there and I would look into the it was like Sunset and I I looked into the sky and I was like if you're there if you're God then where are you cuz I feel nothing and I walked back inside and lad's like yo what's wrong with you and I'm like you don't want to talk to me right now and we I heard the concert was going on so uh we decided to go to the concert and um brother tumba and brother Joe they started singing he won't fail I've seen it with my own eyes and and that song it it was kind of like boom so he was like ever since you were seven things happened and I still brought things to come to pass you lost something and I brought it and from and I cuz a lot of things from my mom and all that stuff um but I lost it and he brought it back and he gave me more he gave me three brothers and um so I kept singing that song and I got to the point I was just like okay I give up I give up I'm done fighting cuz um really I was fighting to stay out and I was rather thinking maybe I should fight to stay in so am I wasn't able I was able to write songs not during the two years of all that going on from the 3 days after the camp when I was in 2022 the songw writing I write songs but I the songw writing completely stopped I couldn't make a Melody I couldn't think of words I couldn't even if I try to push it I couldn't and in 20 after that day at the concert 3 days after the song Victory no the song I wrote a song and it's called I lost a lot but he gave me more I I couldn't stand on my own um but he gave me his Rock took to told Satan to resign and told me be mine so that that's the first song and then week later I get another song two weeks past I get another song so I just I just wanted to thank God for restoring my gift and restoring me [Applause] back hallelujah amen amen God bless everybody I just want to give a short testimony had been on us um on this job for quite some time that I really wasn't happy with and I Y I got a call from um sister Candice and asked me that I want to come and work for her I'm like yeah yeah I do you know so um during the process of doing application and interview I still had to wait um

I'm ready to get out of this job so she called me and said okay let's get the process going and whatever you can have the job it was it's a job that I didn't think that I can do because I always just been a secretary but the job I got is actually assistant Club director so you know so and she told me uh right before we went on the Christmas break to give her some time you know a couple weeks they going to she want to actually move me up to a director so just praying for it Jesus thank you Lord thank you Lord praise the Lord amen Jesus amen I'll give a little short testimony brother Jimmy come on okay so 2024 has probably been the worst year of my whole entire life um but um since I was like probably like 14 I did struggle with depression for a very long time so throughout the year I was just very like discouraged very low I guess and um I was just like it kind of piggyback so Abby was saying like God are you real like are you you really here do you like really care about me like why am I why am I here like am I I just felt like I'm just just here for no reason basically so um I didn't talk to brother Jack about it he did encourage me or whatever and then a couple weeks later maybe a couple weeks later the interpretation comes and Sh we sng the song be still and know that I am God and then interpretation comes and I was like just asking God like just speak to me like let me know that you're actually a real thing and the interpretation comes and he says um I am God um hearken unto me something like that and I will speak and I was just like that was my conf confirmation that like okay God is real like you care about me enough like you heard my bir like right before that we was listening to brother Naidu service and he was just basically like why are you coming to church what like he was saying in his Ser why are you even coming to church and in my heart I was like to hear God speak and then right then the same service or that same day God came down and spoke directly to me I don't know what y but to me so yeah praise the Lord hallu amen he is a real God Amen my wife actually stole my thunder script that she read was was my testimony and the Lord did something marvelous for me uh the day after the concert you know when he just showed me that scripture how he was bringing that to pass and little by little he was just giving me things when I got ready to move from Florida to South Carolina I I didn't know all of you were here not until the day before I left when everyone was over in okobe that was when I met all of you but all of my stuff was headed to South Carolina but that's why I left I left my father my mother my brothers my sisters different things the Lord he he pulled me out of a group with my brothers I have one older brother and two younger brothers and he took me to South Carolina and I was there alone for 7even years I went empty but I came back full he gave me a wife he gave me children and as I was standing at the end of the service singing with brother Jack and brother Larry brother Joe I looked out and that scripture came to my mind I'll give you fathers mothers sisters brothers the entire congregation I was looking at and then I I started thinking while we were singing I looked over and I looked at brother Jack and it it just hit me it hit me hard and I was like my I used to stand on the stage with my brothers now I have one older brother and two younger brothers standing on the stage doing with me here what I was doing in the world with for Satan and that scripture just hit me and I was like Lord you've given me fathers mothers sisters brothers where's my houses and lands so I'm expecting that in 2025 [Applause] God has really been good to us all and just listening to the testimonies God is a god of paradoxes and see what the Lord Has Done amen will you stand to your feet praise the Lord we're going to get our pastor out here I know he's he was itching to preach amen let's sing uh oh my the atmosphere just shifted so uh let's just sing you made a way you made a away invite brother Jack brother Jack to come in this time you you made a way come on say you made a way you you made our way

time you made a [Music] way you standing this only because you made come on give the Lord a hand of [Music] Praise amen um on I got a a a text message a little earlier that um sister Virginia and sister Ashley were on their way to church tonight and somebody hit them from the back um and um um the uh whoever the driver was of the other car took off and left the scene because um she thinks that they were drunk so um sister Ashley had to go to the hospital and and um and they're just doing some some observations so we want to have a word of prayer uh on behalf of our sister and um you know we just thank God I appreciate all the testimonies I know that uh even on Sunday night after we left church uh somebody hit sister Bernice uh on the way home too but she walked out of that situation and she's in the house of the Lord tonight and you know just um as my mother-in-law was just sharing there just a accident that that could have happened at our home could have been much worse uh a different story tonight but I thank God for his promise the promise says the angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear Him and deliver them from all their troubles amen so we thank God for his delivering power Amen in all these situations that could have been another way but God is faithful amen praise the Lord uh musicians thank y'all so much amen for your uh service on tonight uh I'm going to read one scripture and after I read that scripture we will uh have a word of prayer for sister Ashley and uh just pray over the word I was just sitting back there thinking said man the way the testimonies are going I really don't need to preach y'all y'all y'all y'all just bless my heart uh with um uh with What the Lord Has Done and you know I'm so glad that y'all got up and said it because sometimes um we forget what God has done in our midst we we I mean months go by and we forget that God did that so it was a a really good trip down memory lane amen uh on on tonight um we started the year off with a scripture and we going to end the year with the same scripture um and I'm I'm only going to read from Joel 2 uh tonight usually we you read Joel 1:4 but uh Joel 2 is um starting here at verse 23 and we'll just read this uh quickly uh says be glad then ye children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for you have given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floors shall be full of Wheat and the fats shall overflow with wine and uh oil and I will restore to you the years that the Loc have eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you and I heard many of you all talking about how the devil just um tried to make this year the worst year of your life and uh if you would kind of connect your story with joel4 you'll understand what the devil was doing however Satan don't have the last word and uh God promises that everything that the devil took from you he going to give it back amen that's what I will restore to you saith the Lord so uh God's made a promise and we going to stand there until the promise is made manifest amen let's let's uh have a word of prayer father we come in the name of Jesus uh first thanking you for Lord all the beautiful testimonies that have gone forth here and I know if time uh permitted others would have things to share but uh God we just thank you for your this year that you have provided that you have protected that you have directed that you have opened do we couldn't see Lord you have done the exceeding the Abundant above all we can ask a thing and uh we are a Greatful people uh for what we have experienced and father uh so sister Virginia sister Ashley on their way to church tonight and that devil uh attacks them uh with a drunk driver and Lord we we know Sister Ashley is uh experiencing some complications but uh since we have authority uh as Sons and Daughters of God we adure you Satan in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we command you to loose our sister let her go May her body return back to a normal State father and uh Satan we in between her and every symptom we place the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ believing that he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace is upon Christ and with his stripes we declare healing over her body Lord we thank you for watching over sister sister Bernice the other night and and and and Lord the little accident that could have occurred today at our house God we thank you for watching over and your angels encamp round about us because we fear you and You Deliver Us from all of our troubles so God we thank you that you are a shield Lord that you keep us father from the hands of the enemy you've done it thus far and we know you'll continue to do it thank you for every testimony that went forth here tonight our hearts are uplifted and encouraged and Lord we just believe that if you did it this year you'll do the same next year whatever it is that we have need of God you will do it so we commit it all into your hands it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you praise the Lord you can be seated amen I uh I won't uh stand before you uh too long uh tonight but uh I did have just a little something in my heart that I wanted to share amen uh with with with the church the a few weeks ago we were standing here and we were reading this scripture out of Joel chapter 2 and you know the the theme for the year has been get back in step and uh typically what I do uh is I I try to you know find what the will of the Lord is for us for the next year and what is the theme that God wants us to have for the next year like two years ago uh well one year you all remember we talked about replication that was the word that God gave us and God did that uh and then you know brother Simba was just talking about how uh the Lord had given us uh uh the last year uh yielding to the perfect will of God and uh and how you know the Lord just kind of blessed I was so happy that he shared his testimony with you all because uh I noticed after he yielded how God just opened up doors amen and and it's something about being obedient uh to the Lord that releases blessings Amen in our Direction uh but you know this year the Lord had given us uh get back in step and um and then the inspiration of I will restore sayith the Lord so I was praying and seeking the Lord about Lord what will happen for next year what is it that you want us to um uh what's going to be our theme and I just could not get a release uh from where we were because I knew I still had sermons still connected to that theme so when when I saw that I said okay Lord I'm just going to yield to that and not not be so concerned about trying to find something new but just keep moving on with what God had already given us until we until we get it to an end and um so you know with that uh being said what I was feeling amen is that uh next year would be what we call an overlap year and um so there's things that that lap over and I mean they go from this year and they lap over until next into the next year and I was looking for different words to uh kind of Express that overlap and uh one of the words that came to me amen was overflow so um when I start thinking about overflow and and I don't I don't like to just give words and not necessarily be able to put it back in scripture appreciate brother hose's testimony that he was reading the word of God and God spoke to him in the word right that you'll always hear his voice when you read his word right so uh you know what you're standing on when you when you got scripture so you know I was like well Lord you I feel like you overlap overflow I feel like you're putting this in my in my in my spirit but I just don't know um you know how am I going to tie this in so I was standing in the pull pit a few weeks ago reading Joel 2 and and I said to y'all oh my goodness it's right here I've been reading it the entire year and missing it and and there in verse 24 it said and the floors shall be full of Wheat and the fats shall amen shall overflow with wine and oil now before I go too far the title of the sermon tonight and this is a declaration and uh it is it's you can you can receive it for self or you can just let it be another title but the title tonight is year of overflow Hallelujah yes sir year of overflow praise the name of the Lord amen and we write in the scripture because Joel prophesied that uh the the floor shall be full of Wheat and the fat shall overflow and the reason that we had to go into the next year with the same theme because God wants us to experience Hallelujah [Music] somebody oh blessed be the name of the Lord now I I have to take my time and just kind of break down a couple things for you uh so that you understand this this you know there there's churches today um tonight that a meeting and and somebody else probably got the same them you know about overflow and you know and and and and everybody look at it from uh maybe just the the the natural blessings but when we talk about what Joel prophesied now Joel prophesied about wine and oil yes sir Hallelujah so you need to understand that first come on because the natural will type the spiritual so let's let's understand the spiritual aspect first and then we're going to move into the natural is that all right so let's understand what this uh this this this this oil is um and and I was looking in the Hebrew lexicon just the word uh overflow there it means um the the the Hebrew word is s h u w k s h u w k that's the Hebrew word now if you ask me what does that how does that sound uh that they give me what it sounds like what does s hu w case sounds like and they say it sounds like [Music] shook Shook and what shook means is to be abundant to give abundance to uh to overflow that's what shook mean so if somebody say brother you shook hello sister you shook it means I'm walking in the Overflow praise the Lord glory to God Amen so here uh just a a quick definition so we can get this understanding of what uh what this overflow is all about the wine and the oil coming from the the sermon the fourth seal coming from that sermon um here we get a just a little glimpse of it it says now we left off uh let's just for a few moments review of that now he says then we left off on the power of the wine he says what the oil represented spirit so when we when we see amen an overflow of wine and oil the oil itself represents Spirit hallelujah amen so there's supposed to be an overflow the next year of the spirit Hallelujah and overflow my God that's something you can't contain hallu hello church I'm under expectation for overflow something you can not contain Lord amen he say he he goes on and says um uh the oil represented spirit I guess you all got it all down you'll find it on tape if you didn't and where to find the scriptures that the oil always symbolizes the Holy Spirit like the foolish virgins with no oil wise virgins with oil whiches the Holy Spirit and then on back in the prophets and so forth uh he says now of course I don't try to pull out every scripture in there and there's things that you can't even even speak about it'll take too much time he says but I try to place out here with scriptures and so forth just enough to give the people so it'll let them know and see the picture of it he says but if you sat down with one of them seals why my you could take a month's sermon every every night right on the seal and still not even touch it see on one of them that's how much there is to it but I just hit the high spots of it then you can see what it's all about now let's keep going it says now as oil symbolize the Holy Spirit we find out that oil and wine is connected in worship oil and wine is connected in worship see always connected in worship my God he says in the wine I said which come to me that the wine symbolizes that it was the power or it was the power of stimulation by Revelation oh this is so important right because see when the when when there's an overflow of wine that means there's an overflow of Revelation that's coming questions that you might have had God is going to send you the answer there's an overflow of wine coming your way than you Hallelujah and when you when you find the Holy Spirit vindicating amen the wine then you know you're in the right place at the right time amen when the Holy Spirit vindicates the Revelation and gives you stimulation on Revelation here here you know even just the the title tonight year of overflow there's a revelation that strikes your heart because like Lord you speaking that over me you speaking that over my situation you speaking that over my circumstance somebody say I come to get a word from the Lord that's exactly what God want to give you that's right amen but you got to be able to catch what he's speaking to you yes sir Hallelujah watch it now let's let's go he says always connected in worship and and the wine said I said which come to me that the wine symbolizes that it was the power of stim stimulation by Revelation see and that's when something has been revealed it gives stimulation to the believer because it's presented by Revelation I like that yes sir I was listening to sister ke's uh testimony in somebody said well you you in the cult she said God going to have to judge me by the cult that I'm in that was a revelation yes right amen that is a revelation that God gave her she can stand on her own two feet no matter what nobody else say God going have to judge me by my cult brother that is powerful hallu that's powerful amen amen L he said he says it gives stimulation to the believer because is presented by Revelation stimulation comes from Revelation so even as we as we go through this tonight amen there'll be some things that'll be brought out but but it's going to have you're going to have to catch it by Revelation and then when you catch the Revelation it gives you stimulation yes siren come on now you know in the natural when people get stimulated by wine they act a little different yes sir they talk different they walk different right because of the stimulation they they even think different because of the stimulation same thing it should be in the spiritual Hallelujah on the on the day of Pentecost when they were stimulated praise God because when the Holy Spirit came down was manifest in the scripture right before the very midst he said this is that which the prophet Joel spake about they were all stimulated by what God had done in their midst and I like what the Bible say the bible say that all them were fed yes sir come on I mean not just some of them but everybody that was sitting in that Upper Room everybody got something from God everybody got some stimulation and I'm believing praise God that that's the type of year we're going to have you might come here one way but you're going to leave here another way because of the Overflow of the wine and the oil you can't stop God's promise from being made manifest we know where we standing at am this is the year I ain't talking about a season I'm declaring the whole year as a year of overflow from the first of the of January to the the 31st of December I'm receiving overflow overflow in the spirit and in the natural thank you Lord thank you Lord it gives stimulation to the believer every when y'all when y'all amen and and glory to God and all that what you doing you operating under the stimulation yes sir truth that that you're operating under the stimulation amen praise God watch it said it was a it says uh uh when something has been revealed it gives stimulation to the believer because it's presented by Revelation right it says see it's something that God has said it's a mystery they can't understand it and then after a while after a while God comes down and reveals it and then vindicates it praise the Lord hallelujah right amen uh sister D's testimony she had she had the question is Lord are you real speak to me and she happened to be sitting right there next to her mama praying that prayer and her mama takes off in an unknown tongue Lord now Sister D didn't know what what was being said none of us knew what was being said glory to God amen but but as we waited on the Lord Brother brother Jerry didn't share the whole testimony with y'all but he said it came to him in his ear he heard what God was saying he heard the interpretation but as he waited on the Lord all of a sudden it went from just a voice to actually a vision and when they went to Vision he just began to read what he was seeing Hallelujah yes sir and when he read what he was seeing it was an answer to the prayer up front yes oh my god oh let me just keep I you know I I want to kind of say like this we are church that believe in all the gifts but they have to be in order right amen oh let me just share this testimony because I'm I'm I'm I I I would almost forgot about it praise the Lord for the the opportunity to go to Philippines and and and when I went there to the Philippines I I um I've been taking everywhere everywhere I go uh this this year that I preach I I preach um get back and step at least once at least once they didn't get the full 15p part sermon that y'all getting and I I'm I'm on my way to 16 but they got the first one and uh so I I I I preached it that morning and then uh you know Wonderful atmosphere and then brother Diggs came in the afternoon Service uh and he preached you know that afternoon service and and as he was preaching you know Holy Spirit still moving you know amongst the people and um uh at the end of his at the end of his sermon he kind of felt led to have like an altar call and not necessarily calling people up but just maybe in your chair you know just kind of dealing with them in their situations and as he was just kind of working all of a sudden the Holy Spirit came down upon a sister and uh and she began to speak in tongues now when I say things got to be in order that's what I mean the preaching had already gone forth right you don't interrupt the preacher while they preaching right because the scripture tells us that the spirit of the prophets is subject to the prophets we got to keep things in the word yes sir right so so so so this sister she she she she went she she actually uh spoke in tongues and then she interpreted her own tongues because the scripture also tells us that if you speak in tongues in public you pray that God gives you the interpretation so it's just not chaos amen and um and I remember telling the church that you know when we're in public now it's one thing when you're in private it it's a different it's a whole different story but when you're in public there's a way that God establishes for us to do these things and it's and and one of the things that Paul taught us says if the if if tongues go forth in the church he says Let It Be by two or at most three that's the Bible yes sir right so so so so here I am standing there in the Philippines and and this sister breaks out in tongues and she interp and all of a sudden after she finished another sister breaks out in tongues and then that sister interprets her tongues so I'm just kind of looking now Hallelujah I'm in the spirit but I'm watching too yes sir right so so so next thing you know amen I watched I watched I watch I said cuz I know what the scripture tell us now two or at most three so here here I said now if it's a third one then I know it'll stop right there but no God stopped at the two and the pastor went up and took the mic and just kind of carried on the service when I saw that I said they right on the word sir Hallelujah I say they right on the word I said this is exactly what we've been teaching the church and and I saw it manifested in the Philippines prise Lord you think God is just the god of the Philippines no God is God in West Palm Beach and if we've established things by the word we're going to see God manifest himself by the word exactly right brother let me go on a little further with this now he says he says uh it gives stimulation to the believer because it's presented by Revelation he says it gives stimulation uh he says it's something that God has said it's a mystery they can't understand it see and after a while God comes down and reveals it and then vindicates it watch it says remember the truth is revealed here's the first thing the truth is revealed the truth is also Vindicated God constantly no matter how smart the person might be how Brant he might be in his mind if God don't back up what he's saying there's something wrong and and I just wanted to pause real quickly on that I I heard tonight through your testimonies how God backed up the thing of get back in step and I will restore sayth the Lord I heard that in your testimonies that God backed up that thing for this year yes he and let me just and now am I the only one heard that okay so if God backed up that theme this year he's going to back up this little inspiration Hallelujah that I'm giving you tonight to go into next year he's going to back up year of the Overflow yes sir I believe it hallelujah amen oh my God my God my God he said that's right cuz that's the word cuz it's the word now now I'm going to uh uh move down to paragraph 64 on that but I want just mentioned just a couple things that the Lord did you know uh in this restoration year Sunday school is restored uh communion was restored feet washing was restored Souls were restored am I and when I when I heard sister aby's testimony she was a confirmation but i' had already been looking at some others that I that I know I know they were part of the restoration they have to testify God testify for him Hallelujah from the beginning of the year all the way to now you you are the restoration praise the Lord amen spiritual gifts was restored yes sir finances restored Health was restored y'all heard sister Tanya's testimony Health was restored sister sister uh cap was at going through a few things at the at the end of uh the year before but look at how God restored her and and she come right on up in here every time she could come on somebody we saw restoration all around us yes sir brother God backed up what he what he put us under and and if he's allowing us to overflow into it I don't you your expectations are to rise right yes sir let me just let me just read this one out of this and I want to I want to change gears here really quick and and it says in paragraph 64 the power of Revelation brings stimulation to the believer it says for the power of wine natural wine is to stimulate is to bring a person that's all slumped down to stimulation and and and and you know and sometimes in your spirit you can get slumped down but what God want want you to understand that he's going to bring stimulation of Revelation to pull you out of your your your your your slump amen amen am amen he says this he says well then now there's a power revelation of the word give stimulation of Joy to the believer stimulation of satisfaction stimulation that is Vindicated it's proved it's called in the scripture as we want to refer to it as new wine Hallelujah all right it says we all always refer to it like that these are drunk on new wine all right or spiritual wine I think is the best interpretation we would uh would be on spiritual wine now as um as we understand that this this this oil and wine oil typifying the spirit the wine stimulation of Revelation this is what will be an overflow for this next year I I'm declaring that it's going to be an overflow but it's not just a overflow of just the spiritual things let me just read a a a quote out of a prayer line and and I'm going I'm going to set you up uh for something else here uh Jehovah Gyra is where I want to read from so just stay with with me I'm I'm giving you laying this foundation so that we can lay some scripture in for you and uh and help you see where you where we're where we're standing this message on this overflow is something that I've had tucked away in my in my notes for a while and I was waiting on the right time to release it and the only time when I saw God taking us into this next year with the same thing that's when I knew this was time to release it praise God so as we're going into this next year we're going in with an expectation but I want you to catch something here out of this message I'm turning a corner out of Jehovah gy says now this is this is a prayer line he says now it's making me weak of course you could see it and even this cold night and the pers perspiration running from my hand it says it's his presence Visions Jesus said I perceive virtue is gone not from not from the God that was in him but from his physical body the Son of God who he was that's the same thing here it just makes you real weak it's Visions he says if you have faith and can believe with all your heart while you can receive what you ask for if you have faith amen and believe with all your heart you can receive what you ask for I believe sister s s s sister Z say I'm going to London amen I'm getting a passport I'm going to London Hallelujah my God and and and I tell you with faith like that going to push everybody out there to London we we we ought to ask God for big things yes sir the same God that can take you to Orlando can take you to London he say he say he says if you have faith and believe with all your heart you can receive what you ask for now Sister maybe I can talk to you just a little do you believe me to be a servant the servant of the Lord Jesus you know that there's nothing in your in your brother could do anything for you to help you to heal you if you're sick but um but you know believe me that I am his servant that I'm only trying to come here because he spoke to me and told me to come and he be with me and do these things just like you see there in the audience now listen to this he says now you know that I don't know you I know nothing of you but God knows all about you he said he says doesn't it says well if he can tell me here what you're here for then will you believe him with all your heart it says will and will accept whatever whatever you're whatever you're here for now the latest stand there in the prayer line brother brandom hasn't discerned yet the Holy Spirit hasn't told him what she's there for but he says it's a possibility that you could be standing in the prayer line for finances it's a possibility sister I don't know what you're going through but it's a possibility that you come to this prayer line because you need finances now why would the prophet say that because God's concerned about your finances oh my my my my we're going somewhere now God is actually concerned about your Finance the same way God is concerned about your health he's concerned about your finances it says you could be here uh you're here for whether it's finances or whether it's a spiritual troubles or whatever it is you will accept it now may he Grant it is my sincere prayer now now now now and I'm like well now uh um let's just kind of look at a few things here in scripture you as it pertains pertains this because we call this the year of overflow give me Luke 638 give me Luke 638 this part of overflow yes sir here's a promise that I want to read of you as you're going in leaving one year and going into the next year some of y'all talked about this already tonight about how you you you you you you're you you you're blessed in the way that you can give to people you give of your time you give it this well look at what the Bible say about that give and it shall be given unto you now now when now now you didn't give this way but when it's given back to you watch the way it's given to you good measure press down [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] shook press down shaking together and running over that running over right there's an overflow Hallelujah running over shall men give into your bosom for with the same measure that you meet with all it shall be measured to you again this is a promise in the scripture for an overflow yes it is brother amen hallelujah let me go on a little further here because this is you know I I I um I got a a a couple things there's a scripture that I want to make mention of and I'll I'll just kind of you'll find it in Second Kings but I won't I won't read it I won't read it uh you can you'll go back and you read 2 Kings 4: 1-7 you can read it but but what happened here there was a a woman that came to the prophet Elisha she was in a a an indebted situation I mean thatb was probably piled up to here and uh this lady really didn't know how to get out of this situation that she was in Hallelujah glory to God and uh so she goes to the prophet Elisha and Elisha says you know um what kind of U uh containers you have in the house get as many containers as you got you know and and then and and and and and you know and after you get all the containers out of your house then go borrow some containers from some of your your neighbors and that lady went and got all these containers he said okay I got the containers he says now what I want you to do is go and and fill those containers with oil praise God Amen with oil amen fill all those those vessels amen he said and he told he said don't just borrow a few containers borrow as many as you possibly can yes sir Hallelujah said and fill them with oil and so so they went and you know and as her and her boys because being that she was in debt the creditors was coming to take her boys from her sir Hallelujah the devil don't try the devil trying to take your family from you that Devil's a liar is right but but here say say no no just take your boys y'all fill up all these containers with oil and they got all the oil in the containers and and she said okay give me another container I said she said they say mama that's it we ain't got no more says okay so they went to the prophet says okay we got all these say us f with the oil what should we do oh my my my my my my let me read this one for you cuz I I want the scripture to to come alive to you amen amen verse uh uh verse six verse 6 in 2 Kings chapter uh 4 verse 6 says and it came to pass Glory when the vessels were full Hallelujah that she said unto her son bring me at a vessel and it said unto her there is not not a vessel more and the oil stayed watch this now says then she came and told the man of God and he said go sell the oil and pay thy debt and live thou and thy children off the rest sir now the prophet already knew that this lady was going to get more than just the debt paid off amen this lady was going into a season of overflow there was a time where she was lacking and maybe this year was a year that you went lacking but by faith I am speaking over the congregation last year was a year of lack but this year a year of overflow hallelujah hallelujah am amen let's read another one out of the scripture amen and and and let me tell you something God is concerned about these areas of your life he was concerned about it for this this woman and and she's not no one off in the scripture God got others that he wanted to bless so I I I'm looking for God to do things spiritually it's already in happen I know there's more to come but I'm talking about now naturally and let me tell you something it it it's only yours if you want it that's right that's right amen it's only yours if you want it amen and and sometimes you know I know uh when you when you Minister like this you know some sometimes oh okay that's another Faith sermon okay for you it's just another Faith sermon and when you start hearing other people their testimonies coming back in here talk about brother I heard the Lord say it was an overflow for me and and this is what I got yes sir yes sir praise the Lord can I tell you something I I'm getting I'm getting ready to share a scripture out of out of Luke 5 overflow for your business amen amen I I I and I and I I like the scripture that sister Naomi uh uh say she holding on to cuz it said uh houses yes sir yes sir oh y'all didn't catch that one some of yall happy just having a house that's fine but the scripture actually said amen we got to stop limiting God right brother amen let's take him at his word amen oh y'all y'all don't believe you can have a couple houses sir you don't believe you can have it I had it once before come on yeah I had two getting rent for one of them I did and that was during that was during the time where um the I mean the the economy was really bad hello sir somebody you can walk on water in the midst of a storm [Music] sir no you don't get it you ain't got to wait for the water to calm down that's right it's storm conditions you can walk while the storm is happening cuz that's what Peter did yes he did amen praise God all right here's your here's your script scripture out of Luke 5 now I'm going to tell you something about the overflow Lord before you can experience it you got to learn how to obey that's that's it and I'm going to we going to read this out of Luke 5 because there was an overflow that happened here this the the the the the gist of this or the the the um the background is that Jesus was on the shore preaching this day and uh Peter was not a member of Jesus ch church but Peter wanted to you know he come from a situation if if I can put it this way he had a rough year in the past year he he he wasn't things wasn't just moving the way that he needed to move and he come to church that day and and when he got to church uh he was a little discouraged and uh and and the way that he approached the service according to what the the prophet tells us he sat there and he saidwell let's see what this this fell got to say I mean I you I mean it ain't it ain't might as well just hear my before I go home let me just see what this fell got to say so as as Jesus is there preaching uh all of a sudden the crowds just got greater and greater it was an overflow with the crowd crowd got greater and greater that it caused Jesus to have to ask Peter can I stand in your boat right and can I preach to the people from your boat well yeah I mean you know just a boat go ahead you can get in my boat not knowing Jesus had a plan after I dismissed this crowd I already know what you just went through last night I already know what you actually experienced last year but I'm getting ready to change the situation but you it's going to take a step of faith in order for you to get the Overflow right right right Amen Hallelujah to the Lamb of God now let's see what happens here in Luke 5 says uh and it came to pass that as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God he stood by the lake of jasarat and saw two ships standing by the lake but the fishermen were going out of them and were washing their Nets it says and he entered into one of the ships which was Simon's and prayed him that he would Thrust out a little from the land it says and he sat down and taught the people out of the ship he says now when he had left speaking he said unto Simon launch out into the deep and when you get there let down your nets for a drought Oh Glory to God I feel like telling somebody lunch out into the deep after the day and let down your nets get ready for the drought get ready for the Overflow get ready for it get prepared for it Hallelujah they already had the Nets ready to go right so now all I need to do is get get I mean launch out and then let's get ready now watch what Peter does kind of like what my my daughter was saying you know God tell them don't doubt don't this don't worry but I'm human I'm going to worry anyway and then God just say I told you I had it look at it he said and Simon answering said unto him Master we have toiled all the night or can I say we had a rough year Lord last year amen and have taken nothing oh my God my God but watch this now nevertheless I don't feel like doing this but nevertheless at Thy word I will let down the net now he didn't say let down the net for the drought he said I'm just going to let down the net but Jesus knew what he was speaking right it says and when they had this done they enclosed a great multitude of fishes and their net [Music] break and they beckon unto their Partners now here's the beautiful thing now you you know any y'all ever went fishing and um and you get a good fish on the line maybe you got your drag a little bit too tight and all of a sudden that fish done pop the line and and it's G you don't have that good fight I mean sometime you get a good bass you can just see them coming up out the water like boy I got my got myself a good one and get all the way to the end and that thing just pop and he just go swimming away it's it's one of the most deflating feelings that that you ever ever could have when you're going fishing the net but they still caught the fish yes sir hallelujah hallelujah if I can just put it this way when God has an overflow for you come on your nets can't stop it your unbelief can't stop it nothing you can do can stop God from manifesting in your on your behalf hallelujah amen like my daughter say to going to come from somewhere I'm just going to keep walking by faith right that's the truth and there there are seasons where we go through life where you know we barely getting by but when we get to the Overflow season now we're able to give to somebody else and let me tell you something you got to have the right the right approach the right amen the right uh uh uh mental approach when it comes when it comes to the Overflow you can be self fish with an overflow you can't just be thinking about yourself when you enter the season of overflow you got to think about how you going to bless God oh Hallelujah somebody I know what I'm talking about Hallelujah you got to think about the things that you can do for God for God's people listen listen listen don't let blessings just come to you and stop let blessings come through you not just to you am amen amen amen beautiful Simon and I'm sorry I'm verse uh verse verse six and when they when they had this done they enclosed a great multitude of fishes in their Nets break and they beckon unto their Partners which were in the other ship that they should come and help them and they came and feel both the ships look when I'm stepping the Overflow I don't want this just for me I want this to go for everybody in the church come get some of this amen and and you need to understand the reason I say now this was their way of living and providing for their family this was their business so if if the disciples could have their business blessed amen why not look for this in your business this year why have a business that's barely getting by the devil had you thinking to close your business no no no what but when I'm in the Overflow I hire people yes sir amen I'm not the only one blessed they get blessed as well yes sir amen that's what happens when we enter into an overflow you ought to be expecting to hire more people this year yeah other families would be blessed because of your business hey people ain't just got to work for Microsoft to be blessed they can work for you and be blessed yes amen hallelujah all right Hallelujah I'm receiving it for myself amen he says they begin to he says and it says and they should come and help them and they came and filled both the ships so that they Fe that they began to sink you talking about an overflow when Simon Peter saw it he fell down at Jesus knee saying depart from me for I'm a simple man remember his attitude was bad before the service started and now even with a bad attitude God has blessed them beyond measure let me just say it like this some of y'all sit here and you just look into one another faith sermon okay good good good faith sermon God going to override all of that and still give you a blessing you didn't even say Amen that night to the word god going to still give you something the Lord hallelujah and when he give it to you come act like Peter Lord I was sitting there criticizing I was in the seat of the scornful I I Lord that just went where my where my mind was Jesus Hallelujah but God will still give you something be like Peter look at Peter look at Peter had a bad attitude and everything but yet God blessed him and not not just a blessing drought overflow when Simon Peter saw it he fell down at jesus' knees saying depart from me I for I a sinful man oh Lord for he was astonished and all that were with him at the drought of the fishes which they had taken and so was also James and John the sons of Zebedee which were partners with Simon and Jesus said in Simon fear not and this here's the other part to the Overflow here's the other part now here y y'all ready for this one because God God God moved from the natural back to the spiritual and they got an overflow of fish in order to show what was going to happen spiritually now watch what happen spiritually he says fear not from hence forth Thou shalt catch men Souls so so when we talk about overflow we looking for overflow finances overflowing in the restoration of your health overflow in your business overflow in Souls amen amen amen overflow go everywhere amen amen my God my God and I like for it to go everywhere like this because some things I can't even think about where I want overflow like like like like sister sister say I don't even know what to ask for I just ask for everything God give me everything I like that that's I felt like writing that down and putting in my Bible everything things I can't even think about give it to me yes sir fear not from henceforth Thou shalt catch men and when they had brought their ships to land they forsook all and followed him you know um to me this is this is my promise for this year and I'm stepping into it you know the scripture said that we're going to overflow with wine and with oil and we know the oil represent the spirit the wine of stimulation Revelation but as I told you um God is interested in every area of your life so don't just limit him to just one area I I I'm talking about I'm looking for God to do overflow in everything everything I'm involved with I'm looking for it I'm a business owner I'm looking for it in my business here in the church we we concerned about souls I'm looking for Souls I'm looking for Restoration in some of y'all family I'm looking for it this year amen praise God I we we've saw it in health and and anybody get sick we were looking for restoration Health somebody's get I mean well I ain't going I'm not I'm not prophesying this but I I know somebody getting ready to get a new car I know that some of these accidents happened car new cars are coming out of that and when you see other people getting new cars you already know the Angels troubling the water that's right you ought to step in now hello now wait a minute now don't go out there and get a car that's way above your way above your budget don't do that now you done got into overflow of debt but just wait on God just to provide you sir and we heard we heard the scripture houses that means somebody going to get a house we saw it happen this year we had we had multiple testimonies people getting house sister Tina I sold a house and bought a house on the same day same hallelujah praise the Lord right amen we we we hear the testimony so don't just just be on expectation somebody's going to get a house Hallelujah see if I needed one I'd be like Lord that's me I'm I'm taking that one am C that's right I'm I'm I'm claiming that one that's mine that's right amen and don't let nobody tell you your age will limit you from having a house no God didn't God didn't put no age limit on thisen I know another thing that somebody going to get somebody going to get a church brother I'm talking about overflow praise God you see when everybody start uh saying amen that stimulation from Revelation that's what we mean by the Overflow Hallelujah I was just thinking on this you know and I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm winding down I told you I W going to preach too long amen preach us right into the new year but let me just sh you this to share this quick testimony um one time I was thinking about this overflow and then you know this this this this little testimony came back to me something that happened in brother Brandon's Ministry and um we know the scripture said that we'll overflow wine and oil but there was a time that was spiritual that was talking spiritual but there was a time in brother brandom's Ministry where he had told some brothers if you go to Kentucky you will find natural oil yes sir he said you'll find natural oil if you just go to Kentucky he says what happens that the brothers just they didn't want to take it you know they actually told the prophet said well tell us exactly where it is and then we'll go get it he said no no no God don't work like that God don't work that work like that it say God show me by Vision where it is now God could tell me exactly but why would I tell that to y'all so y'all can y'all Y y'all don't put no no no sweat into it right he say you when you walk in by faith you going to put some sweat into it right right so so he he say he said no just go to Kentucky brother y y'all you will find the oil he says so they were just kind of go go sporadically and when they would go sporadically they said they would get a little bit of oil and uh he says he says uh but the order they was getting was actually oil in the Overflow so you just catching the Overflow he said but there's a main spring yes sir that leaks into the Overflow and what you want to do is tap into the main spring because if you get into the main spring my brother you won't have to worry about money for the rest of your life so he told he told said so y'all need to go down there so so they there was very uh uh uh uh just not faithful in going down there so all of a sudden a company came in from Texas and start drilling in in in Kentucky when they saw this company drilling like we better get down there we better get down there and try to do something he said brother brand said they just got they they they got to a point where they they first said you know when when when I when when the Lord blessed me and said you you know what I'm going to be a blessing to this person and I'm going to be a blessing to that person I'm going to be a blessing to the church hello I'm going to be a blessing here but you know what but what happened is and here's the problem sometime you know you waiting on the million to be a blessing sometime God gave give you a hundred and he just want you to be a blessing with the 100 I I I'm a witness I mean right before the end of the end of the year I I I felt led to give somebody $500 here I just I just want you to have this I just want you to have this just just from us no problem you know just and not even thinking about getting it back that's another thing I heard that tonight when you bless somebody don't be don't be looking for God to come give it back to you right away don't God might give it back to you in other ways so don't don't look for it like that well Lord you told me to do it now I'm expecting don't don't you ain't you ain't got to make deals with God no sir I just gave the money not expecting anything and within about two weeks somebody had put a card on my hand and there was $1,000 giv back amen I gave 500 they gave me a th000 and then then I went about another week and somebody else put a card in my hand with another th000 in it I had just given 500 now I got 2,000 God know how to give now now now remember the scripture give and it shall be given unto you good measure press down shook yes sir shaking together running over shall men give unto your bosom that's what God promised in his word so how God manifest his promises up to himen but these brothers they they they they they they first said we going to do this we're going to do this for the kingdom of God we're going to do that but over time they got a little selfish and because they got selfish they actually never tapped into the mainspring that was causing the Overflow I'm grateful for the Overflow but where is the mainspring that causes the Overflow amen amen you said when those Brothers uh got all twisted up in their Spirits all of a sudden this company come in and with an 100 yards let's say they was drilling right here they were drilling right here and they touched they caught the Overflow but the main spring was at the back door and and the the other company come in to the main spring and still collecting from the oil probably to this day because they tapped to and brother brandom had already told him before that company came the oil is there yes sir you got to learn to be obedient if you want to experience an overflow flow you have to be obedient them brothers when they let down them Nets they got their overflow if you go drilling you might get some oil Hallelujah maybe maybe it's not might might not be drilling for you but it might be you know go ahead and apply for that loan I know they told you no before right amen go up now in the season or the year of overflow I want to say Happy New Year to yall happy New Year and walk in this year of [Music] overflow God gave it to you walk in this year of overflow claim it for yourself God this is my year and

to do is get multiple bank accounts in order to get insurance and their money this what I'm talking about room not enough to receive it I got to open up multiple bank accounts yes sir hallu that's what I call overflow all right that's me if you want to keep having one bank account and barely getting by that's you a I ain't putting no straw in your way but don't put one in my way either I'm I'm expecting and I'm walking in and I'm receiving the year of amen amen overflow I thank God I must read this over you this is coming out of Revelation chapter 4 part one says so how many is glad and happy the Lord spared you through another year the prophet says and here we are coming up to the end of the road and pray that God will forgive us of all of our sins and our shortcomings now I want to say this before I start I wish to each one of you all the most successful and blessful and healthy New Year that I can wish to you God be with you may you grow both physically and spiritually and financially and materially everything sister zma said it everything that God can bring upon you I pray that he'll do it amen and the scripture tell me that no good thing will he withhold from them that walk upright amen before him year of overflow year of [Applause] overflow let's have a word of prayer father first we want to thank you you brought us through another year you allowed us to enter into this new year we enter under inspiration and encouragement and strength to our faith to believe you God for overflow for that's what you have declared and we simply say Amen it's not us it's not up to us to try to bring these things to pass but it's up to us just to receive and to walk in and do the part that you have called us to do help us to have the right motive and objective in this upcoming year we don't want to be selfish with what you do for us blessings will flow through us help us to be sensitive to the voice of God in areas where we may need to give or to help somebody let us be sensitive to those needs God you wouldn't bless this bless us with it if you didn't have a purpose for us having it so Lord Jesus um we just pray Lord Jesus that as we would enter this year there's other saints that desire to be here tonight and we're not able to be here some streaming online we declare the same over them that are streaming those God that were not able to be here that this would be a time a year of overflow and God the most important overflow is that what happens spiritually Lord that every every time we come together that the spirit of God would be so welcome to move in this place that the glory of God would be manifested father we uh we trust that uh you would have the preeminence in this church and we we we've heard testimonies of others like I just shared on Sunday a church that that put on a meeting and and said you just get here and we'll take care of all the other expenses Lord what a church that's giv back to the kingdom of God and the people of God and Lord that that's that's the type of church that we can be Lord Jesus Lord we're we're we're not we're not going to limit you we're taking the limits off of you we don't we're not looking at uh God just even when it comes to a church we're not just looking at the price tag and and and doubting that it can happen father no you can do whatever you desire to do you can touch any heart that you want to touch and give us favor so Lord lead us and guide us and direct us to where you want us to be because this is the season we're declaring it by faith oh God this is the season of overflow father I pray that you bless the people you did it throughout the the previous year we we know that you'll do it again in the upcoming year so father we we thank you for this inspiration we thank you for your word we thank you for your truth we thank you oh God that we can hear your voice it's in Jesus name that we pray amen amen amen let's give the Lord a hand of Praise my god um I had a uh quick testimony one a brother called me and um they uh they were looking for a church and believing God that they would get a church they found a building they were asking about $900,000 for the building and the church didn't really have the money um only had maybe a couple hundred th000 but the people wanted 900,000 so they waited waited waited about a year and they said if we're going to offer them 850,000 and see if they'll take that but they didn't have the 850 so they said but we'll we'll still offer it they just sat and waited for a year and then um um recently I think in November they got a telephone call from the people that were selling the church and said hey uh just want to let you know that we we reduced the price of the church to 850,000 and uh and not only that the owner is willing to finance the whole thing uh if you all are interested and uh they say yeah yeah we interested we have meetings this weekend let us just get through the meetings and we'll come back and we'll talk to you all as soon as the meeting's over and we'll we'll we'll we we interested so they said okay okay we'll wait to y'all after y meeting so meetings pass people leave town and they get together to talk with uh with this real estate agent the owner and when they called the real estate agent the agent said the the owner just really tired of this property and ready to get rid of it so the owner said if somebody would give him $460,000 in cash he will sell the building to him right right right [Music] now the brother say uh we we we we interested we very interested he knew they didn't have the 460,000 he said we only got 200 but but we'll we'll we'll do it we'll figure out a way we'll figure out a way well while they were um you know trying to prepare things somebody in the church had a friend that was was very wealthy not even a believer and they happened to tell the friend what the church was going through and the friend said I'm going to give the church 300,000 and they can pay me back on we'll set up some turns for them to pay me back but I'm going to give them the 300,000 got the 300 added to the money they had went and paid for the church in cash [Music] this this just happened last month so the brother called me and he said I just had to tell you brother Jack the testimony because um um I just want to encourage your faith and I say that's the way I want it I want I want it to be a testimony from God that supernaturally God did something that could nobody else do it but God when I say brother we next I say I'm receiving it and I'm walking in it we are next so I I mean I I won't call his name but but uh if I did call his name you all would know him and You' be rejoicing for they blessing you know but uh but I just I just thank God for providing and I know that um he's not just a God Amen in another state but he's God right here in West Palm Beach and and and we are under expectation overflow overflow overflow overflow and and it and it's just something when God doesn't overflow we all get [Music] shook praise God I'm looking for Moments Like That Shook moments this year amen brothers are going to come at this time um we want to turn the service uh now towards our communion our feet washing this is one of the things that the Lord restored this year for us and um we do have open communion it's for all um but as we go through the scripture what I um the scripture just tells us to examine ourselves before we would partake in communion that means if if our life is not up to par with God then we got to make sure that we get those things right before we take communion uh so we want to just read the scripture amen as it pertains uh to communion and uh we want to enter into that portion this is one of the uh ordinances or Commandments that the Lord Jesus leaves for us uh three things that he left for us to do one is water baptism uh the other is communion and uh the third is feet washing these are things that we're supposed to do until the Lord returns amen uh so I want to just uh take a moment to read the scripture and uh as it pertains to communion and um we'll go from there um turn with me to 1 Corinthians chapter 11 everyone standing that can stand 1 Corinthians chapter 11 in verse 23 praise the Lord 1 Corinthians 11 verse 23 says for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he Breo it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had SED saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as of as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord so again if we do this unworthy life is not where it should be with god um unworthy you're guilty the body and blood the Lord the script says this but let a man examine himself and SE that bread and for that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh and to himself not discer the Lord's and Paul goes on and say for this C many are weakly among you and many sleep for if we would judge we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasing of the Lord uh that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together eat Terry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that he come not together into condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come so uh before we would enter uh this time of communion um we want to just take a moment and uh silently pray and while we're praying um I'm asking that you pray for me and uh and I'll be praying for you because we we want to make sure that the examination has been done in our own personal hearts and that we are approaching this amen sincerely um and it's and when you're taking communion you're pretty much saying I'm living the best I can before God and my brothers and sisters I'm living and following the word of God the best I can that's what you're saying when you come to take this communion amen let's pray you pray for me while I pray for you Grant these requests almighty God forgive us of our trespasses as we forgive those who have trespassed against us we ask it in Jesus name amen amen [Music] um Brothers you can bring the um the communion Trace so they bringing um the trays just want you to be aware that the bread that you'll be partaking of tonight uh is not round but the bread has been broken and it's broken because it symbolizes that Christ's body was broken uh for [Music] us um the bread represents the body of the Lord [Music] Jesus represents the broken body of Christ my prayer is that every person that partakes of this tonight will receive the blessing of the Holy Spirit to come upon them those that are sick may God in heaven who instituted this in the first form down in Egypt by taking a bit of herbs and wine we trust God to heal you and in your entire Journey there'll be no sickness among you uh may God May the god of Heaven look look to us now as we offer this to him let's pray over the bread Lord God creator of heavens and earth author of everlasting life give of every good gift we thank you for this order that we could do this in remembrance of you as we Fellowship as it was in your presence around the communion of God's grace as we think within our own hearts that one day we were unworthy but now the blood of Jesus Christ has cleansed us from that sin that we stand together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus this kosher bread father that's been baked and brought here for this purpose we ask you to sanctify it Lord that in the representation of your broken body the sacredness the pain the suffering that you did at Calvary when your body was broken you were wounded for our transgression you are bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace is upon you and with your stripes we are healed that's why we take this broken bread tonight and God bless the Believers and sanctify this kosher bread to be the representation uh of the body of the Lord Lord Jesus Christ amen also the Bible said in like manner he took the cup and when he had SED he said take and drink this is the cup of the New Testament as often as you do this you show forth the Lord's death till he come and as uh we hold uh in our hand tonight the wine made from the life of the grapes that's been brought together here to represent the blood of Jesus Christ there's never a time yet that I ever picked up the communion tree but I looked in there and see my sins gone I say if it hadn't been for that well where would we be uh so let's pray over uh the wine as we uh come to partake of that tonight Lord Jesus we present to you the wine taken from the blood of grapes to represent the blood of Jesus Christ may as we receive it father May sickness depart from us may sin desire be taken from us may we live such holy consecrated lives after this that men will see the reflection of Jesus Christ in us and that our walk walk in life would be worthy of the Gospel that we believe Grant it father and sanctify this wine now for its intended use in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you can be [Music] seated um the brothers will direct you to uh come and participate in communion those that will participate and our just want to reiterate that uh we don't want to rush through we want whoever's standing at the communion table give them time to finish what they're doing before the next person comes up so you can just stand
