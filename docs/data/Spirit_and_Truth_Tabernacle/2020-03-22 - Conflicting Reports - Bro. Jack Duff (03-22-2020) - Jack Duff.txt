to be able to fulfill his word and while we are you know just abiding by amen the recommendations that have been given to us by the CDC just want to encourage you that you do have the ability to give online if you have the church app on your telephone there is a gift button inside the church app which allows you to give online it's done through PayPal so you need to have a PayPal account and the

website so either through the app or you can give a man online at the church website spirit and truth tabernacle org that is a church website WWE and truth Tabernacle dot o-r-g amen god bless you while we are preparing a man for the offering and we'll pray over it shortly this world to give you a couple announcements here we won't be having pinnacle palm service we usually go there do our outreach service but there the the population they residents it may be a little older and which they are in the high-risk category so we don't want to a man be accused of bringing anything on site and creating a problem for some of the residents so we decided to just suspend a man our Pelican palm time and until further notice so just keep that in mind so we won't have it today and we won't be doing that until further notice got away to something sound down a man and also for our Wednesday night service we'll be doing that virtual like like we're doing right now we'll be doing that virtual

further notice we will watch things settle down we'll get back on our regular schedule now we are certainly trying to adhere to the recommendations that's been given to us by the government and CDC a man so just keep those things in mind and we trust that the Lord will just bring us through I know he will I know he will they told us that this was supposed to last roughly 15 days and and that start an account from last Monday I believe that's when the president mentioned it so it might be this Sunday next Sunday that we'll have to do this but we're trusting that the Lord will just Unleashed and open up a man opportunity for us to come back together again fear is driving a lot of the decisions amen and we just only continue to buy them the spirit of fear that God would just give people peace you know time like this and the only way to got a final peace because they must find Jesus Christ a man named US v Jesus Christ because he is our peace amen so let's pray over this time of giving amen and we'll just admit these things to the Lord father we just thank you for the ability that you've given us to be able to stream the the service today and Lord the states that would use the various forms of technology to bringing their tithes and offering to the house of God we pray Lord that you have blessed them as they give thank you Lord for meeting every need of this church thank you for meeting the needs of your people and God we realize that there are some that may be impacted they may not be able to work because of some of the decisions that have to be made God we're claiming that you are a wave maker that you are a miracle worker and you're lying in the darkness and God somehow someway you will make a way for your people so I pray that you would just keep each one encouraged and strengthened and Lord and may they just may they know without a shadow of a doubt that you have everything under control this did not get you by surprise so Lord may our faith be activated amen to believe you for the impossible we're we're believing you for incredible things and Lord looking for you to doing the exceeding the abundant above all we can ask a thing we realize that our jobs a man

amen so if we can let's just get our Bibles I want to turn and read up a couple scriptures Amen for today and my heart comes to you a man with a number of things a man that I want to share and I know I won't have the opportunity to share at all so we will a man just get started where we are and just trust that the Lord will they meant direct us even on today we certainly want to do anything we can to encourage the believers and in a time like this we need encouragement but we also need to keep our eyes on Jesus amen there's a lot happening and it's happening so fast we want to keep our eyes on the Lord Jesus as you can see we're streaming the service day and we had plans to have a dual service today but as the information just kind of kept coming we had to make adjustments based on what was given to us and and you know we're trusting that we're doing the right thing by doing it this way and but we're believing that we will come out of this a man I believe that the scripture tells us to forsake not the assembling of ourselves together a man and I don't believe he was talking about online a man I believe he want us to come together half Church praise the Lord a man I believe that's his will and he said we should do that as we see the day drawing closer to Cole's we see Jesus is coming soon we need to be in church or not less a man so we're doing this and honor of the what they were they're recommending and requesting of us but uh Hart is that we'll be able to come together amen in person much sooner than later amen but let's just read a couple scriptures on today Ezekiel chapter 9 amen we want to read from and then also pull from Ephesians 4:30 praise the Lord and man Ezekiel 9 makes this music you writes it says he cried also in mine ears with a loud voice and caused them that have charged over the city to draw near even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand and the whole six men came from the way of the higher gate which live toward the north and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand and one man among them was clothed with linen o blessed be the name of the Lord clothed with linen with a writer's inkhorn by his side and they went in and stood beside the brazen altar and the the glory of the Lord the glory of the God of Israel was going up from the cherub whereupon he was to the threshold of the house and he called to the man clothed with linen which had their writers in corn by his side and the Lord said unto him go through the midst of the city through the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof and to the others he said in my hearing go he after him through the city and smite let much I spare neither have he pity Amen so when judgment was striking there was no pity and we want to consider God a man as a God of love a man and a God that would never do us any harm and you know and that's I mean that's a beautiful picture but he is a God of judgment as well and I can tell you right now sometimes it's not even God himself doing the judgment himself but man brings the judgment upon himself right the things that man does it brings his own judgment upon him a man hallelujah and we can't be a nation or people that only want to invoke God when we are in trouble right a man God don't want that type of a relationship even a man we don't want that type of relationship with people we don't want people invoking us when they're in trouble amen a true relationship is when there is no trouble we still have in conversation and God wants that type of relationship with his people amen so here verse verse 5 into the others he said in mind here and going after him through the city and smite let not here I spare neither have ye pity slay utterly old and young both maids and little children and women but come not near any man upon the moon is the mark and began at my sanctuary then they begin at the ancient then action man which were before the house a man and he said unto and he said unto them the foul defile the house and fill the courts with the slain going forth and they went forth and slew in the city a man let's also just turn to Ephesians 4 praise the Lord Ephesians 4 and 30 and just to just try to share a little something from our heart with you today a man Ephesians 4:30 it just says this in grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption amen grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you're still unto the day of redemption let's pray over the word father we thank you for the privilege that we can read the word of God it takes the Holy Spirit to help us understand what we've ran things are written in prophecy in in a simple form and God Lord how we need to understand prophecy in this hour so we pray Lord that you would just break open hearts Lord just some things that you will want us to know as we just share amen today with your believers bless your people right whether you are in Jesus name we pray amen amen all right you can be seated and man just a little we want to just talk on the subject of conflicting reports in man conflicting reports and I'm going to get started a man in this particular thought and I know that I won't get to where I really want to go today but we'll go as far as we can a man and we'll go from there in the wake of copán 19 and all the changes I want to first say that this is his story Amen what we were going through even the way that we're doing services and this is his story I'm glad that we have the ability to be able to see it online it's also recorded there might come a day maybe 25 years now of 30 years not in the Lord the latest coming that people go back and be able to look at these videos and say well how did y'all make it through that it took God amen that bring us through that in a you know we we come to a spot where we were we were told that we couldn't go into church or any gathering they didn't use the word church but they say any other gatherings a man who we knew that that that meant Church right but uh but you know we have these things that they didn't want I mean another started that 250 was 250 we didn't want you to gather didn't drop down to a hundred and some sticks and and then before you know it was down to 50 then the president came out and said 10 amen and when it's that 10 that included every church right because most churches gonna at least have 10 people in it oh my my my now I didn't catch this until I stood in the pulpit a man but you know even Abraham asked that if there be 10 we do not destroy if there were teen hallelujah can God find ten righteous people in this hour Amen that were put to a stop destruction from hitting this earth and I believe God got at least a letti just fine oh I'm so glad I can see them one of them glory to God hallelujah amen so so here you know we were at a point where they want if it's more than 10 they don't want us together and we met as Christians and as believers we are certainly adhering to what they're requesting the man is not a law but it's a request and as Christians a man we do decide I remember brother Branham making a statement he says as a as dumb as an American he says I'm identified with our glory and with her shame I believe sin has brought these things upon us amen but as Americans we are identified with the glory and with the shame so as Americans we have to adhere to the laws of the land we have to render unto Jesus what exceeds us but we also rid them to God what is God so this is why we hear amen and just happiness service them and as you're looking there on the video all you're seeing is me in the pulpit you saw my daughter here Flagler earlier but it's only a few of us here today just just producing this service for you but everybody else is at home we don't know how long it'll be like this with trust it's only gonna be for short time but this is what church had to come to in our generation a man that had to come to an old-line Street praise the Lord Amen but we thank God for the technology we thank God that we have the opportunity do this as we were approaching all these changing things this week information was coming from everywhere Amen you don't know what to believe a man you don't know what to take seriously because information is coming from everywhere and the unfortunate thing is that the information conflicts with other information a man so we're getting conflicting reports hallelujah and I just want to just take a little time and we'll talk a little bit about that today but before we go further one of the things was was troubling my spirit you know as as different churches was making decisions and you know our you know there were some sandwich sitting down they had to because their groups are too great they were well over 200 300 400 people so they had to shut down some thousands of people so you know we're it up in this position where we didn't have to close so I say hey let's let's have two services on Sunday that's what we're doing everybody responded thank God for the responses we were ready to do that and and then they dropped it to ten so it's like okay we can't we can't do it the way that we want to do it but actually were processing that I said I'm sending my supper set in history because there's been plagues that have have come upon us in history how did people respond to this how did church leaders respond to these things in history I just had this this this thing about hearted and I really didn't know where to go and get it but I happen to be a part of a minister's chat group and one of the brothers put a quote out of that for Martin Luther they banned it and instead this when Martin Luther was dealing with the bubonic plague he wrote these words he says I shall ask God mercifully to protect us god I want to ask you mercifully to protect us from coronavirus amen I wanna ask you Murph sleeper to protect us he said I shall ask God mercifully to protect us then I shall fumigate hallelujah I like that fumigate this is you know I mean in an hour there would be us washing our hands and doing all the things that we might need to do just to protect ourselves and not just ourselves but to protect others and then he said then I shall do again help purify the air administer medicine Amen this is what a church a messenger spoke he says I shall that minister medicine I don't know and take it hallelujah so if they all the medicine and then he would take it now now I realized we have to be careful with this because there's so much information going that people tell you don't take the vaccine don't do it it's and don't do that a man you can only do what God leads you to do praise the Lord you can only do what God leeches you but but understand that when they give me a vaccine they are actually shooting you with a virus hallelujah when I went to Africa years ago and it made it had to take shots for a man I believe was typhoid fever something like that that I had to take shots for and like they gave me malaria pills but when I took this shot for the top part fever man I got sick it and I did I ever got sick in my life I thought I could go back to work I had to leave work go home lay in the bed because this thing that they shot me with was actually a virus and what it was doing was going into my body and causing my body to respond so that if I got sick when I was in Africa that a man would not have any bearing on me Oh hallelujah so so I understand that that is part of what they do and they give you a vaccine now you be a man of God on how you do things like that a man science has proven that sometimes these vaccines create more problems hallelujah Amen some I mean I think they even showed that some of the kids that are dealing with different symptoms today and Amen it's because of some of the things that they that they injected in their bodies so we got to be careful let the Lord lead you a man in these things hallelujah it meant said it he says I I shall fumigate help purify the air administer medicine and take it I shall avoid places and persons where my presence is not needed that's what that's what the Martin Luther said I shall avoid places and persons where my presence is not needed in order not to become contaminated and thus perchance and bleach and pollute others and so cause death as a result of my negligence so we're trying to do something right hey man listen he says if God should wish to take me he will surely find me and I have done what he has expected of me so and so I am NOT responsible for either my own death or the death of Ellis if my neighbor needs me however he says I shall not avoid place or person so if somebody's standing in the lead I'm come on I was grateful glory to God amen he says I'm coming if my neighbor hasn't me he said I shall not afford place a person I shall go freely as stated above it says see this is such a god-fearing faith because it is neither rash nor foolhardy foolhardy and does not tempt God I say you know when I when I read this I'll need it to hear something like that I don't want we don't want to be foolish in the way that we handle this is this thing yes we may have different feelings and beliefs as to what this could be a man but nonetheless we will out here amen to the recommendations that's been given us as long as we can there's other information that's been kind of flowing and there's more stuff that could be coming and we just got to be prepared we got to be fluent in a time like this but I know God's gonna make a way he gonna see us through Amen I'm not worried about that hallelujah thank God Amen that a messenger hat that type of wisdom on how to handle himself during the bubonic plague amen look at this I want to go for it too amen another quote from God's prophet a man William grant hallelujah amen now let me also just state this there's many of people rising up today with all kind of prophecies that they and they say I put it in my book 20 years ago I put it here and I put it there and now it's all coming to pass you know and and III don't doubt that that happened amen I thank God for that I was recently watching something that just it bothered my spirit there's a man he calls himself a master prophet a man a master property the way he gets this title master proper because he's prophesized so many times a man and things that come to pass so you know pretty much they say if you're doing stuff that over and over again you get good and you become a master of it that don't even sound right according to the Bible right but there were masked the Prophet it's not in Scripture but this man was saving this and and while he was being interviewed by another man another gentleman that claimed that he used to be a pastor for 20 years and and used to be a pastor for 20 years he makes a statement on his on his from his broadcast while he's interviewing this master prophet and he says he says you know I know people have pastors but we don't need pastors we need a personal profit I said wow he just completely eliminated pastors from the church and saying everybody gotta have themselves a master prophet Oh fine now now now and the master prophet never corrected him on this just sit there and absorb this and I say there's something wrong with this spirit I don't care how many prophecies come to pass if you can't put yourself back in the scripture something's wrong with this fear so I wonder I wanna I wanna encourage the church be careful of all these so-called prophets that God had shoes for this generation and he came according to scripture if anything sell myself on what God said through his prophet that he said according to Malachi chapter 4 according to revelation 10 7 amen he fulfilled those scriptures so you know I want to read some things a man and a man gesture God's prophet he never even called himself a master prophet just a man you believe me to be God's prophet yes I believe you to be God's prophet well let's read a couple things Amen from him glory to God this is a message God's providing weight of healing now look at this it makes this common sense what is cancer what is a cancer what is the disease will deal will do them that for the next five minutes now what is a cancer what caused that thing let's take a cancer or anything you wish to tubercular pneumonia whatever you wish to any disease look at what he says now diseases are germs diseases are germs amen hallelujah says let me pass something here quickly as our times going listen did you know the Bible predicts that in the last days that there'll be a germ warfare now watch this man because the properties saying germ warfare and now eat these be keenest in 1954 and now for this thing to spread throughout the entire world Amen not just one country's dealing with it but every country I got a text yesterday from a friend down and a mannequin in Durban South Africa he's saying people down there a dime we heard from somebody in West Africa people over that they're invoking all these changes there to keep the people under curfew because of the effect of this virus this is worldwide the privacy they were amen there will be germ warfare hallelujah germ warfare amen these are disease diseases of viruses its germ warfare hallelujah glory to God now we and we can we can hear everything on a news and and how the president is not even calling it coronavirus a man he's coming in China virus says it came from China it started this is what he said now you know the Chinese are responding to that and the Chinese are said if you gonna stop saying that we're gonna withhold the medication hallelujah amen it becomes germ warfare glory to God now the problem is telling these things so this is why we're not alarmed this is why amen we're not scared this is why we're not operating in fear amen this is why you know that we have up we have a peace and a confidence even during this time we know God has already spoke to Astra's prophet look at this it says there would be a German war fair that diseases will break out upon the people and will follow on everyone without the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit amen so anybody that does not have the baptism of Holy Spirit and then you are a candidate they meant to receive this virus hallelujah amen now don't let that alarm you because in the days of Moses those that did not have the blood apply to the door they were candidates but the Death Angel strike their house so my best advice to you a man is to be fit repent first being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and according to God's Word you shall be filled with the Holy Ghost you come God's Way and cobble back up his word glory to God listen a man say the seasons will break out of other people and will bottom everyone without the baptism of the Holy Spirit now but with the angel or who had charge over these plagues was given orders to touch no Oh whom the mark was now this is a scripture that we're reading a man from Ezekiel 9 lorry to God the went went went went went of the the order went out a man go out and a man taking out your destroying weapons in your hand and just began to circle Jerusalem and you know said I want you to go down and don't don't spare a child don't stare a man a teenager don't spare a man the young no sparrow a boy girl a man woman man it doesn't matter nobody was spared but while he was in them all of these angels were in the midst of carrying out the order there was one with the inkhorn a man the Eco rider and he was giving instruction saying now stop them from - we see to believe [Applause] oh I'm on the expectation church amen for God to do something I don't want to get ahead of myself here but but they were given the order they have to carry this out Amen they had to carry it out it and you know a nice thing whereas they were going to to carry this out they were told no Amen we want to seal up the service of God amen and in their foreheads we want to seal them up before of destruction strikes we want to seal them up Amen we want to seal them up so so this is what we're looking for they man we're looking for the seal of God we're looking for the power of God we're looking for the Holy Spirit to come upon his people and then we're looking for that Hey oh my I'm the one that believes God can visit you right where you are in your living room God can visit you in your kitchen God can visit you hallelujah if you've been if you've already repented and you've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you ought to beat on the expectation that God is gonna fill you with the Holy Ghost go over to God and I don't care how much often the devil tell you amen you did this you can't get the Holy Ghost you did that you can't get the Holy Ghost well according to my Bible right based on what I did and actually it was based on one thing I did so put the devil in his place up and give them scripture already if you ever want to defeat the devil you have to give them spiritually yeah Oh hallelujah alright let's go on and just read a little bit more here a man of this you says but the angel but but with the angel or who had charged over these plates was given orders that touched no one to whom the mark was Wow how much kind of teachers have we got to be brethren to get the church in order to be in that condition in new he says my arms are sore now from where the doctors at sponge needles in to try to knock you late me from yellow fever so forth I told him I didn't need it but they would listen to me but I'll tell you what God's going to do God's got a serum and it's called the Holy Ghost and when the serum goes in it immaculately you hallelujah in the last aches now you know there is a no doubt amen a tremendous tremendous amount of fear months to people with everything that's going on and I just want to just drop a few things into your spirit to try to encourage you amen we're not operating in fear you know just because we're here with a limited a man amount of people today don't mean we're operating fear right Amen we are rendering out to see just what a ceases a man hallelujah so you know the thing of it is is that we realize these things must come these things must happen but church I'm the expectation for a rapture glory to God but but I realize Amen that I that I there there's some people that I love that I want to see make it and I realize that this is a time that they must come so I begin to get desperate in my prayer amen and Lord more please save this one and lord please restore that one and God through this so don't let them be lost God amen we gotta stand in the gap for somebody listen this message Amen the junction of time the profit makes a statement it says but then just before that God brought the show down to show who was God said there come a time that there was a provocation to the land by the name of heal our child who was ignoring it with the message of God and he performed the miraculous and proved that omnipotence still was miraculous I believe that a man he says the Prophet stood out there and closed the heavens that it didn't rain in the days of his ministry and he brought the rains down out of out of the heavens and give the earth and angels appeared on the scene hallelujah baked him some cornbread that kept him 40 days alive while he was out there in the wilderness with God angels appear in the in time we ought to be an expectation for this angels appear in the end time now that scripture that I've just read I think you're not that was angels going to carry that out hallelujah amen it was angels that was going to carry out God's instructions to destroy no matter who they were unless they had that shield on they couldn't be destroyed oh my god amen that still is important that seals the for in the days of Joshua and the children Israel when they were going through Jericho to take the land that God gave them Rahab was given a promise that if you would just hang this token the Scarlet thread out your window then everybody that is inside your house will be spared from the destruction that was about to come hallelujah we don't need people and their to be in our physical house but we need to know that they are in God's house spiritually in Christ spiritually if you get in shoes bill beats there look at this angels appear in the end time all the prophets and the signpost points and this day that angels will appear prophets will arise signs of wonders and if God did that for those little junctions back there what will he do now when all hell turn loose and if we don't realize our hell has been turned loose I don't know what we're looking at we gotta get up ahead out of the singing and then all hell has been loose at the barbershop now every time will show his hand God got something greater the devil wanna build a fire and put the Hebrew boys inside fire then God say I'll leave my home in heaven and I'll come down myself stand in the fire with these boys hallelujah God will always outdo the devil praise God they say Oh heaven we'll turn loose angels appearance signs and wonders on the earth the counterfeit arrives and God proven which is right and wrong amen I'm looking for all of heaven to break loose I was in the barber shop this week and young man was daring he made a statement of it and I was rushing to the barbershop I heard they might shut it down you know not any sense of business isn't going down that's a bad you know I don't know how long they go down let me go get my hair cut and ya Melanson a barber barber shopping we just began to talking and you know he was just saying you know what I feel like he said this is like an attack on three different levels it's a political attack it's an economic attack it's a religious religious impact religious it's coming against the religions as well as well I submit that's a really good way to look at this people can't go to work the economy is going to be messed up they are already telling us that if you can't go to work now you making the rules that won't allow me to go to work right but if you can't go to work the way that they're going to supplement you is by you taking out a loan right interest-free loan is that really an answer I'm gonna go in debt because I can't go to work that's not something's wrong with this picture right so so you know here he say he said this is this is a political economic religious and you know and and I and what church is not being able to meet the way that they normally meet we know has religious impact they won't use the word church and then because that begins to go give some of the amendments right but but they say other gatherings so you're including churches and other gatherings hallelujah politically we know that a man whenever the countries in the up war like this and it just so happens to be during its it's a it's an election year now then we get this an election year now and typically when the country's in an uproar like this it's always easier for us to not implement change but the state with the norm hallelujah we want to stay with the norm we don't want to change presidents we don't want to change governors we don't want to change it we want to stay with the north let them work us out of this particular situation I want to tell you your government is not just saying yeah but Jesus Christ is our Savior hallelujah but you gotta walk to his political its economic and it's religious amen now as I was talking to the young man he was saying now you know look at this it says you know that they're kind of modifying the hours of the grocery stores and you know at some point time I mean we might not be able to buy or sell now you're gonna scripture prop up prophesied this and they said now I'm a father with three little kids what you think I'm gonna do I'm gonna go and do whatever they need me to do in order to get food for my children I say no don't take the March whatever you do don't take my brother I know it might get tough but don't do that say were you rejecting Christ you taking the mark don't stay with the word of God in this hour no matter how stay with God's worked oh yes yes yes I want to tell you a man that I mean with this bit of economic a man impacted and there are many I don't want to make light of this but I want to encourage you in your faith some of us may lose a man work we may we may be in a loss of work we may not be able to go to work bring money to homes and and sometimes you need to begin to worry when things like that happened but I want to aim at if I can't just encourage you a man with God's faithful promise and when you're praying number taste another brand of just said angels will appear in the end times a signs and wonders it and I'm gonna tell you something with all the chaos I just read to y'all all heaven will turn you all heads then we'll turn loose a man I'm not just reading that just to read it I want to encourage your faith I'll expect all heaven you see all hail now look for all heaven look for him now now I want to just encourage you in the Word of God Malachi 3 verse 10 3:11 and I was just blessed you know and I and I brothers chat yeah I was I told him about the service and you know what we're gonna have to do for the day and one of the brothers but never how're we supposed to pay tithes and offering now I'm glad people even think about that you know there's something that don't even consider that but how did we pay our tithes and offering I say well amen amen because there is a promise for people that do that glory to God let's read what God said naw man I'm I'm not concerned about what man says I'm only concerned about what God says what God says is bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be there may be meat in mine house and prove me now herewith God say prove him and then prove me now herewith sell or else if I will not open you the windows of heaven Oh glory to God amen amen hallelujah if I will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it this is God's Word to you this is God's Word to me I'm a living witness that when I stood on this i watch that reverse things amen when they come to the house of heaven bless is where heaven I've never seen I believe that our jobs is a resource but God is our source God will pray of God we heard it asked me if God used Ravens to provide room service to his prophet then the goddess unlimited what he'll do for you not just Ravens in the days of Elijah but you know even in the days of Jesus they needed to pay tax you know where they found the money they did not go to work they did not get an extra job they went fishing doing the leisurely activity amen e in the presence of your enemies in a table before me in the presence of my hand I'm doing this and when I fish the first fish I catch your have the letter that I need I don't know how much steak taxes work but wouldn't that be a lot of money to have in a fish church our dog we don't see miracles we don't see miracles we can see I mean it give you all heard the testimony system that couldn't go to church because my husband threw the keys into the lake didn't it didn't even realize it through the kids election see you ain't going to church number the lady lady up went to the supermarket to cook fish a man for dinner one night a man for her loving husband bless the name of Jesus we're never put up to tough took two hour to cook him a meal and when she went to splash the fish a man she's scale them and then she went to Berlin and sure right like what in the world is inside this fish and that she cut the fish nobody else could catch that fish the Bible tells us a man I will if I will not open you the windows were having a pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it and I will I love this I will this is not you doing it this is God doing it for you yet I will he's a mighty warrior strong in doubt I will rebuke the Devourer for your sakes and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground neither show your fire can stir fruit before the time in the field saith the Lord of hosts this is what God says so sometimes Amen when Satan is bringing all that doubt we don't know how this could happen how to happen we know God said that he rebuke the Devourer I state can I give you another scripture just to encourage your heart Philippians 4:19 these are things that you've read before you a menu here quoted all the time but I just wanted to take time to read it to you today amen this is what the word of the Lord says but my god hallelujah amen not up not my job hallelujah but my god this is what he said in his word but my God shall supply some of your needs oh oh that's not what the Bible say the Bible said all of your needs and what we heard last week all means Oh amen I need my god shows by all your need according to his riches and glory that means there if God is not limited by what we have here on earth my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus this is what the Word of God says so we stand on this promise a man we believe it's worked and we're gonna hold it on to that with everything we got now let me just go on to a couple other things here I'm going to skip down here it's conflicting reports conflicting reports and I won't give them all to you today I'll save something the next time we come but you know just last Monday we had the president stand gathers no more than 10 I mean CDC started at 250 then government I mean different governors jumped in and start talking to their their states in 700 and then you know CDC was saying 50 why the president was saying 10 and and we just had to come accompli you know which one do we go with until CDC finally said is exactly what the president said and I just felt within myself that if everybody's gonna be taken seriously they've got to say the same they've got to say the same thing hallelujah glory to God so so whenever said no gathers of people over 50 then it dropped to 10 we were just getting so many conflicting reports amen they told us that this was a virus that attacked the elderly a man so so so be careful anybody over 60 try to keep them out of amen of the public and you know out of galleries and things that because this is something attacking most people over 60 that's what they told us and then we start finding out a bunch of young people were dying from it right you know put everybody in fear you know it's a if I could just put it this way it's a free prison they don't even have to pay for it it's a free prison keep you in your house locked up won't come out free prison system how it'll be all right but but but you know they give us our this if and they can still fear and I will tell you I want to say some of the fears because they just don't know most of them just don't know they haven't seen anything like this and they don't know how to prepare for it I was just looking at a statement here from the Prophet I sent this out amen to you all in our letter to the church and I watched this what what he says here it says and the message then Jesus came it makes a statement it said this is and this is spoken in 1957 this is the darkest hour that this world has ever faced since the beginning of time since there has never been a time in all the world's history that is as that is dark as it is right now cancers on the rampage just think that I heard a statement the other day of this like this that there will be more people dying in America this year from smoking cigarettes that cause cancer that will die this year in America then there was killed in the four years of a Korean War more people with died smoking cigarettes a man then the people that died in the Korean War mom think about that nice for speaking of this 1957 and I can almost assure you that still there's more people dying today probably smoking cigarettes than even being attacked by this virus but they won't report it they won't report it they only report what they want us to know right in that way they can shape our minds and create fear right now look at what the promises it says cancers on the rampage diseases are happening and everything's taking place where we don't know what to expect the doctors don't know what to call the diseases now you know I found it very very strange amen that the Prophet spoke this and I'm gonna just keep reading because something that something that would just went through recently I just want to try to bring this in he says I says diseases are happening everything's taking place but we don't know what to expect the doctors don't know what the caller diseases so they're saying they're viruses the doctors don't know what to call the diseases so they're saying they're viruses now recently we had to you can just pull that over just the same you know recently we had to take my grandson to the to the emergency room his parents a man like my son-in-law and my daughter they took him to the emergency room we you know he had a really terrible fever and and I want to say this was just a few weeks ago that we had to take him and and when they when they went there to emergency room we got and they're trying to be diagnosed and everything and the only thing they could come back with for us is to say this is what we call a viral illness okay I don't think I've ever heard of a viral illness and what that was was really just a virus that's how they were saying and what the Prophet told us that when the doctors don't know what they say is virus virus and I said well well how did he get this oh there's so many ways because he just picked up stuff off the ground and put it in his mouth it's hard to believe some of the stuff that they're telling you you wait a minute you mean like when he dropped his pacifier and put it in his mouth so what we're doing is we're caring viruses how does this work what's going on because I know it's just really hard to really wrap your mind around what this is but they just used thing viral illness so they can tell you you got anything and they actually don't know right they don't know but they tell you you got I told something matter said now a few weeks ago man I was I had I had flu-like so I talked about before coronavirus had to take the even say this live because somebody that had me quarantine right but a few weeks ago I had a fever of a hundred or two on top before why everything was still in China I had a 102 people now you know somebody actually say did you go get that check out until I said look they didn't have no test kids when I had this but the Lord brought me through a man the Lord the Lord brought me through I took vitamin C I did okay I just basic things that you do hallelujah and that's what brought me through hallelujah do you know another conflicting report is that they tell you not to take they first said take ibuprofen then they said don't take it what a why why not take because there are many people that are saying they took it and actually got better from the flu like symptoms when they took the ibuprofen yeah what is really going on here right amen you better be led of God but for me I'm going to do the basic things that I've always done my you can see amen and just the necessary medicines that they give us right over I mean you need we got to get it from the pharmacist just go right there to the store pick it up a little bit it's over the cap just buy it and take it if you got blue like scepters you used to always do that and we got better now let me sit under that don't work no more huh no I don't believe it I use it it worked for me I'm talking I've been full Corona but they just used things like this a man is just a virus this is what they would call it and and this why we got to be so careful this one we need to know a man that we we got week weekend we got a confidence that our prayers hurt by our God and then he goes over says what is a virus what is a virus he says ask the doctor asked the doctor if something that he doesn't that he don't know nothing about he just says it's a virus hallelujah that's all there is there's little ol bugs and demons of flying that man never heard of before everything on the move everything we're trying to curb it with natural things but when we try to do this it breaks out something else so here's what I want I want you to know that this will calm down this will actually calm down but when it gets calm down something else is coming yeah hallelujah and we'll go through a whole exercise all over again yeah hallelujah amen Lord you got now that told me you need to pack up and stop powerful three years amen look tribulation is coming but I don't plan on being you put too much stuff in your house and your neighbor see the to God you might experience a break-in all right all right all right let's go up it says we're trying to curve it with natural things but when we're trying to do this it breaks out something else that's right you give a man penicillin penicillin for this and it'll set up something else you give this you're just all out of the way God has a way and we might as well get into it the churches has failed the Presbyterians failed the Methodists failed the Baptist fell in a Pentecostal fell the pinhole in his fell the Church of God failed we've everyone fell that's right what we need to do is get back to the Word of God now I wanna just bring out just another little little statement here and we'll try to shift gears and bring this home another completeness statement we said that we were told that this box now they don't know they call it coronavirus and the Prophet just told us that when they can't explain what it is they just called it a virus hey man we just all just gulp it you know right then but this virus they say was caused by people consuming bats this is the information that games that it was caused by people eating that suit and I just I talked really believe it but they say it does happen and then they also came out and said there's a special Evan call a pendulum and the pendulum was the cause of this I don't know either they first said animals could even get it so how did the animal start you know peggeleh right so and then then the last thing I heard is it's generated because of 5g technology I want to read something to you as you're hearing these things remember God sent us a prophet and he told us things 60 70 years ago before this even came to pass a man and all the others go back and look at this man he makes a statement and a message in Tison spirits there was there was a big article and let me let me also just mention this teachers we don't know who to believe or what to believe so don't get caught up on all that stuff this one said that that would say that let's rather than sending all these stories that are totally unconfirmed just somebody coming up with a story everybody want to be popular now right but these totally unconfirmed stories let's just send people the Word of God let's encourage each other with Scripture let's encourage each other with it with something let's thin the Word of God rather than sending all the nonsense hey man what we're gonna go and it is not edified its knowledge of information but it's not an affiant glory to God now look at different props a minute Isis fierce it says now we've applied it in a healing service always to the healing stock cancer tumor Catterick tuberculosis all those things are not natural things they are supernatural and our demons the scripture plainly indicates that but that is a demon in the body with gross like caps life in it and the life of that is a demon what we try to do is cast out that demon right amen says growth of a cataract the spread of tuberculosis and other diseases is demons that's in a physical form now this morning we're going to talk about demons in a spiritual form in the soul they're in the soul that's the same as they are in the body and we're bound to admit that we see them in people's bodies such as cancers and different diseases that's in the human body so when you see somebody attacked with one of these one of these illnesses and it's manifesting on out our part of the body you can see it you know that's a demon living hallelujah he says just recently even cancer has been declared to be a fourth dimension disease now I want us to watch this that is in another dimension sure it's demonology every disease is a fourth dimension disease the beginning of it now when they came out and said that this this could have come from this district of rotavirus or something that could have come from 5g technology I've thought about somebody mentioned this coating I've thought about that actually no because 5g technology is actually operating in the fourth dimension your cell phone it's operating in the fourth dimension right there's a lot of things that operating in that fourth dimension and even scientists were saying hey this 5g technology has the capability of producing a virus this is what they were seeing they were trying to stop them from producing it but yet it's just a report that I saw amen but yet they report them they did these things it you know we don't know if it actually came from the five jeep we don't know exactly that I can tell you right now your cell phone is creating cancer yeah they make your cell phone is doing that now will people put down their cell phone no they're not they know they're getting cancer but they still go had a thing right up today if it's a truth in now this is though this is how we live and if you didn't have a cell phone would be very difficult for you to get along today hey man this is just holiday but understand that what the property was telling us years ago we see it come to pass so don't let anything shock you do the best you can do the best you can don't don't operate in fear a man I mean maybe sometimes just pray over your phone before you pick it up lord please help me God got to use this thing but lord please help me and then these diseases are coming from that fourth dimension all right I want to just saw oh my there's so much more so much more I won't have time to let me let me skip down and read this never read this oh Jesus this is our this line up for me though to take to take on the whole armor of God another conflicting report they told us that this is something that could last 18 months but in China they only do it just a few months of this and and I understand China is on an economic rebound because they've overcome it already right now why is it that we got to go through 18 months but they only went through a few months complete the reports we don't know what to believe but I will tell you this take on the whole armor God now watch this rock star before I read this I was I told y'all I'm looking for miracles in the midst of all this chaos I'm expecting God to do some mighty money and one thing a sister sent me a little text this morning just bless my heart she was she was encouraging her family and just for some scriptures and everything and and actually was encouraging with scriptures one of her daughters who's actually vaccinated respondents saying mama thank you for sharing this I remember when brother Jack preached the sermon on the whole armor of God they back but they remember the sermon his go and say I don't know if that summers on linemen if you can find it please send it to them I'm actually expecting backs - to be restored I'm expecting sinners to be saying I'm expecting the seat to be here I got an expectation that all heaven is about to break loose I've seen all hail now I'm looking for all glory to God let's be able to look out for I'm looking for God to make a way for you if you don't if you can't go to work I was looking for God believe me extracting these miracles oh my god no killing - there's a silly hey man no killing - there's our stealing all right all right all right I just want to drop these things into your spirit and then I'm gonna try to move on out of here take on the whole armour of God the Prophet said this now this thing that what China being blaming China being blame watch this watch this gold says there's three curves as I leave you this afternoon I'll leave this with you remember there's three curtains one of them's called the iron curtain one of them the bamboo curtain China and so forth Easter and then there's a purple curtain don't fear the bamboo curtain or the iron curtain now the bamboo will be China the iron curtain would be Russia but the purple curtain the purple curtain is wrong I would just reach out to quote i'ma Louie he says don't fear the bamboo curtain or the iron curtain but be careful of that purple one better be careful the Antichrist shall be so close to the sea the very elect what is the elected when that light shines upon that s o n son s you in shines in front of C that's governed by poppy life it'll come to life and when the s o in of God shines upon that for testing and seeing I'm praying even right now as people are streaming and watching this that the SOL is shining upon them for this thing to see it'll come to life that quick just as soon I don't care what state of life it might be a prostitute it might be a drunkard or a gambler in a shine at that minute as soon as it strikes it deceive the elect if it was possible now I looked at that because everything is trying to this China virus the president called amen China's not the thing that we need to worry about recently it came out in the news that Italy has more debts from the coronavirus then China did Oh the Pope the Pope the Vatican City is it Italy so brother branham just told us no don't get your Island back the bamboo curtain don't put your eye on the Iron Curtain but you better be watching the purple curtain so we better watch what comes from this because for me to me just one announcement all you gotta say is covin 20 October 21 a new strain that's not against it and then then all of us the whole not just the nation but the world goes into a panic everybody shut down just like that and governments don't know what to do they're looking for somebody with an answer well they got a man that'll come up come forth and be their Savior a court in the scripture the Pope will come into that place and they were easily give it right to just just recently before this even happened they had a thing a man where all the different religions of the world sign a document that they would become one they become one but they were all followed underneath the Catholic Church right so so with all these things already in we got a lot to look at here hey man there's a few that won't follow that we had a prophet go to Rome and refused to go see the Pope had a open invitation but walked out because they say I will not bow to kiss a man's ring I will not miss it if you want me to call them Reverend come on this I'll do that but I ain't bad I ain't kiss his ring I ain't doing none of that say cancel my appointment a prophet did that Oh glory to God ain't man hallelujah we didn't follow a message where a prophet did that we might be called upon to do the same thing no we're not gonna do Church doors may be shut because we won't go into yeah that's okay we're stepping on the words the word will bring us through let me just uh just kind of bring this in I gotta I gotta give you this you see I met this last quote daughter gonna read is not a legacy interchange and let me let me just drop this off before we before I go in there I just got a few more minutes then I'm gonna wine this up the angel was in corn riot was totally me zq9 said seal up those that sign and crying for the combination ascendancy it says now first there was instruction to go destroy but that ain't corn Rhonda was amongst those that were going to distress it now before you destroy seal up those in a sign and crying for the abomination that's in the city and there could be no killing in the city until there was a ceiling by Almighty God my brother Bradley say when was that when was that actually fulfilled he says when Titus the Roman general went into Israel Jesus even props out there come a day there'll be no stone left upon another one that the psycho say look at how beautiful the template say that's kind of the day there won't be a stone left on top of another you say don't know yet caught and the temple and things of that nature they say he said but they say when Jesus spoke that and Titus the Roman general came in and actually destroyed Jerusalem he said what Ezekiel was prophesied was for feel then glory to God he says but before that was actually fulfilled God did a mighty outpouring of the Holy Ghost amen into the upper room and when they received the Holy Ghost of the upper room that was the angel that a corn rider going through riding a man and building them with the Holy Ghost stealing them with the Holy Ghost hallelujah he said this was before the destruction of Jerusalem they meant that's the ceiling angel went for the steal with the Holy Ghost they received it on the day of Pentecost hallelujah I am so glad that God put a promise amen in his Bible that that that the poor the outpour the corner toe is for the last days not just a mint pinnacles but we should be expected it today glory to God when Jerusalem was about to be destroyed and I could say this whole world is about to be destroyed but before the destruction God sends the Angels a bring of stealing and greed not the Holy Spirit whereby I seal that's why we're praying for the Holy Ghost that's why we have meaning we've already been into this we don't kill the silly praise God and I'm claiming that fall over my lungs no killing - there's a ceiling over God glory that cop if it happened in Ezekiel 9 a man and God with hell things they're all we took to the time that Jesus came on the earth and the outpouring of the Holy Ghost amen there a man on the day of Pentecost where I'm the expectation for another outpoint another manifestation of Almighty God we can see destruction all over the land people dying everywhere a thousand may fall at my side ten thousand on my right side but it shall not come down my plane I'm expected all heaven to turn loose I'm looking for the sealing of God to take place in his people brother Branham say that that boxcar get seal it seal to his destiny shame glory to God glory to God father let let let a sealing take place in the people a true sealing of the Holy Ghost look at this if what they're telling us about Italy all these things are true we can see just through prophetic lens that there's more to this than what everybody else is seeing and I just want to just read your quotes so that you can understand no not not for us to operate in fear but we need to know where we stand as believers glory to God we need to know hysterically you didn't go back to some of these same messages that I'm I'm giving you you can go back and listen to what the prophets said Amen go back and read what the promises but get yourself prepared for this get yourself prepared amen don't let it catch you off guard but be prepared for what what God is getting rid of doing this out I'm under expectation mighty outpouring of the Holy Ghost not just for us love hallelujah oh I can expect it because the promise is up to me and to my children those are that are far off as many as the Lord our God shall call that's what God said text my my son-in-law this morning I said what was that virus that they said that what was the virus and he text me back and told me you know what this virus was and he said they call it a viral illness you know by repairs I said okay thank you sir yeah you know I'm gonna use that in my sermon this morning we don't without streaming service online the anomaly used that in my sermon deploy he said Kim what what else pretty repair so to say how we get on periscope so we can follow the service this morning it's good to have my son in service today add my daughter and my grandson in service the day praise the Lord God is good if this is the case I can easily see how our how our nation in the nations of this world will fall right underneath what the Catholic Church has been want to do all along and this prophecy according to Scripture that the Pope would rise as the Antichrist amen break he'll head you'll have the answer the Book of Daniel speaks of how he will cause a man thinks to prosper mine all these things are written in Scripture so we gotta watch all this winter when the economy's falling apart the Pope can come on and cause things to prosper I don't know about you but I'm looking forward to getting out of here before a lot of this stuff goes down so let's watch this leave a signature change even at the barbershop they're talking one-world water everybody knows about it they know the big words to put big buzz where it's been Illinois how it's all gonna come about you know when you reject the word you actually take on the mark of the beast yeah when you reject the truth you take on the market of Issa amen it's not going to be some some some tattoo on your forehead or something like that no it's just rejecting the Word of God look at what the Prophet says it says how fitting were the characteristics now this last age to represent the age in which we now live for example in worship one god Zeus who was the chief and father the gods this forecast the 20th century one Godfather of us all religious premise premise that set for the brotherhood of man and in his even now bringing together the process so this religious premise is what's bringing together the Protestants not told y'all they signed a document bringing everybody to get the exist I met just recently within the last year so says together Protestants Catholics Jews Hindus etc all religions of the world sign this document o says with the intent that a mutual form of worship will increase our love look at what the prophecy says understanding and care of each other it says the Catholics and Protestants are even now striving for an actual actually gaining ground in this union with the avowed intent that all others will follow this very attitude was seen in the United Nations organizations when the world leaders refused to recognize any one individual concept of spiritual worship but recommended putting aside all those separate concepts with the hopes that all religions become level into one for all desire the same goals all have the same purposes and all are basically right now the Prophet has warned us against this remember don't get your eye on the bamboo curtain don't put your eye a man on the iron curtain but you better be watching the purple curtain it says notice the main latest even the people's rights for justice other people's was there ever an aged like the 20th century church age that has seen all nations rising up and demanding equality socially and financially this is the age of the Communist age of the Communists that we when we when we look at quotes like this we always think in Russian China is a communist and we get all of our goods from where watch it now since says this is the age of the Communists were all men are supposedly equal though it is only so in theory it says this is the age of political parties who called themselves man see we don't cheapen Christianity so that all the person has to do is step up and confess out of their mouth and they do not change their lifestyle after the confession right no you're just gonna take more than a confession out of your mouth you gonna have to live like Jesus amen after you confess that he died for your sins Amen glory to God listen it says it says they caught who called themselves Christian Democrats and Christian socialists Christian Commonwealth Federation etc according to our liberal theologians Jesus was a socialist and the early church under the guidance of the Spirit practice socialism and thus we ought to do so today when the ancients called Laodicea the metropolis it was looking forward to the one-world government and this is brother branham's going back into history now the latest Ian see Frank and all the things that they were going through that same spirit that was in that city is not a breakfast didn't in the end time he says when the ancients Carletta see the metropolis it was looking for - the one-world government that we're now setting up as we think of that city being the location of a great church council we see foreshadowed the echod miracle move taken place today when very soon we will see all the so-called Christians come together nd the church and state religion and politics are coming together now with a with the spread of something like this can't you see how easy it is for everybody just to come again yeah put us down all of our differences we want everybody protect it we won't ever let us see let's just come together right he says that religion and politics are coming together the tears are being bound the week will soon be ready for the garden now he's quoting the scripture will read this this is about a Matthew 13 and 30 Oh glory to God let both grow together until the harvest and in the time of the harvest Matthew 13 and 30 so then the time of the harvest I will sneak to the repossessed angels that's angels for the RAM Matilda that's angels gather you together first the tares and bind them in bundles you know come together by unfounded bundles to burn down destruction but gather the wheat into my barn and brother Branham is telling us very clearly we're seeing the tears being bound together but the wheat will soon be ready for the garner Church I don't know about you but I'm looking forward to getting out of here I know that God has sent us a prophet to forewarn us and many of these things we can see that this is a spiritual thing that we're facing and it's going to take a man spiritual weapons and or overcome their mighty through God through the pulling down of strongholds and I'm just under expectation I gotta read their music you're not before there was a killing there had to be a sealing a man I'm expecting God to do something he's gonna bring somebody in now somebody's about to be restored now you know what they can't even help themselves they want to stay out there in the world but they realize no there's something more to this and as I read that I said on Wednesday night you know many people waiting on the prophecy that God told brother Billy Paul before you become an old man sharks that be swimming when you stand there well that happened actually 70s and 80s there was an earthquake that hit Los Angeles and and the main building where brother brother Billy won't stand in front of a building they sent out a memo saying do not go into the basement there are sharks swimming in the basement so why are you waiting on scripture to be for feel or you waiting on prophecy to be fulfilled don't fail to recognize that some things have already happened I say get right Church then let's go on amen if you don't know Jesus scripture tells you repent be baptized that name of Lord Jesus Christ what a missionary says you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the pen of everything that you've done wrong that's been against God for a just repent right where you are tell god you're sorry amen that's what repentance tell God you sir and as you repent of your look you were born wrong if you say no no you were born into this world a sinner you came into this world a man a liar they meant shaped and sandboard and shake them shake them iniquity born into sin came into the world speaking lies so all of us had to repent of something every last one of us hallelujah so as we repent the Bible said be baptized not in father son Holy Ghost would be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is the name of the Father is the name of the son is a name and all must be baptized we you shall receive the gift of oils amen and grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby you are steal until the day of redemption that's instructions for being prepared for this great out let's pray father we thank you Lord for this time of worship time of service God how I just appreciate the opportunity to share the Word of God with your people we've been relegated to having service like this board at this time but God we know that you're still at work even in the midst of all of this we're going to see your mighty hand the Prophet told us when all hail begin to break loose then all heaven would also break loose so we're on the expectation to see that father I pray for this church Lord as many have lord have come

and divine protection Lord that you are just watch over the people and we realize look the holy safety is in Christ so help us to bring ourselves underneath the blood Lord of the Lord Jesus Christ
