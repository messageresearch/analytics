to the service I have to listen to the whole service not just the the preaching but I listened to everything I start from the beginning to the very end and and and and I was just very very blessed by a sister dasa I said before I'll say it again I was blessed she did an excellent job I felt that many of the the song leading brother Solomon it puts us in a place where she could be successful and

a lot on our plate but by God's grace a man we are still pressing the battle and I know coming up some of the meetings and everything that's planned it's gonna be a very very busy summer but you know I look forward so all that I never had the thought I wish it was no more meetings never think like that I never think like that because one day we're gonna go to a meeting that'll never end right we gonna intend to there you know you ever you remember the song there is going to be a meeting in the air in the sweet sweet by-and-by alright and I don't know about y'all but I'm looking forward to that great meeting and what I'm doing is just kind of getting myself prepared all you need a man if you ever feel like man I just can't take another meet and I just saw but it's just too much on me all you need is a body change that's all you need right if you get a body change you won't feel what you feeling right now come on somebody a man and that's what's gonna happen we're gonna we're gonna enter that body change would be able to worship and praise God like brother Justin they said he says he said you know we want to make room for the preacher to come we thank God for the singing but we want to make room for the preacher to company say the reason we make room for the preachers now is because when we get to the other side we won't need preachers it says so we want to make room for the preachers now because they'll do all the worship over they say so what we got to do is make room for the preacher so we can make preparation for the singers to get to the other side to sing yeah amen so I said yeah I agree with that you know and we just we certainly think don a man for that so this morning we just got a little something in our heart a man that uh that the Lord just kind of placed there I got a like a notebook full of thoughts and and when I start kind of going through the notebook I'm like look what thought do you want fun today all right I got all these thoughts but what one do you want for right now you know what what are the people going through there to help them now for this moment and you know so we're just waiting on the Lord and and one of the brothers happened to send out a little quote there brother Mike early this week and when I got the cold I said kid I think I got what I'm supposed to do so sometimes we don't know how God uses little things a man just to speak and give comfort and a man and just just kind of solidify where we're we're we're to be so I pray God will use a man this little thought today a man I'm sorry didn't get the sisters name sister brown told me about a sister that she was inviting amen substantially all right so good to have you with us today god bless you sister Angela a man a man certainly good to have you in fellowship with us a man if you all wouldn't mind stand to your feet with me we will read a man the word of the Lord a man I want to read from actually to passage of Scripture on today a man and maybe what I'll do here is I'll read from the Old Testament then the New Testament well let's go to Exodus chapter 40 there'll be a number of verses here then we'll go to 2nd Corinthians 5:17 and let's just see where the Lord will take us amen here today praise the Lord a man hallelujah a man a man a man a man by God a man exodus chapter 40 I'm thanking God when I say thank you Lord I'm like thank you for the new church and thank you for the new school and thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you Amen hallelujah we'll remember these days or it would be on the other side talking about a man but here Exodus 40 it says in the Lord speaking the Moses saying on the first day of the first month show thou set up the tabernacle of the ten of the congregation and thou shalt put there in the Ark of the testimony and cover the Ark with the veil and thou shalt bring in the table and set in order to things that are to be set in order upon it and thou shalt bring in the candlestick and light the lamps thereof and thou shalt set the altar of gold for instance before the Ark of the testimony and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle and thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation and thou just set the ladder between the tent of the congregation and the altar and it shall put water therein and thou shalt set up the court roundabout and hang up the hanging at the court and thou shalt take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle and all that is therein and shall hallow it and all the vessels thereof and it shall be holy and thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering and all his vessels and sanctify the altar and it shall be an altar most holy and thou shalt anoint the ladder and his foot and sanctified and thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and wash them with water Amen let's uh turn over here to second Corinthians five a man in verse 17 here in 2nd Corinthians 5 praise the Lord they familiar passage here in 2nd 2nd Corinthians 5 2nd Corinthians 5 verse 17 says the for If any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new amen the Lord at a blessing to the reading of his word let's just bow in a word of Prayer father we are grateful for the privilege and the opportunity to read the word of the Lord God we pray that the Holy Spirit will bring inspiration upon the things that we have read here today God may you make your were real two hearts make the difference in every life pray that the Spirit of God would have the preeminence a man and all that we speak of today in Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you can be seen amen so we want to just take for a topic today it's an inside job it's an inside job and as I was just referring to this little quote that was shared earlier this week I want to start off by reading this out of the message the identification of Christ and all ages amen identification of Christ and all ages says the Prophet says I just passed my birthday last Monday and I was 55 years old you know the Brandon family never did asked me to join the family I was born a Branham a man and that's how that's how we are Christians we're just born a Christian by the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and we are Christians by birth hallelujah you're not a Christian by association hey man you're Christian by birth we were talking a little bit about that in Sunday school you know the Jews a man because of their religious order they felt like they were somebody a man the Philadelphia Church age because they joined church they thought that they were somebody a man but we learned out it's not about just joining church but it's about coming into Christ's hallelujah a man in the Philadelphia age their problems that they felt just joining church was enough and we have the same spirit that has settled in this day because people feel like just because they go to a message Church hallelujah Amen that that's enough it's not about coming into the church but it's about coming into Christ hallelujah amen we want to we want to make sure we're taking the people deeper we're happy to have you in church amen but if you never come into Christ you'll always have problems hallelujah you'll never have an overcoming life unless you come fully into Christ hallelujah amen and let me tell you something we'll be really coming to Christ amen all of us should act to sing all of us should be looking the same when we're really coming to Christ when we're all governing amen our life according to his word amen it should produce the same behaviors in all of us brother an and say the Holy Ghost will not behave itself in me and then misbehave itself in you that's not the same Holy Ghost it might be a ghost but not the Holy Ghost closer to God somebody a man you've got to be born into this thing all right come on now we're just born a Christian by the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and we are Christians by birth that that makes us new creatures and I like this in our old nature we can never be Christians now let's not just kind of skip over these things in our own nature let me just put it this way if you consider yourself a Christian a man you ought to be able to identify that there was an old nature you had to be converted from something and actually everybody was a liar because you were born into a speaking lives a man you had all kind of attributes of sin that were manifested itself inside of your flesh honey but will you become a Christian we should see the attributes of God and his characteristics being manifested inside some flesh all right somebody you had to come from something your nature should have changed if your nature didn't change we have a problem hallelujah oh yeah all that happens is you just become a pig a man with a tuxedo on you know what happened with a pig with a tuxedo on hallelujah it made you brother Westco used to tell us all the time you pull them out the muck it man you get them out amen the hog pen and you put this tuxedo on them and and you put some cologne or some perfume on that pig and man's nice smelling Pig but as soon as you let the pee go hallelujah the pig will find its way right back to that same old Pigpen again Oh hallelujah you just can't change the pig on the outside this is the inside char come on somebody soon as the trial comes that nature will kick in and what God wants to do is kill that nature change that nature oh yeah amen rather than going back to what you used to do to the old nature you do something new and God makes you a new creature howl you know you know if God delivers you from smoking and drinking if if your nature doesn't change it soon as a trial come you go back right back to smoking and drink it don't take you long oh come on somebody amen you'll be in the stove before you know it I asking for them to get you on the PAC's on the top shelf praise the Lord can I tell you something you know when you're drinking and smoking on the outside and look good but on the inside you killing yourself hallelujah amen when you died from cirrhosis of the liver you can't see them live on the outside but on the inside you're killing yourself hallelujah amen when you got some some issue going on with your heart on the inside you're killing yourself from the cigarette smoke oh praise God this is an inside job the devil trying to destroy your inside and God trying to build you up all right let me finish reading this quote here I want to want to just kind of share a little bit more hey Manny says this hallelujah that makes us new creatures in our own nature we could never be Christians that's the reason they we have so many calling themselves Christians and live in any kind of life I told you this quote was given to me I ain't even find this when they just gave it to me amen you so many calling themselves Christians and living any kind life they never experienced that born-again that's something that changes you a man that takes the life out like pulling the blood out of a man that's got a certain type of blood and putting another type in him it's pulling the old life out of the man and inject him the life of Christ in the believer and then he becomes a new creation he's a new creature now you'll never be a new creature unless your manifest in the life of Christ Oh hallelujah see your old nature survive I should have died amen if you call yourself a Christian your own nature should've died the things that you used to do you shouldn't want to do anymore I know that sound good preaching amen the things you used to do you shouldn't want to do anymore if you still have a desire to do those things something went wrong somewhere hallelujah oh I feel good hey man yeah you know this week we'll went to the meet and the brother preached the message on salvation came to a convention and preach salvation I say wow what a sermon right because you know he was making some comments about you know when you really look at church we got a lot of head knowledge amen but our lives are not measuring up with the words glory to God hallelujah we want real Christians amen true Christianity something that changed on the inside because if it changes on the inside then it will truly reflect itself on the outside hallelujah glory to God let me go on a little further Paul a man was changed from the inside and Paul he once was a persecutor of the Christians but he became the messenger to the first Gentile Church age he was made a new creature by what happened to him on the inside he made a statement here in Galatians 2:20 he says I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not i but Christ liveth in me now look at look at this he says yet not i but Christ liveth in me and I like this and the life which I now live can you statement the life which I now live what it says is that I used to live something else Amen I used to be a different person until I came in contact with Christ and if you can't share the same testimony that Paul is sharing then you need to make contact with Jesus Christ the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me the life I now live which means now he lives something different than what he used to live hallelujah amen let me go on to another quote here out of you must be born again Oh glory to God this it's an inside job it's got to happen on the inside Amen listen he says do you know what you got an Old Crow don't matter how much you try to you could paint them just this olive color as a dove you got a crow that you're trying to paint and make a dove get getting start here now just as gray as a dove white paint them all over he's still a crow inside a man see he's still stinky and old Buzzard just the same scavenger eat the dead things of the earth amen glory that's right but you know what dove don't even have to take a bath watch this now Oh hallelujah a doves body because he is a dove he's got an oil that comes through his feathers that just keeps him clean all the time because it comes from the inside out what we're trying to do is do this thing from the outside in but God wants to work from the inside out watch it now it says all right I better say mine too I put a little holy water on them brother it fixed it no it didn't for it for it comes from the inside out not from the outside in it's a birth blessed God I go to church the same as you - hallelujah my church is as good as yours how will you all right you Buzzard see that's right a dog is all from the inside there's a certain Glen and a dog that's not in any other bird like that that I have or pigeon and he owns himself a man I say he keeps herself clean I like that he keeps herself clean all the time now you know that that that means something to me that means something me you know some folk whose their Christianity when they leave town y'all they gonna talk to me amen as soon as they leave West Palm Beach glory another nature comes out hallelujah somebody a man another nature just rise up you thought nobody saw you but see when something happens on the inside it don't matter where I go it don't matter who can I preach this morning Amen that nature keeps me clean amen it's something that starts on the inside reflects itself on the outside I don't have to worry about whether my back line Oh glory to God hey man you know I got something inside that keep me no matter where I met I can go anywhere in this world and be kept is that all right I can go anywhere in this world and be kept not I don't have to be afraid of the devil gonna get me and we'll soar soar in here so I can no no no no it don't matter whether the pastor they're not amen the Holy Ghost is there huh glory to God I a man you ain't gonna have my testimony ain't gonna be ruined in five minutes hello I'm not gonna allow myself to my testimony be ruined you know I'm just talking to a pastor a man they went to this city I

think it was Indonesia Indonesia so they went here the Indonesian is like man we going on holiday he say took his mother-in-law with them and and everything he's saying and and when you get there to

Brandon made a statement say the music that you listen to when you ain't with nobody else he say the music say a lot about you now I'm not saying if the pastor got in your car you change the radio station or you turn it down real low hallelujah but God know what you listening to you know I know some people they turn it up real high when they get around the Saints you ain't listening to that when the Saints inside he say the magazine's that you read the literature that you read it tells a lot about what's on the inside of you hallelujah he said that I go into the office of a businessman and I feel the pictures that he got hanging in his office he's a vulgar pinups he says I can tell what you are feeding on we gotta have something to change on the inside glory to God glory to God if you feeding on Scripture you put scriptures up huh hey man put some scriptures up around your desk let people know what you identify with Oh glory everybody has got all kind of the nonsense once you put a scripture there something that encourages your heart what you feed know a man church you know and you have a hard time wearing a shirt a man with Christian words the Scriptures or whatever a man

just take the devil walk doctor the devil gonna make it easy for you to get into an environment like that and then your Christian is compromised all right I'm going on I'm going on I'm I'm just saying it's an inside job if something something got to happen on the inside it's got to happen on the inside from the beginning of time God showed that the focus must be on the inside you know I was listening to this little radio drama man I was I was blessed by and a little app there from the force of God amen and they were doing a radio drama on Noah and as they were just kind of talking about how Noah had a friend come to this house in light he said no you know if God spoke to you if if if this was really God he said you kind man he says I know that if my family I know you love me you love my family you can't man and I know that you'll open up the art if God spoke to you in this thing if this rain come like you promised and everything I said I know you open up the ark for me because you love me no he saying say say it's not me opening or closing the art is God doing that hallelujah so he say say no I you know that and you can hear on the drama how the rain start coming and this man knocking on the outside knocking on the other I told you it's an inside job if he would have been inside the ark he wouldn't had to been knocking hallelujah Amen from the beginning of time God showed that things must be done on the inside only those that were inside the ark was spared hallelujah and today only those that are inside of Christ not just because you go to a message search not just because you believe God sent a prophet that's just like saying one plus one equal to anybody can say that hallelujah amen you can quote a few quotes from the Prophet right you can read a few scriptures from the Bible but unless something that happened to you on the inside it does not matter I'm going on a little further from the days of North you had to be inside the Ark in the days of rehab being related to rehab wasn't good enough huh I mean when rehab rehab rehab is my auntie uh-huh what Joshua said fine everybody's related to you and bring them into the house and as long as they in the house this house won't be destroyed now you can be outside in the city talk about how a hi Rahab had all these visitors and they made her promise and that's why that scarlet thread is in hell you can be telling everybody about the message hello somebody but unless you get inside Rahab's house when destruction comes you were gonna be destroyed hallelujah amen this is an inside job you've got to be in Christ all right all right all right if you want to experience up a room you have to be in the upper room hello somebody all right and see you know the other thing that I look at here you know let me just read a little something here from you for you a man this is either the message the supernatural the Prophet makes a statement says I was preaching not long ago the tape recorders here the boys was with me they took a sermon on the hidden life of Christ how to get into Christ and how that some people has ups and downs some people has ups and downs a man it's a place you have to find that out of course produced manna sure many people are living right in that manner they eat in the manna but they don't live the right kind of a life a man it says there there up and down they have ins and outs and bad days and good days but you meet people that absolutely no matter what the weather was or what the condition was there on the housetop all the time he's found that secret he's found an atmosphere to live in I like this because we're trying to get everybody in this place right I mean you know you can live in a place where you ain't got to be in and out up and down all the time you ain't got to have the testimony oh my god the testimony Amen everybody you don't want everybody looking at you wondering when you're gonna fall huh that's not the life to live God got higher life than that amen where you gonna leave the next time how long it's gonna last you're gonna have a life like that right amen and the reason that you have a life like that's because you have not allowed Christ to come inside some of us are satisfied being on the outside some of us Sam stop being associated with this thing but God wants to have a real genuine fellowship with you he wants to live inside you can get to a level in your life were you always on top you know I'm not bragging and I know that you know you got to be careful cuz you know you brag too much take heat less you fall but but but I would say this I've tried to live life that people expect me to always overcome no matter what kind of church would this be if the pastor down again passed out again oh I'll just bear with me I just I just got to get this stuff off my out of my spirit you know the brother was telling back and see you you want a pastor with the Holy Ghost hello that wherever he go is gonna keep and and and some time I believe brothers could have the Holy Ghost but you need refill it's you you need to always stay in the presence of God it was telling about our brother one time and God fit God God forgive me I don't want to talk about people but you know he got away went out to preach the gospel but when he got out there he got caught in some sin they got caught him saying he did something that just got he just completely got exposed and see the devil always set you up like that you think because they know about around that you can get by with it oh my but see I mean you you want to pastor that when you can trust them in Ely town that when they come back he not bringing a negative testimony with him can I say something i pastor one people in its church that when they leave town they're not coming back with a negative testimony we want to church that's clean a man I mean no sin can hide glory to God Amen a church where know everybody gotta have a hidden life in Christ hallelujah not just the one on the outside but the one on the inside hidden life wit Christ listen he goes on to say this in the Old Testament how that the congregation was fed from bread out of heaven they lived in three different atmospheres in the courts and they're the manna fell and the Israelites eat manna he eat the same manner they did at every other place same manner but remember that inside the courts in the art was a place fixed where the manna never did get Old Glory otherwise it got oh it wouldn't last to nine o'clock in the morning they grind it up into inter meal and make some cakes out of it and eat it and they find out before the Sun went down they were hungry if they didn't gather enough listen and that's what's the matter with people today they got campground cramps campground cramps they go to a revival and have a great time oh I'm preaching real good we get ready to have some meetings glory and everybody get excited about the meetings and I think you should go to the meetings with an expectation we're looking for God to meet you at the meeting but after the meeting over we still looking for God to meet you you got Campground cramps listen he says they go to revival they have a great time the first thing you know a little after that before another revival could come along they're back in the world again god help us we don't want that type of testimony let God do something on the inside and we won't have that kind of testimony hallelujah the same way that you are willing to allow God to do things on the outside you willing to dress the part once you go a little further and now let him open up your heart and like Lord come on in and work on this I reminded of the story of the the man that you know he invited the Lord Jesus into this house and they said now you can come in and say but this room right here this is your room don't come out this room at all this is it that's all he that's what he said this is your bedroom don't come out and it says okay and so you know that later on that night the man got a visit from the devil and man there was a big struggle going on the house furniture flying all over the place and you know and this man just getting beat to a pulp by the devil and the next morning he get up and he just he all bandaged and wounded and and Jesus comes out in his day he say how come you didn't come down and help me stay because you told me to stay in this room right here and what we learned is what we've done is placed boundaries on the Lord Jesus there's only certain places he can go in our life God wants to get rid of every sin every open door that the devil has where he can pull you back into those old places again God wants to free you from all that can I just say we can't just play it apart this thing got to be an inside thing and let me tell you something each one of us got to have an inside experience come on somebody every person in here has to have it you ain't just because your mama go to church don't make you a Christian I want to just talk to you today just just because your mom or your sister your daddy that don't make you a Christian you got to have your own personal experience with God and it's got to be something on the inside I'm gonna tape when the trials come in to tell whether it's on the inside I read that Scripture law earlier let me just see here oh now let me before I go back that scripture let me I got I got a I got a read a quote and did I get back to that scripture I want to just share with see your heart is a hidden organ it's a hidden organ nobody sees it but have the way that we can tell what's in your heart is by what we what we flex outside and your external organs right the things that you do externally tell us what's actually inside your heart see this says your inner man is morning and I want to tell you this your inner man is more important than your outer man glory to God your outer man only reflects what is truly happening in the inner man oh my you know what you want to know where that curse word come came from can III might as well assist I'm here I might as well see this you know I follow some of y'all on social media don't I'm reading that okay Kevin are you understanding what I'm saying the pastor had to read that not not only that can I go a little further the pastor had to see that picture some pictures don't need to be posted some statements don't need to be made no matter how wrong they are it's just truth I'm just speaking truth right now me I'm hearing some things you don't need to say hallelujah Christians are reading that and from my Amen assumption you a Christian so you should leave me posting it all right all right all right imagine if Jesus was reading it imagine if Jesus was seeing it I feel like saying some stuff in here I'll tell you what you know imagine if Jesus was seeing it that that little post that you got you know the sexy one the sexy one what would Jesus think of it Jesus look at this Lord Jesus was expecting to say what do you expect him to say I'm just trying to get us to see we you know we we need it we need a fresh baptism we need a fresh touch from God and let me tell you somethin less this thing happened on the inside if it don't happen on inside you keep doing the same thing over and over and over again what you think that you know when when brother Branham went to to Africa and he preached one time never even preached a man about how two sisters was supposed to dress never said nothing but he just he just preached him the Holy Spirit came in and and sisters that was there amen you know just breast feeding their babies it was a very natural thing for them to do that you know and now he say he said he say he say they they came to service one way but the next service they don't know where they got it from they found clothes to put on and he never preached today what was it the holy ghost made the difference inside these people's hallelujah and we say we got the Holy Ghost and we show less clothing we might as well say these things I found out if we don't say from the pulpit it just it just becomes acceptable and I want to say today it's not acceptable something got that happened on the inside just because you're part of a certain Church don't make you nothing your brother said this week you know just because you in the garage that don't make you no car you just stand in the garage hallelujah you just come in the church but we want to be we want real Christians and this thing got that happened on the inside my prayers that after you leave here today you start working on the inside so so many of us are so concerned about the outside then pictures that we post all you doing is showing the outside you showing how you look on the outside hallelujah but when you're putting a picture up there by yourself you just kind of giving us a scripture or you giving us a quote from what the Prophet said or something like that encourage our spirits now you're dealing with the inside and I found out a long time ago people don't like scripture quotes as much as they like your pictures now they see they just don't like it you get less like some scripture or artwork from the Prophet that you do on a picture let me put a picture of me and my wife everybody and then I turn right back around you know some be Jesus oh just a few few comments everybody want to comment about the natural stuff the outside external stuff but nobody wanna work on the inside this is an inside job let me go on praise the Lord I feel all right this morning can so let me let me okay this this quote I want to read here out of pride a pride a pride the Prophet says so a hypocrite an imposter he can go to the world and affiliate with the world and act like the world and live in the world and enjoy the pleasures of the world and come to church and pretend to be a Christian but the real Christian it's what he say the real Christian can go into the world and come back there's something wrong show me your company I would tell you who you are let me go into your house and see what you read let me listen see what kind of news that you have playing let me see what kind of magazines what kind of literature you read let me look in your office and see if it's a big bunch of these focal pictures of pinups and things and you tell me you're a Christian now this is what this is just a part that I like you tell me your Christian I won't say nothing to you wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute so the Prophet just saw something in your room the Prophet just saw something in your house the Prophet just heard some music in your car and he won't even say anything to you I won't even say anything to you I'd watch what'd she say he says but in my heart I will watch what kind of fruit you're barren see cuz that's your diet I like that now if I was wrong one of the pastor just tell me no God oh you so I might see something I won't like it I see you posted I won't like it I can't like that no no no I don't even want my name associated with a picture like that no some pictures I don't even want them to know you go to this church they actually who your past oh no don't tell him don't tell max it make it seem like I'm preaching nothing huh praise the Lord was like no no he said he'll see these things and won't even tell you because God got to deal with you about that see it's an inside job listen he says tell me you're Christian I won't say nothing to you but my in my heart I'll watch what kind of fruit you bear because your diet oh you say I belong to church well now you know business judging me brother branham I'm not judging you the word is judging you that's right your fruit your life tells what you are and I were a little statement the manifestation of the fruit on the outside reflect the nature of what's actually inside I don't care how much you say your orange tree you know and you got it you see if you don't know your fruit you think a grapefruit is an orange you get but you got to know your fruit look I mean it's County in the same family but i but i but when you go and you you peel this orange you eat the oranges it's a little sweet but you feel that grapefruit you go to taste it and got the same type of skin on the inside and everything you go taste that grapefruit it's bitter you got to know your fruit I mean and what I've learned to do is that you can tell me your orange treat all you want but if I see you producing grapefruit I'm not gonna sit and argue with you about you being no orange no you're not you're not an orange your grapefruit I know what you I know my fruit hey if you not careful you Pete I thought of lemon wasn't orange or a line wasn't orange no no you got to know your fruits praise the Lord I know what a Christian is and what a Christian is it I don't care Christians today are the same they worth 50 years ago all right I said this is this is an out of court if you know this we read the scripture I read it out of Exodus 40 when I read that amen if you would just notice let's read it again hey man I want you to look at that notice when God gives him the instructions to bill man the tabernacle what God does is start with the insight and works outside hallelujah Amen and here's the problem many of us want to work the outside and come inside but when God establishes things he starts from the inside and then works outside hallelujah this is an inside job look at it hallelujah amen the scripture says the Lord speaking to Moses saying on the first day of the first month shall I set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation and thou shalt put there in the Ark of the testimony and cover art with the veil what is this this is the most holy place a man this is where the Ark of the I mean actually where they had the cherubim sitting over amen the mercy seat and they're in this aren't ahead of the law you know of Moses that the Ten Commandments have said this is the most holy place that had to be set up first oh my goodness the most holy place look at a night it goes on to say this and thou shalt bring in the table and settle order things that are to be set up set in order Punnett and thou shalt bring in the candlestick and light the lamps thereof and thou shalt set the altar go for the incense before the Ark of the testimony and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle this is you know what we're looking at here is the inner court hallelujah amen he started first with the most holy place then he start working on the inner court oh my god wants to work from the inside out Amen not the outside in God is moving from the inside out because what is on the inside will reflect itself on the outside hallelujah Amen just don't be satisfied being a Christian hanging around the outside of the church Amen God wants to do something on the inside of your life look at he goes on a little further here in verse verse six he says and thou shall set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle the tent of the congregation and thou just set the lever amen between the ten of the congregation and the altar shall put water there and what they did with the lavra and everything and this is where they brought their sacrifices to be washed amen they were bringing them a mint to this brass flower and their sacrifice to be washed out here but this was what we considered the outer courts Oh hallelujah you know when God set this up he also set up to a place where a man only the high priest could go into that inner court amen the most holy place let me put that the high priest once a year could go into that most holy place going to God but when Jesus died on the cross amen the temple veil was ripped on the inside exposing what was only inside which brother Brennan said it was death if a person went in there and they were not the high priest in Old Testament time but today hallelujah amen it's back to you if you never go all the way into that place with Christ don't be satisfied just being a church member God wants to do something on the inside don't hang in the outer courts don't hang in the intercourse but go requites [Applause] we establish when you read that script he established that the most holy place first that's where God want a fellowship what I said the holiest of holies established first to enter court was established secondly the outer Court was established thirdly and unlike this when Jesus rose again the process started in the grief in the grief right there was something happening on the inside Amen the tomb might have been Amen they feel the tomb but but but but after they settle to him inside what was happening he descended into hell he lose those that were wrongfully imprisoned and if the devil got you in prison this morning hallelujah Christ has come set you free from the inside you know you know some folk some folk can be in church but inside they still battling all kind of stuff your your body is here your body is here but your mind ain't you hadn't really reached the spot where you free okay can I just be let me let me also go a little further so much happy to be identified with just coming to church and when you come you think we all suppose like do something special because you here let out a rant copied you hear what that mean hallelujah after you leave here what kind of life you lived in oh we happy to see you come but I'm gonna be happier when I when I see you go living the way you supposed to be living huh Oh glory and I don't want you to just get can I put it this way a Sunday morning dress you dress for the occasion on Sunday morning but soon that service is over you don't went right back to that old lifestyle when that's gonna change you know if this was the last sermon you heard because you died on the morrow you know what you would not be able to stand before God and say you ain't hurtin it the Holy Ghost warned you today this thing got to change on the inside hallelujah the outer court was established thoroughly alright when Jesus Jesus rose again the process starting to grade they sealed a tomb he descended hell loose those that were wrongfully wrongfully in prison and then after that he appeared to the disciples so many others externally could see a man that that was proof of the resurrection so things started inside the grave before they manifested outside God need to do some things inside your heart and let me tell you once he's done it inside it will manifest itself outside let me go on a little further I got a this just really blessed my heart as I was reading this particular scripture out of Exodus 40 when God established a man when they established the tabernacle he had Moses build from the inside out and here's the thing we always approached it from the out of course that's justification that's just water baptism right folk get baptized in water and and I can almost if I was to raise my if I was actually people how many y'all been baptized in water I'm almost a whole church to raise ahem I've been baptized the name of Lord Jesus Christ but that's all you did was got baptized the Bible say it repent be baptized name Lord Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and I'm gonna tell you when you get the Holy Ghost it changes things we're not just on the outside inside many of us we got we got in a court religion which is sanctification we don't change the way we dress that's about all we got hallelujah but we want to get to the most holy place Amen where you have received a baptism of the Holy Ghost and this just don't change the way you dress this changes your nature I was talking to a brother this week and we talked about receiving Holy Ghost well yeah why y'all want the Holy Ghost so much because you just want to lay hands on people you want to pray for people no no no no we're trying to get rid of that nature that nature you got that's fussing and arguing with us right now the Holy Ghost come to take out that nature the Holy Ghost to stop you from cursing huh the only goes to stop you from smoking stopped you from drinking the Holy Ghost that changed everything about you you understand the Holy Ghost is his nature it's not your nature anymore it's his nature so what you saw Christ Erwin should be reflected in and through you now oh my god we're not just trying to lay hands on folk we try to get their nature changed oh my let me read let me read oh Jesus Jesus Jesus hidden life in Christ this is paragraph 18 oh thank you Lord says now in Old Testament there was what they called the out of course we watch what was in the out of course then there was a holy place or the first valve that inside of the Holies of Holies and what furniture was in the outer court what was at the veil of the holy place of what was in the holiest of Holies now we're going to speak tonight on the holiest of Holies the dwelling place where God Himself - well then days he dwelt in his tabernacle and today he dwells in you as his tabernacle but we must make this place a dwelling not an outer court place or the first holy place but we must live with God in the holiest of Holies consecrated hidden life alone quiet with God we become too excited upset about too many things it shows there's something lacking the church ought to be a million miles up the road to what it is now I like what the prophecy we could become upset about too many things brother was sharing a testimony yesterday just bless my heart and I just wonder how I would have respondent said he was in the car and this guy by cut him off on the highway and he was big Alamos he said if he wouldn't move this car over the guy would have knocked his mirror off so he moved the car over and he said he you know got control of the car and say he blew at the man is like man you almost just ran me off the road so then a little later on he pulls up and he's on the side of the guy and it got kind of waited for him to get down the side and as soon as he got to the side side got a let down his wind and took a cup of ice and just threw it out the window and say all he heard just something hitting his car then I say it took a lot not the one to take his car and RAM the man car hallelujah some of us would be in jail right now come on we had to be honest we'd be we being Jimmy you know he just hit my cowardice that's all it is is ice no but he should have hit my car Benoist we get upset about too many things yeah I realize y'all got an enemy right his name is the devil this is why we meet mo holy ghost the more the spirit of God a man filling us and refilling us so that we don't be responding like this getting upset by anything anything oh they can't talk to me that way well who you I just had to have a prayer I had to have a prayer I said Lord you would have mishandled you were done dirty wrong and your response was Lord forgive them for they know not what they do God give me that heart I need your heart dawg where I can pray the same thing again and we just like to call everybody our enemies everybody everybody your enemy everybody my god you married to that person that's not your enemy you said yes that's not your enemy hallelujah glory to God Church but we get to the fourth this is my enemy God my enemy no no no you know I'm gonna tell you who your greatest enemy is relevancy package is overcoming this guy William Branham and what we need is to overcome ourselves we our biggest problems hallelujah I'm almost I'm coming home we need that we need to live with godness Holies of Holies a consecrated hidden hidden life alone quiet with God we become too excited upset about too many things it shows there something like in the church ought to be a million miles up the road to do I mean to a wrote to what it is now we're still back down in adolescent H fussing fighting quarreling stewing when we ought to be consecrated here away in the holiest of Holies with God it's better that we come easy take our time see where we're going it's better to come easy don't fight against God all right I mean we need to like be light lamp share all our rights away God take this from me empty this out clean my life up I want to be more like you hallelujah each person need to do their own personal inventory there's a story that the Prophet told he went to this place and he was preaching he said man he was preaching hard there was a man that come to the meeting he was coming he was coming to actually shut the Prophet down he didn't want him preaching and when he when he come to the meeting set me up for paragraph II 38 in and hidden life in Christ actually hold on one second no no I'm sorry I'm sorry not not that paragraph he 92 and letting off the pressure just just said it there don't pull it up yet but he went to the me and he he come with an attitude that you know what I'm gonna I'm gonna shut this meeting down I don't want brother Branham preaching and I'm gonna shut this down and says the man came to the meeting and when he got there rather than shut things down brother Branham had an altar call he was the first one to come to the altar and to be prayed for he says I want to give my heart to the Lord Jesus and and and and when the man you know come running up to the altar just trying to figure out what had happened but you know after he gave his heart to the Lord then he he gave a testimony and in the testimony he made a comment here and I and I want to read this to you this is out of paragraph letting off the pressure he 92 says the next day the next night he come up there setting in there with his little children his little boy come up a little bit he fell about five years old said brother branham said we got a we got a good daddy now now notice when the man came to the altar and gave his heart to the Lord even his children could actually see a difference in their daddy can I ask you a question do your children notice that there's been a change inside of you not only that does the dog notice it the cat do they notice the change that God has done inside of you I don't care how much you say I've been changed I've been changed I'm in change everything but you're still bearing the same fruit and we're not gonna argue with you look at it look at it Oh sometimes they pass the back say it say it I want to hear the church they pass the back pass the back that go out on the field I can be like an evangelist when I come here I got to be pastor I got to be pastor and you know and trust me you know there I believe brother brother smiley hit it last week you know sometimes things happen you and somebody come up here and preach and you'd be like man God did that God God showed them that God's God used that message for me ain't no way they knew about that that was God that was God and there are other times that you know we'll come up here like it was in the book of Corinthians where this man wasn't living in sin with his I believe it's a stepmother right he's living in sin and and and this sin that this man's living in Paul addresses it hallelujah and I want to tell you it was still God when Paul was addressed and even after he knew just because he didn't know huh and he said some about it don't make it more God it's still God no and I'm gonna tell you another thing that God does God gives you a little grace to work on some things hallelujah now you can read between the lines God give you grace to work on some things hey man you know what you need to work on each one of us need to work hallelujah this is an inside job and don't be praying it you know what you think I know no go to God Lord what do you want to share from me hey man you might not look like your friend after God finished with you because your example now is not the word your example is your friend and your convictions are based on how your friend is

at this his little boy come up his little bitty about five year five years old it's a brother branham we got a good daddy now so every night he'd come in and get drunk and whip us and everything but I said tonight we all asked a blessing at the table he passed from death unto life just before I got ready to preach he said brother Branham would you spare me a moment till I could say something said I said yes sir come on up here brother and I want to taste something you know even the Prophet let folk come up to say things I've done that too and some time old Lord you want to say good God Almighty why did they have to say that cut that from the tape but the profit louder look at this it says says yes they're coming up here brother he said he come up there said I was once dead but I'm alive now he said everything's changed for me said I had a dream last night brother branham I said what was it says would you mind telling us he said you know brother Brandon I dreamed that I was a rabbit and he said the hounds had jumped me up the hounds had jumped me up and said I was running but but them long-legged house was coming right behind me just about to catch me said they were hollering and said they got so close to me till I could feel their breath on my heels so you ought to feel the devil on your heels this morning he said he said I could just feel them nipping at me every time they make a chump and I said I looked and there was a great big rock and there was a cliff in that rock and no and no if I could ever get in that little cleft it's just big enough for me to get into look at it them hounds couldn't get him there I know they couldn't scratch through that through the rock I know I was safe if I could ever get in that rock and said I just made it in time said when I got inside I said I just sat down and begin to relax and I liked that the man's safety was found once he got inside oh yeah he could be hanging on the outside of the rock the house when I got him and the only way you gonna be protected from that devil is you gonna have to get in Christ all things are pass away and everything else becomes new you can't let off pressure once you get in you got to get in you got to get in that's it let off the steam so just just come to the rock down the hill a galloping right behind you sin marking your lives as you go you claim and if you claim to be a Christian and still love the world I want to make sure y'all get that you you you can't be you can't love the world and the things of the world the Bible say if you love the things of the world the love of God is not in you you claim to be a Christian still of the world if you claim to be a Christian don't believe that believe the word that's the hounds of hell howling right behind you he's got to hear it under some creed or something another in a briar patch he can catch you there there's only one safe place that's the rock brother there's a cliff in that rock tonight or today it's open for sinners it's open for unbelief run into it then let off the pressure set down there you're safe forevermore just let off the pressure and you'll be all right run to Christ because he is our refuge he is our refuge and Our Strength a very present help in a time of trouble and the prophecy let's bow our heads just a moment and and we're gonna do that in a second but I want to encourage you get into Christ don't don't just hang around Church don't don't do that don't do that that's not gonna be enough right I mean if you you still feasting off the things of the world something wrong your appetite and change something something's not happening somewhere and and and and you know some of us we've been man we've been baptized that's great but that was years ago that was years ago you got baptized how are you progressing now in God trial come up we don't see you when you got when you got this thing really on the inside of you no matter what comes up in your life a man you remain a Christian you remain faithful to God hallelujah church right you remain faithful this thing has got to happen on the inside this is not something that a man that that you just hear about glory to God I was talking to a man the other day and and he was saying how they were he was restoring a home you know and if you buy a house and you're gonna restore it the first thing that he said I said what'd you do to restore you start working with me outside first say no no no no no I don't work on the outside I work inside you got wiring that need to be upgraded he left Kauai no I'm worried about the outside this place will burn down if you don't get the wiring change hallelujah so there's things that have to be done on the inside in order to manifest on the outside church if III can't make it no plainer than that I can't make it no simpler than that this thing has got to be done your life hallelujah in Christ what happens on the inside is more important than anything else I I thank God when we get people coming to church a lord knows I appreciate that but if you leave this church and you go right back out there doing the same old stuff he was doing before you came to church can I ask a question what good the church do what good I believe God has already started to work inside of you but I believe it's up to you to open up and allow him to do more and I'm gonna tell you something God wants to take you further and deeper than you ever imagined in his love but it's up to you to open up the door there was a painting this man built the he had the scripture behold I stemmed the doorknob and he got inspired me he designed the painting around that script I stand at the door and knock and they looked at the painting and and everybody start criticizing it and like well you know this nice this door and everything that you got this real nice is saying you know real pretty and everything say but the only thing problem with your door is it don't have a doorknob to let people in he said oh oh no no no no it was designed that way I did it that way intentionally so what you mean he says because the doorknob is on the inside and Jesus stands at the door not if you got to be the one to open up on the inside and allow him to come in today he's knocking at your door father the word has been preached you know every person that would be here today you know the conditions of our hearts and Father you have told us by inspiration that this has got to be an inside job something has to happen on the inside of each and every person here God it can't be it can't be father just outward manifestations just things that we do to try to please other people God something has to happen a change must take place from the inside help us to realize God that going to church won't be enough not when we stand before you on that on that great day Lord it won't be enough just to say that we went to church it won't be enough just to say that we were baptized in water God that the whole purpose the whole purpose of being baptized in water amen and going to churches that we would go on to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost Lord don't let our hearts be settled until we Lord have come to a place where we God have gone all the way with you Lord that that's my prayer that's that's what I desire Lord that every heart will come to a place they realized God it's got to be all you they got to give up everything Jesus [Music] we can play games with this the rapture is upon us the time is at hand we don't know God if if ever we would come Lord and that'll be the last service that we ever attended we don't know God we assume that we'll be back next week we assume that we'll be back next month we assume these things but we don't know God when it's gonna be the last time we walk into this building
