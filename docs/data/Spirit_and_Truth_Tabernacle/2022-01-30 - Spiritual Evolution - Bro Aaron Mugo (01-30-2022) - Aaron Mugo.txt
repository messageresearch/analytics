time i think um everything has been done oh oh um a brother uh donny reagan had sent a prayer request for his daughter erica she's been going through a number of things and um and lately the doctors are kind of advising that she think a blood count is down in some kind of way cells are down and they're trying to maybe do an infusion or whatever she's just been fighting young young sister maybe early 40s or something like that i think three kids and husband and they're doing all they can just to try to help her so he just asked that all the churches churches would just be in prayer and man for her so we want to remember sister erica and man in our prayers on today and just trust that god will touch her amen in some some way god would touch and work a miracle on her behalf so let's just stand to our feet and um we will uh have word of prayer and then we'll um also invite our precious brother aaron out amen let's pray father [Music] um a precious brother reagan has requested prayer for his daughter lord you've seen everything that she has been going through the the the fight she's having inside of her body but we know according to your word you told us it is your will for us to be in good health and to prosper even as our soul prospers so father we rebuke this enemy god satan and all of his demons that are coming against sister erica right now we rebuke it in the name of jesus because you told us in your word that what we bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and what we loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven so we we bind the hands of satan that's at work and we lose the presence of god to saturate her entire body lord that it will function the way that you designed it to function and lord may you give her a miracle may you work all things out father for your glory and for your honor and as we begin to turn the service now father to the preaching of the word we actually should use brother aaron god in only a way that you can minister through him to us that we would be edified lord and that your name will be magnified in this place it's in jesus name that we pray amen amen seeing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] o [Music] hallelujah sing it again with all your heart amazing grace [Music] [Applause] [Music] i once was lost but now i'm found but now i see [Applause] amen let's bow our heads and pray thank you lord for bringing us here this morning lord thank you for the presence of you that we feel in this place already thank you for these willing hearts that are open and accepting to your word lord thank you for everything you've done to bring this service together from the pulpit to the pew lord you've led people to pray lord you've led me to study lord you've led the musicians to practice and to give their time and give their wills to you lord jesus you've helped the team at the back with the electronics lord you've helped the people come to set up the service lord and we believe all of this was for a purpose we believe that you will come and meet us here that you will feed us this morning lord we don't we're not worried about the world outside and what the weather's like we're not worried about what trials and troubles we're going through lord we just we know that if we can just meet you and know you it'll all be all right we know that you will settle all things and you will feed us this morning lord as we go into the word we ask that you have your will and take control of everything in the service we ask all this the name of jesus christ amen thank you musicians uh i uh i'm really happy to be back home [Laughter] i know i'm in and out of here so much that i've adopted this place and i've uh moved around a lot in my life and lived in different places but um and i have to you know you kind of gotta make that home and get used to it yourself but you guys made it so easy for me because you're just so welcoming and so loving and kind to each each time i come back i just get to feel a great spirit everybody's just so happy and loving to see me and it makes it so easy and uh even coming to minister here just feels great because you know you know something's gonna happen here like you know something's gonna happen it's so much easier i mean last time i was here sister abby's saying a special and this time she did again and i'm like we're all good now you know the devil likes to throw things at me whenever i'm gonna minister i'm sure other ministers feel the same but he makes you feel a little scared about coming up here he tries to but you know it doesn't feel so bad today i know something's gonna happen all right um and uh you know for the jackie said something about for who said 47 days is that you oh my goodness you know there's there's a there's a deacon up in at home and every time i walk in the building he greets me says how many days left and i never remember and he says you better find out cause she knows i heard that today and i was like yeah she certainly knows i better remember that but um i thank you guys for all your support and all the love and so many people have given us great advice and given us physical gifts so many different things that you've given us and we we want to say that we appreciate that and i'm really happy to celebrate that day with you i hope each and every one of you makes it out uh yeah it's gonna be great yeah god's in it all right let's go to uh genesis chapter one and we're going to go to verse 26 this morning genesis 1 26 we're going to read three verses there 26 starts with and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him man male and female created he them and god blessed them and said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the file of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth you may be seated you know when god god created man and we were created in his image that's what the scripture tells us and he created us as the highest form of life that could be created and that is in the image of god so we can believe hey i'm i'm pretty good because i am as close to god as you're gonna get in nature you can think that about yourself that's a wonderful thing now uh this this topic i'm going to talk on today is actually called spiritual evolution and i want to show you how god has evolved us and how that matches exactly well not exactly but pretty closely to how science evolved us as well according to their take on things which is not correct so i'm going to talk about what evolution is at the beginning and i just want you to bear with me because i'm going to build a lot and then we're going to hit some all right all right so evolution in science says that we were first we started out as little single cell organisms and these are like bacteria or germs or something like that and then each time that we moved to a new environment we got bigger we got stronger and then eventually we became human beings so we went through bacteria we became plants and then uh moved on up and up until you get animals that move around and so many different things until you get to a chimpanzee and stuff like that and then boom human so that's how evolution works in science now that theory actually came it was probably floated around for a while but it got really big with charles darwin he wrote this book called the origin of species now i'm sure a lot of you have heard all of this in school i'm just going over it again because you need to remember it so he writes this book and then the communists and the nazis they take this and they run with it and they use that for their political agenda because they're against god and in the time that brother branham was preaching and he was ministering people thought communism was the mark of the beast because this spirit of thinking that science had the answer to where we came from and what we're going to that spirit was so strong that he you know everybody just thought it was the mark of the beast it's totally the end because the cold war was coming around so uh there is a lot of false out there and it is interesting whenever you go to the message and you actually see brother branham says that he believed in evolution if you look at some quotes so i had a lot of quotes on that but i broke it down to a couple of them we're going to the mark of the beast 1961 and the seal of god it says i believe in evolution you can't argue with that he said that the first thing maybe when there was nothing but just plain chaos volcanic eruption you know god's a great contractor you believe that a great contractor always lays out all of his stuff when he builds his subdivision god when he was moving the earth around creating calcium potash petroleum and so forth he was laying our bodies on the earth right then the material that we're made out of and the holy spirit went out from god you see i already told you what science thought of evolution but i like the way that the prophet actually takes these things he has a spiritual side he's able to see all sorts of things and he takes the scientific side they have a an idea it just wasn't really balanced out right so he takes that and pushes it with the word and it works just perfectly see i'm not against science i love science i find it really interesting it's very wrong a lot of the time but i feel like science just confirms what god has confirms all the laws of science that you see written out there they actually confirm god's word okay where'd i stop there hallelujah and the great holy spirit went out from god to brood over the earth or coo make love like a hen her brood and his let's think he had wings he did not but let's think he had wings like a hen over a brood he began to brood over the earth and i can see some calcium coming run running down a little place mixing up with some moisture and podash and a little easter flower come out then i can hear him say come here father and look at this you see if if you look in the scripture we read in genesis it says let us make man in our image so you know the holy spirit's talking to the father that's the us he's talking about right there that's a little nugget if you ever never thought about that all right come to your father and look at this very good keep on brooding after a while brood a little more what come out next was probably the flowers and the vegetations and the birds flew out of the dust of the earth and then come the animal life and kept getting higher life higher life higher life until finally a man come up in the very image of god strange something didn't come up higher than that wasn't it can't get no higher right it was the image of god glory evolution brings it up like that so man was created after six days right on the sixth day god started with lower things he said let there be light and then he built up and then he built up and then you get the plant life then you get the animal life the very last day he convert can he um he i forgot what that word is but he yes he dedicated that whole day just for man he dedicated the whole day just for you just for me so that's how important he was because you can't like if we're created in the image of god you can't just make god just like that he's complex you know we are triune beings there's a lot to us you know even if that first day he was making us in the spirit a spirit by itself is so complicated it can it can change so many things like one spirit in this room affects all of us other spirits can affect certain ones of us groups of us over here some spirits are on one person some spirits aren't many people there are so many different spirits positive and negative and god just creates one just like him in that one day i'm surprised it only took him one day but that's god right now he he creates that spirit and in not only that but if you actually think about it if you look in the bible god anytime he takes the the the form anytime he uses uh the body of a creature and actually speaks and acts through that body it's going to be through a human he always uses a human yes he used that donkey with balaam and that but he just spoke through it he wasn't actually you know doing works or anything like that whenever he came to abraham he used a body whenever he came in the form of jesus christ he used a body whenever moses saw him pass by like that the back of him was like the form of a man because we are in his image he wasn't it wasn't that far of a stretch for him to step into a body or to use a body like that because we are just that high on the food chain so i i know that's just one quote where he says he believes in evolution let me read a few more just a few more present stage of my ministry 1962. now this might be good some of you high school kids is getting this stuff taught to you here about evolution now i believe in evolution but not in the way that men evoluted from some lower species their own theory backfires on them when they try to hybrid anything it won't breed itself back so you see it's backfired on them now i believe that when god began to bathe the earth maybe the first thing he did come forth was a jellyfish from from that up to a frog and on up but you see it's continually come closer and closer to the image of man and man was a reflection of god and that's the reason that grass became evoluted maybe grass and then from grass and flowers and flowers and shrubs shrubs come tree why it's a picture of the tree of life standing on the other side and everything on this side that's natural is a shadow of the supernatural or eternal on the other side therefore as long as there's a born-again christian on the earth and we got a body here like this it's the very reflection of one that's waiting on the other side where there is no death and sorrow countdown 1962. [Music] and then the last thing that ever come up from the earth in the form of creation was a man nothing higher ever come because why it was a perfect reflection of the highest in heaven which god is a man he says god is a man see god is a man so therefore it proves it and when god came down to dwell among us he was a man see a man so it shows that the perfection of evolution was god which is a man so if you look at adam's created state which we read in genesis then you see that he had a lot of attributes that we don't have right now so he was immortal he could live forever right uh he had complete dominion over the earth because he could tell the earth to move and he could tell the animals to do what he wants or the plants or anything like that he could order them around because he was in that connection with god not only that his connection with god was so strong it was face to face all he had to do was say something and god was right there in front of him he could see him see uh you look in the scripture and says no man has seen god at any time adam was able to actually see god and communicate with him there's a difference between where he was right there and what we are right now so this thought of evolution it was it was it was causing me to think and i i i won't tell you where i got this thought until maybe the end of the sermon but um it was causing me to think that if someone can evolve going forward and become a higher life form can that work backwards because where we are right now is not where adam is over there so something happened between there and here that brought us to where we are right now now granted we have all this revelation that we have right now and we're closer to god than other church ages but still there's a big leap between where adam was and where we are so i uh i looked up something called reverse evolution and i actually found out that scientists actually know that this is a thing so let me use an example of an animal that everybody is aware of it's penguin if you see a penguin it has flippers on it scientists will call that a bird so their idea of evolution because they have to make it fit you know whatever theory they came up with so their idea was that okay penguins didn't always have flippers like that so they said all right it evolved just like all the other organisms just like we did from like you know fish or whatever or frogs or whatever it is and then it became a bird and it was able to fly and then it evolved backwards and lost the ability to fly so that's what that's an example of reverse evolution hang with me now i don't want this to get too complicated so it just evolved backwards and then it became the way it was the way it is right now so i took that thought and i went to the bible and i realized god even though he created adam in his own image with all of that power and all of that perfection eve the same way he had to break us down over stages to get us to where we are right now and that was through his purpose and his will and i believe that so the first place i went to look was the scripture we already read okay adam was there we are not there second place i went to is genesis 3 22 and the lord god said behold the man is become as one of us to know good and evil this is right after adam already took of the tree of knowledge good and evil so if you realize at that point he wasn't the perfect reflection of god because god had the knowledge of good and evil he just did good all the time now now that adam and eve actually took of that tree then they have that knowledge and he says the man is become as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also with the tree of life and eat and live forever therefore the lord god sent him forth from the garden of eden to till the ground from whence he was taken so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the garden of eden cherubins and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life so the first thing that happened whenever that caused adam to go down to devolve or his reverse evolution the first thing that happened was he sinned and he was told in that day that you sin that day you die so he's driven out away from the word of god that's the first thing god actively does to cause him to devolve the very first thing separation from the word genesis chapter six verse one i'm going to go through the second part and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born unto them that the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all which they chose and the lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man for he for that he also is flesh yet his day shall be 120 years so the second thing right there god's spirit not striving with man god took his spirit from man so first the word then the spirit now after that you go down to verse five actually and god saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually and he repented the lord that he had made man on the earth and grieved him at his heart so he was separated from god's spirit and after that his lifespan becomes only 120 years god takes his lifespan down that now you know if you pass 120 years that's just a blessing from god right there you actually see people who actually pass that um so the second stage was his lifespan got lowered third stage genesis chapter 11 verse one to eight now we're going to go to we skipped about five chapters in genesis actually and we see that the whole flood happens and noah and all of his sons they already pass in previous generations and god had seen how wicked the world had become and he already wiped all the men off the face of the earth now this is what happens uh this is around the time of the tower of babel so 11 verse 1 and the whole earth was was of one language and of one speech and it came to pass as they journeyed from the east that they found a plane on the land of shinar and they dwelt there and the lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men builded and the lord said behold the people as one and they have all one language in this they begin to do and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do go to let us go down and there confound their language that they may not understand one another's speech so the lord scattered them abroad from uh from thence upon the face of the earth and they left off to build the city so the third thing was he confounded their language and that was like the final death stroke because this is immediately this is not long after the flood it's within a few hundred years after the flood and mankind even though he has a short lifespan he's already building this tower of babel which is completely against god's word and they're trying to reach where god is so he knows that since they have one language and they're all in agreement they still have the capability of getting to this point where they're reaching god in a way that's not correct going away away from his word but still trying to find their own path to get to heaven and he said yeah they will reach there but let's stop them so what happens whenever you change everybody's language what happens they all scattered all over the earth and cultures start arising in different places and nobody likes each other everybody has a different religion and everybody's okay with that and they start fighting each other now if everybody in the world actually spoke the same language right now and everybody recognized the bible right here was the truth from the get-go we'd be a lot farther in life so many people wouldn't have died unnecessarily so many people would have been much closer to god or have an understanding of god because you got to realize this is a generation or two after noah everybody probably knew who exactly noah was they probably saw him shem and japheth right there in front of them that was probably their granddaddy or something they knew who that was and they knew what his word was so they had that concept but they didn't like the fact that they had that connection with uh that that they had to go god's way in order to have a connection if you look at um the church age book brother branham says that uh he took it from his slops to babylons that they they were the reason they built the tower was because they didn't like the connection with god above them so they built this structure where everybody could live inside but not feel the force of god's presence above them so they had a ceiling over their heads and it was a roof and it protected them from that condemnation of not living the correct way if you actually look in the hislop's two babylons that's what it says and i thought that was an amazing amazing point how people actively separate themselves from god that's exactly what this science is that i'm telling you about they have to find an answer to everything and they have to try to find a way that the bible doesn't add up with their answer because if they find an answer that works then they can say that god doesn't exist they can ignore that fact they can't ignore that fact whenever they actually hit their death beds and you know the spirit's leaving their body because science will tell you a spirit doesn't exist there's no such thing as a spirit they say that all you are is a is a is a collection of memories that's all your brain is and that's all that makes you so i find it amazing the links that people go to in order to ignore god it takes so much more work than actually just following his word so all of these cultures spring up and uh the world becomes an apostate place it's very um anti-god and um actually if you look in the power of god in 1955 i had i saw this quote and i was like this is perfect goes right here it says a woman is a wonderful thing a man too but when they've got away from god they're lowered down in beasts that's right they'll do things that a beast wouldn't do so at this point god he has all of these creatures all of us as mankind as his creation but he has an unfulfilled purpose in us in that he wants us to get to that place where we are where he is even though we have this knowledge of good and evil even though we've eaten from the tree of knowledge of good and evil he still wants us to get there now this is different from adam and you in a way are greater than adam was in the garden of eden because even though you have that knowledge of good and evil you still chose god's way even though you knew that there is something seductive in life and you had something even though you were born in sin and shaped in iniquity even though you had no control over that in your own history you still chose god's way i look around here this morning i see so many people who've chosen god's way i see them dressed correctly i see them giving their time to the lord their talents i see how how hard it is to live in this age and yet we still decide to choose god's way because there is no greater way somehow we recognize that somehow against all the odds and against all of all of the things that the devil shoves in our faces day after day we still recognize that god has a better way you know i i think of it this way how many people have electronic devices like a phone or something like that how many ads do you see in a day just looking down at that thing that's right and 90 of the ads is something the devil wants you to look at like i said there are different spirits here the devil has a spirit behind every ad even if it's something as innocuous as hey here's a notebook it's empty you probably want a notebook maybe your phone heard you saying you wanted a notebook this thing's taken on a life of its own right it heard you say you want a notebook there's nothing wrong with a notebook right but there's a spirit behind that if you go too far and you jump on every ad it's called a spirit of consumerism and the devil loves to take that and he he loves to keep shoving stuff like that in your face not only that you look up from your phone you just look at the way people are dressed you look at all the entertainment that's around you look at all the options there are for destroying your own life so many options so many ads and it's a spirit of this age not only that entertainment that's one i have a struggle with i'm going to be honest with that i have a problem with entertainment because i i don't have an addiction of of probably some drug or alcohol or anything like that but if i decide to focus on something i'm going gonna focus really hard and i'm gonna stay right there so if it's something like entertainment i feel like reading a book i'm gonna read like five of them in the space of two weeks because i don't want to do anything else and the devil just traps me right there it might not be a bad thing but too much of it makes it a bad thing that's where the addiction sets in a lot of people have different addictions like this could be movies it could be music it could be all sorts of things and the devil will just shove it in your face like that devil's got an ad campaign people it's a strong ad campaign you know what he's got he's got uh he's got a buy one get seven free deal you know what i mean when the unclean spirit steps out comes back with seven more guess what he finds this he finds a clean house and that scripture says that it's a garnished house y'all ever seen garnish food it looks so good it's like whoa i was at a place yesterday where i was eating and they put a flower on the plate and i'm like i want to eat that even more i don't even want to eat the flower i just want to eat the food the devil when he comes back with that spirit he's like everybody come on in you can welcome him in or you can fight back now we're still on this topic of evolution and um so there's another process in evolution that's called natural selection and uh it says that okay there's a group of organisms in this species and they're in front of us and um some of them are going to make it to the next generation and some of them are not because some of them are going to be ready and evolved so for example uh humans i think no let's use giraffes as an example so giraffes according to science in the past they didn't have long necks but the longer neck giraffes because all the animals they were competing with they're like imagine competing with zebras and antelopes on the savannah all the animals they're competing with are eating leaves off the trees and then giraffes over time the longer next giraffes lived longer because they were able to get the tallest leaves off the top of the tree so eventually all giraffes ended up with long necks that's their theory so naturally select natural selection said okay all giraffes with long necks make it to the next generations all the other ones die hang with me here so god still has this desire fellow to fellowship with man and he needs to look for somebody in this generation after the flood after the tower of babel with some sort of characteristic that he can latch onto and take on to the next generation someone he can use to fulfill his will so this gene it's really simple it's called faith so he sees abraham he's like that guy that guy has the gene i need and i'm gonna take him and all of his descendants spiritually speaking because this is a spiritual side of things all of his descendants are going to come into the next generation we are living proof of that right here we all have the faith so did it work yes it did there's proof right there so he calls abraham i call that natural selection now uh there's a definition i got on national geographic says natural natural selection is the process through which populations of living organisms adapt and change some individuals have traits better used to the enviro better suited to the environment than others individuals with adaptive traits traits that give them some advantage are more likely to survive and reproduce these individuals then pass the adaptive traits to their offspring so how many people in this room believe the message all right keep your hands up please please all right how many heard it from their parents right there's a decent number of us right here how many heard about christ and him coming to save us from your parents some hand should go right back up why because you had faith in that word your parents were praying for you they were teaching you they were helping you to grow and to survive and that faith actually came from somebody who was ahead of you in your christian walk some of you may have heard it from your pastors that could be a spiritual parent to you some of you may have heard it from some random preacher some of some of you directly from the message but that same faith was transmitted to you from our forefathers that's a gene and it just keeps moving on i'm not saying people who've never heard of the word of god in in their entire life or their family tree won't hear it because somebody's gonna bring it to them it could be us it could be each it could be any of these little kids right here could be anybody but that's still somebody who passes it down to you because that is your genetic inheritance you're going to inherit that so like right now think of it think of it this way i don't want to get ahead of myself let me just let me just hang on so um abraham he's in a place he's in an environment and this is another factor according to evolution it's environment so if you think about animals and plants too often they'll develop some sort of um characteristic based on the environment that they're in so all animals tend to have limbs not all i mean you have snakes and whatnot but most animals tend to have limbs so depending on the environment they're gonna have something that develops based on the environment they're in so if you look at a fish you look at a shark their limbs develop into fins that's still a limb they move it you look at us we have arms and legs just like land creatures you look at birds they develop wings because they're supposed to go out so they have that characteristic that develops that characteristic is actually called it starts by a mutation in the earlier things so in the earlier generations it's a mutation for instance uh not everybody not all humans are going to have the same exact mutation some of us are going to be tall some of us are going to be short and those are genes that came directly through our family tree for instance here's something weird about me i was born with six fingers on each hand my parents did not have that but my grandparents did so that gene passed down in like one in every 500 people has about the same thing so i was born with 12 fingers but not everybody's supposed to be born with 12 fingers it's just something that's there it's a mutation so i hope becca you knew about that before you just gonna let you know but it's a mutation and it can follow your family tree so uh if you think about that that environment [Laughter] that uh and that also applies to the spiritual i'm just gonna say i didn't even think about that right now i mean whoever you're gonna marry you gotta look at their family too not just the ones who are under the blood the ones who probably are running from god look what they're fighting before you bring them into your thing you're not just marrying your partner now you're just i mean i'm not even married and i know that you're not just marrying your part you need to be careful who you look at not only that but be careful who you associate with because we're talking about environment right now right so abraham is actually called out of out of an idolatrous environment right that is exactly the environment he was in not only that but he moved with his family and they carried the environment with them they had to die out before isaac was actually born his dad had to die he had to separate from his brother he had to separate from lot be careful who you hang out with it's important so that environment it's going to cause you to develop something that will help you fight the environment or help you survive there i believe we're in the one of the one of the most difficult environments to live in for a christian that's ever been exist in existence right i mean it's the worst right now the world is at its worst but god gave us something to work through this he gave us his word not only that he gave us more than everybody in the history of the bible was ever given in order to survive pass that on to your kids teach them how to let that gene work for them make sure to teach them the right thing and teach them about the environment that they're living in so life 1962 brother brandon was actually talking about environment and uh he says um a brother was testifying to me this morning he was called to the ministry when a little boy when a little boy and then he fell he said and he said but then he come back with more of a call to preach than ever before so if you look at him and you look at abraham this this guy had got away from god abraham was never with god in the first place he was living an idolatrous life and in order for god to use them they had to step out of whatever environment that was in they had to move for god to actually build them to exactly where they were so god the first thing he's doing and involving us descendants of abraham he shows first you need to separate you hear the word you need to separate you need to follow the word and wherever it leads you it's going to take you out of whatever bar room you're in it's going to take you from a group of friends sometimes it's going to take you out of your family sometimes sometimes it'll move you geographically but follow the word and god's going to take you exactly where you need to be to survive he's going to control the environment so the quote continues he says you see what it was when he become a christian he got in the wrong environment see and that environment influenced him see and you just keep holding around without a kind of environment it influences you i hope you're reading between the lines what i'm saying it influences you in that environment the first thing you know you become a part of that environment you go into it see you end up going in there it's not going to come on to your side you can say wow i'm just going to be an influence and i'm going to get everybody in this bar room to church they're not going to follow you they're not going to follow you don't take yourself there don't put yourself in a situation you don't need to be but there are situations that we have to be in we have to go to work we gotta go to school there's things you gotta do and there are people there that are gonna have their own atmosphere their own spirit they're going to be setting that environment you can fight back while you're there but all the more reason you should come to church on sunday that's right because god gives you a bit of rest and pulls you out of there charges you up and sends you right back in there that's just the way he made this age to be is that we are supposed to be a light for him but we still have to charge up once in a while and there's no other way you're going to stay strong unless you charge up even if it's a day by day thing read your bible pray charge up wherever you are set that atmosphere in your home let everybody in the house actually come under subjection to that and have the same mindset it's really important so god pulled abraham out of the environment for him to achieve his potential um and that's what we need to do you need to achieve your potential you know the word of god comes to edify us and perfect us and you're not going to evolve and go to the next stage if you're left behind any time god takes it turns a corner in his word you need to follow now you can actually see the people didn't follow this all in the in the past so um abraham's family they didn't make it because they didn't follow god's word god wasn't speaking to them they didn't get natural selection sometimes you can't do that i mean god predestinates us i hope you're seeing the spiritual side he predestinated you so you're already naturally selected now the israelites they get the word of god through moses they get the law and god is still evolving us back in stages trying to get us to exactly where he wants us to be in the future so they get the law of god and it's it's the word to them that's the first time the word is ever written in in on with a human pen that is the first time ever and they get that and that's a major step for them if you look on the on the scientific side of things and you see how people evolved the written word was a major part of that the development of language and things like that were a major part of that according to science because that showed that something could be passed on to generations whether the organisms were living or not and that's a history right there so um the israelites get the law of god and not only that god sends his son and he speaks to the 12 disciples and all the christians in the earliest stage right there and gives them grace so they have the word plus grace you can see this restoration happening adam was separated from the word that was the first thing god did first thing god does at the beginning when he's re-evolving everybody give him the word back right there give it back to them and not only that second thing is grace and that's eternal life that comes that's the second stage he's bringing us right back to him where are we headed right now okay so the seven church ages come and you see justification starting you say sanctification baptist baptism the holy spirit one at a time we're coming back to where god is so what happens is in every church age you see a group of people and they undergo a mutation like my fingers right but the spiritual side because they're the only ones around them who recognize how god's moving to the next age they have to see it and in order for you to see that you need to have that relationship with god to see exactly where he's moving to if you don't have that relationship and then you come to him he's not gonna i mean you come to him like once in a while not as often as he should be you need to be you need to be on a friend to friend basis with him in order to see where he's moving otherwise you're going to miss a turn and guess what you're going to die out so on the devil side of things what does he do to stop us from evolving to where god wants us to be he causes people to hybridize and brother branham talks about this all the time so a hybrid animal is where you take two species that do not belong together and then you mash them together and you come up with something that doesn't isn't supposed to exist so the most common example of that is actually the mule because you got a horse and a donkey and then you end up with a mule so people like good things that are here they the thing is they like they like the endurance of a horse but they like the patience of a donkey so they put those together and like hey i got both of them together and look this is the product now people do the same thing with god's word they take the things they like out of the word they take the things they like out of the world and then they smash them together it's like okay what do we have denomination right there religion right there we do that on our personal lives as well so what happens whenever you hybridize two animals you get a mule you hybridize two more you get a second mule one is a male one is a female put them together they're not going to come up with anything that's not how hybridization works that species will not survive to the next generation not until you keep mashing them together over and over again until you keep coming out with more and more mules but they're not going to reproduce that's not a new species so i actually looked up a bunch of other species that uh are hybridized they get a buffalo and a cow it's called a beefalo i don't know why they got a zebra and a horse it's called a zebroid i looked at pictures of these i didn't want to show them to you because they're kind of disturbing they they don't work they don't work and mixing god's word with anything does not work that's not how it works is not how it works so we actually do that ourselves because humans even though we're getting better and better you know as christians every generation gets more of his word and you get to climb up higher and higher even though you have this we have this i'm including myself here thing is people's concept of god keeps changing even though he's the same exact god we do that and for instance you know the jews they had a picture of jehovah they could not reconcile that with christ so their idea was of jehovah it's like my god it's like this you know he's not supposed to be like christ early christians they see christ in jehovah same person and they have to they actually have to come to terms with that and then move to the next age so we make that mistake individually because we have an idea my god loves me you know and we just look at god from that angle he loves me so much he will forgive me for everything you know and my god is giving jehovah gyra great wonderful these are all wonderful characteristics but god is just he's also timely he won't give you everything you want you know he's a very timely god so we have a we we actually we go to god in our prayers we don't really have a relationship with him but what we know from church is he loves me and he'll give me anything so we just go hey god please give me this please give me this please give me this please give me this and that's not a relationship what we want and the thing is we get ourselves in these messes here sometimes you know it's like i i got myself in this situation you know brother branham talks about the devil giving you a box of rattlesnakes you go out there if you don't sign for it and you decline it then he can't give it to you that's what he says but if you go out there sign it and hand it over ooh i got a package i didn't order this but what is it and then you're like oh i want an amazon prime god two days over i just wanted knocked out i wanted to come over here and as soon as i got i mean it took me an hour to get myself in this mess but i want him to come get it get me out of it immediately that's not how that works all the time a lot of the problems we have in life are things that we signed for and brought onto ourselves like i said the way we were spending our time with entertainment and stuff i bring myself into this problem where i lose my connection with god then a trial comes and guess what here i am just like oh god i know i haven't been around in a while but here we are that's not how it works you need a relationship that's not how that's not how that works a smyrna in church age brother brandon talks about hybridization he says the smyrnian age had drifted far from the original it had become a hybrid and this this works for all church ages not just the smyrnia church age and it works for all individuals too it had hybridized the way itself the way eve did you know what a hybrid is what comes of two species mixing the result is no longer pure like the original it is mongrel when eve allowed the beast to mingle his seed with hers he produced a creature called cain that wasn't pure humming human he was of the wicked one so if you mix god's word with anything it's not his word anymore the church too has departed from what she originally was he was a hybrid that is the church nominal is a hybrid people say i'm a baptist it wasn't so in the beginning i'm a methodist it wasn't so in the beginning instead of the straight word of god instead of the spirit-filled men in the church who were led by spirit-given revelation there are now creeds and bylaws and the educated guesses of educated men see [Music] our concept of god is it can be so hybrid because we don't really look at what god is and don't treat him as a friend you need to constantly read his word constantly get more revelation pray for that relationship pray for his characteristics in any time that he's going to make a change in your life you can either be evolved at that point or you can be not evolved at that point and then he's got to wait and you won't have those characteristics see that evolution i'm talking about is getting us to be exactly like god it's taking a while to get there and i believe the bride has something to do with that we need to be able to get on his level not only those people who haven't come in yet but ourselves we need to look after after ourselves and make sure we get to that point and uh i think i have another quote here yeah so there's only one thing that can actually evolve the human race and get us back to where adam was and chemistry doesn't work like this in in in actual science world in the in the science world um chemistry says you know you can't unscramble scrambled eggs it's like hey you already these guys already evolved this far you can't suddenly become a new species all of a sudden but god's word says that it can't there's only one way you can actually get back to where you're supposed to be if you look at 1960 condemnation by representation brother branham says god said so jesus died that he might breed back oh hallelujah only the blood can do that only through the chemistry of the blood of jesus christ and breed back again a person that won't vary one word from what god said a little further down he says christ came up came that he might breed back by the holy spirit oh brother as we sat together now in heavenly places in christ jesus the holy spirit breathing upon us like we are now breathing just like god breathes into the nostrils of adam breathing back taking away the rubbish the rubbish of theology taking away the rubbish of the world man-made doctrines having forms of godliness denying the power thereof breeding breed it back to an unadulterated faith in jesus christ oh in god so he also says uh in i think it's the same tape actually you know nope it wasn't so from the beginning 1960 and all these years of denominations finally god has bred his church back to the holy ghost again i'm so glad to be in it let the old seeds and carnality die out become a new creature in christ jesus we're setting today together today in heavenly places in christ jesus the holy spirit breeding out oh i'm so glad of that breeding out doubts isms breeding in himself the sons of god not breeding back mules crossing it up or breeding sons and daughters of god that don't look at the word and stick out their ears and say well my mother was present presbyterian that's all right but we need first to make a sons and daughters of god breeding out the unbelief and the creeds and the things and bringing us so he's breeding us back to the same faith of our fathers the same faith of adam see adam he didn't have um he didn't have to have faith for the things he was doing there's something in biology also called instinct it's where you just act exactly like you're supposed to in a given situation like right now i don't have to tell myself to sweat right now because i'm warm that's instinct my body just does that somebody tries to hit me i move that's instinct right you don't have to think about that that's just what you do we need to get to that point where we don't need to pray to god for every move we make because it's an instinct he wants us to do that there's something in our spirit we have a human spirit that makes us do this now that sorry that was a scientific side we have a holy spirit that makes us do this but there's something in an organism that's just passed down you don't have to learn to have an instinct i want to get to that place with god god wants me to do something i'm just right there that's where i want to be right philippians 1 6 says being confident of this very thing that he which have begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of jesus christ see i i started coming up with laws of evolution according to god and the first one is god does not evolve somebody in vain he does not evolve somebody in vain he started a work in you he's going to finish that he's going to see you through to the end even though you have to strive sometimes it seems like a struggle it's like god i don't know what to do next but he knows exactly what he's going to move you to he knows what environment he placed you in he gave you exactly what you needed and he he selected you naturally uh yeah i also have one more scripture romans 12 2 basically telling us to evolve says be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god so you realize your your your body is not going to evolve past where it is spiritually speaking until you take a rapture but you can evolve your thoughts have god's thoughts you can evolve your spirit take on his spirit that's what you can do church don't miss a beat don't miss a beat in your family in your household musicians can come back actually but don't miss a beat in your family and your household just i want to have the mind of god yeah and i'm so hungry for that i don't want to miss out every time he takes a move in my life and my personal life any everybody agree with that let's pray over it heavenly father thank you for so much this morning thank you for the prayers of the saints and uh thank you for our fellowship together thank you for your word coming forth thank you for bringing this thought out thank you for taking control of the service lord i i couldn't have done this on my own and none of us here could have made it here on our own lord none of us could have decided to be your children lord jesus but you came and you chose us and you chose what characteristics we had you chose to give us more you chose to give us that hunger that we desire more of your word lord and more of your will in our lives lord we just we ask that you please fulfill that lord please help us to follow your leading and to take your guidance into account lord we don't want to ignore you and just leave you here as a sunday thing or wednesday thing lord or we want you everywhere with us lord help us to carry our environment with us lord help us keep this atmosphere as we leave here as we go into the week lord let us just have you with us lord so we can combat the enemy lord and resist his his tricks and his enticements lord there's nothing we can do without you we're completely weak without you we're just like everybody else as we read the prophet said without you we're nothing more than beasts we're no different from any other animal it doesn't matter how intelligent we are lord we just need your spirit [Music] lord we we ask that you please take care of us as we travel home and also please guide us through the weak lord and please take care of those who are needy and sick lord so many requests that happen all the way around the world lord so many services going on and everybody's just hungry lord and everybody knows that there's nowhere else to run to but to you lord so that's why we're here we ask that every need be met lord we ask all this in the name of jesus christ amen [Music] jack [Applause] [Music] praise the lord i certainly appreciate uh brother aaron on today and just wonderful thoughts about the spiritual mutation just you know god just uses um he makes us all different ways so he can use this in different ways and you know as i was just you know listening to brother aaron and um how he was able to kind of go back into science um you know they talk about evolution the first thing we you know we want to say is god is against evolution but wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute let's look at this here the prophet you know kind of says that he's for evolution but he brings it from a different angle and sometimes we can just kind of catch those angles on the word of god there is so much in there so much in there and as you know just i i never heard of the term reverse evolution and and and all of this but ultimately what our brother was just really showing us is how yes we lost everything that god gave adam but through the coming of the word of god throughout the seven church ages god has brought us right back to the spot where adam was and it was proven in the life of the lord jesus christ amen when he could stop the wind and the waves and you know just control nature in whatever way he did that showed that that was coming back to man it was being restored it's being brooded breeded back into man we have this now and not only did it happen in the life of christ but god allowed it to happen in the life of his prophet amen showing that a man that was born just like us could operate in this in this in this area amen and and i love that i love that we can just have instinct you understand amen god just gives you instinct where you know there are certain things you're going to come and come through and come to in life you don't have time to pray about it you don't have time to fast about it but you can act and act knowing that heaven is backing you up and whatever you whatever decision you make god gonna back you up at that moment oh hallelujah amen i i appreciated that brother aaron god bless you thank you so much for getting yourself out of the way and allowing the lord to use you hallelujah hallelujah can we stand and sing a verse of amen this song this is my desire to [Music] i worship you [Music] oh i give you praise oh god yes and all that i adore is you oh [Music] say [Music] lord i give you my

brother aaron to show us what you've been doing throughout the years you deposited something in adam before sin separated him from your presence god and that that what you gave adam you always wanted him to have so lord through the process of restoration lord and salvation god so much that you've done you've allowed your spirit to be reconnected with man to dwell in man to bring man once again to this place that he lost at the beginning god your prophet told us how the uh the cherubim was there and and blocking entrance to the garden of eden and blocking interest back to the tree of life god after adam's sin but father now when we look in the book of revelation and the beast say come and see it's the same cherubim that are bringing us back into the presence of almighty god lord help us to hear your voice help us to realize what it is that you're calling us to and that will operate father the way that you have designed for us to operate the instinct that you've placed in us you did it for moses god you're doing the same thing for us i trust lord jesus that this would be a word that would be deposited into every spirit that will become materialized in our lives god we need it we
