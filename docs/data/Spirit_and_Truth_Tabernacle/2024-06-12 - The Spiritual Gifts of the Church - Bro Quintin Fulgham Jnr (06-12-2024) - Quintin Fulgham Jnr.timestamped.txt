[14:04] to a word of prayer to go before our
[14:08] lord lord Jesus we come before you oh
[14:11] Lord God we thank you for an opportunity
[14:13] oh Lord God to come before your throne
[14:15] oh Lord Jesus to have communion with you
[14:18] oh Lord Jesus Christ Lord you know we're
[14:21] all tired and battered from work uh from
[14:24] the Mind battles of the world and
[14:26] sickness in our body oh Lord God but oh
[14:28] Lord if we could just look in our hearts
[14:30] to a time in the garden when it was cool
[14:33] in the evening oh Lord God and you Ste
[14:35] down oh Lord God to talk to Adam and Eve
[14:38] oh Lord to uh to see how they were doing
[14:41] oh Lord to check up on your children oh
[14:42] Lord Lord let us put ourselves into
[14:44] their shoes oh Lord knowing that the
[14:47] Bible says when two or three are
[14:48] gathered oh Lord God you're in the midst
[14:51] oh Lord God it has nothing to do with a
[14:53] a church building oh Lord it has nothing
[14:55] to do with the the great Riches of the
[14:57] world oh Lord God but because we kept
[15:00] your word oh Lord Jesus Christ and you
[15:02] ordained us to be in this place oh Lord
[15:04] God lord you said you'd be with us in
[15:06] every single step oh Lord God lord we
[15:09] turn the service over to you oh Lord God
[15:11] those that need healing in their body oh
[15:13] lord lord I ask that you give them the
[15:15] faithful Lord Jesus Christ to get me out
[15:18] the way oh Lord God to speak a word that
[15:20] would be a blessing to them oh Lord God
[15:22] if they have loved ones that are lost oh
[15:24] Lord God if if they need help with
[15:27] financial situ ations or whatever
[15:29] they're going through oh Lord God I ask
[15:31] that you get myself out the way oh lord
[15:34] lord anoint their faithful Lord Jesus
[15:36] Christ to pull oh Lord God so that you
[15:39] can come down and speak to them oh Lord
[15:41] a Word of Deliverance oh lord lord we
[15:44] give you all the praise and the glory
[15:45] from the beginning of the service to the
[15:47] end in the precious name of Jesus Christ
[15:50] amen amen so God bless you all uh we're
[15:54] going to get right into the message um
[15:57] so the message that the lord gave me was
[15:59] the spiritual gifts of the church um and
[16:03] so with this whole theme of restoration
[16:05] that we got we've got going on this year
[16:08] um I was kind of I I believe I felt a
[16:10] little bit inspiration from the one
[16:11] brother that came by and preached and
[16:14] talked about the speaking in tongues and
[16:16] interpretation uh those being some of
[16:19] the gifts being restored back and so I
[16:21] kind of wanted to kind of maybe possibly
[16:23] lay a foundation and talk on a little
[16:25] bit more on maybe a couple of the gifts
[16:28] as well so we're going to start our
[16:30] scripture reading from Corinthians well
[16:33] 1 Corinthians um chapter 12 uh verses uh
[16:37] 1 through two and I'll wait for everyone
[16:39] to get
[16:44] there and it reads now concerning
[16:46] spiritual gifts Brethren I would not
[16:49] have you
[16:52] ignorant ye know that ye were Gentiles
[16:54] carried away unto these dumb Idols even
[16:57] as ye were L and uh you may uh take your
[17:01] seats so I I I like this Bible verse
[17:05] here um because it shows that there has
[17:09] to be some kind of knowledge uh or
[17:12] knowhow in these spiritual gifts uh uh
[17:15] once we've uh um because the thing about
[17:17] it is the gifts are already in the
[17:19] church and each and every single one of
[17:21] you is a gift from God which means God
[17:24] has designed you and created you your
[17:27] personalities your characteristics the
[17:30] way you act the way you uh think about
[17:33] things God has created every single one
[17:35] of you as a gift so you are the actual
[17:38] uh uh gift right and so God then wants
[17:42] us to uh become knowledgeable about how
[17:46] to operate these gifts uh uh now that
[17:49] they're in the church because we're in
[17:50] the season of restoration and I liked
[17:52] how it says the word restoration because
[17:54] it means that you know your loved ones
[17:56] are gifts too right so just because
[17:59] they're out in the world or they may not
[18:00] be in church they're still God's gifts
[18:03] right and uh everything that God owns he
[18:06] has to restore back uh and I remember I
[18:09] was talking to brother Smiley one time
[18:11] and he said that um it's the gifts that
[18:15] can actually get you in trouble right
[18:17] gifts can actually uh uh uh take you out
[18:19] of the church uh if they're not operated
[18:22] properly right so um and continuing on
[18:26] with this theme uh so is the and uh the
[18:29] important thing about uh gifts and their
[18:31] purpose is it's always to benefit the
[18:34] church right it's it's the one thing
[18:37] that you have to get in your heart is
[18:38] that when God gives you a gift it's
[18:40] never for yourself it's to help somebody
[18:42] else right somebody else is dependent
[18:45] upon your gift or or the talent that God
[18:47] has G you to help them in a real need
[18:50] that they have so before you get into
[18:53] the gifts and various things the first
[18:55] thing you the first thing you need
[18:56] brother Joy was talking about is love
[18:59] right that's the first thing that we
[19:00] need and I believe that spirit and Truth
[19:02] has been grown in love just based off of
[19:05] these past uh sermons so we're
[19:08] understanding that it's love that keeps
[19:10] the thing binded together right and you
[19:13] can never get enough of love because
[19:15] love endures a lot of situations so you
[19:19] might be able to handle you know you
[19:21] might have may have had the love to
[19:23] handle one person in their Spirit but
[19:25] when someone else comes around with a
[19:27] different Spirit or a different
[19:28] challenge you know like how do you react
[19:31] so I like those moments where God where
[19:33] we where we start to grow in a little
[19:35] bit of love and then God throws
[19:37] something in our path to say well do you
[19:39] think you got enough love right so you
[19:41] can never have enough of it something we
[19:43] should always be striving for and when
[19:45] you and when you have real love a real
[19:48] Godly love the gifts are so easy right
[19:51] gifts become uh uh an easy thing to do
[19:54] it's not something you have to chase
[19:56] right but love will bring and you'll see
[19:59] the natural flow of God just manifesting
[20:01] them in our lives and and and again it's
[20:04] to benefit all of us right so if we're
[20:07] not being benefited by gifts in the
[20:09] church something is wrong right so we're
[20:12] going to read uh Corinthians 12 uh 4- 11
[20:17] just to get a kind of foundation on this
[20:21] uh it says now there are diversities of
[20:23] gifts but the same spirit and there are
[20:25] diverse differences of administrations
[20:27] but the same Lord
[20:29] and there are diversities of operations
[20:31] but it's the same God which worketh all
[20:33] in all and that and that that statement
[20:36] right there as we're going to come back
[20:37] to that and it says but the
[20:39] manifestations of the spirit is given to
[20:41] every man to profit with all so it's
[20:43] benefit everybody in the church for to
[20:46] one is given by the spirit of spirit the
[20:48] word of wisdom to another the word of
[20:50] knowledge by The Same Spirit to another
[20:52] Faith by The Same Spirit to another the
[20:54] gifts of healing by The Same Spirit to
[20:56] another the working of Miracles to
[20:58] another prophecy to another Discerning
[21:00] of spirits to another diverse kinds of
[21:02] tongues to another interpretation of
[21:04] tongues but all these worketh that one
[21:08] in the selfs Same Spirit dividing to
[21:10] every man severly as he will so the
[21:14] purpose of these gifts which every one
[21:16] of us has a a different gift so that
[21:19] means there might be something you have
[21:21] that I do not have and the reason why
[21:24] God puts that in place is because you
[21:26] have to humble yourself right it can be
[21:29] hard for people to Humble themselves and
[21:30] come to you and that's why we kind of
[21:32] live in a world today where everybody
[21:34] wants to know everything and be
[21:35] self-sufficient but it just doesn't work
[21:38] right uh back in the day you know it
[21:41] wasn't you never really left your family
[21:44] like nowadays you know people when they
[21:45] get old enough they get 18 years old
[21:47] they'll move across the country they'll
[21:49] move across the world but back then you
[21:52] know it was you were a family unit and
[21:54] you depended upon each other to help
[21:56] each other out you knew that your
[21:58] parents are getting old right and you
[22:00] couldn't take care of them while you
[22:01] living in Tokyo right like your parents
[22:04] needed you there um while they were
[22:06] going through their Old Stage so these
[22:08] different gifts uh um God gives them
[22:12] different to us so that we can all
[22:14] depend on upon each other and the
[22:16] problem is when man gets in the way of
[22:19] the gifts one it can create jealousy
[22:21] because when someone sees that you have
[22:23] something that they don't have well then
[22:25] they become envious but that wasn't the
[22:28] uh that wasn't the true purpose of why
[22:30] God made us all different it was
[22:32] actually to create more love like hey
[22:35] you got something that I don't have that
[22:36] can make me better I need you for this
[22:39] right it was the purpose of it was to
[22:41] create love and an appreciation that
[22:43] every single body in the church is
[22:46] important right so before we get into
[22:50] the uh gifts uh it's important for us to
[22:53] lay down a a foundation right um into
[22:58] catch the important uh sayings in the
[23:00] word so we're going back to the verse
[23:02] where it says but it's but it's it is
[23:05] the same God which worketh all in all uh
[23:08] and the reason I like that is because it
[23:10] applies an emphasis on Godly operation
[23:14] for structure and Order of the gifts
[23:17] right we don't want just we don't want
[23:18] the gifts just running all over the
[23:19] place uh with no purpose or with their
[23:22] own purpose right because then we can't
[23:24] be blessed right and um you know know if
[23:29] you look in the human body everything is
[23:32] structured and organized uh in order for
[23:35] you to be able to get up and do whatever
[23:37] you want you know if you you know I
[23:39] think Barn if you have like arthritis
[23:40] you
[23:41] know you're not your body is not working
[23:43] like it's supposed to but normally you
[23:45] know you would have your your bones will
[23:47] have joints and you'll have fluid in
[23:48] there so that you can move freely
[23:50] without any pain and stuff like that so
[23:52] your body is structured and organized in
[23:54] order to be able to allow you to be free
[23:57] and it's something you don't really
[23:58] think about so your body is not
[24:00] competing with each other your body
[24:01] parts aren't competing with each other
[24:03] everyone's working together so that you
[24:04] can get up move and uh and enjoy the day
[24:07] right so the the pastor mentioned
[24:10] something that was very very uh key
[24:13] thing and that was the way of how song
[24:15] specials go right uh uh uh the order for
[24:19] we have song specials so for example and
[24:22] just to kind of provide emphasis on this
[24:24] thing uh let's say for example brother
[24:26] Solomon was to uh you know he has two
[24:29] people scheduled to sing songs right and
[24:32] the first person comes out and I mean
[24:34] they're just saturated the anointings
[24:36] coming down and it just kind of changes
[24:39] the changes the atmosphere people are
[24:41] being blessed people are being delivered
[24:43] all right and he might keep that special
[24:46] kind of going on and just bring the
[24:48] pastor and bring the pastor or whoever
[24:50] the minister is out just because God is
[24:53] now kind of putting control of the
[24:55] service right and you know
[24:59] uh but the problem with that is that
[25:01] person that was supposed to sing next
[25:03] might get upset because maybe they
[25:05] really wanted to sing you see what I'm
[25:07] saying and the prophet uh talked about
[25:10] um the thing about gifts he said uh
[25:13] gifts always want to be used all right
[25:17] gifts always uh want to be used so we're
[25:19] going to uh turn to this quote uh in
[25:22] question and answers uh 54
[25:25] 0515 and it's paragraph 338 through
[25:29] 340 and I will read uh what the prophet
[25:32] said about
[25:34] this uh I'll just start reading and it
[25:36] says well that's the way it is about
[25:38] speaking in tongues Let It Come orderly
[25:40] just as the spirit will give it you can
[25:43] speak with tongues now you say well
[25:45] brother brandom I can't help it right
[25:47] the uh that's the the their gift of
[25:49] speaking in tongues is coming he said oh
[25:51] yes you can Paul said you could he said
[25:55] if there be one of you among you who
[25:57] speaks with tongues and there's
[25:58] interpreter let him hold his peace no
[26:00] matter how much it wants it wants to
[26:02] speak that's the gift he's talking about
[26:04] in the person hold your peace that's a
[26:07] gift brother I pray God will let me have
[26:09] a Revival here some of these days so we
[26:11] can get into them things for you you see
[26:13] where you can see it's a gift and that
[26:15] gift wants to operate all the time so
[26:18] it's not your fault if you if you if you
[26:21] have a gift and you like I really want
[26:23] to sing it's not your fault for that
[26:25] right God just made you that way as a
[26:27] singer right see but you've got to have
[26:30] the wisdom of the Holy Spirit to know
[26:33] when and how to operate that gift and
[26:37] that's the other part that a lot of
[26:38] Pentecostals don't understand is the
[26:40] operation and the Order of the gift
[26:43] because they just they kind of just kind
[26:44] of go all over the place so and you'll
[26:47] kind of notice it with people that you
[26:49] know people that have a gift of singing
[26:51] you'll notice it because they sing
[26:52] everywhere like I I I work with this one
[26:55] girl and she's a singer and I mean she
[26:57] just
[26:58] sings almost all the time and it's just
[27:01] it's just that gift that she has inside
[27:03] of her where she wants to she wants to
[27:05] sing right uh you know you'll have
[27:07] people that are ministers or preachers
[27:09] you know you'll be you'll be y'all will
[27:11] be out hanging out and then uh you'll
[27:13] see a sunrise you be like man I really
[27:15] love that sunrise and they just they
[27:17] just got to go deep with it like well
[27:18] you know there's nothing like the rising
[27:21] of the sun you know Matthew so and so in
[27:23] your mind you're like look I was just
[27:25] trying to enjoy this sunrise
[27:28] right but that gift inside of that man
[27:31] you know it wants to operate and be used
[27:33] and say something and he and and he he
[27:36] really can't help it right so we have to
[27:40] distinguish that we have to uh
[27:42] understand in our minds that just
[27:43] because it's a gift uh and being used
[27:46] doesn't equate to it being a blessing uh
[27:49] and that's where a lot of people get
[27:51] things wrong just because your gift is
[27:52] being used doesn't mean that it's
[27:54] someone someone is actually being
[27:56] blessed they may be blessed on the flesh
[27:58] but we're trying to get things that go
[28:00] inside of the Soul because that really
[28:02] anchors people into Christ and so uh you
[28:06] can think about it how um back in the
[28:09] day uh you know cuz a lot of times
[28:11] people get dogs and pets and you know
[28:13] everyone loves cute dogs and pets and
[28:15] things like that but dogs were bred for
[28:18] a certain purpose uh back in the day to
[28:20] get some kind of work done right and
[28:23] you'll know that um with hurting dogs or
[28:26] Shepherd dogs a lot of people love
[28:28] German Shepherds and they have this
[28:30] trait that is inside of them where they
[28:32] like to Hur people so you'll see that if
[28:34] you have like a little uh Shepherd dog
[28:36] or a little puppy it has it hasn't seen
[28:39] no cattle or no sheep or anything like
[28:40] that but it'll start nipping at people's
[28:42] ankles right and if you got a toddler
[28:44] it'll start nipping at the toddler's
[28:46] ankles and it's trying to hurt that
[28:48] child because that's what its purpose
[28:50] was and you have to be careful about
[28:52] that because that behavior be can become
[28:54] a negative where then it'll start biting
[28:57] it can cause harm
[28:58] so it's it's doing what it's trying to
[29:00] do because that's what it was bred for
[29:02] but you have to uh make sure that
[29:05] there's some guidance in there so that
[29:06] it doesn't become you know a negative
[29:08] thing right so and gifts that are not
[29:11] properly operated can be uh uh become
[29:14] destructive uh uh and a lot of people
[29:16] don't see that you know so for example
[29:19] which we'll get into later on in the
[29:20] message if I'm able to it's uh the gift
[29:22] of wisdom right wisdom is a gift uh and
[29:27] when not used it can cause a lot of harm
[29:31] uh to people so when you see a lot of
[29:33] people in the world getting into student
[29:35] loans and different kind of loans and
[29:38] they're getting sold on these things is
[29:40] because the people selling the loans got
[29:41] a lot of wisdom and they're trying to
[29:43] sell you something and in your eyes it
[29:45] looks like a green feel it looks like a
[29:48] green pasture that you're hey I'm
[29:49] getting all this money to be able to go
[29:50] to school but you don't see the other
[29:53] side of it right so that wisdom blinded
[29:56] you it's the same wisdom in the
[29:58] beginning when Eve when the serpent came
[30:00] to Eve and said hey hey you take this
[30:01] fruit you're going to be just like God
[30:03] you're going to see all these things and
[30:05] she saw the silver line and she saw the
[30:07] green pasture but what she didn't see
[30:09] was the destruction behind it so that
[30:12] wisdom blinded her right that wisdom is
[30:15] something that uh blinded her and Jesus
[30:18] Christ himself actually used wisdom to
[30:21] blind as well when he told the people
[30:23] unless you drink of my blood and eat of
[30:25] My Flesh you have no part in me right
[30:28] now that wisdom blinded for good right
[30:31] because what it did was it got rid of
[30:33] unbelief it got people it got rid of
[30:35] people that weren't really for God right
[30:38] and that's a good purpose of wisdom
[30:40] right versus a purpose of wisdom that
[30:43] comes into the church and starts uh
[30:46] talking strange doctrines and that can
[30:49] end up dividing a church and I know a
[30:51] lot of you have probably already seen it
[30:53] I've experienced in my life where people
[30:55] will come into the church uh every one
[30:58] is oh we love the Lord we love the Lord
[30:59] but then when it starts coming down to
[31:01] different doctrinal principles uh and
[31:04] things that are a little bit off the off
[31:05] the word you'll see that there's
[31:07] actually a buildup in the Church of
[31:09] people that believe that and all of a
[31:10] sudden the church separates right so
[31:13] that's why uh wisdom has to be used uh
[31:16] in a Godly way uh um if you have that
[31:20] gift of wisdom right um so there's
[31:23] always um and this is to and this is to
[31:26] emphasize um um the god The Godly
[31:30] operations of gifts because there's
[31:31] always two things there's always two
[31:33] ways to do things God way God's way and
[31:35] your way right God's way and your way
[31:39] right so um now the church is is
[31:43] Sovereign in itself and the church can
[31:47] uh uh decide how it wants to operate
[31:49] based off of things like you know how
[31:50] long your song Services some Churches
[31:53] song service is 2 hours preaching is 30
[31:56] minutes now I mean that's how they
[31:59] operate right some people have uh two
[32:01] services on Sunday two services on
[32:03] Saturday right uh and that's how and
[32:06] that's uh uh the way that they operate
[32:08] what time the church start what time
[32:09] what time the church starts and what
[32:11] time it ends it's the sovereignty to
[32:13] choose how they want to operate those
[32:15] things but God can change things up
[32:17] anytime uh and that's the most important
[32:20] part is that you're sensitive to the
[32:22] spirit and how it's operating instead of
[32:25] just how you normally do things from a
[32:26] day-to-day basis right right so that's
[32:28] why you can't just focus on gifts right
[32:31] but you have to focus on God how do you
[32:33] want things to be done right because we
[32:36] have to we have and like I said before
[32:38] we have to realize this is that every
[32:41] single one of us has to bury this down
[32:42] inside of our hearts all the gifts in
[32:45] the church are for you it's not for
[32:47] operation it's not just to it's not to
[32:49] put on a show it's not to uh show that
[32:52] someone is a great singer or someone is
[32:54] a great preacher teacher or whatever
[32:56] it's for you to be able to get something
[32:58] from God with you dealing what you're
[32:59] going through and dealing with something
[33:01] in life right now that is the purpose of
[33:04] the gifts right so you know um when I
[33:09] say that God changes the program or the
[33:12] operation of the gifts it's God changing
[33:15] it but it's your faith that does it
[33:17] right it's your faith that comes down
[33:19] and causes a shift in the way that
[33:22] things are done in order for God to
[33:24] speak to you uh I remember one time
[33:27] sister birs had said that you know she
[33:29] had came up here and she was going to
[33:30] sing a special she said you know I had a
[33:31] special in my mind but God kind of uh
[33:35] told me to come and sing this song What
[33:37] what that was is somebody in church was
[33:39] pulling on God for a specific word and
[33:42] God said hey I want you to sing this
[33:44] song because it's going to touch their
[33:45] heart right so God pulled down on that
[33:48] gift and changed the complete operation
[33:51] of where it was going right um and so um
[33:56] and and it happens in preaching you know
[33:59] if you have a need on your heart right
[34:00] now you know it's uh uh and you need to
[34:03] hear a word from the Lord you can pray
[34:05] in your heart right now and say Lord I
[34:07] need I need the preacher I need you to
[34:09] say something to the preacher that's
[34:10] going to confirm something or help me
[34:12] out in this situation and God would just
[34:14] change the notes God to change the
[34:16] direction of the preaching God to change
[34:18] my ideas God to say no no no no no I
[34:20] need you to start saying about this
[34:21] thing because somebody needs a word
[34:24] right so it's not me up here just trying
[34:26] to uh uh preach a message or talk wisdom
[34:29] or knowledge or all these things I'm
[34:31] trying to help you guys out you guys
[34:33] have needs but you have to pull and God
[34:36] and you can only do it by faith right it
[34:39] has to be by faith it's one of the
[34:41] things it's one of the things that God
[34:43] has uh instituted and we're going to
[34:45] actually get into that uh uh uh a little
[34:47] bit here because the prophet was
[34:51] actually corrected by God in the way
[34:54] that he was operating the healing
[34:56] services so um because they had a system
[34:59] there with uh with these things called
[35:01] prayer cards where you put your name
[35:03] down in the prayer card and they'll
[35:04] randomly call your name up there and
[35:06] then you could go up there before the
[35:07] prophet tell him what you needed and
[35:09] then he would pray for you right but you
[35:12] know how man gets when they get into
[35:15] these systems and you don't know exactly
[35:17] who exactly was getting the prayer cards
[35:19] how often they were getting the prayer
[35:21] cards and so it could be kind of shady
[35:24] and uh it could probably get kind of
[35:25] shady and so God got on brother him and
[35:28] told him that's not the way that it's
[35:29] supposed to be done right because the
[35:32] gift of healing was the prophet right
[35:34] and the prayer cards was a way of man
[35:37] trying to operate within that gift right
[35:40] and God said that the program operates
[35:42] by faith right that's why the prophet
[35:44] you'll hear in the messages the prophet
[35:46] will turn into the audience and be like
[35:47] hey you lady up there that's praying in
[35:49] the balcony uh with the stomach issue
[35:52] God heard you go out here healed right
[35:54] that's the way how it operates uh God
[35:56] will change the service got to change uh
[35:59] uh um the program got to change the
[36:01] mindset of people in order to get a word
[36:04] uh for you right and the prophet taught
[36:07] us that you don't need a a prayer card
[36:09] all you need is Faith so that's kind of
[36:12] the foundational uh uh um um uh the
[36:16] foundations of gifts is that one it's
[36:19] always God's program we're always trying
[36:21] to do what we can do to help the Lord
[36:23] but sometimes uh when someone really
[36:26] really gets down there in Faith uh and
[36:29] it's no different than the woman with
[36:30] the blood issue uh when Jesus was
[36:32] passing through the through the crowd he
[36:34] had a program they they all had a
[36:35] program they all had a destination that
[36:37] we that they were going but this one
[36:39] lady by faith touched Christ and he said
[36:41] well who touched me and we know that it
[36:43] was a touch to Faith and she was able to
[36:45] stop the direction and program of where
[36:47] they were going in order to get
[36:49] something for her
[36:50] situation right so that's the
[36:52] foundational thing first is um
[36:56] understanding that one
[36:58] uh God operates the gifts God operates
[37:01] every single gifts it's not you trying
[37:03] to do anything but it's Lord how do you
[37:05] want to use this gift through me right
[37:07] and then the other thing to remember is
[37:09] that it's the church the gifts are all
[37:11] for you the gifts every single gift is
[37:13] for you in order to help you in your
[37:14] time of need so we're going to start our
[37:17] journey with the gifts um 're we're
[37:20] probably not going to get to all of them
[37:22] um but we're going to start with um
[37:25] corinthians: 128
[37:29] to get our
[37:32] first talk about our first
[37:36] gift 128 yep and I'll just start reading
[37:40] it and it says 4 to one is given by the
[37:43] spirit the word of wisdom to another the
[37:46] word of knowledge by The Same Spirit
[37:49] right um now I went on line to look up
[37:52] what these definitions of were and we're
[37:56] kind of going through this journey
[37:57] because I want you to be able to see if
[37:58] you can identify yourself in the
[38:01] scriptures to know what gifts that you
[38:03] have because I know we've we've talked
[38:05] about how brother uh brother Wesco has a
[38:07] gift of faith everybody knows brother
[38:09] Wesco has a gift of faith and we
[38:11] appreciate that but we want a gift of
[38:13] faith within spirit and Truth Tabernacle
[38:15] so that if I'm going through something
[38:17] because I I mean I don't know how much
[38:19] how big my faith is but if some if one
[38:21] of you has a gift of faith and I need a
[38:24] increase in salary on my job I want to
[38:26] be able to go to you or contact you and
[38:28] say hey can you pray for me so I can get
[38:31] an increase in my salary I want to be I
[38:33] want to be able to humble myself like
[38:34] hey I've been praying and been trying
[38:36] this and trying this and that but I know
[38:38] you have a real gift of faith and I want
[38:40] to come to you and use this thing right
[38:43] that's how it should be we want to be
[38:45] able to identify ourselves but first we
[38:47] have to know what the gifts are and you
[38:48] have to be able to see yourself in that
[38:50] and know how uh to operate it right so
[38:53] with our first Gifts of wisdom and
[38:56] knowledge I looked online line for the
[38:58] definition of wisdom and I found this
[39:01] one that I really really liked and it
[39:04] says that U wisdom allows people to
[39:06] judge what is right true or lasting and
[39:10] I like that key like that last word
[39:12] lasting because it means it's something
[39:14] that is not shaky it's something that's
[39:17] going to be steady right so you know you
[39:20] have a lot of people that may be into
[39:22] Investments and stuff like that and
[39:25] those ones that like to make quick
[39:26] decisions and shortcuts for like the
[39:29] quick profits they don't have a lot of
[39:31] wisdom right A wise person would say no
[39:34] no no no no this is a safe investment
[39:36] this is a safe uh uh place to put your
[39:38] money in because then by the time you
[39:40] get to this age you know you'll actually
[39:43] have a a lot of money invested so it's a
[39:46] lasting decision these W these people
[39:48] with words of wisdom uh or the gift of
[39:51] wisdom are able to give you stuff that
[39:52] will help you to last uh your choosing
[39:55] of a wife or a husband you know they'll
[39:57] say hey hey you want someone that gots
[39:58] the Holy Ghost because that's going to
[40:00] help uh keep your relationship lasting
[40:03] uh uh Through the Ages and through the
[40:05] ups and downs because there's a lot of
[40:07] people that have gotten I wouldn't say
[40:09] words of wisdom but advice or worldly
[40:11] advice on who to marry and marriages
[40:15] have struggled right it did not last
[40:18] because it wasn't a word of wisdom right
[40:22] and I like the definition because it's
[40:25] scriptural and it's really really simple
[40:27] Le uh because when you talk about
[40:29] judging things that are right and true
[40:31] uh the first person that comes to mind
[40:33] is King Solomon right King Solomon we
[40:35] know is one of the wisest people in the
[40:36] Bible and when you talk about King
[40:38] Solomon you have to also talk about the
[40:40] Book of Proverbs right so the gift of
[40:42] wisdom in the church is there for is
[40:45] there to help people make right
[40:46] decisions so uh and just to kind of give
[40:49] an example A lot of people a lot of
[40:52] young ones looking for job opportunities
[40:54] looking where they want to go to school
[40:56] you may not have the gift of wisdom to
[40:58] make that choice and so you have to come
[41:00] to someone in the church and say hey hey
[41:03] hey I'm thinking about going to this
[41:04] school or I'm thinking about taking this
[41:06] career path and someone that has a gift
[41:08] of wisdom if they see that it's a career
[41:10] that could pull you away from God they
[41:12] know that that decision is not a lasting
[41:14] decision they'll say no I wouldn't
[41:16] advise you on that one right I wouldn't
[41:18] advise you to take that career or if
[41:20] they know that the city where your
[41:21] college is is full of sin and could pull
[41:23] you away from God you're like no I don't
[41:25] think you should probably go to that
[41:26] school right and it's not them trying to
[41:29] and and the thing about it you have to
[41:30] understand the gifts are not people but
[41:33] it's Christ in the People speaking to
[41:35] you trying to help you so it's not the
[41:38] individual and a lot of times a lot of
[41:41] times that gets tough because of
[41:45] personalities but Jesus made a comment
[41:47] to kind of erase that thing he said if
[41:49] you can't believe me believe in the
[41:51] words that I tell you he knew that
[41:53] people would struggle with people's
[41:54] personality and I and actually um as as
[41:57] kind of like a a a little testimony to
[42:00] say or experience that I had with my mom
[42:02] cuz my mom has a personality right she's
[42:05] very very like she's a like a bull you
[42:09] know with her decisions and her
[42:10] personality is very kind of like you
[42:12] know she's uh uh I wouldn't say critical
[42:16] but she's always given advice even
[42:18] though you may not want to hear it
[42:21] right I'm trying to be careful because I
[42:23] know if she wants to listen to this I
[42:25] love you
[42:27] I I love
[42:28] [Music]
[42:30] you
[42:31] but she can be very critical in love I
[42:35] know she's doing it out of love and one
[42:37] time I was trying to I was doing some
[42:39] studying because I like to do research
[42:40] on my computer and stuff like that and I
[42:43] was doing some study and I'm all and I
[42:45] said and my mom's like what are you
[42:46] spending your time doing I said well I'm
[42:48] just trying to study you know I'm just
[42:49] trying to you know get a good job so I
[42:51] can save up and this and this and that
[42:53] and all these things she said but yeah
[42:54] but like when do you read your Bible and
[42:56] I I was like wow like you know how you
[42:59] want to be like you want to be know it
[43:01] all but on the inside you know they're
[43:03] telling the truth right and that's how
[43:05] and that's what Jesus meant by that if
[43:07] you can't believe the person at least
[43:09] believe the words they're saying because
[43:10] the words will stay with you have all
[43:12] you want have every issue you are
[43:14] against the person and how they're
[43:15] telling it to you because people have
[43:18] you know extreme personalities where
[43:20] they seem like they're very very pushy
[43:22] with their advice and things like that
[43:24] but if the word is from God that's what
[43:27] sticks on the inside and that what
[43:29] that's what made me realize like you
[43:30] know what she was like you know you
[43:32] don't want to be worshiping that stuff
[43:34] and that kind of hit me in my heart like
[43:35] you know what that's true I need to kind
[43:37] of I need to make a change here right so
[43:41] and that is and that is actually wisdom
[43:44] right that's actually wisdom that she
[43:46] gave me so the gifts in the church are
[43:47] to help people it's not to hurt you or
[43:49] nothing like that it's just sometimes
[43:51] people have different personalities and
[43:54] it can come across as um offensive or
[43:58] you know or just kind of like you all up
[44:01] in my business kind of a feeling but you
[44:04] have to kind of get past that and know
[44:05] that if it's a word from God now because
[44:07] some people got personalities and they
[44:09] don't got no wisdom and they just trying
[44:11] to be bossy they just trying to control
[44:13] you and you just got to you know set
[44:16] that aside but if it is a word from God
[44:19] take the word forget you know forget
[44:21] about the person take the word right so
[44:24] the next uh gift uh uh that uh the Bible
[44:29] talks about is knowledge right and I
[44:32] really couldn't find a definition for
[44:34] this thing because every definition that
[44:37] I was looking for it was like a worldly
[44:39] knowledge where you kind of like you go
[44:41] out you read you gain experiences but
[44:44] that's not the knowledge that God is
[44:45] talking about only thing that I could
[44:47] find that um that we'll kind of type
[44:50] this later is the knowledge or
[44:52] understanding of God and how God does
[44:54] things um in in a particular season and
[44:59] I like that definition because uh uh
[45:02] there's a requirement for some kind of
[45:04] Revelation that you get from God so
[45:06] knowledge is not something that you're
[45:08] going to do that that you're doing to go
[45:10] and get uh it's something that God gives
[45:13] you right God and uh uh God gives you
[45:16] this knowledge or reveals or opens the
[45:18] word uh to you because I did my research
[45:21] online and the Bible says that uh it
[45:24] said well not the Bible but the Genesis
[45:26] world record says the Bible still holds
[45:28] the first place for the most books ever
[45:32] sold uh and I believe it's like there's
[45:34] like five billion books um copies that
[45:37] are sold uh so if just reading your
[45:41] Bible was all that was required uh um
[45:45] and there was no gift of knowledge there
[45:47] should be a lot more people filled with
[45:48] the Holy Spirit but it's not we can tell
[45:51] uh uh based off of uh the way that the
[45:54] world is going right so the Gifts of
[45:57] knowledge in the church are individuals
[45:59] that God has designed and reveals the
[46:02] word to them they're able to look at a
[46:04] Bible verse and say oh wow you may look
[46:06] at a Bible verse and get like this much
[46:08] but when someone that has a gift of
[46:10] knowledge in the church reads a Bible
[46:11] verse it's way way way way more deeper
[46:15] right and you're able to perceive more
[46:17] light U from them so we just want to
[46:19] kind of get an example of that and we're
[46:20] going to turn to acts uh chapter 8 and
[46:24] read verses 29-31
[46:32] uh and it reads here it says then the
[46:34] spirit said unto Phillip and I like this
[46:36] because this is the spirit which is
[46:40] Jesus Christ talking to philli telling
[46:41] him to go and do something right he says
[46:44] go near and join thyself to this Chariot
[46:46] and Philip ran thither to him and heard
[46:48] him read the prophet isias and said
[46:52] understandest thou what thou readest and
[46:54] he said how can I accept except some man
[46:58] should guide me so this unic didn't know
[47:01] right this unic didn't have any kind of
[47:03] knowledge of what he was reading so God
[47:06] then used uh Phillip who has the gift of
[47:09] knowledge to be able to come and help
[47:11] someone understand what they're reading
[47:13] and that is one of and that's one of the
[47:16] reasons why a lot of people can fall
[47:18] away from the message because you know
[47:20] you may not have the gift of knowledge
[47:22] you may not have the gift of wisdom and
[47:24] you have to depend on somebody else to
[47:26] reveal that to you because if you try to
[47:28] understand it yourself you won't be able
[47:30] to God didn't make you to be able to see
[47:33] that and then all a sudden you trick
[47:34] yourself up it's hard for you to believe
[47:36] then you fall away from the message or
[47:38] you just fall away completely from God
[47:40] because you didn't understand it but
[47:41] this unic had a different spirit and he
[47:44] said how can I accept some man should
[47:47] guide me so you have to be humble enough
[47:49] to know that I don't know everything I
[47:52] may not have all the knowledge I may not
[47:54] have all the understanding and I need
[47:55] someone to come and and show and break
[47:58] the bread Revelation so that I can
[48:01] understand these things
[48:03] right and uh that is the that is the
[48:05] gift of knowledge and Proverbs we're
[48:07] going to read Proverbs
[48:09] 99-1 because this kind of sums up what
[48:13] we've been kind of talking to like I
[48:15] said if you want wisdom uh uh uh
[48:18] Proverbs is the book to go to and
[48:21] Proverbs n in Proverbs 9 reads give
[48:23] instruction to a wise man and he will be
[48:25] yet wiser teach a just man and he will
[48:28] increase in learning right so give
[48:30] instruction instruction and wisdom are
[48:32] liken to uh together because uh uh um
[48:37] wisdom gives instruction for you right
[48:40] then it says teach a just man and he
[48:41] will increase in learning knowledge
[48:43] knowledge helps you to increase what you
[48:45] know and it says the fear of the Lord is
[48:47] the beginning of wisdom and the
[48:49] knowledge of the Holy is understanding
[48:53] right so that's just kind of uh to
[48:54] iterate off of that and then and the uh
[48:57] we're going to turn to the uh we're
[48:59] going to be closing soon but we're going
[49:00] to turn to the message uh question and
[49:02] answers 54 uh 0516 paragraph 28 through
[49:08] through 31 uh to kind of just
[49:11] show
[49:13] um how these gifts of wisdom and
[49:16] knowledge and understanding how it's
[49:17] something that comes from God and I just
[49:20] start reading while she uh pulls it up
[49:23] so it says we're going to read the
[49:24] middle of it it says this is a greater
[49:26] portion of the Holy Spirit and then when
[49:28] you receive the baptism of the Holy
[49:29] Ghost that is the completion of the Holy
[49:31] Ghost taking up its Abode in you to
[49:33] manifest gifts speaking with tongues
[49:35] interpretation of tongues Gifts of power
[49:37] wisdom knowledge understanding the man
[49:39] said last night said where did you get
[49:42] your education for these things well
[49:44] said I've come out of great seminars and
[49:46] we've never had such as that ever taught
[49:49] in a seminar that I ever heard I said it
[49:52] didn't come from Seminary I said I'm
[49:54] poor with a seventh grade education 10
[49:56] 15 years ago I couldn't hardly write my
[49:58] own name and I cannot do much better
[50:00] today but it comes through inspiration
[50:03] see I said then watch it um he said why
[50:07] he said you never watch where you're
[50:08] going in the Bible you just grab the
[50:09] thing and run all through the Bible and
[50:11] said it just comes uh right all together
[50:14] right um so this is what the prophet is
[50:18] because we know the prophet had a gift
[50:19] of knowledge and wisdom and here's the
[50:21] prophet solidifying that it's something
[50:23] that God gives you that is in the church
[50:26] and you could spend I mean you can spend
[50:28] years reading your Bible you could go to
[50:30] Seminary School you could uh um I know
[50:33] some people try to read the Bible um
[50:35] from the beginning to the end verse by
[50:37] verse by verse by verse but that does
[50:39] not give you knowledge and wisdom right
[50:42] going to someone that has knowledge and
[50:44] wisdom that God has gifted uh will give
[50:47] you those things right um now there is a
[50:52] difference between wisdom and knowledge
[50:54] and just because you have a gift of
[50:55] wisdom doesn't mean that you have the
[50:57] gift of knowledge and vice versa um and
[51:01] the key thing about these two things
[51:03] because you have to watch for watch for
[51:04] these things in the church which is why
[51:07] our foundation was it has to be God
[51:09] operating these things it has to be God
[51:11] showing you uh what to say uh and what
[51:13] to think uh the key things is that the
[51:16] key thing in this uh um this whole thing
[51:18] is that the gifts are given by the
[51:19] spirit and they should be operated by
[51:21] the spirit and when they operate by the
[51:23] spirit they're going to work together so
[51:24] we're going to turn to acts 191 1
[51:26] through six to kind of see example of
[51:29] how these gifts will operate
[51:37] together and it reads and it came to
[51:39] pass that while Apollos was at Corinth
[51:42] Paul having passed through the upper
[51:43] Coast came to Ephesus and finding
[51:45] certain disciples he said unto them have
[51:47] you received the Holy Ghost since you
[51:49] believe and they said unto him we have
[51:51] not so much as heard whether there be
[51:53] any holy ghosts so they didn't know now
[51:57] they they had wisdom because they were
[51:58] disciples right in order for you to be a
[52:00] disciple you got to have wisdom because
[52:02] a disciple is someone that receives
[52:04] instruction right so they had wisdom
[52:07] they have some knowledge too but in this
[52:09] Bible verse we see that they don't know
[52:11] anything about the Holy Ghost right and
[52:13] he said unto them unto what then were
[52:16] you baptized and they said unto and they
[52:17] said unto John's baptism then said Paul
[52:20] John verely baptized with a baptism of
[52:22] repentance saying unto the people that
[52:25] there should believe on him which should
[52:27] come after him that is on Christ Jesus
[52:30] the B and the Bible says when they heard
[52:32] this they were baptized in the name of
[52:33] the Lord Jesus Christ so they all they
[52:35] received Knowledge from Paul that they
[52:37] did not have right uh and this is all
[52:40] just to emphasize that um and this is
[52:43] the only two that we're going to get to
[52:44] today but a lot of people in the church
[52:46] have gifts of Faith uh people uh the
[52:49] Bible says there are Gifts of healing uh
[52:51] and it's plural Gifts of healing because
[52:53] some of you can sing I know Sister sh
[52:55] sung a song one time and somebody was
[52:57] healed from that uh gifts on the
[52:59] instrument can heal people uh a lot of
[53:01] you have a a Word of Faith to someone
[53:04] that can heal somebody you know a lot of
[53:06] you are prayer warriors I remember when
[53:08] I first became a Christian and I heard
[53:10] about people praying all night I was
[53:12] like man I'm going to go do this got in
[53:13] my closet and like after five minutes I
[53:16] was like you know
[53:18] what I'mma leave that to whoever can do
[53:22] it cuz I don't I was like man what do I
[53:25] say but some people just have that gift
[53:28] where they just know how to pray and
[53:30] keep praying and keep praying to break
[53:32] through it's a gift it's just the way
[53:34] God made them and we need people like
[53:36] that to pray for people in the church uh
[53:39] you know there are Gifts of prophecies
[53:40] you know some people will say prophetic
[53:42] word to you out of inspiration uh
[53:44] another another um something from that
[53:48] is the uh dreams dreams are a prophecy
[53:51] right Joseph had dreams and someone
[53:53] could have a dream about your situation
[53:55] right and so all these things are inside
[53:57] the church and they're they're in each
[54:00] and every every single one of us and so
[54:02] what we need to learn to do is to one
[54:05] yield ourselves to God to show us you
[54:07] know what purpose do we have here right
[54:10] cuz I could be dealing with something
[54:12] and if you're a dreamer and you you can
[54:14] have a dream to help me out I want the
[54:16] dream right and it just goes to show
[54:20] also that um you know the the streaming
[54:24] right I and I and there's nothing wrong
[54:26] with streaming right cuz you know you
[54:27] have a lot of people that go on the
[54:28] stream if you're in a situation on
[54:30] vacation or there's some kind of you
[54:32] know emergency and you have to stream
[54:33] there's nothing wrong with that right
[54:35] but we need the gifts inside of the
[54:38] church not watching on the stream right
[54:42] if I could you know if I could just wake
[54:44] up and just tell my arms and legs to
[54:46] like disconnect and go to work for me
[54:48] and I'm just going to sit up in bed
[54:50] right I mean it's not possible right God
[54:54] wants the full body God wants his full
[54:56] body God wants his gifts God wants all
[55:00] all all of all of all of what he
[55:01] designed inside you he wants that inside
[55:03] of the church because a lot of times you
[55:06] know and that's why I remember one time
[55:08] we was with the youth and we were all
[55:10] talking together and they were talking
[55:12] about this one girl that kind of had
[55:14] left the message and stuff like that and
[55:15] they were saying oh yeah so and so left
[55:17] and all this and this and that and in my
[55:19] heart you know I'm thinking like well no
[55:22] what can we do to get her back cuz what
[55:24] you don't know if if that's a gift to
[55:26] God God that means they could have an
[55:29] answer to your problem and while they're
[55:31] out there in the world God's trying to
[55:33] use that because you have to understand
[55:35] that God has gifts that God God has
[55:38] individuals that he can only use those
[55:40] individuals for a specific job so while
[55:43] the people in Nineveh were living in sin
[55:45] and all that stuff and Jonah was now
[55:48] backsliding right their time of
[55:49] Deliverance was delayed because Jonah
[55:53] was not in his position all right so we
[55:56] want to pray for the ones that are
[55:58] backsliding we want to pray for the ones
[55:59] that are lost because they may have a
[56:01] word for what you need right now but
[56:04] right now they're in a place where
[56:05] they're backslid and they're in a
[56:06] position where they can't be in the
[56:08] presence of the Lord in order for that
[56:10] gift to be released and for you to
[56:13] receive uh your healing or any
[56:15] Deliverance that you need right so we're
[56:18] going to end this in the uh end this in
[56:20] a word of
[56:22] prayer Lord Jesus Christ we come before
[56:25] you oh Lord God we thank you oh Lord God
[56:28] for the gifts that you've given us oh
[56:30] Lord God lord we know that we can't
[56:33] operate these gifts on our own oh Lord
[56:35] God and they just they just want to go
[56:37] wild and be used whenever they can oh
[56:40] Lord God but we know that you're a God
[56:42] of order oh Lord Jesus when you came
[56:44] down and you designed the garden oh Lord
[56:46] God you made the Sun and the Moon you
[56:49] made the animals you made the plants and
[56:51] it was all order to it Lord Jesus Christ
[56:54] because there's no blessing in chaos oh
[56:57] Lord God there's no blessing in and
[56:59] selfishness oh Lord Jesus Christ so Lord
[57:02] we want to ask you to come into our
[57:04] lives as we're going through this year
[57:06] of restoration oh Lord God and we see
[57:09] that you're already restoring things oh
[57:11] Lord God and that means ultimately
[57:13] you're going to restore the gifts to the
[57:15] church oh Lord Jesus Christ Lord we know
[57:17] that you're going to give us a building
[57:19] oh Lord Jesus Christ which is going to
[57:21] invite more people oh Lord God but Lord
[57:23] we want to make sure oh Lord God that as
[57:25] the people come oh Lord this isn't a
[57:28] place just for a a a gift party oh Lord
[57:31] no we want to make sure everything is
[57:33] operating so that people are blessed oh
[57:35] Lord Jesus Christ people are struggling
[57:38] oh Lord God people need healing in their
[57:40] bodies oh Lord God and you have a
[57:42] specific individual out there that can
[57:45] touch that need oh Lord God lord it may
[57:47] not be through the preaching oh Lord it
[57:49] may not it may not be a um through a
[57:52] prayer it may be in the song service oh
[57:54] Lord God it may be through a brother
[57:56] just calling up another brother asking
[57:58] how they're doing oh Lord Jesus Christ
[58:00] oh Lord there's so many ways that you
[58:02] can bring healing that you can bring
[58:03] comfort that you can bring Deliverance
[58:05] oh Lord God and we want to be available
[58:08] for that Lord Jesus Christ oh Lord we
[58:10] ask that you help us as we go through
[58:12] the week oh Lord God bless those that
[58:14] are afflicted in harm oh Lord we ask it
[58:16] in the precious name of Jesus Christ
[58:18] amen

[1:01:41] I will I appreciate the Simplicity in
[1:01:43] which he he brought that amen those
[1:01:46] gifts amen that's why you know we need
[1:01:49] one another my hand can't do what my
[1:01:51] feet can
[1:01:52] do my eyes can't do what my nose can do
[1:01:56] each and every one of them in the body

[1:02:01] them all amen he's we're the temple the
[1:02:04] Temple of the Holy Ghost but ain't no
[1:02:06] ain't no one person doing it all amen
[1:02:09] like he said some are prayer
[1:02:12] warriors some some some some uh uh uh
[1:02:16] God may want us uh that gift of wisdom
[1:02:19] he was talking about that's why you know
[1:02:21] a lot of times I'm how old am I 55 or 56
[1:02:26] I get confused you know once you get
[1:02:28] once you gets past 50 you kind of stop
[1:02:31] counting a little
[1:02:34] bit somewhere around in
[1:02:36] there and I still seek
[1:02:41] counsel but we have young folks that
[1:02:44] refuse to seat counsel when you're
[1:02:47] making the most important decisions of
[1:02:49] your
[1:02:50] life even to this day I seek counsel I
[1:02:54] seek counsel and and I pray amen and
[1:02:58] then I wait for
[1:02:59] confirmation see cuz the Bible say out
[1:03:01] of the MTH 2 or3 let everything be
[1:03:04] established so sometime I I I I I'll go
[1:03:07] to my pastor and I and I'll get his
[1:03:09] advice and I okay I heard what the
[1:03:12] pastor say I'm praying on that thing and
[1:03:15] a guest Minister may come and hit that
[1:03:17] thing say oh thank you Lord and then you
[1:03:20] know what somebody I don't even know may
[1:03:24] not even be saved May come back come
[1:03:26] right back around and confirm that thing
[1:03:28] I say thank you Lord Jesus see he has a
[1:03:30] way of speaking to
[1:03:33] you he has a way of speaking to you
[1:03:35] where you know and he'll take away all
