[43:20] scripture and
[43:24] that I told Brother Troy I was
[43:28] studying
[43:31] um all
[43:35] week and I changed my thought last
[43:39] night okay well let's let's start at the
[43:42] first verse of 1 Samuel chapter 16 and
[43:46] the Lord and the Lord said unto Samuel
[43:49] how long will thou mourn for Saul seeing
[43:52] that I have rejected
[43:55] him uh reigning over Israel fill thy
[44:00] thine horn with oil and gold I will send
[44:03] thee to Jesse the bethlehemite for I
[44:07] have uh provided me a king amongst his
[44:10] sons and Samuel said how can I go if if
[44:15] Saul hear it he will kill me and the
[44:18] Lord said take a heer and
[44:21] uh with thee and say I come to sacrifice
[44:25] to the Lord and call Jesse to the
[44:27] sacrifice and I will show thee what Thou
[44:30] shalt do and thou shalt anoint me anoint
[44:34] unto me him whom uh I name unto thee let
[44:39] us maybe skip down to like the 11 verse
[44:41] in in uh Samuel said unto
[44:45] Jesse I hear all thy children and he
[44:48] said there remaineth yet uh the youngest
[44:52] and behold he keepeth the sheep and uh
[44:55] Samuel said unto Jesse send and fetch
[44:57] him for we would not sit down till uh he
[45:01] come hither and he sent and brought him
[45:04] in now he was uh Ruddy and with all and
[45:08] of a beautiful countenance and and
[45:10] goodly to to look to and the Lord said
[45:14] arise anoint him for this is is he then
[45:19] Samuel took the Horn of oil and anointed
[45:22] him in the midst of his Brethren and the
[45:24] spirit of the Lord Came Upon David from
[45:27] that day forward so uh Samuel uh rose up
[45:32] and went to Rama let's just bow heads
[45:35] for a word of prayer and if they could
[45:37] pull up Romans chapter 8 uh verse 17 and
[45:41] 18 for me gracious father we just come
[45:44] this morning to give thanks and praise
[45:45] for just allowing us this opportunity to
[45:48] be able to come
[45:50] into fellowship and to just try to share
[45:53] something that will just strengthen us
[45:56] oh God for the journey that we're on
[45:58] Lord we just appreciate you we ask that
[46:00] you would bless the pastor and his
[46:02] family Lord God um as they um journey
[46:06] and travel and enjoy Lord and we just
[46:09] pray that father God um that you just
[46:12] watch over them and keep them we ask
[46:14] that you just anoint me this morning
[46:17] give me a touch in in in the body Lord
[46:19] I'm kind of feeling a little achy this
[46:22] morning but Lord we reporting for Duty
[46:25] and as the service go go on May you just
[46:28] give me a a mighty touch we thank you
[46:30] for all things in Jesus name amen amen
[46:33] you may be seated this
[46:35] morning okay just another little
[46:38] scripture I like to read Romans uh 8:17
[46:41] and 18 it says and if children then
[46:45] heirs uh Hees of God and join HS with
[46:48] Christ if if so be that we suffer with
[46:51] him that we may be also glorified
[46:55] together
[46:57] for we reckon that the suffering of this
[46:59] present time are not worthy to be
[47:01] compared with the glory which shall be
[47:03] revealed in US amen may the Lord add a
[47:07] blessing to the reading of his word this
[47:09] morning uh we we just like to uh use as
[47:13] a little topic this morning like we say
[47:16] I I kind of changed I had something for
[47:18] two weeks in my mind but uh I just felt
[47:23] of the Lord to change we want to talk
[47:25] this morning on fit to Ru
[47:27] rule fit to
[47:30] rule um when when we look at this little
[47:34] passage of scripture it it it really
[47:38] shows us something um uh you
[47:42] know the prophet makes a statement and I
[47:45] got it in the quote he said you know God
[47:47] is featured in
[47:49] character right and one of the things we
[47:53] find uh uh the spirit of God left Saul
[47:57] because uh Saul kind of got himself away
[48:01] from uh the word of God and the the the
[48:05] mandates that was set by God is that
[48:07] right and so you know um uh man man and
[48:13] our understanding we have our Concepts
[48:16] and precepts about what a what a a a
[48:20] leader should be or man of God should be
[48:24] and God has his uh
[48:27] understanding his thoughts about you
[48:30] know what what a servant of God should
[48:32] be is that right sir amen and uh we we
[48:36] we we just like have to keep in the
[48:39] order of scriptures one thing we we we
[48:42] got to be able to follow God through the
[48:45] scripture and we find God always
[48:47] identified by its
[48:49] characteristics right and and outside of
[48:52] that um uh you won't see God identified
[48:55] in it is that right
[48:57] uh because if if it's if that's the case
[49:00] it it starts to break the patterns of
[49:03] the scriptures is that right and God
[49:05] always wants to re remain in in
[49:08] scripture so so you know what what we
[49:11] find here is that um uh God God had his
[49:16] man that he wanted to bring on the scene
[49:18] to to express him right Express a
[49:24] character right but you know uh he he
[49:27] was he was chosen and anointed by God is
[49:31] that right he was he was given a a a uh
[49:36] a a mandate from God that he would he
[49:39] would uh be in this position he would be
[49:43] in this place is that right but one of
[49:45] the things that that you know in in
[49:49] studying uh scripture and just looking
[49:52] at life
[49:53] also um there something that goes go
[49:56] along with being placed in a position of
[50:01] of authority is that right and and and
[50:05] and one of those things is is is
[50:08] responsibility sir right sir and
[50:11] weight I'mma say that again one of the
[50:15] things that goes along with uh being in
[50:18] a position of of
[50:21] leadership right no matter no matter
[50:23] what it is whether it's it's on a job
[50:26] whether it's in the church whether it's
[50:28] in the
[50:29] home uh and I wish I would have learned
[50:32] this early
[50:34] on right if I could have if I could have
[50:36] understood these these these principles
[50:40] of of the scriptures from a youth
[50:44] up right I I want to I want to stop just
[50:47] a minute and and share something with we
[50:49] we got a lot of young men and we got a
[50:51] lot of young sisters and and even some
[50:54] of us older we we're not too old to to
[50:57] learn because I I've still been in a
[50:59] season of learning yes sir Amen in a in
[51:03] a season of of of
[51:07] understanding responsibility in the
[51:09] weight of the
[51:11] responsibility that that uh I supposed
[51:14] to Bear right being in a position of
[51:18] leadership right um we we we find that
[51:23] you know God had called him and anointed
[51:26] him but one of the things that that
[51:30] David did not comprehend was the
[51:34] process right how many people have ever
[51:37] been been promoted to a a position on
[51:40] the
[51:41] jobs there's there's a a a steps there's
[51:45] a
[51:47] process that that you have to go through
[51:51] or or if you're Desiring a a higher
[51:55] level of
[51:57] positioning that there's there's steps
[52:01] there's a process to get you to this
[52:05] place right so so you know uh God is
[52:10] Sovereign right and I realize that more
[52:13] and more as I as I I grow and I mature
[52:16] and I age I realize the the sovereignty
[52:20] of God and and how how God has you know
[52:25] even way back in things that I did not
[52:28] understand as as a young man and at 62
[52:31] I'm I'm still kind of learning you know
[52:34] instead in the
[52:35] scripture what we find U was was you
[52:39] know David had to go through a process
[52:43] he was he was called and he was anointed
[52:46] for the position right but it took about
[52:50] a 20 years span according to history for
[52:53] him to actually amen obtain came to this
[52:57] position of of of King is that right but
[53:02] but through through 20
[53:05] years uh um he was he was going through
[53:09] a
[53:11] process that you know what he probably
[53:14] didn't even amen grasp initially because
[53:18] you know in in reading the whole story
[53:21] of of of uh Saul and and David you know
[53:26] we we we we like to tell about the story
[53:29] of how David uh uh killed Goliath and
[53:33] and that just kind of started things for
[53:35] him right and then you know he he he ran
[53:38] the Philistines and he came back and and
[53:41] you know the sisters was all happy and
[53:44] and they were singing Saul his thousands
[53:47] and David his 10,
[53:50] thousands right and and from that point
[53:54] now David not realizing
[53:57] uh uh uh that he was going to go through
[54:00] this this
[54:02] process right before he could obtain
[54:05] amen this position in place because I
[54:08] want to say something amen the these
[54:11] things the the process is is about
[54:16] experience right yes sir and giving
[54:21] Insight right right right let me say
[54:23] that again ahead the process is about
[54:27] experience and and getting Insight so
[54:32] when you get to this position you'll
[54:35] have something when you get there yes
[54:37] sir amen amen right I'm going say that
[54:41] again Lord so when you get there you'll
[54:44] have something when you get there
[54:47] there's a lot of people that that that
[54:49] want to want want positions you know
[54:51] young men want wives and things of that
[54:55] nature
[54:56] uhhuh but you know what amen when they
[55:00] get there they don't have anything amen
[55:02] because they don't a lot of times have
[55:04] any
[55:05] experiences is that right and and
[55:08] there's a lot that goes uh uh into these
[55:12] positions responsibility and weight amen
[55:16] yes sir right and and so it's the
[55:20] process is beneficial
[55:24] right even when you don't think it the
[55:28] pro whatever you going through this
[55:30] morning is
[55:32] beneficial cuz even in in the readings
[55:35] here in second 1 Samuel if you go
[55:39] through and you read the whole uh story
[55:42] of of the interaction of of David and
[55:46] Saul um there's times where even David
[55:51] question Jonathan like man I can't
[55:54] comprehend why is it why is it that he
[55:57] feel the way that he feel about me why
[56:01] why is and we all have been there why is
[56:04] this happening to me right right right
[56:08] yes sir it's it's because it's it's it's
[56:11] necessary it's it's needed for our
[56:15] benefit for when when we when we get to
[56:18] this position in place we'll have
[56:21] something when we get there is that
[56:24] right come on Church yeah amen it's it's
[56:27] it's so the
[56:29] process right is
[56:32] essential you know and looking at the
[56:34] scriptures this morning I I saw saw in
[56:37] the scriptures something that you know I
[56:39] didn't see through time it it it was
[56:42] what God
[56:45] allowed because God gave him the
[56:47] commission yes sir God placed the
[56:50] anointing upon him right sir and God
[56:54] allowed him to go through through this
[56:57] process to build character amen sir amen
[57:02] right to to build a character because uh
[57:06] Power without character is satanic yes
[57:10] it is all right and and it's impossible
[57:14] to rule apart from the character amen
[57:19] sir is that right we all can say Amen to
[57:21] that we all we've all dealt with bosses
[57:24] who didn't have character
[57:27] abuse of of
[57:29] authority is that right oh glory to God
[57:33] people that that that you know was
[57:36] placed in positions but when it comes
[57:40] down to uh uh the character and fully
[57:46] understanding all of the responsibility
[57:48] and the weight of the position and all
[57:50] of those different things somewhere they
[57:53] miss some classes
[57:56] y'all ought to talk to me can I get one
[57:59] person that'll preach with me this
[58:01] morning huh it's it's it's some and you
[58:05] know it's so unfortunate it's so
[58:08] unfortunate uh in in society today that
[58:12] uh uh it's a lot of classes being
[58:16] missed it's it's a lot of things that
[58:19] that's not being comprehended now I can
[58:22] preach to myself because you know as a
[58:25] Christian since 1988 it's like sometimes
[58:28] I look back and like where was I when
[58:30] they were giving out that lesson that
[58:32] class maybe you know you know like some
[58:35] folk they sleep in
[58:38] class y'all don't to talk to me I know
[58:41] what I'm talking about boy I was in high
[58:43] school boy look here it be some of the
[58:45] mornings my head be down boy I be out of
[58:47] it but it was it was things that I
[58:50] needed while I was
[58:52] sleeping yes sir I said I said something
[58:57] yes you did see it's it's things that
[58:59] are needed while we're
[59:02] sleeping while while we're sleeping
[59:05] through the through the the process is
[59:07] that right and so Saul Saul gets go Saul
[59:12] and and see here's the thing God allowed
[59:15] Saul to get in this
[59:17] position right to help mold a
[59:21] character uh uh in David to ex to
[59:28] express to his his his future
[59:32] congregants or his his men what what
[59:36] true uh uh character entails and it and
[59:42] something that that that you know um I
[59:45] was looking at and and reading in 1
[59:48] Samuel 16 on on out it was a word that
[59:53] was used and you know we we know uh uh
[59:58] uh David learned how to duck uh
[1:00:02] javelins right and and one of the things
[1:00:05] that the scripture say through all of
[1:00:07] those things just to kind of paraphrase
[1:00:09] now y'all go back and and and read in
[1:00:11] there and you it says he he kind of
[1:00:13] moved
[1:00:15] wisely he he he moved it it means he
[1:00:19] moved in in
[1:00:21] humility right and and let me tell you
[1:00:24] something that bother salt yes sir that
[1:00:29] that that affected that that put that
[1:00:32] now I'm saying something be because you
[1:00:35] know you you got to learn how to
[1:00:38] overcome you got to learn how to
[1:00:40] navigate you got to learn how to operate
[1:00:43] yes sir when even when javelins right
[1:00:47] amen for seemingly no apparent
[1:00:50] reason right amen javins was was being
[1:00:55] uh thrown at David and and and if if if
[1:00:59] you you know you you you lack
[1:01:02] perspective you'll think it's not for
[1:01:04] anything right but but that's something
[1:01:08] amen that God is trying to get us to
[1:01:11] learn and understanding everything that
[1:01:13] we go through amen amen right amen
[1:01:17] everything has
[1:01:19] marit even even when we don't understand
[1:01:22] it like we were saying you know in
[1:01:24] Reading uh there was was a time where
[1:01:26] David was was uh uh talking to Jonathan
[1:01:30] and I said like man what why is your dad
[1:01:34] doing this to me Lord right he he had
[1:01:38] questions not really
[1:01:40] realizing you know it was it was God
[1:01:43] allowing him to to go through these
[1:01:47] things to benefit him yes sir and a lot
[1:01:51] of times you know and and I'm a living
[1:01:54] witness cuz there's been times where I
[1:01:56] you know I've sat in my room or been
[1:01:58] driving in my car and and and you know
[1:02:02] questioning
[1:02:04] God right questioning wh well why why
[1:02:08] did this happen and and you know y'all
[1:02:11] know how we get come on why did this
[1:02:14] happen and and you know you question
[1:02:16] yourself and you look at you know you
[1:02:19] you go back on your your your history
[1:02:22] and you you look at things and you like
[1:02:25] but I can't can't figure but but God
[1:02:28] knows that what you going through if not
[1:02:32] now somewhere down the line You'll
[1:02:34] benefit from it yes sir or somebody will
[1:02:39] benefit from your
[1:02:43] experiences sir cuz you can't teach what
[1:02:46] you ain't got right
[1:02:48] amen you can't talk about what you ain't
[1:02:51] got you can't talk about what you have
[1:02:54] not experienced
[1:02:57] right
[1:02:58] amen glory to God but when you go
[1:03:01] through some things see David could talk
[1:03:05] about amen how to uh Dodge and and and
[1:03:09] get out of way of danger right
[1:03:13] amen amen not from an intellectual stem
[1:03:17] but because of
[1:03:19] experience yes sir right sir you know he
[1:03:22] probably say man you got to move your
[1:03:24] body like this and you got to you know
[1:03:26] what I'm saying come
[1:03:28] on you know you become a Craftsman at at
[1:03:32] dodging right oh glory to God now I just
[1:03:36] said something but I know you missed
[1:03:39] it sometimes you got to you got to be
[1:03:41] crafty at at at
[1:03:43] dodging right cuz cuz people people uh
[1:03:48] try to be
[1:03:50] subtle and crafty in the way that they
[1:03:53] they throw things out there
[1:03:56] y'all ought to preach with me I feel I'm
[1:03:58] starting to feel good come on the cuz
[1:04:01] the natural types the spiritual exactly
[1:04:05] right and so it's it's through our
[1:04:08] experience we we learn how to to to
[1:04:12] dodge things and and and
[1:04:16] express amen a a a form of
[1:04:19] humility that brings fear to the
[1:04:23] enemy yes sir like the say this just
[1:04:26] ain't no ordinary person here hallu this
[1:04:30] this just ain't no ordinary brother this
[1:04:33] ain't no ordinary sister that I'm
[1:04:35] dealing with be because if if I would
[1:04:38] have throw this at you
[1:04:40] know certain folks it might have been
[1:04:43] different the attitude might have been
[1:04:46] different right but we're dealing with a
[1:04:49] man after God's Own Heart Hallelujah
[1:04:52] that's powerful Church see we got to
[1:04:55] recognize something you know we're just
[1:04:57] not anybody right we're we're we're
[1:05:01] we're we're people after God's Own Heart
[1:05:04] we're we're we're the chosen we're we're
[1:05:06] the elected by God we anointed amen of
[1:05:11] God is that right to be in the position
[1:05:14] come on that we're in and a lot of times
[1:05:17] amen people can't comprehend that oh
[1:05:20] they think they this and all they all
[1:05:23] stuck up and
[1:05:26] you know it's it's like you know you
[1:05:28] can't help being God's
[1:05:30] chosen true well praise the
[1:05:34] Lord you can you you can't help that God
[1:05:38] predestinated you before the foundation
[1:05:41] of the world right right you can't help
[1:05:44] that God saw in you
[1:05:46] something is that right yes sir and pred
[1:05:50] see you're you're not just here Amen on
[1:05:52] your own accord you're here because God
[1:05:55] pred destinated you before the
[1:05:57] foundation of the world to be here yes
[1:06:00] sir but also in being here there's a
[1:06:05] responsibility right yes sir there's a
[1:06:08] responsibility that's been given I think
[1:06:10] one of the preachers was talking about
[1:06:12] uh uh in the last few weeks uh uh a
[1:06:16] gospel of reconciliation yes sir right
[1:06:19] yes sir see that there there's a whole
[1:06:22] lot that that that goes along with with
[1:06:26] with with being a people of
[1:06:29] God right that that really warrants
[1:06:33] Insight on our
[1:06:36] behalf glory to God it it really does it
[1:06:40] warrants amen Insight am see you know
[1:06:45] cuz cuz you see you'll see a lot of
[1:06:48] carnality right but one of the things
[1:06:51] the prophet makes a statement he say we
[1:06:53] pay for neglect
[1:06:56] wow I'm G to say that one again that
[1:06:58] felt good we we pay for we pay for
[1:07:03] younger generation you pay for
[1:07:07] neglect come on see one of one of the
[1:07:11] things that that Solomon Solomon taught
[1:07:14] his his his sons was to uh in getting
[1:07:18] get understanding that's right right
[1:07:21] never put yourself in in such a place
[1:07:25] where where you you
[1:07:27] refuse uh real Godly spiritual Insight
[1:07:33] something that'll help you
[1:07:36] navigate right something that'll help
[1:07:38] you you you you navigate amen your
[1:07:43] future yes sir amen young men you know

[1:07:53] about it we ain't all been saved all
[1:07:56] some of us haven't been and and it's
[1:07:59] it's nothing it's nothing that you know
[1:08:01] we trying to talk about and brag about
[1:08:03] and things of that nature but we we did
[1:08:05] things because we we we lack
[1:08:08] knowledge sir because you know giv
[1:08:12] understanding we we probably wouldn't do
[1:08:14] the things that we
[1:08:16] did right given given given
[1:08:19] understanding you know uh we we wouldn't
[1:08:22] have took folks into our bosoms
[1:08:27] and may uh May
[1:08:29] imprints y'all ought to preach with me
[1:08:34] somebody this this young men and young
[1:08:37] women it's it's people that you you
[1:08:39] wouldn't gravitate
[1:08:41] towards be because of of the lasting
[1:08:45] effect that's right right amen and and a
[1:08:49] lot of times we do this and the the
[1:08:52] outcome of those things aren't good and
[1:08:55] then those things affect your
[1:09:00] future right in in Insight you'll
[1:09:04] benefit from
[1:09:05] it come
[1:09:07] on Amen down the line if if if you're if
[1:09:11] you've been Quicken you you you'll gain
[1:09:15] a knowledge that will be
[1:09:17] needed sir to navigate amen your future
[1:09:21] yes sir Oh Glory to God this kind of a
[1:09:25] com
[1:09:26] service you know cuz sometimes sometimes
[1:09:29] you know um our Young
[1:09:31] Generation uh
[1:09:33] needs the benefit of our matured
[1:09:37] experience and and where where where
[1:09:40] would these young men get this knowledge
[1:09:43] and
[1:09:44] insight that's that's based upon
[1:09:47] biblical principle not conal
[1:09:50] knowledge unless they getting it from
[1:09:53] us they get getting it they getting it
[1:09:56] from Godly fathers and Godly mothers and
[1:09:59] and godly
[1:10:00] Ministries right that's giving us that's
[1:10:03] giving us
[1:10:05] Insight right amen uh to things that'll
[1:10:09] help us Amen in our future to help us
[1:10:13] when we're in courtship right all right
[1:10:16] yes sir huh that that'll help us once we
[1:10:20] actually jump the
[1:10:22] broom that that you don't you don't go
[1:10:25] into these things like we went into
[1:10:27] these things amen uh uh with a lack of
[1:10:33] knowledge right and and and you know one
[1:10:36] of the things that I look back on and
[1:10:39] and it's like you know it's hard for me
[1:10:42] to repent of things that I just didn't
[1:10:45] understand knowledge come on church
[1:10:48] people want to hold you to to to certain
[1:10:51] things but it's like how could you hold
[1:10:53] a person to something
[1:10:55] that they they didn't know was
[1:10:58] important right and and this is this is
[1:11:01] why sometimes I think we we really we
[1:11:04] really need to deal with a uh more of a
[1:11:07] reality sometimes with with our
[1:11:10] generation really get down and and
[1:11:12] express things in a Godly manner uh
[1:11:16] that'll help them is that right so that
[1:11:19] they they don't go into things and
[1:11:21] approach things naive right amen right
[1:11:26] because because the wedding is not the
[1:11:30] marriage the courtship when everybody's
[1:11:33] got their best behavior going forward
[1:11:36] and the Honey around the moon and
[1:11:38] everything and you can't you can't get
[1:11:41] enough of that person and a few years
[1:11:44] down the line you can't hardly stand the
[1:11:46] sight of
[1:11:52] them huh oh
[1:11:55] glory and then you know you look back
[1:11:58] and you you wonder you wonder what
[1:12:01] happened what happened was you didn't
[1:12:03] have
[1:12:05] Insight you you you you wasn't
[1:12:08] groomed you wasn't groomed for for for
[1:12:12] the position because uh every young man
[1:12:16] I believe that notless you're a
[1:12:19] unic I believe that every every young
[1:12:22] man desires a wife right on is that
[1:12:26] right brother Mark is that right you
[1:12:28] ain't got that yet I put you under
[1:12:30] pressure then but it's okay you you'll
[1:12:33] get there you'll get there right amen
[1:12:38] amen but but you you want
[1:12:42] something that that that you've gleaned
[1:12:45] through life so that when you get there
[1:12:48] you can apply these
[1:12:50] principles amen that's right amen amen
[1:12:54] amen because there's principles that
[1:12:56] that that that goes along with this
[1:12:59] position in place is that right and you
[1:13:03] you got to be fit come on right you you
[1:13:07] as a as a young man you got to be fit to
[1:13:11] rule right we not talking about with a
[1:13:15] Iron Fist and a d mat that's not what we
[1:13:17] talking about right amen as as a as a as
[1:13:21] a mother you have got to be fit to rule
[1:13:28] to rule your your your your little you
[1:13:31] know Ministry yes sir glory to God but
[1:13:36] but a lot a lot of a lot of us we we've
[1:13:39] approached these things right naively
[1:13:43] and now we we feel the pressure but the
[1:13:45] pressure is good yes sir because what
[1:13:48] the pressure does what what the javelin
[1:13:51] throwing and all of these different
[1:13:53] things do it it it it helps you to grow
[1:13:58] and
[1:13:59] mature is that right it and and I I
[1:14:03] believe that you know what cuz if you if
[1:14:06] you go back in scripture you you look at
[1:14:09] uh uh
[1:14:10] Joseph right amen he had a
[1:14:14] dream right that he would be in a
[1:14:16] position of authority right right but
[1:14:19] look at look at the
[1:14:22] process look look at this process look
[1:14:25] look what he had to go through on his
[1:14:30] way to this
[1:14:32] position right despising your brother
[1:14:35] because your daddy like you and gave you
[1:14:38] a coat of many colors who do he think he
[1:14:42] is y'all ought to talk to
[1:14:45] me how many times have we experienced
[1:14:48] that amen right sir on the job in church
[1:14:55] yes sir Oh Glory who do they think they
[1:15:01] are Oh Glory to God especially
[1:15:05] especially you know a lot of times the
[1:15:07] pastor's family wo they
[1:15:11] scrutinized huh Welly y'all got cried I
[1:15:14] felt something
[1:15:17] did
[1:15:20] man just you know and everybody looking
[1:15:23] at your D side ways well they the
[1:15:26] pastor's family did not ask for that it
[1:15:28] was it was it was God's
[1:15:32] choice you know and and and you know
[1:15:35] here's here's the ironic thing that God
[1:15:38] chooses a man and and he gives the
[1:15:42] pastor's family a lot sir a lot of a lot
[1:15:46] of
[1:15:46] talent a lot of
[1:15:49] giftings is that right but on the same
[1:15:52] token right they're going to come under
[1:15:54] some scrutinies they're going to they're
[1:15:56] going to come under some stuff also
[1:15:59] where where they they going to have to
[1:16:02] benefit grow
[1:16:05] mature
[1:16:06] right cuz there's a lot of
[1:16:09] responsibility on pastor's children that
[1:16:12] there there that's weight sir that's
[1:16:16] weight on the deacon's children the song
[1:16:20] leaders
[1:16:21] cheering I don't know y'all know how
[1:16:25] forget side eyes and get
[1:16:28] the falling up they face and H you know
[1:16:34] but you you just you just don't know the
[1:16:37] the the responsibility and the pressure
[1:16:40] that goes along with it and and these
[1:16:42] are principles that even they you know
[1:16:44] like brother Solomon got his daughters
[1:16:47] you know and son and you know doing all
[1:16:50] and it's a real big responsibility that
[1:16:53] he has his wife has is can I use y'all
[1:16:56] as for a second it ain't going to be
[1:16:58] bad I'm I'm going to make it I'm going
[1:17:00] to make it real
[1:17:02] nice but but it is it's it's a lot of
[1:17:05] responsibility and it and it takes it
[1:17:08] takes for them having understanding of
[1:17:11] the
[1:17:12] responsibility and and the position and
[1:17:14] and what the position
[1:17:17] entails right now this this now y'all
[1:17:19] church I I'm not really an evangelist so
[1:17:22] I don't approach it like an evangelist
[1:17:24] so y'all for give me this

[1:37:20] y'all go to them fancy restaurants and
[1:37:23] all that you ain't had to worry about
[1:37:24] babysitters and this and you know
[1:37:27] Panthers and you know living you know
[1:37:30] where you could hard and make it and you
[1:37:33] know life living was a lot better for
[1:37:38] chilling but but children children was a
[1:37:42] part of the promise be fruitful and
[1:37:45] multiplied amen amen right come on
[1:37:48] that's that's a promise and blessings
[1:37:51] come along with uh uh uh Quivers yes sir
[1:37:56] you know yes

[1:38:01] quiver six of them thank you Jesus they
[1:38:08] grown but it it let me tell you
[1:38:11] something and it was a responsibility
[1:38:13] don't play with it right when when when
[1:38:16] you got six children and your wife ain't
[1:38:21] walking Come on talk to me
[1:38:24] some of y'all sisters don't even know
[1:38:25] what that's all about right you had to
[1:38:28] work every
[1:38:31] day come
[1:38:33] on come on ain't nothing play with sir
[1:38:38] that might have been sub you could to
[1:38:40] did in the 50s especially now when we
[1:38:43] want all the amenities the big house the
[1:38:48] Fine Cars Birkin bags and nice clothes
[1:38:52] and Louie and and and the best
[1:38:56] cologne everybody got to work even the
[1:39:01] baby baby you got to get up out of here
[1:39:04] go get a job put you in a commercial or
[1:39:09] something
[1:39:11] huh cuz cuz it's it's difficult it's
[1:39:16] difficult but what what all of this has
[1:39:19] done it has broken the order and program
[1:39:22] of God this is why we got so much
[1:39:24] problem yes sir
[1:39:27] true but preach now come on we could get
[1:39:31] down into some stuff yes sir it looks
[1:39:34] good on the surface right but but when
[1:39:38] we when we really look at these things
[1:39:40] based upon the word of God you realize
[1:39:42] the devil has been having his
[1:39:46] way right glory to God having his way
[1:39:49] because amen if my wife is out working
[1:39:52] you know who that with the children
[1:39:54] right then the Propet say we got
[1:39:57] babysitters and all this kind of stuff
[1:40:00] right glory to God and and and listen
[1:40:03] I'm not telling sisters not to go to
[1:40:05] work go to work in the morning
[1:40:08] now but but I'm just saying how you know
[1:40:13] Satan slipped in and put the women in
[1:40:16] the
[1:40:18] workforce right and and now if if you
[1:40:21] look at if you look at social media
[1:40:24] which I do because I'm just trying to be
[1:40:27] informative and and the things that they
[1:40:30] talk about you know you realize this
[1:40:33] stuff is not being based upon the word
[1:40:35] of God but this is what's being F to our
[1:40:38] young sisters and this The Narrative to
[1:40:41] our young
[1:40:42] Brothers right but it's it's contrary to
[1:40:46] the word of God because when the order
[1:40:48] was set in Genesis the sweat was
[1:40:51] supposed to be upon Adam's br
[1:40:54] yes sir Adan was supposed to go to
[1:40:58] work right glory to God and be the
[1:41:02] provider come onen and Eve was supposed
[1:41:06] to bring forth
[1:41:08] children right amen she was supposed to
[1:41:12] be uh uh the first little influence that
[1:41:16] the CH the child had the first
[1:41:18] teacher right but how you going to teach
[1:41:21] something when you working every day you
[1:41:23] come home and screaming child I'm tired
[1:41:25] go go somewhere and sit
[1:41:30] down and nowaday with all of this stuff
[1:41:33] we got you hand them a
[1:41:36] phone or you hand them something Talent
[1:41:43] TI huh and and then look at the
[1:41:46] amounting
[1:41:48] pressure that that that that all of this
[1:41:51] stuff is building
[1:41:53] we wonder why you know families are
[1:41:57] exploding wives are walking away and
[1:42:00] husbands is quitting and walking away
[1:42:03] and children don't care they out killing
[1:42:05] and
[1:42:06] whatnot right cuz the the order of
[1:42:09] things has been broken amen right and we
[1:42:13] grabbing and this and it look good and
[1:42:15] it look nice we got Fine Cars and
[1:42:17] clothes and this I ain't telling you
[1:42:19] don't rideing you I like the nice stuff
[1:42:22] too but but I realize all of these
[1:42:24] things come as at a
[1:42:28] cost look at look at the look at look at
[1:42:31] the
[1:42:32] cost They Don't Preach this
[1:42:36] everywhere cuz they people don't really
[1:42:38] understand that and then we say well you
[1:42:41] know women live and this and that come
[1:42:44] on that's
[1:42:45] carnal we talking about the order of God
[1:42:47] biblical principles right amen if we're
[1:42:51] talking about anything come on church we
[1:42:55] not you know like I say don't quit your
[1:42:57] jobs I'm not telling you that but I'm
[1:42:59] just telling you how the enemy has has
[1:43:02] infiltrated the homes and look at the
[1:43:05] amountain stress and amountain pressure
[1:43:08] and how he's invaded the USA right and
[1:43:11] and then now and now with all of this
[1:43:14] stuff look at the
[1:43:16] economy
[1:43:17] right look at look at the economy and
[1:43:20] then this Young Generation they ain't
[1:43:22] even be built because they don't have
[1:43:24] the concepts they don't even understand
[1:43:26] the principles of of what it takes to
[1:43:29] even navigate and
[1:43:31] survive because you because we make it

[1:49:50] folk T if I was you not don't do that
[1:49:54] every church is Sovereign don't do that
[1:49:56] I learned that early on when I started
[1:49:58] pting Bible truth Tabernacle I had some
[1:50:01] some friends that I thought were mature
[1:50:03] that I could lean on you know when I
[1:50:06] first started I realized man those guys
[1:50:10] was a detriment my Lord the church
[1:50:12] wouldn't have stood for 23 years if I
[1:50:15] would have listen to
[1:50:16] them right because they were trying to
[1:50:19] prolite the folk and everything else
[1:50:22] Lord
[1:50:23] misinformation and bad information and
[1:50:26] prolite spirits and all other kind of
[1:50:29] spirits was being released Lord right
[1:50:33] glory to God Amen and sometimes and
[1:50:37] sometimes you know even with with with

[1:51:06] plant plants you and the man he's given
[1:51:08] to govern your
[1:51:11] soul cuz these guys ain't concerned
[1:51:13] about governing you they they concerned

[2:00:53] we lack so much we lack so much
[2:00:56] information and I know that to be the
[2:00:58] truth because when we first got saved
