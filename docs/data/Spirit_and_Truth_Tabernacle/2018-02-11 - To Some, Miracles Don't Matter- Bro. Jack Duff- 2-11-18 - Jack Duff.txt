said lord I don't want to miss this and I was talking to one of my colleagues on the way home we had a business adventure that we needed to go to on Saturday and he says why are you pressing your body

get up and go to church after I finish working throughout this entire day and I am so glad that I pressed my way to come on out to the house of the Lord and I was as I was praying and as we were entering in it was just such a wonderful anointing and such a wonderful blessed service for refilling and feeling and deliverance and healing and as hard as I was praying and hard as I was fighting to pray the harder the devil was just fighting me and just pressing me and I just stopped and I said our Lord let me tell you I said I am NOT trying to be disobedient and I'm not trying to overrule your

church praise our Lord say man I am I'm grateful amen I'm just extremely grateful wonderful service on Friday night a man just a time of prayer and praise we lead more dance you need more than it's just very appreciative we just wanted to let the Lord just have his way and certainly God did that a man God did that and you know and we just we just appreciate just just how he how he does things the one of the brothers a couple of brothers was telling me they say they were coming out of I guess I didn't back out of the parking lot they like where's all that no one's coming from like what's going on what is all this noise and they thought of the church you know next door and they like wow what is that my god yeah they come around the concert man that's our church you know and they would they like they like man we need more d's services you know with us sometimes you just you just want to let go and let God a man and that's what we did on Friday and we just expecting God just to meet us continuing meet us in very special ways amen as we come under expectation musicians thank y'all so much I appreciate y'all thank y'all a man just just everything that's been done in the name of the Lord we've been having some really really wonderful services and stuff as of late just God just Minister into our hearts and like we in our own personal revival a man just I personally violently we thank for that today I have a sermon that's in my heart it might go against the grain a little bit but I hope that the Lord will just bring it out to us a man just something that he just kind of laid him a spirit I think I've hurt my daughter saying how she had multiple stalls that was in her heart to sing and it's the same way with a preacher sometimes you got two or three messages and you just don't know which one to go with and but you you know however the Lord wants to do things that's how you do things and and we just try to be obedient to that so I'm gonna read a scripture they're familiar passage of Scripture and I asked everyone to stand with me as we just read the Word of God and and then we will allow our pray and I'll let you be seated mark 16 verse 14 through 19 14 through 20 and man March 16 verse 14 through 20 and says afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sent at meat and abraded them with their unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and in his baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe and my name should have cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink in a deadly thing it should not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the Lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and set on the right hand of God and they went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following amen the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word let's just pray over this father we thank you for the ability to read Scripture but we know it takes the Holy Ghost to help us deceive what it is that we have read so God as we would just develop a little thought here today and we present it we pray that the Holy Ghost would go before us and just make make it so clear to the people and that you got would just get all the glory and all the honor and all the praise from Lord what happens in this portion of service thank you for your spirit that's been here through the the worship and just the songs of Zion and God just the people in an atmosphere of praise and an adoration and now God what the word is certainly the most important thing that we need in order to overcome the enemies so god help us to receive revelation even right now is our prayer we take every spirit that is against the Spirit of God underneath the control of the Holy Spirit it's in Jesus name that we pray amen claim that God bless you can be seated [Music] I'm going to use a title a man that might strike you a man a little different but I pray that it'll help us today the title is to some miracles don't matter and to some miracles don't matter they do not matter let's just kind of work our way through this to me this is a very controversial title to speak in the midst of believers because I've noted I'm standing in the midst of a group of people that do believe in miracles they do you can't tell them no different because they have experienced them their self it's impossible for you to tell them that God is not real when they have experienced the Living God they're not talking about a God of Bible days they're talking about a God that is the same yesterday today and forever so if he did it in Scripture that he ought to be able to do it again today a man if he's not dead and yell alive then we ought to see the same same responses the same actions and reactions coming forth my Lord and Savior and and I know I'm standing in the midst of a group of people that have experienced that we have seen the healing power of God right here in our midst my own dad was healed of cancer a man sister Samantha was healed of cancer sister Tonya was healed of cancer if I could also save my friend brother Don was healed of cancer right where I'm standing in the midst of a group of people that know he's the same so so to tell them that miracles don't matter I would be a liar but that's why I titled it to some I'm not talking to you to some miracles don't matter hallelujah glory to God we you know III know that for myself a man and hearing the message of the hour the Lord uses prophet to to you know just to share different testimonies in and there's been various testimonies that that I've heard that have been a blessing to me that that disturbed my faith you know if God could do this 50 60 70 years ago then I know that God was still doing it even right now and and one of those things weren't when I heard the testimony of the lady in Memphis Tennessee right and and this this woman was reading in the Bible and and she she saw herself in the scripture and you know she said she had this you noticed one boy he took sick because he wasn't living right hallelujah amen and let me tell you sometimes your sickness is God's amen God's Way of getting your attention right because this board went living right and and and and and and with them not living right it his mama begin to pray for them and and and as my mother's prayers it's like she's like Lord I'm I'm your Shunammite I see myself in the scripture I'm the shooter my sin said but but where is your Elijah that was a prayer where is your life if I'm your shooting if I'm if I can see myself here there's different players in this portion of Scripture I see me but where's him right so so where it where is your Elijah and and as she's praying here a plane is flying over the top of her City I mean maybe 20,000 feet up I don't know how it is but as the plane is approaching Memphis God's not got an answer to your question you want to know where my Elijah is I'm getting ready to drop is playing right into your city and God calls that plane to come down with mechanical issues just the answer one lady's prayer everybody else had to get off the plane everybody had to be inconvenience are y'all getting that everybody else had to be put up in a hotel for a night every everybody else had the delayed way Emily was going to because God was concerned about one person's prayer wait wait wait wait wait wait you're like she had no idea playing that come down and here she is sitting there praying and then the Lord showed them a little dream said now you you actually where my lives i'ma sent him by he's gonna have a little briefcase in his hand and they gotta come find it gonna be looking like this and looking like that this gonna be your Lodge and here brother branham get stuck on the plane got off the plane and then it goes to the hotel and then the next morning he wakes up and and he's going to put some mail in the mailbox and the Lord ain't told him nothing yet and all they said just now start walking you say walking walking where so just start walking he never been in the city before just keep walking and Lord keep walking Lord I'm gonna miss my plane I'm gonna do to keep walking keep walking keep and as we start walking say okay i'ma just forget about this i'ma just be led by the spirit i'ma let God have his way and they say just start singing I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them and as he's just walking and singing that song he got caught up in the spirit and and he just he just you know my just you can just you can imagine how him jet how you just walk in the singing and hear the lady standing like that there's ten like that since early in the morning after her dreams she got up and she stood like there's a gate just waiting oh my god when God show you that he get ready to do something you ought to be waiting hallelujah somebody so she was standing there she was just waiting so when he walked by me just singing in the spirit did she say good morning parson and it kind of stopped him in his tracks say good morning person how you know that I'm a preacher said well God showed me in a dream that jewel is going to be coming by this morning I pray - Scott where was his Lodge and he said that you were the one that we're going to be coming only thing you missing is your briefcase he see say yes I left it at the hotel and say God has showed him and showed her everything but had showed the prophet nothing went into that little room and pray for that boy and why he was in there yelling and screaming mama it's dark in here mom it's dark in here Mama's docketed sacrum and says mama auntie why don't you pray first and say she'd begin to pray in that little one-room Shack say he knew that that lady had got in contact with God before he say say oh just the atmosphere everything about it just beginning to tell you say it brought tears test I see here that lady friend can I just stop and say something you know brother Mike I appreciate your prayer this morning man I appreciate that Freddie's bunny it showed some growth a man I appreciate that prayer glory to God amen but but as you see said mom it's dark and mom is talking you say say okay auntie now operates a say Lord I don't know why I'm here my plane did this and I was stuck in the hotel and all this you told me they walked in and I don't know why but she said you showed her a dream and God I'm just going to pray in the name of Jesus for this book and before he could say Amen the boy starts telling is light in here it's light in here it's light here so see these testimonies that God was giving through His Prophet was something to anoint our faith we believe in miracles we believe in miracles let me go on a little further here you know I was I was thinking you know you all know the testimony of John Ryan a man and what a powerful testimony let was this man was blind and and and he's out there selling newspapers and you know and it come through the prayer line and got prayed for about a prophet and and and here he was prayed for and and brother Branham and told him his condition he said yeah I believe and he went off the platform and just you know think about first healing or whatever but he got a little confused before he got his healing and he come back to the prayer line I made it a couple days later said now I thought you told me brother Branham that I was healed and brother Branham said I thought you said that you believed so there was a little disconnect between are you saying and I'm healing and me saying I believe that's a disconnect here what do I need to fix this problem he saying say I'll tell you what to do God is already pronounce your healing sort of thing for you to do right now is beginning to thank God for your healing and slow viola in that process right now will you need to start thanking God for what he can't read it is you he's already pronounced that it will be done now you need to start taking him for it being tongue you ain't gonna wait there to happen before you give them praise you can start placing him right now so John Ryan said I got it I got it put down this rosary beefs and if salmon just stop hanging out I ain't got to sit there and pray with no rules or be some of this Lord lord I thank you for healing me so as they stood out there with its newspaper and they start giving that to different people say extra extra read all about it by stripes I'm healed he added something else to the newspaper adds extra extra read all about it by His stripes I'm healed and it just kept saying over and over for weeks he went on saying this and then it went through the barber one day has sat down in a chair

barber's chair took off running down the street yeah hold on its faith extra extra read all about it biased writes I am he [Applause] bah bah chasing them down the street turn you're gonna get hit by calm no no you don't get it I just got here while I was in the Poppa chair see to him miracle mattered but to some miracles don't matter Oh God let me read something here for you Laurie to God out of the message expectancy a man who say well isn't it strange look at Simeon the Holy Ghost promised him you're not going to see death till you see the Christ why they said David look for him and this one look for him and that one look for him no matter what they look for no matter what they look for him the Holy Ghost has told me so he was expecting to see him he didn't care what people said he was expecting when Jesus was born in Judea in Bethlehem there were a few stargazers seated across a scene cross observatory but stylistics none of the men at the observatory of the planetarium they didn't see it they know nothing about it but my Bible said they followed a star I believe it they see that it was for them divine healing today is not for the unbeliever is for those who believe the baptism of the Holy Spirit today is not for the unbelievers it's for those who believe Jesus died for believers not for unbelievers it's for those who believe the supernatural foes whose supernatural mindette you give the supernatural follow those at a supernatural mind ed come on church amen that the supernatural follows through supernatural magnet that's right when the husband and thurston when you got an expectancy when you read God's Word expect to see God before what he said he would do God will do it that's why that's why I precious sister Michelle could come here on Friday night being attacked all day but she expecting God to do something and when she got here did exactly what he said he would do and every time the devil come that reminder more God already did hallelujah somebody see I was thinking on this as I was in Israel back in November we were we were there in the in the garden of gethsemane and as I was just kind of you know standing there at in the garden of gethsemane just kind of brother brother George was giving a little devotion and and he was just kind of talking about some things there in the Garden of Gethsemane and I was just it just kind of hit my mama and I believe he might have said this statement to some miracles don't matter and I've said well you know that that's that's really something when you really think about that because in the Garden of Gethsemane there was a miracle that took place and it didn't matter right yeah it absolutely did not matter here this man you know they come up with this scheme that they gonna get Jesus they ready to kill him right they they gotta find them in and and for some reason I can't tell the reason because the Sunday School class might get it but for some reason they didn't know who Jesus was some reason they needed help trying to figure out who Jesus was so the acts are you know that they made a little deal with a man with Judas and Judas they the one that I kiss my god how high is it that they even amongst of this cycles they could not recognize who Jesus was because the disciples were doing some of the same things he was doing and if they were confused in that day Sydnee also be confused today come on somebody they should be confused right now as to who Jesus is because I see him in you am i see him in here Am I everywhere I turn I see Jesus here they are wandering so now how we gonna be able to tell which one is Jesus so Judas said I tell you what I'm gonna betray him with the kiss and the one that I walk up to and I give them a kiss that's how you're gonna know this is the woman and here you know they walk up and Judas gives this great kiss of betrayal and in the disciples say Lord what you want us to do you want us to fight with a smart and Peter before he can even get an answer from Jesus took the slow light and just went whacking now the Bible say cut the man's ear off now I don't know about you but if I had a sword this close to my hand and then it got my ear miracles would matter it would matter to me but rather than this man I made it here here to hear his ears off on the ground maybe gravitylight long and then Jesus just stopped the battle everybody put your swords down reach down and pick up the man here and just put it back on life but this man when his ear just being healed this man's okay now we're going to take you to Pilate [Music] I'll get this man to that me that day I don't know about y'all but I'm talking about me this man chest heal my ear I was this close to death whoever side of my mom on pilots I'm here I am you know coming to take this man to his to his death but he just think saved me from my death it's a shame but to some miracles don't matter stay with me here today glory to God it should have mattered to to now cos that's his name his name was Malchus it should have mattered to him but it didn't matter to him see I want you to understand the supernatural does not impact everybody the same way see the supernatural only follows those has a supernatural in mind it if you're not expecting supernatural you'll never see supernatural oh my god I believe the Songwriters say that we are we are supernatural beings having a natural experience they don't even know what they're talking about but we are supernatural beings having a natural spirit we come from God we go back to God hallelujah our God is supernatural so so soon I mean we've never even heard of anything supernatural once we see it something strikes on the inside and we identify with that look at this oh my let me let me let me let me let me yeah let me let me skip down to something here oh my see the supernatural doesn't impact everybody the same way I want to come back to that in a second let me read it something out of Jesus at the door the sermon Jesus at the door look at this Oh God stay with me here today what I mean it should have mattered to this man going through such a close experience now I'm not wondering how many people have been this close to death this close and you ain't start serving God yet I mean you know and even thought about going to a church and to be the first one said what God spared me from this what why did he spare you what was the prayer I didn't he take you at that time look at it Jesus that the door says if that ain't the condition of the church today God showing Billy Graham or robbers great signs and wonders and the church says that's not my denomination just there become spiritually insane just stare oh this is my church that's not the science that follows a believer they listen to their church and forget the Spirit of God that makes you act christ-like that makes you love him and believe him but what's happened their eyes are blinded they can't you say I have 20/20 but you see the blindness he's talking about is spiritual blindness and fella said to me some time ago of a certain church that don't believe that they say they speak where the Bible speaks and silent where it's silent and I said well sir what about a certain he said I don't care what you say mr. Branum I don't believe it I said I it wasn't made for unbelievers it wasn't sent to unbelievers it was sent to those who believe you're an unbeliever and what a pitiful you shape you are that the devil has blinded you he said to me smack me blind then I said you're already blind sir he said my eyesight perfect I said but your spiritual sight he said oh oh blindness means your regular eyes so he took them to the Bible it says I said what about Elijah down at Dothan that day when they woke up that morning in the series have surrounded the army have surrounded the city to come in and get Elijah because he was telling their secrets and so forth and they hated him and gauzy woke up and said oh my father said looking here the series has a hole a city surrounded and we're in the middle of them and they lie shouldn't that old prophet raised up and rubbed his eyes he says but there's more with us than there is with them I love that so you got to be able to see that you got to see that greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world greater is show God in the midst of that trouble then the devil that you see running roughshod hallelujah he said you wrote a lot but there's more with us than with him Ghazi look around said I don't see nothing nobody but you and I he said God open this boy's eyes not evidently the boy was seeing but he was missing something it was a different eyes like that the boy needed if he ever played up open his eyes he just saw the Syrian army he just saw the Prophet but what was he missing and I'm praying the Kaaba open our spiritual eyes that we will see the things that we're missing he says he said and he says our God open this boy's eyes and when his eyes come open around that old prophet stirred angels of fire and chariots of fire by the millions Sica hozy was blind and then he said come go with me now these a day actually the Syrian army can see - and here they come into live today looking for Elijah they get two lives you and then they X they actually said do you know where he lives they're looking for Elijah they get to your lives and they asked do you know where Elijah is they were blind look at this and then he said come go with me he walked out to the chief captain and raised up his hands he went to the Gator said Lord smite them blind and he walked out to the chief captain sent are you looking for Elijah say yes sir we are said come follow me I'll take you to him here Elijah is leading them the one that they looking for is leading them but they blind and can't see them laugh they able to follow they can see some things but not all things and what we're trying to do is get the church to be able to see all things you make decisions on your partial sight but when God can open up your full sight you'll make different decisions so that take you to them it says it says I'll take I'll take I'll take you to blind and looking right at them blind at seeing Elijah that's what it is tonight to church what that's what it is tonight to church God be merciful they're blind know that Jesus Christ is here on earth today the same that he was yesterday and will be forever they're spiritually blind they don't know that the devil has blinded them now that's what you know revelation 3 tells us that the church would be in that condition that they blind and not even realize that they were blind they can see certain things but they're not seeing the whole thing can go further in Christianity there's people that can see certain things in Scripture but not able to see the entire thing oh my so that's a heavy statement right because you know like you know just baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ versus baptism in the name of Father Son and the titles Father Son the Holy Ghost right I mean they can see Jesus said that but what what was the name of the Father what was the name of the son what was the name of the Holy Ghost it was Lord Jesus Christ so that Peter didn't have it wrong Peter had it right he had a revelation of what Jesus saying and let me tell you something you'll never understand God's Bible without revelation you're gonna be reading the Bible from cover to cover and never understand what you read unless God give you a revelation alright so what I'm what I'm getting you to see here a man here this man approaching the Prophet said smite me blind smite me blind and you know to him miracles didn't matter you like no matter what you do no matter how many people get healed I'm not gonna change the way I think I'm not going to change the way that I am it's a person that doesn't matter but when you run into a person like that that's when you realize these times will follow them that believe not them that disbelief hey man I love the way the Prophet handle himself when he ran into situations like this he just kind of it's not for you it's only for believers glory to God let me go a little further here see if the supernatural doesn't impact everybody the same way I think about Elijah when he stood out there with the prophets of Bill and when he said he said now you know what we tired of y'all halting between two opinions we go we gotta figure out who gonna be gods of Israel right here I'm serving the God of Israel and y'all serving baled and all this they say Ahab you don't introduce all this stuff because you know I married the wrong woman all right it happen era Jezebel you say you should've never did that you know marry her now not her the thing that she worship or the gods that she worship not even they all inside Israel and you know our God is a jealous God you don't want he don't want no other God before I'm saying now we got all the sin now we're gonna have a showdown today the god that asks about fire let him be God they all agree to say yeah okay got the next best fat little be God and when it went out there and a man and they begin to set up the altars Elijah had invited 850 you go back and read 850 were invited at 400 prophets of the go groves 450 amen a bale but when that when they came to the showdown only the 450 prophets showed up the other four kept eating at the table of Jezebel another 400 they kept eating at the table of Jezebel but he invited 850 one man willing to stand against 850 he knew his God he knew his God was a God that worked miracles and here he was standing there and the 450 shows they okay we believe so you know we'll start we'll put up our offering and we put up our all truth and you put up your altar we agree in the god that ends on fire that's gonna be the God of Israel they got out there in the morning time and they set up their their altar and nothing happened with their prayer oh my had a prayer meeting and nothing happening amen when we afraid we want to see God do something right they had a prayer meeting and nothing happened and because nothing happened it got a little excited they begin to take lancets and cut themselves in and bleeding all over the Alton just trying to get their God to do something Elisha looked at him say y'all a lot of scream a little hard a nice eight it's 450 are already crying out cry and do more to try to get his attention he's just picking at well the evening time was coming to God God's in a many lies it down then he had his altar built in the evening time and that the evening sacrifice this is when he takes me Elijah and they say now now I want you to later all to a certain way I want you to dig a trench around the altar I want you to pull water in there three times I want you to do it exactly the way I told you to do and one man standing that gives 450 did exactly what God told him to do in a God that answer by fire came down and consumed the sacrifice that should have settle things in Israel when God did that you know the children is ready to begin you go back and look at it and first Kings 18 maybe in the turn back to God some of them was turning back but there was one that I know of in particular it didn't matter to her so how the miracle didn't matter Jezebel her husband home so she said you know of the day when 450 promised a bear came and I hate the taking and I'm with us no more now that after God answered by fire then Elijah took him all down he slayed them all I saw the spot waste later he took him down to the river he killed him 450 of them bent and and he told her the whole testimony how God answered by fire but high response tomorrow I'm gonna have his head just like he had their hand it showed that to her a miracle did not matter I don't care what God do I'm not going for that you know and you gonna run into people like this that something sometimes you know we always feel like man I think it's that see the power God just some people it does not matter well I'm glad that's not me cuz it matters to me and here's what I believe about miracles I believe miracles are used to attract the attention of the believer Moses was attracted by the miracle of the burning bush the disciples were attracted to the feeding of five thousand and four thousand and seeing a man say peace peace feel to a wind and waves I mean they were attracted to these miracles Church the very things that we've seen God doing his property different testimonies that we've heard we've been attracted to this message a man it's the supernatural that we heard that actually attracted our attention but now once God gets your attention there's a voice behind the sign and he wants to speak to you can I tell you something the reason that that miracles matter to us and I don't have time to read it but you'll find it in the book of Matthew chapter 15 and what happened in Matthew chapter 15 verse 23 to 28 we won't read all of this but but what happened was that there was a woman that approached the Lord Jesus and as she was coming to Jesus she had a daughter that was sick and should be in the prayer I'm just beginning approach dorset lord please you know I'm coming on behalf of my daughter with you would you do something for my daughter would you well you know it she says she believed in the supernatural and not not now not now now now as she approached you know she like Laura I really I I need you to do something and that's as s as she's approaching Jesus Jesus begin to tell us say now not now your people are dogs and we were not sent to the dogs I was sent to dogs I'm sent to the lost sheep of Israel but not to not to dogs and when she heard that rather than heard getting offended she should she see she had a different attitude and she said she said you're right Lord that you might sit the dog but you say even the dogs she say even the dog should get a crumb from the master's table right in which when she said that it just it just shook Jesus same woman great is your thing you can have what you're asking for not even Jesus could shake that lady's face [Music] see the devil can do a lot to try to shake our faith but when Jesus speaks and says that I'm not said to your people not even Jesus could shake her face jesus said great is your faith great is your faith this is he'd say this is what I'm talking about this what I'm looking for and they told her statement he said I'm not sent to your you know your people says I'm sent to the lost sheep of Israel and he also said they say he'll healing is that is the children's brand this don't belong to you this is for the to see so what I'm saying is that meant to some miracle something don't matter because healing is for the children and maybe maybe you might not be a child because if you're a child of God you got won't healing because healing is the children's bread then we get we rejoice when we see God do things hallelujah somebody wee wee wee wee wee wee that caused a shot to come on when we see God do things all right let me read something here out of paradox this is why you know I mean I mean just I said to some but not to me right it matters to me I thank God for what he does I thank God for him proving himself to be the same yesterday today and forever Oh glory to God let's read something here out of paradox since that now billions probably give out some prayer cards which I think yeah I told him to and I believe he told me a while ago that he said somewhere along I'll call a few to the prayer line after a while to be prayed for and if your car does not call and it's called rather and you're not sure that God is the healer and he is going to heal you it won't do no good to come up here because you won't be healed you if there's one question you say well now if there's something in my life I really ought to straighten this up you go make that right first and then come back to the prayer line see because healing is the children's branch we realize that it is in the atonement and the atonement first is applied to our souls and healing has always will run every message and it's also been a means to gather people together let me just stop right there just for a second but see healing four runs every message and it's also a means to gather people together decide God gets you attention it's through healing let you know that he's the same yesterday that there forever it's through healing I'm you can put that down for a second but but what happened amen there was a time and brother branham's ministry where he was the angel lot was kind of telling him about different different phases of his ministry and you know and and and he said there was a time where he went out and he was he saw some some man fishings a vision that he was looking at saying he started been fishing and they were fished and they say he saw some some there was they catch a little fish here a little fish there and they catching this they catching it he says but he saw some rainbow trout and they say now now the rainbow trout he said I think I can catch them now I'm not just trying to catch a little fish here and a little fish there I'm going after the big stuff so so as he was looking there you know and the angel beginning to tell him say now you know as he was explaining to them the different pools and it's michellene out now don't try to explain to these brothers what you're doing don't try to do that because you're just gonna make a big mess out of it right so he said he'd say wet fish and he said now now he told him out you know jerk it this way and jerk it that way and do a little bit of this and do a little bit of that say but try to explain I listen and brother branham got out there and start fishing in the vision and the brother said oh yeah you can do it we know you can catch one and he got all puffed up in the vision Oh glory we got to watch that a man because pride come before a great fall don't allow the devil to get you pumped up stay humble lorry to God and the more you stay humble the more God will lift you up but as soon as you think you don't do something on your own God got away bring you right back down hallelujah somebody right so here he's in the kitchen and then the brother said oh you can do this you just start fishing and just grinning it and let's say he didn't do nothing that the angel the Lord told to he caught a fish but it was so small in the vision say that's that fish swallow the whole look and said man this is uh that the angel walk around him with his own arms photos saying that you didn't do not one thing I told you to do if you want to catch the big fish you're gonna have to do it this way now what was he saying God knew the big fish was us the big fish was us and let me tell you it one just I mean the message God used that the the miracles and the signs that want us to get our attention but the message was when the word was being revealed right when the word began to open up in that beginner you know make sense us that's when God got our attention we were a rainbow trout we were the big fish that God was looking for and if you're gonna get them you're gonna have to do it a certain way hallelujah see healing is the children's Brent see the summit don't matter but to me it matters it matters he said healing it I'm going back to the quote because healing is a children's bring we realize that it's in the atonement and the atonement first is applied to our souls and healing as always for run every message and it's always also been a means to gather people together and many people will sponsor a healing meeting many will come to a healing meeting or to a song festival now you know that number the truth you tell somebody you having a prayer line service folk come from every but we're looking for it to stick but we have to use that debate people will do will use that debate people because after God give you your healing he touched it go and sin no more so if you don't even have to be a Christian to get a healing I just saw that it happened I ain't gonna tell you all everything but it just happened you don't even have to be a Christian to get it healing but if you want to keep your healing you got to become a Christian all right let me go on says many people sponsor healing me the minute will come to healing me nor the song fester but when it comes to a poor lost soul to get saved there's not many people interested in that but that's the that's the main thing divine healing and singing festivals and so forth as brother Bosworth Easter say it's bait on the hook and you show the fish the bait not the hook and that's just a thing to get people to listen a while so you can really present to them your message see the healing and all that is just to get the people in so you can present to them your message God has did that in every age through every age there's always been a healing campaign and if it's a genuine healing campaign behind that campaign always is a message there never is a sign given just for sign it's for running a message and I believe the same thing is 17 years ago 18 years now that the Lord sent me out to start praying for the sick I made a great revival amongst the people many great servants of God has went forth in healing campaigns and but the healing campaign in itself if you still stay in the same old trend of what you always was there is something wrong that healing campaign wasn't sent from that healing campaign wasn't it from God it's got to attract attention first see get the attention and then there's a message Jesus when he came forth healing the sick and so forth he was a great prophet to all of them but when he began to tell them the truth of the gospel who he was and what he come for he was not popular after that see when he starts saying eat my flesh and drink my blood no part with me that's that's shook them right before then there was outcast not Devils and it was coming back rejoicing and Jesus even at the tone say stop reducing that the Devils are subject to you he said but rejoice because your name is written in heaven glory to God look look at this he says he was not popped after that and that's the way it has been through every age and it will continue that way see for some miracles don't matter but for me it does matter seeing what the Prophet was told by the angel when he was you know it kind of taken him through that tenth vision and some of the things that happened before the tip vision as he was just trying to you know explain to people say I told you don't don't explain this he said you cannot teach Pentecostal babies supernatural things you can't teach them that understand what happens that church will run into people where you know you won't be able to teach them certain things they can they can go so far they can see so much but then they can't see the rest of it God trying to get people that can see the whole thing and walking all of it not just the supernatural miracles but the supernatural word Oh glory to God alright let me uh let me just kind of share a couple miracles here with you that just blessed me and then I want to end it up a man with one last quote to some miracles don't matter but to me it does cuz I'm a believer I'm a believer let's look at a couple of miracles here are the expectations a man look at this now just so that you know when it comes to miracles some of them happen immediately and some of them happened over a span of time they don't matter how long it take it's still a miracle and a miracle is something that's out of the ordinary oh my god it's not something that don't happen all the time praise the Lord but you know when God does it we ought to be quick to give him praise Amen quick quick to honor him and thank him a man for what he has done this is out of the message expectations and these are some miracles that that occurred look at this says the person's faith is a pulling then when it lifts up it's over and and that's how sometimes I can tell out into the audience of how the people are healed it's because I feel it tugging and pulling and just it's like someone pulling mine and let it lifts up sometimes I just want to turn around because I got my mind on something else I'm watching every move and I just let it go because I know the person will notice in a few days that something's happened to them see a man was just testifying of something I met him in the hotel lobby he said brother branham I was just sitting in the meeting said something just come all over me he said I went home and I said Lord Jesus what's the matter what's happened to me and he'd been wearing a trust for 30 years and he said that he laid down there a little bit and went to sleep again and said he dreamed that he was at the meeting again and he said he's seen the Lord walked through and porns towards his trust he woke up and took his trust off there it was all gone praise God see God had showed him in the he was at the meeting something came over him got reminded him through a dream when it happened to him in that meeting and the trust was everything was gone he was healed of that condition look a lady said she had but she was been she was she was she was at her home she returned back from a meeting she had a stomach trouble that bother her for a long time she couldn't get in the bread line she said truth surely he'd know about the rest of it would be true so so said she just believed God and she was it was about it was about a day after she had been at the meeting she was washing the dishes and said all of a sudden something happened and a real cool feeling went through her she began to cry she's getting crying and she said didn't know what had happened and she run over and taken some sweet milk and usually the sweet milk the stomach so hot with fevers she'd vomited right up she drank a glass of sweet milk and really felt fine said she run over to tell her neighbor and her neighbor was just on all fours thinking God that she'd just been healed to what it was the God had seen her faith and was passing through the neighborhood oh he wants to Jesus is passing this way these people had come and been pray for at the prayer line two weeks later the angel or went to confirm the word to them see these people that's holding onto the Word of God to them healing matters and no matter what anybody says to them the doctor could sing it to you but God made me a promise and by His stripes I'm healed I don't care how long I have to wait it's still a miracle what it was the angel of God has seen a faith and was passing through the neighborhood confirming his word with signs and wonders there there was and those two women were just so happy rejoicing the other one had a female disorder said it struck her at the same time what or what what what I can imagine that neighborhood was not the same after them two ladies got together start testifying they was in the same prayer life pray for at the same time and they went home neither one of them healed in the prayer line but two weeks later they're there at their house and the lady one later can't eat and she just got to spot with manna I just feel like going to eat I want to eat and usually she eat everything come up but she's not gonna eat I won't eat she started eating nothing coming up she's a minute I think I'm healed and she going to testify about it and by the time to get to her neighbor to testify I want to take what she says she was going down to encourage you I want to let you know what God did for me but before she could encourage her she was being encouraged because the growth that her neighbor had and she know her neighbor had to say the growth fell off and couldn't find it don't know where it went I wonder if we've ever seen that before no I'm not gonna be like the fella that had his ear chopped off and put back on and they're gonna carry Jesus to Pilate I'm not gonna be like that to some see miracles don't matter to some but maybe he said I just I'm sorry I got a job to do I would have quit my resignation I'm turning it in right now and if y'all gonna take my life I have a feeling this man will be able to raise me back up I'm working for him you know all that God has done for us he deserves our lives he deserves it I mean totally sold out surrender to living for him this quote is my last quote I want to bring to your attention today out of the message testimony God's prophet visit right here in West Palm Beach Florida in 1953 and he spoke this a man here in our city says Jesus has risen from the dead and if he's here tonight he can do just the same he works through people now he can't unless you believe he can't work through something people unless you believe that minister said to me brother Branham I don't care what would take place I wouldn't believe it I said it's not for unbelievers it's for believers they didn't believe Jesus and they surely won't believe his servant see I said it's just it's just for those these signs shall follow them that believe not unbelievers believers so Church to me miracles do matter and this is a church we believe in praying for the sick we believe that when we lay hands on the sick that the Bible say they will recover we believe that right we have seen 2-minute testimonies in our own miss we gotta wing tell you what God did back in Bible days we ain't gotta tell you what he did and brother branham's damn we can tell you what he's doing right now we believe and the reason that we believe and the reason that we get more of this I mean like I told you my father and God's called him home but my father was healed of cancer before he left here right I mean I mean and we got we got doctors reports showing that he was healed of cancer but even though God called my daddy home he didn't stop healing after heal my daddy he come and got my daddy's daughter-in-law in heel about two of kamsa right and before he did that he's popped in the sister Sam's house healed her of cancer and say yeah he passed through the neighborhood yes he will and the one thing that he told God's promised say is you can kiss up people to pee leave not even cancer well stand in the way of the frame see healing is children's friend you supposed to eat from this you supposed to enjoy this God got a few just like he brought your salvation he brought you healing when he went to the cross healing was also involved in your salvation I don't know why you know churches don't preach it that way no more but God God is that he's the same church he's the same man that's why I said there's a controversial title but I said to some because I'm not talking about me and I'm not talking about you but to you this is children's branch and whatever you need God's got it whatever you need God's got it and as believers we should not be confessing how sick we are that should not be a believers confession you ought to be confessing how healed you are don't let the devil hear you talking like that well yeah I got this and I got in and running my family that's how you talk to the devil right if I'm right it's gonna bypass me oh okay some of y'all don't believe that I read it for you let me I don't believe it's gonna bypass me like this doesn't just say keep on runnin it running the family let it keep running right on past me and I'm not I'm not receiving it glory to God hallelujah musicians y'all prepare to come we're gonna close here but maybe I'll just read something out of Scripture for you yeah yeah turn with me to Psalms 19:1 Ori somebody won he that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty I would save the Lord he is my refuge and my fortress my god and him will I trust surely sound like this surely there's not a possibility it's not a maybe surely is certain surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the Fowler and from the noisome pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler the way you're gonna defend the devil's by quoting the Word of God that's gonna be your shield and buckler right thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flieth by day nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday the Bible says a thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand at that right hand this is the reason we can tell the devil to keep on running because it's shell but it shall not come nigh thee only with our eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked because thou has made the Lord which is my refuge even the most high the habitation there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling loose me flu symptoms I know I just read in the paper by some other time with the flu that ain't gonna be my testimony I believe in miracles hallelujah there shall no evil befall thee neither shall a plague come nigh thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways they shall bear thee up in their hands lest thou dash thy foot against the stone thou shall tread upon the lion and the ad of the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet because he have set his love upon me therefore will I deliver him I will set him on high because he have known my name he shall call upon me and I will answer him I will be with him in trouble I will deliver him and honor him and I love this if the devil trying to take you before you turn 70 because God promised you threescore and ten years but the devil striking your body before you turn 70 you got to take the devil back to the word he says with long life will i satisfy him and show him my salvation that's one thing I'm always i'ma just always appreciate you know my dad even when the Lord called him home he has showed him in a dream he says it showed him in a dream he looked at his whole life and when he got to 70 he said went dark he saw nothing at 70 it just it just went dark and he couldn't understand he went back as a little boy and through his childhood through his teenage years through his young adult years just just so many things got showed him at 70 it just it just went dark and when I went dark he's like oh well I'm not sure that is he just kind of left it left it to be and when he when he took sick mom had food - so you remember that dream you shared with me years ago you say yeah I do remember that I'm just just just wondering what the Lord is saying there and God allowed daddy to see 70 and we had ourselves a nice little celebration with his yellow and black but at 71 got called daddy home and exactly the way he showed him in the dream that was it but you know before he left miracles matters and he stood and gave his old testimony at his 70th birthday party but how God healed him a cancer oh my church that gave the devil a little black eye glory to God ain't going nowhere - God finish with me right and before I go I want the people to know what God did for me church I was I was just I was just I love sharing his testimony I'm always grateful for that God is still good and in the midst of whatever we're going through a man he's still got to some miracles don't matter but that's not me because he'll the healing is children's brand and I'm gonna eat as long as God say I can eat I'm gonna joint praise the Lord let's give the Lord a hand the priests mine let's have a word of Prayer dear God we just thank you for your word Lord that speaks to us even now we sit in in service like this and we got sometimes you allow certain things to be said because you had already see what's coming down the road help us
