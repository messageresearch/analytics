I've never seen it happen but I am gonna put a may be out there because you know how we don't promise people if I come to your church you're gonna come to my church I don't seen us go there but I ain't seeing none of them come here hello somebody but you can put a little pressure on them next week you know don't tell them you have Church right let's see if I go to your church you gonna come to my church right put some pressure on a mat now I'm holding you to that all right but uh but yeah you know whatever it whatever the Lord would lead you but please please go and be in fellowship a man on next week and you know there was something else that I had on my head to mention oh my choir we got to rehearse after service those that are be going to Indiana after service we need to go ahead and get finalize the songs that we're gonna be singing so please stick around amen at the service praise the Lord let's so let's get our Bibles and we'll read a scripture a man Todd is good to see you a man on today god bless you a man praise the Lord a man I want to read from Romans chapter 8 and we will just go there and then I have in my notes also to read from mark 6 but I'll just see how that how that goes man I made about this that should be seated when I read that but here in Romans chapter 8 starting at verse 11 and and and if I could if I could just ask you to meditate concentrate on the word of the Lord that as it's being read to you and over you because Jesus is not just putting these things in Scripture just like a some other book right that we we could read but no this is uh you know he's trying to call us to a place right and and and and we have to just really stop and meditate just if I could just put it this way slow down slow down enjoy what God got for you right a man just just just relax a little bit unless let's just let's just enjoy Jesus a man but here in Romans 8 verse 11 says but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh let me put that let me say that again you are in debt and your debt is not to live after the flesh come on somebody oh my one day we're gonna pay our debt but if you live after the flesh ye shall die but if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the flesh and that means that means mortify means put to death mine I wish I could preach that this morning but but mortify put to death the deeds of the body ye shall live a man Church right it's enough in there if I we can just take that one scripture just work with that hallelujah glory to God a man I'm trying to move on over to something else here but but you know we got to come to this that the church has got to come to this where you are dead to the things of the world Mayweather and McGregor will not be in heaven fightin a man Church mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live for as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God but ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ do you know that when you pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is as if Jesus himself was praying right joint heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together and look at this for I reckon a man I suppose that the sufferings of this present time whatever you're going through right now amen the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us you got to go through some things you got to go through some suffering to get some glory do we understand that you you you have to go through suffering to get some glory and we want the glory but we don't want the suffering right but in order to get the glory you got to go through some suffering see our our topic today is pressure produces power pressure produces power a man for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us and this is verse 19 where I want to stop here for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God a man the creatures are waiting for the sons of God to come back to where they belong a man and the only way we're gonna get there is by mortifying the deeds of this body a man that's that's what it's going to take let's have a word of Prayer and we'll let you be seated father we are grateful for the ability to read Scripture but our prayers that the Holy Ghost would make it clear to us God what it is that you have for us today we thank you for the anointing that has already been experienced in the sanctuary Lord just hearing the various songs and the worship the specials and God just you're anointed all over the place now we enter into the word and we trust that the Holy Ghost would have its way in Jesus name we take every spirit that's against the Spirit of God underneath the control of the Holy Ghost even right now in Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you can be seated appreciate it I will I will try to be a little bit more I won't be so fast next time brother Nehemiah I'm sorry I appreciate that we want to take a man for our subject today pressure produces power and and we're still kind of in the channel of rapture and faith which which is what we preached on last week and you know just wanna you know just kind of build upon that if we can by the by the grace of God there was a statement made and I meant to just mention this and I'll go ahead and mention it now this is a prayer that was prayed by the prophet out of the message the Church of the Living God a man and he prayed this prayer and I want to just read this over sis it's just thank you our possible Lord I believe it's a shall we bow our heads SoDo Heavenly Father we thank thee tonight that we can sing that from the depths of our hearts Lord I believe a man and and and I think that's a song that we all sing but eventually that song has to become reality right not just I mean only believe Lord I received Lord I believe it has to become a reality to the bride because it says this it says from the from the depths of our heart Lord I believe and as the father with the with an epileptic son years ago said help thou my unbelief and I'm identified with that man because there are some things I know I believe but then I want God to help my unbelief right say we hear this question asked one day when he returns would he find faith right he never questioned whether he find righteousness or whether he find Christians but would he find faith a man when he returned knowing that that would be one thing people would let go on so the thing that people give up on is faith see we don't we don't reach this point we can reason this thing out real good right but but we don't understand that when we're reasoning we're actually Amen we're losing faith what one of the things that you shouldn't do it if you if you just can't see it say God help my unbelief right no I mean I mean I'm the closer up here right elevating us to live a bit but we live in way down here right so we ought to get to the boy look increase my faith they may help my unbelief because I'm missing something I'm the first one to say it I mean oftentimes I go through stuff to say what I'm missing something here I know what's supposed to happen but why does it not happen something is wrong with me and that rule of God not one thing wrong way if something is wrong with me and I'm gonna keep digging till I find out what is wrong with me cuz I'm gonna walk with God has ordained me the walk uncle God has ordained me to live I don't have all day man I'm not a defeated Christian I'm a Sun God and all creation is groaning related little manifestation of this son of God don't let go your face reasoning and all these other things we gotta cash down on reasoning cash to complete it down don't even consider it any more right if we gotta get it justice just truly only believe I just believe listen he goes on to save as you say uh he didn't he didn't either he never questioned whether he found righteousness and this is a prayer right you say maybe even never question where the final righteousness or whether he'd find Christians but when he find faith when he returned knowing that that would be the one thing people would let go on come on church if you got a sickness in your body and don't don't get me wrong I think there's two ways to hold on to this if you don't have enough faith just to catch it on your own then you ought to be asking for prayer the Bible of the Bible oh lord have mercy you know the bots in the Bible says any sick among you let him call for the elders of church of the church say they want to nort him with oil and and pray over him right and it said the prayer of faith right would heal the sick and the Lord will raise them up either we gonna believe God's Word are we not come on church he either is either even it's right or it's not right wewe got to at some point in time we got to take God at His Word glory to God Church hey man we gonna have to learn to take God at His Word let me let me just kind of keep moving here and I just believe every situation that's coming up in our lives is an opportunity for God to express these attributes they may he said he wants to express something he I mean it's time to just stop quoting we just quoted he the same yesterday today of em how you know how do you know he was saying yesterday the day of ever how can you tell me that we don't know we got to step into something here come on church because people let go their faith and that's why Jesus asks a question when the Son of man cometh will he find faith oh Lord I you know I got scriptures here that I think I just need to read because you know it you know we quote these things but it's time for the really said Alenia you know get D you know get what will he find faith glory to God look at it it says when he returns what he found things they never questioned whether he found righteousness of whether he'd find Christians but would he find faith when he returned knowing that that would be one thing would let go on oh god oh god oh god here's also the Holy Spirit speaking in the last days how that how these times would come man would have a form of godliness but with deny the power lack of faith and we thank the Lord tonight because that in ours we feel that we have just a little faith and help us Lord that that faith may be increased tonight and I'm gonna just put it in today let that face be increased today until it'll be so high so lost in complete surrendered in Christ until great and mighty works will be shown tonight or today right forgive us of our shortcomings now and help us may the Holy Spirit just now the great office of God here in the earth searching out for a bride for the Lord Jesus and may he tonight gives it every heart here in a special way before we ask you to the name of the beloved son of God Jesus Christ amen you can be seated alright now he puts that prayer out there and and I'm going to this next quote out of the mighty conquer y'all just bear with me here today church week we got to you know I believe God is doing something in this hour and I think like I'm reading the script we got to mortify the deeds of the flesh but the devil got away of just really messing us up he put everything in front of us before we get to church y'all think about what y'all sad there's a sadness look like everything the devil can throw at you he will throw at you before you get to church anything to get your mind off of what God getting ready to do and it's just this after this after this and you got to do this you got to do that it's just a devil amen glory to God I I believe when some of you know parents and everything were younger man there was I think that they quiet time y'all just y'all just young you know y'all just hearing that you know through voice of God but the parents they had them things early in their life they had quiet time right I mean they get their mind ready for church alright get they mind ready for church and and even even after after after service on a Sunday it one no I mean the fellowship was at home with quiet time they had to keep they mind ready for the next service come on church glory to God Oh hallelujah yeah I'm just you know y'all what y'all watch the devil that's all I can tell you a lot a lot of stuff that that we have that entertain us that's not happening in heaven it's not gonna happen right and and either we can live for here or we can live for there but you have to choose right but it's not gonna you got to find a balance in these things right don't get consumed by it don't allow it to consume you it's not happening in heaven glory to God alright come on I'm going on look at this this is Ivan mighty conquering I'm gonna I want to get to pressure produces power if I can amen so it says after an after Constantine come over and liberated them from under the Roman persecution and United the church and state together that there's where we got Catholic to begin with and when they died the church lost more grounds in ten years that it had gained all through the persecution if there's anything that makes Christians lazy it's when they're on a flower bed of ease see I mean you know and don't get me wrong we all want the blessing plan right we all we all want a little something but I have to catch me a prayer I had to catch my prayer you know I want God just to meet my needs for right now now when these these didn't met then what I'm gonna do I know money's gonna come and I must still stay in prayer so he can meet the needs at the next time but I want him I don't want him to give me this this grave above this then I stop playing and that's what happened if you got too much from God you'll stop playing play some of us get so blessed [Music] right maybe as soon as you get a new car oh he'll help me somebody soon as God bless you and when you used to catch a ride you used to be on time but now that you got your own car you missing everything so much get to bless can I just put it that way you a to place all right if you don't know how to handle your blessings when you learn how to handle your blessings didn't God can give you more but see our some of our blessings take us away from God and let me tell you another thing do not ever don't ever but when you're praying and asking God for something it's not let's make a deal God if you just give me this then Lord I'm gonna do this you know if you bless me with this this this this $2,000 God I'm gonna pay my ties now why don't you pay your ties on your twenty dollars can see you you know i'ma tell you right now you won't paint eyes on your mm you can't pay on 20 it ain't gonna happen and for me I'm not looking for this overabundance thing like that because it's done cause laziness but when people struggling they're after the prey and they gotta break through a that's building their faith one time by the way brother brother brother branham have some meetings and and when he when he did the meetings there was a brother walked up say brother I'll take care of the whole thing you know I got it you even got to ask the people for an offering or nothing like that we got it you know the Lord blessed me said okay brother thank you we'll take that he said they went out they did the meze he said he was almost the worst meeting that he ever had say why every thought of expenses was paid everything else was ever happy to say he said no the people didn't have any part in it if they couldn't give out of their need then they couldn't get blessed and you looking for somebody else to bless you God wants to bless you once you give out of your knees see that's a challenge to your faith what the devil's doing is weakening your faith by sending somebody to bless you with all that but when you have to you have to exercise your faith it changes the whole situation so you got it but you got it you gotta be involved you gather you got the field attention I'm getting there cuz run around say attention is good for us you got I mean you gotta be pull from here to there because when you can pull this stretches you right make it make you Frank a little bit more how your son must give in and in a place of tension right now we don't know how we don't do this how're we gonna do that that's a good place to be because God will lead you what you should do what you shouldn't do and we need your the Spirit of God they are the sons of God so you gotta thank God for your attention thank God for the stress thank God pull the string the stress is not here to cause a distress but the stress is here to give you victory you need tension it stretches you even as a son of God it makes you think about things that you you wouldn't have thought about if you didn't have the tension if you didn't have the pressure the pressure pushes you into a place that you would have never gone into had you not had rush I the pressure pulls things out of you that you've been even know was inside of you you gotta have some crush on church see I don't want to be a lazy Christian right you you'd be surprised that you know what comes out when you know when a person under pressure brother branham said that that's that's how you can that's how you can tell who a person really is I mean you know week we go home I but we walk around and we you know praise God glory smiling grinning got my new suit got my new dress got my new shoes I mean you're looking good you're looking real good but when the pressure come right went went went through it and let me let me just let me just you know just try to clarify there there's too it's a stress and one is what we call the positive stress and one is a negative stress see when we're dealing with negative stress amen that's called distress right and it's something that will always lead you to a negative outcome but then you got positive stress which will always lead to a positive outcome now just bear with me here today for a little bit you know I mean sometimes God puts us in situations where it's positive stress it is stressful but it's positive let me give you an example where Moses got to the Red Sea it was a lot of pressure on Moses right Moses got to carry these people across this recipe but why he'd given it you know a faithful especially like a donkey can't figure out how I'm gonna get through this some of y'all faces some red seas this morning you're trying to figure out how you gonna get through this in your health you forgot how you gonna get through this and your finances you're trying to figure out how you gonna get through this in your emotions you trying to figure out you later and see Moses got pressure ain't mad from from his own people that what we go through that almost despising leaders half this way and why they sending that here come Pharaoh's army behind all that oh my lord my lord but I just love God and when I was in Tucson I told him say see when when you get to a stressful spot like that you need to understand God always got something up his sleeve let's see when God when you got something up your sleeve you ain't showed this to nobody they ain't never seen this one before ain't nobody ever you heard this one before and what God decides to do saying that not Moses man I told you what to do with the people now I see the obstacle but I ain't changed ain't changed my my mind just because you got an obstacle Oh y'all preach with me I'm not changing my mind because you got options I still gave you a task getting people to the other side take them take them take them so they can work get them to the promised land Mona Dukie you you just do whatever you got to do to make it see it had he not been in this stressful situation then the words that Moses spoke at that time we would have never heard but it was because of stress right the pressure produced a certain amount of power and what will the sense a dejection they could think that's all they can seize Egyptians right now Moses we bout to die and then maybe we pressed up against the sea we got a just behind us we don't know whether do we bother died or guardian so for that nothing never been done before he put the pillow fire in between the Gyptians and digital doom is rim cause darkness over here but lighting over here but he stood at stop dancing that Moses I told you Jordan take them overnight you figured out way more the same oh and now brother Adam said God did not even tell Moses to say this and this is this is I need you to get this because of some things God ain't gonna tell you to say it's gonna come by inspiration you ain't gon you you can't you ain't gonna be able to point then nobody say they did this not this gonna be something unique to you it's gonna be unique to you but but the pressure that you're under is gonna produce a certain power that you didn't even realize was there can I can I just let me just take it take a little bit more time Moses mighta forgot just like we forget he was a God is that in the Bible is that in the Bible he don't say say you be a god and let Aaron be your prophet [Applause] so when have you ever found God worrying about how things gonna work out show me in the scripture where God ever trying to sit there and figure out how this gonna happen I got I never did that God has always been in control and if God is dwelling inside of you you will also be in control not frustrated and flustered that's not how Kings act Moses Moses sits there underneath all this pressure man I got I got 2 million people that I got to get across this Red Sea I got Pharaoh's army behind me and I don't know what I'm getting ready to do Samos mountain you'd better figure out what you're gonna do and Moses by inspiration just says he's work says the Egyptians that should have seen today you'll see him no more forever he spoke that by inspiration God never even told me saying and then immediately after he said that he said Lord what what am I supposed to do now - Baba don't say that but brother Brandon picks that up because if you look at Exodus 14 he's sending Egyptians that you see the day 14 14 is just we just see today you'll see no more forever that's X is 14 14 but then in Exodus 14 15 he says speaking to the people and move forward now why I've got telling Moses to speaking to the people Moses evidently allows some doubt to ante in between verse 14 and verse 15 and some of y'all in between send me all in between verse 14 and verse 15 but the good news is that you gonna get the verse 15 and then I'm hoping yo mom is gonna sleep and when he spoke he put that back that that rod out stretch to ride out the sea began the part see that the pressure produce the power and when the sea began the part here he come walking through and then two million people come walking right behind me but that wasn't it then he then he took the pillar far away so that the Egyptians now they can see what happens there now we don't go in there after him and here seat not now when they when they come running in behind more than I love y'all y'all thought y'all did something we gonna get y'all we got horses y'all on foot we got horses we gonna get and as they come right in there the water close up on them you want to know why I don't water closed up because there was a God that spoke these Gyptians that you seen the day you will see no more forever so the Word of God could not fall to the ground in return boy but it had to count the very purpose in which it was sent if that was in Moses Church I'm trying to get you to see that is inside of you right when you when you leave here yo y'all just can't keep going back to work and acting like everybody else you're you're not then you're not then you're not of them you you you you don't you don't come from them don't let them people anoint you with their spirit you you you're a citizen of another Kingdom do you respond to things differently you actually create an environment you're you're a minute to create or if there's anything that makes a Christian lazy it's been there on the flowery bed of these flower bed obese listeners he says and I'm back at this he says we don't we don't have it persecution enough and if I can just reword that you don't have enough persecution now you might say I got too much no the Prophet said you ain't got enough you know why because you had more in it you'd be praying every day of the week I'll tell you I'm gonna be honest I'm be honest I find that I really can get a break today when I'm going through something all of sudden ain't tired when I want to pray come on somebody well you don't get tired now I mean you you gotta reach you you put your phone down you you won't let people distract you look I got a rich guy I got a situation that only God can handle that's why we need the persecution so so so you know this this is why you got a welcome tension the tension is actually the pressure that's going to produce power listen says if there's anything that makes Christian lazy its when they're on a flower bed of ease we don't have it persecution enough we don't have it hard enough always at the chain is the strongest at its weakest link a man and a man under pressure is what he is when he's under pressure his true characteristics will show when he's under pressure get him all riled up and then you'll see the real man come out if he's got a temper it'll show it if he's a meek and gentle it'll show itself put him under pressure once and God puts all his children I want y'all to get that God puts oh you thought the devil is bringing that and you just rear Buchanon up well I think sometimes even I ain't even do nothing you didn't even give me permission to do nothing I ain't touching they still blaming me everything from the devil look at this God puts all his children under test to see whether there's any flaws and then well I tell you what we're gonna give a devil mind better when we start praising God for our trials all right he kept on going to say here not long ago during the the great deal of depression it was easy to find people at a prayer meeting but now they can work in the defense plants and the union gives them so much money that they hardly know what to do with you have to almost persuade them to a meeting oh my sometime I we get so busy we busier than God you know you're busy if you that you you busy you can't you got no time for God something wrong with your schedule praise the Lord somebody I mean you're gonna have to learn how to slow things down in your life right give God more than Sunday yeah oh you thought you did something you actually thought you did well I'm there on Sunday morning that's it we hear three or four times a week and you only made it to one out of the side of the phone and you think you did something and you want a blessing now you don't get some stress positive stress things that make you come to the prayer meetin we ain't seen I don't know why I've always seen huh why why do you think they here they go through something just listen to them pray and we're gonna be right at glory we've an atmosphere yes [Music] keep them only knees God all right let me keep going Union give them so much money that they hardly know what to do with it you almost have to persuade them to a meeting they got it all the people doesn't want preaching anymore you got you get somebody to come up here and act a clown and this auditorium would pack out the first night somebody to come up here and jingle a few things run up and down a platform scream a few times turn a handspring the to the people wants entertainment and not the gospel brother when it comes to that place that I have to substitute something else for the gospel I'll close the Bible and go home right when the precious blood of Jesus Christ reached in its power don't attract the people there Dan he says but we got too many televisions and too many radio programs and entertainments a Christian wants to be entertained by the Holy Spirit and too much war has leaked into the church and they have substituted entertainment in the stand of gospel preaching the old fashioned gospel that saved your father and mother is just as good tonight as it was in that day and always will be it is still the same thrill did I'll get that the preacher the gospel will give you a three glory to God I don't know if you ever felt that before but sometime you're just sitting there listening to the word you can be in church you can be at home listening to the tape in your car all of a sudden the revelation just come from heaven and might just give you a thrill and just give you a charge I was just listening to the radio yesterday I listened to the sermon said I hadn't listened to it in a while we preached that sermon three or four years ago but but as I'm listening I'm like man I feel some time as a preacher you don't know what you stand so you have to go back and listen to it and it inspires you the Word of God always inspire you listen to what I say here says they have substituted entertainment instead of gospel preaching old-fashioned gospel that saved your father mother's just as good tonight as it was and that day it always will be of still it's still the same thrill to the Christian heart as it was in st. Paul who sealed his testimony with his blood I'll stop right there on that particular quote see tension is something that's that's needed the brother branham made a couple statements and united time of silent won't read that whole quote but I'll just give you a few statements that he made this attention is a part of living it says when you know when that struck him so that kind of encouragement when I thought of that right if you had no tension you'd be like a rag doll and you had you wouldn't have no feelings there'd be nothing you could work on right say tension brings you closer together you talk about even a husband and wife they have tension but the tension actually brings them closer together right it says you say some people try to introduce Christianity that you're free from worry no you're not say you're try to say you're free from tension no you add tension when you become a Christian now why why would you add tension because God is trying to get from you what he put in you and it's only through the tension through the pressure that the power can be demonstrated he said after all attention is a blessing that's why the Bible say count it all joy right count it all joy now let's let's just pick up a scripture here you know whatever whatever is trying you you just count it all joy I give me a just give me a second here I'm gonna go to two mark six in a second just give me just give me a little bit more time I want to want to just kind of drop into a few things here give me just let me make a few more comments here just uh and I'll get to mark six in a second and we'll read from there we're talk about this tension now brother Branham was saying here we really you know we all have this I would say personal individual attention we have trials and tribulations that we all go through that's a part of life we should expect that but as a church at the body of Christ as a whole will also have some tensions that they would actually endure right and one of the things that he said in services this time and said the seven thunders would give the church rapture and faith right and what the seven thunders is it's the mysteries that were contained in the seven seals right that's what the Prophet taught us the thunders were the mysteries that were contained in the seven seals and you say the thunders is what's going to give the church rapture and faith right the revelation of the word is what's going to give the church rapture and faith amen he also sent this and the message look away to Jesus said the third pool would start the rapture in faith right and and and and in other places he told us that the third pool was the opening of the word so if the third pool is open the word we feet not that worth that's what's gonna give us the wrapped rain thing and we go back to that statement that brother Branham said I represent that faith so we want to hear what the Prophet has got to say if he's the one representing that faith that was once delivered to the Saints now in this message look away to Jesus just a quick quote here this is a pair of thirty-eight it says so now I am going to say something to you now that I haven't said all along and that is the thing that we have looked for for it to for so long for it for at least many years four or five years or maybe longer the third pool has now been vindicated and and I'm sure you all know what it is and I remember there will never be an impersonation of that because it can't be see it cannot be now it's in existent and I have I am warned of this that soon right at this time now it's just happening so it could identify its presence among you see but it will not be used in a great way until this council begins to tighten up and when it does when that does the Pentecostals and so forth can almost impersonate anything can be done but when that time comes when the squeeze comes down then you'll see what you've seen temporarily be manifested in the fullness of its power see see see see now when we just think about that because you know again I can go all through the prophets ministry and when we you know I think there was different times in his ministry where the pressure produced power there were stairs multiple times that we could just go to a multiple testimonies that he shared with us where where pressure produced a certain amount of power one of those was when he was when he found himself in his car and and remember when we talked about this type of power is controlled by motive and objective don't ever forget that right it's just it's not something you just do just because you want to do you don't go to the hospital try to get everybody at the hospital it might be one person that you need to see come on right that's what Jesus did and in John 5 he went went down to the pool and and there was only one man that he went to see he left everybody else there so you know this pressure produces pounds brother Brandon was was was out riding his car and he remembered Robin's gonna say there's a shape that lives across this field I gotta go with and pray for them they they meet prayer you say they're sick they need prayer and I got to get out and I got to go over there so he just jumped out his calm not thinking went run across the field to go pray for the saint but as he crossed the field he got to a little spot in the field and all we heard was and it hit him it was a killer bull sitting there and he said Oh Lord he said he's the first thing the Prophet did not eat you got to understand he's the first thing he did is reach for his gun and when he realized that man I ain't got my gun I ain't got my gun say nada I didn't heard the testimony see whose report you're gonna believe I haven't heard your testimony that the last man that crossed the path of this bull he didn't live to tell about it but he said I got to go pray for the same over here and say you know I I didn't I don't have my gun I can't shoot this animal I don't you say he say he say all I'm saying just kind of fell the love come over and he began to just talk to the bull he say say mr. bull I'm sorry what I'm sorry mr. bull this is your territory and I crossed your territory I am so sorry but I'm going over here to pray for one of God's sick joke it's said mr. bull just turn around and go back and lay down in the name of Jesus I'm sorry said that bull start and start charging got with him just a couple feet of them turn around and win and lay down that pressure produced a power one time he got cutting grass and while he cutting grass see you know he's he's going getting a little bit too close to the fence and he got a little bit too closer and he hit the fence and all of a sudden there was some killer bees they had a hive right there and said that when they come out they just start swirling I'm nest without hive who is it and here they come looking for the Prophet just all I'm just come around he was getting ready to die had no shirt on right Gary I mean he was get rid of that but he looked at the bee say I'm that I interrupted job y'all just go right back to y'all behave I'm sorry talk to the bees you know the bees did circle them and went right back inside they have the pressure of getting ready to die but a bite of some bees produced power I want you to understand something you might find yourself it's a very difficult circumstances when brother Branham was sharing those testimonies that one just so that we can say brother Branham did this in brother Branham did that that's all you know that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today forever and he will do the same for you if you will let him as many of our situations brother branham found himself in the middle at Colorado storm and had you know while he was there he just heard that the voice of the Lord just you know pretty much tell him saying I'll turn and go back into the storm he said lord I I'll die now turn go back into see when God told him to do that God knew exactly why he told him to do that and when he got up there sighs no storms I love what what you want me to say speak to the storm they say you say what's gonna happen not not God saying you tell the storm what's supposed to happen say this is a said storm I want you to go back and I want the Sun to come shining for four days say people in the city when they got down there they say that a storm was coming we and we was waiting on the storm and then it seemed like it started then just stop just like that we don't know what happened brother Branham knew what happened but you know what he didn't tell them what was the use o you now you know why that storm stopped you'll know you'll know well let me tell you that's not that that's the wrong motive and the wrong objective if they didn't know they just didn't know so yeah I'm gonna tell you how cuz there was a time when you before brother Branham preached American divorce you know we were just there me and brother Steven we was looking at finger Rock and now you know the the pillar fire was going up and down the rock people can see it just up and down the rock so we we we took a picture of the gas station where brother Ronnie was was was working right and brother Ronnie say brother branham use up in that mountain when you say no no no I went up there say yes you was I know you was up there say what what you talked about brother Ronnie say we could see the glory of God that's going up and down the mountain up and down see tonight the man you can shake him he knew what was going on there now bring brother branham I might not have told him everything God told him but he knew the Prophet had been in that spot brother branham can deny it the glory God showed it see if you know if people don't if they kind of get some inkling fine but if they don't know nothing just let it be my brother Brandon spoke to that storm that pressure that he was under produced a power and let's look at a scripture here and and and and and Mark chapter 6 if you all just bear with me you're gonna find yourself in some situations of pressure but that's not to make you cave-in that's actually to bring something out of you that you didn't realize was there oh let's let's pick this story up here in mark chapter 6 and I'm gonna read from verse verse 30 glory to God now it says and the pastas gathered themselves together unto Jesus and told him all things both what they had done and what they had told now this this is kind of important here as we as we go through this this story that we're about to read you will find this one story is probably the only story that is found in all four Gospels right Matthew Mark Luke and John this this this miracle that occurred here this is the only one that I found this recorded in all four Gospels right but here you know we want it we wanted to try to catch something so here the disciples in verse 30 says in the the apostle's gathered themselves together to Jesus and told him all things both what they had done and what they had talked and he said unto them come ye yourselves apart into a desert place and rest awhile but there were many coming there were many comment and going and they had no leisure so much as to eat now just so you get a little bit more clarity on what they were shared and over in Luke 9 you found the same story but in Luke 9 it kind of tells us that Jesus that given the disciples power over unclean spirits to cast out devils and do all these other things you know what you got that same power right now right so he gave him this power and and they were out exercising the power and authority that Jesus had given them and as they were exercising in that you know now they're coming back and giving their praise reports and they're just sharing this with Jesus and and the first thing Jesus say to them is like you know okay let's let's come aside let's get this he said come give yourselves apart into a desert place I want you to catch this he calls them apart but he takes them into a desert place where nothing is really happening I mean you ain't gonna find too much going on in the desert right in a desert place and then he tells them their rest a while listen let's watch this let's watch this rest a while hallelujah can you I just want you to follow here they tell him Jesus all these good things that's happening and in the midst everybody said now come and rest in this desert place come come and just just just rest the wild in this desert place follow the story it says verse 32 and they departed into a desert place by ship privately and the people saw them departing and many knew him and ran a foot with her out of all cities and out with them and came together unto Him so pretty much these people arrived before Jesus arrived they knew where he was going and they got there before he got there oh I wish we had folk that would follow Jesus like that today says and Jesus when he came out saw much people and was moved with compassion toward them because they were as sheep not having a shepherd and he began to teach them many things and when when the day was now far spent his disciples came unto him and said this is a desert place another time is far past now now remember Jesus invited them to this place Jesus is the one that suggested that they go to this desert place oh I wish that was with me right Jesus is the one that that that arranged this Jesus already knew that it'll be no restaurants in the desert place Jesus already knew that you know and I mean they were have nothing to eat when they got to the desert place Jesus knew have been no animals for them to even start a barbecue with in the desert place Jesus knew that it would be an empty place when they got to the desert place but yet he invited them after they shared all their testimonies I want you to see that even you know I don't know I know God's done some great things for you but he got some more that he want to do with you and every time he put you in a stressful situation it's a time for you to remember and reflect on what he's already done don't you complain don't you why you speak and you keep moving forward because if God did it before he will do it again I could just imagine as the Sun was just setting maybe maybe somebody you know one disciples maybe Judas is the first one to us in there you know we got to get these people out of here they come a long way they then got nothing to eat we in this desert place they ain't got none eat we got to get him out of here and maybe since Judas once you go tell Jesus I ain't going up there I ain't gonna get rebuked by him I'm gonna get Peter Peter you know we out here in this desert place and you know and we ain't got no food some of the people hungry I actually heard I'm saying that they hungry I heard once you go tell Jesus no no no no you know he rebuked me get behind me Satan he done told me that before and I am ain't hang on I gonna try Jesus like that John you know he love you John why don't you go up there and all I'm saying what I look ya'll I'm sorry ain't brave enough to do this so the Bible say all love okay and just imagine all 12 them coming up to Jesus look at what they say verse 35 says and when the day was now far spent his disciples came unto him and said I want y'all to get this because this is reasoning this is reasoning this is reasoning this is the stuff we're trying to get rid of yeah I mean look at and then it made sense to your natural mind but it's not speaking faint faith is the sixth sense faith sees things that the natural stuff can see look at it church look at it right he says in and when the day was now far spent his disciples came in and said this is a desert place like Jesus didn't know that didn't he invite them there this is a desert place and now the time is far past look at it it says send them away that they may go into the country round about and into the villages and buy themselves bread but they have nothing to eat before they just breaking it down after they finished hearing all their testimonies verse 37 say and he answered and he said unto them give you them to eat I just like I like Jesus I love Jesus I just love Jesus so he this is some permission how we gonna give them something to eat well what were we supposed to get this from we are in a desert place where is this supposed to come from see and I don't know where you are you might find yourself in a desert place you might be trying to figure out where is it gonna come from it's gonna come from your mouth when you open your mouth and call for it it will come if you could only believe we sang it but we don't believe it you know just take that hold me right there keep it right there right there I just want to inject this last week I was telling you all about brother Branham having the young lady you can take the scripture down but just leave it at 37 so I remember where I was where he went into the room and he saw that string hanging you know on the just up in the ceiling and when you saw the string the girl was saying I got faith I got faith brother Graham I don't care what my church say I got faith you say sister you got faith he's like yeah I got it I got it he say sister if you got faith move little that string just move from side to side and then he says it's hanging from his gender they say it's a mover from socks I didn't just stop it if you got faith just said came nobody to do that say yes you can you can do it she say she say brother branham no no that's that's spiritualism can't nobody do not like that say yes you can sister so she say brother branham can you do it yeah you said everybody else turn around don't look at this just I need to work with her just just just let me work with her and in total saying I don't look at me sister you look at the string cuz imma tell you if I was there if I was there I'm be honest with y'all if I was there and brother branham did that I'm still gonna be looking at how did you just do it there I need to know what just I'm missing something I need what you got come on church let's be honest but-but-but-but the reason they say don't look at me cuz he didn't want us getting focused on him we got to get focused on Christ cuz the same Christ that dwelled on his prophet that made him be able to do that and I because the reason I'm bringing his back but me and brother Solomon's fellowship in last week and he brought out a point that I forgot to share with you I said I got to go back and hit that again well brother Braniff said don't look at me you look at the string he say the young lady looked at the string just the string and it went to and fro and then it just stopped the young lady say brother branham you got to give me some scripture on that I ain't never I mean this that's that spiritualism that's of the devil that's of the devil he said magicians use this all the time they say this is of God this is faith and say you won't scripture they say and it took it to the scripture you know out of a marquee 11 22 through 24 but verse verse 22 and Jesus answering saith unto them have faith in God for their last interview that who service is saying to this mountain be thou removed and be thou castles and see and shall not doubt in his heart but believe but shall believe those things which he said shall come to pass he should have whatsoever said so your faith could move mountains it can certainly move a string if Jesus say we can move mountains you can move the string what a testimony kept going that girls little puzzle y'all want me to tell it to you read it to you I find that when y'all see what the Prophet said it's still a little bit better with ya cuz otherwise y'all just taking my word for it let's read it faith is the substance I'm not reading the whole thing I'm just reading I just set you up to get you to this part that I want to read to you then I'm gonna go back to that description we'll be done for the day I promise you oh my god I want y'all to see this so faith is a sudden I'm at paragraph 42 it says now then of course fasten my officer to that bracelet which you can yourself if you won't doubt in your heart and it started moving around and then it moved back and forth around crossways and stopped it she said brother Branham she said that's that spiritualism I said I thought maybe you say something like that mine isn't it strange how people that profess they know God and know so little about him isn't that right can I just put it this way it isn't strange her message believers I'm not operational at this level she said you know we belong to the Church of Christ excuse me I didn't mean to say I don't mean the state excuse me Church of Christ people I didn't mean to say that see anyhow said we speak where the Bible speaks in silent with a Bible silent you know and you you have that slogan I've questioned that a few times I said all right she said there's no such a thing it can be showed in the Bible anything like that I said I felt that's what you would say I said sure that's it in the Bible she said well I never I don't believe it alright I said you don't believe it she said now you show me where that's where that's at in the Bible I said one day Jesus passed by a tree he wanted to find some fruit on it there was no fruit on it he put a curse on it and a tree and the tree began to wilt and when they passed by at noon the tree was Wilson down Peter remarked I said how quick the tree was wilted he said if you would say in your heart for this tree to be plucked up and cast into the sea and wouldn't doubt doubt it it would obey you did he said and I said he said if you say to this mountain be moved and don't down in your heart by and by it would come to pass did he say it sure he did I said I know your unbelieving pastor trying to justify his unbelief said that was a mountain of sin I went to school myself he was kneeling by mount Olive's it was Mount of Olives if you stay in your heart for it to be moved and don't doubt it I said how much more faith and they said if you had faith the size of a mustard seed I said now faith the size of a mustard seed with what move that mountain how much more smaller faith would you have would you have just to move that bracelet it goes on you see what I mean and and and some of y'all got that scripture the mustard seed faith you got your mustard seeds in your Bible that we put in there from brother Peregrine that gave us in Cana by the tail you that you ain't got the mustard seed in your Bible even though you can't see it the reason if you got the reason that Jesus say have faith asylum must see it because a muscle suit can't be mixed with anything else it can't be tampered with your faith cannot be tampered with no reasoning no doubt nothing faith no explaining faith listen you see what I mean now I've often wondered why he said muscle see that I might drop this top muscle see there's a smallest among all see that's right but there is a nothing with mixed with mustard seed it's all mustard you can't mix it with kale or nothing and make it grow and salt mustard if you got that much faith all faith not mixed up with something else ask what you will it'll be given to you but it can't be wavering it's got to be genuine mustard if you know what I'm speaking of all right and I said how much more would it take well she said lookie here I want to ask you something she said did God move that or did the devil move I said neither one move that she said them how in the world did it move I said I moved it she said well you're 15 feet are better away from it I said no it's my faith that moved in see if you ask anything and don't doubt see what I mean that girl wanted to know did God move the string I did the devil move the string brother I'm saying no God didn't move it and neither did the devil move it I moved that's a person that knows who they are in Christ person that understands what faith is all about we talked about how he said if that if that knife was at home he could bring it off the dresser and put it in his pocket we don't understand that you let me try - he didn't pray and ask in the name of Jesus for the string to move that would be God moving it he didn't do that he moved it himself with his faith based on Scripture now he didn't do this all the time he did it because he needed her to see that she didn't have the faith that she claimed she had motive and objective so yeah when the Holy Spirit is bringing these type of things to attention you know I'm up here preaching this but you know what I'm trying to operate like this and and I feel like what the Holy Spirit's doing is challenging me the pressure that I'm going through is gonna produce some power the power is already inside of you you don't even realize but it take a situation I mean a difficult something that's just a lot of tension that's gonna pull this out of here oh I believe that who moved the string the prophets say I did it my faith in it my faith and there's gonna be some things that happen in your life your faith gonna take care of your faith gonna make it happen I'm just sewing the seeds and some time are you digging in ground like this boy it's hard but you know what nonetheless it's got to be said because this does not no name it and claim it faith this is this is higher than that we're going higher than name it and claim it we're going back to the original faith that was in God the original face that let there be and the Bible said there was that that's where we're headed back to I got quotes up here for y'all I'm and I'm gonna read it - I ain't gonna let y'all get away without me reading this a man I ain't gonna let the devil rush me out of here man there's got to be preached to the people glory to God I mean so so decease because this is what's coming forth so just give me a let me go back to the scripture I'm gonna read a couple more cokes and then I'll let you go and in Jesus name I promised let me just find where the quotes that I want to read to you I got two of them that I need to read to you yeah okay I got him all right so March 6 verse 37 now remember let's go back the disciples have shared all the powerful testimonies with Jesus you know what they did when he gave them power to go cast out devils and everything now he pulls them to the side pulls them into the desert place that get there to a desert place and and they're in a spot now where no food nothing and they see the people getting hungry and and they approached Jesus and they say Jesus you know sent him send him some villages and send him around about let him go get some bread cuz they ain't got nothing to eat verse 37 now he says he answered and said to them give you them to eat and they say to him just y'all push ourselves on the scene just just try to imagine what this is like right I mean here you know here give you them to eat now we thought we brought to you a real problem you understand Jesus that is this is a desert place Sun is going down shops are closed these people had gotten a neat and it's a long journey to get back home we came by boat they came by by by Flynn you've been preaching all day y'all put yourself on the sing all right I mean jeez you've been preaching a long time I know you can feel a little sorry for the people but then gotten a knee they say you feed them you you give them something to eat now look at this and they said to him shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread and give them the eat is that what you want to do they they they they reasoning with it and they said to them how many loaves have you go and see and when they knew they say five and two fishes I just see this I don't know I don't know I know it just it reads so quick but you got to see them going amongst 5,000 people 12 men going amongst 5,000 people we're looking for some food what you got I bring nothing I was just excited to come get in service ain't bring nothing it's the same thing with me I just wanted to come to church I ain't bringing them to eat I am hungry but I ain't got none eat what you got I ain't got me I ain't got no one little boy 12 year old boy well I got two fish and these five loaves of bread all right all right Sonny Jesus like is I can just see Peters now Jesus you still around through this old cloud 5,000 people ain't no better guy than you know we found here Jesus to fish and five loaves of bread that's all we got let's look at it what does he do he can meant them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass now I want you to know before they went to this desert place jesus knew that it wouldn't be no restaurants out there jesus knew there's only gonna be one person amongst five thousand four thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine people had nothing to eat but he knew there'd be one but in order to get things accomplished first you gotta get him to calm down everybody sit down everybody sit down oh my see sometimes the folk art can do anything through you got to get your spirit calm down calm down calm down calm down calm down I can't even speak to you like that I can't do nothing for you you can't even hear my voice relax calm down sit down command them to make all sit down by companies and pound the green grass they set down the ranks by hundreds and by fifties and really he told the disciples to feed him look at what happened and they were taken when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes he looked up to heaven and blessed and brake the loaves and we gave them to gave them to his disciples they still had the responsibility to feed them he blessed and break the loaves and gave them to his disciples to set before them and the two fishes divided he among them all to start breaking the fish and as he would break more would grow break more would grow break more with growth break more with grow break bread more would grow break fish Warwick Grove just that's the God we serve we but but I'm gonna tell you you didn't you wouldn't have saw this had he not taken there had he not taken them to the desert place come on church if they would have been at the buffet they would have never saw this was under pressure it produced some foul verse 42 and they did all eat and we're feel not just ate but they was but they probably had the best meal I ever had not like and they took up twelve basketfuls of the fragments and of the fishes and they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men that's not counting the women and the children that's just a man church pressure produces and and notice he had to bring them into a place like that in order for them to see even after they were sharing all their powerful testimony we did this we did that we did this but Charlie seemed that like this before see everything you go through God got purpose for him cause he gave me just expressed something so matter to you ain't you never hurt you never heard if I heard about it you never seen it but God won't express it to you anyway can I just read two quotes and then we'll close here this is Abraham and his seed after him Abraham and his seed after him yes Abraham and his seed after him just just a title alone puts you in this quote just just for you here to Abraham and his seed after him okay he's talking to me he's talking to me because I'm a seed of Abraham because I'm in Christ I'm a seed of Abraham now look at this I want you to notice that was just before the destruction now before the promise was fulfilled watch just moment now after he made him that place is named now positioning place to call him through justification you believe that his see-through justification sanctification through the blood to the seat filling with himself filling with itself pouring herself and to him as El Shaddai the Holy Spirit now placing him and given him a part of his name Elohim a small el ahem a man was born to be a God their birth not by mistake you were born to be a God you got a mortify the deeds in his flesh now you're born to be a God see if you was up late watching the fighting on it the devil do that so you can come to church and be tired don't do that how long you're gonna talk about the fame you want to talk about today tomorrow next week how long we gonna talk about it there's gonna be another fight then we're gonna talk about that but when we're just gonna say forget about it I ain't following none of this foolishness huh it's just a demo right and we got to stop getting to this thing we're on balance God and things of the world no no no you don't balance god with the things the world you don't balance God with nothing it's all God it's just all God right but church we got to get to the point that mean these not scriptures just this jet there to be there we got to start being this I love has got to be so much for the things of God that nothing else matters no temporary power I want permanent power let me finish reading this see man was born to be a god now you say that's wrong Jesus said does it does it don't to say that does it don't stay in your own loss ye are dots and why do you condemn me then if your own laws say you're God's he was given a domain the domain was the earth the whole earth is groaning waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God if I'm a Branham I'm a brand I'm part of a brand and if a man is a son of God he is made in the image of God and given the domain here on earth to rule this earth like God ruled it and the second Adam proved it Amen he stopped nature peace be still a man cursed the fig tree certainly he was a man yet he was God he was a manifested son of God listen to this statement that's what we're to be one of these days y'all get that so that's what we're to be this just all of this is bringing you to this place all the preaching are to listen to tapes all to go into meat is bringing you to this place that's what we're to be one of these days and I can't wait for the day that I can step up here and see this day this scripture is fulfilled it says we're just coming to it through justification the sees of Abraham coming up I read that quoting I thought about raising octaves we're coming up Church last one out of questions and answers on the Holy Ghost alright oh praise God a man says had it right the other days she didn't ask for nothing she was just sitting there but she said the right thing do you know you could be in church and say the right thing you're Amen at the right time like this oh my might move God you know why because that a man is coming out of the place of a struggle right you come out of a real heart was even that just not you God said now see I told y'all to y'all you've been bragging on you and everything I told y'all that's my child right there ain't even thinking about what they're going through still got an amen on the inside still got a praise on the inside of me out of everything I'm going through I still got that praise right the other day she didn't act for nothing she was just sitting there but she said the right thing which please the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit spoke back and said had to ask anything that you will whatever you got and you won't find out whether this is really not ask anything the healing of her little crippled sister sitting there all brought up $10,000 to keep her from digging on the on the mills over there the youth restored to her well rundown body so you got to know how to ask when God gave had it right when the first one to be told to ask anything because Solomon was told that in the Bible and and Solomon asked for wisdom and because he actually the right thing God said I give you money with your wisdom mmm you gotta know what to ask for that's first thing we think about is money but after you get through this bill you're gonna get some mo they come in and that's just a part of life you you get over this mountain you get over this hurdle but it gonna be some oh come hey man that just you know you get you just get usually and that's why I say I don't want abundance where I can just stop praying about all those knees just satisfy these and satisfy teeth and when the next one come I'll be back here to talk to you amen that pressure just keeps us there keeps us at his feet look at this it goes on to say this healing of a crippled little crippled system sending they all drawn up ten thousand dollars to keep them from digging on the on their meals over there the youth restored to her well rundown body whatever you want to ask you ask it right now if it don't come and give it to you right now then I'm a false prophet that's something isn't it Jesus that say to this mountain and you heard about what's been taking place that's the ministry listen this that's the Ministry of that we're entering into what ministry to say to this mountain ministry I must say a man that's the ministry I'm entering into and I'm speaking out over this church we're entering into the ministry speak the word only say to this mountain no more complaining about our problems speak the word over the promise remember I just told you all this it was brother branham's faith that moved the string not the prayer of faith his personal fan where's your personal faith how you fueling and feeding your personal faith well what are you doing what are you listening to during the week I've been trying to will peculiar people we don't listen to Tom Joyner we don't listen to these beep accusing all right we turn that stuff off it's not edifying Stephen E Smith I don't listen to him either when I saw him on TV I turned him down who turned it down me you I did I'm sitting here in your lobby and this is noise trying to read my Bible I came to read my Bible spirits coming out of this thing turn it down a man Church and and social media got is just going from one app to the next app to the next step eventually all gonna have to stop and say only I'm not doing all these that I can't follow everybody and you following the same people in all the places they got you in facebook they got you in snapchat they got your name and you just spot them from and then trying to wonder why you can't get that done but I need if a business go ahead and only you got to follow everybody well I got to follow them taking off our okay you keep on going down that path how many follows you won't and how many people you're gonna follow does God know how you're accountable for those people that's following you that's your sphere of influence and you ain't said nothing about Jesus all right oh praise the Lord a man or we get them or we just get like the song say I need just a little bit more Jesus I'm just getting a little Jesus but then I'm gonna pull out I'll tell you what you throw it you throw some serious drop down Adam and see who really you're following long as you Benny you entertaining people there finally but when you give them the real stuff the real deal see if they follow you found out who your followers are just give them a real good Scripture something like repent repent and be converted see you already know right there Jesus shut down his church - right he gave one sermon Church was shut unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood to have no part with me one sermon he had a yeah church a little bit bigger than ours 82 people 82 people one sermon lost 70 stood at that stood at the church door and shook all their hands as they walked down god Bless You God bless you God bless you we so enjoyed having you god bless you let them all go then walk back to the pulpit with 12 members left and ask the question it's certainly one over he knew what he had said shook then I want to shake one more time will you also go I'm not even accident in the state will you go 12 people in the church who acts and then belief I want to see what the real ones were and Peter stood up where we going you don't know one got the words of eternal life we stand right here we ain't going nowhere and Peter thought that was something Jesus had one more pull on the sermon the third pool I know two of you out here but one of y'all still a devil oh that that shook him man now he called the other 70s at left Devils but one of us is a devil which one of us is out of 12 this word get tight y'all now if you if you rather late brother Jack called me a devil now I'm gonna have to check I don't know I'm have to check you because you know if you you got that out of that something wrong somewhere you should identify just said well I'm a believer what a devil but 11 of us are believers and I'm a believer I ain't going nowhere all right let me let me let me let me finish he says this if I don't come and give it to you right now then I'm a false prophet that's that's something isn't it Jesus that soldiers so say say to this mountain and you've heard it you've heard about what's been taking what's been what what's been taking place that's the ministry that we're entering into we're way up the road now soon the coming of the Lord Jesus and we've got to have rapture in faith any church that could be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye to go out or will not go I like this but don't worry it'll be there it'll be there and when the power of this church Rises it'll bring its brother the power of that church rises will bring its brother the power of that church will bring the other brother in then there'll be a great I mean there'll be a general resurrection we're looking forward to it the church we got to put these seeds in there because this is what we expected to come forth we ain't got faith enough for our headaches how we're
