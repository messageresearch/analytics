[27:40] guess it was Friday I had a nail in my
[27:43] tire I think it was Thursday had a nail
[27:46] in my tire so I went and plugged it and
[27:48] everything so um Friday Friday the air
[27:52] was still leaking out and naom me asked
[27:55] me she was like it's down to 15% can you
[27:57] go change the tire so I jacked up the
[27:59] car took the tire off went and put air
[28:01] in the tire and uh came back home put
[28:05] the tire back on and I had a long day
[28:09] yesterday had to go to Homestead and
[28:11] then pumping over then Fort Lauderdale
[28:13] back home well on my way back uh the
[28:17] tire pressure was low I was like I just
[28:19] fixed this why is it low and I just
[28:22] couldn't understand why I was low so um
[28:25] when I got to Vero beach I was like okay
[28:30] let me let me check this tire while I
[28:31] fill up fill up again and I checked the
[28:34] tire and I noticed the air was coming
[28:36] out of that stem I was like okay that's
[28:38] where the issue
[28:40] is but as I was looking at the tires I
[28:44] realized that I didn't tighten all the
[28:47] the bolts on there and two of them came
[28:49] off and one was just hanging
[28:51] on Lord Jesus thank you Lord I was like
[28:54] oh my
[28:56] God thank than you
[28:59] Lord praise the
[29:02] Lord I have been driving all day like
[29:05] that but the Lord kept yes thank you
[29:08] Lord
[29:10] hallelujah thank you Lord so when I say
[29:12] some of us could have been dead and gone
[29:15] it it could have been ugly it could have
[29:16] been ugly and the thing was he wanted me
[29:20] to know so he allowed that air to come
[29:22] out again so I'm just thankful for how
[29:26] mindful God is like the song says even
[29:29] when we don't see it he's working when
[29:32] we don't know it he's working he knows

[44:04] here um couple weeks ago and uh we just
[44:08] have this kind of uh
[44:11] relationship where uh you know uh if
[44:15] he's passing through the states like he
[44:16] was and if he just happen to be anywhere
[44:19] in Florida we're going to have to pull
[44:21] on him to get him amen and uh but
[44:23] anytime he comes then the door starts
[44:26] swinging open on the other side and uh
[44:28] so he mentioned to me that brother Jack
[44:30] we'd love to have you all for Easter
[44:33] Amen in 2024 so uh we as a church have
[44:37] been invited Amen to go to London for

[44:44] desire to go um you know we'll all have
[44:47] to just kind of discuss and see you know
[44:49] what what's the the proper plan uh but
[44:52] uh we'll get it all worked out amen
[44:54] because you know some will still be here
[44:56] here for service but some others may
[44:57] want to go so uh we want to try to work
[45:00] um together make sure that we don't
[45:02] create a burden for the ministry over
[45:04] there so let's let's work together on
[45:06] that if you desire to go um other thing
[45:10] I just need to mention uh to you um this

[59:05] mouth in his humiliation his judgment
[59:07] was taken away and who shall declare his
[59:10] generation for his life is taken from
[59:13] the earth and the unoch asked Phillip
[59:15] and and said I pray thee of whom
[59:17] speaketh the Prophet this of himself or
[59:20] of some other men then Philip opened his
[59:23] mouth and began at the same scripture
[59:26] and preach unto him Jesus amen what we
[59:30] have to preach is Jesus though he was
[59:33] reading the book of Isaiah he didn't
[59:35] preach Isaiah to him he preached Jesus
[59:38] Christ though we read William Brown
[59:40] message We Don't Preach William Braham
[59:42] but we preach Jesus Christ to the heart
[59:44] of your people 36 and as they went on
[59:47] their way they came onto a certain water
[59:50] and the unoch asked see here is water
[59:53] what doth hinder me to be baptized and
[59:55] Philip said if thou believest with all
[59:59] thine heart that's a pray requisite you
[1:00:02] don't have to be nothing but if you can
[1:00:05] believe with all of your heart you don't
[1:00:07] have to be a righteous person you can be
[1:00:09] a sinner but if you can believe the Lord
[1:00:12] Jesus Christ with all of your heart you
[1:00:14] can be baptized amen and baptism in the
[1:00:17] name of Jesus Christ is baptism in the
[1:00:20] nature of Jesus Christ name is a nature
[1:00:23] it's not just the name Jes Jus all right
[1:00:25] but said that I have a lot of Hispanic
[1:00:27] friend who called Jesus Jesus so the
[1:00:29] name Jesus people are called Jesus but
[1:00:33] there's a nature in that particular name
[1:00:34] Jesus that's the nature of omnipotent
[1:00:37] right so he said and Philip said if thou
[1:00:41] believe if thou believest with all thine
[1:00:43] heart thou mayest and he answered and
[1:00:45] said I believe that Jesus Christ is the
[1:00:47] Son of God and he commanded the Chariot
[1:00:49] to stand still and they went down both
[1:00:51] into the water both Philip and unoch and
[1:00:54] he baptized him and when they were come
[1:00:56] out of the water the spirit of the Lord
[1:00:58] called away Philip that the Enoch saw
[1:01:01] him no more and he went on his way
[1:01:02] rejoicing but Philip was found in aatos
[1:01:05] and passing through he preached in all
[1:01:07] the cities till he came to cesaria God
[1:01:09] bless you may take our
[1:01:17] seat glory to the Lord in the highest of
[1:01:20] Heaven amen
[1:01:23] hallu
[1:01:25] so the first slide we want to look at
[1:01:27] the throne
[1:01:28] room and how it pertains to our our
[1:01:32] lives so we want to kind of give a
[1:01:33] picture of what is a throne right so
[1:01:36] Throne is in certain dictionaries said
[1:01:38] it's a chamber usually containing a
[1:01:40] throne second slide please used by
[1:01:42] Sovereign Sovereign for audience the
[1:01:44] location of actual power or authority as
[1:01:46] in the particular government or business
[1:01:48] organization another definition says
[1:01:51] impressive a throne is an impressive
[1:01:52] setting for a monarch to precise side in
[1:01:54] Majesty over official ceremonies to hold
[1:01:57] Council to Grant audience to receive
[1:01:59] homage to award High Hest and offices
[1:02:02] and to perform other official functions
[1:02:05] so that is a throne but then we are not
[1:02:07] looking at monarchs and government but
[1:02:10] we want to look at another Throne which
[1:02:12] is established in the heart of men right
[1:02:14] and we just only want to use a natural
[1:02:16] Throne to set a foundation for what we
[1:02:20] want to talk about right us has a uh the
[1:02:23] the president has Air Force One I think
[1:02:25] we all know about Air Force One Air
[1:02:27] Force One is termed as a moving over
[1:02:29] office flying over office the president
[1:02:32] can do many things is so equipped
[1:02:34] president has got high speed internet he
[1:02:36] can have conferences in fact they have a
[1:02:38] live Kitchen in Air Force One they don't
[1:02:40] store frozen food but they have H chefs
[1:02:44] and Cooks who cook life two big kitchens
[1:02:47] and they cook live meal and one thing I
[1:02:49] learn about Air Force One is that Air
[1:02:51] Force One is not Air Force One until the
[1:02:53] president sit in fos
[1:02:57] one if politicians have this Revelation
[1:03:00] that fos one is not regardless of its
[1:03:03] sophistication and Splendor is not
[1:03:05] really EOS one but the moment the
[1:03:07] president set in the Eos one then it
[1:03:09] becomes EOS one how about you and I your
[1:03:13] heart is a throne but your throne is not
[1:03:16] a throne unto the Lord Jesus Christ sit
[1:03:19] in the heart of your throne Glory
[1:03:21] hallelujah amen amen the Lord is
[1:03:25] good glory praise the
[1:03:31] Lord amen the Lord is good so that is
[1:03:35] efor one and that is God we've got a
[1:03:38] better efor one amen you are the OS one
[1:03:42] you are the moving mobile feet of the
[1:03:44] Lord Jesus Christ amen OS one has got
[1:03:47] limitation is God is so powerful they
[1:03:49] said they can fuel it even in midair I
[1:03:51] don't know how they do it and it was I
[1:03:54] read one document said that when
[1:03:56] President um what's the name Kennedy was
[1:03:59] assassinated Lyndon Johnson I think the
[1:04:01] vice president was swanning in Air Force
[1:04:03] One when they were taking the body of
[1:04:04] Kennedy to I think Dallas in front of
[1:04:07] his wife jacn Kennedy so even EOS one
[1:04:10] can swear in a new president in
[1:04:13] emergency situation in your heart when
[1:04:16] there's an emergency sometime you don't
[1:04:18] have to pray come on because the throne
[1:04:21] is in Your Heart Right the King of Kings
[1:04:23] is your heart Hallelujah greater than
[1:04:25] the president of United States is in
[1:04:27] your heart and your thought is not your
[1:04:29] thought it's the thought of om poent
[1:04:32] Glory Hallelujah Glory let's go to uh
[1:04:35] the next
[1:04:36] slide a throne room in the house or in
[1:04:39] the Kingdom we want to lay a background
[1:04:41] in the Old Testament how they talk about
[1:04:43] Throne the Lord promis a throne so we
[1:04:45] want to read Samuel 2 Samuel verse 7 and
[1:04:48] 13 He Shall build a house for my name
[1:04:52] and I will establish the Throne of his
[1:04:53] kingdom forever talking about David and
[1:04:55] the lord always used natural things to
[1:04:57] type the scure Luke 1: 32- 33 he said
[1:05:02] he'll be great and he'll be called the
[1:05:04] son of the most high the Lord God will
[1:05:06] give him the Throne of his father David
[1:05:08] and he will reign over the house of
[1:05:10] Jacob forever his kingdom will never end
[1:05:12] the kingdom of natural David ended but
[1:05:15] the Lord was using it to type something
[1:05:17] and when you talk about types and Shadow
[1:05:18] when the Lord is doing something right
[1:05:20] now is a present word of God but
[1:05:23] tomorrow when he begins to do another
[1:05:25] thing it becomes a type let me use a
[1:05:28] scripture to explain in the Bible it
[1:05:29] said out of Israel I have called my son
[1:05:33] it's one scripture when the Lord was
[1:05:35] calling the son of children of Israel
[1:05:37] from Egypt to the promised land and we
[1:05:40] know Jacob was C from Sons of Jacob were
[1:05:42] C from Egypt to Israel and also we know
[1:05:44] the Lord Jesus Christ when he was born
[1:05:46] and is Herod wanted to kill him they
[1:05:48] have to take Mary and Joseph take him to
[1:05:50] Africa Egypt is in Africa to hide him
[1:05:52] over there which is the South
[1:05:54] and then the Lord call Jesus Christ to
[1:05:57] start his ministry and the same
[1:06:00] scripture has been fulfilled twice but
[1:06:02] now the Lord is calling us from Egypt
[1:06:04] onto into the promised land it's not a
[1:06:07] country Egypt in Africa but Egypt is a
[1:06:10] condition of the world is the cosmos
[1:06:12] world is the nature of your heart right
[1:06:15] it is the wrong King sitting in your
[1:06:16] heart right and the Lord is trying to
[1:06:18] take that King out of your heart amen
[1:06:20] and establish the Lord Jesus Christ in
[1:06:22] your heart yes sir the promised land
[1:06:25] amen so God want to establish a kingdom
[1:06:28] which last eternally because the Holy
[1:06:31] Spirit doesn't die amen even if the
[1:06:33] flesh dissolve as I think Paul said in
[1:06:36] second 2 Corinthians chapter 5 he said
[1:06:38] when this Earthly Tabernacle is dissolve
[1:06:40] we have another Tabernacle not made with
[1:06:43] hands but Eternal in the heaven and that
[1:06:46] is eternal amen so when the Holy Ghost
[1:06:49] is established in your heart it's
[1:06:50] forever and ever nothing can take the
[1:06:52] holy ghost out of your heart amen they
[1:06:54] can they can skin you alive they can
[1:06:57] boil you in in in oil they can behead
[1:07:00] you but the pill of fire in you cannot
[1:07:02] be beheaded amen so that is the kingdom
[1:07:04] we talking about let's go to the next
[1:07:07] scripture and let's see how this uh
[1:07:09] Kingdom the throne begin to be
[1:07:11] established in the heart of men you want
[1:07:13] to read act chapter 8 1 acts 1
[1:07:17] 18-4 he said but ye shall receive power
[1:07:19] after that the Holy Ghost is come upon
[1:07:21] you and you shall be Witnesses unto me
[1:07:23] both in Jerusalem and in Judea and in
[1:07:26] Samaria and onto the utmost part of the
[1:07:30] earth and I want us to analyze this
[1:07:32] scripture so the kingdom of God began in
[1:07:34] the East which is Jerusalem Israel the
[1:07:37] Lord started calling it calling Peter
[1:07:39] James John and so on disciples Mary
[1:07:42] Martha to establish a kingdom and now he
[1:07:45] said this gospel that began in Jerusalem
[1:07:47] is not going to end here but it's going
[1:07:49] to go to the atos the the the the fs the
[1:07:52] Fest you can think about that's right so
[1:07:54] I I'm not a person that look at
[1:07:56] scripture historically the history is
[1:07:58] just a background so what is the
[1:08:00] uttermost part of the earth west P Beach
[1:08:02] Florida US Africa Asia Europe and we can
[1:08:07] put names on it jdda h Solomon
[1:08:12] Johnson Sister Sister Johnson that is
[1:08:14] the uttermost part of the earth that you
[1:08:17] are part of the earth that was taken you
[1:08:19] are the tiniest part of the Earth but
[1:08:22] God is establishing his Kingdom in you
[1:08:25] the gospel is in your heart a so the
[1:08:27] gospel moved from H Peter when the day
[1:08:29] of Pentecost came to you my sister to
[1:08:31] you my brother glory amen and nothing
[1:08:34] could stop it amen nothing could stop
[1:08:37] what God determines to do Hallelujah so
[1:08:39] let's look at act
[1:08:41] 2:1-4 let me read verse 9 and verse 9
[1:08:44] sorry act chapter 1
[1:08:47] 18-14 let me read the N verse and when
[1:08:50] he had spoken these things while they
[1:08:52] beheld he was taken up and Cloud receive
[1:08:54] him out of their sight so that was the
[1:08:56] kingdom of God which was taken to the
[1:08:59] Celestia when Jesus came to finish one
[1:09:02] dispensation that is dispensation of son
[1:09:04] of man he completed it on Calvary and
[1:09:06] then the thean the Eternal being the
[1:09:09] flesh went back to the cosmos the flesh
[1:09:11] didn't go to Glory you not taking
[1:09:13] nothing of this flesh to the Celestia
[1:09:15] the Celestia can dwell in this flesh but
[1:09:17] the second dimension cannot go to the
[1:09:19] Celestia so Jesus has to drop his flesh
[1:09:22] and then the Celestia King of Kings the
[1:09:25] thean the Lord Almighty kedc sit on Sat
[1:09:28] on his throne but then he promised that
[1:09:30] he will come back and establish his
[1:09:32] throne in the hearts of men whilst he
[1:09:35] was on Earth he said that the son of man
[1:09:37] does not have a place to lay his head
[1:09:39] but bears and and foxes have got hes and
[1:09:42] nest what is he talking about he was
[1:09:44] sleeping in house he was sleeping in
[1:09:46] Joseph's house Peter's house but the
[1:09:48] house he was talking about is the throne
[1:09:50] room of your heart cuz until that time
[1:09:53] since the the fall of Adam even among
[1:09:55] the prophet none of them were born again
[1:09:57] all right and God cannot completely use
[1:10:00] a vessel that is not born again amen
[1:10:02] that's why in the Old Testament some of
[1:10:03] them did what they did right David was a
[1:10:05] man after God's Own heart but the Holy
[1:10:08] Ghost could anoint David and use him to
[1:10:10] prophesy to sing to do inspiral things
[1:10:13] but because the King of Kings didn't
[1:10:15] live eternally in him David could still
[1:10:17] do what he do he could go and take
[1:10:19] somebody's wife and kill the person on
[1:10:21] top of it but when the Holy Ghost come
[1:10:23] into you the New Testament Covenant
[1:10:26] which is the greater than the Old
[1:10:27] Testament the Holy Ghost In Your Heart
[1:10:30] the Lord Jesus Christ in your heart will
[1:10:32] not let you uh commit adultery with
[1:10:34] someone and kill the husband on top of
[1:10:36] it because there's greater than David in
[1:10:38] your heart Glory hallelujah amen because
[1:10:42] you got a control tower the King of
[1:10:44] Kings is in your house and the king of
[1:10:46] King in your house will not permit you
[1:10:48] to do certain
[1:10:49] things Glory Hallelujah blessed be the
[1:10:52] name of the Lord so act CH 2:s 1-4 he
[1:10:55] said and when the day of Pentecost was
[1:10:57] fully come they were all with one Accord
[1:10:59] in one place and suddenly there came a
[1:11:02] sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty
[1:11:04] Wind and it filled all the house where
[1:11:06] they were sitting three and there and
[1:11:10] there appeared unto them clothing
[1:11:11] tongues like like as of fire and it sat
[1:11:14] upon each each of them it was not a
[1:11:16] physical tongue but is a pill of fire
[1:11:18] dividing himself among his disciples and
[1:11:21] verse four and they were all filled with
[1:11:23] the Holy Ghost and began to speak with
[1:11:25] other tongues as the spirit gave them
[1:11:27] utterance when the Holy Ghost comes into
[1:11:29] your heart your language becomes
[1:11:31] Heavenly it doesn't matter how much you
[1:11:33] cast and and fight the nature changes
[1:11:37] the Holy Spirit changes your nature
[1:11:39] because your heart has become the throne
[1:11:41] room of the Lord Jesus Christ and your
[1:11:44] word your language has changed not the
[1:11:45] English language not Spanish but the
[1:11:48] language is the Heavenly language it's
[1:11:50] the deity of Jesus Christ it's your
[1:11:53] nature
[1:11:54] it's your outlook in life it's how you
[1:11:56] perceive things it's your goals and
[1:11:58] Ambitions and your aims everything in
[1:12:00] you and around you changes in fact you
[1:12:03] become a new Creator when you are born
[1:12:05] again that's why the Bible said ye must
[1:12:07] be born again though you could see the
[1:12:09] same the same brother Mark the same
[1:12:12] brother Solomon but the holy spirit in
[1:12:14] you has recreated your body even the
[1:12:17] atoms of your body is changed the person
[1:12:19] can look at the same old sister the same
[1:12:21] old brother but the Lord Almighty sees
[1:12:23] you as a new person because he himself
[1:12:26] is living in you glory to the Lord of
[1:12:29] Lord blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:12:32] let's go to the next slide which I think
[1:12:34] I've read already let's go to the next
[1:12:37] Throne the throne in the throne in your
[1:12:40] room which is Christ in your heart so
[1:12:42] the throne as we talking about political
[1:12:44] Thrones uh monarchs like Queen of
[1:12:47] England King Charles those Thrones are
[1:12:49] temporal Thrones those Thrones began and
[1:12:52] they end but there's another Throne
[1:12:54] another kingdom which has no beginning
[1:12:56] and has no end and that kingdom is the
[1:12:58] holy spirit baptism is the kingdom of
[1:13:01] eternal life that you have no beginning
[1:13:04] and you have no end though your flesh
[1:13:06] began in your your father's laws and
[1:13:08] your mother's womb but the SE Gem of
[1:13:10] Life the eternal life in you is eternal
[1:13:14] it just keep on rolling through time and
[1:13:16] through eternity and when you talk about
[1:13:18] Time and Eternity sometime we look at it
[1:13:20] as opposite however time is part of
[1:13:23] eternity amen God allowed time time is
[1:13:26] slowing a slow version of Eternity if I
[1:13:29] should put it so cuz the Lord want to
[1:13:31] manifest there's Eternal things around
[1:13:32] here there are angels around here there
[1:13:35] are lot of celestial beings around here
[1:13:37] but this eyes cannot see them because
[1:13:39] they are moving in a higher frequency
[1:13:42] way higher than your little eyes can
[1:13:43] detect so how does the Lord do the Lord
[1:13:46] slows down eternity into time to
[1:13:48] manifest eternal life in our midst to
[1:13:51] manifest love to manifest Pati to
[1:13:54] manifest Faith to manifest H brotherly
[1:13:57] kindness to manifest all the attribute
[1:13:59] to manifest the spoken word in your life
[1:14:01] to manifest healing in your life so Time
[1:14:04] and Eternity time is expression of
[1:14:07] Eternity amen yes if the Lord like I use
[1:14:10] electricity for example if we have I
[1:14:13] don't know the the high voltage power
[1:14:15] 10,000 volt if you plug yourself phone
[1:14:17] plug your stove plug your whatever
[1:14:20] charger you're going to be blown to
[1:14:21] Pieces so now they say same 10,000 vote
[1:14:24] could be slowed down steep down into 120
[1:14:28] 220 or whatever amount so that you can
[1:14:31] use it comfortably without getting hurt
[1:14:33] the Lord can appear in a form that every
[1:14:36] one of us will die that's right he can
[1:14:39] appear in a form that you collapse right
[1:14:42] but knowing that you can't take that
[1:14:43] form he breaks himself down in
[1:14:45] ministries amen he breaks himself down
[1:14:48] in the form of the holy spirit in your
[1:14:49] heart that you can pray and he can hear
[1:14:52] you from your own heart
[1:14:54] if you can manifest in the celestial
[1:14:56] form as an angel of the Lord before you
[1:14:58] you might run away you might think it's
[1:15:00] going to harm you God but he can stay in
[1:15:02] your heart and he can listen to your
[1:15:05] prayers protect you when you are
[1:15:06] sleeping prevent you from vehical
[1:15:09] accident protect your family without you
[1:15:12] dying without you being getting hurt so
[1:15:15] he knows your form and your makeup and
[1:15:17] he deals with you according to the way
[1:15:18] he has called and moed you glory to the
[1:15:21] Living God so let's read act 2: 36-
[1:15:26] 37 therefore let all the house of Israel
[1:15:29] and you are the house of Israel don't
[1:15:30] look up 2000 years ago you are the house
[1:15:32] of Israel you are a modern day Israel am
[1:15:36] let me take brother Braham when the SE
[1:15:37] were open he said Jerusalem was I think
[1:15:42] was Jeffersonville or Phoenix one of
[1:15:45] them and Jericho was H which is Tuan
[1:15:50] right he switch and one some of the
[1:15:51] brothers were saying that they went to
[1:15:53] with Abraham and he said look at the
[1:15:55] mountains in Arizona said look at the
[1:15:58] Rocks said the same rock that you see is
[1:16:01] the same rock that Moses
[1:16:03] saw how can you take rocks from Israel
[1:16:07] and plant them in
[1:16:09] Arizona a Son of God a daughter of God
[1:16:12] has got a supernatural power if you can
[1:16:15] let ourself go and let God take control
[1:16:18] the same spoken word is in
[1:16:20] you you can change situation you can
[1:16:23] speak cancer out of existence you can
[1:16:26] speak healing into existence you can
[1:16:28] speak your wayward children back into
[1:16:30] eternal life you can speak situation out
[1:16:33] of which is out of control under your
[1:16:35] control because the King of Kings is
[1:16:37] living in your
[1:16:39] heart you can bring Israel you are the
[1:16:41] real Israel Israel now fighting over

[1:16:57] Abraham God didn't establish Israel on
[1:17:01] basis of tribes he established Israel on

[1:17:21] sometime we don't know who we are all
[1:17:22] right sister gave a testimony said
[1:17:24] brother one time I was working I saw a
[1:17:25] Jew Jewish woman and because she was
[1:17:27] Jewish you know we love them and he said
[1:17:30] Shalom of course they know Shalom and he
[1:17:32] started talking about the word he said
[1:17:33] she was like lost she didn't know what I
[1:17:35] was talking about I said sister we don't
[1:17:37] know who we are you are the real
[1:17:39] Israel you are taking your power to them
[1:17:42] they don't even know there after they
[1:17:43] are money right and their power and and
[1:17:46] and their land but you we are not
[1:17:48] fighting over this land no the land that
[1:17:51] God fought over is your flesh
[1:17:54] he doesn't care about all the big I
[1:17:56] don't know how many acres of land in
[1:17:58] West Palm Beach in us God doesn't care
[1:18:00] about it but the little land called
[1:18:02] sister Tina all right sister C sister B
[1:18:07] that is the land that is talking about
[1:18:09] that's the land he elected out of all

[1:18:13] can take all the land give me brother
[1:18:15] Johnson give me Brother D that is what I
[1:18:18] want amen Glory Hallelujah to the Lord I
[1:18:23] don't want to go go ahead of my but but
[1:18:25] let me explain this talk about I read
[1:18:28] that quote he said God want your heart
[1:18:30] God is not selfish he want to Jo he want
[1:18:33] to share you with with himself right is
[1:18:35] that you can take all the parts of your
[1:18:37] body just give him your
[1:18:39] heart take it this way let's say a
[1:18:41] little child let's say brother Joe want
[1:18:43] to drive and his father knowing that no
[1:18:45] he is's going to cause himself a wreck
[1:18:48] but no that I want to be part of you

[1:18:57] steering wheel you are in control when
[1:19:00] God gets your heart is's going to throw
[1:19:02] off every being of you that's why he's
[1:19:05] not asking for your head your intellect
[1:19:06] keep your intellect by your
[1:19:09] heart not your organ biological heart
[1:19:12] but your faith this is the center of you
[1:19:15] and if you give the center of you he's
[1:19:16] in charge of all your life he will turn
[1:19:19] what is in your mind he will just delete
[1:19:20] them away all the trash in the mind your
[1:19:23] selfish motives it will dissipate and he
[1:19:25] will take control by your own flesh
[1:19:27] that's why he said give me your heart my
[1:19:29] heart unto you God doesn't want your
[1:19:31] money he doesn't want your strength give
[1:19:34] him your heart gory and when he takes
[1:19:36] over your heart he's taking over you and

[1:19:51] made the same Jesus whom you crucify
[1:19:53] both Lord and Christ now when they heard
[1:19:55] this they were pricked in their heart
[1:19:57] and said unto Peter and to the rest of

[1:22:55] life and you have missed that portion of
[1:22:57] Eternity for you in particular that's
[1:22:59] right that's what philli was called the
[1:23:02] Holy Spirit told Philip to go because
[1:23:04] God knew he has a city in Ethiopia the
[1:23:05] Ethiopian un he was reading the book of
[1:23:07] Isaiah but he was like a denomination
[1:23:10] thinker he knew the father is God he
[1:23:12] knew this one is God he didn't have the
[1:23:14] Revelation but there was something
[1:23:16] burning in his heart because he was the
[1:23:18] seed of God look at how much God loves
[1:23:21] you that he will send somebody in your
[1:23:24] way just for you particularly in those
[1:23:28] time they didn't have many churches like
[1:23:31] we have now come on brother unlike you
[1:23:33] have a pastor you have ministers you
[1:23:35] have Deens you have mothers you have
[1:23:37] sisters so the Lord called Phillip say
[1:23:40] hey Phillip this man was rich he didn't
[1:23:43] have money with problem he didn't have
[1:23:44] problem with money he was in charge of
[1:23:46] the treasury those time they were not
[1:23:47] using dollar bills dollar bills doesn't
[1:23:49] have a value if you take $1 I think it
[1:23:51] values at 6 60
[1:23:53] wow so it does not even value the $1 but
[1:23:55] they had gold and diamonds and rubies
[1:23:57] and and
[1:23:59] treasures very important minerals but
[1:24:02] this man there was something Laing in
[1:24:03] his heart the king of kings was not
[1:24:07] sitting in his heart and he goes to
[1:24:09] Jerusalem to worship but he wasn't
[1:24:11] satisfied wow so the Lord sent Philip in
[1:24:13] his way go speak the word to him wow and
[1:24:16] Philip went specifically said you do you
[1:24:18] understand he was sitting in his Chariot
[1:24:20] take it like somebody sitting in his
[1:24:22] limine or mercedesbenz and Laz reading
[1:24:25] his Bible with all his Entourage around
[1:24:29] him and this man Philip didn't have a
[1:24:31] car he just went like just a wayward
[1:24:33] person he wasn't maybe nicely dressed he
[1:24:35] was in his robe and say budy do you
[1:24:38] understand what you're reading said no I
[1:24:39] don't understand how can I understand
[1:24:40] when unless somebody teach me unless a
[1:24:43] Preacher Man all right unless someone
[1:24:46] sitting around a throne Glory there's
[1:24:49] one throne but the Lord has got 24 seats
[1:24:51] 12 seats
[1:24:53] Matthew James
[1:24:55] John Judah Simon Joseph the thr guys
[1:24:59] they were the immediate they have the
[1:25:01] access to the Throne all right all right
[1:25:04] and they are the one that can give you
[1:25:07] tell you about the throne amen so God
[1:25:09] called you remember Philip he didn't
[1:25:11] even understand the throne himself he
[1:25:13] said Lord show us the father and that
[1:25:15] will suffice us he didn't understand it
[1:25:18] and the Lord said Philip I've been here
[1:25:19] with you and you still don't know who I
[1:25:21] am if you see me you have seen the
[1:25:23] father amen and the Lord want you to be
[1:25:25] the same that if you see me sister so
[1:25:27] and so you've seen my father that lives
[1:25:29] in
[1:25:30] me it is not farfetch to say that if you
[1:25:33] have Christ on the inside of you
[1:25:36] remember the policeman in England when
[1:25:38] the press in US wanted to find out the
[1:25:39] Wast
[1:25:40] Revival they saw him and they said we
[1:25:43] want to we are here we are from America
[1:25:44] we want to find out what is this Wast
[1:25:45] Revival he so you have arrived amen I am
[1:25:48] the W Revival he didn't say John Wesley
[1:25:51] he said I am it didn't say Wesley say I
[1:25:53] am it didn't say Jesus Christ I am the
[1:25:56] Wy revival can you say that I am the
[1:25:58] Revival of Jesus
[1:26:07] Christ thank you
[1:26:11] Jesus you are the Revival amen that is
[1:26:14] going on in West Palm Beach you are the
[1:26:16] Revival in your home you are the Revival
[1:26:18] in your work you are the Lord Jesus
[1:26:20] Christ to your family you are the Lord
[1:26:22] Jesus Christ to your church to your
[1:26:24] neighbors to all all around you the Lord
[1:26:27] put you in a particular place just to
[1:26:29] show his glory maybe in your workplace
[1:26:32] you are there to work for money take
[1:26:33] care of your family but there's a seed
[1:26:35] of God there that the Lord connect you
[1:26:37] to that person that he sees Christ in
[1:26:40] you amen Glory Hallelujah and the Lord
[1:26:44] can bring anybody across your way just
[1:26:46] to show you the way of the Lord and when
[1:26:48] they finish they gone the Lord moved
[1:26:51] them to their next station but the word
[1:26:53] the word that he preach will stay with
[1:26:54] you forever more one time a brother
[1:26:57] asked me do you know this Minister I
[1:26:58] said yes he preached I think two sermons
[1:27:00] my pastor invited him to preach and one
[1:27:03] of the sermons stuck with me he used
[1:27:05] Moses the pattern of the Heavenly Throne
[1:27:08] how Moses to build a house Tabernacle do
[1:27:11] the same thing and he tap it with a new
[1:27:13] birth and I said that someone would
[1:27:14] never I'll never forget that someon amen
[1:27:16] there's a brother that that used to talk
[1:27:18] about his wife his wife was and brother
[1:27:21] per Green in Arizona and the brother he
[1:27:25] I mean openly said he said my wife
[1:27:27] character is not like me his character
[1:27:28] is not up to par but his wife is a woman
[1:27:31] of character so my wife is a virtuous
[1:27:33] woman she was trained she was she grew
[1:27:36] up under perin Ministry and always you
[1:27:39] tell the brothers I never heard his wife
[1:27:41] talking about herself but her character
[1:27:44] her husband will even confess that yes
[1:27:46] my character is not up to standard but
[1:27:48] my wife has got a
[1:27:50] character because where she listened to
[1:27:52] what perine taught her perine is pass
[1:27:55] and gone but the character that she
[1:27:56] receive is still with her she moved to
[1:27:59] another state under her marriage but her
[1:28:01] character is being portrayed where you
[1:28:02] are you might be training brother Jack's
[1:28:04] Ministry but maybe you might be move
[1:28:06] somewhere that's right to K to college
[1:28:08] somewhere to to for job will move you
[1:28:11] somewhere marriage will move you
[1:28:12] somewhere ministry will move you
[1:28:14] somewhere but what you learn under the
[1:28:16] ministry glory you might not be in this
[1:28:18] Tabernacle you might not be in West pal
[1:28:19] Beach but the word of the Lord the of
[1:28:22] Jesus Christ will stay with you my
[1:28:24] sister my brother the rest of your
[1:28:27] life so when you come to the word house
[1:28:29] of the Lord make sure you capture
[1:28:31] everything that being preached to you
[1:28:32] because that is molding your character
[1:28:34] that is changing your nature amen amen
[1:28:37] Glory Hallelujah to the Lord so let's go
[1:28:40] to uh the next
[1:28:42] slide we want to read about how this
[1:28:45] Earthly kingdom was typed when Isaiah
[1:28:48] saw this heavenly Kingdom and so that
[1:28:50] you understand what kind of kingdom is
[1:28:52] is in your heart or what kind of Kingdom
[1:28:53] you should desire in your heart Isaiah
[1:28:56] 6:
[1:28:57] 1-9 verse one in the year that King uzia
[1:29:00] died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a
[1:29:03] throne so the New Testament the throne
[1:29:05] didn't begin the New Testament way in
[1:29:07] the Old Testament they had throne but
[1:29:09] let's see high and lifted up and his
[1:29:12] train filled the temple above it stood
[1:29:15] The Sims each one had six wings with
[1:29:18] twin he covered his face with twin we
[1:29:20] covered his feet with twin he did fly
[1:29:23] three and one cried onto another and
[1:29:25] said holy holy is the Lord the Lord of
[1:29:28] hosts the whole earth is full of his
[1:29:30] glory and the post of the door moved at
[1:29:32] the voice of him that cried and the
[1:29:34] house was filled with smoke the smoke
[1:29:36] was the glory of the Lord then said I
[1:29:38] whoo is me when you come before the
[1:29:40] throne you see how incompetent you are
[1:29:43] you are not competent you are not
[1:29:44] qualified you see who you are for I am
[1:29:47] undone because I'm a man of unclean lips
[1:29:49] and I dwell in the midst of people of
[1:29:51] unclean lips for my eyes have seen the
[1:29:53] king the Lord of hosts then flew one of
[1:29:56] the Sims who are The Sims the preacher
[1:29:58] men then flew one of the Sims unto me
[1:30:01] having a life coal in his hand which had
[1:30:04] which he had taken with the tongues of
[1:30:05] the altar how did they get the tong is
[1:30:08] the word that the lord gave to the
[1:30:10] preachers to give it to you recently
[1:30:12] sister Tatiana said I sent brother
[1:30:14] Jack's message he said brotheru this a
[1:30:16] Now message it's a life call it's not a
[1:30:19] dead call it's not a it's not a call
[1:30:22] doesn't have fire but he could see fire
[1:30:24] he said this is a Now message the Lord
[1:30:26] send he doesn't send you a bygone
[1:30:28] message no byone message will not help
[1:30:29] you but he send you a present day
[1:30:31] message that has got a quickening power
[1:30:34] in your life amen GL and he laid it upon
[1:30:37] my mouth and he said Lo this has touched
[1:30:41] thy lips and thy iniquity is taken away
[1:30:43] and thy sin is pitched also I heard the
[1:30:46] voice of the Lord saying whom shall I
[1:30:48] send and who will go for us then s then
[1:30:51] said I here I am send me amen so before
[1:30:54] you can do anything for the Lord you got
[1:30:56] to be perched you got to have a live
[1:30:58] coal of fire you have to have the word
[1:31:01] coming from the Lord through the
[1:31:02] ministry through the Min the pastor to
[1:31:05] you to purge your heart to give you the
[1:31:06] Holy Ghost baptism to give you the new
[1:31:08] birth then you become a vessel worthy to
[1:31:11] work for the Lord then the Lord can send
[1:31:13] you to work for him to magnify his glory
[1:31:17] amen so that was the the the the pattern
[1:31:20] that was laid in heaven but in the Old
[1:31:22] Testament they had a type of the new
[1:31:25] birth because the lamp hadn't died they
[1:31:28] had lamps they have goats they had cows
[1:31:31] Turtle does but they were all typing one
[1:31:34] man the Lord Jesus Christ who come to
[1:31:36] this Earth To Die For You amen so when
[1:31:38] he came on Cav and died then the life
[1:31:41] the fullness of Christ came upon the
[1:31:44] church what is the church not this
[1:31:45] concrete building you are the Church of
[1:31:47] the Living God came in your heart that
[1:31:50] is a life code the word of the Lord
[1:31:51] touching the map the lips of Isaiah is a
[1:31:54] type of the word of the Lord changing
[1:31:56] your heart consuming the old person and
[1:31:59] then the new person Christ Jesus is Born
[1:32:00] Into Your Heart let's go to uh the next
[1:32:03] slide 1 Peter 3 1:4 likewise he wives be
[1:32:08] in subjection to your own husbands that
[1:32:10] if any obey not the word they also May
[1:32:12] without the word be warn by the
[1:32:14] conversation of the wives while while
[1:32:17] they beheld your Chase conversation
[1:32:18] coupled with fear whose adorning let it
[1:32:21] not be the outward ading of plating of
[1:32:23] the hair of wearing of gold or of
[1:32:25] putting of on of apparel but let it be
[1:32:28] the hidden man of heart of the heart in
[1:32:30] that which is not corruptible even the
[1:32:32] ornament of Meek and quiet Spirit which
[1:32:35] is in the sight of God of great price
[1:32:38] amen and we are all women we all we all
[1:32:40] married to Jesus Christ right how many
[1:32:42] is married to how many Miss Jesus Christ
[1:32:44] are here so we are all women in that
[1:32:46] sense not only the sisters we are all
[1:32:49] female version the Lord is the male amen
[1:32:51] all right and the Lord doesn't want our
[1:32:53] outward appearance to be like gold and
[1:32:55] diamonds and the suit we wear they are
[1:32:57] good the dresses the the whatever you
[1:33:00] can call it yes sir those are good but
[1:33:02] that doesn't show the glory of the man
[1:33:04] the hidden man the glory of the Hidden
[1:33:07] man is the Lord Jesus Christ amen that's
[1:33:10] why when the children are coming up we
[1:33:11] should Tau them to receive the Holy
[1:33:13] Spirit we shouldn't teach them to to do

[1:33:18] their lives what are they doing their
[1:33:20] nails for to go get boyfriend to go get

[1:33:25] to watch out spread that we put upon our
[1:33:26] children cuz if a young lady is coming
[1:33:29] up and you start rewarding her with
[1:33:31] nails the N is go and on and on and on
[1:33:38] because her mom has done her nails she
[1:33:39] has done her nails what else the mom has

[1:33:43] boyfriend oh oh if if a young boy and
[1:33:47] he's got about he spent all the money on
[1:33:49] a on a on a a brand clothing H what's
[1:33:53] the name H Niki what's Nike Nike Nike
[1:33:58] Adidas puma and which one else help me
[1:34:01] out all the brand that you can talk
[1:34:04] about
[1:34:06] right that's right you don't play if you
[1:34:09] play basketball and you've got about
[1:34:11] let's say 20 Nike is Nike Nike Nike okay
[1:34:14] that's okay but don't play basketball
[1:34:16] you're not a professional basketball
[1:34:18] you've got about 20 30 n Nik lineup in
[1:34:21] your in your wardrobe and at least each
[1:34:23] each of them cost about
[1:34:27] $150 and you get broke somewhere in your
[1:34:29] life and you wonder why you are
[1:34:31] poor and you blame somebody else for
[1:34:34] being po
[1:34:35] poor while some people are learn
[1:34:37] teaching their children how to uh do
[1:34:39] stocks and buy uh buy buy buy houses buy
[1:34:43] homes and rent out and do Airbnb you are
[1:34:46] we are teaching our children how to buy
[1:34:48] all their brand cloth but we don't teach
[1:34:49] them how to make wealth
[1:34:53] am and we grow we grow poor broke we
[1:34:57] don't have money and we blame the
[1:34:59] government and we blame everybody else
[1:35:02] beside
[1:35:03] ourselves but when in the ha days when
[1:35:05] you had money you were throwing that
[1:35:07] money into something you are making a
[1:35:09] Nike is multi-billion
[1:35:11] company you are throwing your money into
[1:35:13] Nike into into what have you into nail
[1:35:16] polish I don't know how many times you
[1:35:18] go to and do your nails if you you pay
[1:35:20] $50 to for your daughter to do the nails
[1:35:22] every two weeks put that money in an
[1:35:25] investment in a college fund if your
[1:35:28] daughter is L say 12 years old the time
[1:35:30] she get to 20 at least she go
[1:35:34] 5,000 and if it's interest it will yield
[1:35:37] interest she can buy her first house
[1:35:39] when she's maybe 20 25 rent it out she
[1:35:42] doesn't have to leave dad and mom stay
[1:35:45] in your father's home until you get
[1:35:47] married but you are making wealth you
[1:35:50] are cutting the poverty out of your way
[1:35:53] you are moving into the wealthy area God
[1:35:55] is not angry when you are rich if you
[1:35:58] use it for the things of the Lord if you
[1:36:01] use it for ungodliness then that's an
[1:36:02] Abomination but if the Lord give you 1
[1:36:04] billion one trillion and you want to use
[1:36:06] it for the things of the Lord Glory
[1:36:08] Hallelujah to the
[1:36:10] Lord amen so God is not against you
[1:36:13] getting rich God is not against you
[1:36:15] being wealthy God is not against you
[1:36:17] buying houses God is not against you
[1:36:19] having business but what you do with it
[1:36:22] is what is is what makes a
[1:36:24] difference so we need to teach our
[1:36:26] children how to build wealth instead of
[1:36:28] throwing the money away because maybe
[1:36:30] now you have some job that is paying
[1:36:32] tomorrow that job may not be
[1:36:34] there you can lose your house maybe you
[1:36:36] have three houses but then if you invest
[1:36:38] in your children when they start college
[1:36:41] they have some
[1:36:42] money amen so let's do that instead of
[1:36:45] putting their money and let's teach them
[1:36:46] how to have the holy spirit amen instead
[1:36:48] of teaching them how to do nail polish
[1:36:50] and how to do sophisticated stuff
[1:36:52] because the spirit you put on your child
[1:36:54] that spirit will manifest in her amen
[1:36:57] the spirit you put on your son that
[1:36:58] spirit will manifest in your son so
[1:37:00] watch the spirit you put on your child
[1:37:02] rather teach them how to listen to the
[1:37:04] still silent voice of the Lord Jesus
[1:37:06] Christ how to build a throne ask them if
[1:37:08] they have the Holy Ghost ask them if
[1:37:10] they desire to have the Holy Ghost ask
[1:37:12] them about the sermon that brother Jack
[1:37:14] preach ask them about the about the
[1:37:16] about the tips that you listen right ask
[1:37:18] them Bible question don't spend all the
[1:37:20] time on computer games and and video
[1:37:23] games cuz those things get them insane
[1:37:26] that's right it makes them
[1:37:28] hyperactive and they are not stable and
[1:37:30] Al Al All Too Soon you're going to start
[1:37:32] giving them medication for depression
[1:37:34] and things like that I have a a neighbor
[1:37:37] daughter was put on 13 years old put on
[1:37:39] depr uh medication for depression and
[1:37:42] then she BEC suicidal so now the doctor
[1:37:45] said take all the knives and spoons and
[1:37:48] all the ceries out of your house wow so
[1:37:50] now it moved from one thing to another
[1:37:52] and you have big farmer will throw all
[1:37:54] the medication on you if you want
[1:37:55] because that's where the money comes
[1:37:56] from that's right brother I work in
[1:37:58] hospital one person takes 22 medication
[1:38:01] and they wanted to even add more
[1:38:02] medication to that person so if you want
[1:38:05] big farmer you want your money and if
[1:38:07] let him he throw medication on you
[1:38:09] that's right so watch what you eat watch
[1:38:12] your your your lifestyle am and exercise
[1:38:14] a little bit it will take away some
[1:38:16] medication out of your life or even
[1:38:18] prevent you from taking medication to
[1:38:19] begin with amen Glory Hallelujah to the
[1:38:23] Lord that's just for our benefit Glory
[1:38:26] Hallelujah to the
[1:38:31] Lord the Lord want us to be
[1:38:33] healthy walking is one of a very good
[1:38:35] exercise all right some of our elderly
[1:38:38] they can't run but you can walk in your
[1:38:39] home just keep the blood flowing it will
[1:38:42] take away a lot of a a lot of worry and
[1:38:45] Stress and Anxiety cuz those are the
[1:38:47] things that the enemy used to build
[1:38:49] cancer cells and things like that
[1:38:51] and certain food that we eat some of
[1:38:53] them are not healthy of course all the
[1:38:55] food is polluted I mean but at least you
[1:38:58] can get a more healthy version don't eat
[1:39:01] meat every seven days a week it's not
[1:39:04] good especially
[1:39:06] chicken when I stud about antibiotics I
[1:39:09] I got I was afraid even to touch chicken
[1:39:11] they put hormones antibiotics vitamins
[1:39:15] for the for the chicken or fou to grow
[1:39:17] within 3 weeks one
[1:39:19] month and they work like they are so big
[1:39:22] if you chase them they're going to
[1:39:24] die and when you eat that chicken what
[1:39:26] do you think that's to your body those
[1:39:28] chemicals it become resid chemicals in
[1:39:31] your body and all too soon the body
[1:39:33] begin to react to those chemicals it
[1:39:35] create cancer cells it creates our blood
[1:39:38] pressure our diabetes and all those
[1:39:40] sicknesses that we we we we get so if
[1:39:42] you modify your lifestyle don't eat at
[1:39:45] least at most eat meat four times a day
[1:39:48] not more than four times a day and the
[1:39:50] rest sorry four times yeah four times a
[1:39:52] day in the week and the rest of eat go
[1:39:55] something like mushroom if you like
[1:39:56] mushroom go other sorts of protein beans
[1:39:59] and and and and legum and things like
[1:40:02] that it will help your health cuz if you
[1:40:04] put in too much meat the kidney have to
[1:40:06] stress to break down those meat deliver
[1:40:09] overwork to break down those meat and
[1:40:12] once you are young you might not see the
[1:40:13] effect but when you get to certain age
[1:40:15] the organs are
[1:40:17] tired so now that you can do something
[1:40:19] about it do something about it God bless
[1:40:24] [Applause]
[1:40:29] you
[1:40:30] amen amen glory to
[1:40:34] God Glory Hallelujah let's go to the
[1:40:36] next slide glory amen so the new the new
[1:40:40] birth changes the heart into the throne
[1:40:42] room and the control tower and we want
[1:40:44] to just read a little quote the unity of
[1:40:46] one God in one Church
[1:40:49] 58122 21e
[1:40:51] paragraph 72 say how can how can he work
[1:40:54] with you when your nature when the
[1:40:56] nature of your of your spirit is of the
[1:40:58] devil is in there and every every man
[1:41:01] born on this Earth is born in sin Satan
[1:41:04] in your nature that's what sin is shap
[1:41:06] in iniquity come to the world speaking
[1:41:08] lies that's right so in that kinda
[1:41:11] adamic nature how can a man how can a
[1:41:13] man achieve anything only by through his
[1:41:16] int intellectuals that's impossible
[1:41:18] let's go to the next slide but when he
[1:41:22] comes to be a new Creator an old man has
[1:41:25] passed out passed out mean he's died
[1:41:27] he's consumed he's taken out of
[1:41:28] existence and the new man Christ takes
[1:41:31] his throne in the heart in the human
[1:41:33] heart then life looks different then he
[1:41:36] start on a new road from his own selfish
[1:41:38] motives to the big ideas to make himself
[1:41:42] something big or he start right towards
[1:41:44] Calvary to recognize God then then his
[1:41:47] all his objective his motive his
[1:41:49] achievement and all all that he is lays
[1:41:52] in the glory of the Cross where Christ
[1:41:54] paid the price for the human life Christ
[1:41:57] is our life amen let's go to the next
[1:42:00] Slide the throne room of Heaven now God
[1:42:03] used the throne room of Heaven in the
[1:42:06] celestial and then build exactly the
[1:42:08] same thing on earth so Revelation 44
[1:42:11] to11 I think I read just two two verses
[1:42:13] and round about The Throne where four
[1:42:15] and 20 seats and upon the seat I saw
[1:42:17] four and 20 Elders sitting clothed in
[1:42:20] white garment rment and they had on
[1:42:22] their heads crowns of gold and out of
[1:42:24] the throne proceeded Lightnings Thunders
[1:42:27] thunderings and voices and there were
[1:42:29] seven lamps seven lamps of fire burning
[1:42:31] Before the Throne which are the seven
[1:42:33] spirit of God Amen God one Throne the
[1:42:37] Lord Jesus Christ 24 Elders 24 Elders
[1:42:40] before you can understand the gospel you
[1:42:42] have to read Mark Matthew James Luke and
[1:42:46] then the book the letters of Paul those
[1:42:48] are the people that are around the
[1:42:50] throne the eldest
[1:42:51] and God has made you one of the elders
[1:42:53] around the throne you are wearing a
[1:42:55] white garment what's the white garment
[1:42:57] the Holy Spirit baptism purity of Christ
[1:43:00] and you have got a crown of gold what's
[1:43:01] the crown of gold not a physical gold
[1:43:04] but the glory of the Lord is seen in you
[1:43:06] that is the crown of gold God has put
[1:43:08] upon your head amen we are not going to
[1:43:11] wear natural gold the glory of God is
[1:43:13] more than the gold of s Africa or the
[1:43:15] god of anywhere but the God is talking
[1:43:17] about the natural language type the
[1:43:19] supernatural things the Lord is doing
[1:43:21] amen I remember Brother Joseph asked me
[1:43:23] a question one day when I came first and
[1:43:25] she was he was asking me said how did
[1:43:28] you know when you saw my mom at PBA how
[1:43:31] did you know the glory of the Lord was
[1:43:32] on her I said it's not something
[1:43:34] physical that I saw but it's
[1:43:36] supernatural right that the Lord led me
[1:43:38] to know that she's my sister right
[1:43:40] that's right so the glory of the Lord
[1:43:42] will shine on you even Sinners can
[1:43:44] identify the glory of the Lord in you
[1:43:48] sometime you don't have to talk but they
[1:43:49] can look at you and they can see that
[1:43:51] this sister is different this lady is
[1:43:53] different there's something Supernatural
[1:43:55] in and around you that is a cry the
[1:43:58] control tower the throne room in your
[1:43:59] heart Glory Hallelujah let's go to the
[1:44:03] next slide he said this sh this this
[1:44:06] sign shall follow the believer not
[1:44:08] negative thinkers not intellectual
[1:44:10] church members but born again believers
[1:44:12] who has come from the intellectual to
[1:44:14] the heart where God takes throne in his
[1:44:17] control room to control your emotions to
[1:44:20] control your faith to control your
[1:44:22] character God wants to fill you why does
[1:44:24] he want to fill you what does he want to
[1:44:27] fill you with he want to fill you with
[1:44:28] himself the holy spirit filled with with
[1:44:31] the Holy Spirit and then if you read the
[1:44:33] 91 going Jesus said you shall receive
[1:44:35] power after the Holy Ghost is come let's
[1:44:37] go to I think the last slide if I have
[1:44:39] it 15 slide and let's see how the Holy
[1:44:42] Ghost changes your
[1:44:43] character let's see if I have it
[1:44:46] here and I think I don't have that one
[1:44:48] here I missed that one yeah but that was
[1:44:51] Abraham he had a vision in the vision
[1:44:54] some people I think were they did
[1:44:56] something in his house so in the vision
[1:44:58] the young man was he pushed by Braham
[1:45:02] and he pushed him
[1:45:04] again
[1:45:09] okay you think you li
[1:45:11] [Music]
[1:45:15] somewhere yes thank you so much thank
[1:45:17] you brother Jack for catching it for me
[1:45:19] so this is the quote so this is a vision
[1:45:22] maybe I'm not going to read everything I
[1:45:23] want to paraphrase this and the person
[1:45:25] said the person got hostile and Sh him
[1:45:26] backwards that's the way you preaches so
[1:45:28] the person to begin with didn't like
[1:45:29] preachers so when he he saw brother
[1:45:31] Braham he pushed him and remember Braham
[1:45:33] was an old boxer the skills were not
[1:45:36] gone he said that there were certain
[1:45:39] things that when you get a new bir the
[1:45:40] Holy Ghost doesn't take it away from
[1:45:43] you brother brother Smiley strength is
[1:45:45] not taken away from you because he's the
[1:45:47] hly he's got the Holy Ghost because he's
[1:45:49] a preacher his strength is still
[1:45:52] there so God doesn't take everything
[1:45:54] from you because you got the Holy Ghost
[1:45:56] he still got the power prowess in your
[1:45:58] hands you can do certain things right
[1:46:00] but there's a control tower in you soah
[1:46:03] said I said okay I'm just going to tell
[1:46:04] him tell him that it doesn't know what
[1:46:07] he's talking about other words he's
[1:46:08] going to you know I mean Revenge you
[1:46:10] know because he push him a couple times
[1:46:13] and then a voice said do not do don't do
[1:46:16] that you are a minister and I said very
[1:46:20] well
[1:46:21] so because you a minister certain things
[1:46:22] you can
[1:46:24] do people can take advantage of you they
[1:46:27] can abuse you verbally even physically
[1:46:30] you've got a prowess you can push them
[1:46:32] down in a second but ra said that the
[1:46:34] power is not the size of the person but
[1:46:36] the power in him but there's something
[1:46:38] in you that will tell that no you a
[1:46:40] minister you Minister sons of Zion to my
[1:46:43] people you can't fight on the streets
[1:46:46] that is not you right amen and you're
[1:46:48] going to hold your peace amen
[1:46:52] sister somebody can abuse you on the job
[1:46:55] she can even smack you in the
[1:46:57] face and you can put this lady down
[1:47:00] within seconds but you are married to
[1:47:02] the Lord Jesus Christ and tell no don't
[1:47:05] Revenge leave her alone I'll take care
[1:47:08] of
[1:47:09] her that is the control
[1:47:11] tower because you are a minister of the
[1:47:14] Lord you can do certain things that is
[1:47:17] who you are and whatever you do that you
[1:47:19] do with anger doesn't please the
[1:47:22] Lord even brother B was was correcting
[1:47:25] his son and he was angry but watch him
[1:47:28] and said Billy you were mad when you
[1:47:29] were beating Paul he said yes said that
[1:47:32] didn't please his Angel even your
[1:47:34] children if you do with anger because
[1:47:36] your child did something if you are
[1:47:39] angry just stay away contain yourself
[1:47:41] pray and clear your heart because the
[1:47:44] whole thing is about correcting the son
[1:47:46] not slapping him and smacking him here
[1:47:47] and there so whatever you do with anger
[1:47:50] the moment you see your anger rising up
[1:47:52] back off back off some go pray even in
[1:47:57] marriage your spouse maybe your spouse
[1:47:59] says something very nasty your temper
[1:48:02] Rises don't respond go pray go outside
[1:48:05] the house go
[1:48:07] sing Go sing go pray for her go pray for
[1:48:10] him and then when the sweetness of
[1:48:12] Christ comes back then you can deal with
[1:48:14] the
[1:48:15] situation
[1:48:19] because because you're a minister you a
[1:48:22] minist you are sister minist unto the
[1:48:25] Lord you Minister unto the Lord the Lord
[1:48:28] has made you somebody
[1:48:30] special see how this Ethiopian you know
[1:48:32] and the Lord sent Phillip to go minister
[1:48:34] to to to him you are somebody in your
[1:48:37] job you might be a sister but your
[1:48:39] testimony is revealing Jesus Christ to
[1:48:41] the people how you going to fight with
[1:48:43] the same people you are ministering to
[1:48:45] they might abuse you your managers
[1:48:48] whoever they might gos about you but
[1:48:51] because you a minister of the Lord the
[1:48:53] Lord said do not do it do not seek
[1:48:56] revenge Revenge Belongs to the Lord pray
[1:48:58] for them you don't want even evil to to
[1:48:59] come upon them but you want the Lord to
[1:49:01] forgive them and transform them that's
[1:49:03] where they will know that oh you are
[1:49:05] very special you think they don't know
[1:49:07] what they did to you they know but they
[1:49:10] know they God is watching you God put
[1:49:12] you there to be abused to be harassed to
[1:49:15] be
[1:49:17] embarrassed sometime you don't have to
[1:49:18] say sorry because you are wrong
[1:49:20] Hallelujah you say sorry because you're
[1:49:23] a
[1:49:24] peacemaker because you want you don't
[1:49:26] want to be out of character am cuz the
[1:49:29] person has got a spirit on him or her
[1:49:31] and he trying to contaminate you that
[1:49:33] Spirit right so so I'm sorry bro I'm
[1:49:36] sorry sist you just let the peace of God
[1:49:38] take over because you Minister unto the
[1:49:41] Lord and when you get your heart
[1:49:42] contaminated now you're going to spend
[1:49:44] time to repent to pray because said the
[1:49:47] Holy Ghost is what is like a
[1:49:49] dve when you do something your heart
[1:49:51] your own heart will judge you he or
[1:49:53] she's a sinner he doesn't know what he's
[1:49:54] doing but you are the one who is the
[1:49:56] Minister of the Lord so if you go you
[1:49:59] revenge or you you do what he's doing
[1:50:02] then you're going to feel condemn in
[1:50:03] your heart and you're going to have to
[1:50:05] spend time to repent but if you show
[1:50:07] maturity of Christ that know I'm a

[1:50:29] you leave the place and pray for them
[1:50:31] let the Lord take control of that amen
[1:50:33] amen amen let's go back to I think uh
[1:50:38] the 10th
[1:50:39] slide yeah I think we finished that one
[1:50:41] right let's go to the next one we finish
[1:50:44] that one let's go to the next one okay
[1:50:46] yeah he said you see the little part
[1:50:49] compartment in a man's heart God made it
[1:50:52] there for himself that's his control
[1:50:55] tower he set there to control you that
[1:50:58] is his place that's where he sent his
[1:51:00] message from the control
[1:51:02] room that's why ministers wait on the
[1:51:05] Lord they pray they fast they wait on
[1:51:08] the Lord they steady so the Lord speak
[1:51:11] into their heart and then they can speak
[1:51:13] to the church they can't speak their
[1:51:16] mind they can't speak their intellect
[1:51:19] they have to to speak what the control
[1:51:21] tower the King on the control tower want
[1:51:24] them to speak amen that's why you need
[1:51:27] to pray for your
[1:51:28] ministers the next verse and now the
[1:51:30] reason that the little compartment that
[1:51:32] was in your heart God molded you that
[1:51:33] way that was for a purpose the little
[1:51:36] place in your heart all the rest of your
[1:51:38] body belong to to you he was about to
[1:51:40] say to him but he said to you right but
[1:51:44] that heart belongs to God he say God
[1:51:46] want to share your body with you take
[1:51:49] all the all the body just give him your
[1:51:51] heart when you give him your heart
[1:51:53] you've given him everything amen he
[1:51:55] could set in the control tower that he
[1:51:57] could guide you blessed be His holy name
[1:51:59] oh if you will let him be the pilot and
[1:52:02] the Holy Ghost the co-pilot you'll be
[1:52:04] gued over the sea of life it is control
[1:52:06] tower when sit situations arise don't
[1:52:10] like certain things don't use your human
[1:52:12] power don't use your prowess you've got
[1:52:14] the prowess you've got the intellect you
[1:52:15] can tell him your mind you can even your
[1:52:17] own life your health don't think about
[1:52:21] think about Christ why am I going
[1:52:23] through this situation there's a purpose
[1:52:25] for it go to prayer first before you go
[1:52:28] to the doctor before you speak to the
[1:52:31] doctor before you take medication pray
[1:52:33] first and when you pray the Lord will
[1:52:35] tell you what to do next so always put
[1:52:37] him first in everything before you buy a
[1:52:40] house before you move before you take a
[1:52:42] job whatever you do before you marry
[1:52:45] make sure the control tower is speaking
[1:52:47] to you amen amen because if you
[1:52:50] intertwine yourself in relationship
[1:52:52] marriage or whatever with the wrong
[1:52:54] person marriage you have the Christ on
[1:52:58] your control tower he or she has the
[1:53:00] Antichrist on his control
[1:53:03] tower do you think who
[1:53:07] suffers who's going to suffer is
[1:53:11] you right your wife can punch you make
[1:53:14] you a punching bag you cannot punch it
[1:53:17] your husband can make you a punching bag
[1:53:19] you don't even match his strength wow if
[1:53:22] he doesn't have the if you don't have
[1:53:23] the control tower that's why I said make
[1:53:26] sure whomever you intertwine in marriage
[1:53:29] he or she has got Christ on the seat of
[1:53:32] his or her heart else you are in for
[1:53:35] trouble amen that Antichrist it could be
[1:53:37] sweet in the beginning but
[1:53:39] Antichrist will come you just wait in
[1:53:42] the right
[1:53:43] time maybe he doesn't she doesn't even
[1:53:46] know she's not born again not because he
[1:53:48] attend a mage Church no come on brother
[1:53:52] not because he's a preacher no but you
[1:53:55] have to make sure that he or she has got
[1:53:59] the Lord Jesus Christ on his
[1:54:01] heart don't let M CH deceive you there
[1:54:05] are many people in the message they
[1:54:06] don't have Christ on their heart there
[1:54:08] are many people preaching the gospel
[1:54:09] they don't have Christ on their heart so
[1:54:12] you have to know what the control tower
[1:54:14] is you have to know whether President
[1:54:16] Biden is in F for one before you call it
[1:54:19] f for one

[1:54:34] yourself believer all right government
[1:54:37] will not exact tax from
[1:54:39] you but it's the person as God you don't
[1:54:42] pay tax by saying that I'm in the
[1:54:43] message but is the message in
[1:54:47] you amen am that's the L most test the L
[1:54:52] test is not being a m believer or being
[1:54:54] a Christian or being a har Krishna or
[1:54:57] being whoever the L more test is make
