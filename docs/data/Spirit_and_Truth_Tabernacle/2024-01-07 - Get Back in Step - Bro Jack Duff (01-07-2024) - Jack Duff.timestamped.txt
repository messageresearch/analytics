[59:39] Lord
[59:41] [Applause]
[59:42] amen um often times when we start the
[59:45] new year I just try to seek the mind of
[59:49] God for what he would have for us amen
[59:53] uh this year and last year just waiting
[59:56] on the Lord he was giving us a little
[59:58] thought on yielding uh to the perfect
[1:00:01] will of God and um uh we started out um
[1:00:06] with that theme amen and um this year
[1:00:11] just been feeling uh just a little
[1:00:14] thought in my spirit uh I will
[1:00:20] restore sayeth the
[1:00:22] Lord thank you Lord amen
[1:00:26] I will
[1:00:29] restore sayeth the
[1:00:32] Lord amen and so uh at the beginning of
[1:00:36] the year I will have a few sermons that
[1:00:39] will be uh around this theme and um this
[1:00:44] is somewhat of my inspiration we will
[1:00:47] use a different title uh today for our
[1:00:51] sermon but I do want to read a couple
[1:00:53] scriptures if I actually stand with me
[1:00:56] uh our title today will be get back in
[1:01:00] Step amen and get back in
[1:01:05] step and um I want to read from Joel
[1:01:09] chapter 1 and Joel chapter two since
[1:01:11] we're taking this
[1:01:13] inspiration of our will restore sayeth
[1:01:15] the Lord um oh my had the wrong
[1:01:20] scripture
[1:01:21] there um let me just get this really
[1:01:25] quick uh Joel 1
[1:01:28] and two it says this in Joel 1 verse4 it
[1:01:33] says that which the Palmer worm hath
[1:01:37] left hath the Locust eaten and that
[1:01:41] which the Locust hath left hath the
[1:01:44] cankerworm eaten and that which the
[1:01:48] cankerworm hath left hath the
[1:01:51] caterpillar eaten uh go to chapter two
[1:01:56] and uh we'll start at verse 23 in
[1:01:59] chapter
[1:02:01] two uh it
[1:02:04] says be glad then the children of Zion
[1:02:07] and rejoice in the Lord your God for
[1:02:10] Heath given you the former rain
[1:02:12] moderately and he will cause to come
[1:02:15] down for
[1:02:16] you uh the rain the former rain and the
[1:02:19] latter rain
[1:02:20] in the first month Lord let that
[1:02:26] be amen and the floors shall be full of
[1:02:32] Wheat and and the fats shall overflow
[1:02:36] with wine and
[1:02:38] oil and I will
[1:02:41] restore to you now this has
[1:02:45] become that's right it's personal you
[1:02:48] got to you got to act like God talking
[1:02:51] directly to you speaking to your
[1:02:55] situation speaking to your
[1:02:57] circumstance your neighbor may not be
[1:02:59] going through what you're going through
[1:03:01] but this is for you right and this is
[1:03:04] what it says it says I will restore to
[1:03:08] you the
[1:03:10] years that the Locust hath eaten the
[1:03:14] cankerworm and the caterpillar and the
[1:03:17] Palmer worm my great Army which I sent
[1:03:20] among you now there's so much in this
[1:03:22] and we ain't going to be able to get to
[1:03:24] it all today now the the Locust the
[1:03:29] caterpillar uh the the canker worm they
[1:03:32] were sent by God to do a very specific
[1:03:36] thing hello
[1:03:38] somebody but in the midst of being sent
[1:03:41] by God it allows God to fulfill another
[1:03:45] promise I will
[1:03:51] restore and then he says in verse 26 ye
[1:03:53] shall eat in
[1:03:55] plenty and be
[1:03:57] satisfied and praise the name of the
[1:04:00] Lord your God that have dealt wondrously
[1:04:03] with you and my people shall never be
[1:04:07] ashamed and ye shall know that I am in
[1:04:11] the midst of Israel and that I am the
[1:04:13] Lord your God and none else and my
[1:04:16] people shall never be ashamed repeated
[1:04:18] it twice now it says and it shall come
[1:04:21] to pass afterward that I will pour out
[1:04:24] of my spirit upon All Flesh and your
[1:04:28] sons and your daughters shall prophesy
[1:04:31] your old men shall dream dreams your
[1:04:33] young men shall see visions and also
[1:04:36] upon the servants and upon the handmaids
[1:04:38] uh in in those days will I pour out my
[1:04:41] spirit and I will show wonders in the
[1:04:44] heavens and in the earth blood and fire
[1:04:46] and pillars of smoke the sun shall be
[1:04:48] turned into darkness and the moon into
[1:04:50] blood before the great and terrible day
[1:04:52] of the Lord come and it shall come to
[1:04:54] pass pass that whosoever shall call on
[1:04:57] the name of the Lord shall be
[1:05:01] delivered for in Mount Zion and in
[1:05:05] Jerusalem shall be Deliverance as the
[1:05:08] Lord have said and in the remnant whom
[1:05:11] the Lord shall call let's just have a
[1:05:15] word of prayer amen over this father we

[1:05:50] the people it's in Jesus name we pray
[1:05:53] amen amen God bless you you can be
[1:05:55] seated again our uh subject amen today
[1:05:59] is get back in Step amen get back and
[1:06:04] step but to uh get us going amen uh in
[1:06:09] this I want to pick a quote out of the
[1:06:12] restoration of the brid tree and uh we
[1:06:16] will just kind of
[1:06:17] start from there uh um brother brandham
[1:06:23] as he preached a sermon restoration from
[1:06:25] the bride tree what we're going to find
[1:06:26] here is that he got his inspiration from
[1:06:30] a sermon that brother Neville had
[1:06:32] preached the morning before this was a
[1:06:34] Easter uh uh message that he preached
[1:06:37] but brother brother uh brother Neville
[1:06:39] had preached early that morning and at
[1:06:41] the end of his sermon he was making
[1:06:43] comments about restoration and brother
[1:06:44] brother Brandon went took that and uh
[1:06:47] and just kind of formed a sermon around
[1:06:49] it and preached the restoration of the
[1:06:50] Bri tree a three-hour sermon came from a
[1:06:53] note that got from Brother Neville amen
[1:06:55] it shows how he got inspiration from
[1:06:57] other people praise the Lord amen and he
[1:07:00] wasn't afraid to tell I got the
[1:07:02] inspiration from this other this other
[1:07:03] brother you know but but God gave him
[1:07:05] just a little bit more and as we as we
[1:07:07] get deeper in this we'll see some things
[1:07:09] but but here he uh he makes these
[1:07:10] statement says now after brother Neville
[1:07:13] preached this morning that notable
[1:07:17] message at the at the last thing he said
[1:07:20] on his last thoughts was to be restored
[1:07:24] to be restored and so that give me the
[1:07:27] idea right there to restore now I rushed
[1:07:30] home and got my dictionary and so forth
[1:07:33] and some scripture notes and begin to
[1:07:35] copy some things down and then I got
[1:07:38] Webster's Dictionary to find out uh find
[1:07:41] out the right definition for ReStore to
[1:07:44] restore means to return to the former
[1:07:49] owner blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:07:52] amen or to bring
[1:07:55] back uh to the former estate of
[1:07:58] condition amen this is what restoration
[1:08:01] when we take this inspiration we're
[1:08:03] looking for God to return some things to
[1:08:05] the former owner amen we're looking for
[1:08:09] things to return to their first state or
[1:08:12] condition their former state that
[1:08:14] something's got to come
[1:08:16] back ah hallelujah amen something's got
[1:08:21] to come back here he says and and we can
[1:08:24] and I like this and we can
[1:08:28] enforce a claim to be
[1:08:31] restored amen now that's what Webster
[1:08:35] says the word restore means to bring
[1:08:37] back to the former o owner or to bring
[1:08:40] back to a former state of condition and
[1:08:43] if a claim is made on something to make
[1:08:46] that restoration you can enforce
[1:08:52] it I like this to make it come back to
[1:08:56] its right place and may God bless these
[1:08:58] people wordss now he said you can
[1:09:00] enforce it so you know there there's
[1:09:02] things that uh that we'll be talking
[1:09:04] about amen over the next couple weeks
[1:09:06] how does this enforcement happen amen uh
[1:09:09] but I don't want to get ahead of myself
[1:09:10] so let me just keep reading it says to
[1:09:12] restore means to bring back or to
[1:09:15] restore a claim can be enforced now to
[1:09:17] bring anything back to its rightful
[1:09:20] owner where it belongs therefore some
[1:09:22] way it went away from amen it's rightful
[1:09:27] owner somehow the devil got involved and
[1:09:32] moved that thing away from its rightful
[1:09:34] owner I moved it out of its rightful
[1:09:37] position but God made a
[1:09:41] promise it's not my promise it's not
[1:09:45] your promise you didn't you didn't you
[1:09:47] didn't say these words God is the one
[1:09:49] that said these words and in God saying
[1:09:51] it we can expect God to fulfill
[1:09:54] what he
[1:09:55] said and I'm I'm here to tell you you
[1:09:57] don't have to feel it amen you ain't
[1:10:00] even got to believe it if you don't want
[1:10:02] to but God going to do it anyhow because
[1:10:05] he said it and he cannot
[1:10:09] lie Hallelujah he says somewhere went
[1:10:12] away from his rightful owner and and and
[1:10:15] and can wander around
[1:10:17] anywhere look at this now amen it says
[1:10:20] but to restore is to bring it back to
[1:10:23] who really owns it or to bring it back
[1:10:26] to its natural estate where it was at
[1:10:29] the first time bring it back into its
[1:10:31] natural condition and in order to do
[1:10:34] this we have a right to enforce if
[1:10:36] there's a law to enforce this rightful
[1:10:39] condition of restoration to restore I
[1:10:41] like it I like what the prophet is
[1:10:44] saying I I I'm I'm I'm going to enjoy
[1:10:47] this
[1:10:48] journey hallelujah look at this now he
[1:10:50] goes on to say this he says like if some
[1:10:53] somebody stole some property and they're
[1:10:56] holding the property
[1:10:59] captive ain't your children your
[1:11:02] property and there's a devil holding
[1:11:04] them
[1:11:06] captive then you can take the
[1:11:09] law oh my God and go to this person and
[1:11:15] the law enforces this person to restore
[1:11:19] this property back to his natural owner
[1:11:22] into his a prior our first estate
[1:11:24] enforcement oh what a text he says how I
[1:11:27] like to have two days on that enforce he
[1:11:30] says now brother brother never preach
[1:11:32] for us I'm just just going to talk to
[1:11:34] you teach a Sunday school lesson so I
[1:11:36] get uh I get to continue on I hope with
[1:11:39] what he had and I just like how the
[1:11:41] prophet did that he he he he picked up
[1:11:43] on the inspiration that brother Neville
[1:11:45] had and he just kind of carried it
[1:11:47] Forward Hallelujah and I'm gonna I'm
[1:11:49] going to set some things and I'm going
[1:11:51] challenge amen the ministers to try to
[1:11:53] catch this inspiration and Carry It
[1:11:55] Forward glory to God Amen as we just
[1:11:58] start out the year let's let's catch
[1:12:00] this inspiration of what the holy spirit
[1:12:02] is doing and let's kind of Bring It
[1:12:03] forth I I believe as we all enter into
[1:12:06] this channel God got something for
[1:12:12] us look at this now look at what he says
[1:12:14] he says inforce then we are we have the
[1:12:18] privilege to enforce upon Satan the
[1:12:21] claims that God give us
[1:12:24] he says for God he says for God has a
[1:12:26] law and his word is a law and God in
[1:12:29] this word made certain claims Amen to
[1:12:32] the church therefore we have a right to
[1:12:36] force these claims upon Satan and
[1:12:39] say oh my now now here's the thing
[1:12:43] here's the thing you just can't be quiet
[1:12:46] uh and expect the devil to give up you
[1:12:49] going to have to open up your mouth and
[1:12:52] you going to have to say something
[1:12:54] things and and when you speak it out of
[1:12:57] your mouth oh you got to understand
[1:12:59] there's a promise that already
[1:13:01] looms that God said he will restore but
[1:13:05] God wants you to be a part of the
[1:13:07] promise tell that
[1:13:09] devil give it
[1:13:13] back hey
[1:13:16] Hallelujah you done had it long enough
[1:13:19] now it's time for you to give it
[1:13:22] back praise God
[1:13:25] church amen amen the prophet tells us
[1:13:29] this now he says we have a right to
[1:13:32] force these claims upon Satan and say
[1:13:36] give it back and look at this he has to
[1:13:40] do it because we can take God's agent
[1:13:43] the Holy Spirit go right down on our
[1:13:45] knees and say it's thus sayth the Lord
[1:13:48] what's thus sayith the Lord the part
[1:13:50] that thus sayith the Lord is I will re
[1:13:55] restore Hallelujah he say not going to
[1:13:57] let you be made ashamed I will restore
[1:14:01] right said it's thus said Lord he's got
[1:14:03] to give it up that's all cuz the holy
[1:14:05] spirit's there to make him do it all you

[1:14:10] your mouth the Holy Ghost take care of
[1:14:11] the rest I like this and you know I had

[1:22:59] execute oh
[1:23:02] yes hallelujah
[1:23:04] hallelujah here you know I'm looking at
[1:23:07] this year and there's there's there's
[1:23:10] there's there's so much that I I believe
[1:23:12] we can be in expectation for as I Was
[1:23:15] preparing amen for uh uh you know just
[1:23:18] this first sermon of the year I thought
[1:23:20] about how brother Billy Paul was taken
[1:23:22] home amen October 23rd he was buried on
[1:23:25] October 23rd I'm he passed away before
[1:23:28] that but he was buried on that day uh
[1:23:31] and and a lot of people begin to
[1:23:33] wonderer at the
[1:23:35] passing uh since he was told by his
[1:23:38] daddy that sharks would be swimming
[1:23:40] where he was
[1:23:41] standing and this was after brother
[1:23:43] brandham had preached a a powerful
[1:23:45] sermon amen um choosing of a bride and
[1:23:50] there so much happened in that one ser
[1:23:52] sermon Lord knows I I feel like I'm not
[1:23:54] going to get through this sermon today
[1:23:57] but but there's so much happening in
[1:23:58] that one sermon you know all we get is
[1:24:00] the recording of the prophet and his
[1:24:02] sermon which that's that's really all we
[1:24:03] need but there were so many things
[1:24:05] happened before that one of the things
[1:24:07] that happened is brother Brandon Met
[1:24:08] prophesied to a sister um uh shakarian
[1:24:13] Florence sharan I think is her name he
[1:24:15] say hey thus said the Lord you're going
[1:24:17] to die sis God showed me that he going
[1:24:18] to take you off the scene you're going
[1:24:20] to die so you need to get your house in
[1:24:21] order now now most people don't want to
[1:24:23] hear prophecy like that but if God tell
[1:24:26] you that all you got to do is get your
[1:24:28] house in order and get ready to go
[1:24:29] that's right amen so she he told the
[1:24:32] sister say you're going to die God
[1:24:33] showed it to me well he come and and and
[1:24:35] everybody uh I don't know how everybody
[1:24:37] heard but many other preachers heard
[1:24:39] that he told that sister that so before
[1:24:42] amen the uh the preaching of of Tu of
[1:24:45] bride they said was a mighty anointing
[1:24:48] in the church like it was this morning a
[1:24:51] real strong anointing in the church and
[1:24:54] it was so strong that amen one of the uh
[1:24:57] uh famous preachers of that day and and

[1:26:30] store in Los Angeles he says sharks
[1:26:31] going to be swimming where you standing
[1:26:34] before you become an old man sharks will
[1:26:35] be swimming before where you standing
[1:26:37] where everybody been watching brother
[1:26:39] Billy Paul watching brother Billy Paul
[1:26:40] watching brother Billy Paul now they say
[1:26:42] before he become an old man shark's
[1:26:43] gonna be swimming where he's standing
[1:26:45] and they watched him turn 70 now what
[1:26:47] about the prophecy they watched him turn
[1:26:49] 75 what about the prophecy you know what
[1:26:52] and is brother bradam a false prophet
[1:26:54] because look at he told his son this and
[1:26:55] it didn't happen oh my my my you missed
[1:26:59] it you missed it amen it happened well
[1:27:04] before he became an old man that's right
[1:27:06] I want to say roughly a few years after
[1:27:08] brother Brandon left to sing they said a
[1:27:12] man that Paul Harvey was on the
[1:27:15] radio announcing that in the Maze
[1:27:18] building there's been an earthquake and
[1:27:20] a flood and this flood has sharks
[1:27:24] swimming in the garage of the maze
[1:27:27] building this was only a few years after
[1:27:29] brother brandom died now now now now now
[1:27:32] see the problem is is that they miss the
[1:27:35] rest of the
[1:27:36] [Music]
[1:27:37] [Applause]
[1:27:40] story and they was waiting for something
[1:27:42] that already manifested now I'm going
[1:27:45] tell you something you waiting on a
[1:27:47] restoration but it's already
[1:27:50] manifested amen and I'm going Show You
[1:27:53] by God's grace that by your very fact of
[1:27:55] sitting here you are already a part of
[1:27:58] restoration you didn't feel it amen you
[1:28:02] never you never saw nothing big happen
[1:28:04] but yet the promise of God was fulfilled
[1:28:07] in your
[1:28:08] [Applause]
[1:28:11] life they completely missed it but a lot
[1:28:14] of people still had their eyes on it but
[1:28:16] it gives us opportunity when people
[1:28:17] start asking questions it gives us
[1:28:19] opportunity to have some conversations
[1:28:21] what else could they have missed that
[1:28:24] God has already
[1:28:28] done brother Jason Watkins had a a a
[1:28:31] brother in his church who had a sister
[1:28:33] that worked in the Maze building and uh
[1:28:36] and that that that brother say his
[1:28:37] sister told him they gave her a memo
[1:28:39] saying don't go in the garage because
[1:28:42] sharks are swimming in that garage don't
[1:28:43] go the same place where he told Brother
[1:28:45] Billy Paul they'll be swimming before
[1:28:47] you become an old man it happened
[1:28:48] exactly like like that now what happens
[1:28:51] is is uh they go to Google and they say
[1:28:55] but they don't have this reported well
[1:28:56] why would they report it and I mean you
[1:28:59] talk about in the 6s this would not be
[1:29:01] there praise the Lord it really wouldn't
[1:29:03] be there but but but can you take an
[1:29:05] eyewitness a brother who had a sister
[1:29:08] who worked in the building that got a
[1:29:09] memo now most likely that lady's already
[1:29:12] gone Hallelujah so I'm not going to be
[1:29:15] looking for I need to talk to her I need
[1:29:17] to get her Memo well if you're going to
[1:29:19] be like that why don't you go back and
[1:29:21] try to visit with
[1:29:24] Moses if you going to take the account
[1:29:26] of what happened in Genesis go back and
[1:29:28] have an interview with Moses and see
[1:29:30] what Google has to say about
[1:29:32] that oh you going have to take some
[1:29:35] things by
[1:29:37] faith we were listening to the tape the
[1:29:39] other night I'm coming I'm coming home
[1:29:41] brother Brandon made a statement in the
[1:29:43] tape that we listened to on on on uh on
[1:29:45] Friday night amen turned northward he
[1:29:47] says the Revival produces
[1:29:50] twins yes but one of the twins that
[1:29:55] comes out of the Revival his approach to
[1:29:57] the word is
[1:30:00] intellectual so when you see somebody
[1:30:02] approaching the scripture intellectually
[1:30:03] they are twin spirit that comes out but
[1:30:07] they're looking at the word from the
[1:30:08] wrong angle you cannot look at this from
[1:30:10] an intellectual perspective it's going
[1:30:13] to take faith without faith it's
[1:30:16] impossible to please God not without
[1:30:20] your intellect God can blow your
[1:30:21] intellect out of just out of
[1:30:24] orbits you you wouldn't know what you
[1:30:26] what you was thinking about I thought I
[1:30:28] had it right no God God thoughts are
[1:30:30] higher in your thoughts and his ways are
[1:30:32] so much higher than your ways so you got
[1:30:33] to approach things by
[1:30:35] faith I just
[1:30:39] believe I wondered after brother Billy
[1:30:42] Paul was called home I wondered was it
[1:30:44] enough to turn the hearts of those who
[1:30:47] have walked away with it turn them back
[1:30:50] again and I found that it wasn't
[1:30:53] enough but I did find another
[1:30:57] event that would be more than enough to
[1:31:01] get the job done Amen to turn people's
[1:31:04] hearts back to the faith amen I found an
[1:31:08] event in Scripture that is more than
[1:31:11] enough that'll get the job done and that
[1:31:13] event is this promise that I'm reading
[1:31:15] over you I will restore sayth the
[1:31:23] Lord that's more than enough to get the
[1:31:25] job done now a a a restoration
[1:31:29] occurs regardless of the conditions oh
[1:31:33] brother brandom says it just like that a
[1:31:36] restoration occurs regardless of the
[1:31:39] conditions and I want to just inject a
[1:31:41] scripture here because I believe Paul
[1:31:43] kind of speaks to this amen and when we
[1:31:45] look at our own lives and some of the
[1:31:47] things that we were involved in a
[1:31:49] restoration has occurred has brought us
[1:31:51] back to our condition that God saw us at
[1:31:53] in the beginning amen before the
[1:31:55] foundation of the world Hallelujah how'
[1:31:57] you come back to this position it it was
[1:31:59] the spirit of God that brought you back
[1:32:01] here now now look look at what Paul says
[1:32:03] in 1 Corinthians 6 it says this know you
[1:32:07] not that the unrighteous shall not
[1:32:10] inherit the kingdom of God Amen be not
[1:32:15] deceived neither
[1:32:16] fornicators nor idolators nor adulterers
[1:32:20] nor Emin nor abusers of themselves with
[1:32:23] Mankind and that's that's speaking so
[1:32:25] much of
[1:32:27] homosexuality hallelujah amen you ain't
[1:32:29] going to make it to Heaven living that
[1:32:31] kind of
[1:32:32] Lifestyle Hallelujah we might as well
[1:32:34] just be honest with people God God loves
[1:32:38] The Sinner but he hates sin and we got
[1:32:41] to preach against
[1:32:43] sin amen church right look he says says
[1:32:47] uh nor feminine nor abuses of themselves
[1:32:49] with mankind if you don't know what that
[1:32:50] mean look at up you'll see it deals with
[1:32:54] homosexuality and it told you that
[1:32:56] you're not going to inherit the kingdom
[1:32:57] of God you're not going to do it look
[1:32:59] now he says this verse 10 nor
[1:33:03] thieves nor
[1:33:06] Covetous nor
[1:33:08] drunkers nor
[1:33:10] revilers nor extortioners my God my God
[1:33:14] taking advantage of people and taking
[1:33:15] their money from them extortioners you
[1:33:18] not going to get there amen look he say
[1:33:21] shall inherit the kingdom of God and
[1:33:23] look at this look at this and
[1:33:25] such were you used to be this way but
[1:33:30] after the Holy Ghost got a hold of you
[1:33:31] something changed amen such were some of
[1:33:34] you but look at this but ye are
[1:33:37] watched but ye are
[1:33:40] Sanctified but ye are justified in the
[1:33:44] name of the Lord Jesus by the spirit of
[1:33:47] our God here you had nothing to do with
[1:33:50] this justification s there's nothing
[1:33:53] that you could do by yourself God had to
[1:33:55] do it alone inside of you I like this I
[1:33:59] said your wickedness could not stop your
[1:34:06] washing our sinful ways could not stop
[1:34:10] God from sanctifying
[1:34:12] us amen my past I want to tell the devil
[1:34:16] my past is over and I am
[1:34:20] justified
[1:34:22] the washing of the blood of Jesus makes
[1:34:25] it just as if I never sin in the first
[1:34:30] place a true washing of the blood will
[1:34:32] cleanse you from all your sins and a
[1:34:34] true cleansing brings you back into
[1:34:37] perfect fellowship with
[1:34:40] God he says I will restore sayith the
[1:34:43] Lord now this may mean different things
[1:34:48] to different people it just depends on
[1:34:49] where you are in life I I want to read a
[1:34:52] few scriptures Amen to you uh when it
[1:34:55] when we talk about this restoration
[1:34:56] Jeremiah Jeremiah 30 and
[1:34:59] 17 Oh
[1:35:02] Glory Jeremiah 30:17 says for I will
[1:35:06] restore Health unto thee see if you're
[1:35:10] going through this you ought to take a
[1:35:11] hold of this promise I will restore
[1:35:14] Health unto thee and I will heal thee of
[1:35:19] thy
[1:35:20] wounds now now now now now I want to you
[1:35:22] know just Camp there just for a little
[1:35:24] bit sometimes it's not an external wound
[1:35:27] you know a bruise before it shows on the
[1:35:31] outside something occurred on the
[1:35:35] inside hallelujah amen before that
[1:35:38] bruise could develop something had to
[1:35:40] happen on the inside before it showed on
[1:35:42] the outside what this healing of the
[1:35:44] wounds is that whatever took place on
[1:35:46] the inside God will bring healing to
[1:35:50] it God I'll restore Health unto thee and
[1:35:54] I will heal thee of thy wounds say the
[1:35:56] Lord because they call thee an
[1:35:58] outcast saying this is Zion whom no man
[1:36:01] seeketh after Genesis 40 and13 I want to
[1:36:06] read about this restoration see uh maybe
[1:36:10] you lost a
[1:36:12] job amen we saw this even here in our
[1:36:16] own church a brother that used to work
[1:36:18] at a particular organization he went
[1:36:22] there to another organization end up
[1:36:25] losing job over there because they was
[1:36:26] they want to send them all kind of
[1:36:28] places like no I can't do that
[1:36:29] Hallelujah came back into the presence
[1:36:31] of the Lord and then he he he started
[1:36:34] looking for jobs everywhere but then all
[1:36:36] of a sudden just suddenly this one job
[1:36:39] shows up and he really didn't want to go
[1:36:42] back to that job but it showed up and it
[1:36:45] disappeared just like
[1:36:47] that he applied got the job with the
[1:36:50] race
[1:36:52] God restored him back to his
[1:36:55] position and when God restores you back
[1:36:58] he don't he don't decrease you he
[1:37:01] increases
[1:37:04] you I don't know if I got them all here
[1:37:06] but there's a scripture say because of
[1:37:08] the things that you went through I
[1:37:09] restor to you
[1:37:15] double but here in Genesis 40 and 13
[1:37:18] look at this it says and this is this is
[1:37:20] uh the story of the
[1:37:22] butler hallelujah amen he lost his
[1:37:26] position but because he was in the right
[1:37:28] place Joseph in the right Jail at the
[1:37:30] right time he had a dream interpreted
[1:37:32] and here was the interpretation of his
[1:37:34] dream yet within three days shall
[1:37:38] Pharaoh lift up thine head and restore
[1:37:41] thee unto thy
[1:37:43] place oh my if I needed a job I would
[1:37:47] jump on that God I'm looking for it in
[1:37:50] three days
[1:37:53] if the butler got his job in three days
[1:37:56] what about
[1:37:58] me yet within three days shall Pharaoh
[1:38:01] lift up thine head and restore thee unto
[1:38:04] thy place and thou shalt deliver
[1:38:05] Pharaoh's Cup in his hand into his hand
[1:38:08] after the form of manner when thou was
[1:38:10] his Butler he's going back to the exact
[1:38:13] position that he
[1:38:17] lost oh I I I I just I I pray church
[1:38:20] that we can we can take a hold of this
[1:38:23] you go back to the exact position that
[1:38:25] you
[1:38:26] lost this is being spoken at many levels
[1:38:29] here I pray this ain't going over the
[1:38:32] church's heads we're talking about
[1:38:34] restoration you're going back to the
[1:38:36] exact position that you
[1:38:39] lost and then force is here to make the
[1:38:42] devil give it
[1:38:44] [Music]
[1:38:49] back God Second Kings
[1:38:51] ate this lady lost
[1:38:54] land this lady lost her house she lost a
[1:38:58] lot of things because of a famine that
[1:39:00] had come into the land but when God
[1:39:03] changed the situation and famine was
[1:39:05] gone this lady went to the king and she
[1:39:06] got everything she lost back now I'm
[1:39:09] going tell you the famine today is not
[1:39:12] natural things but the famine is the
[1:39:14] Famine of the word of God and there many
[1:39:17] people lost and trapped out that that
[1:39:19] Satan has unrightful
[1:39:22] deceitfully taking Souls of men and
[1:39:26] Souls of women but the Holy Ghost is
[1:39:29] here to tell the devil we going on the
[1:39:32] off fense you going to have to give it
[1:39:36] back 2 Kings chapter 8 ver4 says this
[1:39:40] and the King talked with gahaz the
[1:39:42] servant of the man of God saying tell me
[1:39:45] I pray thee all the great things that
[1:39:47] Elisha hath done and it came to pass as
[1:39:51] as he was telling the King how he had
[1:39:52] restored a dead body to life that behold
[1:39:55] the woman whose son he had restored to
[1:39:58] life so this lady had a son raised from
[1:40:01] the dead Elisha was the one that raised
[1:40:03] him and as he's telling a testimony the
[1:40:05] lady walks right into the court of the
[1:40:08] king and he say hey this the lady I'm
[1:40:11] telling you who what happened but this
[1:40:13] is the lady that had happened to she had
[1:40:16] been away for for for for for years but
[1:40:19] she happened to walk in in at the right
[1:40:22] time she came in the right season and
[1:40:25] when she came in this was an opportunity
[1:40:28] to get everything restored the king's
[1:40:30] heart was touched by the
[1:40:34] testimony this could not have been a
[1:40:36] more perfect time for this lady to come
[1:40:38] back from her journey W
[1:40:41] hallelujah amen amen amen this is the
[1:40:45] year somebody coming back from their
[1:40:47] Journey they've been on a long journey
[1:40:50] but this is a year you come under the
[1:40:52] right inspiration you come at the right
[1:40:55] time you come because God said he was
[1:40:58] going to
[1:41:01] restore and it came to pass as he was
[1:41:04] telling the King how he had restored a
[1:41:06] dead body life that behold the woman
[1:41:08] whose son he had restored to life cried
[1:41:10] to the king for her house and for her
[1:41:13] land my God and gahaz said my Lord oh
[1:41:16] King this is the woman and this is her
[1:41:18] son whom Elisha restor to life and and
[1:41:21] when the king asked the woman she told
[1:41:23] him so the king appointed see now now I
[1:41:25] just when when she when when the king
[1:41:27] asked the woman I can see let I know he
[1:41:29] telling you his part of the testimony
[1:41:31] but let you let me tell you my part of
[1:41:33] the testimony and as as she told it look
[1:41:36] look at what happened so the king uh and
[1:41:38] she told him so the king appointed unto
[1:41:40] her a certain officer saying restore all
[1:41:44] that was hers and all the fruits of the
[1:41:48] field since the day that she left the
[1:41:50] land and even until now so everything
[1:41:54] you lost in the Years while you were
[1:41:56] away we want to give that to you
[1:42:01] plus you don't lose with
[1:42:04] God you increase not
[1:42:07] decrease you get double for your
[1:42:13] trouble Amen Let me give you two more
[1:42:17] scriptures here amen turn with me to
[1:42:19] Psalms 51
[1:42:21] M because amen sometimes it's Health
[1:42:24] sometimes it's land might be business
[1:42:27] income healing to the Inner Man glory to
[1:42:30] God but sometimes it's just
[1:42:33] you and all that you just been going
[1:42:36] through and maybe you don't feel as
[1:42:38] close to God as you used to feel hello
[1:42:41] somebody but God God knows exactly where
[1:42:44] you are now there were some things that
[1:42:47] caused David to get into that same
[1:42:49] condition it was his sin that moved him
[1:42:51] further away from God but when he got
[1:42:54] those sins corrected when he repented
[1:42:55] before God he can write this prayer in
[1:42:58] the scripture Psalms 51 and: 10 says
[1:43:02] create in me a clean heart hallelujah oh
[1:43:08] God and renew a right Spirit within me
[1:43:12] at the beginning of the year renew a
[1:43:14] right Spirit Within Me cast me not away
[1:43:19] from thy presence
[1:43:21] and take not thy Holy Spirit from me and
[1:43:24] then it says
[1:43:27] restore unto me the
[1:43:31] joy of thy salvation and uphold me with
[1:43:35] thy free spirit sometimes all we need is
[1:43:38] our joy restored we didn't lose our
[1:43:41] salvation but the joy of Salvation we
[1:43:45] need God to restore the joy I remember I
[1:43:49] used to be on fire I couldn't wait for
[1:43:51] the church doors to open God I need that
[1:43:54] type of joy to come back into my life
[1:43:58] again restore the
[1:44:03] joy
[1:44:05] Hallelujah here in this last one that I
[1:44:08] want to read is Genesis 20 and 7 now in
[1:44:13] this praise
[1:44:15] God uh when brother brandom you know
[1:44:17] preaches the
[1:44:19] sermon restoration of the Bride tree he
[1:44:22] uh he takes uh uh Joel Joel one and Joel
[1:44:26] 2 and he also injects Genesis 20 and7 uh
[1:44:30] in there and and here's the things that
[1:44:32] I want you to understand about that as
[1:44:34] we as we get ready to read
[1:44:36] this
[1:44:38] uh regardless of the
[1:44:44] condition regardless of the condition
[1:44:47] God will do the restoration amen amen
[1:44:50] yes
[1:44:55] Sarah Abraham and Sarah put God in a
[1:44:58] really difficult
[1:45:00] position through a lie that they both
[1:45:04] told this man was only doing you know
[1:45:07] what he thought was right this King was
[1:45:08] only doing what he thought was right but
[1:45:10] but because of this lie that Abraham and
[1:45:12] Sarah told amen it caused this man to
[1:45:15] take Abraham uh take Sarah because they
[1:45:18] told him this is my sister
[1:45:21] now part of that was truth they were
[1:45:24] half sister and half brother but they
[1:45:26] they moved from the stage of just being
[1:45:27] brother and sister to being husband and
[1:45:30] wife now look at this amen uh when we
[1:45:33] look at this uh uh God had already told
[1:45:37] and gave Abraham a promise that Sarah
[1:45:40] thy wife will have a son Oh Glory to God
[1:45:45] now aimc could not touch Sarah because
[1:45:49] had he touched her it would have broke
[1:45:51] the promise of God so God not not
[1:45:55] necessarily protecting Abraham and Sarah
[1:45:58] what God was protecting was his
[1:46:03] promise and if God has made you a
[1:46:06] promise God will bankrupt Heavens before
[1:46:09] that word falls to the ground and return
[1:46:12] void I will restore sayth the
[1:46:16] Lord
[1:46:18] wo I don't know how long it's going to
[1:46:20] take I don't know what kind of dream he
[1:46:22] might have to give somebody but God
[1:46:24] going to move some way
[1:46:29] Somehow Here in in Genesis 27 says now
[1:46:32] therefore this is why ailec was sleeping
[1:46:35] God had a conversation with him restore
[1:46:37] the man his
[1:46:40] wife I I'm just going to say it like
[1:46:42] this I believe aimc represent the devil
[1:46:46] and I'm going to speak to the devil
[1:46:47] Satan now therefore restore the man his
[1:46:51] wife restore the woman her
[1:46:55] husband restore them parents their
[1:46:59] children give them back praise God
[1:47:03] restore the health to those
[1:47:05] people
[1:47:07] amen he said now therefore restore the
[1:47:10] man his wife for he is a prophet man I
[1:47:14] just love this
[1:47:16] scripture let me let me just let me just
[1:47:18] read it to you but let me let me let me
[1:47:20] let me inject a few things here and he
[1:47:23] shall pray for
[1:47:25] thee and thou shalt live and if thou
[1:47:29] restore her
[1:47:32] not know thou that thou shalt surely die
[1:47:37] look who who Who's Making This
[1:47:39] Promise Abraham is not the one telling
[1:47:43] this man to restore my wife back or
[1:47:46] I'mma kill
[1:47:47] you that's not Abraham's words Abraham
[1:47:51] is not the
[1:47:54] enforcer but we get a glimpse of the
[1:47:57] enforcer the enforcer is God himself
[1:48:01] talking to ailec restore that man his
[1:48:04] wife let him pray for you then you'll be
[1:48:06] blessed and if you don't do it I'mma
[1:48:08] kill
[1:48:14] you Thou shalt surely not thou and all
[1:48:18] that are thine you talk about an
[1:48:23] enforcer man that man woke up from that
[1:48:25] dream went quickly to Abraham why why
[1:48:28] you tell me why you getting me all this
[1:48:30] trouble with God why you do me like this
[1:48:32] yeah I thought for sure y'all would kill
[1:48:34] me man we righteous people down here we
[1:48:36] don't live like that and so but you see
[1:48:39] here's a here's a beautiful thing that I
[1:48:40] like about this that Abraham we see it
[1:48:44] plainly in scripture Abraham
[1:48:48] lied right right Abraham told this man
[1:48:53] that that's my sister she could she she
[1:48:55] agreed with it they both lied to AMC
[1:48:58] this is my sister they both
[1:49:00] lied now when God begin to speak of
[1:49:05] Abraham when God begin to talk to aimc
[1:49:09] now you got to have the right type of
[1:49:10] heart that God can speak to you like
[1:49:12] this when God begin to speak to Abraham
[1:49:15] he did not call Abraham a liar did God
[1:49:18] hear his lie yes he did
[1:49:21] but even in his condition even in his
[1:49:25] circumstance even in his situation
[1:49:27] that's why the prophet say regardless of
[1:49:30] the
[1:49:32] condition the restoration happens
[1:49:35] regardless of the condition regardless
[1:49:37] of how you put God in a really bad
[1:49:41] spot regardless of what your family has
[1:49:44] done to upset the plan of God I want to
[1:49:47] tell you they haven't even upset the
[1:49:49] plan of God they are part of the plan of
[1:49:52] God you know a part of the plan of God
[1:49:54] is to send the canker worm send the
[1:49:57] Palmer worm send the Locust send the
[1:50:00] caterpillar but after all that then I'm
[1:50:03] going to
[1:50:08] restore you never even felt the canker
[1:50:11] worm when it came the Palmer worm and
[1:50:12] the cat you just saw the results of
[1:50:16] it you ain't going to feel when
[1:50:18] restoration is happening
[1:50:20] but you're going to see the results of
[1:50:23] [Applause]
[1:50:24] [Music]
[1:50:25] [Applause]
[1:50:30] it the promise was Sarah thy wife shall
[1:50:32] have a son and regardless of the
[1:50:34] condition there was a lie told that put
[1:50:36] them both in this position but
[1:50:38] regardless of that God say I'm going to
[1:50:40] restore
[1:50:41] somebody my God believe the devil's lie
[1:50:45] and is now experienc experiencing
[1:50:47] bondage their failures could not sto
[1:50:50] God's promise amen when in Abraham's
[1:50:53] situation God gave him back his wife and
[1:50:56] I don't know what your needs are today
[1:50:59] but I'm here to tell the devil give it
[1:51:05] back if he stole your
[1:51:08] money give it
[1:51:10] back huh he stole your
[1:51:13] car give it back if he stole your

[1:51:35] force the devil to give it back no we're
[1:51:38] not going to be on the defense this year
[1:51:40] wonder what's going to happen tomor no
[1:51:42] we going on the offense you going to be
[1:51:45] wondering what we
[1:51:46] doing brother brother Westco used to say
[1:51:49] it's time to give your mind battles mind
[1:51:55] [Applause]
[1:52:02] battles oh my my
[1:52:06] my brother the the the the scripture he
[1:52:09] didn't call him a liar he called him a
[1:52:12] prophet and there's many people today
[1:52:15] that brother brandom said this and it
[1:52:17] didn't come to pass brother brandom said
[1:52:19] that and didn't come to pass brother no
[1:52:20] no no you let's go back and let's look
[1:52:22] at some of these things that you say
[1:52:23] didn't happen you you go find me to
[1:52:25] quote and you tell me now don't tell me
[1:52:26] what some what you think somebody you
[1:52:28] heard somebody say you get the quote
[1:52:30] first and you come show me where he said
[1:52:31] it and then and then we'll we'll go from
[1:52:34] there and then the other thing we'll say
[1:52:35] is that now we see and I I don't feel
[1:52:38] brother brandom ever intentionally lied
[1:52:40] to nobody to try to pull people to
[1:52:43] himself to try to exalt himself in it to
[1:52:45] try to take the attention from God he
[1:52:46] always pointed us to Christ and same
[1:52:49] thing I'm trying to do point you to
[1:52:51] Christ he always every preacher is doing
[1:52:53] the same thing pointing you to Christ
[1:52:55] supposed be right but in in Abraham's
[1:52:58] case where we see him blatantly tell a
[1:53:00] lie God didn't call him a liar so why
[1:53:04] man gonna call him one God say he my
[1:53:07] prophet and I want him to pray for you
[1:53:10] now what would you do if you was ailec
[1:53:13] you know the man just lied to you but if
[1:53:15] you want your life and your family's
[1:53:17] life you better get down there to the
[1:53:22] prophet God you telling me to go to this
[1:53:24] liar this man nothing but a liar and you
[1:53:27] want me you want your life you want your
[1:53:30] family's
[1:53:31] [Music]
[1:53:36] life
[1:53:40] woo let me go I got I got uh a lot that
[1:53:44] I'm trying to work through here let me
[1:53:46] go forward let me go
[1:53:48] forward there might might be some things
[1:53:50] I can just cut for the day and I I'll
[1:53:52] pick them up
[1:53:53] again this this is important to
[1:54:00] me I I went and I did some
[1:54:04] research on this Joel 14 and just I got
[1:54:08] different
[1:54:09] commentaries uh that I'll I'll
[1:54:12] read um at a later date I won't read
[1:54:15] them today but what I want to what I
[1:54:18] want to try to show
[1:54:21] is um one of the commentar said that the
[1:54:24] meaning of of the four Hebrew words of
[1:54:28] palmerworm locust korm caterpillar the
[1:54:30] meaning of the for words translated
[1:54:32] there is uncertain that's the commentary
[1:54:35] that say the meaning of these words is
[1:54:37] uncertain now if churches are picking up
[1:54:39] that commentary and going to preach they
[1:54:41] would have no idea what Joel was talking
[1:54:45] about but we're just not looking at
[1:54:48] commentaries we're looking at prophetic
[1:54:52] insight and with prophetic Insight we
[1:54:54] can go into the scripture and see a lot
[1:54:56] more now I'm going to try to just bring
[1:54:58] just one little piece here today Lord
[1:55:01] knows I am I'm running out of time
[1:55:03] brother brandom said it's four stages of
[1:55:05] the same
[1:55:09] insect the Palmer worm he says that worm
[1:55:14] came to destroy the fruit on the
[1:55:17] tree he destroyed brother
[1:55:20] love and and and um uh he eats that
[1:55:25] faith in the word he also eats the joy
[1:55:28] of your salvation that Palmer worm was
[1:55:30] eating the joy of your salvation pretty
[1:55:32] much no noise in the church when amen
[1:55:35] and and and brother brand say when you
[1:55:36] know one brother got offended at him by
[1:55:38] all the people yelling amen and praising
[1:55:40] God in church just that just that just
[1:55:42] get me upset I can't I can't I can't
[1:55:44] take that I can't handle that he say
[1:55:46] Well it it it me it messes with me when
[1:55:48] they don't do it
[1:55:51] and he say when when they be yelling out
[1:55:52] a man in church it's like it's like my
[1:55:55] my my dog that I had I would take
[1:55:57] him hunting and when we get a or we
[1:56:00] get a a skunk we get them up the tree
[1:56:02] and then I say now sick them boy go get
[1:56:05] a get that skunk out of the tree or get
[1:56:06] that that raccoon out of the tree go get
[1:56:08] them sick them boy say when they say
[1:56:09] amen that's like sick them to the devil
[1:56:12] all
[1:56:13] right but the Palmer worm tried to take
[1:56:15] all that out now one of the other things
[1:56:17] he said the Palmer worm destroy the
[1:56:19] brother love and the way that he
[1:56:21] destroyed the Brotherly Love in the
[1:56:23] church was through
[1:56:28] gossip the way that the Palmer worm
[1:56:31] comes into the church is through
[1:56:35] gossip somebody do something or say
[1:56:38] something and you a really like you go
[1:56:39] I'mma just get this off my mind I got to
[1:56:41] share it with you God said a Palmer wor
[1:56:45] starts in the church but he says I will
[1:56:48] restore
[1:56:50] Hallelujah and now now brother brandom
[1:56:51] said the way that we can amen stop that
[1:56:55] P or he says we need to put up a
[1:56:57] spiritual electric fence that would stop
[1:57:00] him in his
[1:57:02] tracks God put up a spiritual electric
[1:57:06] fence now I'm leaving that there because
[1:57:08] I'm hoping brother tro would pick that
[1:57:10] one up and bring it home to us a
[1:57:13] spiritual electric
[1:57:16] fence I'm moving on the Loc
[1:57:21] amen he eats the leaves of divine
[1:57:25] Fellowship the caner worm he goes into
[1:57:29] the bark of the tree the lifeline of the
[1:57:31] tree and he Des he destroys the covering
[1:57:34] or the religion because the word uh
[1:57:36] religion means covering he attacks the
[1:57:40] doctrine hallelujah amen and and there's
[1:57:44] so much more that I can I can get in
[1:57:46] there but I uh let me just just drop
[1:57:48] this one right here he says um oh my
[1:57:52] water baptism that Doctrine was attacked
[1:57:54] in in in the early years of the church
[1:57:56] rather than baptized in the name of Lord
[1:57:58] Jesus Christ because there's
[1:58:00] nobody Amen in in the New Testament that
[1:58:03] we can find being baptized in the titles
[1:58:04] of father son Holy Ghost everybody
[1:58:07] baptized was baptized in the name of the
[1:58:09] Lord Jesus Christ outside of those that
[1:58:11] were baptized in John's baptism but we
[1:58:13] found out John's baptism wasn't enough
[1:58:15] because in Acts 19 people had to be
[1:58:17] re-baptized
[1:58:19] Amen in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:58:20] Christ now now now here amen um uh uh
[1:58:25] brother brandom say you know it's like
[1:58:29] you can't cash a
[1:58:31] check if the check was written and
[1:58:34] signed by
[1:58:36] boss you can't take that down to the
[1:58:38] bank and say I want I want to cash this
[1:58:41] check has been signed by boss they're
[1:58:44] gonna ask you what is your boss's name
[1:58:46] because we got a lot of people with
[1:58:48] Accounts at this Bank by the name boss
[1:58:51] right or the title boss we got a lot of
[1:58:53] bosses what is your boss's name he say
[1:58:56] also you could even cash a check if your
[1:58:58] boss wrote the check out this is to John
[1:59:02] do or Jane do take this down there and
[1:59:05] cash you would stop your boss in his
[1:59:07] tracks and you say look that ain't going
[1:59:09] to work the bank ain't G to see me as
[1:59:11] John do or Jango that's just a a name

[1:59:26] how you going to go to heaven not being
[1:59:29] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:59:33] Christ see the doctrine has to be
[1:59:39] restored the caterpillar comes along
[1:59:43] amen he sucks the life out of the church
[1:59:45] he sucks out the spirit and the way that
[1:59:48] they suck out the SP Spirit or the life
[1:59:50] of the church is through
[1:59:52] denominating see a prophet gives us
[1:59:55] Insight in this the other thing amen
[1:59:58] that he tells us
[2:00:00] uh uh oh my my my my my my that
[2:00:04] regardless of these conditions
[2:00:07] regardless of these things that have
[2:00:09] happened glory to God we're going to see
[2:00:11] amen a restoration happen now I'm going
[2:00:14] tell you he talked about this
[2:00:15] Restoration in so many different phases
[2:00:18] one of them is through through the
[2:00:19] church the church ages there was a
[2:00:21] restoration that took place in the
[2:00:23] church it's already happened we not
[2:00:25] waiting on it it has already happened
[2:00:26] it's when the word came back to us the
[2:00:29] restoration had already happened let me
[2:00:32] just I'm I'm I'mma get here and just
[2:00:34] read read a couple things I'm I'm
[2:00:35] jumping but I want to do something today
[2:00:37] and then I because it sets me up for
[2:00:39] where we want to go in the future here
[2:00:41] let me just read this one this one one
[2:00:44] quote I I made a note Amen on uh
[2:00:49] okay no that's that's good that's good
[2:00:51] all right proven his word proven his
[2:00:54] word let me read this one oh
[2:01:00] Glory that restoration that happens
[2:01:02] through the church
[2:01:03] ages in order for the restoration to
[2:01:06] happen God has to
[2:01:08] predestinate people that will walk on
[2:01:11] the earth at a certain
[2:01:13] time that would believe the fullness of
[2:01:15] the
[2:01:16] word oh my my my you know in the days of
[2:01:20] Paul not everybody believed but there
[2:01:23] had to be people on the Earth that would
[2:01:25] believe what Paul was saying in the days
[2:01:27] of arenus not everybody believed but
[2:01:29] there had to be people on Earth that
[2:01:30] would believe what arenus was saying
[2:01:32] Martin Luther Wesley all of them there
[2:01:35] had to be people on the Earth that would
[2:01:36] believe well there was and God
[2:01:38] predestinate certain people to be
[2:01:43] there you know what those people are
[2:01:45] there for to fulfill the
[2:01:47] restoration oh my my my my my
[2:01:51] my Lord
[2:01:53] Jesus those people we and I'm I'm going
[2:01:56] just tell you like this we are
[2:01:58] here the reason I'm sitting in spirit
[2:02:01] and truth tabernac I can be at any other
[2:02:04] Church in the city but the reason I'm
[2:02:06] here is because God wanted me to be a
[2:02:09] part of the
[2:02:15] restoration now if I said this would it
[2:02:18] hurt you I am the
[2:02:23] restoration did that hurt you because
[2:02:26] there was a a a man that uh that walked
[2:02:29] he a policeman and he walked around
[2:02:32] during the days of a wal Revival and
[2:02:34] they come looking at him asking him
[2:02:37] where is the West Revival the man didn't
[2:02:40] Point them to a
[2:02:42] building you came to found the W Revival
[2:02:45] you looking at it sir I am the W
[2:02:49] Revival what he saying is I'm a product
[2:02:52] of the Welsh Revival people that are
[2:02:55] waiting on the restoration don't realize
[2:02:57] you sitting next to a
[2:03:01] restoration you live with a
[2:03:05] restoration I am the restoration my very
[2:03:11] presence my very reason for being here
[2:03:14] is because God predestinated me to be
[2:03:17] the restoration
[2:03:21] I will restore sayeth the
[2:03:24] Lord look at this this is the quote that
[2:03:27] just got me and I just I need to share
[2:03:29] this and then I'm gonna I'm G just try
[2:03:30] to get out of here I'm oh my I I'll come
[2:03:32] back and pick up some more
[2:03:34] things this is out of proving his
[2:03:37] word he proves his word in every
[2:03:41] age by the most unusual
[2:03:44] way but he always does it in the same
[2:03:47] way see what did he do in the days of
[2:03:52] Noah somebody asked me a question this
[2:03:54] week why do we need a prophet I say man
[2:03:57] I wish they would have asked that to
[2:03:58] Noah in his day ask Noah why ask the
[2:04:01] people in Noah's day why they needed the
[2:04:03] prophet
[2:04:04] Noah because the word comes to the
[2:04:07] prophet and I and like I told you I can
[2:04:10] I can I can give you uh definitions
[2:04:12] about this scripture and and I'm going
[2:04:14] to do it if the Lord would allow me in
[2:04:16] the coming weeks I'm going to give you
[2:04:17] other definitions that people wrote but
[2:04:19] it's it don't even compare to what a
[2:04:21] prophet said it don't even get to the
[2:04:23] depths of what uh uh when you take
[2:04:25] prophetic Insight on the same scripture
[2:04:27] how many people can pick up their Bible
[2:04:28] and uh uh that which the the the the the
[2:04:32] Locust uh uh that which the pom have
[2:04:35] left have the Locust eaten that which
[2:04:37] the Locust have left have the cankerworm
[2:04:39] eaten that which the cankerworm have
[2:04:40] left have the caterpillar eaten how many
[2:04:42] people come pick that up and and realize
[2:04:44] what they talking about this is why we
[2:04:47] need a prophet when I picked up now I
[2:04:49] can preach to you that scripture because
[2:04:51] I'm giving it through prophetic
[2:04:54] Insight what did what did they they ate
[2:04:56] Fellowship they ate Joy brother brand
[2:04:58] said they ate peace of mind all of this
[2:05:01] stuff was eaten from that's what this
[2:05:03] this this Palmer worm was eating my God
[2:05:06] eating at the bark eating at the leaves
[2:05:08] eating at the fruit eating at everything
[2:05:10] but God said he was going to
[2:05:12] restore look at this look at this he
[2:05:16] says what did he do in the days of Noah
[2:05:18] when he was fixing to deliver the
[2:05:19] remnant he sent them Noah the prophet he
[2:05:23] sent Noah a sign and now notice when he
[2:05:26] comes to deliver the children of Israel
[2:05:27] what does he do his same way he sends
[2:05:31] his Prophet His prophets got the word
[2:05:34] look the signs and wonders of the word
[2:05:36] promise back the of the word promise
[2:05:38] backs it up that's it that's it's
[2:05:41] exactly the truth Israel made her March
[2:05:43] to the promised land because they
[2:05:45] believed it now watch this next
[2:05:46] statement watch this watch this and in
[2:05:49] the
[2:05:51] wilderness in the wilderness Journey it
[2:05:54] came to pass where did they where did
[2:05:57] they do it now in the wilderness Journey
[2:06:00] it came to pass that they disbelieved
[2:06:03] this
[2:06:04] Prophet after seeing the word being so
[2:06:10] confirmed the
[2:06:12] bride got out of
[2:06:15] Step oh I wish I could just take a long
[2:06:18] time on that but I'm going just drop
[2:06:20] this and and I'm going to come back to
[2:06:22] it this is where my inspiration for this
[2:06:24] year is that's why I got this little
[2:06:27] this little statement today get
[2:06:30] back in step when did they do it when
[2:06:34] they were going through the Wilderness
[2:06:36] Journey before they actually made it to
[2:06:39] the promised land but our promised land
[2:06:41] is a Rapture before people made it to
[2:06:43] the Rapture they got tripped up just
[2:06:45] like Israel got tripped up woo W he says
[2:06:50] after seeing the word being soak you saw
[2:06:53] all the the Miracles you read about them
[2:06:57] you heard them on the books and the text
[2:06:58] you saw you heard all these testimonies
[2:07:00] but somehow a website comes along and it
[2:07:03] trips you up
[2:07:05] unrightfully
[2:07:08] deceitfully but give it
[2:07:11] back look he says after seeing the word
[2:07:14] being so confirmed the bride got out of
[2:07:17] Step you know what I'm speaking about in
[2:07:20] The Vision SE got out of Step there was
[2:07:24] one stayed up by the name of Joshua and
[2:07:27] Caleb and believe the word of promis
[2:07:30] true regardless of what the circumstance
[2:07:32] was now I like that because God going to
[2:07:35] fulfill his words regardless of the
[2:07:39] conditions and you got some folk in here
[2:07:41] that's going to believe this
[2:07:43] message
[2:07:45] regardless of the conditions amen
[2:07:49] can I can I put it like this when you
[2:07:52] got one regardless of the conditions
[2:07:55] over here meeting another regardless
[2:07:58] conditions over here you know something
[2:08:00] got to happen and another statement
[2:08:02] brother random said when
[2:08:07] two when two omnipotents meet
[2:08:10] something's got to take place I will
[2:08:16] restore sayith the Lord
[2:08:22] now I got a lot more but I I just wanted
[2:08:25] to kind of just lay a little Foundation
[2:08:27] to where I want to go as I take my
[2:08:36] seat oh
[2:08:45] Lord see I I can preach like that that
[2:08:49] because I know what I'm talking about
[2:08:52] see and people and and and and
[2:08:54] denomination we wait for the preacher to
[2:08:55] get there he but he just wind that thing
[2:08:59] up and and I just go to church I see him
[2:09:01] do it I already I know what they gonna
[2:09:02] do I just I just stand up
[2:09:06] and but sometime I be feeling like I be
[2:09:09] wanting to do it too though I'm going to
[2:09:10] be honest coming from my Baptist
[2:09:12] background I'll be feeling that sometime
[2:09:15] yes sir but but but as I take my
[2:09:20] seat I simply wanted
[2:09:24] to bring the voice of the Prophet to you
[2:09:28] yes Lord he's going to explain to
[2:09:32] you about the bride getting out of
[2:09:35] step and I need you to understand
[2:09:37] something about when the bride got out
[2:09:39] of Step there was a certain part of this
[2:09:41] Vision that brother brand was going to
[2:09:43] explain and and there's a certain part
[2:09:45] where he was getting ready to scream
[2:09:49] and he's getting ready to tell the
[2:09:50] bride now now why did they get out at
[2:09:54] after they saw the
[2:09:55] vindications after they saw the word
[2:09:58] confirmed somehow this unrightful
[2:10:01] deceitful devil slipped in and caus
[2:10:05] people to get out get out of Step but
[2:10:07] the prophet before he could scream out
[2:10:11] before he could release it from his
[2:10:12] mouth somehow the people
[2:10:17] themselves
[2:10:19] yeah how did they do that the reason
[2:10:23] that they could do that is because God
[2:10:26] promised I
[2:10:29] will restore that's not says brother
[2:10:34] Jack that sayith the Lord and a
[2:10:37] restoration happens even when you don't
[2:10:40] feel it even when you don't see it you
[2:10:44] look back and see it's already done a
[2:10:47] restoration

[2:14:16] tell the vision I don't know what I can
[2:14:18] interpret it but I I'm going to tell the
[2:14:21] vision for my first time I fell into a
[2:14:24] trance and when I did there was somebody
[2:14:27] with me I didn't see the person it was
[2:14:29] just the
[2:14:31] voice and uh I looked and as I I looked
[2:14:36] this way he said the bride will come in
[2:14:39] view for a
[2:14:40] preview and I looked coming to me and I
[2:14:45] seen the most
[2:14:48] the most prettiest bunch of clean
[2:14:52] dressed women I ever seen in my life but
[2:14:55] each one of them looked like was dressed
[2:14:57] different they all had long hair and
[2:15:00] they were longer sleeves and skirts and
[2:15:03] so forth young women they look kind of
[2:15:05] I'd say about maybe 20 now I have the
[2:15:08] Bible open here before me I can only say
[2:15:12] what I seen if you say what are you
[2:15:14] looking at I'm looking at a clock what
[2:15:16] you look for I'm looking for people look
[2:15:18] at people why are you looking at I'm
[2:15:19] looking at the Bible that's what I'm
[2:15:20] telling the truth that's what I see now
[2:15:22] I can only say what I
[2:15:24] seen I don't I don't know what all about
[2:15:27] it I just have to tell you but when this
[2:15:30] bride she was looking right at uh the
[2:15:32] one was talking to me and I standing
[2:15:34] together her eyes she was the cleanest
[2:15:37] sweetest looking people I ever seen in
[2:15:39] my life look like it could have been a
[2:15:40] dozen or more just I don't know how many
[2:15:42] was a breast but they just a group up
[2:15:44] and she passed by sweetly with an air
[2:15:47] and her eyes eyes up watching as she
[2:15:48] passed by oh she was beautiful I looked
[2:15:51] at her as she passed by he said now we
[2:15:53] shall review said that's the bride now
[2:15:56] we will review the churches and they
[2:15:59] come I notice them coming up and when
[2:16:01] they come up each one look like got
[2:16:05] worse I never seen such a filthy bunch
[2:16:08] in my life and when he sit next I heard
[2:16:10] a noise and said next said Here Comes
[2:16:13] the American
[2:16:15] group now I am an
[2:16:18] America well this this made me sick I am
[2:16:22] not uh eloquent enough to in a mixed
[2:16:27] audience to say what was taking place uh
[2:16:31] uh uh and you'll have to read between
[2:16:33] the
[2:16:34] lines but when the women were coming the
[2:16:37] leader of them was a
[2:16:39] witch she had a great long nose and
[2:16:41] great big mouth and all of them was
[2:16:44] dressed with some kind of low clothes
[2:16:46] down here but the top just had a strap
[2:16:48] that just a little about a/ inch strap
[2:16:51] that moved up and went around them like
[2:16:53] this and each woman had something on the
[2:16:55] order many of you years ago used to
[2:16:58] remember when we used to cut that paper
[2:17:00] you know newspaper and make it old fly
[2:17:02] bush how many remembers you know well I
[2:17:04] think they using carnivals you know
[2:17:05] hanging down like a fringe paper lace
[2:17:07] paper they had something holding below
[2:17:10] them like this uh holding blow them all
[2:17:13] this part was exposed and each one had
[2:17:16] hair cut up real short and Fry looking
[2:17:19] things all over it like that real
[2:17:21] shortcut hair and full of
[2:17:23] makeup absolutely nothing but look like
[2:17:26] street
[2:17:28] prostitutes and they were walking with
[2:17:30] this paper and the
[2:17:33] vulgarity now the paper was what was
[2:17:35] hold in front of them but when they pass
[2:17:37] the review stand in the back of them and
[2:17:41] to see the way they were going
[2:17:44] on when their foremost in their back
[2:17:47] part and how they were acting I said is
[2:17:50] that the
[2:17:52] church and there she went and they were
[2:17:54] singing this year twisting Roll songs
[2:17:56] you know what you call going down sing
[2:17:59] going by I said is that the
[2:18:02] church and I was standing there and in
[2:18:04] my heart I was crying and this
[2:18:08] witch to my notion it's nothing else in
[2:18:11] the world but she's a she's that World
[2:18:14] Council of churches leading him right
[2:18:16] straight down the road where she was
[2:18:18] going they went off to the
[2:18:21] left and disappeared in
[2:18:24] chaos still beating this music and
[2:18:27] making real funny sounds and shaking
[2:18:30] their bodies one side and then the other
[2:18:32] side and then like that like that
[2:18:35] walking and I just started to bow my
[2:18:37] head and he said wait the bride must
[2:18:40] come
[2:18:41] again and I look and here they come
[2:18:44] again and they pass by a sweet looking
[2:18:47] little ladies that's all looking around
[2:18:49] at me as they pass by I noticed each one
[2:18:51] was dressed different and one in the
[2:18:53] back had kind of long hair hanging down
[2:18:56] and had it rolled around like this might
[2:18:57] have been German or something like
[2:18:59] that and I watched him and then as he
[2:19:02] started leaving two or three of them in
[2:19:04] the back car to get out of step and I
[2:19:06] was going to holler at him and they
[2:19:07] trying to get back and step again and I
[2:19:09] seen him just the vision just fade out
[2:19:11] and change
[2:19:12] from now here is the interpretation
[2:19:16] thereof
[2:19:19] the reason I remember I had just got
[2:19:22] through writing I hadn't finished I
[2:19:24] hadn't wrote these notes yet but in
[2:19:27] preaching this morning I caught what it
[2:19:30] was right in my
[2:19:32] sermon did you notice the church only
[2:19:34] came and view now that's the truth
[2:19:36] friends the heavenly father who writes
[2:19:39] the word knows that I tell the
[2:19:42] truth I don't I just say the truth and
[2:19:45] not knowing it till just a few minutes
[2:19:47] ago look like or just recently see did
[2:19:51] you notice the Bride come in view
[2:19:54] twice the first seed the second seed
[2:19:58] both of them exactly the same one and
[2:20:01] the reason they were dri dressed in
[2:20:03] different parts she'll come from All
[2:20:05] Nations it'll make up the
[2:20:08] bride each one had long hair no makeup
[2:20:11] and real pretty girls and they were
[2:20:12] watching me that representing the bride
[2:20:15] coming out of all Nations see each one
[2:20:18] representing a nation as they March
[2:20:20] perfectly in line with the word thing
[2:20:22] and then I have to watch her she'll get
[2:20:24] out of Step of that word if it don't
[2:20:25] watch when she's passing by if she gets
[2:20:27] by maybe it'll be my time when I'm over
[2:20:30] see when I'm finished or whatever it is
[2:20:32] what they was getting back trying their
[2:20:34] best getting back this getting line is
[2:20:36] looking out somewhere else watching
[2:20:38] about that church and just went out of
[2:20:40] into chaos but two the front ones never
[2:20:44] the back ones just two or three of them
[2:20:46] was kind of stepped out a little bit bit
[2:20:47] to the right hand side it looked like
[2:20:48] was trying to get back in line as you
[2:20:50] went by as this passed me old for here
[2:20:52] at the wall passed me I was standing
[2:20:54] there and then I just see it all move
[2:20:56] out and leave but you notice the church
[2:20:59] only came in to view once each Nation
[2:21:02] the church but the Bride come in twice
[2:21:06] see see what it was now not knowing but
[2:21:08] look at with my message this morning not
[2:21:10] knowing that see the seed fell in the
[2:21:14] ground at NAA that was Original Seed and
[2:21:18] she's come through the process of these
[2:21:20] denominations which only comes in
[2:21:22] existence once but the bride returns
[2:21:25] back again in the last days I will
[2:21:27] restore see the Masterpiece is brought
[2:21:30] up that's the reason she was in view
[2:21:32] reviewed the second time she was
[2:21:34] reviewed the first time and she was
[2:21:36] reviewed the second time and she's
[2:21:38] perfectly the second time like she was
[2:21:40] the first
[2:21:42] time oh
[2:21:44] God have mercy hurry hurry hurry
[2:21:47] life get in the green right
[2:21:53] quick all others never appeared no more
[2:21:56] they went out never to come back again
[2:21:58] but the bride came back because she is
[2:22:00] Alpha and Omega God the great sculpture
[2:22:05] has made him a
[2:22:07] masterpiece for it is a piece of his
[2:22:11] first masterpiece like he made in the
[2:22:13] garden of Ed and took a piece from and
[2:22:16] made another piece and that was marred
[2:22:18] and fell now he's been all this time
[2:22:20] building it up again and he brought
[2:22:22] forth this masterpiece and was
[2:22:25] smitten and order that part that was
[2:22:28] smitten was an order to bring back again
[2:22:31] that Masterpiece again so the
[2:22:33] Masterpiece in the Son of God the
[2:22:34] Masterpiece in the bride and it's a
[2:22:36] piece of him which must be the
[2:22:38] fulfilling of the word the word has been
[2:22:42] fulfilled and we're ready for the coming
[2:22:45] of the Lord oh Church of the Living
