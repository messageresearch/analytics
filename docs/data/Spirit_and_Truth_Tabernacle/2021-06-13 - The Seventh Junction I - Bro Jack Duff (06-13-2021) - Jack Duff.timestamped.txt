[58:42] lord of lords
[58:45] no one like you and
[58:48] uh father how blessed we are
[58:52] to be welcomed into your presence
[58:56] we feel the brush of angels wings
[59:01] we see the glory on each face
[59:05] the songwriter tells us surely the
[59:08] presence of the lord
[59:10] is in this place so father as we
[59:14] have come on this morning gathered in
[59:16] the precious name
[59:18] of jesus we have already felt the
[59:21] anointing and the worship
[59:22] and father we are turning our attention
[59:24] towards the word
[59:26] we asking that the holy spirit would
[59:30] not only go before us but come along
[59:32] with us
[59:34] god and make the word plain uh
[59:37] reveal from heaven today
[59:40] god to hearts that need to hear
[59:44] and father you know the needs of all of
[59:46] your people so i pray that you would
[59:48] uh just meet the needs of each and every
[59:50] one
[59:51] uh god we um i trust that you have your
[59:54] way
[59:55] in this portion of the service we ask
[59:58] that you
[59:58] hide us all behind the cross may we not
[1:00:01] be seen but may christ
[1:00:02] be on display today in jesus
[1:00:06] christ's name we ask him
[1:00:09] a man amen
[1:00:12] just if you don't mind just get your
[1:00:14] bibles
[1:00:18] um
[1:00:22] i'm turning with acts chapter 2 and i
[1:00:25] want to just i know that brother solomon
[1:00:29] prayed for his sister
[1:00:33] and his grandmother we want to also
[1:00:37] join in that at the end of the sermon um
[1:00:42] sister louis just asked that if she
[1:00:43] could just stand
[1:00:45] in the gap for her daughter before she
[1:00:47] goes the
[1:00:48] surgery and we want to honor that and i
[1:00:51] believe um
[1:00:53] sister shirelle is standing in a gap for
[1:00:55] her grandmother
[1:00:56] and um i thought it was very uh
[1:01:00] appropriate you know when we stand
[1:01:03] in the gap for others and offer prayer
[1:01:09] we are acting
[1:01:12] uh the same way christ has already acted
[1:01:18] uh because he stood in the gap for us at
[1:01:20] the cross
[1:01:21] right um and and i'm saying this
[1:01:24] uh because as we preach and if there's
[1:01:28] uh a situation that you
[1:01:31] know you want to stand in the gap for
[1:01:32] somebody else you're certainly welcome
[1:01:35] to do that
[1:01:35] when we pray with our sisters at the end
[1:01:38] of this sermon
[1:01:40] but hopefully our faith will be anointed
[1:01:42] amen
[1:01:43] in such a way that we'll believe god for
[1:01:45] the miraculous
[1:01:48] because at the junction
[1:01:53] um we're supposed to experience
[1:01:56] the miraculous amen
[1:02:00] amen do you know a person don't even
[1:02:02] have to be a christian to get healed
[1:02:06] they don't have to be a christian to get
[1:02:07] healed if they want to
[1:02:09] keep their healing
[1:02:13] that's why the scriptures say go and sin
[1:02:14] no more right if you want to keep your
[1:02:17] healing
[1:02:18] then you have to become a christian but
[1:02:20] uh but we want to we want to exercise
[1:02:22] our authority as believers amen
[1:02:25] um this morning so we'll we'll preach
[1:02:27] the word of god and after that we'll
[1:02:29] have a time of prayer for
[1:02:30] uh these needs and if you have someone
[1:02:32] in your heart that you want
[1:02:34] to just bring amen you're welcome to do
[1:02:36] that
[1:02:37] amen acts chapter 2 starting at verse 14
[1:02:42] praise the lord
[1:02:47] and uh the bible reads but peter
[1:02:49] standing
[1:02:50] up with the eleven lifted up
[1:02:53] his voice and said unto them ye man of
[1:02:55] judea
[1:02:57] and all ye that dwell at jerusalem be
[1:02:59] this known unto you and
[1:03:00] hearken to my words but these are not
[1:03:03] drunken as ye suppose seeing it
[1:03:05] is but the third hour of the day
[1:03:08] but this is that
[1:03:12] which was spoken by the prophet joel
[1:03:16] and it shall come to pass in the last
[1:03:19] days saith god
[1:03:20] i will pour out of my spirit upon all
[1:03:23] flesh and your sons and your daughters
[1:03:25] shall
[1:03:25] prophesy and your young men shall see
[1:03:27] visions and your
[1:03:28] old men shall dream dreams and all my
[1:03:32] servants and on my handmaidens i will
[1:03:34] pour out in those days of my spirit
[1:03:36] and they shall prophesy
[1:03:40] and i will show wonders in heaven above
[1:03:43] and signs in the earth beneath
[1:03:44] blood and fire and vapor of smoke
[1:03:47] and the sun shall be turned into
[1:03:49] darkness and the moon into blood before
[1:03:51] that great and notable day of the lord
[1:03:53] come
[1:03:53] it's come to pass that whosoever shall
[1:03:55] call in the name of the lord
[1:03:57] shall be saved amen the lord and a
[1:04:00] blessing
[1:04:02] to the reading of his word you may be
[1:04:04] seated
[1:04:05] amen in the presence of the lord
[1:04:16] praise the lord amen
[1:04:26] so the lord has been good to us
[1:04:31] amen and and um

[1:04:38] uh since beginning of this year
[1:04:41] um talking about the seven junctions
[1:04:45] and today amen we come to the seventh
[1:04:49] junction um and you know
[1:04:52] a i started off the year by saying that
[1:04:55] a junction
[1:04:56] is actually where two roads intersect
[1:05:01] or two ways actually come together
[1:05:05] and i thought it was just appropriate
[1:05:09] for the holy spirit to lead us down this
[1:05:13] journey amen and talk about junctions
[1:05:16] and uh and we had two churches intersect
[1:05:20] we had two churches join right
[1:05:23] uh and and and and i want to say
[1:05:27] that um this has been
[1:05:30] to me the smoothest intersection
[1:05:36] could i call it junction
[1:05:40] it's been the smoothest junction that
[1:05:43] that i've seen and i i mean you know you
[1:05:46] you you expect the devil to try to do
[1:05:48] something
[1:05:49] but for the most part the devil has been
[1:05:52] kept at bay
[1:05:54] and and i'm grateful because you know i
[1:05:57] i'm sharing with different people like
[1:05:58] man it just seemed like the church has
[1:06:00] been
[1:06:00] in revival since the beginning of the
[1:06:02] year and
[1:06:04] it's just a a real wonderful anointing
[1:06:07] that is
[1:06:08] in the house of god and i'm grateful to
[1:06:10] be experiencing
[1:06:12] this junction right i'm grateful to be
[1:06:15] experiencing brother brother smiley

[1:06:26] see he was he was already ahead of me he
[1:06:28] said unity not just unity at the
[1:06:31] junction
[1:06:32] but unity at the seventh
[1:06:35] junction hallelujah there's a message in
[1:06:38] the title
[1:06:40] right and uh you know because the
[1:06:42] seventh junction
[1:06:43] what we're gonna realize is that this
[1:06:45] junction deals with us
[1:06:48] hallelujah hey see we can look back in
[1:06:52] scripture and and see different people
[1:06:55] and
[1:06:55] and what their their role was and you
[1:06:58] know it's like uh if we could just put
[1:07:00] it like this
[1:07:00] it's like a great big drama
[1:07:03] and uh and and in the drama there are
[1:07:06] different scenes
[1:07:07] and actually i can call it like this
[1:07:09] different junctions
[1:07:11] hallelujah and when the curtain swings
[1:07:15] closed amen a new scene is developing
[1:07:18] and when the curtain swings open some
[1:07:20] new players step out on stage
[1:07:22] hallelujah somebody so in the first
[1:07:25] scene noah
[1:07:26] and his ark stepped out on stage come on
[1:07:29] somebody
[1:07:30] glory to god but the scene closed amen
[1:07:34] and they began to move some things
[1:07:36] around and
[1:07:37] in the background and and then when the
[1:07:39] curtain reopened again
[1:07:40] moses came forth with the children of
[1:07:44] israel
[1:07:45] to cross a red sea and let me tell you
[1:07:47] something that that junction they saw
[1:07:49] miracles
[1:07:50] that nobody had ever seen before glory
[1:07:53] to god but on moses to sing
[1:07:56] clothes the curtains closed
[1:07:59] but behind the curtains they was doing
[1:08:01] some other things
[1:08:02] some arranging was taking place and
[1:08:05] abraham and lots
[1:08:06] tap talk y'all gonna preach with me
[1:08:10] today
[1:08:11] abraham and lot came out from behind the
[1:08:13] curtain
[1:08:14] and god was revealing himself in the
[1:08:17] flesh
[1:08:18] of a man when he said i'm gonna visit
[1:08:22] sarah at the time of life
[1:08:26] but there come a time where the scene
[1:08:28] closed with abraham
[1:08:30] and sarah lot
[1:08:34] then the next guy that come on the scene
[1:08:36] they was getting this part ready
[1:08:38] and this guy had a great job to do i'ma
[1:08:40] tell you his he
[1:08:41] he was he was anointed i mean he was
[1:08:45] so anointed the spirit that was on this
[1:08:49] man was so anointed
[1:08:53] that god decided to use that anointing
[1:08:57] five times
[1:09:03] oh i hope you're with me now the
[1:09:05] anointing that was on this man
[1:09:08] god said this is a powerful anointing it
[1:09:10] says i'm going to use it five times in
[1:09:13] scripture
[1:09:14] and he used it on elijah and then elisha
[1:09:17] said i want a double portion of your
[1:09:19] spirit
[1:09:20] so he used him elijah and then john the
[1:09:23] baptist came on the scene
[1:09:25] hallelujah and god used that anointing
[1:09:27] again until the baptist
[1:09:28] but then there's a let me go to the
[1:09:30] fifth time i'm gonna skip the fourth
[1:09:32] time
[1:09:32] i'm going to the fifth time there are
[1:09:34] two witnesses
[1:09:36] according to the book of revelation that
[1:09:39] are supposed to come back during the
[1:09:40] tribulation
[1:09:41] and these witnesses will be elijah and
[1:09:43] moses
[1:09:44] it does not give their name but the
[1:09:47] reason we know who it is because their
[1:09:49] ministries
[1:09:50] are identified in scripture
[1:09:55] but at the fourth time that this
[1:09:58] ministry supposed to be used is supposed
[1:10:01] to come in this day
[1:10:03] in the seventh junction
[1:10:08] we'll go further the scene closed
[1:10:12] it was elijah and the 450 prophets of
[1:10:15] hell to god that asked about fire let
[1:10:16] them be god
[1:10:17] that was the fourth junction but then
[1:10:18] the fifth junction came and the and the
[1:10:21] curtain opened up again
[1:10:23] and this time we saw something that we
[1:10:26] all longed to see
[1:10:28] we saw our savior we saw our master
[1:10:32] we saw our redeemer how we saw
[1:10:35] our deliverer we saw our king
[1:10:38] oh come on somebody amen i mean
[1:10:41] everything that i
[1:10:42] needed i found inside of him my
[1:10:45] protector
[1:10:47] my provider my way out of no way
[1:10:51] my my open door when every other door is
[1:10:53] closed
[1:10:54] hallelujah my my my
[1:10:58] bridge over troubled water my alpha my
[1:11:01] omega
[1:11:02] my beginning my ending my everything in
[1:11:05] between
[1:11:06] praise god my encourage and my strength
[1:11:10] hey my director glory when everybody
[1:11:14] else leave me he promised never to leave
[1:11:16] me
[1:11:17] right everything i need i found in him
[1:11:22] the scene opened up in the fifth
[1:11:24] junction and we saw our lord and savior
[1:11:26] jesus christ
[1:11:28] and brother branham said that was a
[1:11:29] great junction
[1:11:31] that was that was a great junction amen
[1:11:34] and the reason was great because it was
[1:11:35] the first coming of our lord and savior
[1:11:38] jesus christ
[1:11:39] but you know he went to a grave he died
[1:11:43] he rose again but the scene closed
[1:11:49] and you would have thought it would have
[1:11:50] been all over
[1:11:52] but then the church ages began that's
[1:11:55] what we see on this board the church
[1:11:57] ages starting in the days of paul
[1:11:59] going through to the days of iranians
[1:12:01] and martin of columbia lutheran wesley
[1:12:03] the church ages begin to unfold after
[1:12:06] the death of our lord
[1:12:08] hallelujah because before his death he
[1:12:11] was only dealing with the jews
[1:12:13] but the gentiles were being called out a
[1:12:16] people for his namesake
[1:12:18] and we are that people they were coming
[1:12:20] through the gentile church
[1:12:22] ages paul himself had to tell the jews
[1:12:25] they were turning to the gentiles
[1:12:28] because the jews rejected the gospel
[1:12:30] they were the jews are the one that put
[1:12:32] christ on the cross
[1:12:33] but paul said we're turning from you and
[1:12:35] we're going to the gentiles
[1:12:39] and we've been receiving the gospel ever
[1:12:40] since that time
[1:12:42] but now we get to the point the seventh
[1:12:44] church age
[1:12:45] and we got the name there branham
[1:12:47] william marion branham
[1:12:48] is the messenger that came today this is
[1:12:51] this these stars are the stars in the
[1:12:53] hands of jesus
[1:12:54] revelation chapter 1 declares it
[1:12:56] revelation 2 and 3
[1:12:58] talks about the different ages and the
[1:13:00] different spirits that people have to
[1:13:01] contend with during those ages
[1:13:04] and i want to tell you every evil thing
[1:13:06] that they contended with in paul's day
[1:13:09] every evil spirit that was in iranian
[1:13:11] state and murders that columbia luther
[1:13:13] wesley
[1:13:14] all those spirits are compiled and
[1:13:15] they're here today
[1:13:18] and how luther had to keep his head
[1:13:20] above fanaticism
[1:13:22] glory to god and we've been challenged
[1:13:24] with the same thing in this hour
[1:13:26] oh hallelujah so the scene closed
[1:13:30] amen uh there after jesus appeared on
[1:13:33] the fifth junction
[1:13:34] but the sixth junction is when martin
[1:13:36] luther and john
[1:13:38] wesley were coming on the scene god used
[1:13:41] their ministries to bring
[1:13:42] light back to the church but i tell you
[1:13:44] to sing close after
[1:13:46] john wesley and now we find ourselves at
[1:13:49] the seventh junction
[1:13:50] which is the second coming of the lord
[1:13:54] jesus christ
[1:13:56] now just stay with me here i want to
[1:13:58] read a little bit
[1:14:00] amen i want to tell you that you're
[1:14:02] living in this seventh junction
[1:14:04] and i want to tell you another thing
[1:14:06] that this junction that you're living in
[1:14:08] is the greatest of all the junctions
[1:14:12] the seventh junction is the greatest of
[1:14:15] all the junctions now you know before i
[1:14:17] read this quote let me just kind of
[1:14:19] inject something here god always
[1:14:24] has better plans than man god
[1:14:27] always has better thoughts than man
[1:14:30] right when we were in school we had
[1:14:32] a man the track team and uh
[1:14:36] sometimes you have what you call a relay
[1:14:39] race
[1:14:40] where you have to take the baton you
[1:14:41] have to hand it to the next man
[1:14:44] glory to god and that man has a takeoff
[1:14:46] and he has a you know start running
[1:14:48] when we picked our teams for track
[1:14:50] hallelujah
[1:14:51] hey man we did not put the slowest man
[1:14:55] on the team
[1:14:56] as the anchor
[1:15:01] he was not going to be the anchor
[1:15:03] actually what we'd do is we we would
[1:15:04] sandwich him in the middle
[1:15:07] we're going to get somebody real fast to
[1:15:09] come out of the blocks
[1:15:12] right i mean we want this fella to try
[1:15:13] to get us just a little edge
[1:15:15] because you know at the time of the the
[1:15:17] passing of the time things can go wrong
[1:15:21] if i leave the box a little bit too
[1:15:23] early if the other man get that a little
[1:15:25] bit too late
[1:15:26] then the baton does not get to my hand
[1:15:28] before i take off
[1:15:29] i have to backtrack we don't need no
[1:15:32] backtracking
[1:15:33] that'll cause us a delay so we don't put
[1:15:36] the slowest man
[1:15:37] a man at the front or at the end we
[1:15:39] might put him in the middle
[1:15:41] god is smarter than us
[1:15:44] and through seven ages a baton has been
[1:15:48] passed hallelujah the baton of the word
[1:15:51] of god
[1:15:52] has been passed through seven ages and
[1:15:55] finally
[1:15:56] gets to this last age underneath the
[1:15:59] eagle anointing brother we got the baton
[1:16:03] sister we got the baton and we ain't
[1:16:06] dropping the baton
[1:16:08] we ain't dropping our standards with the
[1:16:10] word of cut
[1:16:11] we gotta keep it high we gonna run this
[1:16:14] thing to the finish line
[1:16:16] we gonna run it to the rapture
[1:16:22] you see this is where we are and god had
[1:16:25] confidence in us that we were his
[1:16:28] strongest
[1:16:30] we were his best
[1:16:34] i'm talking about all the stuff you're
[1:16:36] going through in your life
[1:16:38] all the mistakes that you're making god
[1:16:40] see you in my past
[1:16:46] because he could have caused you to live
[1:16:47] in a totally different time period
[1:16:49] but he brought you to the earth at this
[1:16:51] time you don't control when you come and
[1:16:54] when you go
[1:16:57] your birth was not a mistake
[1:17:01] right you were here back because god
[1:17:03] predestinated for you to be here this
[1:17:05] hour
[1:17:06] all right hallelujah god's best
[1:17:09] god strongest god's cream of the crop
[1:17:16] oh hallelujah all right here are the
[1:17:19] seventh junction here when their eyes
[1:17:20] were open let me just read this
[1:17:24] praise the name of the lord
[1:17:29] it says how many read the sermon
[1:17:32] i think i skipped but that's okay
[1:17:35] maybe that's where the holy spirit want
[1:17:36] me to be how many
[1:17:38] read the sermon when omnipotence speaks
[1:17:43] uh miracles happen
[1:17:47] glory to god says did you uh you believe
[1:17:50] that certainly omnipotent spoke
[1:17:53] at every junction and when the church
[1:17:57] cooled off
[1:17:58] and then omnipotent spoke he said
[1:18:01] miracles take place and this is the
[1:18:04] junction of all junctions
[1:18:07] this is the end time the end of the
[1:18:11] whole history of the world is
[1:18:12] right now at hand so you can expect
[1:18:18] hallelujah somebody amen i want to raise
[1:18:21] your expectations if
[1:18:22] if this is amen the end of all
[1:18:26] history amen he says so you can expect
[1:18:29] omnipotence to speak
[1:18:34] and you can expect glory to god
[1:18:38] you can expect the greatest and
[1:18:41] mightiest miracles that ever
[1:18:43] happened on earth will happen in the
[1:18:45] next few years to come
[1:18:46] if jesus tears it will be
[1:18:50] now i don't take it lightly that a man
[1:18:53] was released from hospice
[1:18:59] you don't hear things like that often
[1:19:02] a man released from hospice care to
[1:19:05] celebrate his 82nd birthday
[1:19:10] see you can expect glory to god
[1:19:15] i'm reading it for you right now i'm
[1:19:17] telling you what a prophet said
[1:19:20] this is thus says the lord you can
[1:19:22] expect
[1:19:24] glory to god the greatest and mightiest
[1:19:28] miracles that ever happened on the earth
[1:19:30] will happen in the next few years to
[1:19:32] come
[1:19:33] if jesus terry it will be
[1:19:38] now look at this then watch
[1:19:44] for satan to raise up his two
[1:19:50] when all heaven turns
[1:19:53] loose oh church i wish we could catch
[1:19:56] this from our spiritual eyes
[1:19:59] when all heaven turns loose all hell
[1:20:02] turns loose too and if you're not
[1:20:05] careful you get caught up in the wrong
[1:20:08] cycle
[1:20:11] because there's two moves happening at
[1:20:13] the same time
[1:20:15] all heaven is moving testimony after
[1:20:18] testimony after testimony
[1:20:20] you anointing nothing but god doing that
[1:20:23] no man can do it
[1:20:27] but then here comes a man all hell
[1:20:29] moving at the same time
[1:20:31] and you know what hell does hell points
[1:20:34] at the man in the pulpit
[1:20:37] but heaven is not pointing at a man in a
[1:20:39] pulpit
[1:20:40] heaven is pointing to a man on a cross
[1:20:43] hallelujah glory to god amen not blaming
[1:20:47] it on this person that person are we
[1:20:49] giving all the glory to jesus
[1:20:51] hell wants to try to point out all the
[1:20:53] frogs hell wants to point out all the
[1:20:56] failures
[1:20:56] look i ain't perfect and you ain't
[1:20:58] either
[1:21:01] but we serve a god who is perfect
[1:21:05] and brought us a perfect sacrifice
[1:21:09] oh glory to god see there's two moves
[1:21:13] happening at the same
[1:21:14] time you must be spiritual at the
[1:21:17] junction
[1:21:17] to catch which one is of god and which
[1:21:19] one is of of satan
[1:21:22] all hell is turning loose but i ain't
[1:21:25] concentrating on
[1:21:26] all hell i'm here looking at what heaven
[1:21:28] is doing
[1:21:30] hallelujah look at this all hell turns
[1:21:33] loose too
[1:21:34] and it's prophesied that there be a
[1:21:37] janice and jamborees on the earth in the
[1:21:39] last days
[1:21:41] who would almost impersonate the real
[1:21:42] thing so close
[1:21:44] enough to see the very elective possible
[1:21:46] see so we're looking for all of that
[1:21:49] can we just you know make sure we got
[1:21:52] that got clarity
[1:21:53] on that when they say janice and james
[1:21:56] that's a spirit that came up in the days
[1:21:58] of moses at that
[1:21:59] you know and at the junction of the
[1:22:01] second junction
[1:22:02] and this junction you can take that down
[1:22:04] uh in this junction
[1:22:06] uh moses was supernaturally anointed by
[1:22:09] god
[1:22:10] take his stick throw it down and it
[1:22:12] become a snake
[1:22:14] and and when you read your bible you see
[1:22:15] moses is running from that
[1:22:17] moses was kind of like me i don't like
[1:22:20] snakes
[1:22:21] if god gave me that trial take this and
[1:22:24] throw it down and i see a snake i'm
[1:22:26] taking off
[1:22:27] running but god didn't want moses to
[1:22:30] have fear
[1:22:31] oh hallelujah so god did something to
[1:22:34] moses to try to take that fear from him
[1:22:37] it says moses pick it up
[1:22:42] now you can imagine what's going through
[1:22:43] moses mind and i can see that snake
[1:22:46] wouldn't move
[1:22:46] nowhere maybe they're sitting there
[1:22:48] hissing at moses
[1:22:50] can you imagine it but i wouldn't move
[1:22:52] and go nowhere moses couldn't go to
[1:22:54] sleep
[1:22:56] and anywhere maybe moses might have
[1:22:58] tried to leave the mountain and here
[1:22:59] come the snake just following him
[1:23:02] come on work with me here right
[1:23:04] everywhere moses smith that snake was
[1:23:06] there
[1:23:06] but god told moses pick it up
[1:23:10] and maybe moses get to a spot where the
[1:23:13] snake got him cornered in hallelujah
[1:23:16] and and now when he's cornering he got
[1:23:18] no no other option
[1:23:20] but to reach down and pick it up
[1:23:24] sometimes sometimes god allows your
[1:23:26] circumstances
[1:23:28] can i put it this way your unwanted
[1:23:30] circumstances
[1:23:31] to put you in position where the only
[1:23:34] thing you can do is depend on him
[1:23:38] moses pick it up and when moses picked
[1:23:41] it up and turned back to the staff again
[1:23:44] he saw the supernatural hand of god in
[1:23:46] his ministry
[1:23:48] stuck his hand inside of his in his
[1:23:51] bosom and pulled it out it was white
[1:23:53] like leprosy
[1:23:54] and i can imagine i was like oh lord i i
[1:23:57] don't know what's down inside of there
[1:23:59] but my hand didn't look like that this
[1:24:01] morning and say but put it back in there
[1:24:03] mo it took
[1:24:04] faith for moses to take his hand and put
[1:24:07] it back down there
[1:24:09] and then pull it out and saw that it was
[1:24:11] healed
[1:24:14] hallelujah great miracles
[1:24:17] but then moses goes to egypt when it
[1:24:20] gets down there
[1:24:24] pharaoh said what you want he said i'm
[1:24:25] coming to get the people out let them go
[1:24:28] almost come on now uh who is your god i
[1:24:31] don't know your god
[1:24:31] i don't know none about him he said my
[1:24:33] god say let my people go
[1:24:35] i don't who is the lord that's what
[1:24:37] pharaoh acts who is
[1:24:38] the lord i know not the lord
[1:24:45] so fair i mean moses thought he was
[1:24:47] something took his roster
[1:24:49] thus saith the lord let my people go
[1:24:54] throw that rod down and it turned to
[1:24:57] snake and
[1:24:59] oh my but pharaoh wasn't moved
[1:25:04] pharaoh pharaohs oh you just won
[1:25:08] you just one that can do that will you
[1:25:10] learn that at moses
[1:25:13] pharaoh himself didn't even move janice
[1:25:15] and jamers
[1:25:17] come hallelujah and he said now i
[1:25:21] already know these fellas they went to
[1:25:22] the school that you went to but they got
[1:25:24] the same anointing
[1:25:29] and i'm gonna prove to you that they got
[1:25:31] the same anointing i'm gonna tell you
[1:25:32] something let me tell you something here
[1:25:33] catch this catch this don't miss this
[1:25:36] the anointing
[1:25:38] is not the vindication
[1:25:42] the miraculous is not the vindication
[1:25:46] now miraculous will come but that's not
[1:25:48] the vindication
[1:25:49] what you're looking for is the word
[1:25:54] with the anointing if they can't walk in
[1:25:58] truth
[1:25:59] then you know something wrong with that
[1:26:00] anointing i don't care how many miracles
[1:26:03] they have they perform
[1:26:05] hallelujah somebody the prophet already
[1:26:08] taught us that power
[1:26:11] without character
[1:26:15] how you know they ain't got character
[1:26:16] they can't get along with nobody
[1:26:19] can't even get along with their self
[1:26:24] you got to get that spirit off of you
[1:26:26] it's the truth anyhow
[1:26:28] we're not looking for just supernatural
[1:26:31] you've got to have a life to go with the
[1:26:33] supernatural
[1:26:35] i'm telling you church that there's two
[1:26:37] spirits in operation
[1:26:39] the spirit of god in the spirit of devil
[1:26:41] they both show up at the junction
[1:26:49] they threw down their snakes and now
[1:26:51] moses was like oh
[1:26:54] i know god sent me here and moses didn't
[1:26:57] get
[1:26:57] frightened and and start running like oh
[1:26:59] lord they got two snakes god what am i
[1:27:01] supposed to do
[1:27:03] what the lord i'm gonna do with this he
[1:27:05] didn't do nothing
[1:27:06] moses actually didn't say nothing moses
[1:27:09] just sat there and watched what god did
[1:27:13] in some kind of way god i mean the snake
[1:27:16] that moses threw down just went over to
[1:27:17] one of the other snakes
[1:27:19] somehow opened his mouth a little wider
[1:27:22] and just swallowed him up
[1:27:24] i mean just a snake swallowing a snake
[1:27:28] that's supernatural
[1:27:30] right swallowing up swallow my and then
[1:27:32] the other snake i mean when those isn't
[1:27:33] even trying to
[1:27:34] do nothing with that got to the other
[1:27:36] stick open his mouth swallowed him
[1:27:38] up and moses reached down without any
[1:27:40] fear this time
[1:27:41] hallelujah picked up the snake it turned
[1:27:45] back to a stick
[1:27:46] and probably looked at pharaoh so you
[1:27:48] got any more
[1:27:53] but you see there there's these
[1:27:55] anointings that show up at the
[1:27:57] junction and you just can't be fooled by
[1:27:59] the anointing
[1:28:01] what you got to look at is the word how
[1:28:04] are they staying with the world
[1:28:09] all right all right all right all right
[1:28:11] all right
[1:28:13] um let me uh skip down here a little bit
[1:28:17] a man a man amen
[1:28:20] all right um

[1:28:36] um it makes this comment here
[1:28:39] it says in the mark of the antichrist
[1:28:44] the mark of the antichrist is to reject
[1:28:47] the holy ghost
[1:28:52] and now i i want to make it clear now
[1:28:54] we're not talking about a goosebump
[1:28:57] we're not talking about a feeling on
[1:28:58] emotion we talk about rejecting the word
[1:29:00] and how the holy ghost is revealing the
[1:29:02] word for your day
[1:29:03] the mark of the antichrist is to reject
[1:29:07] the holy ghost right which you're sealed
[1:29:10] outside of the kingdom forever with no
[1:29:12] way they'll ever be forgiven
[1:29:14] he that speaks against the holy ghost
[1:29:17] will never
[1:29:18] be forgiven in this world of the world
[1:29:20] to come
[1:29:21] there's your mark of the beast and the
[1:29:23] seal of god and one little handful
[1:29:26] the seal of god is the baptism of the
[1:29:29] holy ghost
[1:29:29] and the mark of the antichrist is to
[1:29:31] deny it now you're
[1:29:33] marked one way or the other don't you
[1:29:35] want to have the holy ghost today it
[1:29:38] says if you people here
[1:29:39] would just only believe with oh a few
[1:29:41] moments of prayer
[1:29:42] signs and wonders would take place in
[1:29:45] the church this afternoon
[1:29:46] anything could happen i'ma say that
[1:29:48] again
[1:29:51] i'm not talking about an all-night
[1:29:52] prayer meeting
[1:29:55] i'm not talking about uh 40 days of
[1:29:57] fasting and prayer
[1:29:58] i i'm talking about if you people here
[1:30:02] will only believe with a few
[1:30:05] moments of prayer signs and wonders
[1:30:08] would take place

[1:30:37] thing around
[1:30:44] it happened for brother branham

[1:34:50] she didn't realize that was her brother
[1:34:51] she was picking
[1:34:52] she thought it was just her brother that
[1:34:54] she was picking at but it was god in her
[1:34:56] brother
[1:34:58] put it back in the scripture and say now
[1:35:00] you know miriam suffered for what she
[1:35:01] did now you know you're going to suffer
[1:35:03] what you just did
[1:35:04] and at that very moment a tumor was
[1:35:07] created
[1:35:07] some of our sicknesses are because of
[1:35:09] anger problems
[1:35:14] we need to be delivered from anger but
[1:35:16] somehow sicknesses are because of anger
[1:35:18] problems
[1:35:20] here she developed a tumor and as she
[1:35:22] got this tomb brother brandon prayed
[1:35:24] many times and just nothing
[1:35:25] could get nothing from god and while he
[1:35:27] was while he was
[1:35:29] uh away i think he was in louisiana and
[1:35:31] his wife is getting ready to go through
[1:35:32] surgery say i'll call you after the
[1:35:33] surgery is going to be all right
[1:35:34] he was away and just praying saying lord

[1:35:37] my my wife didn't have to go through
[1:35:39] this she stand between me and the public
[1:35:40] she'd do this she'd do that
[1:35:42] and god i know she did this and she made
[1:35:44] a mistake but god please forgive her
[1:35:46] he just he kept praying for and there in
[1:35:48] the hotel room the holy spirit said
[1:35:50] you can have what you asked for
[1:35:53] and he said before the doctor's hand
[1:35:56] touched my body the tumor would be
[1:35:58] disappeared
[1:35:59] he spoke it from louisiana while his
[1:36:01] wife was in kentucky or indiana
[1:36:03] somewhere
[1:36:04] and uh and he called and said he said
[1:36:06] yeah i'm getting ready to go in
[1:36:08] i'm getting ready to go in bill just
[1:36:09] pray for me and he's uh in some kind of
[1:36:11] way i think she actually said could you
[1:36:12] just do one more scan before you before
[1:36:14] you take me in could just do one more
[1:36:15] scan
[1:36:16] and they went back and they start
[1:36:17] scanning

[1:36:22] disappeared before they could actually
[1:36:25] do
[1:36:26] the surgery that god
[1:36:29] still lives today
[1:36:34] and i'm not just saying that just to say
[1:36:36] it
[1:36:37] i'm saying it because it happened a
[1:36:40] miracle at the junction

[1:40:04] psychiatrists are coming to be prayed
[1:40:06] for
[1:40:08] maybe they've been studying to try to
[1:40:11] help people but when they hear the
[1:40:13] problems of people they need prayer
[1:40:17] and y'all know we're living in a very
[1:40:19] dangerous world
[1:40:24] i mean just this week we had a terrible
[1:40:26] incident
[1:40:28] i mean a lady just at the grocery store
[1:40:29] with her with a grand grandchild i
[1:40:31] believe
[1:40:32] and a man had a little disagreement with
[1:40:34] her pulled out a gun and shot and killed
[1:40:36] both of them
[1:40:37] right in the grocery store you better
[1:40:40] make sure you're covered
[1:40:42] [Music]
[1:40:44] and before you leave the home you better
[1:40:46] be praying you just pray over your
[1:40:47] family before y'all leave home

[1:41:21] church
[1:41:22] amen it's a matter of life or death it
[1:41:25] says uh
[1:41:26] why is it even psychiatrists are coming
[1:41:29] to be prayed for
[1:41:30] why is it the world's in a nervous age a
[1:41:33] neurotic
[1:41:34] age when people can't wait

[1:41:49] up to you
[1:41:50] that's totally up to you i i got no
[1:41:51] problem with that
[1:41:53] but i will tell you this your pastor
[1:41:55] should be involved somewhere in the
[1:41:58] process
[1:42:01] don't just depend on the psychic
[1:42:02] psychiatrist because they might not be
[1:42:04] able to deal with the sin
[1:42:10] see a a spirit can actually stay there
[1:42:13] i don't care how much you talk and you
[1:42:16] just let
[1:42:16] out all your feelings it ain't brought
[1:42:18] you no deliverance yet
[1:42:20] it's a spirit there and until we deal
[1:42:22] with that spirit
[1:42:25] that's when that's we settled a sin
[1:42:27] question then you can be
[1:42:28] get free from that what
[1:42:31] psychiatrist got that got that spirit
[1:42:33] off that lady that was so nervous in

[1:45:18] tell you the only place where you're
[1:45:20] gonna find this quote where it was said
[1:45:22] like this is when brother brandman spoke
[1:45:25] it
[1:45:26] in west palm beach
[1:45:30] this is the only place that he that he
[1:45:32] said in west palm beach now there must
[1:45:34] be something to that
[1:45:36] because when brother branham told a
[1:45:37] story here in west palm beach he added
[1:45:39] this part he said
[1:45:40] he said he said uh say they both was
[1:45:41] going to resign i say don't resign from
[1:45:44] your duty
[1:45:46] he says once you have confessed it
[1:45:50] right then the devil don't have no right
[1:45:51] to stay there but once it's confessed
[1:45:53] you can go on and keep on
[1:45:55] he said keep on being a deacon you keep
[1:45:56] on being a sunday school teacher
[1:46:00] once it's confess
[1:46:05] see you make it right with god 66 that
[1:46:07] ain't got nothing he can hold on you
[1:46:08] then
[1:46:09] once it's confessed you're going free
[1:46:12] hallelujah
[1:46:19] let me try to finish this lord have
[1:46:21] mercy
[1:46:23] all right it says um why
[1:46:27] is it the world's in a nervous age
[1:46:30] a neurotic age when people can't wait
[1:46:34] and i can't pronounce that something
[1:46:37] like that
[1:46:39] he says uh um down the street
[1:46:43] 90 miles an hour stop at the beer
[1:46:46] joint two hours before they go home run
[1:46:49] over people
[1:46:50] what's the matter what's everybody in
[1:46:53] such a hurry
[1:46:54] you can't you can't visit your neighbor
[1:46:56] you don't have no friends
[1:47:00] considering people on facebook ain't
[1:47:02] your friends
[1:47:04] i don't care how many folk following you
[1:47:07] hallelujah
[1:47:09] amen glory to god
[1:47:13] it says um um you don't have no friends
[1:47:16] you you don't know who lives next door
[1:47:18] to you
[1:47:18] you ain't got time to do this you're in
[1:47:21] a hurry what's the matter
[1:47:22] there's a great drama being set that's
[1:47:25] right and the lion hungered nation are
[1:47:27] ravishing in
[1:47:28] but just before he gets able to take it
[1:47:30] god will take his church
[1:47:33] the great drama being set for the second
[1:47:36] coming
[1:47:37] of the lord now let me just kind of
[1:47:39] inject a couple things here
[1:47:41] and i already know i won't finish my
[1:47:43] sermon today but i'ma just
[1:47:44] at least get started at the junction
[1:47:48] we're supposed to see
[1:47:49] the supernatural at the junction we're
[1:47:52] also supposed to have
[1:47:54] a man um prophets and angels
[1:47:58] they come at every junction and
[1:48:01] in this junction god did send the
[1:48:03] prophet for this seventh
[1:48:05] junction god sent a prophet and uh by
[1:48:08] the name of william aaron branham at the
[1:48:10] seventh junction
[1:48:11] now when i go if i take you back noah
[1:48:13] was a prophet in his day moses was the
[1:48:14] prophet in his day
[1:48:15] elijah was the prophet in his day
[1:48:17] abraham was the prophet in his day
[1:48:19] jesus and john the baptist prophets in
[1:48:22] their day
[1:48:22] and then he called uh luther and wesley
[1:48:25] prophets they were seers
[1:48:26] right so so so here in this day william
[1:48:28] aaron branham would be the prophet for
[1:48:30] this day before the second coming of the
[1:48:31] lord
[1:48:32] now i like a statement i was listening
[1:48:33] to brother jason watkins early this
[1:48:35] morning he made a statement
[1:48:37] he said this message is not brother
[1:48:40] branham
[1:48:41] reading his bible and coming up with
[1:48:44] something different than everybody else
[1:48:47] that's not what the message is he said
[1:48:49] but this
[1:48:50] message is like what we read in the book
[1:48:53] of acts
[1:48:53] chapter 2 when peter stood up on the day
[1:48:56] of pentecost
[1:48:57] after that great experience of the holy
[1:48:59] ghost pouring out
[1:49:00] peter stood up and said these men are
[1:49:02] not drunk ass
[1:49:04] ye suppose he said but this
[1:49:07] is that that was spoken by the prophet
[1:49:11] joel
[1:49:12] and what we're saying with the message
[1:49:13] this is that
[1:49:16] that was spoken by malachi this
[1:49:19] is that that was spoken by jesus christ
[1:49:23] himself this is that that was identified
[1:49:27] in revelation 3 and revelation 10. this
[1:49:30] is that which is found in the scripture
[1:49:37] glory to god oh my i feel like i just
[1:49:39] got to read it
[1:49:42] let's go to malachi 4.
[1:49:46] when we're talking about a message we're
[1:49:47] talking about something that came out of
[1:49:49] the scripture
[1:49:51] something that god ordained to be here
[1:49:58] peter could do this on the day of
[1:49:59] pentecost peter wasn't just some you
[1:50:01] know these
[1:50:02] what these people doing they drunk they
[1:50:03] crazy what is going on what are they
[1:50:04] talking about
[1:50:05] what is this speaking of tongues we
[1:50:07] never heard nothing like they say this
[1:50:09] is that that joel was talking about took
[1:50:11] him right back to the word
[1:50:13] yeah right and one and even when he took
[1:50:16] him back to the world you realize it was
[1:50:17] still some people that couldn't see what
[1:50:18] peter was seeing
[1:50:20] but the ones that was experiencing it
[1:50:21] was a joy to them that they could
[1:50:23] identify
[1:50:24] their experience in the words
[1:50:27] for me i want to be able to identify
[1:50:29] everything we do
[1:50:30] in the word of god let the word guide us
[1:50:34] let the word lead us
[1:50:36] hallelujah there's an anointing in the
[1:50:37] word
[1:50:39] glory glory look at this malachi chapter
[1:50:42] um four verse five and six let's just
[1:50:45] read let's read that
[1:50:47] my jesus behold i will send you elijah
[1:50:51] the prophet and and you know if if um
[1:50:56] if you're turning in your bibles you
[1:50:57] will notice that the book of malachi
[1:50:59] is the very last book of the old
[1:51:01] testament
[1:51:02] and these are the last two scriptures in
[1:51:05] the old testament last two verses
[1:51:08] that god god allows malachi a prophet to
[1:51:11] speak about it
[1:51:12] and remember i told you the spirit of
[1:51:13] elijah come five times
[1:51:16] hallelujah elijah elisha
[1:51:19] and in this verse alone there's a
[1:51:21] promise of of it coming two times
[1:51:25] oh hallelujah look at
[1:51:28] behold i will send you elijah the
[1:51:30] prophet can i just
[1:51:32] i'ma just inject just a little bit while
[1:51:34] i'm reading this
[1:51:35] i remember sister wisdom helped me see
[1:51:37] this amen some years ago
[1:51:39] and i made a statement said you know my
[1:51:41] name might not be in the bible
[1:51:42] i believe it anyway she said brother
[1:51:45] jack
[1:51:46] amen but your name is in the bible i say
[1:51:48] oh yeah
[1:51:49] where's my name as this she said every
[1:51:52] time you see god say
[1:51:53] you
[1:51:56] put your name there i say hallelujah
[1:51:59] says
[1:52:00] behold i send jack duff
[1:52:03] elijah the prophet and when is he going
[1:52:06] to come
[1:52:07] amen before the great and dreadful day
[1:52:11] of the lord
[1:52:12] now a lot of people say well this was
[1:52:14] john the baptist a portion of it was
[1:52:17] but not all of it was john the baptist
[1:52:20] right because john the baptist did not
[1:52:21] come
[1:52:22] amen at the great and dreadful day of
[1:52:24] the lord
[1:52:25] john the john the baptist came in today
[1:52:27] this was a this was a great day but not
[1:52:29] a dreadful day
[1:52:31] it was not dreadful for jesus to go to
[1:52:33] the cross
[1:52:35] that wasn't dreadful not not in the way
[1:52:37] that you're looking at it
[1:52:38] right amen the reason he went to the
[1:52:40] cross because he was bringing
[1:52:42] redemption to mankind
[1:52:44] it was the only way god would get man
[1:52:47] back in fellowship again
[1:52:48] that wasn't dreadful of course he didn't
[1:52:50] want to do it he
[1:52:52] he had to surrender to the will of god
[1:52:53] to do it we understand that
[1:52:55] but not in that way that you're looking
[1:52:57] at it
[1:52:58] the cross was everything we needed
[1:53:02] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:53:05] his act a man before the cross of
[1:53:08] praying through
[1:53:09] is is just a is an example
[1:53:12] for us as believers when we're going
[1:53:14] through something hard when we want the
[1:53:16] will of god to be
[1:53:18] no you understand what i'm saying
[1:53:22] when we want the will of god to be
[1:53:23] something different than actually what
[1:53:25] we're asking for
[1:53:26] that that's when that's when we're
[1:53:28] saying okay lord let this cup pass
[1:53:30] but then when you don't let the cup pass
[1:53:32] you have to accept his will
[1:53:36] nevertheless let thy will be done
[1:53:39] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:53:41] look at this now says behold i will send
[1:53:43] you elijah prophet for the coming
[1:53:45] of the great and threatened of the lord
[1:53:46] and look at this now the very next verse
[1:53:47] promised by god according to scripture
[1:53:50] and he shall turn the heart of the
[1:53:52] fathers to the children
[1:53:54] comma and
[1:53:57] now and is a conjunction which brings
[1:54:00] two thoughts together
[1:54:02] uh however this scripture in the first
[1:54:04] part is talking about john the baptist
[1:54:06] ministry
[1:54:07] which is clearly identified in luke
[1:54:09] chapter 1 i believe
[1:54:10] but the second part and the heart of the
[1:54:13] children to their father the spirit of
[1:54:14] elijah would come and turn the heart of
[1:54:16] the children to their fathers
[1:54:17] lest i come and smite the earth with a
[1:54:19] curse that part was fulfilled
[1:54:21] in the seventh angels ministry
[1:54:24] hallelujah which was the same angel
[1:54:27] spoken of in revelation 3
[1:54:29] 14 glory to god also spoken of in
[1:54:33] revelation 10
[1:54:34] 7. i can't read all of that
[1:54:37] but i'm just giving you where it is amen
[1:54:40] it's the same ministry
[1:54:41] all these ministries tied together by
[1:54:43] scripture so when we're talking about
[1:54:44] the message we're saying this
[1:54:46] is that which was spoken by the prophet
[1:54:49] malachi
[1:54:50] this is that that was spoken by john the
[1:54:53] revelator
[1:54:54] and can i also tell you this is that not
[1:54:57] an alternative to
[1:54:59] to denomination but a fulfillment of
[1:55:02] scripture amen
[1:55:06] matthew 17 matthew 17.
[1:55:18] this is after the great mount
[1:55:21] transformation experience
[1:55:23] disciples up there with jesus and and um
[1:55:27] they they saw moses and elijah come and
[1:55:30] and peter got so
[1:55:32] anointed he said let's build three
[1:55:35] tabernacles right here one for moses
[1:55:39] one for elijah one for you jesus
[1:55:42] then a voice from heaven had to calm
[1:55:44] peter down
[1:55:45] this is my son who i'm whom i'm well
[1:55:47] pleased don't worry about trying to
[1:55:48] build no tabernacles for these other
[1:55:50] people
[1:55:51] we're building it and if you're going to
[1:55:52] build anything build it for christ
[1:55:55] because this is my son in whom i'm well
[1:55:56] pleased and remember i told y'all last
[1:55:58] week we got to keep our head above the
[1:55:59] fanaticism there's a lot of folk out
[1:56:01] there building all kind of other
[1:56:02] tabernacles
[1:56:05] y'all be watching for that i say that
[1:56:07] you know why i got saints here that
[1:56:09] travel and go from place to place and
[1:56:11] and i think you should do that i think
[1:56:13] that's good to get out there sometimes
[1:56:14] sometimes you get out there and you
[1:56:16] visit somewhere else
[1:56:19] appreciation changes let's just put it
[1:56:22] that way
[1:56:23] your level of appreciation sometimes
[1:56:25] changes
[1:56:26] when you get out sometime and you see
[1:56:29] sometimes you just get used to this it's
[1:56:31] just a
[1:56:32] running a meal right but then when you
[1:56:34] get out and see you might oh
[1:56:35] wow wow wow wow
[1:56:41] and you might run into something i want
[1:56:42] to let you know you got to keep your
[1:56:43] head above fanaticism
[1:56:46] hallelujah i mean brother brother quaker
[1:56:49] is a brother that's been able to keep
[1:56:50] his head above
[1:56:51] some fanaticism brother kwaku was
[1:56:52] attending a church
[1:56:54] that he did not agree with what they
[1:56:56] were doing in there but it kept going
[1:57:00] it kept going even though he didn't
[1:57:01] agree now because most of us oh
[1:57:03] that's off the word i'm ah
[1:57:06] see you don't have the right spirit you
[1:57:09] might be able to win somebody if you can
[1:57:10] just bear with them a little bit
[1:57:12] right but but brother quaker just just
[1:57:14] kind of sat there sat there just waited
[1:57:16] just waited just waited
[1:57:17] and then the next thing you know um you
[1:57:19] know god opened up this opportunity for
[1:57:21] him to come here to
[1:57:22] to south florida he didn't even know a
[1:57:23] church was here hallelujah
[1:57:26] but when he saw sister amanda walking
[1:57:27] through the the the hallway there and he
[1:57:29] looked at it and said oh she looked like
[1:57:31] one of us
[1:57:33] she looked like one of us and and he's
[1:57:35] just start talking to her

[2:00:08] things that's getting ready to happen in
[2:00:10] his ministry and
[2:00:11] things that he gonna suffer and and the
[2:00:12] disciples thought they were holding on
[2:00:13] to something we're gonna get jesus we're
[2:00:15] gonna
[2:00:15] we're gonna use the word how are you
[2:00:17] gonna use the word on the word
[2:00:21] you can't do that but hear the disciples
[2:00:23] say and the disciples asked them saying
[2:00:25] why then say the scribes that elias
[2:00:28] must first come they knew they had been
[2:00:31] the bible
[2:00:31] uh to sunday school they knew that these
[2:00:33] things and jesus
[2:00:35] answered verse 11 and said to them elias
[2:00:37] truly
[2:00:39] shall first come and restore all
[2:00:42] things see i love this because
[2:00:46] jesus himself is prophesying of a
[2:00:49] ministry that is coming in this day
[2:00:53] and we talk about restore all things you
[2:00:55] cannot give that to john the baptist's
[2:00:57] ministry
[2:00:59] because john the baptist didn't restore
[2:01:00] nothing but when we talk about restore
[2:01:03] all things the teaching
[2:01:05] on baptism how we supposed to be
[2:01:07] baptized the church is still
[2:01:09] confused i went to church one day and
[2:01:11] the man
[2:01:12] uh so confused on how to baptize he said
[2:01:14] i baptize you in the name
[2:01:16] of the father and of the son and of the
[2:01:19] holy ghost
[2:01:20] and in the name of the lord jesus what
[2:01:24] how did he get all that mixed up no you
[2:01:26] just need to understand what his name is
[2:01:29] see the the name of the father the name
[2:01:32] of the son
[2:01:33] the name of the holy ghost is jesus
[2:01:37] all those other things are just titles
[2:01:40] hallelujah
[2:01:41] i got the title of husband i got the
[2:01:43] title of son
[2:01:44] i got the title of brother i got the
[2:01:47] title of
[2:01:48] pastor i got all these titles but i got
[2:01:50] a name
[2:01:52] and my name is jack duff so you got to
[2:01:56] know the name of god his name is the
[2:01:58] lord jesus
[2:01:59] christ
[2:02:03] hallelujah see there i mean mysteries of
[2:02:06] what happened in the garden of eden
[2:02:08] mysteries uh you know what what's the
[2:02:10] seven thunders what's the seven seals
[2:02:12] what's these things
[2:02:13] these are all mysteries that was in the
[2:02:14] scripture all that had to be revealed by
[2:02:17] somebody and god used a man
[2:02:18] with a seventh grade education to bring
[2:02:21] these things to us
[2:02:23] at the seventh junction
[2:02:28] this is not an alternative to
[2:02:30] denomination
[2:02:32] this is that which was spoken in
[2:02:35] scripture
[2:02:38] i'm not following just to be following
[2:02:40] all the signs wonders and miracles and
[2:02:42] brother bannon's ministry just to get my
[2:02:43] attention
[2:02:45] but now i i understand god was calling
[2:02:47] me to a higher place
[2:02:49] hey man amen
[2:02:52] you know it's through this message that
[2:02:53] i can you know my my vision has come
[2:02:56] clear i can see more than i ever seen in
[2:02:58] scripture come on
[2:03:00] church we've been talking about that in
[2:03:02] ephesians and how
[2:03:04] you know he uh um uh he wants
[2:03:07] your length breath and depth your height
[2:03:10] he wants to take you higher than you
[2:03:11] ever ever thought you could go
[2:03:12] and you can go there in this word all
[2:03:15] right
[2:03:16] let's keep reading the rest of the
[2:03:17] scripture uh matthew 17.
[2:03:20] the very next verse uh oh
[2:03:23] my lord jesus uh it says but i say unto
[2:03:26] you that elijah has come already
[2:03:30] now first he said elijah truly shall
[2:03:31] first come and restore all things
[2:03:33] but now i say unto thee that elijah's
[2:03:35] come already
[2:03:37] and they um and they knew him not
[2:03:40] but they have done unto him whatsoever
[2:03:42] they list it
[2:03:43] likewise shall also the son of man
[2:03:46] suffer
[2:03:47] of them now he never told him who elijah
[2:03:50] was
[2:03:51] look at the next verse because you just
[2:03:53] say elijah
[2:03:54] is going to come and restore all things
[2:03:56] that's the truth that's been lost
[2:03:57] throughout the ages that truth had to
[2:03:59] come back
[2:04:00] amen but he'll say elijah's already come
[2:04:02] already sitting out now he didn't tell
[2:04:03] him who elijah was but look at what
[2:04:04] happened
[2:04:05] in verse 13 then the disciples
[2:04:10] understood when is it gonna come a time
[2:04:15] i can't wait for that season
[2:04:18] to change that present-day disciples
[2:04:23] come to a spot where they understand
[2:04:28] the eyes of your understanding
[2:04:32] will be open
[2:04:36] oh glory to god you know many many folk
[2:04:39] hallelujah many folk that walked away
[2:04:41] because they got blinded
[2:04:45] oh hallelujah i heard this earlier this
[2:04:47] week you know uh
[2:04:49] brother jason i think also brought this
[2:04:50] now you know in the days of sodom and
[2:04:52] gomorrah
[2:04:53] their eyes were actually blinded to be
[2:04:57] able to find the door
[2:04:59] to lock's house their eyes were blinded
[2:05:01] and it says today
[2:05:03] you know uh the preaching of the gospel
[2:05:05] has blinded the people's eyes
[2:05:07] it says now oftentimes in denominational
[2:05:09] churches because they experience
[2:05:11] the supernatural they actually get
[2:05:15] blinded
[2:05:16] by the supernatural oh i don't know if
[2:05:19] y'all caught that one yet
[2:05:21] they they can't see the truth because
[2:05:24] they blinded to that
[2:05:26] they can't find the door which the door
[2:05:29] in this day
[2:05:30] is christ they're blinded by the
[2:05:33] supernatural
[2:05:34] things that are happening they're
[2:05:35] telling you testimonials god did this
[2:05:37] god did that
[2:05:37] you blinded to truth
[2:05:44] see it's going to take more than just
[2:05:46] the anointing
[2:05:48] it's gonna take uh i i i need to make i
[2:05:50] try to make that as plain as i possibly
[2:05:52] can
[2:05:53] it's gonna take more than just an
[2:05:54] anointing for god to be satisfied with
[2:05:56] it
[2:05:59] god wants two things
[2:06:07] i'm just telling what the bible say to
[2:06:08] god god said god say
[2:06:10] but the hour cometh it's on the back
[2:06:13] wall
[2:06:14] and now now is when the true worshipers
[2:06:18] shall worship the father in spirit
[2:06:22] and truth and notice just the father
[2:06:25] seeketh
[2:06:29] oh i feel like shouting in here
[2:06:33] if the father's seeking for that type of
[2:06:35] worship what you're going to give him
[2:06:38] i i back back to cain now i'm back to
[2:06:40] king
[2:06:42] cain brought an offering it was
[2:06:45] beautiful
[2:06:47] and it came with the with the the best
[2:06:49] spirit that he could possibly come in
[2:06:52] god please please i can't wait to bring
[2:06:55] this to church and
[2:06:56] see what you think of it lord and he get
[2:06:59] there and present it to god
[2:07:01] god said and i told you it was at the
[2:07:03] altar
[2:07:06] at the altar the man got rejected at the
[2:07:08] altar
[2:07:09] not when he turned and went back to the
[2:07:11] seat at the altar god told him that's
[2:07:13] not good enough
[2:07:15] and not only told him more and good
[2:07:16] enough told him what to bring
[2:07:18] all he had to do was go copycat give me
[2:07:20] a lamb son
[2:07:21] god said he wanted to give me one of
[2:07:22] your lambs he could have went out there
[2:07:24] slayed the lamb with a bad attitude
[2:07:27] and brought it to god and god would
[2:07:28] accept it you said this what you wanted
[2:07:30] this what you got
[2:07:32] he could have did that and god would
[2:07:33] accepted it but god knew
[2:07:36] that it was not inside of king to be
[2:07:39] able to even bring him that offering
[2:07:42] so kane came up with an idea i'm gonna
[2:07:45] get you to accept
[2:07:46] my offering because there ain't gonna be
[2:07:48] but one church left
[2:07:54] i'm gonna kill my brother and i'm gonna
[2:07:56] break i'm gonna bring i'm gonna bring
[2:07:57] i'm gonna bring me something
[2:07:59] i'm gonna bring me something god still
[2:08:02] didn't take it
[2:08:05] you got you got god seeking those that's
[2:08:07] going to worship him in spirit
[2:08:08] and truth and i want to tell you
[2:08:10] something
[2:08:12] that's not this church
[2:08:17] amen that's just the name of it
[2:08:20] it could have been called any other
[2:08:22] thing
[2:08:24] but you know i i like to say it like
[2:08:27] this
[2:08:29] when we used to roll out the okeechobee
[2:08:30] to bible truth tabernacle
[2:08:32] we were worshiping in spirit and truth
[2:08:38] when we go over the bride of christ
[2:08:39] having our con born we worshiping
[2:08:42] in spirit and the truth if i get down if

[2:08:51] spirit and truth if i get the rapture
[2:08:52] and faith tabernacle i am worshiping
[2:08:54] in spirit and in truth wherever people
[2:08:57] are gathered around

[2:09:02] truth
[2:09:07] all right let me uh try to finish at
[2:09:09] least this scripture

[2:09:18] have done unto him
[2:09:20] whatsoever they listed likewise shall
[2:09:22] also the son of man
[2:09:24] suffer them then the disciples
[2:09:26] understood
[2:09:27] that he spake unto them of john
[2:09:31] the baptist it's finally it finally
[2:09:34] clicked and you know the sad part about
[2:09:37] it
[2:09:38] the sad part about it
[2:09:41] it didn't click until john was dead
[2:09:50] and for some of us it clicked after
[2:09:51] brother branham left the scene it
[2:09:52] clicked
[2:09:53] but i'ma tell you it's not gonna click
[2:09:55] for others until the bride
[2:09:57] leaves the scene by that time it's going
[2:10:01] to be too late
[2:10:04] let me uh
[2:10:07] let me just find a way to get out

[2:10:28] i know i ain't gonna have enough time to
[2:10:30] get into it all
[2:10:31] but let me let me i'll just i this at
[2:10:33] least be a little
[2:10:34] entry point for for part two and y'all
[2:10:36] gonna have to just wait a little bit on
[2:10:37] part two
[2:10:39] next week i thought this week was
[2:10:40] father's day and i'm like i'm confused
[2:10:42] next week is father's day and i want to
[2:10:44] bring a sermon for the fathers
[2:10:46] amen uh let's read the token
[2:10:50] now in the fifth junction there were 39
[2:10:54] miracles that jesus
[2:10:56] performed um 39 that the scripture x
[2:10:59] records
[2:11:01] and you know we just kind of focused on
[2:11:03] a number of the miracles that happened
[2:11:04] in the city of capernaum when we
[2:11:05] preached the message to fifth junction
[2:11:07] i preached it in three parts
[2:11:10] and and certainly enjoyed the journey
[2:11:13] but
[2:11:14] but i wanted to make a statement out of
[2:11:16] this message to tolkien
[2:11:19] here the prophet says now being
[2:11:22] in that we become part of the word and
[2:11:25] then take the token the spirit over the
[2:11:27] promise
[2:11:27] i am the lord that healeth thee
[2:11:30] we take the spirit over the promise i am
[2:11:33] the lord
[2:11:35] that healeth thee
[2:11:38] now get ready for the healing service
[2:11:40] tonight now i didn't
[2:11:41] i guess the lord know how he placing
[2:11:43] these things because i won't even
[2:11:45] pro i won't even think about stop this
[2:11:47] is the point that i need to stop
[2:11:49] not just get ready for the healing
[2:11:51] service at night but get ready for the
[2:11:52] healing service this morning
[2:11:56] see the see take the token
[2:11:59] hang it over the word what is the word
[2:12:02] you're the lord god that promised to
[2:12:04] heal all my diseases right
[2:12:06] hang it over the word on your unmovable
[2:12:10] faith in that word
[2:12:15] i don't know how he gonna do it i don't
[2:12:18] know when he gonna do it
[2:12:20] but he'll get out
[2:12:23] now that's the third thing that puts him
[2:12:26] out
[2:12:26] cause in him there is no such
[2:12:29] amen he says wish i could testify a
[2:12:32] little bit now
[2:12:33] to some things i've seen happen just in
[2:12:35] the last few weeks
[2:12:38] see oh what i could testify of you know
[2:12:41] the luke if all jesus done would be put
[2:12:44] in books there wasn't enough books in
[2:12:47] the world to write
[2:12:48] them right it says just what i've seen
[2:12:51] in my
[2:12:51] own ministry seen them do you compile
[2:12:55] the volumes on this platform here
[2:12:57] if i wrote it in details what i've seen
[2:13:00] him do just in my own ministry
[2:13:01] seen him do it see he had more success
[2:13:07] in my ministry
[2:13:14] what a statement he had more success
[2:13:18] in my ministry than he did in his own
[2:13:22] now remember he had more success now
[2:13:26] not me he had
[2:13:31] oh glory hallelujah it's who he decided
[2:13:34] to use
[2:13:36] right he who decided to veil himself in
[2:13:38] and i'm letting you know this morning he
[2:13:40] is still
[2:13:41] veiled in human skin
[2:13:45] i think brother brothers brother brother
[2:13:46] smiley preached on that one too
[2:13:48] in terms of being able to recognize if
[2:13:50] we could just recognize
[2:13:52] right we can just recognize who is in
[2:13:54] our midst
[2:13:56] if we just if we just get a glimpse of
[2:13:58] it that these not just quotes just to be
[2:14:01] read
[2:14:02] but somebody trying to anoint your faith
[2:14:03] it's christ trying to anoint your faith
[2:14:06] to believe for the impossible
[2:14:10] he had more success in jeffersonville
[2:14:12] than he did in nazareth
[2:14:15] he did it in that wicked city and this
[2:14:18] wicked city amen glory because
[2:14:20] uh uh he could perform no miracles there
[2:14:23] but he did
[2:14:24] hear he finally
[2:14:28] broke through here lord let that be our
[2:14:31] testimony
[2:14:33] he finally broke through here he got it
[2:14:36] done
[2:14:36] here he might have had to get people
[2:14:40] somewhere else
[2:14:41] but he got it done anyhow so uh
[2:14:44] and what he's saying people was driving
[2:14:45] from all over just to come into
[2:14:47] jeffersonville god was getting his work
[2:14:48] done
[2:14:49] don't let somebody come in here um
[2:14:53] maybe vision for the first time at the
[2:14:54] anointing uh hits them they're like you
[2:14:56] know i believe that i heard nobody
[2:14:58] preaching like that i believe that i
[2:14:59] believe i'm gonna receive my healing
[2:15:00] today
[2:15:01] don't let somebody walk in here and get
[2:15:02] theirs and you you leave with nothing
[2:15:06] hallelujah i mean that tape we just
[2:15:08] listened to and them them folk went to
[2:15:10] church
[2:15:10] everybody in there was you they weren't
[2:15:13] leaving without nothing
[2:15:15] even if i ain't got a prayer card i'm
[2:15:17] still gonna get something
[2:15:19] amen come with an expectation look
[2:15:22] he says uh he got it done here uh he he
[2:15:26] might have to have get people somewhere
[2:15:27] else but he got it done anyhow
[2:15:28] so he had more success right here than
[2:15:30] he did in capernaum
[2:15:32] or nazareth and he'd done more miracles
[2:15:35] right here in this tabernacle than he
[2:15:37] did
[2:15:37] in the entire ministry on earth that's
[2:15:40] right he
[2:15:40] did it now what about the rest of the
[2:15:42] world
[2:15:45] oh my now it says now uh
[2:15:49] that's what he done now remember he done
[2:15:52] now it never said
[2:15:54] i done it see no because i didn't do it
[2:15:57] i just didn't i just loved him and just
[2:16:00] submitted myself to him
[2:16:01] and said what he said and the holy
[2:16:03] spirit went to the other people and they
[2:16:04] believed what he said
[2:16:06] and then he done the work that i saw
[2:16:08] says if he can get all of us believing
[2:16:10] it
[2:16:11] what would he do right now if he can get
[2:16:14] all of us believing it right now
[2:16:16] there wouldn't be a feeble person around
[2:16:18] the town

[2:16:22] to believe it it'll be all over see
[2:16:25] hold your token over your unmovable
[2:16:28] faith
[2:16:29] and his promised word and satan
[2:16:33] will go and he says now i'm going to
[2:16:36] close

[2:16:39] perfect place
[2:16:40] to close this morning i will pick this
[2:16:42] up because i got to talk to you about
[2:16:44] the miracles that was done
[2:16:46] at this junction

[2:17:07] i want to
[2:17:11] have a word of prayer but also want to
[2:17:14] as i mentioned before we have two
[2:17:17] sisters that are coming and they want to
[2:17:18] stand in the gap for some family members
[2:17:23] we are going to naught with oil this is
[2:17:26] what the scripture tells us to do
[2:17:29] the bible says that the prayer of faith
[2:17:30] will save the sick and the lord will
[2:17:32] raise him up
[2:17:34] it doesn't say when it just says that
[2:17:37] that's what he's going to do and we're
[2:17:38] going to come and do things according to
[2:17:40] scripture this morning there's anybody
[2:17:43] here that
[2:17:46] said brother jack i want to i want to
[2:17:49] stand in the gap for somebody or
[2:17:51] i have a need myself and i want prayer
[2:17:54] we want to invite you to come
[2:18:00] join the line and let's just believe god
[2:18:04] we watched him do this just a couple
[2:18:05] weeks ago and there were so many
[2:18:07] testimonies that came forth from that
[2:18:08] service and that's because the
[2:18:11] miraculous
