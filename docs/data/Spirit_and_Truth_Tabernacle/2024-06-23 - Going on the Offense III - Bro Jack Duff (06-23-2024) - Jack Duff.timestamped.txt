[50:02] my bearings together uh I I want to
[50:06] thank the Lord you know Sister Eric and
[50:08] I were away for a couple weeks there
[50:10] traveling throughout uh Canada had
[50:13] backtack meetings uh over two weekends
[50:17] three services in each
[50:19] Church um and uh we started in
[50:23] Saskatoon then um in between the three
[50:26] Services we decided to go to uh Alberta
[50:30] which is Calgary area and uh while we
[50:33] were there waiting for Wednesday night
[50:35] service we got a chance to to slip up to
[50:39] um a place called Canmore which is
[50:43] roughly um 10 miles or so 10 15 miles
[50:46] from from B uh Canada and while we're
[50:50] there just getting a chance to it's a a
[50:53] complete change of scenery uh it's the
[50:55] Rocky Mountain mountains in Canada with
[50:58] snow all on top of the mountain and uh
[51:01] we just had a time just to relax for a
[51:04] couple days and you know we thank the
[51:06] Lord for that uh needed that because man
[51:10] the the uh each Church pulls differently
[51:14] and uh you know just trying to find the
[51:16] mind of God I had certain sermons that I
[51:19] wanted to take I say okay you we'll use
[51:22] this we'll use that we'll use this and
[51:24] uh and as I get there kind of like the
[51:27] Lord would change you know some of those
[51:29] things and uh uh but God knew what each
[51:32] Church needed and uh and we're grateful
[51:36] that he he uh spoke to the people amen
[51:40] and uh in his own special way so uh it
[51:43] was good to be there but it's even
[51:45] better to be back home amen so we thank
[51:48] the Lord for bringing us back safely and
[51:50] and also the meetings there in St
[51:53] Augustine happened this weekend and uh
[51:55] grateful some of the Saints was able to
[51:57] make it up there uh uh and uh be a part
[52:01] of the services representing our church
[52:03] so I want to thank you all uh for you
[52:06] know your support and also asking that
[52:09] we support the combined meeting on next
[52:12] weekend there in uh bton Beach just all
[52:15] the churches kind of coming together and
[52:17] we just ask that you please come out and
[52:19] support uh that service I think it'll be
[52:21] a real real blessing amen uh to to the
[52:25] Saints just just just this is what we
[52:26] used to do before Co and I'm just glad
[52:29] we get a chance to do it all over again
[52:32] and yes it is a sacrifice when you do
[52:35] things like that but I tell you what
[52:36] there is always a blessing in pressing
[52:40] amen so amen just let's let's do all we
[52:43] can to support the services all right I
[52:46] um I also wanted to uh take time this
[52:51] morning um brother Jerry and sister
[52:55] Melissa wanted to dedicate uh their baby
[53:00] uh to the Lord so we want to uh dedicate
[53:04] brother Elijah amen this morning to the
[53:07] Lord I just want to read um a scripture
[53:11] amen before we would have them come this
[53:15] is out of the uh Luke 18 amen verse 15
[53:20] uh Luke 18 and verse1
[53:23] 15 praise the Lord
[53:27] amen the Bible says and they brought
[53:30] unto him also
[53:33] infants that he would touch them but
[53:35] when his disciples saw it they rebuked
[53:39] them but Jesus called unto him and said
[53:43] suffer little children to come unto me
[53:47] and forbid them not for of such is the
[53:49] kingdom of God uh verily I say unto you
[53:53] so shall not receive the uh receive the
[53:55] kingdom of God as a little child shall
[53:57] in no wise enter therein and as a a
[54:01] church we certainly believe in
[54:03] dedicating uh the babies we don't
[54:06] baptize infants amen we we only dedicate
[54:10] them as the Lord Jesus did I know in
[54:13] some other churches they believe once a
[54:15] child has come been baptized and they
[54:17] got a automatic ticket to Heaven that
[54:19] that ain't that ain't but the Bible say
[54:22] uh these children have to come to a spot
[54:24] where they recognize that Christ died
[54:27] for their sins and uh it's the it's the
[54:30] parents responsibility to train them up
[54:32] and raise them up and introduce them to
[54:35] the Lord Jesus keep them in an
[54:36] environment amen where they can get to
[54:38] know Jesus uh for themselves uh brother
[54:42] random said in the message Paradox it
[54:43] says we we bring them and dedicate them
[54:46] any Mothers any church any Creed any
[54:49] color anything else we dedicate all
[54:52] little children to the Lord Jesus Christ
[54:56] amen so I'm going to ask that brother uh
[54:59] Jerry and sister Melissa if you would
[55:01] come uh at this
[55:03] time amen we will uh dedicate brother
[55:09] Elijah and I want to read uh two
[55:13] scriptures uh over him amen the first
[55:17] one is coming out of um uh Psalm 78 it's
[55:23] okay I'm I'm I'mma get it just one of my
[55:25] brothers just one but just take that
[55:28] stand and just raise it up for me I'd
[55:31] appreciate it amen um Psalm 78 verse1
[55:38] says give ear uh oh my people to my law
[55:42] incline your ears to the words of my
[55:46] mouth I will open my mouth in a parable
[55:49] I will utter dark sayings of old uh
[55:52] which we have heard and known and our
[55:55] fathers have told us thank you uh we
[55:58] will not hide them we will not hide them
[56:01] from their children showing to the
[56:04] generation to come the Praises of the
[56:07] Lord and his strength and his wonderful
[56:10] works that he have done for he
[56:13] established a testimony in Jacob and
[56:16] appointed a law in Israel which he
[56:19] commanded our fathers that they should
[56:21] make them known to their
[56:23] children uh that the generation to come
[56:26] might know them even the children which
[56:28] should be born uh who should arise and
[56:31] declare them to their children that they
[56:35] might set their hope in God and not
[56:37] forget the works of God but keep his
[56:41] Commandments and also um Jeremiah uh 1
[56:47] verse 4 and
[56:48] 5 uh we read this amen I believe I read
[56:52] this for his brother Jeremiah and I we
[56:56] we're going to read it for
[56:58] Elijah
[57:00] um verse four says then the word of the
[57:03] Lord came unto me
[57:05] saying before I formed thee in the
[57:08] belly I knew thee and before thou camest
[57:12] forth out of the womb I sanctify thee

[1:01:28] brother Smiley with the year Jubilee
[1:01:30] amen that he ministered to uh the church
[1:01:33] a couple weeks ago just a wonderful
[1:01:36] wonderful thought connecting right with
[1:01:38] the the theme of
[1:01:40] restoration and uh I I and and and um uh
[1:01:45] I need to say
[1:01:47] this uh there was some things brother
[1:01:51] Smiley was saying he probably don't even
[1:01:53] realize what he was saying
[1:01:56] um and some of the things he was saying
[1:01:58] was so spot on to a situation that
[1:02:03] people would think that I talked to
[1:02:04] brother
[1:02:05] Smiley uh about it before he preached
[1:02:09] but I need to let everybody know I a
[1:02:11] didn't say nothing the brother Smiley
[1:02:14] God know how to speak to his
[1:02:17] people amen God know how to speak to
[1:02:20] this people so uh I was just sitting
[1:02:23] there looking at the service and said
[1:02:25] Lord look at this look at this look at
[1:02:27] this and uh I'm just I know God God was
[1:02:29] in that so sometime you know people when
[1:02:32] it get that close and get that direct
[1:02:34] they oh brother Jack said something
[1:02:35] brother Jack didn't say nothing brother
[1:02:37] Jack didn't say nothing God said
[1:02:40] something amen and and God was just
[1:02:43] dealing with a situation so I hope
[1:02:45] people can receive from the Lord amen as
[1:02:48] it has been uh spoken and then uh

[1:03:08] rejoicing around the word and uh in
[1:03:11] between uh the services brother um uh
[1:03:15] Quinton Jr got started on a little
[1:03:19] thought regarding uh the gifts in the
[1:03:22] church and um you know from my perspect
[1:03:25] perspective I know sometime when a when
[1:03:28] a minister step into an area like that
[1:03:31] uh people get a little uncomfortable but
[1:03:32] from my perspective uh if it's in the
[1:03:35] Bible it can be
[1:03:36] preached right and uh and then the other
[1:03:39] thing is is that uh brother Quinton has
[1:03:42] just stepped right into a
[1:03:44] channel uh because as we go through this
[1:03:47] next step of the um the
[1:03:51] restoration y'all know we going to talk
[1:03:53] about the gifts
[1:03:56] yeah we got we GNA come and preach that
[1:03:58] right because the gifts are a part of
[1:04:00] the
[1:04:02] restoration Lord and mercy Jesus I just
[1:04:05] got a quote all the way from uh Durban
[1:04:09] South Africa this morning brother just
[1:04:12] sent me a quote and he said he was you
[1:04:14] know I'll I'll paraphrase it um there
[1:04:17] was a man in the Bible told uh I think
[1:04:20] they were fighting against the Syrian
[1:04:22] Army and he said you know go out and
[1:04:24] just strike the strike something like
[1:04:26] you know multiple times and um and the
[1:04:29] man went and only Struck it three times
[1:04:32] and they told him said you should have
[1:04:33] struck it more than that because you
[1:04:35] would have wiped out the Army now you're
[1:04:37] only going to have three battles against
[1:04:39] them he said but you should have struck
[1:04:40] more than that and then brother Brandon
[1:04:43] comes behind and say we need the the
[1:04:44] church ain't striking enough so we got
[1:04:47] to strike till the gifts come
[1:04:49] back we got to strike till healing comes
[1:04:52] back we got to keep striking until God
[1:04:55] moves in our midst right so I don't want
[1:04:58] to strike short I want to see everything
[1:05:01] that God promised amen manifested right
[1:05:05] here praise the Lord church so so
[1:05:08] Brothers Quinton just stepped into that
[1:05:10] and start talking about the gifts and
[1:05:12] and I just love the way the Lord is just
[1:05:14] using them um you know in that and I I
[1:05:17] mean I we had them come back on on this
[1:05:19] Wednesday night and share some more but
[1:05:22] uh we uh he he he what he done stepped
[1:05:25] into his a
[1:05:26] series you done steing into a series so
[1:05:29] you know when I see that I got to make
[1:05:31] room for him to be able to kind of get
[1:05:32] it all out amen we all got to make room
[1:05:35] we you got to recognize how God is
[1:05:38] moving it's ain't about no man no man at
[1:05:42] all this is about God manifesting
[1:05:44] himself in the midst of his people so I
[1:05:46] I just watched that and and one of the
[1:05:48] things that I appreciate you know
[1:05:50] because you know um some of the the
[1:05:53] younger brothers that are preaching we
[1:05:54] certainly put them in training we give
[1:05:56] them certain things to kind of do it
[1:05:59] this way do it that way do it this way
[1:06:01] uh watch your time all that we do all of
[1:06:05] that right and um and and I knew you
[1:06:07] know you got nine spiritual gifts so he
[1:06:10] stepped out the first time like how you
[1:06:11] going to get through all nine of them he
[1:06:14] can't he couldn't do it unless he rushed
[1:06:16] it through and if he rushed it through
[1:06:18] then the message is really not getting
[1:06:19] home right so so so he come and he just
[1:06:22] did two of them and then he stepped back
[1:06:24] and say I'll just wait and he didn't
[1:06:26] know when his next time was going to be
[1:06:28] but I'll just wait until the Lord
[1:06:29] releases me to come back and Sh so you
[1:06:31] you got you got to release next
[1:06:33] Wednesday right back give us two more
[1:06:36] right and uh and I just love the way the
[1:06:39] the way he's handling that I I like that
[1:06:42] so I mean I appreciate you know all all
[1:06:45] the brothers each one as brother Smiley
[1:06:47] say each one is made
[1:06:49] differently and and and and for me I
[1:06:52] appreciate all the differences I'm going
[1:06:54] say it like this if all of us were the
[1:06:57] same then 99% of us would not be
[1:07:00] [Music]
[1:07:03] needed so we thank God for our
[1:07:06] differences amen I appreciate the
[1:07:09] differences in all the ministers here so
[1:07:12] that was just that was just a blessing
[1:07:14] to my heart I I like seeing a church
[1:07:17] feed on the word of God amen amen praise
[1:07:21] the Lord all right musicians thank y'all
[1:07:23] I appreciate y'all so much amen amen
[1:07:28] amen yeah we going to we going to get
[1:07:31] this base piped into the system we're

[1:07:43] appreciate appreciate uh all that the
[1:07:46] Lord is doing amen amen amen all right
[1:07:51] let's stand and just read uh a quick
[1:07:53] scripture
[1:07:55] and then uh we'll move in our thought uh
[1:07:59] for today I'm trusting that I'll be able
[1:08:02] to bring this thought to an end we've
[1:08:05] been talking about going on the offense
[1:08:07] and um and so there are some things that
[1:08:11] I had left here hanging and and trust
[1:08:14] that we'll be able to kind of bring
[1:08:16] closure uh to it uh here in Matthew
[1:08:21] 11 and uh
[1:08:23] verse um
[1:08:26] you know we we I I'll read 11 and 12 we
[1:08:29] we we talked about this last time but I
[1:08:32] I won't go too much deeper in that but
[1:08:35] um the Bible said verily I say unto you
[1:08:37] among them that are born of women there
[1:08:41] not risen a greater than John the
[1:08:44] Baptist not withstanding he that is
[1:08:48] least in the Kingdom of Heaven is
[1:08:50] greater than he and from the days of
[1:08:53] John the Baptist until now
[1:08:56] the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence
[1:09:00] and the violent take it by force amen
[1:09:03] let's pray uh father we thank you Lord
[1:09:06] Jesus for uh the ability to read the
[1:09:09] word but we trust that the Holy Ghost
[1:09:11] with now uh just help us Lord to see
[1:09:15] what it is that you're trying to say to
[1:09:16] us in this hour thank you for the saints
[1:09:19] that have gathered thank you for those
[1:09:20] that are online many Lord that are away
[1:09:23] um um for various events ask that you
[1:09:26] just be with them and strengthen them
[1:09:28] and protect them while they're away from
[1:09:30] us bring them back home safely Lord as
[1:09:32] our prayer and I trust God that you
[1:09:35] would just continue to pour out your
[1:09:37] spirit amen in our midst thank you for
[1:09:39] what you've been doing uh in these past
[1:09:41] few weeks here in the church and Lord we
[1:09:44] know that there's more where that come
[1:09:46] from and uh we just believe that you are
[1:09:49] just uh constantly elevating elevating
[1:09:52] taking us deeper and higher Lord in the
[1:09:55] things of God so uh we look forward to
[1:09:58] what you have in store even on today God
[1:09:59] it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen God
[1:10:04] bless you you can be seated praise the
[1:10:07] Lord um so
[1:10:10] we you know just we we talked briefly
[1:10:14] about this in in the scripture and this
[1:10:16] is uh to
[1:10:18] me
[1:10:20] um prophetic
[1:10:23] Insight is
[1:10:26] uh one of the greatest things that God
[1:10:30] has given
[1:10:31] us uh when you can un you know realize
[1:10:35] that the Bible itself was written by
[1:10:39] prophets uh the very first five books of
[1:10:41] the Bible written by Moses and and Moses
[1:10:45] wasn't in the Garden of Eden Moses amen
[1:10:50] uh was not back there in Abraham's day
[1:10:54] and and uh you know and and and all the
[1:10:57] various things that happened through the
[1:10:58] Book of Genesis you know Moses wasn't
[1:11:01] Moses wasn't
[1:11:03] there um you know and uh so in order for
[1:11:08] you uh to believe the Genesis account
[1:11:13] you have to look at it through a
[1:11:15] prophetic
[1:11:16] lens praise the Lord amen and um you
[1:11:21] know and and if God could show Moses
[1:11:23] these things you know like that
[1:11:25] in in in the book of of Genesis now we
[1:11:28] you know we have to follow that same
[1:11:29] pattern all the way through scripture
[1:11:32] and uh when we start looking at various
[1:11:33] things even here in the New Testament
[1:11:36] you know this this statement that is
[1:11:38] made that uh from the days I'm sorry uh
[1:11:42] verily I said to you among them that are
[1:11:43] born of women there have not risen a
[1:11:45] greater than John the
[1:11:47] Baptist right when we see that and then
[1:11:50] I brought to you a little quote the last
[1:11:52] time where prophetic Insight say said
[1:11:56] until
[1:11:59] now right there hasn't risen one greater
[1:12:02] than John the Baptist until now and not
[1:12:05] that he's greater but the ministry is
[1:12:08] the same because the ministry that
[1:12:10] introduces the first coming of Jesus
[1:12:14] Amen is the same as the ministry that
[1:12:16] introduces the second coming of Jesus
[1:12:19] and each Ministry is equally
[1:12:24] important Hallelujah right so you know
[1:12:28] and um uh you know just little things
[1:12:30] like that when you're reading the
[1:12:31] scripture prophetic Insight helps you
[1:12:33] see something more than what the average
[1:12:36] individual is reading amen so we we
[1:12:39] thank the Lord for this uh as we you
[1:12:41] know just kind of look at look at this
[1:12:43] we've been talking about this going on
[1:12:45] the offense and and there's a number of
[1:12:48] things that we'll come back into here in
[1:12:49] a second uh but my my my thought even
[1:12:54] from the very first sermon this year you
[1:12:56] know to get back in step and uh the
[1:12:59] inspiration of I will restore sayeth the
[1:13:01] Lord um you know that um we used a
[1:13:05] statement in that in that sermon that
[1:13:08] you know we felt that this was a year
[1:13:09] that we had to switch positions and we
[1:13:12] need to get from a defensive mode and go
[1:13:15] into a offensive mode amen stop we not
[1:13:18] running from the devil and he just
[1:13:20] saying boo to us now we go to offense
[1:13:24] and we say boo back to the devil yes sir
[1:13:27] we're not jumping and running from him
[1:13:30] amen but we run towards that devil amen
[1:13:33] we put pressure on the devil rather than
[1:13:35] the devil putting pressure on us and
[1:13:37] like like brother Solomon brought that
[1:13:38] scripture you know I think it's Ezekiel
[1:13:40] Isaiah is this the man that created all
[1:13:43] this fear one day we're going to realize
[1:13:46] how small this itty bitty devil is glory
[1:13:49] to God Amen and we've been you going you
[1:13:52] going to be disappointed with yourself
[1:13:54] that you let a little fell like that
[1:13:56] control
[1:13:57] you how I mean well I better not say
[1:14:00] that cuz you know but I wouldn't want
[1:14:02] some just some little little itty bitty
[1:14:04] like like Elijah controlling all my
[1:14:07] decisions you know what I mean no that
[1:14:10] don't make no sense he don't know what I
[1:14:13] know and ain't been through the things
[1:14:14] I've been through so why I'm going to
[1:14:15] let something like this control me and
[1:14:18] sometimes we don't let the devil just
[1:14:20] just Rob us of of of of blessings Rob us
[1:14:23] of things so so it's time for us to go
[1:14:25] on the offense right and and and when
[1:14:27] going on the offense I want to just make
[1:14:30] make this clear in every sport no matter
[1:14:33] what the sport is when a team is on the
[1:14:36] offense the objective is to
[1:14:42] drive right now um the the the in
[1:14:47] football we're trying to you got to get
[1:14:49] you know every 10 yards you get a new
[1:14:51] set of downs right so my objective is to
[1:14:55] drive and at least get 10 more yards
[1:14:57] every time I come out on the field every
[1:15:00] time the offense is there my objective
[1:15:02] is to go forward to get 10 more yards
[1:15:05] and eventually if I keep getting 10
[1:15:07] yards and they haven't stopped me I'm
[1:15:09] going to score a touchdown glory to God
[1:15:12] right amen and and the higher your score
[1:15:15] then the the the better the the uh the
[1:15:18] better uh I mean it's you got a great
[1:15:20] opportunity of winning right so so it's
[1:15:22] always amen a drive even in in
[1:15:25] basketball it's it's a drive amen they
[1:15:28] they they say man don't settle for jump
[1:15:31] shots come on y'all some sometime the
[1:15:34] devil wants you shooting jump shots but
[1:15:36] no I ain't sellling for jump shots you
[1:15:39] know the the probability of me making it
[1:15:41] from the outside amen is less than if I
[1:15:44] drove the ball to the basket and shot a
[1:15:46] layup EXA right praise God and actually
[1:15:50] when you really in basketball when you
[1:15:52] want to take out some righteous
[1:15:54] indignation
[1:15:55] amen it's not with a
[1:15:57] three-pointer amen it's a drive to the
[1:15:59] basket and
[1:16:04] you and I don't know if you've ever seen
[1:16:06] when they when they when when when when
[1:16:08] when a boy get a real good
[1:16:11] dunk yes
[1:16:15] sir it I mean the dunk causes a certain
[1:16:19] uh a response it's it's a greater
[1:16:22] response than a three-pointer does
[1:16:25] hallelujah it's all about the
[1:16:28] dve amen even in in volleyball amen when
[1:16:33] they want to spike the ball amen it's
[1:16:35] all about the drive they they stand up
[1:16:38] to a certain wh make sure you can't play
[1:16:42] that the drive is
[1:16:45] [Music]
[1:16:47] important glory glory glory and and I'm
[1:16:50] a golfer now I don't play basketball as
[1:16:53] much as I used to I felt like bringing
[1:16:55] my golf clubs here just to show you by
[1:16:58] demonstration but if you ever seen a set
[1:17:00] of golf clubs if you ever seen a set of
[1:17:03] golf clubs the biggest Club in the
[1:17:09] bag it goes the furthest distance and
[1:17:13] it's the only shot that you get that you
[1:17:16] can put it on a tee raise it above the
[1:17:19] ground and actually take a swing at it
[1:17:21] you use a
[1:17:23] driver it's something something about
[1:17:27] [Music]

[1:20:38] with God's presence in Jesus Christ's
[1:20:40] name I like these words where he's

[1:21:59] understand that a prophet is going into

[1:24:41] say if the prophet could go on offense
[1:24:43] like this come on the word is in the
[1:24:47] bride and the mind of Christ to know
[1:24:50] what he wants done with the word now now

[1:24:53] allow to devil just to keep running
[1:24:55] rough shard in your family's life you
[1:24:57] can do that but you can also rise up and
[1:25:00] go in office and tell them then I
[1:25:02] deliver you in the name of the Lord
[1:25:05] Jesus
[1:25:07] Christ that power lies in the bride yes
[1:25:11] sir amen we're not the prophet not
[1:25:14] coming back to demonstrate that that is
[1:25:16] inside of us right now but we got to
[1:25:20] recognize what is what is what is inside
[1:25:22] of us let me let me just finish reading
[1:25:24] this I'm going to just say something
[1:25:25] says do you believe sir give your heart
[1:25:28] to Christ see the ministers uh see the
[1:25:30] ministers about baptism and the thing is
[1:25:32] over for you just
[1:25:34] believe that's it you know recently um
[1:25:38] my daughter was sharing a testimony with
[1:25:40] me and uh I'm going to read a scripture
[1:25:42] you know just to kind of help you on
[1:25:44] that in in a second but my daughter
[1:25:46] sharing a testimony with me she said um
[1:25:47] she was at work and her her boss was
[1:25:51] just coming in he was just just all out
[1:25:53] of sorts there's all out of sorts and
[1:25:55] and and um you know usually when they
[1:25:58] get out of sorts like this they just you
[1:26:00] know just avoid this guy get out of his
[1:26:02] way just just leave him alone just you
[1:26:04] know whatever but but she just kind of
[1:26:06] sat there and and then the Lord revealed
[1:26:08] something to her and uh as she got quiet
[1:26:10] before the L Lord showed her say you
[1:26:12] know what he's out of sorts because he
[1:26:14] don't have any customers he got
[1:26:17] customers in the in the in the office
[1:26:19] but uh he needs specific customers for
[1:26:21] his type his his side of the business
[1:26:23] and he don't have any so he's a little
[1:26:25] frustrated he's worried and he don't
[1:26:26] know how this how these things going to
[1:26:28] happen so she so she said um she said
[1:26:31] the Holy Spirit uh just begin to
[1:26:33] minister that to her and and when when
[1:26:35] the Holy Ghost said that to her you know
[1:26:37] there was another thought that
[1:26:40] came
[1:26:42] amen and now if y'all if y'all message
[1:26:44] Believers y'all already know what the
[1:26:46] next thought
[1:26:48] was
[1:26:52] huh that's the thought
[1:26:55] and that's the thought came to her you
[1:26:57] can give him
[1:26:59] customers because brother bradam said if
[1:27:01] your brother needed
[1:27:03] rain y'all y'all must have forgot that
[1:27:06] quote if your brother needed rain you
[1:27:08] could give your brother rain so I give
[1:27:11] you
[1:27:17] customers that's going on the
[1:27:20] offense right that is not just sitting
[1:27:22] back and just letting the devil just run
[1:27:24] rough if this man don't get business
[1:27:26] then it's going to shut down his
[1:27:27] business it's going to impact my
[1:27:31] paycheck so I I realize what your need
[1:27:34] is and without you even asking I give it
[1:27:37] to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[1:27:41] and maybe one day when he see all the
[1:27:42] customers overflowing in the office
[1:27:44] he'll be what happened
[1:27:47] here right there's a daughter of God
[1:27:50] working here actually two daughters of
[1:27:53] God working here
[1:27:54] right but but but but but but we got to
[1:27:56] recognize we we have the ability oh
[1:27:59] church I I hope this ain't going over
[1:28:01] our heads but we have the ability to
[1:28:03] change circumstances and situations and
[1:28:06] we do that with what comes out of our
[1:28:08] mouth that's why we got to drive back a
[1:28:11] gloomy
[1:28:12] [Music]
[1:28:14] Spirit
[1:28:16] Hallelujah so if you have a problem with
[1:28:18] uh that let's read John 20 verse 22-
[1:28:22] 23 amen John 20 through uh uh uh verse
[1:28:27] 22 and 23 look here it says and when he
[1:28:29] had said this he breathe on
[1:28:33] them and saith unto them receive ye the
[1:28:36] Holy Ghost and then the next verse says
[1:28:39] whosoever sends ye
[1:28:40] remit they are remitted unto them and
[1:28:44] whoever whosoever sins ye retain they
[1:28:46] are
[1:28:48] retained so a Son of God got a lot of
[1:28:51] power a daughter of God got a lot of
[1:28:54] power but it's untapped yes sir come on
[1:28:58] but we getting ready to step into this
[1:28:59] by going on the offense we stepping into
[1:29:01] everything God got for us amen all right
[1:29:05] let me uh move forward here this this
[1:29:08] this scripture back in Matthew 11:12
[1:29:10] from the days of John the Baptist until
[1:29:12] now the Kingdom of Heaven suffered
[1:29:14] violence and the violence taken by force
[1:29:15] I mentioned to you the theologians amen
[1:29:18] are not in harmony uh on the definition
[1:29:21] of that scripture they they just there
[1:29:23] theologians are just really really uh uh
[1:29:26] they're all over the place with with
[1:29:27] what they think it means and um you know
[1:29:30] I looked at it from the Greek Lexicon
[1:29:31] because you know the the first the
[1:29:33] kingdom of heaven suffered violence and
[1:29:35] then it say the violence the violent
[1:29:38] take it by force it kind of seem a
[1:29:40] little uh confusing but when you look at
[1:29:42] it from the Greek uh lexicon the
[1:29:44] suffering violence is amen it's is to
[1:29:47] inflict force on to apply Force I mean
[1:29:51] you you think about uh John the Baptist
[1:29:53] they appli by force amen they they call
[1:29:57] um I mean the the the the the
[1:29:59] daughter-in-law I'm I'm sorry the the
[1:30:00] stepdaughter comes and dance before
[1:30:02] Herod and uh he offers half of his
[1:30:04] kingdom and and then the man had his
[1:30:06] head taken from him but now he had to go
[1:30:08] through that because John made a
[1:30:10] statement before he went through he says
[1:30:11] I must decrease so that he can increase
[1:30:15] so John had to go off the scene
[1:30:18] Hallelujah there's some things that have
[1:30:19] to happen y'all understand we we can't
[1:30:22] complain about everything some things
[1:30:24] have to happen glory to God so so rather
[1:30:27] than complaining sometimes we need to
[1:30:28] just start thanking God for what's
[1:30:31] happening and he gives you strength to
[1:30:32] endure whatever it is that you're facing
[1:30:34] that's the truth brother amen right but
[1:30:36] but they use Force they they apply Force
[1:30:39] to inflict violence on that's that's
[1:30:41] what suffering violence is and and also
[1:30:44] um when it say the violent take it by
[1:30:46] force that means the strong uhuh oh my
[1:30:49] God Amen the the forceful the strong
[1:30:52] amen we going to take it by force we we
[1:30:55] going to endure this thing we not going
[1:30:56] to give up we not going to quit we going
[1:30:58] to break through in this right the the
[1:31:00] the the strong they take it by force now
[1:31:03] I also brought to you the emphatic
[1:31:06] diaglot of that uh that same scripture
[1:31:09] says in from the days of John the
[1:31:10] immersive till now the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:31:13] has been forcibly aell and the violence
[1:31:15] seiz it and when that that word forcibly
[1:31:18] aell means that it's been strongly
[1:31:20] criticized the Kingdom of Heaven has
[1:31:23] been strongly criticized we are going
[1:31:26] through that right
[1:31:28] now strongly criticized this message
[1:31:30] that we believe is strongly criticized
[1:31:33] but it's going to take some strong
[1:31:36] folk it's going it's going to take some
[1:31:38] I mean some and and I'm going just put
[1:31:40] this way it's going to take people with
[1:31:41] a revelation to be able to stand against
[1:31:44] everything that they're they're trying
[1:31:46] to inflict upon us and and and I I I I
[1:31:49] came to this conclusion about Revelation
[1:31:51] either you have it
[1:31:55] or you
[1:31:58] don't thank God for that we got it thank
[1:32:02] God we got it here you know I was
[1:32:05] meditating on this scripture even though
[1:32:07] the theologians can't seem to agree on
[1:32:11] what it means I start meditating and I
[1:32:13] was looking amen at a couple examples of
[1:32:16] people who suffered violence or
[1:32:19] opposition but they fought back they
[1:32:21] took it by force act 4 let's look at
[1:32:24] this Acts 4: 29 through
[1:32:28] 31 amen acts 4:
[1:32:31] 29-31 it says this now the disciples are
[1:32:35] are going through amen a tremendous
[1:32:37] trial man they been they they just being
[1:32:40] uh attacked because of their their their
[1:32:43] they standing with Christianity standing
[1:32:45] with Christ and and here you know they
[1:32:47] they are they've been told Don't Preach
[1:32:48] no more in the name of Jesus now you
[1:32:50] know we we really in the same spot today
[1:32:55] you you can't pray in public in the name
[1:32:58] of Jesus I mean they they let you say
[1:33:01] father Son and Holy Ghost but as soon as
[1:33:03] you put Jesus on
[1:33:04] it they got a problem with that I mean
[1:33:08] there's an attack on the name of Jesus
[1:33:10] we got to fight to hold to the name of
[1:33:13] Jesus because there's power in the name
[1:33:16] of Jesus right Deliverance is in the
[1:33:18] name of Jesus but but but here you know
[1:33:20] they're they're being attacked because
[1:33:22] they're preaching in the name of the
[1:33:23] Lord and it says and now Lord behold
[1:33:26] their
[1:33:27] threatenings and Grant unto thy servants
[1:33:30] that with all bonness my God my God my
[1:33:34] God we want to be strong in this hour
[1:33:36] that that with all boldness they may
[1:33:39] speak Thy word glory to God by
[1:33:42] stretching forth thine hand to heal and
[1:33:45] that signs and wonders may be done by
[1:33:47] the name of thy holy Child Jesus the
[1:33:50] Bible say and when they had prayed the
[1:33:52] place was shaken where they were
[1:33:54] assembled together and they were all
[1:33:56] filled with the Holy Ghost and they
[1:33:58] spake the word of God with boldness amen
[1:34:02] they were they were the Violent were
[1:34:04] taking it by force glory to God doing
[1:34:07] everything in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:34:10] Christ amen here we find amen also in
[1:34:13] scripture glory to God I want to just
[1:34:15] bring a couple uh examples in but when
[1:34:18] when when you know the violent taking
[1:34:21] them by force was strong they they they
[1:34:23] have to you know they have to stand up
[1:34:25] amen they got to be strong and and and
[1:34:27] the way that they're attacking this
[1:34:29] thing they they my God they got to be
[1:34:31] forceful strong amen I thought about
[1:34:34] David amen and and David was uh
[1:34:37] constantly under attack Hallelujah not
[1:34:41] only under attack there was a a
[1:34:43] scripture that we read and amen I I
[1:34:45] don't have it in front of me right here
[1:34:47] but uh I think it might be 1st Samuel 22
[1:34:51] U there's a scripture that I read but
[1:34:52] but but there was um the the Bible makes
[1:34:56] a statement that uh God had brought
[1:34:59] David rest with his enemies and with
[1:35:03] Saul now now now now and and I don't
[1:35:06] have it in front of me if it if it if
[1:35:08] you see that in 1 Samuel 221 just just
[1:35:10] throw it up there for me but uh but it
[1:35:12] said that um that that God had given him
[1:35:15] victory over all his enemies and with
[1:35:19] Saul and I like that because the the
[1:35:21] Lord just kind of you know me and my
[1:35:23] wife got the talking about it after I
[1:35:25] had read it you know there in Canada and
[1:35:27] uh what what happened was that um when
[1:35:29] the scriptures say and with Saul that
[1:35:32] means Saul was not David's
[1:35:36] enemy Glory no no no his enemies were
[1:35:39] the Philistines but Saul was his brother
[1:35:42] that's right brother glory to God but
[1:35:45] but but here's the thing is that
[1:35:46] sometimes we go through trials within
[1:35:49] the
[1:35:50] church and sometimes those trials are
[1:35:52] greater but we got to understand that
[1:35:54] when we're going through a trial in the
[1:35:55] church that our brother and our sister
[1:35:57] is not our
[1:35:59] enemy glory glory glory glory amen no no
[1:36:04] our enemy is the devil but these are our
[1:36:07] brothers and sisters and it's okay that
[1:36:08] we might amen we might differ sometimes
[1:36:11] we might disagree sometimes but we're
[1:36:14] not enemies one to another don't ever
[1:36:16] let the devil make you think that one of
[1:36:18] your brothers your own brother your own
[1:36:21] sister that's not your enemy amen amen
[1:36:24] amen
[1:36:25] W amen no don't let the devil get you to
[1:36:28] think something like that am right amen
[1:36:31] but but but but God had given him
[1:36:33] Victory and and David you know many
[1:36:35] times went through various things but uh
[1:36:38] I remember one time where David was uh
[1:36:40] was just waiting in a particular battle
[1:36:43] and God told him say now don't go up in
[1:36:45] this battle you know don't don't don't
[1:36:47] go up I want you to wait until you hear
[1:36:49] the rustle in the malbear tree before
[1:36:51] you move forward in the battle and and
[1:36:54] sometimes you got to learn how to just
[1:36:55] wait on the Lord but once David heard
[1:36:57] the rustle and the mberry tree it was no
[1:37:01] longer defense mode now it was
[1:37:04] offense amen somebody going to hear a
[1:37:07] Russell in the mberry tree amen you
[1:37:09] going to hear God moving that means god
[1:37:11] already went before you no longer do you
[1:37:13] have to set on defense it's time to move
[1:37:17] in an offensive position yes
[1:37:19] amen when they when when when when when
[1:37:22] Caleb was there and you know they going
[1:37:25] through the Wilderness and they've been
[1:37:27] wandering that Wilderness for multiple
[1:37:29] years and uh finally they get to a spot
[1:37:32] amen where Cale said you know I'm I'm
[1:37:34] tired of just going from Mountain to
[1:37:36] Mountain and and doing this no no no no
[1:37:39] no I Moses made me a promise Oh Glory
[1:37:43] Glory Glory Moses made me a promise and
[1:37:46] that promise is not come Amen to pass
[1:37:49] yet so since it hasn't come to pass yet
[1:37:52] I I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm laying claims on
[1:37:55] what God has promised me he say today
[1:37:57] give me this mountain I'm not taking
[1:38:00] another Mountain I I want Mount heam
[1:38:03] that's what Moses promised me he say I'm
[1:38:06] going up I don't care how many Devils up
[1:38:08] on top of is to try to stop me how many
[1:38:10] Giants up there if God made me a promise
[1:38:13] through the mouth of Moses then I'm
[1:38:14] going to take this mountain and Mo and
[1:38:17] Kaleb moved from a position of Defense
[1:38:20] amen into a position of offense when he
[1:38:23] said give me this mountain
[1:38:27] amen Joshua spoke amen uh to the son in
[1:38:31] Joshua chapter 10 that was a offensive
[1:38:33] move now I want to I want I want you to
[1:38:36] understand something an offensive move
[1:38:37] happens when you open up your mouth and
[1:38:40] begin to speak yes sir
[1:38:42] amen yes sir you know a Son of God and a
[1:38:45] daughter of God Amen has that type of
[1:38:48] power in them where they can speak and
[1:38:52] their words are B acted by almighty God
[1:38:56] Heaven backs up what you
[1:38:58] say glory to God so Joshua spoke to the
[1:39:02] son in Amen in Joshua chapter 10 and and
[1:39:05] and I like to say this was an offense of
[1:39:07] move to open your mouth and speak as
[1:39:09] always an offensive move glory to God
[1:39:13] Moses spoke and God honored it the
[1:39:15] prophet spoke to a storm and God honored
[1:39:19] it right amen he was in a defensive
[1:39:22] position when brother Brandon was
[1:39:23] running from the Colorado Storm

[1:39:28] safety and he said I you know I I got to
[1:39:30] get out of here before I get stuck up
[1:39:33] here and he's running and then the holy
[1:39:34] spirit said no turn around and go back
[1:39:37] into the storm now now now now now now
[1:39:40] when he does that he's moving from a

[1:40:29] when brother Brandon spoke to the storm

[1:40:33] from the storm but he moved into an
[1:40:35] offens offensive position when he spoke

[1:41:01] I and and and I call it I uh but it's AI
[1:41:06] is a is a spell spelling of it AI but I
[1:41:09] I just pronounce it as I
[1:41:12] now Josh was told by God that they no
[1:41:16] man would be able to stand before
[1:41:18] them in battle I mean no matter who what
[1:41:21] battle they went brother brandom say
[1:41:23] they they didn't even need a Red
[1:41:25] Cross because God was with them right
[1:41:29] and they were not supposed to lose any
[1:41:30] anybody in in uh in battle as they went
[1:41:34] out to fight I now the children of
[1:41:35] Israel went up and they searched out the
[1:41:38] land and say you know it's really not
[1:41:39] that many inhabitants and I just give us
[1:41:42] 3,000 men we'll go up here and wipe this
[1:41:43] out now it's it's something about how
[1:41:45] they got a lot of confidence or even
[1:41:48] overconfident when they came up against
[1:41:51] I oh my
[1:41:53] now you know uh because I I don't think
[1:41:57] it's by chance that we also have a a new
[1:42:01] battle today with
[1:42:04] I
[1:42:06] AI we got a battle with artificial
[1:42:11] intelligence oh
[1:42:13] hallelujah amen there there there's a
[1:42:15] spirit here and you know and and what
[1:42:18] what uh you know the children of Israel
[1:42:20] you know they got overconfident when
[1:42:22] they come against IE now now I want to
[1:42:25] say I think people today may be getting
[1:42:27] a little
[1:42:29] overconfident you know let me just kind
[1:42:31] of talk about this just for a little bit
[1:42:34] right you know but but but uh you know
[1:42:36] yesterday while I was up there in uh St
[1:42:39] Augustine and and and and coming back
[1:42:41] home there was a sister first first
[1:42:43] brother brother Brooks that made a
[1:42:44] statement that he was preparing a sermon
[1:42:47] on this on this AI he he like Lord just
[1:42:50] give me something on this AI because I
[1:42:52] know there's something here it why would
[1:42:53] it be in the Bible as Ai and then today
[1:42:57] it's a major
[1:43:00] technology you know uh and I'mma just
[1:43:03] try to I'mma say this in in in in a in a
[1:43:06] balanced way if I can AI is here to
[1:43:10] stay true there's nothing you can do to
[1:43:14] stop it that's right if you got a phone
[1:43:17] you dealing with
[1:43:19] AI when you pick up your phone and say
[1:43:22] Hey Google
[1:43:23] yeah here here's the problem with it
[1:43:26] when you say hey Google and and Google
[1:43:28] gives you an answer you take whatever
[1:43:31] Google say as the answer now when it
[1:43:34] come to spiritual things you can't trust
[1:43:38] AI you guys to still go back to your
[1:43:41] Bible and pick up your Bible to see what
[1:43:44] the Bible says not what Google says Hey
[1:43:47] Alexa all of that is AI and and here's
[1:43:51] the other thing that I I come to real
[1:43:53] realiz about this is that I can just be
[1:43:55] having a basic conversation in my
[1:43:58] house I mean I'm just talking about just
[1:44:00] random things in my house and when I
[1:44:02] pick up my phone my phone trying to give
[1:44:05] me
[1:44:06] [Music]
[1:44:07] data did you have a question about this

[1:44:12] does this phone know what what else are
[1:44:15] they listening to
[1:44:19] hello I mean they say that this is an
[1:44:21] invasion of privacy
[1:44:23] what else are they listening to when
[1:44:25] when your phone can operate like that
[1:44:28] and then you get your whole house
[1:44:29] operating you I mean we got hey turn on
[1:44:31] my lights and hey do this and hey I mean
[1:44:34] it's just doing everything hey crank my
[1:44:40] car come on

[1:44:55] everywhere just just just I mean my
[1:44:57] can't go
[1:44:59] nowhere we get to dependent on
[1:45:03] this we get to really dependent on it
[1:45:06] the sister was telling me after brother
[1:45:08] brother um uh uh Isaiah made the the
[1:45:11] comment there you know he said Lord I'm
[1:45:13] looking for a sermon on this because I
[1:45:14] know there's something here for for this
[1:45:16] this technology to be here and then we
[1:45:18] see this in the Bible as well there's
[1:45:19] something here and he said he said he
[1:45:22] said Lord so so just say uh you know I
[1:45:24] was I I'll never forget their name cuz

[1:45:43] telling me she say she works in the
[1:45:44] school system and she has to do
[1:45:47] detention and uh they have to write down
[1:45:49] why some of the kids are coming into
[1:45:51] detention and um and and they come to
[1:45:54] find out that kids are in the school
[1:45:58] taking tests through
[1:46:01] AI which basically means they
[1:46:06] cheating come on now you know back in
[1:46:09] the day if you had uh you know you had a
[1:46:12] very smart friend especially in college
[1:46:14] what they would do is get their friend
[1:46:16] to go to the class to take the test for
[1:46:18] them and and and and now a professor
[1:46:20] going to know that ain't you there
[1:46:21] taking that test oh Hallelujah can I I
[1:46:25] mean can I tell on
[1:46:28] myself back in my day we didn't have
[1:46:31] this AI stuff but but back in my day I
[1:46:33] remember there was a project that they
[1:46:35] needed in class and I did not want to do
[1:46:38] the project it was it was putting this
[1:46:40] together and putting that together I
[1:46:41] don't want to do none of that so you
[1:46:44] know it just so happened that there was
[1:46:47] a uh a project that a kid did and they
[1:46:52] they had got a raid on it and then threw
[1:46:54] it in the trash I said well look at
[1:47:02] this what a
[1:47:05] blessing I'm being set up by the
[1:47:09] devil so I went into the garbage got the
[1:47:13] project got the garbage went to class
[1:47:16] and turned it in like boy this a go
[1:47:19] ahead and get a grade on this the
[1:47:21] teacher went all through the grade and
[1:47:23] then called my house and say uh you know
[1:47:26] to talk to said said Jack submitt this
[1:47:28] project but it wasn't his and told my
[1:47:30] parents and they said Jack you did this
[1:47:33] um somebody had threw it away and and I
[1:47:35] I I submitted it and uh so the teacher
[1:47:39] teacher said uh teacher said you want to
[1:47:41] know how I know it's not
[1:47:43] Jack because I'm the one graded it and I
[1:47:46] put the grade on the bottom of it he
[1:47:48] didn't see that he thought it was on the
[1:47:51] top but it was on the bottom and and he
[1:47:53] didn't realize I already graded this
[1:47:54] this this is not his work I'm busted
[1:47:58] nothing I can do see look let me just
[1:48:00] tell you something whether I whether it
[1:48:02] was cheating back in my day it was wrong
[1:48:05] amen and for the young people trying to
[1:48:07] use AI for a test today that is
[1:48:10] wrong praise the Lord amen uh it should
[1:48:13] not replace your you trying to learn and
[1:48:16] what they trying to teach you so that
[1:48:17] you can learn right don't let AI do that
[1:48:20] but but but people using this AI Tech
[1:48:22] technology for a lot of wrong things and
[1:48:24] and like I say it's here to stay it's
[1:48:26] not going to change I don't mind asking
[1:48:28] Google for
[1:48:29] directions sometimes I get lost out
[1:48:32] there sometimes Google don't even know
[1:48:34] where they
[1:48:36] going it's the truth in high you you
[1:48:39] better know the roads yourself the GPS
[1:48:42] will drop you off in the middle of a
[1:48:43] field
[1:48:47] somewhere man we was there in Canada and
[1:48:49] I'm like uh I don't see no no buildings
[1:48:53] nowhere around it's just a big corn
[1:48:55] field say brother you say the church out

[1:49:00] bridge that's broken and I'm like hey
[1:49:02] hey hey

[1:49:07] it like that you it's going to take the
[1:49:09] Holy Ghost to be able to lead you if you
[1:49:12] always constantly going to Ai and never
[1:49:15] going to God you'll never be led by the
[1:49:21] spirit we got to watch this
[1:49:24] sir sometime it's so easy here here here
[1:49:28] here you know when the children of
[1:49:29] Israel were facing Ai and say oh this
[1:49:32] ain't nothing you know we we only got
[1:49:34] ain't that many people there they got
[1:49:36] overconfident and they went out to face
[1:49:38] and then here in this battle where they
[1:49:40] was overconfident they lost 36 men now
[1:49:43] now when they lost these 36 men uh I
[1:49:46] want us to just kind of get something
[1:49:50] here brother Brandon makes a statement

[1:50:16] certain things we done lost but we
[1:50:17] didn't have to lose
[1:50:19] it sometimes it's the way that we handle
[1:50:21] situations
[1:50:23] it was a way that we we we you know I
[1:50:25] would just say just a lack of
[1:50:28] wisdom it's the truth in high amen a
[1:50:32] lack of
[1:50:33] maturity amen we lost some situation
[1:50:36] there's certain people that don't go to
[1:50:37] church no more because of the way that
[1:50:38] we handled
[1:50:40] it oh y'all ain't going to say Amen but
[1:50:42] it's the truth in the high people people
[1:50:45] out there just wandering in darkness

[1:51:42] but I has to die yes sir
[1:51:46] amen look at this now watch this brother
[1:51:50] brandom says why did they die
[1:51:53] why why did why did Joshua Le lose these
[1:51:55] 36 men why did they die innocent men he
[1:51:59] says because one man stepped out of the
[1:52:03] line this is why we got to get back in
[1:52:08] Step what because one man one man and
[1:52:12] you know if you ever read the scripture
[1:52:13] in this in in in Joshua 78 you'll see
[1:52:16] that the scripture says that Israel
[1:52:19] partook of the cursed things not Israel
[1:52:23] it was one man in Israel that did that
[1:52:26] now now now the problem is is that that
[1:52:28] one man doing it he actually identified
[1:52:30] the whole group oh Lord Jesus your your
[1:52:35] actions your reactions your your
[1:52:39] behavior your misbehavior it affects all
[1:52:41] of
[1:52:43] us I want to make that very clear right
[1:52:47] I mean uh you you you your your mis
[1:52:50] whatever you decide I'mma just do this
[1:52:51] no no no that affect all of us you go
[1:52:55] out there and you steal something you

[1:53:03] to you done lost your temper you done
[1:53:06] kill somebody they want to know what
[1:53:08] church you go to right that affect all
[1:53:11] of us and now they got me on the news
[1:53:13] that do they go to your church
[1:53:20] H see you got to get control of
[1:53:23] yourself the the the the words you allow
[1:53:25] to come out of your

[1:53:58] me praise the Lord because one man
[1:54:01] stepped out of the line you see the
[1:54:04] reason this needs to be taught this

[1:54:36] 36 amen don't don't get hung up on the
[1:54:39] message because he
[1:54:41] misquoted amen he said I think it could
[1:54:43] be more yeah you're right it's 36 that's
[1:54:45] the Bible he said I believe it was 16
[1:54:48] men that was dead it says Joshua called
[1:54:50] said there's something wrong God made
[1:54:52] the promise and something's wrong when
[1:54:54] we bring the sick up before us and they
[1:54:56] fail to be healed we need to call a
[1:54:58] solemn
[1:55:00] fast calling assembly something's wrong
[1:55:02] somewhere God made the promise God's got
[1:55:05] to stick to the promise and he will do
[1:55:08] it so here once they you know they they
[1:55:11] went through and they start going tribe

[1:57:20] and look at the scripture uh God said
[1:57:22] don't take anything but actually on the
[1:57:24] next battle God said y'all can have
[1:57:26] everything but the tithe was the first
[1:57:28] thing that belonged to God he stole the

[1:57:50] discovered the problem they could stand
[1:57:52] before the enemies until they took away
[1:57:54] the cursed things and aching when he
[1:57:55] finally
[1:57:57] confessed uh his family even got stoned
[1:58:00] to death that's that's the sad part your
[1:58:02] sin can impact others in your
[1:58:07] family here they finally come up with a
[1:58:09] uh uh they're in defense mode and when
[1:58:13] they when they finally you know in
[1:58:14] defense mode they done lost 36 men so
[1:58:16] they running for their life they don't
[1:58:18] even know what to do and this supposed
[1:58:19] to been a group that they should have
[1:58:20] took out easily now now they running for
[1:58:22] their life and but when God finally had
[1:58:25] you know he told Joshua get up stop
[1:58:26] praying ain't no sense of you praying to
[1:58:28] me aan did this you find out what need
[1:58:30] to be done and you get rid of that sin
[1:58:31] out of the camp and they got rid of aen
[1:58:33] and his family and now God gives them a
[1:58:36] new strategy and they go out to battle
[1:58:39] glory to God and when they go to battle
[1:58:41] against I uh God said now y'all going to
[1:58:44] go out like y'all normally did the first
[1:58:45] time and then here come the Army come
[1:58:48] rushing down out of eye to come after
[1:58:50] them to to attack say oh we going to get
[1:58:51] them again they ran from us the first
[1:58:53] time we going to have them on the run
[1:58:54] again but Joshua had set an ambush that
[1:58:58] once they leave amen I I want y'all to
[1:59:01] go in and set the place on fire glory to
[1:59:05] God and uh and when y'all set the place
[1:59:07] on fire we'll see all the smoke and
[1:59:09] everything and and and then y'all come
[1:59:11] out of the city and we'll have this
[1:59:13] group surrounded glory to God so a uh
[1:59:15] Joshua said now the sign going to be
[1:59:17] when I point back the spear and they
[1:59:19] took off running and like they did the
[1:59:21] first time went up the eye they took off
[1:59:23] running and the Ambush was sitting there
[1:59:25] waiting on the sign and when they got
[1:59:26] the sign Joshua turned and pointed the
[1:59:28] spear glory to God say the fire start
[1:59:32] falling all over the place they set the

[2:00:18] said man I got to I got to inject this
[2:00:21] um
[2:00:22] David before he faced
[2:00:25] Goliath David had already
[2:00:29] fought a bear and he already fought a
[2:00:32] lion and look David was not on the
[2:00:35] defense when that bear came in and took
[2:00:38] one of his his his father's sheep David
[2:00:40] got up and went after that bear yes sir
[2:00:43] I mean the the the the bear already had
[2:00:45] the Sheep In His Hands and David didn't
[2:00:48] care nothing about that bear having a
[2:00:49] sheep and I'm coming to get the Sheep
[2:00:52] the the lion got it in the jaw I don't
[2:00:55] care nothing about you having it in the
[2:00:57] jaw I'm coming to get my daddy's sheep
[2:01:00] and David went after went after the bear
[2:01:02] and after the lion and got it back David
[2:01:05] went from a defensive position to an
[2:01:07] offensive position see I'm going tell
[2:01:10] you something what the devil got it got
[2:01:13] to mean more to you than it means to the
[2:01:18] devil I'mma say that again what the
[2:01:21] devil got got and he's taken from you
[2:01:23] got to mean more to you than it means to
[2:01:26] the devil if it means more to you then
[2:01:28] you'll go get it
[2:01:35] amen my child mean m to me my
[2:01:38] grandchildren mean Mor I'm coming after
[2:01:40] the devil to get what belong to me here
[2:01:43] in the message perseverance brother
[2:01:45] Brandon makes a statement here and it
[2:01:47] says um one day a bear came in and got
[2:01:51] one of his
[2:01:53] sheep and the Sheep meant a lot to
[2:01:57] him the Sheep meant a lot to him because
[2:02:00] he had learned to love that
[2:02:02] sheep and he loved it and so when the
[2:02:05] bear come in and got one David's heart
[2:02:08] began to burn when he heard that little
[2:02:11] sheep
[2:02:12] cry my God and God had sent him to watch
[2:02:16] those sheep and so when the bear caught
[2:02:19] the little lamb and it started crying
[2:02:22] David all at once remembered that the
[2:02:24] that the god that made the mountain was
[2:02:26] his God so he puts a rock in his little
[2:02:30] slingshot and went after this big
[2:02:34] Grizzly and it struck the grizzly and
[2:02:38] down he went now I'm going tell you
[2:02:40] something I don't know too many
[2:02:41] Grizzlies that GNA fall because a man
[2:02:44] hit it with a
[2:02:48] rock all I can tell you is there
[2:02:55] Rock their rock is not like our rock
[2:02:58] this was a different type of rock that
[2:03:00] David was throwing it says uh and a
[2:03:02] little slingshot went after the big
[2:03:03] Grizzly and it struck the grizzly and
[2:03:05] down he went then when he come back he
[2:03:07] was happy because he won the victory it
[2:03:11] says and then a bigger trial come
[2:03:15] in a lion Which is far more Fierce than
[2:03:19] the bear would be and he is more
[2:03:22] gang and and if I had time brother R say
[2:03:26] if I had time I'd like to break those
[2:03:28] animals down and show you the great
[2:03:30] Parable in there I say I wish the
[2:03:31] prophet would have had
[2:03:33] time I break those animals down and show
[2:03:35] you the great Parable in there and the
[2:03:37] lion come in and grab one and run off so
[2:03:39] if God could give him victory over the
[2:03:41] bear he could sure give him victory over
[2:03:43] the lion look at this one now watch this
[2:03:46] oh if God who can give me victory
[2:03:51] over myself it's time for I to die if
[2:03:58] God can give me victory over myself oh
[2:04:01] we ain't Lord we need we need to work
[2:04:03] right there you need to get victory over
[2:04:06] you exactly
[2:04:09] right you can tell when a person ain't
[2:04:11] got victory over their self they
[2:04:13] constantly making
[2:04:15] excuses as to why this and why that no
[2:04:18] no no no no no no you got to be able to
[2:04:21] own some

[2:04:38] go through things to try to show us

[2:09:43] not when I'm not a Christian can make me
[2:09:46] make a Christian out of me by believing
[2:09:49] his word this this is so important that
[2:09:51] we overcome us it's time for I to
[2:09:55] die I thought about this amen when I
[2:09:59] looked at
[2:10:01] uh this this the the the the the violent
[2:10:04] take it by
[2:10:05] force another little army that was just
[2:10:08] uh my God they were so they were so
[2:10:10] small but they were strong now I want to
[2:10:14] say something here and I'm I'm I'mma
[2:10:16] close this Army of
[2:10:19] Gideon they were uh they were first
[2:10:23] great in numbers they had about uh you
[2:10:27] know God first God you know comes to him
[2:10:28] with a prophet and says hey Gideon you a
[2:10:30] mighty man of Valor now Gideon when you
[2:10:32] look at him scripture he did not look
[2:10:34] like no Mighty Man of Valor he looked
[2:10:35] very weak right but he say you know
[2:10:38] you're a mighty man of Valor and it says
[2:10:40] um you know it says I'm going to use you
[2:10:42] Gideon and y'all G y'all G to break
[2:10:44] loose from the enemy I'mma use you he's
[2:10:46] like well you know if uh if God is with
[2:10:48] us then where is all his miracles
[2:10:52] he had a good question say where are all
[2:10:54] his miracles say get I'm going to show
[2:10:56] you I'm going to show you a few things
[2:10:57] I'm going to show you some Miracles now
[2:10:58] one of the Miracles that Gideon uh saw
[2:11:01] is that he went out there and he put a
[2:11:02] fleece before the Lord and he said now
[2:11:05] Lord if you with me let let all the
[2:11:08] Earth be wet and then this fleece be
[2:11:11] dry then I know that you're with me went
[2:11:13] out there the next morning all the Earth
[2:11:15] was W the fleece was dry I said no that
[2:11:17] could have been a chance that could have
[2:11:18] just been a chance I don't know all
[2:11:19] right I'm coming back out here now this
[2:11:21] time let all the Earth be dry and the
[2:11:24] fleece be wet it's like come out the
[2:11:26] next morning fleece was wet everything
[2:11:27] else dry sitting down look okay so get
[2:11:29] and I still know you got a problem
[2:11:33] believing I know you got a problem
[2:11:36] believing so I want you to do me a favor
[2:11:39] I want you to go down into the enemy's
[2:11:43] Camp I'mma say something here and I want
[2:11:46] you to hear what they saying about you
[2:11:48] down there in the enemy's camp
[2:11:51] and Gideon goes down there and takes one
[2:11:53] of his soldiers with him and they go
[2:11:54] down there and they they happen to just
[2:11:56] stumble upon a couple enemies talking
[2:12:00] and one guy talking to his friend he say
[2:12:03] I had a dream I had a dream and I saw
[2:12:07] this happen I saw this happen I saw this
[2:12:08] happen in the enemy's Camp I want y'all
[2:12:11] to catch this now I had a dream and and
[2:12:14] this happened and happen and and and and
[2:12:15] while he's telling the dream his buddy
[2:12:17] Rises up and say oh that I know the
[2:12:19] interpretation that that's swore to
[2:12:21] Gideon Gideon getting ready to come down
[2:12:23] here and defeat us all now here there's
[2:12:26] a thing that I want to say in the
[2:12:29] enemy's
[2:12:31] Camp the gifts were in
[2:12:42] operation I'mma say that again in the
[2:12:46] enemy's
[2:12:47] Camp they had dreams and interpret
[2:12:51] ations of Dreams in the enemy's
[2:12:55] camp and you going to tell
[2:12:57] me that we can't have it in this
[2:13:03] Camp if the enemy benefiting from that I
[2:13:08] mean that just imagine man say man that
[2:13:11] that's that's Gideon coming out we don't
[2:13:12] know what to do I me these guys probably
[2:13:15] ready to run for their life because they
[2:13:16] knew they was defeated it was already
[2:13:18] revealed to them sir what was getting
[2:13:20] ready to happen when and Gideon heard
[2:13:21] that he took so much courage man let's
[2:13:24] go on back down here we're going to run
[2:13:25] this God God going show the enemy
[2:13:27] already know we coming to defeat
[2:13:29] him you can imagine them telling that
[2:13:32] testimony all around the camp you can
[2:13:34] the people's hearts was they they were
[2:13:36] already defeated before they even
[2:13:38] started the
[2:13:40] battle their own gift defeated
[2:13:44] [Music]
[2:13:48] them I don't know if we got that one
[2:13:50] Church
[2:13:57] get and go back all all encourage yes
[2:14:00] sir oh we going to take him out and he
[2:14:02] had 32,000
[2:14:04] soldiers and God say uh
[2:14:07] Gideon you know uh your army a little
[2:14:10] bit too
[2:14:11] big your army a little bit too big he
[2:14:13] says I want you to break down this Army
[2:14:15] say anybody that got any fear any fear
[2:14:18] send them back home next to 22,00 th men
[2:14:21] leave just like
[2:14:23] that that much fear in the Army 22,000
[2:14:26] just walked away and and I wonder if God
[2:14:28] was
[2:14:29] to ask that question in this room how
[2:14:34] how many really want to go on the
[2:14:36] offense are how many just so afraid of
[2:14:38] the devil that they don't want no none
[2:14:40] of this
[2:14:42] battle and get up and
[2:14:45] leave here comes uh and and and so then
[2:14:49] then God say you got 10,000 left okay
[2:14:51] and Gideon I just need to tell you
[2:14:53] something your arm is still too
[2:14:56] big now you know I got some saying that
[2:14:58] they they ain't afraid but they this
[2:15:00] your arm is still a little bit too big
[2:15:02] he says now we're going to test this and
[2:15:05] I want you to just take them down to the
[2:15:06] water and let them drink some water and
[2:15:08] we're going the ones that get down and
[2:15:11] brother brand say they prostrated their
[2:15:13] face on the ground and they they was
[2:15:15] drinking water just prostrating on the
[2:15:17] ground like they was worshiping Idols
[2:15:19] that's what brother brand said prophetic
[2:15:21] Insight gives us this he said like they
[2:15:23] were just worshiping Idols this is what
[2:15:24] it looked like they were just worshiping
[2:15:25] idols and he says uh he says put them to
[2:15:28] one side he says but the other ones that
[2:15:30] get down and lap like dogs and when a
[2:15:33] dog when he laps he sticks his head in
[2:15:36] the water but he always
[2:15:38] looking you know so when they get down
[2:15:41] there and they got their head they
[2:15:43] always looking they always on
[2:15:45] guard right he said now when you get
[2:15:47] them that that pick it up like that put
[2:15:48] them to another side he say had
[2:15:53] 9,700 lapping like dogs I mean lap
[2:15:56] lapping like uh prostrate and then the
[2:15:58] other one over here lapping 300 over
[2:16:01] here he says now Gideon what I need you
[2:16:04] to do is take the
[2:16:06] 300 and go in the office yes sir
[2:16:11] Hallelujah and I I just these numbers
[2:16:14] right here just bless my heart um it was
[2:16:17] 135,000
[2:16:19] midianites that was getting ready to
[2:16:21] come against 32,000 Israelites the odds
[2:16:24] with that were 4 to one that mean I got
[2:16:27] to take out four of them and to to one
[2:16:30] one soldier got to take out four of them
[2:16:31] in order to win now when God say send
[2:16:34] the scare cats home it went to 10,000
[2:16:37] Israelites versus
[2:16:39] 135,000 and that mean I got to take out
[2:16:42] 13.5 to my
[2:16:46] one now God done put me to another test
[2:16:49] I'm down to 300
[2:16:51] and I got 135,000 minites that I'm going
[2:16:54] to face my odds are
[2:16:58] 450 to
[2:17:03] one almost seem
[2:17:06] impossible but with God's
[2:17:12] math
[2:17:14] one can chase a
[2:17:17] th000 and two will put 10,000 to flight
[2:17:21] and brother Solomon did the
[2:17:23] math he said just add another
[2:17:26] zero and if if three of us would get
[2:17:29] together we' take out a 100,000 and if
[2:17:32] four of us would get together 1
[2:17:34] million now the math ain't math and I
[2:17:36] can't I can't count the rest of
[2:17:39] it but I know when we all stand together
[2:17:42] we'll defeat
[2:17:43] [Music]
[2:17:48] Devils there in Gideon's AR me uh God
[2:17:52] defeated the enemy after you know he um
[2:17:55] he he developed a plan he heard the
[2:17:57] dream and interpretation the dream
[2:17:59] getting said let's go down here and we G
[2:18:00] to split the Army up and you know 100
[2:18:03] over here 100 over here 100 and said
[2:18:05] y'all just y'all just start banging on
[2:18:07] pots and pants and and just say the the
[2:18:10] sword of the
[2:18:12] lord always put God first the sword of
[2:18:15] the Lord and of Gideon sir see they they
[2:18:19] knew that Gideon was coming into that
[2:18:22] area the the they they knew by the
[2:18:24] interpretation of dream Gideon was
[2:18:26] coming so when he said the swore the
[2:18:27] Lord and of Gideon these guys knew they
[2:18:29] was finished
[2:18:32] 135,000 was only fighting
[2:18:35] 300 because Gideon was willing to go on
[2:18:37] the
[2:18:38] offense and let me just put it this way
[2:18:41] I don't care what your obstacle
[2:18:43] is if you're willing to take a step of
[2:18:47] faith and go on the offense I guarantee
[2:18:51] you will be
[2:18:55] [Applause]
[2:18:58] victorious if it's a job go on the
[2:19:01] offense if it's a car go on the offense
[2:19:05] if it's a healing go on the offense if
[2:19:09] it's your family restored go on the
[2:19:11] offense yes sir now some of that going
[2:19:13] on the offense might be you
[2:19:16] overcoming
[2:19:18] yourself it might start
[2:19:21] there but when you can move into that
[2:19:24] position you'll watch God begin to do
[2:19:26] things that you never thought that he
[2:19:27] could
[2:19:29] do God bless you Church praise the
[2:19:37] Lord amen let's have a word of prayer
[2:19:40] father we thank you for your
[2:19:43] word we thank you for this
[2:19:46] truth Lord as the the prophet uh made
[2:19:50] the
[2:19:52] statement Lord if we could just uh get
[2:19:56] victory over oursel the god that gave us
[2:19:58] the ability to get Victory o over
[2:20:01] ourself will also give us the ability to
[2:20:03] get victory over everything
[2:20:07] else father we
[2:20:09] uh we trust that this that that you Lord
[2:20:13] God would just help us to see what it is
[2:20:15] that you needed to
[2:20:17] see
[2:20:19] so Joshua they came against IE they lost
[2:20:23] 36 men because of the way things were
[2:20:25] handled by achen but oh God if we could
[2:20:28] just see
[2:20:29] father Lord that it was always your will
[2:20:32] for them to overcome I it's always your
[2:20:35] will but they had to take care of
[2:20:36] certain things before they could do it
[2:20:40] father it's the same thing with us God
[2:20:43] we got to overcome
[2:20:44] ourselves before we see victory in any
[2:20:47] other area in our life we have to
[2:20:49] overcome ourselves this offensive move
[2:20:52] sometimes is for us to
[2:20:55] die so help us Lord to Lord just hear
[2:20:58] the voice of the spirit amen speaking to
[2:21:01] us in our situations and
[2:21:04] circumstances we trust oh God that um
[2:21:07] Lord this this little series that you
[2:21:09] gave us we want to move from this
[2:21:12] defensive position father now to
[2:21:14] offensive position we've allowed the
[2:21:16] devil to run rough shot for a long time
[2:21:21] but oh God we're rising up as Sons and
[2:21:24] Daughters of God to claim our
[2:21:25] inheritance to claim our
[2:21:27] position and I trust oh God that it
[2:21:30] won't just be a a message Father that

[2:22:28] this this quote out of the series we
[2:22:30] would see

[2:22:38] brother's Footprints
[2:22:40] is
[2:22:42] possession ministering brother don't be
[2:22:44] afraid to put
[2:22:46] Footprints where God has told you to

[2:22:55] that's yours we got to move out

[2:23:09] Said and that's the
[2:23:11] truth no matter what the opposition is
[2:23:15] how great it seems and how difficult it
[2:23:18] seems if God said
[2:23:21] so it's
[2:23:23] yours when he gave it to Joshua he never
[2:23:26] said I'll take all the hav the
[2:23:28] Philistines and give it to you no that's
[2:23:30] not what God Said right it says um uh
[2:23:34] Joshua had to fight for every inch of
[2:23:38] ground but God was with him and every
[2:23:41] inch of ground you'll cover brother to
[2:23:44] make Footprints you'll fight your way
[2:23:47] through but take the sword of the spirit
