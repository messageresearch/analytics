cannot allow the world to dictate what we do we can't allow the things of the world to dictate where I love is and where our joy is we have to a man be hungry for the things of God a man if we're going to get into a little bit if we can now turn our Bibles there in Hebrews the seventh chapter we've been working in that and and III do things a little different the pastor has a really good teaching ability you know he put everything on the slide show and point everything out and that's on that really good is visual you know what I mean it's early but I don't have quite have that ability down yet so I just bring it how I bring it hey man but I just beautiful - wait a lord just kind of laid this upon my heart I wasn't really looking for just going about my daily tasks enough just enjoy last week man other wife got a chance to get away and the Lord just kind of led me to a number of messages that I were listening to and I just kept listening to this message over and over and over not knowing why then I went back and I began to study for this this uh this evening and as I read into I said will allow us see how he had been preparing all the time because everything just sort of fell into place so I trust that from the depths of my heart that I'm able to relay what he put he placed on my heart a man I'm just gonna I don't have a whole lot of notes and things like that you know but we're gonna just kind of walk through the Bible a little bit and just kind of both open up our understanding of the scripture just a little bit on these things and enlighten us and give us a little strength for the journey amen amen we've got a read from Hebrews - at a seventh chapter we notice paths have been working in this year for the past cup a couple of weeks a man but uh let's see where we go here it says for this Melchizedek king of Salem priest of the Most High God who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the Kings and blessed him to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of Salem which is king of peace without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor ending of life but was made like unto the Son of God abideth a priest continually now we know who that was he created God created a body a man now consider how great this man was on to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth of the Spoils and verily they that are the sons of Levi who received the office of the priesthood have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law that is of their brethren though they come out of the loins of Abraham but he who descent is not counted from from them receiveth the tithes of Abraham and blessed him that had the promise and without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better and here men that die receiveth sighs but there he receiveth them of whom it is witnessed that he liveth and as I may say so Levi also who received sighs pay tithes in Abraham for he was yet in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him if therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood for under it the people received the law what further need was there that another priest should arise after the order of Melchizedek and not be called after the order of Aaron I'm gonna read that again for he was yet in the loins of of his father when don't hesitate met him if therefore profession were by the Levitical priesthood for under it the people received the law for what further need was there that another priest should raise after the order of Melchizedek and not be called after the order of Aaron for the priesthood being changed there is made of necessity to change also of the law for he of who these things are spoken pertain it to another tribe of which no man gives attendance at the altar for it is evident that our Lord spring up out of Judah the tribe of pewter of the tribe Moses spake nothing concerning the priesthood and it is yet for more evident for that after the similitude of Melchizedek there arises another priest I want to concentrate their own fifteenth verse and it is yet for more evidence far more evidence for their after the similitude of melchizedek they arise it another priests Amen let's pray for a quick Lord Heavenly Father we read these scriptures of Lord God made you just give them life Lord God that would open our understanding Oh father God and even our revelation Oh father God and Jesus precious name Amen now we see here I want to bring attention to that world the similitude and similitude and in a dictionary we break that work now and it means a visible likeness it means it one definition is a visible likeness and another it may say an imaginative comparison and another it may say a point of comparison okay but I'd like to just stick with a visible likeness okay so we see that uh so we go back here to assimilate assimilate is the verb of similitude that means something that that is becoming like something else amen so our to to to come into the likeness of another being or spirit should I say now we see that before the foundation of the world here that there was a there was a there was a battle in heaven am i right there was a battle going on there was one who was not at that time Lucifer but he was Sun in the morning a man that and and iniquity had entered into his heart and and he wanted to be like the Most High God so the battle began in heaven and when when when he was cast down there the Bible tells us in Isaiah then that he he had a goal and he had a purpose his goal and his purpose was to be worshipped like the Most High okay thank God in the beginning he created these people to worship Him man he was God and he set things up in the order that he saw things in his mind to play out so that he can display file of his attributes a few years am i right amen so on the other hand now that it talks about how at that time not Lucifer that Satan was a very convincing fellow he was able to convince a third of the Angels a third of the angels to follow him now imagine not my brothers and sisters you have an angel in heaven that is there and they're worshiping the Almighty God and Lucifer is so sick that he can he can he can deceive angels to uni heaven so we're dealing with a shrewd character here we dealing with an individual are what better yesterday a man and he's ahe's he's the most beautiful angel he got all kind of tools in his chest yeah he was a great musician he had he there was nothing ugly about him a man he he was he was anointed cherubim okay so now we understand that the Bible all says you know in the beginning he created the heavens and the earth now the prophet of God said you must understand in your semicolons he said you must understand your semicolons because he when you when you read and it stops now we have no idea how long of a space of time from one event to the other okay so that we know okay he did this and then he did this but in between there's a space of time we don't know how long that was we don't know how long it was but we know that Moses a prophet was able to - to - to foresee and look back in time to be able to write those first four books of the Bible Moses wasn't there but he was able to write those first four books of the Bible okay so some would say that you know Moses was a special prophet because he was the first prophet and I would continue to say if the first prophet was a special prophet then the last prophet should be a special prophet just make sense amen because one was able to look back and seen from the beginning and one things beginning and this last one his job is to come and what tied up all the loose ends and look into the future and tell you and send everything going close everything up we got one who opened it up and that last prophet okay we're going to tie this up in a nice little boat so you can get out of here amen now we see that those angels come down they they had assimilated took all the lightness of Lucifer now we see that Lucifer came down and and there in the Bible there in the beginning he created the heaven and on earth and then he you know all of these things he created the the herb yield and grass and then banging me created all of the animals and he created all of these things he created and he created the other the last thing you created it was me now when he created the animals he created one are the rimmel my kid and he created the female monkey he created a males arriving in the female giraffe he created all these things he created the - so now Satan remember Satan was already cast over so he's just watch he's a man he's gone all of these things I see what he's gone but I came into that now remember he created the serpent as well he created the serpent and this was so big was not a snake at the time he was not something that sliver alone he was a beast the Bible called him a beast that walk upright on two feet I'm all right what up I threw the guard now he gave Adam dominion over everything he told him to name it so I think I'm guessing them Adam Lester came to the circuit and say hello I will call you you two beasts I don't think in Lane with the serpent until a fee was cursed okay mr. surrett how you doing Dada Dada da you got your place and diet and you know he went all through the body he was just like any other animal all the differences he had a place for soul but he didn't have a soul he was the closest thing to bed he was the closest thing to man okay all upright and everything he was able obviously able to communicate okay we see now that some time he still have some animals have some form of being able to communicate I can tell my dog to do certain things and here doing he can't talk back then he seems like he can get my attention every now and then my dog want to be fed he'd know what a certain time you go I start moving that bowl around and my wife said your doll talking to you and say hey I'm gonna go feed him so they have some ability okay so but this serpent uh-uh-uh-uh-uh was the closest thing to mankind so this double sit back watch him and you say well well well how can i oh similarly into this culture because he he was he was just the being a spirit he had no way to get anybody but he's playing like I said it was to be worship like the Most High so he wanted a people to worship him now at the time he didn't happen but that was his goal in displaying all the time that he's the kid of people to worship Him who he said back there watching me say now I noticed that he made the female giraffe in the male giraffe and the Bell had a monkey in the female dog and the male darling is that but I've noticed with his type of man he did something a little bit different he just made one well what's happened here then all of a sudden he'd put that from to sleep and he took something real Adam and any any and any name of a female body took the feminine spirit from Adam and and and gave it to the female so he began to look at this thing and he say wow I might have something here because anything any time that you look at that Satan notices God giving a certain thing just a little more attention oh he pays really close attention today he pays very close attention to you because he said what I have this fellow in the part of my hand I had this person in my will my head of day he was down and out and all of a sudden here come God who picks them back up there may have been a time when when Satan that set a trap for you on the highway and the accident and all of a sudden you called on the name of God and got out of it then he say missed them again so he notices that there's something special about you so he pays special attention to you because he know that there's something that God has a plan for you so he'll look like this right here in Adam and Eve and a and indeed so no doubt Eve would go out you know trusted me Garden distance beautiful pace had not a care in the world speak to all of the animals and come across mr. serpent hello good morning mr. serpent how you doing no doubt the sermon indeed had plenty of conversations have plenty of conversations there was no problem with it he was the serpent she hid they had romanian over the animals Adam he had dominion over the animals but one day he come this devilish sentry Lucifer all of a sudden incident to the heart of that servant and began to influence that serpent to do his will not as one big man he come in crossing along in the garden again and she's talking living things and all through sir not knowing that this day she's talking to the incarnated differ different man now he was being influenced by spirit same in that today he has a different influence now this leopard began to talk to eat he began to say things to eat like Oh Eve now I want you're going to happen she noticed this that the other thing there's a the male giraffes and have a female at the wrath and then there's a baby giraffe male monkey a female monkey baby monkey male Dolphy mother baby say well what's wrong with you and they began to convince Eve they say well why don't you you you take of this tree now we know that we're not talking about a literal fruit we know we're not talking about a literal fruit say well what's different about us a way to begin to tell we that shall not surely die but that'll be wise beyond and what happened Eve began to assimilate she began to assimilate the problems Eve went in the head they sat down and had Bible study because let me put it to you this way the devil came against the message of the hour he didn't come to even say he is the rain you don't have to get on that art no it what time for that year they have one word goatee of this tree he came to her attacking what the message is our to tell her that this is not true when it was the truth now instead of her going back to Adam she began to reason with inner self and the symbol eight so what this spirit was saying to her and she went back let's say she took on a preaching spirit she went back and preached to Adam Adam knew she was wrong what what you did this foolishness from what know that she had done messed up but Adam willfully took on the scene to save e willfully he wasn't the scene but he had assimilated took on the similarities took on the likeness of this influence that was talking to her and carved the whole world to go into a sinful nature prophet said it like this every time you see an ambulance every time you see a hearse blame that on e you can blame that on e-learning other hand you know we still live living in the glorious time because we still have a God that sits high look low and there is a plan of redemption a plan of reconciliation not now we move on I like to display a platform there showing that there are two spirits on the earth and they're the two spirits and see we we here in the middle and we're going to assimilate to one or the other take on the likeness of one or the other and how do we take on that likeness we'll see here is by faith it's by election it's by the Word of God let's look at something here let's turn to numbers the 13th chapter and we're going to look at another soldier amen and we're going to bring out some things on this road to hit it uh I might I tell you what just really blessed my soul a man numbers the 13th chapter we're going to start from the 25th verse and I won't be before you long we're just gonna speed right through this and now drop these little nuggets offering you something to think about a man and it reads on this wise it says let's see here let's start from the first verse I'm sorry and the last thing unto Moses saying since out men that they may search the land of Canaan which I give unto the children of Israel of every tribe of their fathers shaggy see and a man everyone a ruler among them okay and Moses by the commandment of the Lord set them from the wilderness of Paran all those me were heads of the children is room now I'm not going to just read all of them but I want to I want to pay close attention to the sixth verse and says of the tribe of Judah Caleb the son of Jupiter forgive my pronunciation if it's not correct now I'll be going to going over here to the 25th verse and it says and they returned from sup from searching the land after forty days and they went and came to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation of the children of Israel unto the wilderness of Paran and Kadesh and brought back word unto them and unto all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land and they told him and said we came unto the land whither thou sick us and surely it floweth with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it they brought back evidence they brought back the great that was so big it took two men to carry imagine that mine and he said nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land and the cities are wall and every great and and moreover we saw the children of the image and the children of the Amalekites dwell in the land of the south and the Hittites and the gentle sites and the other White's dwell in the mountain and the Canaanites where about a sea by the coast of Jordan Taylor steeled the people before Moses and he said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome now let me stop right there and quickly give a quick background we see now that we're up to this point here and Abraham had left the city that God told Abraham that he was going to give him they were going to have a child all right they were going to have a promised child her Sarah and-and-and-and-and the name there would be a blessed people okay and and and they go on and they have this child the God of Abraham but didn't have Isaac and then Isaac begat Jacob and then Jacob the twelve brothers his twelve sons and brothers and Joseph and then Joseph went into the Egypt and then they became slaves am i right that's in a nutshell okay so then arose the Pharaoh that knew not Joseph and they became slaves out in Egypt and they were down in slavery from what some four hundred years a man slave to the taskmaster so four hundred years they was down there under under bondage under bondage of Egyptian rule when they had a place that God had given them as an inheritance and this place was right here where all of these giants was but see they couldn't leave with nothing like that because they were being held in bondage now that bondage are I could've administered that bondage as today or could be a a sinful life and then again won't let you go it could be a denominational experience you just not have not have come to the knowledge of the truth as of yet amen but are these people in there being God's chosen people amen remember that they pray to ah that they could not see and Moses came alone born and raised in the house of Pharaoh to be the deliverer and he had to go through certain things that was had to leave and go to the house of Jeff room and he saw met with the pillow fight came back to deliver the people now he delivered the people now I want to stop here and I want to bring out that there's three stages of grace three stages of grace now and then this this this this price perfectly with what we was reading there and in Hebrews they asked a question I mean in the in there were or why obedient that we need another other than the tribe of Levi why we need another one like him to Melchizedek because he's a tribal Levi with a gate you know gate out of that came the law okay Moses had delivered them out and it's taken them to the mountain and with the finger of God had wrote the Ten Commandments and he gave it sort of air in the priesthood to add you know divine evidence say that the Levitical priesthood was supposed to be there for under the air held of the law amen but here was one coming that uh do not do away with the law thank you my brother but he is brought grace the three stages of grace a man they came here a man to this point and and and and Moses delivered them a man out of their bondage that was the first stage took them across the wilderness they came to a place at the Red Sea where he comes there's a sea in front of them and Pharaohs army coming behind them so surely destroy them and God delivered them by opening the Red Sea and walking out on dry land and they began as they got across out they see all of their troubles drown in the Red Sea now at that point Marion took a tambourine and begin to shout and praise God hello ray we free glory we've seen that's just like you you you you you confess your sins Lord you come the word came and preached my heart I turn my back on the devil and I walk out I walk out but I go to a place of the Red Sea and I get to a place where I have to become different sanctification I have to know that there's no way there's no poor back man and all of my my my old friends and the things that I'm used to see because over my life I had a simulating I had assimilated into the devil wanted me to be I had a simulated into the likeness of Satan I had a night not knowing not knowing but I had grew up around the inhabitants and I've seen this and I've seen this and I was taught this what was out of simile but now they came to me put the heart by the preaching of the gospel and I'm tired from my wicked ways I have begin to change my life becoming a simulator now I'm looking at something else I'm not looking at the world anymore I might focus of my attention you know God and I begin to love as I keep my eyes on him lowly's I feel it oh I begin to assimilate from what I was to what I he even wants me to be so I come to one stage and they came in you see oh I don't even have a desire to smoke well who but at one point I decided to go to the club every Friday night Saturday night hang out on the corner with the ball strike on Friday I had to decide every time I get off we got to stop Bob going get me a beer and go home but all of those desires I've fallen away don't even desire no more what what is it those things being drowned in the Red Sea so you begin to come to church and you realize to stop the government such an agenda go over the top hey thank you Jesus but you can't stay right paint it and stay right there they didn't set up camp on the other side of the sea we will stay here they were promised that land that place types the baptism of the Holy Ghost but they had to travel they had to continue to eat they haven't continue to be faithful they had to continue to be loyal and they came to continue to press into it now here we are they come to that land right up to the joy where they had to go through the joy Jordan type they're always there thinking take on the mind of God go over and possess their inheritance that laying that flow with milk and honey so go over they send these Caleb Joshua and ten others that go over Caleb and Joshua come back I'm always a good Lane Oh Caleb let us go all that once not a Bible tells us that other team came back with an evil report was it true yep but it was you why do you didn't see what Caleb and Joshua saw hey so be oh we can't do it he began to murmur and complain oh we rather go back the either peel the garlic watch after all he was done for you you still have no faith that God the same God that delivered you out of the bondage of Eden would deliver you and give you the land only - hey - think so those other team came back and did what they begin to preach against the message of the message of the hour was crossroad and take our lane and they began to spoil them love and folly spreading fear we're not able to do it they got walls and they spend 7 feet tall and you got their Malak Heights and the Hittites and all of these ones we didn't come this far to die they had no faith they had a simile assimilated how by fear by fear now I want to bring out caleb a man if I'm me amen Caleb steel the people rose and said we are more than able a man to take the land and all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried and the people wept that night and the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron and the whole congregation said unto them what God that we had died in the land of Egypt or with God we had died in the wilderness and wherefore has the Lord brought us into the land to fall by the sward and now wives and our children should be prayed where it not better for us to return unto Egypt you gotta be kidding me to return to the bondage and you just got through shopping because you're singing off not you trying to go back Lord Jesus if you don't see that today fear it's too hard I have to give up too much I can't overcome I can't overcome I can't beat this perfect image that everybody want me to be oh it's easier to just go to this church well they don't preach against my sin go over here where they don't put no pressure on me these people over here they too hard who you have an inheritance that God has given you don't settle for the devil's lie that you can't take it that's fear amen you're more than able you're more than evil and wherefore the Lord brought us into the land and followed by the swar okay and said one to another I listened and they said once we're gonna let us make us a chapter and let us return to eat it mighty raise them up little never feel appreciative raised and loved Lou preachers and they preaching let us go back to Egypt that's a message lord have mercy do you see it today same thing Moses and Aaron fell on and face before the assembly the congregation of the children of Israel and Joshua the son of nun caleb the son of Jupiter which were of them as search tool in rent their clothes and they spake unto all of the company of the children of Israel saying the land which we passed through to search it it is exceedingly good man if the Lord delighting us then he will bring us into this land and given us a lamp which flows with milk and honey now see now they got the baby got this Caleb and Joshua was preaching them know they now be got there no no brother no no that's not right he'll give it to us where's your faith hey many man let's go to uh amen Joshua 14 Joshua 14 a man I'm all wise up man and these other countries and may have which children of Israel inherited in the land I'll make sure I skipped a whole amen yeah and and these are the countries which gave the Canaan and the heads of the fathers of the tribe the children of Israel distributing foreign inherence to them by lot was inherited as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses for the nine tribes and a half for Moses had given an inherence of two tribes and a half tribe on the other side of Jordan Thank You Levites and gave non-adherence among them for the children of Joseph were two tribes and Manasseh and Ephraim and therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the land save cities to dwell in the suburban in their cattle and the LORD commanded Moses so the children of Israel did they divided the land in the children of Judah came unto Joshua and gal Garth and Caleb the son of juniper the Kenneth II said unto them down noah's the thing that the Lord has said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Kadesh forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh Barnea to spy out the land and I brought him word again that it were a word again as it was in my heart nevertheless my brother my brother when that went up with me me the heart of the people milk but I wholly followed the Lord my God and Moses where on that day saying surely the land were thy feet hath trodden shall be thine inheritance and thy children forever because thou has wholly followed the Lord o my god and now behold the LORD hath kept me alive as he said these forty in five years even since the Lord speak these words unto Moses while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness and now lo I am this day four score in five years o eighty five years old and yet I am strong this day as our worlds in the day of Moses sent me as my strength was then even so is my strength now for war both to go out and to come in now therefore give me this mountain wherefore the Lord spake in that day for thou gardens in the day of how the a naxaiites were there and that the cities were great in fence and if so be the Lord will be with me then I will be able to drive them out as the Lord said and Joshua blessed him and gave unto caleb the son of jennifer heparin for and inheritance hair brought therefore became the inheritance of caleb the son of juniper the kemacite and i would love to just bring to your attention caleb was a kemacite not a jew caleb was a Gentile but because he wholly followed the Lord he received an inheritance of the land that God had promised to the Jews he received an inheritance not that he would see hep wrong with him to it I've been sitting a little bit a little Oh father about heparin became a city of refuge help Ryan became one of the greatest cities in the Bible we see that it talks about damn we won't read it all but through marriage in Egypt his mother and father I think it was his father well the Kennison and his mother was a Jew and and and marinus they had Caleb so we see that it was through a marriage that he was simulated into the Jewish culture a man and through his faith a man he was given an inheritance do you see the title we a Gentile bride through a marriage through a relationship with God himself through a relationship of men we're being married that we will receive an inheritance not because of who we are not because of some great thing we do it because of who we're married to will receive an inheritance a reward eight man we see here that Caleb being a Gentile from was given lien in the tribe of not Judah the children of UDF I'm sorry was judo in Aqaba Judah Caleb a son or Jenna for the kids and I unto him that knows the thing of the Lord amen it was Judah amen what's given laying through the tribe of Judah so he was assimilated a man and and and and that's what we're doing that's what's happening to us today we had a prophet our LA either a man to come and introduce us to Christ a man and and you say you and you may wonder what do you mean introduce us to Christ he introduced us to the revealed Word of God because before all you could do is pursue and put little things together it was it was you it was eaten from manna from a day gone by but now we're eating fresh manna just like I said when when when when when he the devil is always going to come against what the fresh manna he's gonna come against the message of the hour he's not fighting the Catholic Church he's not fighting I would say Baptists anything ain't no fight that he got them I'm sorry to say but yeah now I'm not saying that there's some good people that just happened comes in another little truth yet just come to them out of the truth here and we're praying for Dave that there's some eagles among chickens there are some Eagles amongst those chickens they met so we keep them lifted up in prayer and we continue to be salted we continue to live a life before our brother in a man because it was not that we reached that nombe-la's but we know by this there was only two that had the revelation that had the faith to move forward amen let's go to amen I mean we're not gonna you're not gonna hang on let the devil cheat the 13th sorry 15th chapter xiii man I wrote it down for a reason and caleb the son of jennifer he gave a part among the children of Judah according to the commandment of the Lord to Joshua even the city of a bird the father of anak which city is heparin and Caleb drove this three sons of Anna and she and she who was she shot and a hey man and calamita the children of anak and she I mean and he went up dance to the inhabitants of the bird and the name of the bird before was yet a cockade her jets Schieffer and Caleb said he that smites tried it for sure and taking it to him will I give and my daughter to wife so yeah basically there are caleb was saying whoever go up witness will take this lamb I give my daughter to wife hey man let's go through uh can you pull up that Israel in them and the church 5303 twenty-eight paragraph 73-mile read a few things from then there will be done a man just to show a man that uh if we read there and remember we was we're talking about similar dilemma to celebrity similar to similitude and and and in Hebrews talked about why we needed one like not resident from the tribe of Judah and not the Levites now the Levites they kept the law but see when Christ came he brought grace but we understand those three stages of grace the oh the the Old Testament shadow when a type of the new we can't come out of bondage can't come out amen and and and and just stopped halfway we gotta go all the way now if I don't press nothing if you don't get enough you understand that you're going to have to fight it's gonna happen it's going to be a press over into that land that's wrong milk and honey in that land that flows is the baptism of the Holy Ghost say well without we have sealed unto the day of our Redemption the prophet of God gave that story about how we have the boxcar and in the end they pack this boxcar and and everything in there everything has to be tight everything has to be just right and once everything is just right you got those inspectors the Holy Ghost is the inspector you come through and he's shaking this and shaking that if it's not just right it won't it won't it won't make the ride it'll get to its destination and something to be broken something to be messed up because the ride is rough things are gonna happen but when everything is packed just right that door is shut and then there there's a seal put on that door and that seal cannot be broken I see if it might be broken so oh we continue like this like Jeremiah he said I go down to the potter's house and I'll show you a great work and you go down to the potter's house and he's on the wheel and the Potter he's on the wilderness spinning and he's he's he's making this this Basin and and and and if there's a flaw in that vase he don't just add mud he breaks the whole thing down and filled it up the king so if there's a something in our in our life that's just not quite right Lord bring me down and fill me up again break me all the way down and build me up again amen to where a man of my face of my vessel will hold the oil will be able to hold the holy or that I'll be presented before you without a spot or wrinkle a man can't we find it thank you a man I'm gonna let stay far from I think 73 they've now they come to the place called Kadesh Barnea now we want to study this a moment Kadesh Barnea was the judgment seat of the world in that date and you moving faster okay the seat but I think that's found 13th chapter of numbers and go to mark in the scriptures if you wish read previous chapters studying we just have to hit the high places now in there or move up because I'm reading off your screen here for four days places revival like this can't study at verse by verse but it was judgment see there was a great whale there had many little whales out of it from out from it the tributaries order Springs from the great huge spring Kadesh Barnea perfect type of the church the church is the judgment seat Church begins the judgment begins at the house of God okay Israel gathered around Kadesh and now Moses said here in the first verse 13 chapter and unto the Lord of straight Moses saying send me down me and some search plan go ahead I read all that can you move up now could now God ordained that they should send 12 me and over one out of each tribe sending them over into the land of Canaan to spy out the land to see whether it was good place or not these spies will come back down ok these five went forth out of every tribe one out of Danny Oh although until they got to the 12 men perfect of the dignity of the church today in our journey and we're journeying up till I believe that the church is standing today and Kadesh Barnea judgment now God helped me the church oh my god help me I hope God will help me get this it'll sink in good and deep singing our exploits remember they had come this far because God had promised them and all among the line they had signs and wonders and miracles and now they were right up to the borderland and I believe we're on that borderland tonight I was wondering about all my meetings of things how I had to cancel them out I truly believe before the church can have the rapture it's got to have rapturing faith we can't even have faith for divine healing let alone rapturing faith got to have faith that'll change and quicken this body and be taken away I believe there's a church on it's wrong tonight a power of the Living God that men will speak the word here and there and it'll flash like lightning and a church is coming out not a psycho psychologist not some put all make belief that way real true genuine anointed Holy Ghost called out church amen here they are standing at Kadesh Barnea they said go over the land give to us hundreds of years ago by God through our Father we are the seed of Abraham God has led us safe this forty some odd miles from Egypt up to the borderland that could dish they hit they had got up there in a few days but remember because of their unbelief made them wander for 40 years unbelief noticed the church I'm speaking of parabolic speaking what the old world the new is in the more magnified way what the church the church I mean what the natural world the spiritual is now Kadesh and there he said now you go out and spy out God seek them Moses never Moses never God seek them over and say go over and spy out the land and come back and tell us whether it is good land or a bad land or whether we can take it or what this what this that or the other you go over and find out and twelve went over you know about the harlot Rahab and so forth all right now we're getting into that the harlot Rahab they went over and cut this cluster of grapes of return back but listen at the report the 12 men and 10 out of the 12 said oh they are a fearful people look over here what what a sight listen to this when they will return over now to the 17th verse and the 27th 17th were called the 27th mercy says and tell their men that was sent out and when they returned back their hearts were fainting they said oh they're great man listen their hearts were fainting I'll read up I think we we read that if we go up go up go up and I find a good point okay keep going stop and brought up an evil report on the land which they had searched out for the children of Israel saying that the land which we have gone to search it is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof all the people that we saw are in it our men great stature listen to what those what goes on say that we like look like grasshoppers upside the way upside them that's the report but Caleb and Joshua said we can take it we are more than able to do it why are they able to do it God had promised them to do it he says I like that courage continue to continue on and uh ten of them now the church came and it's now to a place where come down through the Luther age and the Methodist age and the Pentecostal age and down to a place where now some of the Full Gospel people turn firmly against the divine healing the atonement where we got to go place friends where you you it's getting horrible out there old-time religion they say it's some time and passed long ago can't have it it's too much we're living in modern day and got to get modern ideas we got to have shuffle boards in the church ping pong games and everything the whole are all young people continue about their brother and sister if it ever gets to a time that I have to have a card party in the church to hold the audience our quick pitch in the gospel cuz it's lost its power I tell you brother that we need to date is an old-fashioned simple gospel Holy Ghost power preached in the Sun in its simplicity then if I be lifted up from the earth I'll draw all men unto me amen better or that a blessing amen amen let us stand amen musicians come hey man I know that that was pretty broke up but I hope was able to I tell you through a display the way my felt in the way but it came to me we're living in a time where the history is basically repeating itself we're living in a real precious time the prophets said that he believed that we're at that point tonight right there at a different is the last couple of Bible studies I have been noticed and even prior to that whether there is an emphasis on the baptism of the holy ghost their baptism of the holy ghost say well we can we can come out and we can we can repeat the sinner's prayer and that's great that mean we're on the journey we can go through the Red Sea where we're cleanse and our desires and things fall behind as we see those old temptations begin to die and we can feel the anointing and we can shout and we can have a good time we're not quite there yet but we must press on we must press on all the way into the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and if there's anything in that boxcar as the inspector the Holy Spirit and show it in our lives a man like that part on the wheel break me down and just make me over again as we come too far he promised us as a Gentile we see caleb had a faith that we are more than evil he didn't let fear get in his way he didn't let the doubters he didn't let what was going on around him to what what people were saying around him his heart we read that in the Bible he said his he came back and he confessed his heart it was in his heart to do right hey man it was in his heart to do right so if you feel a tug in your heart a man your greatest desire is to serve God with all that you know amen and we just ask him cuz he's gonna have to do it I mean we can't do it on our own I remember we just continued to stay before the Lord and can't continue to pray and then that just law continued to make the overlooking anything if there's anything in me that's not right Lord show it to me I make it right just continue to show me me and make me over again hey man amen let us pray
