appreciate you all uh today and uh while you all are standing uh in the presence of the lord we'll just read our scripture you know i was um i was gonna do something a little different but i guess that ain't gonna really work out so let me just let me unwire this amen um praise the lord god is good turn with me to uh revelation chapter 19. thank you uh revelation 19 and uh we are reading um i want to actually start at verse six amen on this praise god it feels so good just being here again there's nothing i like better than when god's children get together it feels so good just be in here again uh here revelation 19 um verse 6 says and i heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many waters and as the voice of mighty thunderings saying alleluia for the lord god omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and rejoice give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come you mean the lamb want to get married amen and not only did he want to get married but he found himself a bride ain't that something amen the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her it was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness a man of saints and he saith unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of god amen the lord of the blessing to the reading of his word shall we bow in a word of prayer father we are grateful for the privilege and the opportunity we have to stand in your presence uh we trust that the holy ghost would take complete control over uh our thought here today you would get all the glory and all the honor uh from it you would bless our uh coming together you would speak from heaven to our circumstances and situations and god that you would be glorified and magnified in this place we're careful to give you all the honor on the glory we have felt your presence amen through the worship also through the specials and now god may we feel your presence through the preaching of the word of god uh we take every spirit that's against the spirit of god underneath the control of the holy spirit even right now it's in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen god bless you can be seated praise the lord um so we want to just use for a title today uh make ready for the countdown amen make ready for the countdown um as uh the church knows we have been working our way through a vision and um being that this year uh 2020 a man i considered a year of vision amen uh but uh i think it's something greater than just my uh my personal a man vision that i might have for myself uh uh if i had a a career that i was chasing a man it's greater than my career amen uh the business that the lord has allowed us to get uh started it's greater than the business amen uh and whatever it is that you are a part of uh we are trying to elevate the church to a place where they begin to recognize uh that god's vision is the greatest vision that we could be pursuing praise the lord amen and uh so we have been working our way through uh a number of statements that have been made by the angel of the lord when he told the prophet to pick up his pen and write and uh we just been uh taking a journey for this entire year uh paragraph by paragraph uh through this and uh we have uh found a man a little subject out of one of the other paragraphs that we'll address in a little bit uh but we found a little subject that we want to talk about today make ready for the countdown amen for the countdown so uh if you don't mind let me just start this sermon by giving uh a few quotes from the message that the prophet preached the first first will come from the message the countdown and then my second quote will come from a message countdown brother branham preached this multiple times but here he says amen uh in 1962 he says god uh i think uh it should be 1125 e amen uh it says god has got a new system praise the lord he said it's not the old system it's a new system he's bringing his church up and now this is the key statement that is being made here uh as he's bringing the church up glory to god if you just look at that pyramid over here to my right uh we have uh the church starting off in the days of paul a man uh in the in in the church a church age of ephesians the ephesus church age and it works its way up the left of the next church age to smyrna this is gentile church ages after jesus had come amen up because jesus came to the jews amen he came to his own his own received him not but paul has begun to try to bring the gospel to the to the jews the jews which was rejected so paul made a statement there in the book of acts it says we turn to the gentiles and since that day god has been working with gentile church ages amen until where we are a day today where he he started with paul went up through ephesus and arenas was the messenger to smyrna and then martin the messenger to pergamos and then columba the message to thiatera luther martin luther was the messenger to the church age of sardis and then john wesley messenger to the church age of philadelphia and then we got elijah according to malachi chapter 4 god said i will send you elijah before the great and terrible day of the lord now it's up to you to determine and amen to have it revealed to you who elijah is amen it's not the physical elijah according to scripture amen the spirit of elijah is used five different times praise god we must know where we stand amen when it comes to the word of god amen hallelujah amen your feelings can trick you your emotions can trick you but when you standing on scripture ain't nothing the devil can do against you praise god amen upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell will not prevail but elijah goes amen he's a messenger sent to the church age of laodicea and the word laid to see itself means people's rights hallelujah if this is not an age and time where everything got rights cats have rights dogs have rights children have rights amen everybody got rights praise god this is the age where we needed god to speak to us so we have this but notice amen this is like a pyramid and at the bottom is very wide but as it gets closer and closer to the top it gets narrow now let's read this quote it says um god has got a new system it's not a whole system it's a new system he's bringing his church up they're getting smaller in minority all the time so when you're looking for some great move of god today you're gonna find it in some small place hallelujah god doing great things with with a few people all right now hallelujah they're getting smaller in minority all the time they did in the days of noah hallelujah they did in the days of lot they always do till they get very very very small i like this but still that little grain of god is still moving on and as they get smaller guess what happens they get more powerful and powerful all the time so you can just come to church and somebody starts singing you're not even feeling well in your body hallelujah without somebody even laying hands on you come on somebody amen the anointing will strike you and bring healing to your body why because the church is getting more powerful and more powerful and more powerful all the time demons are leaving because the church is getting more powerful people are being delivered because the church is getting more powerful the sick can't stay sick the pound can't stay down because the church is getting more powerful glory to god hallelujah the true church of the living god is miles up the road today than what it was we see it we know it it's the truth i don't mean organization now you're back down to the horse and buggy again you see we're climbing above that thing don't want to go back to that again amen i don't want to go back to where i come from amen i i've gone beyond that now i'm not going back praise god amen that should be everybody's personal testimony wherever the lord has delivered you from to bring you into his presence you ought to tell the devil i'm not going back hallelujah amen no i should i should say not all right say the spiritual astronaut astronaut is in christ and he's listening to the word of god the countdown to see where it's going and he's fixing to leave now not for the moon he will pass the moon so fast he's on his road to heaven and he's listening to the countdown yes he's headed for heaven in a rapture of the glory of god he's in christ wrapped in his glory headed for heaven with him leave the earth praise the lord amen i thank god for that so we're we're preparing for something here and uh i will um i'm gonna just i'm gonna uh oh my let me read uh let me read this amen out of a countdown of 620909 it says here uh science has been able to prove that there's a there's an astronaut that can go so far till you couldn't see it with your natural eyes and it can go whether there and it can go whether there's any pressure there or not he can just go on out because he's in a pressurized tank and he can go up there and sail around praise god and see the world's around amen uh uh an astronaut oh my what an age that that is coming yes sir go beyond any natural things at all and sweet plum on out into yonder what does it represent a spiritual age a spiritual time to where god's going to have spiritual astronauts amen they're here right now hallelujah oh i like this church i thank god for it the spiritual astronauts are here right now i'm preaching to them amen they're listening on the uh on the line here spiritual astronauts you know glory to god not bound by earthly conditions not bound by earthly situations amen when i leave here i know i got some things to face but amen whatever i'm facing not gonna stop me praise god whatever i gotta go through i just gotta go through right but it's not gonna stop me praise his holy name hey man amen amen it says uh what an age that is coming yes sir uh uh there it says a spiritual age a spiritual time to where god's gonna have spiritual asking i say man they're here right now hallelujah the eagles of the air that can go beyond any other bird my amen cell above everything spiritual astronauts glory that can take the word of god and prove that he's the same yesterday today and forever a spiritual astronaut oh my glory that makes me feel good living in this age now what a wonderful thing for a spiritual astronaut see what is it what did the natural scientists do he's been able to achieve that and god through man who would stay with the bride and say that he's the same yesterday today and forever and not afraid of the promise regardless of what anybody said stay with it what is it you become an astronaut that can go so far as beyond denominational thinking it's beyond anything else it's beyond the thing of the church out yonder with god and him alone you stay astronauts and you know when they send people to that space station they there about himself hey man they not they i mean maybe a group of them might go here and there but most time when people go there there by themself and and when we talk about going into this realm with god you got to leave some things behind you know when when abraham went to find the city whose building maker was god abraham had to leave some stuff behind he had to leave some family members behind he had to leave some good friends behind because when god calls you god calls you and and in order to identify yourself as abraham see you're gonna face the same trial you're gonna have to leave something but i tell you this if you leave something you'll gain something he goes on to say and remember amen in order to get to be an astronaut they had to get in a tank and they can't control themselves it takes a radar power and if i can just say dynamics it takes a radar power and atomic power to lift him out beyond space and then he's controlled by a tower glory it says glory god spiritual astronauts is the same they come into a tank into a place into a body and that body is the body of christ then it's not them it's not it wasn't john glenn it was the tank that he was in it was the machine he just sat there glory he didn't do nothing he just had the real pure courage to get up there and say it's right because science has proved it now john glenn can just get in the tank and trust what they had done with science to say if i get in they going to bring me back to earth i'm going to make this orbit around earth and i'm gonna come right back down to where they say i'm supposed to land he had confidence he had faith in that brother i have put my faith in the word of god i put my confidence on what god said in his bible praise god amen amen i know that this message will get me home i know that it's the right thing because god promised it according to scripture that's why i believe the way i believe all right all right all right all right all right okay let me skip on here i'm going to go to spoken words original seat amen i'm going to paragraph 437 on this praise god hallelujah hallelujah my my my it's so hard for me to skip some of these things that i that i have for you uh on today but i i'm i'm trusting that the lord will help us uh let's go for it this is uh we we dealt with this for the past two weeks but now i'm going forward amen and this thought this again is the angel telling the prophet pick up your pen and write and these were the things that were written and they were concerning the bribe the church the bride amen uh for this day he says concerning the word and the bride amen so here we are uh picking this up and we're i want to say we are living it amen we're walking into this vision that god has we're stepping into it glory to god and and i i i find it uh quite uh supernatural that as we're going through this series god actually gave a man a supernatural uh vision to the church by way of a dream and the dream correctly interpreted his vision so i know i know we're on the right path i know god's got us right where he wants us and and i hope as a church that we can catch what god is doing in this hour amen so look the prophet makes this statement he's right picking up his pen he's writing he says how can you tell them he's talking about the two churches i mean the two spirits within the framework of the church always remember there's a false spirit and a true spirit in midst in the midst of the church glory to god don't don't look outside amen looking for the devil do something outside he comes into the church he actually wants worship from the church and i'm i'm gonna share a quote with y'all today some of the sisters may not realize certain things you do amen you actually worship the devil and don't even realize it praise the lord i'm gonna share a quote with you today amen there's certain things you do there's a struggle that you have praise the lord amen a struggle to want to paint sometime and when you fall to that struggle you actually worship the devil i'm going to give you the quote when you fall to that that temptation you're actually worshiping the devil you actually show in on your body that you love the devil more than you love god you saw it on your fingernails you show it on your toenails and then you take pictures like that and the devil just sit back saying see see god i got him he always wanted worship and he'll use your body to get it all right praise the lord church it's it's the truth in the heart so amen i i'm trying to tell you got to make ready for this countdown amen hallelujah let me let me finish this now he says how can you tell them give them the word test how can you know it speak the word see what the word see what they say about it if they don't believe the word they have no seed turn in them they are of the evil one and deceive you as the first bride was deceived and the second bride was deceived talk about adam and eve and then talk about uh the children of israel uh coming underneath moses teachings they were deceived they wanted a king rather than go with the gospel amen as he was sending through a prophet he said as the the second bribe was deceived they all deceive us of the third bride which is representing us by hybriding the word or trying to glory to god amen tell you don't mean that no more hybrid the word of god amen god never plays signs ahead of his word amen that's a scorcher god never plays signs ahead of work now you got to get what the angel's trying to tell you because people will see miracles and and great manifestations of the spirit and i'm telling you it is the genuine holy spirit causing them to do what they do but it does not mean anything if it's not in line with the word of god amen hallelujah that's the thing that we want to watch because god never played signs ahead of his word amen that's a scorcher god never played signs ahead of his work they were added for proof of the word but the word is first glory to god to prove it elijah said to the woman bake me a cake first then watch the miracle happen come to the word first then watch the miracle the c word itself is what the holy spirit energizes now i'm going forward amen we were there for two weeks now let me move forward amen in this next paragraph says how can a messenger sent from god just believe some of the scriptures and not all the words have you got a prophet telling you that it don't mean that no more in the scripture that prophet is not from god amen not from god how can a messenger sent from god just believe some of the scriptures and not all the word deny part of it look at it says the true prophet of god will proclaim the word in the last days and notice what he says denominations will hate him so truth anyhow denominations will hate him he will not pull any punches on them he will be like he was when he come at the first coming of christ you generation of vipers now now now i'm i'm reading to you what the angel told the prophet say he says when this messenger come now here he is the messenger writing down what the angels say and brother branham if the angels say now he's not gonna pull no punches and when i read to y'all this quote about worshiping the devil not even realizing that's brother branham not pulling any punches now now most churches that you go to they won't quote things like that they won't say things like that they're against that because they won't hallelujah they just want people in the church glory to god amen we want people but we not just any people we want the bride all right let me go he says he will not pull any punches on them he would be like he was when he come in the first coming of christ you generation of vipers but the predestinated will hear and not only that when they hear it guess what they're going to do and we'll make ready [Laughter] glory when we hear this we're going to make ready for the countdown the royal seat of abraham's faith like him holding to the word of god regardless for he was predestinated now i want to just take my time here so let's just let's just let's just uh bear bear with me just a little bit glory hallelujah now um i read to you here out of genesis i'm sorry revelation 19 let us be verse 7 says let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready the wife has to make herself ready i'm just kind of meditating on the scripture and and uh you know and also this quote here where brother branham i mean the angel lord say you know the uh the say they will they will hear his voice the predestination will hear and make ready for the countdown uh that that that that's that's the the same thing is what the scripture says my sheep hear my voice and a stranger they won't follow i preached to y'all a few weeks ago about um amen impossible deception impossible matthew 24 24 says if it were possible it would deceive the very lead and then i told you when i came to understand his message i rested on that scripture i i i claim that i am one of god's very elect and it's impossible for me to be deceived hallelujah impossible right so you know here uh we hear the word we hear it come from god's prophet and then as as we hear we begin to make preparation for the countdown hallelujah we begin to make preparation for the countdown and and i'm turning to the scripture how the the wife amen the let's let's let's give let's be uh let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready that means there are certain things that the wife must do hallelujah there are certain things that must be done before the amen the great wedding celebration i thought about a woman as she's preparing a man for her wedding glory glory glory amen the the woman that has been pro that has been proposed to she must prepare for things that her guests will never prepare for ain't god a good god god saved this sermon for today i can't believe how god do things just blow my mind sister haley glory to god i know i'm in the channel can i talk to y'all this morning we got a couple preparing for marriage praise god so so so when the when the young lady has been proposed to her response is different from everybody else that's coming to the wedding amen she begins to make preparation hallelujah she has to do things that the guests will never be asked to do glory to god she has to make arrangements for the flowers glory to god hey man she she has to make arrangements for where the reception's gonna be held how many people gonna come to the reception what kind of food is gonna be there at the reception because you know you don't want nobody talking about your reception come on somebody y'all preach with me hey man you want to make sure it's in a nice place that people are going to really enjoy themselves you have to save up money for these things you got to be prepared to do a man spending that other people don't have to prepare to spend for these people just show up and they just eat praise god but you have to make the preparation for them come on somebody you got to sacrifice this in order to have that come on somebody amen you go through different strains when you're making preparation nobody understands the things that you're going through amen you're wondering whether god gonna make a way yes god come make a way she she makes arrangements for the seating at the reception who gonna sit where which family's gonna be here and and and now make sure i put them there because if i put them too far back they're gonna show let me know about it hallelujah how many people in the church can i invite who can i who i gotta cut off the list hallelujah somebody amen my list getting a little bit too long i don't have enough money to feed everybody i hope they not offended with me come on somebody all these things happen during preparation come on somebody amen now here's the thing uh since she said yes to the proposal she also has to say yes to the dress because if she goes through all this preparation of the reception and the and how she wants things uh uh sorted out at the uh at the wedding how she wants the decoration and she go through all that but don't have a good dress y'all need to talk to me today if a dress is not up for the occasion then this wedding is a mess now i want to tell you something brothers and sisters in christ if you're dressing it's not up to the occasion of the word of god then everything else is in vain your dressing has to be according to the word of god you can go through all that other stuff but it won't mean nothing if you come in without a dress everybody waiting to see what this dress gonna look like and do you know the dress is something hidden not even the groom can see it god want to know what you what you doing in your secret places when you leave church how you dressing hallelujah when the groom can't see you but you you married the christ so he can't see everything that you're doing hallelujah but i'm using it as a type what's your response when nobody's looking pastor not around right now so let me do this praise god amen the holy ghost is there and i told you the holy ghost want to get some weeds out we want to see the power of god fall there is a holy ghost that will cause you to dress right there is a holy ghost that will cause you to live right there is a holy ghost that'll cause you to talk right hallelujah somebody praise his holy name look since she said yes to the proposal she's also she also has to say yes to the dress amen and this is of utmost importance because all the other arrangements mean nothing if a dress doesn't meet the occasion glory to god she's not expecting her guests to come in wedding dresses because this day ain't about to catch this day's about me and my testimony that i've been keeping all these y'all gonna watch me walk down this south this ain't about nobody else it's not about the guests but it's about the the one that's accepted the approach the proposal have you accepted his proposal didn't he ask you will you marry me did you say yes hallelujah well if you say yes you got to start making preparation to get out of here look at this amen her dress must be appropriate especially reconsidering the person that she's marrying all right now i'ma say it again her address must be appropriate especially considering the person that she's married all right amen amen amen amen see i mean a man don't want to come out and see his wife with some mini skirt on coming down the aisle hallelujah hey man i mean all her body out chest out everything out let the man say no no no that's for me glory to god hallelujah somebody she got to be dressed appropriately amen amen amen so you know here we got to understand that we're we're getting married to christ and the scripture tells us let us be glad and rejoice for the marriage of lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready now when it says have made herself ready that means you got to do some things all right all right let me just read something here to you glory glory glory glory uh this is out of the um the message oh my lord the marriage of the lamb there's some things you got to do now the prophet says this he says so many says if the lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking or from gambling or from lying or stealing i'll serve him if god will take these things from it then i'll serve him now look at what he says he says but that's up to you there's not a thing where you ask god to take it from you this is a thing where you actually give it up the scriptures say lay it down let you got to lay aside that mean i'm holding it in my hand i got it in my hand but the bible say lay aside every sin and every weight that so easily besets you so here i got it in my hand and you praying god take this from me but while you're praying you just grabbing more and more god take this from me god take this from me he can't even pry your hand open to get it out of your hand so what the scripture tells you to do is it's not god taken from me you're smoking you're drinking you're cursing you're lying you're stealing you're cheating you got to lay it down say that's up to you he said that's something you see you got to do something too it says uh they that overcome shall inherit all things that mean you gotta have something that you overcame if you're gonna inherit something you got to have something in your life to overcome praise god he says uh uh they that overcome you have power to do it i like that some of y'all say i'm too weak to do it pastor no you got power to do it amen but you must be willing to lay it down see she has made herself ready i like that word says you see god could not push us through a little pipe pull us out on the other end and then say blessed is he that overcometh you had nothing overcome you he just pushed you through but you got to make a decision for yourself i have to make decisions for myself in doing that we show our faith and respects to god now when you make a decision to follow god follows work you are showing your respect to god now can we go back now i want to read this to you glory to god all right all right yes i think it's appropriate amen uh all right so as i was just this week i was just blessed by some of the uh tapes that i was listening to and this is a message god is evil age i'm starting at paragraph 89. now brother branham makes a statement in that sermon he says you know uh it was no other age like this age i want you to understand what you're battling in this age is all the spirits from every other age amen they have they have uh accumulated right or not and seemed like they almost multiplied but every spirit that paul was battling amen every spirit that iranians martin columba luther wesley all of those spirits have rules i mean have come to the top in this age so i i realize that what we're battling is not easy amen we're going through things that people have never gone through other agents that never had to go through these type of things other ages didn't have to worry about some of these scriptures that we have to we have to bring up every once in a while because they just had that thing under control hallelujah but now we're we're fighting things amen uh um my that you know it's going to take almighty god it's going to take the holy ghost to keep you now what why he's watch what he say here in this message god that's hebrew 8. he says now let's watch it be manifested he says he is making a better world for them to live in so this is this is what uh satan is doing satan always wanted worship it says he's making a better world for them to live in by his knowledge apart from the never failing word of god but by his coming together in denominations increasing intellectual and scientific and so forth he is making a better world for man to live in and ignoring the promise of god that the only time the world will will be fit to live in is in the millennium so no matter what you get amen on this on this earth well no i mean the house that you get the car that you drive amen this world will be never fit to live in until we actually come to a millennium time amen he says you know my opinion he's made a better world to sin in instead of living oh we know god's prophet is telling the truth on this this is a better world to sin in than to live in come on somebody glory to god can you just pull that quote down just for a little bit let me talk just a little bit see back in the day maybe mama or daddy a man would might have to uh watch for some fella trying to sneak through the window of the house praise it praise god you know sneaking through the wind of the house and and daddy might have a gun for that fella catch him coming through the window and i'm gonna tell you once that fella get caught one time real good he began to change his weights but now he's coming through amen a window he gonna dm her right and he talking through through dms amen he doesn't bypass all kind of process to get to get to the daughter and she's sending it all back to him you got all kind of stuff you got to fight nowadays parents got to check their kids phones i'ma say it again i know you think you can trust your children glory to god but you need to check they phones praise the lord tell them to put their phone in your room at night oh hallelujah somebody hey man put your phone in my room tonight i want to see what who texting you this time of night what they say what they trying to say anybody texting this time of night ain't up to no good see this is a better world for them to sin in than to live in amen it's easy to sin nowadays glory to god it's a truth in it hallelujah it used to be a time if some young man had an addiction to porn he had to go buy some book somewhere off the shelf but now it's all on his phone nobody knows what he's looking at at night praise the lord why that devil only come out at night hallelujah you know things that that crawl in the dark they come out at night hallelujah but we need to turn the light on some of this stuff because when the light come on it begin to scatter and if i know it's in the room even though i didn't catch it when i turn the light on if i know it's in the room i'm gonna take some sprite and i'm gonna the the the perimeter because once you cross over this perimeter you good is gone i'm trying to lay a perimeter down praise god stay with me here church amen stay with me here now now i want to read this uh he says uh you know my opinion uh he's made a better world of sin in instead of living now wallace notice did he do it he legalized sin i don't want to say this in the pulpit but you know this this cbd stuff marijuana been legalized and they say it's for medicinal purposes but there are people in jail for medicinal purposes praise the lord amen all right they've legalized sin right uh uh and and he brother branham said they legalized wisdom whiskey drinking cigarette smoking and then the churches legalized that a woman could be a member of the church with short hair now may you stop just a minute now i'm talking this back in this back in 65 he preaching this glory god sister's not supposed to cut their hair according to the scripture amen her hair is her glory amen i know that's against popular opinion but according to the scripture her hair is her glory paul taught that all right amen look now he goes on a little further he says she can wear shorts wear paints not paint paints paints hey man one for the eyebrows one for the cheeks one for the fingers one for the toes paint and still belong to his religious group whose religious group satan's religious group right which is absolutely contrary to the word of god he says it's all right see his knowledge this is satan now see you don't you you don't realize people are still eating from the tree of knowledge good and evil hey man how this wasn't a physical tree at the beginning amen this is spiritual gloria the tree of life was christ amen that tree of knowledge good and evil is what satan tries to give to the people and he's still trying to give it to the people so you got to stay with the word of god amen amen amen what does this word say about this all right let me keep going let me keep going says um uh uh um uh what's that got to do with the woman just the same as taking the forbidden fruit or not the forbidden fruit that's what it is god said not to do it but he does it and she believes him look at this and she loves him for it loves who loves satan for giving her the opportunity to do these things and to tell her it's okay according to that's old testament all right hey man your passage that's a little old folky hallelujah she loves him but uh uh uh uh uh and she believes him and she loves him for it she hates god now now most people say man i knew it was going to get quiet there i knew it was it's okay i'ma still read it anyway amen she hates god your actions proof you hate god when i when i heard this this week i say lord have mercy jesus god i gotta say it i know because you know when you get you get up and everybody's saying man they all charged but then the lord i know what i got to say i i already know i know the air coming out this praise god but i'm not just trying to take the air out of the room what i'm trying to do is give somebody something to live with when you leave the room you got something to live with something to think about because maybe you ain't looked at it from this angle before a prophet is telling you what god's thinking i'm gonna go a little further let me just finish reading the quote then i'm gonna share something with y'all i'm gonna share something with you let me finish reading this and she believes him and she loves him for it she hates god her own actions prove she does she says she she says she loves him hallelujah but she loves satan what a statement she worships the god of fashion the god of the world amen the hollywood goddesses she loves him but she hates the true word of god which is the which is the only true god there is so we get our examples from what what people do on instagram we get our examples from you know some model or something like that we and some of these people that you're looking at they done photoshopped them to they they don't look like that you if you saw them in real life you'd be like oh my man you just you just chasing it don't do that chase god [Applause] it says uh legalize it in the churches there's no harm our women can do this that or the other but in the presence of the living god she's not even permitted to come lest she's repenting amen see he is the god of worldly beauty he is talking about satan satan she wants to look beautiful and he is the god of beauty from the beginning he can and has achieved by his knowledge in science and materials to make beauty for his this model age this modern age rather of evil it's made beauty now you go back to the beginning those two churches that was established in in in the garden of eden uh cain had a church and abel had a church abel's church was just messy bloody a bloody mess but cain's church was a church of beauty you understand it was a church of beauty so that same spirit that was in genesis is still living today and when we fall to that spirit we actually give worship to the devil and not even realize it you ain't gonna hear that in most churches but a prophet tells you that recently i went to get something to eat pulled up in the drive-through and as i pulled up in the drive-through um a young man was taking my order i can hear by the voice that this was a young man taking my order i'm okay all right so he's taking my order and um you know we get to what i want and you know and it tells me the price that it's going to be and says okay just pull up to the first window and you'll be able to you know just you know you get get your order said okay so i pull up to the first window and um and and and then that his hand came out the um came out the the to get my card and i could i knew it's a young man i could tell by the hand this is a young man but when he stuck his hand out he had purple fingernail polish on every one of his fingers purple fingernail polish i say well this is a young man taking my order and and and uh what uh okay uh here's my card you know what i'm saying i you thinking the same thing i'm thinking what in the world is going on right now i mean built young man nice physique and sticking big burly hands out and got purple fingernail polish on i'm trying to figure some things out now now the reason you laughing because you know that's not normal it's not normal to see no man do nothing like that now that that shocked me i mean i know i'm talking to a young man and you stick your hand down and i'm seeing it wait a minute what what doesn't happen there's a spirit that jumped on this young man some kind of way hallelujah glory to god now i want you to understand that the way that that young man when he stuck his fingers out and it shocked me sister when you do it it shocks god right it wasn't normal for that young man to do that and it's not normal for us no matter whether we're human i mean a woman or man that's not normal society has made it normal but the same way i responded to this young man is the same way god responds to you how you know that because you weren't born that way you weren't born that way you weren't born with all them colors on that's what i said see when you when you when you take paints wear paints someone's got the thing we don't overcome we i ain't wearing nothing on my face i i'm i'm i'm beautiful just as i am someone's got to that but boy when it get to them fingers amen church and when they get to them fingers we start struggling with fingers toes we struggle with our toes really that's that's all the devil got to offer you is toenail polishing fingernail polish you can't overcome that it's because you serve the god of fashion and i'm going to tell you if you want to overcome the god of fashion you might just need to get off instagram you might just need to shut down your account because it's it's it's it bothers you you get influenced by all this stuff right i mean you and you just see somebody with it i mean you know used to be a time now we got multiple colors on multiple fingers and it just what is it now and and i'm telling when you see it on i mean this young man nails was at the i don't know i'm what is what is this young man that's not normal young man's supposed to be out there working with bricks and and all kinds of stuff you don't have no fingernail polish doing stuff like that but but i had to think about it i had to really think about this the way it shocked me with him is the same way god is shocked by our sisters when they do it every time you do it you can see christ wincing i'm talking about making ready for the countdown i ain't there yet but let me let me just work through this let me work through this it says i i i wrote some notes that says i i uh i must admit that it didn't seem natural to me to see this young man you know doing what he did i was really caught off guard as i was not expecting that it seemed like a mild form of perversion right and and then i thought to myself i can't say that makeup fingernail and toenail polish are feminine i can't say that and not masculine why because i think the world we live in has made is acceptable and made it feminine i said but after pondering over the quote that i just read i realized the same shock i experienced in seeing this young man in this condition is the same shock that god has when he sees his daughters in the same condition the quote says that we show a love for satan when we paint rather than showing a love for god by not painting amen lord thank you amen we getting weeds out i told you i told you we're gonna get weeds out now you know and when i say things like that i know i got babies in christ and i got i got some that's been around for a long time and i know my babes you know they're going to learn i'm not trying to come against them in any way that's not what that's not when i say things like this i can't apologize for the word but i'm not trying to hurt people i'm not trying to do that i'm trying to help people and and you know sometimes i was thinking about this you know when you uh when you got kids at home and you got a child at maybe five years old and then you got another one that's 15 years old and maybe something goes wrong in the house praise the lord right now when you talk to that five-year-old you're gonna say it a certain way praise the lord amen and the fifteen-year-old gonna hear you how you say it to the five-year-old and then the 15-year-old expecting you praise god to talk to them the same way but then after you finish reprimanding the five-year-old don't do that johnny don't do that now i mean look i'm gonna give you a chance now next time you do something like that you know it's gonna be different repercussions you understand johnny yes daddy yes now bill boy i'ma tell you now johnny gonna hear you talk to bill a different way than you talk to johnny praise the lord right and it's because you already had that talk with beetle you already told him next time it's gonna be so now he has reached next time and some of y'all don't reach next time spiritually you don't reach next time so so i have to say things to try to get your attention you are worshiping the devil when you do that you say you love god you say it but you've proven that you love the devil more alright pause for effect let me just read something here but i had to get that in today now this is gonna be a two-part sermon don't worry i got the i got the first part the real good part i got that out the way already glory to god i want to just read the scripture here acts 15 14. i want to read this amen acts 15 14. uh here the bible says simon have declared how god at the first did visit the gentiles to take out of them a people for his name amen so god visit the gentiles to take out of them now not all the gentiles gonna make it you understand i just went through this this this church age from from from paul all the way up to this day god dealing with the gentiles but not all the gentiles gonna make it glory to god amen but god is going to call out of the gentiles of people amen for his name this this this group that is calling out of gentiles this people's name these are people that got to make themselves ready for the countdown hallelujah amen now i wanna i wanna underst i want you to understand there's three exodus that that that that will occur amen the first exodus according to scripture back in the book of exodus amen was god bringing israel out of egypt now i need you to understand egypt is a type of the world glory to god so when god brought israel out of egypt he brought them out of the world and when god brings you out he brings you out of the world so you don't hold on to things in the world no more look at this he said it says uh the pillow fire of of bringing israel out of each it was called amen a nation out of a nation amen brother branham also said this was a natural exodus out of the natural the second exodus was christ also the pill of fire and i love that because when when paul was on the road to damascus amen paul had a conversation with the lord jesus christ it was a great light that was shining over paul and as paul began to talk to this great light he said who art thou lord and the light itself spoke back to paul and said i am jesus so the light that led the children of israel out of egypt was jesus christ in the form of light and paul met that same light on the road to damascus but that light also had a body oh hallelujah now i need you to understand why it had a body amen because it's the same way amen uh i was gonna read this a little early but but but when we're sharing the word amen the seed word has to pass through the body praise god i like that the c word has to pass through the body somebody gonna have to tell you about this amen you might get a dream you might get this but somebody gonna end up telling you something somebody's gonna tell you they're experiencing when they're telling you their experience the seed is passing through the body hallelujah glory to god amen so so paul met this light on the road to damascus and the light was identified as jesus christ now i want you to understand that same light took a picture with his prophet in this day and they recorded it they got it on they got on on camera and it's the only supernatural being that has been put on camera and they have it there in washington dc and um this the library of congress they have it there so you know when we talk about you know um brother branham being amen the prophet and all that look god vindicated that we don't have to vindicate that god already did that oh yes amen god already did it so so so that same pillow fire that paul saw the same pill of fire that moses saw is the same pill of fire that took his picture above the prophet's head and it's hanging in washington dc that's for the third exodus because in the third exodus it's amen it's the same pill of fire taking the bride out of the church glory to god amen uh the first one took israel out of egypt the sacrament took amen the church out of judaism to judaism and now the third one is to take the pride out of the church call the people for his name it's the spiritual out of the spiritual which is also the bride coming out of denominations the bible say come out of her my people revelation 18 4. and you all are experiencing that and not even realizing you are part of a vision all right let's read this out of god in this evil age paragraph 35. i want to just read a little bit here and we might find a way to cut off and then uh i'll be back praise the lord lord i said it god thank you jesus it's it's sad it says it's off me now it's off me huh you talk about somebody that's free i'm free free at last free at last thank god almighty i'm free at last i hate the devil i just got to expose him wherever i can amen amen he wants some worship you ain't going to get nothing here amen you ain't going to get nothing here praise the lord praise the lord praise the lord praise the lord all right all right this god is evil age amen now uh the prophet says what would god call a people out of this evil age for his name why would he do that the reason is to try her so god calls the people out for his namesake and the reason he calls him out is to try her watch this his bride when she is made manifest then tried been proven proved to satan like it was at the beginning so shall it be at the end watch this as a seed starts in the ground it comes up through caries the life of it but it ends up the same seed that uh that it was when it was in the ground when it went in the ground and the same way the seed of deceit fell in the ground in eden is the same way it ends up in the last days just as the gospel was when it fell to denomination at night see a rome it ends up in a super organization just as the seed of the church fell back there with the signs and wonders and the living christ among them it ends up in the last days under the ministry of malachi 4 and restores back again the original faith that was once given i say amen to that look at this he says we find now this evil age the reason god called you the reason god revealed this message to you the reason god i mean some of y'all got powerful testimonies as to how you entered through these doors amen you know it's nothing but almighty god that placed you here but the devil been fighting your testimony but i want you to understand the reason why god called you uh and i got good news in this amen i got real good news when we get this reason god got confidence in you yeah he sees you struggling he sees you falling sometimes but his grace is there to pick you right back up why because he got confidence in you that you will not be like eve look at this look at this he says we find now this evil age is approved to satan she is not like eve glory and that she is not that type of woman i like that statement satan i'm not that kind of woman the reason that i don't do this and i don't do that is because i'm not that kind of woman you can't try me like that you can't speak to me like that because i'm not that kind of woman you got to be able to speak back to the devil no seeks and i'm not that kind of woman hallelujah glory to god he says she is not that type of woman and she will be tried by his word the bride as adam's bride was tried by the word glory and adam's pride believed every bit of the word all but confused on one promise she believed everything but got confused on one little thing and i don't want you to get tripped up on one little thing i want to expose the devil i want you to if there's nothing else you get from this message today i haven't really got to my topic yet but there's nothing else you get when you decide to paint you're actually bringing worship to the devil that's what the prophet told us when you do that it brings worship to the devil praise the lord all right all right now now look there was only one woman in the bible that painted her name was jezebel is the truth jezebel was a pagan idol worshiper so we should not take our example from jezebel amen church i don't care who doing it i don't care who's standing the pulpit with it on if it's against the word of god then it's against the word of god bottom line and god wants some people that's gonna stay with his word regardless of how they feel well they gonna pick at me so let them pick at me they picked that noah right hey they picked that jesus they i'm sure they picked that paul and peter hey man there was some there were some some boys that picked at a prophet one time called them old ball head going up old paw head speaking of the prophet now he had the holy ghost so he did something that you shouldn't do he called two she-bells two shoes come out the woods and just tear em up damn the pieces 42 children died just like that because the prophet didn't have the holy ghost that's why you need the holy ghost to control your temple all right all right let me go on she would be tried by his word the bride as adam's bride was tried by the word and adam's bride believed every bit of the word all but confused on one promise that he's the same yesterday today and forever today see but failed on one promise under the temptation of the enemy face to face let's go on and now the people that's called for call for his name of course is his bribe she is coming contact again by the same thing not by just denominational truth or something but every word god want to know are you going to follow every word from the beginning of the bible man was given the word of god to live by one word misinterpreted a man called satan and the person of an animal called the serpent satan in this person could talk to eve and misinterpreted the word to her and was lost see it must be every word you're not gonna make it to heaven unless you following every word i want to say it again you can come to church any any way you want to come but we talk about going to heaven i'm going to preach like this every sunday but sometimes you come in you just get by then you leave church and you you take it off on sat saturday night come to church on sunday with it i mean without it but my god before monday hit the truth in it high look they ought to go out of business because they shouldn't be getting your money no more because i am telling you every time you walk the aisle pick it up put it in your pocket you're giving the devil some glory and he just sitting back and looking at god like i told you ain't got nothing i got them with polish polish god that's all it takes for them polish you got to make the devil fight a little harder than that when we stand on malachi 4 being the fulfillment they've been fulfilled by brother branham brother william aaron branham we're being tried by the word i want to tell you all something when we went through this this great uh falling away recently a lot a lot of folk just man you just thought that they had this message they were holding on to it but there was a big fall in the way some of them came after you some of them are trying to get you to explain some things but you're still sitting here today i want to tell you when you were going through that trial you had been tried by the word you were being tried by the you didn't realize it but you have been tried but the the trials was were you gonna hold on to the promise even when you couldn't explain it even when you can explain it i mean you know when when when the disciples was there and jesus preached this really hard sermon because i'm gonna tell you i read a quote at the beginning i said the church is getting smaller and smaller and smaller because some of y'all right now like i ain't coming back here they will fight you but it's not me i i i like the way brother john said brother sean said it i'm not picking on you i'm picking off you right i'm just trying to help you praise the lord somebody got to tell you why not me right so so you know uh um um you know uh the the the thing of it is that you know people were were pulling here and pulling their and and and it was a it was a trial to you to see whether you would stay with the word when when they did the disciples jesus preached the sermon and say um lest you eat in my flesh and drink my blood you have no part with me oh lord i mean the disciples like amen jesus because you saying it but i don't know what you just said and then then it eat my flesh what wait a minute couldn't explain that next thing you know uh 80 people it was a church of 82. yeah yeah 82 i think and um i said the first group got up and jumped up and say we out of here we ain't van we ain't we're in cannibals we're not eating no people we we they didn't even try to even understand spiritual what was being said we're not we're out of here left and and maybe maybe some of the disciples looking at them and you know and and uh going like man that was my buddy we had good fellowship what in the world what happened oh my good jesus you know and peter you know peter usually always say something but this time peter didn't say nothing and maybe one of his friends said peter what you're gonna do peter you heard what he just said peter come on man you can't be come on your daddy taught you better than that i don't know what to do but i'ma stay right here so jesus looked at him say um will you also go say oh my lord what now what am i supposed to do with that jesus jesus then then peter finally says let me say lord only you got the words of eternal life i ain't going nowhere and you think jesus would say amen to peter i mean after the church just got shook down 80 can you imagine that there's a church of yeah 82 people 70 left and i'm going to tell you the 70 that left work signs wonders and miracles but because of one sermon out of all the eating bread and fish and everything like one sermon calls them folk to leave but the church got more powerful i'm talking about there was some power in the church peter could walk by folk and they get healed in his shadow church got more power peter couldn't explain it if he said i ain't going away i ain't heard no preaching like this before i'ma stay right here with this whether i can explain it or not and i'm gonna tell you when you couldn't explain to people why you was holding on to what you was holding on you were being tried by the word when you stood on revelation 10 7 being the fulfillment uh been but fulfilled by william mary and branham you are being tried by the words hallelujah when you stand on water baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ you are being tried by the word praise god amen when you declare to others that there isn't three gods but it's one god servant in three offices you are being tried by the word you have no you have an understanding that jehovah of the old testament is jesus of the new you're being tried by the word when you stand on deuteronomy 22 5 and you refuse to put on garments that pertain to a man you've been tried by the word and today when you decide i ain't painting no more because the only woman in scripted ever used paint was jezebel she's found in second kings 9 30 and i want to tell you when i look at her when when the prophet said paints they use paints jezebel might have painted her face but i'ma tell you that painting produced spirits that went to other places so when i look at paints today i look at makeup i look at toenails i look at fingernails and i also look at tattoos leviticus 19 28. let's read it i'm talking making ready for the countdown i ain't got y'all into this into the shuttle yet but before you can get in the shuttle we got to get some stuff off you maybe you didn't read this in the bible let's read it ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead nor print any marks upon you who own your body i am the lord who made your body who designed your body so see when it come to tattoos we don't do that either as believers i was at a christian bookstore one time and i heard somebody say it's just so therapeutic for me to get a tattoo what bible are you reading you are in a christian bookstore what bible are you reading talk about is therapeutic you just went against the word of god but we have a lot nowadays i i was i mean i was going to a big church huge church and one of the pastors he used to always have tattoos so when they brought this scripture to me just explain that thing wait no i don't mean that no more what part of not printing any marks on your that i mean that's so plain and simple that i don't i think anybody can get that it don't i'm gonna put it this way it don't even take a revelation it don't even take praying about it it's just what it say and i i like i like this you should not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead comma no now to print any marks is not even for the dead printed marks means no print any marks upon your flesh i'm the lord now i know saints come to the lord they hadn't read these scriptures before and they got tattoos all over their body i'm not telling you to go have no special surgery or nothing like that but now you know truth it shouldn't be no new tattoos you shouldn't be coming here oh yeah i just got one oh did you worship of the devil that's paints paints he said paints i'm trying to make ready for the countdown this just part one there'll be a part two y'all just wait for it but today this do this what need to be done amen praise the lord [Applause] shall we pray father uh we have heard your word you sent us a prophet that would share truth with us to help us to see the spirit behind many of the things that are leading us spirits behind things that are attacking us and lord you told us in your word blessed is he that overcometh and we realize that there has to be something that we will overcome sometimes lord is the sometimes it may seem like it's very little things but god has got to be something so somebody it might be smoking to another it might be drinking to know that it might be lust to another it might be uh figuring out polish to nail polish makeup so many other things lord that we we fight with we struggle with but god you have given a confidence in us you told us that we're going to overcome and somehow someway we will we're not going to give glory and honor to satan his wicked devices his plan has been exposed father our job is to rise up and overcome it so lord i pray that if a heart has been touched by the word of god that that heart would god just begin to repent right where they are while they're in your presence they begin to make things right with you lord just telling you lord i'm sorry for the way that i treated my body it's not my body it's yours and i want to subject myself to the headship of the word of god i want to be led by the word of god not by popular opinion not by what others may think and others may say i want to be led by the word of god i want my body to bring glory to you i want my mouth to bring glory to you i want my eyes to bring glory to you i want my hands to bring glory to you i want to be surrendered fully holy completely father to your will and to your weight god let people have that cry from their heart whether they're here in this place or at home streaming god let them cry
