[1:05:49] I mean I was wondering cuz we didn't get
[1:05:51] the projector but the way that they set
[1:05:52] that up and gave out the the copies and
[1:05:57] to send it through the audience that
[1:06:00] that anointed some faith that in order
[1:06:04] some faith and you know and you know
[1:06:07] sometimes we take it for granted what
[1:06:08] God has done for us but we have to be
[1:06:10] the ones to be out there to spray it
[1:06:12] what God has done for us because other
[1:06:14] people don't know God is still moving in
[1:06:16] this way but but I believe some faith
[1:06:18] was anointed and some people that came
[1:06:21] up for prayer I'm expecting to hear
[1:06:23] tremendous testimonies a man from from
[1:06:26] what was it what what happened there

[1:08:05] potential so you're going places I say

[1:08:49] weekend praise the Lord and and I am I
[1:08:53] you know this you know our again I'm
[1:08:57] going back to our quote as to where we
[1:08:59] have come from right thank you thank you
[1:09:10] but it was something that I did want to
[1:09:12] say about that yeah actually I forgot
[1:09:18] three people - two more brother Josue
[1:09:22] brother Quentin brother Guerin now I'm
[1:09:28] gonna go a little further with these
[1:09:29] fellows these brothers here so you know
[1:09:35] brother Josue gave the testimony did you
[1:09:38] bring you home
[1:09:41] I told him bring it today okay next one
[1:09:46] a brother brother Josue and brother
[1:09:52] Guerin they they came and they kind of
[1:09:54] they they loaded everything into the
[1:09:57] truck put it in the truck and I think it
[1:09:59] was on Friday they they come up here to
[1:10:03] get something out of church and and I I
[1:10:06] was over the school and I heard somebody
[1:10:08] walking up so I he he's the door to
[1:10:11] school open so I can look at him and
[1:10:15] they like why there's no opening and now
[1:10:19] they're like oh brother Jack isn't what
[1:10:21] you're doing I said well I was coming up
[1:10:22] here to get this and said well we coming
[1:10:24] up here to get this and you know we was
[1:10:26] we were just kind of chatting a little
[1:10:27] bit and and you know they they they took
[1:10:30] it home and then they got themselves
[1:10:31] prepared to come out to the meeting a
[1:10:34] man in Okeechobee and and and when they
[1:10:36] got on the road to come traffic was
[1:10:38] terrible
[1:10:39] right so they they were like ain't no
[1:10:43] way we're gonna make it on time we got
[1:10:44] old it we got sound equipment we got all
[1:10:46] the stuff you know and I've even we're
[1:10:48] not gonna make another time and brother
[1:10:49] host we were sharing how God sent two
[1:10:51] fire trucks and and in the direction
[1:10:54] that the fire trucks were going he says
[1:10:56] kind of opposite of where they really
[1:10:57] should have been going right so so he
[1:11:00] said he saw two fire trucks I'm like why
[1:11:01] these five trucks coming this way see
[1:11:03] this just don't make no sense so he just
[1:11:05] kind of fellowship and around and
[1:11:07] everything and he say you know what it's
[1:11:09] over the game so I think I thank god
[1:11:11] these fire trucks for us to get us
[1:11:14] through this traffic and say what i'ma
[1:11:16] do is just get right behind them if
[1:11:18] that's not illegal I'm gonna get right
[1:11:20] behind right
[1:11:23] [Music]
[1:11:25] so he said i'ma get right behind him you
[1:11:28] know and he got right back and he said
[1:11:31] now wait a minute he said you know what
[1:11:33] I think these fire trucks are actually
[1:11:35] gonna make a u-turn shut off the lights
[1:11:38] when they get to a circus but they're
[1:11:39] gonna shut off the lights and that's
[1:11:40] gonna be it now so here's my thing is
[1:11:42] that I do believe God sent two fire
[1:11:45] trucks and here's the other thing I
[1:11:48] think they was illegal right ain't no
[1:11:54] citizen turn them like song if ain't no
[1:11:56] fire if you've got one
[1:12:10] [Applause]
[1:12:22] what you wanna feel you get on the road
[1:12:25] because you got one of these so exactly
[1:12:35] what the brother said that's what they
[1:12:36] did they made a way out of no way for
[1:12:39] the implements to get on up the highway
[1:12:41] and they made it there safely and we
[1:12:43] thank God and then you know after you
[1:12:46] know every night we're breaking down and
[1:12:48] putting things up and you know and all
[1:12:50] that and I was I was very grateful to

[1:13:52] that they gonna take this to the church

[1:14:11] was behind us and and we all driving and
[1:14:14] for the hosts we pulled on into the
[1:14:16] church then I kept past my turn I pulled
[1:14:19] on to the church and say I'm gonna help
[1:14:20] the brothers out cuz this is a blessing
[1:14:22] I said brother Quentin gonna probably
[1:14:24] keep on going to go home and brother
[1:14:26] getting brother Guerin thought the same
[1:14:27] thing in his
[1:14:28] and his car for the Quinten gonna keep
[1:14:30] on going he put no blink on he just and
[1:14:37] and all of them pulled in and we got
[1:14:40] that got everything unloaded last night
[1:14:42] and brought back into the church and I
[1:14:44] said man y'all see things through from
[1:14:46] start to finish and I like that I like
[1:14:50] that so I appreciate you brothers in the
[1:14:53] sacrifice that you are made I mean
[1:14:56] that's midnight y'all here doing that
[1:14:58] and making sure that the soldiers of the
[1:14:59] Lord is set up and ready for the next
[1:15:01] morning that was that was very very much
[1:15:03] appreciated so thank you all so much I'm
[1:15:06] going back just to this quote here I've
[1:15:09] been reading this but this is where our
[1:15:10] thought came from and and doing this and
[1:15:13] it and it's not over it's not over this
[1:15:15] is just beginning y'all just beginning
[1:15:18] this is not over you know one of the one
[1:15:22] of the the Saints came up a prayer last
[1:15:24] night and they were standing in the gap
[1:15:26] for many of the young people that have
[1:15:28] walked away from this word and and by
[1:15:32] them standing the gap what they're what
[1:15:34] they're believing God to do is light the
[1:15:36] fire again all right so you know this
[1:15:39] this thing that we're that we're seeing
[1:15:41] in this quote is not something that just
[1:15:42] hit this area everybody is impacted by
[1:15:45] this right but we're not stuck Amen
[1:15:48] we're not stopping at the negative right
[1:15:52] we're looking at the positive and we're
[1:15:55] going forward with what you know what
[1:15:57] God has called us to do and we're gonna
[1:15:59] see God he's already started and he's
[1:16:03] gonna do more he's gonna light the fire
[1:16:05] you again so let me read this again I
[1:16:07] want to just bring something out a man
[1:16:10] maybe something I hope that we won't
[1:16:12] miss a man but let me just read this
[1:16:14] again because this is where our thought
[1:16:16] was this is at Ephesian Church age and
[1:16:18] the Prophet was again quoting revelation
[1:16:21] 2:4 and he's making comments on this
[1:16:23] scripture where it says nevertheless I
[1:16:25] have somewhat against thee because thou
[1:16:27] has left thy first love to understand
[1:16:30] this you must realize that the Spirit is
[1:16:33] not speaking to the original sinks of
[1:16:35] Ephesus alone this message is to the
[1:16:38] entire age which
[1:16:40] lasted about 120 years its message then
[1:16:43] is to all generations in that span now
[1:16:47] history keeps repeating itself in the
[1:16:51] generations of Israel now you know just
[1:16:53] that statement there the message would
[1:16:55] have been to all the generations in that
[1:16:56] span that would have been three
[1:16:57] generations all right
[1:16:59] so but here it says that now history
[1:17:03] keeps repeating itself and the
[1:17:04] generations of Israel we see revival in
[1:17:07] one generation only to see the fires
[1:17:09] fading in the next and you know I was
[1:17:11] sharing here or last week just some of
[1:17:13] the testimonies from brother Perry green
[1:17:15] and some of the things that he saw even
[1:17:17] I shared it on on Wednesday night and I
[1:17:20] was telling a little testimony how
[1:17:22] brother pair of green was in the pulpit
[1:17:24] one time and he's talking you know about
[1:17:26] brother Branham he's explaining to his
[1:17:29] church you know the experiences that
[1:17:30] he's had a witness man says he's got to
[1:17:32] be something to this man you know I mean
[1:17:34] this dis man is it's it's something else
[1:17:37] you know he's and so he's explaining all
[1:17:38] this to the church and and while he's in
[1:17:40] the pulpit all of a sudden the phone
[1:17:42] just rings you know not now when when I
[1:17:45] say all of a sudden the phone rings you
[1:17:47] all have to understand how the phone
[1:17:49] worked back then see nowadays we got
[1:17:52] cell phones and you can call any time
[1:17:54] you want to call but back then you know
[1:17:56] it was sometimes it was even worse than
[1:17:58] their what they call the party line and
[1:18:01] young people don't know anything about
[1:18:03] this but but but the party line a man is
[1:18:06] that you had to share a number for a
[1:18:09] whole area right and what would happen
[1:18:12] sometimes you would get on the phone and
[1:18:14] you would call somebody and you you'd be
[1:18:16] waiting to talk to them or you'd already
[1:18:17] be in the midst of the conversation and
[1:18:19] somebody else in your neighborhood we're
[1:18:22] get on the same phone line and ask you
[1:18:24] to enjoy a conversation because they
[1:18:26] need to talk to somebody but I mean it
[1:18:29] was it was
[1:18:29] ilza I mean it was really really
[1:18:31] something not see that young people
[1:18:33] could understand now what's going on
[1:18:35] right but this distance this is what the
[1:18:37] party line was you were sharing numbers
[1:18:39] so so here the Prophet picks up the
[1:18:41] phone calls the brother wise in the
[1:18:42] pulpit talking about him and when he
[1:18:44] calls them one of the brothers is a pro
[1:18:46] saying that you ain't gonna believe this
[1:18:47] brother parents say interrupted and why
[1:18:49] for you to say brother brother brother
[1:18:50] branham is on the phone right now what
[1:18:53] right what I'm here talking about him
[1:18:55] and he wanna talk to me say congregation
[1:18:57] I can't believe it but he's on the phone
[1:18:59] right now I want to talk to me now that
[1:19:01] was that was almost a miracle you know
[1:19:04] just just by him getting that phone call
[1:19:06] at that time right so here here I'll he
[1:19:09] gets the phone call and he says excuse
[1:19:12] me I'll con quesa let me go and just
[1:19:13] check this you know just check with him
[1:19:15] and talk to him a little bit and I come
[1:19:16] back that can tell you what he said when
[1:19:17] you go any talks and and brother Branham
[1:19:20] says uh god bless you brother Perry say
[1:19:22] yes god bless you brother say you know
[1:19:24] I'm just talking about you he said yeah
[1:19:26] I know and they say well am I wrong so I
[1:19:32] said what brother Perry I was just
[1:19:33] calling to tell you that if you ever
[1:19:35] said anything wrong I'll call you so
[1:19:40] brother Perry like okay now you just
[1:19:43] called me so that put him in check as to
[1:19:49] what things he would say and what things
[1:19:52] he probably shouldn't say about the
[1:19:54] Prophet hallelujah amen because all
[1:19:58] sometimes what people and i'ma tell you
[1:20:00] you know one of the reasons that the
[1:20:02] fire has to be lit again and because
[1:20:05] some people have said some things they
[1:20:07] shouldn't I see it and what that's done
[1:20:11] is cause people to go in the wrong
[1:20:12] direction right but but but when the
[1:20:15] fire is lit again it brings them back to
[1:20:18] a balance hallelujah and before long
[1:20:23] they gonna realize that there is no
[1:20:25] other life outside of this all right
[1:20:30] Church hey man hallelujah will will
[1:20:34] realize that real soon but you know so
[1:20:37] so so you know I was sharing that
[1:20:38] because I noticed something that I
[1:20:40] laughter after I shared some of these
[1:20:42] testimonies I noticed how some of the
[1:20:43] brothers was getting really inspired
[1:20:45] it's a man ain't no way any normal man
[1:20:48] can just do things like this this proves
[1:20:50] that this got to be a prophet and
[1:20:52] without what I realized it I think we
[1:20:53] forgot to a man just begin to tell the
[1:20:57] testimonies of how God has moved right
[1:21:00] because sometimes you just hear the
[1:21:02] testimonies on how God has moved it
[1:21:04] gives you faith that gives
[1:21:05] of encouragement to know that God can
[1:21:07] still move in the same way hallelujah
[1:21:10] glory to God so I'm grateful for you
[1:21:14] know this dis this this theme here but
[1:21:16] notice notice is thought in the in this
[1:21:18] quote history keeps repeating itself and
[1:21:21] the generation of Israel we see revival
[1:21:22] in one generation only to see the fires
[1:21:25] fading in the next in the third
[1:21:27] generation Amber's maybe glowing
[1:21:30] slightly but in the fourth there that
[1:21:32] there may be no vestige whatsoever of
[1:21:36] the original flame and what is that they
[1:21:38] won't quote the Prophet no more no
[1:21:41] vestige early reason of flame do you
[1:21:44] even know how I got my fire lit right
[1:21:49] when we burn a smiley was it's
[1:21:51] explaining I hope we catching these
[1:21:55] things wherever smiley was explaining
[1:21:57] his own testimony the man has been 3 for
[1:22:01] 30 years when he wasn't Pentecost he
[1:22:05] couldn't give free when he was
[1:22:07] embarrassed he can get free when he was
[1:22:10] him he can get weak but when he came in
[1:22:17] contact notice part of George Bailey
[1:22:21] interview in any of my brother Jewish
[1:22:24] only talked about was the work that bids
[1:22:56] we gotta be ashamed of this message
[1:22:59] right God gave us something here
[1:23:01] something very special right but but I
[1:23:04] can't when I listen upon the breath I
[1:23:06] mean brother Smiley's testimony how you
[1:23:08] know he just sitting there listening man
[1:23:10] will you get this from it was third on
[1:23:13] the inside God with God was moving on
[1:23:15] the inside and who would have known in
[1:23:18] that that man that at that time the drug
[1:23:21] addict who woulda known God had a past
[1:23:24] in there who would have known that
[1:23:29] that's why you can't look down on nobody
[1:23:32] you don't know what's inside that person
[1:23:36] and to see Liam stain a man I mean with
[1:23:44] all that you know all that he went
[1:23:46] through before he came to Christ it will
[1:23:48] take a lot but then the man raises his
[1:23:51] family and they get to this stage
[1:23:53] there's life and giving everything to
[1:23:55] God and see this have a modern day to
[1:23:59] [Applause]
[1:24:01] the stairs I there gives us the gospel
[1:24:04] and when he made that comment that just
[1:24:06] blessed me if no
[1:24:09] [Music]
[1:24:11] if NOAA weather change his message
[1:24:16] nobody will events a so you wanna peace
[1:24:21] salvation it is bitchin foundation and
[1:24:24] most pain of rebuilding Samoa salvation
[1:24:33] was founded - message oh my God my God
[1:24:38] my God and as it was in the days of Noah
[1:24:40] so shall it be in the coming of the Son
[1:24:42] of man I hope y'all I hope you always
[1:24:44] catching it now and I wanted to just
[1:24:47] just say you know before I go further
[1:24:49] here and this quote we gave out a lot of
[1:24:53] tracks a lot of invitations and you know
[1:24:57] sometimes and I was so happy you I know
[1:25:00] we pray for the man that brother Mike
[1:25:01] Graham - but brother Mike I also pray
[1:25:03] for him out there stop what they were
[1:25:06] doing there was I think there a couple
[1:25:08] of other situations where they stopped
[1:25:09] and they prayed with people that was
[1:25:11] ministry they might not have come to the
[1:25:14] tent but those brothers were
[1:25:15] strategically placed by Almighty God to
[1:25:19] do what they did
[1:25:21] alright so they are praying for a were
[1:25:23] praying for the sick in Okeechobee and
[1:25:25] didn't realize it that might not have
[1:25:28] brought him to the tent but you just by
[1:25:30] giving that little piece of paper
[1:25:31] God gave me an opportunity to do
[1:25:33] something somebody if that atheists
[1:25:39] didn't come to the tip but she went to
[1:25:41] some church God giving you credit for
[1:25:45] the atheist
[1:25:49] because you're the one who lit the fire
[1:25:54] that's a little conversation with them
[1:25:57] you lit that fire caused him to think a
[1:26:00] little different right so you know it's
[1:26:03] like all of us right you know I mean
[1:26:06] many of us started in different places
[1:26:08] we you know I come from Baptists and
[1:26:09] Pentecostal background and you know I
[1:26:11] had all of that and some of us come from
[1:26:13] Catholic and all kind of things but God
[1:26:15] brought us to a perfect word a perfect
[1:26:17] understanding of his word right and
[1:26:19] we're grateful you know for that I'm
[1:26:21] brother brother Devin come from Church
[1:26:23] of the latter-day saints buddy but he is
[1:26:28] up here right and it shows that you know
[1:26:30] that you got when you get to the space
[1:26:34] the place that God won't you that's when
[1:26:35] you'll begin to see what you need to see
[1:26:38] praise God you'll try this and you try
[1:26:40] that you'll try this you find this ain't
[1:26:42] working that ain't working out but when
[1:26:43] you get to where you need to be and it's
[1:26:45] not it's not a matter what when I say
[1:26:48] that it's something that's gonna strike
[1:26:50] from the inside like like brother Garen
[1:26:52] was saying I was a part of the message
[1:26:54] but the message was not part of me they
[1:26:58] would not talk different because I I'm
[1:27:00] eating the word and you all were to eat
[1:27:05] so now I see things different I see
[1:27:09] threes and sevens and I see perfection I
[1:27:19] see completion I see all kind of thing
[1:27:21] and when God just show you things like
[1:27:22] that you walk in by revelation hey man
[1:27:26] Church right but you know but but but
[1:27:28] but God has orchestrated all of our
[1:27:30] lives to come together at this time and
[1:27:32] and I wanted to say you know all of the
[1:27:35] inviting that you we did we would think
[1:27:38] that nobody a man from Okeechobee showed
[1:27:41] up but I beg to differ there was at
[1:27:45] least one from Okeechobee that showed up
[1:27:54] [Applause]
[1:27:57] and you gotta have to read between the
[1:27:59] lines and figure out the one from
[1:28:02] Okeechobee I told y'all we would go just
[1:28:05] for one and there was one from okhla
[1:28:08] Toby we just waiting to see what God
[1:28:17] gonna do but we just do off my let God
[1:28:20] do the rest well who was the one don't
[1:28:22] worry it come to you here to come to you
[1:28:25] in a come to you in a in a striking
[1:28:29] you'd be like oh that's the way God do
[1:28:32] things he just he make it so simply go
[1:28:34] right through you I yeah God God is a
[1:28:36] good God so let me I finish this quote
[1:28:42] and then I got something else I want to
[1:28:44] just kind of share here so no vestige
[1:28:51] vetting for if there may be no vestige
[1:28:54] whatsoever of the original flame then
[1:28:55] got like then God likes to fire again
[1:28:57] and that's the part that that's where we
[1:28:59] are now then God likes the fire again
[1:29:01] you know we've seen you know the embers
[1:29:04] fade we've seen the vestige of the
[1:29:05] original flame going but now we're
[1:29:08] looking at God lights to fire again
[1:29:10] that's where we are right it says in the
[1:29:12] same process is repeated hey man so
[1:29:14] that's that we ought to be an
[1:29:15] expectation for my to move in this
[1:29:18] generation whenever we see we give the
[1:29:20] devil way too much credit right you know
[1:29:23] some of y'all ought to be taking after

[1:33:08] see that we were looking for God to move
[1:33:10] in our generation we know what he's done
[1:33:12] in other generations but we're trying to
[1:33:14] do what we can for our generation and I
[1:33:17] you know this whole thought that I
[1:33:18] brought to okay children override you
[1:33:21] know I don't know I think I was here to
[1:33:22] church one day and then I started
[1:33:25] thinking about your sisters shopping and
[1:33:26] God just started dropping the whole
[1:33:28] thing down
[1:33:29] brought that thing down too and say well

[1:33:34] hey man they override that brings the
[1:33:39] Lord but we we think got forward and you
[1:33:41] know but but as I was just kind of
[1:33:43] waiting like Lord you know how do we get
[1:33:45] around you know what we wants to go with
[1:33:47] it
[1:33:47] I was waiting then I got this quote on
[1:33:50] Friday that was a confirmation to me and
[1:33:52] I want to read that as out of faith is
[1:33:54] our victory praise the Lord
[1:33:57] see that the override means to use one's
[1:34:00] authority to reject a cancel so you have
[1:34:03] the authority to reject or cancel y'all
[1:34:05] got that but before before I read faith
[1:34:09] is the victory let me read something
[1:34:11] else hey man you got the authority to
[1:34:13] reject or cancel let me read this
[1:34:15] something else real quick a man and this
[1:34:20] is going to be if I can just find it

[1:37:01] to accept anything that that were
[1:37:03] brought to you let me go back here to
[1:37:04] this just thought that was bringing a
[1:37:07] little confirmation to his faith is our
[1:37:08] victory just I ran into this on Friday
[1:37:11] just really just stay with me and I say
[1:37:13] Lord I got to go with this thought on
[1:37:16] override and it says now faith is a
[1:37:18] conqueror
[1:37:19] faith is an overcomer
[1:37:22] it isn't just a peacemaker it overcomes
[1:37:26] faith is the victory that overcomes the
[1:37:29] world what does it do what is faith what
[1:37:31] is the Conqueror conquer and victory is
[1:37:33] the same to conquer it means to beat
[1:37:35] down to over right see that
[1:37:42] so faith is what actually overrides
[1:37:46] glory God your faith is what overrides
[1:37:49] whatever the devil has done your your
[1:37:53] faith it's activated where you can pick
[1:37:56] up the cards and now you don't have to
[1:37:59] wait for a manager this what I'm trying
[1:38:01] to get to you right amen
[1:38:04] and in the retail world you wait for a
[1:38:07] manager but in the spiritual world you
[1:38:10] are the manager if they ringing things
[1:38:18] up you say no you know at this just
[1:38:29] talking to a friend of mine you know we
[1:38:31] come down and visit me from Georgia he
[1:38:35] just surprised me on Friday and I'm
[1:38:37] trying to get everything ready you know
[1:38:39] to leave him and I'm and I'm in town and
[1:38:41] I just want to say hi said man but let's
[1:38:43] go out and do let's go do let's go to
[1:38:44] lunch together and and I went with him
[1:38:47] to lunch and everything and and and he
[1:38:50] was telling me you know about you know
[1:38:52] the business that he was in how he buys
[1:38:54] cars and all of that and and it was
[1:38:57] telling me say now I have access to
[1:39:00] information where I know that a car is
[1:39:04] going to be auctioned even if it's at a
[1:39:07] dealership is going to be auctioned in
[1:39:08] so many days so I look at the countdown
[1:39:11] on the option and I say my wait a minute
[1:39:13] wait a minute you know about the auction
[1:39:14] saying how do people like me get access
[1:39:18] to information like that
[1:39:20] they says you're gonna have to be a
[1:39:22] dealer this or that before you can get
[1:39:24] access to that said but he said what I'm
[1:39:25] telling you is that if you if you need
[1:39:28] something just get the VIN number and
[1:39:30] give me a call and I can tell you what
[1:39:33] the auction price is versus what they
[1:39:35] got it listed at so he said he wanted a
[1:39:38] particular car and and he walked into
[1:39:40] the dealership
[1:39:41] and he had already looked at the auction
[1:39:43] price and he knew exactly what it was he
[1:39:46] knew how much that car was going to go
[1:39:48] for and it's about three days left on
[1:39:50] the auction so he walks into the
[1:39:52] dealership and he starts talking to one
[1:39:54] of salespeople and
[1:39:55] looked at him he wasn't dressed you know
[1:39:58] like he had anything so the guy looked
[1:40:02] at him and say well who you buying this
[1:40:04] car he said we'll go get me another
[1:40:07] salesperson well that's an override and
[1:40:14] and he said Oh give me another sale for
[1:40:17] you say he's saying so another guy come
[1:40:19] up and they say look we don't talk real
[1:40:21] fast you say it showed them this
[1:40:26] pre-approve on this phone say see this
[1:40:28] right here
[1:40:28] this says I've been pre-approved to buy
[1:40:30] so much car and the car that I won't is
[1:40:33] dis from right here and the guy looked
[1:40:35] at the pre-approve say oh yes sir you
[1:40:37] say now go get the keys move real fast I
[1:40:39] don't have much time and let's take it
[1:40:41] for a drive
[1:40:42] yes sir I ain't got the keys

[1:40:55] drivin the car and they're doing
[1:40:56] everything they you know they need to do
[1:40:57] and then it starts working on the
[1:40:59] numbers and and and as they work in the
[1:41:02] numbers he knew three days from now that
[1:41:05] cars going for eight thousand dollars
[1:41:07] less than what y'all got it listed and
[1:41:10] he says he says yeah I want this car and
[1:41:12] I want it at this price
[1:41:13] say what price so many nights eight
[1:41:16] thousand say yeah I know it's $8,000
[1:41:17] less you said but y'all don't understand
[1:41:18] I'm in this business you in this
[1:41:22] business he I'm in this business and I
[1:41:24] know that that car is you know can be
[1:41:26] sold to that price he said no my boss
[1:41:29] think I'll go for it say look what you
[1:41:31] need to do is to turn it over
[1:41:32] we call it teal turn it over they say
[1:41:36] you know why because you're not gonna
[1:41:37] make no money off this deal he said but
[1:41:40] your balls need to get rid of some cars
[1:41:42] and your boss when I go in there to him
[1:41:44] that you won't sell me the car at this
[1:41:46] price that you willing to let it go for
[1:41:47] three days from now
[1:41:48] you might not have a job turn it over
[1:41:52] override
[1:41:56] [Applause]
[1:41:58] right and you just if you if you just do
[1:42:00] that this thing would be done and nobody
[1:42:02] get hurt right okay sir he went and
[1:42:08] talked to the boss till everything said
[1:42:10] okay the man is right y'all sign the
[1:42:12] deal cinammon out of here and he walked
[1:42:14] off that lot with his Maserati so you
[1:42:28] know I mean you got to know your
[1:42:30] authority and when it comes to the devil
[1:42:34] and all the stuff that he doing you got
[1:42:36] to know your authority you don't have to
[1:42:37] accept everything that the devil does
[1:42:39] right I mean you and I can say the
[1:42:43] scripture actually tells what whatever
[1:42:45] you find on earth shall be bound in
[1:42:48] heaven and whatever you loose on earth
[1:42:51] shall be loosed in heaven
[1:42:52] right so it really what God is telling
[1:42:55] you guys that he's giving you the cart
[1:42:57] and you use it when you need to use it
[1:43:00] you don't just call the manager for
[1:43:02] anything and everything they have to be
[1:43:04] special situations and circumstances but
[1:43:06] when you get called you know you have
[1:43:08] authority to change the situation praise
[1:43:12] God Amen I'm believing God for that I
[1:43:16] want to just go back to the scripture I
[1:43:19] gave it to you all for homework on last
[1:43:22] week but I'm gonna pick it up here and
[1:43:23] we'll we're gonna come home feeling up

[1:43:42] name of the Lord and for the Saints that
[1:43:44] weren't there last night but my title
[1:43:46] last night was override and that's why
[1:43:49] you know I'm using this car and I was
[1:43:50] overriding some things so a man so a man
[1:43:56] I pray that y'all catch up but you can
[1:43:58] override today you can use your car then

[1:44:05] cancel that thing I'm changing the price
[1:44:09] change the outcome right and I love it
[1:44:12] when they use the overwrite car it
[1:44:14] always works out in your favor
[1:44:18] you always leave with a smile when they
[1:44:21] use an override car praise God so here
[1:44:25] in Luke 14 and this is for my precious
[1:44:29] brothers I'm at verse 15 thank you all
[1:44:32] so much for what you did by going out
[1:44:33] there and just getting the word spread
[1:44:35] this is what Jesus told us to do and he
[1:44:37] says look and when one of them has said
[1:44:40] it meet with him heard these things he
[1:44:41] said unto Him blessed is he that shall
[1:44:44] eat bread in the kingdom of God then
[1:44:47] said he unto unto him a certain man made
[1:44:50] a great supper and bathed many so he
[1:44:53] invited a lot of people and that's what
[1:44:55] happened when you all went out there
[1:44:56] with the the with the not tracks but the
[1:45:00] invitations you were inviting a lot of
[1:45:02] people praise God and do you realize
[1:45:05] that every person that you invited if
[1:45:08] they went to judgment they would be
[1:45:13] responsible for rejecting the invitation
[1:45:15] that God uses you to give right so he
[1:45:20] says then he said a certain man made a
[1:45:22] great supper in vain many and sent his
[1:45:25] servant at supper time to say to them
[1:45:28] that were bidden come for all things are
[1:45:31] now ready and they all with one consent
[1:45:35] began to make excuse the first said unto
[1:45:39] him I have bought a piece of ground and
[1:45:41] I must needs go and see it and I pray
[1:45:43] thee have an excuse now again you know
[1:45:45] you look at this this man's excuse it's
[1:45:47] not even logical who would buy property
[1:45:50] that they have never seen this man is
[1:45:54] already seeing his property right
[1:45:56] this man is our this man knows what he
[1:45:58] purchased but this is this is an excuse
[1:46:01] as well as a lie right I mean look at
[1:46:04] say the first time I have bought a piece
[1:46:07] of ground and I must needs go and see it
[1:46:08] I pray they have an excuse what you come
[1:46:10] on come on you don't already saw the
[1:46:12] property know exactly what it look like
[1:46:13] you just don't want to go do a man what

[1:46:18] the next
[1:46:18] and another set I have bought five yoke
[1:46:23] of oxen and I go to prove them
[1:46:27] I pray to help me choose now look at
[1:46:29] this now you don't boss some animals to
[1:46:31] work your your land and you ain't even
[1:46:34] tested them you didn't never see them
[1:46:36] work you might you might just may you
[1:46:39] don't know what you got a hold up now
[1:46:41] ain't nobody ever made money on nothing
[1:46:43] that they tested before this man is just
[1:46:46] coming up with an excuse I don't know
[1:46:49] maybe you young man might have hard
[1:46:50] people out there with excuses it's okay
[1:46:54] it's okay look at this I mean that that
[1:46:58] guy Howard that came by he said he'd
[1:47:00] been told no so many times it don't

[1:47:46] said uh I'm good
[1:47:49] you sure I'm good okay
[1:47:54] well right away from I see we need more
[1:47:59] people like that right we need people
[1:48:02] that walk up to you like like a thing
[1:48:05] with sister trails father God send a
[1:48:08] prophet and you misty and what a father
[1:48:13] told brother Solomon God send a prophet
[1:48:14] and you missed it what miss had to sit
[1:48:20] down and explain to him what happened
[1:48:21] right but but you know we we need people
[1:48:24] with boldness not thanked off of you
[1:48:26] young men to have boldness to go out
[1:48:27] there and do what you did God god bless
[1:48:29] you for that but Jesus gives us the
[1:48:31] parable to tell
[1:48:32] you know what what happened these are
[1:48:33] the things that we can expect a man we
[1:48:35] don't back up because a man the people
[1:48:37] that we invited didn't come you don't
[1:48:39] know when they will come they still got
[1:48:41] the address to the church it's on the
[1:48:43] invitation and one day you might hear
[1:48:46] testimony one time these guys came
[1:48:48] through the neighborhood and then
[1:48:49] somebody gave me some protection I just
[1:48:51] showed up here in this church I don't
[1:48:52] know you don't know what gotta do right
[1:48:54] so so so we thank God for it but here
[1:48:56] here you know verse 19
[1:48:58] another set I have about five yoke of
[1:49:00] oxen and I go to prove them I pray they
[1:49:03] have me excused and another said I have
[1:49:05] married a wife and therefore I cannot
[1:49:08] come now he had a good excuse he had a
[1:49:11] good excuse a man he should have been
[1:49:14] spent some time with his wife but I but
[1:49:16] here here you know that the verse women
[1:49:18] says so disturbing that servant came and
[1:49:20] showed his Lord these things and then
[1:49:24] the master of the house being angry
[1:49:26] status servant go out quickly to the
[1:49:28] streets and lanes of the city and bring
[1:49:30] in hither the poor in the main and the
[1:49:32] hall in the blind now I want you to
[1:49:33] understand the Prophet actually tells us
[1:49:35] this part verse 21 is actually the
[1:49:38] second pool of the invitation and the
[1:49:41] first pool you know it would demand it
[1:49:43] made us tough but this great man made us
[1:49:45] suffer and he sent to serving out in a
[1:49:48] supper time or the evening time right he
[1:49:51] sent him out and and and and and they
[1:49:53] began to make excuse that was the first
[1:49:54] pool now the second time he he sends him
[1:49:57] out now he's saying just go out quickly
[1:49:59] to the streets and lanes of the city and
[1:50:00] bring in here that the poor the main and
[1:50:02] the halt and the blind now before I go
[1:50:05] further in that scripture I just want to
[1:50:06] read one quote for you a man this is out
[1:50:09] of the message el-shaddai I want you to
[1:50:12] understand what is happening spiritually
[1:50:15] and man this is out of el-shaddai it
[1:50:18] says every preparations mate healing is
[1:50:22] already atone for sins are already atone
[1:50:25] for all things are already all things
[1:50:29] already come that's right the wedding
[1:50:32] supper is set excuses are made but he
[1:50:36] said go into it may say the last call
[1:50:40] was go get the sick and the halt a
[1:50:42] campaign of
[1:50:44] feeling just before the wedding supper
[1:50:47] so it's not by accident that brother
[1:50:49] Mike ran into the man that had you know
[1:50:52] some meat there with us through the
[1:50:53] throat cancer and everything it's
[1:50:55] supposed to be a campaign of healing
[1:50:56] just before the wedding supper right now
[1:50:58] notice he says now you see where we're
[1:51:02] at
[1:51:03] go get the lame the halt the blind out
[1:51:05] of the streets and highways and hedges
[1:51:07] and bring them in healed them and let me
[1:51:10] show my mercy to them then they'll
[1:51:12] believe me that's right that's God's
[1:51:14] last call supper call us healing the
[1:51:15] last call you know as that the sisters
[1:51:19] of Shonda was I miss our sister Tony
[1:51:21] would share her testimony it was handed
[1:51:22] down everything I hadn't seen brother
[1:51:25] leave her in a good while and he was
[1:51:27] there last night that thing moved him he
[1:51:31] got a hold of that he said I'm taking
[1:51:33] this home to my wife I wanted to see

[1:51:42] talking what God did for us just last
[1:51:44] year just last year right and and when
[1:51:47] we share these things we don't know how
[1:51:49] to impact him people and and I'm
[1:51:51] actually believing that in brother Leroy
[1:51:56] the fires lit again
[1:52:05] alright let it be a sign for many more
[1:52:09] to come I believe that he was just
[1:52:10] blessed fine

[1:52:13] said praise God it's fine I got lit
[1:52:15] again that's good all right all right
[1:52:17] all right let me let me finish reading
[1:52:19] the scripture verse 21 the second poll
[1:52:22] right so the servant came and showed it
[1:52:24] as Lord these things in the mass of the
[1:52:26] house being angry said to the servant go
[1:52:28] out quickly into the streets and lanes
[1:52:30] of the city and bring in hither the poor
[1:52:32] and the Main and the halt and the blind
[1:52:34] the servant said Lord it is done as thou
[1:52:38] has commanded and yet there is room and
[1:52:41] the Lord said unto the servant go out

[2:01:26] to say thank you it's 25 roses for 25
[2:01:29] years
[2:01:31] [Applause]
[2:01:35] and and in 25 years a man be because she
[2:01:43] is stood by my side and you know I
[2:01:44] learned my grandmother taught me some
[2:01:46] things the years ago and I learned I was
[2:01:50] a pretty tough fella growing up I had a
[2:01:53] part of the sermon last night I was
[2:01:55] going to share my mother didn't want me
[2:02:01] to go to the military I was trying to go
[2:02:03] to military after I graduated high
[2:02:05] school and my mama just didn't want me
[2:02:07] to go and my mama knew that I was the
[2:02:09] type of child that once I made up my
[2:02:11] mind I was gonna do what I wanted to do
[2:02:14] so mama would talk to me like no I'm
[2:02:17] going to the military and mama got my
[2:02:20] pastor to talk to me and I remember
[2:02:23] going into the office I cannot usually
[2:02:25] don't go to the office unless you done
[2:02:26] did something wrong dang did nothing
[2:02:29] wrong so what is this all about
[2:02:30] and my pastor stopped talking about
[2:02:32] brother Jack please consider please pray
[2:02:35] about it pray about it about going to
[2:02:37] the military where I I can't say I
[2:02:39] prayed about I just said I wanted to go
[2:02:41] to military and I had just dropped that
[2:02:43] little seed in me and and I said okay
[2:02:46] all right I ain't prayed about it and I
[2:02:49] say if I do pray that God can probably
[2:02:51] tell me no so I won't go to the military
[2:02:54] and and and Mama's desire was granted
[2:02:57] you know and but I was grateful to see
[2:02:59] she didn't want to put me in certain
[2:03:01] environments she saw other things in me
[2:03:03] that God could use and if I would been
[2:03:05] in that environment then Satan would
[2:03:06] have tried to override what God had for
[2:03:09] me but but I'm grateful for that and you
[2:03:12] know so one of the things that my
[2:03:14] grandmother taught me one time you know
[2:03:16] I was doing okay a man with my job and
[2:03:19] and mama wanted to pursue something like
[2:03:20] that for for Christmas and I said say
[2:03:26] you know how much that goes so somehow
[2:03:31] my grandma got ahold of that information
[2:03:33] and I had to take her mom to the no to
[2:03:38] the first oh she go thrift shopping on
[2:03:40] certain days from stolen stolen I was
[2:03:42] just waiting in a car for and she
[2:03:44] stopped me and touched your mama and
[2:03:46] worth everything that you can't spend on
[2:03:49] how I'm saying it again she said your
[2:03:53] mama's worth everything you can't spend
[2:03:55] on say so don't don't tell her no it's
[2:03:57] okay grandma all right so I went and got
[2:04:00] that person but that taught me a lesson
[2:04:03] that not only with my mother be worth
[2:04:06] everything I could spend on her but my
[2:04:09] wife would also be worth everything I
[2:04:12] could spin on her and when I got married
[2:04:15] 25 years ago I bought my wife this ring
[2:04:17] and I she she wore it proudly a man for
[2:04:20] a number of years and I was you know
[2:04:23] grateful for that and then we got to our
[2:04:27] 10th year anniversary and I found out
[2:04:31] that I had to buy another ring and
[2:04:36] that's what I found out because I saw
[2:04:39] looking online and all kind of things
[2:04:52] I'm just kind of go Stephen all your
[2:05:03] other brothers following up just
[2:05:04] understanding so how many of you don't

[2:05:14] years so we celebrated 25 and today I
[2:05:17] got to give my wife a third ring

[2:05:31] for her let her open a ring
[2:06:09] this is a this is for my precious wife
[2:06:13] and when we first got married I couldn't
