for prayer so I have to openly to just give the praise I want to thank God for the pastor the fivefold ministry cuz it's very much needed amen and we have to always keep our leaders you know in prayer and God spoke in my spirit it's necessary to pray fast and get in his word amen because without that we can't make it I'm in a place now where my dependency is just once a month I don't want nobody have pity for me but I have been on jobs SAR that it came to a place my body just couldn't take it anymore and now my dependency is God amen amen amen I don't have a choice I can't go back it's God is his word amen and some things only going to come by prayer and fasting I remember brother Smiley was he uh sharing about uh Pastor uh brother Solomon was over in Dubai he had a situation with his little girl and he needed God to move right then I mean on the spot right then and God did it and I said if God can meet him in Dubai I don't have a clue where Dubai is but I know God can meet me here

thank you I got to give him praise I thank you Lord nobody but Jesus some of you have not experienced where I'm at all right but I'm going to say it's not out of to scare anyone but you're going to experience some things that your total dependency got to be God it's not going to be in your husband your wife your job it's going to have to be on your knees it's going to have to be where you walking the floow when your mindset is somewhere else you can't get a grip on yourself but you going to find yourself in the word of God you going to find yourself in prayer and fasting cuz that's where it's got to come from but I want to just give God thanks because he reminded me you know as we look at the bird sometime we Overlook the small things that God do because we're running we on our job we running we're so busy we forget the simple things that God has put here for us amen and we got to call it down to the earth wind where we live at we got to pull it down to the earth wind where we live at we're not living on the other side yet but we're living here and you got to pull it down in the earth realm you got to remind God of his word I say Lord I got to have a testimony I've been

something to say you got something to say don't you come on amen [Music] yeah I know you got something to [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] say hallelujah well I'm not sure many many of y'all know but since I've been back I haven't had a job and the way it was the way it happened I saw a spirit behind it so the last couple months I even told brother brother Jack when I told him I have a job he said well did you look in Optics and I'm like I ain't doing that no more I do all right I ain't doing so of course I went out on my own and tried to I applied from Bag Boy to management everywhere I turned everybody kept saying no but the whole time there was a job up in Port St Lucy that was Optical job I'm like I ain't going up there I said that's not where I'm supposed to be cuz I remember brother Simba testimony where he said he chose where he was going to live based off of where his church was and also brother Jos so I was like I'm not going up there I ain't working up there so I just was Faithfully waiting now let me back up when my job was getting ready to close one of the brothers from cut a long story short I got a job but one of the one of the guys from the job he called me and he was like hey you want me to talk to some people and see if I can get you the job see if they bring you back I'm like sure I didn't even ask him he just said he was going to do it himself so he did it and he was like all of a sudden people out the woodwork just kept coming up saying no no don't hire him don't hire him so the area maner were like no we going to look past him so that same store probably about a week ago I looked on indeed and it popped up and I I think it was only like two two hours old so I was like something said you remember what happened the last time you needed a job where I told you to go I'm like Lord they already told me no I ain't doing it I ain't going back to a place that told me no he was like they told you no I'm telling you to apply oh my I'm like that's good now when God tell you to do something you have to lay pride aside cuz my pride wanted me not to apply I like I'm too prideful I'm I'm way better than this so I was like you know what Lord I'll do it so two days later the area manager call me I'm like hey how you doing he was like yeah I already uh looked over everything he said all I've been hearing is good reports I called HR HR said you already hirable so he was like all all you got to do is meet the store manager and stuff I'm like all right no problem so a day later the store manager called me and was like hey uh I just want you to come in do a Mee and greet I'm like okay so I came in and just everything about the atmosphere just everything was it wasn't even like a meet and greet it was just like conversation it wasn't even an interview she was like we got to get you in here so I immediately started doing the onboarding and everything and just praising I'm like Lord I'm glad I trust in you and not a man so not only that of course you know when you're dealing with corporations they try you cuz they notice I ain't been working for about a month but I stood on God's word I'm like I'm not going back to I'm not going back for less than when I originally was there cuz they of course they were like well it's kind of high what you're asking for I said that's a lie I said the last time y'all I applied y'all gave me this I said I'm not going I ain't coming back for less than that all right let me make some phone calls I got a text probably an hour later we got a prove and they gave me more money than I asked for so I start work on Tuesday and I'm just thanking God for his provision hallelujah hallelujah amen praise the Lord amen I believe brother Jerry read the scripture this morning to make known his deeds among men and and it's good for us to see that God is answering prayer amen amen so we got a new come we got a a new job I'm thanking God for the church hallelujah amen and the school oh how we thank the Lord let me uh just uh make a couple of announcements here this is just a um um a thank you card from our Deacon and brother Troy says to my spirit and Truth family I'm so appreciative of your generosity your words of kindness were much very much appreciated in this difficult time your prayers and presence mean so much to us uh please continue to keep us in your prayers as we navigate through this journey I honestly can't thank you enough for the Troy and family um and you know you all just continue to keep them in prayer tell them just got to take it one day at a time you know and um I mean and and he was I tell you what he was very very strong to be able to kind of uh handle the eulogy and uh and I was I was concerned I didn't know know if he was going to make it but my God my God God my God God gave him strength you know and he did an excellent job you know there and so so now you know after you kind of get through all of that um you know you you deal with the reality of some things and so y'all continue to keep him in prayer that God would strengthen him and amen just day by day give him what he need in order to make it but we certainly appreciate amen our Deacon brother Troy we thank God for him [Applause] [Music] amen um want to um also thank the Lord for uh hermano Gonzalo and Arma Stephanie uh here with us amen today God bless you God bless you uh sister Tatiana told them about two churches that they could go and visit and I believe sister Stephanie when she heard the name of the church spirit and Truth Tabernacle she says I want to I want to go visit there so they're here this morning and we're certainly happy to have them amen in the house of the Lord amen praise God praise God amen amen good to have uh the mugos with us Amen on [Applause] today

this is not enough wow wow well praise the Lord somebody say move on brother Smiley you going to get in trouble let's go uh Matthew chapter 14 this morning but we appreciate the testimonies and it's good to see everybody I tell you what I had a wonderful time on Thanksgiving I it was about 50 of us uh came together some of my cousins I hadn't seen in years had a good time hugging one another's neck and laughing and talking and and I told them we can't be strangers to this we can't just wait till you know every 10 years we need to do this quarter uh every six months or something cuz I my kids don't even know their kids you know my my kids know brother Jack them kids but my side they don't even know my cousins they got other cousins yes right amen uh let's start at um Matthew 14:22 and Jesus straight straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship and to to go before him and to the other side while he sent the multitude away and when he had sent the multitude away he went into the mountains ofart to pray and when the evening was come he was there alone but the ship was now in the midst of the sea t with waves for the wind was contrary and in the Fourth Watch of the night Jesus went unto them walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the seed they were troubled saying is it a spirit and they cried out for fear but straightway Jesus spake unto them saying be of good cheer it is I Be not Afraid and Peter answered him and said Lord if it if it be thou bid me to come unto thee on the water and he said come and when Peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to Jesus but when when he saw the uh wind blusterous uh he was afraid and begin to sink and he cried saying Lord save me and immediately Jesus stretched forth his hands and caught him and said unto them oh thou of a little faith wherefore did thou doubt and when they had come into the ship the wind ceased let's bow ah heads gracious father we thank you this morning we can uh truly say you've been good to us you you just brought us out just about to another uh closing of another year Lord you brought us through seen and unseen dangers and you've provided for us Lord God you just uh one song say you just keep on proving yourself yes and uh we we we just thank you and we praise you oh God this morning we just pray that you can help me to get myself out of the way that um uh you can just be a blessing to your people in Jesus Christ wonderful name amen amen you may be seated uh I want to use as a a subject uh my subject that I've been using the last couple of services uh a scriptural absolute that'll be my subject going into next year but uh we have a context to the text walking undisturbed and and I would just really like to uh say how much I appreciated brother brother Whispers on last week that was just a real master Masterpiece and uh one one of the things I just like to say uh to the ministry uh because maybe the Le don't study the same way the ministry studies and look at things uh you could never get complacent you should never get complacent and feel like well I've been and I've been preaching for 30 years and in 30 years that message was Tade for brother whist it it was the right season and right time cuz I've preached Paradox and I've preached absolute over the years several times right and I just never saw those quotes in correlation I was sitting there like you you this thing this thing is is just next level right but but uh the reason why um that I've been using scriptural absolute just as the basis of everything that I want to preach on and for the things that we hear preach is because you know we we got to be stable yeah and and like he was bringing out a quote that it's something that we must have uhuh we we we we got to if we're going to accomplish anything if we're going to be anything in God you got to you got to have an absolute right amen faith faith has got to have a place to rest itself right and it can't on shift SS of man's Wisdom and things of that nature is that right it it it can't so so this is one of the reasons why I've I've I've titled this you know a scriptural absolute so that we could understand the Bible that we could understand it's just not sermons all right right it's it's something that that's that's tied to us and we're tied to it amen right glor to God and and if we're ever if we're ever going to overcome in this age right we we need what's preached in this age all right yes sir right scripturally we we need sound teaching sound Doctrine am is that right because of the age where uh scripturally you know people don't like to look at the Bible a lot of times but the the and this this just keep y'all bear with me for a minute it takes me a minute to get out of the way but but people don't realize scripturally the scripture says there'll be these false anointed ones false they'll be anointed but with false teachings right glory to God that that if it was possible the very elect would be deceived I'm I'm going say that again if it was possible we would be deceived just like all of the world right right but it's totally impossible uh for the elect of God to be deceived and so we we have to appreciate the son of man ministry right which which is just a ministry that's that's really uh come in this AE to help us to understand the Bible yes sir it's not something outside of the Bible like even the prophet he was talking about the seals on the back of the book he realized that that what he was looking at is the hidden things that were in the book that needed light uh Shone on it that's right that's right is that right amen amen to pull a cover off of or unveil the mystery the things that's been hidden so we we thank God for exposure Hall we think that oh y'all got quiet on me then we we thank God for exposure and with this exposure it's it it reveals Christ right amen amen in US amen that's it well we going to go somewhere this morning we going to go somewhere this morning I I got a lot of hair on my fork and I don't know how far I'm I'mma get uh but I'mma just go to time to quit if if y'all pull I'll preach right if y'all get quiet on me I'll medal y'all do not want me m amen but let let's let's just kind of let's just kind of uh look at the scripture um in in the text um in St Matthew chapter 14 now one one of the things we we just want to uh follow a certain thought right because uh as as disciples they they were they were following the word right the word was was made flesh and was dwelling amongst them uh he was he was uh the the God you know there a lot of things that's been preached over the last few weeks and we appreciate the the Brethren and all the things but they they were called out amen they were being uh uh discipled and and they they were they were following the word they were being committed by the word okay the the word watch watch something right the the word commission they was under a mandate they had they had a purpose right and a part of what he said he he commissioned them or commanded them to get in a boat right and and to to to to move go to the other side is that right yes sir that you know one of the things that you know I want to make clear clear for us this morning we're not a people that's standing still right amen amen and anytime I hear that that bothers me when I hear people say well ain't nothing going on around the word and and and ain't this and it's not this and it's not that those things bother me it just proves to me you lack biblical understanding because we can't be transitioning which we are right sir right right we we're transitioning we we're in a Rapture right sir we're we're moving right we're in a spiritual boat right going to the other side we we've been some song says we been been commissioned by Lord G right I forgot it's just kind of coming to me so so we're under a mandate from almighty God is that right right amen we're we're in a spiritual boat and and you know we're we're on our way yes right yes we're we're on a journey right we're not standing still Church anytime somebody say that you're standing still they do not understand the Bible all right right they do not understand the present day amen Commission of the word all right right come on glory to God Amen we're we're we're on the Move we've been on the Move we've been going somewhere we have not been standing still there's constantly something going on Amen is that right amen but you know we want to show us something this morning because you know uh being on the boat uh and and and you're you're on the journey you you run into uh problems all right come on yeah being on the ride don't alleviate you from problems being a Christian you know that that's going to be uh uh problems is that right cuz the the scripture the scripture says see the ship now in the midst of this and let me tell you something we way down the road now all right now come on we so far down the road we can't turn back all right come on I won't turn back that's it that's it right and and you know being being out here you know uh uh the scripture says the the sea started the toss with the waves for the wind it was it was contrary come on yeah right right it it wasn't just some at ease and Z you know something that you could no the conditions of the ride was was contrary right right glory to God and see and see you know when when we come up against contrary winds right here's the problem now we like to look at this thing historically right but I don't study the Bible from a historical standpoint cuz history what history is fine but it don't do me as much good as present day understanding of the scripture all right is that right glory to God you you in a boat and and and sometimes on the journey things get contrary yes things get things get difficult right right amen it gets it get it really does it gets difficult that's it right glory to God and things got difficult for the disciples but but they they had watch this they were under commission by God yes sir the call of God is that right Jesus told them to go to the other side yes sir right amen he never told him about the contrary winds that was going now let's face this church we serve a sovereign God glory God is infin God knows what you going to go through before you go through it God knows what you going to encounter before you ever encounter amen is that right he told one prophet he said man let me tell you something he said before you was even conceived in the wom of your mama I already knew you that's powerful see way back when your first day as a Christian God knew every test and every trial right that you will go to but he put you on the boat Hallelujah commission to commissioned us to go towards a Rapture to go towards a change to go towards amen a marriage supper to go towards a millennium rign to go towards brother Jack was preaching to us a New Jerusalem but he did not tell us that the ways would be contrary trth but the sovereignty of God knew that it would sir the moment that they got on the boat Jesus knew what was going to happen right it never it never you know kind of T Jesus off of God God it it did but but what what it what it showed it it showed how the humanistic elements could could take over come on and and uh drown us my is that right right and see church I'm going say something here we got to learn to live above negativity negative expectations Right Live above the uh caral humanistic realm we got eye gate ear gate we got these all of these Gates amen and and things can can be overwhelming that's right that's right we don't like to preach like this come come on you know we like to preach Pie in the Sky Christianity but not true amen amen see we we like to come and shout and pretend like you know uh our world is all this and all of that but your facial expression shows a lot of times man you a contrary wins right Hallelujah fear is taking over all right come on fear fear we're going somewhere now Church it it should but but we got to deal in in order for us to live above these things we got to point out these things and and and help us to see these things is that right and to show us uh the differences which we going to do this morning in the walk in the way cuz there's a difference in the way that we walk and then in the way that Jesus walked and and then you know there's still different different you know growth periods and some of us walk on a higher level than others all right but the preaching of the Gospel is trying to bring us all to this place all right where where we walk amen undisturbed is that right glory to God but amen with with the the the the contrary wind it's it brought forth fear yes sir right amen they probably just left some some you know feeding the 5,000 and all of that and probably with sitting there with with a tremendous testimony my man did you see that look look at what we witnessed look at what we were a part of all right amen right yeah and and not even you know a day later they out here and and boy I just I just enjoyed what brother whisper said you know God gives us something that we could hold on to and look back is that right we can look back to right right when it seem like our world is upside downlu we can look back to the things that God has already yes sir is that right amen but when the whims got contrary then then the human element you know or I'll say it like this they started to be affected my right by the the contrary winds all right right glory to God they start real realistically amen they started being affected right by you know that they're thinking oh my what are we going to do come on come on man do you see the winds come on man do you see the waste boy it's kind of bad out there and and listen let me tell you something these were boatmen oh y'all going to make me preach there you these were these were supposedly experienced men come on on a boatos ibly in their element talk about that yeah that's fresh off the press come on huh yeah amen experience supposedly they knew come on come on probably you know probably used to certain levels of trauma and stress that's associated with being out in the sea right amen yeah but but I I believe this was some some Next Level type of thing is that right that maybe they was like feeling inadequate come on you ever been there all right where where you feel like you know man this is this is something that you know what I've not experienced before uhuh yes sir but then the first thing we do we we start looking at the situation not from a Biblical standpoint but from a natural caral humanistic standpoint right I'm G to make a statement this might hurt you but you're going to be all right I think a lot of times as Christians we live more carnally than we do spiritually right we live more Earthly right we all guilty now come on we all guilty of it we're we're more we're more Earthly and caral and non-spiritual then then you know we think we more spiritual but when you really dig down in the word of God you should you see yourself be like I ain't really what I think I ought to be my my thoughts and my actions and the way that I approach things and the way that I look at things it's like Bo i a i a I ain't no bag of chips and whatever you know y'all know what I'm talking about all right I ain't all that come on brother right that's the truth come on be be because we we allow the contrariness of Our Lives to just uh overtake us wow wow wow right you know they they were starting to you know they was fearful yeah because of the conditions that surrounded them all right amen hadn't even overtaken them but they was they was in it it was surrounding them and they started operating Amen in fear all right right amen Jess was in a great having a great time Thanksgiving all right yeah sat down and ate and took up back full of fool I heard brother Jack talk about leftovers boy I about demolish them leftovers day man I cook some jerk chicken Lord have [Music] mercy B start hey Bo I'm starting to get back in that kitchen I'm starting to scare myself boy it's like my boys be like Dad boy and the more they the more they pump me the more I want to cook boy I tell you but man I tell you what they started operating amen and you know you know Jesus watch something watch something Jesus always comes in the darkest hour right amen you know I I'm so grateful that that God knows what we going to go through before we go through yeah and and sometimes God God allow thing to to to just seem like overwhelm us to a certain degree and but he's on his way yes sir when when when the contrary seed start cutting up all right Jesus had gone up you know to kind of you know cuz you know he the god amen he the great Shepherd just to to assess the situation amen he I I could imagine he probably said well I guess it's my time to make my entrance cuz uh they get scared oh my God huh he was in he was in a position right I believe and spiritually Rec could recognize that you know what these boys going to get scared in this situation come on all right come on yeah Jesus Jesus came walking you know I'm going get to something but I'm feeling good come on Jesus came walking to to on the water now now I I don't know if I want to read it or just preach on it Jesus listen church I got a quote here where where brother Brer makes a statement he says you know uh and this is where I got my tit he say Jesus came walking undisturbed it's in here I got the quote right he said Jesus came walking on the water he had see he had substance Faith sir right he had a real revelation of who he was is that right amen he was he was a he was different amen right Jesus was different was nothing ordinary about Jesus right he was he was past the carnal mind figuring out yes sir you know when I be hearing people on the on on the net and they be posting and writing and all of that I just I be like listen you'll never understand the Bible from an intellectual standpoint cuz the Revelation is hid from the wise imp Putin and reveals to Bab such as we learn if if you're not willing to humble yourself and learn you'll miss God a million miles you'll miss what God is doing in your season in your time by your intellect you never understand God by being smart right because smart men in the Bible couldn't see the further part of the word being made manifest the priest educated Scholars educated men but amen when it came down to the unfolding of the word of God Amen they couldn't see it amen they didn't have no representation but here was a woman here was a here was a woman that that couldn't come out with the rest of the women that was probably looked down on as as a nothing cast out and and smashed and talked about and everything else amen when she met the word yes and and the word got the talking to her right she recognized something is that right amen man I believe you're a prophet amen the the one that's supposed to come I'm him it it didn't take all of you know I'm praying and I'm studying and uh no it was some representation she was hearing from her diony her theophany Quicken something down in her heart she said my God dropped what she was doing and ran out testifying Hallelujah while the priest was trying to figure out all the things that was wrong with the message God she gravitated towards it amen she she grasp it wholeheartedly why because she was simple she was humble amen is that right amen glory to God but Jesus Jes Jesus you know he came now now watch same conditions the same conditions that brought about fear right Jesus walked in them same same conditions Wow Come on come on Amen the waves was contrary and they was fearful Glory to God Amen conditions didn't change yet probably got a little worse huh Jesus just kept on walking I like how brother BR say he said you know that thing stop flattening out before him all right all right what was what what was before saw saw amen the master coming it was like rolling out the red carpet amen the king of king and the Lord of Lord is coming let's lay down before him bow down before him amen come on Glory come on the creator of the elements recognize their master sir GL right and just laid down before him right amen his faith produced the surface listen no nobody could ever talk about nothing walking on the water before Jesus that was unheard of Amen let's face it you know a lot of time when people feel like they understand the Bible they miss God because he's so unusual that's a quote that's it he does things that's unusual he does things that's different right right amen huh amen the trend is the trend and that's why you can't follow the trend you got to follow the word the look cuz look at the trends now right look look at look at what what the the core religious world is is and how they're moving and it's like these things are so contrary to the scripture we we're we're injecting so many things that's so contrary uh to script dis inclusions and you know no hell and and and you know all of this Universal teaching all right now that's bit it it happened even back in the Book of Romans all right where they was wor worshiping the creation more than the Creator amen okay is that right and Scientology and and just all of these different things man that that they're they're injecting right that would deceive us but we predestinated we predestinated I feel like Peter I'm not going anywhere where can I go right right when when when I've tapped into something that that'll that'll speed me up amen that I I'll step into another dimension Eternal yeah right come on that's right come on that's right glory to God Amen you you got to you got to appreciate it see Jesus you know Jesus was was walking under this you know and let's think about it look at the look at the conditions right that surround us that are contrary to scripture right all sorts of perversions yes on on on every level on on every level right glory to God on on every level so contrary but Jesus moves undisturbed am amen unchallenged by it amen wasn't deceived by it wasn't wasn't moved by it right we we we we uh in the midst of this country contar we we we you know we this is where we are but it's not the way we should be but we're moved by by almost everything come on right things things Shake us oh my when it shouldn't amen amen right it shouldn't right glory to God it shouldn't look at look at Jesus come come walk walking on the on the water right and and they were fearful yes sir is this a ghost right that's right I can imagine Jesus like man I been with y'all all the time and y'all y'all y'all still don't no people people because you can sit up in church and not recognize the word right see because we we people want to make it historical we want to make it present day work alive and living yes sir not just you know uh shores of Galilee all right we talking about present day Enlightenment all right amen right the present day word in our midst is that right amen glory to God that's the thing that but they couldn't recognize it they they were the the very thing that was moving on the scene to bring a difference all right under their circumstances that was the thing that they was afraid of the very thing that was coming right to bring about chain anytime Christ comes on the scene he comes to bring chain right yes sir transformation change the condition am but the very thing that comes to bring about the change in our lives that's the very thing amen we're afraid of huh there's people that's afraid of the word amen amen glory to God we like church we like religion uhhuh and and we we we we think we want Christ but that's the very thing that we're rejecting right we're rejecting when you rejecting the word you're rejecting Christ I'm going keep moving cuz y'all y'all you know y'all going down but but uh right the the the very thing that comes in this season that that that you know uh we should embrace they should have been e excited about the coming work yes sir amen right amen glory to God knowing that you know what when he comes things happen amen amen little is much when he shows up Hallelujah glory to God boy he'll take a look right like brother the brother whisper was saying they should have looked at my God the uh two fish and Five Loaves and all that got fed and what they took up but the very thing that was coming on the scene to produce am man a change that was the thing that they was like is this a ghost wow is is this real wow is is this the word yes that's right my I'm right yes sir it was the word coming yes sir brother right in the in that darkest hour he he comes on the scene yes sir see amen you know um um Satan can't do anything as long as you abide in God's calling all right praise God they never got that they never got that is that right amen that that they was purposed by God they hadn't even got they had hadn't really got into Ministry yet right so nothing couldn't happen to them cuz God hadn't really started using them yet glory to God glory to God Amen but the very thing that that was coming on the scene to save them but they was scared wow man is that a ghost what is that right and this is the mind set of people what is that do you I could imagine you know having a conference do you believe that that's him come on they they were so they were so overwhelmed by the S the the symptoms and the contrariness you know of the elements around them that they could not re recognize right so much so he says listen it is I right wow wow it's the word right it is I be of good cheer right right right but but they were so because of the humanistic real the the the the what they saw right you know and then then then you know Peter always been one of them ones who you know especially back in them days had a little bit of something you know he'll cut ears off you know he the first man to draw sword wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute boy I wish they would all right Jesus is like they are and you ain't going to do nothing about it when when it really comes down to The Showdown you going to be like everybody else you going to disappear and cuss on your way out huh Jesus Peter was something else wasn't he yeah you know but you know Peter was always just that one that just had a little something about him you know that was different I believe God just like the ones that's a little different peculiar right right the world don't get you because you you know you peculiar right you're a Mystic Jesus was a Mystic to the world they couldn't understand him the world right shouldn't be able to understand us we should be so mystical to the world is that right man these people man I don't understand these people you ain't supposed to right is that right they couldn't Jesus Jesus this is a quote too go back to perfect faith I got it but I ain't going to read it I'm going just talk to talk about it right amen you know Jesus lived in a world of his own right he was here but he was in that land right y'all don't know nothing about that right cuz we we live so here and now and present and caral right glory to God it's the truth now y'all may not say Amen it's okay but but you know it we're so we're so here and so present and and and so caring about the world and what the world thinks and the world's ideas and and and all of that that we don't even know how to live like Christians we don't even really know how to be what we supposed to be on right right glory to God glory to God now Jesus he's he's teaching us something see we didn't probably see we make this historical but this this is not a historical lesson this morning right right this present day amen this food and season is that right we peel we are peeling the layers off of the onion this morning glory is that right glory to God glory and and and you know Jes Jesus like we say he was walking undisturbed God right think about that let's let's let's you got to tap in like the things that moved them didn't move him all right true right he wasn't he was he he didn't allow watch this he didn't allow amen his senses of sight reasoning and all of that to move him right right amen those things did not control him he wasn't and see if they if according to the prophet if those things try to control you you got see you can't you can't live by those things come on Church come on church amen Jesus was moving amen undisturbed just walking here they are in fear right questioning whether or not this is the word and all of that and you know what with all of the questions Jesus still was undisturbed praise God when they putting all of this on the Facebook and all of this on that yeah won even be moved by that that don't it it don't bother me it don't move me I'm not moved by that right I'm moving the way that I supposed to be moving undisturbed that's it right that's it glory to God oh they said this why they supposed to be saying that he told them that it listen if if if your master gone through all of this arm yourself likewise amen right amen they supposed to be trying to break down right to their detriment right break down dissect and it's like well go do what you got to do you know it was so messed up Jesus told told uh uh uh Judas he said man right at the end he said man you know what go do what you got to do and do it quickly cuz I ain't really moved by what you doing I see you I see it right but I ain't moved by it I ain't I why he he was living in in such a a mystical real there you he was living in a in a place of knowing a place of knowledge spiritual Insight right Lord right amen knowing you know what what these folks would do right so he was like listen whatever you going to do do that do it do it do that do that do that you you got your place I got m place all right there that's a contrast right you the negative part of the contrast you know I'm the positive so you just kind of go right glory to God Amen I'm try to wind this up but but I feel good this morning all right right good work but but then watch watch

I ain't reading it but I know where it's at yes sir come was his commissioned come on amen he was commissioned by the word to come amen get out your boat and walk yes sir right jumped out the boat right and and he started he started walking for a minute he was F fulfilling amen the the call of God right and then watch this this watch this he got his eyes off of the word and the commission and back on the circumstances right and he here's here's the thing then the circumstances started to overwhelm them right the the the the the the circumstances the winds and the you you know the the the way that the prophet illustrates it right he said them white caps man was rolling in they was big Wow when he start and this is us this is us a lot of times we we we start out one way with with with you know a substance faith and we be walking but then we get we get our eyes off of the word right see and and start to get getting our eyes on our surroundings and what other people are doing and what other people got and they got a bigger church and they got a bigger choir and and her husband look better than my husband and they drive a better car y'all don't to talk to me they got a bigger house and they got a bigger this and they children that and right and then these these things starts to overwhelm us and then the next thing you know we once were walking and now we start to sinking right amen see the the difference the the the difference in failure and success is the way that we walk and what we got our eyes on right see cuz let's let's face the church God is still able to give us the desires of our heart if we just keep walking up right before him that's right right sister Zelma testified of that this morning that's right I don't think I ever heard sister zela talk like that in church she always you know real calm and you know quiet and I've been knowing sister Zelma for about 36 years right Hallelujah you don't never hardly hear but she testified when I take of the goodness of Jesus where y'all make me preach in all that he's done for me well one of these days brother Jack I'mma turn it loose my soul my soul boy that that was a hallelujah praise there this morning right that's right but but look at look at what caused him to drown circumstances he was drowning in his in the circumstances that was around him because he got his sights on that and took his sights off of the word now I could read the quotes but I sister Tina got us whoever over there they got them I got them too in in my computer the the moment and this is our problem the moment we get our eyes off of the word yeah off of the commission come right man man you start all that circumstances next thing you know bloopo you start going down bloop bloop bloop bloop whose fault is it who fault is it it's your fault you got your eyes off of the word blop bloop bloop huh who could Peter blame right for him almost drowning glory to God come on I'mma tell y'all something the gospel is more deeper than we give give it credit for I'm telling you Church the the the the the more I I I look at the word and and I study the word of God and everything I'll be like oh I don't know what kind of Christian that I've thought I've been all of these years but it hasn't not dis christianizing us but sometimes I look and be like this thing is a lot more deeper than than what I'm living come on church I'm going pull y'all a minute come on it's a lot more and I actions shows us scripturally see because we we we we supposed to be operating a certain way if we UND undisturbed by what's surrounding us come on see those things never change Jesus right circumstances and situations never move Jesus out of his position come on never move Jesus out of his position right he he wasn't moved by all of those different things why he was the author he was the word made flesh he was unchallenged all right unmoved see he whooped the devil in a place of try with it's written right he he wasn't you know you know I know I'm hungry but now the word I'm looking at the word I got I got I'm focused on the word I'm living in this this place this realm you know I might seem crazy you know uh to the world but I understand who I am right and and and everything thing is going on around you boy look at them white caps boy that's big and then how am I then I it probably went from that and how am I even walking what's underneath there now he goes you've been all this time and now you starting to wonder what's under there what am I actually walking on yes yes yes right yes glory to God and then and then he started actually and there it's so many people around christiandom that's drowning that's drowning in Pride drowning in so so so many things depression and O drowning right but I ain't finished I ain't the end of the story yet could the song say he wouldn't Let Me Drown see amen he oh he's going to prove to you in the end of the story that he's still God yes he's still Jehovah Gyra huh glory to God but Peter Peter Peter started drowning amen and you know uh unbelief looking at this and looking at that but one thing I could say but when when brother Garrett gave his testimony I said boy they they they they about to preach my little message this morning him and sister Z like man I might was just gone out there and say let's read the script and go home one thing brother Garen say he ain't let pride get him Peter was drowning Peter Peter Peter was drowning but he he he wasn't proud and sometimes people be drowning and and they they get we we you know we and we all somewhere in our lives has been culprit we be so proud We won't say Lord help us I'm drowning this thing is getting the better of me BL this thing is getting BL blo BL Lord help me BL BL blo think about it huh I'm going down man I'm filling up with water bloop Ain that Pride a that Pride Lord help me you know some some days that's some days I can't pray yeah some days I feel like Lord I don't know what how to pray right huh all I could say is Lord help me some sometimes I [Applause] right th this is reality yes it is yes it is when when when I should be walking UND Disturbed sometimes you know we we get our eyes on our circumstances and the situation and how this look and how that look and this ain't going to never change and that who said that Hallelujah huh that look at the problem that the spies got into we look like giants who said that what that got to do with anything what Giants occupying the space got to do with anything the word say this is our l hallu and we going over and get it it's already ready for us we got to just go over and possess it man man J in the land shut your mouth right you ought to te your eyes shut your mouth tell your spirit shut your mouth amen come on yes sir or you going are you going to say shut I don't care how big the White Caps is Oh Glory but you know what Peter Peter wasn't proud Peter said Lord help me huh you know and and I was looking at something you know Jesus Jesus came on the scene he had a purpose right sir to bring about a change in the circumstances in the situation but here's the thing thank God that Jesus has never been undisturbed in his walk by anything that that he could operate amen a certain way right come on yeah he could cuz watch this amen even though you know Jesus had the ability he had to want to or had to have the desire to right cuz Jesus could have got upset said boy you you out here you was walking you know how we you was out here and we you was walking and now look at you woo y'all quiet now Jesus hey Lord Praise right come on now I'm I'm I'mma turn the corner then I'm going close right right Jesus Jesus could have got right close to him and let him drown huh amen Jesus he Jesus we got to realize Jesus Jesus knew what the situation would be he knew that when it got to that point he would be willing to reach down and pick him up right and then okay let's not make this historical what about us what what about Christ and bride form what what about the word made flesh right what about us being little Messiah yes when when people what what do we do when we find people that's being overwhelmed by their circumstances and situations right because we like to look at the Jesus of the Bible and we like to pray looking up but what about the what will the god in you do come on all right all right when when when you face with with people that are drowning do you reach down right right yeah and give them some sort of assistance some sort of uh moral uh you know benefit some type of encouragement you know uh you know maybe you you like the you know the prodal S brother but don't went out there spent all your money hone now you coming wagging your Tails back and you broke busted disgusted can't be look at you all right you know it's it's like you rubbing the dogs nose in his own boo boo huh yeah yeah are you the father but boy coming home right he he already low he already drowning you know blo blo I'm going back to my father's house blo bloop right the brother the brother like boy I hope you got some good lungs the father came down right amen see Jesus Jesus you know the purpose of Jesus is to pull us out and up out of our circumstances right so that we can begin to walk unfaced undisturbed is that right that's powerful Church the purpose of Jesus coming was was not to belit Peter right but look at you look at y'all you know he did say man y'all y'all got a little faith and and here here's my last statement you know and and and here here's here's Humanity here's here's Christianity we pretend to have faith but we really don't not not perfect faith not substance Faith right we got a Faith with no no substance that's a quote that's in there right why I got faith you a got no substance you ain't walking on nothing right you ain't going to get nowhere without substance hallelujah oh glory to God Amen so this morning you know we we're not here to you know if you bloop bloop bloop it's it's it's our job as a Ministry to reach down and to help pull you up out of right so you get a good deep breath well that was a lot of water but there was a lot going on that you could be thankful you could be a preacher to I could imagine I could imagine Peter like boy if you if you hadn't been there where will we be right you know what I could look back if it so many times if if it if if it hadn't been for for the Lord who was on my side right right come on Church th this whole year if it had not been for the Lord who is on my side right I would be swallowed clean up I would be so overcome so fed up with water I'm just laid out he done drown but he wouldn't Let Me [Applause] Drown his purpose in coming was so that I would not drown see Peter Peter could have drowned on the water but they could have drowned in the boat cuz the circumstances could have just as well overcame why yeah I ain't never been out there like that in in in a hurricane white C caps is big as this school up up there right 22 feet swell I don't want to experience nothing like that that what an experience but Jesus came and watch this anytime Jesus come he bring a calm right anytime he com he bring a cal this this should be such a calm in our Spirits right the the the the enemy want us to be hysterical let me just made the way want us to feel overwhelmed and this and that and you know but this should be a cuz if Jesus is here if he's present there should be a peace in our spirit right amen as long as we looking at the word and and walking undisturbed man I tell you what that's such a peace I you know I don't think Jesus was oh my God what am I going to man I'm going to my boys is that right amen let's give the Lord a hand of Praise turn it back over turn it back over to brother Jack amen amen [Applause] praise the Lord amen um certainly appreciate brother smiley on today and um tell you what you you ought to leave here no matter what you're going through um have a determination that you're going to walk [Music] undisturbed as he was just even reading the Scripture it just kind of struck me how uh when Peter begin to sink and and begin to call on the Lord Jesus uh Jesus said oh ye of little faith and I thought to myself you know as he was just reading and like well wow I mean um had to take Faith to get out that boat it had to take Faith to get out that boat but for Jesus to say you you have little faith it went back to what brother Smiler was saying you know it's really all dependent upon uh your your success or your failures depending upon one thing what are you looking at and when Peter took his eyes off of Jesus CU his faith was when he had his eyes on Jesus he could and even just the word come you know I'm thinking myself How would how did Peter just move out just simply on that if you if it be you then B me come how did he just move out on come I I believe the reason they was able to do is because the voice that spoke come was a very familiar voice to Peter and he said that got to be the same God that you know that that that has been walking with me talking to me I'm going I'm going to trust him and it it took Faith to get out that boat but when he begin to sink he say oh ye of little faith it's because he took his Eyes Off Of God whatever you do today I want to encourage you put your eyes back on Christ and keep walking keep moving forward amen no matter what the circumstance no matter what the situation it'll bring you through you believe that amen he can calm the stor and make the sun shine again stand and help me sing it I know the master the come on I know the master I know the master of the way oh I know he can come a St oh make the sun shine again oh I know come on sing
