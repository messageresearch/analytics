[38:26] just pray for them safe journey amen
[38:29] back home let's turn here to Revelation
[38:31] 10 we read this on last week and um um I
[38:36] just kind of felt like the Holy Spirit
[38:38] every everything I was reading was like
[38:40] popping off the you know the pages I'm
[38:43] like I if I keep going we going to be
[38:45] here for 2 or three hours so sometimes
[38:48] you just have to just pull back and just
[38:50] don't don't keep the people that long
[38:52] you know there'll be another service if
[38:54] the Lord T and we'll get more you know
[38:57] from the next service so uh but we just
[38:59] want to pick up where we left off amen
[39:01] we're still in our thought of get back
[39:03] in step and uh and as I'm seeing this
[39:06] this is just uh it it's it's so Grand to
[39:11] me uh this is even for those that might
[39:15] even um you know like I told you there's
[39:18] people that's never heard these things
[39:20] before they're watched online they never
[39:21] heard it but the get back and step theme
[39:23] is for them as well because it's the
[39:26] Holy Spirit calling back to a place in
[39:29] Christ oh my my my my if we could see
[39:33] what God was doing in this hour uh but
[39:35] here Revelation 10 and as I read this uh
[39:39] this is not a past tense uh I mean I'm
[39:44] this is not a a future tense but this is
[39:45] a past tense scripture things that have
[39:48] already happened oh my glory to God so
[39:53] let's read amen Revelation 10:1 says and
[39:55] I saw another Mighty angel
[39:58] uh come down from heaven clothed with a
[40:01] cloud uh and a
[40:05] rainbow glory to God was upon his head
[40:07] and his face was as it were the Sun and
[40:10] his feet as pillars of fire and he had
[40:12] in his hand a little a book open and he
[40:15] set his right foot upon the sea and his
[40:17] left foot upon left foot on the earth
[40:20] cried with a loud voices when a lion
[40:22] Roth and when he had cried seven
[40:25] Thunders uttered their voices and and
[40:28] when I say this is a past tense um
[40:31] scripture uh let me declare we actually
[40:34] know what the seven Thunders
[40:38] utter this church and there's other
[40:41] churches all over the world that know
[40:44] what the seven Thunders uttered because
[40:46] a prophet told us that the seven
[40:49] Thunders uttered what was inside the
[40:51] seals so when you listen to The Seven
[40:54] Seals you know what the Thunders uttered
[40:57] amen praise God it's it's in our hands
[41:00] past tense glory to God Amen and verse
[41:04] uh verse 5 says and the angel which I
[41:07] saw stand upon the sea and upon the
[41:09] Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and
[41:12] swear by him that liveth forever and
[41:14] ever who created heaven and the things
[41:17] that therein are and the earth and the
[41:19] things that therein are and the Sea and
[41:21] the things which are therein that there
[41:23] should be time no longer uh but in the
[41:25] days of The Voice of the seventh angel
[41:29] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[41:30] of God shall be finished as he have
[41:33] declared to his servants the prophets
[41:35] now let me uh just go back to
[41:38] Joel uh 2 because what we just saw as
[41:42] far as when the when that seventh angel
[41:44] sounds the mystery of God will be
[41:46] finished uh that is right here in Joel 2
[41:50] as
[41:51] well um this is um
[41:55] um uh
[41:57] verse 25 I'll just just give you that
[42:00] one and I will restore to you the years
[42:02] that the Locust have eaten the korm and
[42:05] the caterpillar and the palore and my
[42:06] great Army which I sent among you so
[42:10] this restoration happens at the same
[42:12] time that all the Mysteries are revealed
[42:16] amen praise God so let's pray amen
[42:19] father we thank you for the ability to
[42:22] read the word but we know it takes the
[42:24] Holy Spirit to help us understand what
[42:26] it is that we have read so father we
[42:29] trust that the the Holy Ghost will come
[42:31] now and anoint this portion of the
[42:33] service just as you've anointed uh the
[42:36] musicians and their playing and and uh
[42:39] the song leader and leading Us in songs
[42:41] a special that went forth by Sister
[42:43] Sharice and everything that has happened
[42:45] the congregation enter into this this
[42:48] this this place of worship and God we uh
[42:51] we just appreciate all that you're doing
[42:52] in our midst we pray father that you
[42:54] would just bless Lord this portion of
[42:56] the service and bless those that we here
[42:58] not just present but those online and
[43:00] God just remember each one remember
[43:01] brother Smiley as he's there ministering
[43:04] the word of the Lord today use them for
[43:06] your glory god you know what that church
[43:08] is in need of so we ask that you'd help
[43:10] them to get himself out of the way that
[43:11] you could use them there all the other
[43:13] saints that are traveling Lord uh for
[43:15] the various reasons pray that you bless
[43:17] them and watch over them and keep them
[43:19] Lord until they return uh we just trust
[43:22] God that you take control over this
[43:23] portion of the service in Jesus name we
[43:25] pray amen amen God bless you can be
[43:27] seated I also want to mention so good to
[43:30] see sister Isabelle Amen in service
[43:32] today she's been working so much but she
[43:34] finally got a Sunday off amen God bless
[43:36] you Sister Isabelle amen praise the Lord
[43:40] all right all right amen so we we
[43:43] continue our journey I want to just go
[43:45] back to the quote that I was trying to
[43:47] read last week and uh we'll just uh go
[43:50] forward from there we we
[43:54] um uh speaking from a place of just
[43:57] seeing the scripture already manifested
[44:01] and uhu and there are things that um
[44:03] like I said there are people that that
[44:05] have no idea of these things that that
[44:07] we are talking about uh for us it may be
[44:10] just going over refresher we've heard it
[44:11] for years uh but that's okay the the
[44:14] reason that we have to keep preaching
[44:16] because we're looking for the last
[44:18] seed Amen to come uh that last person
[44:21] that would
[44:22] recognize um you know that what day
[44:25] they're living in
[44:27] so you know it's very important for us
[44:29] to make sure that they have Clarity amen
[44:33] uh anointed ones at the end time is
[44:34] where I'm reading from and um this um
[44:39] this quote goes along with Revelation
[44:42] 107 so brother brandom helps us to
[44:45] understand this says notice compare them
[44:49] together uh when now when you get home
[44:53] notice Matthew
[44:55] 24:24 and that's a very very very
[44:58] important
[45:00] scripture um praise the Lord very
[45:04] important scripture because um there we
[45:08] find a statement made by Jesus that um
[45:14] if it were
[45:15] possible it would deceive the very elect
[45:19] and and and and what what I've come to
[45:21] realize is that since I am
[45:25] elect then I can not be
[45:29] deceived because Jesus spoke a word over
[45:32] me and there's people sometimes a little
[45:35] afraid to step out you know and and take
[45:37] a hold of this message because they're
[45:39] not used to uh God using prophets
[45:42] they're they're not used to that type of
[45:44] language or the prophets that they're
[45:46] talking about is somebody that rose up
[45:48] and Prophet
[45:50] lied right I mean so they're afraid of
[45:52] that but but when you got bogus dollars
[45:55] just remember it has to be at least one
[45:56] real dollar somewhere to make all the
[45:58] bogus dollars amen but but when God
[46:01] promises that he's going to use certain
[46:03] Ministries and and he's going to do
[46:05] certain things we have to look for that
[46:07] to be fulfilled in the scripture amen
[46:09] things that happened after Jesus died
[46:12] and rose again amen so so so we have to
[46:15] be able to kind of catch these things
[46:16] and and this is our job to try to try to
[46:18] bring that forth but but here he says
[46:21] compare it compare it compare them
[46:23] together now when you get home Matthew
[46:25] 24:24 4 Jesus speaking Paul in 2 Timothy
[46:30] 3:8 many others he says now compare that
[46:33] he says and then put another scripture
[46:36] Luke 17:30 and Malachi 4 wait a minute
[46:40] compare what all right compare Matthew
[46:45] 24:24 which tells us that the very elect
[46:48] can't be
[46:49] deceived and then compare that with St
[46:52] Luke 17:30 and Malachi 4 so when we see
[46:56] the man estation of Malachi 4 and we see
[46:59] the manifestation of St Luke 17:30 then
[47:02] we know the elect will not be deceived
[47:07] the elect will know this is a part of
[47:09] scripture yes sir amen we are living in
[47:13] the days of scripture being fulfilled
[47:16] Hallelujah we'll go a little further
[47:18] here amen he says this he says um as
[47:21] Janice and jambre with stood Moses the
[47:24] anointed word of the hour so will these
[47:28] men not man men anointed ones resist the
[47:33] truth and this ain't nothing but the
[47:35] truth if you look at believe the sign or
[47:38] you've heard about that they used to
[47:39] believe the sign but they stopped
[47:41] believing it and uh but it's men that
[47:43] rose up and start resisting the truth
[47:46] and still doing it he says in the very
[47:48] day that the son of man is revealed
[47:50] Revelations 10
[47:53] 1-7 read it when you get home we just
[47:55] read it the seventh Angel's message
[47:58] opening up the seals what is it not the
[48:01] angel is the son of man the son of man
[48:05] not the angel is the son of man we're
[48:07] going to read this scripture in a little
[48:08] bit but but just bear with me not the
[48:11] angel is the son of man we not here just
[48:15] promoting brother brandom please don't
[48:18] don't don't misunderstand us we're not
[48:21] here what it is and like like like like
[48:23] my mom said and I just loved that said
[48:24] no we're not putting him on the same
[48:26] level of of of Jesus that is not what
[48:28] we're doing but what we are doing is
[48:30] we're putting them on the same level as
[48:31] Paul and as
[48:33] Moses amen and in Moses day they had to
[48:36] say what Moses said right amen and still
[48:39] today we saying what Paul said right
[48:41] right I mean he's the one that came and
[48:43] gave us 2/3 of the New Testament if
[48:47] things were over after Jesus died and
[48:49] rose again why did Paul Come Along Paul
[48:52] was not even Walking With
[48:54] Jesus huh Paul Paul was fighting against
[48:58] Jesus and he was living during that time
[49:01] but Paul was Paul received a revelation
[49:04] and with that Revelation wrote 2/3 of
[49:06] the New Testament we thank God for what
[49:08] Paul
[49:09] wrote we thank God for what brother
[49:11] Brandon preached because it was the same
[49:13] thing all right let's let's go on a
[49:15] little further he says this says now not
[49:18] the angel is the son of man but the
[49:21] messenger is revealing the son of man
[49:25] can you get it separated at now and
[49:27] that's important that we all get that
[49:29] separated get it separated keep it
[49:32] separated all right amen he says that's
[49:35] where it seems to be so hard for you see
[49:38] says not the son of man himself but the
[49:41] seventh angel the seventh messenger is
[49:44] revealing to the public the son of man
[49:47] because it's left a shook now I'm going
[49:49] to say this again amen while I'm here
[49:51] you know one of the things brother
[49:53] brandom taught us he says if you reading
[49:55] your Bible and uh and you can't see
[49:58] Christ in the scripture he says go back
[50:01] and read it again all right glory to God
[50:04] he said the other things that Jesus
[50:06] Christ is the principal theme of all of
[50:10] this Jesus Christ is the principal theme
[50:13] of this message that we believe Jesus
[50:16] Christ is the principal he should be the
[50:18] Principal theme of any sermon that we're
[50:20] presenting from the pull pit glory to
[50:23] God he say so so so he he already told
[50:25] us that that Jesus Christ the principal
[50:27] them that's why we don't sing songs in
[50:31] this church amen that don't honor
[50:34] Christ hello
[50:37] somebody glory to God and I know people
[50:40] got songs in this message that just talk
[50:42] all about brother Brandon but nothing
[50:44] about Jesus we don't sing them songs
[50:47] because he told us that Jesus Christ
[50:50] should be the Principal them of it
[50:55] all praise the Lord
[50:58] somebody all right all right all right
[51:00] let's go on it says um uh uh it it's Le
[51:03] the Shu he can't organize it it's the
[51:05] grain itself again he says and in the
[51:07] day Jan Janice and jambre will withstand
[51:11] anointed ones make Believers and
[51:13] unbelievers the church former and the
[51:15] Pentecostals stand up against the True
[51:18] Grain but let them alone their Folly
[51:21] will be made manifest as theirs was see
[51:24] you understand now it goes on it says
[51:26] Revelation 10 said in the days of the
[51:29] sounding of the seventh angel now
[51:32] remember seventh leoda Church age and
[51:35] that's why I'm I mentioned to y'all when
[51:37] we read Revelation 10:7 and it talks
[51:39] about at the sounding of the seventh
[51:41] Angel's message the MS of God will be
[51:43] finished what Angel is he referring to
[51:45] that angel is the same one found in
[51:47] Revelation 3:14 which is the messenger
[51:50] to the lean Church age so brother
[51:53] Brandon's Ministry is identified in both
[51:56] Revelation 3:14 Revelation 10:7 both is
[52:00] is his ministry all right God promised
[52:02] it let's go on amen he says this now uh
[52:07] uh the sounding of that angel when the
[52:09] church age is done denominated and
[52:11] become a church age when it's done when
[52:13] when it's done in the Pentecostal
[52:15] organization when the messenger to that
[52:17] what what was each messenger what was
[52:19] Martin Luther a rebuke to the Catholic
[52:22] amen what was Wesley a rebuke to them
[52:25] lutherans and it's so important that we
[52:28] you know uh I I as as um you know some
[52:33] of us were not born in this message we
[52:34] come from different denominational
[52:37] backgrounds uh you know but understand
[52:39] that when Luther came out Luther was
[52:42] protesting all the things that he saw
[52:44] wrong in the Catholic church and he
[52:46] nailed his 95 thesis to the church door
[52:49] and say enough is enough something's got
[52:51] to change when God was uh when God
[52:54] anointed Luther to do that that's how we
[52:56] know a move was
[52:58] on Amen and Luther happened to be a
[53:01] messenger to the Sardis Church age amen
[53:04] but but Luther them got denominated now
[53:06] it was not Luther that started the
[53:09] Lutheran denomination it was the people
[53:11] that was following Luther that started
[53:14] that denomination and as soon as it
[53:17] denominated yes God was using it but as
[53:20] soon as it denominated God stopped using
[53:23] it and he moved on to his next next part
[53:26] of the plan
[53:27] and the next part of God's plan was to
[53:29] raise up a man by the name of John
[53:34] Wesley praise the Lord John Wesley was a
[53:38] star in the hand of Jesus he was a
[53:41] messenger to the Philadelphian Church
[53:44] Age come on church amen and he begin to
[53:47] preach a a gospel that that begin to
[53:49] bring the people back to the word and
[53:51] and Luther preached uh the the
[53:54] justification just shall live by faith
[53:56] but Wesley begin to preach
[53:59] sanctification oh my my my my my my my
[54:02] and as as as Wesley begin to preach amen
[54:06] a new organization started now after
[54:09] Wesley left the scene they start a new
[54:11] organization what is this new
[54:12] organization the
[54:15] Methodist right but Wesley was not the
[54:17] one started it's the people that came
[54:19] after the Wesley that started that yet
[54:22] God was in it but when they start a
[54:24] denomination what does God do move on
[54:26] again where did God move to God moved to
[54:31] the
[54:32] Pentecostals when they were not a
[54:34] denomination when they were just people
[54:36] amen going from place to place house to
[54:39] house almost having prayer meetings and
[54:41] God came
[54:43] down because it was time amen for God to
[54:46] do something with this
[54:49] restoration but but but William Seymour
[54:51] and all the ones back in that time here
[54:53] they were H used by God but when they
[54:57] became a denomination yeah we got two
[55:00] that that that that came out of it we
[55:01] got the the the Church of God in Christ
[55:04] amen and we got the Assemblies of God
[55:07] and it was divided over color of
[55:09] skin Lord oh can I I can say some things
[55:14] here a church should not be divided over
[55:17] the color of skin come on somebody a
[55:20] church should be United by the word of
[55:23] God we we have the look Beyond skin
[55:26] color when we get to the other side we
[55:28] might as well look beyond that
[55:31] now and when you really think about it
[55:33] praise God I don't care what your skin
[55:35] color is I don't care what nation you
[55:38] come from if when when we when we really
[55:41] think about it we

[56:09] something greater than a natural
[56:10] bloodline that keeps us connected
[56:13] together and that is the blood of the
[56:15] Lord Jesus Christ this gospel is not to
[56:19] divide this gospel unites
[56:23] us blessed be the name of the Lord so
[56:26] when you see the the the Pentecostal
[56:28] organization go out into their separate
[56:30] ways like that God leaves it and he
[56:34] moves on to something else where can we
[56:36] find them
[56:37] today in the end time message of the
[56:42] hour because that's the word of God that
[56:44] has come back to restore the people to
[56:47] where they're supposed to be let us keep
[56:50] reading my God my God he says what what
[56:53] what was each messenger what was Martin
[56:54] Luther a rebuke to the the Catholic what
[56:57] was Wesley a rebuke to them lutherans
[56:59] what was what was the Pentecost a rebuke
[57:02] to them mothers where has the life gone
[57:05] now away from an organization no more
[57:09] shck it's the grain what what what what
[57:11] is it a rebuke to the Pentecost see
[57:14] fulfill the scripture of this hour see
[57:18] let's go on it says notice the very day
[57:21] when this messenger not when he starts
[57:23] on but when he begins to declare his
[57:26] message see the first pull healing
[57:30] second pull prophesying third pull the
[57:34] opening of the word when the seals was
[57:37] preached opening of the word and many
[57:39] other things amen that he already
[57:41] preached before he got to the seals it
[57:43] says the opening of the word the
[57:45] Mysteries reveal no more there is no
[57:49] more higher order to reveal the word
[57:53] than
[57:55] Prophets this is this very important cuz
[57:57] God said in his word surely I'll do
[57:59] nothing unless I reveal my secrets to my
[58:01] servants the prophets that's Amos 3:7 so
[58:04] no higher order to reveal the word amen
[58:07] than the prophets all right he says uhh
[58:11] he says uh but the only way a prophet
[58:14] can be Vindicated is by the word I like
[58:17] that a only way a prophet can be
[58:20] Vindicated is by the word that mean we
[58:23] got to be able to see his ministry in
[58:26] the scripture Revelation 10 we see his
[58:29] ministry in the scripture Revelation
[58:32] 3:14 we see his ministry in the
[58:35] scripture praise God Amen St Luke 17
[58:38] we'll read it a little bit later we're
[58:39] going to see his ministry in the
[58:41] scripture my God Malachi 4 we see his
[58:44] ministry in the scripture all over the
[58:46] scripture not just one but all over the
[58:49] scripture we see this
[58:51] ministry that's why we follow it because
[58:54] it's according to the script
[58:58] and the ministry is not to lead us to
[59:00] him the ministry is to draw us closer to
[59:02] Christ yes sir can I can I can I can I
[59:06] can I just be honest with you you won't
[59:08] even know Christ if you don't know the
[59:12] word you won't know Christ if you don't
[59:16] know the
[59:17] word now I'm explaining that that that
[59:20] statement when Jesus rose again he was
[59:23] on the road to emus uhhuh yeah with a
[59:26] few Brothers they were so downcast in
[59:29] their Spirit right they had they they
[59:32] and they like man we thought he was the
[59:34] one we thought this we thought that he
[59:36] would he would take us from this Roman
[59:38] amen per uh persecution he would do all
[59:40] these things but had no idea who he
[59:42] walked with him slept with him ate with
[59:45] him talk with him had no idea who he
[59:49] was oh my but on the road to
[59:53] emus as they downcasting Spirit he begin
[59:56] to amen just break the word of God to
[59:59] them Hallelujah it begin to explain this
[1:00:01] scripture and explain that scripture did
[1:00:03] the prophet did not the prophets in the
[1:00:05] Old Testament say this and did not this
[1:00:07] one say that and didn't David say this
[1:00:09] and then Isaiah say this didn't this one
[1:00:11] say that I mean he was just breaking it
[1:00:13] all down and when they finally I mean
[1:00:15] the Bible actually tell you in Luke 24
[1:00:17] you can go back and read it but but B
[1:00:19] say when when it finally when it finally
[1:00:22] clicked it said did not our hearts burn
[1:00:27] Hallelujah as he spake to us the
[1:00:30] scriptures oh my God if the scripture
[1:00:34] don't make you
[1:00:35] shout ain't nothing going to make you
[1:00:39] shout but when the scripture has been
[1:00:41] revealed and amen being made known and
[1:00:45] and you begin to understand that the
[1:00:47] scripture is
[1:00:50] Quicken it's a whole different story
[1:00:54] then you got to know him according to
[1:00:56] the word and even in that story in Luke
[1:00:59] 24 Their Eyes Were
[1:01:01] blinded they couldn't know they didn't
[1:01:03] even know that Jesus was walking with
[1:01:05] them Jesus with all the scripture that
[1:01:09] was being taught they still was
[1:01:11] blinded so they they but they knew
[1:01:13] something about this man breaking the
[1:01:15] word down they done been to church for
[1:01:17] years ain't nobody broke the word down
[1:01:19] like this but when they say say look
[1:01:22] don't the night the day is far spent
[1:01:24] don't go any further come come come they
[1:01:26] they saw Jesus giv to to walk on he said
[1:01:29] he said no no no no don't don't go any
[1:01:31] further just just come with us come on
[1:01:32] the inside he was waiting on that
[1:01:34] invitation and when he got to the inside
[1:01:37] of the room with him amen they they
[1:01:39] pulled out some bread to eat and and
[1:01:41] Jesus Took the bread and when he broke
[1:01:44] the bread and the way that he broke the
[1:01:48] bread them brothers
[1:01:51] knew can't nobody break bread like this
[1:01:56] and don't don't get me wrong we're not
[1:01:58] talking about breaking physical
[1:02:01] breads we're talking about breaking
[1:02:03] spiritual breads when the bread is being
[1:02:07] broken and Revelation is coming we're
[1:02:09] we're getting stimulation of Revelation
[1:02:12] the fats are overflowing with wine and
[1:02:16] oil Hallelujah when that's happening the
[1:02:19] amen the the bread is being broken again
[1:02:22] for the people for them to recognize
[1:02:25] Christ in their
[1:02:27] day Christ according to
[1:02:30] scripture sir amen hallelujah let me
[1:02:34] keep reading my God my God my God my God
[1:02:38] I know where I'm standing I'm standing
[1:02:39] on the word and and heavens and earth
[1:02:41] will pass away but this word won't won't
[1:02:44] fail it won't fail this word won't
[1:02:47] fail remember the third pull opening of
[1:02:50] them Seven Seals to reveal the hidden
[1:02:51] truth that's been sealed in the word do
[1:02:53] you see it says it is in that day when
[1:02:55] this thing take place that Janice and
[1:02:57] jam the impersonators it is then and
[1:03:00] that day when this this is take place
[1:03:02] I'm sorry will appear again just like
[1:03:04] they did when Moses appeared with the
[1:03:06] original word to say to say it they they
[1:03:10] appear to impersonate just exactly right
[1:03:12] now you see Matthew
[1:03:13] 24:24 see anointed ones and and there's
[1:03:17] there's the there's the other thing I
[1:03:18] want you to get it now they are anointed
[1:03:20] with the genuine Holy Ghost to do what
[1:03:23] they doing and God will put them before
[1:03:25] you like that to see which decision
[1:03:27] you're going to
[1:03:29] make and and let me tell you because
[1:03:31] what God God wants you to do is base
[1:03:33] your decisions upon his word don't base
[1:03:37] your decision on no feeling don't base
[1:03:39] it on no emotion and I don't care what
[1:03:42] church you go to and they prophesy over
[1:03:44] you and they prophecy is absolutely
[1:03:46] right that don't mean you become a part
[1:03:48] of that
[1:03:50] church
[1:03:52] Hallelujah you better watch what you get
[1:03:54] yourself involved with cuz the rain is
[1:03:56] fall on the just and the unjust and for
[1:03:59] me when I if I can see the the unjust
[1:04:01] using the gifts of God like that what
[1:04:03] about the just all right all right all
[1:04:06] right
[1:04:08] Hallelujah that's why I believe in the
[1:04:10] restoration because those gifts are
[1:04:12] supposed to be amongst the
[1:04:15] just amen amen you shouldn't have to go
[1:04:18] to no denominational church and they
[1:04:19] tell you I see the Lord calling you to
[1:04:21] this career mhm you should be able to
[1:04:24] get that right here amen
[1:04:26] you should be at somebody with a gift of
[1:04:28] wisdom somebody with a gift of knowledge
[1:04:31] somebody living close to God that ought
[1:04:33] to be able to give you that oh my
[1:04:39] God part of our part of our lacking of
[1:04:41] this is because of how we get so wrapped
[1:04:43] up in the things of the
[1:04:46] world Amen I might as well be honest
[1:04:50] church it's because we get so wrapped up
[1:04:53] in the things of the world I'm tell
[1:04:55] y'all something I might as well say
[1:04:57] these things while I'm here now I'm a I
[1:05:00] I I played football I played uh
[1:05:04] basketball uh when I was a young man now
[1:05:06] I play golf cuz I can't do all that no
[1:05:08] more but I I've always been a a guy that
[1:05:11] was in sports and I love sports I love
[1:05:13] sports but I I found it you know
[1:05:16] sometimes even you know uh it's playoffs
[1:05:18] time and you get really you know I want
[1:05:20] to see who winning I want to see who
[1:05:21] doing this I want to see that but I come

[1:05:25] want me to pay to watch sports and I
[1:05:29] told the devil I
[1:05:31] refuse to actually pay to have to watch
[1:05:35] sports now now that's something when the
[1:05:37] devil got you paying for
[1:05:39] it it used to be
[1:05:42] free but now the devil got people paying

[1:07:04] our midst but those gifts need to
[1:07:06] surrender themselves to God to be used

[1:08:24] where the whole inspiration
[1:08:26] of our restore sayth the Lord that goes
[1:08:29] with the theme of get back in Step uh
[1:08:32] these two were connected throughout last
[1:08:34] year and they're moving forward this
[1:08:36] year amen with a another layer amen of
[1:08:41] inspiration and that's amen the year of
[1:08:44] overflow all right so we're we're just
[1:08:46] we're just taking all of this and just
[1:08:47] absorbing what God has for us so amen
[1:08:50] here in the message the restoration of
[1:08:52] Bri tree brother Brandon makes this
[1:08:53] statement says amen restore restore all
[1:08:57] the
[1:08:58] signs restore all the signs remember

[1:09:04] many signs and we going we going we're
[1:09:05] going to get them today signs that show
[1:09:08] that we are in the end time however
[1:09:11] there is a chief sign that you want to
[1:09:14] make sure you keep your eyes on and a
[1:09:17] chief sign is when God sends to the
[1:09:19] earth a prophet that's a chief sign all
[1:09:23] right amen it says amen restore all all
[1:09:25] the signs the sign of lot at the end
[1:09:30] time here's another one we've went

[1:15:01] knocking trying to get back in amen
[1:15:05] where did they reject Jesus Oh My they
[1:15:08] rejected his
[1:15:09] word that's where they're rejecting
[1:15:11] Jesus yes sir all right all right and
[1:15:14] and and now don't get me wrong we know
[1:15:16] that they picking up the Bible and they
[1:15:18] preaching amen the miracles of Jesus we
[1:15:21] know that but that's not all the word
[1:15:24] just because you preaching the miracles
[1:15:25] of Jesus can you also preach the
[1:15:28] Prophecies of
[1:15:30] Jesus
[1:15:33] okay can you preach it because if you
[1:15:36] can't preach that if you can't see the
[1:15:37] Prophecies of Jesus then you're not
[1:15:39] preaching all of
[1:15:40] Jesus Oh My My My the only way you're
[1:15:44] going to get all Jesus is somebody can
[1:15:46] see the whole picture from Genesis and
[1:15:49] Revelation amen amen all right all right
[1:15:52] all right hallelujah hallelujah
[1:15:54] hallelujah all right so this says there
[1:15:57] there they are one one together one in
[1:15:58] us the same sign human beings can't do
[1:16:00] it can do is manifesting themselves
[1:16:03] comes out the word to bring forth the
[1:16:04] predestinated word of God out of the
[1:16:06] roots of the tree back Yonder that all
[1:16:08] the denominations that refused and
[1:16:09] refuse and refuse but there will come a
[1:16:12] light forth there will come a light will
[1:16:15] rise whereabouts over in Jerusalem no
[1:16:18] sir evening lights will not rise in
[1:16:20] Jerusalem the evening lights goes where
[1:16:23] in the West yes sir right here where we
[1:16:26] standing at amen they had their day and
[1:16:30] refused it but the evening light shall
[1:16:32] rise in the west what for to shine upon
[1:16:36] the word what to ripen the fruit bring
[1:16:41] forth the bride tree with the same signs
[1:16:45] this is this is important the bride tree
[1:16:46] coming forth with the same signs the
[1:16:49] Wonders and the fruits that they had at
[1:16:52] the beginning that's right amen all I'm
[1:16:55] we're not taking anything less than that
[1:16:57] it says it shall be light in the evening
[1:17:00] time right oh the word will then bring
[1:17:04] forth its fruit in its season yes sir
[1:17:09] watch this it shall not wither but it'll
[1:17:12] bring forth its fruit David said in its
[1:17:14] Seasons amen same fruit it had at the
[1:17:19] beginning I'm going on a little further
[1:17:21] it says now with his words and his
[1:17:25] predestinated stage as he's got it now
[1:17:29] and we see these words all being
[1:17:31] manifested what is it it's a perfect
[1:17:33] Vindication that the coming of the Lord
[1:17:36] is at hand watch it now and the time uh
[1:17:40] when he said I'll restore say the Lord
[1:17:42] and all that them canker worms all that
[1:17:45] the Methodist left all that the
[1:17:47] caterpillars eaten all that is that this
[1:17:49] done after they uh stripped it down but
[1:17:52] I will restore in the evening time oh my
[1:17:57] woo all
[1:18:01] right all right it goes into a song
[1:18:04] there and I'll just uh skip the
[1:18:08] song talking about oh how I love Jesus
[1:18:12] and and we got to love him we got to
[1:18:13] love him according to his
[1:18:15] word and so when he when he when he when
[1:18:17] he when he gets here tell us that it's
[1:18:19] the same
[1:18:20] signs the same signs he's restoring the
[1:18:23] same signs as a days of lot now let's
[1:18:26] slip over to the scripture St Luke
[1:18:31] 17
[1:18:33] Hallelujah these are things that go that
[1:18:36] Jesus Promised and if we we can't preach
[1:18:39] this part of the Bible we not preaching
[1:18:40] all the Bible then we got to take the
[1:18:43] whole
[1:18:44] book amen amen St Luke
[1:18:48] 17 all right watch uh this I wanted to
[1:18:53] uh
[1:18:55] pick up a little early I was going to
[1:18:56] start at 26 but I'll start at
[1:19:00] 22 now this is
[1:19:03] important because we begin to see
[1:19:06] Prophecies of Jesus right here in our
[1:19:09] midst every day it says and he said unto
[1:19:13] his unto the
[1:19:14] disciples the days will
[1:19:17] come when ye shall
[1:19:20] desire to see one of the days of the son
[1:19:24] of of man and remember I I I started off
[1:19:27] by reading a quote where brother brandom
[1:19:29] say can't you get it separated now the
[1:19:32] messenger is not the son of man but the
[1:19:36] messenger is
[1:19:38] revealing the son of man the messenger
[1:19:41] is a son of man and his job is to reveal
[1:19:47] the son of man so a son of man as a
[1:19:52] prophet reveals the prophet of prophet
[1:19:54] Prophets The King of Kings the Lord of
[1:19:58] lords Jesus
[1:20:00] Christ John the Baptist was a son of man
[1:20:06] revealing the son of man at the first
[1:20:09] coming of Jesus if he used the prophet
[1:20:12] to introduce him at the first coming his
[1:20:16] pattern is simply the same because he
[1:20:19] does not change according to Hebrews 13
[1:20:23] and8 he's the same yesterday the day and
[1:20:25] forever if he used the prophet at the
[1:20:27] first coming he will use a
[1:20:31] prophet amen at the second coming and
[1:20:33] that Prophet is a son of man
[1:20:37] revealing
[1:20:38] the son of
[1:20:41] man
[1:20:43] language is
[1:20:45] important here when we look in scripture
[1:20:48] verse 22 and he said unto the disciples
[1:20:51] the days will come when you shall desire
[1:20:54] to see one of the days of of
[1:20:56] the son of man and ye shall not see
[1:21:01] it right then he goes on says and they
[1:21:04] shall say to you see here or see there
[1:21:08] go not after them nor follow them for as
[1:21:11] the lightning that lith out of the out
[1:21:15] of the one part under Heaven shineth
[1:21:17] unto other part under heaven so shall
[1:21:20] also the son of man be in his day but
[1:21:24] first
[1:21:25] must he suffer many things and watch
[1:21:29] this now one of the things he going to
[1:21:30] be that he's going to he's going to
[1:21:32] endure one of the things that the son of
[1:21:33] man going to endure he's going to be
[1:21:38] rejected of this generation so I I I
[1:21:42] think I mentioned last week people don't
[1:21:43] even realize they fulfilling scripture
[1:21:46] when they're walking away from the word
[1:21:49] they reject the word they're rejecting
[1:21:52] Christ can I I'm going just I'm going
[1:21:54] let me just make it very simple these
[1:21:55] are simple statements to reject the word
[1:21:59] is to reject Christ to receive the word
[1:22:03] is to receive
[1:22:05] Christ all right all right he says but
[1:22:08] first he must suffer many things and be
[1:22:12] rejected of this generation and look at
[1:22:15] this and as it was in the days of when
[1:22:20] you when you look at it it seem like it
[1:22:22] going to say noi but no it's Noah
[1:22:25] as it was in the days of Noah so shall
[1:22:28] it be also in the days of the son of man
[1:22:33] now you got to understand what happened
[1:22:34] in the days of Noah right if it's going
[1:22:36] to be the same at the coming of the son
[1:22:38] of man thee not a thee son of man when
[1:22:42] when he comes these are certain signs
[1:22:44] that we need to look for one of the
[1:22:46] signs is the days of
[1:22:48] Noah now now they actually tell us Amen
[1:22:51] in verse verse 27 what kind of happened
[1:22:54] there they did eat yes they
[1:22:58] drank they married
[1:23:00] wives my God they were given in marriage
[1:23:05] until the day that Noah entered into the
[1:23:07] ark and the flood came and destroyed
[1:23:09] them all let's break these things down
[1:23:11] so we just don't go right over the top
[1:23:13] of them what were some of the signs
[1:23:16] listen now amen and when when when when
[1:23:19] when we're talking about the coming of
[1:23:20] the lord it's it's like it's like uh me
[1:23:22] getting on the road and and getting
[1:23:24] ready to drive to Orlando it's about a 2
[1:23:25] and 1/2 three hour drive from here amen
[1:23:28] now if I if I if I'm if I'm going in the
[1:23:30] right direction glory to God I should
[1:23:34] see signs on the road telling me I'm
[1:23:38] moving in the right direction when I
[1:23:40] first get out down the highway it might
[1:23:42] say uh uh uh Orlando uh 180 miles or
[1:23:46] something like that whatever it is 180
[1:23:48] miles now if I'm moving in the right
[1:23:50] direction if I get up the road a little
[1:23:52] bit further I should see Orlando 150 Mi
[1:23:56] then I should see Orlando 120 Mi that
[1:23:59] let me know I'm moving in the right
[1:24:01] direction if I get out there and say
[1:24:03] Orlando 180 miles and I start going in
[1:24:06] One Direction then I say Orlando 220
[1:24:09] miles Orlando 250 miles I am moving in
[1:24:13] the wrong direction the other thing is
[1:24:16] if I'm moving in the wrong direction I
[1:24:18] won't even see no size porting to
[1:24:21] Orlando right
[1:24:24] I see signs going to Miami somewhere
[1:24:26] else but I won't see signs Orlando that
[1:24:29] should be something that make me stop
[1:24:31] and think am I moving in the right
[1:24:37] direction so we if we getting closer to
[1:24:39] the coming of the Lord there are certain
[1:24:41] things we're supposed to see now you
[1:24:44] can't stop this from happening in the
[1:24:46] earth it was
[1:24:48] prophesied amen amen only thing you can
[1:24:51] stop is that you w't be a part of it
[1:24:54] right
[1:24:55] right amen I see it but I ain't going to
[1:24:58] be one of
[1:25:00] them watch this now here go some signs
[1:25:03] here goes some signs to look at first
[1:25:06] one is they did eat they drank very very
[1:25:09] normal things to do to eat and drink
[1:25:12] problem is is when they do it the way we
[1:25:14] do it especially here in the US Buffet
[1:25:18] is everywhere
[1:25:19] yeah they eat they eat too much y'all
[1:25:22] saw the video with the man say he said
[1:25:24] you you got to leave you eat too
[1:25:26] much and and and and here here here here
[1:25:29] here here in our I mean you go other
[1:25:31] plac they don't have it like this but
[1:25:32] but uh but but man McDonald's Burger
[1:25:36] King when you go they give you the big
[1:25:38] gulp size extra large and everybody
[1:25:40] always want to up it up take me to a
[1:25:43] large you want the the biggest of the
[1:25:45] big and actually do more damage to your
[1:25:48] body is the truth any any
[1:25:51] anyhow glory to God man not just no one
[1:25:55] Burger give me that
[1:26:01] double right this is where the problem
[1:26:03] is right so so so so watch it say say us
[1:26:06] they did eat they drank they married
[1:26:08] wives wives why why it say married Wise
[1:26:11] It's because there would be a problem
[1:26:13] with divorce and remarriage divorce and
[1:26:16] remarriage all you got to go go to go to
[1:26:19] uh uh uh uh what's
[1:26:22] Nevada Las Vegas just pull just drive in
[1:26:25] drive through marriage and drive-
[1:26:27] through
[1:26:29] divorce I mean people don't have no no
[1:26:33] no no no commitment to their marriages
[1:26:37] anymore it's just a this is what you see
[1:26:40] it's a that's why you see a lot of
[1:26:41] marital problems hitting the church
[1:26:44] right but this is a spirit that comes
[1:26:45] into the land don't think the devil
[1:26:47] won't attack your marriage there's a
[1:26:50] spirit that comes into the land to do
[1:26:52] this in this time you got to resist that
[1:26:56] devil I made a vow I made a commitment
[1:27:00] and I'm stuck to You Like
[1:27:04] Glue hello
[1:27:07] somebody this is what the this is what
[1:27:09] they mean by Mar wives lot of marriage
[1:27:12] and divorce issues other thing is they
[1:27:15] were given in marriage what does that
[1:27:17] mean that mean they living with each
[1:27:19] other without being married to each
[1:27:21] other now you know that's happening all
[1:27:24] around you and and this why I say you
[1:27:26] got you got loved ones that you know
[1:27:28] they living in
[1:27:30] sin I I might as well just be honest and
[1:27:33] tell you they are living in sin and you
[1:27:36] can't come to my house like
[1:27:38] that amen are y'all married you can't
[1:27:42] stay here this is not a hotel God bless
[1:27:45] me with this
[1:27:47] house and y'all ain't living here like
[1:27:50] that amen hello somebody amen amen this
[1:27:54] is this is what the scripture is telling
[1:27:56] us when when it says that they they were
[1:27:58] given in marriage they acting like they
[1:28:00] married but they're
[1:28:01] not all right let's go in a little
[1:28:04] further until the day that Noah entered
[1:28:07] into the ark now it used to be time
[1:28:08] people feel so convicted by that they
[1:28:10] don't even feel conviction anymore no
[1:28:14] conviction watch it says uh until the
[1:28:17] day that Noah enter the ark and the
[1:28:18] flood came and destroyed them all people
[1:28:20] just going to keep going in sin and the
[1:28:22] FL they're going to be destroyed not
[1:28:24] just a flood of water it's going to be a
[1:28:26] flood of
[1:28:28] fire let me go on now look at what
[1:28:31] happens because there's another thing
[1:28:32] that happens in the days of lot where he

[1:35:08] another problem that comes into this day
[1:35:10] and it's a spirit that we all see it
[1:35:12] look at and Jesus prophesied these
[1:35:14] things would be here now now let me let
[1:35:16] me just tell you not only are they here

[1:36:27] have to say it he went around preaching
[1:36:29] just running around preaching preaching
[1:36:31] preaching finally end up right back at
[1:36:33] the sister I know the Lord telling me
[1:36:35] that you got something to
[1:36:36] say she said yeah I do I rebuke that
[1:36:40] homosexual Spirit that's in you right
[1:36:45] [Music]
[1:36:47] now he got
[1:36:49] blasted in front of
[1:36:52] everybody m
[1:36:54] that's right well that's the days of lot
[1:36:59] let's read
[1:37:03] it oh I'm now y'all know this ain't
[1:37:05] nothing but the truth even y'all at home
[1:37:07] got to sayen y'all ordaining homosexuals
[1:37:11] to
[1:37:13] preach their Spirit was never for it but
[1:37:16] yet they s because they're part of an
[1:37:19] organization that's why I rather be not
[1:37:21] connected to organization I want to be
[1:37:22] connected to the world word of
[1:37:24] God but but but but you you not do a
[1:37:27] homosexual to preach the gospel what can
[1:37:30] they preach Lord they they ain't even
[1:37:34] been
[1:37:35] delivered ain't nothing they can
[1:37:40] say look at this ver verse
[1:37:44] 28 likewise also as it was in the days
[1:37:47] of
[1:37:48] lot they did eat they drink
[1:37:54] they they bought they sold they planted
[1:37:56] they build it when you see all the
[1:37:58] building happening that's why anybody
[1:38:00] tied to real estate you're going to do
[1:38:02] well because it's a prophecy of Jesus
[1:38:06] right so so so so this these are things
[1:38:08] that supposed to happen when you see the
[1:38:10] economy just just blossoming like that
[1:38:12] all building and buying land and selling
[1:38:14] land I mean just you it's just
[1:38:16] unbelievable and not of prices of land
[1:38:18] is especially here in Palm Beach County
[1:38:24] how house prices is just going out
[1:38:26] through the roof and and I I went I went
[1:38:29] somewhere the other day I don't know oh
[1:38:31] I think I went to get my my car wash and
[1:38:34] um just because I have a truck they want
[1:38:36] to charge me a little extra for the
[1:38:37] truck I look I looked I say you know
[1:38:40] everything going up but my
[1:38:46] paycheck people Charing for everything
[1:38:48] now house prices out the roof you can't
[1:38:51] find just that cheap house that you used
[1:38:53] to look for it's not there anymore in
[1:38:54] the market and even in a down Market the
[1:38:57] prices are still up this is prophecy but
[1:39:01] I I tell I I will tell you this God will
[1:39:03] provide for
[1:39:05] [Music]
[1:39:06] you don't matter what the market look
[1:39:09] like God going to provide for you if he
[1:39:12] got to send you money from some
[1:39:15] somewhere he'll do it I'm telling
[1:39:18] you I know a God that can give $300,000
[1:39:21] cash
[1:39:24] Amen brother look in to buy a house and
[1:39:26] the man gave him
[1:39:27] $300,000 cash didn't even know he had it
[1:39:31] thought it was a bag of
[1:39:34] candy I can't tell the testimony but I
[1:39:37] but I know that
[1:39:39] God here he says this um uh they sold
[1:39:43] they planted they built it but the same
[1:39:45] day that lot went out of Sodom it rain
[1:39:47] fire and brimstone from heaven and
[1:39:50] destroyed them all now now now the the
[1:39:53] thing about this it you know when it
[1:39:54] just say the days of lot you got to be
[1:39:56] the one to go back and read in Genesis
[1:39:59] 19 what happened in lot's day why why
[1:40:02] when why did fire and brimstone come
[1:40:04] down because of a lifestyle when the
[1:40:07] when the ladies get cheap now I I I say
[1:40:09] not sisters actually don't don't let
[1:40:12] don't even call it ladies women women
[1:40:16] but when women uh just get cheap and and
[1:40:20] and and any man can come by and do
[1:40:22] whatever he want when whenever he want
[1:40:24] come on right when you get cheap like
[1:40:27] that it causes men to stop pursuing
[1:40:29] women
[1:40:31] right and it caused women Amen to start
[1:40:35] being pursu it's caused men to start
[1:40:36] pursuing men because they that that's a
[1:40:38] harder thing to
[1:40:39] get right I'm telling the truth and then
[1:40:43] it caused women because they've been
[1:40:45] hurt in so many
[1:40:46] relationships they don't trust men no
[1:40:49] more because they've been hurt now they
[1:40:51] get connected with a woman that hurt was
[1:40:54] a
[1:40:56] spirit that was anointing you causing
[1:40:59] you to fulfill the days of
[1:41:03] lot Hallelujah ain't nothing but the
[1:41:06] truth but but but but Jesus say these
[1:41:08] things will be there when you recognize
[1:41:10] it when you see it you start running for
[1:41:12] your life I ain't going to be a part of
[1:41:14] this amen

[1:44:22] amen amen amen right but here but but
[1:44:26] here we we see all this and it's very
[1:44:29] obvious to me with the homosexuality
[1:44:32] rise the marriage and divorce problem
[1:44:34] and notice all this hit at the same time
[1:44:37] that's what Jesus said in this scripture
[1:44:39] all this here at the same time but the
[1:44:40] other thing that happened and I and I'm
[1:44:42] trying to make my my turn out done lost
[1:44:44] track of time but just I I want to read
[1:44:46] just one other thing for you but when
[1:44:49] this happens the same thing happening
[1:44:52] when all is sin is mounting up there is
[1:44:56] a
[1:44:57] visitor that is visiting Abraham now
[1:45:02] here here's a question let me just put
[1:45:03] it down like now there there there there
[1:45:05] there's three
[1:45:07] groups in this day of the days of lot
[1:45:11] and the son of man come during a time
[1:45:13] like that it's a promise that these are
[1:45:15] going to be signs during that time these
[1:45:17] are things we can look at we know Jesus
[1:45:18] is coming soon this is why we have an
[1:45:21] end time message because these are end
[1:45:23] time
[1:45:25] signs the days of lot the days of Noah
[1:45:29] and another thing in days of Noah it was
[1:45:31] violence all over the land yes sir we
[1:45:34] see that today too sir every time you
[1:45:36] turn on you pick up a newspaper somebody
[1:45:38] and Di police
[1:45:41] brutality and and and don't we need the
[1:45:44] police I'm not trying to defund the
[1:45:45] police but some sometime the police make
[1:45:48] some mistakes we got we got we got stuff
[1:45:51] going on it's just it's it's UNC
[1:45:53] controllable sin just on every hand so
[1:45:56] much violence but that happened in the
[1:45:58] days of
[1:46:00] Noah but we got these three groups we
[1:46:03] got we got
[1:46:04] lot we got the
[1:46:07] sodomites and we got Abraham all right
[1:46:11] now lot was in Sodom with the
[1:46:15] sodomites Abraham was in the
[1:46:18] outside not only just on the outside but
[1:46:21] praying for his nephew lot that was on
[1:46:23] the
[1:46:25] inside the question is which group do
[1:46:30] you want to be a part
[1:46:33] of cuz I can tell you what happened amen
[1:46:36] with the sodomites they result they died
[1:46:40] fire and brimstone lot got pulled out
[1:46:43] let's keep reading I I forgot to read
[1:46:45] this part let's keep
[1:46:48] reading verse verse verse 29 verse 30
[1:46:52] even thus shall it be in the
[1:46:54] day when the son of
[1:46:57] man is revealed now now see the son of
[1:47:00] man got to be revealed how is the son of
[1:47:03] man revealed by a son of man who reveals
[1:47:08] the son of man so a prophet has to
[1:47:11] reveal
[1:47:14] [Applause]
[1:47:16] Christ amen amen let's keep going in
[1:47:20] that day he which shall be upon the
[1:47:22] Housetop and his stuff in the house let
[1:47:25] him not come down and take it away and
[1:47:27] he that is in the field let him likewise
[1:47:29] not return back
[1:47:33] remember Lot's
[1:47:36] wife Jesus telling us to remember these
[1:47:39] things
[1:47:40] because Abraham is not here Abraham is
[1:47:42] praying for lot to come out never
[1:47:45] specifically call lot by name but he say
[1:47:48] Lord if there just be 50 righteous would
[1:47:50] you would you spare what if it's lacking
[1:47:52] five
[1:47:53] what if it's 30 25 20 okay one more
[1:48:00] prayer what if it's just 10 righteous
[1:48:02] would you destroy the city for 10
[1:48:04] righteous if I find 10 righteous I won't
[1:48:07] destroy now Abraham never asked for lot
[1:48:09] specifically but he knew what was in
[1:48:12] Abraham's heart and he went right to
[1:48:14] lot's house and he got lot out invited
[1:48:17] lot invited lot's children now lot had
[1:48:20] two daughters that came but lot had Sons
[1:48:22] down there too that didn't come out lot
[1:48:26] had grandchildren that didn't come out
[1:48:28] because brother Brandon say the reason
[1:48:30] that Lot's wife got got there she could
[1:48:32] hear her
[1:48:35] grandchildren a prophet tell you
[1:48:38] that she could hear her grandchildren
[1:48:40] and was so attached to them
[1:48:43] grandchildren that she turned in her
[1:48:46] heart she wanted to go back you when
[1:48:48] when God called you out of sin in your
[1:48:51] heart you can't want to go back
[1:48:53] [Applause]
[1:48:53] [Music]
[1:48:54] when you come to this you got to be
[1:48:57] satisfied you got to see this that's
[1:48:59] better than anything that God that that
[1:49:02] God could allowed you to get in this
[1:49:04] life being a Christian is the best life
[1:49:06] that one can
[1:49:09] live
[1:49:12] amen here see you got to understand
[1:49:15] Spirits just open up so many other
[1:49:17] Spirits you you you you you you you get
[1:49:20] started with drinking drinking now will
[1:49:22] connect you with with smoking smoking
[1:49:23] would connect you with sexual sins and I
[1:49:25] mean it just just keeps going on and on
[1:49:28] and you find yourself like
[1:49:30] Legion I got 2,000 demons in me don't
[1:49:33] even know how they got here and legion's
[1:49:36] Demon was connected to a lie brother
[1:49:39] Brandon said that the young fellow uh
[1:49:42] maybe maybe went out and smoked
[1:49:44] something and then after he smoked he
[1:49:46] come back and he put something on his
[1:49:47] breath so people can smell they smok and
[1:49:49] then he tell um uh maybe his mom or his
[1:49:52] wife You' been out smoking no he say
[1:49:55] soon you say no a demon step
[1:49:59] in something else come up and you and
[1:50:01] you lie about that another demon step in
[1:50:06] right amen and every time you tell a lie
[1:50:08] and then you get to a spot you don't you
[1:50:09] don't you don't you don't even know when
[1:50:10] you're
[1:50:12] lying and not don't that you start
[1:50:14] believing your own
[1:50:16] lies and every time you do it another
[1:50:18] demon stepping in another demon stepping
[1:50:21] another demon stepping in
[1:50:23] and you 2,000
[1:50:26] demons don't even know how he got there
[1:50:29] but you know what this this is the
[1:50:30] beautiful part about a man with 2,000
[1:50:33] demons could be
[1:50:36] delivered by Jesus Christ Hall by coming
[1:50:40] in contact with Jesus Christ 2,000
[1:50:44] demons can't even hold them amen and
[1:50:48] then 2,000 demons start praying yes sir
[1:50:51] amen yeah
[1:50:55] demons say please don't send us to the
[1:50:58] abyss but would you allow us to go into
[1:51:01] these
[1:51:03] pigs and G Jesus say yes I give you
[1:51:07] permission to go into the swine so I'm
[1:51:09] here to tell you like brother Jean told
[1:51:12] you if
[1:51:13] demons can get their prayer
[1:51:17] answer what about the children of God
[1:51:21] [Applause]
[1:51:23] hey your prayer soon as you thought it

[1:51:46] Lord in that day we have all these
[1:51:49] Spirits that's being released and Jesus
[1:51:51] tells us this but but in the same time
[1:51:54] all this sin going on down in Sodom
[1:51:56] Gomorrah they got their two angels that
[1:51:59] come down brother brandom told us that
[1:52:00] two angels represented in this day the
[1:52:02] ministry of or Roberts and the ministry
[1:52:05] of Billy Graham went down into into the
[1:52:09] Moder day uh Sodom now back in them day
[1:52:12] you would have thought now now uh
[1:52:14] brother brand why would you say that
[1:52:15] because these brothers were preaching
[1:52:16] the
[1:52:17] gospel go into your average Pentecostal
[1:52:19] church today Andress your average
[1:52:22] denomination Church see how many gays
[1:52:25] are being welcomed in the church and you
[1:52:27] tell them if that's not Sodom and
[1:52:28] gomorra in the
[1:52:30] church well we can't put them out we got
[1:52:32] to love everybody I I'm not saying that
[1:52:35] but deal what they saying right this
[1:52:37] this this type of sermon that I'm
[1:52:38] preaching will never be preached in a
[1:52:40] church like that they avoid these topics
[1:52:44] and y'all know I'm telling the truth
[1:52:46] they avoid talking about this because
[1:52:47] they don't want to lose nobody I don't
[1:52:49] want to lose nobody either but I do want
[1:52:51] to lose that sin
[1:52:53] amen

[1:53:34] to tell you cuz there's something I want
[1:53:35] to read here for you but what I am
[1:53:37] trying to tell you is that while all
[1:53:39] that's going on in Sodom God was dealing
[1:53:41] with Abraham and there was there was a a
[1:53:44] visitor actually three visitors when
[1:53:47] they came to Abraham Abraham said my
[1:53:49] Lord when two visitors came to lot he
[1:53:51] said my my lords he had the wrong
[1:53:54] Revelation Abraham said my Lord and when
[1:53:57] when Abraham sees them they're sitting
[1:53:59] there they're having a conversation and
[1:54:02] um and it's the lord it's it's the Lord
[1:54:04] himself in a body of Flesh and he has
[1:54:06] his back to the tent and he says why is
[1:54:09] Sarah Laughing Now first there's a
[1:54:11] couple things that we need to understand
[1:54:12] how did he know Sarah's name right right
[1:54:17] cuz her name was
[1:54:19] Sarai but now it's Sarah and he
[1:54:21] pronounces it Sarah Abram was Abram but
[1:54:25] now he's Abraham right how did he know
[1:54:28] the name had changed only God can know
[1:54:31] that because God is the one that gave
[1:54:33] him the name
[1:54:35] change why where is Sarah wife she in
[1:54:37] the tent behind you why is she laughing
[1:54:40] how did he know she was
[1:54:42] laughing it was a discernment it was a
[1:54:45] discernment right and and and and and so
[1:54:47] that spirit of discernment that happened
[1:54:50] in the days of Abraham will be the
