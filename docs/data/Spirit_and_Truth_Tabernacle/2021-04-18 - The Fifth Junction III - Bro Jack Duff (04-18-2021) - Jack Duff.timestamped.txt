[28:55] uh uh just at the time uh
[28:58] to just kind of put it all together
[29:02] um many of you know the lord has blessed
[29:06] us
[29:07] with a new home and uh
[29:14] but i just want to i just want to
[29:16] testify i read the scripture this
[29:18] morning deuteronomy 28 without
[29:19] hearkening to the
[29:20] voice of the lord and do uh
[29:23] his will that you'll be blessed
[29:27] your storehouse will be blessed
[29:30] probably about well over 10 years ago
[29:35] some time my wife and i um
[29:42] walked away now y'all forgive me if i
[29:46] get choked up
[29:47] i'ma cry baby anyway
[29:51] you know the morales call me the crying
[29:53] deacon
[29:55] so uh but uh you know and
[29:58] and uh see let me tell you something
[30:00] when you walk away
[30:01] from the lord you know uh you
[30:05] you he gonna take care of you but you
[30:08] walk out of the you you walk out when
[30:10] you walk out of your blessings
[30:13] you see you think you're going alone see
[30:16] the rich young ruler
[30:17] you know he got his opportunity he
[30:19] thought everything was fine
[30:22] but it really wasn't and see what what
[30:24] it's a
[30:25] slow it's a slow decline and what began
[30:29] to happen we began
[30:31] you know the devil just came in and just
[30:33] started tearing down
[30:35] what what what the lord had built see
[30:37] when you begin to get to a point where
[30:39] you think
[30:39] it's you you know uh you're making a big
[30:43] mistake and everything that we had
[30:46] accomplished as a family and and
[30:49] and and and things we realize it was the
[30:52] blessings
[30:53] of the lord
[30:56] but the bible says i will restore
[31:01] see one of the things with but my wife
[31:04] and i even know we
[31:05] we we we never lost faith
[31:09] you know many times we would talk and
[31:12] and i spoke it a lot of times i said
[31:13] sometimes you'll get out there so far
[31:15] you don't know how to get back
[31:18] because see the devil you know he got
[31:20] you out there on that limb and
[31:22] and and he fighting now you got to fight
[31:25] over all kind of things to get back
[31:26] and say but the lord will bring you back
[31:30] if you humble yourself
[31:33] and hearken unto the voices of god see
[31:37] and i'm just grateful you know
[31:41] i'm grateful for the house but i'm
[31:43] grateful from where he brought us from

[35:05] already written in
[35:07] history

[53:30] have done
[53:31] thus far in the service and just
[53:34] appreciate uh lord how you have just
[53:38] blessed the church and
[53:39] the church is able to keep moving on uh
[53:42] even when we have a majority of the
[53:44] saints uh
[53:45] out we pray god that you give traveling
[53:46] mercies to them as they all make their
[53:48] way back thank you for
[53:50] uh the the wedding that took place on
[53:52] yesterday um
[53:53] brother william and sister ailey i'll
[53:55] just thank you for what you've done
[53:56] there with that couple and
[53:58] actually your blessings would be upon
[54:00] them and uh god just thank you
[54:02] brother troy able to just kind of slip
[54:04] right in and keep things going and
[54:06] uh sister bernice able to slip right in
[54:08] keep things going and the saints just
[54:10] come on into the house of god expecting
[54:12] you to move and
[54:13] lord just appreciate all that you're
[54:15] doing in our midst god we know that you
[54:18] are at work thank you for the testimony
[54:21] we heard
[54:22] from brother troy and how you bless him
[54:24] and sister tanya and god how he
[54:27] uh clearly can see us we're grateful for
[54:30] the the material blessing
[54:31] but god the spiritual blessing is what
[54:34] released
[54:35] the material blessing so god i pray that
[54:38] people would catch
[54:39] what he was speaking and there are many
[54:41] that are tuned in and
[54:43] lord may be afraid to come to the house
[54:45] of god just maybe feeling the same thing
[54:47] that he was feeling but god as you
[54:50] allowed him to break
[54:51] free from that fear god i pray that
[54:54] others would also break free from the
[54:56] fear that
[54:57] the enemy has placed in their life and
[54:59] they're trying to find all kind of
[55:00] things to
[55:02] substitute a man church for and
[55:05] but god there's uh there's a a promise
[55:07] over them and they can never get away
[55:09] from that promise so
[55:10] i pray that you go after your children
[55:12] that you bring them forth lord from
[55:14] the east the west the north the south
[55:16] wherever they are god bring them forth
[55:18] and may the spirit of god
[55:20] uh continue to deal with their hearts
[55:22] lord don't let them get rest amen at
[55:24] night give them dreams that would
[55:26] shaken god at their core and we just
[55:28] trust lord jesus that you would get all
[55:30] the glory and all the
[55:31] honor from restoring your people so we
[55:34] believe this
[55:34] is the hour of restoration and father
[55:37] we're on the expectation for you to do
[55:39] uh you've already been doing great
[55:40] things but father we know you got more
[55:42] that you want to do it's in jesus name
[55:44] that we pray
[55:46] amen amen amen god bless you
[55:49] uh you can be seated in the presence of
[55:51] the lord
[55:53] we are continuing our journey a man with
[55:55] the
[55:56] uh the fifth junction uh uh here
[56:00] and um like i said and
[56:03] there's a number of things that that
[56:06] that that that can be shared
[56:08] the prophet told us that this was one of
[56:09] the main junctions
[56:11] and uh you know so i wanted to uh
[56:15] just kind of get into a few things here
[56:17] today if we can
[56:18] uh but i like i mentioned uh so that i
[56:21] don't forget this
[56:23] uh we're reading the scripture and um
[56:27] we read acts 2 and verse 17 says and it
[56:30] shall come to pass
[56:31] in the last days that that's this time
[56:34] in which we're living in right now
[56:36] and the last day says god i will
[56:40] pour out of my spirit praise god
[56:44] upon all flesh church i'm on the
[56:47] expectation for this
[56:49] amen all flesh who says that your sons
[56:51] and your daughters
[56:53] shall prophesy praise god this is what
[56:55] he says
[56:56] and then it says in your young men shall
[56:59] see visions
[57:00] praise god and then it says your old men
[57:03] shall dream dreams now i know for myself
[57:06] i
[57:06] uh i've passed 50 and i still try to
[57:08] consider myself a young man
[57:10] glory to god but the bible said your old
[57:13] man shall dream dreams
[57:14] and uh you know so i have to be able to
[57:16] accept that part of the word too
[57:18] and uh you know early this this week i
[57:21] was you know we went there to the pantry
[57:23] and i wasn't gonna say anything but it
[57:25] just i just felt impressed to

[57:58] i had a dream old men shall dream
[58:01] drinks see my dream happened on the 15th
[58:06] and his dream happened on the 12th and
[58:08] we both weren't going to say nothing
[58:11] right but when i said something he said
[58:13] i had a dream on the 12th
[58:15] that i walked up to you and i handed you
[58:17] keith said it was done
[58:19] pastor so in the mouth of two or three
[58:22] witnesses
[58:24] let every word be established hallelujah
[58:28] the bible declared
[58:30] that the old men would dream dreams
[58:34] glory to god amen i'm looking for the
[58:38] supernatural at the junction church
[58:40] hallelujah i i am here under expectation
[58:44] looking for the miraculous miraculous is
[58:47] things that only god could do
[58:50] hallelujah not it's not things that we
[58:52] can do but things that only
[58:53] god could do only god could open up a
[58:56] red sea
[58:57] only god could allow the children of
[58:59] israel to cross on dry land
[59:01] only god could shut the mouth of lions
[59:03] praise god
[59:04] only god could take the fire out a man
[59:07] of a fiery furnace

[59:33] get an action first before the
[59:35] manifestation so i'm telling god gave me
[59:37] that as a dream
[59:38] and he gave it to him and three days
[59:40] apart the dreams came
[59:42] and brother and the reason that brother

[59:48] confirmation
[59:50] so when i come out and said he said that
[59:52] was his confirmation three days later
[59:54] he come the confirmation god gave me the
[59:56] same dream

[1:01:08] many

[1:01:15] you're supposed to see miracles it
[1:01:16] happens at every
[1:01:18] junction right and uh you know and
[1:01:21] and as i'm as i'm i'm bringing uh this
[1:01:24] fifth junction
[1:01:25] you know they in scripture they recorded
[1:01:28] about you know just this website i went

[1:01:32] jesus amen um uh
[1:01:35] representing the grace of god came at
[1:01:37] the fifth junction
[1:01:38] and brother branham said it was one of
[1:01:40] the greatest junctions of course it
[1:01:41] would be one of the greatest so one of
[1:01:42] the main junctures
[1:01:43] because of jesus coming right his first
[1:01:46] coming
[1:01:47] but so many miracles that he performed
[1:01:50] uh
[1:01:50] we uh we want to just kind of just pick
[1:01:52] up one out of mark chapter two let's
[1:01:54] just go straight to mark chapter two
[1:01:57] glory glory glory hallelujah
[1:02:00] amen starting here at verse one
[1:02:03] thank you jesus and i have a you know
[1:02:05] just a couple other things that i want
[1:02:07] to kind of
[1:02:08] bring here to talk about our lord and uh
[1:02:11] and we'll just see where where it goes
[1:02:13] but mark chapter two
[1:02:14] amen thank you jesus look at this
[1:02:18] verse one says and again
[1:02:21] he entered into capernaum now i have to
[1:02:24] just stop there just for a moment to
[1:02:26] make sure we're on the same page
[1:02:28] the first miracle that jesus performed
[1:02:30] um
[1:02:31] was the miracle of turning the water
[1:02:33] into wine
[1:02:34] now let me put it this way the first one
[1:02:37] recorded
[1:02:39] can i put it that way the first one
[1:02:41] that's recorded because
[1:02:42] the way that jesus mother approached him
[1:02:46] amen when he was turning the water into
[1:02:48] wine
[1:02:49] uh his mother approached him asked him
[1:02:51] saying now these people don't ran out of
[1:02:53] wine
[1:02:54] hallelujah she knew who to go to come on
[1:02:57] church
[1:02:58] hey man the mama knew who to go to now
[1:03:00] why would the mama have
[1:03:02] confidence that jesus could turn
[1:03:05] this situation around hallelujah that by
[1:03:08] jesus being present look y'all you know
[1:03:11] look uh
[1:03:12] maybe the mama said y'all ain't got
[1:03:13] nothing to worry about
[1:03:15] and don't worry what you mean mary i
[1:03:17] mean all the wine going and this that
[1:03:19] you ain't got nothing to worry about
[1:03:22] what you what what mary come on now what
[1:03:23] you trying to say
[1:03:24] my son is here jesus is here hallelujah
[1:03:28] y'all ain't got nothing to worry about
[1:03:29] well just give me a few minutes to go
[1:03:31] talk to jesus
[1:03:32] and she approached jesus saying i ain't
[1:03:34] got no more why is there anything you
[1:03:36] can do
[1:03:37] and he said it's not even my time yet
[1:03:38] woman he didn't call her mama
[1:03:40] he said it's not my time yet woman he
[1:03:43] said say he said what you want me to do
[1:03:44] so i don't whatever you can do
[1:03:46] now i believe mary must have saw
[1:03:48] something
[1:03:49] at her house in for in order for her to
[1:03:52] have the confidence
[1:03:53] that jesus could turn this situation
[1:03:55] around
[1:03:56] there had to be some other miracles that
[1:03:58] had not been recorded in scripture for
[1:04:01] mary to be able to approach jesus like
[1:04:02] that
[1:04:03] with that type of confidence knowing
[1:04:05] that things was getting ready to change
[1:04:06] in this family
[1:04:08] you say say just please please uh just
[1:04:10] do something to say okay just give me
[1:04:11] some water pops give me some water pots
[1:04:13] give me this give me that and there he
[1:04:15] just bypass processes and turn water
[1:04:17] right into wine i say praise god

[1:07:17] with unclean spirits
[1:07:19] glory to god but you know that man might
[1:07:21] have come one way
[1:07:23] but he didn't leave the same way he came
[1:07:25] hallelujah and i'm
[1:07:26] under expectation that the people of god
[1:07:30] might come into the house one way but
[1:07:32] you will not
[1:07:33] leave the same way you came
[1:07:36] hallelujah if you came sick you're

[1:07:48] come to church
[1:07:48] and leave the same way they came
[1:07:52] that man could not leave the same way he
[1:07:55] came
[1:07:57] those spirits was evicted that day
[1:08:00] hallelujah it's time for the devil to be
[1:08:02] evicted in somebody's life

[1:08:40] from cana
[1:08:41] all the way here to capernaum and that
[1:08:43] boy is living again
[1:08:45] he said god i mean i said you can just
[1:08:47] hear testimony after testimony and the
[1:08:49] people's faith begin to increase
[1:08:51] because of what they were hearing oh
[1:08:54] glory to god

[1:09:34] together
[1:09:34] in so much that there was no room to
[1:09:37] receive them
[1:09:38] no not so much as about the door
[1:09:42] uh and he preached the word unto them i
[1:09:44] wish we had the same type of problem
[1:09:46] today

[1:09:49] knew that he was in the house and the
[1:09:51] church would be full of folk

[1:10:01] bringing one sick of the palsy which was
[1:10:04] born
[1:10:04] of four this is all happening in

[1:10:24] he did this to me he did that and he did
[1:10:26] this he said he's backing down
[1:10:28] maybe that man say uh you know what uh
[1:10:30] if jesus is in town i need to be where
[1:10:32] jesus
[1:10:32] is and his friends go and say say look

[1:10:41] amen friends that don't want to see you
[1:10:43] down in your condition that you're in
[1:10:45] friends that'll pick you up and and
[1:10:47] carry you into the presence of god
[1:10:50] because your friends have faith that if
[1:10:52] they can get you
[1:10:54] into his presence something on change in
[1:10:57] your condition
[1:10:58] man i know you've been paralyzed for
[1:11:00] years but
[1:11:01] if you can get to that service
[1:11:04] hallelujah
[1:11:05] if you can get to where jesus is you
[1:11:08] know some people in paralyzed
[1:11:09] spiritually
[1:11:11] but if they could just get to where
[1:11:12] jesus is
[1:11:14] they'll be loose from their peril that
[1:11:16] perilous
[1:11:17] that that that paralyzed state
[1:11:20] can't even get my words out but i know
[1:11:23] what i'm talking about
[1:11:24] god want to set people free naturally
[1:11:27] god want to set people free spiritually
[1:11:30] god want to set the captives free
[1:11:32] whatever the condition is
[1:11:33] god can set him free
[1:11:37] glory hallelujah glory glory glory we
[1:11:40] got to be convinced that jesus is
[1:11:42] present
[1:11:43] we got to be convinced that amen he's on
[1:11:45] the scene
[1:11:46] now we're not talking about a historical
[1:11:49] god he is moving right now
[1:11:53] glory to god look at this amen says it
[1:11:56] and they come to him coming to him
[1:11:57] bringing one sick
[1:11:59] of the palsy which was born of four
[1:12:02] amen and when they could not come nigh
[1:12:05] unto him for the press they uncovered
[1:12:07] the roof now
[1:12:08] you know we just read that but brother
[1:12:09] branham said that the friend
[1:12:11] that was being carried this man was
[1:12:14] being carried
[1:12:15] a man by his friends and the one that's
[1:12:17] actually paralyzed he's the one
[1:12:19] suggesting to his friend
[1:12:21] look he said i didn't come to just be on
[1:12:23] the outside of the house
[1:12:25] glory to god i need to get in the house
[1:12:28] i need to get this man's attention
[1:12:30] he's the only one that can help me don't
[1:12:32] let this man leave the city without
[1:12:34] seeing me
[1:12:35] this man had to get desperate about this
[1:12:38] so this man suggested to his friends say
[1:12:40] look
[1:12:40] look i know it's too crowded in the
[1:12:42] house but do me a favor take me up to
[1:12:44] the roof
[1:12:45] and when they got to the roof the bible
[1:12:47] says they aren't come at the roof can
[1:12:50] you imagine just somebody just pulling
[1:12:52] this off and
[1:12:53] and pulling that off and what they're
[1:12:54] doing whatever they can to get
[1:12:57] inside of the presence of the lord jesus
[1:13:01] they aren't coming to the roof where he
[1:13:03] was and when they had
[1:13:04] broken it up oh
[1:13:08] jesus i love that some stuff you have to
[1:13:11] break up
[1:13:12] amen in order to get into his presence
[1:13:14] you got to break up some stuff
[1:13:16] you have to disrupt some things in your
[1:13:19] life in
[1:13:19] order to get into the presence of jesus
[1:13:23] so he says and when they had broken it
[1:13:25] up they let
[1:13:26] down the bed wearing the sick of the
[1:13:28] parsley
[1:13:30] now can you imagine that the four guys
[1:13:32] that were bringing him
[1:13:34] glory to god they couldn't even get into
[1:13:36] the presence all they could do is from
[1:13:38] the rooftop
[1:13:40] watch to see what would happen can you
[1:13:42] see him just
[1:13:43] lowering this man down into the presence
[1:13:44] of jesus while he's having church
[1:13:48] while he's in service and they just
[1:13:50] luring this man down into the presence
[1:13:52] of jesus
[1:13:52] then i towed a roof off
[1:13:58] oh glory glory you see the roof is what
[1:14:02] was
[1:14:03] impending them the roof is what was
[1:14:06] stopping them
[1:14:07] from actually coming into the presence
[1:14:09] of the lord jesus
[1:14:10] whatever it is in your life that is
[1:14:13] stopping you
[1:14:14] from coming into the presence of
[1:14:16] almighty god
[1:14:17] i invite you this morning tear that
[1:14:20] thing
[1:14:21] off break it down praise god
[1:14:26] sometimes it's in relationships
[1:14:29] sometimes it's a job that will hinder
[1:14:31] you from getting
[1:14:32] into the presence of god you got to tear
[1:14:34] the roof off yourself
[1:14:39] jesus didn't tear the roof off they tore
[1:14:42] the roof off
[1:14:43] and they came into the presence of
[1:14:45] almighty god
[1:14:47] look at this in the next verse glory to
[1:14:49] god
[1:14:50] it says uh when jesus saw their
[1:14:53] faith he said unto the sick of the palsy
[1:14:57] some of my sins be forgiven thee
[1:15:01] oh this is beautiful to me because you
[1:15:04] would think that when he saw their faith
[1:15:06] he would have brought healing to the man
[1:15:08] but the first thing he did was get rid
[1:15:10] of the sin
[1:15:12] glory hallelujah and that's the first
[1:15:14] thing we need to do is get rid of the
[1:15:16] sin
[1:15:17] let the sin question get settled first
[1:15:19] and then we can take care of everything
[1:15:21] else
[1:15:22] hallelujah amen you know as we talk
[1:15:24] about the supernatural
[1:15:26] you know as god god's already doing
[1:15:28] things and as he continues to do more
[1:15:30] you know i i oh hallelujah you know let
[1:15:33] me just
[1:15:35] i don't know i don't even know if i get
[1:15:37] a chance to say this again so i'm going
[1:15:38] to say this now
[1:15:40] uh god is moving we we come here on
[1:15:44] wednesday night and uh the spirit of god
[1:15:47] just kind of hit the first quote that i
[1:15:48] read
[1:15:50] you know in that first quote you know uh
[1:15:52] brother branham says uh
[1:15:54] somebody's gonna get healed tonight
[1:15:58] he says he says i assure you
[1:16:01] somebody's gonna be healed tonight you
[1:16:04] know and he's just
[1:16:05] and just seemed like the whole church
[1:16:07] caught a hold of that and faith began to
[1:16:09] just ignite and everybody just i mean we
[1:16:12] were having bible study but it felt like
[1:16:14] a
[1:16:14] nice charge went through the church
[1:16:17] right at that moment so you know i just
[1:16:19] felt in my spirit said we're going to
[1:16:20] have a prayer line
[1:16:22] you know just invite anybody want to be
[1:16:23] brave but we're going to have a prayer
[1:16:25] line tonight
[1:16:26] right i mean it was a just like here in
[1:16:28] in mark chapter 2 it was an
[1:16:30] unusual service glory to god on on
[1:16:33] wednesday night it was an unusual
[1:16:35] service
[1:16:36] glory so you know we began uh i said i
[1:16:38] knew we were gonna have a prayer line

[1:16:45] ones here but you know i can't get to
[1:16:47] you once that's that's that's streaming

[1:16:52] to hey man just lay hands on if you're
[1:16:54] going through something in your body
[1:16:56] invite some believer because the bible

[1:17:46] through her procedure i know god did
[1:17:48] that so i give him praise for that

[1:20:05] she had started doing
[1:20:07] she used to she was not really driving

[1:20:11] work and started doing all kinds of
[1:20:12] things he said i know my wife has been

[1:20:28] omnipotent god move on the scene
[1:20:30] whatever your need is god is here to
[1:20:33] speak to it
[1:20:36] glory glory omnipotence is still
[1:20:38] speaking
[1:20:40] he told this man he told this man to say
[1:20:42] your sins are forgiven
[1:20:44] and and now there's a purpose for for
[1:20:46] this uh
[1:20:47] uh being there jesus is trying to show
[1:20:50] the indian
[1:20:51] and his death on the cross the atonement
[1:20:54] there were two things there was what we
[1:20:55] call a dual atonement that was there
[1:20:58] so this the very same blood that brings
[1:21:01] you
[1:21:01] salvation is the very same blood that
[1:21:05] brings you healing
[1:21:06] there is a dual atonement so if you can
[1:21:09] claim your healing
[1:21:10] i mean you can claim your salvation
[1:21:12] without feeling nothing
[1:21:14] you can also claim your healing without
[1:21:16] feeling nothing
[1:21:19] you know you save you know god change
[1:21:21] your life
[1:21:22] don't let the devil take your experience
[1:21:24] from you and if you can stand on your
[1:21:27] own two feet knowing that god has
[1:21:28] changed your heart
[1:21:29] change your life stand with that same
[1:21:32] revelation when the devil attacks your
[1:21:34] body
[1:21:35] because it's the same blood it's not a
[1:21:38] different blood it's the same blood
[1:21:40] that brought you salvation is also
[1:21:42] bringing you healing to your body
[1:21:44] he was wounded for my transgressions
[1:21:46] bruised for my iniquities is a
[1:21:48] chastisement
[1:21:49] of my pieces upon him and with his
[1:21:51] stripes i
[1:21:52] am healed
[1:21:56] glory to god glory to god this is why he
[1:21:59] tells the man
[1:22:00] it says son thy sins be
[1:22:03] forgiven thee oh thank you lord jesus
[1:22:08] son thy sins be forgiven thee uh
[1:22:14] oh my and it goes on and it says uh but
[1:22:17] there
[1:22:18] were certain of the scribes sitting
[1:22:19] there and reasoning in their hearts
[1:22:22] why does this man thus speak blasphemies
[1:22:25] who can forgive sins but god
[1:22:27] god uh only now they didn't realize it
[1:22:29] was god dwelling in jesus
[1:22:32] he was god in the flesh that's why he
[1:22:34] could forgive this this man of his sins
[1:22:37] they knew that only god could do it but
[1:22:39] who is this man this is
[1:22:40] god this is omnipotence dwelling in the
[1:22:43] flesh
[1:22:44] right it says uh it says but there were
[1:22:47] certain
[1:22:48] of the scribes sitting and reason uh i'm
[1:22:50] sorry a verse said why does this man
[1:22:52] thus speak blasphemies who can forgive
[1:22:53] sins but god only and immediately when
[1:22:56] jesus perceived
[1:22:58] in his spirit that they saw reason
[1:23:01] within themselves
[1:23:02] he said unto them why read him ye these
[1:23:06] things in your hearts says whether it is
[1:23:08] easy to say to the sick of the palsy
[1:23:11] thy sins be forgiven thee or to say
[1:23:14] arise and take up thy bed and walk which
[1:23:16] one is easier
[1:23:18] glory to god for for jesus they were
[1:23:20] both easy
[1:23:22] and i want to tell you right now
[1:23:23] whatever you're you're going through
[1:23:25] it's easy for jesus
[1:23:27] if you just get him involved this is
[1:23:29] that's an easy problem
[1:23:31] glory to god look he says but that ye
[1:23:33] may know
[1:23:35] that the son of man hath power on
[1:23:38] earth to forgive sins he said to the
[1:23:42] sick of the palsy
[1:23:43] i say unto thee arise and take up thy
[1:23:47] bed and go thy way
[1:23:49] into thine house oh omnipotent spoke
[1:23:54] glory to god this man was trying to just
[1:23:56] get there
[1:23:57] in the presence of the lord jesus
[1:23:59] because he knew
[1:24:00] that if he got there everything would
[1:24:02] change in his situation
[1:24:04] and look at his verse 12 says and
[1:24:06] immediately he arose
[1:24:07] took up the bed and went forth before
[1:24:10] them all in so much that they were all
[1:24:12] amazed
[1:24:13] and glorified god saying we never saw it
[1:24:16] on this fashion when we love to have a
[1:24:19] service like that
[1:24:20] where we can turn say we never saw it on
[1:24:24] this fashion
[1:24:25] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:24:28] glory omnipotent spoke to his situation
[1:24:32] now i want to uh just maybe catch a
[1:24:35] quote here if i can just find it
[1:24:38] oh yes lord yes lord yes lord
[1:24:41] oh my amen amen amen
[1:24:46] uh i i i have to save that one i'm
[1:24:49] okay uh yes let's uh this is out of uh
[1:24:52] life is the healer life is the healer
[1:24:56] the prophet says this wish i was twice
[1:24:59] my size
[1:25:01] he says i feel i feel so good maybe i
[1:25:04] i'll i can uh hold twice as much when i
[1:25:06] think of his goodness
[1:25:08] and his omnipotence and its power
[1:25:12] how um how the weasley little so-called
[1:25:15] spineless christian of today is afraid
[1:25:17] to step
[1:25:18] out and put god's word first
[1:25:21] and take him at his word glory it says
[1:25:25] notice jesus come to destroy the works
[1:25:27] of the devil
[1:25:28] and healing the sick he proved his
[1:25:31] messiahship
[1:25:32] he proved by seeing visions amen the
[1:25:35] world knew because
[1:25:36] he didn't take credit to himself he gave
[1:25:39] it to the father he said i can do
[1:25:41] nothing
[1:25:41] till the father shows me first what to
[1:25:43] do and he healed the sick and he raised
[1:25:46] the dead
[1:25:46] he cleansed the lepers and he proved his
[1:25:48] messiahship
[1:25:49] and the church of the living god that'll
[1:25:52] do the same today
[1:25:54] proves the messiah is good to his word
[1:25:58] and living in the church gloria
[1:26:01] i think the case of the paralytic proved
[1:26:03] that jesus both came to save
[1:26:05] and to heal he said to the boy thy sins
[1:26:08] be forgiven thee take up your bed and
[1:26:10] walk
[1:26:11] he found out what he found out that it
[1:26:14] was that it was sin
[1:26:15] glory to god so he had to get the sin
[1:26:17] question set up first
[1:26:19] before he could actually get his healing
[1:26:20] in his body and there's
[1:26:22] many a people they won't heal him but
[1:26:24] they don't want to settle the sin
[1:26:26] question first hallelujah i mean
[1:26:29] sometimes before you just pray for
[1:26:30] somebody always try to find out what
[1:26:32] their spiritual condition is
[1:26:34] glory to god make sure the same question
[1:26:37] is settled first
[1:26:38] because if they don't get the same
[1:26:39] question settled then the enemy has
[1:26:42] a right to continue to torment them
[1:26:45] let them get the sin question set up
[1:26:47] first now i want to um just kind of
[1:26:50] catch something here
[1:26:53] oh yes lord i there's a uh
[1:26:56] i want to catch another scripture there
[1:26:58] are so many miracles that he performed
[1:27:00] at this junction and and one of the
[1:27:02] others you know because
[1:27:03] they're i'm gonna read this this quote i
[1:27:05] didn't i didn't read it last week but
[1:27:07] it's uh it's here in the junction of
[1:27:09] time
[1:27:10] and i'm gonna start at paragraph e42
[1:27:13] amen on this
[1:27:14] e-42 junction of time and i'm going to
[1:27:17] go back to another scripture after we
[1:27:19] after we read this
[1:27:20] uh it says there he walked to the grave
[1:27:23] talking about the grave of lazarus says
[1:27:24] omnipotence manifesting here among us
[1:27:28] living with us god and christ
[1:27:31] reconciling the world
[1:27:33] to himself here he lived with us god
[1:27:36] proven himself through his son christ
[1:27:38] jesus he was omnipotent and
[1:27:40] miraculous he was all-powerful and
[1:27:43] demonstrating miracles right omnipotent
[1:27:46] and miraculous
[1:27:47] and if he's the same yesterday today and
[1:27:49] forever
[1:27:50] and he said i'll never leave you i'll
[1:27:52] never forsake you i'll be with you to
[1:27:53] the end of the world
[1:27:55] how can we look for anything else but
[1:27:58] when he speaks for the miraculous to
[1:28:00] happen how can we look for anything else
[1:28:02] he said how can we expect anything else
[1:28:05] so here he goes down to the grave of
[1:28:08] weeping
[1:28:10] glory and then omnipotence gathered
[1:28:12] itself together and he spoke lazarus
[1:28:14] come forth
[1:28:15] and a man that was already rottening the
[1:28:18] nose that fell from his face in four
[1:28:20] days the skin worms had done set in
[1:28:22] corruption knew its master hallelujah
[1:28:25] he give back the life of this dead man
[1:28:28] and a man that was once dead
[1:28:30] stood on his feet and lived again the
[1:28:31] miraculous i am the resurrection and the
[1:28:34] life saith god he that believeth in me
[1:28:36] though he were dead yet shall he live
[1:28:38] and whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[1:28:40] shall never die what a
[1:28:42] great miracle when he stood there and
[1:28:44] called lazarus from the grave
[1:28:45] omnipotence
[1:28:46] spoke not even death could keep a man in
[1:28:50] the grave
[1:28:51] when omnipotence spoke he had power
[1:28:54] even over the death he had power over
[1:28:57] the grave
[1:28:58] he had power over these things that's
[1:29:00] the omnipotent god that we serve
[1:29:04] so brother branham says this in the next
[1:29:05] quote he says speak omnipotence
[1:29:08] glory to god that's that's i didn't get
[1:29:10] it last week but i just
[1:29:11] i went off inspiration speak omnipotence
[1:29:15] amen and i i i'm grateful that he spoke
[1:29:18] to lazarus
[1:29:19] i'm grateful that he spoke to you know
[1:29:22] many of these other
[1:29:23] uh other testimonies that were reading
[1:29:24] scripture to the noble man we we're glad
[1:29:26] we're grateful that he spoke there
[1:29:28] hallelujah
[1:29:28] but today we need him to
[1:29:32] speak again
[1:29:35] last week as we were going through this
[1:29:37] sermon and and i said speak omnipotence
[1:29:39] you know god began to speak
[1:29:40] directly to people's situations right
[1:29:43] here in the church
[1:29:44] different things that folk was going
[1:29:46] through you sometimes the preacher just
[1:29:48] thinking up there preaching
[1:29:49] no omnipotence is speaking to people
[1:29:53] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:29:55] forever
[1:29:57] he is still moving church we got to
[1:29:58] recognize when he's moving
[1:30:01] hallelujah hallelujah speak omnipotence
[1:30:04] he says miraculous will take place
[1:30:09] i believe that amen says and you always
[1:30:11] do it
[1:30:12] at the junction and we're at the
[1:30:14] junction it says be alarmed when you see
[1:30:16] these things happen we're at the end
[1:30:17] time omnipotence speaks
[1:30:19] and a dead man dead and lived again
[1:30:21] stood on the street and went to a
[1:30:22] banquet and eat supper with him

[1:32:19] lord jesus christ and he's still
[1:32:21] speaking today
[1:32:22] amen through that same vessel i want to
[1:32:25] just kind of pick up something here in
[1:32:27] the scripture
[1:32:28] matthew 8 and uh matthew 8 verse 16.
[1:32:33] just a a a a a a word that is spoke here
[1:32:36] and i was reading this and
[1:32:39] i was just blessed by matthew 8 and
[1:32:41] verse 16
[1:32:42] hallelujah omnipotence is still speaking
[1:32:47] glory if i can just get him involved i
[1:32:49] know my situation going to change i
[1:32:51] i know it i already know it ain't ain't
[1:32:53] no way it gonna stay the same if i get
[1:32:55] jesus involved
[1:32:56] glory hallelujah i don't care how
[1:32:58] impossible it looks
[1:33:00] once jesus once jesus shows up
[1:33:03] everything
[1:33:04] everything changed my god
[1:33:07] my god just get him involved church i'm
[1:33:09] telling you
[1:33:10] um speak omnipotence that's that's why
[1:33:13] prayer speak
[1:33:13] omnipotence amen here in matthew 8 and
[1:33:17] verse 16 it says
[1:33:19] when the even was come they brought unto
[1:33:22] him many
[1:33:24] that were possessed with devils glory to
[1:33:27] god
[1:33:28] and he cast out the spirits with his
[1:33:31] word
[1:33:32] and healed all that was sick now can you
[1:33:35] imagine
[1:33:36] this so the the the part that just
[1:33:39] blesses my heart
[1:33:40] he casts out the spirits
[1:33:43] with his word
[1:33:46] speak omnipotence
[1:33:50] if you want to see spirits leave all we
[1:33:53] need is just for him to open his mouth
[1:33:55] now you got to understand something only
[1:33:57] mouth that he has today
[1:34:00] is your mouth hallelujah so if we want
[1:34:04] omnipotence to speak we're gonna have to
[1:34:07] open up our mouths and allow him to
[1:34:10] speak
[1:34:11] because spirits can be cast out oh
[1:34:14] we don't get it yet you don't have to go
[1:34:17] and fight with your family members
[1:34:20] you ain't got to wrestle with them and
[1:34:22] fuss and argue and all that
[1:34:24] let them argue you just keep speaking
[1:34:28] cause he cast out spirits with his word
[1:34:32] and he healed all that was sick
[1:34:36] now i want you to catch this because in
[1:34:38] matthew 8 there was a number
[1:34:39] of a number of of of of
[1:34:43] healings that took place and i can't
[1:34:45] read them all so i'm gonna just have to
[1:34:46] summarize them
[1:34:47] you know as we start the the chapter
[1:34:49] there in matthew 8
[1:34:50] there was a leper a man who uh who knew
[1:34:55] again and said look uh uh you know i got
[1:34:58] this condition
[1:34:59] hallelujah and leprosy in that time was
[1:35:01] really uh
[1:35:02] it was not able to be cured you were you
[1:35:05] were you had you were in a
[1:35:06] hopeless situation if i could put it in
[1:35:09] today's terms
[1:35:11] cancer because people as soon as they
[1:35:13] hear cancer they feel like they're in a
[1:35:15] hopeless situation
[1:35:16] why do you think the angel of the lord
[1:35:18] told a prophet
[1:35:20] and notice what that he's saying say if
[1:35:22] you can get the people to believe
[1:35:24] say not even cancer why would the angel
[1:35:28] tell the prophet not even cancer
[1:35:30] because he knew what the people would be
[1:35:32] facing today you know
[1:35:33] somebody here diabetes oh okay no
[1:35:35] problem high blood pressure oh no
[1:35:37] problem
[1:35:37] cancer oh
[1:35:41] i mean people people even you know they
[1:35:42] don't even pray for you if you got
[1:35:44] diabetes
[1:35:48] right they don't it don't even hit a
[1:35:49] radar
[1:35:51] if diabetes has attacked your body a
[1:35:52] high blood pressure it don't even hit
[1:35:54] the radar but when you say cancer
[1:35:56] and and and they give it degrees
[1:36:00] come on church right there are stages
[1:36:03] they say you got
[1:36:04] fourth stage when you hear that that
[1:36:07] means you walk in death
[1:36:09] hallelujah glory to god but but i'ma
[1:36:12] tell you something i
[1:36:13] i i serve a god amen
[1:36:16] a god that controls even death
[1:36:20] we talked about how he stopped amen
[1:36:23] elizabeth from rotten in the grave

[1:36:28] going to bury her son

[1:36:41] death glory to god life overruled
[1:36:44] death and jesus just touched the buyer
[1:36:48] he touched the casket
[1:36:49] and the boy came up out of that casket
[1:36:52] and went home with his mama

[1:39:29] him
[1:39:30] see thou tell no man
[1:39:34] wait a minute wait a minute i had
[1:39:38] leprosy
[1:39:40] i had leprosy how is it that i can't

[1:43:11] here with all these great miracles
[1:43:13] happening at capernaum
[1:43:15] you know what capernaum is today
[1:43:19] in the bottom of the ocean jesus
[1:43:21] prophesied against it
[1:43:23] he says the great things that happened
[1:43:25] here i mean the people should have been
[1:43:26] repenting after all this he said y'all
[1:43:28] didn't even repent say
[1:43:29] say you're gonna fall underneath the
[1:43:31] bottom of the sea
[1:43:32] jesus prophesied against capernaum with
[1:43:34] all these great things
[1:43:36] oh my god my god don't find yourself
[1:43:38] like the people
[1:43:40] of capernaum praise the lord
[1:43:45] amen but let's pick up this this this
[1:43:47] other event that happened
[1:43:49] at capernaum glory
[1:43:53] and when jesus was entered into
[1:43:57] capernaum there came unto him
[1:44:00] a centurion
[1:44:04] beseeching him now now now you know i
[1:44:08] was just reading something
[1:44:09] and just a little note in my bible we
[1:44:11] know that this man is a ruler
[1:44:13] uh in the military and what they said
[1:44:15] now he was a non-commissioned
[1:44:18] officer there's something about this
[1:44:23] and i wish i had time to really talk to
[1:44:25] brother quinton before i actually
[1:44:26] you know touched on this i wish i would
[1:44:28] have had time you know talk to somebody
[1:44:30] who's been in the military
[1:44:32] i know brother quake who's been in the
[1:44:33] military you know our sister amanda been
[1:44:36] in the military
[1:44:37] praise the lord we got some military
[1:44:39] people here glory
[1:44:40] you know say but but a non-commissioned
[1:44:43] officer
[1:44:43] there's only a certain rank that you can
[1:44:45] get to
[1:44:46] as a non-income is that right your
[1:44:48] military people you can only go so high
[1:44:50] as a non-commissioned officer now your
[1:44:53] officer
[1:44:54] you're just non-commissioned you'll
[1:44:55] never make it to
[1:44:57] general you'll never make it to you know
[1:45:00] uh a
[1:45:00] colonel into that i think the highest
[1:45:02] they get is sergeant major
[1:45:05] that's what they were saying about this
[1:45:06] man he made it maybe to sergeant major
[1:45:08] but
[1:45:08] even as a sergeant major
[1:45:11] come on church i might not be general
[1:45:15] and i might not be a man colonel i might
[1:45:18] not be this i might
[1:45:19] but as a as a sergeant major i still
[1:45:22] recognize that i'm a man
[1:45:24] of authority
[1:45:27] hallelujah glory to god
[1:45:30] maybe the general don't have to listen
[1:45:33] to me
[1:45:34] maybe the colonel don't have to listen
[1:45:36] to me but i got some people that if i
[1:45:38] say go
[1:45:40] glory to god they go i got others and i
[1:45:43] say
[1:45:44] come and they come one thing i do know
[1:45:47] as a son of god and as a daughter of god
[1:45:50] i can tell the devil to go
[1:45:55] lose my family and let them go
[1:45:59] amen glory to god even moses stood up
[1:46:02] and said let my people go
[1:46:05] hallelujah you have that authority
[1:46:09] as a son or daughter of god
[1:46:12] this man recognized his position
[1:46:16] this man says something here in
[1:46:18] scripture he approaches the lord jesus
[1:46:22] said lord my servant lied at home sick
[1:46:26] of the palsy grievously tormented
[1:46:29] now now we we we're picking it up in
[1:46:31] matthew 8 but
[1:46:32] you know and the other one of the other
[1:46:33] gospels it's described a little
[1:46:35] differently
[1:46:37] and the other gospel it wasn't that this
[1:46:39] man actually came to jesus himself
[1:46:42] but what happened was that this man um
[1:46:45] you know he um he sent his servants
[1:46:48] there to the lord
[1:46:49] glory to god he sent his servants there
[1:46:51] to the lord and says look
[1:46:52] say i'm not worthy that this man should
[1:46:54] even come under my roof and i'm not even
[1:46:56] worthy to go into his presence so
[1:46:57] just you know if y'all would just go get
[1:46:59] him maybe he'll come in and pray for
[1:47:01] for his servant i really love this
[1:47:02] servant so so some of the the
[1:47:05] the man's leaders uh some of the
[1:47:07] servants they went
[1:47:08] jesus you know this man been good to the
[1:47:10] jews and this man is this this man is
[1:47:12] that please come to his house and he'll
[1:47:14] serve
[1:47:14] jesus said i'll come and go i'll come
[1:47:17] see if he's invited
[1:47:19] he'll come if he's invited he'll come
[1:47:24] glory to god wherever he's invited he'll
[1:47:27] come
[1:47:28] glory to god if you just open up and
[1:47:31] invite him lord i need you
[1:47:33] i want you to speak i want you to handle

[1:54:23] maybe and i could just see him looking
[1:54:27] at the disciples like
[1:54:34] now this man ain't been to one of my
[1:54:35] church services
[1:54:38] this is what i'm talking about
[1:54:43] he marveled at what the man said
[1:54:46] this man just heard about jesus but
[1:54:48] understood the authority
[1:54:50] he had a revelation of authority
[1:54:54] glory to god look at this he says uh
[1:54:57] and i have not found found so great
[1:55:00] faith no

[1:55:10] children of the kingdom shall be cast
[1:55:12] out into outer darkness
[1:55:13] there shall be weeping and national
[1:55:15] teeth he takes a moment to prophesy
[1:55:19] hallelujah but he didn't forget the man
[1:55:20] request he says and jesus
[1:55:22] said unto the centurion go thy way
[1:55:26] and ask thou hast believed
[1:55:30] because this is what you believe you
[1:55:31] believe that if i just said a word that
[1:55:33] the thing would change
[1:55:34] as thou has believed so be it done
[1:55:38] unto thee that's all
[1:55:41] omnipotent need to speak now you can you
[1:55:43] get that
[1:55:44] he never said your servant is whole he
[1:55:47] never said you know this he said
[1:55:49] only he says as you believe so be it
[1:55:52] done unto you so what's in your heart
[1:55:56] i i i ask you again what's in your heart
[1:56:00] what do you want
[1:56:03] what are you asking god for so you can
[1:56:07] leave
[1:56:07] church today and receive whatever it is
[1:56:09] that you were believing for
[1:56:21] see let me just go a little further
[1:56:24] verse 14 and when
[1:56:25] when jesus was come see look at this now
[1:56:29] the sermon was oh oh i'm sorry i did i
[1:56:31] skipped verse 13
[1:56:32] it says and jesus said to him go that
[1:56:34] way uh and as thou has believed so be it
[1:56:37] done unto thee and his servant was
[1:56:39] healed
[1:56:39] in the self same hour now that's that
[1:56:43] this week we serve an immediate god
[1:56:48] self say mouth omnipotence when he speak
[1:56:51] things change
[1:56:53] why not go back and find your situation
[1:56:55] different
[1:56:56] let me go a little further because you
[1:56:58] know and when jesus was coming to
[1:57:00] peter's house
[1:57:01] he saw his wife's mother laid and sick
[1:57:04] of a fifa and he touched her hand
[1:57:15] see that's this is you know this is
[1:57:17] where we get these things from look
[1:57:18] speak to me
[1:57:20] touch me you know i mean you know he
[1:57:22] ain't even have to say a prayer
[1:57:24] and this is this is why we got to
[1:57:26] understand the bible tell us if we lay
[1:57:27] hands on the sick they should
[1:57:29] we that don't mean we have to even pray
[1:57:31] over him just touch him
[1:57:34] and the devil the devil is actually
[1:57:36] trying to get us to a spot where we
[1:57:37] don't want to touch
[1:57:38] nobody
[1:57:44] the devil bringing fear on us we don't
[1:57:46] want to touch
[1:57:47] nobody but but what we see here in
[1:57:49] scripture this
[1:57:50] is supposed to be manifested in and
[1:57:52] through us
[1:57:55] this is why this was an important
[1:57:56] junction it places
[1:57:58] us as the body
[1:58:03] right here here he said all the lady got
[1:58:06] a fever
[1:58:09] fever you know and now we see somebody
[1:58:12] repeating don't come to church
[1:58:17] no no you come on we got to find a
[1:58:19] balance here
[1:58:21] i want to get back to the bible days
[1:58:24] this this did
[1:58:25] he hear he said and when jesus was come
[1:58:28] into peter's house
[1:58:29] he saw his wife's mother laid and sick
[1:58:32] of a fever
[1:58:34] and he touched her hand and the fever
[1:58:38] left her and she arose
[1:58:41] and ministered unto them
[1:58:44] now when the people saw
[1:58:48] that uh
[1:58:52] when they saw this leper cleanse
[1:58:55] they saw the centurion servant hill and
[1:58:57] all this stuff happening within hours
[1:58:59] you can imagine the bloods that's going
[1:59:01] on in the city
[1:59:03] and then people said now peter's
[1:59:05] mother-in-law she's been down for
[1:59:07] me who knows how long she's been down on
[1:59:09] the street but it was only after he
[1:59:10] touched it that the fever broke
[1:59:13] fever left fever is a spirit that comes
[1:59:16] from hell
[1:59:19] but a touch can actually cause the fever
[1:59:21] you know sometimes when um
[1:59:23] when people get ill in the house or
[1:59:24] whatever like that sometimes the folk
[1:59:26] just
[1:59:26] just just touch them a little bit just
[1:59:29] let them know that you're there to take
[1:59:30] care of them
[1:59:31] you better see them through you know
[1:59:32] people start feeling better
[1:59:34] right if you you you're going i'm gonna
[1:59:36] bring you some soup and i'm gonna bring
[1:59:38] you this
[1:59:38] you know i'm gonna try to nurse you back
[1:59:40] to hell come on somebody
[1:59:42] not not not you sick well
[1:59:45] i go get myself something to eat what
[1:59:47] about getting them something to eat
[1:59:50] what about having compassion for them
[1:59:53] right right i mean jesus just showed a
[1:59:55] little compassion towards this lady
[1:59:57] just walked up and just touched him
[1:59:59] never even prayed just his compassion
[2:00:02] alone
[2:00:02] brought healing oh y'all ain't heard
[2:00:05] that
[2:00:06] you realize if you just showed a little
[2:00:08] compassion it might bring healing in
[2:00:09] your household
[2:00:12] i'ma say it again a little compassion
[2:00:14] might bring healing in your household
[2:00:18] compassion did it
[2:00:23] it's right here in the bible
[2:00:27] it just took capernaum just on fire
[2:00:31] all these things are happening capernaum
[2:00:34] and now look at what happened in verse
[2:00:35] 16. this is why i read verse 16 before
[2:00:42] when the even was come
[2:00:45] they brought unto him many that were
[2:00:46] possessed with devils
[2:00:50] and he cast out the spirits
[2:00:54] with his word
[2:00:58] and he'll all that were sick
[2:01:02] that it might be fulfilled
[2:01:06] which was spoken by isaiah
[2:01:09] the prophet saying himself took our
[2:01:12] infirmities
[2:01:16] and bear our sicknesses
[2:01:19] that's pluralized he took on firmness
[2:01:24] and he also bore our sicknesses so if he
[2:01:27] bored
[2:01:28] i ain't got to bear it
[2:01:32] i ain't got the bear i ain't got to
[2:01:34] accept nothing that the devil said my
[2:01:36] way
[2:01:38] let me just read a couple things here
[2:01:39] and i'm going to try to bring this to a
[2:01:40] close but
[2:01:42] i just thank god
[2:01:45] we need omnipotence to speak
[2:01:48] and i believe he is speaking i want to
[2:01:51] read from
[2:01:53] the patmos vision this is uh the message
[2:01:56] that patma's vision preached in 1960.
[2:02:02] oh my speak i'm nepotism miraculous will
[2:02:04] take place
[2:02:05] and you always do at the junction he's
[2:02:08] speaking right now
[2:02:09] 1960 the patmos vision says amen
[2:02:13] the prophet says amen cut every obstacle
[2:02:18] remember you have to tear the roof off
[2:02:23] right you get you got to tear the roof
[2:02:24] off i mean get get rid of stuff
[2:02:26] break break it up break it break it up
[2:02:30] look at what the prophet said cut every
[2:02:32] obstacle from human beings
[2:02:35] that they might be connected
[2:02:38] like in the garden of eden
[2:02:41] and i love this because this this
[2:02:43] restoration
[2:02:44] uh that we're experiencing in the sounds
[2:02:46] of restoration that take us back to
[2:02:48] what the power that adam had in the
[2:02:50] beginning
[2:02:51] right that's what we're going back to
[2:02:53] glory to god uh he said and says um
[2:02:56] um connected like in the garden of eden
[2:02:59] now man i was going to choke it but i'm
[2:03:02] going to say it
[2:03:04] i'm so happy the prophet said it it says
[2:03:06] man
[2:03:07] is omnipotent
[2:03:10] you don't believe that but he is
[2:03:14] it says a man fully surrendered
[2:03:17] to god is omnipotent i mean a man
[2:03:20] fully surrendered to god is all-powerful
[2:03:24] do you get that a man or woman fully
[2:03:27] surrendered to god is
[2:03:28] all powerful
[2:03:32] oh yeah y'all i i don't seen it happen
[2:03:35] in my day i i i mean
[2:03:37] uh god just do some amazing things i
[2:03:40] haven't been in situations
[2:03:42] where i'm in i'm in in my car
[2:03:45] and i can see in my mirror man something
[2:03:47] getting ready to take place
[2:03:48] either somebody getting to hit me from
[2:03:50] this side or or maybe something coming
[2:03:52] up
[2:03:52] in front of me and i'm watching
[2:03:54] something and there's not not much i can
[2:03:56] do
[2:03:57] if i go to the right i'ma hit somebody
[2:03:59] if i go to the left i'ma hit somebody if
[2:04:00] i
[2:04:01] if i stop they're going to hit me in the
[2:04:02] back it's just not much i can do
[2:04:05] i only have one thing i can do
[2:04:11] there it is only one thing i can do
[2:04:15] and it's the word it's one name
[2:04:18] one name that comes out of my mouth
[2:04:21] and all i do is i only call them one
[2:04:24] time
[2:04:25] jesus and once i call his name a man
[2:04:29] fully surrendered god become omnipotent
[2:04:32] everything changed just by calling his
[2:04:36] name
[2:04:38] i haven't seen it happen too many times
[2:04:41] i'm not talking about an
[2:04:42] all-night prayer meeting i'm talking
[2:04:43] about just calling his name one time
[2:04:47] and i ain't calling his name just to
[2:04:48] call his name i'm calling cause i got
[2:04:51] confidence
[2:04:53] when i call him something's gonna change
[2:05:01] man is omnipotent you don't believe that
[2:05:04] but he is a man fully surrendered god is
[2:05:06] omnipotent did not he say in mark 11 22
[2:05:10] whatsoever things you say and you and

[2:05:33] omnipotents
[2:05:34] meet when god and man comes together
[2:05:38] through omnipotence
[2:05:40] then something's got to shake says
[2:05:43] whatsoever you said
[2:05:44] with that creative power of omnipotence
[2:05:47] of
[2:05:48] god knowing that he's promised it and he
[2:05:51] said it in his word it creates a
[2:05:53] power oh glory to god this is why you
[2:05:55] got to open your mouth
[2:05:57] it creates a power that goes out yonder
[2:06:00] and brings things to pass things that is
[2:06:04] not
[2:06:04] it makes them as though they are
[2:06:08] because two omnipotents have met

[2:07:05] omnipotent
[2:07:09] oh lord i love you look at this statue
[2:07:12] of a perfect man
[2:07:13] it says here the roman went out to meet
[2:07:15] jesus
[2:07:16] said i'm not worthy that you come under
[2:07:18] my roof and i'm not i'm not worthy
[2:07:20] and i don't count myself that way but
[2:07:22] said my son is very sick and you just
[2:07:24] speak the word see my
[2:07:26] son will live what was it distance made
[2:07:29] no difference i had to read that to you
[2:07:32] i don't care where your children are
[2:07:36] distance makes no difference hallelujah
[2:07:41] amen sometimes like i was saying on
[2:07:43] easter you expect certain family members
[2:07:45] to be there at least for easter
[2:07:47] but distance makes no difference
[2:07:50] and really for us you know we going
[2:07:52] farther than easter i want you just here
[2:07:54] for one sunday
[2:07:56] i want you here for the for the rest of
[2:07:58] your days
[2:07:59] amen like like david said i'll dwell in
[2:08:01] the house of the lord forever
[2:08:03] that's what i want to see this this
[2:08:06] makes no difference
[2:08:08] amen it says uh because god is
[2:08:10] omnipresent
[2:08:11] god is omnipotent in every way god is
[2:08:13] omnipotence is there
[2:08:15] and god being omnipresent that makes god
[2:08:17] everywhere all over sea god is just as
[2:08:19] great in germany
[2:08:21] and switzerland down in africa right
[2:08:24] this minute as he is right here
[2:08:26] oh there you are so now uh so so now he
[2:08:29] said i'm not worthy that you come to my
[2:08:31] roof to speak the word what was it
[2:08:33] it was a roman's faith he believed it
[2:08:35] and jesus said go your way your son
[2:08:36] lives and
[2:08:37] he took out two days journey the next
[2:08:39] day before he got home he met some of
[2:08:41] his servants coming and they said thy
[2:08:42] son live now brother branham just
[2:08:43] actually intertwined two stories there
[2:08:45] if you can catch it it's the nobleman
[2:08:47] and you know the uh the centurion
[2:08:50] he says uh he says and the roman was so
[2:08:52] thrilled until he said
[2:08:53] what time of day did he start getting
[2:08:54] better what part of the day he said
[2:08:56] about the 11th hour he began to amend
[2:08:58] and the roman knew that it was the very
[2:09:01] time that jesus said thy son liveth and
[2:09:04] and he had believed amen omnipotent
[2:09:06] omnipresent
[2:09:07] omniscient infinite that's god so when
[2:09:10] they when
[2:09:11] when they make a phone call and say pray
[2:09:14] that contact and your faith brings god
[2:09:16] it's the thing that brings the prayer
[2:09:18] and god together on the scene
[2:09:20] prayer faith changes from here to here
[2:09:24] it brings it together look it says speak
[2:09:26] the word
[2:09:28] oh um it says a speaker all i want you
[2:09:31] to do
[2:09:32] is say the word
[2:09:35] speak the word all i want you to do is
[2:09:38] say the word
[2:09:39] and everything is all right see he
[2:09:42] didn't have to be there
[2:09:44] just say the words why god is
[2:09:46] omnipresent
[2:09:48] he's all powerful he's just as powerful
[2:09:51] beneath the world as he is on top of the
[2:09:53] world
[2:09:53] on either side he's god and the only
[2:09:56] thing you have to do is just speak
[2:09:58] the word he said and now faith does
[2:10:02] and faith does the rest of it faith
[2:10:05] does the rest so you must have faith for
[2:10:07] a foundation
[2:10:09] all christianity all you are all you
[2:10:11] ever be is based upon faith in
[2:10:13] the word that's the reason i believe the
[2:10:16] word
[2:10:18] see the last quote i want to read is
[2:10:20] coming out of church age book
[2:10:22] the patmos vision and church age book
[2:10:26] speak omnipotence speak omnipotence
[2:10:32] see matthew 8 just kind of turns the
[2:10:35] the the the picture for us just a little
[2:10:37] bit because this man when he
[2:10:38] he recognized authority that he had he
[2:10:40] put it so jesus you got the same
[2:10:42] authority
[2:10:42] brother ramsay that's the same type of
[2:10:44] faith that we're supposed to have
[2:10:46] that's gentile faith
[2:10:49] here patma's vision he says this don't
[2:10:52] fear john john
[2:10:53] in the book of revelation was
[2:10:54] representing the bride representing us
[2:10:57] right don't fear john don't fear little
[2:10:59] flock
[2:11:01] this is all that i am
[2:11:04] you are heir to oh i love this all that
[2:11:07] i am you are
[2:11:08] heir too since all my power
[2:11:12] is yours my omnipotence
[2:11:18] my omnipotence is yours
[2:11:24] my omnipotence
[2:11:28] it belongs to you as the bride of christ
[2:11:32] this is for you this is why he can cry
[2:11:35] out to you
[2:11:36] speak omnipotence but first you must be
[2:11:39] fully surrendered to him
[2:11:42] hallelujah if you want to operate an
[2:11:44] exercise in this
[2:11:46] you must become fully surrendered to the
[2:11:48] lord jesus christ
[2:11:50] god whatever you want i want to that's
[2:11:52] what i want
[2:11:54] yo your will is my will your your ways
[2:11:57] is my ways
[2:11:59] your people is my people hallelujah
[2:12:02] she says my omnipotence is yours as i
[2:12:06] stand in your midst i have
[2:12:09] not come to bring
[2:12:12] fear and failure
[2:12:15] but love and courage
[2:12:19] and ability
[2:12:27] all power is given unto me
[2:12:31] and it's yours to use
[2:12:40] you speak the word
[2:12:44] and i will perform it
[2:12:49] that is my covenant
[2:12:52] and it can never fail

[2:17:30] just trying to move
[2:17:31] us right into something you know i'm
[2:17:35] reminded of a statement that uh

[2:23:09] two seconds it's i'm just testifying
[2:23:11] based upon
[2:23:12] the things that i've heard and when we
[2:23:15] me and brother jack was going up to the
[2:23:16] minister's meeting
[2:23:18] and um one of the brothers uh
[2:23:22] sent brother jack a text uh somebody was
[2:23:25] preaching
[2:23:26] and it was a scripture that i think
[2:23:29] sarah had get uh put out and how
[2:23:33] god would give you i can't i don't
[2:23:35] remember
[2:23:36] totally how god will give you wisdom
[2:23:39] right in business and things of that
[2:23:41] nature and
[2:23:42] and things that uh you don't really
[2:23:45] understand because
[2:23:46] i've been in the trade for 30 some years
[2:23:49] but
[2:23:50] it's still things that you know i lack
[2:23:53] as far as my
[2:23:54] understanding in areas of what i do
[2:23:58] and uh so i'm just asking god to give me
[2:24:01] the wisdom
[2:24:02] because people they don't they don't
[2:24:05] readily
[2:24:06] just want you to know this stuff
[2:24:09] because you become their competition so
[2:24:12] i'm just believing god to uh
[2:24:16] prosper me in in what i'm doing and some
[2:24:18] other things that i got on my heart that
[2:24:20] i've
[2:24:21] long desired because uh you know
[2:24:24] construction
[2:24:24] construction it weigh on you and i'm
[2:24:27] getting older
[2:24:28] but some other things that i desire to
[2:24:31] do
[2:24:32] that it's just a desire
[2:24:35] i don't know how to do it completely
[2:24:38] it's things that i understand
[2:24:40] so i'm believing god you know and y'all
[2:24:44] believe
[2:24:44] god with me you right see
[2:24:47] if if you say brother y'all believe god
[2:24:51] with me for these things and whatever
[2:24:53] you your desire is i believe god with
[2:24:56] you
[2:24:58] for these things god god is doing
[2:25:02] great things right
[2:25:06] from from the beginning of the year you
[2:25:08] know i just been
