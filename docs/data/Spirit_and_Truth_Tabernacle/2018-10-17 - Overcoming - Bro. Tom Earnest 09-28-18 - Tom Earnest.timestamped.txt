[27:47] seated now I'm I'm still getting a lot
[27:49] of ring back are you still are you all
[27:51] hearing that or is that just me you're
[27:54] working on it all right you're gonna get
[27:55] it all right
[27:56] I got great confidence in that group of
[27:59] men back there that are yes my goodness
[28:04] it is a long way from Wichita to here in
[28:07] case y'all have have never traveled our
[28:10] way it's certainly we met we did it in a
[28:13] few stages we I know many of you will
[28:17] remember us from last time but we were
[28:19] entering very nearly and in November
[28:22] we'll be entering into our 40th year of
[28:24] ministry of this message we began in
[28:28] November of 1979 and by the grace of the
[28:31] Lord we need look no where else since
[28:33] all right I don't know anything outside
[28:36] this message that what I do know of it
[28:40] I'm not interested in it it holds no
[28:43] attraction I wake up every morning
[28:46] looking in my Bible and looking into the
[28:49] word and and standing there like Peter
[28:51] did I just ain't got nowhere else to
[28:54] drive to whom else can we go because
[28:58] this is the words of eternal life I know
[29:01] lots of distractions along the way
[29:04] people have gotten distracted and and
[29:06] gotten weary and tired you know that
[29:09] there's no other way to say it after 39
[29:11] years now on the road and in the
[29:15] ministry and going from church to church
[29:16] and and group the group there's no other
[29:19] way to describe it other than we're just
[29:21] all tired we are tired we we never
[29:25] thought when we started the journey that
[29:27] we'd still be here now and we can say
[29:30] that candidly and very very truthfully
[29:33] we never imagined that's right I
[29:35] remember I remember I was born and
[29:38] raised in West Tennessee place called
[29:40] Nutbush Nutbush Tennessee any of y'all
[29:43] that ever heard any music before you
[29:45] came to the Lord know that that's the
[29:48] same little community where Tina Turner
[29:50] was born in fact my dad my family we
[29:54] farmed cotton growing up through the
[29:55] years here and we had a farm off of
[29:57] highway 19
[29:58] which I don't recommend you go home and
[30:00] even hear that song because other than
[30:02] it's about where I was born from it
[30:04] ain't nothing to listen to but she
[30:08] mentioned highway 19 which we lived
[30:10] right on the highway we had a farm went
[30:12] way back to a point in the field and
[30:14] then our young days while it was still
[30:16] there before it fell in and rotted we
[30:19] could see the house that she was born in
[30:20] there so that I tell everybody where I
[30:25] go me and her the only famous people got
[30:27] out of there so the rest of them are
[30:30] still there so but that's where I was
[30:34] born and raised and began my ministry
[30:38] there in a little little Church in the
[30:40] cotton patches in that bush so the Lord
[30:42] has been good to keep us in and let us
[30:45] continue in this room there there is
[30:49] there is there is somebody let me just
[30:52] just say this from the beginning
[30:53] somebody is going to fulfill 1st
[30:57] Thessalonians 4 see right somebody's
[31:00] gonna do it that's right it ain't got to
[31:02] be me come on it ain't even got to be
[31:05] you we trusting by grace it is you all
[31:07] right but the scripture tells us that
[31:09] somebody will be alive and remaining to
[31:14] the to the change of the body somebody
[31:16] is going to do this right I believe by
[31:19] the grace of God that I'm a part of that
[31:21] yeah but if you here some day that
[31:23] brother tom has met his demise and
[31:26] that's not my portion then I'm gonna be
[31:28] the second half of that verse because
[31:31] whoever is fulfilling that first half
[31:33] will not prevent or hinder them which
[31:36] are asleep I know we get all sorrowful
[31:39] when we lose somebody or a loved one or
[31:41] a friend or a member of the church goes
[31:43] on and and on the natural side it is
[31:47] very sorrowful but these people that
[31:49] that died in the faith they've already
[31:51] punched their ticket and they are
[31:53] included in that verse he got Paul
[31:56] didn't leave nobody out there's gonna be
[31:58] somebody alive and remaining there's
[32:00] going to be somebody who will not be
[32:03] hindered
[32:03] we will not hinder than what you are
[32:06] asleep we shall be all change
[32:09] changed in the moment in the twinkling
[32:11] of an eye yeah amen and amen I believe
[32:14] that with all my heart we're gonna begin
[32:17] a little a little lesson tonight again I
[32:20] knew the to bill for a little bigger
[32:23] platform on Sunday I wanted to talk
[32:25] about overcoming overcoming yeah I know
[32:28] we bring it all back to the natural
[32:30] every time and I've been preaching a
[32:33] long time I've heard a lot of preachers
[32:34] preach about overcoming one of my
[32:37] favorite messages of brother Branham is
[32:38] how can I overcome yeah I mean I think
[32:42] I've grown up with that as being one of
[32:44] my they're one of those benchmarks of a
[32:48] lesson that will help me along the
[32:50] journey how can I overcome I'm gonna
[32:54] read a couple of quotes out of it
[32:55] tonight but if I can give you the the
[32:58] cliff notes the little short version of
[33:01] how can I overcome you know what the end
[33:02] result was basically you can't okay yeah
[33:09] basically you cannot he can overcome it
[33:15] that's that's what the Prophet was
[33:17] trying to teach us all along he said we
[33:20] can run around the earth and we pluck
[33:23] peacock feathers in a crow all we want
[33:25] to but he's still gonna be a crow yes
[33:27] but God who is rich in mercy who thought
[33:33] of us before placed our names on that
[33:36] book before the foundation of the world
[33:38] he can overcome yes how can I overcome
[33:44] I believe we're living in a time always
[33:48] when I leave on a trip and I've already
[33:50] visited one church there Memphis on the
[33:52] way down and now I'm here with you all
[33:54] and we'll finish our journey back up
[33:56] back up towards home but I always try
[33:59] the Lord seems to always give me a
[34:01] little a little area that that builds a
[34:04] little theme for the whole little little
[34:07] missionary journey or evangelistic trip
[34:09] that I'm on and this quote out of
[34:11] stature of a perfect man you know a lot
[34:15] of people don't believe in preachers no
[34:16] more a lot of people don't believe in
[34:20] ministry anymore
[34:23] but I believe ministry is here Laurie
[34:26] not to know only to not you know in
[34:31] spite of themselves help the people
[34:35] towards that perfection that God is
[34:37] brand soon right listen what brother
[34:40] have said in Statue of a perfect man God
[34:43] wants to be worshipped the word God
[34:45] means object of worship it's God trying
[34:50] to condition his people listen now it's
[34:54] God trying to condition his people so he
[34:58] can get from them what he created them
[35:02] for that's what God is doing through
[35:07] ministry right through the through this
[35:10] message he is conditioning his people
[35:12] right to get from them what he created
[35:16] them for he never made you to be
[35:20] something else besides a son and
[35:22] daughter of God if you have missed that
[35:25] of being son and daughter of God you've
[35:28] missed the mark
[35:30] are you with me that's what God is doing
[35:34] and I believe every little every little
[35:36] journey on the road every little you
[35:39] know after 39 years four years of being
[35:42] in the ministry and then hundreds of
[35:44] different churches and and hundreds of
[35:46] different congregations I know you're
[35:48] gonna look around here in West Palm
[35:50] Beach they were very big well you're a
[35:51] big church compared to some of them I go
[35:53] to be encouraged be encouraged is a big
[35:59] crowd here tonight and sitting beside
[36:04] you is the spirit section you know what
[36:05] all these empty benches are that's the
[36:08] spirit section that's for all those
[36:09] people that'll tell you next week well I
[36:11] wasn't there but I was with you in
[36:12] spirit so that's that's right where
[36:18] they're at right there by that that's
[36:21] the spirit section there's something but
[36:24] overcoming is it's it's it's God
[36:28] conditioning his people you know very if
[36:32] brother branham ever makes a very plain
[36:34] flat statement
[36:36] you can believe it's going to happen if
[36:40] you know I know we pick out we pick out
[36:44] our favorites you know quotes are like
[36:46] you know I don't know which ones my
[36:48] favorite is it's like a pastor we used
[36:51] to have up there Fort Walton Beach
[36:52] brother Brown he was got to be an old
[36:54] man he loved ice cream he said you know
[36:56] he said reading quotes and reading the
[36:59] scriptures like eating ice cream though
[37:00] your favorite one is the one that you're
[37:02] having right now he said it's hard to
[37:06] pick out a better one than that but
[37:08] brother Brandon makes a statement about
[37:10] the Laodicean Church age the Laodicean
[37:13] Church age and this isn't out of how can
[37:15] I overcome here's what he said Laodicea
[37:19] that's the last church age there's going
[37:22] are you with me now this is much like
[37:24] all declare in 1st Thessalonians 4
[37:27] brother Branham is making a statement
[37:29] there's going to be some overcomers in
[37:32] there there's going to be it don't
[37:37] matter to me who fails doesn't make the
[37:42] mark flounders runs here and there gives
[37:47] up restarts gives up restarts none of
[37:50] that matters there's going to be some
[37:54] over comers in there there's going to be
[37:58] by the grace of God I'm going to be one
[38:01] of them always we relegate overcoming to
[38:07] to control controlling our ourselves and
[38:11] certainly there's value in that there's
[38:13] certainly value in a daily overcoming
[38:16] walk as a Christian we never want to get
[38:19] to the place or doesn't matter what I do
[38:21] well it doesn't matter what you do yeah
[38:23] a truly born again son and daughter of
[38:27] God conducts themselves like a truly
[38:29] born again son and daughter's life we
[38:33] don't want to ever get to the place that
[38:34] God is doing it all right are you with
[38:38] me but yet in ourselves we know there
[38:40] ain't nothing we can't do that's what
[38:42] we're going to talk about overcoming
[38:43] that's one of those great paradoxes of
[38:46] life is that we cannot
[38:48] overcome unless he overcomes in US are
[38:53] you with me because we can go out and we
[38:56] can reform ourselves we can work
[38:58] ourselves we can we can't we can we can
[39:01] keep under subjection the body we can do
[39:04] all of those things that Paul in the
[39:05] scripture exhorts us to do but to truly
[39:09] overcome now brother Branham gives us a
[39:11] definition of overcome right out of the
[39:14] message how can I overcome Jesus told us
[39:17] how to do it talking about overcoming
[39:21] overcome means to stand the test you
[39:25] remember that quote overcome means to
[39:28] stand the test overcome means to
[39:32] recognize the devil in every one of his
[39:35] tricks
[39:36] lots of people says there's no devil
[39:39] it's just a thought
[39:40] don't you believe that right don't you
[39:43] believe that no more than God is just a
[39:45] thought no more than God is just a
[39:49] spirit being an imaginary something out
[39:52] there that we that we think that's why
[39:55] we come and and certainly here in West
[39:58] Palm y'all are a little more expressive
[39:59] than some of our other churches that I
[40:01] know I'm not expecting you to win the
[40:05] the quiet award from four places that I
[40:09] go I wanted to come out because when I
[40:12] tuned in to brother Jack he's all over
[40:14] the place I saw him doing something week
[40:17] or two ago I don't know what that was
[40:18] okay I didn't know what he was doing I I
[40:24] got to go back and watch it again
[40:25] because because it was a move that I
[40:28] don't have if I preach like him I'd be
[40:35] nothing but a you'd have to pick up the
[40:37] fragments in a basket like they did over
[40:40] there when Jesus broke the bread I just
[40:42] just break into pieces I asked the
[40:45] brothers about a lapel mic hey they only
[40:47] have one because he runs around
[40:49] [Laughter]
[40:55] but that's that this area of overcoming
[40:58] it's a tremendous promise there will be
[41:03] some over comers in there the devil the
[41:08] Prophet told us the devil wants to throw
[41:11] up every scarecrow we can along the way
[41:14] everybody that stumbled fell didn't make
[41:18] the mark lost the faith had a crisis of
[41:21] faith all these different definitions
[41:23] that they've given about this message
[41:25] those who've walked away and stumbled
[41:28] and fell and and the enemy wants to
[41:30] throw those up we'll see he couldn't he
[41:31] could none of us can let me tell you
[41:35] brothers and sisters five seconds out
[41:37] from behind the Grace and the blood of
[41:39] this word that has come in our day and
[41:41] every one of us fall there is no
[41:45] strength in us to hold ourselves how can
[41:47] i overcome the prophet basically put it
[41:50] in simple terms you can't he overcomes
[41:53] and we're going to see that in the
[41:55] scripture in just a few minutes he
[41:57] overcomes in you now brother Graham
[42:00] talking about the Laodicea it's the
[42:02] grandest stage of all ages but as yet he
[42:06] says it's the greatest sinful age that
[42:09] ever was yeah we live in a very
[42:12] precarious our thee those thousand
[42:15] thousand demons that was released out of
[42:17] the river Euphrates were released in our
[42:19] day the Prophet went into teaching to
[42:22] let us know that he looked back to the
[42:24] scripture and he said he said and I'll
[42:27] tell you when it happened my dear
[42:28] brothers and sisters was that the
[42:30] opening of those seals when that word
[42:32] came open to its fullness when that when
[42:35] that expression of what God has all the
[42:37] secrets that God has always wanted his
[42:40] church to know was revealed to us and at
[42:43] that same time that great onslaught of
[42:46] the enemy came as well to where our
[42:49] prophet made statements like the lid has
[42:52] come off of hell
[42:54] letting hard for y'all to believe you
[42:57] see it every day and look at the
[42:59] vileness there
[43:00] there are atrocities that happen in our
[43:03] neighbor
[43:03] hoods that we could have never imagined
[43:05] what happened the mother's drowning
[43:08] their children and you look at they
[43:10] that's just the work of the devil
[43:12] the work of the enemy but in this
[43:15] evilest and most sinful age there's
[43:18] going to be some overcomers in there
[43:21] I've been privileged to go and travel
[43:24] like I have for all these years
[43:26] going into churches looking for those
[43:30] overcomers preaching to those over
[43:33] comers I get criticized sometimes will
[43:36] seem like the only thing you're looking
[43:38] for is a broad message well that's what
[43:40] I'm here to preach do it bribe it is a
[43:43] broad message we're living in a
[43:45] different age we're not in a Pentecostal
[43:47] is right we're in a bride age the
[43:51] Prophet labeled it that for us a bride
[43:54] age that you and I are living in and in
[43:59] that age there's going to be some
[44:01] overcomers in there you notice again
[44:04] back to our scripture because I like to
[44:06] to base any quotes we have anything that
[44:09] the Prophet said I like to see it in the
[44:11] word I like to see that that this
[44:14] foundational truth that he is giving us
[44:17] permeates itself in the word and and at
[44:20] the very time the Great Dragon was cast
[44:22] out at the very time the accuser of the
[44:25] Brethren has been defeated the word
[44:29] comes out behind it I heard a loud voice
[44:31] saying now has come now salvation has
[44:35] come now is when the great victory now
[44:39] is when the true overcomers there's been
[44:41] over comers in every age sometimes it
[44:44] get in and the reason I wanted to build
[44:46] a foundation on this tonight is we're
[44:48] gonna we're gonna take on Sunday we're
[44:50] gonna go into the book of Job the great
[44:52] overcomer of his age when brother
[44:55] Branham says the definition of
[44:56] overcoming is to stand the test ain't
[45:00] nobody we can think about greater tested
[45:03] then that prophet Joe and I trust the
[45:07] Lord will help us to look in that but
[45:11] but being an overcomer in Laodicea the
[45:13] Prophet gave us a very foundational
[45:15] truth of the
[45:17] of the progression of the scripture and
[45:19] I went back this afternoon and I did
[45:21] print them all out because I didn't want
[45:23] to miss one the prophet let us know that
[45:26] that that that the the succeeding church
[45:30] age behind each church agent and I know
[45:32] you have the the graphic here you've got
[45:35] Ephesus Smyrna Pergamum Thyatira Sardis
[45:38] Philadelphia and then the Laodicean
[45:40] Church age the Prophet let us know a
[45:43] wonderful truth and each age each church
[45:45] age succeeding that each church age
[45:47] following that not only inherits the
[45:50] promise out of the Book of Revelations
[45:52] for his age but he inherits the all that
[45:55] is in each age before him was a right
[45:59] that's why it's a privilege to live here
[46:01] in 2018 that's why it's a wonderful
[46:05] thing that God looked down in Nutbush
[46:07] Tennessee and said I'm gonna plant you
[46:09] there in this age it is a privilege my
[46:13] dear brothers to live and the greatest
[46:17] the prophesied visit I'll tell you
[46:19] what's the greatest age it's the ending
[46:21] of time it's the ending of all things
[46:24] it's the ushering in of the millennium
[46:26] it's all of these things and that's why
[46:28] I'm privileged to be standing here
[46:31] tonight I know it ain't about how good I
[46:34] preached it or how bad I preached it
[46:35] just to be a part of it you know we all
[46:39] get worried about our above what we do
[46:41] it is we doing enough are we doing
[46:43] already you know everybody brother
[46:45] Graham said that's the biggest trap a
[46:46] man can get into is he'll see a guy with
[46:48] a gift and he'll want to go out and have
[46:50] his gift whatever God has called you to
[46:55] do do it with all your heart if you have
[46:58] a position in the church do that with
[47:00] all your heart if you have no position
[47:02] do it with all your heart again our old
[47:08] pastor there from Fort Walton Beach he
[47:11] used to always talk about our building
[47:12] they had built it there and and when you
[47:15] look at a building you look around you
[47:16] got all the nice plaster and the paint
[47:18] looks good I mean this was getting a
[47:21] little old and tired but but it's just
[47:23] what you got to live with
[47:26] I'm just gonna go on and say it I know
[47:28] he's thinking about I hearing out land
[47:31] this land over here a church can go
[47:33] there a church can go there I heard it
[47:38] all afternoon we're riding around you
[47:40] know this place can can be a church god
[47:44] bless you if that's the way the Lord
[47:45] would lead you nothing wrong with that
[47:48] you know I know I had half of no it's
[47:51] too late too late to be building another
[47:54] church it's too late you know you know
[47:57] how the Prophet broke that down he said
[48:00] if you were hello he got no money for
[48:03] that
[48:03] I'll let me give you another quote he
[48:05] says what goods are gonna do you to keep
[48:07] your money in your pocket they're gonna
[48:10] do
[48:10] I could look those up for you if you
[48:13] needed me to but they're there you'll
[48:15] find I've been reading them for 39 years
[48:18] what goods are gonna be in your pocket
[48:20] if got it if he knew he was coming
[48:22] tomorrow all right
[48:24] and it was the will of the people and
[48:26] the land you felt it was the will of the
[48:28] Lord to build a church go ahead and
[48:30] build a church we get into that
[48:33] mentality it's too late but but I don't
[48:35] know why I wanted to get into that other
[48:37] than I kept I know where most of the
[48:39] Lots are that can hold the church now I
[48:44] don't see it's the man's heart he wants
[48:49] to have a building for you I was in this
[48:52] building three years ago and they
[48:54] changed none
[48:55] maybe a little tighter and a little more
[48:57] weary but it's still here but this area
[49:01] of overcoming each church age I quickly
[49:05] went back in and I jotted down each
[49:08] promise you know God is a wonderful
[49:13] heavenly father he wants to give you
[49:15] stuff you know I know we all do what I'm
[49:18] gonna go out and give me a job and I'm
[49:20] gonna earn it you know I used to sit so
[49:22] cars for a long time you know what my
[49:24] wife and I do now to to try to hold hold
[49:27] the creditors away from the door
[49:28] we shot groceries for people I know it's
[49:32] it's it's quite a business in Wichita we
[49:34] we work for a company called instacart I
[49:37] ever drove for a while
[49:39] I still do it a little only when there
[49:41] ain't no groceries to be bought man down
[49:46] here in the south and mover drivers get
[49:47] a bad rap I'm telling you they they're
[49:50] stabbing people burn people I read it in
[49:58] the paper every day Atlanta somebody in
[50:01] Atlantis I didn't I don't carry a knife
[50:04] Oregon so but you know this whole
[50:08] societies messed up I mean it is when we
[50:11] was growing up you know what our parents
[50:13] told us don't get in the car with a
[50:16] stranger and now you know what they do
[50:19] you call a stranger on the phone to come
[50:22] and pick you up and it's not that he's
[50:28] kind enough to come and get you you
[50:30] paying for it now I do get some in my
[50:35] car that lived by the philosophy don't
[50:37] talk to strangers because they're just
[50:38] clammed up in the backseat and won't
[50:41] talk to me but I did overdriving for a
[50:42] while but now we shop groceries for a
[50:44] living there's a company called
[50:45] instacart instacart they they go into
[50:48] the Kroger stores and and we take our
[50:50] telephones I left mine in the office
[50:53] there and you pull up the app and you
[50:54] get a opinion on your phone and it tells
[50:57] you to go in there and get them some
[50:58] peas and some bacon and some bread tells
[51:00] you what flavor they want tells you what
[51:02] size they want and you just show up in
[51:05] the grocery store and haul it into their
[51:06] house and they let me a stranger bring
[51:10] their groceries right into their house
[51:12] how can you imagine it's a strange world
[51:17] we live in but I'm thinking what a
[51:21] privilege what a privilege what a
[51:25] privilege God has given us in that
[51:26] ephesus church age whatever God has
[51:30] given you it is a gift from him I don't
[51:33] matter if you've got a little or a lot
[51:35] everybody thinks it's somehow that
[51:37] matters to God somehow somebody some
[51:40] people think that that you know these
[51:42] prosperity preachers I hear them out
[51:44] there and it's all about prosperity
[51:46] prosperity so the seed plant the seed
[51:49] give me the seed whatever you
[51:52] what-whatever you hear the prosperity
[51:55] guys why is it all the same every one of
[51:58] them bars each other's notes it's all
[52:01] the same prosperity prosperity yeah it
[52:05] don't matter if you got a little or a
[52:06] lot be faithful with what God has given
[52:08] you I got a direct quote for you it's
[52:12] not wrong to make money brother Branham
[52:14] said but don't be jealous of the man
[52:17] that does if God is not the grocery
[52:21] shopping it we're not gonna retire on it
[52:24] we're gonna be millionaires
[52:26] we're gonna keep hauling peas and corn
[52:28] and beans until until something else
[52:30] shows up and we thank the Lord for that
[52:34] he's provided an avenue he's given us a
[52:37] little outlet of something to do between
[52:39] my ministry trips it's the kind of a job
[52:42] that we can do and and and come on a
[52:44] trip like this and be gone three weeks
[52:46] and and set it aside and then pick it
[52:48] back up when we go home it's hard to
[52:51] work for the man and get three weeks off
[52:53] I just giving you brothers that know how
[52:58] do you show up down at your job say I
[53:00] want to go preaching for three weeks
[53:02] I'll I'll see you in November oh that
[53:07] don't work but the Lord has been good to
[53:09] us but the whole point is this if you go
[53:12] to each church age every church age had
[53:15] overcomers God's never lacked for an
[53:20] overcomer now it got thin at times yes
[53:23] sir
[53:24] it got thin let me just read you a quote
[53:26] right out of out of how can I overcome
[53:28] God has always had over comers he's had
[53:32] over comers in every age there's always
[53:35] every time in every age that there's
[53:38] been on the earth God has always had
[53:42] somebody I know y'all like to to respond
[53:46] everybody say somebody God has always
[53:49] had somebody
[53:53] you know what I was looking at I'm
[53:55] looking at somebody I'm looking at
[53:57] somebody over here somebody over there
[54:00] somebody God has always had somebody he
[54:06] could put his hands on as a witness in
[54:09] the earth
[54:10] he's never been without a witness though
[54:13] sometimes just one but he's always had
[54:18] one somebody overcome like the Saints of
[54:23] old and brother branham begins through
[54:25] those next paragraphs it starts around
[54:27] paragraph 73
[54:28] he begins comparing some of these
[54:30] previous ages listen to and I'm getting
[54:33] I'm giving you the cliff notes of it in
[54:34] Noah's time in Noah's time there was
[54:38] eight right over comers right and that's
[54:42] what went in that's right in the days of
[54:45] Daniels time there was four over comers
[54:48] that could stand the test of fire and
[54:52] lion yeah I believe we've got some
[54:54] people today that'll stand that test and
[54:56] I believe when that pressure and that
[54:59] squeeze comes on that the Prophet told
[55:01] us was coming I know it gets it gets
[55:04] lean and ugly here sometimes even in the
[55:07] life that we're living in but I cannot
[55:09] go back and read all those quotes that
[55:11] brother Branham left us I know people
[55:14] are preaching we're already in the
[55:15] squeeze my mind has been squeezed
[55:17] building rather than me talking about
[55:18] your mind he's talking about when they
[55:22] when we're meeting in homes and bins and
[55:25] caves of the earth and and trying to
[55:27] still have a meeting when they're when
[55:28] that little hunted and persecuted group
[55:30] I hunted yet I ain't persecuted yet I
[55:34] know everybody you know we get a tiny
[55:37] little taste of persecution we just
[55:39] crumble up go in the fetal position just
[55:41] like we'd see nothing yet it's coming my
[55:45] dear brothers and sisters in the days of
[55:48] Daniels time there was four over comers
[55:50] in the days of lot Jesus referred to it
[55:53] there was only three that overcome lot
[55:56] and his two daughters not even his wife
[55:58] didn't overcome you know Israel started
[56:02] out this is paragraph 84 they started
[56:04] out
[56:04] to me and strong and ended up with how
[56:07] many two million to two we got a great
[56:13] message out of that of year to later one
[56:15] in a million one in a million I looked
[56:18] up the population of Palm Beach County
[56:20] I wanted to see how big our crowd was
[56:23] gonna be tonight we go we're doing
[56:27] pretty good by those ratios one point
[56:30] four four million people in Palm Beach
[56:32] County you take in Miami and all down at
[56:36] six point seven million that quite the
[56:40] building full I'll tell you why it's not
[56:41] for them it's not for that this message
[56:46] did not come together in the masses it
[56:51] came to hunt and search for his
[56:55] predestinated seed over comers over
[57:01] comers he'll start out to mean strong
[57:03] ended up with two in John the Baptist
[57:06] time I mean remember overcomers were
[57:07] there in John the Baptist time there was
[57:10] found six that had overcome in John's
[57:13] time they had six that was Joseph and
[57:16] Mary Zacharias and Elizabeth Simeon and
[57:19] Anna yeah that's all the overcomers that
[57:22] there were six so so brother Branham is
[57:27] trying to give us a picture of what a
[57:30] true of the the ratio of a true over
[57:34] comer I got intrigued a little while ago
[57:38] talking to thinking about the stature of
[57:40] a perfect man I love preaching on
[57:41] stature of a perfect man that's been
[57:43] many years of my life afraid to touch it
[57:45] because other brothers had messed it up
[57:47] and the thunders people that took it and
[57:49] made this and that out of it and they
[57:51] they painted all can I say something
[57:54] wrong
[57:56] y'all was in those meetings you always
[57:59] in there
[58:00] yeah and they had it all so kind I heard
[58:03] that all my life and so convoluted and
[58:05] and I just left it alone but here
[58:08] recently and in the last year I've I've
[58:10] been privileged to look into that
[58:12] message stature of a perfect man and I
[58:16] and I thought you know was looking at
[58:18] the words of brother Branham throughout
[58:20] that that message and other messages
[58:22] surrounding it
[58:23] we got to realize there was only one
[58:26] truly perfect man that ever walked the
[58:30] earth and that was Christ himself
[58:33] brother Graham said everybody else was
[58:35] flawed except for him now we've had good
[58:38] men powerful men wonderful men wonderful
[58:42] ministries wonderful prophets through
[58:44] the ages but there was only one perfect
[58:47] man and I got to thinking you know about
[58:51] this ratio thing too out of a million or
[58:54] of two million in one in a million and
[58:56] and I got to thinking of how many how
[58:58] many people have lived on this earth
[59:02] think of that you know nobody knows
[59:05] exactly but I would tell the scientists
[59:08] and I went to all the the scholars and
[59:10] those people that that can halfway
[59:12] figure out these things populations
[59:13] through the the millenniums before us
[59:16] and through the decades and and they
[59:18] came up with a figure and it's pretty
[59:20] well a general consensus that that
[59:23] living human beings on this planet since
[59:26] the creation of time is about a hundred
[59:29] and eight billion people and just think
[59:33] of all that effort that man put into it
[59:36] there was one perfect one Wow that came
[59:39] apart from the instrumentality of man it
[59:43] had nothing to do with this sinful flesh
[59:46] it had nothing to do with the
[59:49] procreation or as we got here but there
[59:53] was just a little girl out of wash day
[59:55] one day yeah
[59:56] look marry brother branham called it a
[59:58] blue monday she said it was probably a
[1:00:00] blue monday she was out doing her
[1:00:02] laundry and an angel came you know what
[1:00:07] he said about that that prophecy that
[1:00:09] that a virgin would concede he said that
[1:00:11] prophecy went around and around the
[1:00:13] world
[1:00:14] a man looking for a place to land right
[1:00:19] that's looking for a place to land which
[1:00:24] are alive and remain is looking for a
[1:00:26] place to land this world is looking for
[1:00:29] a place to be in this Laodicean Church
[1:00:33] age and all the evil and mother and
[1:00:35] father in the sin that is around us but
[1:00:39] that prophecy of Isaiah virgin shall
[1:00:41] conceive a winter round and around the
[1:00:42] world looking for a place to land
[1:00:46] people we're trying to help it out
[1:00:48] remember brother Branham said when they
[1:00:50] realize there's probably all the move
[1:00:53] then little Jewish mothers would start
[1:00:55] knitting booties and blankets we're
[1:00:58] gonna be the ones but it wasn't there
[1:01:01] for there it wasn't for them there was a
[1:01:03] chosen vessel and that's why the whole
[1:01:06] prizes of a thinness that we are the
[1:01:09] chosen vessels of the entire this word
[1:01:12] is looking for a place to land a place
[1:01:15] for an over comers promise yes to find
[1:01:18] this way yes in our heart but let's go
[1:01:20] back to each one of those promises
[1:01:22] Ephesus
[1:01:24] keeping in mind the words of our prophet
[1:01:28] every age not only inherits the promise
[1:01:30] of his age but the promise of every age
[1:01:32] before proceeding an emphasis was given
[1:01:35] the promise that overcometh this is in
[1:01:39] verse 7 of chapter 2 revelations I will
[1:01:41] give
[1:01:42] I will give it I will give to eat all
[1:01:45] right of the Tree of Life yes and it's
[1:01:48] almost enough in itself ain't yeah but
[1:01:51] that's just the beginning that's just
[1:01:53] the Ephesus age that's the Ephesian age
[1:01:54] yes first 11 to the smyrnaean age he
[1:01:59] that overcometh shall not be hurt of the
[1:02:01] second death right man you add that to
[1:02:04] eating of the Tree of Life that's a
[1:02:05] pretty good stuff right there that part
[1:02:08] of me an age to him that overcometh will
[1:02:10] I give to eat of the hidden manna yeah
[1:02:12] I'll give him a white stone and in the
[1:02:14] stone a new name written which no man
[1:02:16] knoweth saving he that receiveth that's
[1:02:19] right and all there's lots of truths and
[1:02:21] all of that diet Iron Age even
[1:02:24] overcometh and keepeth my works unto the
[1:02:26] end to him will I give power over the
[1:02:28] nation's a man you'll roll with the rod
[1:02:30] iron as the vessels of a Potter so
[1:02:32] they'll be broken to shivers and I'll
[1:02:36] give him I will give him the morning
[1:02:42] that's our decent age he that overcometh
[1:02:45] the same shall be clothed in white
[1:02:47] raiment and I will not blot out his name
[1:02:51] out of the book of life but I will
[1:02:52] confess his name before my father and
[1:02:55] before his angels
[1:02:58] and get down to this Philadelphia days
[1:03:00] he that overcometh will i make a pillar
[1:03:03] in the temple of my god and he shall go
[1:03:05] no more out i'll write upon him the name
[1:03:07] of my god in the name of the city of my
[1:03:10] god which is New Jerusalem which cometh
[1:03:12] down out of heaven from my god and I
[1:03:15] will write upon him my new name
[1:03:18] I'll get I'm gonna do all this I'm gonna
[1:03:21] we're talking about heated overcoming
[1:03:24] I'm going to provide all of this for him
[1:03:29] already God and to the Laodicean age to
[1:03:32] him that overcometh will I grant to sit
[1:03:34] with me in my throne listen to these
[1:03:37] next words now remember we're going back
[1:03:39] to the whole context of how can I
[1:03:41] overcome he's going to do it yes maybe
[1:03:46] put that verse up my brother verse verse
[1:03:49] 21 of Revelations 3 I think I saw you
[1:03:51] putting scripture up there can you do
[1:03:53] that this is our age now yeah we're
[1:03:58] going to break into what we're trying to
[1:04:00] tell you all along it ain't you that's
[1:04:01] gonna do it right to him that overcometh
[1:04:04] will I grant to sit with me in my throne
[1:04:06] even as I also overcame that Laodicean
[1:04:13] age is going to need to recognize one
[1:04:15] thing that overcoming has also has
[1:04:18] already been provided right
[1:04:22] overcoming is is it is this tantamount
[1:04:26] to recognizing that I also overcame not
[1:04:30] only for myself but I have overcome for
[1:04:32] them and I've set down with my father
[1:04:34] right in his throne hey man oh what an
[1:04:38] age we live in and you go over
[1:04:41] revelations twenty-one and seven and
[1:04:43] you'll find a scripture that certainly
[1:04:46] coordinates with what birth the Prophet
[1:04:48] was telling us revelation 21:7 even
[1:04:51] overcoming what are we gonna get even
[1:04:54] overcometh shall inherit all things all
[1:04:58] right all the things what does the
[1:05:00] scripture tells I'll be is God he'll be
[1:05:02] my son a man that overcomer it is not
[1:05:06] only going to receive the portion for
[1:05:08] his age but he's gonna reach back
[1:05:09] through all those ages and gather each
[1:05:12] of their portions oh you talk about the
[1:05:16] mother lode as come our way you talk
[1:05:19] about people that ought to be happy I
[1:05:22] was listening to brother preach the
[1:05:24] other night up in up in in Sarasota
[1:05:26] there a minister brother you've had him
[1:05:29] here in your church he was reading a
[1:05:31] very good quote on a rising of a sudden
[1:05:32] that light broke upon the earth
[1:05:34] it brought joy I'm here alright all the
[1:05:37] presents of that life running Jack and I
[1:05:40] were discussing some some areas of the
[1:05:42] lights yeah so we've been looking at
[1:05:44] what a wonderful thing that light has
[1:05:46] come yes is he that overcometh shall
[1:05:52] inherit all things saving it all so
[1:05:57] y'all be yelling that in brother Jack
[1:05:58] this because you're afraid it's gonna
[1:06:01] scare me
[1:06:09] tells every succeeding age gets the
[1:06:13] benefits of the ages before the
[1:06:15] overcomers of our day and I'll be as God
[1:06:25] he should be the mother loves all things
[1:06:30] Amen overcomer somebody's gonna do it
[1:06:36] and then somebody I'm somebody you gotta
[1:06:40] believe you're so we we are we're
[1:06:43] proprietors we have been given one of
[1:06:45] the most selfish selfish quotes that we
[1:06:49] have lived with for all these years that
[1:06:51] the Prophet could have left us win
[1:06:54] you'll know what it is if there's only
[1:06:57] one going what kind of a selfish what
[1:07:02] kind of a selfish plan is that if
[1:07:05] there's only one going I'll be them
[1:07:09] what is he trying to tell us that as
[1:07:11] long as you are making your calling and
[1:07:14] election sure right
[1:07:16] the trouble is we've gotten so
[1:07:17] bewildered by that in the in time that
[1:07:20] we're trying to go out and make
[1:07:20] everybody else is calling an election
[1:07:22] shirt
[1:07:23] but the scripture encourages us to make
[1:07:26] our own calling an election sure yes sir
[1:07:28] let me take something about me tonight
[1:07:31] I'm gonna tell you son now you may
[1:07:33] believe that I'm a good fellow and
[1:07:35] brother Jack likes me and I appreciate
[1:07:36] that and I'm glad I'm glad for that but
[1:07:39] let me tell you the core truths about
[1:07:41] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:07:43] all right and that is that I am the only
[1:07:45] one that knows did I have it listen to
[1:07:55] this Pentecostal age this is this
[1:07:56] surrounding this message and I hear
[1:07:59] preaching stuff about the baptism of the
[1:08:00] Holy Ghost and and and I see them get it
[1:08:04] I know this brothers got the Holy Ghost
[1:08:07] cuz I seen him get it
[1:08:09] that's all against the scripture the
[1:08:12] kingdom of heaven cometh by observation
[1:08:18] singing get it brother Graham said
[1:08:21] what'd you see he says those are the
[1:08:22] blessings of God those are those those
[1:08:25] are the revival fires those are the
[1:08:29] emotional outburst I want you to believe
[1:08:36] with me and had confidence in me and you
[1:08:38] and your pastor that he is a spirit
[1:08:41] filled man and I'm gonna have confidence
[1:08:43] in you that you are spirit filled that
[1:08:50] God is gonna work with me because I'm
[1:08:52] the only one that can make my own call
[1:08:54] you know in my young days of being in
[1:08:58] this message I was running run them all

[1:10:51] the word you know I appreciate emotion I
[1:11:01] know the Pentecostal elements they just
[1:11:03] all live with that those few quotes you
[1:11:05] know if you ain't got no emotion you're
[1:11:07] dead
[1:11:07] nothing wrong with being a little
[1:11:09] emotional but it's the word it's just
[1:11:19] just coming on the trips he's brother
[1:11:22] band I guess in leadership in Covina
[1:11:24] California thought the message was
[1:11:26] pretty hard he said I know it's a stern
[1:11:28] cutting message brother but I didn't
[1:11:31] come here and choose a message to the
[1:11:33] people just to try to make them sing and
[1:11:36] shout and holler see most of these
[1:11:41] Pentecostals message churches that are
[1:11:45] living in the glare that Pentecostal
[1:11:46] ain't it's all about yes the singing and
[1:11:50] the shouting and the hollering I've been
[1:11:53] in even meetings where they done the
[1:11:54] same
[1:11:56] I'm interested in your life right man
[1:11:58] yeah I'm a certain of God that's got to
[1:12:01] answer to God the ministry that the Lord
[1:12:03] has given me makes me interested in your
[1:12:06] life your man jesus said follow me my
[1:12:10] god get rid of what you got and follow
[1:12:13] me any man and that's the only way to
[1:12:15] have eternal life I didn't that didn't
[1:12:20] choose a message just to make you sing
[1:12:22] and shout and holler right
[1:12:23] is it wrong to sing and shout in Holland
[1:12:25] it can't be that order yeah y'all ever
[1:12:28] get know I'm not here brother
[1:12:31] we never been ordered and I know we wore
[1:12:38] out the old Pentecostal thing with
[1:12:40] wildfire breaks up there's no wet
[1:12:41] blankets around to put it out it ain't
[1:12:43] gonna matter it's the word hey - the
[1:12:51] teaching of the word you just have
[1:12:53] Pentecost was as
[1:12:55] sooo many of these message churches are
[1:12:57] living in the glare of the Pentecostal
[1:12:58] age yes
[1:13:02] I didn't try to just give them a hot
[1:13:05] mess adjusting and shouting holler we're
[1:13:09] gonna take on Sunday on Sunday we're
[1:13:12] gonna looking at the life of job and and
[1:13:15] and one overcomer one overcomer in that
[1:13:20] age and that was Joe Joe being a prophet
[1:13:27] having an insight into fellowship with
[1:13:32] God that the prophet marveled and wanted
[1:13:37] our fellowship to be like that will will
[1:13:39] begin to build into that if our musician
[1:13:41] sisters for come it's it's Friday night

[1:14:27] it on the board force just just says
[1:14:31] it's a course and and and just just may
[1:14:35] not be your style of worship but it's
[1:14:37] just a beautiful beautiful little course
[1:14:39] I do that wherever I go I pick songs
[1:14:42] that people don't know
[1:14:50] I appreciate me what I believe are true
[1:14:55] overcomers amen like I said I can't
[1:14:58] convince you I'm gonna I'm one I know my
[1:15:01] life tries to speak of a true believer
[1:15:03] your life tries to speak with true
[1:15:05] believers but when the testing comes
[1:15:08] it'll be him that overcomes it that
[1:15:13] overcomes God trying to condition his
[1:15:15] people so he can get from them get from
[1:15:20] them what he created him for he never
[1:15:24] made you to be something besides the Son
[1:15:26] and the daughter of God he's talking to
[1:15:30] believers now talking to the elect not
[1:15:32] talking to the world out there he did
[1:15:34] make them to be something else so many
[1:15:37] people struggle with that they look at
[1:15:38] those those quotes of brother Branham
[1:15:40] when he tried to define election for us
[1:15:42] he makes a very horrific statements by
[1:15:46] their standards all these that have
[1:15:47] walked away and criticized when the

[1:37:53] hand a phrase
[1:37:59] I believe is a finish and there's
[1:38:05] nothing Satan can do that can stop us
[1:38:08] a man from achieving what God has
[1:38:10] already ordained us to do this reminded
[1:38:14] a man of the statement that I heard a
[1:38:17] few weeks ago brother Isaiah Brooks was
[1:38:20] just talking about how the Lord allowed
[1:38:22] the Prophet to go beyond the curtain of
[1:38:24] time as he was there you know and angels
[1:38:29] are showing them all the people he's
[1:38:31] like are these brands like no no no no
[1:38:32] no random converse to your commerce
[1:38:35] because pause group hears I can't Rufus
[1:38:40] here and he says well you know I've
[1:38:45] reached the same thing Paul preached and
[1:38:46] and if all gonna be judged by wait
[1:38:48] preach to my proof sustained thing all
[1:38:50] three to nine
[1:38:51] by that same thing and said millions
[1:38:54] scream that we're resting on them and
[1:38:58] just a mid fact by God allowing the
[1:39:00] Prophet to go to the other side
[1:39:02] it showed that he was already a little
[1:39:03] bit calmer
[1:39:34] [Music]
[1:40:04] amen to dismissals tonight
[1:40:07] back for our time free on Sunday morning
