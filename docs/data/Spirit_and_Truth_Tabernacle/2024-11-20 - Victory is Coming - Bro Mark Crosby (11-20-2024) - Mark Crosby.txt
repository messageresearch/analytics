back as well we ask all these things in Jesus Christ name we pray amen amen so let's open our Bibles to um Joshua um chapter 10 and we'll read verses 11 through 15 set my [Music] timer perfect say Amen when you get there so very familiar scripture so it says um and it came to pass as they fled from before Israel and were in the going down to Beth horn that the Lord cast down great stones from Heaven upon them unto aeki and they died and they were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of the Israel slew with the sword then spake Joshua to the Lord in the day when the Lord delivered up the amorites before the children of Israel and he said in the sight of Israel son stand thou still upon Gibbon and thou moon in the valley of Aon and the sun Stood Still and the moon stayed until the people had Avenged themselves upon their enemies is not this written in the book of jaser so the sun Stood Still in the midst of the heaven and hasted not to go down about the whole day and there was no day like that before it or after it that the Lord hearkened unto the voice of a man for the Lord fought for Israel and Joshua returned unto all Israel with him unto the camp to gelal you may be seated so um uh the tile of this uh sermon is Victory is coming um so Sunday I didn't know what to preach and um as Abby was singing that song the Lord just gave me inspiration and then after that the lord gave me a scripture and then brother Jonathan actually said this uh talked about the scripture that the lord gave me so it's just really confirmation right there um cuz as a minister we want to make sure that we have the mind of the Lord and I don't want to just be up here and just talking but I want to make sure it's from God so I just love when God just works that way and just gives you confirmations and just speaks to you and so anyways so we we see this uh moment of Israel as uh they were promised the promised land and as we were seeing it um they 40 years they had to withstand because of the name saying of the children of Israel and we see God had had this promise to them and uh we see that uh they needed more light and so we see that victory was coming they didn't know when but they knew victory was coming and Joshua just spoke by inspiration to son stand still and God hearkened unto that and we'll just take we'll take over in this quote right here it's called Stand still and see the salvation of the Lord then one day when the people had been promised a promised land they were fighting a hard battle and Joshua was the head of the battle how many feel they're in a hard battle sometimes during the week during life and we're in the same we got to put yourself in the Bible because we're going through hard times we're living in a hard age but we got to remember who we serve so and the sun was going down and God wanted to show his people who he was so he had the sun to stand still while the Earth moved or stopped or whatever it did until God displayed his power he can make the sun stand still and stand still I'm fixing to do something I want to display my power to a people who was doing exactly that I promised to do them so if you're walking in what exactly God has told you to do you have nothing to fear because God is backing everything in heaven is backing you up because you're following the perfect will of God so I I believe that God is fixing to do something big for our church we see the things he's done already and God just doesn't I believe God is going to do something even more because we're coming closer and closer to the end of the year and we see God just slowly doing things speaking in tongues interpretation we see Sunday school all these things that God is doing and and God is still working we don't serve a dead God we serve a god who's and do something big in our personal lives as well so we got to open our mouth up and just speak sometimes I think a lot of times we're scared to to speak we got to speak things into existence don't don't don't be scared to ask God big things cuz God wants to bless you amen and he he's he's he's in the we're we're in Christmas season but even before that God is an amazing father and knows what you need in each moment of the of of your life and so we got to just we got to speak the word we got to be in the word so we know the word so we can speak speak the word amen amen so let's go to um Genesis 18 and and God wants to show us he's still God just like he showed to the children of Israel he wants to show us the same exact thing it may not be a literal son but you got it's all types and shadows of God can do the same thing in our life too so in Genesis 18:14 says is anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life Sarah shall have a son and I just that nothing's too hard for the Lord I think a lot of times we're scared to ask God certain things but nothing's too hard for the Lord if if I look at this if Abraham could have a kid at 100 years old then what's stopping us from doing things that we want to do in our life cuz God knows we have desires in our hearts he knows we have needs but he's just waiting for us just to bring our strong reasonings as the Bible says see God knows you need something but he's waiting for you to say it out just like a father it's like a a parents sometimes know that they actually they know what you want but they're waiting for you to ask so the same thing is he's waiting for you to ask a certain need maybe you have an unsaved loved one you want maybe you have a Deliverance you need of or Finance or whatever it is don't be scared to speak it out and so let's go to Jeremiah 32 and uh verse1 17 I Lord God behold thou H has made the Heaven and the Earth by thy great power think of this God just by a word spoken to existence made Heaven and Earth so what makes you think it's hard for him to meet a need or to restore something in your life because we're in the season of restoration God God is God has showing us time and time again what restoration is we see people who um who haven't been in church for a long time that God is slowly restoring or has restored them so don't think anything's impossible for you to ask maybe you have a parent or a son or a daughter ask now open up big don't wait until it's too late right right right amen we'll go to adoption uh adoption 1960 and we'll read uh paragraph 61 one day he had needed a little extra time the sun was going down the men couldn't fight very good at night time Joshua the great warrior anointed of God positionally placed I love that how many believe that we're positionally placed tonight amen positionally placed into the land like a feans to the new church possess possessed possessing the land and taking it over so footsteps me possession so if God has given you something you have every right to take it back from the devil because it's your possession because God has given you so what God has given you we have a right to it and don't let the devil take anything that belongs to you he has no right and um taking it over he needed some time so he said Son stand still and she stood still for about 12 hours think about that 12 hours until he took the land see and we go to I have heard but now I see Joshua was in an hour of crisis when the armies was routed and the sun was going down Joshua was a prophet and he knew that if them armies ever had a chance to unite again and come against it he would lose more men so in that hour of crisis when something had to be done there's only one thing if he could keep them from running he'd route them everyone but there wasn't enough light to do it so Joshua Stood Still raised his hands and said Son stand still and moon hang over Allan till get through the battle and the sun Stood Still there they heard Joshua speak and then they seen God with their own eyes in action true so I believe that we know what God is capable of we seen him time and time again we all have testimonies but I think a lot of times we need to take that same faith we had back then and put the faith in the same situation because God is going to move but he's waiting for your faith to match up cuz God isn't going to move if we have unbelief God see I remember at one time when Jesus was walking and he had to go away from this town because there was so much unbelief and so we need to have faith we live in a day and age where Satan is running rampant he's trying to just let's uh our faith but we got to stand up and say I'm taking God at his word even if I don't see the change tomorrow I'm still going to believe as if the change is going to happen right now and so and I I just love just this I just love being here uh you know this this God taking me here to this wonderful church and being now a member of this church I've seen so many wonderful I've never seen speaking in tongues before like that like that live I wish I was there to see it but just seeing God doing things that he's still in a God that restores and I I just love to see things like that because it shows me that if God could do that back in the day in the 1960s and the 50s and 40s he can do the same thing today cuz I was listening to that I missed that sermon and uh when uh when brother Jerry um interpreted it and I was as I was listening to it it remind me just like the tape like you hear somebody speak in tongues you need to hear that voice just this interpreted so I I just love that we serve a God who just didn't stop in the 1960s when the prophet left the scene but we serve a god who's still doing the same things when the messenger died the message didn't stop I'm saying it again when the messenger died the message didn't stop the message is still going on because there's a generation that still needs to hear it and so we got to play our part and and not only know about the message but be the message because if Jesus Christ is living inside of you you are the word because the word is living inside of you amen so um one day um while we're talking another section we talk about David now so one day while King while King Saul um was King Israel needed a victory it looked like there were be no Victory because they saw Goliath they saw this big giant uh the giant they said was like about 9t 9 in which is 10 ft so as Israel was they needed a victory but to them it looked like there was no Victory because they had this big obstacle in their this way this obstacle this man he had armor that probably weighed more than David did himself and this man had was a Warrior from his youth so if we look at the odds they were stacked against Israel but I love that that it isn't how big the person is it doesn't matter because we serve a god who's bigger than anything and so they were in a situ they weren't in a problem but they were in a situation as brother Jonathan said and looked that there was no hope but little did they know God was bringing Victory soon that God was s sending a little Shepherd boy scrawny and so I I just love how God does things because he could have sent some big muscular man but he sent somebody scrawny just like I believe Samson wasn't some bodybuilder but I believe he was some scrawny man too and one day he used a Jawbone to kill hundreds of Philistines cuz if you look logically speaking that Jawbone would have broke in the first instance that it hit somebody in the head but we serve a God who isn't Bound by human physical limitations we serve a God who can do anything that anything that looks impossible he can make it possible so let's take our reading in Samuel uh 1st Samuel verse um 17 so I just love this story of David and Goliath um uh because like I said but once again we got to put oursel in the same shoes as we read the Bible because the these aren't just stories for us just to say oh it's a good story but it's a story for you to look at and see what a what a man like you and I did put faith in God and he overcame because he put faith in God because we know that David physically could not defeat Goliath if he went head-to-head with Goliath he would have been destroyed but because God was with him and he trusted God he had all he needed that was the majority amen so let's go verse three 173 and the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side and Israel stood in a mountain on the other side there was a valley between them and there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines named Goliath of gath so now I want you to listen to the descriptions that they give them whose height was six cubits in the span which is 10 ft almost and he had a helmet of brass upon his head and he was armed with a coat of Mal and the weight of the coat was 5,000 shekel of brass I'm not sure how much that is but that sounds like a lot and he had Greaves of brass upon his legs and a target of brass between his shoulders and the staff of his spear was like a Weaver's beam and his Spear's head weighed 600 shekel of iron and one bearing a Shield went before him and he stood and Cried unto the armies of Israel and said unto them why are you come out to set your battle in Array am I not a Philistine and you the servants to Saul choose you a man for you and let him come down to me if he be able to fight with me and kill me then will be servants but if I Prevail against him and kill him then shall you be our servants and serve us so I I just love when I love how the devil when he he has somebody against a wall he puts these threats out and he says if if you defeat me I I'll serve you but in reality the devil's not going to keep his in barking like brother Jack said he he's just sounding good because he has the upper Advantage because as we read later in the story we see what happens uh the Philistines like you said didn't keep their end of the bargain that they kept fighting Israel so let's keep going if um if he be able to fight with me and kill me then you'll be able to servants but if I Prevail against him and kill him then shall you be our servants and serve us and the Philistines said I defy the armies of Israel this day give me a man that we may fight together when Saul and all the Israel heard these words of the Philistines they were dismayed and greatly afraid now David was a son of that epher of Bethlehem Judea whose name was Jess and he had eight sons and the man went down among them for an old man in the days of Saul and the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to battle and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were ellip the firstborn and next unto him and and the third Shaman and David was the youngest and their eldest followed Saul and then we'll jump down to verse 25 so so I like this right here just to stop right here so Israel was looking at the trial ahead of them like it was an impossible trial to overcome they were looking at the odds but they weren't keeping on their eyes on God because if they looked at their history they could go back and see that that God delivered them from the hands of pharaoh that God opened a Red Sea that God put put plagues upon Egypt that God drowned every Egyptian that was chasing him that God made water come out a rock that God reigned Mana down from heaven that God promised them a land with flowing with milk and honey in fact they were already in the promised land at this time that God promised them grapes all these things that God promised him but yet they were looking at the odds because if they look back in history God defied all the odds because in reality they should have died uh with the Egyptians but that wasn't their end God still had more that was God's chosen people people and so we see they if they went back they could see how Abraham had a kid after 25 years and all these other things they could see but instead they decide to look at the odds but God doesn't look at the odds and how how how how much of a man is better than you but God looks at his perfect will that if God has called Israel to overcome then they're going to overcome no matter what and so I I love how David that he didn't look at Goliath at how big he was but he looked at how big his God was and that's what we got to look at the situation look how big your God is don't look don't look don't look how don't look how big the situation look how big your God is so let's go to um verse 25 and the men of Israel said have you seen this man that has come up surely to defy the Israel he's come up and it shall be that the man who kth the uh him the king will enrich with him great riches and will give him his daughter and to make his father's house free in Israel and David said to the men that stood by him saying what shall be done to the man that kill the Philistine and taketh away the reproach from Israel for who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the Living God so I love how in the midst of an atmosphere of fear and defeat David is creating an atmosphere of Faith because he doesn't care what everybody else is thinks because he remember he's reminding himself what God did for him that if God gave him power to to kill a bear and a lion that this Philistine can cannot stand against the armies of God so I love how when we go in a situation we got to make the atmosphere of Faith because what doubt does is get you to disbelieve God and it gets you to compromise with the word so we got to create an atmosphere of Faith that's what's going to get you through a situation is keeping your eyes on the author and finisher of your faith let's go to verse 27 and the people answered him after this manner saying so shall it be done to the man that kth him and eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men and El's anger was Kindle against David he said why camest thou down hither and with whom thou left left those few sheep in the wilderness I Know Thy pride and the Hess of thy heart for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle so I I feel like there's a little jealousy from his brother because one he got chosen to be king over him and another thing in fact his father actually sent him here so he didn't come on his own but his father actually sent him but in reality we know that God sent him here because because God sent Victory through David God used David to give Israel Victory because God was inside of David amen so um let's go to verse 29 and David said what have have now done is there not a cause and he turned from him to another and spake after that same manner and the people answer him again after the former manner verse 31 and when the words were heard he rehearsed them back to Saul and he sent for him and David said to Saul let no let no man's heart fail thee because of him thy servant will go and fight with the Philistine and Saul said to David thou are not able to go against the Philistine to fight with him for thou are but a youth and he a man um war from his youth so I love how how Saul's pointing that out but I don't see Saul taking the initiative to go fight Goliath he's pointing out him oh you're is are you but what are you doing cuz you just you just standing and cow and fear just like them cuz they said uh I believe the Bible says that uh Saul was Head and Shoulders above Israel it's like we could say about seven foot so Saul wasn't a short man but he was definitely a scared man so let's keep it going and we go to verse 34 and David said unto Saul thy servant kept his father's sheep and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock so I love he's just giving God glory right here he's just testifying what God did and he said I went out after him and smoted him and delivered it out of his mouth and when he arose against me I caught him by his beard and smoted him and slew him thy servant slew both The Lion and the bear I love the r and this uncir circumcised Philistines shall be as one of them seeing Heath defiled the armies of the Living God so we got to say the same thing with our loved ones that that the enemy has no right to have a hold of our loved ones anymore he's going to have to restore a double double he's going to have to and so if David could St in a situation like this because I know if I saw a 10- foot man I'll be I'll be a little scared probably at first but if David could stand in front of a 10-foot man and and when he talked he wasn't just talking to talk he was talking knowing that God was with him and he had confidence that whatever he would do that God would back him up and help him because he could no longer wanted to see uh Goliath defile the armies of the Living God because he was disrespecting him all these things he was cursing them and David is like enough's enough cuz if Saul don't want cuz Saul is a king and a king should be standing up but David was like all right I'll stand up if nobody else is going to stand up so maybe situation that you got to stand up for your loved ones somebody else can't but you got to stand in the Gap brother BR said his we got to stand in the gap for our loved ones apply that token David said moreover the Lord that delivered me out of the Paw of the Lion now of the Paul of the bear he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine and and Saul said un David go and the Lord be with you and Saul armed David with his armor and he put on the helmet of brass upon his head also he armored him with a coat of M and David GED his sword upon his armor and the say to go for he had not proved it and David said unto Saul I cannot go with these things for I have not proved them and and David put them off D um David's like I don't need this this armor I I know God was with me I didn't need armor then and all the armor I need is the armor of God so he had Spiritual armor he didn't need all that armor because that armor didn't do no good but could we see that because if if it did them something good they would have actually uh fought with Goliath but we see David had the courage think about this a lot of time imagine as somebody going in a war and you have no helmet no nothing and no gun that be kind of scary but but David knew that his God would protect him in the front and the back let's keep it going and the Philistine came and Drew near uh sorry he took his staff in his hand and chose him five Stones Jesus stones out of the brook and put them in the shepherd's bag which he had even in a script and his slang was in his hand and he drew near to the Philistine and the Philistines came on and Drew near unto David and the man that bear The Shield went before him and when the Philistines looked about and saw David he disdained him for he was but Youth and Ruddy and a fair countenance and the Philistines said unto David am I a dog that thou mayest come to me with staves and this Philistine curs David by his Gods little did he know when he when he said this statement that he didn't realize that God was with David and so yeah he he may look like he's Ruddy and all these things but if the god of Israel is with you there's nothing that can stop you I don't care what I don't care how many people the devil sends there's nothing that can stop you if God is with you if God is for us then who's against us so I don't care how many trials the devil throws at you I don't care how many um Road Blocks he throws at you God has called us to live an overcoming life God has called us to to Victory we win if you look in the back of the book we win so I don't care what he he puts at you I don't care what he does you're going to make it cuz God said I'm going to make it he says I'm an overcomer he says you're an overcomer so and we're overcoming together we're in a race we're not running against each other we're running against ourselves so we got to fight every day amen where we at now verse verse 43 let's go to um verse 44 now and the Philistines said to David come to me and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air and to the beasts of the field then said David to the Philistines I bet you like right now like Saul and Israel hearing these things they're probably just cowering they're probably like man this dude's about to die like like does he hear what this man saying like he's saying some threats that he I know that he can he can he can do them but David's like uh-uh then David said to the Philistine thou comest to me with a sword and with a spear and with a shield but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts the god of the armies of Israel whom thou Hast defiled so we got to say we got to think say say things like that to the devil we got to say things like to the devil because the devil doesn't fear us but he fears the god inside of us and so if if the god inside of us is living in there then the all the devil is going to have to bow down to Jesus Christ I don't care I don't care if it's the chiefest of the demon if if we're in the presence of God he's going to have to flee he's going to have to the B even brother BR said the weakest Christian on his knees the Devils tremble so it's not our power but it's his power I don't care how much a man has musles that is what going to stop the situation what's going to stop the situation is Jesus Christ himself amen he says that this day will the Lord deliver thee into my hand faith and I will smite thee and take thy head from thee and will give thy carcasses of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fouls of the air to the wild beasts of the earth that all the Earth may know that there is a God in Israel and Goliath is is looking like this this man knows what he's talking about I'm a warrior of I've been a warrior probably longer than he's been alive and Goliath is like this is this is blasphemy and this and this and all the symbol of shall know the Lord sath not with sword and spear for the battle is the Lords so I want us to remember that a lot of times we try to take it in our own hands and we got to remember the battle is the Lord's see don't try to force it down your loved On's throat that they need to serve God but let the Lord fight the battle like brother Jonathan said we're that small little Cog play our part and then God's going to move see see God has to do certain things certain times because if if he has to because a God is not a person who's going to force himself upon a person it's going to be free more agency that person's going to have to to make that choice and and God sometimes we have to wait on actually not sometimes we need to wait on God's perfect timing because all things are going to work out good that's what the Bible says but God's timing is the perfect timing and we don't want to rush just like our timing when we came to God it was at the perfect time it was a perfect time I know I was at a place in my life where I was at a low point and I gave my heart to God and and I had to go and sometimes we got to go through some things for us to see who God really is unfortunately God doesn't want it that way but a lot of times we have to go through these things so we can serve God in our own cuz that's the key cuz God doesn't want robots it's not going it's not going to be robots in heaven we're all going to have our own testimony and people going to be like you in Leo the see and age how' you make it I say CU of God he gave me a testimony and I had to prove it God gave me my own personal testimony he gave you your own personal testimony and uh let's go to verse 48 and it came to pass when the Philistines arose and came and Drew nigh and meet David that David hastened and ran toward the army look at this he ran to a whole Army it didn't say one person but he ran to a whole Army to meet the Philistines and David put his hand in his bag and then a stone and slang it and smok the Philistine in his forehead that the stone sunk into his forehead and he fell upon his face to the Earth so David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone and smoked the Philistine and slew him but there was no sword in the hand of David therefore David ran and uh ran and still bu upon the Philistine and took his sword and Drew it out of the sheath therefore and slew him and went to the philistin and when the Philistines saw their Champion was dead they fled so we see that that the devil he can talk a lot of junk you know he can he can trash talk but when it when it comes when he's defeated he's a sore loser yeah because in reality they said cuz I guarantee you if Goliath would have defeated Israel they would expected them to serve him yeah but but we see that it's the odds were odds were reversed because God was with Israel and the Philistines should know that anytime that you mess with God's people it's going to be it's going to be some consequences cuz there are some consequences because if you look later in in later in Samuel that David I think they they killed his Goliath's brother as well so it's consequences to defiling God's people so let's go to um we'll go to Hebrews 13 in one second actually I'll just say Hebrews 13 but he knew that the so David knew the God he served was more than able to give him over coming power to defeat that giant and God can do the same thing today for us that he can give you overcoming power to to uh overcome any Vice you have in your life or any issue any family Problem whatever it is that God can give you that same overcoming power and when I say that is because you have an overcoming you have you literally have the very Overcomer living inside of you and that's what gives you the power to overcome any and everything and as I said before we're we're in restoration so don't wait until next year to to to claim out for certain things open your mouth up wide now while while God is restoring I believe God will always be restoring until we come but we're living in this age we see right now in our church that God is doing wonderful things and I don't believe we're going to be in the school for long because God's just doing so much and I I see like I think last week I I went to set up and like it feel like every week I come to set up there's more obstacles I got to move out the way so it this looks like God is slowly trying to move us out you know what I'm saying I'm like it's like four was here and here I'm was like man it took it took me like 10 minutes just to move all that stuff and so I just see that God's moving and we're going to have a place soon and I'm not sure what soon is but soon is soon so we got to claim it amen and so like I said before let's go to Hebrews 138 I'll read it so Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever so if Jesus Christ was the same yesterday in David's time in Joshua's time in Moses's time that he's the same God today and I said before that there's going to be red seas in our life and like brother Jonathan said that we got to just walk to that Red Sea with faith and God's going to open it that's why he said it said uh said to Moses why cry but speak and so we got to just walk to the Red Sea and know that if he gave children Israel deliverance and freedom from from their enemies he can do the same thing for us in our with our enemies let's go to Mark 11: 22 through 24 amen so it says so I just love this right here so so this to me Faith is so important to have because God is looking for a Believer who can hold on to him no matter what's going on and Jesus answering saith unto them have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain so I don't care what goliath is there be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and look check this part here and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he sayth shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he sayith therefore I say unto you whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them so and I want to say this Victory came that day for Israel that day and victory is coming soon for you too it could be today it could be tomorrow but I'll tell you Victory is coming soon so let's read a couple quotes this is from Witnesses um 1953 and David said who is this fellow said do you mean to tell me you let that uncircumcised Philistines sent out there to defile the armies of living God can't we uh can't we have somebody to stand there and witness to the powers of God all of them were scared he said I'll go I like that courage I'll go let me fight them let me fight them while he walked up they took him up to Saul and Saul said well that man is a Warrior from his why he's been a Warrior from his youth up and you ain't nothing but a youth look Hallelujah I loved it right here David said look thy servant to Saul the Lord let me kill a bear with a slingshot shot he uh let me take a kid out of a lion's mouth slay him I grabbed him by the whiskers and I took him away from him I'm a witness Hallelujah he had been somewhere he had seen something he had put the power of God to a test and he was a witness how many witnesses here tonight that that's what we need today is some more courage that's right yes sir he said I'm a witness of what I'm talking about Hallelujah that when the church with the Living God needs today is a witness who has been places seen something and knows what they're talking about he said I'm a witness of the power of God a bear went to grab a kid and I killed him he said a lion run and grabbed another I caught him by the whiskers and slayed him and he said uh that the god helped me to kill the bear and the lion he he won't much more give me the uncircumcised philistin into my hands Hallelujah read one more quote here and uh and brother we ain't got time to go through schools and all around this and teach this way that way that time's at hand rise up and what is given take yours let go men and women are dying everywhere he grabbed the ox gold this is shamgar and jumped up there and slew 600 Philistines Hallelujah he was sick and tired of the devil uh the devil being the devil so he he finally stood up and took control and because of God he had the courage to trust God and step out there not to learn to go off and learn how to do it oh God is your teacher Hallelujah the Holy Ghost will back up God's word every time right I ain't got time time to learn about it he just jumped out there and knocked down 600 Philistines his kids stayed that year amen like David he didn't have time to prove that armor he he knew that God was his teacher and God was with him so he didn't have to have this fancy armor he have to go to to military school but he knew that the great General was with him so the same thing with shamard he knew God was with him so he said I'm I know that I'm God's chosen people and my family's not going to starve anymore and he he took that Ox gold and went to town Samson one time when they had him all backed up in the corner he was just a man was standing there he didn't know he didn't have a weapon in his hand or nothing he looked down uh and there laid the Jawbone of a mill he picked up that Jawbone of a Mill and slew a thousand Philistines like I said logically speaking that Jawbone would have bro broke at the first Philistine head but we serve a God who who can defy the Logics defy the physics of this world um what's in your hand he did it after the spirit of God Came Upon him that's right and L ran and roared one time a little old curly-headed shrimp about that big stand and there Seven Locks hanging down like a little and the lion went out and roared and he couldn't do nothing but the spirit of the Lord came upon him and he slew the lion and he took a Jawbone of an ass and killed a thousand men with a Hallelujah it was a spirit of God that came upon him I'm saying here tonight brother if there's any time that the spirit of God ought to fall on the church it's today how many believe that turn turn your trouts up Hallelujah get under the spout so there's any time today God is moving and we're living in the last days and God is moving in your life and in our our our church body life as well and let's go to Matthew 28 let's talk about and I want to talk about one of the greatest victories that mankind has ever had and I'll tell you what it is when when when the uh when the women went when the Mary and all them went into the tomb and it saw it empty because when that tomb was empty that mean that we had the greatest victory that we've ever had in the history of mankind because that victory giving you Victory today now still and so when Jesus died upon the cross and Rose three days later it gave you the overcoming victory over uh hell death and the grave it gave you victory for your loved ones it gave you victory for your personal life it gave you Victory to have more of him inside of you and so I love that greatest victory that you don't no longer have to be a slave to sin no longer a slave to the devil because God bought you with a price he bought you back so you don't have to no longer live underneath the devil's bondage so now you can live Liberty you can you can live a a life of of freedom in Christ Jesus let's go to Matthew uh 28: 4-6 and we'll close after this so verses 4-6 in Matthew 28 verse five actually and the angel answered and said unto them the women fear not for I know that you seek Jesus which was crucified he is not here those are some of the greatest words in the Bible right there because when he was not here that mean he's risen and then when he risen that gave you access to the Holy Ghost it gave you as it gave you access to have him living inside of you that you don't have to depend upon the pastor or depend upon brother Garren but you have him you have access inside of you that you don't have to call the pastor because you have a need but the very need the very uh Jehovah Gyra can provide that need right there that you can depend upon him and I I love that because now I have the comforter living inside me and he can comfort me in my time of need he can give me peace in a situation he can bring me joy in a situation all these things that we have at our finger just because of what happened and read verse 9 and and they as they as and as they um went to tell his disciples behold Jesus met them saying all hail and they came and helped him by the feet and worshiped him then said Jesus unto them Be not Afraid go and tell my brother and they go into Galilee and there shall they see me so I just love that the very thing that see Jesus would he spoke to the disciples about these things but they couldn't see it at that time but when he came their eyes were open and now the same thing when Jesus came to us it opened our eyes our parents told us many times how good Jesus was the pastor told us but until we experienced him for ourself that that we knew that who Jesus was so just in closing let's not let's not end this year lazy let let let's claim victory let let let's March into Victory because God is calling us to be victorious let's March into what God is calling us as he as he uh as he lights the pathway let's walk even it's one step at a time let's walk into that Victory because we're a family we're a body we're a body so we got to work together we got to pray for one another we got to fight for one another because God wants to fall down in a mighty way but we got to make sure we're continuously in one Accord because Unity is something you got to fight for it doesn't happen naturally but you got to fight for it you got to pray for it you got to you got to put forth the effort cuz if we put our effort in that what God is calling us to be then God will fulfill his end of the bargain so just just en closeing we'll just bow our heads dear heavenly father we just thank you for this Precious
