thou art clothed with honor and majesty who covers thyself with light and with with a garment who stretches out the heavens like a curtain who laid the beams of his chambers in the waters who make it who make it the clouds his chariot who walketh upon the wings of the wind who maketh his angels spirits his ministers a flame of fire who laid the foundations of the earth that it should not be removed forever thou coverst it with the deep as with the garment the water stood above the mountains at thy rebuke they fled at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away they go up by the mountains they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou has founded for them thou has set abound that they may not pass over that they turn naughty again to cover the earth he sendeth the springs into the valleys which run among the hills they give drink to every beast of the field the wild asses quench their thirst by them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation which sing among the branches he waters the hills for his chambers the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works he causes the grass to grow for the cattle and the herb for the service of man that he may bring forth food out of the earth and wine that maketh glad the heart of man and all to make his face to shine and bread which strengtheneth man's heart praise the lord that just says that he's mindful that says

appreciate y'all all the specials that went forth amen i want to say praise the lord for them [Applause] i really really appreciate this and um i do want to just give a uh extra appreciation uh i like the way sister tanya got with sister adassa to kind of get that together i really appreciate that that that that's uh that step it into spirit and truth 2.0 and uh so all my all my singers let me just make mention as while we're here amen if if we give our musicians an opportunity uh then we can we can do great things if we just give them an opportunity and um uh so if you just get your songs in early i'm not talking about a day or two early give him a week or so you know give him some time to practice on it and just kind of get it down a little bit but i think we'll be we'll be ready we'll be ready for the next season but we all got to make adjustments amen and a and and the other thing i will tell you since we have younger musicians uh some of y'all some of y'all i know all y'all might not be able to do this but some of y'all may need to just kind of listen to some of the newer groups that are singing they all didn't catch that because that's the music that they listen to and they adapt to it really fast so you have to you know you'll see that uh now all these new groups you have to be careful but but uh but sometimes you can find a little something you can work with amen you might change around a little bit too so uh but uh but just just be mindful of that be mine for that but if you give them some of the old stuff you gotta you know you know uh something that you got you got a recording on amen uh you can they they can help you out but i i just thank the lord i really thank the lord for for what he's getting ready to do and what he's even doing right now amen he is a mighty god he's a mighty god so uh let's let's turn our bibles um i won't take too much time reading i do thank god for all the saints that were able to go up to orlando and be a part of the marriage conference um you know i know that brother brother stacy said he wanted married he wanted divorce he wanted separated he wanted to engage he wanted with oars and widow widowed and widowers uh he wanted everybody that had been in committed relationships and i thought uh i thought that was very unique to ask for that uh and and i'm glad everybody was able to make it just to be a part of it and and and i tell you you know just coming back from there i just really feel like there's so much work to do uh when it comes to um just family relationships and family amen because um you know you got it you got a number of things my uh my sister-in-law was telling me so we need something for single moms yes and me and my wife start talking a little bit on our way back and and there's a few things just kind of hit me you know and and i said okay we have to try to we got to put something together and uh just just deal with family family right so uh god help us amen as we as we get that i told my total brother trust i got to get some things off my plate so i can start focusing on some of these other things see when you when you work yourself out of a job there'll be something else for you to do when you get there y'all all right y'all ain't talking to me amen but but we just we just love the lord we love the lord i'm going to genesis chapter 50. i'm back amen um and our thought from last week and and as i just keep meditating on this there's there's a number of things that i didn't get to last week and then there's more things coming to me so i don't know how long i'm gonna be here but i'ma just preach until god just released me amen that's that's that's my plan uh so i'm reading a scripture that i don't even know if i'm gonna get a chance to explain today but uh nonetheless this is part of my uh just whole thought process so genesis 50 and i'm starting at verse 19. amen glory to god good to see brother calvin also today i know we've been working but i thank god good to have him in the house of the lord um here in genesis uh 50 verse 19 it says joseph said unto them fear not uh for am i in the place of god but as for you you thought evil against me but god meant it unto good to bring the past as it is this day to save much people alive and therefore fear you not i will nourish you i ain't gonna get revenge i will nourish you and your little ones and he comforted them and speak kindly unto them amen the lord as a blessing to the reading of his word let's just bow in a word of prayer father we thank you for the privilege the opportunity we have to come and to worship to exalt you to get our thoughts together lord to um uh hear uh from heaven we trust oh god that the spirit of the lord would take complete control over everything that would happen here today and that you get all the glory and all the honor you know what we need you know what we need so speak to his father from heaven uh on this day and be glorified and magnified in our midst we take every spirit that is against the spirit of god underneath control of the holy ghost even right now so in jesus name we pray amen amen praise the lord you can be seated uh we um also forgot to mention this a couple couple things i need to mention uh this brother smiley is actually in tampa today ministering at the church there in tampa so just keep keep them in prayer um also as we're coming up on the next couple weeks i just need i forgot to mention that um so we'll have service here next next weekend and um uh here in in in this location brother trevor emen thank you brother uh brother trevor eamon will be speaking for us on next sunday and then the following sunday uh brother nathan bryant will be speaking for us and that'll be the sunday of the uh of the wedding weekend but because we're expecting a few more guests that are coming in that weekend we will be moving the service to the uh gymnasium uh so just be prepared for that and if there's any brothers that can help us on that saturday morning i believe it's at nine o'clock i think brother brother quit we'll have to confirm that but at least it's going to be nine o'clock that saturday morning we're going to be helping set up the gym getting it ready for the saturday morning service now i think this is going to be real good uh because i was uh looking forward to kind of giving this gym a trial run because we want to do some meetings amen uh later in the year and you know this is 20 years for us and i believe we should celebrate uh some kind of way this year we should celebrate so uh so we i was just where we're gonna do the meeting what are we doing and let me let me just mention this to you it's it's hard to do your meeting in another church understand it's hard to do that uh so so we need a facility where we can just be okay all right y'all get it so so i was wanting to see what this gym can do for us and um and uh and i'm just believing that we'll we'll get a real good test at it you know on two sundays now so keep that in mind other thing i need to mention is um the week of the wedding is also the week of spring break um and so the school has told us that ain't nobody gonna be there on wednesday night to let y'all in so we can't have church on wednesday night the week of the wet so we'll have church next wednesday but no no the following wednesday two weeks now there will be no service so keep that in mind uh i came here this morning i said lord you got to do something for us you got to do something jesus i mean we we got to get desperate we got to start praying and seeking the lord this is our this is a temporary place it's like moving through the wilderness this is not the promised land this ain't it amen but i believe god got purpose for us being at 3777 i think god got a reason for that so uh but but we're trusting that the lord will just kind of guide us on and i just want to appreciate you all for your continued giving amen you you are sharing in the vision amen of what god has for us and we are going to enjoy amen these uh the great things amen that god has in store praise god all right we want to continue our thought hurt people hurt people amen this is our thought for uh today part two hurt people hurt people um just to again give a little definition to this uh what hurt people when when we give that when we just use that statement hurt people uh we're talking about or when we say hurt people hurt people we're talking about people who have been hurt or damaged in life um and and as i mentioned on last week there's not one person within the sound of my voice that has not experienced hurt in their life amen everybody experiences it and um you know the thing of it is the the key to this is how you respond and how you react to it what you do with your hurt right is what what matters most and uh uh god can take your you know your your hurt and make it a man a beautiful testimony i believe mom was just saying that you know he's making it a masterpiece um you know i was i was sharing just just a part of my own personal testimonial last last last week and um you know just just me going through being raised in a home with a a stepdad who i just he's just dad to me that's that i ain't that he's just dad but i know you know i had a biological father and uh you know um when divorce happens in the family oh god lord i i i this wasn't my plan i got notes over here but but when divorce happens in the family there sometimes the kids may never understand why that occurred uh and and one of the reasons that the kids may never understand is that uh the parents may not choose to really just talk about it and one and one of the reasons that the parents choose is not to talk about is that they don't want the child to grow up with a particular thought process concerning one of the other parents they try to keep it between them you understand that's what parents try to do and and kids why this and why that and you know you got to understand sometimes there are things happen in life that you didn't plan for you weren't looking you weren't expecting this to happen but but it but it does right and uh and i can say that going through this amen just myself going through this in my own family uh my mom never did anything to to bring my father down she never said anything in any way to bring my dad down in any light uh you know and in all actuality you know for me to understand it was later on in my life where i caught uh understanding what what really happened and it was an uncle that had to tell me what really happened right and uh and and i just remember one time we were on our way to to london amen for easter amen going over to be with brother brother gwen and the believers and and we had to go through the detroit airport because when i was a little boy that's where i lived i was born here in west palm but i lived in detroit for about a year and uh and as we were going through the detroit airport mom just was standing by my side and mom made a statement she says you know the last time i i had you in this airport i was running for my life but now i'm running to give life and and as as she's going to to to london and and people are blessed by the songs that she has written you know her son is coming amen with her to preach the gospel and it's just you know it's just a beautiful thing to see how god can turn things around god can make your hurt god can take your hurt and make a great testimony out of it amen it's how it's what you choose to do with it amen if you want to dwell in it you you can choose to do that but i say no i'ma choose to just give god glory in the midst of it just just the mere fact that i was born in sin and shaped and iniquity i could not change amen the way i got here i could i couldn't help i had nothing to do with any of that i couldn't choose the family i couldn't i couldn't choose the circumstance i couldn't choose nothing god allowed it for a reason and what i've learned to do is give god praise in the midst of everything i'm going through can i tell you something i am not broken i'm better hey i'm blessed glory to god that's the way i choose to look at myself i am blessed no matter what i've gone through no matter what i'm gonna go through hey i'm fully persuaded that nothing present nor nothing in the past nor nothing that will come hey hallelujah i'm fully persuaded that these things will not separate me from the love of god which is in christ jesus my lord i'm fully persuaded i'm gonna keep pressing on i'm gonna keep going home i gotta go ahead on the inside glory to god it's how you choose to respond to it glory hallelujah amen amen i know there's many people that's not in church today they they they hurt and some of them some of them uh and some of us are hurt from some of our own decisions we've made bad decisions and we hurt ourselves we've inflicted pain like i mentioned last week what happens is when you get hurt uh if you've ever gotten sick or or ill or anything um typically what happens with a person who gets sick they actually retreat that's very normal if i if i if whether it's a cold uh uh uh if you had you know this this virus uh covet uh they want you to retreat right and you should because it can spread and but but what happens that you isolate i'm talking now amen you isolate and spiritually when people get hurt they begin to isolate they begin to avoid church they begin to avoid amen uh they're there i mean let's look at adam and eve they brought pain on themselves god said don't eat from don't eat from the tree they decided to go against god's word it brought pain on themselves and what happened they began to isolate when it was time for church they couldn't be found i mean here they are i mean god god god expected like okay yeah we gonna go and we're gonna have a good service and and maybe god got a sermon prepared and i just want to talk to my children i want to give them the word today and and when they get to church god found himself there alone so god had to leave church no no no let me let me let me let me let let me you know let let me let you in on a secret it ain't like god don't know where you're at it ain't like he don't know where you at you trying to hide you know well we're here and god like now we did this every day what happened why didn't he let church today what's going on um and he had to leave church say adam and adam that you can hear when his voice when it when when he heard his name being called like oh lord trying to hide adam adam where art thou now remember that question is not a question that god need clarification on god just god is trying to get adam to a spot and i don't even know if adam really got there but he was trying to get out into the spot that when you do wrong when you're hurt when you don't hurt yourself bring your hurt to me adam don't try to fix it yourself don't don't try to mend this thing yourself because you ain't gonna never be able to do that and many people that's watching even the stream trying to fix to hurt themselves you got to bring it to the lord and you know you got to deal with whatever consequence come with it and that's what i don't have to be able to deal with the consequences of self-inflicted hurt hurt people hurt people we're all uh suffering today because of what happened in the garden of eden but but like brother branham said you can't put it all on adam because you're making decisions today that's also against the word of god and and you got to learn how to choose choose life all right let me go on here amen in um in this there's um just a a a um dictionary definition uh hurt is cause of physical pain or injury um it's the cause of physical pain or injury to that's what they say and and they use the example of ow you're hurting me you ever told somebody that you know you hurting me i mean you stop you know that that don't feel good i would how how would you feel if i did the same thing to you i mean that's that's a that's how we respond hurt people hurt people right but but that's what hurt is but it's also uh it also is a cause of mental pain or distress to a person or to their feelings so so so so mental pain to the person or mental pain to their feelings or distress to the person or distressed to their feelings oh my sometimes people avoid saying things because they don't want to hurt your feelings hallelujah right and and in church you know we we have to be able to tell you the truth we can't you know we're not trying to hurt your feelings like like brother sean i love the way he used to say it we're not trying to pick on you in church we're actually trying to pick off you because the devil trying to everything he can to try to get you tricked and and get you falling into some uh some great sin but when you end up missing a rapture we want to make sure you make the rapture but we have to tell you the truth and you know what the truth the truth hurts and i think the reason why the truth hurts because people want to do something against the truth but when you want to yield to the truth then the truth don't hurt as much let's look at amen a few things here i was just kind of thinking in my mind this hurt people hurt people started all the way back in the garden of eden and uh when we when we look at you know just a product of what happened from uh uh from adam and eve amen and actually before adam and eve it was it was even a serpent amen as a product of what happened cain was born from this union of eve in the serpent amen and here you know god has this um you know uh uh uh you know not not that god made them come and and bring an offering this was something that they did out of the kindness of their own heart they wanted to worship god i mean can you imagine adam telling amen the family about who his father was can you imagine adam talking about his daddy right my dad it is and my daddy created this and my daddy created that and and my daddy did this and and my daddy did that and and i remember you know see that animal right there i remember the first time i saw it because my daddy brought the animal to me and he told me to name the animal or i said my daddy is awesome my daddy is mighty my daddy is great ain't nobody like my daddy i can just imagine some of the conversations that were being held and maybe through these conversations i told you my imagination just goes it plays tricks on me so some maybe through uh maybe through some of the conversations these boys begin to develop a man of and wanting to know amen their grandfather in a different way that's a powerful statement right there hallelujah but here you know they just i said we want to bring an offering and we want to worship we want to praise him and here comes cain with his offering fruit of the ground and all this that he done you know they didn't indeed and and then he'll come able with his offering with a bloody lamb and he'd take it and give it to god and and when god sees both offenders say oh my i love what abel just gave me but cain i really don't like that you don't you don't realize came the very thing that i cursed the ground is what i cursed because of what adam did in the garden so you're bringing the very thing a curse back into my presence no i don't like that but if you give me the same thing your brother just gave me i will accept it but it was not in king it was not in cain to be able to just obey the word of god oh lord help us right there it was not in cain to be able to just accept what god said because like i said the truth hurts and this truth that god gave can't hurt him to his core he's like you know what i tell you what you won't take this i got another way to get you to accept mine because it won't be nobody else coming to church when i get done it won't be nobody else coming to church to offer you nothing i'll make sure that you accept mine and came as a hurt person as a hurt person his feelings are hurt that god will not accept his sacrifice his feelings are hurt and her people hurt people so he decides to take his own brother out kill his own brother as a murderer he was a hurt man on the inside see this is what happens even in church we see the same spirit and people today you know they will they will hurt you if they've been hurt they will hurt you if god don't deal with that hurt we see this pattern all the way in scripture way back at the beginning hurt people are hurting people i want to um you know pick up here uh in in the book of uh first samuel i don't know if i wrote that one down but i'll give it to you first samuel 15 is where i want to go to uh we're just going to kind of watch this kind of go through the scripture there there's so many hurt people in scripture that we can see so many hurt people uh this one is going to be the story of saul amen amen saul was a hurt person and remember you can get your feelings hurt and sometimes when you're dealing with that emotional level uh that's what's happening on the inside yeah we all come here to church and we you know glory hallelujah and praising god and everything else but oftentimes you don't know what a person really going through on the inside and i'm going to tell you another thing sometimes you don't know why amen a person does things on the outside oh lord can i can i can i can i'm just i'm gonna just you know just talk a little bit i'm going to the scripture but you know um i was just thinking this you know sometimes sisters fight uh with um certain things you know of the world you know maybe with um they might fight with makeup they might fight with all these things and i'm gonna tell you some of the sister fight in that way because they husbands have hurt them the husband will not give a compliment the husband will always tell you how much weight you're putting on the husband tell you all you know you this and you dad and you need to look like sister so and so she ain't built like sister so-and-so god didn't desire her to be like sister sarsa and brother you got to learn how to take your tongue and give positive words of affirmation because now she got to feel like she had to compete with somebody else your eye always wondering it's the truth in the eye your eyes get the wandering but god gave you a wife or you ain't got to wander no more and you don't realize you are inflicting hurt same thing sister with your husband you got the you married him praise god you made him for something and i i ain't seen nobody put no gun in your head and make you marry him you mad him for something right so you go you got to tell him how good he looked amen praise praise the lord any high losing hair losing teeth losing everything but you still got to love him oh y'all ain't gonna talk to me yeah young men need to hear these things cause they look at her sister now and they oh boy look at oh boy she got this she got that as life continues to go on she's going to lose those things that she had and you're going to be attracted something more than all that when children come things change and you have to let her know how pretty she look all right now but sister sometimes they get hurt and that's why they go after some of these things because they it's a hurt on the inside they have not been a man told by their husband it's one thing if one man another man out here tell you that but it's a whole nother thing with your husband speaking so another thing when the wife speaks it praise the lord somebody amen amen amen amen oh it's the truth anyhow but this this is how we this how we keep things together and you gotta understand people be dealing with stuff on the inside if you don't if you don't if you don't really minister to the inside you know you you'll you'll never really get them to where where they need to be and you know um i think i told you all last week how brother branham suffered from suicidal thoughts anybody in here that's ever suffered from suicidal thoughts i need you to understand something you ain't by yourself satan has been using that demon for a long time but here's the problem when we when we when we fight with it some must glorify it by telling everybody what we fighting with i don't do that you ain't gonna know everything i'm fighting with you don't need to know everything i'm fighting with because actually as i'm sharing with you now you're gonna fight with it right but but you don't have to go telling everybody what you're fighting with what i find what i find oftentimes when people do that because i've seen this i've seen it i've seen it plenty of times i i've had cousins to do it and i mean it i i you know i just want to let everybody know i'm this well you got to tell us that we we know you got some problems all of us got problems the the question is do you want to be delivered do you want to be set free because just because you tell everybody don't mean you gonna go free because you told everybody you got to take that thing to the ulta and you got to pray through until god set you free from it but here's what i'm going to i want to let you know what i find is that people that release things like this they're hurting on the inside they're hurting on the inside so they have to just release it so other people kind of feel they hurt this is why they do this and like i told you a hurt person always feels like they're the victim you're not the victim you're just having a normal life just like the rest of us you having a normal life just like the rest of us now now look now y'all what you go through might be a little different than what i go through and let me tell you something god knew that you could handle what you're going through that's why he gave it to you and look you might not be able to handle the things i go through that's why god didn't give it to you like that but the things that you're going through god knew you could handle it if you don't believe that go back and read the book of job go back and read the book when job job with job job sitting there a man just mind his own business and there's a conversation that took place in another atmosphere have you considered my servant joe i did but you got this big old hedge around him then ain't no way i'll tell you what i'll take the hedge from around him i'll let you take the hedge around i guarantee he still won't curse me and he'll still worship me all right i'm i'm gonna take you up on this i'm gonna take his i'm gonna take it i'm gonna hit his business i'm gonna hit his body i'm gonna hit his family i'ma hit everything and watch this man gonna curse you no no i guarantee he won't do it go ahead and do it get the only thing you can't do is take his life hey ain't god good i don't know if y'all caught it but what what i'm what i'm here to tell you with all your hurt all your troubles all your trials all your tribulations all your distresses all your pain there is a boundary that has been established by god that satan you can do this but you can't do that and that's why suicide could not take you out because there was a boundary set me all around you safe cannot cross over that boundary it's just like this the the the the waves of the ocean they can only come so far into lane but because god established a boundary they have to go back out into the ocean brother i see satan just creeping up creeping up but when he get here he got to stop glory to god that's why you can worship that's why you can praise no matter what you're going through you know the devil has amen has been has a battle reset for him his demons have a boundary set no further than this no further than this you can take the child you can take the job you can affect the business but that's as far as you go don't touch and even you can give him a sickness but it cannot be a sickness unto death and i'm going to tell you something according to a man um the uh the it was the original bible i forget which language it was uh my uh oh lord have mercy before they brought into the english language right now i can't think of it right now uh aramaic aramaic when when that when they write that scripture about job and him sitting on the ash sheep it said job was actually dealing with cancer cancer was not a disease unto death for job cancer was not i don't care if they said stage four but cancer was not a disease unto death for joe when god has set boundaries god has set boundaries [Applause] you know going through and and even getting so bad till his wife comes to him and says why don't you just curse god and die i mean it's this bad joke this bad because curse curse god and die and he in and even in this difficult state job ain't got no friends to encourage him and now his own wife that's why we got to watch what we say as as spouses his own wife is is coming against him but job even in that moment he says um you talk like a foolish woman now i like the way he put it because he could have said you're a foolish woman but he didn't say that he didn't say you're a foolish woman because job no he married no fool i said that to say this you didn't marry no fool either so don't be calling each other fools you talk like a foolish woman well god gave me this god gave me that god gave me this and now i'm going through i'm just supposed to curse him no no no no no no i mean the lord give the lord take it away blessed be the name of the lord it's your attitude in the midst of what you're going through what's your attitude what's your attitude let's look at uh saul over here first ceremony 15. i i i brought this out a few weeks ago in spirit and truth 2.0 and i'm bringing it back again because it's something we need to be warned of warned of saul was a hurt person because he was rejected as king first he was placed as king and then he was rejected as king and the reason he was rejected is because he couldn't follow the word of god oh hallelujah the reason this man was rejected is because he could not follow the word of god everything that the prophet told him to do he failed to do it so we pick up here in first 15 where you know this is where he rejected word of god and and and what what happened that he was supposed to um wait so many days for the prophet samuel to come and and then they were going to make some sacrifices they're going to do some things and and what what saul says you know i was waiting for you to come but you didn't come in the time that i thought you should come and i saw the people start doing this and start doing that so i figured i'd just take it upon myself to start offering these animals that's what i felt i would do i just take this upon myself so so here you know as as as they're taking it upon themselves as he's taking upon himself then you know he get rebuked now let's look at it first samuel 15. first samuel 15. it says this and samuel said uh have the lord as great delight and burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the lord can i i'm gonna go a little further with this amen uh on this particular uh uh scripture duke is god just satisfied with your tithes and offering or does he want full obedience from you all right i'ma tell you when god got full obedience from you it will be demonstrated in your tithes and offerings and many other areas of your life right but but he says as samuel said have the lord as great delight and burn offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the lord behold to obey my god is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams to obey is better than sacrifice look and look at this verse 23 for rebellion when we when we rebel against the word of god for rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft and stubbornness i i preach and you know sometimes you're preaching people still be stubborn after you preaching stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry because thou has rejected the word of the lord he also he hath also rejected thee from being king i want you to understand when this man gets this this man is is hurt if we were to read on in that scripture i i didn't i didn't pull it up um let me see something here uh we we were oh yeah i think yeah let me just find something here real quick uh what that was uh first sammy 15. uh uh if we'll see that you know he was trying to um uh he was trying to get the uh samuel to count and go along with his sacrifice that he just made and uh and when when samuel kind of rebuked him and and told him that you know he was rejected let me see something here that was first ceremony 15 22. uh i want to just show you one other thing this is a hurt person this is a hurt person right here in the scripture um i don't want to go too far in this so let me just see something here um i won't i'll leave it on i'll just tell you he wanted he wanted he wanted he wanted the approval of the prophet even though he had been rejected and what he decided to do and he's like well just just kind of go along with me on this go along with me he's like no i can't he reached out and somehow tore the prophet's garment hallelujah cause hurt people will hurt people right and he reached out and he just kind of tore the prophet's government and like like look you know what what are you doing he got rebuked even further for what he did like all god wants you to do is repent but he refused to repent let me tell you something this this hurt man this hurt man began to drive not only uh the nation just haywire his leadership tactics oh god help me lord his leadership tactics were just uncontrollable his um uh it got so bad that you know his own son is trying to talk to him about different things and and and and and sad assault is actually throwing javelins at his own son not just that david but he's throwing javelins at his own son sometimes you might go through a situation with your family members maybe your mom might say something or your dad might say someone uncle or auntie or somebody might say something a little sharp at you hey man sometimes you got to understand they're dealing with some internal hurt and the reason is coming out that way against you because amen oftentimes hurt people feel the most comfortable with those that they love the most so they end up hurting the ones that are closest to them hurt people hurt people can i go a little further in a church if the pastor is hurt the ones that are most comfortable the ones that are most amen that he feels the closest to them the ones that's going to get hurt the most by it's going to be his family and it's going to be the church hurt people hurt people let me uh i i want to read about a little man here this is going to be a lengthy quote and i think it's going to be very important i'll come back to first samuel here the saul was hurt then he took it to uh to david now let me just read something hurt people i mean saul's leadership just completely changed after he got hurt i want to read from the message um hebrews chapter six this is a sermon that brother branham preached and um i want you to just kind of stay with me here this this this man that i'm gonna read about was a minister that got hurt this man got hurt and um and because of the hurt you know and can i just be honest there's so many things that could cause a pastor to get hurt often times it's sometimes uh just the way the the the the church handles things the way they do things amen sometimes somebody in the church can do something that could just hurt a pastor and i'm gonna tell you this there's some people that intentionally try to hurt they and it's intentional and and and sometimes you just have to be able to kind of go right through it just don't worry about it just keep pressing on amen let's let's read this about this man it says now if you commit sin here you're gonna pay for it it's just just keep coming in my mind i just got to tell it i've tried to quench it all four or five times i have to say it how how many remembers this brother pastor that used to be over here at the church of god brother right up here what was his name work for vorgin down there the first church of god right here on the corner or used to sell uh uh raleigh's in the time of the depression a real godly saintly man brother smith took his place up there i'll call his name in a few minutes he was a god-saved man remember if you if you don't if you don't if you don't walk up to the correction see we just talk about you know uh obedience is better than the sacrifice if you don't walk up to the correction and you do something wrong as a christian god will warn you god will warn you and then if you don't take the warning he will just take you right off the earth that's what he done god can warn you in a dream god can warn you from the pulpit god can warn you from a little child god can warm you from listening to the radio god can warn you in so many ways a saint just passing by and sharing something that all right how you know that god just using them to give you a warning if you don't take the one it'll just take you right off the earth that's what he done says you remember in the bible look at that corinthians church he told them what they was positionally in christ but he warned warned them of what was going to happen and they corrected themselves got straightened out with god and this little brother he was a wonderful little brother i believe a god saved man and he got him a job down here at war gangs if some of his people sitting here i hope you don't think i i don't know you if you're sitting here but ramsey brother ramsey now how many remembers brother ramsay up here at the church of god sure you do wonderful little man and he used to come to my house this is what brother brandon look at what this man used to do he used to come to my house and we talked together and we sat there and weep and hold one another's hands a real christian that mean they talking about the things of god and and the spirit of god is so so so present that these men are holding hands and crying together this is a genuine experience that this man has had but something has gone wrong in his life and now he's hurt he's hurt he's hurt you know people can come to church for years and and just enjoy the presence of the lord but something happens and they get hurt lord we've got to heal to hurt people god look at this it says one day i went into it down there just come from come uh from overseas in a meeting had my car checked up brother ramsey said what can i do for you billy i said check up brother ramsey change the oil okay he said fine dandy said you have a nice meeting you asking brother branham you have a nice meeting i said oh brother ramsey it was wonderful i said i wish you could go with me sometime why don't you go with me now i want you to just get this i want you to get this imagine the man that used to hold hands with me and we were weeping crying because this president of the lord was so real now he got so tight with me that we can't really talk about nothing when i come into his presence this man is hurt and and what what what's going on now all the man say did you have a nice meeting brother branham no more holding hands and crying and all that this man is hurt and and watch what happens here now watch what happens it says did you have a nice meeting uh it says oh brother brother ramsey i it was wonderful i wish you could go with me sometime why don't you go with me he said i don't i don't serve the lord no more billy now there's a couple of things that i see here first he doesn't backslit and what caused him to backslide is that he's been hurt i want to tell you as many people out there right now the reason that they're there is because they've been hurt on the inside and if god can bring some healing to the inside you'll see it manifested on the outside he says i don't serve the lord no more billy i looked around and said what'd you say he just kind of said i don't serve him no more and walked away i thought oh he's just going on i went on went somewhere come back and got in my car i come up home i begin to think about that i don't serve the lord no more the lord put it on my heart to go back and ask him again so i said meter just hold the fort and i got in and got in my car went back down stopped again went into vorgens i said brother ramsey i want to ask you a question he's not coming to get his car fixed now he's going to try to get this heart fixed he says he says all right billy what is it i said you said a while ago you don't serve the lord no more you were just teasing me wasn't you he said no i said brother ramsey you don't mean that he said yes i said don't you love him he said it he said if i loved him i'd serve him wouldn't i billy walked away i thought say brother ramsey said i don't i don't i don't want to talk no more about it see this was his warning i don't want to talk to him about it says i went home went in the room shut the door oh you know how you feel real heavy like you taking the cookies hey man away from a baby or something you know i thought what it can't be surely something has happened to brother ramsey yes brother ramsay got hurt something happened to him look at it so there's a little colored boy named jimmy they come here to the church got one leg you know he limps kind of i forget i forget his name works down there vorgens runs a a record he met me and he said you know rembrandt said i don't know about this here dr ramsey around here he said i told him the other day i said we all were scared to even open our mouth around here said you was a godly man but said he took his preacher's license and went over to the basket and tore them apart and throw them in the basket said i don't i don't i don't want nothing to do with it no more he said he said hey mister said you ought to do that he said oh jim i'm through serving the lord this man is so hurt look at what he's doing throwing his preacher's license away hurt oh how many preachers out there on the side of the road right now could be used by god but been hurt god got to bring healing to him some threw some of those so he went on and says you don't mean that i said then he told me he's coming down the ground valves on labor day i believe what he said now i want you to come help me jim he said i'll i'll help you after i come from church well first i was going to church said said he went back down and brother ramsey was grinding the valves on his car he said jimmy slip over the river the saloon's just closed here slip over and get me a case of beer he said mr ramsey i have been guilty of many things but never will i be guilty of giving a servant of the lord a case of beer now this man is backsliding a preacher that's backslidden but yet this brother still sees him as a christian oh god just a hurt christian sometimes you got to look at people in their in their despair and and where they are you got to see it you see beyond that circumstance there is hurt there and until god can minister to that hurt they'll never go free look at what they say here never will i be guilty of getting a servant of the lord a case of beer he said no sir i'll never do that he said well go on get it jim he said mr ramsay i grind your vows but if you get any beer you got to get it yourself he said i ain't going to never get a servant of the lord anything like that if that is not a warning to this man and that's something right you think you don't you think you don't backslid on god no no no no look when god is married to you he's married to you ain't nothing you can do to get out of the relationship i love that it says uh i grind your ass but if you get any beer you go get it yourself he said i ain't going to never get a servant or anything like that so ramsay jumped in jimmy's car took over over the river come back half tea'd up with a case of beer drinking it he started going down and got sick see god couldn't speak to him i warned him i've done everything i could brother smith went to him and warned him everybody tried to do everything they could for him still he just shook his head what happened he took sick and died that showed he was a saved man now this is just something that blows my mind when when brother branham says it shows that he was a saved man he says if god could not solutions and things like that that he stopped serving the lord and god had to call home this man was a minister this man was a preacher this man was a leader but leaders can be hurt an unfortunate thing when a leader is hurt it's everybody around them that also gets hurt god hurt people hurt people i know sometimes you preach things like this but it's you know it get right to the core of some some some areas but you know we got to get there uh i believe i believe uh uh uh uh uh john the baptist said we gotta lay the ax at the root of the tree church hurt people hurt people and we need god we need god to bring healing to our heart let me uh just go on a little further i want to show you something i um actually you know let me keep reading this in this quote i want to i want to show you something about this man even though he went through all of this i thank god he was not lost in the midst of all this hurt and and some i got i got people that's listen right now you might think you lost but you're not lost you're right where god wants you to be in the middle of all that hurt he took sick and died that showed he was the same man if god could not make him bring him in obedience he will have to take him off of the earth and bring him home that's exactly what the bible said that's what the bible promises if you won't stand correction you've got to come on home so god cannot lose you after he saved you but he can shorten your days here and and make you pay for every sin you've done so if you sin you're going to have to pay for what you've done just remember that and he goes and says now the lord be with you i believe tonight that brother brother ramsey was saved half teed up sick saying that he don't want to serve god no more but brother adam said he was saved i believe i believe that brother bran he said brother andrew was saved absolutely i believe it but he just wouldn't obey god and when he wasn't when he was when he wouldn't uh obey god god had to bring him home that's the only thing to do because what was it he would bring reproach and disgrace to the blood wherewith he was sanctified with that's right and count the covenant and unholy thing if that isn't just exactly what this hebrew letter said see it would be impossible for him to be lost but he would bring shame and disgrace so so god would have to take him off the earth and bring him home that's exactly what had taken place now may the lord bless while we bow our heads just a moment for prayer i i'm i when i read this quote it just blessed me i know many things that have gone on the glory and before they left it it was so hurt one serving god but i remember just precious moments that we would have together and and i mean you could just see the joy of the lord all over them but some kind of way somewhere down the line they got so hurt that they could not come back into the house of god anymore church i tell you this i hope that we'll create an environment here where hurt people can can come and be healed because everybody's been hurt by something it's not a it's not a one of us in here that don't experience some type of hurt i i i've said this before anybody looking for the perfect church will never find it first thing is is you have to look at yourself in the mirror and say look i'm not perfect and i i realize i can look myself in the mirror and say this i know i'm not perfect as soon as i show up to the church the church ain't perfect no more because i just showed up and you got to look in the mirror and say the same thing the church is not if we're looking for the perfect church we won't find that but we can find a church where healing can happen i want to read a man just a little bit more here i want to go into um another scripture here david running from saul the saul was hurt saul was trying to trying to kill david disappointed that just like just like um um uh uh in the beginning uh cain is disappointed god won't take his sacrifice we find we find the same thing with saul being rejected he he's just disa he's just absolutely he's caused created habit for everybody and and and and i want to just pick up a scripture out of first first samuel 22. i want to just read this just the first couple verses i want her how i heard leader oh god can damage the people this is what happened with um with with underneath saul's reign saul was a hurt man he had been rejected by god because he would not obey god and look at what he did to the people look at what happens here amen in first samuel um uh said first 22 verse 1 amen and first 22 david therefore departed thence and escaped to the cave atlanta and when his brethren and all his father's house heard it they went down did it to him now now uh this this was the time david was actually running from saul he tried to kill him he said look he's going to be laying down sleeping in the bed i want i want my servants to go and kill this guy david and his wife had to let them down out the window and put a rock in the bed and make it make them think it was david he said i don't care if he's sleeping good kill him anyway hurt people want to hurt people well this is the environment that he created in his kingdom so now david's on the run and now he's hit hiding in a cave but look at this verse 2 says this amen verse it says that they went down did the uh to him and everyone that was in distress and everyone that was in debt and everyone that was discontented gathered themselves unto him amen and he became a captain over them and there were with him about 400 men now what happens is that underneath saul's leadership amen because saul is hurt it impacts these people in so many ways they're hurt in their finances oh y'all ain't reading it with me amen they're hurting their spirits amen they're discontented they're in distress these people are hurting so many ways because hurt people hurt people now they're trying to get with david we need we need a different leadership we can't take what has just happened here oh my with what just happened here with saul we just can't take this and we realize even god himself has rejected saul hurt people hurt people i want i want to go further because even though these people coming to david in this condition i need you to understand these people that came to david will hurt people and there's a cycle that happens and it continues to happen hurt people will keep hurting people until god does something on the inside to take care of that hurt we pick him up the same group of people as with david over here in 1st samuel 30. i want to read a man i want to read uh i want to skip ahead in this and then i want to come back i want to skip ahead to something just to show you first samuel 30. let's start at verse 21. i'm sorry let's go verse 18. let's pick this up it says in david we caught recovered all that the amalekites that carried away and david rescued his two wives there was nothing lacking to them neither small nor great neither sons nor daughters neither spoiled nor anything that they had taken to them david recovered all i love it let's keep reading he says um and david took all the flocks and the herb herds which they drained before those other cattle and said this is david spoil and david came to the 200 men which were so faint that they could not follow david whom they had made to al also to abide at the brook bazaar and they went forth to meet david and to meet the people they were that that were with him and when david came near to the people he saluted them look at this then answer all the wicked men see he's the man that was you know distressed these are some of the men that were in debt these are ones that want to follow david because you know they were underneath saul's leadership and and saul just drove them crazy now now now now here they they were david they're all they're happy they just won the battle got all the spoil but before the battle started there were 200 men that were not able to go in battle because they were just too weak hallelujah amen but these other men that went into the battle and got all this spoil you know they turn around and look at what look at how they treating their brothers hurt people oh jesus will hurt people i need you to understand this good god almighty as the lord is developing and growing this church we can't be a group of hurt people we we can't be a group of victims we got to be victors we don't know who god gonna sit here we got to be able to help people through they hurt look at this in verse 20 verse verse 22 so then answer all the wicked men and men and below of those that went with david and said because they went not with us we will not give them all of the spoil that that we have recovered save to every man his wife and his children and that they may lead them away and depart you can take your wife that we got back you can take your children but you ain't taking none of this for y'all just leave these people are willing to split the church oh god they they they happy with splitting the church because y'all didn't want to fight with us but i'm going to tell you something good god almighty if there was anybody that should have been hurt david should have been hurt because he was running from saul like crazy and and i need you to understand god had done something in david to make him a different leader than saul was look at david's response then said david ye shall not do so my brethren with that which the lord hath given us you didn't do this on your own god the one did this for you and you're not gonna take it and be stingy with it oh help me lord jesus says he says uh uh uh uh that that which the lord has given us who hath preserved us and delivered the company that came against us uh into our hand for who will hearken unto you in this matter but as his part is that goeth down to the battle so shall his part be that terrorist by the stuff they shall part a like david's saying we're gonna put no difference in anybody you ain't gonna be looking at this brother funny you ain't gonna be looking at this sister funding we're gonna all embrace what god has done for us and we're gonna celebrate together i know you've been hurt my brother i know you're disappointed that you know they didn't go down with you but it's okay god god did that for a reason now don't take that out on your brothers because they didn't do it let's realize god is the one that blessed us with all this so now we're gonna share because god did this not not you you didn't do this in your own strength god did this david had a heart to bring the people together and i believe that's what the holy spirit is doing through the leadership even through this message it's a heart to bring people together a heart to divide oh the reason i'm doing it because so and so did no no no no no yep yesterday we we heard you know uh brother bear was just taking us through scriptures and you know it's saying how um and i can't remember all the scriptures but one of them was that uh you know you said my enemy did this my name is but jesus said love your enemies so you don't have no justification to do nothing against your enemies love your enemies well you know my neighbor did this my neighbor did that love your neighbor as yourself there is no way out we have to follow the word of god yes i have been hurt yes you been hurt yes we all been hurt but it's how we react and how we respond to the hurt is what matters most can i just go back to david in this same scripture because david shows a different character than the rest of them we're not even listening to you and you trying to divide the church here we're not listening to that who gonna listen to you this is the direction that we going how did david how did david become like this look at in verse 1. same chapter and it came to pass when david and his men would come to ziklag on the third day the amalekites had invaded south and ziglag and schmidt and ziklag and burned it with fire i need you to understand what had happened here is david was so hurt uh running from saul because saul was so hurt that dave was going to be king uh he got he got jealous about them singing the songs about david and everything like that he was so hurt he drove david out david ended up taking his men and joining the philistine army joining the enemy's army the same enemy that he was raised up to slay now he's on their side but as he's going after battle that day the philosopher said we're going to invade israel and they saw israelites come and say no we don't want them because they're going to turn into battle and come against us he says no no no send them back home well david and his men go back home when they get there everything that they had had been raided watch it it came to pass when david and his men were come to ziklag on the third day the malachites had invaded the south and ziklat and smitten ziklag and burned it with fire and had taken the women captive that were that were therein they slew not any either great or small but carried them away and went on their way so david and his men came to the city and behold it was burned with fire and their wives and their sons and their daughters were taken captives then david said and then david and the people that were with with him lifted up their voice and wept until they had no more power to weep they just crying up something look at it now and david's two eyes were taking captives ahead of him and just just uh the jezreelitis and abigail the wife of nabal the carmelite and david was so greatly distressed for the people spake of stoning him i want you to catch that these guys are hurt david we're following you we left saul but now you don't let us into something greater david something worse than what saul did our children are going our wives are gone our families are gone everything we have is gone it's all burned up and you let us out here to this david these guys say you know what now david we tired of you we're going to stone you can you imagine sitting there with all these guys look at what happened here let's look at it in verse six and david was greatly distressed for the people spaking stolen him because the soul of all the people was grieved every man for his son and for his daughters but david oh god that's the thing that got me right there when everybody else done turned against you and i mean david just hurt david hurt by saul now they're hurt by the man that's that's fallen but look at what the bible say about david you're gonna have to have a go ahead you're gonna have to have it on the inside something that tell you keep pressing on like mama's singing a song i'm still still pressing my battle right you're gonna have to have this could the bible say but david did what encouraged himself and the lord his god i i need you to understand sometimes people won't be there to pat you on the back sometimes people might not be there to tell you it's gonna be all right but you're gonna have to have a relationship with god where you can encourage yourself god i see what you promised me here and god i see what you promised me there i know that you won't fail me you brought me this far you didn't bring me this father leave me i know you won't fail you're gonna have to be able to encourage yourself can't sit around talk about the pastor didn't call me this person didn't call me that i mean when i when i look at david when i look at david i just i begin to ask myself a question who who was it who was it that david went to council council with who who was it that he went and talked to he was there by himself amen everybody else was was thinking about stoning him but david had enough on the inside i know you got some inside hurt but do you also have something on the inside that inside go ahead that tell you know i can get over this i can get through this not not not not you know some uh uh uh what that little train they used to teach us about in school hey that little train had a think i can engine and and all the train kept saying as i think i can just taking another turn i think i can you know why and you got to notice that if you think you can then you will you can't be you can't be i think i can't can you be going in reverse i think i can't i think i can't until your engine just come to a stop but you can put i think i can i think i can i think i can i think i can i think i can before you know it you're going in the right direction and that train made it up the hill and as it was going down i did i did i did i i did i did and the next hill you come to you approach it with the same approach god will bring you through you got to have something on the inside it's got to be there a real experience with god that no matter what you ain't taking this from me you might take this you might take that but you ain't taking that experience from it i gotta go ahead on the inside yeah i'm hurt yeah i'm going through yeah yep yep yep yep i still got to go ahead on the inside oh hallelujah thank the songwriter say i steal gotta praise the inside of me amen another summer i said you know the devil may take this don't let them take your praise don't let them take your praise david encouraged himself in the lord and this is why david later on that encouragement even later on carried on when they finally got they recovered all everything a good thing about you might see your stuff burned up but ain't nobody's around i mean they ain't been killed they they still living somewhere we just gotta find where they at and if you just go and read the story you see how god did it there was one man a part of the invading army he got sick he thought he got sick by accident but they said we can't carry him alone we got to just leave him behind and as this man got left behind here come david and his man they see him and and and they they just began to restore him the strength and and got him now he realized he was outnumbered so he began to start talking we uh we invaded this place called ziggler oh is that right keep on talking and as the man kept talking they got all the information from the informant they say now all we need you to do is show us say show us where these men are stationed he said now if i show you do when you're promising that you won't kill me i promise we promise we won't kill you and we won't turn you in this man led them right down to the army look that man was a hurt person that man was a hurt person he was hurt physically but as he began to reveal all the secrets david and his men come down there to the camp and they raided and got everything back i love the way the scripture read it till the bible said they recovered all your hurt all your pain all your discomfort all your debt all your distress huh your family your son your daughter your mama your daddy yo your brother your sister your uncle your auntie hey i know it's been family hurt but you gonna recover oh praise god and you can recover it if you can encourage yourself i ain't gonna lose nothing because this is what god promised me [Music] i got a another script i just want to read and i i'm gonna come to a close i'ma get back to this but since we're in samuel let's go to second samuel 16. second samuel 16. you can see hurt people all through the scripture and sometimes people go through years and years and years of that hurt being on the inside and they never really deal with it they never really deal with it i read a scripture on last week of how um let me just read it to you uh where jesus said it's impossible that offenses will come but one to him through whom they come it would better for him that a millstone were hanging about his neck and he cast him to see then that he should offend one of these little ones take heed he says if thy brother trespass against thee if your brother hurt you your sister hurt you the bible actually say rebuke him but not in the way you think not you just getting giving them a piece of your mind the bible say rebuke him and if he repent forgive him and what what that rebuke him mean is just talk straight with him in love just like you know this is what offended me don't be bouncing all around and going all around no tell him this is what offended me this is what did it talk to him and here's what the bible say here's what the bible said it says um if thy brother trespass against you rebuke him and if he repent then forgive him that means you got to let it go right then you can't now we don't talked about this i i told you i was sorry you said you forgave me and then ten years from now you're gonna bring the same thing back up again no you choose to be hurt you're choosing to be hurt and i'm going to tell you another thing some people just want attention it's a truth in their heart they want attention so they love to hold things over you yeah we already talked about that then they come up with something else no come on now this is a devil you know i ain't tried to do none of this stuff that's a devil trying to bring division let's go over here this scripture lord jesus um [Music] what that second samuel is what i just called out right yes uh ii samuel 16. um this is a man that we're gonna see that he had some stuff on the inside of him and he was just waiting for a certain moment to release it he's a hurt man he's a hurt man and he was just waiting for a moment and he thought he had his moment and boy he let it all fly but the problem is he didn't realize that this was only a moment things was getting ready to reverse see this is why you got to watch how you act in your moments oh y'all ain't with me today you gotta watch how you respond and how you do things in your moment that you think is your moment all it is is a moment because when things change now this man had a target on his back let's read this story here in verse 5 uh second samuel 16 verse 5 says and when king david came to baharim behold thence came out a man of the family of the house of saul remember now saul was replaced by david as king saul was rejected by god now saul is being replaced by david as king and it's not david's doing this is god's doing this is god's doing uh the way the way that god handled this god god did this right so so we we pick up here where we're where david is now king but you know because what happened in david's household uh david's son has risen up and taken over the kingdom from and through david off the throne and now he's taking over the kingdom and now david is on the run watch it it says and when when king david came to bahrain behold thence came out a man of the family of the house of saul whose name was shimaya the son of gira he came forth and cursed still as it came and he cast stones at david that'll be one thing and then all the servants of king david so this man picking up every rock that he can find oh y'all y'all let me i'm i'ma break it down for you so you understand what's really going on sometimes just because you are associated with spirit and truth tabernacle people will throw rocks at you and the people that's throwing rocks are this is how you know they hurt by their actions these are hurt people and sometimes it's not i mean and sometimes you get them to talk to try to find out what the hurt really all about they ain't got nothing to base it on it's just a devil it's just a devil look at this look at it it says he cast stones that david and all the servants of king david and all the people and all the mighty men were on his on his right hand and on his left and thus said shem yah when he cursed come out come out thy bloody man and thou man of allow he calling david pretty much a devil god the one gave david the kingdom he's the devil now man of belial the lord look at he's not gonna use scripture on them though as soon as oh my i wonder how many folks are criticizing us now because we in the school i i wonder how many got something to say now because we're in the school it's just a moment the lord hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of saul and whose dead thou has reigned see you shouldn't even been king saul should have still been king this man was a relative of saul taking up a saul saul was rejected because he failed to obey the word of god they had nothing to do with david it it's better to obey than the sacrifice saul look at it verse 8 again the lord have returned upon thee all the blood of the house of saul and who stayed thou has reign and the lord have delivered the kingdom into the hand of absalom my son and behold thou art taken in thy mystery because thou art a bloody man now he's right david was considered a bloody man this is why he couldn't build a temple he's right about that some things he's right about but this ain't why i'm being cast off the throne this ain't why verse 9 says then said abishai the son of zarai unto the king why should this dead dog curse my lord the king let me go over i pray thee and take off his head and just it's just you know it's something that you know the the insults were not coming to this guy um abishai that's not what the insults are hurl the insults are going towards david but abhishek is offended at the insults and he wants to go and take care of it david he won't he won't say another word if you just give me permission i love the way that they do this i love that you know sometimes they would be respectful and just watch how the leadership come handle it rather than just try to take care of it on your own amen sometime you have to watch how the leadership is going to handle it rather than take care of it on your own look at this i'm almost there oh my verse verse verse 10 and the king said what have i to do with you ye sons of zariah so let him curse because the lord hath said unto him curse david god gave this man permission just like god gave the devil permission to attack job god has given this man permission to curse david can i tell you another thing god has given some people permission to hurt you how are you going to respond when god has given them permission how are you going to respond god allowed this to happen permission has been given look at this look at this it says he says and the king said what have i to do with you you sons of zariah so let him curse because the lord hath said unto him curse david who shall they who shall they who shall then say wherefore hast thou done so and david said to have a shy and all and to all the servants behold my son which came forth of my bible seeketh my life how much more now may this vengeance might do it he said look i'm i'm hurt enough my own son rose up against me but god protected me from him do you think this benjamin gonna be able to take me this mad man gonna be able to take him brother brandon say he was crippled in the spirit you think you're gonna be able to take me out no i i don't care what people have done to you they can't take you out there's a boundary there he says let him alone and let him curse for the lord hath bitten him i i just love the way david writes it may be that the lord will look on mine affliction and that the lord will requite me good for his cursing this day god watching my attitude and he might bless me if i have the right attitude and as david and his men went by the way shimmy i went along on the hillside over against him and cursed as he went and threw stones at him and cast dust and the king and all the people that were with him came weary and refreshed themselves there i just love this because david had the right attitude this man has cursed him said just let him curse god allowed it god allowed it all right don't worry about it yes this man has hurt me like he kept calling me they say sticks and stones i hurt my bones but names may never hurt me and some there's a truth and there's also not a truth there cause sometimes names can't hurt you david is being hurt by this man but he refuses to respond in a manner amen that you would expect him to respond later on we don't got we don't have time to read it but let just let me just finish it by telling you telling you god brought david back to the throne the same way david went out david came back in and you know who was there to meet him as he was coming back in this same guy that was casting rocks and throwing rocking oh oh the lord has blessed you bring you back home now oh glory to god oh please i lost my mind when i said them things and i'm sorry david please forgive me see god know how to make your enemies your footstool they would say yeah it's all good you gotta worry about me i ain't gonna take your life not me i ain't gonna do nothing but then he had a secret meeting with one of his sons this son solomon solomon you remember that guy shame when i'm gone when i'm off the scene watch him watch them solomon here david passes away and solomon's on the throne and chamele comes with solomon saw them say look now you know what uh i remember what you did my dad and i says but uh but here's here's the deal you'll have um you have protection as long as you stay here don't ever leave here you got protection if you stay here i'm good with that so man i'm good with that but one day chamele had two slaves jump up saying man we running for our life his property took our run and and she may have found out where they was i'm going down to get my property went down there got them slaves brought them back as soon as he got him backstage i told you i was going to restore my property and after he got his property restored had a knock on the door king solomon want to see you king solomon c uh uh yes sure i'll go see king solomon so now she made the the agreement was is that as long as you stayed here you had protection well well not king let me explain you know this was my property they they took up they should never ring you know you know what that slave's not supposed to do that say yeah yeah i understand what slaves are not supposed to do yeah they broke the law but you also broke the law and i told you you're supposed to stay right here come take his head off he lost his life because he did not obey see obedience is better than the sacrifice and and no matter what we're doing no matter what we've gone through we still want to obey the word of god don't use your hurt as your crutch to allow you to do things that's against the word of god because hurt people will continue to hurt people we want to see that cycle stop and let it stop with us yes we all been hurt but let god be glorified in the midst of all our hurt let's pray lord jesus uh how grateful we are for your word how grateful we are for your truth react so god that you would just uh lord deal with the the things that we're going through on the inside things that nobody else knows about but you know about it god we're asking that you would bring healing to hurt the you would set us free god that amen that generations won't be impacted by the things that we've gone through that we would approach it with a sound mind and and follow scripture scriptural principles that we're not used we wouldn't use our hurt as a crutch to justify some of our actions but may we use the hurt to bring glory and honor to you as our king and as our lord you never a man give us more than we can bear and everything that we have gone through and we'll go through it's because you have allowed it and in your uh god just in your your in the way
