West Palm Beach it's been a long time about 6 years maybe since I was last here and we had one child and he was a baby um but it's good to be here again and it's always nice to come to a church where there's faith and where there's belief that God is the same yesterday today and forever and you know I was I was back there and I was thinking about these songs that are sung and you know I preached a sermon back home home about being an influencer for God right because in this the word influencer is huge this day and age everybody wants to be an influencer and they want to be an influencer of something or someone but we find that the greatest influencer that ever came upon this Earth was Jesus Christ sir and what does an influencer do an influencer influences another to act like them right when you young people older like when we go online and these influencers are there they're trying to influence you to buy their product or to be like them and most of the times it's not a good thing but when Jesus came he came to influence a people a bride to be like him not only to be like him but now he passes that influence onto us that we might influence others so we sang that song lily of the valley let me be more like you and that should be our prayer and I believe that should be the prayer of every believer as an individual and every church it's more than just coming to church it's Lord let me be an influencer for you yes sir amen amen so I want to preach today on to be like Jesus and we're going to turn to Second Peter chapter 1 we're going to read verses 1- 10 second Peter 1: 1-10 to be like Jesus he says Simon Peter a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like Precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ that's us he says Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue and I want to focus on this verse here whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust so notice he's saying we receive precious promises that we might be partakers of the divine nature you know what I believe this message that we have that God sent through a prophet is a precious word that he has sent to us to do more than just have a following to do more than just have churches but that we might be partakers of the divine nature verse 5 and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity notice he didn't mention a single gift right he says be partakers of the divine nature there's only one divine nature that's God and he says this is what his divine nature is he doesn't mention a single gift now gifts have their place but I believe they should be in order and he says for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lath these things is blind and cannot see a far off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things ye shall never fall you may have your seats and I was I read this quote and it's it's a a very well-known quote and it is the rising of the sun brother brandham says And he as he being the groom the bride has to come forth cuz it's a part of him and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations any other has spoke of the Bride it can only manifest he says if it does something different from the groom so if the bride does something different from from the groom he says it isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh life of his life power of his power she is him and I started thinking about this brother Brian I'm how what a powerful quote that is he says she is flesh of his flesh the bride the church is flesh of God's flesh she's bone of his bone she's life of his life power of his power and when we when we listen to that when we read that there's something that our mind goes those two right away power of his power and we think of of of powerful things raising the dead Healing The Sick and that is in the bride because it's Jesus Christ and he's in the bride he say she is him but I started thinking there there's more to Jesus than just healing right there's more to Jesus than just power physical power to raise a body there was more to Jesus than that and that's what we want to get into because we want to know then what is the divine nature of God that should be in US yes sir because if the Holy Ghost is in you if you've been filled with the Holy Ghost you will have God's divine nature in you so the first thing we have to find out is what is God's divine nature right even in the Old Testament we could see God's nature as a type when Adam came forth because Adam was the son of God and a son is like his father and when Adam came forth he was a God on Earth he had was in control of everything it was a perfect world and out of him came an eve now Satan deceived Eve and Eve fell the Bible says Adam was not deceived but Eve was deceived and Adam had every right to leave Eve aside and God would have destroyed her God would have destroyed Eve because she sinned but Adam having the nature of God wasn't willing to leave his bride aside to die but instead he stepped out and took her to him self he stepped into death to save Eve and it's the first Glimpse we see of the divine nature of God because God loved man and God so loved man that as soon as they fell he gave a promise that I will redeem amen that's God's divine nature I will redeem now because of sin and because of the Fall there's a law that comes into place and if you were to look at the Old Testament and the law with with without Holy Spirit guidance you think God is an Angry God you would think God is a god of No Mercy because if somebody came to the mountain and touched it they died but even in the Old Testament where there had to be a sacrifice a lamb sacrifice even there God showed his Mercy to some like David David was a man after God's Own Heart and when David Fell in adultery by the law he should have died but God's nature stepped out he loved David and he spared him when David came to to the temple and he was running from Saul the Bible says he took the showbread that only the priest should take and he partook of it he should have died but God's divine nature was Mercy yes sir amen so we see that because of sin God was forced to place forth A law but even there in the Old Testament we see the type of the Tabernacle in the wilderness where God showing there's an outer Court there's an inner court and you can be in the outer court and there can be winds and storms and it shakes you he says you can come into the inner court that no longer shakes you but you're still not in the presence of God but when you come into the holy of holies that's where God meets you and now the shakina glory is there nothing else matters God's showing I will meet you in that third place in the soul hallu Hallelujah so what's God's desire for man it wasn't that man should fall God's desire in his heart toward man was to save you know brother brandham said I used to think God was angry at me but Jesus loved me right he says and then I found out that Jesus was the very Heart Of God that means that Jesus is the very nature of God so if we're trying to find out what is the nature of God and how should it be in us then we ought to look at Jesus because he was God represented in flesh and it was God's divine nature on Earth and what did he do what did Jesus do he came to save amen so we find that in John 3 everybody knows this verse John 3:16 we want to know God brother brandom said he says that God made manifest in Jesus Christ which he built a body made his body so he was first God above us then he was God in Jesus Christ he says thirdly through the death of that body he Sanctified a church that he can dwell in and then brother brandom says what is it God condescending to his creation God wants to be worshiped the word god means object of worship and it's God trying to condition his people this is what this message came for trying to condition these people so he can get for them what he created them for you realize God every single service that we come to is God trying to condition this church and the individuals to get from you what he put in you he says he never made you to be something else besides a son and a daughter of God he says if you have missed that of being a son and a daughter of God you've missed the mark yes sir so if you've missed having God's divine nature in you you have missed the Mark if you've missed what being a Christian is what does Christian even mean to be Christlike to be Christlike not just in gifts and in power but to be Christlike in his divine nature more than just exercising power because anybody can exercise the power I was just listening to the false anointed ones at the end time they can have signs they can have wonders but what they can't have is the word living in them and flowing through them but God sent this message to bring us out of Pentecost not to leave those things behind but a furtherance to get closer to God that we could build upon that yes sir amen you know I was thinking about and I was listening to a podcast months ago about Martin Luther no sorry about Luther and about the battle that he went through he's a Catholic priest a monk and the reason he's a monk is because he thinks God is mad at him that's right and I'm listening to this and all I can think is this man thinking God is mad at him he was a Catholic and all he did was constantly beat himself up had to do Penance he was bound to a system and it was causing them to to look at God the wrong way it was causing them to not realize how God looks at him and if you can't see how God looks at you how can you look at one another the way you ought to and here's Martin Luther and he starts reading and praying and we know he was a messenger of God and when he comes upon this scripture the just shall live by faith they're talking about how Martin Luther started rejoicing and as I'm listening to that just a podcast but the spirit of the Lord started coming into the car because I realized this was Revelation this wasn't just a man reading a scripture and making up his own idea but this was predestinated of God and he realized that I don't have to pay for my sins because Jesus paid for my sins and if he paid for my sins then I'm Justified you realize that is a part of the building of God which means today you are Justified which means you don't have to pay penants you don't have to be hard on yourself when you realize that Jesus loves you and he gave his only begotten son John 3:16 for God so loved we're talking about the heart of God God so loved the what the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life and verse 17 says for God sent KN his son into the world to do what you mean the word didn't come to condemn that's right the word didn't come to condemn it came to save Not all men will receive it as a gift from God for salvation but the word did not come to condemn and this message did not come in this day to condemn this message didn't come to separate this message didn't come so that people would be think themselves something great because have more knowledge because we're going to find out knowledge does nothing for you without the nature of God knowledge does nothing for you could lay hands and there could be healing and power and speaking of tongues without the nature of God it means nothing this is God's heart to man I will send my heart I will come down myself to save man not to condemn man so we want to see that if Jesus is a representation of the nature of God and were to be partakers of that divine nature then what was God like in flesh we know he raised the dead we know he healed the sick we know no devil could stand in his presence but what was his personality like how was he like to others right this is an introspective service which means we look at ourselves not look at our neighbor not look at the the RO or that family that doesn't do it like I do but look at yourself am Amen brother brandham said the message didn't come to build walls and there shouldn't be walls between churches that believe the message there shouldn't be walls between families that sit in a church but there should be Liberty of the holy spirit that God saved you and he saved me and you might sing different than me but you're God's son I might not be able to sing like you but I'm God's son but what's happened is all these churches have started looking at each other well you don't do it like I do it brother brand said every single church is Sovereign yes sir which means God's in control of it all but every church is different that means that your church doesn't have to be like mine and mine doesn't have to be like yours as long as Jesus is there and Jesus is the word hallelujah he so what was Jesus like Zechariah 9 prophesying of him it said Rejoice greatly oh Daughter of Zion shout oh daughter daugh of Jerusalem behold that King cometh unto thee he is just and having salvation and he is lowly so Jesus was lowly he says in Matthew 11:29 take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart you mean Jesus God made flesh was on Earth and he didn't walk around with his chest sticking out no he didn't he was Meek and he was lonly so God's divine nature is to be meek and lonly so let's look at ourselves to be like Jesus he was loving you know in John 11: 3-5 it talks about when Martha and her sister Lazarus was dying and they call to Jesus and they come and say come quickly our brother is dying and the Bible says Jesus loved them now realize the way we look at love and the way God's love actually is is very different because when we think of love I love my son I love my children and if they want something and and they're hurt not just want something but they're hurt and they need help my love to them is to go immediately to their help and it should be but here Jesus says he loved them and yet he went on his way for two more days if it was the way we thought of Jesus loves me he should come right away when I pray he should be there heal me right away he didn't do that but he loved them how should we be then to be like Jesus we're talking about Jesus loved a rich young ruler came to Jesus and said what can I do to inherit eternal life and Jesus the Bible says looking upon Him loved him yeah now was this Rich Young Ruler a predestinated no we find out later he's in hell because he couldn't listen to the word but that didn't change how Jesus treated him the Bible says Jesus loved him sir which means Jesus loved even unbelievers Jesus loved make Believers Jesus loved everyone right he came to save the world not to condemn them he didn't come to condemn that Rich Young Ruler he came and he loved him amen now the love of Jesus the love of God is very different than how the world portrays it today because the love of God will love you and change you and it's corrective brother brandom says if God loves you he will correct you and it'd be like if you saw Junior on the street and you just left him there and said now Junior don't do that but he's in danger you ought to bring him in and teach him maybe with a little spank that you can't go there it's for your good amen that is the love of God corrective love so he loved the Rich Young Ruler and he stood there Jesus the divine nature of God and he hung on a tree and they had taken a crown of thorns and put it on his head they had put nails in his hands and his feet they had striped him laughed at him mocked him done all these things and if there was ever a man that had a right to not love somebody and to be vindictive it was Jesus on the cross but the Bible says he looked upon him and he said father forgive them think about the nature of God that he loved them and he was forgiving that he would look at people who hated him laughed at him mocked them striped them and he didn't say father curse them he said father forgive them amen how different was it than the two disciples the sons of thunder they came into a city and they came with Jesus and they rejected him and they looked at Jesus and they said Jesus should we call fire down from heaven and Destroy them and Jesus looked at him and said you don't even know what Spirit you're of because I didn't come to destroy I came to save think about the mercy of God made flesh even in the Old Testament that he would come to Sodom and gomorah and he was going to wipe them away and if anybody deserved to be wiped away it was them and yet Abraham interceded and he said God if there's 50 righteous will you spare them and the mercy of a merciful forgiving God said if there is 50 I will spare that's right Abraham said 45 he said I will spare the nature of God I will forgive I will spare he came all the way to five and he said if there is five in all of West Palm Beach even though there's sin on every corner and there's homosexuality and Satan has taken but if there's five I will spare am how different from those two disciples who had power they had received a Ministry of power and yet they were willing to look at a people and say I will destroy you because you won't receive me but that wasn't Jesus and that's not this message that wasn't brother brandom you know there might be people that come after and take the message and want to use it to beat each other up and talk about each other and take quotes and sling them at each other right but that wasn't the nature of Jesus and that wasn't the nature of Jesus today through a message but he came to save and to forgive Jesus was loving merciful and forgiving even to those who would not accept to be like Jesus then brother Rand says she is power power of his power tell me what's more powerful to for somebody to be sick to be healed or to forgive what's power what's more important for the bride to be able to exercise a gift or to have the nature of God in them and to love to forgive to pray for one another not to talk about one another not to to anticipate that somebody's going to make a mistake and when they fall I see I knew they were going to make a mistake but to say let me bear that load let me pray for you let me help restore you as Jesus restored me let him restore you and let it be through me lily of the valley let your sweet Aroma flow through this church you know the Bible says these signs shall follow them that believe not them that believe will follow after signs they will believe and the signs will follow that means you don't have to be sign Seekers you don't have to se gifts and power you just believe God and watch it come you just believe God and watch him heal your sick watch him save your lost watch him go after your sons and daughters that have gone out you just believe God to be like Jesus amen he was so merciful how many people are like Pharisees today that they brought a woman caught in adultery and they threw her before the word they threw her before Jesus and they knew Moses said she should die Jesus the heart of God see in the Old Testament she should have died but Jesus didn't come to condemn he came to save and the Heart of God started riding in the sand the Pharisees wanted the justice of God and how many people are just looking for the justice of God Pastor they deserve to be kicked out that family deserves to be left aside brother bam said when they draw you out draw the circle bigger and the Pharisees wanted God's justice but Jesus didn't come to have Justice he came to forgive and there's a woman that deserve death and the Heart of God said he that is without sin go ahead and cast the first stone huh he that is without sin go ahead and text somebody about who did what he that has never made a mistake go ahead and run somebody over with your words and the Bible says that every single one of those Pharisees had their rocks and they dropped them because they realized I have sinned I have made mistakes and even now I'm seeking God's Justice you don't know what Spirit you of Jesus didn't come to condemn but to [Music] save Jesus looked upon this woman because he knew who she was and he knew that it didn't matter how dark it had gotten there was a seed of God there the same seed was in another woman and Jesus loved her and he went by her where the Bible says he had needs to go by Samaria amen and even the disciples who had power wouldn't understand so he sent him away they won't understand what God the Jesus the heart of God is here to do and he sat by a well at a certain time because he knew this woman's been ostracized nobody wants her she's been married six seven times she has sinned that if she came into think about it if she came into this church today if that woman caught an adultery walked into this church today how would you think how would you feel what would you would you be the Pharisee or would you be Jesus she is him she has power of his power and he had power to forgive yes siren and we're talking about a grand story but how much more to forgive one another oh my brother didn't shake my hand but I forgive him oh my brother talked about me my sister talked about me but I forgive them release them let them [Applause] go he went by the well because he knew this woman needs Mercy she might look like she has nothing to do with church but I'm here to savej when everybody else would reject you he said I'll take you right you've had six husbands you've had six men in your life let him be that seventh man that comes and restores and makes whole right right amen huj and you may have gone from denomination to denomination from man's idea to man's idea why don't you let this seventh age message be what makes you whole this is important it is life and death it is more important and and hear me right it is more important than how many gifts you can exercise am it is it is more important so if Jesus was the heart of God then it shows us how we should be so this is why I said it's an introspective service am my to be like we sing the song to be like Jesus to be like Jesus on Earth I want to be like him and so many people are just influenced and they just want to have big meanings and power brother brandham said that was Pentecostal bait because they would sit there and they were speaking tongues and he said he saw two men speaking in tongues and translating speaking in tongues and translating and he said I had a gift and I wanted to know what is this so he walked up and he started talking to him and Discerning and he said one of them was a real Christian yes sir a real man of God had the love of God in his heart exercising a gift but he was another one also exercising a gift and he said this man was had a wife living with another woman had a child by another woman and brother brandom said as soon as he confronted him about it he he ran away sir gifts and callings are without repentance so if Jesus loved if Jesus forgave if Jesus was Meek and lonely then the bride who has his divine nature who is power of his power flesh of his flesh bone of his bone she is him so if he forgave she will forgive and if he loved those who didn't love him she will love those who don't love her she won't be like those two disciples let me just burn them up that's not what the power came to do brother the brandom said power without character is satanic amen then how important is it how important is it Paul talks about it and he talks about it in 1 Corinthians 12 verse 27 now gifts have their place and Paul came to this church a Corinthian Church and when he came he said what is this here some of you say I'm of Apollos some of Paul some of sephus which is Peter and some of you just say I'm of Jesus and then he says what is this I hear that when I come every one of you has a tongue every one of you has a prophecy every one of you has something and he says let me set this straight because see this was a Church of God but they needed to be set straight in the word because gifts follow them that believe signs follow them that believe but they have to be placed in the right order and brother brandom said how many times and I'll read the quote later how many people have gone after it the wrong way and they end up on the side of the road crashed sir figuratively speaking he says I've seen it you've seen it he says many preachers right many preachers go after the wrong way and they end up on the side of the road many young people go after it the wrong way and they end up on the side of the road because there's denominational thinking you know that you can bring a denominational idea into the message and wrap it in message lingo but it's still denomination you know when you're just seeking a gift and making you know you're that you're just rapping something because Pentecostal believes that you have to speak in tongues that's a sign an Evidence brother what did Brother brandom say the evidence of the Holy Spirit was he says to receive the word for your day he had an interview with the sister and she was saying brother brandom I just want to know do I have the Holy Spirit and brother brandom said sister I've combed through your life with this gift of my life combed and I've seen nothing that tells me otherwise and she said but I make so many mistakes and brother brandham said it's not the mistakes that that's why the blood is there he says sister I believe you have the Holy Ghost so here's a sister that makes so many mistakes and the prophet Combs through her life and can't even see them because the blood was there yes sir Hallelujah so Paul says in 1 Corinthians 12: 26 s he says now ye are the body of Christ and members in particular and God has set some in the church first apostles secondarily prophets thirdly teachers after that Miracles then Gifts of healing helps governments diversities of tongues he says are all Apostles are all prophets are all teachers are all workers of Miracles have all the gifts of healing do all speak with tongues do all interpret he says but cover earnestly the best gifts and some people stop right there and they say then I'm going to just covet earnestly the best gifts and we ought to but Paul goes on and he says and yet I show unto you a more excellent way so you mean there's a more something more important than just gifts in a church that's right he says covet them seek after them but I'm going to show you something more important it's more excellent it's better than what you're thinking you have and he goes into verse one of the next chapter and he says this is the more excellent way he says though I speak with tongues of men and angels and I don't have charity which is love he said I am become as a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol he says and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and have all knowledge think about that though I could take the Seven Seals and I could explain it perfectly and I have just the right Revelation but if I don't have love and I'm busy here trying to throw off on another brother while he doesn't believe it like I do he's wrong and if you don't believe in my way then you're lost he says I could have every knowledge understand every single mystery I could have listened to every message and know how to explain it but if I don't have love it serves me nothing prise the Lord nothing but man has gone after the knowledge and understanding all Mysteries but they've put the cart before the horse because without the holy spirit all they've done is made denominational message churches that say it is my way or the highway and they set up men with special Revelations when God didn't send us an eighth messenger God sent a seventh messenger and he said when this seventh messenger begins to sound all the mysteries of God will be finished which means I don't need any other man's Revelation all I need is the message that God sent through a prophet because they finished every mystery and you know what if there's something that I can't quite grasp or something people say brother brandom didn't touch on everything if there's something he didn't give us brother brandom said it says right here seven seal stop don't go further and if God would tell a prophet stop don't go further then what business do I have trying to figure out what it was right what business does the church have trying to add to it when God told the prophet stop which means if God told him to stop then everything we need for a Rapture is already there that's because he said this seventh message will for come the coming the second coming right amen so there's no need to add to it just stop just believe it yes just believe it brother brandham said they said brother Brandon what should we do he said don't try to make all these Fantastics he said just live a simple Christian Life which means to be Christ like to be like him so don't try to seek the mystery and the knowledge and seek it just stop just ask God God whatever you want for me reveal it to me feed on the word and then just live like Jesus lived Love Like Jesus loved forgive like Jesus forgave Hallelujah that'll be a settled Church brother Brandon said I'd rather have the wrong Doctrine and the right Spirit that's powerful because today many of us would rather have and are seeking after just the right Doctrine right Doctrine right Doctrine and have forgotten about the right spirit and Paul says and though I have all Faith so that I could remove mountains and if I don't have love charity I am nothing he says and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity if I give my body to be burned and I don't love God so somebody can give their body to be burned and not have the love of God in [Music] them it profiteth me nothing he says now this is what love is Charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not think about yourself I'm thinking about myself charity vaunteth not itself it's not puffed up it does not behave itself unseemly it seeketh not her own what brother Brandon say eternal life was living for others seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in truth charity love doesn't rejoice when somebody Falls and says I knew they were going to fall I knew that young person couldn't make it I knew they were just Faking It when they went to the altar now look at them where they are charity doesn't puff itself up it doesn't rejoice in evil but It suffers Long Hall he says it beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things he says charity never fails now whether there be prophecies they shall fail and whether there be tongues they're going to cease we need them they're in the body they're in the church but they're going to cease whether there be knowledge it's going to vanish away listen to what Paul says for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away am we prophesy there's gifts in the church there's healing there's speaking in tongues but that's just in part because there's going to come a time when that will be no more we won't need healing on the other side we won't need speaking in tongues on the other side there'll be no need for prophecy over there because it'll be all whole it'll be perfect as God ordained it there'll be no more need to edify because there'll be Perfection so these gifts will cease we need them now I need healing now because my boys get sick because I get sick your little niece needs healing now but on the other side there'll be no need for healing because there'll be no sickness there'll be no sorrow there'll be no need to pray for a lost loved one because they'll be there made whole and yet the church has gone after these things that will cease and they've sought after them and seek them and when and coveted after them than they should when it's going to cease Paul says this is the more excellent way you could exercise nothing but if you have the love of God which is this message in the Holy Spirit in your heart that's all you need and brother brandham said the exact same thing and God told him the exact same thing because he went beyond the curtain of time yes sir and he said he got there and it was Perfection and he said all these young ladies and all these young men and he said the young ladies would come hug him and he said there was no feeling there as we have now he says here we ought not to hug brothers and sisters because there's feelings but he says on that side none of that was there sin was gone Tru oh and he looked around and he said what is this and he said the voice said these are your people and he thought these are all Broms and he said no no these are your converts and we know what he said he said they're going to be here and stand judged with you by what you preached and he said will Paul and his group be judged and he said yes and he said well if he makes it we'll make it because I preached what Paul preached and all those Souls thousands upon Millions said we are resting on that and brother brandom's there and he says still can't quite understand what this is and he says what is this and the voice says this is divine love Hallelujah everything you've ever preached everything you've ever believed here it is divine love and it's the voice said nothing can enter here without it amen and brother Brandon said when he came to he said I am more convinced than ever that it'll take Divine love to make it there sir amen here's a prophet who seen Miracles who has seen it all dead raised tumors fall yes and he says it'll take Divine love to get to that place the Bible says God they'll come to me and they'll say haven't I done so many wonderful works in your name and he said depart from me for I never even knew you she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone power of his power she is him what are we looking at how are we trying to be like him brother Caper sang that song lily of the valley Let Your Love throw through me the sister sang the song let everything I do for Jesus be love yes right love because you could exercise every single gift and miss it all but if you have Divine love it'll only take Divine love to get to this place and when you have love when you believe and have love then watch all the gifts start coming in place because brother Brandon said faith and love go together and they operate the gifts so we said it's an interest perspective service look at ourselves Lord then help me this ought to be our prayer help me to be like you and when I say Lord help me to be like you help me to Love Like You Loved help me to forgive like you forgave help me to be like you and you add everything else the Bible says these signs shall follow Lord let me just believe and let these signs follow let's all stand amen [Applause] brother brandom says and that's what we're supposed to do reflect the Son of God and now we're supposed to do his work he said he that believeth on me St John 14:7 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also you're beginning to reflect the works of Christ but he says but so many of us try to do the works of Christ before the reflection of Christ is in us he said now there's the trouble we find those things happening you know it and I know it we see these stumbles along the road we find a scrap heap of ministers and of Christians piled along the road is because they didn't go into it right the statue of a perfect man so father let's all bow our heads that ought to be our prayer the prayer of every single individual in this church Lord I don't want to just go after the works let your reflection be in me first and everything else will take care of itself you realize it's God that operates the gifts yes sir it's God that heals not a man it's God that saves not a parent or a preacher and it's God That Forgives and if it's God that does all that then our desire ought to be Lord let you come in and flow through us we said it was an introspective service so if there's any here that can look at our lives and we all ought to look and realize Lord I've fallen short maybe I've had my eyes on the wrong thing maybe I haven't quite acted how you acted Lord you forgave the unforgivable you loved the unlovable you were patient you didn't give up on anybody Peter looked at you and you knew he was going to betray you and you said I have prayed for you Hallelujah not Peter I knew you would do this but I have pray prayed for you and when you are converted strengthen the Brethren notice Jesus didn't give up on his own the Bible says having loved his own he loved them unto the end and here we are we're at the end time and that word holds true Jesus loves his own till the end so father my prayer for this church Lord for each individual father is that your love Lord would flow through us father you you gave us this message it's a precious message and you didn't give it to us Lord just to Puff us up to make us think we're somebody but you gave it to us Lord that we might be partakers of your divine nature Lord your Prophet said not for one moment do I come to to make men followers but I come to establish a relationship between man and Jesus Christ and father I believe that's the desire of every everybody here every Minister every Church that believes your word is we want to see established a relationship between your bride and you father your Prophet said she is bone of his bone flesh of his flesh she is him she is power of his power father then let us look at what real power is and that's your divine nature Lord let us forgive like you forgave father Lord let us love like you loved Let Your Love flow through US father and you'll take care of the rest father you promised it Lord you sent us this message to Rapture us we don't have to figure out how it's
