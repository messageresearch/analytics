[9:03] mercies wherever they would travel and
[9:04] and their way back as well we ask all
[9:07] these things in Jesus Christ name we
[9:08] pray amen amen so let's open our Bibles
[9:11] to um Joshua um chapter
[9:15] 10 and we'll read verses 11 through
[9:22] 15 set my
[9:23] [Music]
[9:26] timer perfect say Amen when you get
[9:29] there
[9:33] so very familiar scripture so it says um
[9:37] and it came to pass as they fled from
[9:39] before Israel and were in the going down
[9:41] to Beth horn that the Lord cast down
[9:43] great stones from Heaven upon them unto
[9:46] aeki and they died and they were more
[9:49] which died with hailstones than they
[9:51] whom the children of the Israel slew
[9:53] with the
[9:54] sword then spake Joshua to the Lord in
[9:57] the day when the Lord delivered up the
[9:58] amorites before the children of Israel
[10:00] and he said in the sight of Israel son
[10:03] stand thou still upon Gibbon and thou
[10:06] moon in the valley of Aon and the sun
[10:09] Stood Still and the moon stayed until
[10:11] the people had Avenged themselves upon
[10:13] their enemies is not this written in the
[10:15] book of jaser so the sun Stood Still in
[10:18] the midst of the heaven and hasted not
[10:19] to go down about the whole day and there
[10:22] was no day like that before it or after
[10:24] it that the Lord hearkened unto the
[10:26] voice of a man for the Lord fought for
[10:28] Israel and Joshua returned unto all
[10:31] Israel with him unto the camp to gelal
[10:34] you may be seated so um uh the tile of
[10:37] this uh sermon is Victory is coming um
[10:40] so Sunday I didn't know what to preach
[10:42] and um as Abby was singing that song the
[10:45] Lord just gave me inspiration and then
[10:48] after that the lord gave me a scripture
[10:50] and then brother Jonathan actually said
[10:52] this uh talked about the scripture that
[10:53] the lord gave me so it's just really
[10:55] confirmation right there um cuz as a
[10:57] minister we want to make sure that we
[10:58] have the mind of the Lord and I don't
[11:00] want to just be up here and just talking
[11:02] but I want to make sure it's from God so
[11:04] I just love when God just works that way
[11:06] and just gives you confirmations and
[11:07] just speaks to you and so anyways so we
[11:11] we see this uh moment of Israel as uh
[11:14] they were promised the promised land and
[11:16] as we were seeing it um they 40 years
[11:19] they had to withstand because of the
[11:21] name saying of the children of Israel
[11:23] and we see God had had this promise to
[11:24] them and uh we see that uh they needed
[11:27] more light and so we see that victory
[11:30] was coming they didn't know when but
[11:31] they knew victory was coming and Joshua
[11:34] just spoke by inspiration to son stand
[11:37] still and God hearkened unto that and
[11:39] we'll just take we'll take over in this
[11:41] quote right here it's called Stand still
[11:43] and see the salvation of the Lord then
[11:45] one day when the people had been
[11:47] promised a promised land they were
[11:49] fighting a hard battle and Joshua was
[11:50] the head of the battle how many feel
[11:53] they're in a hard battle sometimes
[11:54] during the week during life and we're in
[11:57] the same we got to put yourself in the
[11:58] Bible because we're going through hard
[12:00] times we're living in a hard age but we
[12:02] got to remember who we serve so and the
[12:05] sun was going down and God wanted to
[12:07] show his people who he was so he had the
[12:10] sun to stand still while the Earth moved
[12:13] or stopped or whatever it did until God
[12:15] displayed his power he can make the sun
[12:18] stand still and stand still I'm fixing
[12:20] to do something I want to display my
[12:22] power to a people who was doing exactly
[12:24] that I promised to do them so if you're
[12:26] walking in what exactly God has told you
[12:28] to do you have nothing to fear because
[12:31] God is backing everything in heaven is
[12:32] backing you up because you're following
[12:34] the perfect will of God so I I believe
[12:36] that God is fixing to do something big
[12:38] for our church we see the things he's
[12:40] done already and God just doesn't I
[12:42] believe God is going to do something
[12:43] even more because we're coming closer
[12:45] and closer to the end of the year and we
[12:47] see God just slowly doing things
[12:49] speaking in tongues interpretation we
[12:51] see Sunday school all these things that
[12:53] God is doing and and God is still
[12:55] working we don't serve a dead God we
[12:57] serve a god who's and do something big
[13:00] in our personal lives as well so we got
[13:02] to open our mouth up and just speak
[13:04] sometimes I think a lot of times we're
[13:05] scared to to speak we got to speak
[13:08] things into existence don't don't don't
[13:10] be scared to ask God big things cuz God
[13:13] wants to bless you amen and he he's he's
[13:15] he's in the we're we're in Christmas
[13:17] season but even before that God is an
[13:19] amazing father and knows what you need
[13:22] in each moment of the of of your life
[13:24] and so we got to just we got to speak
[13:26] the word we got to be in the word so we
[13:27] know the word so we can speak speak the
[13:29] word amen amen so let's go to um Genesis
[13:35] 18 and and God wants to show us he's
[13:37] still God just like he showed to the
[13:39] children of Israel he wants to show us
[13:40] the same exact thing it may not be a
[13:42] literal son but you got it's all types
[13:44] and shadows of God can do the same thing
[13:46] in our life too so in Genesis 18:14 says
[13:50] is anything too hard for the Lord at the
[13:53] time appointed I will return unto thee
[13:55] according to the time of life Sarah
[13:57] shall have a son and I just that
[13:59] nothing's too hard for the Lord I think
[14:01] a lot of times we're scared to ask God
[14:03] certain things but nothing's too hard
[14:06] for the Lord if if I look at this if
[14:08] Abraham could have a kid at 100 years
[14:10] old then what's stopping us from doing
[14:13] things that we want to do in our life
[14:16] cuz God knows we have desires in our
[14:17] hearts he knows we have needs but he's
[14:19] just waiting for us just to bring our
[14:21] strong reasonings as the Bible says see
[14:23] God knows you need something but he's
[14:25] waiting for you to say it out just like
[14:27] a father it's like a a parents sometimes
[14:29] know that they actually they know what
[14:31] you want but they're waiting for you to
[14:33] ask so the same thing is he's waiting
[14:35] for you to ask a certain need maybe you
[14:37] have an unsaved loved one you want maybe
[14:39] you have a Deliverance you need of or
[14:41] Finance or whatever it is don't be
[14:44] scared to speak it out and so let's go
[14:46] to Jeremiah 32 and uh verse1 17 I Lord
[14:50] God behold thou H has made the Heaven
[14:52] and the Earth by thy great power think
[14:53] of this God just by a word spoken to
[14:57] existence made Heaven and Earth
[14:59] so what makes you think it's hard for
[15:01] him to meet a need or to restore
[15:04] something in your life because we're in
[15:06] the season of
[15:07] restoration God God is God has showing
[15:10] us time and time again what restoration
[15:12] is we see people who um who haven't been
[15:15] in church for a long time that God is
[15:17] slowly restoring or has restored them so
[15:20] don't think anything's impossible for
[15:22] you to ask maybe you have a parent or a
[15:24] son or a daughter ask now open up big
[15:27] don't wait until it's too late right
[15:29] right right amen we'll go to adoption uh
[15:32] adoption 1960 and we'll read uh
[15:34] paragraph 61 one day he had needed a
[15:37] little extra time the sun was going down
[15:39] the men couldn't fight very good at
[15:41] night time Joshua the great warrior
[15:43] anointed of God positionally placed I
[15:46] love that how many believe that we're
[15:47] positionally placed tonight amen
[15:50] positionally placed into the land like a
[15:52] feans to the new church possess
[15:55] possessed possessing the land and taking
[15:57] it over so footsteps me possession so if
[16:01] God has given you something you have
[16:03] every right to take it back from the
[16:04] devil because it's your possession
[16:06] because God has given you so what God
[16:09] has given you we have a right to it and
[16:11] don't let the devil take anything that
[16:13] belongs to you he has no
[16:16] right and um taking it over he needed
[16:19] some time so he said Son stand still and
[16:22] she stood still for about 12 hours think
[16:24] about that 12 hours until he took the
[16:27] land see and we go to I have heard but
[16:29] now I see Joshua was in an hour of
[16:32] crisis when the armies was routed and
[16:35] the sun was going down Joshua was a
[16:37] prophet and he knew that if them armies
[16:39] ever had a chance to unite again and
[16:41] come against it he would lose more men
[16:44] so in that hour of crisis when something
[16:46] had to be done there's only one thing if
[16:48] he could keep them from running he'd
[16:49] route them everyone but there wasn't
[16:51] enough light to do it so Joshua Stood
[16:54] Still raised his hands and said Son
[16:56] stand still and moon hang over Allan
[16:58] till get through the battle and the sun
[17:00] Stood Still there they heard Joshua
[17:02] speak and then they seen God with their
[17:03] own eyes in action true so I believe
[17:07] that we know what God is capable of we
[17:09] seen him time and time again we all have
[17:11] testimonies but I think a lot of times
[17:13] we need to take that same faith we had
[17:15] back then and put the faith in the same
[17:18] situation because God is going to move
[17:20] but he's waiting for your faith to match
[17:22] up cuz God isn't going to move if we
[17:24] have unbelief God see I remember at one
[17:26] time when Jesus was walking and he had
[17:29] to go away from this town because there
[17:31] was so much unbelief and so we need to
[17:33] have faith we live in a day and age
[17:35] where Satan is running rampant he's
[17:37] trying to just let's uh our
[17:40] faith but we got to stand up and say I'm
[17:42] taking God at his word even if I don't
[17:44] see the change tomorrow I'm still going
[17:46] to believe as if the change is going to
[17:47] happen right now and so and I I just
[17:51] love just this I just love being here uh
[17:53] you know this this God taking me here to
[17:55] this wonderful church and being now a
[17:57] member of this church I've seen so many
[17:59] wonderful I've never seen speaking in
[18:01] tongues before like that like that live
[18:03] I wish I was there to see it but just
[18:04] seeing God doing things that he's still
[18:07] in a God that restores and I I just love
[18:10] to see things like that because it shows
[18:12] me that if God could do that back in the
[18:14] day in the 1960s and the 50s and 40s he
[18:18] can do the same thing today cuz I was
[18:20] listening to that I missed that sermon
[18:21] and uh when uh when brother Jerry um
[18:24] interpreted it and I was as I was
[18:26] listening to it it remind me just like
[18:28] the tape like you hear somebody speak in
[18:30] tongues you need to hear that voice just
[18:31] this interpreted so I I just love that
[18:33] we serve a God who just didn't stop in
[18:35] the 1960s when the prophet left the
[18:37] scene but we serve a god who's still
[18:39] doing the same things when the messenger
[18:41] died the message didn't stop I'm saying
[18:43] it again when the messenger died the
[18:44] message didn't stop the message is still
[18:46] going on because there's a generation
[18:48] that still needs to hear it and so we
[18:50] got to play our part and and not only
[18:53] know about the message but be the
[18:55] message because if Jesus Christ is
[18:57] living inside of you you are the word
[18:59] because the word is living inside of you
[19:02] amen so um one day um while we're
[19:05] talking another section we talk about
[19:08] David now so one day while King while
[19:09] King Saul um was King Israel needed a
[19:13] victory it looked like there were be no
[19:15] Victory because they saw Goliath they
[19:17] saw this big giant uh the giant they
[19:19] said was like about 9t 9 in which is 10
[19:21] ft so as Israel was they needed a
[19:25] victory but to them it looked like there
[19:27] was no Victory because they had this big
[19:29] obstacle in their this way this obstacle
[19:31] this man he had armor that probably
[19:33] weighed more than David did himself and
[19:35] this man had was a Warrior from his
[19:38] youth so if we look at the odds they
[19:40] were stacked against Israel but I love
[19:43] that that it isn't how big the person is
[19:45] it doesn't matter because we serve a god
[19:47] who's bigger than anything and so they
[19:50] were in a situ they weren't in a problem
[19:52] but they were in a situation as brother
[19:54] Jonathan said and looked that there was
[19:55] no hope but little did they know God was
[19:58] bringing Victory soon that God was s
[20:01] sending a little Shepherd boy scrawny
[20:04] and so I I just love how God does things
[20:06] because he could have sent some big
[20:07] muscular man but he sent somebody
[20:09] scrawny just like I believe Samson
[20:11] wasn't some bodybuilder but I believe he
[20:13] was some scrawny man too and one day he
[20:15] used a Jawbone to kill hundreds of
[20:18] Philistines cuz if you look logically
[20:20] speaking that Jawbone would have broke
[20:22] in the first instance that it hit
[20:24] somebody in the head but we serve a God
[20:26] who isn't Bound by human physical
[20:29] limitations we serve a God who can do
[20:31] anything that anything that looks
[20:33] impossible he can make it possible so
[20:36] let's take our reading in Samuel uh 1st
[20:38] Samuel verse um
[20:42] 17 so I just love this story of David
[20:45] and Goliath um uh because like I said
[20:48] but once again we got to put oursel in
[20:50] the same shoes as we read the Bible
[20:52] because the these aren't just stories
[20:54] for us just to say oh it's a good story
[20:56] but it's a story for you to look at and
[20:58] see what a what a man like you and I did
[21:01] put faith in God and he overcame because
[21:03] he put faith in God because we know that
[21:06] David physically could not defeat
[21:08] Goliath if he went head-to-head with
[21:11] Goliath he would have been destroyed but
[21:12] because God was with him and he trusted
[21:14] God he had all he needed that was the
[21:17] majority amen so let's go verse three
[21:20] 173 and the Philistines stood on a
[21:22] mountain on the one side and Israel
[21:24] stood in a mountain on the other side
[21:25] there was a valley between them and
[21:27] there went out a champion out of the
[21:29] camp of the Philistines named Goliath of
[21:31] gath so now I want you to listen to the
[21:33] descriptions that they give them whose
[21:35] height was six cubits in the span which
[21:37] is 10 ft almost and he had a helmet of
[21:39] brass upon his head and he was armed
[21:41] with a coat of Mal and the weight of the
[21:43] coat was 5,000 shekel of brass I'm not
[21:45] sure how much that is but that sounds
[21:46] like a lot and he had Greaves of brass
[21:49] upon his legs and a target of brass
[21:50] between his shoulders and the staff of
[21:52] his spear was like a Weaver's beam and
[21:54] his Spear's head weighed 600 shekel of
[21:57] iron and one bearing a Shield went
[21:59] before him and he stood and Cried unto
[22:01] the armies of Israel and said unto them
[22:03] why are you come out to set your battle
[22:05] in Array am I not a Philistine and you
[22:07] the servants to Saul choose you a man
[22:09] for you and let him come down to me if
[22:12] he be able to fight with me and kill me
[22:14] then will be servants but if I Prevail
[22:16] against him and kill him then shall you
[22:18] be our servants and serve us so I I just
[22:21] love when I love how the devil when he
[22:23] he has somebody against a wall he puts
[22:26] these threats out and he says if if you
[22:28] defeat me I I'll serve you but in
[22:30] reality the devil's not going to keep
[22:32] his in barking like brother Jack said he
[22:34] he's just sounding good because he has
[22:36] the upper Advantage because as we read
[22:38] later in the story we see what happens
[22:40] uh the Philistines like you said didn't
[22:42] keep their end of the bargain that they
[22:43] kept fighting Israel so let's keep going
[22:46] if um if he be able to fight with me and
[22:48] kill me then you'll be able to servants
[22:49] but if I Prevail against him and kill
[22:51] him then shall you be our servants and
[22:53] serve us and the Philistines said I defy
[22:55] the armies of Israel this day give me a
[22:58] man that we may fight together when Saul
[23:00] and all the Israel heard these words of
[23:02] the Philistines they were dismayed and
[23:04] greatly
[23:05] afraid now David was a son of that epher
[23:08] of Bethlehem Judea whose name was Jess
[23:10] and he had eight sons and the man went
[23:13] down among them for an old man in the
[23:14] days of Saul and the three eldest sons
[23:16] of Jesse went and followed Saul to
[23:18] battle and the names of his three sons
[23:20] that went to the battle were ellip the
[23:22] firstborn and next unto him and and the
[23:25] third Shaman and David was the youngest
[23:27] and their eldest followed Saul and then
[23:29] we'll jump down to verse 25 so so I like
[23:34] this right here just to stop right here
[23:35] so Israel was looking at the trial ahead
[23:38] of them like it was an impossible trial
[23:40] to overcome they were looking at the
[23:42] odds but they weren't keeping on their
[23:44] eyes on God because if they looked at
[23:46] their history they could go back and see
[23:49] that that God delivered them from the
[23:50] hands of pharaoh that God opened a Red
[23:53] Sea that God put put plagues upon Egypt
[23:57] that God drowned every Egyptian that was
[23:59] chasing him that God made water come out
[24:02] a rock that God reigned Mana down from
[24:05] heaven that God promised them a land
[24:07] with flowing with milk and honey in fact
[24:09] they were already in the promised land
[24:10] at this time that God promised them
[24:12] grapes all these things that God
[24:14] promised him but yet they were looking
[24:16] at the odds because if they look back in
[24:18] history God defied all the odds because
[24:21] in reality they should have died uh with
[24:23] the Egyptians but that wasn't their end
[24:26] God still had more that was God's chosen
[24:28] people people and so we see they if they
[24:31] went back they could see how Abraham had
[24:33] a kid after 25 years and all these other
[24:36] things they could see but instead they
[24:38] decide to look at the odds but God
[24:40] doesn't look at the odds and how how how
[24:43] how much of a man is better than you but
[24:45] God looks at his perfect will that if
[24:47] God has called Israel to overcome then
[24:49] they're going to overcome no matter what
[24:52] and so I I love how David that he didn't
[24:54] look at Goliath at how big he was but he
[24:57] looked at how big his God was and that's
[24:59] what we got to look at the situation
[25:00] look how big your God is don't look
[25:02] don't look don't look how don't look how
[25:04] big the situation look how big your God
[25:06] is so let's go to um verse 25 and the
[25:10] men of Israel said have you seen this
[25:11] man that has come up surely to defy the
[25:14] Israel he's come up and it shall be that
[25:16] the man who kth the uh him the king will
[25:19] enrich with him great riches and will
[25:21] give him his daughter and to make his
[25:22] father's house free in Israel and David
[25:24] said to the
[25:26] men that stood by him saying what shall
[25:29] be done to the man that kill the
[25:30] Philistine and taketh away the reproach
[25:32] from Israel for who is this
[25:34] uncircumcised Philistine that he should
[25:36] defy the armies of the Living God so I
[25:38] love how in the midst of an atmosphere
[25:40] of fear and defeat David is creating an
[25:43] atmosphere of Faith because he doesn't
[25:46] care what everybody else is thinks
[25:48] because he remember he's reminding
[25:49] himself what God did for him that if God
[25:52] gave him power to to kill a bear and a
[25:54] lion that this Philistine can cannot
[25:56] stand against the armies of God so I
[25:59] love how when we go in a situation we
[26:01] got to make the atmosphere of Faith
[26:03] because what doubt does is get you to
[26:05] disbelieve God and it gets you to
[26:07] compromise with the word so we got to
[26:09] create an atmosphere of Faith that's
[26:11] what's going to get you through a
[26:12] situation is keeping your eyes on the
[26:14] author and finisher of your faith let's
[26:16] go to verse 27 and the people answered
[26:18] him after this manner saying so shall it
[26:20] be done to the man that kth him and
[26:23] eliab his eldest brother heard when he
[26:24] spake unto the men and El's anger was
[26:27] Kindle against David he said why camest
[26:29] thou down hither and with whom thou left
[26:31] left those few sheep in the wilderness I
[26:33] Know Thy pride and the Hess of thy heart
[26:36] for thou art come down that thou
[26:38] mightest see the battle so I I feel like
[26:40] there's a little jealousy from his
[26:41] brother because one he got chosen to be
[26:44] king over him and another thing in fact
[26:47] his father actually sent him here so he
[26:49] didn't come on his own but his father
[26:51] actually sent him but in reality we know
[26:52] that God sent him here because because
[26:55] God sent Victory through David God used
[26:58] David to give Israel Victory because God
[27:01] was inside of David amen so um let's go
[27:05] to verse 29 and David said what have
[27:08] have now done is there not a cause and
[27:10] he turned from him to another and spake
[27:12] after that same manner and the people
[27:14] answer him again after the former manner
[27:16] verse 31 and when the words were heard
[27:20] he rehearsed them back to Saul and he
[27:21] sent for him and David said to Saul let
[27:24] no let no man's heart fail thee because
[27:26] of him thy servant will go and fight
[27:28] with the Philistine and Saul said to
[27:30] David thou are not able to go against
[27:32] the Philistine to fight with him for
[27:34] thou are but a youth and he a man um war
[27:37] from his youth so I love how how Saul's
[27:39] pointing that out but I don't see Saul
[27:41] taking the initiative to go fight
[27:43] Goliath he's pointing out him oh you're
[27:45] is are you but what are you doing cuz
[27:48] you just you just standing and cow and
[27:50] fear just like them cuz they said uh I
[27:52] believe the Bible says that uh Saul was
[27:54] Head and Shoulders above Israel it's
[27:56] like we could say about seven foot so
[27:58] Saul wasn't a short man but he was
[27:59] definitely a scared
[28:01] man so let's keep it going and we go to
[28:04] verse 34 and David said unto Saul thy
[28:06] servant kept his father's sheep and
[28:08] there came a lion and a bear and took a
[28:10] lamb out of the flock so I love he's
[28:11] just giving God glory right here he's
[28:13] just testifying what God did and he said
[28:15] I went out after him and smoted him and
[28:17] delivered it out of his mouth and when
[28:19] he arose against me I caught him by his
[28:21] beard and smoted him and slew him thy
[28:24] servant slew both The Lion and the bear
[28:26] I love the r and this uncir circumcised
[28:28] Philistines shall be as one of them
[28:30] seeing Heath defiled the armies of the
[28:32] Living God so we got to say the same
[28:35] thing with our loved ones that that the
[28:36] enemy has no right to have a hold of our
[28:39] loved ones anymore he's going to have to
[28:41] restore a
[28:42] double double he's going to have to and
[28:45] so if David could St in a situation like
[28:47] this because I know if I saw a 10- foot
[28:48] man I'll be I'll be a little scared
[28:50] probably at first but if David could
[28:52] stand in front of a 10-foot man and and
[28:55] when he talked he wasn't just talking to
[28:57] talk he was talking knowing that God was
[28:59] with him and he had confidence that
[29:01] whatever he would do that God would back
[29:03] him up and help him because he could no
[29:05] longer wanted to see uh Goliath defile
[29:08] the armies of the Living God because he
[29:10] was disrespecting him all these things
[29:12] he was cursing them and David is like
[29:14] enough's enough cuz if Saul don't want
[29:16] cuz Saul is a king and a king should be
[29:17] standing up but David was like all right
[29:19] I'll stand up if nobody else is going to
[29:21] stand up so maybe situation that you got
[29:22] to stand up for your loved ones somebody
[29:24] else can't but you got to stand in the
[29:26] Gap brother BR said his we got to stand
[29:28] in the gap for our loved ones apply that
[29:30] token David said moreover the Lord that
[29:33] delivered me out of the Paw of the Lion
[29:35] now of the Paul of the bear he will
[29:37] deliver me out of the hand of this
[29:38] Philistine and and Saul said un David go
[29:41] and the Lord be with you and Saul armed
[29:43] David with his armor and he put on the
[29:45] helmet of brass upon his head also he
[29:47] armored him with a coat of M and David
[29:49] GED his sword upon his armor and the say
[29:52] to go for he had not proved it and David
[29:54] said unto Saul I cannot go with these
[29:56] things for I have not proved them and
[29:58] and David put them off D um David's like
[30:00] I don't need this this armor I I know
[30:03] God was with me I didn't need armor then
[30:05] and all the armor I need is the armor of
[30:07] God so he had Spiritual armor he didn't
[30:09] need all that armor because that armor
[30:11] didn't do no good but could we see that
[30:13] because if if it did them something good
[30:15] they would have actually uh fought with
[30:17] Goliath but we see David had the courage
[30:20] think about this a lot of time imagine
[30:22] as somebody going in a war and you have
[30:24] no helmet no nothing and no gun that be
[30:28] kind of scary but but David knew that
[30:29] his God would protect him in the front
[30:31] and the back let's keep it going and the
[30:34] Philistine came and Drew near uh sorry
[30:36] he took his staff in his hand and chose
[30:38] him five Stones Jesus stones out of the
[30:40] brook and put them in the shepherd's bag
[30:42] which he had even in a script and his
[30:44] slang was in his hand and he drew near
[30:47] to the Philistine and the Philistines
[30:49] came on and Drew near unto David and the
[30:51] man that bear The Shield went before him
[30:53] and when the Philistines looked about
[30:54] and saw David he disdained him for he
[30:57] was but Youth and Ruddy and a fair
[30:59] countenance and the Philistines said
[31:01] unto David am I a dog that thou mayest
[31:03] come to me with staves and this
[31:05] Philistine curs David by his Gods little
[31:07] did he know when he when he said this
[31:10] statement that he didn't realize that
[31:13] God was with David and so yeah he he may
[31:16] look like he's Ruddy and all these
[31:17] things but if the god of Israel is with
[31:19] you there's nothing that can stop you I
[31:21] don't care what I don't care how many
[31:23] people the devil sends there's nothing
[31:25] that can stop you if God is with you if
[31:26] God is for us then who's against us so I
[31:29] don't care how many trials the devil
[31:31] throws at you I don't care how many um
[31:34] Road Blocks he throws at you God has
[31:36] called us to live an overcoming life God
[31:39] has called us to to
[31:41] Victory we win if you look in the back
[31:44] of the book we win so I don't care what
[31:46] he he puts at you I don't care what he
[31:48] does you're going to make it cuz God
[31:51] said I'm going to make it he says I'm an
[31:53] overcomer he says you're an overcomer so
[31:55] and we're overcoming together we're in a
[31:58] race we're not running against each
[31:59] other we're running against ourselves so
[32:01] we got to fight every day amen where we
[32:03] at now verse verse 43 let's go to um
[32:06] verse 44 now and the Philistines said to
[32:08] David come to me and I will give thy
[32:10] flesh unto the fowls of the air and to
[32:12] the beasts of the field then said David
[32:14] to the Philistines I bet you like right
[32:16] now like Saul and Israel hearing these
[32:18] things they're probably just cowering
[32:20] they're probably like man this dude's
[32:21] about to die like like does he hear what
[32:24] this man saying like he's saying some
[32:26] threats that he I know that he can he
[32:27] can he can do them but David's like
[32:30] uh-uh then David said to the Philistine
[32:32] thou comest to me with a sword and with
[32:34] a spear and with a shield but I come to
[32:36] thee in the name of the Lord of hosts
[32:39] the god of the armies of Israel whom
[32:41] thou Hast defiled so we got to say we
[32:43] got to think say say things like that to
[32:45] the devil we got to say things like to
[32:47] the devil because the devil doesn't fear
[32:49] us but he fears the god inside of us and
[32:51] so if if the god inside of us is living
[32:54] in there then the all the devil is going
[32:56] to have to bow down to Jesus Christ
[32:58] I don't care I don't care if it's the
[32:59] chiefest of the demon if if we're in the
[33:02] presence of God he's going to have to
[33:04] flee he's going to have to the B even
[33:06] brother BR said the weakest Christian on
[33:07] his knees the Devils tremble so it's not
[33:10] our power but it's his power I don't
[33:12] care how much a man has musles that is
[33:14] what going to stop the situation what's
[33:16] going to stop the situation is Jesus
[33:17] Christ himself amen he says that this
[33:21] day will the Lord deliver thee into my
[33:23] hand faith and I will smite thee and
[33:25] take thy head from thee and will give
[33:27] thy carcasses of the host of the
[33:29] Philistines this day unto the fouls of
[33:31] the air to the wild beasts of the earth
[33:32] that all the Earth may know that there
[33:34] is a God in Israel and Goliath is is
[33:37] looking like this this man knows what
[33:39] he's talking about I'm a warrior of I've
[33:41] been a warrior probably longer than he's
[33:43] been alive and Goliath is like this is
[33:46] this is blasphemy and this and this and
[33:48] all the symbol of shall know the Lord
[33:50] sath not with sword and spear for the
[33:54] battle is the Lords so I want us to
[33:56] remember that a lot of times we try to
[33:58] take it in our own hands and we got to
[34:00] remember the battle is the Lord's see
[34:03] don't try to force it down your loved
[34:04] On's throat that they need to serve God
[34:07] but let the Lord fight the battle like
[34:10] brother Jonathan said we're that small
[34:11] little Cog play our part and then God's
[34:14] going to move see see God has to do
[34:16] certain things certain times because if
[34:20] if he has to because a God is not a
[34:22] person who's going to force himself upon
[34:24] a person it's going to be free more
[34:26] agency that person's going to have to to
[34:27] make that choice and and God sometimes
[34:31] we have to wait on actually not
[34:32] sometimes we need to wait on God's
[34:34] perfect timing because all things are
[34:36] going to work out good that's what the
[34:37] Bible says but God's timing is the
[34:39] perfect timing and we don't want to rush
[34:41] just like our timing when we came to God
[34:43] it was at the perfect time it was a
[34:46] perfect time I know I was at a place in
[34:47] my life where I was at a low point and I
[34:50] gave my heart to God and and I had to go
[34:52] and sometimes we got to go through some
[34:54] things for us to see who God really is
[34:57] unfortunately God doesn't want it that
[34:58] way but a lot of times we have to go
[35:00] through these things so we can serve God
[35:02] in our own cuz that's the key cuz God
[35:05] doesn't want robots it's not going it's
[35:06] not going to be robots in heaven we're
[35:08] all going to have our own testimony and
[35:10] people going to be like you in Leo the
[35:11] see and age how' you make it I say CU of
[35:14] God he gave me a testimony and I had to
[35:17] prove it God gave me my own personal
[35:19] testimony he gave you your own personal
[35:21] testimony and uh let's go to verse 48
[35:23] and it came to pass when the Philistines
[35:25] arose and came and Drew nigh and meet
[35:26] David that David hastened and ran toward
[35:29] the army look at this he ran to a whole
[35:30] Army it didn't say one person but he ran
[35:32] to a whole Army to meet the Philistines
[35:35] and David put his hand in his bag and
[35:37] then a stone and slang it and smok the
[35:40] Philistine in his forehead that the
[35:42] stone sunk into his forehead and he fell
[35:44] upon his face to the Earth so David
[35:46] prevailed over the Philistine with a
[35:47] sling and with a stone and smoked the
[35:50] Philistine and slew him but there was no
[35:52] sword in the hand of David therefore
[35:54] David ran and uh ran and still bu upon
[35:58] the Philistine and took his sword and
[35:59] Drew it out of the sheath therefore and
[36:01] slew him and went to the philistin and
[36:03] when the Philistines saw their Champion
[36:05] was dead they fled so we see that that
[36:07] the devil he can talk a lot of junk you
[36:09] know he can he can trash talk but when
[36:11] it when it comes when he's defeated he's
[36:13] a sore loser yeah because in reality
[36:16] they said cuz I guarantee you if Goliath
[36:18] would have defeated Israel they would
[36:20] expected them to serve him yeah but but
[36:22] we see that it's the odds were odds were
[36:25] reversed because God was with Israel and
[36:28] the Philistines should know that anytime
[36:30] that you mess with God's people it's
[36:33] going to be it's going to be some
[36:34] consequences cuz there are some
[36:35] consequences because if you look later
[36:37] in in later in Samuel that David I think
[36:40] they they killed his Goliath's brother
[36:41] as well so it's consequences to defiling
[36:45] God's people so let's go to um we'll go
[36:48] to Hebrews 13 in one second actually
[36:50] I'll just say Hebrews 13 but he knew
[36:53] that the so David knew the God he served
[36:55] was more than able to give him over
[36:57] coming power to defeat that giant and
[36:59] God can do the same thing today for us
[37:02] that he can give you overcoming power to
[37:05] to uh overcome any Vice you have in your
[37:07] life or any issue any family Problem
[37:09] whatever it is that God can give you
[37:11] that same overcoming power and when I
[37:13] say that is because you have an
[37:14] overcoming you have you literally have
[37:16] the very Overcomer living inside of you
[37:18] and that's what gives you the power to
[37:19] overcome any and everything and as I
[37:21] said before we're we're in restoration
[37:24] so don't wait until next year to to to
[37:27] claim out for certain things open your
[37:28] mouth up wide now while while God is
[37:31] restoring I believe God will always be
[37:33] restoring until we come but we're living
[37:35] in this age we see right now in our
[37:37] church that God is doing wonderful
[37:39] things and I don't believe we're going
[37:40] to be in the school for long because
[37:42] God's just doing so much and I I see
[37:45] like I think last week I I went to set
[37:47] up and like it feel like every week I
[37:49] come to set up there's more obstacles I
[37:50] got to move out the way so it this looks
[37:52] like God is slowly trying to move us out
[37:55] you know what I'm saying I'm like it's
[37:56] like four was here and here I'm was like
[37:58] man it took it took me like 10 minutes
[37:59] just to move all that stuff and so I
[38:01] just see that God's moving and we're
[38:03] going to have a place soon and I'm not
[38:05] sure what soon is but soon is soon so we
[38:08] got to claim
[38:11] it amen and so like I said before let's
[38:15] go to Hebrews 138 I'll read it so Jesus
[38:18] Christ the same yesterday today and
[38:19] forever so if Jesus Christ was the same
[38:22] yesterday in David's time in Joshua's
[38:24] time in Moses's time that he's the same
[38:27] God today and I said before that there's
[38:29] going to be red seas in our life and
[38:31] like brother Jonathan said that we got
[38:32] to just walk to that Red Sea with faith
[38:35] and God's going to open it that's why he
[38:36] said it said uh said to Moses why cry
[38:39] but speak and so we got to just walk to
[38:41] the Red Sea and know that if he gave
[38:43] children Israel deliverance and freedom
[38:45] from from their enemies he can do the
[38:46] same thing for us in our with our
[38:49] enemies let's go to Mark 11: 22 through
[38:52] 24 amen so it says so I just love this
[38:57] right here so so this to me Faith is so
[38:59] important to have because God is looking
[39:01] for a Believer who can hold on to him no
[39:04] matter what's going on and Jesus
[39:06] answering saith unto them have faith in
[39:08] God for verily I say unto you that
[39:11] whosoever shall say unto this mountain
[39:13] so I don't care what goliath is there be
[39:15] thou removed and be thou cast into the
[39:17] sea and look check this part here and
[39:19] shall not doubt in his heart but shall
[39:22] believe that those things which he sayth
[39:23] shall come to pass he shall have
[39:26] whatsoever he sayith therefore I say
[39:29] unto you whatsoever things you desire
[39:31] When you pray believe that you receive
[39:34] them and you shall have them so and I
[39:36] want to say this Victory came that day
[39:39] for Israel that day and victory is
[39:41] coming soon for you too it could be
[39:43] today it could be tomorrow but I'll tell
[39:45] you Victory is coming soon so let's read
[39:48] a couple quotes this is from Witnesses
[39:51] um 1953 and David said who is this
[39:53] fellow said do you mean to tell me you
[39:56] let that uncircumcised Philistines sent
[39:58] out there to defile the armies of living
[40:00] God can't we uh can't we have somebody
[40:03] to stand there and witness to the powers
[40:05] of God all of them were scared he said
[40:07] I'll go I like that courage I'll go let
[40:09] me fight them let me fight them while he
[40:12] walked up they took him up to Saul and
[40:14] Saul said well that man is a Warrior
[40:17] from his why he's been a Warrior from
[40:18] his youth up and you ain't nothing but a
[40:20] youth look Hallelujah I loved it right
[40:22] here David said look thy servant to Saul
[40:25] the Lord let me kill a bear with a
[40:26] slingshot shot he uh let me take a kid
[40:29] out of a lion's mouth slay him I grabbed
[40:31] him by the whiskers and I took him away
[40:33] from him I'm a witness Hallelujah he had
[40:35] been somewhere he had seen something he
[40:38] had put the power of God to a test and
[40:40] he was a witness how many witnesses here
[40:42] tonight that that's what we need today
[40:44] is some more courage that's right yes
[40:46] sir he said I'm a witness of what I'm
[40:48] talking about Hallelujah that when the
[40:50] church with the Living God needs today
[40:53] is a witness who has been places seen
[40:55] something and knows what they're talking
[40:57] about he said I'm a witness of the power
[40:59] of God a bear went to grab a kid and I
[41:02] killed him he said a lion run and
[41:04] grabbed another I caught him by the
[41:06] whiskers and slayed him and he said uh
[41:08] that the god helped me to kill the bear
[41:10] and the lion he he won't much more give
[41:13] me the uncircumcised philistin into my
[41:15] hands Hallelujah read one more quote
[41:17] here and uh and brother we ain't got
[41:19] time to go through schools and all
[41:21] around this and teach this way that way
[41:24] that time's at hand rise up and what is
[41:26] given take yours let go men and women
[41:29] are dying everywhere he grabbed the ox
[41:31] gold this is shamgar and jumped up there
[41:33] and slew 600 Philistines Hallelujah he
[41:36] was sick and tired of the devil uh the
[41:39] devil being the devil so he he finally
[41:41] stood up and took control and because of
[41:44] God he had the courage to trust God and
[41:47] step out there not to learn to go off
[41:49] and learn how to do it oh God is your
[41:52] teacher Hallelujah the Holy Ghost will
[41:54] back up God's word every time right I
[41:56] ain't got time time to learn about it he
[41:58] just jumped out there and knocked down
[42:00] 600 Philistines his kids stayed that
[42:03] year amen like David he didn't have time
[42:05] to prove that armor he he knew that God
[42:08] was his teacher and God was with him so
[42:10] he didn't have to have this fancy armor
[42:11] he have to go to to military school but
[42:14] he knew that the great General was with
[42:15] him so the same thing with shamard he
[42:17] knew God was with him so he said I'm I
[42:19] know that I'm God's chosen people and my
[42:21] family's not going to starve anymore and
[42:23] he he took that Ox gold and went to town
[42:26] Samson one time when they had him all
[42:28] backed up in the corner he was just a
[42:29] man was standing there he didn't know he
[42:31] didn't have a weapon in his hand or
[42:33] nothing he looked down uh and there laid
[42:35] the Jawbone of a mill he picked up that
[42:37] Jawbone of a Mill and slew a thousand
[42:39] Philistines like I said logically
[42:41] speaking that Jawbone would have bro
[42:43] broke at the first Philistine head but
[42:46] we serve a God who who can defy the
[42:49] Logics defy the physics of this world um
[42:52] what's in your hand he did it after the
[42:55] spirit of God Came Upon him that's right
[42:56] and L ran and roared one time a little
[42:58] old curly-headed shrimp about that big
[43:01] stand and there Seven Locks hanging down
[43:02] like a little and the lion went
[43:04] out and roared and he couldn't do
[43:06] nothing but the spirit of the Lord came
[43:07] upon him and he slew the lion and he
[43:09] took a Jawbone of an ass and killed a
[43:11] thousand men with a Hallelujah it was a
[43:12] spirit of God that came upon him I'm
[43:14] saying here tonight brother if there's
[43:16] any time that the spirit of God ought to
[43:18] fall on the church it's today how many
[43:21] believe that turn turn your trouts up
[43:24] Hallelujah get under the spout so
[43:26] there's any time today God is moving and
[43:29] we're living in the last days and God is
[43:31] moving in your life and in our our our
[43:33] church body life as well and let's go to
[43:35] Matthew
[43:36] 28 let's talk about and I want to talk
[43:38] about one of the greatest victories that
[43:40] mankind has ever had and I'll tell you
[43:42] what it is when when when the uh when
[43:45] the women went when the Mary and all
[43:47] them went into the tomb and it saw it
[43:49] empty because when that tomb was empty
[43:51] that mean that we had the greatest
[43:53] victory that we've ever had in the
[43:54] history of mankind because that victory
[43:57] giving you Victory today now still and
[44:00] so when Jesus died upon the cross and
[44:01] Rose three days later it gave you the
[44:04] overcoming victory over uh hell death
[44:07] and the grave it gave you victory for
[44:08] your loved ones it gave you victory for
[44:10] your personal life it gave you Victory
[44:12] to have more of him inside of you and so
[44:14] I love that greatest victory that you
[44:16] don't no longer have to be a slave to
[44:18] sin no longer a slave to the devil
[44:20] because God bought you with a price he
[44:22] bought you back so you don't have to no
[44:24] longer live underneath the devil's
[44:25] bondage so now you can live Liberty you
[44:28] can you can live a a life of of freedom
[44:30] in Christ Jesus let's go to Matthew uh
[44:33] 28: 4-6 and we'll close after
[44:38] this so verses 4-6 in Matthew
[44:41] 28 verse five actually and the angel
[44:44] answered and said unto them the women
[44:46] fear not for I know that you seek Jesus
[44:49] which was crucified he is not here those
[44:52] are some of the greatest words in the
[44:54] Bible right there because when he was
[44:56] not here that mean he's risen and then
[44:59] when he risen that gave you access to
[45:01] the Holy Ghost it gave you as it gave
[45:04] you access to have him living inside of
[45:07] you that you don't have to depend upon
[45:09] the pastor or depend upon brother Garren
[45:11] but you have him you have access inside
[45:13] of you that you don't have to call the
[45:15] pastor because you have a need but the
[45:17] very need the very uh Jehovah Gyra can
[45:19] provide that need right there that you
[45:21] can depend upon him and I I love that
[45:24] because now I have the comforter living
[45:26] inside me and he can comfort me in my
[45:28] time of need he can give me peace in a
[45:30] situation he can bring me joy in a
[45:32] situation all these things that we have
[45:34] at our finger just because of what
[45:36] happened and read verse 9 and and they
[45:38] as they as and as they um went to tell
[45:40] his disciples behold Jesus met them
[45:42] saying all hail and they came and helped
[45:45] him by the feet and worshiped him then
[45:47] said Jesus unto them Be not Afraid go
[45:50] and tell my brother and they go into
[45:52] Galilee and there shall they see me so I
[45:54] just love that the very thing that see
[45:57] Jesus would he spoke to the disciples
[45:59] about these things but they couldn't see
[46:00] it at that time but when he came their
[46:02] eyes were open and now the same thing
[46:04] when Jesus came to us it opened our eyes
[46:07] our parents told us many times how good
[46:09] Jesus was the pastor told us but until
[46:11] we experienced him for ourself that that
[46:13] we knew that who Jesus was so just in
[46:17] closing let's not let's not end this
[46:19] year lazy let let let's claim victory
[46:22] let let let's March into Victory because
[46:24] God is calling us to be victorious let's
[46:27] March into what God is calling us as he
[46:29] as he uh as he lights the pathway let's
[46:31] walk even it's one step at a time let's
[46:34] walk into that Victory because we're a
[46:36] family we're a body we're a body so we
[46:38] got to work together we got to pray for
[46:40] one another we got to fight for one
[46:41] another because God wants to fall down
[46:43] in a mighty way but we got to make sure
[46:45] we're continuously in one Accord because
[46:48] Unity is something you got to fight for
[46:49] it doesn't happen naturally but you got
[46:51] to fight for it you got to pray for it
[46:54] you got to you got to put forth the
[46:55] effort cuz if we put our effort in
[46:57] that what God is calling us to be then
