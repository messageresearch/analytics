[12:35] God bless you this evening if you have
[12:37] your Bibles while you're standing with
[12:39] us we want to turn to the Book of Joshua
[12:41] the first chapter the Book of Joshua the
[12:44] first chapter and amen we've just been
[12:46] here in a bit of a a a study and series
[12:49] on on walking in the promises of God and
[12:52] just want to share a little portion with
[12:54] that to you tonight in Joshua chapter
[12:56] 1 and verse number six
[13:00] it's a very very familiar reading to us
[13:03] in Joshua 1 and: 6 be strong and of good
[13:06] courage For unto this people Thou shalt
[13:09] divide for inheritance the land which I
[13:12] swear unto their fathers to give them
[13:15] only be thou strong and very courageous
[13:18] that thou mayest observe to do according
[13:20] to all the law which Moses my servant
[13:23] commanded thee turn not from it to the
[13:26] right hand or to the left that thou
[13:28] mayest Prosper whether soever thou
[13:32] goest I love that that thou mayest
[13:35] Prosper whether soever thou goest not
[13:38] that thou mayest be in defeat but thou
[13:40] mayest Prosper now this book of the law
[13:43] shall not depart out of thy mouth but
[13:45] Thou shalt meditate therein day and
[13:47] night that thou mayest observe to do
[13:49] according to all that is written therein
[13:52] for then thou shal make thy way
[13:54] prosperous and then Thou shalt have good
[13:58] success amen notice all these blessings
[14:01] are promised to those who can stay with
[14:04] the word if you can stay with the word
[14:06] you can prosper and you can have good
[14:09] success in the book of First John
[14:11] chapter 1 1 John chapter 1 another very
[14:15] familiar reading 1 John chapter 1 and
[14:18] verse number five the Bible here says
[14:21] this then is the message which we have
[14:24] heard of him and declare unto you that
[14:27] God is ly
[14:29] amen and in him is no Darkness at all
[14:33] now if we say that we have fellowship
[14:35] with him and we walk in darkness we lie
[14:39] and do not the truth but if we walk in
[14:41] the light as he is in the light I love
[14:44] that word walk it means to progress if
[14:46] we progress as he is in the light we
[14:49] have Fellowship one with another and the
[14:52] blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanseth
[14:56] us from all sin amen we ask Lord this
[14:59] evening to add the blessing to the
[15:00] reading of his word as you can have your
[15:02] seats here tonight I want you by the
[15:04] help of the Lord for just a few moments
[15:06] if I would take a title tonight I want
[15:08] to speak to you on this thought of
[15:09] walking in the light of prosperity and
[15:13] success amen walking in the light of
[15:16] prosperity and success brother Bram
[15:17] would say in 1952 he said and I stand as
[15:21] Moses of old now we all know he
[15:24] fulfilled both a Moses commission amen
[15:27] as well as a Joshua Commission he said I
[15:29] stand as Moses of old standing in the
[15:32] breach for the people God bless this
[15:35] people bless the pastors and churches
[15:37] every church that is cooperating even
[15:39] those who are not cooperating that are
[15:41] indifferent he said God I don't pray for
[15:44] nothing else but they might see this
[15:46] marvelous happy glorious privilege that
[15:49] Christians have and walk in the light
[15:52] amen that they would see this glorious
[15:55] happy amen marvelous privilege that
[15:58] Christians have
[16:00] and walk in the light now I find it very
[16:03] amazing that as Believers amen that we
[16:06] have been called amen out of Darkness
[16:09] Into His Marvelous Light now you all
[16:12] know that we are not here tonight just
[16:14] as church members or just amen as
[16:16] religious people but we are here amen as
[16:19] Believers and I believe that Believers
[16:21] are the children of the day amen they
[16:24] are not the Children of the Night in
[16:26] other words amen we are not walking in
[16:28] the darkness of this hour amen but
[16:31] rather we are walking in the light where
[16:33] God has called us into then therefore
[16:35] tonight I can say to you amen that we
[16:38] are the children of the light now amen
[16:41] Believers are the children of the day
[16:44] they are the children of the light let
[16:45] me say this Believers amen are not just
[16:49] professors amen but Believers are
[16:51] possessors in other words we're not here
[16:54] just professing the promises of God but
[16:56] we are here as a generation to possess
[16:59] the promises of God and you all know
[17:01] that a prophet of God said that the
[17:03] promises of God Amen would not be easily
[17:06] handed to the church but rather when the
[17:08] promises of God are revealed it is the
[17:11] declaration of war that if you are going
[17:14] to possess it you're going to have to
[17:16] fight for it therefore we have a clear
[17:19] understanding tonight amen that
[17:20] footsteps means possession in Joshua 1:3
[17:25] he said every place amen that the soul
[17:27] of your foot shall tread upon amen that
[17:30] have I given unto you amen as I said
[17:34] unto Moses now I love that word there
[17:36] that Joshua uses into this land amen do
[17:39] you all know that land actually was
[17:41] territory amen their inheritance was
[17:44] their territory in other words they had
[17:47] no inheritance in Egypt that's why they
[17:50] had to come out of Egypt but there was a
[17:52] promise land where there were borders
[17:54] but inside those borders was their
[17:56] inheritance he said now Joshua was over
[17:59] there walking around after he crossed
[18:01] over Jordan amen then he began to eat
[18:03] some of the old corn he said now look
[18:06] Joshua amen give him a vision and said
[18:08] now my servant Moses is dead amen now
[18:11] rise and go over this Jordan amen thou
[18:14] and all the host of Israel and the Lord
[18:17] thy God will be with thee no man amen
[18:20] shall stand before thee all the days of
[18:22] their life as I was with Moses amen so
[18:26] will I be with you amen I don't have
[18:28] time to slow down and preach all these
[18:29] ears but I just want to say this brother
[18:32] said the most powerful thing to Joshua
[18:34] amen was the Revelation that as I was
[18:37] with Moses amen so will I be with you he
[18:40] said why was that such a powerful
[18:42] Revelation he said because Joshua knew
[18:45] all the mistakes amen that Moses made
[18:48] amen but in spite of all the mistakes
[18:51] God never left Moses and it become a
[18:54] comfort to Joshua amen that if Moses
[18:57] made mistakes but God stayed with him
[19:00] amen I will make mistakes but the same
[19:02] God Amen that stayed with Moses amen
[19:05] will stay with me I want to say to you
[19:08] tonight friends we are not here amen
[19:10] trying to reach sinless Perfection we
[19:12] are perfected through the blood of Jesus
[19:15] Christ listen we will have failures we
[19:17] will have shortcomings we will make
[19:19] mistakes hey but I got good news for you
[19:23] amen as I was with Joshua amen so will I
[19:27] be with those who will follow Joshua
[19:29] into the territory or into the land amen
[19:33] only be good courageous amen do not be
[19:36] discourage just keep moving on I will be
[19:39] with you every place you set the souls
[19:42] of your feet is a possession for you he
[19:44] said Footprints means possession brother
[19:47] and what the church needs tonight is
[19:49] some more Footprints amen what the
[19:52] church needs tonight is some more
[19:54] Footprints over here on this land amen
[19:56] don't you hang around Jordan too long
[19:59] amen let's get out of here and let's see
[20:02] what we got every time that he made a
[20:05] footprint amen it was a possession he
[20:08] said Brothers It's Time For Us Amen to
[20:11] make Footprints we cannot stay right
[20:14] here in the same camp amen the fire is
[20:17] moving on Amen let's move on from glory

[20:55] over there in the choir of the fire amen
[20:57] and the power of God fa and the Holy
[21:00] Ghost move but can I say something we
[21:02] can't go back there amen yes God was
[21:05] there amen but the same God that was
[21:07] there amen is right here tonight amen

[21:46] was breathing in this place amen but can
[21:48] I say this thank God we don't have to
[21:50] look back to Memories we don't have to
[21:52] paint a fire of what happened 10 years
[21:55] ago but there's a Joshua generation on
[21:58] the face of the Earth tonight and we
[22:00] refuse to sit down we refuse to quit
[22:03] possessing our inheritance and I'll just
[22:05] go ahead and say it the best days are
[22:07] not behind us they're just ahead of us
[22:10] amen there's more Giants to slay there's
[22:13] more testimonies to have there's more

[23:03] it they never would have enjoyed it they

[24:03] in the land or the territory that God
[24:05] has ordained for us to have now when you
[24:07] start studying this how many knows amen
[24:10] that in the Old Testament amen there was
[24:12] a Joshua amen we all know in the Old
[24:15] Testament there was a Joshua but do you
[24:17] know if there was a Joshua there had to
[24:19] be a Caleb and do you know in this day
[24:21] we're living amen there is a Joshua and
[24:24] there is a Caleb again brother said in
[24:27] the church age book said now let us
[24:29] stand like Joshua and Caleb our promised
[24:32] land is coming in sight even as theirs
[24:35] dead he said now Jehovah means jeh
[24:37] Joshua means Jehovah Savior and he
[24:40] represents the end time leader that will
[24:43] come to the church even as Paul came as
[24:47] the original leader so there was a
[24:49] Joshua who represented a prophet that
[24:52] would come to the generation amen that
[24:54] would leave the church the same way amen
[24:57] that Paul it in the beginning but there
[25:00] was not just a Joshua brother Jack there
[25:02] was a Caleb and Caleb represented those
[25:06] amen who stayed true with Joshua brother
[25:10] said did you notice God did not move
[25:12] Israel or let her go into the promise
[25:14] land until it was his own appointed time
[25:18] he said now the people might have put
[25:19] pressure on Joshua and said the land is
[25:22] ours let's go and take it Joshua you're
[25:25] all through you must have lost your
[25:27] commission you don't have the power you
[25:29] used to have you used to hear from God
[25:31] and know the will of God and act quickly
[25:33] amen something is wrong with you but
[25:36] Joshua was a god-sent prophet and he
[25:39] knew the promises of God so he waited
[25:42] for them I love this he waited for a
[25:45] clearcut decision from God and when the
[25:48] time came to move God placed the full
[25:51] leadership amen now that's a powerful
[25:55] Point Church that God would place not
[25:57] part of the leadership ship amen but the
[25:59] full leadership into Joshua's hands
[26:03] because he stayed with the word and God
[26:06] could trust Joshua but not the others
[26:09] amen so it will repeat in this day the
[26:11] same problems amen the same presses so
[26:15] Joshua's
[26:16] responsibility amen was to stay with the
[26:19] word and to lead the people into the
[26:22] land but Caleb's responsibility was to
[26:25] stay in step with Joshua
[26:28] brother B said keep in step with Joshua
[26:31] that's right get the new grapes and the
[26:33] new Pentecostal wine he said get drunk
[26:36] on it let's go forward let's follow the
[26:38] steps of our great leader and Conquer
[26:40] brother them footsteps means possession
[26:43] let's just keep walking into the
[26:45] promised land Not Looking Back to see
[26:48] what will happen back there and what
[26:50] somebody else is doing are you hearing
[26:52] me keep your eyes on Jesus amen the
[26:55] Joshua the leader just keep moving on
[26:58] into deeper depths and higher Heights
[27:01] until you possess everything that God
[27:04] promised you in his word he said all men
[27:06] cannot receive this this is hid to the
[27:09] eyes of the world and it is foolish to
[27:11] them but those who are born and elected
[27:14] to eternal life they believe it and we
[27:17] see the hour that we're living let's go
[27:20] forward remembering this that we have
[27:22] something behind us listen we talked
[27:25] about it we have some good days behind
[27:27] us and yes Jesus Christ the same
[27:30] yesterday today and forever we're in
[27:33] those days he said but there's something
[27:35] behind us amen but there's something in
[27:38] us and he said there's something before
[27:40] us amen something behind us something in
[27:44] Us and something more for us he was he
[27:48] is and shall come he's the same Jesus
[27:51] that was is the same Jesus tonight and
[27:54] he's the same Jesus that shall come let
[27:57] me let me sound a trumpet to you we
[28:00] don't have to paint a fire amen and try
[28:02] to warm our young people by a painted
[28:04] fire we don't have to talk about 20
[28:06] years ago and 30 years ago and 40 years
[28:09] ago I say we ought to be birthing some
[28:11] testimonies amen right here out of this
[28:15] church amen give our young people some
[28:17] landmarks in their generation listen as
[28:20] we live amen we're going to possess the
[28:23] land we're going to possess testimonies
[28:25] we're going to possess victories we're
[28:27] going to say powerful manifestation let
[28:30] me just say this but we're going to have
[28:32] to do some walking we're going to have
[28:34] to do some walking amen used to be an
[28:36] old brother back home in Tennessee he'd
[28:38] say it's time to quit sitting on the
[28:40] premises and start walking on the
[28:42] Promises I'll tell you I think it's a
[28:44] good thing friends Amen to quit sitting
[28:46] in the church and saying well let

[29:15] to walk a mile or two miles or or five
[29:18] miles drop 10 pounds y'all know what I'm
[29:20] talking about amen can I say this to you
[29:23] that's in the natural amen but what
[29:25] about in the spiritual you say how much
[29:27] walking a have to do brother B said look
[29:29] at Hebrews he said by faith the walls of
[29:32] Jericho fell down after they walked
[29:34] around them seven days but said before
[29:37] one rock ever come out of the building
[29:39] of the walls of Jericho amen Joshua
[29:42] walked around the walls he was shouting
[29:45] the victory now can I just say something
[29:48] to you as long as Israel was under the
[29:51] dispensation of Moses they were on the
[29:53] defense amen the enemy chased them to
[29:56] the Red Sea the enemy chase them out of
[29:59] Egypt but when they come underneath
[30:01] Joshua they move from the defense to the
[30:04] offense in other words it was no longer
[30:06] the enemy chasing them but the Gars now
[30:09] them chasing the
[30:11] enemy come on church amen they didn't
[30:14] chase Joshua away from the walls of
[30:16] Jericho Joshua would chase them to the
[30:18] walls of Jericho and they ran inside
[30:21] those walls but you know what Joshua
[30:23] said he said you can run but you can't
[30:25] hide he said we'll tear them walls down
[30:28] to get to you bunch of devils you will
[30:30] not hold God's people hostage any longer
[30:33] and there is a five-fold Ministry on the
[30:35] earth tonight who is not backing up Amen

[30:40] backing up to the powers and the
[30:42] pressures of this age we got a sword in
[30:44] our hand and we're going to go forward
[30:46] and deliver God's people hallelujah I

[31:05] but I see the Victory and if I can see
[31:08] the victory I know the walls were coming
[31:10] down walk around those walls seven times
[31:16] seven days brother said but he was
[31:18] looking at the Unseen it was a promise
[31:21] that God made how much can you walk
[31:24] around that
[31:25] wheelchair direct quote how much can you
[31:28] you walk around that cancer how much can

[31:45] I'm the Lord who Health all thy
[31:49] diseases when you can see that
[31:52] everything else weakens
[31:55] away before the first rock ever mov
[31:58] moves before the first symptom ever
[32:00] leaves if you can just see the promise
[32:04] of God if you can just see the promise
[32:07] of God it will literally weaken away he
[32:11] said Joshua looked at the Unseen and he
[32:13] walked around those walls believing it
[32:16] would happen it all depends on what
[32:20] you're looking at can I say something to
[32:22] you you just keep walking God will do
[32:26] the opening
[32:28] God don't need you to worry about how

[33:33] spring when the Rivers had its worst
[33:36] when it's the worst time to cross and

[34:45] remember that these trials and things
[34:47] come upon us are only done because God
[34:51] loves us he gives it to us because he's
[34:54] got confidence in us he believes that we
[34:57] have faith

[35:01] able to overcome it right there is
[35:04] Caleb's confession when he came up to

[36:10] I'll say this to you our weapon is
[36:12] praise amen our weapon is worship our
[36:15] weapon is Thanksgiving unto God our
[36:18] weapon is the preaching of the word our
[36:20] weapon is the laying on of hands our
[36:22] weapon is the casting out of the devil
[36:25] our weapon is spiritual but it is Mighty
[36:27] unto God to the pulling down of
[36:31] strongholds well glory to God you have
[36:34] been equipped with the most powerful
[36:36] weapon that has ever been placed into
[36:38] the hands of man and it's called the
[36:40] word of
[36:42] God you know what Paul said he said the
[36:45] word Hebrews 4:12 the word of God is
[36:47] quick it is powerful and sharper than
[36:50] any two-edged sword it is piercing even
[36:53] to the dividing the sun of Soul and
[36:55] Spirit of the joints and the marrow
[36:58] and is a discerner of the fals and
[37:01] intents of the heart I love what a
[37:03] prophet of God said he said the sword is
[37:05] plenty
[37:07] sharp so you don't have to worry about
[37:09] when you get there is it going to be
[37:11] sharp enough to slay the giant the sword
[37:14] is plenty sharp it goes beyond the
[37:17] physical it goes into the spiritual
[37:19] realm and picks up the thoughts of the
[37:22] heart and reveals them the spirit of God
[37:25] the word of God he said now that word
[37:28] will cut in there if there's enough arm
[37:31] behind it to push it in it'll find its
[37:34] place and cut every promise out and give
[37:37] it to you if you just got the strong
[37:40] enough arm behind it amen the sword pick
[37:43] it up in an arm of faith can you take
[37:46] this instruction grip it tight and hold
[37:49] on to it notice we're no longer on the
[37:52] defense we on the offense and walk into
[37:55] the face of the enemy
[37:59] walk into the face of the enemy how can
[38:02] that uncircumcised enemy ever stand in
[38:05] the presence of the Eternal God so you
[38:08] take the sword of the word and every
[38:10] promise belongs to you so pick it up in
[38:13] a strong hand of faith and walk forward
[38:16] if you need healing cut it out with the
[38:18] word Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[38:21] today and forever if you need salvation
[38:25] every promise in the Bible is yours now
[38:28] can I just say what a prophet said he
[38:30] said it's laying back in there and Satan
[38:33] is trying to hide it but take the sword
[38:37] and push through the darkness until the
[38:40] light of God shines in upon your soul
[38:43] and you have the
[38:46] promise God glory to God you need a
[38:49] strong hand of Faith you need a strong
[38:52] arm of Faith to pick up the sword of the
[38:55] spirit and face your enemy and drive the
[38:58] sword right into the face of your enemy
[39:00] and stand there and let the light of God
[39:03] Amen shine in upon your
[39:06] soul you say preacher what is the light

[43:12] say this plain as a prophet said it he

[44:56] ago what makes them valuable
[45:00] tonight I know that devil and it's real
[45:03] this is not a man's message this is the
[45:05] message of the King
[45:08] on we come out of the world to walk in
[45:12] this
[45:13] light amen now I heard people they say
[45:17] well amen I don't like this and I don't
[45:18] like that and I don't like but you know
[45:20] brother Jack I've come to realize as as
[45:23] human beings you have a right to preach
[45:25] and teach whatever you feel God is
[45:27] leading your heart to
[45:28] teach brother B said if brother never
[45:30] wanted to teach Jehovah Witness Doctrine
[45:32] let him teach it that's right but can I
[45:34] say something take your Liberty to teach
[45:37] what you feel to teach but just don't
[45:39] call it for message all right when it
[45:42] directly contradicts what a prophet said
[45:44] and don't put pressure on me to believe
[45:46] your
[45:47] interpretation listen I'm not a dummy I
[45:49] can read what a prophet said you can
[45:52] read what a prophet said you can go in
[45:54] your homes and listen to the tapes you
[45:57] can hear Joshua speak to you and tell
[45:59] you where you belong and tell you what
[46:01] you belong in come on Church don't you
[46:04] let nobody lead you away from the voice
[46:06] of Joshua you are
[46:12] Caleb somebody say well can I preach he
[46:16] told me to take my Liberty somebody say
[46:18] well amen we don't believe in this we
[46:19] don't believe in what brother said there
[46:21] okay I don't have a problem with that
[46:23] amen just acknowledge that brother
[46:24] brandom said it but you don't feel to
[46:26] follow what he said instead of putting
[46:28] pressure on us calebs who were trying to
[46:30] take our mountain and keep in step with
[46:33] our Joshua is that okay we come out of
[46:37] the world to walk in the light of God
[46:40] and it leads us to the promised land I
[46:43] love what David said he said thou Hast
[46:45] delivered my soul from Death now will
[46:47] thou not deliver my feet from falling
[46:49] that I may walk before God in the light
[46:52] of the
[46:53] living another place David says I will
[46:56] walk before the Lord in the land of the
[46:59] living I love this so the Believers are
[47:02] walking before the Lord in the light of
[47:05] the living as well as in the land of the
[47:07] living which means by the jack for none
[47:10] other than walking in the
[47:12] truth David says in Psalms 8611 he says
[47:16] teach me thy way oh Lord I will walk in
[47:19] thy
[47:20] truth unite My Heart To Fear Thy Name
[47:24] John says it like this he says I Rejoice
[47:27] greatly that I found of my children
[47:29] walking in the truth as we have received
[47:32] a commandment from the father again he
[47:35] says I have no Greater Joy than to hear
[47:38] that my children are walking in the
[47:42] truth I love what a prophet says in
[47:44] Jubilee year for a man that comes to
[47:46] truth and fails to walk in
[47:49] truth all right then he has according to
[47:53] the scripture he's blasphemed or
[47:55] rejected the whole holy spirit of God
[47:58] and is a p pass the day of redemption
[48:02] again I can bring the truth but if you
[48:04] reject it and walk away I know the Bible
[48:07] says if you do that then there's no more
[48:09] remission of sins till you come and make
[48:11] that right again that's exactly right so
[48:14] if you see truth you walk in truth the
[48:19] minute you see truth is the minute you
[48:22] put on your walking shoes that's a
[48:24] direct quote and you start walking in
[48:27] the truth bam comes in 1965 on a subject
[48:30] called marriage and divorce and he says
[48:32] I'm going to try tomorrow if the Lord
[48:34] willing to speak on the subject there
[48:36] are two schools of thought see and may
[48:38] God help us to know what is truth just
[48:41] to know what's truth so we can walk in
[48:44] the truth and in the light now if we
[48:47] walk in the light that means we are
[48:49] walking in the light of the hour or the
[48:52] light of the age brother now I hope this
[48:56] is okay in first John he said if we walk
[48:59] in the light as he is in the light we
[49:02] have Fellowship one with another and the
[49:04] blood of Jesus Christ his son amen
[49:07] cleanseth us from all sin in Shalom 64
[49:11] he said to me I want to see what is
[49:14] Promised for the day I want to know what
[49:17] the lot of the hour is so I can know how
[49:21] to walk in it I want to know where I'm
[49:23] living what age I'm in how far up the Ro
[49:27] am I praise God now listen friends we
[49:30] have already come through Luther's light
[49:33] and Luther walked in justification light
[49:36] Wesley walked in sanctification life
[49:38] amen Pentecost walked in the restoration
[49:41] of the gifts life but listen the prophet
[49:43] of God said we're walking in a higher
[49:46] light or a greater light we are walking
[49:49] in the light of the fullness of the
[49:51] revealing of the word he said now notice
[49:55] here he is okay he was the word made
[49:58] light or became light the word in that
[50:02] generation he was the word light of that
[50:05] generation because the prophets of old
[50:08] spoke of him and here he come and
[50:11] Vindicated he was the light of God's
[50:13] spoken word all the prophets had said
[50:17] had been fulfilled in him so the
[50:20] prophets back here come on Church the
[50:23] prophets back here was Zacharias and
[50:25] Jeremiah and Ezekiel and Daniel and
[50:27] Malachi and brother they were speaking
[50:29] of the word the Messiah becoming flesh
[50:32] but here is Jesus the word made flesh
[50:36] and what they spoke back there is now
[50:39] fulfilled in his
[50:41] flesh come on now there was something
[50:44] behind him but now there's something in
[50:47] him what was behind him was now
[50:50] manifested in him and there was
[50:52] something more in front of him glory to
[50:55] God he did not say let's go back to
[50:58] Moses let's go back to Ezekiel you know
[51:00] what the Bible said the Bible said for
[51:02] the joy that was set before him he
[51:05] endured the cross despising the shame
[51:08] and to sit down at the right hand of the
[51:11] father at the Throne of majesty on high
[51:13] you say what was before him I'll tell
[51:15] you what was before him was the word
[51:17] made flesh in his
[51:20] bride there is no two lights there is no
[51:23] three lights there's only one light
[51:26] there's not Methodist Baptist Lutheran
[51:28] Presbyterian amen Christ is the light
[51:31] and he is the light is the life and the
[51:33] word manifested is the light of the hour
[51:38] can I say to you what a prophet spoke of
[51:40] you is now fulfilled in your flesh
[51:44] that's
[51:46] right can I tell you something he said
[51:49] something about you he said there would
[51:51] be a people who would live so close to
[51:53] God till the devil don't know what to do
[51:55] with them can I say this I'm not looking
[51:58] for that I'm looking at
[52:01] that he said there would be an
[52:04] invincible Army I'm not looking for that
[52:07] I'm looking at that he said as the world
[52:10] gets more worly the church would get
[52:13] closer to God he said while the world is
[52:15] becoming worldly the church is becoming
[52:18] powerful I'm not looking for it I'm
[52:21] looking at
[52:23] it yes sir the word manifested
[52:27] is the light of the hour he said we are
[52:29] to be the children of the light and the
[52:31] light is the word which is made light
[52:33] for this age how do we know light except
[52:37] it comes from the
[52:39] word are you ready for this the word
[52:42] made flesh is the light of the age when
[52:47] you see it all right come on the Bible
[52:51] said so again there is something wrong
[52:53] with your experience when you say that
[52:55] you love God
[52:57] and refuse his
[52:59] word no man he says can come to me
[53:02] except my father draws him see no man
[53:05] will never see it it's that
[53:07] predestinated seed and that only is
[53:10] going to receive it but we've come to
[53:12] that place again the Bible said you are
[53:14] the light of the world now let me just
[53:16] say what a prophet said if that's okay
[53:18] in this hour that we're living in I know
[53:21] it is I'm just I'm just preaching in
[53:23] this hour we're living in I know where
[53:25] I'm preaching in this hour we're living
[53:26] in now the a Vindicated word of this
[53:29] hour Pentecostals you say speaking in
[53:32] tongues and so forth that was the day of
[53:35] Pentecost that was the light of that
[53:37] hour then see this is another day he's
[53:41] the light of the hour today can I say
[53:46] what a prophet said he did not say it
[53:49] the gift is the light of the hour he
[53:51] said he which is the person which is not
[53:55] a gift but he's The Giver is the light
[53:58] of this hour don't get mad at me I'm not
[54:01] following a
[54:04] gift I'm not following A Gifted person
[54:08] thank I is this okay I believe in the
[54:11] gifts but the gifts have got to be
[54:13] judged
[54:15] right now let's just say what a prophet
[54:18] said he said the G it's amazing homeron
[54:20] gory one time homerline gory told me one
[54:22] time he said brother Andrew he said I
[54:24] find it amazing everybody in the church
[54:25] has a gift till you have a back
[54:27] room he said then all of a sudden
[54:30] there's no gifts he said everybody loses
[54:32] their gifts when you put them in order
[54:34] now come on church either we believe the
[54:35] message or we don't but a prophet said
[54:38] that demonology comes in the church
[54:41] through the gifts open on the floor now
[54:44] you know why that is don't you it's cuz
[54:46] somebody prophesies or sees something or
[54:48] interprets something and they want you
[54:49] to follow it and because it's under the
[54:52] anointing nobody wants to judge it well
[54:55] let me say this a Prophet is not judged
[54:58] if he's a word Prophet but anything
[55:01] outside of a Vindicated Prophet must be
[55:04] judg by the word come on church let your
[55:07] hair down and let's preach a second we
[55:09] used to judge Spirits by the word we
[55:12] used to try motives of men and
[55:14] objectives and directions we used to
[55:17] check it by the
[55:19] message but I tell you what happens is
[55:21] it changes who's doing it and then all
[55:23] of a sudden we change who's checking it
[55:25] let me say this this message is not a
[55:28] respector of persons I don't care if
[55:30] it's a big preacher a little preacher a
[55:33] housewife or a Sunday school teacher
[55:35] we've got to come back to what Joshua
[55:37] taught and stay in step with
[55:43] Joshua I remember I used to say preacher
[55:45] your way out your Lim am I really though
[55:48] I was in I was in a service one time
[55:50] amen one man stood up and spoke in
[55:52] tongues there were three different
[55:54] written interpretations of the one
[55:56] tongue now amen I hope this is okay
[56:00] three different interpretations of one
[56:02] tongue you know what they did Brother
[56:04] they hung the three interpretations up
[56:06] on the bulletin board and the Pastor
[56:08] said now whichever one comes to pass is
[56:10] the direction for the church one of them
[56:13] was about a storm one of them was about
[56:15] a great Victory and one of them was
[56:17] about a was about an issue in the church
[56:19] now I'm sorry I'm not very good at being
[56:21] political or being diplomatic so just
[56:24] don't stupid me you know because I
[56:25] didn't come from from Ahab I came from
[56:27] Elijah I went up to the pastor very
[56:29] respectfully and I said brother which
[56:31] one are we going to follow amen we got
[56:33] three different directions listen
[56:35] friends we don't need three different
[56:37] directions we for the first time have an
[56:40] absolute come on
[56:41] Church brother I tell you what I better
[56:45] hurry I tell you what happens is nine
[56:48] times out of 10 the devil will use a
[56:50] gift in somebody's life to get you into
[56:53] a spirit of confusion and fear and
[56:55] you'll begin to question whether I'm a
[56:57] Believer or not am I doing what God
[56:59] called me to or not but can I say this
[57:01] my identity as a Son of God as a Caleb
[57:05] of this generation is not relying Upon A
[57:08] Gifted person my identity has come from
[57:11] the word of God when I heard the word of
[57:14] God and recognized it was Eagle food I
[57:17] heard from my theophany listen I'm going
[57:20] to keep on walking with Joshua that's
[57:23] exactly right that's exactly right that
[57:26] brother Sean Martin told me one time he
[57:28] said I hope this okay brother Jack he
[57:30] said back when we was in Pentecost he
[57:31] said I needed a gift every day he said I
[57:34] needed my pastor to have a word over me
[57:36] I needed my pastor to see something but
[57:38] when I come to the message he said I
[57:41] finally found a place of
[57:44] stability now it's not a gift it's the
[57:48] giver yes we believe in the gift but the
[57:51] part of God said there's what the
[57:52] evidence of Holy Spirit is is believing
[57:55] the word of God when it's manifested he
[57:57] was the word manifested let me just say
[58:01] this to you when you receive that word
[58:03] into your soul and the word becomes your
[58:06] absolute on your good days you're a
[58:09] child of God and on your bad days you're
[58:11] a child of God when you're sick you're a
[58:14] child of God when you're broke you're a
[58:16] child of God there's nothing the devil
[58:18] can do to change your identity as a
[58:22] child of God
[58:26] see what I'm saying is the light of this
[58:28] hour is not a glare of another age
[58:32] brother said they're living in a glare
[58:33] of another light what is it it's a false
[58:35] light it's a reflection he said you have
[58:37] a mirage you know what that is it's a
[58:39] reflection of the sun on the hot desert
[58:42] and it reflects a false light and makes
[58:44] it look like water and when you get
[58:46] there there's no water there he said
[58:48] that's what a glare is and something
[58:50] that's promising and you never get to it
[58:55] oh my my goodness do you realize the
[58:58] greatest robbery that ever took place in
[59:01] the history of the world was done by a
[59:04] false
[59:05] light brother said a $7 million Scotland
[59:08] yards hold up he said they can't figure
[59:10] it out he said you know how they done it
[59:12] by a false light they put a light on the
[59:15] railroad track I love this word he uses
[59:18] caution on down till it come to a red
[59:21] light and stop them he said there the
[59:24] robbery taken place at the right place a
[59:28] false light gave the greatest robbery
[59:30] that Nations ever know it robbed the
[59:32] nations of the greatest hold up the
[59:35] greatest robbery it was done by a false
[59:38] light he said oh the false lights yes it
[59:40] could cost the church the greatest
[59:42] robbery had ever had cold denominational
[59:45] Creeds brother will not rap in a
[59:47] Vindicated word grain listen friends but
[59:50] the light has come brother said when the
[59:52] light comes he said God has declared in
[59:55] the skies he he's declared it in his
[59:56] word he's declared it on the paper he's
[59:59] declared it amongst the people can't you
[1:00:01] open your eyes and see the hour these
[1:00:04] are they that Testify the truth this is
[1:00:07] the light of the hour he said listen
[1:00:10] with a great watch the great ecumenical
[1:00:12] move it's going into the council up
[1:00:14] there now just forming an image of the
[1:00:16] beast in Revelation 17 exactly what it
[1:00:19] said it would do you Pentecostal people
[1:00:21] going to sit still for that and go into
[1:00:23] it the forcing hour has come
[1:00:27] my God now is the time to rise and trim
[1:00:31] your lamp and shine with the Gospel of
[1:00:34] Jesus Christ and the power another place
[1:00:36] God has a way of forcing the issue
[1:00:39] sometime now you all know the quote by
[1:00:41] heart National Force will put Israel in
[1:00:44] the Homeland National Force will put the
[1:00:46] church in the world Council of churches
[1:00:49] listen but the power of God will put the
[1:00:51] people in The Bride the world forces
[1:00:54] this way and the world forces that way
[1:00:57] but God forces upward my word is spirit
[1:01:01] and life listen she'll recognize her
[1:01:05] position in the word amen praise
[1:01:09] God then she's in Christ will put her in
[1:01:13] her place and no National Force will do
[1:01:17] it the power of God will raise the bride
[1:01:21] right into Glory exactly right let me
[1:01:24] let me tie this up here and say this
[1:01:28] arise Caleb arise and shine for thy
[1:01:33] light is come and the glory of the Lord
[1:01:37] is risen upon thee look at this word

[1:01:42] light of prosperity it is the light of

[1:01:50] Prosper Glory whether soever thou goest
[1:01:53] then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous
[1:01:56] then Thou shalt have good success Joshua
[1:01:59] remembered his commission let not the
[1:02:01] book of the law my word depart out of
[1:02:04] your mouth in other words Joshua I don't
[1:02:07] care what the tribe says what the clergy
[1:02:09] says you stay with this word can I can I
[1:02:15] leave this with you church I don't care
[1:02:17] what YouTube says I don't care what some
[1:02:20] preacher says I don't care what some
[1:02:22] reprobate says I don't care what some
[1:02:24] Theologian says you stay with this word
[1:02:29] for then Thou shalt make thy way
[1:02:32] prosperous look what David said he said
[1:02:34] blessed is the man that walketh not I
[1:02:36] got two minutes in the counsel of the
[1:02:38] ungodly nor standeth in the way of
[1:02:40] Sinners nor sth in the seed of the
[1:02:42] scornful listen his Delight is in the

[1:03:36] instruction and the light of prosperity
[1:03:40] see brother said like this he said what
[1:03:42] is it he said Prosperity always runs
[1:03:44] people that's a hard thing to say but
[1:03:46] Prosperity takes a man away from God he
[1:03:48] said but listen that's what America's
[1:03:50] done is they have turned down their
[1:03:52] heads that's what the church has done he
[1:03:54] said but Lord in our great Prosperity he
[1:03:56] said Satan blowed his poisonous Breath
[1:03:58] Again the days of Miracles has passed
[1:04:00] there's no such a thing as the Holy
[1:04:01] Spirit there's no such a thing as the
[1:04:03] new birth but Lord God he said walk in
[1:04:06] on your promises and show to your people
[1:04:10] that you still live and save them from
[1:04:13] the breath of
[1:04:15] Satan the Lord is with Joshua God Caleb

[1:05:09] would my New Year's message be to this
[1:05:11] people I'm going to speak to and brother

[1:06:06] where he said the land is yours go fight
[1:06:08] for every inch of it he said every place

[1:06:13] be something about this just keep

[1:16:09] seated just for a little bit we
[1:16:11] certainly
[1:16:13] appreciate um brother Andrew Amen on
[1:16:17] tonight and and um he just kind of had
[1:16:21] me going back down U Memory Lane when we
[1:16:24] when I first came in contact with him um
[1:16:27] I believe was there in uh North Carolina
[1:16:31] and we were ministering some meetings
[1:16:33] together and um you know at that time I
[1:16:37] think he was 18 you know 16 16 wow uh
[1:16:43] and uh you know preaching and you know
[1:16:45] and just thinking about you know just uh
[1:16:48] his sermon tonight and just how he had
[1:16:50] to make different stands on the word of
[1:16:53] God to stay with
[1:16:56] what Joshua said and uh as he was
[1:16:59] reading that quote from the church age
[1:17:01] book um it was the angel Lord that told
[1:17:04] uh brother Brandon to pick up his pen
[1:17:06] and write and said let us stand like
[1:17:08] Joshua and Caleb and uh so the angel
[1:17:11] identified it wasn't even brother
[1:17:12] brandom identifying but it was the angel
[1:17:14] that identified who Joshua was and the
[1:17:18] angel identified who Caleb was right and
[1:17:21] uh so the angel told us that it's it's
[1:17:24] Caleb that stays with Joshua Joshua
[1:17:27] would come as an end time leader uh
[1:17:29] which would be the ministry of brother
[1:17:31] Brandon and you know so he just you know
[1:17:34] just I know as there's a a big thing uh
[1:17:38] that hit a lot of the young ministers uh
[1:17:41] but brother Andrew kept
[1:17:44] walking amen and and and I'm I'm very
[1:17:48] very very happy you know just to see how
[1:17:50] the Lord has just um uh brought him
[1:17:53] through all of that and you know just
[1:17:55] also just still using him the scripture
[1:17:58] I wanted to just share uh cuz he walk
[1:18:00] the title was walking in the light of
[1:18:02] prosperity and success and and uh we we
[1:18:05] we receive that as we uh follow this
[1:18:09] message that God gave us and there's a
[1:18:11] scripture that I just want to uh just um
[1:18:14] share 2 chonicles 20 and 20 amen um
[1:18:20] really really quick 2 chronic 2
[1:18:23] Chronicles 20 and
[1:18:26] 20 amen it says
[1:18:28] this um and they Rose early in the
[1:18:32] morning and went forth Into the
[1:18:34] Wilderness of tcoa and as they went
[1:18:36] forth Jehoshaphat stood and said hear me
[1:18:40] oh Judah and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem
[1:18:43] believe in the Lord your God so shall
[1:18:47] you be
[1:18:52] established but we're going Beyond just
[1:18:54] being established we're talking about
[1:18:57] prosperity and
[1:18:59] success and the the rest of the
[1:19:01] scripture says believe His
[1:19:03] prophets and so shall ye
[1:19:06] Prosper so uh you know I I know that as
[1:19:09] we are just following this word we'll
[1:19:11] see amen the benefits that come from
[1:19:15] following a prophet we've already
[1:19:17] experienced those benefits and there's
[1:19:19] so much more that God has uh in store
[1:19:21] for us I I just thank God for the word
[1:19:23] and and I thank thank God for his
[1:19:25] examples amen that the Lord just Ed them
[1:19:27] to just kind of share I mean uh that
[1:19:31] that that that that example of the a
[1:19:33] prophecy go forth in the church and
[1:19:35] three different
[1:19:37] interpretations of one prophecy that
[1:19:40] lets us know that something is not in
[1:19:43] alignment with the word of God now God
[1:19:46] gives the gifts to the church God uses
[1:19:49] God that was a part of the whole
[1:19:51] restoration but it's got to be done in
[1:19:53] order if it's not done in order it just
[1:19:57] creates chaos in the body and and and
[1:20:00] when it creates chaos that's when you
[1:20:02] get people not wanting it around in the
[1:20:04] church because um I hate to say it but
[1:20:07] sometimes gifted people not able to
[1:20:08] subject themselves to the word and if
[1:20:11] you can't subject a gift to the word
[1:20:13] then there's a problem the word is the
[1:20:15] highest thing that we have in the church
[1:20:18] um you know brother random actually said
[1:20:20] that the the closest place uh uh on
[1:20:23] Earth to
[1:20:26] Heaven the closest place on on Earth to
[1:20:31] Heaven is what happens here behind the
[1:20:34] pulpit what is spoke to you behind the
[1:20:36] pulpit so it's very important that we
[1:20:39] keep the word at at in in the highest
[1:20:42] place it's supposed to be and that's
[1:20:43] above every gift and uh and if a person
[1:20:46] with a gift can't say Amen to that then
[1:20:49] there is a problem praise the lord we
[1:20:52] say Amen to this word we thank God for
[1:20:55] it we appreciate brother Andrew let's
[1:20:57] say praise the Lord for our
[1:21:00] brother
[1:21:02] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I'm

[1:30:48] the same level as Paul we see him on the
[1:30:52] same level as Moses and God to be able
[1:30:54] to see things like that according to
[1:30:56] scripture not that we exalt a man but
[1:30:58] Lord we realize what you are doing in
[1:31:01] these men and Paul made a statement he
[1:31:03] said follow me as I follow Christ and
[1:31:07] father that's exactly what we're doing
[1:31:09] in this hour following this word because
[1:31:11] we know you are the one behind the word
[1:31:14] you said my sheep will hear my voice and
[1:31:17] a stranger they would not follow so we
[1:31:19] hear your voice God we see your
