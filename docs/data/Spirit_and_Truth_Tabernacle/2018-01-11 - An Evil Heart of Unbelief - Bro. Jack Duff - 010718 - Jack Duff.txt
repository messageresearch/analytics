things I just needed to make mention of real quick we haven't to hold that we're going to be doing a man with the couple's just asking and all the couples that that do plan to 10 the married couples let me put it that way married couples if you're planning to attend please make sure you give my wife your your name and that way we'll just be prepared for you but if you're planning to attend please make sure if you know somebody that you invited that's going to be attending please make sure my wife has information so we'll be totally prepared for everybody amen I wanted to thank the Lord for our new year service a man we had a wonderful time amen here in the presence of the Lord and appreciate brother Troy a man Sharon is out there with us and I was I was very very blessed a man by that and you know just just seeing how the Lord she's been so good to him it's just a time you I'm very grateful I just rejoice in that and brother smiler came over and he did an excellent job and man just kind of preparing us operating in a limited Ness and you know us and and we're kind of moving into that you know as a brother Caleb coming to take the lemon song now he got he's strategic nine songs that he choosing the saying that you know cuz he's gonna be on that tour in a limited tool and but God been good God been real good to all men made man we're very very grateful for what the Lord is done and there is many blessings that already started flowing the year ain't you just getting started but Amen the fountains a blessing have already start opening up in and we're so grateful to see what the Lord is doing in the lives of his people a mango or it is a good card hey man good all the time you know we just we just ain't the Lord we have a lot a man before say man we're looking forward to this year I wanted to quickly I'm gonna read a quick scripture I want to expect just kind of just the as we start the year off [Music] bear with me just for a few minutes but as we start to Europe I want you to understand what the blessings are all about all right as they're flowing you know and as you get in get get in on some of this I want you to understand what it's all about the blessings are not to keep us earthbound you understand the blessings don't keep us earthbound me they certainly helped us get through here on earth but they're not to keep us earthbound but I want you to just read with me out of a Genesis chapter 13 a man and you don't have to stand I'm going to read this we're preaching a little bit a man happy new year good to see you sister Linda a man and I see [Music] shanise shanise happy leader to you sister Shanice and and a happy belated birthday to you as well a man celebrating last month and she's one of the tortoise of the house and a man is always good good good to see her a man praise the Lord but as the as the blessings okay all right thank you all right sister Samuel so good to see you happy New Year to you as well praise the Lord all this talent we got around this church she's responsible for so we we thank God for her a man praise the Lord a man it's brother Jeff right brother Jeff good to see you again this year happy happy new year - yes sister Shirelles brother a man but just just so that you got some perspective on your blessings and you don't become earthbound the Bible says here in Genesis 13 verse 1 says and Abraham went up out of Egypt he and his wife and all that he had and lot with him into the south and Abram was very rich in cattle and silver and in gold and and what I want you to understand further is that ancient Egypt always represents bondage and things of that nature Abraham had went down in a jiff he wants people to be there he had lied to Pharaoh and said that Sarah was his sister and not his wife but Pharaoh come to find out that that Sarah was his wife and and when Pharaoh found that out he actually went and gave you know he gave Abraham so many blessings right he gave him he left there with a lot of wealth he might have went in broke but he left wealthy out of Egypt and and what I want you to understand is that as we are getting these blessings it's not to keep his earthbound but there's a rapture ahead of us and and I want you to know that before you get out of here you're gonna be blessed I don't know if you caught that but before you leave you're gonna be blessed do you realize that even before the children of Israel left Egypt right before they left Egypt they got some stuff from the Egyptians that they the Bible say they spoil the Egyptians and you know that the wealth of the wicked is laid up for the so God gonna let you taste some of that before you leave here so it's not to keep your time you just need to understand what's going on God just giving you a good taste of what you're getting ready to experience you you're not gonna leave here broke you're gonna leave here wealthy somebody ought to say I receive it in Jesus name a man church we got to understand what's really going us not to keep us here but we just gonna enjoy some of this before we get to the other side amen but we just thank God for all of his blessings and he's just he's just a good god a real real good God good good father [Music] and I'm lap are you hey you a good good father yeah your hands hmmm lab are you yes I am [Music] you are perfect come on sir you are you [Music] singing a game

were prayed a man on his behalf I think he's been having a hard time eating and things of that nature and we know how important it is for you to eat so we want to remember in a prayer a man on this morning and and I was just text something in the office I typically don't like to announce they meant things like this just in case they are not accurate and I want to kind of put that disclaimer in

Lord God didn't endeavor to do your we love father guarded lord rahl minute to You Lord God Lord be with the family Lord God as they Lord go through this tough time Lord but Lord car we know your prophets say that something has to God and something else may live and we all live by dead substance Lord Lord God may your will be done in this situation Lord may somebody received life Lord God through this situation we commit all in your hands Lord God lead us and guide us or God and your name sing in the name of Jesus I pray praise the Lord let's give the Lord a hand to praise stangs already being done just get your Bibles there you all also heard the announcement on the business meeting that we'll have we do it once a year amen the last Friday of every January is our annual business meeting and oftentimes we what we what we try to do is just make everyone aware of the health of the church financially and you know and we we just like for everybody to be here one of the only Friday night sort of try to ask all the members to come it makes them just it puts us all on the same page right when it when it come to things we have so much that we want to do for the Lord and and sometimes you just you don't want to hear it through the grapevine hear it you know just right there on that Friday night so the last Friday this month we invite you everyone to come and be a part of that our annual business meeting and we will we'll go from there I want to read a man from Hebrews chapter three all today and we will just kind of and take a little thought here we've been teaching on Hebrews three for past couple weeks soon and just wanting to kind of go a little further I think just to kind of we're in a very dangerous time you know for for you know as far as Christian is concerned a lot happening we're getting closer to the coming of the Lord we're closer this year than we were last year a man and you know every day we're getting closer and closer to our Lord and Savior returning for us and and there are some things that we should be aware of you know as we just kind of look at little things happening here and there but we we want to it calls us a couple things causes us to be on guard and then secondly calls us to be prayerful right so we want to we want to just kind of talk about that a little bit today if we can let's not read here from Hebrews three and I'm starting in verse seven it says wherefore as the Holy Ghost stay after day if you will hear his voice harden not your hearts as in the provocation and the day of temptation in the wilderness when your father's tempted me proved me and saw my works forty years wherefore I was grieved with that generation and said they do always err in their heart and they have not known my ways so I swear in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest take heed brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief and departing from the Living God right but exhort one another daily why this call today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin for we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end a man the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word let's just quickly pray father we thank you for the ability to read the scripture but we pray the Holy Ghost would make known to us the things that we have need of on today draws closer to you through your word thank you for the anointing that has been here thus far throughout the time of worship and now as we enter Lord into this time of the word pray that you'd have your wake up we take every spirit that's against your spirit underneath the control of the Holy Ghost Jesus then we print ain't man amen praise the Lord so I've been kind of struggling with two different titles here amen I think we'll just settle on evil heart of unbelief a man as our title for today but what what I'm what I'm what mine you'll hear me kind of the inspiration behind this is hardened hearts right hardened hearts and we want to we want to just kind of talk about that just looking at a definition here on unhardened is to make unfeeling is to become bowl in a religion right is to pretty much do you lose feeling right and then you become Bowl in a religion which means there's a hostility that's developed a man or differences developed in religion all right and and if we can just break it down to the message hostility right towards the message a difference a man of opinion and this is this is what the hardening of hearts is glory to God so you have to be very careful as to what you open your spirit to womb up to right because as you if you open yourself up to the wrong wrong thing next thing in your heart just begins to get hardened right you never intended for it to be that way but but but it can happen right it can easily happen and you know evil heart is a heart that is or a mind that is alienated from God all right an evil heart so when we talk about a evil heart of unbelief this is this is a mind that becomes alienated a man you get alienated from God now and the other thing that I want to bring out because when we talk about a hardened heart or evil heart then would also lead us to think about what we what the Bible describes as a stony heart a man and this a stony heart I was looking at a definition on this Estonia heart is a mind that is senseless to divine things I want you to think about that it's senseless to divine things here you know that couldn't nobody do that but gods right and here it's just proven over and over before you that it had to be the hand of God we were sitting here listening to the tape on on Friday night and and when the Prophet begin the counter go and talk about you know I see water I see water I see water and they like well I'm not sure to say I see this this this person standing for them but I see water say oh no you you pray for somebody they not here their cross the water they live in Norway huh how does he know as a man where that person was living only God could do something like that and time and time again it happened in his ministry but yet we would be six lists of divine things be careful because that's what we call a stony heart see we got we got we got to be very careful that the Bible tells us in proverbs 4:23 4:23 says keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life so you got to watch your heart if there's if there's ever time to be careful as to you know just cultivate nothing the ground of your heart and make sure it's just soft and ready amen and receive God's word right you don't need a stony heart in this hour you don't need Amen a evil heart in this hour you don't need a hardened heart in this hour amen you need to make sure it's malleable you know you need to make sure that God can can do something with your heart you need what we call a heart of flesh you want to make sure you got a heart of flesh that God can do something which right say Matt Matthew 5:8 says blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God so you can't have a heart heart and think you're gonna make it to heaven ain't gonna work that with you you're gonna have to have a pure heart before God hallelujah listen you know it says in Luke 12 34 says where your treasure is that's where your heart will be also watch your heart Lori to God see you know these these are things that's very critical especially for the hour in which we live you know I want to just kind of you know we hit this so Nam on tonight but I want to hit it again you know when we talk about this this heart of unbelief you know it's we're not talking about when it's we're not just talking about living in adultery right we're not just talking about smoking brother branham say living in adultery is not seeing he say smoking and chewing and drinking and gambling and cursing now now let me let me help you understand if you got that type of stuff in your heart that needs to be washed out hallelujah Amen because you as you can see living in adultery eventually if you if you keep living like that it's gonna cause your spouse's heart to get hardened right amen you just can't keep sinning right and can't think you're going to get away with it at some point I'm you got to stop your sin right so so here but he said living in adultery is not seeing smoking chewing drinking gambling cursing swearing a man that's another one cursing and swearing is seen let me say it again cursing and swearing is seen if you still doing that you need to repent a man yuji's ascribe us in your presence would you be using them words a man no if you wouldn't use them if he was their president don't you use them when you think he's not president because he's always there right so so so so he says oh you do that because you're an unbeliever that's the attributes of unbelief you do that because you're an unbeliever if you're believer you don't do that that's that's the reason Jesus a he that hears my words and believe it on him that sent me has everlasting life not he's not sick not fast he believes but really believes there it is that takes all your initial evidence away scene out there there you are not he that hears my words and shouts not he that hears my words and speaks with tongues now he that hears my words from has has blood in his hand or in his face or whatever more that's not it he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me has eternal life and shall never come to the judgment for have passed from death unto life now i'm going on to the next paragraph because this is important he says what is sin unbelief that's what city is this unbelief a little something can raise up and instead of going right to the scripture and find out whether it's true or not you say I now see there you go ahead I'll just continue a Presbyterian like I am now be careful with this glory to goddess all kind of stuff going on out there you know a lot a lot of different reasonings and stuff that don't even make no sense but we got to stay with the Word of God watch this he says now say I'll just go and I'll continue Presbyterian like him say go ahead blind and you provoke you provoke God when God does anything when God does anything he expects the nation to grab it but instead of that you know well I don't know about that see he expects the people to get it if you're concerned enough set down with the scripture oh my god I like that because there's a lot of folk they not concern they not concerned enough to sit down with a Bible and go through these things amen even its message is of God oh it's not of God right if we can find it in a barber and we ought to be settled in our spirits that God did this and when God does something he expects the people to grab it now the problem is it's only gonna be very few people that grab it it ain't gonna be everybody because the Bible tells us that he hid these things from the wise and prudent but he revealed them unto babes such as we learn you can have the seat and I'm gonna tell you a baby don't have a heart and heart oh baby oh baby you know if you a baby can get mad scream or yell if you know do everything that that I want to try to get your attention but within about 5 minutes that baby be playing again that baby don't forgot about did you see him know that baby don't forgot about it you know everything that it went through is smiling again and just looking up looking forward to the next day when we gonna be like Dennis Christians honey some of us got stuff in our hearts that we've been holding on for years Oh God see hinders your relationships with people when you get a hard hard hinders your relationship with God when you have a hard heart come on now listen let me let me finish reading you know this he says he expected you you know well well I don't know about that see he expects the people to get it if you're concerned and I've sat down with the scripture go through it and search it back and forth and see if it happen if it's predicted to come to pass and so forth then you'll get it a man see now you know we have a you know we have some issues that are that are in the land today and you know we don't necessarily address them directly but indirectly you can hear you know what what God is trying to try to say to you through that be careful don't allow your heart to get hurt and let me just tell you some of the results of a heart and heart just I mean because you can tell when people moving over towards that right but but when you get a heart and a hurt you think of murder I'm not making it up the first person in the Bible to get a hard heart happen to be Cain and even when God gave him his word gave him specific instruction as to what to do in order for his offering to be accepted Cain took the approach of a hard heart and he murdered his brother so a hard heart would produce murder not only that if you look at the Pharisees and Sadducees when their hearts were hardened all they could think about was killing Jesus Oh hallelujah that's all people can think about is murder trying to get rid of you when they get a hard heart Oh glory to God I want to just kind of yeah I want to I want to work with this just a little bit amen let me let me just read this look whoa here a man this is out of Hebrews chapter 7 part 2 a man a statement that the Prophet makes because you know murder comes in multiple forms [Music] murder murder murder is not always just taking a gun and shoot somebody taking a knife and killing somebody murder comes in a different form oh yeah let's see what the private saying here says and you people with these saw blade templates you people with these saw blade templates and now that we got a bad tip and I will let you that always spouting off in the mouth you can't control your mouth holu you can't take nothing they can't do me that way when they did Jesus that way and worse you people with these saw blade tippers that's always found up in the mouth at somebody can put up and things like that be careful you're guilty if you speak a word against your brother that's not right listen not just go around and tear down it he says you don't have to you don't have to stick a knife in a man's back to kill him you can break his character you can break his character and kill him kill his influence speak against your pastor here say something bad about him you just might as well as shot told something that wasn't right about it well it'll kill its influence with the people and things like that and you're guilty of it that's what Jesus said see now you know you have to be careful Church when you just kind of you know car yourself I'm just sharing I'm just talking you got to be careful because you might say the wrong thing or to god we got to realize that the Holy Ghost is involved in our conversations even when you're whispering in the ear the Holy Ghost heard it oh come on somebody seeing you don't realize that your heart getting hurt that's why you know you know god help me Jesus you know there are things that adults go through that kids don't need to know about can I say that again they're things that adults go through that children don't need to know about some things you can't see in front of kids [Music] because all you're doing is you I mean specially with something you know that happened between you and a person don't let your kid know about that because they grow up with a little heart that's hard towards that person oh my god it can happen just in a simple family Danny momma and children you let something happen between that and momma and it's in us and it happens in front of the children one of them kids gonna grow up with a hard heart towards running up what about one of their parents hallelujah I know what I'm talking about right that's why you know my uncle telling me so you say some some things you are young even just discussed behind closed doors don't discuss that in front of kids they don't know how to handle it you don't know how to handle it and see and not none of that I mean you know you go back to the scripture that the parents that was sitting around in Elijah's day right they just talking about the ball hair prophet little kids that come up with that on a hold they sit around the ball here prophet who we think he is they lost all his hair he mean 40 yet he done lost all this half right I mean that's just giving her a way to go just talking all kind of nonsense and when none of them kids come out one day at the wrong time see the parents knew how to control it behind closed doors but their kids then the wind is head and we're not to see it and when I got in front of that prophet one day something supernatural just happened and and say oh boy hey I mean that's the way they approached them oh boy you got to have respect for God's servants not just respect for God's servants have respect for God's people don't just call your brothers or sisters anything we do just add a little brother on the front of that sister in front of that and yeah I just you know I'm gonna just be honest I don't I don't you know only people really called me by my first name as my family you understand you know my brothers my sisters my mama they come by my first name but you know when we get to this church it should be brother it's just it's just a term of endearment I respect brother Jack Oh sister Soren so right don't be dude is running Erica who are you talking to know when you win it sister Erica yeah see how that sound it sounds so much different right but now if I mamasan Erica okay all right all right yeah but you sister brother come on somebody right I mean if we learn how to talk that way we won't we won't you know what one time I brother car mean he just Jack tell me oh no no no no no no you ain't gonna get nothing from me talking like that you don't you don't you do not approach me that way glory to God see but ever there's a round talking talking about the Prophet and when the kids come out one day it was the wrong day Oh ball go up like your master went up man he only he knew that Elijah was his you know he was following in the footsteps realize just like God like Eli she went oh god like a master winner like now who are you talking to well it just caused a little something to rise up in the Prophet and he called for two she bears came out of nowhere destroy it forty two children now I don't know how many households that represented but forty two kids is a lot I don't think one household had forty two kids but it shows you what was going on inside all those households that's why you got to be careful so you can murder a person a killing they influenced and that's not just the pastor and that that's anybody right at some point time you don't look you might need that person testimony so don't talk about him like that Amen hallelujah well we gonna we got we got we go we don't get a scope on this devil and we got it we gonna set that scope Devils out of here all right now stay with me I'm trying to help us so we don't get a hard heart now that this heart heart it produces a man murder it produces this now I got some other things that I want I want to share with you today that happens with with a hard heart god help me Jesus glory to God we were we were we were focusing on numbers 14 verse 22 through 23 may God said because of all of those men which have seen my glory and my miracles which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness and have tempted me now these ten times and have not hearkened to my voice surely they shall not see the land which I swear to their fathers neither shall any of them that provoked me see it now now what this tells us that your heart can get to a spot where you can provoke God you can get God upset now we want to preach that God as a loving God he is but he also got that gets angry with people right and there are things that we do that can provoke him we want to be careful nice as you know we just went through this on Wednesday and I'm bringing through really quick there were ten times before they entered into the promised land ten times actually for this scripture numbers 14 was recorded because even after that script was recorded there was still multiple times that they steal amen provoke God but by the time numbers 14 verse 22 through 23 have been written there with ten things that God saw that he was displeased with one of those is when after they saw the plagues Exodus 14 they had all saw the plagues in Egypt they saw Moses snake eater the other snakes they saw they saw a water turned into blood they saw darkness settling in Egypt but light in the midst of Goshen they thought they saw these thing they saw the death thing to smite the the firstborn and how God it delivered them and as soon as they Amen they get to the Red Sea they begin to cry about what we gonna do it was better for us to be in Egypt now they saw God delivered him they saw all these great miracles but yet they're they're provoking God with their unbelief listen it goes on when they when they get through that the rats eat then Exodus 15 they get to the spot I mean they were rejoicing and thanking God and praising God for what he did but when they got to exit 15 they got to spot where they couldn't drink the water they start complaining again hallelujah and in complaining God told Moses to take a tree put it inside the water and it'll make the bit of water sweet right and when God did that cop made away from him again but yet they still did not stop complaining they got to Exodus 16 and they're like we want something to eat we meet we we hungry Moses you just can't you just can't take us out here and kill us Moses prays to God God provides manna from heaven not only that God tell them saying with certain days you go out and get this man about on the seventh time and one day one through six get demanding on the sixth day get enough for two days well when they get to the seventh day they still go out to try to get manna listen God was so upset with these people Exodus 17 there was thirsty for water again Moses struck the rock God told miss mark nirach water came forth out of the rock and here you know when it get to this point Exodus 17 that was five times that they had already provoked God in less than one month of leaving Egypt I want you to think about that because you know there sometimes God do this for us and God do that for us and yet we still go right back around and we provoke him with our unbelief watch your unbelief I mean I got that my prayer I pray like the man that came to Jesus and Jesus actually saying sir do you believe and say Lord I believe but help my unbelief because there's times where you get like Lord I think I'm doubting this right now and I know I'm not supposed to be doubting this I suppose have confidence and faith and trust for you I'm not supposed to be darkness we got to watch our hearts in moments like that don't let that devil tell you guys he don't fail you again when you do yeah I'd like to you guess when you got to talk back to the devil God ain't never failed me not one time not one time he ain't never not never you got to tell that devil talk right back to them and see when you start talking to them you create an atmosphere and when God comes through sing a song make up a song I mean this week I made up a song on it he came through again he came through again I'm just a sensation you hear my song saying he came through again glory to God you got to make up a song only that let the devil know whose side you won't listen five more times that they provoked God amen Exodus 32 day they built that golden calf that that provoked God numbers 11 a man they think they were state was in the midst to complain again and God sent fire down and burned up the uttermost parts of the camp they provoked God numbers also numbers 11 the mixed multitude beginning along for some free fish some melons some leeks some onions cucumbers and and the garlic of Egypt God provided him quails after they provoked God and I want I want you to sense I want I want I want you to understand something God just kind of showed me God does not take you from something bad in order to give you something worse can I say that again God does not take you from each of something bad to give you something worse how if you just wait on him he will show you what he has in store for you but he's not taking you from a bad situation to give you something worse he's trying to exalt you trying to trying to elevate you listen so when they left when they left Egypt you know the mixed multitude come along with them they think they talking about the free fish in the melons and the leeks and the onions and the cucumbers in the garlic of Egypt so God had to provide them quails now another thing is when they provoke God is when those dos dos spies went up in numbers 13 they come back with an evil report that provoked God and numbers 14 it's not just to to get an evil report but another thing that provokes God is when you actually believe the evil report it's one thing to get an evil report from the doctor but it's another thing to believe the evil report oh I hope that go home with somebody today it one thing to receive an evil report it's another thing to believe the evil report just because you receive it don't mean you have to believe it you know our prophet taught us that when that devil sent a box with rattlesnakes to your house you don't have to sign for it glory to God ate something I have to take this back because I'm not signing for it I don't know who sent it but it came from Hell is going back to hell right I am NOT silent for this box of rattlesnakes hallelujah somebody see watch your hearts watch watch watch your hearts now there was something that was said here in the message Gabrus instruction of Daniel I want to just hit this really quick because I see hardened heart state they produce certain results one of them is is murder one of them is that and not just murder of a physical person but you can kill their character kill the influenced by the things that you say about it that's murder as well but you know as I was looking and listening there's significant things that are happening in our land today right this this whole thing of the president a man joining Israel oh my god Jordan Israel to acknowledge to roost lemaster capital and you know any say he pretty much said it's obvious everybody Jerusalem has always been the capital now this man this is not a man that really follows God I think he just got saved right before he became president at least that's what when I'm told us right he's a Christian you got have to bear with them they right right before I became president if he said praise the Lord but a man I know this if you are really converted you ain't gonna have such a foul mouth hello somebody well we got a church right here in West Palm Beach all right I'm gonna just leave it like that but but these these things you know when when he when he did that that was very significant I want the church to understand because the u.s. standing up to identify themselves with Israel do you realize whoever blesses Israel is blessed and whoever curses irritant Israel is curse right I mean so so when when they did that that man actually brought a blessing upon not only this nation but even upon himself right so so when when that happened that was very significant and and every regardless of what anybody said right United Nations say we're not gonna I mean it don't matter the Pope can be against it that man put himself in line for a blessing hallelujah now when that happened what what is what is what is what is going to transpire is that the Jews at some point time will re-establish their temple worship I want y'all to stay with Mel and Lauren handler see their reestablish their temple worship but but you need to know that the Prophet told us that before they established a temple work temple worship reestablish it my god before they reestablishes it's that the bride will be gone interruption so if you see them established in Jerusalem as their capital mount I was just there and I saw the land where you know where they said we've given the us this land we can understand for them to build their embassy on this property I saw the land that so we already gave we gave till we just waiting and then they come and bring it here so so when the president announced that they take say my god I was just there I just saw the property that they're gonna put it on right so so when you start hearing things like this other nations will be following suit and it's just it has to happen you want to treat with the u.s. you have to follow suit you want to treat with Israel you have to follow suit it's cuz it's just gonna happen you can't stop it but when it does yes it's going to create some issues but also prophecy going to be for being for field watch me watch watch this I'm saying that for a reason I'm standing for a reason I I'm not gonna have time to read all these posts but I'm gonna tell you another thing the Prophet said you say this message that we listening to is the same message that's going back to the Jews I get I want to read this quote for y'all there was a time brother branham was on his way to Israel he got invited there was some men that had sent some some Bibles and everything and the Jews were saying say you know what if he's Messiah that cares like I'll say yes let him do the signs of Messiah and we'll believe so the brothers say brother Branham oh y'all just bear with me they did not call Billy Graham they did not call Oral Roberts they called William Branham and when it when they said now look they say if they see the sign of the Messiah they will believe Jews so brother Branham was on his way he saved they say he say what a setup I got the quote but I can't take time of you say what a setup because he was on his recently Lord I'm going over here David you know he knew that God had ordained him for certain ministry said so he say I'm going over here because if they see it as I say all of them all of them Jews been converted at one time just one meeting ardent Jews bring diversity Lord this is setup I got to go into this he was in Egypt ancient Lord pulled him to the side it's saying I don't go it's not time yet so it won't Lord they got it all said he said don't go it's not time yet that was not brother branham's ministry to go to the Jews but it's Elijah himself for Moses that's gonna go to the Jews according to the book of Revelation right so the Prophet had to be obedient to the voice of God and not go into Israel now I'm gonna tell you how powerful that was because while I was there in Israel our tour guide and I've told some of you all this already but our tour guide he made a statement he was talking to brother George for the George's brother branham son-in-law and brother George had been told by brother Branham before he passed he says you ever go to Israel the Bible become a new book to you and say hey say okay you know and it was years later after brother Branham was going further George win it to Israel is like man in the same night on went 37 times but the tour guide that he got with this tour guide was you know he said he just started noticing you know brother George and all the people that was come and see these sisters the way that they dress it's a the way that y'all dress unlike our Orthodox Jewish women they dressed the same way y'all dress he said what is it about y'all so brother George they know we just Christians there's no no no no no y'all not just Christians there's something different about y'all what is it the man wouldn't just go for that so he said well you know they start telling the story how you know as the Jews they they have a chair in their house when they have a meal they leave this chair empty and when they leave the chair empty say they leave that they didn't if the youngest boy down the stairs a the lift center about to open up the door say now when we eat our meal we are expecting that Elijah will come and sit in the chair and join us for a meal they say now you go open the door for Elijah the Jews are under expectation for an Elijah to come the Jews right so brother George say you know how y'all sit there you know y'all have that in your house this kind of tradition to you he said but we've Gentiles were also expecting Elijah according to the Bible God was gonna send me Elijah to turn our hearts not have hearts but turn our hearts back to the feet of the fathers he-said he-said he-said he-said he-said he-said well according to the Bible God will come see me Elijah and we received that Elijah it's saying just so happen to be he's my father-in-law they say uh tell you what I'll do here's a tape that you can listen to and you listen to this tape and then you know tell me what you think one Jew heard one tape after hearing one tape came back to brother George and said this man has he ever been here to the Israel like no never he said he's explaining Israel exactly the way it's supposed to be this man has got to be a prophet I want you to understand something this man heard one tape and declared from one tape that this man has got to be a prophet and when I went over there the man was still saying brother Brandon I believe he's a prophet one Jew here in one tape now can't you imagine that brother pranam going into Israel and one sermon like not even a miracle says hearing just hearing a portion of a sermon they would have been done for God and oh lord have mercy God well what I'm trying to get you to see is that if the Jews from one tape one Jew with one tape can identify God's prophet one hallelujah if others heard that same tape what would happen to him right now now I don't get what I'm what I'm what I want you understand that there we're moving into a season where people are getting hard hearts they're getting hard hearts and that happens for a reason because as I said Jintao's hearts become hardened then that opens the doors for the Jews because the Jews heart got hardened before the Gentiles could receive the gospel now the Gentiles heart is also being heart and the Jews are ready to receive the gospel so when you see that spirit you know that we're closer than we think oh my god let me just read something that I gave his instruction to Daniel watch this these are signs these are signs these are the things that you look at the people themselves are expressing that we're in endtime conditions look at this statement and Gabe's instruction Dan your paragraph 152 says another thing when Billy my son and I her brother earned Baxter was on our road to ballast on Palestine after we met the Jews that brother Argan rights and they've seen the meeting Loui pettish has sent these Bibles over there and he said these Jews come set if you will call up a bunch of these leaders of Israel I mean not these new rabbis with all their ceremonies but call the real Israelite leaders together and we have read this New Testament he says and we know that when Messiah cometh he'll tell us these things like the woman at Samaria we know that Moses said our Messiah would be a prophet and when you can when you can tell them and show them by the scripture that that which we will get into tonight's message that they had to be darkened and their hearts cut off so that the Gentile space could come that we'd have a time of reconciliation for the Gentiles and their hearts were hardened just exactly like it was in the time of Joseph and so forth and then bring those Jews to a place and call those men from the audience just like you do these Gentiles hear about the inspiration of the Spirit because they said if if this Jesus if he is the Messiah and your words are true and then he is not dead and he's a lot if he's alive he promised to be his servants his disciples and if we can see him do the sign of a prophet then we will believe that he is Messiah what a perfect thing exactly right then what what would that do a nation would be born and one day amongst the leaders every one of them would say what we know it when that rabbi says that that settles it a nation would be born and one day Israel be born in one day now for the bread it was exactly right we say when the rabbi says it that's right you know some of the the Orthodox Jews some sometimes you can tell the difference then what group they're part of just by they hat one have the round hat one have the square hat and and the reason that they have the round hat and the square hat is because the rabbi said son that's all rabbi said we're gonna wear square so they wear square even the rabbi say round they're gonna wear round if the rabbi say this message is right but the heart hearts don't do that oh god I want you to notice a statement that I caught there in the middle of my read he said and their hearts were hardened just exactly like it was in the time of Joseph and so forth well the brand I'm standing their hearts were hardened now you know Joseph was a perfect type of Christ he was loved it loved of his father hated of his brethren he was thrown into a ditch supposedly dead but taken out so for almost 30 pieces of silver you know all these things but I want you to understand you know some other things because this is what a hardened heart will do Joseph's brothers they were they they you know can I just read a little bit about Joseph's ear Genesis 37 for me Genesis 37 let's just pick this up on Joseph hallelujah these brothers had some pretty hard hearts and we we go see the same thing repeating itself today now y'all stay wit me you have to you have to stay with me all the way to the end because I'm not gonna leave you a man we know people with hardened hearts we know him but they not staying that way I got a promise for him I got a promise and imma just apply my promise hey man Genesis 37 let's just read this a little bit here the Bible says in verse 1 it says and Jacob dwelt in the land where and his father was estranged in the land of Canaan these are the generations of Jacob Joseph being 17 years old was feeding the flock with his brethren and a lad was with the sons of Bilhah and with the sons of Zilpah and his father's wives and joseph brought unto his father their evil report now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children because he was the son of his old age and he made him a coat of many colours now can I just just tell your parents make sure that when you are spreading your love spread it equally amongst your children because if you're not careful you will create problems that's what that's what Israel did by loving Joseph a little bit more than his other brothers Amen hallelujah listen verse 4 and when his brother installed that their father loved him more than all his brethren they hated him and could not speak peaceably unto him so let me let me let me let me let me let me also just interject a heart and heart will produce hate a hardened heart can't speak peaceably a hardened heart can't even reason properly now I'm just I'm just telling what happens with a hardened heart when you start just listening and you just listen to them talk I think they can't speak peaceably oh my everything is hatred I mean this if it was good to you every I mean you you know you know I've learned that even over the years and I just appreciate the prayer that was just prayed there were certain people that's company life where they used to bring you to another level it wasn't all bad you got a lot I mean even when you was in your denomination churches it wasn't all bad so don't have a hard heart ourselves people have a heart of love don't talk so evil about everybody listen you know listen they hated him and could not speak peaceably unto Him let's go on and Joseph dreamed a dream and he told to his brethren and they hated him yet the more so it's the brother branham say that they hated Joseph because he was spiritual I want you to understand these boys are spirit - - they were spiritual look at the dream Joseph we know he was an interpreter of dreams so when Joseph had this dream is not that he didn't know what the interpretation was at 17 he knew exactly what it was but God made that dream so perfect that you didn't need no interpretation these boys was able to figure it out just like that look at it look at it oh my god Joseph dreamer dreaming told his brethren and oh Lord if I could just and Lord I'm praying give these hardened hearts dreams that would be so perfect that it be you don't need an interpreter give them dreams God's something the hearts got with dreams listen Joseph dreamed a dream and he told it to his brethren and they hated him yet the more and he said of them here I pray you this dream which I have dream that before we were binding sheaves in the field and lo my sheaf arose and also stood upright and behold your sheaves stood around round about and made obeisance to my Steve and his brother and said to him Joseph didn't interpret it look at it his brother had said to him shalt thou indeed reign over us or shut our indeed have dominion over us and they hated him yet the more for his dreams and for his words oh my god they can interpret themselves what that dream meant without needing Joseph I want God to make it that plain to some of the hardened hearts it goes on and he dream yet another dream and told it his brethren and said behold I have dreamed a dream more and behold the Sun and the moon and the Eleven stars made obeisance to me and he told it to his father and to his brother not a daddy involved now and his brother and his father rebuked him and said unto him what is this dream that thou has dreamed not like Joseph acts forward what is this dream that I have dreamed share on my mother my brother and indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth my daddy taking on a new spirit with its earth but look at this verse 11 and his brethren in meet him but his father observed the same trying to figure out how it is going to come to pass because God just spoke to you twice about the same thing and in the mouth of two or three witnesses let every word be established I want you to see what what happened here with these hardened hearts because you know after they heard these dreams and they were just upset with with Joseph date they again they they knew that he was loved - the father hater of his brother that's the way Christ was all right and and look at this look at this when after they heard this I wrote this down a hardened heart will conspire to slay heart and heart will conspire to slave even when you're going through in your job there are hardened hearts on the job and they will conspire to slay to get you fired and not even care about you but you have to be Christian enough to understand how to deal with the hardened heart can I tell other thing about a heart and heart they were after they could spotlessly been they were lie about what happened see when Joseph start coming to them to his brothers in the field and they say I said here he come the dream unless let's lay him less and let's see what becomes of his dream and wonder brother stood up Reuben said I don't don't let innocent blood be shed but put him in the pits and when you put him in the pit you know and said say then you know he it was Reuben I did it he would go back and get Joseph out that pit but before he could get back Judah came up with her with her with her with a plan Judas plan was that hey we see some instruments coming left sail Joseph to the instruments like that way we ain't got a snare let's tell them fake conspiring against Joseph you got people that ask us conspire against you oh my I got something I need to say in a second here I love this because Judah is the one that came up with the plan but do you know it's also Judah there later on in the story when they went Joseph had to test these boys hearts to see if God had softened them up a little bit and he put a little cup inside Benjamin's bag intentionally and when he put the cup in the back hee hee he had here a disturbance a not go through all them go through all of them and say the one that got the cup gonna be my servant then boys say that you know we wasn't still none from Joseph you been - good - it's been a family lamb been feeding our families - I got gonna fuses or something like this y'all accused us being spies now y'all accused us of being thieves we not like that so go ahead and go through you know our cover you our bags if you find a cup that man gonna be the servant - you went through the oldest no Cup all the way down got to the last one the baby boy the one that daddy had a hard time releasing to go with him when they got to their baby boy they cut and there was a cup Judah the same Judah that came up with a plan to - to - to put him in a pit is the same Judah not a had his heart chance they look I'll be surety for this boy and say look you came too Kim you gotta take me he became the into Cena it showed that his heart had changed come on you might have a hard heart but God can bust it up God can change it God can give you a new heart in a new spirit Judah got that look at this look at this see ya heart heart work inspired to sleep a hard heart will lie about what happened when they brought the daddy back that that that that robes they you what you think is this your son or not now that heart heart knew it what had happened but a wave the dad had to respond and dad went years in grief because of some heart hearts now heart heart will cash you into a pit a heart heart will sell you a heart heart will reject your gift I wrote this down the Lord gave it to him see you have many people that will reject the gift that God gave you but God got somebody that will accept it Oh so when you when you when you're working you got certain gifts and talents that you're trying to show folk and you got people trying to push you down all the time all you got to do is wait for God he will open up a door your gift will make room for itself and it'll bring you before great men our Lord I hope you understand how hearts will put you in some really tough positions but when God touches that heart cuz I'm gonna tell you when CCBC I love the script I love what Paul say if God be for me then who can be against me and well you got confidence in the god that you served guess what when you're going through stuff you don't allow your heart to get hard because before you know you become spiring you'll be lying you'll be putting people in pits you have many people that will reject the gift that God has given you but God has somebody that will accept it and Joseph didn't find that out too the gap to Egypt but you realized all the difficult things that Joseph had to go through before he I mean here he is in a pit sold into slavery Impala furs house light on and part of his house ends up and Potiphar just so happened to be a man a man that was very close to the king right he worked in the court of the King so so when when it's time for Joseph go to jail he went to the the Kings prison right where people that was that was close to the king that's where they went God was strategically putting Joseph in them places when you read in the Bible I love the way the Bible put a say in and God was with Joseph did you just read the story do you mean me and part of his house and being lied on and God was with me me going to jail and they forgetting about me and God was with me I don't care what you've been through God has been with you away and he's still with you right now that thing is designed that trial of design that tester design the bring God's best oh yard and catch it I'm not talking about your best but to bring God's best out of you he used the trial to get that out of you you know you got to P go to see your reflection in it see when we have to go through the refiners fire and when we go through the finest firemen that they ask the question to the roof on say how you know when to bring it out of the fire you say I leave it in there till I see my reflection in it then I know it's ready God looking for his reflection inside of you don't have a hard heart an evil heart have a godly heart oh my when you look at these things you know Joseph's coming out I mean and I cannot can I just read the out hi Joseph Joseph was accepted let me just read this out of Genesis 41 I think it would be good for you he is rejected by his family they were scheming and trying to get rid of him and everything else but but God had other plans for Joseph and here in Genesis 41 verse 37 Joseph has finally come out of the prison because Pharaoh had had a dream had two dreams and couldn't find nobody and his kingdom to interpret these dreams Joseph happened to be there and Joseph while he was there a man in the kingdom that the [ __ ] not remembered you know Joseph in prison he's a pharaoh forgive me I forgot about this man before I came out you know for you restore it to my place there was a man that interpreted to me my dream in prison and what he told me was exactly right and what he told the bacon was exactly right say forgive me of my air say but this man I think if you get him out of the prison then you know he'll help you with these dreams they sent and they got Joseph and Joseph coming he interpreted the dreams of Pharaoh and look at what happened in verse 37 after the interpretation says and the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of all his servants oh my god see see Joseph had already told him say nine he didn't he didn't he didn't he didn't apply for the position that's not how he did it he said he said he said he say I advise you to try to find the best man you can find to handle this situation you know it's gonna be seven years of plenty but it also gonna be seven years of famine and when that famine come is going to look like the plenty never even happen you say so you need a wise man that can handle this situation and and I can see Joseph say okay y'all got that all right I'm on my way back to prison you got to see him walking back to prison and that's he's on his way back Pharaoh Pharaoh has some words and this is what we pick up here in 4130 see his daddy rejected it his mama rejected it his brothers rejected but God had a pharaoh that would accept this man's gift man he the top man in the organization you understand that this the top man that's gonna accept it everybody else might not but the top man God know how to raise you from prison to power but all the way that happens is that you don't allow your heart your heart to get hard in the process Genesis 41 verse 30 and the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh in the eyes of all the servants of Pharaoh said unto service can we find such a one is this such one this is a man in whom the Spirit of God see I like that you know the reason you are who you are because the Spirit of God has made you that that ain't your gift that's God's gift that he gave you a man and see when even even when Joseph got before Pharaoh and he said I heard that you could interpret instead no no that's not me that do it but it's God that that that dwells in me that does that and if God don't show it to me I won't be able to show it to you can we find such a one as this is a man in whom the Spirit of God is and Pharaoh said unto Joseph for as much as God hath showed thee all this there is none so discreet and wise as thou are and I can just see Pharaoh Paul's action is his service y'all have y'all found anybody is there anybody I mean cuz I asked all y'all and none of y'all said nothing so is there anybody like this land he said we need to find a wise man which I'll think about this so since we can't father wise man I ain't gonna let him go back to prison he's not going back to prison I mean and the man that I was looking for I found him in prison you gonna mistake I found him in a law state the man that I needed I found him in a very large state oh I just love the Lord they don't know they looking for you they don't know what he looking for but you didn't you to answer to the problem look at it there is none so discreet and wise that thou art thou shalt be over my house an according unto thy what is that it'll be like you say shall all my people be ruled only in the throne will I be greater than thou if that imposition in place and I don't know what it is Pharaoh said in the Joseph see I have set thee over all the land of Egypt and Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it upon Joseph's hand and arrayed him investors so y'all got rid of his coat but God got another coat and arrayed him investors of fine linen and put a gold chain about his neck so I always tell the brothers this only time I ever seen Christians where those go change when Egyptians gave it to him but even having on his own but the Egyptians gave it to him right and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had and they cried before him Balvin me and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt see when other folk then rejected you their hearts have gotten hard towards you God has a way of elevating you and when God do it like I told he don't he don't if he bringing you from a bad situation he's not gonna put you and worse he brought him from a bad situation jail but look at where he put him second in charge and Pharaohs Kingdom what a mighty God we serve see I want you to understand every time a heart is hardened it opens the door for somebody else when when the gent when the Jews hearts would harden Paul said we turn to the Gentiles it opened the door for the Gentiles and Josef case Potiphar's house was when his brothers hearts were hardened towards him and Joseph gates Potiphar's house was blessed Egypt was sustained and his family was even sustained during the time of family he went somewhere so when a heart is hardened it opens up a door for somebody else and let me tell you something the heart of their hearts to date of the Gentiles is opening a door for the Jews this message is returning to the Jews because our hearts of the Gentiles have become hard they think about murder they think about lying they thinking about scheming they think about all of it and they get so bad you can't even say brother branham's name don't say that name what what if I said Billy Graham that's fine or Roberts that's fine you know you gather and I'm not I'm not don't get me wrong I'm a sadist but I'm standing in the way I want you to understand the heart and which I'm saying it because you know sometimes as believers we follow the same path as our Lord and as our Lord there in the book of Acts they told them brothers that had come out of prison they say whatever you do just don't stay to name Jesus just don't say his name and be like now we can't help but say what we don't seem it hurt you know we can't help but do that you know they said well whatever you did you just don't say they just don't you just don't teach about Jesus I'm talking about these don't say nothing and and and they was cutting their hearts were heartening with coming against that but we see the same spirit repeating itself today because Jesus hid himself in this prophet and now we get heart heart said I don't want to hear I don't want to hear his voice I don't want to hear his name I don't want to hear wait a minute don't let your heart get that way throwing out the books throwing out that tapes no don't do that don't let your heart get hard when it come to this don't do that don't do that keep your heart in a place where God can do something for you look I've read or robbers books and I got something from it if I went to Billy Graham's place and I was inspired by it I listen to brother Branham completely been inspired so don't throw everybody don't don't don't don't don't don't do that don't let your heart get heart let me let me just finish reading you know something here god I just thank you it's a couple scriptures that I want to read to you a man I let me out before I read that this quote out of the angel the Lord prophet says this says now notice in the old days when God told Moses now you go now I'll send an angel before you keep and to keep you in the way and to bring you into a place which I have prepared beware of him obey his voice for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him that angel was the angel the Covenant which was Christ Jesus the people many of them did not believe it those who did not believe perished those who did believe went on into the promised land and the man who rejected it the men who reject light went into total darkness and I believe today those who reject the holy spirit and the light of God the days of miracles and so forth go back go out back into total darkness did you see how Pharaoh's heart how dark it got he did not have nothing to do no more with the Israelites he showed them no favor because he hardened his heart against the light and men who harden their hearts against the light walk in darkness amen so I'm not leaving I got people that the devil is trying the heart in their hearts but I ain't claiming that they got heart hurts they got hearts of flesh and I'm as i'ma tell you i'ma just talk to the devil right now if y'all don't mind i'ma read this scripture for the devil this come out of Ezekiel 30 36 I believe a man Ezekiel glory to God Ezekiel 36 we gonna start at verse 17 a man this is father devil actually I started verse 16 hallelujah a man see I ain't preaching my family out I'm preaching them and I draw the circle bigger praise the Lord I ain't preaching your family idea I'm preaching your family and it's just a devil and sometime when we share it like this maybe people can see how to devil it's this heart hearts do read the story of Joseph you see what happened with these brothers when their hearts got hardened listen we said moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying son of man when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land they defiled it by their own way and by their doings their way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land and for their idols wherewith they had polluted him and I scattered them among the heathen and they were dispersed through the countries according to their weight and according to their doings I judged them and when they entered into the heathen whether they went they profane my holy name see when we got out there amongst them heathens we did some things we want suppose to do as God's people right they profane my holy name when they said to them these are the people of Lourdes and and and are gone forth out of his land but I had pity for mine Holy Name which the house of Israel have profaned among the heathen whither they went there for saying to the house of Israel thus saith the Lord God I do not this I like this I do not this for your sakes amen o house of Israel but for my holy namesake which you have profaned among the heathen whether you win you know you don't let me down you don't you know you know you don't fail me but but I ain't fail you right this way they say he say you say it say and I will sanctify my great name now you don't you don't you don't profane my name but I'm gonna sanctify my great name which was profaned among the heathen which he have profaned in the midst of them and the heathen shall know that I am the Lord saith the lord god when i shall be sanctified where in you before their eyes then you let me down but imma still use your vessel I'm gonna lift you up out the muck and mire of clay I don't care how low you don't win I'm gonna raise you up from there and I'm gonna use your life as a testimony of my grace he's a good father say when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes where ain't that gonna be something with me when you come back around and let's see what God doesn't deal in your life come on Sunday and look at verse 24 for I will take you I want y'all to understand that when you take something you're not asking permission you're not asking permission I'm taking it it's mine not asking can I have it see and when you got a promise for your loved ones you got going somehow yeah I don't care how low you know I don't care what you're involved with God say I'm gonna take you if I have to give you a dream I'll take you if I have to send somebody to be a prophet a prophet or give you a prophecy out some kind of way I'm gonna take you five to lay you flat on your back I'm gonna take you and you'd be in the hospital table would you play one of them tapes for me I just need an anointing I need an atmosphere God know how to take you this is this is what he said so when I when I'm when I'm resting on what he said I ain't gotta fight I ain't got explained nothing I just prayin committed to God Oh hallelujah for I will take you from among the heathen and gather you out of all countries and will bring you into your own land then will I sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your idols will I cleanse you and look at this verse 26 a new a new heart you're not not not not that's not that heart in heart a new heart sometimes that's all you got this just big alone you know God say you're gonna give us a new heart you me all of us we're gonna get new hearts a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and out here that here it is again I will take away just the stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of flesh and in the nether and I will and I will and I will and I will got nothing to do with it this is all God and when it's all God is Allgood and I will put my spirit even when you don't loan his spirit I will put my spirit within you you turn axe fort is in pray foot but God did it anyway you know what I want to know why God did it because somebody else is praying I will put my spirit within you and when I do that it's gonna cause you to walk in my statutes and ye shall you have profaned before but now it's changing ye shall keep my judgments and do them and he shall dwell in the land that I gave to your father's this message Holy Ghost land given to the fathers ye shall dwell in the land that I gave your father and ye shell and though you don't want to be but you you're gonna be ye shall be my people and I will be your God I like what God's sake could see when God got his mind on you ain't nothing you can do the change is mine I will also save you from all your uncleanness and our call for the corn and we'll increase it no limits no boundaries I see increase all around me and lay no famine upon you sir these are God's direct words so I bring I bring them all right back again I ain't preaching nobody out I'm bringing them back here that's gonna be some people that gonna have Spears suddenly hearts gonna be hardened and and that's just part of it you know that's when Pharaoh Pharaoh's heart was hardened you know God created Pharaoh may Pharaoh for that purpose God made him expect this but specifically to do what he did design him for that God designed me to be victorious design me to be an overcomer he designed me not to have a heart of stone but a heart of flesh and I'm gonna walk in all God got for me I'm clear and and and you know if if Moses was so concerned that when they left Egypt after Pharaoh had his heart so hardened Moses came up with a demand that just don't even make no sense we not we it's not that we you know we've taken our family taking that taking that cattle but if it's a hoof shoe shoe for the cow we taking the cows shoes that mean I ain't giving the devil lovin right I want my kin my cow got shoes I'm taking a cow shoes with me so there's that to you and God honored it to God will honor it then he's honor it now but we're not gonna have these evil hearts of unbelief but we don't believe God let's bring father your word gives us the strength and encouragement that we need no matter how we see the enemy operating we got promises and all we got to do is just hold to every promise that you have given us you've never failed not one word you spoke fell to the ground and returned boy but every word that you spoke has accomplished and those words are bringing forth fruit as well so help us got to hold firm on every promise you promise a new heart you promise a new spirit you promised that you would take our heart of stone and give us a heart of flesh you promised that you put your spirit on the inside of that that's what you said you said you would take us Lord from amongst the heathen you it you wouldn't you it you wouldn't do this for our sake but you do it for your holy name sake and you would you would raise us up right in the midst of those that we were walking with and they're gonna see the testimony of your great grace in our hearts and in our lives where your people were made for your glory we worship You God thank you thank you for the promises that you've given us and thank you Lord that we we realized we had to go through some things but in the midst of going through our
