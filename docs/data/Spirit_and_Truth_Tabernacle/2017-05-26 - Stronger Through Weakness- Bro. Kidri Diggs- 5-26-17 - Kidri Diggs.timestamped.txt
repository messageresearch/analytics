[28:15] wanted to give a short little testimony
[28:17] actually first believe it was Tuesday
[28:21] yes Tuesday I got off work and it was
[28:24] about 6:00 or so in the afternoon and
[28:26] before I left work I'm out in Jupiter
[28:29] and I notice the sky is really really
[28:30] dark and really really black and I'm
[28:31] like okay just I want the rain to hold
[28:33] off until I get home and I had to make a
[28:35] couple errands first and by the time I
[28:38] got to military where I live it's the
[28:41] rain started coming it was pouring down
[28:42] raining so I finally put into my complex
[28:46] and I'm sitting in the car and I'm like
[28:47] okay maybe I'll just wait the rain now
[28:49] maybe the raining stopped the rain
[28:50] didn't stop the rain got worse
[28:52] it was raining so hard I literally could
[28:55] not see the cars next to me or anything
[28:57] in front of me and it was just like when
[29:00] I looked to my left it was two palm
[29:02] trees there but as I'm looking to my
[29:04] left the rain was coming I thought it
[29:06] was a hurricane or a tornado I don't
[29:07] know what was it but all I seen was this
[29:09] black figure coming towards my car and
[29:11] it was just like all the rain and like
[29:13] the debris and everything was coming
[29:15] towards my car and my first thought was
[29:17] first of all my windows one crack and a
[29:19] double stars talking to you like yeah
[29:20] you're gonna die you're gonna die in the
[29:22] car and something go come to the
[29:23] windshield you're gonna die and
[29:24] literally like this black figure kept
[29:26] coming towards my car and my car was
[29:28] shaking and moving and I'm sitting at
[29:30] first I got it man I was like scaring
[29:32] and what was going on then I realized
[29:34] that was the spirit and I had to review
[29:36] that and I was in the car and I'm like
[29:37] no W ain't getting me right now so I
[29:39] started praying
[29:41] I started praying and I was like no I
[29:42] know the master of the storm to win the
[29:44] rain and every single thing the Dove was
[29:46] trying to do i rebuked that and I just
[29:48] kept on praying and praying the prayer
[29:49] like I prayed that this storm ceased so
[29:51] I can go upstairs and go home and after
[29:53] I finished praying literally like the
[29:55] rain stopped the clouds came out and I
[29:58] was able to go upstairs but literally it
[30:00] was a black figure coming toward and I
[30:03] could see his shape and it was just
[30:04] black figure coming towards my car
[30:06] literally a spirit was coming towards my
[30:08] car I was like oh no no no no I rebuked
[30:10] at the name of Jesus Christ I just want

[33:52] I'm going to come just to enjoy the
[33:54] presence of the Lord tonight he'll an
[33:58] aid man well we're not going to a man
[34:04] hold that preacher back we want him to
[34:06] come and just a man have his way brother
[34:09] Diggs does not need an introduction
[34:12] we've all been blessed by his ministry
[34:16] over the years he was kind of coming
[34:18] through this way for something else here
[34:21] in Florida and gave me a call and said
[34:23] well maybe we can stop by on Friday
[34:25] night and say that would be a blessing I
[34:27] mean we love to have you you know come
[34:29] by and just want to accept you just
[34:32] continue to keep him in prayer brother
[34:36] Diggs is one that most yelled he shared
[34:39] his testimony but you know we would just
[34:41] remember time in his life where he was
[34:43] he was working and driving trucks and
[34:46] doing all of that and and I remember him
[34:50] his wife bringing him down this way and
[34:52] the brother Diggs was going through
[34:53] something with his when he would get in
[34:55] the truck and drive his eyes were just
[34:57] shut just just closed on them and the
[35:00] only time his eyes was open is when he
[35:02] would go to the pulpit open up his Bible
[35:05] read the Word of God preached the Word
[35:07] of God and then after he finished
[35:09] preaching his eyes were closed again and
[35:11] I remember him calling me and telling me
[35:13] about a saved man that's that's a
[35:15] condition I've never heard of before
[35:17] I've never seen that but when it came
[35:19] down there was that brother Smiley's
[35:20] Church and he was preaching and and we
[35:23] saw him come out and you know his eyes
[35:25] was pretty much shut and then when they
[35:28] got the preaching his eyes was wide open
[35:29] but soon as he finished preaching and
[35:31] went back and his eyes closed down and
[35:33] we like we just felt so so much
[35:37] compassion in a forum but that weekend
[35:40] while he was they were brothers smiley
[35:41] they went out to eat on Sunday and at
[35:44] Golden Corral and while they were there
[35:46] eating
[35:49] you know brother Diggs is having people
[35:50] go get him a plate and you know I want
[35:52] this and I want that
[35:53] so finally brother smiley told him kind
[35:55] of jokingly he says if you if you really
[35:57] want to eat you have to get up and go
[35:59] get it yourself so brother dick say okay
[36:02] and he got up by faith and he went there
[36:05] and start getting this plate together
[36:07] and when he took that step of faith his
[36:09] eyes popped open and it's been open ever
[36:12] since ain't man
[36:15] it's just simple faith right it's just
[36:18] simple faith but what we realized what
[36:20] God was doing with God God God allowed
[36:23] that to happen to him so he would come
[36:24] off of his job and do his real job and
[36:27] that's preach the gospel of Jesus Christ
[36:29] so a man when we see brother Diggs we
[36:32] see a living miracle a man and and
[36:35] multiple ways God has proved himself in
[36:37] his brother's life and and we're just
[36:39] very grateful you know very grateful
[36:41] just to have them pass this way so let's
[36:43] just start let's prepare our hearts to
[36:45] receive the word Lord let's all stand a

[36:54] little bit of this song your presence is

[42:16] tonight in this place
[42:17] in the name of Jesus Christ we pray the
[42:20] church hey man y'all ready better net
[42:23] come on somebody saying man
[42:25] amen praise the Lord Amen those of you
[42:31] have your Bibles right manless let's
[42:34] turn to UM Matthew the fourth chapter
[42:39] you know them kind of songs are very
[42:42] hard to turn loose you know you're
[42:46] singing about being in the presence of
[42:48] the Lord who is like you and all the
[42:51] earth you know matches loving Beauty
[42:54] endless worth nothing in this world can
[42:57] satisfy because Jesus you're the cup I
[43:01] won't run dry
[43:03] oh my hope who Jesus Christ
[43:09] I wouldn't work what what you know
[43:12] there's another song kind of my heart
[43:16] but it's what a beautiful name it is
[43:20] nothing compares to this what a
[43:25] beautiful name you have no rivals you
[43:28] have no equals what a powerful name is
[43:32] oh my Matthew for this let's start at
[43:41] verse why there was Jesus led up of the
[43:49] spirit into the wilderness to be tempted
[43:51] of the devil if that's something God is
[43:55] being led to be tempted by the devil not
[43:59] my mind why so the temptation what we're
[44:03] about to see is the shows that we can
[44:05] have victory because Jesus was never
[44:08] attempted to lose the battle but he was
[44:10] tempted to wind about and when he had
[44:17] fasted forty days and forty nights he
[44:20] was after a hunger and when the tips it
[44:23] came to him he said if thou be the Son
[44:27] of God command these stones to be made
[44:29] bread but he answered and said it is
[44:32] written man shall not live by bread
[44:33] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[44:36] out of the mouth
[44:38] God and the devil taketh him up into the
[44:41] holy city and seize him upon the
[44:43] pinnacle of the temple and said unto him
[44:46] if thou be the Son of God cast thyself
[44:48] down for it is written he shall give his
[44:51] angels charge concerning thee and in
[44:54] their hands they shall bear thee up lest
[44:57] at any time thou dash thy foot against a
[45:00] stone jesus said unto Him it is written
[45:03] again thou shalt not tempt the LORD thy
[45:05] God and I don't taking him up into an
[45:09] exceeding high mountain and showed him
[45:11] all the kingdoms of the world and the
[45:14] glory of them and said unto Him all
[45:16] these things will I give thee as I will
[45:20] fall down and worship Me and he said
[45:23] unto him get thee hence Satan for it is
[45:27] written that thou is written thou shalt
[45:32] worship the Lord thy god in him only
[45:35] shalt thou serve a man let's go to UM
[45:40] 2nd Corinthians 12 2nd Corinthians 2:12
[45:58] chapter I started verse 7
[46:09] you have a say man and at least at least
[46:14] I should be exalted above measure
[46:16] through the abundance of the revelations
[46:19] there was given to me a thorn in the
[46:22] flesh the messenger of Satan to buffered
[46:25] me lest I should be exalted above
[46:28] measure for this thing I besought the
[46:30] Lord thrice that it may that it might
[46:34] depart from me and he said unto me my
[46:37] grace is sufficient for thee for my
[46:41] strength is made perfect in weakness
[46:43] most gladly therefore I'd rather glory
[46:47] in my father's I left in his father's
[46:50] hand
[46:50] ohhohh most gladly therefore hour with a
[46:55] glory in my infirmities that the power
[46:59] of Christ may rest upon me therefore I
[47:04] take pleasure in infirmities in
[47:07] reproaches in necessities in
[47:10] persecutions in distress
[47:13] for Christ's sake for when I am weak
[47:16] then I am strong Amen may the Lord bless
[47:20] the reading of his word you can have
[47:22] your seats
[47:23] a man praise the Lord
[47:30] tonight I hope you can see I'm gonna
[47:34] take my salt out of those last verses we
[47:36] read strong in weakness amen you know
[47:41] the Prophet preached a message perfect
[47:43] strength by perfect weakness but think
[47:47] about that that just that title what
[47:49] makes your strength perfect going
[47:53] through it in a time of weakness so if
[47:56] you've never had any adversity you've
[47:59] never get any stronger because you need
[48:02] opposition so you can see where you are
[48:05] you need a trial of faith so we can many
[48:08] of them stand you know and you learn
[48:12] something I believe the Lord has really
[48:14] been dealing with me and bringing me
[48:15] through that the only way your love can
[48:18] become perfect as if that love is
[48:21] testing and when you laugh
[48:23] testing is tested in a way that you're
[48:26] not used to living in it so you have to
[48:29] let think about you got to love someone
[48:31] even when you don't agree with him or
[48:34] you have to lower child it may be is
[48:37] going in the world now still your child
[48:39] and your love is testing but the truth
[48:42] but but the strength in that is when you
[48:45] can love that person unconditionally
[48:48] amen and that's what God did for us amen
[48:52] he loved us unconditionally Church even
[48:56] though we were born in sin and we did so
[49:00] many things that were contrary to the
[49:02] Word of God
[49:03] that did not change our God's just about
[49:06] us so touched that you know the
[49:08] scripture also says that you know
[49:11] through the page Christ with who he was
[49:13] made perfect holy so turn we don't want
[49:17] a life of a life that's trow free I know
[49:22] we would love to have that but that's
[49:25] not God's Way man because the Bible says
[49:28] every son and heir of God has to be
[49:30] tested and tried we have to be proven to
[49:33] forgot want to see what's in your heart
[49:35] you know you go back and really do Ronna
[49:37] me in and it different stricter than the
[49:39] Old Testament may begin to talk about
[49:41] you know not only on the other side and
[49:43] God said hey I'll add you this way so I
[49:47] could prove you so I could see what was
[49:50] in your heart to see what's waiting
[49:52] we're going to turn as the pressure came
[49:54] so sometimes that will try you to see
[49:57] what's in you because there's a lot of
[49:59] people in church but the tower care who
[50:02] you really are a man
[50:05] you'll tell you why you love her but the
[50:07] power tell whether you really love or
[50:09] not you tell you hovering you love you
[50:11] it's quite a child tell if you really do
[50:14] that here and so the trial is Deborah
[50:16] stretching you a man and think about it
[50:19] test the Bible say who you count it all
[50:21] joy when you fall into diversity and he
[50:25] said counsel child more precious than
[50:27] what go tried in the fire that means
[50:31] church we are not experiencing just
[50:34] regular child but with the ground
[50:36] there isn't crowds got here we
[50:41] experiencing teens holy that would
[50:44] bright the churches of all you know what
[50:51] because we are coming into perfection
[50:54] and there has to be a perfect strength
[50:57] hallelujah
[50:58] it has to be a perfect strength to pull
[51:02] away from that perfect weakness amen
[51:04] and you don't touch it in this time you
[51:07] know so many people I really I read
[51:09] Matthew the fourth chapter because you
[51:12] look I want to show you how to operates
[51:15] now if you are a user uh a smoker the
[51:22] devil's not gonna try you alcohol he
[51:25] want to deal with the witness honey so
[51:29] you watch you in me you'll see if you're
[51:32] really over it or not and you I hate to
[51:37] say it but real wait till you get in
[51:39] certain atmosphere see you have a minor
[51:42] line up earlier yeah well no present
[51:44] liya you know was a liya before you know
[51:48] we're gonna do the atmosphere weakness
[51:52] and you might think you strong holier
[51:55] but a - no deliverance if there's the
[51:58] Holy Ghost you are in the most trying
[52:01] time of your life and God loves to put a
[52:04] thing so he can show us how strong he is
[52:09] and you know what the enemy does we feel
[52:13] like we weak we feel like we're so
[52:15] unworthy and discourage and all these
[52:17] things well that they say like this and
[52:19] we didn't have no witness what knee
[52:21] would it be for Calvary Whitney would it
[52:26] be for the Holy Ghost
[52:27] what dealing with a people with Jesus
[52:29] just better resurrection if we had
[52:32] everything already locked up so because
[52:35] of our witnesses God kept us on the
[52:38] pawnshop
[52:41] hallelujah but you know churches the
[52:44] reason why I read as I looked at it
[52:45] look at Matthew the fourth chapter
[52:49] I will says you know when Jesus was
[52:52] Mazetti but experience is willing to be
[52:55] gifted of the you you know that one
[52:58] scripture says that God don't give you
[53:01] which one is it huh you know if he's
[53:06] being tempted of the devil and God
[53:08] yielded himself to allow the enemy to
[53:11] give him hugs and you know it also said
[53:14] that God gifted Abraham who are you
[53:17] didn't Bible says when you're tempted
[53:19] only your typical God what is the church
[53:24] well let's understand something by
[53:26] temptation hug God was gifted in every
[53:30] point every matter that you could ever
[53:32] experience
[53:33] why so in your weakness you become
[53:35] strong so God now allow himself to be
[53:39] gifted in every area that we can
[53:42] experience there be a certain area in
[53:44] your life that you can say with that I'm
[53:47] allowed to fall in this I'm allowed to
[53:53] fall in this because you did not feel my
[53:56] pain but my god sis Michelle is so great
[54:01] telling you he will give you an excuse
[54:05] hello yeah he was active you're right to
[54:08] say that the blood of Jesus did not deal
[54:11] with your situation
[54:12] oh yeah the problem of God he said oh
[54:17] yeah they said we tried to make our
[54:20] weaknesses explosive well you know the
[54:26] devil is the devil mainly just in the
[54:28] delegate a lot
[54:30] the devil made me put that on Facebook
[54:32] the devil made me put those Instagram
[54:34] pictures I did like it the devil maybe
[54:39] let's understand something no he didn't
[54:45] right so he got that calipower thank a
[54:50] maker you nothing we were all of you so
[54:54] don't blame it on your weaknesses
[54:56] holy night me on your ability or shelf
[55:00] will because anything we do
[55:02] if we want to do it all without trigger
[55:06] Satan gonna have enough power to stop
[55:08] you fire you from doing good if you want
[55:11] you yeah what I said I said from doing
[55:14] good if you want you oh yeah you know
[55:18] God is a keeper if you want to be
[55:20] captain but this is the thing some
[55:24] people don't want to be capped but I
[55:25] used it only weaknesses and everything
[55:30] looks the messages duct and the message
[55:32] is that and it's heart of thing is you
[55:34] don't see the promise that doesn't look
[55:36] at that and I just don't see it no all
[55:40] the time of you for weakness but that's
[55:44] really an excuse for what you really
[55:47] want to do oh yeah but you know a lot of
[55:52] times people say where the devil made me
[55:54] do it
[55:54] and every entertain they say well let's
[55:57] understand something proper God said
[55:59] honey he said let's see something you
[56:05] see this this is a bottle water can get
[56:09] a man use ain't no trick question just a
[56:14] bottle off a man's a bottle on everybody
[56:18] see this ain't David Copperfield is a
[56:20] bottle off now this paint on the water
[56:26] is up right right it was made to be that
[56:29] way but what happens to the bottle water
[56:31] when I turn it upside down is they still
[56:34] what is it coming out is it coming out
[56:38] now what's holding it from coming out
[56:40] the seal as long as it got a seal and
[56:46] then coming out so tickle your asses for
[56:50] example as long as you got to feel anger
[56:54] you do that folder you can get tough we
[56:58] can get pulled around but if there's a
[57:01] see up anything coming out if there is a
[57:05] seal ain't nothing coming up say you can
[57:08] make you feel like your love you put on
[57:10] your own
[57:11] what if there's a seal Amen coming out
[57:17] in your weakness if there's a seal and
[57:22] then coming out we're gonna be being
[57:28] apart you'll be matched up you can be
[57:31] talked about
[57:32] you mean Idol but as as a seal we can be
[57:37] turned upside down
[57:39] who is as a seal will be shaking it
[57:43] every which way but loose but if there's
[57:46] a seal Amen come it out so the devil
[57:53] can't let you through nothing when
[57:55] there's a seal in your life I really
[58:02] want to show you this tells you because
[58:06] you know sometimes we don't cover we
[58:08] don't know we're coming on we go and we
[58:10] say the devil is to delegate the devil
[58:12] devil the devil
[58:23] it was once recognizable even if it's
[58:27] unrecognizable if there's a seal Amen
[58:32] come in some people say when they used
[58:35] to be as they used to be that but if
[58:37] there's a seal
[58:37] he's fear the same father he just look a
[58:41] little different don't let the devil
[58:46] beat you up in your weakness you are so
[58:50] hello yo booty the telus devil I'm being
[58:54] tired because I got paisa because God
[58:58] will never test anything that doesn't
[59:00] belong to him
[59:03] come on somebody talking
[59:08] the Bible says let the weak say that I
[59:12] am why because there's something in your
[59:16] life that's keeping you I'm not giving
[59:20] myself he's keeping me hugging funny
[59:24] because you know what sometimes you get
[59:25] pressed upon what the seal will keep you
[59:29] sometimes you get knocked around but the
[59:32] sale will keep you he hate the water
[59:34] keeping itself is the sale keeping it
[59:37] inside hallelujah
[59:41] solo use excuses for your weaknesses
[59:45] yes your weaknesses show that you need
[59:48] something greater than you and that's
[59:50] why God comes on the scene because we
[59:52] wants to show you that he's greater than
[59:55] any other thing you can experience but
[1:00:01] what we do we get all shame and you know
[1:00:03] watch it doesn't I did does it I would
[1:00:06] take that to my grave you're gonna die
[1:00:09] and see you and I'm seen and you Diane
[1:00:14] seeing that means you separated from God
[1:00:16] so in your weaknesses in your times of
[1:00:19] adversity
[1:00:20] you should run to God the mall and say
[1:00:23] lord I need you that's what your
[1:00:27] weaknesses are supposed to do that's
[1:00:29] supposed to run you to God not away from
[1:00:32] God further and we've got too many
[1:00:35] people running away from God when God is
[1:00:38] trying to make you stronger honey that's
[1:00:44] what he's doing Church look young man I
[1:00:52] might I might look a little funny to
[1:00:56] some of y'all but don't worry about also
[1:01:01] little weight ah
[1:01:04] there's a little baggie now hallelujah
[1:01:08] in my weakness I become strong
[1:01:12] hallelujah sorry but you know even even
[1:01:17] if you take my testimony working out and
[1:01:20] getting in shape you don't have to tear
[1:01:22] my muscles down to build them up Holly
[1:01:24] if I never feel any pain I'm never
[1:01:28] getting any bigger honey
[1:01:29] I'm never mind my muscles will not get
[1:01:32] me really strong they met seekers when
[1:01:34] you work out if you don't get a barn I
[1:01:37] mean what you're doing is normal and
[1:01:42] then to me that people come to church
[1:01:44] and levels in a bar they're looking a
[1:01:48] burn that'll feel the fire of the Holy
[1:01:50] Ghost which is calm and we sing and we
[1:01:54] go home and you don't get a barn I mean
[1:01:56] you ain't going holy and we are in the
[1:02:01] day but we are supposed to experience a
[1:02:03] bird every time we work out
[1:02:06] and let me say it I just have you not
[1:02:08] getting a burn is because your body is
[1:02:10] used to that particular workout so you
[1:02:12] have to shock it higher you get used to
[1:02:18] the posisorter pastor called evangelist
[1:02:20] and he's supposed to shock you a man
[1:02:22] hallelujah
[1:02:23] check out what we do with easy to shop
[1:02:25] sometimes a man because we've gotten
[1:02:27] used to coming to church we've got used
[1:02:29] to hearing the clothes we got used to
[1:02:31] doesn't loosen it is a plot to get shot
[1:02:34] you know the shock does it takes you out
[1:02:39] of your comfort zone and then when you
[1:02:43] really get shot the real you comes out
[1:02:45] because you don't have time to hesitate
[1:02:48] to think about what you're gonna say if
[1:02:50] you get shocked when you get shot
[1:02:52] sometimes you just react and whatever
[1:02:53] comes out and if a demon see that you
[1:02:55] they really sewing so lightning but if
[1:03:03] this if there's a if there's a sale even
[1:03:11] when you get shocked sometimes
[1:03:12] the right thing oh come on honey
[1:03:16] you see people do things to you like me
[1:03:18] honey no you don't go persecute you say
[1:03:20] Father forgive them

[1:03:25] shocking you like lord have mercy upon
[1:03:28] them honey
[1:03:29] look search we try to make our
[1:03:32] weaknesses excuses Romans 5:8 but God
[1:03:35] commendeth his love toward us in that
[1:03:39] while we were yet sinners Christ died
[1:03:42] for us
[1:03:43] so we have no excuses because he's
[1:03:48] already made a way can't charlie
[1:03:50] so everything that we could go through
[1:03:52] and you know when I look at the
[1:03:54] scripture I want to show you how the
[1:03:56] enemy loves to attack like like I said
[1:03:59] if you are a smoker Holly he gonna fit
[1:04:02] some bottles and James in front you know
[1:04:05] he wants to get you in that atmosphere
[1:04:06] where you're tempted you know I thought
[1:04:08] we were trying to tell our young people
[1:04:10] stay away from the world huh you know
[1:04:12] I'm all right I'm good I'm just a neck
[1:04:14] if you ain't got the only goes your
[1:04:15] nature will easily gravitate to that
[1:04:17] senior because there's a law inside of
[1:04:21] it yourself I won't see oh there's
[1:04:29] something inside of you hariya that's
[1:04:32] that was born to do wrong and it's
[1:04:36] called a kernel nature carnal nature
[1:04:42] borders of the world speaking lies
[1:04:45] Hullinger commit iniquity amen honey
[1:04:48] you're late that's the nature of every
[1:04:51] child born in this world the only one
[1:04:54] bypassed that was Jesus Christ because
[1:04:57] he one more like we were he was born
[1:05:00] according to the spoken word hallelujah
[1:05:04] see so you catch it in the midst of all
[1:05:07] this the word is the only thing that can
[1:05:10] give you strength in your weakness home
[1:05:15] and you know as I look at it turns look
[1:05:18] at this Matthew for said he to be
[1:05:20] tempted of of the devil and so forth and
[1:05:23] like I said you know the scripture say
[1:05:24] that he went to kill Abraham and
[1:05:26] in one place it says you know when
[1:05:28] you're tipsy don't say your tenders of
[1:05:29] God
[1:05:30] well let's deal with the part being
[1:05:31] tempted of God if they don't say you're
[1:05:33] doing your tivity intentions of God
[1:05:35] first of all if God ever allows you to
[1:05:39] be gifted it's not fulfill yeah that's
[1:05:44] why he says when you're tip - don't say
[1:05:45] you attempted of God
[1:05:47] because that kind of him taking he's
[1:05:49] talking about produces failure but we
[1:05:52] went we allowed Abraham to be tempted
[1:05:55] that wasn't for failure that was to show
[1:05:57] what was inside you so bad allowed
[1:06:01] Abraham to be gifted in his weakness
[1:06:05] but what if is trying to produce a son
[1:06:10] and ain't none ever heard he got so bad

[1:07:43] know yeah you like you you might start a
[1:07:48] fire and I can see looking at it in all
[1:07:51] that fear come over that's what stops
[1:07:53] you from coming to God fear in your
[1:07:57] weaknesses because you're afraid to be
[1:07:59] found out let me tell you something God
[1:08:01] already know it ain't no CPD already
[1:08:05] know you just want you to confess it and
[1:08:08] get it right see touch I want you to
[1:08:10] understand something God will not put
[1:08:12] his hands on you with seen in your life
[1:08:15] until not you can have sin in your life
[1:08:18] but if there is a confession then God
[1:08:22] can put his hands on you but as long as
[1:08:24] you were like what you go out ain't no
[1:08:27] better than me in this manner ablah God
[1:08:29] can't do that remember the woman who
[1:08:32] committed adultery and she came in
[1:08:33] talking to brother Brennaman so on so
[1:08:36] forth and she was dying and she know why
[1:08:37] she's got this is her moment of weakness
[1:08:40] when our deliverance was speaking to she
[1:08:46] comes in there and he says you know you
[1:08:48] see the vision you say I seen you in a
[1:08:49] car with a certain man and you're gonna
[1:08:51] rebel tracking you almost got hit and
[1:09:00] she does I'm over the weakness she
[1:09:02] wanted to hide but God was trying to
[1:09:05] make her skull sometimes God will allow
[1:09:09] sickness for glory I got this one out I
[1:09:16] look out
[1:09:17] don't do that holding y'all but I got
[1:09:19] out God will allow sickness for his
[1:09:24] glory put it in my weakness with cancer
[1:09:28] in my brain God revealed to me that he
[1:09:31] was to hover aha so is that that cancer
[1:09:35] I would never know that God was a healer
[1:09:39] and Here I am 20-some odd years with the
[1:09:43] same revelation that God is a healer
[1:09:47] oh he's on change
[1:09:50] so y'all looking at me like really does
[1:09:53] he get he really a castle yes I did
[1:09:56] it's true in my brain but God delivers
[1:10:02] cuz in my hour of weakness
[1:10:05] I need a stress grater and how did that
[1:10:08] stream come Isaiah 53 the strength was
[1:10:12] in the word it wasn't in the operation
[1:10:15] it wasn't in chemotherapy and what did
[1:10:17] radiation treatments cladding taking it
[1:10:19] all I took was biased eyes I'm here
[1:10:25] fiery and the word was a big to hear me
[1:10:29] anytime anyplace anywhere any condition
[1:10:34] any circumstance just speak the word and
[1:10:39] in your weakness become strong because
[1:10:43] God has to back up his word who you
[1:10:48] church is time for us to get the
[1:10:50] revelation of that speak the word
[1:10:55] because God is obligated to his word huh
[1:10:59] but she's old sometimes we're going
[1:11:01] through it you know like I was saying
[1:11:03] perfect loves and always really showed
[1:11:05] me perfect love and you know you you got
[1:11:08] things in your life and you praying
[1:11:10] right now no no please don't let this
[1:11:12] have little peace disabled father I
[1:11:14] believe you Lord please Oh to you please
[1:11:16] please you know that is that's a prayer
[1:11:18] of fear yeah you are Lord please Lord
[1:11:23] please move Lord please move but what's
[1:11:25] motivating that prayer this is fear of
[1:11:28] faith cuz I remember the Bible says
[1:11:30] perfect love casteth out so if you
[1:11:35] really got perfect love there's no fear
[1:11:39] you're able to trust God you're able to
[1:11:43] say you know I found myself doing this
[1:11:45] more so now than I ever did right
[1:11:47] I don't know what's going on but I
[1:11:49] believe that's where I'm at church I try
[1:11:53] to figure it out no more well my
[1:11:55] passing though acid whom I pass don't
[1:11:58] ask him who am i touching agreed on acid
[1:12:00] I'm like loud I don't know what they're
[1:12:02] low but I know if I work out with my
[1:12:03] doula that's what we have to research
[1:12:07] and your witness
[1:12:09] we made strong by believing the
[1:12:11] scripture Holy Church Jesus being
[1:12:19] tempted of the devil in the devil look
[1:12:24] when he comes he comes when he knows
[1:12:27] it's your weakest moment Jesus been
[1:12:30] fasting 40 days and then the Bible says
[1:12:33] and after he hung why didn't he come why
[1:12:39] he was on the fan huh why don't he come
[1:12:45] when you pray when you concentrate when
[1:12:48] you in church like he's supposed to be
[1:12:50] why he don't message it in because you
[1:12:53] can get God more do you hear him honey
[1:12:56] now the Bible says after he says he he's
[1:12:59] homeless
[1:12:59] the hunger came after the concentration
[1:13:02] was over didn't come to them and how did
[1:13:05] the temptation come how did he tempt him
[1:13:07] he tempted him about what he just gave
[1:13:09] cold today you be got turn these stones
[1:13:15] into bread why pray because his weakest
[1:13:18] movement was the fasting he was hungry
[1:13:21] so you wonder why certain things happen
[1:13:24] to you it may be he's just the enemy
[1:13:27] looking at what you're watching on the
[1:13:28] internet you wonder why you can't sleep
[1:13:32] cuz that movie you watching you wonder
[1:13:37] why you have a nightmare because you you
[1:13:46] wonder why you can't sleep it's because
[1:13:51] you opened the door of weakness
[1:13:57] and you get in the prayer line it's all
[1:13:59] leather jacket with me I can't sleep all
[1:14:02] you guys do is stop watching f-feel
[1:14:06] cause all you guys help hold the door
[1:14:09] and the devil is done hollows see he
[1:14:14] started you to find your witness and he
[1:14:16] here poked you by the witness honey
[1:14:20] now if you want now if you want a smoke
[1:14:22] we'll use a drink up
[1:14:23] here you go bring on new how do
[1:14:26] you he's just gonna let you go to one of
[1:14:28] your family me more cookouts you know
[1:14:31] more you dated with you all this stuff
[1:14:35] feelings in my family you know we ain't
[1:14:38] bothering nobody
[1:14:39] and before you got say it's the same
[1:14:43] atmosphere now they got the alcohol
[1:14:46] table in the kool-aid table and then
[1:14:50] they mix it all together because they
[1:14:52] can't keep it separate can't keep it
[1:14:55] separate I got it all cake cake cake
[1:14:58] cake cake but they know my stance when I
[1:15:07] color my housing Dre can nope
[1:15:10] hey real question no but you know they
[1:15:16] so addicted they so weak it's so weak
[1:15:20] they leave it in the car and they tie
[1:15:23] whatever I don't have a good time yet
[1:15:25] Nathan you always disappear you want
[1:15:27] songs alright you got attended at
[1:15:29] weakness but see that kind of weakness
[1:15:33] is really a torment that's a demon see
[1:15:39] one thing you have to realize harder
[1:15:41] that's something that God allowed to
[1:15:43] come on you and then there's something
[1:15:45] that you won't let go
[1:15:51] holy because he said cash joke as a
[1:15:54] bunny oh yeah he says take my yoke olya
[1:15:58] he says his burden is light and so forth
[1:16:01] so God is saying your problems or
[1:16:03] trouble give it to me but one thing we
[1:16:05] realized there's too many people that
[1:16:07] don't want to give up so then that trial
[1:16:11] becomes a torment and I saw that the
[1:16:15] devils old power is there
[1:16:17] he wants to torment you it's something
[1:16:20] to say then take some you young people
[1:16:22] you make your mind up you say but that's
[1:16:25] it
[1:16:26] serve the Lord with all my heart and
[1:16:30] then that young man that you've been
[1:16:32] dreaming about all of a sudden you get
[1:16:34] interested hey girl you doing are you
[1:16:40] thinking like he never told him you a
[1:16:42] full night he talking to me he's
[1:16:44] anointed he dealing with your weakness
[1:16:48] what I want you to catch Satan is so
[1:16:52] crafty his deal with your weakness at
[1:16:54] the same time God calling you and God
[1:17:03] will allow it so he can see what's in
[1:17:06] your heart so he can see which one you
[1:17:08] want the worst the best that's why
[1:17:11] people can come to church calling it
[1:17:13] giving we're live here and go to a field
[1:17:17] God allows you to be a place to hear
[1:17:20] truth hallelujah so you can really see
[1:17:23] you ain't got that but real sustaining
[1:17:29] power hallelujah hey Turk I threw a
[1:17:33] couple back in my day I had me a little
[1:17:38] taste every 90 but when I got delivered
[1:17:43] hallelujah when I got deliver when I got
[1:17:47] sealed
[1:17:48] honey honey it ain't a boy while I was
[1:17:51] pulling up the jeep behind that seal but
[1:17:54] he later hidden church it ain't no
[1:17:57] velvet bag pretty enough
[1:17:59] some of y'all know what I'm talking
[1:18:01] about hallelujah
[1:18:03] can I get a witness it ain't no velvet
[1:18:07] bag pretty enough to make me full one by
[1:18:10] colors because there's a seal there now
[1:18:14] oh yeah and the problem of God huh
[1:18:17] you know you say the devil maybe loses
[1:18:18] every day you say look for the devil to
[1:18:21] get past that seal he has to be your
[1:18:23] brother huh for him to get bad that seal
[1:18:34] God got to be his father and ain't no
[1:18:39] way sinking it past and seal ain't no
[1:18:43] way the devil can get back yet
[1:18:45] hallelujah we go here never confess you
[1:18:48] got the Holy Ghost huh ah
[1:18:53] we'll use that excuse Omo hallelujah
[1:18:57] because judge he can't get past the word
[1:19:01] he can't get back at all you got to do
[1:19:03] is use the word that's all Jesus you
[1:19:05] Jesus could have made fire come on in
[1:19:08] hand out of it loses gotta been able to
[1:19:10] tell but he didn't do anything he just
[1:19:13] spoke the word and the interview was
[1:19:15] dealt with why won't we do the same
[1:19:19] thing speak the word honey and you know
[1:19:23] why and that this message tonight is not
[1:19:40] being preached just for a good sermon
[1:19:43] but there are some of us who have
[1:19:45] weaknesses that we're okay with but what
[1:19:53] we need to seek for is the difference
[1:19:56] because what I love about Paul Paul has
[1:20:01] something wrong on his flesh and he went
[1:20:05] to God about it God announcer he went to
[1:20:08] God again
[1:20:09] garden Elsa he went to God again
[1:20:13] and God answered you know why God acid
[1:20:15] because he didn't pause we'll keep
[1:20:16] coming
[1:20:18] think about that church God asked him
[1:20:22] because God knew Paul will go keep
[1:20:24] coming because he believed that God had
[1:20:28] an answer to all things he was going
[1:20:30] through and our problem is we give up
[1:20:33] too easy we start praying we get
[1:20:37] complacent hello yes sir I didn't find
[1:20:40] myself beating the flow rod I leave it
[1:20:44] out and God don't you know that do I go
[1:20:48] back and I beat the flow again and God
[1:20:52] don't answer and I said Lord you will
[1:20:54] get tired of me beating the floor
[1:20:56] because I need to hear from you that's
[1:21:00] real faith church real faith doesn't
[1:21:03] settle for imagination further you who
[1:21:08] are can imagine look you know what we do
[1:21:10] we imagine with a swell God don't ask me
[1:21:13] any long time and that might be true but
[1:21:17] let him decide that let him decide that
[1:21:21] you will decided you'll keep coming free
[1:21:23] tell you to stop hungry that's what I do
[1:21:27] I keep coming to tell me to stop hurting
[1:21:29] and you don't tell me to stop I will
[1:21:31] keep telling because you know that they
[1:21:34] I think he like that praise and
[1:21:36] adoration hallelujah but you don't test
[1:21:41] when you look at weaknesses and
[1:21:43] different things and feel Paul kept
[1:21:46] coming and coming and Allah say look I
[1:21:48] got this here because there's something
[1:21:50] special about you think about that
[1:21:55] Church God allows certain situations in
[1:21:58] our life God allows some of us to take
[1:22:00] certain paths so we can bring out
[1:22:03] certain things honey
[1:22:05] church David huh Leah Tucker man's wife
[1:22:09] computers adultery all these things on a
[1:22:11] day he decided not to fight and I was
[1:22:17] having it stupid so the doctors too many
[1:22:19] people get relaxed and they lose a will
[1:22:22] to fight
[1:22:23] David the kingdom was looking good
[1:22:25] everything all right and it

[1:22:48] got calibrator here that's somebody else

[1:23:04] thing that makes us fun is a baptism of

[1:23:10] revealed word personally to you that's
[1:23:13] the only thing that makes you strong we
[1:23:15] are not a match for the enemy without
[1:23:18] God and David Claudius is strongest
[1:23:22] times then the kingdom good and

[1:23:36] adulterous a murder premeditated murder
[1:23:40] did all that when he thought he was
[1:23:43] coming but why did God allow that
[1:23:49] because it was something David had
[1:23:53] inside God hadn't got yet Psalms 51

[1:37:59] turn we didn't know how to worship God
[1:38:02] we didn't know how to put in the church
[1:38:06] the one scripture that blows me away and
[1:38:09] this is a law I was going to preach on
[1:38:12] honey
[1:38:13] doesn't the law of faith restored but
[1:38:17] search we have laws of faith that God
[1:38:19] has given us and you got to learn how to
[1:38:21] use those laws and one law of faith is
[1:38:24] that the Bible says God inhabits the
[1:38:28] praises of his people
[1:38:30] inhabited me he dwells and he or by here
[1:38:34] asses in that place that's what his
[1:38:37] there he can't say that is in the book
[1:38:40] now so all I gotta do is give you some
[1:38:42] place
[1:38:43] I mean God tells me he inhabits the
[1:38:48] praises of his people so why we raising
[1:38:52] him go to know God dwells in the midst
[1:38:56] of place he loves to be praised if you
[1:39:01] want to see God get all shook up give
[1:39:03] him some praise
[1:39:06] today happy to do something to him he's
[1:39:09] like a woman being touched by husband
[1:39:11] she see me in two weeks he come home as
[1:39:15] a girl I'm here alone that's ideally you
