night we had a wonderful time and brother Jerry just did a excellent job a man and title last night was a season to prosper and and I'm in that season now I'm receiving that and you know we just we were just blessed you know just by it by the word trying to worship and you know on the statements he made is when you compromise you compensate the devil because when you compromise you compensate the devil say well my god brother that was that was alright I had the right that went down and hold on to it but we don't want to compromise and make any agreements with Satan a man we want to do all that God has called us to do he said a curse can be disguised as a blessing a man they say it's a curse but it's disguised as a blessing say the devil will initiate blessings but there were coming into it and say but when God initiates blessings they are endless and that's a good God brother keep going but he just did a excellent job they men here in the house of the Lord and and and I'm just I'm just very very grateful to see what the Lord is doing a man in our myths appreciate just everyone that was able just to kind of be a part and I have to give some kudos to sister Jessica she had to hold it down by herself and she did a good job she did a really good job and I mean we got into that Baba over on my boy that one that's going bad best that that felt pretty good you know I know but I mean she was playing that on Wednesday night when she opened up the service and I said yeah yes that that we can sing that again on sat on Saturday and just you know just a real real good anointing that was here in this place on last night and my desire my hope is that as we move forward with these services I'll be able to just kind of pass a baton over to some other some of the young preachers in the young Amen song leaders and and you know just just sit and just enjoyed them and just let them take the service say you you do the song leading you do to preach in and then we gonna sit back and just enjoy ourselves in the presence of the Lord and I tell you as a parent there is no greater joy for a parent and to see their children serve in the Lord amen there is no greater joy to see them having the same convictions the same desires a man to follow God's Word that is the greatest accomplishment that a parent can have is the living example and they'll see their children follow that example so we we we were very happy Amen just to see what our our youth was doing there was a testimony that I wanted to be shared today and I didn't hear that I didn't hear the praise report I didn't hear it so we gotta get it a man sister Charisse gonna come in a second and share a little testimony a man praise the Lord but amen praise the Lord and you know just there was a couple of things I won't I really want two testimonies to go forth to team one from sister Charisse and love brother Jerry I need you to just share your testimony that you share it last night you didn't really give everything so just just share a little bit of that testimony again today I think it would be beneficial so I'll have them but before they come on I just wanted to just quickly announce the sister Charisse you can make your way just want to quickly announce you all just continue to keep the sister Rebecca and brother Maurice in prayer they decided to just bring the courtship to a close so just keep them both in prayer as they go forward and on their journey so just want to announce that I announce from this pulpit that they were in a courtship but also unannounced they're no longer a man in a courtship so just keep them both in prayers they go forward and man sister Charisse if you would come brother Jerry if you would following her I want you just to kind of share cuz everybody don't know your testimony a man god bless you praise the Lord I've heard this morning to give it but okay I can try to remember everything but yesterday I graduated and got my certification as a dental assistant I felt like the longest two months of my life but it was good and I praise God and thank him for it um while in school I was well actually the school that I found it really worked out for me it was an accelerated course but it worked out where I was able to be able to work both my jobs and meet the requirements that the school had which was to find an externship site to work and also while there the training that I received there was good the doctor that was there they were really nice to me and just really took me under their wing and helped me and while in school one of my instructors gave us some information about a job that was looking for a dental assistant and when she first was like oh does anybody live in Jupiter the class was like silent and I was just like well I'm willing to drive to Jupiter and always in my mind thinking like I'm not trying to go go all the way Jupiter drive up there for a job but I'm like you know I'll fill out or send a quick email and just submit a resume really quick not really thinking anything of it and I was actually at work when I sent the email and maybe about 15-20 minutes later I got response back from the office manager and we set it up we're on my lunch break I would go for an interview so when I went for the interview we talked everything seemed great and by the end of the interview she was she was saying oh I like you I think you'd be really good fit for the office and she said I can't give you a definite answer today but I'm gonna submit and put in that I think you should get the job so you know I was excited happy a little you know nervous about it too because I knew I was fresh out of school and I didn't think you know most offices want like experience people to work in their office so I mean I prayed but I really didn't you know give my all a because I just didn't think I would get it so maybe a couple days later no Thursday I got the final email from the office actually I think it was one from the office manager and then one from it was like some executive person of this of the dental office and she was like I just wanted to reach out to you and personally congratulate you and saying that we would like you to join our team and it was funny because I was just like oh I mean I got excited they wanted me to actually start Monday and I'm like I can't have to get my job in the two weeks notice and they worked it out where I would actually start the end of this month and there because of the situation where they're having another doctor come in they would only be there three days and the other two days they said they still want me to come in and basically they would train me on the job to meet their expectations she was saying like in a couple of months she's gonna send me to some classes to help me also and I was just really grateful for that because I was so nervous at first about it but it seemed that it was all coming together even down to the pay because the pay that I heard you know that they usually start with I mean I was happy with it I was willing to start with it but then I was like oh I prayed and I was like money and so when I opened the email and I read the late letter they actually paying me almost like two dollars actually than when I asked God to blessing would don't really grateful for that yeah and I didn't know this until yesterday when one of my instructors was talking to me and my mom and she was saying that immediately after the interview the lady her name is Jennifer she called the school and she was like I don't know who this girl is but I want her I want her to work in the office I don't know what we have to do and if she's first I was cool but whatever she whoever she is you know I just want let you know that she belongs in our office and I would like for her to work for us so I was grateful about that is the Lord thank God for blessing my precious sister and just celebrated our 21st birthday a man last week in and then got all this good news and and and the other part to this is that some time ago I don't know who all went but there was a few Saints I don't know if it was a church or over the church okay and they went into it was a concert okay all right they so they went to a church full of concert and I think at the end of it somehow someone prophesied to sister Charisse that night and said that they saw her working in the dental field and and some kind of way to the prophecy hit her but then Sarah got a hold of it and and she started you know down that track and and sister Charisse the prophecy has come to pass a man in her life so we're affected on for that I thank God for that brother Jerry one second before you come sister Alana Axl she could just share a testimony so i'ma let her come and then after after that then you'll come all right amen now I'm letting sister Ellen do this cuz she ain't with us every Sunday so everybody please don't get inspired alright praise the Lord god bless you Church is what it's been a while I'm glad to see everyone it's glad to be I'm glad to be home I am a little nervous I thank God for all the goodness that he has done for me from all my life sometimes he take us through path and we question and like God where are you going with me so I just trust me child I'm taking you where you need to be um I started with my move I was nervous about it but I'm looking at everything that's taking place in my life after my moved I know that God was with me he was directing me and it was just the season for him to do something else in my life just when I knew you know my dad don't speak English because my dad was in Haiti and by the time he came here within three week we didn't find jump for him he moved to North Carolina so right when I move I took him to a doctor um unfortunately the result was he was diagnosed with cancer so it was a great time that I moved to helped him out with the process and you know cancer is something that's very very big not only he has cancer he have other things too like diabetic and blood pressure so his health is always on the scale when you know we we have a lot we have the family in Haiti that we've been trying to get here and we're immigration with troubles harder now so we have been trying it's been over three years and the processes just keep going backward the more backward you go the more money you spend so finally I got the doctor we scheduled to start treating the cancer and you know it was just me and my dad both of us nervous and each time we go he he wasn't ready and the doctor wouldn't do it and it was tough for me too because I've dealt with two cancer family that was close to me sister Sam and sister Eve and I know God can heal at the same time I look at also to plan B of the two people that he took and it was their time so I'm going back and forth I'm like I have my dad if you know we go through the treatment things don't work I need to be oh my goodness how am I gonna do this funeral all the way in North Carolina by myself and not only that back home when you have people back home you are responsible for them even after they get married and have kids so I have seven I have six siblings in Haiti and hate seeing my dad's wife so all that is I'm planning I'm like a god I'm praying but also you know in my back of my head if that it doesn't happen so I'm praying I'm planning and I'm like okay if something happened to my dad I have me and the seven loved ones that there will be my four sponsibility so I got the doctor involved before we had a another schedule to treat the cancer and I asked them please can you write a very nice letter for me have your card everything so I can send it to the Immigration Department so they can see if we can expedite it and he did he would have let us say they need the wife to be present and everything and immediately within three days I got a lot of respond they X but they shipped it to Haiti and everything was approved it's supposed to be here a year ago but Haiti we got stuck and one thing after another did not when we got to the final denied in I mean case closed we start from scratch more money to be spent I called my dad's wife I'm like Stan Prayer this is week if I tell my dad this is denying he might pass out something would take place but you cannot tell him if you choose to tell him just tell me the casket color you want cuz he will die on me so we pray she's really a great prayer where we pray we pray she had an appointment before the cancel cancellation I'm like still go to the appointment by faith so she went i'ma cut my testimony sure cuz I haven't been here a while so a lot of good things has been happening to me so she went to the she went to the immigration and then they just told her okay well we're looking into your case they gave her the visa back when they give you the visa back that's it that's it you're done so they give it back last month I was home my sister came to visit me she heard she herself was with child and that child was to be was supposed to be lost but God blessed her through prayer the baby was less than one pound so when it was time for me to see the baby she came to see me I was off we got a phone call I know all the fake calls you get because I work at the bank I hear it all the time and it was like immigration was like what it was a Miami number and there was speaking Creole and they say they're in Haiti I'm like okay this can be more fake than fake so we listen and they're like is this jean-claude it was like yes it was October the 10th time I believe it was is this Jean Claude we say yes do you have the money to buy the plane ticket well like plane ticket we haven't have a visa interview or to go to the immigration and the lady was like we are the visa Department if you agree you have the money to get them here in two days well we'll call on your stepmom to come and get the visa I was like today's today's look yes how the money yes yes but and then they call them they want to pick up the visa see when God is blessing you it you don't have time like two days the once they call you for the visa I usually takes about three months or four months two days we had to get the family here we did apply for seven and six was approved so I think God because we were the whole case was gonna be denied then we were approved for Latorre by the grace of God six was approved my oldest sister was left behind we're keeping her in prayer but once I got the ticket I call system like I'm coming I'm coming to pick up the family I'm not saying at least only one day trip we came Saturday morning Saturday night we left so I think God for that that's the biggest breakthrough because with any little news I get about the immigration see you learn about love when you when you go through love with somebody that loved you unconditionally any news I get I will hide it from my dad because I was protecting him any little thing that went through it he heard about it he would not eat for two week he end up in the hospital something I can't let him know so I think God that He blessed us it was not the immigration that called two days we had to go backward and we would have been spending about $7000 again just about so in those two days it was God and went inside our office got our profile whoever was sitting in that dance he spoke with them it and told him call the United States this family need to be here so I think God I there's no word there's no thank you I can't tell God because he has spared the Dylan wah family greatly and you I'm pretty sure you've seen the news how Haiti is on the trial that go the unsafety so it's hard for us to every time we hear the different news and we have you know my seven own family for my dad we have them and it's really hard so I think God that I heart is at peace and it was a break a big mountain that God moved for us when they came on foot on another blessing is when they came the house um I have 94 miles so I'm renting and you know the landlord started giving a problem I went if anybody don't know I work at the bank so I went upstairs like man oh my goodness the family's here I need a home he's like come over let's let's do it I did I went and did an application two week ago god bless me I closed on a home of a six bedroom [Applause] so I thank God so it was a quick process I didn't have time working at the bank you know they expedite everything for me it was like within 22 days and I closed on a home I think God were able to get the home cuz you know every step that God try to bless you the enemy always come through stop it so I thank God he made everything was smooth everything went well and I'm just so I'm like what's next God what's next cuz everything happy boom boom boom boom o'night Wow I look up my dad I was like oh my goodness I know I've been praying and waiting and laboring I was like my goodness I beg you he's gonna bless me like that with my wedding because it's like I was so like I'm like literally I'm like dad we don't have two days we have to get these people here what we gonna do with Willie it was a two-bedroom home I'm like we gonna do two days he's like we just need a bit we just need them here we just need them here and then with the home cuz I was building my credit I'm like by 2020 I want to be the first first-time homebuyer and then in 22 days God did it I'm like whoa god is good I think God for all that he has done for me even seeing brother Jerry last night two weeks ago I had my pastor pray with me and I was like I miss being Malad you know going out there witnessing to other people and sometime I lay down oh my god I passed out over 2,000 flyer did I reach souls and you know I'm a soul winner and like and in my pastor pray with me and then last night I was like well at least at least one I know of and I thank God I thank God for not brother Jerry but soon to be a pastor Jerry so god bless you Church I'm happy to be home and I think God for all the goodness that he has done for me and thank you for keeping me in prayer I miss y'all praise the Lord a man we certainly thank God for sister Berlin she is a daughter of the house a man and we just appreciate her that's wonderful news for her to be able to close as well as for a family to get through that process it sometimes when you're looking at things from a American perspective you don't understand the struggle but the struggle is real but uh but I appreciate that sister Juan thank you so much for sharing that brother Jerry hey man god bless you just come share a little bit of what you were telling a writer last night god bless you church how many thanked the Lord for His blessings I know a sister Rolande was speaking it just brought to my attention that um when God is when God is ready to change your season there's nothing you can do about it but it brings me back to the beginning of this year I mean I can start even beyond that but I remember when I was just preparing for my trip and to Israel my trip to Israel and it seemed like so much happened so fast because at the time it was the month of April and I was working I had just picked up a second job and I was I was working so much and all of a sudden things just shifted I had lost my job and then I went and I continued with the journey of going to Israel knowing that I prayed about it and the Lord opened that door so I went and one of the greatest thing that happened was was that I I I know brother Jack he he kept mentioning we're gonna go to this place we're gonna pray write your prayer Nakano on a piece of paper and I took that to heart and I prayed and I told the Lord these things that I'm praying for I'm looking for them to come to pass and as I came back from Israel it seemed like things even got worse but I had a great desire in my heart that I've been praying for that that God granted and and that was to sow seed with with the building fund and it was a sacrifice but I was willing to I was willing to make that sacrifice because I knew that the kingdom of God needed to it needed to grow so I sold that seed and and and and I had those news those those news that I didn't have my job anymore my car I had got into an incident just before going to Israel and my car was still in the shop I didn't have nowhere to go no try rotation and after a few days I spoke to a brother and it was actually brother Josue and he just gave me some encouraging words and then I heard news that I had they had replacement mom they gave me another job it was security so they had gave me another post that was paying more so that was a blessing there and and I was thankful for it but I still didn't have the transportation and with all of that happening I was I was in the I was in the process of starting my school for my barber license and the schooling for that is all the way in Orlando and it was gonna be so such a long drive and and you're talking about not even having a car so it's just seeing nearly like how was this gonna happen I have to go to Orlando I don't have them car yet and and and I'm and I still have to work to to sustain myself and as I just began to pray to the Lord he he it just took a long just took a long time so my frustration the devil was just there to remind me of everything and and that God is not there and and all of these things and I just remember option came to mind and that option was was well maybe you can go to the military you've always wanted to do that and I that that desire just came like a rushing wind and and I wanted to act on it and and because I thought the time was fitting and and I just thought it was gonna be you know convenient for me at the time and the mind um the plan was I couldn't I can pursue those plans later after I'm done so I went to the office a I went to the office the branch I got all the information and and it was it was almost as good as done as far as my commitment but I consulted with some people brother Jack being one of those people and and he just told me to seek the Lord's will but as I began to batter those two those two paths that I needed to take I realized that one path was gonna lead me to the unknown and one path was gonna lead me it seemed like it was gonna be the answer but I had the question myself was was I gonna compromise what the Lord has for me that's when I realized that if I compromise at any time I'll be compensating the devil so I made the decision that I was gonna I was going to neglect I was gonna deny that and I was gonna go with the barber I was gonna go to school and when I made that decision I was around the month of July and there all of that faithfully God had allowed me to come to church every Sunday coming to Bible study and and just making a way out of no way and I've not committed to the Lord it was a Sunday where I just had no way of getting to work I was working overnight I had no way to the point I just called off of work and I said you know I just can't make it tonight and they needed me to be I worked so bad that they had the supervisor come pick me up the supervisor came to pick me up and as we drove to the work we just had such a powerful conversation telling him about the Lord and everything and about the end of that night he asked me he said you know what Jerry I'm so glad I met you I needed to hear all that you're telling me my mother just passed away I just moved from California and and I need you to pray for me can we do that I said yes we can pray so I prayed for him and at that very night yeah the Lord just kind of revealed to me he said you know what whatever you whatever car that your desire and go and get it tomorrow so I went to the dealership you're not not really expecting much and just like that I left that very day with the lot with a with a 2000 17 car so that was a great blessing that I wasn't expected [Applause] and I was able to go with the with the I was able to continue and eventually go to the school in Orlando so it was a drive every week to Orlando by two at two hours and a half and that school itself it was supposed to be about a six-month my program and I went there and within within a month and a half I just started to prayers like Lord it's it's really hard it's kind of you know it's kind of just deteriorating my body and I'm working and I'm still having such a lord I just need you to give me the strength or I need you to bypass the process and within um two weeks later and I spoke to the instructor and she told me she gave me some book so you know I start studying this and it was like study questions for the test and I didn't know why she gave it to me but I think within exactly three months I spoke to her one last time and she told me you're you're you're you're done the time the time has come you know and and she told me I'm gonna give you a certificate all I need is for you to pay the remaining balance so I didn't hesitate I took care of it and when I checked the certificate she had already at those two weeks that had passed she had already made that made the certificate so it was already predestinated plan so I had thanked the Lord for that and going going beyond that with me finishing having just really walking by faith not knowing where I was gonna be placed at what shop brother Mike he owns a shop he owns a shop right right right right near here and when I spoke to him I told him what had happened and it seemed like as the law was working in in my life and in my situation it was working in him because he was praying for a new barber he was praying because he was going through some situations where a barber had left and he didn't know how that was gonna be worked out so I spoke to him he says he said well Jerry you know I I would be more than happy for you to be with us and so much so so much so that he said you know what I like for you to come to the shop yeah I hadn't got my license yet but I had my certificate my credentials were there and he says so much so that I would like you to come to the shop and I would like you to just take a look around get familiar with the customers and things of that matter and I said yes definitely and then he called again he's like you know what brother I want to go all the way with faith and and and I've never done this before but I actually want you to start working III believe that the Lord has brought you all the way this way and we're gonna go by faith we're gonna go all the way with it I said brother I'm receiving that and I'm also receiving that the license is already mine so I started working and and to the very first day and to now I've gotten my license and just to see the how the Lord's favor both myself and him and and and everything around me yeah I've just just been so grateful for that so just just over in regards to last night you know it was it was just such a blessing for me because I spoke about putting a claim on God's promises and I realized often times that we we we can have faith um unconsciously as brother branham said but we we were not intentional about making the claim to the promises that God has given us so I made it a personal thing for me realizing that I'm not gonna shy away from no promises whatever promise of God has made me even by the end of this year I'm gonna believe it and as we all know God is a God that bypasses processes god bless you [Applause] praise the Lord just so grateful for all the blessings of the Lord last night brother Jerry made comedy so he was asking all these different people by this you know journey to the military I said everybody was telling me yeah but one person he said that was brother Jack telling me no and and I I think I shared with him but you know being a young man myself I had those same desires to go to the military but I had a what we call a praying mama a man prayer changes things mama had mama was talking to me but you know not going cuz mom had served in the military herself and she said you know um she said at that time I wasn't even ministering but um she she knew that God had a calling on my life and she said the military is not for a man like you and she just kind of kept saying that but I couldn't hear all that that was mama talking alright so I what I decided to do was just say no you know I'm I'm going on anyway and one day she set me up and I went to church and brother Westco it pulled me in the office after serves I'm like I know I did nothing wrong so I shouldn't be in the office so he say brother Jack I just won't talk to you about this military thing that you want to do and and so you know you know ya plan on going to military sir Air Force I say yeah he say brother Jack all I need the axes have you really prayed about this are you sure God told you to do this and I couldn't tell him yes I couldn't tell him that God told me yes so I see I said well pretty about it well since I couldn't get no answer from God I had to let it go and now and and and that's when you know just recently somebody told me say you say brother Jack you grown you joined the greatest military that could ever be joined when you join the army of the or a man so I'm happy about that I'm happy about that but but I just appreciate the heart it's been it's you know I'm looking back over this year God been good to us

impossible let's pray father we thank you for your word we bless you we found strength and encouragement through the things that you have written to us as we in turn to this thought today we trust Oh God that you would dis minister to every heart to every need thank you for the testimonies that have gone forth and God the ones that were not even told cuz you have been just that good there look it's so easy to just turn every service and to test them on a service because you've been that good we're grateful for all that you've done we look back over this year and so much of things that look like they were trials actually it was a tender hand of Jehovah and God many of us might be in trial right now might not realize it still the tender hand of Jehovah leading and God and directed us to what we need to be Father we want to just lift our precious system in prayer Lord we thank you you brought it through the hospital and got out of the hospital and God should come here to church today in the enemy just attacking her thank you Father for touching her even right now and now we just condemn every attack of the enemy we come against it cuz you told us that what we bound on earth shall be bound in heaven and what we loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven so God we loose your mighty hands to touch her and then between her in her condition we place the blood of the Lord Jesus believing that you were wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace is upon you and with your stripes we are healed God we thank you we bless you now god take control of the thought today's it's presented in Jesus name we pray amen god bless you you can be seated I'll try to preach quick for y'all amen I'll try to preach quick but I just want to take a topic nothing shall be impossible and man nothing shall be impossible let me just start off by reading a little quote here from faith is our victory a man will dig a little deeper in this if we can since now faith is a conqueror a man faith is the victory that overcomes the world what what does it do what is faith what is the Conqueror conquer and victory is the same right it says to conquer it means to beat down a man to override it I see I like that because you know to beat down if you've ever seen something like that you know when a beat downs not just one hitch it's multiple hits and it's time to give a devil not just one hit but but multiple hits it son it's a beatdown hallelujah glory to God amen amen and on top of your enemies are devil not your brother not your sister that your enemy is the devil if we give it a devil a beatdown and if you don't fall with this scripture I'm gonna hit him with another scripture if you don't follow it that script I'm gonna hit them with another Scripture right and I'm gonna keep hitting to that fella fall and we need down I'm gonna hit him some more praise God come on somebody say faith is a to conquer it means to beat down - to override a man to handcuff to throw into prison amen it means that the sin that once rules you you rule it now it means that you have overcome it you've whipped it alright you're greater then it is oh I feel religious right now he says which was first a sinner or a savior he says a savior for Savior is more powerful than a sin which was first the healer or a sickness it couldn't be Amen heal unless it was over the sickness it is a healer it could conquer the sickness and Fae is the victory that overcomes every curse of the devil I like that faith is the victory say faith in what not faith in your church not faith in your Creed not faith in some man but faith in Jesus Christ who made the promise that's the victory what is it it is the victory say my arm is typical but faith is the victory I still feel sick but faith is the victory oh it overcomes the world when you climb into God by prayer until you see nothing conquer to you hallelujah there is nothing can hurt you thin come on somebody say you've overcome you got 50 miles of elbow room you're selling free them now not when you actually get the healing not when you get the deliverance amen but when you catch it by faith in prayer it's yours right then come on somebody you remember how to prophet told us amen it's like having a man needing a loaf of bread right and when you got faith and you need a loaf of bread you bring Brandon asking God to send you that loaf of bread you know and on and as you out you don't have the money or anything like that to get the bread but somebody comes along and gives you the money back then it was just a quarter amen but somebody come along and give you that quarter Amen for the loaf of bread he say you can begin rejoicing you can begin celebrating you can begin worshiping even though you don't have bread but with the quarter you know you have purchasing power come o somebody and if all you got is a quarter you want to give God praise for your quarter because with that quarter they can't stop you from getting what belongs to you hallelujah you just got a quarter worth of faith you ought to start worshiping with that quota hallelujah amen he goes on to say something here he says you overcome you got 50 miles of elbow room you're selling free them you've been a drunken and a slave to whiskey you be the master over him then that old devil out of alcohol that means you drink he's your master now but when you get faith I don't mean make-believe real faith he's your servant Vance he meant you who can't lay down tobacco Amen you women and men when it comes to a place where you can't you where you can get to that spot to where you have overcome it by faith you'll master it then hallelujah and he goes to talk about a little sister a man that 11 yeah let me just read this cuz I think this is this will help somebody it says a little woman that's sitting president now she has been at this altar time after time after time he says a good woman but she started smoking a long time ago and she just couldn't overcome it and she come up and I went pray with her and it seemed like she just couldn't overcome it and the first thing you know our tour I said there'll be danger down the road said she said well brother branham I've cried I've begged you see just emotional now now I want to make sure that we get this the Holy Spirit I feel checked just to kind of save some things here because we've seen people kind of go in and out up and down and they just not really overcome in anything right you know it looked good to come to church but after you leave Church you're going through struggles hallelujah and man after you leave Church you've fallen right back into the same things God delivered you from on Sunday right and every time you do that you make your condition worse and the way to tell this lady say now it's gone if there's trouble waiting for you down the road if you don't settle that thing there is trouble waiting for you down the road look at this he says he says there'll be danger down the road she said well brother Brandon I've cried I beg you see just emotional fighting the air that won't do any good and I get down and pray with her and lay hands on her and she go back and in a few days I meet again just knocked you down with cigarette smoke hands still brown I like the way he's putting this because we all we all see the same thing he said one night down yonder she went to a doctor began to get sick and widowed him - just a little smiley thing and the doctor looked into her and he said cancer smoking cigarettes there she was laying there to die then she got down to business hallelujah see a drowning man will reach for straw as long as you can a man oh my god a drowning man will reach for straw now you know a strong can save you but because you see the strong floating you think if that's floating then maybe I can float with the strong but as soon as you touch the straw you do you bring the straw down but a drowning man will reach for strong look at this now he says long as you can walk out of this church tonight or should I say today and know that you can go join the Methodists or Baptists as long as you can sit in here say now I'm a good person there's nothing wrong with me yeah you can't do anything well you can't do anything with you I like that right as long as you got that type of attitude God can't do nothing with you he say but when you see your sins as God sees them in the light of his Bible when you see your repent or perish something will take place you'll get down to business walk out of here and since in smothering around your heart the doctor back there the world maybe or maybe raise raise raise up come up and look and say it's a heart attack you'll get to business that's when she had to get to business and the woman said hey look in here looking at me now and I like the way just you know brother branham brings that about this particular sisters in the congregation cuz we got a lot of folk they'll go up and down but when you leave here after you receive the word in your heart and you've made a confession you got to walk out and live a victorious life a man you can't you can't go back to the things God delivered you from you make your condition worse if God deliver you from smoking don't go back to smoking if God deliver you from drinking don't go back to drinking if God deliver you from a relationship that's hindering you huh don't you go back to that relationship hallelujah somebody Amen I want God to live you stay delivered and sometimes in order to stay delivered you got to change your surroundings the people that you yourself hang with you can't hang with no more the places that you used to go you can't go to no more hallelujah somebody Amen that's how you maintain victory all right all right now there's some things you guys to do because the Bible say lay aside every sin in every week that's always a possession you can't pray and X got to take it from you you actually have to lay it aside all right glory to God I just want to a man just kind of encourage your heart here a little bit but you know as we're approaching a man Christmas glory to God we're approaching Christmas and I'm looking at this say man from a different angle today says you know I'm thinking many people preparing for holiday parties a man some of y'all might even have some that y'all got to go to hallelujah a man they're preparing for holiday parties what they might call Christmas socials a man and notice the word Christmas socials amen the name Christ is actually in Christmas amen now we realized that it's really not about him anymore we know we know that they've taken Christ completely out of Christmas some places they got Xmas they've taken the Christ part out amen but we realized that it never really was about him we understand that by revelation a man it was it was a pagan tradition that was introduced but like brother Brown say it's here to stay amen and we're not gonna get rid of Christmas glory to God hallelujah somebody a man ain't no sense and fight that you ain't getting rid of it glory to God I've seen many families destroyed because we got this revelation rights come on somebody a man we don't we don't took some stands that we probably didn't need to take brother brand was ours he was an example to us in many ways glory to God somebody and I know people don't want to preach all the message they only want the parts that fit they doctrine hallelujah I am a stay out of that but there's a balance even in Christmas and you can find the balance in Christmas but but what I want you to understand is that it should be about Christ right it should be because because when we think about Christmas Christ is actually in that all right he's saying that now what I'm thinking about many a prepared for the holiday parties prepared for the Christmas socials prepared for the gift sharing hallelujah someone can't wait they know we get out of this night early telling people what we want it ain't even your birthday glory to god I'm gonna leave it alone I'm believing alone it ain't here's either ain't nobody ain't nothing well hallelujah why we got the go through all this and I can see if it's your birthday but it ain't even your birthday and you got a list telling people what you want all right now I must stay I'm gonna stay away from it y'all y'all said brother Jack get out get out and now some of y'all saying stay right there brother Jack you save me some money glory a man say but they think they give Sharon and the other thing that surrounds this is to drunkenness amen the other thing is the drug use right Eman many other sinful activities that that are supposed to be that celebrating the birth of the Lord Jesus a man that ain't got nothing to do with God somebody need a deliverance amen at Christmas rather than a mint getting involved and stuff like that most will fail to stop and think what is this season really all about what is it all about a man that the pagan original Pig in origin amen but I like the fact the one thing that I like is that this is an opportunity for us everybody amen to all over the world to reflect and think about the real reason for this season everybody have stopped to stop and think about it's all about the birth of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ let's pick up a scripture here Matthew 1 amen verse 18 Matthew 1 and verse 18 this is about the birth of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ stay with me here just for a few minutes I'll go as far as I can and then maybe I'll pick up some more on next week a man hallelujah Matthew 1 look at verse 18 says now the birth of G of Jesus Christ was on this wise when as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost hallelujah amen then Joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privately can I just inject something now I was trying to save it to next week but I don't know if I'm gonna get a chance you know when Adam came to his wife before he could actually get to know her she was already pregnant amen hallelujah and Adams wife was pregnant with death come on somebody because the day you eat thereof is the day that you die so before Adam could actually get to know his wife she had already been pregnant with death but before Joseph could get to know his wife she was already pregnant with life hallelujah somebody glory to God hallelujah a man a man a man let me just go and I'm gonna try to stay away from that I want to talk about them to wolves ain't ma'am but not today not today Amen nothing shall be impossible as our subject today says then Joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example was minded to put away privately but watch this but while he Oh on these things behold the age of the Lord appeared unto Him in a dream saying Joseph thou son of David fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife but that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost now you know Joseph having this experience in a dream with an angel actually coming to him and saying these things that was still something that was very difficult for him to accept because you know here he has to take this woman that's already been pregnant by-and-by and her testimony is that our angel told me this now you got imagine walking around the city with a woman as telling this testimony and I angel said this this is very difficult for Joseph to kind of stand by her side this is my children's thinking I need to put her away but but you know the thing I think that settles not just that the angel came and said that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost the angel says something else in the next verse and this is what I feel like when God speaks to you his word that should settled you a man when you get a revelation from the word come on somebody when God speak out of his word that should give you give you a peace that passeth all understanding look at the next thing that he tells Joseph not my verse 20 says but while he thought on these things behold the age of the Lord appeared unto Him in a dream saying Joseph thou son of David fear not to take any mayor that wife but that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost and she shall bring forth the son and thou shalt call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins now all this was some that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the Prophet saying behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel which being interpreted is God with us now in that part right there here that was actually referring back to a scripture in the Old Testament amen and I believe if Joseph was shown scripture from the Old Testament then he can identify himself with Mary and not amen be impacted by whatever everybody else had to say the man knew that he was standing on the word and when you know when your faith has been anchored on the word I don't care who come against you I don't care if the doctor come against you I don't care if your powers come against you whoever come against you will fall at your feet because you standing up something that cannot fail hallelujah glory to God listen then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the age of the Lord had bidden him and took unto him his wife and knew her not to she had brought forth her firstborn son and he called his name Jesus now you know when we talk about this season Jesus was the reason for the season amen if people are gonna do all these celebrations and all these other things make sure they include the Lord Jesus Jesus meant yahweh is salvation' his name meant yahweh is salvation' and I was just kind of you know just thinking on this because you know when I just reflect on the scripture in Luke nothing shall be impossible a man I just I just just began to really reflect on this and you know just thinking through this season and everything say to the birth of our Lord should actually settle all doubts as to whether God can do what he promised you I want to say that again the birth of our Lord should actually settle all doubts as to whether God can do what he promised you amen glory to God I want you to understand you know the scriptures say for with God nothing shall be impossible the birth of our Savior the birth of our Redeemer our Lord and our King was an example of nothing shall be impossible Oh glory to God a man hallelujah it was his very birth was an example of nothing shall be impossible and man his birth was a miracle because a virgin actually conceived his birth was a miracle right I was thinking to myself we ought to just call timeout whatever you got going on just call timeout and think about this his very birth was a miracle a virgin actually conceived look at it a man not only was his birth a miracle glory to God but but but even his death on the cross was a miracle because after he was buried he did not remain in the grief amen it tells us that he borrowed a tomb and what the word bara means is to take or obtain with the promise to return the same or equivalent I'm only borrowing this because i'ma give it right back hallelujah and he bought the tomb because he wouldn't need it for long glory to God He is risen and the reason we know that is because he's doing the same things he did while he was here on the earth his birth was a miracle his death was a miracle and his life was full of miracles you know remember that the Bible says that his name was going to be called Jesus and I preached a sermon some years ago about Jesus Saves because Jesus the name Jesus means yahweh is salvation' now I was just thinking about you know just some of the things that went just the first miracle when you turn the water into wine a man that was there was a miracle yahweh is salvation' Jesus Saves and as I thought about him turning the water into wine I thought when your supply is running dry Jesus Saves when your supply is running dry Jesus Saves a man I thought about when he fed the 5000 as well as the 4000 again when your supply is running dry Jesus Saves all right when he walked on water when he calmed the water I thought about when death is staring you right in the face because that's why the disciples when they got on the boat and they begin to go across to the other side and they saw the stormy seas amen they won't even stop to say carest thou not that we perish think in the face of death out there in the stormy sea but when they woke Jesus up and when expect them to go to the tip of the boat put his foot on the tip of the bump saying peace peace deal it showed that Yahweh what salvation Jesus Ange listen when the man at the Pool of Bethesda and the woman with the issue of blood see when the doctors have said they can do all they can do and there's nothing more they can do for you I want you to remember Jesus still saves all glory to God that woman could go to another doctor she had run out of money but when Jesus passed through the town she said if I could just touch the hem of His garment I know I'll be made whole when that lady touched His garment she received Yahweh's salvation let me go a little further when blind bartimaeus had his opportunity amen in the presence of the Lord Jesus it was it was the last chance that he had Jesus was passing that way he would never come that way anymore physically on the earth he would never pass that way any more blind Bartimaeus beginning to cry out and I'm gonna taste some when you get desperate you'll get down to business a man like bombard my romance got down to business he began to cry out it was his last opportunity call on Jesus and when he called on Jesus hallelujah he found out that Yahweh was salvation he was saved from his blinded condition Jesus Saves hallelujah Legion was delivered I like this glory to God because when this man was you know I thought about him he was healed he lost right nine he'd been ostracized from society a man and this is something when you mail start coming to the graveyard when the mailman got to deliver your mail to the graveyard you know you in a bad condition but it's okay when you get in that condition Jesus still saves no matter what you no matter where your life is that Jesus can save you right there Yahweh is salvation [Applause] Winnie raised the day Lazarus in the sin and the widow's son a man from name I wonder I just want to let you know tonight I mean today that nothing is impossible Jesus still says even if you facing death he can raise them up from the dead Oh glory to God Jesus still saves now I set this my God because I wanted you to just kind of look at this on today with me as week this descriptor and Luke 1 for with God nothing shall be impossible I don't know what you're facing I don't know what you're facing I don't know amen how difficult your situation might be but when you get the context of the scripture glory to God with God nothing shall be impossible nothing nothing nothing shall be impossible I mean this the context of the scripture the way those words I just read you one verse right that's all I did was reaching one verse but if you were to go back a man that the straightest story is is that Mary before before Mary situation a man there was an angel that visited Zachariah in the temple and told him that his wife was going to have a baby hallelujah and that Zacharias in the temple he began to kind of doubt about his wife being able to have this baby but the problem is is that Zachariah doubt it and he had other examples in scripture that he get referred back to they say if God did it for them then I know God can do it for me and I want to tell you some whatever you go through if you have an exemple said before you that God done did it for somebody else then you know the same God has no respect of persons and he'll do the same thing for you nothing is impossible Oh glory to God and I like the way this time eclipsed I mean whatever you can think of right now I want to tell you it's not impossible I'm going through this brother Jack not impossible brother Jack you you ain't hurt by this not impossible I don't care what it is it's not impossible that's why the angel said nothing and he did not mix his words nothing shall be impossible Zechariah a man he can look back in scriptures see now now now Abraham the father faith it happened with him a man I remember Hannah at the temple she was barren and she had a child I mean he had people that he can refer back to but yet he chose to disbelieve i'ma tell you something it's dangerous very dangerous to disbelieve God Zachariah when he disbelieve God see I'm gonna tell you stop talking that down start giving God but but but but God don't want to hear but but but but but the doctor said but this one says but but God don't want to hear none of that hallelujah God just want to hear me man God you said it I believe it and I accept it that's all God want to hear glory to God but as Zechariah a man was was down and he said now look you're gonna go home you're gonna have a son Amen your wife come bearing our old age and what's gonna be said not because you doubt it you not gonna be able to talk you're not gonna be so you just have to scribble things down to tell them what you know what uh what he wanted what he wanted them to know but as he's there you know going through this trial here uh Elizabeth is pregnant and uh you know we pick up something here in verse Luke 1 verse 26 we pick up some because she's five months pregnant by this time and here loop 1 verse 26 it says and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God on to a city of Galilee named Nazareth Oh mom - a virgin a spouse she was engaged to a man whose name was Joseph of the house of David and the Virgin's name was was married now you know I want to just kind of inject a few things here glory to God oh my god now now Mary was a true seed of Abraham not just from they not from the spiritual sense but naturally she was a true seed of Abraham if you go back over to Matthew 1 you start tracing the genealogies you'll see that Joseph was a part of the genealogy amen coming down from Abraham Oh glory to God and back in those days I'm gonna just have to put it this way back in those days a woman could not marry outside of a tribe Oh y'all let me preach y'all let me preach amen a woman could not marry outside of a tribe now I had something here that I want to just kind of read on that so y'all just y'all just bear with me okay yeah all right so and understand something because you know we can't apply just carnal thinking to this back in that they kept it pure back then and God still wants us to keep it pure today they could not marry outside the tribe so that made Mary a physical immense seed of Abraham physically not just spiritually but physically she was a seed of Abraham now if you're part of a tribe that means that you was a the word tribe means an aggregate of people united by ties of descent from a common ancestor amen if you're a part of a tribe amen it's an aggregate aggregate of people united by ties of descent from a common ancestor amen a community of customs and traditions glory to God so back then they had to stay within their tribes when they got married read between the lines they had this thing within their tribes when they got mad at the birth of Jesus it was still that way all right now glory to God they had to stay within their tribes that's the way that God gave them that Lord ain't all about it by that long hallelujah it kept a lot of problems down praise the Lord Church a man is the truth in it how right so so you know I want to show that Mary was a physical physical seed of Abraham now that some things that Mary did being that she's a physical seed there are certain qualities that kind of go along with Mayer's testimony let's just read it here in the scripture glory to God a man can't camp before I go forward amen and I think I'm at verse 28 let me just give you because Abraham had seven qualities the first ones he called things that be not as though they were in other words that when he was against hope he still believed in hope all right and another one when he was weak in faith he considered not his own body which was now dead and when he was about a hundred years old he considered not his condition another thing he didn't even consider the dentists of his wife's room whew Sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief the sixth thing Abraham was strong in faith and while he was strong in faith he was giving glory to God and the seventh day being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able to before I'm gonna tell you where you had in your journey glory to God some of y'all are you against hope you still believe in hope and man you even though you're weakened you weren't you're not weakened faith you're not considering the circumstances a man not only your circumstances but those around you're not considering their circumstances but where you're lacking a man also say he's thinking not the promise of God through unbelief but where you're lacking is being stronger faith in giving glory to God what we need to learn how to do is give God praise before it happens glory to God you gotta praise God on what you see because as you start praising him on what you see you're gonna bring what you see into reality Oh y'all ain't with me today glory to God somebody she was a physical seed of Abraham and she applied these same hate these same characteristics to her trial watch this verse 26 28 I'm sorry and the angel came came in unto her and said hail and and and what that word hail mean is rejoiced right hail thou are highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed are thou among women I see wonder what in the world is going on here amen and when she saw him she was troubled at his sing and cast in her mind what man of salutation this should be oh my and the angel said unto her fear not now coz when you ever come into the presence of an angel like this you trembling for your life right but but when he speaks those words fear not it settles you glory to God I wish that no matter a man and whatever you're facing a man today that you can just hear the angels speak fear not because nothing is impossible look at this fear not o glory amen vs. verse 30 says an angel senator fear not Mary for thou has found favor with God and the whole thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus now I want you to get this when we really think about what happened the world is celebrating and I won't tell those of you that don't know Jesus was not born on December 25th it wasn't that's a pagan thing that came when the the you know the pagans got introduced to Christianity the pagans used to celebrate the Sun God's birthday and when Christianity got mixed with paganism the Christians took a stand now we not worshipping the Sun God so the pagans compromised and when you compromise you compensate the devil sososo the christian said we're not worshipping the Sun guy so the pagans say well okay we won't worship the Sun God but we still want to do this festival around December 21st 22nd 23rd 24th would we want to do it somewhere around there winter solstice so that's seven on December 25th that's the day that we won't worship the Sun God but we will worship the Son of God that's how we got Christmas it's here to stay I'm not telling y'all don't buy no presents I'm not telling y'all you can't you know you can't have no Christmas tree but I will

resurrection all right come on Church these all pagan things that have come into Christianity and we just we just embrace it way nothing wrong yesterday is it's a lie praise God all right all right let me go on hallelujah all right where am I okay verse 31 it said behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus now I want job this is a timeout moment because this is what Christmas is all about it took a miracle to get Jesus here this one's just some ordinary birth it took a miracle to get him here it was the fulfillment of Scripture and I can't go through all the scripture you know that today but but it was a fulfillment of promises that God had made amen throughout the ages in and here was that the time of the manifestation and and and as we look at this he say and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth the son and shall call his name Jesus and he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne is of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing I know not a man now she's got questions I see chicken chicken I mean she could she could hold a testimony Oh glory to God before the agents say I'm a virgin I kept myself until I got married amen now I'm engaged to be married I'm gonna I'm gonna concede my heart this thing gonna be now look at it look at it he says verse 25 and the angel answered ascended her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of God now she wonder how this gonna happen but the angel has an answer don't worry the Holy Ghost gonna take care it is you wonder how you gonna overcome the Holy Ghost gonna take care is you wonder how you're gonna get to the next the Holy Ghost gonna get you there Oh glory to God listen and I love this verse 36 and behold thy cousin Elizabeth look at this church she has also conceived a son in her old age and the angel put emphasis on certain pieces here she's conceived a son in her oh it's because Mary know that Elizabeth ain't never had no child and Mary knows how impossible this would be for for Elizabeth to have a child but the angel amen in this-this-this Salutation er begins to build her faith the reason he shares Elizabeth testimony Elizabeth was in hiding he let nobody even knew what was going on he lives but they angel reveal what had happened to Elizabeth to marry in order to build Mary's faith oh my god watch this he's building there's faith now now Elizabeth Street and behold I come see Lizbeth she has also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren oh my god I like this because now when the angel is there talking with Merrin just trying to get her to see because I need you to understand something there was no way that Jesus would have been able to come to the earth had Mary not received the promise in her first womb which was the womb of a spirit when she accepted the word that brought forth the manifestation and I'ma taste something you are never going to get anywhere with God and till you receive his were in your first wound that's the womb of your spirit when you when you receive it there then you'll bring forth the manifestation of what God has in his promise worked you still battling a man with what he promised you you got a stop better than that and start accepting it if God said it that settles him well howdee stays gonna be say look you know the Holy Ghost got what was shouting you and then not only that said I want to encourage you your cousin Elizabeth that's in her Oh H she's pregnant right now with a child now Mary begin effects tonight if Elizabeth can get pregnant in her own age hallelujah then I believe then this thing can happen to me now look at look at look at what happens here because the very next very next statement after he tries to build her faith it says but with God like that Mary I know you're a virgin I know this is never have see Mary got nobody in Scripture to look back to Elizabeth can look back but Mary got nobody now what have you facing something that nobody has ever faced I want to tell you something that if you are facing that with God then nothing shall be impossible Oh y'all I don't care what you're facing nothing shall be impossible you got a doctor's negative report nothing shall be impossible if you need a job God can open up at all even if you lack degrees that does not limit your God because nothing shall be impossible if you're unable to have a child because of some condition in your body nothing shall be impossible if you need an approval all alone nothing shall peace coz I'm standing in need of an approval and I say nothing hallelujah I want to put emphasis on it nothing absolutely

nothing nothing nothing that includes everything nothing shall be impossible nothing praise God nothing [Applause] are you somebody nothing is impossible it took a miracle for Jesus to get here and when you think about what the angel said Mary had to receive that into her spirit and when she received it that's when it brought forth Christ he had to build a faith to get her to level when she realized you're still young your cousin oldest she is getting ready to have it not only getting ready she's six months pregnant I'm at a stand I got time to read it just stay with me yes to keep standing keep standing don't sit down I'm gonna tell you something when Mary got the news that Elizabeth was pregnant after she told her angel being unto me according to thy word that was her receiving it that's when that's when she got pregnant when she received a word Mary immediately went to Terra testimony oh my god this because if you got a revelation today whatever you're going through that nothing is impossible the first thing you got to do is like Mary go tell somebody Oh hallelujah son find somebody to testify - hey and Mary went running down to Elizabeth house she went to testify and he lived live got excited when she saw Mary coming and Mary began to say I was visited by an angel and the angel told me that she was pregnant and age also say I might have a baby and the angel said I should name the baby Jesus and Elizabeth was standing there and when she heard the name Jesus she began to have a little revival alaric shorten took place she said my baby was stillborn had not moved in six months but when that baby heard the name Jesus Sean begins to leak to give the screen John was ready to come out right then you're dead situation will change when you
