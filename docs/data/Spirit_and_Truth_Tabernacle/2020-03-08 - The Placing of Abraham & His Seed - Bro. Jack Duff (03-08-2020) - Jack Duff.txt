a man and we thank the Lord for that the god is a good god a man God is a real good God and we just we just appreciate him so I want to read a few scriptures here this morning Ephesians 1 and then also Galatians 3 and 4 and if you all just bear with me on some of this a man a lengthy read but I believe it would be a blessing to us a madness 1 Ephesians 1 and want to start at verse 3 a man in Ephesians 1 praise the lord says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation the world that has that's the beautiful part of what Paul is writing to us a man God had a purpose in his mind before we even got here right and and and if I could just tell you your mistakes could not stop his purpose your failures and all it couldn't stop God's purpose this all happened before you were even old glory to God a man says according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love these are powerful scriptures mouths words and what we have to do you know the Satan is the accuser of the Brethren and it's Satan's job to accuse you constantly constantly a man about things you did and mistakes you made all that but the scripture says that we're gonna be holding without blame before him Satan we not standing before you this is before him Satan didn't have no blood to wash us with lose us from our sins but our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ not only loosed us from our sins but loosed us from the memory loosed you from the memory of when the devil keep bringing it back up you've been loosed from the memory glory to God it's time that we recognize who we are a man a man a man a man glory and he says having predestined us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of His grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace wherein he hath abounded towards us and always and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed and himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times that he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him praise the Lord I want to read also from just turn back there to Galatians and just a couple verses from Chapter three and then will flow right into Chapter four here in Galatians a man that started here verse 24 Galatians three says wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ that we might be justified by faith but after that faith is come we are no longer under a schoolmaster for ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus for as many as for as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ there is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither bond nor free there is neither male nor female for ye are all one in Christ Jesus and if ye be Christ's then are ye Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise going on into verse 1 chapter 4 now I say that the air as long as he is a child differeth nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the Father even so when we were in children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of the time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because you are sons God has set forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father wherefore thou are no more servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ amen if you all don't mind just one more place of scripture here out of Genesis 17 a man tell you what I'll read this up I don't say a word afraid I'll let you be seated but I want I do want to read this just hold this in your hand let's pray father we thank you for the word of the Lord that has been read to our hearts and God we pray that you'd help us to hear what the Spirit wants us to hear today be glorified and magnified we take every spirit that's against the Spirit of God underneath the control of the Holy Ghost even right now and just thank you Lord that we have the opportunity to come and to gather in this place to hear the Word of God speak to us Lord and only way that you can us in Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you can be seated praise the Lord so Genesis 17 I want to just read here this would be our found foundation pretty much we want to speak on the subject the placing of Abraham and his seat amen the placing of Abraham and his seed and here in Genesis 17 the Bible says and when Abram was ninety was ninety years old and nine the Lord appeared to Abram and said unto him I am the Almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect and I will make my covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly and Abraham fell on his face and God talked with him saying as for me the whole my covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations a man neither shall thy name any more be called Abram but thy name shall be Abraham a man for a father of many nations have a mazy and I will make the exceeding fruitful and I will make nations of thee and Kings shall come out of thee and I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee and their generations for an everlasting covenant to be a God unto thee and to thy seed after thee I thank God that he is our God my man and I would give unto thee and to thy seed after thee the land wherein thou art a stranger all the land of canaan for an everlasting possession and I will be their God amen so just using that kind of as a foundation here we want to use the subject the placing of Abraham and his seed the placing of Abraham and his seed and I just want to start with a quote out of the message adoption part for if we could just go there praise the Lord amen the Prophet makes a statement here too he says tell me my brother tell me my sister when was the time that the sons of God was ever to be manifested outside of this time now a man when were there ever time in the history manifests the time to deliver all nature that nature nature itself is groaning waiting for the time of the manifestation and I've preached the sermon before from that scripture in Romans 8 where where nature itself is groaning for the manifestation of sons of God but you know as I was doing a little research on that it's not just the word manifestation but its nature stuff is groaning waiting for the revelation of the sons of God and what that means is that it's wait for us to come into an understanding glory to God of who we are amen nature's actually waiting on you to come to your understanding right and I and when we look around with all the things that we got going on and a man everybody's afraid of the virus amen everybody's so afraid and you know for folk doing all kind of things that you know they don't want you to get near them they wanna want you to wear Mac's they want to wear a mask they everybody's living in fear hallelujah glory to God but but God has not given us the spirit of fear he made a thousand may fall at my side ten thousand over here but I have a promise and the promise says to me that it shall not come nigh my dwelling he ain't gonna touch me it ain't gonna touch my children eating untouched nobody it ain't gonna touch the church Amen we have a promise all we gotta do is set on the Word of God his word came feel [Applause] you know out there we had a little video there that we start where a man say he was going to challenge you know the coronavirus they say the Lord sent him the challenging and he was going to China to challenge it and and when he got a China ended up in the hospital amen this melon came a man we not dare to challenge the virus but if the virus challenges us we're not running trying to find the virus challenges we are standing on the word we're standing on the show foundation God's working say [Applause] man if you want the cure you need to be you need to have the blood of Jesus apply it was in the days of Moses and they had the blot applied and those that had the blood applied the Death Angel passing by so if you want look you come underneath the blood all right all right all right hey man we're not looking to try to create no news headlines here that we stopped Corona whatever it is not we not not praise the Lord Amen but it won't come now dwelling I say that much Amen all right let me finish reading this because he says nature itself is groaning waiting for the time of the manifestation why before the atonement was made before the Holy Ghost was ever poured out before all the Old Testament on down there couldn't have been manifestation he says they had to wait to this time now all things that's been brought coming shaping up to a headstone to the manifestation of the sons of God coming back and the Spirit of God coming into these men so perfectly until there ministry will be so close like Christ till Allah join him and his church together that's where we are Church that's what exactly Amen what we're looking for them the Holy Spirit coming into this group of men so perfectly until their ministry be so close like Christ it'll join him in his church together let me go on a little further here a madness message church order the Prophet makes a statement here a man that I just want to bring to you it says in his quote in Romans 5:1 he says we believe in justification by faith Romans 5:1 we believe that after a person being justified by faith he has peace with the Lord Jesus Christ that scripture it says but it's possible Amen that this same person could have habits such as drinking and smoking now they've been justified but they're still carrying habits bad habits glory to God glory glory glory amen the Holy Ghost is supposed to bring us beyond our habits the Holy Ghost supposed to break your habits amen that way when the Holy Spirit comes into your life you know you no longer live the same life you used to live a man now it's not your life but it's his life can you see Jesus smoking can you see Jesus drinking can you see Jesus doing some of the things that we do those habits must be broken listen since I is possible that this same person can have habits such as drink and smoke and doing things that it should not do filthy habits of the flesh then we believe that the blood of Jesus Christ sanctifies this person for the service of the Lord we believe in sanctification according to Hebrews 13 12 and 13 where Jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate and we believe that sanctification is talked in the New Testament and meant for the believers through the New Testament age which we're now living so we're supposed to live sanctified life hallelujah justified lives saved the fight lives and lies that I'm feeling the Holy Ghost see this is my brother Troy was kind of sharing you know in one of those Wednesday night sermons he was preaching you know people get a man a new spirit is ready did a new heart we get a new spirit and then the Baptist or Holy Spirit suppose are coming to miss that we get a new spirit and we stop right we get a new spirit and we stop we think we got it all hallelujah like my brother brother brother brother Danny I believe the one mentioned what age have we lived in that people can't explain when they received all they go you ought to know where the change took place right everybody I don't know where that change took place in you know so so what happens is that people got a new spirit but didn't go on to get the holy spirit look Amen that probably goes on and he makes the statement here it says we believe that sanctification is taught in the New Testament and meant for the believers through the New Testament age which we're now living we also believe that after the person has been sanctified now look at that I love that I love the statement after the person's been sanctified unclean habits has gold from the person sanctification by itself I'm taught my true significance it will take a bad habit from you you don't even have the Holy Ghost but sanctification will take your bad habit [Applause] hallelujah somebody Amen we want to make it real we want to clinch it in in and in the body of Christ right signification itself so take the bad habits away yeah save the case yourself to take the bath salts away yeah think that the case in itself just stopped you from hanging with certain people even without the Holy Ghost Saint vacation should be strong enough to do that see if saying the case stays down that a is something wrong somewhere but signification Amen unclean habits on gold from the person so if unclean habits are not going you can't claim that you've been sanctified a man Church Amen you can only claim signification when you see them habits cone unclean habits total unclean desires ago then I've been sanctified by the blood of Jesus Oh hallelujah see we're not just using words to use words this much produce a life that's it before we can see Amen the manifestation of Jesus in us we must produce a light justification says I just as if I'll never did it before but same dedication actually washes you from Amen the habit loose issue from the happiness well let's go on a little further he says he is a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ and his habits are cold we believe that and he is a candidate for the baptism of the Holy Spirit which comes as a feeling of the believer he says just as many times as I've talked like picking up a glass out in the chicken yard and you know I'm a go on I would just I'll just share I'll leave that quote there I won't read any more it's you know brother Branham says I'm picking up the glass in the chicken yard say now when you pick up that glass it's filters got filthy habits right it's filthy now just because you pick up the glass of dirty glass told me you can use it anybody come presents you a dirty glass lady you don't want to drink from that even in the restaurant when they give you a dirty glass you sit it back if you'll send it back what you think the Holy Ghost so do if you try to present to him your dirty glass you want God to drink from your dirty cup right insane but you picked up you notification it's actually picking the cup up that sucks which case you just pick the cup up but in your mind you got purpose for the cup just just a sample eat up some little I got to use the cup but before I can use the cup I gotta take it through a process every book God can you chew he's got to take you through a process to clean it and that's what the Holy Ghost is coming to do oh my god that's what he did a few weeks ago he come in clean and set us for service but when he picks it up and put something in it then he feels it now he can use it for service and I believe this morning gobbles to pick some of us up Phyllis so he can use us for his service hallelujah glory to God glory to God a man we don't want to just be a dirty cup and we also just don't want to be a clean cup never used a man we want to be used by God we must find our place in the body so we can be used by God see and this is this is it this is important to me you know it's not necessarily finding a place in church but finding a place in the body hallelujah you know I mean when we talk about placing then it's not it's not just it's not just manifestations in your life I can't preach it like that because you know a lot used to here you know different ones would say how when brother Branham received his adoption various things happen in ministry you know we like they what they were Thai what happened a man when the seven seals was open and things like that the Angels visit him they're tied at to his adoption well brother Brandon was preached of adoption before the seven seals a man brother branham had already experienced spoken words amen creation before the seals hallelujah hey man so we can't just tie two manifestations like that that would be a part of it but we're trying to find our place in Christ hallelujah all right let's go on a little further here a man a man a man I'm going to this message adoption Park for and you all just bear with me today I just love the Lord man it's a place of Abraham and his seat and his seat I want to try to make it simple so that you understand this is for everybody in here adopted in places for everybody you were pretty destinated unto the adoption of children notice not the description of Savior predestinated to be a church member you will predestinated unto the adoption of children Paul wrote that to everybody brother and sister Oh hallelujah all right now we know that adoption and placing will not be outside of the word right so when we talk about that we understand that that the Bible clearly makes it very clear that uh that it's all sisters are not called to the ministry the Bible makes that clear amen the Bible says I suffer not a woman to teach they usurp authority right that's what the Bible says now I know people don't read the Bible no more but we know that God been calling a woman to preach we also know according to Scripture and nowadays we got women bishops and all that but that's not what the Bible say but I said this is going to be a husband of one wife all right that's what the Bible say right we we got to stay with what God said in his word don't don't try to add to it or take away from it let's just say what he said now let's go a man we talked about adoption placing it's got to be within the word now but now watch this he says and this in this message of Thompson Park four it says now notice the coming of the Lord Jesus is close a man at hand until the spirit from way down in here just barely justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Spirit and now right into the time of the coming of the headstone it says the church has got to be so perfectly like Christ and to Christ in the church can unite together the same spirit and if the Spirit of Christ is in you I like this if the Spirit of Christ is in you it makes you live the life of Christ ah I'm grateful for that and if it's in you you can't even you can't even do wrong that the desire is gold for you to do wrong hallelujah there must be you know experiencing a conviction that when you start to do wrong a pulling in the wrong direction something on us and if it's stopping you and let you know that it's another life living there because your nature will pull for the wrong things on but when the nature of God comes inside of you it stops that are clean habits from performing in your life it makes you live the life of Christ act the life of Christ do the works of Christ he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also jesus said that now where we got a ministry coming that's just exactly like the life of Christ what does that ministry identify the coming of the Lord it says look at in the world a day and watch what Khruschev saying all these other great things and great worldwide conflicts right in hand at any time could go to powder at any second that's right and if that we know that that's close any sense of a person can read in a newspaper or listen to radio and we know that it's closed well remember Christ comes that for his church for it first church before that happens so how close is the coming of the Lord Jesus maybe before this meeting is tonight we're at the end time certain the truth so church I'm looking for it's coming at any time a man and you know all the things that I hear just caused me to get a little most stirred up in my spirit little or not just even so come Lord Jesus is my prayer a man and no sense of us running and acted in fear that's what everybody else does but we should be just so calm and that's right so collected hallelujah yeah a man in Manitoba rationing they don't they won't on the say you so much water so much toilet paper so much this summer then what they want to ration it that's what they talking about so everybody running out trying to get what they can now before they start rationing my question is after you get what you got and you run out what you're gonna do praise the Lord you better know where you stand Amen I'm not I'm not a hallelujah I'm not going to buy a gun to protect myself I got something else graded in the guys I got something passed it in a bullet more powerful than a man than that than an atomic bomb I got the spoken word of times and in all the sins it's just pushing us into a place hallelujah where we can see the manifestation of what we've been talking about a man church what Christ speaking move forward and this is who this is what we've been taught for years now it's time for sin act in that manner as manifested sons and daughters God do you wear predestinated unto this just just sort of to you you you're very clear and take pressure to put you in your place it takes pressure right I mean we we didn't see certain things coming from Moses today was under pressure Joshua cannot speak to a son until he was under pressure glory to God Amen Jesus fed 5,000 when he was under 4,000 when he was under pressure he walked on water when he was under pressure so the pressure produces amen so we're not running from these things we welcome it we know our goddess I got it's bigger than idiots man Church a man a man a man all right hallelujah let's go on the look further I want to bring Abraham man here if we can just for a little bit the Prophet makes them made a powerful statement that just blessed my heart and I just wanted to just bring this to you this is either the message Abraham's Grace Covenant I'm a paragraph 856 go back in Galatians the fourth chapter and pick it up there Paul talking now he placed that son what did he do he had a ceremony of adoption a man adoption place that son now as we were reading there in Galatians chapter 4 Paul is writing to us and and I was reading something a man in my Bible if there's a they were talking about the Romans when they would do this adoption ceremony they were wait to the son got 25 years old that's when they they consider him to be a tool a man they consider Matt 25 this is the Romans they consider them to be I'm at or 25 setting out now what would happen is that this ball will be born into the house you can take it down for a second say this boy will be born into a house and that boy have to a man his father being a businessman did not have time to spend you know training the boy up so the father would hire a tutor a man glory to God and that to this job would be to raise this boy him a man and train this boy and and give this boy a certain testing and certain trials to see how he respond to it Laurie become and the tutor would have to watch this boy a minute and as the tutors watch the boy he's also reporting back to the father how the boy is coming alone he meant in the tooth the father woman a tutor that would like to him the father wanted to today he can trust a man in if they aren't the father would get a tool that he could trust what about our Heavenly Father he got a tutor that he can trust he got the Holy Ghost amen and the Holy Ghost has been training us the Holy Ghost has been teaching us the Holy Ghost is a loud trial after trial amen the coming town to report back to the father how we are responding to these things sit all the Holy Ghost tell on you getting dressed is right right and the Holy Ghost will speak back to the Father if you not didn't right it's easy right in the presence of the Saints but when you leave Church the Holy Ghost want to know how you acted how you conducted yourself the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost say they using curse cursing and language that they should be using but they come into the house of God I'm still praising God out of the same mouth a blessing and a curse the Holy Ghost start reporting to the father she trusted inappropriately hallelujah she changed the way she dress which she gets amongst our friends hallelujah glory to God the Holy Ghost report all that negative behavior you see you can be justified and still have filthy habits Holy Ghost will report on every one of y'all feel free habits that's why that's why your justification must go to sanctification and sanctification the habit should be going and if you if you if you do your own self-evaluation god I still got this in my life but I heard that as sanctification that should've left me God let me go back to do my works over again let me do this process over again because I want the real thing but that boy would be a man of the tutor will report to the Father amen about the progress of this boy and and once the father got to importand that Nate they were looking for him they looking for the boy to get to space at 25 years old they look of him to be ready ready to do what to take on the father's business that's the purpose of you receiving a Holy Ghost it's so that you can actually take on the father's business you can take on his business with his spirit business but it's with his spirit it's not with your spirit but it's with his spirit you gonna do things the way to eat the stem because it's his spirit controlling you hallelujah that was the purpose of the Holy Ghost nonsense for a quick shout a quick feeling on your flesh but something to give you how to live like Jesus hey hallelujah if the Spirit of Christ is in there it's gonna make you live the blackfoot price it's gonna make you act the way Christ would have that's what we're talking about the church this is why the Spirit has come now you know we're gonna pick this up here the profit makes this thing nice tell us go back to Galatians fourth chapter and pick it up there which we did says Paul talking now he placed that son now now now now now when the father felt that the boy was in position that he finally reached the level where you need to reach the following have a ceremony for his own son and when he had that ceremony a man instance to pretty much tell everybody that not when you see my son a man you know the type of business that I learned four years but when you see my son and in my son silent check his name is just as good as my name on a check I got confidence in my boy hallelujah amen now let me also say it let's say this at 25 there's still some things to learn it's really 5a man he ain't perfect yet and Twitter Bob he's got to get ready for some more trucks 25 he hasn't prepared sir he said out of state of land where he might not respond the way he used to respond but he got go through some things 35 dumper to subtract 25 Gump reduced route 55 don't reduce try he don't still go through and after he spins place oh he's gonna still have trials after he's been place so you're placing is not jump affection it still gonna be some things to go to even after the place all right all right all right but you're placing is God having a confidence in you knowing that you know I got I know that they can handle the business a man you're not gonna do things that I wouldn't do son and it's no it's impossible for you to do it because I'm putting my spirit in you I put my spirit in you this is not even your thoughts hey man y'all just stay with me here today I'm gonna show y'all just through a quote here that that even even after the placing even after the placing their tests and trials that car even after the place look at this look at this statement great testing trials come after placing amen man look at what look at what the Prophet says he says uh and then after he's seen that someone's gonna do it I'm sorry he placed a son what did he do he had a ceremony of adoption place that son and then after he's seen that son was going to do it he's going to keep the promise nobody's gonna keep him from it he's just like his daddy he's going to stay right with it cut and let the chips fall wherever they want to he pulls no punches it says I can put trust in that boy so he forms performs adoption what does he do and he perform the adoption that child is a place son then in the father's Kingdom and has full equal rights to it I got another quote I won't have time to read it brother Branham say he's made a partner and this is this is this is uh if he's made a partner in his father's natural business what God is trying to do is make you partner in his business I was reading another quote and and brother Branham say that angels are like secretaries [Music] and then Secretariat is the one that's given assignments I need you to do this I need you to do that I need you to do this I need you to do that we just hit it wincing night hallelujah when Ruth was in the field Boaz DS specific instruction to the Reapers the secretaries the Angels make sure search too hard for this let's all have to work too hard for this but I want you intentionally to bring you blessings intentionally make sure they don't miss it if they happen to walk back make sure they circle back point it out to him looks left for you intentionally secretaries and when you become boss you become boss you become partner you can act for some second you get some help from secretaries look at this it goes only says this I could put trust in that boy so it performs a doctor what does it do he perform the adoption that child's a play son then to the father's Kingdom it has full equal rights to it and otherwise if he wrote a check his name is just as good on the chick as his daddy's a man was then he's adopted a place God did the same thing to Jesus upon Mount Transfiguration what did he do he overshadowed him taking him up in a public place taking three witnesses Peter James and John brought two witnesses from heaven to show three is a witness and when he overshadowed him and his raiment his pretty robe before him the glorified condition shine like the Sun and its strength is that right and a voice came from heaven saying this is my beloved son hear ye him amen I please tell positionally that's my son what he says I'll back up this is where God has brought his people to what he says I'll back up when when when Joshua said son stand still you know Joshua can do that Josh we did not have the power to do that but because he spoke it and he was a place what'd he say God backed up and that's some things that you got to speak just under inspiration you can't bring that thing to pass but because you're a son of God and you found your place in Christ what you say God will back up believe that hallelujah amen because only says uh-uh-uh since the east kept my word he's fought through all these denominations and everything a man else and kept the faith he's pulled no punches he's been through he's always about my work when people look at him they see me this is my son here you him did he just promise that to him know through him come to see the vapor ahem buy the same thing fourth and fifth chapters now look it says go God took a bring him out and place the adoption upon him and change his name now when he said for photography met fourth or fifth verse we read that in Genesis 17 amen when he told Abraham we'll just read it here is real quick it says as for me behold my covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations I meant in Genesis 17 for and asked for me but hold my covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations what a promise this man has no son this man has no child but God gives him problem not only you don't have a son but I'm gonna make you father of many nations hallelujah glory glory glory even in this church right now many nations are represented and we're all the children of Abraham through Christ hallelujah and we can make claims on this promise that God has given us I mean look he says he said sup and that's me but hold my covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations neither shalt thou name anymore because April but thy name shall be Abraham for father many nations have I made thee now let's finish this quote brother Branham was referring back to scripture now look at this it says God took Abraham out and place the adoption upon him and changed his name glory from April to Abraham Abraham comes from the word of Elohim God's own name he associated his name with God's name God is telling him how many knows that the great Jehovah L owe him the all-sufficient when the self-existent when l owe him he says and wanted to do he took the HTM off of his name a man action Peter H I am hallelujah amen offer his name and placed it on Abraham's name God took amen a portion of his thing the self-existing l owe him took a portion of his name and he gave it to Abraham when he did that he was placing Abraham man he was he was placing his son Abraham just by giving a part of his name I just stay with me let me finish this quote glory glory glory because he was April a PRA hmm God is the father of all and Abraham is the father of Nations glory Elohim father of Abraham father of Nations please see positionally glory that's AB his church receive the Holy Ghost out of the day went through the testings Amen see Pentecost missed that they organize themselves we couldn't get into father then when God does a certain thing say uh-huh stay away from it our church don't teach that go ahead but here's what he's done to Abraham to Abraham and his seed after him I just want to go through Abraham's life real quick just bear with me my lord my lord I wish that I wouldn't fight in all this to try to preach this today but the seeds are being planted and the people are coming to understand if Abraham was placed a man this same promise goes down to the sea now we might not have had a man our name change the way Abraham had his name changed but we did receive the father's name because all heaven it's named after the Lord Jesus glory to God amen so we got we got his name now over comers get the new name and we have been over comers in the south praise God we have withstood denominational Amen stuff for years we have been overcome in this no matter whatever else is teaching if it's not in the Word of God it's not in the Word of God and we've been standing over that's overcome us now lacy Oh hallelujah Genesis 12 Abraham was justified now I don't have time to read all this but I will tell you you can go back to the message Abraham's Grace Covenant you can listen to it but in Genesis 12 the prophets say that Abraham was justified now now just four cases being carved out being picked up right give you the cup in in the field of dirty cup in the field you being picked up Abraham was a dirty cup Abraham was serving idol gods that's how dirty he was he wasn't even serving the one true God but God knew that once Abraham came in contact with the one true God it would change everything about it so God picked it up when he didn't even deserve to be picked up can I tell you the truth he predestinated she will turn option and he picked you up when you did the survey he elected you to come to this by mistake about you didn't just meet somebody on the street some weight God knew please doctor to repeat that he knew your dirty condition no filthy habits and he picked you up anyway who will serve a god like that Genesis 12 Abraham was justified he was called out by justification and believe God's words brother really is that right so was the Church of Martin Luther is that right now just that's it just as direct quote but I can't I don't have time to read the whole thing he says and I just I'm going back to this because you can be justified and still have bad habits amen Loreena God you can be justified and still have bad habits now now now abraham was justified glory to God here we were he was serving a false god and when God called Abraham out he did not call light but Abraham brought a lot with him a man a lot of trouble was going on with lot in the camp yeah god be with you he do with you man you can't be trying to bring people own let them come by itself we got deal with him rabbit God God is calling you Abraham hallelujah hey man they will come to it in there if they are predestinated fear of God they can't help but come to it I am I am getting to a place where all I do is just pray I gotta be fussing with nobody I ain't gonna be trying to make you do this and pray because I know the promise you promise them to me into my children those that are prophetess minister Lord our God shall call hallelujah hey man maybe maybe some of you mamas ought to just take acts 2 and so into some of your kids clothes so now just put it on the inside of the clothes they don't even know it's there and I'm not fussing with you you know what you're wearing you wearing a promise it's in your clothes God but don't fuss and fight with the devil that's your token just wave that before the devil this is the promise that God gave me I'm not fussing to fight about that amen listen it said so so you're gonna be justified and still have bad habits Abraham had it right oh my god we in Genesis 12 when he was justified also Genesis 12 were a lot went with him and and Abraham could not get blessed until he separated from life now a separation will also be a sanctification right and so some of us they may really can't get the blessings from God that we that we want until we actually separate from some things in our past now now look at this well you know all the times what we do is we pray God take this out of my life did you pray next God to bring it into your life I do too are you did you just kind of go get involved in that now that you in it you got to get out of it that means you may have to walk away from some things and it may cost you a lot it may cost you a lot but I guarantee if you put God first watch to see what he does for you Abraham did not get the blessing from God until life was gone from him you say that now look look around Abraham I see you know this is this is discount countless to saves on the shore the stars in the sky this is this is what you'll see gonna be like this is the blessing that I'm giving you a man he only got that out he's separated hallelujah now for the Brandon makes a statement that was Genesis 12 that he actually got his his justification this is what you know Abraham was not not any special person a man he was a man following Idol gods and all kind of things like that but God chose him because he saw something on the inside of him God chose you because he saw something on the inside of you now Genesis 15 brother Branham says Amen this is where sanctification encounter came in brother Branham brings us in Genesis 15 says he separated him when he completely obeyed and confirmed the covenant to him by blood he separated him when he completely obeyed and confirmed the covenant to him by blood now the separation actually took place in Genesis 13 but brother Branham said the sanctification of Abraham with Genesis 15 my god sanctification will deliver you from bad habits signification will deliver you from bad people sanctification to do that you want to know why because your nature is changing your desires are changing if they talking one thing you don't want to be talking that if they doing one thing you don't want to be doing that i'ma tell you this everybody that has really received a Baptist all the girls goes through this process shuts micaceous sanctification of baptism of the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is coming to make you live the life of Christ hallelujah now I'm looking at this because Genesis 17 is where he's placed as a sermon he receives the name of Elohim a portion of the name and that's his placing that brother Branham says he says not when he gets he goes from a man being Abram to Abraham he's actually receiving a part of God's name that's his place Oh glory to God I want I want to just I want to share something here because that's Genesis 17 but Genesis 16 he produced an ish male here this man that Ishmael created a problem not only for but Abraham's house but even Abraham see this smell now here's here's what I mean you know Ishmael was was was was produced because they compromise with the promise God told Sarah your wife gonna have us to have a son but she said why don't you take hey God my hand mate and why don't you have a son by her but that's that one what God had in his mind we can't make suggestions to help God God know exactly what he said Sarah thought what I don't care how old she is she's still gonna have a son they producing Ishmael Abraham fail for you notice this plan that Sarah presented to him and you know and God allowed it to happen to know I prefer a reason I if I could just just be bold enough to say that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according just some time it don't look good they don't look good a man don't feel good II but I'm still working together for good nothing happened in a child gods life that God actually why you're going through a Gaga people affecting your character hallelujah glory to God Church Ishmael was produced in Genesis 16 hallelujah but Genesis 17 is where he received his place together son after this male he got a placing now that told me something predestination overrides every mistake [Applause] bless my heart destination will override every mistake in your life if God has predestinated you to the adoption children ain't nothing a devil can do to stop you from hitting it your mistakes can't stop you your failures can't stop you hallelujah I'm telling you what the prophets said that Abraham was was was placed in chapter 17 Genesis 17 that mean if you look back at his life before Genesis 17 and all the things that he did God weren't even looking at all their mistakes I don't talk about the places of Abraham and his seed because the promise of Abraham flows down to us hallelujah just by us calling him Abraham we made him the father of many nations and Oh hallelujah church let me let me let me then I'll just read a little poem gift for you a man this gonna become an adoption part 3 glory glory predestination overrides every mistake thank you Jesus he predestinated me up to the adoption of children a man he had this in this mind before I was even born look at this to statement out of adoption part 3 says watch this master teacher Paul the first thing it does is knock out all the ideas falling away knock out all that did ever being a Christian today and tomorrow I'm gone and the next day God condemned me and the next thing I'm back again up and down life's palace got to be over where we going realize we can't get away from this what does that just go settling your spirits yeah I cannot get away from this it's like a magnet on the inside that you're magnetized to truth I can't get away from this Lord yes I think though he is but I can't get away when we when we bring our place to a place of surrender Amen we'll make it make it much easier on ourselves look at this now watch what it says since the next day I'm back again that's nonsense says this book is not addressed to evangelistic teaching evangelist sermons we I don't touch this on the fields I bring this to the church but Paul addressed it to the Saints those that are called and preserved and I feel and I set aside and I in the holy spirit already and Kingdom's live he's trying to tell them the first thing get it out of your mind that you're going to get lost man I just wanna aim take take take take aim praise God if the devil has put that in your mind we blowin it out yes God don't play Chinese with people he don't let you come here and sit here to hear things like this baby playing games with you hallelujah amen see that the barge-woman in Abraham's they had to be cast out it was a tight the denomination the church could not have the same promise that the promised child had they can receive the same blessings and even though the denominator denominator church with a greater Church a bigger Church they still did not have the same blessings a man cast out the bondwoman because of the the child of the free woman that the air a free woman my god that's the woman that I'm talking to then the children that I'm talking to but that's the need for dating by God that be overcomers look at this look at this now it says and we're just trying to blow this thing out your mind don't even start talking like that uh you love you can't be lost can God be lost God a part of God is in you now I'm gonna read the quote cuz you may make mistakes and you have to pay for your mistakes but loss not an option not enough so I got I'm a pain full of mistakes but I'm not lost Oh glorious I would just have to pause and say thank you Jesus [Music] oh this is a big word I might be too late but not lost man saying I'm not gonna be lost our part of God yeah I know I did this is not no idea that I created of Ishmael that was that was Genesis 16 a man for the josue I'm not stop for that Genesis 16 moving to Genesis 17 17 represents a normal victory [Applause] and in genesis sanity even with my mistakes I'm still kin the part of his name glory to God praise His Holy Name a man let's let me read this let me read this he says this he says that he's trying to tell them the first thing get out of your mind that you're gonna get lost you're gonna do this and you're scared of this don't be scared of nothing he's trying to tell you where you're at who you are I like this how are you standing I noticed noticed that he's trying to tell you where your act that's not what you come into where your act now who you're gonna be but who you hey man and not a man when you overcome but how you standing now see it's good to see yourself the way God sees you see Satan is the accuser of the Brethren but we ain't gotta listen to my one one accusation from the devil

thing personal I mean we leave it we leave it up to the Father but bring it down the hill everything doc you do some children at all then the father has given me will come I didn't write that God wrote it I just believe it Oh hallelujah let me finish reading this distance this quote here it says this don't be scared of nothing face trying to tell you where you at who you are how you standing now you might do things wrong and every time you do anything wrong you're gonna get paid for it Abraham did something wrong when they brought Ishmael on the scene and he got paid for it Alleluia he says this yes sir you reap what you sow now just because Abraham brought Ishmael and seemed did that change who Abraham was he's still the father of many nations nations your mistakes don't change your status and the son of God you will always be a son of God as a daughter of God you gonna always be a daughter gone amen it's time for us to recognize that hallelujah even even Adam fail but was still a son we got to stop letting that devil tell us you O Lord I always saying that that's unforgivable is when you when you when you blaspheme the Holy Ghost that's it but not everything else you can be covered you can you can you can you can you can actually a man put it underneath something amen brother Adam saying went went went went witness witness washed in the blood it's like he said it's like a drop of ink that goes into a bleach and when it does in the bleach you say it disintegrates can be found hallelujah we need to know the power of the blood it loses us when we bring it underneath the blood you do something wrong you got to get paid for you reap what you sow but that has not one thing to do with your salvation when you're boiling the spirit God you got it turn life and can no more die then God can die you're a part of God you're a son of God let's look at this I was born a pram right you might wanna make me some other name by what you say by me know that you gonna make me another name some of the name but won't make me one less I'm still bright hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I like the Prophet doing that but I want y'all to put y'all name whatever your

inside that makes me act like Christ that makes me look like Christ that makes me talk like because it's blood it's on the inside the inside leaves only a clean on the outside I belong to Jesus tell me what you want just call me wash glory to God glory to God hallelujah hey Manny Manny Manny man see this this is this is important to me we recognize and I said earlier that even though you know you you you you you you you come to spot a man where you have a placing it does not stop the trial from coming don't stop the trials from coming brother Brandon made a couple of statements now try to wine this up it says it was a number of years in Abraham's life that he moved from justification to sanctification love abuse time it has been trying to get to this process we don't heard it but we not living it it was a number of years that he went from justification to sanctification he says it was a lap of years from sanctification to the confirmation a man that the Holy Ghost had come he says but in the same chapter where he placed him after the Holy Ghost in the same chapter I'm sorry in the same chapter where he where he received a part of God's name he also got he got he got he got a there was a a confirmation that took place there in that chapter and that confirmation was something that Abraham's seed wore in the flesh which was a type of the Holy Ghost amen but you know once he got his placing hallelujah his name changed the Holy Ghost and let me just you know when he tells me let me just read this I never read this verse 1 in Genesis 17 when Abraham was ninety years old and nine the Lord appeared to Abram is stand up to him I am The Almighty God Almighty God walk before me and be that perfect now you know another part of this amen before I go further by being told that he's the Almighty God amen this is the name El Shaddai this this new attribute of God is introduced to Abraham and what brother Adam says this is where Abraham can get and what we need to do is is know him as El Shaddai the breasty God hallelujah amen find strength in the Old Testament find strength in the New Testament he's a breasted car that you can depend on whenever you're going through something stop depending on your own strength and depend on the breasted car hallelujah don't depend on Sarah's revelation the church is revelation depend on the breasted car when you get a little weak you can come up to the breasted card you can get strength for the journey glory to God hear hear Abraham gets a chance to know him as the breast of God gifts get strength from him a man has his name change and and but here the thing that I was telling said even you get to this point that don't stop the trials because I'm only in Genesis 17 hallelujah glory to God but you realize from Genesis 17 to Genesis 21 now in Genesis 17 Abraham is 90 and years old in Genesis 21 he's a hundred years old what happens at a hundred years old he receives his promised son glory to God but you know after he got that son he got a great trial great trial the same Sonny been waiting on for 25 years now God says bring that son up here to the mountain and offer him so what I'm telling us that the trials might get greater after your place in do you know after Jesus experiences placed in on Mount Transfiguration there was a Calvary waiting for him so the placing there's not only a man release a man this distance the supernatural power but the place and also breach of character and the subjection to the will of God oh it goes both ways Abraham was placed in Genesis 17 but in Genesis 24 he's asked to do something brother branham call it the final test can you handle it Church I said you can't I know you can you are predestinated unto all this you are predestinated oh my god you're placing or your adoption does not mean that you are immune from trials and failures now I want to put failures in there because even after is placing Abraham goes to a city that he had no business being I'm the yelling yelling I'm talking I left this place you only with me it after his place in he live please liar you told that man is not my wife this is my sister now he was telling part truth and some of the things that we do we tell part truth the reason you getting some of the benefits that you get the right now because you done total part truth you don't trust God to make a way for you gonna tell apart do you trust the government but you don't trust God hello somebody thinking that's a blessing that's what a lie come o somebody Abraham told that man that isn't my sister and it had to be God hallelujah could he get them that he'd done that before he got away with it and now even after his place in that nature see that bad name bad habits got to be sanctified them habits a goal from your life should be going from me Amen but here here he is here he is you know down there and anything they say this might this - my sister and God had to come down to the man in a dream King Abimelech had to speak to him in a dream and say don't touch that man's wife why and this man's having a conversation with God on a dream God did not you said wipe the man told me his sister if she even said that was her brother I know what they said but that's his wife and said you better not touch him if you're touching death it be all over this place say my lord you know what I say I want you to restore that man his wife and then athle restored I won't him the pray for you and I want you to I want you to this I want you to remember the spiritual because a bit let's say the lion God didn't call him like even though he was a lion God didn't call him like see you got to see yourself the way God sees you might be a deceiver but God don't call you to see trickster god no call you Playboy God don't call you see that's my prophet that was his place that's my prophet yeah I can tell you today God say that's my son that's my daughter yeah and I don't care what to label them wit they're still mine they might be mangled up mashed up all that accident life wrapped up but they still my children [Applause] you're police no adoption does not mean that you're immune from trials or failures abraham disobeyed by leaving the land and then he lied to Abimelech Abraham was given final tests of offering Isaac at Calvary which is a perfect type of Christ because Christ was offered on the same mountain that Isaac was offered on Jesus was adopted at Mount Transfiguration but he still had more trials to face he had to go to Calvary and church our adoption are a place that we protested it to we got a place at God and God wants us to walk in that but we got to come through justification we got to come through sanctification have it's gone in sanctification we got to be feeling the Holy Ghost so we can be put in service amen God has that for each and every one of us glory to God amen and let me tell you something the scripture said man's gift may grow for himself bring her for break man you ain't got to push yourself into nothing God gonna do it for you automatically and then it's the automatic thing God does this and he sets in the church these gifts for the edification of the church praise the Lord we found out last week - jewel hey man born under certain sign and just by being born under that sign you find your place glory to God a man I just been thinking God I've meant to say this earlier a few weeks ago we we came on over the church came on Wednesday night I was in way in Tucson and brother Troy preached a sermon its checkup time and I was in Tucson Ivan I hadn't even

finally said brother now I'm sorry you know I'm sorry you know I need you to do it you come in and preach wounded spirits one by chance the one by accident that he preached that sermon wounded spirits and then what happened when you get to it when you get a wound do you know what you're supposed to do take off running to where the water is because if that dam can just get toward whatever wounded him is in trouble they will not find the deer anymore all you got to do is get to war and when you come to church you're coming to the waterhole Brotherhood brother Jerry come on a Friday night and talking about faith don't ask questions and with faith captured faith start moving I said I like that it's associated with the right mental attitude and they said whatever you do don't confess that your faith is weak for the ramps they don't don't let the devil hear you say things like that my faith is weak nobody my faith is strong I don't care how you feel I can do all things through Christ that strengthens me you say it's time to put the world on mute yeah you got something on mute Matt now now now you know if you are on a phone conversation with somebody and you put them on mute now
