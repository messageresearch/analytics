at the end of the night do it but let's see how this works if you can't hear let the let the fellas back there no and God bless you all good to see you tonight it's a real real joy it's got a but a lot of reverb a lot of echo is that gonna be really annoying before we get very far so they'll work on it just let me know if you can't hear it you'll do that you ain't gonna bother me at all I've been good to be with you I'm Tom earnest I was here I went back and looked it up I was here in B star January 31st of 16 so come January would make three years since since we were here with you we tried to come back a couple of times in between and we made a couple of false starts and we've set up a date or a time might work and it just never works so here we are again we trust the Lord knows all about that I I wanted to come again I know the fellowship I've had with your pastor and that trip before many mouthing meetings and follow him on the internet a little bit I look at it it man's everywhere so you know for a little guy sure spreads itself in some times but we we have had a wonderful day today in fellowship and and friendship with a mechanic are you hearing me is it okay are you okay alright let's read our scriptures together and then we'll let you be see the revelations chapter 12 if we can read there for a text that tonight we're just gonna set a little platform for for a little larger text on Sunday no one I didn't know when we set up to come on Sunday that you even had a Friday night me and after we were committed to come on Sunday so we'll just go ahead and have a service on Friday night I don't want the people coming out on and off night and and and they said it's not an off night he says we show up anyways so cut this you for that it's it's an odd night for for church but God bless you for for being willing to come on an odd night you know that's whatever whatever fits for you so that's the wonderful thing as the Lord leads it's good to see you all here tonight but we'll read a text if we count out of revelations chapter 12 and verse 9 the great dragon the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil he got a lot of names a me called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the Kingdom of our God and the power of his Christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night our text will come from verse 11 and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto the death therefore rejoice you heavens you that dwell in them woe to the inhabitants of the earth and the sea for the devil has come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time I like you especially especially verse 10 now is come salvation and strength now has come now when now when the accuser of the Brethren has been dealt with and has been cast down there now there's some victory coming alrighty I'm glad for that let's just pray father we ask you to bless the word tonight we so appreciate seeing the hearts of the people wanting to come into the house of the Lord and have a little time of fellowship around the word and and in the singing and in the worship of you we ask you tonight Lord that you'll just take take this this Holy Writ let it be read and said in such a way that the people can can take some benefit home with them that's our prayer tonight we know you are faithful we just try to be faithful to stand and let let the word take its course we pray these things amen and amen god bless you may be seated now I'm I'm still getting a lot of ring back are you still are you all hearing that or is that just me you're working on it all right you're gonna get it all right I got great confidence in that group of men back there that are yes my goodness it is a long way from Wichita to here in case y'all have have never traveled our way it's certainly we met we did it in a few stages we I know many of you will remember us from last time but we were entering very nearly and in November we'll be entering into our 40th year of ministry of this message we began in November of 1979 and by the grace of the Lord we need look no where else since all right I don't know anything outside this message that what I do know of it I'm not interested in it it holds no attraction I wake up every morning looking in my Bible and looking into the word and and standing there like Peter did I just ain't got nowhere else to drive to whom else can we go because this is the words of eternal life I know lots of distractions along the way people have gotten distracted and and gotten weary and tired you know that there's no other way to say it after 39 years now on the road and in the ministry and going from church to church and and group the group there's no other way to describe it other than we're just all tired we are tired we we never thought when we started the journey that we'd still be here now and we can say that candidly and very very truthfully we never imagined that's right I remember I remember I was born and raised in West Tennessee place called Nutbush Nutbush Tennessee any of y'all that ever heard any music before you came to the Lord know that that's the same little community where Tina Turner was born in fact my dad my family we farmed cotton growing up through the years here and we had a farm off of highway 19 which I don't recommend you go home and even hear that song because other than it's about where I was born from it ain't nothing to listen to but she mentioned highway 19 which we lived right on the highway we had a farm went way back to a point in the field and then our young days while it was still there before it fell in and rotted we could see the house that she was born in there so that I tell everybody where I go me and her the only famous people got out of there so the rest of them are still there so but that's where I was born and raised and began my ministry there in a little little Church in the cotton patches in that bush so the Lord has been good to keep us in and let us continue in this room there there is there is there is somebody let me just just say this from the beginning somebody is going to fulfill 1st Thessalonians 4 see right somebody's gonna do it that's right it ain't got to be me come on it ain't even got to be you we trusting by grace it is you all right but the scripture tells us that somebody will be alive and remaining to the to the change of the body somebody is going to do this right I believe by the grace of God that I'm a part of that yeah but if you here some day that brother tom has met his demise and that's not my portion then I'm gonna be the second half of that verse because whoever is fulfilling that first half will not prevent or hinder them which are asleep I know we get all sorrowful when we lose somebody or a loved one or a friend or a member of the church goes on and and on the natural side it is very sorrowful but these people that that died in the faith they've already punched their ticket and they are included in that verse he got Paul didn't leave nobody out there's gonna be somebody alive and remaining there's going to be somebody who will not be hindered we will not hinder than what you are asleep we shall be all change changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye yeah amen and amen I believe that with all my heart we're gonna begin a little a little lesson tonight again I knew the to bill for a little bigger platform on Sunday I wanted to talk about overcoming overcoming yeah I know we bring it all back to the natural every time and I've been preaching a long time I've heard a lot of preachers preach about overcoming one of my favorite messages of brother Branham is how can I overcome yeah I mean I think I've grown up with that as being one of my they're one of those benchmarks of a lesson that will help me along the journey how can I overcome I'm gonna read a couple of quotes out of it tonight but if I can give you the the cliff notes the little short version of how can I overcome you know what the end result was basically you can't okay yeah basically you cannot he can overcome it that's that's what the Prophet was trying to teach us all along he said we can run around the earth and we pluck peacock feathers in a crow all we want to but he's still gonna be a crow yes but God who is rich in mercy who thought of us before placed our names on that book before the foundation of the world he can overcome yes how can I overcome I believe we're living in a time always when I leave on a trip and I've already visited one church there Memphis on the way down and now I'm here with you all and we'll finish our journey back up back up towards home but I always try the Lord seems to always give me a little a little area that that builds a little theme for the whole little little missionary journey or evangelistic trip that I'm on and this quote out of stature of a perfect man you know a lot of people don't believe in preachers no more a lot of people don't believe in ministry anymore but I believe ministry is here Laurie not to know only to not you know in spite of themselves help the people towards that perfection that God is brand soon right listen what brother have said in Statue of a perfect man God wants to be worshipped the word God means object of worship it's God trying to condition his people listen now it's God trying to condition his people so he can get from them what he created them for that's what God is doing through ministry right through the through this message he is conditioning his people right to get from them what he created them for he never made you to be something else besides a son and daughter of God if you have missed that of being son and daughter of God you've missed the mark are you with me that's what God is doing and I believe every little every little journey on the road every little you know after 39 years four years of being in the ministry and then hundreds of different churches and and hundreds of different congregations I know you're gonna look around here in West Palm Beach they were very big well you're a big church compared to some of them I go to be encouraged be encouraged is a big crowd here tonight and sitting beside you is the spirit section you know what all these empty benches are that's the spirit section that's for all those people that'll tell you next week well I wasn't there but I was with you in spirit so that's that's right where they're at right there by that that's the spirit section there's something but overcoming is it's it's it's God conditioning his people you know very if brother branham ever makes a very plain flat statement you can believe it's going to happen if you know I know we pick out we pick out our favorites you know quotes are like you know I don't know which ones my favorite is it's like a pastor we used to have up there Fort Walton Beach brother Brown he was got to be an old man he loved ice cream he said you know he said reading quotes and reading the scriptures like eating ice cream though your favorite one is the one that you're having right now he said it's hard to pick out a better one than that but brother Brandon makes a statement about the Laodicean Church age the Laodicean Church age and this isn't out of how can I overcome here's what he said Laodicea that's the last church age there's going are you with me now this is much like all declare in 1st Thessalonians 4 brother Branham is making a statement there's going to be some overcomers in there there's going to be it don't matter to me who fails doesn't make the mark flounders runs here and there gives up restarts gives up restarts none of that matters there's going to be some over comers in there there's going to be by the grace of God I'm going to be one of them always we relegate overcoming to to control controlling our ourselves and certainly there's value in that there's certainly value in a daily overcoming walk as a Christian we never want to get to the place or doesn't matter what I do well it doesn't matter what you do yeah a truly born again son and daughter of God conducts themselves like a truly born again son and daughter's life we don't want to ever get to the place that God is doing it all right are you with me but yet in ourselves we know there ain't nothing we can't do that's what we're going to talk about overcoming that's one of those great paradoxes of life is that we cannot overcome unless he overcomes in US are you with me because we can go out and we can reform ourselves we can work ourselves we can we can't we can we can keep under subjection the body we can do all of those things that Paul in the scripture exhorts us to do but to truly overcome now brother Branham gives us a definition of overcome right out of the message how can I overcome Jesus told us how to do it talking about overcoming overcome means to stand the test you remember that quote overcome means to stand the test overcome means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks lots of people says there's no devil it's just a thought don't you believe that right don't you believe that no more than God is just a thought no more than God is just a spirit being an imaginary something out there that we that we think that's why we come and and certainly here in West Palm y'all are a little more expressive than some of our other churches that I know I'm not expecting you to win the the quiet award from four places that I go I wanted to come out because when I tuned in to brother Jack he's all over the place I saw him doing something week or two ago I don't know what that was okay I didn't know what he was doing I I got to go back and watch it again because because it was a move that I don't have if I preach like him I'd be nothing but a you'd have to pick up the fragments in a basket like they did over there when Jesus broke the bread I just just break into pieces I asked the brothers about a lapel mic hey they only have one because he runs around [Laughter] but that's that this area of overcoming it's a tremendous promise there will be some over comers in there the devil the Prophet told us the devil wants to throw up every scarecrow we can along the way everybody that stumbled fell didn't make the mark lost the faith had a crisis of faith all these different definitions that they've given about this message those who've walked away and stumbled and fell and and the enemy wants to throw those up we'll see he couldn't he could none of us can let me tell you brothers and sisters five seconds out from behind the Grace and the blood of this word that has come in our day and every one of us fall there is no strength in us to hold ourselves how can i overcome the prophet basically put it in simple terms you can't he overcomes and we're going to see that in the scripture in just a few minutes he overcomes in you now brother Graham talking about the Laodicea it's the grandest stage of all ages but as yet he says it's the greatest sinful age that ever was yeah we live in a very precarious our thee those thousand thousand demons that was released out of the river Euphrates were released in our day the Prophet went into teaching to let us know that he looked back to the scripture and he said he said and I'll tell you when it happened my dear brothers and sisters was that the opening of those seals when that word came open to its fullness when that when that expression of what God has all the secrets that God has always wanted his church to know was revealed to us and at that same time that great onslaught of the enemy came as well to where our prophet made statements like the lid has come off of hell letting hard for y'all to believe you see it every day and look at the vileness there there are atrocities that happen in our neighbor hoods that we could have never imagined what happened the mother's drowning their children and you look at they that's just the work of the devil the work of the enemy but in this evilest and most sinful age there's going to be some overcomers in there I've been privileged to go and travel like I have for all these years going into churches looking for those overcomers preaching to those over comers I get criticized sometimes will seem like the only thing you're looking for is a broad message well that's what I'm here to preach do it bribe it is a broad message we're living in a different age we're not in a Pentecostal is right we're in a bride age the Prophet labeled it that for us a bride age that you and I are living in and in that age there's going to be some overcomers in there you notice again back to our scripture because I like to to base any quotes we have anything that the Prophet said I like to see it in the word I like to see that that this foundational truth that he is giving us permeates itself in the word and and at the very time the Great Dragon was cast out at the very time the accuser of the Brethren has been defeated the word comes out behind it I heard a loud voice saying now has come now salvation has come now is when the great victory now is when the true overcomers there's been over comers in every age sometimes it get in and the reason I wanted to build a foundation on this tonight is we're gonna we're gonna take on Sunday we're gonna go into the book of Job the great overcomer of his age when brother Branham says the definition of overcoming is to stand the test ain't nobody we can think about greater tested then that prophet Joe and I trust the Lord will help us to look in that but but being an overcomer in Laodicea the Prophet gave us a very foundational truth of the of the progression of the scripture and I went back this afternoon and I did print them all out because I didn't want to miss one the prophet let us know that that that that the the succeeding church age behind each church agent and I know you have the the graphic here you've got Ephesus Smyrna Pergamum Thyatira Sardis Philadelphia and then the Laodicean Church age the Prophet let us know a wonderful truth and each age each church age succeeding that each church age following that not only inherits the promise out of the Book of Revelations for his age but he inherits the all that is in each age before him was a right that's why it's a privilege to live here in 2018 that's why it's a wonderful thing that God looked down in Nutbush Tennessee and said I'm gonna plant you there in this age it is a privilege my dear brothers to live and the greatest the prophesied visit I'll tell you what's the greatest age it's the ending of time it's the ending of all things it's the ushering in of the millennium it's all of these things and that's why I'm privileged to be standing here tonight I know it ain't about how good I preached it or how bad I preached it just to be a part of it you know we all get worried about our above what we do it is we doing enough are we doing already you know everybody brother Graham said that's the biggest trap a man can get into is he'll see a guy with a gift and he'll want to go out and have his gift whatever God has called you to do do it with all your heart if you have a position in the church do that with all your heart if you have no position do it with all your heart again our old pastor there from Fort Walton Beach he used to always talk about our building they had built it there and and when you look at a building you look around you got all the nice plaster and the paint looks good I mean this was getting a little old and tired but but it's just what you got to live with I'm just gonna go on and say it I know he's thinking about I hearing out land this land over here a church can go there a church can go there I heard it all afternoon we're riding around you know this place can can be a church god bless you if that's the way the Lord would lead you nothing wrong with that you know I know I had half of no it's too late too late to be building another church it's too late you know you know how the Prophet broke that down he said if you were hello he got no money for that I'll let me give you another quote he says what goods are gonna do you to keep your money in your pocket they're gonna do I could look those up for you if you needed me to but they're there you'll find I've been reading them for 39 years what goods are gonna be in your pocket if got it if he knew he was coming tomorrow all right and it was the will of the people and the land you felt it was the will of the Lord to build a church go ahead and build a church we get into that mentality it's too late but but I don't know why I wanted to get into that other than I kept I know where most of the Lots are that can hold the church now I don't see it's the man's heart he wants to have a building for you I was in this building three years ago and they changed none maybe a little tighter and a little more weary but it's still here but this area of overcoming each church age I quickly went back in and I jotted down each promise you know God is a wonderful heavenly father he wants to give you stuff you know I know we all do what I'm gonna go out and give me a job and I'm gonna earn it you know I used to sit so cars for a long time you know what my wife and I do now to to try to hold hold the creditors away from the door we shot groceries for people I know it's it's it's quite a business in Wichita we we work for a company called instacart I ever drove for a while I still do it a little only when there ain't no groceries to be bought man down here in the south and mover drivers get a bad rap I'm telling you they they're stabbing people burn people I read it in the paper every day Atlanta somebody in Atlantis I didn't I don't carry a knife Oregon so but you know this whole societies messed up I mean it is when we was growing up you know what our parents told us don't get in the car with a stranger and now you know what they do you call a stranger on the phone to come and pick you up and it's not that he's kind enough to come and get you you paying for it now I do get some in my car that lived by the philosophy don't talk to strangers because they're just clammed up in the backseat and won't talk to me but I did overdriving for a while but now we shop groceries for a living there's a company called instacart instacart they they go into the Kroger stores and and we take our telephones I left mine in the office there and you pull up the app and you get a opinion on your phone and it tells you to go in there and get them some peas and some bacon and some bread tells you what flavor they want tells you what size they want and you just show up in the grocery store and haul it into their house and they let me a stranger bring their groceries right into their house how can you imagine it's a strange world we live in but I'm thinking what a privilege what a privilege what a privilege God has given us in that ephesus church age whatever God has given you it is a gift from him I don't matter if you've got a little or a lot everybody thinks it's somehow that matters to God somehow somebody some people think that that you know these prosperity preachers I hear them out there and it's all about prosperity prosperity so the seed plant the seed give me the seed whatever you what-whatever you hear the prosperity guys why is it all the same every one of them bars each other's notes it's all the same prosperity prosperity yeah it don't matter if you got a little or a lot be faithful with what God has given you I got a direct quote for you it's not wrong to make money brother Branham said but don't be jealous of the man that does if God is not the grocery shopping it we're not gonna retire on it we're gonna be millionaires we're gonna keep hauling peas and corn and beans until until something else shows up and we thank the Lord for that he's provided an avenue he's given us a little outlet of something to do between my ministry trips it's the kind of a job that we can do and and and come on a trip like this and be gone three weeks and and set it aside and then pick it back up when we go home it's hard to work for the man and get three weeks off I just giving you brothers that know how do you show up down at your job say I want to go preaching for three weeks I'll I'll see you in November oh that don't work but the Lord has been good to us but the whole point is this if you go to each church age every church age had overcomers God's never lacked for an overcomer now it got thin at times yes sir it got thin let me just read you a quote right out of out of how can I overcome God has always had over comers he's had over comers in every age there's always every time in every age that there's been on the earth God has always had somebody I know y'all like to to respond everybody say somebody God has always had somebody you know what I was looking at I'm looking at somebody I'm looking at somebody over here somebody over there somebody God has always had somebody he could put his hands on as a witness in the earth he's never been without a witness though sometimes just one but he's always had one somebody overcome like the Saints of old and brother branham begins through those next paragraphs it starts around paragraph 73 he begins comparing some of these previous ages listen to and I'm getting I'm giving you the cliff notes of it in Noah's time in Noah's time there was eight right over comers right and that's what went in that's right in the days of Daniels time there was four over comers that could stand the test of fire and lion yeah I believe we've got some people today that'll stand that test and I believe when that pressure and that squeeze comes on that the Prophet told us was coming I know it gets it gets lean and ugly here sometimes even in the life that we're living in but I cannot go back and read all those quotes that brother Branham left us I know people are preaching we're already in the squeeze my mind has been squeezed building rather than me talking about your mind he's talking about when they when we're meeting in homes and bins and caves of the earth and and trying to still have a meeting when they're when that little hunted and persecuted group I hunted yet I ain't persecuted yet I know everybody you know we get a tiny little taste of persecution we just crumble up go in the fetal position just like we'd see nothing yet it's coming my dear brothers and sisters in the days of Daniels time there was four over comers in the days of lot Jesus referred to it there was only three that overcome lot and his two daughters not even his wife didn't overcome you know Israel started out this is paragraph 84 they started out to me and strong and ended up with how many two million to two we got a great message out of that of year to later one in a million one in a million I looked up the population of Palm Beach County I wanted to see how big our crowd was gonna be tonight we go we're doing pretty good by those ratios one point four four million people in Palm Beach County you take in Miami and all down at six point seven million that quite the building full I'll tell you why it's not for them it's not for that this message did not come together in the masses it came to hunt and search for his predestinated seed over comers over comers he'll start out to mean strong ended up with two in John the Baptist time I mean remember overcomers were there in John the Baptist time there was found six that had overcome in John's time they had six that was Joseph and Mary Zacharias and Elizabeth Simeon and Anna yeah that's all the overcomers that there were six so so brother Branham is trying to give us a picture of what a true of the the ratio of a true over comer I got intrigued a little while ago talking to thinking about the stature of a perfect man I love preaching on stature of a perfect man that's been many years of my life afraid to touch it because other brothers had messed it up and the thunders people that took it and made this and that out of it and they they painted all can I say something wrong y'all was in those meetings you always in there yeah and they had it all so kind I heard that all my life and so convoluted and and I just left it alone but here recently and in the last year I've I've been privileged to look into that message stature of a perfect man and I and I thought you know was looking at the words of brother Branham throughout that that message and other messages surrounding it we got to realize there was only one truly perfect man that ever walked the earth and that was Christ himself brother Graham said everybody else was flawed except for him now we've had good men powerful men wonderful men wonderful ministries wonderful prophets through the ages but there was only one perfect man and I got to thinking you know about this ratio thing too out of a million or of two million in one in a million and and I got to thinking of how many how many people have lived on this earth think of that you know nobody knows exactly but I would tell the scientists and I went to all the the scholars and those people that that can halfway figure out these things populations through the the millenniums before us and through the decades and and they came up with a figure and it's pretty well a general consensus that that living human beings on this planet since the creation of time is about a hundred and eight billion people and just think of all that effort that man put into it there was one perfect one Wow that came apart from the instrumentality of man it had nothing to do with this sinful flesh it had nothing to do with the procreation or as we got here but there was just a little girl out of wash day one day yeah look marry brother branham called it a blue monday she said it was probably a blue monday she was out doing her laundry and an angel came you know what he said about that that prophecy that that a virgin would concede he said that prophecy went around and around the world a man looking for a place to land right that's looking for a place to land which are alive and remain is looking for a place to land this world is looking for a place to be in this Laodicean Church age and all the evil and mother and father in the sin that is around us but that prophecy of Isaiah virgin shall conceive a winter round and around the world looking for a place to land people we're trying to help it out remember brother Branham said when they realize there's probably all the move then little Jewish mothers would start knitting booties and blankets we're gonna be the ones but it wasn't there for there it wasn't for them there was a chosen vessel and that's why the whole prizes of a thinness that we are the chosen vessels of the entire this word is looking for a place to land a place for an over comers promise yes to find this way yes in our heart but let's go back to each one of those promises Ephesus keeping in mind the words of our prophet every age not only inherits the promise of his age but the promise of every age before proceeding an emphasis was given the promise that overcometh this is in verse 7 of chapter 2 revelations I will give I will give it I will give to eat all right of the Tree of Life yes and it's almost enough in itself ain't yeah but that's just the beginning that's just the Ephesus age that's the Ephesian age yes first 11 to the smyrnaean age he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death right man you add that to eating of the Tree of Life that's a pretty good stuff right there that part of me an age to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna yeah I'll give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth that's right and all there's lots of truths and all of that diet Iron Age even overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end to him will I give power over the nation's a man you'll roll with the rod iron as the vessels of a Potter so they'll be broken to shivers and I'll give him I will give him the morning that's our decent age he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father and before his angels and get down to this Philadelphia days he that overcometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go no more out i'll write upon him the name of my god in the name of the city of my god which is New Jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from my god and I will write upon him my new name I'll get I'm gonna do all this I'm gonna we're talking about heated overcoming I'm going to provide all of this for him already God and to the Laodicean age to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne listen to these next words now remember we're going back to the whole context of how can I overcome he's going to do it yes maybe put that verse up my brother verse verse 21 of Revelations 3 I think I saw you putting scripture up there can you do that this is our age now yeah we're going to break into what we're trying to tell you all along it ain't you that's gonna do it right to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame that Laodicean age is going to need to recognize one thing that overcoming has also has already been provided right overcoming is is it is this tantamount to recognizing that I also overcame not only for myself but I have overcome for them and I've set down with my father right in his throne hey man oh what an age we live in and you go over revelations twenty-one and seven and you'll find a scripture that certainly coordinates with what birth the Prophet was telling us revelation 21:7 even overcoming what are we gonna get even overcometh shall inherit all things all right all the things what does the scripture tells I'll be is God he'll be my son a man that overcomer it is not only going to receive the portion for his age but he's gonna reach back through all those ages and gather each of their portions oh you talk about the mother lode as come our way you talk about people that ought to be happy I was listening to brother preach the other night up in up in in Sarasota there a minister brother you've had him here in your church he was reading a very good quote on a rising of a sudden that light broke upon the earth it brought joy I'm here alright all the presents of that life running Jack and I were discussing some some areas of the lights yeah so we've been looking at what a wonderful thing that light has come yes is he that overcometh shall inherit all things saving it all so y'all be yelling that in brother Jack this because you're afraid it's gonna scare me tells every succeeding age gets the benefits of the ages before the overcomers of our day and I'll be as God he should be the mother loves all things Amen overcomer somebody's gonna do it and then somebody I'm somebody you gotta believe you're so we we are we're proprietors we have been given one of the most selfish selfish quotes that we have lived with for all these years that the Prophet could have left us win you'll know what it is if there's only one going what kind of a selfish what kind of a selfish plan is that if there's only one going I'll be them what is he trying to tell us that as long as you are making your calling and election sure right the trouble is we've gotten so bewildered by that in the in time that we're trying to go out and make everybody else is calling an election shirt but the scripture encourages us to make our own calling an election sure yes sir let me take something about me tonight I'm gonna tell you son now you may believe that I'm a good fellow and brother Jack likes me and I appreciate that and I'm glad I'm glad for that but let me tell you the core truths about the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right and that is that I am the only one that knows did I have it listen to this Pentecostal age this is this surrounding this message and I hear preaching stuff about the baptism of the Holy Ghost and and and I see them get it I know this brothers got the Holy Ghost cuz I seen him get it that's all against the scripture the kingdom of heaven cometh by observation singing get it brother Graham said what'd you see he says those are the blessings of God those are those those are the revival fires those are the emotional outburst I want you to believe with me and had confidence in me and you and your pastor that he is a spirit filled man and I'm gonna have confidence in you that you are spirit filled that God is gonna work with me because I'm the only one that can make my own call you know in my young days of being in this message I was running run them all over the country do you think I got it do you think well how does he know if I got it or not because I'm a nice guy brother Brett says a lot my sister guys out there than us you don't come to this church you don't come what's it called spirit tree tavern eyes but you don't come because there ain't no churches in West Palm Beach that would treat you better all right oh man you can give them these some of these these Christian sites and some of these churches rubber branches they can out love us they yeah programs you can go to socials you have soup suppers and parties and just have a wonderful relaxed comfortable life yeah but you come here because you're calling an election has steered you this way it has brought you to the words hey man that word is following hey now so somebody somebody there's going to be some overcomers Amen in there there's going to be something I'm glad to be a part of them always sing I'm one of them that's it I'm one of them I'm one of them I'm so glad yeah I'm so good now we may not sing it like y'all do we don't sing amazing grace like y'all do I think brother Jack makes him up as he goes and y'all love you so much I'll just follow along it's a little girl here she's good I can tell because she she just making it up this she goes follow special friend god bless you for for following the word you know I appreciate emotion I know the Pentecostal elements they just all live with that those few quotes you know if you ain't got no emotion you're dead nothing wrong with being a little emotional but it's the word it's just just coming on the trips he's brother band I guess in leadership in Covina California thought the message was pretty hard he said I know it's a stern cutting message brother but I didn't come here and choose a message to the people just to try to make them sing and shout and holler see most of these Pentecostals message churches that are living in the glare that Pentecostal ain't it's all about yes the singing and the shouting and the hollering I've been in even meetings where they done the same I'm interested in your life right man yeah I'm a certain of God that's got to answer to God the ministry that the Lord has given me makes me interested in your life your man jesus said follow me my god get rid of what you got and follow me any man and that's the only way to have eternal life I didn't that didn't choose a message just to make you sing and shout and holler right is it wrong to sing and shout in Holland it can't be that order yeah y'all ever get know I'm not here brother we never been ordered and I know we wore out the old Pentecostal thing with wildfire breaks up there's no wet blankets around to put it out it ain't gonna matter it's the word hey - the teaching of the word you just have Pentecost was as sooo many of these message churches are living in the glare of the Pentecostal age yes I didn't try to just give them a hot mess adjusting and shouting holler we're gonna take on Sunday on Sunday we're gonna looking at the life of job and and and one overcomer one overcomer in that age and that was Joe Joe being a prophet having an insight into fellowship with God that the prophet marveled and wanted our fellowship to be like that will will begin to build into that if our musician sisters for come it's it's Friday night I don't hardly ever go to church on Friday night so I don't know when to start at the end y'all sing that song piece of God's cover me do you sing that piece of God do you know you don't know it all my goodness okay how quick can he put it on the board can you type fast can let me see your hands I don't know this man back here oh your well dear sister I apologize all right but I gotta get it on the board I'm talk to you a few more minutes while she gets it on the board force just just says it's a course and and and just just may not be your style of worship but it's just a beautiful beautiful little course I do that wherever I go I pick songs that people don't know I appreciate me what I believe are true overcomers amen like I said I can't convince you I'm gonna I'm one I know my life tries to speak of a true believer your life tries to speak with true believers but when the testing comes it'll be him that overcomes it that overcomes God trying to condition his people so he can get from them get from them what he created him for he never made you to be something besides the Son and the daughter of God he's talking to believers now talking to the elect not talking to the world out there he did make them to be something else so many people struggle with that they look at those those quotes of brother Branham when he tried to define election for us he makes a very horrific statements by their standards all these that have walked away and criticized when the Prophet looks out at the mass of humanity and he simply sums them up as they are cannon fodder for an atomic gas well that's cruel it's not cruel it's looking at election it's looking the tragedy of the masses in front that God reached down for one one out of that he pulls six out of the days of John the bad news he pulled two out of the days of those children gone through the wilderness he pulled three out of the days of love Daniel yes and they were over comers yeah and if Satan has robbed you this is in restoration of the broad tree if Satan has robbed you of the privilege of being a son or a daughter of God we have a right this morning by the holy spirit to enforce the claim of God and bring him back if Satan has robbed you of that we have the ability we have a right before God to enforce the laws of God if you are sick tonight we have a right as true he let sons and daughters of God we have a right you might find that song right on the online system oh you got Internet here they might find it you want to be teaching you something I'm

there's nothing Satan can do that can stop us a man from achieving what God has already ordained us to do this reminded a man of the statement that I heard a few weeks ago brother Isaiah Brooks was just talking about how the Lord allowed the Prophet to go beyond the curtain of time as he was there you know and angels are showing them all the people he's like are these brands like no no no no no random converse to your commerce because pause group hears I can't Rufus here and he says well you know I've reached the same thing Paul preached and and if all gonna be judged by wait preach to my proof sustained thing all three to nine by that same thing and said millions scream that we're resting on them and just a mid fact by God allowing the Prophet to go to the other side it showed that he was already a little bit calmer [Music] amen to dismissals tonight back for our time free on Sunday morning Sunday school at 9:30 in the service amen at 10:30 if you all remember brother for an art Jean Mary and his precious family Miami their mother had passed away she was 97 years old I believe tomorrow they're gonna be having a homegoing service for her down in Miami so if you just remember
