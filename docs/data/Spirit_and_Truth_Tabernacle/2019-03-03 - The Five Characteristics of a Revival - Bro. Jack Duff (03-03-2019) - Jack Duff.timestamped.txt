[11:23] early mornings coming home leaving the
[11:25] house dark and coming home and it was
[11:28] beginning to wear on her body
[11:31] just really desired her to be able to
[11:35] have something closer so it wouldn't be
[11:38] such a striking honor so this position
[11:40] came home and she said well I gotta
[11:43] apply for this we were busy with
[11:45] something and all that week and it came
[11:47] through the last day of the closing the

[1:12:38] one time four thousand man got his
[1:12:40] family in his arms we're going to see

[1:14:02] loaves of bread and I can imagine it

[1:20:35] forth break the the power the enemy and
[1:20:38] in the lives of your people every chain
[1:20:41] guard let it be broken I recall in
[1:20:44] Scripture the Bible says that's Peter
[1:20:46] yet spake these words the Holy Ghost
[1:20:48] fell on the people so what we're praying
[1:20:50] that you would do just that today thank
[1:20:53] you for all things that have been done
[1:20:55] we know there's a little bit more that
[1:20:56] you want to do so help us all to enter
[1:20:57] in and receive from heaven even at this
[1:21:00] moment we take every spirit that's
[1:21:01] against the Spirit of God underneath the
[1:21:03] control of the Holy Ghost even now Jesus
[1:21:05] name we pray amen amen god bless you can
[1:21:08] be seated praise the Lord we want to use
[1:21:13] a man for our title today five
[1:21:16] characteristics of revival amen five
[1:21:20] characteristics of revival and just bear
[1:21:23] with me as we just kind of get through
[1:21:25] this thought there's a few little things
[1:21:27] that I just want to drop here and there
[1:21:29] and we'll just see what the Lord where
[1:21:31] the Lord takes this a man but I want to
[1:21:33] start a man with a quote from the third
[1:21:35] seal
[1:21:37] as I prepare to just read this quote
[1:21:39] this is a quote that as I was coming up
[1:21:42] in a man in church various meetings that
[1:21:45] we would tend this was a quote that was
[1:21:48] very harped on a lot of people would
[1:21:49] read this and and they were just really
[1:21:51] really focused on it focus on it focus
[1:21:53] on it and and when I read it what it
[1:21:56] does is actually takes a revival and
[1:21:58] puts the revival in the future a man it
[1:22:01] constantly puts a revival in the future
[1:22:04] but uh but today a man by faith I'm
[1:22:07] bringing it a man not just I'm not
[1:22:09] putting in a future I'm bringing that
[1:22:11] present tense a man by faith I want to
[1:22:13] bring it there but let's just look at
[1:22:15] this as a statement here out of the
[1:22:17] third seal he says now that's what's the
[1:22:19] reason today the revival that we're
[1:22:21] supposed to have
[1:22:23] we have denominational revivals we
[1:22:26] haven't had a real stirring no no no no
[1:22:31] sir don't think we got revivals right he
[1:22:35] say don't think we got revivals we
[1:22:36] haven't oh they got millions and
[1:22:38] millions and millions of church members
[1:22:40] but not a revival no we're right no no
[1:22:43] the bride hasn't had a revival yet see
[1:22:46] there has been no revival there no
[1:22:49] manifestation of God to stir the bride
[1:22:51] yet see we're looking for it it will
[1:22:54] take those seven unknown thunders back
[1:22:56] there to wake her up again he will send
[1:22:59] it he promised it now now watch see now
[1:23:02] she was dead so now when they read this
[1:23:04] quote they're always I say the bride
[1:23:06] hasn't had a revival yet a man that says
[1:23:09] we're looking for it and it says it's
[1:23:11] gonna take the seven unknown thunders to
[1:23:13] wake her up again now I want to just
[1:23:15] drop something off if that's what he
[1:23:17] said that we're looking for it a man and
[1:23:19] it's going to take the seven unknown
[1:23:21] thunders the wake up again what we do
[1:23:24] know a man is that a man the revelation
[1:23:27] of the seven unknown thunders were
[1:23:29] contained in the seals hallelujah amen
[1:23:34] the revelation progressed if I can put
[1:23:37] it that way this statement was made as
[1:23:39] he was preaching the seals but after the
[1:23:41] seals have opened a man maybe that maybe
[1:23:44] the rest of the world and realize it but
[1:23:46] surprise entered into
[1:23:48] revival hallelujah somebody amen and
[1:23:51] this revival was something that a man
[1:23:54] that we entered into because of the
[1:23:56] opening of the world right and since
[1:23:59] we're living underneath the opening on
[1:24:01] the word can I said this way we are in
[1:24:04] continuous revival hallelujah so I wanna
[1:24:08] say it I make it real clear

[1:26:48] to say agar a true great revival and
[1:26:50] don't get headlines a true great revival
[1:26:57] and let me tell you I n1 right now it
[1:27:00] don't get a true great revival don't get
[1:27:04] headlines and things like that no no
[1:27:06] there's one thing that Jesus lacked in
[1:27:09] his life I hate to say that but he did
[1:27:12] Jesus like one thing what is that a
[1:27:15] modern showmanship Jesus was not a
[1:27:21] show-off
[1:27:24] showmanship oh my god I mean you know
[1:27:28] actually it wouldn't probably be Jesus
[1:27:31] you know trying to run a television
[1:27:33] broadcast that's not the way it would be
[1:27:35] well if Jesus was on earth today what
[1:27:37] what happens that you have people live
[1:27:39] streaming him
[1:27:40] Whitney phones he wouldn't be running a
[1:27:44] telephone block broadcast the people
[1:27:45] would be live streaming what was going
[1:27:47] on oh my god hey man listen he said
[1:27:50] Jesus he said one the teens like one
[1:27:53] thing a modern showmanship he wasn't a
[1:27:55] show-off no to say that but he said says
[1:27:58] everybody today's got to have a great
[1:28:01] big headlines and bragging what they're
[1:28:03] doing that's a stuff sir that's right
[1:28:05] that's not a servant of God a servant of
[1:28:07] God will be humble keeping himself back
[1:28:11] and when the revival comes look we'll
[1:28:14] always come when it come in the days of
[1:28:16] Jesus just in the minority just a few
[1:28:19] people
[1:28:20] listen look what John had out there on
[1:28:23] the banks just a few people gathered
[1:28:25] around from the regions around about to
[1:28:26] hear him about 99 percent of them
[1:28:29] rejected his message and walked away
[1:28:31] yeah it was a great revival and a
[1:28:34] shaking time God shakes things oh I love
[1:28:40] that statement God shake things so
[1:28:45] sometimes you start going through little
[1:28:47] things here and there and you wonder
[1:28:48] where this came from God six things
[1:28:52] maybe your boss get a little upset with
[1:28:55] you you wonder whether you're gonna keep
[1:28:56] that job or not
[1:28:57] God shakes things and people don't
[1:29:02] realize it's being done see God shakes
[1:29:06] his church the revival is to his church
[1:29:09] I like that I like that it's not to the
[1:29:12] denomination but it's to his church
[1:29:13] notice what the Bible said if my people
[1:29:19] if my people let me go a little further
[1:29:23] who are called by my name do you know
[1:29:26] his name
[1:29:27] Oh church revolving for everybody it's
[1:29:32] for his church and if it's my people
[1:29:35] that are called by my name
[1:29:36] you know Jesus came in his father's name
[1:29:40] the reason that I'm Doug is because I
[1:29:43] took on my father's name hallelujah
[1:29:46] whatever your last name is it's because
[1:29:49] you took on yet the name you were born
[1:29:50] with that's because you took on your
[1:29:52] father's name and if you got married you
[1:29:54] should have took on your husband's name
[1:29:57] hello somebody we don't got this thing
[1:30:00] on mixed up nowadays not a husband's
[1:30:03] ticket on the wife's name that's
[1:30:04] preferred it's the wife's brother take
[1:30:06] on the hospice name she leaves her
[1:30:09] father and a mother now she joins forces
[1:30:12] with a husband hallelujah but when you
[1:30:14] were born you took on your daddy's name
[1:30:16] you didn't choose the name and whatever
[1:30:19] your daddy's name was that was your name
[1:30:21] unless you were adopted into the family
[1:30:23] you still took only daddy's name if you
[1:30:26] was adopted
[1:30:27] praise the Lord somebody right with
[1:30:31] Jesus came in his father's name so if if
[1:30:35] we call him Jesus if we know him as
[1:30:38] Jesus then his daddy's name was Jesus
[1:30:45] you understand not father son Holy Ghost
[1:30:47] he took on his father's name yes so the
[1:30:51] name of Jesus must be the name that the
[1:30:53] name of the son must be the name of the
[1:30:55] father that's why we baptize in the name
[1:30:59] of the Lord Jesus Christ not just a
[1:31:02] title Father Son and Holy Ghost but in
[1:31:04] the name what is his name
[1:31:08] Sourav I've only come to the people that
[1:31:10] are called by his name
[1:31:14] [Music]
[1:31:18] looking for you'll never receive it
[1:31:20] they'll never get headlines because it
[1:31:23] comes amen to those that I called by his
[1:31:25] name if my people which are called by my
[1:31:29] name so humble themselves and pray seek
[1:31:33] my face turn from their wicked ways
[1:31:39] that's thus sayeth the Lord
[1:31:42] Oh hallelujah people don't even know
[1:31:45] what real revival is come on I'm good I
[1:31:48] want to give some characteristics of it
[1:31:50] so Lizzie says he says I believe that
[1:31:53] the church is called out now see the
[1:31:56] robbers to his church I believe that the
[1:31:57] church is called out now but the thing
[1:31:59] to revive is to revive and shake the
[1:32:02] church to his place again
[1:32:04] so revival is going to shake the church
[1:32:07] hallelujah not the rest of everybody
[1:32:09] else that's not called by his name that
[1:32:11] can't be shook but revival come to shape
[1:32:14] the church hallelujah let me go a little
[1:32:17] further
[1:32:17] amen amen now you know there's a couple
[1:32:22] of things that I want to just kind of
[1:32:23] make mention now I won't read all of
[1:32:24] this but you know every day the prophets
[1:32:28] say every generation has given their
[1:32:30] chance at a revival every generation so
[1:32:34] you know even when God took his prophet
[1:32:36] home revival did stop revival continue
[1:32:39] know and there was a bird supposed to be
[1:32:42] certain characteristics that were there
[1:32:44] for you to know that you were in revival
[1:32:46] hallelujah I want to give them to you I
[1:32:49] want to give them to you just bear with
[1:32:51] me here there are certain things that
[1:32:52] you would see and when you begin to see
[1:32:55] like like if I was if I was getting my
[1:32:57] car and I wanted to go to Miami
[1:32:58] I know Amen just by living here in
[1:33:01] Florida I know I got to go south to get
[1:33:02] to Miami and there are certain roles
[1:33:04] that would take me down there right and
[1:33:06] when I get on those roads I want to see
[1:33:08] signs telling me that I'm headed towards
[1:33:11] Miami Amen I might see one side say
[1:33:14] Miami is 50 miles and if I keep driving
[1:33:17] I should see some say Miami 35 miles but
[1:33:20] I keep driving should say Miami 20 miles
[1:33:22] amen and eventually I'm gonna get to the
[1:33:25] point where it's gonna say welcome to
[1:33:26] Miami
[1:33:28] hallelujah imma be there but but see the
[1:33:31] thing of it is we got to see some of the
[1:33:33] science that God is trying to point out
[1:33:34] to us you are in revival right now amen
[1:33:38] don't get caught with that quote and
[1:33:40] misplace it hallelujah because there's
[1:33:43] still some people waiting the prophets
[1:33:45] been gone for years
[1:33:46] and they still waiting the thunders have
[1:33:49] already ordered and the revelations are
[1:33:52] contained in all seven seals praise God
[1:33:56] that's what the prophet told us yes
[1:33:59] hallelujah let me go in a little further
[1:34:01] he said this in a smyrnaean church age
[1:34:04] says he that hath an ear let him hear
[1:34:06] what the Spirit says to the churches now
[1:34:08] this is going to be critical because in
[1:34:09] order for you to be in revival this is
[1:34:12] gonna be part of it just gonna be one of
[1:34:14] the characteristics look at this says he
[1:34:16] that hath the needle let him hear what
[1:34:17] the Spirit says to the churches of each
[1:34:19] age and every age it was the same cry
[1:34:22] hear what the Spirit says if you are a
[1:34:26] Christian you will get back to what the
[1:34:29] Spirit is teaching he told you what the
[1:34:38] Spirit was teaching what is the spirit
[1:34:41] teaching I can tell you this hallelujah
[1:34:44] let me just let me just let me just take
[1:34:47] my time right here the Spirit is not
[1:34:49] teaching get in the booth right that's

[1:35:04] raining all the time here floor and he
[1:35:07] invite you to come get us both that
[1:35:08] Capote I'm not giving it that was a
[1:35:11] message for they go by

[1:35:17] side and I'd kill the lamb a goat or a
[1:35:20] lamb or something and they taking blood
[1:35:21] and putting on the top of a doe not
[1:35:23] literally like that anymore
[1:35:26] amen but the token is the life that you
[1:35:28] live by the Holy Ghost message like that
[1:35:33] I'm not gonna put that up on my on my
[1:35:35] door and on my side post like that
[1:35:37] that's message that message what they
[1:35:39] going by hallelujah hallelujah glory to
[1:35:42] God if somebody preached them to you
[1:35:44] only the restoration of the gifts that's
[1:35:48] a message for a day gone by if somebody
[1:35:52] preaching to you only that the just
[1:35:53] shall live by faith that's a message for
[1:35:56] a day that's gone by if they only
[1:35:59] preached in sanctification that's the
[1:36:02] message for they go by we need all that
[1:36:05] we need justification we need
[1:36:07] sanctification
[1:36:08] we need the restoration of the gifts but
[1:36:10] on top of that we need the restoration
[1:36:13] of the word in a message for your day go
[1:36:19] preach the restoration of that word oh I
[1:36:22] got some things I got to say here they
[1:36:27] haven't brought you to the restoration
[1:36:28] of word and they've stopped short oh
[1:36:30] that's a promise from God a man that
[1:36:33] according to revelation 10 all the
[1:36:35] mysteries of God would be revealed when
[1:36:37] the seventh angel begin to sound so the
[1:36:39] question is who was that seventh angel
[1:36:41] also as we said before amen destructions
[1:36:44] trying to caught a strike a quarter in
[1:36:46] Malachi chapter 4 the last two verses

[1:36:50] Prophet we better find who is he who is
[1:36:52] he Elijah hallelujah let me go on a
[1:36:56] little further he says he that hath an
[1:36:58] ear let him hear what the Spirit says to
[1:36:59] the churches of each age in every age it
[1:37:02] was the same cry hear what the Spirit
[1:37:06] says if you are a Christian you will get
[1:37:07] back to what the Spirit is teaching
[1:37:10] hallelujah a man hallelujah you say I've
[1:37:16] been to denominational Church and I felt
[1:37:17] the Spirit of God yeah God want to let

[1:37:21] there

[1:37:39] further it says you'll get back to what
[1:37:41] the Spirit is teaching that is the word
[1:37:42] of this age every messenger to every age
[1:37:47] will preach that word here it is every
[1:37:50] fresh and true revival here's a
[1:37:54] characteristic every fresh and true
[1:37:56] revival will be because men have gotten
[1:38:01] back to the word for their age can I be
[1:38:05] both you ain't even have a no revival if
[1:38:08] you not fellowship around this word the
[1:38:14] fresh and true revival come because
[1:38:17] you've gotten back to the word for your
[1:38:19] age and we are we're with fellowship and
[1:38:21] around that this open revelation listen
[1:38:23] the crime every age is to rebuke you
[1:38:26] have left the Word of God repent and
[1:38:28] come back to the word from first book in
[1:38:31] the Bible Genesis 2 the last book
[1:38:33] revelation there's only one reason for
[1:38:35] God's displeasure leaving the word and
[1:38:37] there's only one remedy to regain his
[1:38:39] favor and that's back to the world you
[1:38:41] know we were talking this morning to

[1:39:06] they're taking you know you got people
[1:39:07] that want to be apostle's well how you
[1:39:10] gonna be a pastor and you ain't never
[1:39:11] setup no church right you you've never
[1:39:14] set up one church but you want to run
[1:39:16] you want the title pasta does that make
[1:39:18] you feel like you somebody right you got
[1:39:21] you got now they don't even have deacons
[1:39:23] in the church no more they everybody's a
[1:39:25] pastor how can everybody be the pastor
[1:39:28] right well I got the pastor of this
[1:39:30] ministry in the past of that ministry
[1:39:32] and you know and we got we got all
[1:39:35] titles and you know what we have is a
[1:39:36] lot of chiefs of no Indians really words
[1:39:44] that's actually absolutely been abuse
[1:39:47] let me put it that way I want to say it
[1:39:49] like the spirits say people are built in
[1:39:51] God's Word Bishop and it's a woman
[1:39:59] claiming the title bishop
[1:40:01] now the reason she got that title
[1:40:03] because of how the man operates in that
[1:40:05] title so she want the same power equal
[1:40:07] Authority that that man has so she
[1:40:09] wouldn't be called bishop regardless of
[1:40:12] what the Bible say the Bible say the
[1:40:14] bishop got to be husband of one wife so
[1:40:22] what you got going on in the church if
[1:40:24] you got the women as bishops praise the
[1:40:27] Lord in a man it's time to come back to
[1:40:31] the world and the only way you don't
[1:40:34] have revival is you got to come back to
[1:40:37] the words
[1:40:38] [Applause]
[1:40:41] Jesus some characteristics of revived
[1:40:46] praise God this is for my people if my
[1:40:50] people which are called by hearing
[1:41:01] everybody's prayer like that but if my
[1:41:03] people which are called by my name hey
[1:41:07] everybody truth description trying to
[1:41:09] apply but that's why they revive us
[1:41:10] fizzle out we are in continuous revival
[1:41:14] we don't have to wait for no preacher to
[1:41:16] come because revival not the preacher
[1:41:18] don't have it in this Bible and all the
[1:41:24] preacher doing is adding to the
[1:41:26] environment it's already created and
[1:41:28] when you get himself by the way God
[1:41:30] begin to use them we just we just have a
[1:41:32] mighty time in the Lord but revival is
[1:41:35] going on before a preacher God yeah and
[1:41:37] when the preacher libre power still
[1:41:40] going on continuous revival
[1:41:44] stay with me here o prayer some of the
[1:41:48] other things that I think that would
[1:41:49] come and revival amen
[1:41:51] something that some of the attributes or
[1:41:53] characteristics you'll see prayer and
[1:41:55] fasting you know you remember Jesus a
[1:41:58] man was there it's coming down off the
[1:42:00] Alpha Mount Transfiguration in Matthew
[1:42:04] 17 and after he you know kind of reveal
[1:42:08] you know some thanks to the disciples
[1:42:10] and told him what was given to happen as
[1:42:12] far as his death was concerned here this
[1:42:14] man come running up to Jesus and they
[1:42:16] say you know my son is a lunatic could
[1:42:18] you please help them it's safe could you
[1:42:20] could you please do something for my
[1:42:21] Sunday night I took him to your
[1:42:23] disciples and and and they they just
[1:42:25] couldn't get this boy they couldn't get
[1:42:28] his problem solved I took him to the Sun
[1:42:30] Jesus a you know I mean Oh faith listen
[1:42:33] and and and our generation say bring the
[1:42:35] boy to me I'll do something fun and I
[1:42:38] believe that Amen when we've got true
[1:42:40] revival going we ought not to be afraid
[1:42:42] of any circumstance
[1:42:44] any situation bring bring the situation
[1:42:46] there we'll take care of it right so so
[1:42:48] Jesus I say bring the boy here and
[1:42:50] when you come there you know before
[1:42:52] Jesus and man he just had a fit you know
[1:42:55] and finally Jesus prayed for him and and
[1:42:57] the spirit left to me they even thought
[1:42:59] the boat was dead but but he just picked
[1:43:00] them up and raised them up and the boy
[1:43:02] went on his way in his right mind so the
[1:43:04] disciples came to Jesus apart came to
[1:43:06] him on the side they say now now now now
[1:43:08] our Jesus why couldn't we can't stop
[1:43:11] that different brother branham say the
[1:43:12] disciples the way there was approached
[1:43:13] to say made me feel the same I let me
[1:43:15] show y'all how it's done and then John
[1:43:17] say John say Peter you ain't getting no
[1:43:19] results let me show you how it's done
[1:43:20] and they need each one said no let me
[1:43:22] show you how to and nobody got no
[1:43:24] results so we say say say they say Jesus
[1:43:27] why can we get that bad boy can't they
[1:43:30] say first of all your unbelief is a
[1:43:32] problem that's the first problem your
[1:43:35] unbelief and then they say secondly amen
[1:43:38] this time goes out only by fasting and
[1:43:43] prayers hallelujah do you see we got to
[1:43:47] come back to that because that's just a
[1:43:49] simple characteristic if you want to see
[1:43:52] God move in the church you don't have to
[1:43:54] put some fasting and prayer behind it
[1:43:56] come on somebody you can have the you
[1:44:00] have the index of fasting and prayer
[1:44:03] hallelujah glory to God quote after
[1:44:06] quote after quote I can show you on
[1:44:08] fasting and prayer amen
[1:44:09] butBut that should be one that one of
[1:44:11] the the the characteristics of revival
[1:44:15] you should see fasting and prayer let me
[1:44:17] go on a little further you know now the
[1:44:19] Bible said here if my people were to
[1:44:21] cover my name shall humble themselves
[1:44:23] humble themselves humble themselves
[1:44:27] oh come on somebody another another way
[1:44:30] you've got see revivals people are gonna
[1:44:32] get humble not boastful humble
[1:44:37] themselves and I remember brother
[1:44:40] Branham making a statement say we're
[1:44:42] honest hearts can't admit that they're
[1:44:45] wrong this is where revival starts when
[1:44:50] people humble themselves and can admit
[1:44:52] Lord I'm wrong you know my you know I've
[1:44:55] seen it just over the years folk can be
[1:44:58] wrong and they know they wrong but they
[1:45:00] will go on like they never did
[1:45:04] don't do that don't let your heart get
[1:45:06] so hard that when God began to deal with
[1:45:09] you about your wrong that you just
[1:45:10] overlook it and just kind of keep going
[1:45:12] no humble yourself hallelujah
[1:45:15] when foking humble themselves then God
[1:45:17] can do something with them look at this
[1:45:20] they say when honest hearts can admit
[1:45:22] they're wrong that's the place where
[1:45:23] revival will start so amen that's
[1:45:25] another characteristic a man and and
[1:45:28] remember I said no minister can bring
[1:45:29] them revive the revivals coming by the
[1:45:31] people and every fresh and true revival
[1:45:33] will be because men have gotten back to
[1:45:35] the word for their age now this is one
[1:45:37] other little statement that I want to
[1:45:39] make here and this message Israel in the
[1:45:41] church because we also know that revival
[1:45:43] is the washing of the trash onto the
[1:45:46] shore is that right we know that's a
[1:45:49] characteristic of the revival the trash
[1:45:51] in your life should be washed up to the
[1:45:53] shore Oh glory amen God guarding you
[1:45:58] know when that brother brems he was out
[1:45:59] there looking at the water he said
[1:46:01] wasn't that any new water came in
[1:46:04] hallelujah he said wasn't any new water
[1:46:07] that came in he said but the water that
[1:46:08] was there just begin to have a little
[1:46:10] churn in and as that water begin
[1:46:13] attorney say what's going to say the
[1:46:14] trash that was inside the waters been
[1:46:16] washed up to the shore right that's a
[1:46:18] characteristic of revival we should see
[1:46:20] trash coming out of your life being
[1:46:23] washed up to the shore but I had to go
[1:46:30] get something for you because in order
[1:46:32] to preach the five characteristics of it
[1:46:34] I had to give you a quote that kind of
[1:46:37] set the balance on that statement so
[1:46:40] read let me read this Israel in the
[1:46:42] church don't just stop with just the
[1:46:45] washing of the trash on the shore
[1:46:46] there's no there's a little bit more
[1:46:47] let's look at this it says this he says
[1:46:50] the little old tabernacle I've been back
[1:46:52] many times an hour two or maybe four be
[1:46:56] in for service since this is my first
[1:46:59] time to come back or anywhere to try to
[1:47:00] hold a revival we're starting tonight a
[1:47:04] revival - my opinion doesn't consist of
[1:47:07] well bringing in new members that's not
[1:47:11] all it does it says a revival doesn't
[1:47:14] consist of a
[1:47:16] bunch of conversions and I love this
[1:47:21] statement although those things go along
[1:47:24] with a revival y'all stay with me on
[1:47:28] that one
[1:47:28] and don't don't consist of a bunch of
[1:47:31] conversions but it did say we convinced
[1:47:34] consist of none stay with amen amen
[1:47:40] revival doesn't consist of a bunch of
[1:47:42] convergence although those things are
[1:47:44] along with the revival but a revival is
[1:47:47] to revive what you already got
[1:47:49] just to get them revive revival is
[1:47:54] revived what you already got just to get
[1:47:57] them revived but not now he didn't say
[1:47:59] that it wouldn't be in a convergence
[1:48:01] because there will be something now I
[1:48:04] can talk about the five characteristics
[1:48:08] this quote is something that's going
[1:48:11] we're going to take our time with I'm
[1:48:13] going to list some things this is how to
[1:48:14] speak to the mountain and we're gonna
[1:48:16] take our time with this now look at
[1:48:17] listen to this now we're trying to place
[1:48:22] the revival just in the best setting
[1:48:24] that we can we do not what we call major
[1:48:27] own divine healing because divine
[1:48:29] healing is a minor and you cannot major
[1:48:32] on a minor we know that so the great
[1:48:34] thing that we've that were after for any
[1:48:38] revival the great thing that we're after
[1:48:40] for any revival is to bring lost souls
[1:48:43] to Christ first it might not be a lot of
[1:48:47] convergence but it's gonna be some so
[1:48:50] the first thing that we look for in the
[1:48:51] Reviver are lost souls being one the
[1:48:53] Christ
[1:48:59] you tell me I lost those being one to
[1:49:03] Christ did they happen in your church
[1:49:06] you in revival you are in revival you
[1:49:12] just got to know where the sign sign I
[1:49:16] lost souls being one the Christ even if
[1:49:19] it's only two that's so it might not be
[1:49:24] some great thing to hit the head but
[1:49:28] it's enough to let us know that we are
[1:49:29] here
[1:49:32] [Applause]
[1:49:35] praise God Church this is a
[1:49:39] characteristic when you see this you
[1:49:42] know where you're at lost souls lost
[1:49:46] souls to Christ
[1:49:48] first listen revive the church this is
[1:49:51] the second thing revive the church back
[1:49:54] into a spiritual condition we look for
[1:49:58] that so now that's something for the
[1:49:59] people that's already here and maybe not
[1:50:02] just the ones that's already here but
[1:50:03] people that know this truth and God want
[1:50:08] to revive you back to your spiritual
[1:50:09] condition hallelujah glory to God man
[1:50:16] obviously you know we don't we don't we
[1:50:18] don't we don't we don't kind of lost
[1:50:20] what our condition was so sometimes you
[1:50:23] have to go in church like you go to a
[1:50:24] doctor you know your doctor you get sick
[1:50:27] praise the Lord you get sick and you
[1:50:29] want to go to the doctor and have them
[1:50:31] check things out and you don't know why
[1:50:32] you feel in the way you feel praise God
[1:50:35] and you go to the doctor and the doctor
[1:50:36] a man he tell you to do something
[1:50:38] however he want to check your
[1:50:39] temperature he want to check your
[1:50:42] condition and he tell you just open your
[1:50:44] mouth and say ahh and he stick a look at
[1:50:47] the thermometer down there to kind of
[1:50:49] check your condition just check your
[1:50:51] temperature right and you're going
[1:50:53] through all these types of types of
[1:50:54] things and what the Holy Spirit is doing
[1:50:56] is dropping a spiritual thermometer
[1:50:59] into the midst of the people to check
[1:51:02] their condition they may and based on
[1:51:05] what the results of the thermometer is
[1:51:07] he know what what what to give you
[1:51:10] somebody based on the results of your
[1:51:13] spiritual thermometer the Holy Ghost
[1:51:15] know exactly what to give you hallelujah
[1:51:21] listen oh my gosh amen hey try a safe
[1:51:24] they say uh he says revive the church
[1:51:28] back into a spiritual condition the
[1:51:31] Spirit of God comes to do that it's said
[1:51:32] to where it should be then he goes on he
[1:51:35] said this is a third thing that
[1:51:37] shouldn't happen in revival there should
[1:51:39] be close communion with God close
[1:51:44] communion with God now I'm gonna tell
[1:51:46] you I'm just giving you the highlights
[1:51:48] but I'm gonna hit each one of these
[1:51:50] that's why I say I won't have time to do
[1:51:52] it all today but I may hit each one
[1:51:53] we're gonna go into each one but here
[1:51:55] first is lost souls to Christ
[1:51:58] second amen revive the church back into
[1:52:01] a spiritual condition third amen close
[1:52:04] communion with God hallelujah amen and
[1:52:08] then the fourth we'll look at this
[1:52:10] bring fellowship among the churches for
[1:52:28] revival supposed to bring fellowship
[1:52:30] among churches do not get oh how you're
[1:52:34] gonna call yourself in my bar only your
[1:52:36] church fellowship you don't never go to
[1:52:39] nobody else Church huh you won't go
[1:52:42] fellowship with nobody else
[1:52:43] you only go if your favorite preacher
[1:52:45] there huh that ain't revival come on
[1:52:49] somebody true revival with
[1:52:52] to to fellowship with other church acts
[1:52:56] now I'm gonna have to break that down
[1:52:58] for you and not every Church other
[1:53:02] churches not every Church cuz how can
[1:53:08] two walk together except they be agreed
[1:53:15] but here's another one
[1:53:17] and he says fellowship among other among
[1:53:19] churches 36 and forth pray for the sick
[1:53:22] so revivals supposed to produce prayer
[1:53:25] for the sick so that's our aim our tribe
[1:53:30] is Dennis verse fellowship with the
[1:53:34] churches a close walk with that with the
[1:53:36] Church of Church to God and then pray
[1:53:38] for the sick now I'm gonna break all
[1:53:40] those down because really what he said
[1:53:42] winning souls of Christ was number one
[1:53:44] he said the church restores right
[1:53:46] condition was number two then he said
[1:53:48] close communion with God was number
[1:53:51] three and then it said fellowship
[1:53:53] amongst other churches was number four
[1:53:54] and then he said prayer for six that
[1:53:56] prayer for the sick that's number five
[1:53:58] so there are five characteristics that
[1:54:00] should be a part of every Bible can I
[1:54:03] just talk about this prayer for the sick
[1:54:04] just for a little bit
[1:54:06] whoa hallelujah if we am revival then
[1:54:10] there should be some prayer for the sick
[1:54:12] now I remember a few weeks ago early the
[1:54:15] beginning of the year brother Trevor it
[1:54:17] come through and he preached a man on a
[1:54:19] sermon no one needs to know we're at
[1:54:23] brother westcoast church and he any
[1:54:24] preach see if we were a fellowship in
[1:54:26] with other churches missing all night
[1:54:29] fellas shipping with other truck could
[1:54:31] we Emory power that's what we do when we
[1:54:33] Emory Bible let me put it this way I'm
[1:54:35] in revival because when you're in
[1:54:39] revival these are five characteristics
[1:54:41] that go along with Irv out hallelujah
[1:54:43] your revival is not selfish
[1:54:47] huh if you really Reviver you want
[1:54:50] everybody to know yes praise God but we
[1:54:54] went there to brother westcoast church
[1:54:56] and brother Trevor preach the message no
[1:54:57] one needs to know and after that after
[1:55:00] the message was preached a prayer line
[1:55:01] was formed for those that were sin sick
[1:55:04] they were hiding things amen and and
[1:55:07] they just want to count exposed it that
[1:55:09] night so a prayer line came forth and
[1:55:11] those that were sensing walked into the
[1:55:13] prayer line and God begin to do
[1:55:15] something for them and I want to tell
[1:55:16] many of you that might have winning that
[1:55:18] prayer line and maybe after the prayer
[1:55:19] line you still feel that same devil
[1:55:21] attacking you if you were praying for
[1:55:22] keep confessing your healing don't base
[1:55:29] your healing on your feeling I want to
[1:55:35] see that again
[1:55:36] don't grace your healing or your feeling
[1:55:39] those feelings are subject to change
[1:55:41] when the devil attack to keep confessing
[1:55:44] God's Word over to over the top of that
[1:55:46] watch what God do for you so so if you
[1:55:49] were praying for that night keep
[1:55:50] confessing your healing after after
[1:55:53] those meetings we had a service here in
[1:55:55] January brother quake who preached and
[1:55:56] after he preached I felt led to call for
[1:55:59] a prayer line and a man after his sermon
[1:56:01] just some of the testimonies that he was
[1:56:03] sharing amen there in his sermon and we
[1:56:05] become fair prayer line and I guess a
[1:56:07] week or so later sister Michelle
[1:56:10] testified of her healing in that prayer
[1:56:12] line because when a revival a man has
[1:56:15] broken out there should be prayer for
[1:56:17] the sick
[1:56:20] hallelujah glory to God just last Sunday
[1:56:24] you heard a two testimonies one of Amen
[1:56:29] brother Caleb that coming bus say he was
[1:56:32] in church sick but all of a sudden the
[1:56:35] Spirit of God began to move in here and
[1:56:37] as he began to shout and jumping he run
[1:56:40] around saying that's my granddaddy and
[1:56:42] all kind of other things that brother
[1:56:43] Caleb got caught up in the spirit before
[1:56:45] you knew it the sickness was gone
[1:56:47] hallelujah you can praise your way out
[1:56:50] of a sickness you can shout your way out
[1:56:53] of trouble
[1:56:55] hallelujah you can worship your way out
[1:56:58] of that thing the devil services is to
[1:57:01] keep you out of the environment you stay
[1:57:06] home and feel sorry for yourself but
[1:57:08] when you get here you forget about how
[1:57:10] you feel
[1:57:11] Amen you forget about what the devil's
[1:57:14] trying to do you begin to enter into
[1:57:16] your own personal revival brother Caleb
[1:57:24] received his healing and we heard sister
[1:57:27] Amanda glory to God she testified nobody
[1:57:31] never even laid hands on her now you
[1:57:33] know that's Bible right the Centurion he
[1:57:36] stopped Jesus please don't come to the
[1:57:39] house he say he said I'm not worried
[1:57:41] that if you should come in he said but
[1:57:43] if you would just speak the word only my
[1:57:46] sermon to be made whole hallelujah right
[1:57:49] so so sometimes you might I mean in
[1:57:51] brother Branham even said he said if you
[1:57:53] really have faith he said you wouldn't
[1:57:56] even get in the prayer huh and I sister
[1:57:59] took God at His Word and we a cancer
[1:58:02] attacking her body all she felt what she
[1:58:06] felt condemned about is that she never
[1:58:08] told the doctor that I don't have it and
[1:58:11] God God would not let that thing lift
[1:58:14] off of her she had that nurse where I
[1:58:16] should at least or the doctor that I
[1:58:17] thought I should have confessed it out

[1:58:20] and believe in my heart that's what I
[1:58:23] should've did it say and doctors begin
[1:58:25] the challenge of faith so when she went
[1:58:27] back to the doctor and the doctor saying
[1:58:29] I remember we went over this and we went
[1:58:31] over there and you got this you got that
[1:58:32] she said no I don't the doctor said wait

[1:58:44] and she spoke it by faith not know what
[1:58:48] what the results would be
[1:58:49] and the doctor taught what she was doing
[1:58:52] since the man didn't even realize what
[1:58:54] she was doing the doctors say oh you you
[1:58:57] you you you claiming it exactly I'm

[2:00:16] tests anyway do your tests I ain't got
[2:00:19] it and you know what may her happy the
[2:00:22] thing that made her rejoice is that she
[2:00:24] left the doctor's office knowing that
[2:00:27] she told the doctor what God had put in
[2:00:29] her heart to tell the doctors telling
[2:00:32] you ain't God she said it she went on
[2:00:38] home and then here a day or so go by and
[2:00:41] they call up and say ya got the results
[2:00:43] of your test yes just want to let you
[2:00:46] know uh-huh you ain't got it sometimes
[2:01:01] the miracles of God can become so common
[2:01:04] to us as its people that we can just say
[2:01:06] oh you just found that out I told you
[2:01:09] that when I was dead that I didn't have
[2:01:11] it and now you called me to let me know
[2:01:12] what I already told you yeah thank you
[2:01:16] ain't got it you ought to tell it to the
[2:01:19] divine got that whatever you tryin to
[2:01:21] put on your revival produced these
[2:01:27] things but it didn't start just with
[2:01:28] sister Amanda y'all know that right
[2:01:32] we've been in revival y'all remember
[2:01:35] sister turn your testimony and it wasn't
[2:01:37] just you know the way god this is a
[2:01:40] target is that he allowed it to grow so
[2:01:43] we can get a picture of it and if you
[2:01:48] doubt it if you don't believe this
[2:01:50] happened we gonna show you the picture
[2:01:52] he'd go befo and he'd go after after
[2:01:55] prayer was made by sister she have it no
[2:01:58] more either cancer disappeared but you
[2:02:05] remember the same night sister tangles
[2:02:06] briefer since the birds was free for she
[2:02:09] was barely able to walk
[2:02:11] she had cramps in the legs amen but
[2:02:14] after prayer that night she went to the
[2:02:15] hospital now I mean to the airport the
[2:02:17] next day she was walking like it was
[2:02:18] nothing she said she had the best sleep
[2:02:20] she'd ever had in days because God heal

[2:08:19] you need to be baptized in its name
[2:08:21] praise God in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:08:23] Christ even if you have been baptized
[2:08:26] once before you need to be rebaptised

[2:08:47] take up serpents and if they drink any
[2:08:48] deadly thing it shall not hurt them they
[2:08:50] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[2:08:52] shall recover let me read you one more
[2:08:58] Psalms 103 Kassir avaiable revival this
[2:09:02] is one of the characteristics prayer for
[2:09:03] the sick is a part of revival hallelujah
[2:09:07] Psalms 103 verse 1 bless the Lord O my
[2:09:13] soul
[2:09:15] and all that is within me bless His Holy
[2:09:20] Name
[2:09:22] I could see David just pause why he's
[2:09:26] thinking about it when he's writing this
[2:09:27] down then say bless the Lord O my soul
[2:09:30] and forget not all his benefits so when
[2:09:38] you a full-time worker you get benefits
[2:09:41] you serving God on a full-time basis
[2:09:44] there's some benefits that go with that
[2:09:46] right part-time people don't get
[2:09:49] benefits
[2:09:50] [Music]
[2:09:54] you can go to the HR office all you want
[2:09:58] to
[2:09:59] there is no card for you
[2:10:02] no override you got to pay for that out
[2:10:06] of your pocket but if you want to go
[2:10:08] full-time so bless the Lord O my soul
[2:10:16] and forget not all his benefits who
[2:10:21] forgiveth all thine iniquity I don't
[2:10:24] care what you've done God say he forgive
[2:10:27] it all oh I feel good I feel feel like a
[2:10:32] man tree preaching brother brother
[2:10:34] Nathan do you have a a broke I mean a
[2:10:38] bruised vessel do you have a metal
[2:10:42] vessel that that maybe a little damaged
[2:10:46] do you have a vet so that needs some
[2:10:49] tending to do what kind of vessel to
[2:10:52] your hat because he said he saying say
[2:10:54] it don't matter whether it's bruised so
[2:10:56] whether it's a little damaged long it is
[2:10:59] not broken and it's not seeping out it's
[2:11:01] made a question is is the vessel empty
[2:11:04] because it is empty bring it God will
[2:11:06] fulfill it again
[2:11:08] hallelujah God can you show empty vessel
[2:11:14] who forgiveth all thine iniquities and I

[2:11:33] life from destruction who crowns you
[2:11:35] with loving-kindness and tender mercies

[2:19:08] all right this I got to read this don't
[2:19:11] close right here
[2:19:12] this is out of the message inside man
[2:19:15] the inside man so you would like to know
[2:19:19] what I think the greatest need of the
[2:19:21] church today what I think is lacking is
[2:19:24] no soul travail the people are not broke
[2:19:30] up enough there's no bird and seemingly
[2:19:34] and you give me someone that just so
[2:19:37] tore up about lost souls that they can
[2:19:40] think they just cry and our warmth and
[2:19:42] revive us so bad so they can hardly eat
[2:19:44] just simply can't
[2:19:46] I've seen people coming here get toe up
[2:19:48] over these the sins of a loved ones
[2:19:50] just messed up God please deliver we had
[2:19:54] that that corporate prayer here in my
[2:19:57] what an experience in this place right
[2:20:00] and just just even I know for the
[2:20:01] brothers one of the things that's been
[2:20:02] on our prayer list is we're praying for
[2:20:04] two to two people backsliders and we're
[2:20:08] also praying for those that have walked
[2:20:09] away from this word we won't let that go
[2:20:11] every time we come here God don't hear
[2:20:13] that coming out of our mouth God sent
[2:20:15] him God bring him you know what if I was
[2:20:19] in their shoes if the roles was reversed
[2:20:20] I want somebody praying for me God the
[2:20:27] devil is a liar my brother my sister
[2:20:30] father please God and we keep that thing
[2:20:34] before God weekend and week out we keep
[2:20:37] it before God said we're not he gonna
[2:20:40] answer we seek we gonna find a man
[2:20:44] listen
[2:20:45] he says if you read the history of the
[2:20:49] world and the religious history you'll
[2:20:51] find out it always taking that kind of a
[2:20:54] spirit to bring a revival the interval
[2:20:56] of soul spirit to bring a revival that's
[2:20:58] right when Zion prevail or traveled I
[2:21:02] think a better word see when Zion
[2:21:05] travailed or Zion travel so when you're
[2:21:09] in prayer you need to travel your prayer
[2:21:14] should elevate you your prayer I mean
[2:21:17] see once you get a real you catch the
[2:21:19] burden for your brother and sister even
[2:21:21] I don't have the quote but I remember
[2:21:22] the brand I'm saying even if somebody's
[2:21:24] done you wrong and as you begin to pray
[2:21:26] for that person he said when you get
[2:21:28] them to the prison guard you can't even
[2:21:30] think about the wrong that they did you
[2:21:32] start feeling sorry for the person
[2:21:34] that's when you begin to travel when you
[2:21:38] begin to travail in prayer when Zion
[2:21:43] travailed
[2:21:43] or travel I think it's a better word
[2:21:45] then she brought forth children see you
[2:21:48] have to be tore up it's the atmosphere
[2:21:51] of anything you get around where there's
[2:21:55] arguments come on church listen you get
[2:21:58] into that type of atmosphere
[2:22:00] if there
[2:22:00] if there's something in the church
[2:22:02] someone who's disobedient and very ugly
[2:22:05] acting in the church and causing trouble
[2:22:08] you'll never be able to have a revival
[2:22:10] as long as that kind of an atmosphere is
[2:22:12] around that's why you gotta watch
[2:22:16] yourself you don't have to respond to
[2:22:19] everything a man Church sometimes it let
[2:22:22] it pass right a man because you know
[2:22:25] it's gonna create the wrong atmosphere
[2:22:27] listen he said you say that kind of
[2:22:31] atmosphere around and so you have to
[2:22:33] have everybody and if you'll notice when
[2:22:35] the Holy Spirit came on Pentecost they
[2:22:36] were all in one place and in one Accord
[2:22:39] is that right and waiting for a promise
[2:22:41] and when we get like that brother Bose
[2:22:43] the revival will be here then that's
[2:22:46] right we got to be in one mile and one
[2:22:48] Accord in the same place we'll see God
[2:22:51] do great things I want to read this last
[2:22:53] quote out of questions and answers part
[2:22:56] one don't have the wrong attitude don't
[2:22:59] have the wrong spirit travail of soul as
[2:23:04] we think about different I mean the
[2:23:06] reason that we're still here is because
[2:23:07] somebody somebody is not breaking out
[2:23:10] who you are in Christ and once they come
[2:23:13] to a knowledge of that you know my god
[2:23:17] it won't be long Church you know one of
[2:23:20] the other things I think revival see we
[2:23:22] might get lost you know some lost souls
[2:23:23] we might get some people restore it with
[2:23:25] me and you might even see some you know
[2:23:27] just new people just kind I think
[2:23:28] anytime you see new faces in a
[2:23:30] congregation it revives the congregation
[2:23:32] that's another characteristic right you
[2:23:35] get new faces people drawn to your
[2:23:37] church praise the Lord come on I have to
[2:23:41] be honest with myself I've been in
[2:23:44] church some time and I actually I didn't
[2:23:47] want to invite people I actually didn't
[2:23:50] want to invite them to my church because
[2:23:53] I didn't know what would be said
[2:23:56] don't know what the whole I don't know
[2:23:59] what they gonna do
[2:24:00] can I be honest I'm afraid to invite
[2:24:04] folk to church see as we mature you know
[2:24:08] you get to the point they oh wait a
[2:24:09] minute right all right all right we work
[2:24:11] with things we work with people right
[2:24:12] where they are learn to work with people
[2:24:18] right where they are and i'ma tell you
[2:24:20] right now if they come from the world
[2:24:22] they gonna be messed up because they
[2:24:25] have not been influenced by the word but
[2:24:30] when you get here you get underneath the
[2:24:31] influence of the word then things begin
[2:24:33] to change
[2:24:34] praise God questions and answers part
[2:24:38] one the Prophet says this he says now
[2:24:40] look if this church if I say this
[2:24:44] morning in this little group of people
[2:24:46] it says if God was saying if God would
[2:24:49] be speaking to the Prophet God would say
[2:24:51] now look William Branham I'm gonna make
[2:24:53] you answer for that group of people
[2:24:55] what'd you tell them now do you want
[2:24:58] them all to shower sure I want them to
[2:25:02] shout do you want them all to speak with
[2:25:05] tongues I want every one of them to look
[2:25:10] what the prophets say I want everyone in
[2:25:11] them to do you want them all to dance in
[2:25:15] the spirit like we was dancing on that
[2:25:19] Sunday night I want every one of them to
[2:25:22] alright well that's very good but what
[2:25:26] could what would you rather have them do
[2:25:28] huh huh I'd rather have a church that
[2:25:32] had such a burden on their heart for
[2:25:36] prayer that they just stayed at this
[2:25:39] altar and with be here day and night and
[2:25:42] everything else and in their house was
[2:25:46] constantly in prayer and humble and
[2:25:50] trying to get people to come to God and
[2:25:52] making calls at the hospital and
[2:25:54] visiting the sick and trying to get
[2:25:56] people to come to church do and do right
[2:25:59] I'd rather have that than all the other
[2:26:01] put together although the other is right
[2:26:06] it belongs in the church
[2:26:08] but if I if I had to have it I put that
[2:26:11] first because if you got that the other
[2:26:14] will take place we got travail a soul do
[2:26:20] you know you you you'll start shouting
[2:26:21] when you see your friend get free you
[2:26:27] get so kind of wrapped up you start
[2:26:29] wanting to speak in tongues you just let
[2:26:31] it you have this release of the let it
[2:26:33] go when you see God do something
[2:26:37] somebody else it excites you remember
[2:26:40] heaven rejoices just when one sinner
[2:26:42] repents what you think of happening if
[2:26:45] you see your brother sister restored
[2:26:48] when you see your prayer answers that
[2:26:50] right before your very eyes you think
[2:26:53] that will make you wanna shout sohow
[2:26:58] travail a soul more than anything else
[2:27:01] hallelujah and you know we we know you
[2:27:04] sometimes you know now that there's some
[2:27:06] serious Pierce if you're dealing with so
[2:27:08] sometimes you know you might talk to a
[2:27:09] person they just don't want to hear just
[2:27:11] nothing you can do as far as talking but
[2:27:13] you can keep praying don't stop praying
[2:27:17] God can change anybody's heart and I'm
[2:27:21] expecting him to do that revival occurs
[2:27:25] these are some of the attributes or
[2:27:27] characteristics of it so I I'm looking
[2:27:28] for it all right he says he goes on to
[2:27:31] say if you got that if you just get so
[2:27:35] hungry for God shout and will take place
[2:27:38] if you got so hungry for God speaking in
[2:27:41] tongues will take place you got so
[2:27:43] hunger for God just keep on hungry and
[2:27:45] keep yourself now you go you go to
[2:27:47] seeing yourself getting indifferent just
[2:27:49] remember look out there's another spirit
[2:27:51] trying to work itself in there stay
[2:27:54] right before God humbled with travail of
[2:27:55] soul just be all that good old-fashioned
[2:27:59] he goes on and says I can prove by the
[2:28:02] Bible that the first time the end of God
[2:28:05] went over the lands the seal with the
[2:28:07] Holy Ghost
[2:28:08] he only sealed those who cry inside for
[2:28:11] the abominations done in the city
[2:28:12] Ezekiel of knife chapter is that right
[2:28:14] set a seal upon the forehead of those
[2:28:17] who sigh and cry for the abominations
[2:28:18] that done the city now if you go back
[2:28:21] and read is if you're not
[2:28:22] it was destruction getting ready to
[2:28:24] settle amen upon the city there and
[2:28:27] before destruction the angel was what
[2:28:31] was commissioned go seal those that are
[2:28:33] praying seal those in a silent crying
[2:28:35] and I mentioned last last week when we
[2:28:37] read out of Revelation 8 before
[2:28:39] destruction God was gonna pour out fire
[2:28:41] a man into his congregation just like he
[2:28:45] gave fire to Isiah he wants to give fire
[2:28:48] to his people and what aspire to do it
[2:28:51] cleanses all the sin out of my life
[2:28:54] listen she said it's still upon the
[2:28:58] forehead of those who sign cry for the
[2:28:59] abominations of our nation that's done
[2:29:01] the city now I want to ask you a
[2:29:02] question I ask you this question now
[2:29:05] we'll close just as quick as I can what
[2:29:08] would take place today if the Holy Ghost
[2:29:09] went through Jefferson Building of New
[2:29:11] Albany I want to say West Palm Beach
[2:29:13] Jeffersonville new Avenue Louisville
[2:29:15] West Palm Beach to seal those this
[2:29:17] afternoon who would be at home God sent
[2:29:23] a revival just so hungry for a meeting
[2:29:26] Oh God look at the sins of this city oh
[2:29:30] isn't it terrible God oh won't you
[2:29:33] please send a revival God send some good
[2:29:35] preachers send someone Oh Lord let the
[2:29:39] Holy Ghost where would he seal think of
[2:29:42] that and I believe a man that certainly
[2:29:48] we have started with some of the prayer
[2:29:49] meetings we're doing you know we're
[2:29:51] doing some great things but we all know
[2:29:53] we can do better in some other areas
[2:29:55] Amen we can keep praying keep their
[2:29:57] prayer well turning
[2:29:58] don't let that don't let up on don't let
[2:30:00] up on it and and and I believe prayers
[2:30:03] was actually produced some of the
[2:30:04] results that we're seeing now and I
[2:30:06] believe prayers what's gonna take us on
[2:30:07] I rather be caught prayin didn't doing
[2:30:10] anything else I rather if the Lord was
[2:30:13] gonna return let him catch me in a
[2:30:15] prayer meeting let him catch me in a
[2:30:18] premie don't catch me on the basketball
[2:30:20] court
[2:30:20] no it's catch me in a prayer me did you
[2:30:23] see me break his ankle
[2:30:26] nothing to do with Jesus hallelujah Lord
[2:30:29] catch me in a prayer me catch me right
[2:30:32] here doing what I need to do having sold
[2:30:34] travail
[2:30:35] seeing soles worn to the Lord this is a
[2:30:40] characteristic a revival remember five
[2:30:44] characteristics I only got through two
[2:30:45] of them today one was winning souls of
[2:30:47] Christ to church restored to its right
[2:30:50] condition I'm coming to that next week
[2:30:52] close communion with God I'll do that
[2:30:55] next week but next time I preach next
[2:30:58] week we're gonna have we're gonna have
[2:30:59] brother Quaker speech a man but when I
[2:31:02] come back to preach again I'll pick this
[2:31:04] up
[2:31:05] another's fellowship amongst sister
[2:31:07] churches and pray for the sick these are
[2:31:12] characteristics that we should see when
[2:31:15] there's a revival let's pray
[2:31:18] musicians if you would come father God
[2:31:24] we thank you for this word that you have
[2:31:27] given us your prophet that you sent to
[2:31:29] us true revival will only come when the
[2:31:33] people have gotten back to the word and
[2:31:35] the only people that can come back to
[2:31:36] the word are your people this is why you
[2:31:41] could right there in Scripture if my
[2:31:43] people which are called by my name will
[2:31:47] humble themselves and pray seek my face
[2:31:51] turn from their wicked ways said you
[2:31:54] were here from heaven you said you would
[2:31:57] heal the land father my prayer is that
[2:32:02] his revival fires continue to burn in
[2:32:05] his church that we would see all the
[2:32:08] characteristics that you have shown us
[2:32:10] through your prophet that they will all
[2:32:11] be manifested here we're already seeing
[2:32:14] it Lord but may they continue to
[2:32:16] manifest help us to come into one mind
[2:32:18] it's a one accord that your spirit would
[2:32:21] have the preeminence in this place every
[2:32:24] gift that you have called for the body
[2:32:26] would be released into the people all
[2:32:28] according to order of the scripture
[2:32:31] father we believe in that we're
[2:32:33] believing captives would be set free we
[2:32:36] believe in the bound will be delivered
[2:32:38] we believe in the sick will be healed
