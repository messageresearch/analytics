layton way up in um indiana she put a little story up on facebook this morning it was telling how a lamb got bit by a rattlesnake right in the face she said that the snake's fake not the snake but the lamb's face and swollen up for two days and nothing was wrong with it she said well it was an unknown writer but the writer said that the anti-venom for a snake is in the lamb's blood so that lamb was sitting there with his face swollen for two days so that took me all the way back to calvary it went even back to the garden of eden when that serpent did what he did god had to come down and take a lamb's blood to be a substitute but then after that he had to bring the real lamb on the earth to abolish what the serpent had did amen and said after two days the land was fine he went on about his

here and all things are possible is here let's sing it this way lord i believe oh lord i believe i believe all things are possible lord [Music] i believe all things are possible lord i believe as they continue to play that's awfully just our hearts heavenly father we counted a privilege father we appreciate the opportunity that you've afforded unto us that we could be here this morning we're under great expectation the lord that you would just come and minister to our hearts father i'm reminded of what the prophet said that any man within the ability of his own could flip back the pages of the bible and read from the scriptures but it takes the lamb of god the god to come on the scene and break bread with us for us to receive the revealed word of truth father may you come and speak to our hearts this morning whatever we have need of the god we we committed into your hands father we ask that you just take full control of the service those that are in need those that are sick those that are down those that are a disheartened lord father there's nothing too big or too small that you can't cater to we commit all things into your hands have preeminence in the service the lord any spirit that's contrary to your spirit may be dismissed from this place give your people liberty to worship you and spirit in the truth because the bible says he who the son has set free is free indeed and father we believe that we are free people we're no longer bound to the bondage of sin bound to the bondage of fear but father you have broken those chains and you've set us free thank you for the grace that you've shown unto us we commit all things into your hands and this little bride says amen amen god bless you saints certainly get to be back in the house of the lord if you wouldn't mind grab your bibles your ipads your phones whatever you use we have different ways of using our swords nowadays turn with me to ephesians chapter 2. certainly appreciate always appreciate the opportunity to be here a special treat with my family being able to visit last time i talked about them this time they're actually here with me so amen so just really appreciate them being with us and you know trying to adjust to fatherhood because um you know trying to calculate the time i need to be here what time they got to get up and feeding them and you know things just don't work out the way you kind of envision it you know you you know you're chasing after a shoe you put one in the car the other one takes off running and it's just but by god's grace we're here amen so just appreciate brother jack just uh opening up his door and just uh giving us the privilege to be here this morning amen so bear with me i got a thought this morning that i'd like to minister on and um and uh so i feel that we may be all over the place but just kind of bear with my thoughts so bear with my thoughts i i know where i want to go so just kind of bear with me i got a couple of scriptures laying here and there so um so um so just kind of bear with me so we'll have an opening scripture and i'll let you have your seat so ephesians chapter 2 starting at verse 1 and it reads and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein time passed ye walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we paul including himself all had our conversation in times past and the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and were by nature the children of wrath even as others and i love the scripture but god who is rich in mercy for his great love worth he loved us that's an outstanding scripture even now listen to this even when we were dead and sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace are ye saved and last verse and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus may the lord have this blessing to the reading of the word you may be seated my just trying to find a a place to start with this but my thought this morning is elevation that god called you to an elevated place and i'm going to walk you through certain god bless you brother keith i'm going to walk you through certain um parts of the scriptures where god's efforts for his people was to elevate them rise them up above a place that they shouldn't be or think they ought to be and i use this scripture because it's one of the scriptures that i've i draw myself to because it's just it's so meaningful because we could relate to it in so many ways because paul begins to kind of outline the scripture if you will and you have the quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins that was our way many years ago in some cases that might be our way now so it's not too late we still got grace wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world this world is on a course and it's on a collision course and so it's going on a journey and we we followed the herd where wherever our boys went we went with them wherever our the girls went we went with them so we followed the world but paul was cautious in saying that was in time past so for the believers who could believe that and knows that that's true we all could say amen i heard a few so we're going to work on the others amen because that was my past that's not my present satan could tell you all about my past and i could tell saying about his future and he doesn't like that so we walked a certain way we talked a certain way we dressed a certain way we conducted ourselves a certain way but all that was in the past where in time past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the prince of the power of the air so there was an anointing in the atmosphere that we got caught up in the atmosphere we got caught up in the environment we got caught up with what was happening when we were in the world we went out clubbing we got caught up in the atmosphere of the club when we were at the ball games we got caught up in the atmosphere of the ball games that's just how it was because there was an anointing behind everything there's an anointing be careful things without everything that's what we ought to be careful and discern the spirit to know which is of god and which is not of god because the bible says wall to them that call evil good and good evil this is talking about this thing people are so confused they don't know what good is and they don't know what evil is but by god's grace i could look god in the word and i know the difference between good and evil it's so deceptive it's so it's it's a gray area that we're living in but unless you look at things to the filter of god's words you could easily see what's going on so the bible goes on to say the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience amongst whom also we paul included himself because he realized that even as the first church age messenger he needed a savior paul was not born a christian he was he was not born saying thus said the lord he was not born saying hallelujah he was not born teaching grace he had to learn these things so we had our conversations again he reminds you in the times past the lust of the flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind if we thought about it it felt good we did it we didn't care about the consequences we didn't care about who who we offended we didn't care about what we said how we said it what we did how we did it we just did it that was our lives back then that was who we are and we're by nature the children of wrath we were born with a certain nature now here's my point we were born with a certain fallen nature we don't have to teach you no one ever taught you how to lie you just knew how to cover your tracks like i gotta cover myself this is wrong right here no one taught you that you just learned you just you just learned how to do that because you know the consequences so we came with the we were born with the fallen nature and so even as we were born with the fallen nature and bear with me as i kind of build on this even as we were born with the fallen nature ours we would just our lives felt like it was shattered in a million pieces we had no sense of direction no purpose we were just going with the wind because it felt good we did it we went in that direction we just flowed as it as civilization flowed we just flow we went the course of the world and all the meanwhile when you were drinking your beer smoking your cigarettes running in the clubs god looked at you said i made the right decision about you when you had nothing to do with god god says you know what he think he's going someplace but i'm about to bring him around and that's the reason why paul understood that because he had letters to risk to arrest the christians but then he realized that god stepped in and intervened he realized the divine intervention of god and therefore he could say god who is rich and mercy not only god who is merciful but god who is rich in mercy because when people look down on you god look beyond that god went to you where others couldn't reach you at and we were dead in sins as he quickened us together with christ and he raised us up together elevated us brought us up and have us sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus now i start by saying this we live in this earth and we're reminded because of where we're at that there's a gravitational pull that brings us down that's the reason why and i'm gonna say things that you already know that when we try to jump up we fall down because there's an unseen force called gravity that keeps bringing us down and and it's it's not in man to be grounded it's not we're never satisfied now follow what i'm saying just to be grounded from the dawn of mankind we've always looked up and we we we wondered what was in the heavens and there was there was a hunger within us that we want it to be elevated a little bit higher and as a result of this men try different ways to tap into how can they elevate themselves both naturally emotionally physically so y'all bear with me but it is his intent because every time he tries to go up something pushes him down and it's it's a it's a gravitational force that keeps man grounded to the earth and so much that in our failures that our head is hung down low because because we we because something doesn't want you to look up it's a lot easier to just walk with your head down to look at your problems to look at your failures and can't see your success can't see your promise and so we walk around with this attitude but every once in a while someone and we've seen this in history comes along and says i want to go beyond just looking at these failures that i see and so we see that man crafted some means and they invented an airplane they put together the instruments and perhaps the first flight was probably nothing barely off the ground but man what an achievement it was that man is not beginning to take a step further and so he realizes that man i could go a little bit beyond just being grounded to my circumstance so over time man has refined and updated the airplane to which now we don't think much about it and we fly 30 000 35 000 feet up in the air it's nothing to us but there is still yet that gravitational pull that reminds me that even though you could fly for a number of hours you're gonna have to bring that object down called the airplane but yeah there's a there's an unyielding desire within man to say you know what i need to break beyond just the earthly atmosphere there's something greater in the skies about that things let me pause there for a moment if that is man's motivation how much more should your motivation be martin luther would not stand for what the catholics had to preach he said there's something much greater than you hiding the bible from me so he had to take a flight he had to go higher than what the what was being preached back then he had to be elevated a little bit higher so the man comes along and he builds a space shuttle he says we need to go beyond the atmosphere where the gravitational pull is less intense and we realize that through many of the efforts to try to go to the moon or go into outer space there were a lot of failures along the way not everything you do is straight success there are some there are some minor setbacks that's also in the bible we'll talk about that but man was relentless that was the spirit within men and he built this space shuttle but he had to study the atmosphere and all these different things and ultimately man refused to be grounded he says we appreciate what we've done through aviation but now we need to venture into the space age and so man build a space shuttle and they broke through the earth's atmosphere in the orbit around earth and man what what what a what an astonishing achievement think about it having gone from i can't tell you my my grandmother my great-grandmother could never realize that we would have been in space and here we are yeah that gravitational pull is still strong enough that reminds man you could only be in space but for so long you need to come back oh wesley took us a little bit higher beyond luther and said we need to be sanctified we need to go beyond justification we need to be sanctified so it took us a little bit higher and pentecost sweeped up and took us a little bit higher today man has not ventured and says you know what we need to go beyond what's within our immediate surrounding let's go see what's out there in mars and even not recently they're trying to you know they're trying to have uh where you know um i forget his name escaped me but they taking uh people to around the earth and uh space flight and they're trying to commercialize it it's just it's just it's just the times that we're living in it's it's the moment it had to have been this moment because there's there as much as there's a desire with men to go higher there's a desire with me to step a little bit higher but we realize the reason why it's important for us to be elevated is because our views of things are completely different our views of things the way we see things are completely different when you're grounded all you see is what's immediately in front of you and your judgment your criticism your observation is only around your immediate surroundings but the moment that you're elevated just a little bit higher you see things that others don't see so therefore you react differently we to use an example before we have the instruments that we have now that's able to tell that there's an oncoming storm we wouldn't have known how to prepare for a storm we would have went back we would have went around our daily business like it was nobody else's business we would have felt something in the air but we would have no idea that there was a storm coming we would have just lived our daily lives but the moment that we're not able to tap and see in the distance that there's a storm coming we begin to react differently even though it's calm even though the sun is shining even though there's not a cloud in the sky i'm living in a different dimension i see the storm coming you might criticize me but my family and i we are getting ready i see things that the world doesn't see you see things that the world has no idea they might laugh at you they might criticize you they might talk about you but it doesn't matter i see the oncoming storm the world is trying to conform that is not what my message is my message is to be transformed that's what the bible tells me but the sun is shining the sky is blue and meanwhile there's a storm that's brewing out there but we're elevated we have a message of certainty and we know that the storm is coming it's much more than the feeling that we have but we can see it for ourselves so being elevated gives you an understanding that others don't have it gives you depth that others don't have it gives you knowledge that others don't have it gives you insight that others don't have that's the reason why the bible says you're seated in heavenly places in christ jesus you know the bible talks about how there are levels when god he stepped out of heaven he stepped into earth and he entered manifested himself in a body we call jesus and then not only did he walk around earth but he went to the grave because something was pulling him down so he went down to the grave and because he bore your sins and my sins he went to hell think about that god came from heaven to earth to the grave to hell hell was our destination and on his way up he was reversing the whole process again so that way we wouldn't have to go to hell we would have to go to a place called the fire of lake and brimstone so he rose up he went out of hell he conquered the grave he visited earth and went right back to heaven and so much that jesus says i go and prepare a place for you so we realize it's not our intent to be grounded but god has called us for some place a little bit higher there's no place in the scripture where that's true where the bible talks about the prodigal son and you know the story very well and i'll kind of kind of go through it real quickly so the bible talks about that this man had two sons and the younger of them says father look give me my portion i'm out of here and he divided on unto them his living and not many days because of some men think about he's like you know what not many days he gathered all his stuff and he went to a journey into a far country and there are ways to do substance with righteous living so think about this picture he left his status he left his position he was in a good place he had access to all the promises he had access to everything that god could afford him but yet he was interested in what the world had to offer so he gathered this he gathered all his stuff and when he had spent all after he spent all the bible says there arose a mighty famine in the land there was no famine in the land why he had money in his pocket because as long as he had money in his pocket then there's probably no need for god so therefore he could just hand it out i'm good i got my cars i got my house i got my job i got my bonus i'm good god knows how to change that i don't know what my father was thinking i'm good i got all the money that i needed i got my portion and notice the father never even stopped him so after he spent it all every bit of it there arose a mighty famine not even just a famine a mighty famine out there and so he probably got laid off from his job the bonus weren't coming in he couldn't pay his electric he couldn't pay the mortgage the car was going to get repolled times were tough let me tell you if someone was once in the favor of god and they leave god and they're going through trouble i'm gonna be delicate and i'll say this i am not trying to find pity on that person because if god's dealing with them let god deal with them [Applause] because the bible says i lose not one that the father has given me if you think you could just leave and walk out be careful of your decision because if you're part of god you won't go too far before you come back it might be with the broken leg it might be with the broken arm it might be with one eye it might be with the prime broken but god's gonna take whatever he needs to bring you right back so he was down under he was down to the lowest that he could get there was a mighty famine and he began to be in want when you want something you lack it the lord is my shepherd i shall not want i've always got confused with them like why wouldn't i ever want the lord to be my shepherd boy i misunderstood that it was the lord is my shepherd i should not lack i'm like well that makes more sense as long as he's my shepherd i'm never going to win anything because he's going to give me everything he's my portion and there was a mighty famine that he began to want let me tell you when a man is in a desperate state sometimes you make irrational decisions hasty decisions incorrect decisions unscriptural decision lack of prayer decisions praise the lord when you're in a desperate state because you're looking at your families in your eyes and you know you've made the wrong decision but you're too important to god for him to lose you he's invested too much in you you might be bad out there saying i'm going to go out there and just do what i want to do all right you never want to test god you can hold a man back but you can't hold god back and the bible says then he went and he joined himself to a citizen of that country just join any fellowship just join in like it's like i'll do anything and they send them to the fields to feed the swine this is royal blood that's mingling with pigs imagine me raising the palace and thinking that you know it all and next thing you know you find yourself feeding right next to the pigs he was desperate for a job he's like look man just give me a job i just need something i just i i'll do anything i got to take care of my family i lost my house i lost my car i lost my job i need anything he's like why i got some pigs over there they need some feeding wouldn't have pigs ever need to be fair all you gotta do is just is that we got some pigs over there because of his desperation he compromised he's like i'll do it he's like yeah i don't have that much to pay because you know the famine in the land and things are kind of scarce i'm paying 10 cents a week he had to swallow his pride be humble because god knows how to break you down so he didn't even put up a fight and he went and drove himself to assist and he sent him to into the fields to feed swine and he would feign have filled his belly with the husk that the swine did eat because no man gave unto him he's sitting there eating with swines he know better than to look at the pigs himself and thought about pork chops because that's that's what would have came all mine but that even the pigs didn't belong to him it belonged to the guy so he had to eat the husks and different things can you just imagine just eating all this filth the dirtiness sometimes god has to bring you to your lowest point when you're just truly grounded but that is not the place you deserve that is not what god envisioned for you that is not his purpose for you satan was rejoicing when he saw that this young man was in the walla was in the was in the muck was in all these type of filth he rejoiced with that because that's what he expected to see and i love this part of the scripture when he's at the lowest point of his life when you can't go any lower when you're right there in the midst of the pigs and the swines and you're eating uh all these things the bible says he came to himself he came to himself he was broken shattered torn up his pride was broken his attitude was broken his ways was broken god humbled him and there he was down in the muck in the wallow in the in the in the in the filth dirty horrible if a man was to walk by him they probably wouldn't even recognize who he was that was my life that was your life at one time we probably did i wouldn't have even recognized who you were in the world because you're so blended in with the people of the world and the things of the world the language of the world the conduct of the world your behaviors the way you acted i wouldn't have recognized who you are but thank god i'm not concerned about who you are i'm only appreciate who you are now he came to himself not because of what he realized but everything that his dad instilled within him never departed from him every lesson that he learned from his dad never departed from him that even in his worst estate he was eating he probably was one by the way saying man this is delicious i could i could cope with this and then he thought by he's like wait a minute just just at a moment just just had that that realizations like what in the world is going on here i can only just imagine that she's standing and he's flicking all these pigs around it's like what am i doing here does this guy know who my dad is do i even know who my dad is he had a revelation he's like why am i what am i doing here he never kicked me out i left big difference he never kicked me out and now here's oink oink oink this is my my my dad has a palace there's rooms in there my brother's over there there's food over there why am i eating this and one pig probably looked at him like i would have eaten you you would have been on my table he came to himself let me tell you when a when a believer could realize who they are if you could just if you could just for a moment the fear that overcomes when you get up in the morning and you realize that i'm a child of god i'm a son of a king all devils in hell begin to tremble that was the first step of being elevated there he was he stood up you got to rise up and look at the situation around you say what am i doing in this situation i don't belong here heaven i'm just this earth is not my home i'm just a passing through i don't belong here i'm just a pilgrim i'm just a passing through this is not my home that was the first realization that was the first step of rising above his circumstance he looked he's like i don't immediately the bible says he comes to himself and he begins to reflect how many hired servants of my fathers have bread enough and spare and i perish with hunger and in verse 18 he says our eyes elevated and go to my father's house you know what's so important about that one scripture the bible says in here rose and came to his father's house and the bible says but yet when he was a great way like he was in the distance he's made his decision to go back to the father's house the father was right there waiting anticipating that at any moment his son would come right back to him [Applause] just watching from a great distance the moment you've made up your mind when i made up my mind i say you know what i'm no i'm tired of this world i'm tired of the things of this world god has already turned his sight directly to me and he was marching in my direction just as much as i was marching in his direction and two forces collided and god picked me up what an elevation for you and i we were meant to be grounded but god has got us to elevate ten minutes there's a another person in the scripture you find joseph y'all know the story well he was loved of his father hated of his brethren and so his brethren decide to conspire and they made it seem they sold them to slavery and they went back to the father with the coats of many colors and they said wild beasts must have killed joseph look at this it's drenched in blood oh his father was so distraught and joseph was sold and he was in the house of potiphar think about it he left from his father's house he went out to the fields to meet his brethren his brethren betrayed him and then he was sold into slavery talking about falling from a place of a place of comfort where everything was where he was comfortable with his surroundings his parents his his his brethren and his his whole at his own environment and all that just stripped away from him and now he's in this unknown place this unknown land and he tumbled and there he was in pontiff's house a prisoner in pontiff's house but everything that joseph touched was blessed you know what my prayer is every morning now before i go to work before i i well i said i go to work but i work from home now with everything changing but before i get going to work i said lord i don't want to just survive the week lord i want to thrive through the week [Music] my prayer needs to change lord i just don't want to survive the week i want more than that i want to thrive through the week i want the best week that you can give me i want the best blessings that you could give me because if you say lord help me get through the week he'll help you just get through the week because that's what you pray for and i realize that and i said man i got through the week but then when i started praying lord help me thrive through the week let me tell you things my fridays couldn't look any better because i thrive through the week no matter what challenges i face no matter who confronted me god stood with me things that i didn't expect to come in my favor god blessed me beyond measure because i prayed lord i just don't want to survive the week i want to thrive i want to prosper i want to i want i want the blessings of god that should be your prayer everything that joseph touched was blessed i say lord let it be whatever i touch it's blessed if my keyboard touches my hand touches the keyboard it's blessed if i'm on a conference call people are blessed if i'm talking to somebody they're blessed wherever i gotta go that place is blessed is that just my prayer that should be your prayer you're an anointed of god don't limit your prayers god is capable of anything whatever hand whatever whatever joseph touched his hands blessed it and people saw that people saw that ponce first saw that he was a prisoner in prince of his house and possibly like man this man blessed you could be in your job and people looking down at you but they know deep inside you're blessed they may not tell you but their spirit is witness with your spirit that you're a child of god and i want to apologize for that i'm a child of god amen we're living in a dark world saints if there's gonna be a light i might as well let my little light shine it might be blinding to others that's okay but for some it might be a way of truth because the only gospel they'll know is the lie is the life that you live before them and so possibly went up to joseph said joseph let's look man i'm making more than just a prison i'm going to give you oversight to my house my estate my household my life my life stock all these different things he was elevated man who would have thought joseph was elevated he had oversight and the bible says that pontiff's wife cast his eye upon joseph the devil's always looking to see were you being blessed looking to use a vessel to bring your blessings down that's the reason why if you get a little promotion don't go walking around i got that promotion because someone just watched you got that promotion you got this unexpected bonus i got that bonus someone saw you get that bonus [Music] and they're watching to wait for an opportunity to bring you down not everybody's always happy because you're blessed but don't let them take that smile away from you now not everybody's always in agreement with you because you say hallelujah not everybody agrees with you when you say praise the lord but don't stop me from praising the lord because you may not be blessed but i know i am blessed but i'm gonna be humble about it because i know who my god is i know who my father is i know where i came from i know where i'm going i know if he blessed me today he'll bless me tomorrow if he bless me this week he'll bless me next week if he bless me this month he'll bless me next month if he bless me this year he bless me next year i believe in my god i believe in the blessings that he bestows upon his households and so joseph was elevated he got blessed and now he didn't have to be treated like one of those prisoners and so pontifir said look you have oversight but someone was watching him and was waiting for an opportunity to question his character people are watching you be careful when you testify because that moment that you slip up that same people come running to you and they're almost no more scripture than you do didn't you say the bible says according to ephesian you're like yeah i said that that's it there i sit there i i apologize huh god knows how to humble you they're always watching you you don't think they'll pain that they'll you think don't be paying attention you don't think every time you talk they're watching or they're right there watching your movement your actions your attitude and the moment you slip up they come running they're the first one they're watching your character and sometimes they try to put you in a position because that's what pontiff's wife did try to put joseph in a position and sometimes people try to put you in a position to make you a liar and you know you're not they try to bring you down with words they try to demoralize you bring your spirits down oh but if i could go on the side real quick the bible tells me david was in that situation his friends left him and abandoned him he was in a sorrow state but the bible says that david rejoiced himself in the lord i don't need my pastor to make me happy although i love my pastor i don't need the deacon to call me to make me straight i know how to live a godly life i don't need the song leader sing me happy i don't have much of a voice but i'm gonna give god the praises with the voice that i have because the bible says he inhabits the praises of his people i don't need you to pat my back and pamper me so i can feel like a christian i woke up this morning knowing that i'm a son of god [Applause] i don't need to convince you i'm a son of god i need to let the devil know that i'm a son of god [Applause] amen you're not my ticket to heaven god already made me a promise i love all of you all but my salvation is not dependent upon no men's opinions i respect you all but your opinions don't doesn't matter god does not need to consult you to see if i should make it to heaven he's already made me a promise he's made a promise to my family he's made a promise to my children and i'm holding on to that promise amen [Music] joseph goes running out impossible for his wife's like had the garment in his hands like look you brought this man in to make mockery poor pontiffer when he got word he didn't know what to do is his wife or the other faithful loyal servant he knew one was telling the truth and the other one was lying but he was caught in the middle the bible says all things y'all know that scripture right so when the devil tried to play with your mind say devil the bible didn't say some things because we act like it's some things we say all things but we act like it's something but if we're gonna say all things let's act like it's all things [Music] all things work together even when it's not even if it doesn't seem like it's in your favor all things you may lose your job all things y'all hang with me you don't know how you're gonna pay the bills all things you just went and visited the doctor the doctor said all things substitute what the doctor said is that all things let your praise confuse the enemy let your testimony confuse the devil let him be curious what you what you're excited about all things were together for the good and so he had a setback he was taken into prison he was taken into prison and here he was he was in his father's house brought to prison elevated you're gonna have highs and lows and then brought down again all things work together for the good so there he was in this prison he's like i'm back to square one i lost everything he got to rebuild his credibility got to rebuild his brand got to rebuild his name rebuild his reputation he got a new boss so he got to show his boss what he what he's you know who he is and how he works his work ethic he got to start back again the whole boss is gone now he got a new ball so he gotta you know i gotta prove myself again i gotta start from scratch because i really need that raise i got this house project i got this house project i got this well i gotta do it but joseph no matter where he was whether it was high he was talking about god in his father's house talking to his brothers god said this guy said this i started vision about you i said his brothers didn't like it's like i don't like that kind of preacher they hated him when he was in prison he was still talking about god ponce for he's like let me tell you about my lord he did this he did this he did this he did this and he got elevated when his wife was talking when his wife was talking to him he was like nah my lord would not have me do he was always preaching god's words let me tell you when you're down in your low there's still something to testify about when you cannot eat bread still testify to god you don't have a simple water still testify and when you're sitting up on high and everything's going well and you're healthy your job is good the way you got bonuses everything's going well you still testify to god because as much as he's god of the mountain he's god in the valley i won't take y'all i'm gonna keep you out too long so there he was in the prison and everything that he touched there we go again was blessed you got a gift in your life no matter where you're at that gift is gonna manifest itself god gives you that gift no matter where you are in life god gave you that gift you use it for god's glory and don't you ever be afraid of an unknown situation that you put in god is more than able god is able to work you through that situation joseph did what he knew best he testified of god and he did his job well and he caught the attention of the prison guard just like he caught the attention possible they watched joseph's like man this man every time his hands touch something is he blessed hey joseph i'm gonna elevate you elevated ups and downs elevated i'm gonna put you over all these guards there was two prisoners i was brought in a butler and a baker they were having disturbing dreams they didn't find favor with the with the pharaoh and they were just twisting and turning and they were troubled in their spirits y'all know the story and joseph's like what what's going on tell me your dream the bake the bake the the butler is like well let me tell my dream i dreamt this and i was in a vine and i had i had this happen this happened and then i saw that i was serving um uh wine or to pharaoh and after so many and so joseph given the interpretation he says you know what it is three days you'll be restored back to pharaoh and then you'll serve him why you'll be restored you'll be gone here in three days he's like well praise the lord he was he was happy i mean you in prison then you know what the outcome was gonna be you just offended the highest person in the in the nation at that time and then the interpretation of the dream tells you that you can find favorable pharaoh so um the baker got all excited like hey me me me because he felt like if that was good for him then surely the dream got to be consistent he's like i i dream too so what happened was that i was on the tree and birds were kind of plucking things away and then and then that's it because i have a way of seeing things in the scripture joseph spent some time explaining to the to the butler what happened but it was like less than probably one verse to explain what happened to the butler to the baker he's like in three days you're gonna die trevor's gonna chop your head off and he's gonna hang you on the tree you're gonna die and the birds aren't gonna come and eat your flesh can you just imagine the baker walking away that is tough to digest but that's what the scripture said and so while he watched the baker go back into he looks at the butler he says remember me when you get back to pharaoh remember me and at that moment people get caught up in that moment that emotion it's like i'm never gonna forget you i got your back let every man be alive but god be true because no sooner when the butler got back he was flooded with emotions he didn't want to get the pharaoh upset again so he killed he held his peace and the bible says he forgot about him man will forget you but god god never never forgets you the bible says two years had gone by two years had gone by and all of a sudden pharaoh started to have dreams he couldn't interpret he called for the best uh astrologers the best wise man the best people that he could find to come and interpret the dream and no one no one for two years you figured that joseph was forgotten but god never forgotten joseph two years is just like a blank to god because the bible says a thousand years with men is one day with god and in that duration of two years joseph never once looked down he kept his head up god never forgot him and so here was pharaoh trying to find a way to find peace with this disturbing dream that he's been having and so finally the butler goes up with god knows how to move upon somebody's heart to muster enough courage to speak on your behalf when the moment is right when the opportunity's right let me tell you even when you think god is late he's still on time every time it's like you're watching the snail that's gonna go off the edge right here that smells like if you don't move i'm gonna fall you're just sitting there because you just got plenty of time it's a snail we move at a slow pace compared to how god moves and i can show you that by the scripture but god's always on time when peter was falling in the water the bible says that jesus didn't rush up to go grab him he took his arm and stretch his hand and pick peter up because we don't want a god who panics if god panicked then what would that mean for you and i but he says peace i give unto you so that we can have confidence in the god that we worship that we know that he's in control even though we are out of control so they call so the pharaoh was like so the butler was like pharaoh can i just say a few words he's like when i was in prison remember that time you got me i got you upset that's that's what the bible says remember that time where i got you upset and you almost killed me well i had a dream and i needed someone to interpret that dream and he's trying to say this as humbly as possible because he's talking to pharaoh and fur was considered god of the land so he's watching everything he says so i had a dream like you had a dream it was disturbing to me he had to he had to connect his experience should be able to relate to pharaoh's experience you can't sleep i couldn't sleep because i thought you were going to kill me but your dream is a little bit different your dream's a little bit different but there was a man that i remember who interpreted my dream and here i am serving you now it's unfortunate what happened to the baker because he had a dream too and it came to pass you killed him but i know this man can interpret dreams so pharaoh listened to the matter very intently can you just imagine like this is in front of the whole court and they're watching this it's like this guy's going to die and pharaoh's watching this because he's god of the land and to me that who is he's just a butler he's not like the second coming he's he's a butler but to be able to be able to speak how god is coordinating all things all things work together joseph had no idea that that conversation was happening joseph had no idea that this was taking place he was being about god's business he was still in prayer god you see me in this prison hole you could bring me out and all meanwhile they're having a conversation about joseph god is working on your behalf even though you may not see it you remain faithful [Applause] and pharaoh looked up i could imagine phil was sitting up and then he just stood up the butler kind of looked back like probably probably i shouldn't have said nothing so i was like bring me this guy now imagine this he just put his neck out on the line for this guy because of his testimony because of how he treated him because of his experience with him his whole reputation was on the line but he was willing to stake that reputation because of how god treated him through joseph how you treat others is so important you never know when it's gonna come right back to you that you don't have to be here but someone could talk about your character oh no she's not like that i know her well enough oh no he's not like that he's a man of god he would never say something like that oh no he would never do that why because god because they know your character they know the way you carry yourself sometimes you don't need to defend yourself people will speak on your behalf there's nothing more reassuring when you don't have to defend yourself because you live a life you present yourself in such a way that people's like i know their character the bible says not make this quick they got joseph they shaved them they cleaned them up jesus joseph i like what y'all doing just like well you're gonna you getting ready to go see the the king pharaoh wants to see you what does he want to see me for joseph you know what i like about joseph whether it was sponsored he didn't care whether in the hands of the media he didn't care whether in front of pharaoh he doesn't care who you put him in front of his god was bigger than anybody i have a 210 i have a 200 210 pound rot roller and my little daughter just stays in front of and she's happy because she's telling the rottweiler what to do and b and daddy's sitting right behind her that rock roller see daddy she's yet on the right roll is this big she's j tall that right right let's see daddy that rhyme roller does not see her cause that rhyrolla know that you can't touch this little girl you understand where i'm coming from the devil may not see you he may not think you're nobody but he knows that somebody stands behind you he knows who your daddy is he knows who stands with you that's the reason why i don't walk with fear that's the reason why i'm no longer in bondage because my god is greater than any devil although my what roller is the sweetheart though she's pretty good so they brought joseph there and pharaoh begins to explain to joseph it's like i can't i can't sleep i have these dreams and none of these guys can't interpret and can you just imagine as he's pointing to the very people that he's come to rely on the sorcerers the the the astrologers uh all these guys are like now they can't interpret the dreams and they're all looking away it's like well this is embarrassing and joseph's looking one against many he knows where he stood so there he was and then joseph let me tell you when you know where you stand with god you don't stutter there's not a crack in your voice you know how to speak with authority come on somebody you have the ability to speak to the devil with authority there shouldn't be a crack in your voice shouldn't be any doubt devil please leave my house nah that ain't that's not how i work devil you have no right in my house you have no right to my health you have no right to my children you have no right to my job i rebuke you in the name of jesus christ speak with authority you're the child of a king man if uh jeff bezos he's a billionaire if elon musk they're a billionaire if uh of bill gates he's a billionaire warren buffett y'all know who the billionaires are if they gave you a blank check i guarantee you there won't be enough zeros that you write who would stop by the only two zeros who would stop at only three zeros they gave you a blank check come on somebody there won't be enough zeros and you know it's not gonna bounce god has given you a blank check stop sitting around and being wallowing in yourself pity use that check write your blessings don't let the devil rob you of your blessings you write down your blessings and cash it in amen they brought joseph to pharaoh he begins to interpret the dreams he he's listening to pharaoh's dream zach uh-huh fatty califor huh slim caps uh huh uh-huh the the corner of lee's huh uh-huh uh by that time he already knew the interpretation like oh being courteous he's like all right um here's the interpretation everybody's not this ain't i mean this is like a massive amount of people you have like a host of astrologers and all the courts just watching this scene unfold a nobody talking to supposedly a somebody not not realizing that he's represented by god and he commended the area he took control of the area i could just imagine those who started pace around like you know i know the interpretation of the dream no one would ever talk to pharaoh like that there'll be all hamburgers like pharaoh here's the dream can i speak joseph he knew who his maker was he's like pharaoh this is an interesting one i know it he didn't care he knew who he was he says the fatty calf that's seven years of plenty and the other dream that's all the same thing seven years of plenty they're both the same thing and uh can somebody keep it down over there please he's commending it he's not afraid i keep it i just i want to concentrate the other seven years is a year is a famine and pharaoh is fixated his eyes right on joseph because he's been this he's been disturbed by the stream he needs an interpretation he can't sleep at night no one so he's listening and everybody else is listening he's like the other seven years are seven years of famine and he could have stopped there he could have stopped right there but god in his infinite wisdom joseph probably i don't know i wasn't back there he looked with the smile he's like you know i got a solution to this now what i would suggest is that you find somebody [Music] that could watch over the years of plenty and store up food and um when the years of famine come because it's gonna be all forgotten with the food would have been stored up and can you just imagine that was just that was just ingenious thinking god knows how to put the right words in your mouth if you gotta go to an interview i've gone i've gone to a lot of interviews i don't even know the words i'm going to say i say lord anoint my lips [Music] anoint the ears let me say the right things and at that very moment he moves on the scene he says you could just find yourself a man and over the seven years they could watch over the you know collect the plenty and then the year during the years of famine we could kind of you know kind of store give it back and make sure that people are covered during the years of of the seven years of famine and pharaoh's like that's that's right that's right he was so relieved and as if he pharaoh had no idea what he was walking into and joseph was right here waiting for him pharaoh stood up i made up my mind and everybody listening we need to find a person joseph knew we need to find a person that can oversee this thing i can't think of anyone but you all those setbacks was to prepare him for a major comeback god elevated him can you just imagine the fear that with through potiphar the fear that went through the guards and all the people that has done him wrong to realize the very person you've been talking about the very person you mischaracterized the very person that you chided has now been elevated to a position but here's the difference as i close with this here's the difference between a godly elevation and a worldly elevation a worldly elevation would say you got it coming a worthy elevation would say you didn't see this coming huh you're gonna get it now that's a worldly elevation a worldly elevation would boast himself or herself a worldly elevation we'll be like um where's my office gonna be at that's a worldly elevation but a godly elevation joseph found mercy with all those he interacted with joseph walked humble that may not get a lot of amens but it's still true joseph was not thinking about avenging people joseph was thinking about how can he be of best servant and represent god the best long story short the famine happened in the land joseph is now seated in heavenly places the right hand of of a and y'all know the types and then he brings his father and his brethren and you know how they go through this unveiling and then they finally realize who he was and joseph said you have done this for my bad but god has intended it for your good as we stand everything that joseph went through was for the good of someone else what you go through may not be for just you yourself to mold you of who you are to build your character to make you what you've become but it could very well be to be a blessing for someone else the trials of your faith i can't tell you how many times someone has come to me or have gone to others and said you know i appreciate you sharing this because i was going through something because sometimes the devil wants you to think that you're the only one that's going through it but his tactics are not new it's the same old taxes that he strived for centuries and if saints of old were able to overcome in the past then you are able to overcome today not by your own ability but i can do all things through christ who strengthened me you believe that when you get up tomorrow morning or when you leave today you say lord i can do all things through christ all things whatever your hands touch is blessed because the bible says greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world you're not meant to be grounded you're meant to be elevated that's the reason why in this age in this age alone saints there were four beasts that was led out in the church ages an ox a man an eagle why am i drawing a blanket a lion but only an eagle in this age only an ego in this age was given to you so that way you could fly above all of the criticism above all of the hatred above all the rejection above all of the malice above all of these things and not only that but the natural should take on the spiritual and so much that you believe it that one of these days one of these days you're gonna get up in the morning you're gonna think it's a regular day when you put your feet on the ground you're gonna soon realize you're touching the streets of gold one of these days you're going to be driving into work you're going to drive right into glory one of these days you're going to be in your prayer room with the eyes shut in your hands raised to find the laws of gravity and by the time you're done and you open your eyes you're going to see that you're in glory one of these days saints everything that we preached everything that you believed everything that we acted on becomes much more than just words that's printed on a book much more than just an amen that you say much more than a shaking of hands or quote it becomes a reality of what you have believed you love the lord god bless you saints god bless you thank you for your patience i know i took a little extra time i still wore of prayer by psalm if you want to come up and dismiss let's just say a word of prayer lord jesus we just thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for the word of truth father i poured my heart out to your dear people i couldn't find the right words but i just wanted to bring out the the word the best that i know how and i just trust that someone received
