appreciate the musicians Our Song leader all the specials everything that has been done in Jesus name amen and for his glory wooa is that is that how y'all say praise God hurah hurah all right I I like that I like that amen and and and you know y'all had the Brotherhood style but see y'all sing a song like that y'all how spirit and Truth just start adding to it that's that's this just that's spirit and Truth Tabernacle thank God let us turn our Bibles to Isaiah 61 amen Isaiah 601 um we will U just take a a little thought here today and and I have a strong feeling that I will not finish uh what the Lord has placed in my spirit but nonetheless we will get started amen uh in this says um the spirit of the Lord God is upon me amen because the Lord hath anointed me to preach Good Tidings unto the meek he hath sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty uh to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and the day of Vengeance of our God to comfort all that mourn uh I will just read that scripture let you be seated I do have one other scripture hold on one second um one more scripture that we'll read uh just to open the service but let's pray and I'll let you be seated okay father we thank you for all that has uh occurred thus far in the service and we can feel your Mighty power uh your anointing that has come to destroy yolks and uh we're asking God that as we turn our attention to the word that the word would do exactly what the word is supposed to do and uh father we we know our gathering is not uh by happen stance we know our gathering was ordained of you before the foundation of the world so God we pray that you take control over this portion of the service take control over every thought that is being presented and also take control of over every thought that is being received we ask God that you would just bless your people father even right now in Jesus name we pray amen amen amen you can be seated and uh if you don't mind just turn with me also to Leviticus uh 25 we'll read um some verses from there uh before we jump into our thought and um before I forget uh our uh topic today is Jubilee year amen jubile year amen as I was meditating on this that old song came back to my mind this is the Year of Jubilee when a lame shall walk all right and the blind shall see and they say when the Lord will set the captiv free and it was a declaration this is the Year of Jubilee and we would just get excited with that and we at a I we put a little Jewish Twist on it this is a year stop stop stop stop stop no I ain't going to let y'all do that turn to Leviticus [Applause] 25 and the Lord spake unto Moses in Mount siai saying I know how y'all are so I'm not going to let y'all the Lord spake unto Moses in Mount Si saying Speak unto the children of isra Israel and say unto them when ye come into the land which I give you then shall the land keep a Sabbath unto the Lord so the land the land had to keep a [Applause] Sabbath it wasn't just the people keeping the Sabbath but also the land would have to keep a Sabbath sir six years Thou shalt seow thy field six years Thou shalt prune thy Vineyard and gather in the fruit thereof but in the seventh year shall be a Sabbath of rest unto the land a Sabbath for the Lord Thou shalt neither sow thy field nor prune thy Vineyard you wouldn't even work during this year uh that which groweth of its own accord of thy Harvest Thou shalt not reap neither gather The Grapes of thy Vine undress for it is a year of rest unto the Lord I'm sorry unto the land and the Sabbath of the land shall be meat for you for thee and for thy servant and for thy maid and for thy hired servant and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee and for thy cattle and for the beasts that are in thy land shall all the increase thereof be meat and thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee seven times seven years and the space of the uh of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee 4 and9 years then shalt thou cause the Trum ET of the Jubilee to sound on the 10th day of the seventh month in the day of atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land and ye shall Hollow the 50th year and Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and ye shall return unto every man uh uh and ye shall return every man unto his possession and ye shall return every man unto his family and Jubilee shall a jubilee shall that 50th year be unto you ye shall not sow neither reap that which groweth of itself in it nor gather the grapes in it of thy Vine undressed for it is the Jubilee it shall be holy unto you ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field in the Year of Jubilee uh ye shall return every man unto his possession amen so just a little context of scripture here uh for us as we talk about Jubilee year and as I said I know I won't finish this talk but we will get started Amen in this journey I want to take um to a opening quote from a sermon that the prophet preached and his title was Jubilee year amen let's take a quote from there and he makes a couple comments a statement here he says and these scriptures tonight that we read in here uh are fulfilled again in the days of the Gentiles they have eyes but they can't see they have ears but they can't hear and God is doing Miracles and signs and wonders and people are just simply closing their eyes to it because the prophecy has said it would be that way it says now Jesus was prophesied by uh Isaiah to preach the acceptable year we just read that in Isaiah 61 he says he was prophesied to preach the acceptable year that's what we want to deal on on tonight now the acceptable year was this that uh enduring the time between so many years acceptable year is the year called in the old writings the Year of Jubilee He says they come uh he says I believe was either every every every seven years was a jubilee year he says every seven years they let the ground rest they grow no fruit on it or planted no crops they let uh their crops in the field rest every seven years and that and at that time was a jubilee now um I want to just um mention that um that's a prophetic definition of Jubilee Praise God and there are many definitions that we could take I'm going to read some of them uh to you but some of the theologians would argue and they would say that the Jubilee year is actually the 50th year seven sabbaths uh he talked about and and then it says the 50th year would be a year Jubilee but what brother brandom just showed us that every s years of Jubilee would happen right and not and and and and I believe he's tying this into another scripture which we won't take time to read uh maybe we can maybe we got time to read it um Exodus 21 amen Exodus 21 uh these are prophetic definitions and I I appreciate prophetic definitions not just the theological definitions but prophetic but here in Exodus 21 we see um we see I I believe where brother brandom's kind of bringing this thought together and and I would just also just mention uh when I think about Jubilee Jubilee is a release amen a jubilee is not just a 50e celebration but a jubilee is when something has been released something has been set free glory to God Amen that that's when a real Jubilee is taking place and and brother brandom has some I mean I believe tying some things to scripture uh and his thought process and and even when he preached the message Jubilee year I was listening to it yesterday and I mean he came to the pull pit saying he didn't really have anything to preach but he came out and preached Jubilee year with nothing to preach praise God I I thank God for a prophet yes sir amen but here in in in uh Exodus 21 says now these are the judgments which Thou shalt set before them if thou buy an Hebrew servant six years He Shall Serve and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing all right so now this is a human being being released Amen in the seventh year the land had to rest for six years and then the seventh year was was was I'm sorry they worked the land for six years but the seventh seventh year it was it was time for rest Hallelujah it was it was a release glory to God and it says now um verse three says if he came in by himself he shall go out by himself if he were married then his wife shall go out with him if his master have given him a wife and she have borne him Sons or daughters the wife and her children shall be her Masters and he shall go out by himself all right it says and if the servant shall plainly say I love my master my wife and my children I will not go out free my God says then his master shall bring him unto the judges he shall also bring him to the door and unto the doorpost and his master shall bore his ear through with an A and he shall serve him forever you know and and I thought about that I said you know this man uh first he gets trapped into a situation maybe through uh uh his finances are kind out of control and he he's indebted and he has to sell him self to be become a slave to somebody else but God orchestrated a plan he put a plan in place that if a man got on Hard Times there was a way out he didn't have to live in that condition for the rest of his life there was a way this man could come out because every every seven years by law the man would have to come out of that condition glory to God now now here's the thing you know if a man saw himself in in that in that situation and he went in with his wife the seventh year his wife could be released with him but if he got married while he was in that situation amen uh if he got he got married to one of the another slave then that slave amen would have to stay there that woman would have to stay there with her children with that Master and that man could go free however that man decided I want to stay with my wife I want to stay with my children I want to stay with my MK if that man decided to do that then he became a slave for the rest of his life now now I want you to get this the man would only make a decision like that if he thought things were better for him he man been actually being free on and I I want to I want you to get this if the man thought that condition of bondage was better than freedom than the man was stay in bondage and the only reason the man was stay in bondage because maybe for the first six years the the the the his owner treated him with with wrong like royalty but he does not understand when he makes a deal to go before the public and have his ear Bor with an awe the masc could change everything about how he was treating that man and he would be bound to him for the rest of his life I want to tell you something don't you make no agreement with the devil I don't care how the devil might be treating you right now don't you a no agreements with the devil because things will [Music] change you can find yourself Bound for the rest of your [Applause] life the prophet told us that every seven years they let the ground rest they grow no fruit on it nor planted crops they let the crops in the field rest every seven years and at that time it was a jubilee so when I think of Jubilee I think of Freedom right I think of release it's not just 50 years that's not what we're talking about I think of emancipation I think of Liberty amen and and and I was just looking amen at some famous quotes of people that said things about Liberty or about Freedom just wanted to read to you a couple things Benjamin Franklin made a statement he says whoever would overthrow the Liberty of a Nation must begin by subduing the freeness of speech I want to drop that on you again Benjamin Franklin told us whoever would overthrow the liberty of a Nation must begin by subduing the freeness of speech that's the truth amen John F Kennedy made a statement he says let every nation know whether it wishes us well or ill it says that we shall pay any price come on bear any burden meet any hardship support any friend oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of Liberty amen praise God Harriet Tubman she says I would fight for my Liberty so long as my strength lasted and if the time uh came for me to go the Lord will let let them take me Thomas Jefferson he said we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights among th among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men now now when you use that word in aable that's a part of our constitution I just thought of a little quote here that brother brandham used that same word in because you know when you think about in alen in inalienable it means it's unable to be taken away amen amen and it it can't be given away by the possessor they cannot take it from you freedom is something the devil can't take from you glory to God and brother brandham said something in the Ephesian Church age he says uh what the church had at Pentecost glory to God is her inalienable right that mean what what what the church received at Pentecost is something that can never be taken away let me tell you something you can't preach it out of the church you can't pray it out of the church what God gave the church at Pentecost is supposed to still be there he saids what the church had at Pentecost is her inalienable right originally she had the pure word of God she had the power of the spirit manifested and divver signs and wonders and Gifts of the Holy Ghost if they had it then we have it now glory to God we won't let it go another statement here another quote uh on Liberty and freedom Patrick Henry said Give me liberty give me death or give me death amen brother random preached about Arnold Von Winkle Reed and he uh he made a statement he says Make Way for Liberty Hallelujah all these famous statements and amen Martin Luther King made a statement he said free at last free at last thank God Almighty we are free at last amen but greater than any of these our lord Jesus made some statements about Liberty one of those in Isaiah 61 says Proclaim Liberty to the captives also we'll find that same amen writing over in Luke 4:18 which we'll read a little bit later but it says to set at Liberty them that are bruised and I thought about you know now how did Jesus do this how did Jesus Proclaim Liberty to those that were cast of how did he set at Liberty those that were bruised and you know you go back in Amen in scripture and we can see different ones that uh that needed Liberty amen God made a way for people to get out of situations that were they were in one was the woman that was caught in adultery right now now now now now now now Jesus did not deny that the lady was not in adultery amen it's just the way that he handled it his job was to Proclaim Liberty some people are caught in situations that they really don't want to be in Hallelujah and when this woman come amen they cast her at his feet had the rocks in their hand ready to Stone this lady to death they say what do you say he begin to just write in the sand and they had no idea what he was writing but he rose up and he spoke one word he that's without sin that's right let him cast the first stone and all the Rocks begin to drop everybody walked away and Jesus asked says woman where your accusers says I have not said I don't accuse you either said but go no and send no more amen he set her free another uh situation that we find amen is the man at the pool of Bethesda sat in that condition for 38 years but when Jesus walked up to said will you be made whole this was a man that needed a jubilee in his body he needed a jubilee here we also have a man Legion with 2,000 Demons Inside of him Jesus set that man at Liberty yes the woman at the well was set at Liberty many different situations we can look in the scripture and see what Jesus did exactly what he said he was going to do Jesus also said if the son therefore shall make you free then you shall be free indeed another statement that Jesus said in John 8:32 says and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free I pray I pray to God that people hear the truth through the sermon that God has given them today Jubilee year amen we look at some other definitions of this word Jubilee I just pulled it up Amen on on the computer and just grabb the a couple definitions and one said amen a special anniversary of an event remember a prophetic definition amen kind of pulls us more towards a release amen but here amen uh uh uh here here they got a special anniversary of an event especially one celebrating 25 or 50 years of rign or activity amen they would call it a jubilee celebration all right uh sometimes in in marriage you get to 50 years it's a jubilee year in your marriage or or even 20 5 years they would call it a jubilee year but but here you know again that that's these are these are nomenal amen definitions that I want to give you but but I want you to watch some of the connections here also in Judaism they said in Jewish history a year of emancipation and restoration established every 50 years so that was a jubilee to in in in Judaism also in Catholicism amen they have what they call a full Jubilee year it's a period of remission from the penal consequences of sin the penalty of sin granted by the Roman Catholic Church under certain conditions for a year and usually at intervals of of 25 years now the Roman Catholic Church goes through this little process of of granting people freedom from their sins and they'll do it every 25 years and they'll call it a full Jubilee year now with that being said this year is 2 and well that lets you know that the Roman Catholic Church is celebrating a jubilee this year Hallelujah right and and and I was just looking at some of the the the they said their jile began on Christmas Eve of 2024 and it's going to end on January 6th of 2026 they claiming the whole year right right they claim in a whole year as a jubilee year now they also have a a theme for theirs it's called amen the pilgrims of Hope and they got so much program and everything out there I don't I don't advise you to go and look at that but but it's it's I'm just letting you know it's it's out there right he says in uh uh but but here you know I want to I want to let me just give you a little bit more of the definition so 2025 is a jubilee holy year for the Roman Catholic Church marking the 2025th anniversary of the the Incarnation of Our Lord it says an event of great spiritual significance uh to the Catholic church and is a time of renewal and a pilgrimage that's for the Roman Catholic church but we're not the Jubilee we're talking about is not going to take us back to Rome amen glory to God there there's all kind of people lined up to go to Rome this year because this is their Jubilee year they even have a like a a pilgrimage for the young people to go back to Rome this year my God but we are not talking about a jubilee that's taking us back to Rome the Jubilee that I'm talking about this morning amen is going to put us in our rightful place in [Music] Christ it's a release to go back to your rightful place in Christ if the Devils had you bound this is your year of release and I'm not just declaring this is your year I'm telling you this is your day of release to go back to where you was when the gospel trumpet begins to sound you got to hear what the spirit is speaking to you accept your freedom and walk in it thank you Lord amen Amen brother random amen makes a statement in the message and I'm going to give a amen a a uh a couple couple more definitions here but let me give you a quote out of R return and Jubilee brother brandom says something to us says now if someone or other the individual lost their inheritance that was given to them by God there come a year called The Jubilee Year and that was every seven years they had rest a Sabbath every seven days they had a Sabbath every seven years they had a Sabbath and and seven sabbaths was 49 years and the 50th year was a jubilee says and in this Jubilee every man that had lost his inheritance by some means if he was a Freeborn and a true blooded Israelite no matter who held the possession it had to go back to him free praise God he didn't have to pay a thing amen he didn't have to do a thing my God but just stop what he was doing and go back to his inheritance he didn't have to pay a thing he have to do a thing but what he need to do is stop what he was doing and go back to his inheritance you talk about a restoration Hallelujah he says Oh my he had a right to it it was a god-given right because he by Grace had inherited it and would be given to his fathers and handed down year after year no matter what had taken place if he lost it it must go free amen I thank God for that it meant Grace is uh Grace is is a way provided for each individual to return to their rightful inheritance watch this what a picture it gives us tonight of the church in this last day you see what man can do and then you see what God does What man does is failing and will fail has failed and always will fail but what God does is eternal and must forever remain nothing can ever take it away okay God give it is his free gift and by Sovereign foresight saw it and placed it and there's nothing can ever move it it's inalienable nothing can ever move it it's there eternally and that Jubilee was God's Mana of expressing Grace to his people you know this this to me he says God's God's man of expressing Grace to his people for restoring or be brought back to their rightful position so when a jubilee trumpet sounds it is the grace of God coming directly to you to bring you back to the place where you're supposed to be oh Hallelujah it does not matter how you lost your [Applause] status it does not matter how long you've been lost in that condition when a jubilee trumpet sounds a gospel Ju believe trumpet sounds it goes beyond all the mistakes that you make it goes beyond your failures it goes beyond anything you ever did or ever could do you can't restore yourself but the grace of God is more than able to restore you to your rightful position Hallelujah glory to God Amen I'm talking about if you ever been a real believer and somehow you lose your position just like an Israelite was born an Israelite but lost their their their their land lost everything but God had established by law when the priest come and blow the trumpet that man ain't got to work no more unless he wants to now brother on if he want to stay in that condition right then he's Bound for the rest of his life Hallelujah but I ain't I haven't seen I I don't know I don't know if if if it was me if I'm in any place of bondage I I just don't like it brother I can't even be on an elevator with a whole bunch of people stuck in the back my amen I have a hard time getting in the backseat of a of a of a twodo car yeah yeah I feel confined yeah amen huh I no no I need four doors I can't depend on nobody to open the door to get me out of here I got to be able to open my own [Music] door it's something about me I don't like [Applause] bondage you know they I went to the doctor one time and they said they want to do a uh a MRI and I said now is that the machine that you have to get in and go underneath this this little tunnel and just kind of stand how long you got to stay they say we leave you there for a few minutes that ain't going to work for me that that one won't work for me I already know said well we got we got one special for for people like you I said okay what's the other one that you got he said this one you sit down there I said okay I got that I can do that I can do that no problem and uh and I went down and I sat down then that guy put one bar across me so I got this then he put another bar across me ah okay then I think he put like two more I said I get me out of here get me out I can't take it it's something about bondage that does not agree with me Hallelujah I'm using that as a spiritual type A Son of God don't like to be bound a daughter of God don't like to be bound they always looking for a way of Escape praise God God made you that way so you wouldn't be bound he wants you to be free oh my my my my I don't care what you done you could have did it last night it does not matter when the Jubilee trumpet sounds you can go [Applause] free I'm giving you another some other definitions here of this Jubilee here in uh I I have a a Bible amen uh dictionary at home the zandan handbook to the Bible and and they were uh reading uh they were just giv a definition on this on this Jubilee and and they were referring to Leviticus 25 they were actually given a breakdown of of Leviticus 25 and um it says this chapter looks forward to the time when the nation will occupy the promised land now so they they were in bondage uh then left Egypt going through the Wilderness and now they getting ready to go to to the promised land and when they get to the promised land God has given them law to establish for the promised land now can you imagine that yeah yeah I hope we I hope we get this before they even got to the promised land God had already established law to First protect them when they were in the promised land if you find yourself in bondage this law in Exodus is going to release you right yes the land itself I'm going to put a Sabbath on the land itself so I want I want the I want the land to continue to produce for you and we're going to need to have to we have to give in the seventh year we got to give the land rest so God had if I can just put it this way God had already thought aead can I tell y'all something if God already thought a head for [Applause] land I can tell you this you are more important than land and if God had already thought a head for land God has also thought a head for [Music] you amen here in the zandan handbook to the Bible says this chapter looks forward to the time when the nation will occupy the promised land the pattern of sevens reflected in the festivals now now now they're referring to festivals which is amen these different feasts and so that said the pattern of seven reflected in the festivals and and I don't have time to to hit all this but I I am going to come back to it uh the pattern of seven reflected in the festivals chapter 23 the Leviticus 23 is extended to the land one year and seven is the LIE phow one year and seven is the LI lie fow which means to be left unsown uh in order it's it's to be left unsown for a period in order to restore its [Music] fertility can I I I'm going just try to break this down down goad even the land going to be restored you you you you know we're in this journey through restoration this is connected all to to our journey and and and and and and the other thing you know at the beginning of the last year our our theme was get back in step and uh with the inspiration of of our restore sayth the Lord with that that that theme has carried over into this year and being that the them carried over into this year we got a second level of inspiration and that is the year of overflow yes sir the land itself would go through restoration every seven years amen watch this it says um so so so so they said the pattern of seven is reflected in the festival so the the festivals was the Feast of Passover the Feast of unle bread and that Feast of unle bread is something that happens in the months of March to April for for uh for for for the Jewish people uh also the Feast of first fruits that usually happens in April the Feast of Weeks which is also called a feast of Pentecost uh that happens typically in June the Feast of trumpets amen is a new year festival and and the first of three festivals in the seventh month which that happens in September to October time frame and then then you know some of those those other things that happen underneath Feast of trumpets is the day of atonement and the last Feast is the Feast of Tabernacles Hallelujah and the Feast of Tabernacles is a a Perpetual reminder of the nation's tent dwelling days when Israel had to dwell in tents what what I what I have a desire to do is go back and kind of break down those feasts because I think it's going to be very important but today we can't do all of that I'm just giving you amen some some some Cliff Notes also a continuation of the zandan hand book to the Bible they say the 50th year following the 7th seven say is an extra phow year right where nothing is swn in order for the land to be restored nothing is swn during that F year it's an extra fall year for the land which reverts Amen to its original owner it's a time when those who have fallen on bad times have their freedom and their property restored the Jubilee the year restoration that's what they put in there Jubilee is the year restoration and it serves a dual purpose and they said It reminds the people that the land belongs to God and it prevents the wealthy from amassing Land oh my now I like I like I like these definitions amen that they give us uh oh Lord I'm I'm trying my best not to get ahead of myself but it it is just uh it is so hard it is so hard I and I I have to I'm going just have to get ahead of myself I I Lord please God help me help me I want to show something I want to show something let's go back to Leviticus 25 that 50th year was a Year of Jubilee uh people return back to their possessions and they have freedom again but there was something else that happened now remember they were told not to seow in the Jubilee year if we don't sow how will we eat well I'll just put it this way if you can be obedient you eat more than you ever imagined amen amen watch Leviticus 25:17 let's pick this up now okay I got the wrong getting ready to read y'all Deuteronomy 25 let me go to the uh let me let me give you uh something here oh my Lord Jesus thank you God amen amen all right here we go Leviticus 25:1 17 it says ye shall not therefore oppress one another but Thou shalt fear thy God for I am the Lord your God wherefore ye shall do my statutes and keep my judgments and do them and ye shall dwell in the land in safety my God and the land shall yield her fruit and ye shall eat your field and dwell in dwell therein in safety and if ye shall say what shall we eat the seventh year if you got that question what we going to eat the seventh year behold we shall not seow nor Gather in our increase then I will command my blessing amen upon you in the six year watch this now watch this now oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and it shall bring forth fruit for three years what do you call that hallelujah amen if you would be obedient you would experien an overflow and once you saw the Overflow then you knew was also time for the Jubilee they both were connected together when you experience the Overflow you knew the Jubilee was next sir Hallelujah my God my God a overflow and a restoration goes together God Amen I I I I I I I hope we get it we can go right back to Exodus 20 I believe it was but I know it's in Exodus where if you caught the devil stealing the devil did not have to just return what he stole or the thief did not just have return what they stole they had to restore double that means you got a overflow when somebody stole something from you and if you caught them we have caught the devil stealing we know that that we don't watch that devil take our our children out we don't watch that devil take our loved ones out we done watch that we caught him stealing red-handed and since I caught you the promise to me is I get back double so if you got my son messed up with some girl in the world I'm taking my son and I'm taking her if my daughter's messed up with somebody in the world I'm taking my daughter and I'm taking him I'm taking double I'm not settling just for getting that one back I want to praise God I told you our God does not subtract Our God adds and he multiplies [Applause] yes my Lord I I I I'm I'm under expectation the sixth year in the sixth year if they were obedient in the sixth year they were supposed to experience an overflow I mean you look at them crops like my look at all the not I mean crops that will last you for three [Music] years how how would you like to and now I need you to understand this now they're not working in the seventh year no work that means if you're not working you got to have something to sustain you while you're not [Applause] working if God decide to just give me a little break yes sir cuz that's what he did for them if he decided to just give me a little break now this year I'm going to let you just take this year off you can travel a little bit now in order for me to do that I got to have something somewhere the Overflow comes in the sixth year that's why you got to handle your overflow the right way come on now but the Overflow happens in the sixth year just before the Jubilee my God my God my God let me let me let me let me let me move on oh my this is this is this is just too much for me I'm telling you uh oh my I'll come back to that I'll come back but I told you I'm getting I'm getting ahead of myself I had this lined up a certain way and now y'all done pull me all all all out of it amen I got to find myself where am I amen amen amen amen amen oh my thank you for the Overflow father thank you Lord thank you and this not just something just for us to be uh excited about no we see the promises in the scripture sir and if God can bless Israel that way right he can bless us that way oh yes he can he can give you so much business in one year Hallelujah now now don't spin up all the money right you're going to need that to carry you through 3 years and then at the end of 3 years get back out there and start [Applause] working my my my my little handy book key to the Bible all right amen sister Michelle I thank you for that book it's been a blessing to me all these years they have this uh Jubilee they Define it it's a Grand National Festival Israel held every 50th year it was it was the year of release now you know as as I thought about this you know and and and and I know that um uh the Catholics are celebrating it this year and that that's that they can they do what they do right but uh but we're looking at it because this is like I said this not taking us back to Rome this is taking us back to our rightful position in Christ and uh but but when it talk about um uh a year release the very first day of this year I got a release January 1st Hallelujah 2025 I got an email and it told me that I had been released from my student loan payments now let me tell you something Jesus uh there's all kind of conversations going on about you know people being released from their student loan and all that look I've paid a lot of money to them schools interest and everything I'm sure they got all their money back from me and some I'm sure they got it but if somebody send you an email and tell you that your debt has been released you going to rejoice in that now few years ago we had all these problems and the government released a lot of big companies from debt in order to keep them afloat right now now if they do that for the companies why not do it for the people that work for the companies oh my so I'm just saying if they want to release me from my house payment praise [Applause] God I will take it blessing I will take it but I I experienced a jubilee I was released from a death I was grateful for that am grateful for that am amen I only had about eight more years on it that means I really didn't have a lot left to pay that's that's fine you say free that's for me a jubilee is a grand National Festival of Israel held every 50 year it was a year of release when all debts were cancelled and all prisoners and slaves were liberated and when all lands and Estates whether they had been sold or mortgaged were restored to their original possessors the joyful event was proclaimed by the sound of the trumpet in the evening of the day of atonement that the rich might not be unwilling to surrender the property of others nor the injured to for forgive those who had offended so even in the year release oh let's let's just work with that for a little bit the injured would have to forgive those who had [Music] offended uh uh let's let's make sure we get it now so sometimes amen uh we get injured internally Yeah by what somebody has said about what somebody has done amen and that injur that injury on the inside actually affects the way we respond on the outside come on preacher you know and and and and and Jesus had given us a parable and he told us about this man amen that uh he owed the king a lot of money and and when he went and he asked the king would you please forgive me I just don't have the money to pay you would you please forgive me the king felt sorry for him and says okay I released you gave the man a Jubilee He released him from his debts and that same man went home and he found a man that owed him some money and when he saw this man he says now you need you either pay me now you going to prison right now and he said he said I'm sorry he gave a story said and he said I ain't buying your story I'm sending you to prison well there was some other folks saw that man yeah my God put his put a man in prison he owed the king let's say $10,000 this man owed him about $10 right and he put the man in prison over $10 Somebody went and told the king say you know that man you just freed he went and put a man in prison and owed him $10 King said what you don't appreciate the grace that I have given you if you have received re Grace you have to give Grace if you have received forgiveness then you have to give forgiveness and the Year of Jubilee was a time for you to release people of their internal [Applause] debts good yeah yeah yeah you got something you dealing with on the inside it builds a complex Plex on inside of you you can't shake your brother's hand you can't shake your you can't hug your sister you bypass [Music] [Applause] them is this I I think I'm preaching I believe I'm you bypassed him come on but when the year Jubilee comes you got to release that debt whatever they did to you you have to let it go [Applause] hu I forgive you my brother and and look look look look look I'm not talking about you walking up to somebody and telling them I forgive you they they don't even know they did nothing I'm talking about you in your heart I forgive you my brother I forgive you my sister and when you're able to do that in your heart then you should be able to greet them again that's amen hallelujah amen Freedom um it says uh this joyful event was proclaimed this is from key to the Bible it was proclaimed by the sound of the trumpet in the evening of the day of atonement that the rich might not be unwilling to surrender the property of others nor the injured to forgive those who had offended while they all have been imploring the pardoning mercy of God I want to go back to a quote here out of restoration of the Bride tree this is where our inspiration has come amen for this hour restore sayith the Lord um brother random uh makes a statement here about enforcing and he says enforce cuz this this was this was a this this Jubilee was a year of release release from deaths prisoners slaves uh everybody was liberated the lamb was liberated everything was liberated he says enforce there uh then we are we have the privilege to enforce upon Satan the claims that God give us and and you just ask us what what has God given you that the devil oh has taken what is God giving you that the is taken well there comes a time where you can rise up and and remember I I I I shared this remember the the woman um that had left her land in the the days of the Prophet Elijah I believe yeah and she had left her land right and uh she was gone because famine was in the land I think for about seven years well she left her property and and by the time she got back there were people in that property but it was hers so when she comes Amen to the king to request that she goes that she can get her property back uh the the the king had just been hearing testimonies and in the testimony service he said please tell us tell me some of these uh these Miracles that happened under Elisha's Ministry oh he did this and he did that and he prayed for This Woman's child and the child raised up from the dead and you know so so many precious Miracles that that that that he did when when while the testimony service was happening the lady coming back after 7 years being away her timing was absolutely perfect Jesus she comes back at that time while the testimony service is going on and and and and and the servant looks at her say King this is the woman right here that I just told you about that's now this is the one I mean she this is a living testimony her in a son she said King I'm just here to say yeah maybe maybe she shared her own version of testimony to say but I'm I'm here for a reason not just to share my testimony and now I need something I need my property I need my property and the King said I tell you what you're going to get your property and I am going to send a guard with you I'm sending a soldier with you to make sure you get back your property Hallelujah the and what it's pretty much saying is that if anybody on your land you ain't got to fight you just show up and you make your claim Hallelujah when you show up and make your claim the enforcer the the the the security guard the police officer whatever you want to call them the enforcers there to make sure you get what belongs to you and brother bandam tells us us he says enforce we have the privilege to enforce upon Satan the claims that God give us for God has a law and his word is a law and God uh in this word made certain claim to the church therefore we have a right to force these claims upon Satan and say give it back Glory I like that you can just feel the inspiration hitting the prophet you have a right to tell the devil give it back Hallelujah in the year Jubilee they have to work for the devil no more brother they can drop whatever they was doing and go back to their possessions amen amen says give it back and he has to do it amen because we can take God's agent the Holy Spirit go right down on our knees and say it's Theus sayith the Lord he's got to give it up that's all cuz the holy spirit is there to make him do it brother I a I ain't fighting with the devil I'm just making my claim give it back Satan give me back my son praise God give me back my daughter Hallelujah anything the devil has taken from you you can enforce a claim am amen and I love that part the Holy Ghost the holy spirit is the one that's there to make him do it I I can just hear did you hear what they just said in prayer yeah release [Applause] it he's got to give it up that's all cu the holy spirit is there to make him do it the law of the land is to enforce is B land for the land but the law of the spirit of God is to force Satan yeah to give up that which he has unrightfully deceitfully taken from God Amen Souls of men he took from God Souls of women children sickness of the body he placed upon people where where where God Made Them In His Image to be like him and the church is given the rightful legal rights by the Bible to take the Holy Spirit and enforce this upon them yeah thank God I'm not going to live short of my privileges amen I'm not living beneath my privileges amen amen I'm claiming everything amen thank you Lord the key to the Bible definition of Jubilee continues it says the Jubilee had a two-fold design it was political and it was typical is what they have in a definition and the political says it's to prevent oppression of the poor and Perpetual servitude that a kind of equality might be preserved in the families while the tribal distinctions were known it might be ascertained that the Messiah descended from the tribe of Judah the typical uh definition or a purpose was toe to predict the blessings of the New Covenant by which the liberty of the Gospel from sin and Satan and the salvation of Jesus Christ might be enjoyed with each eternal glory he says Isaiah alluded to the Jubilee of Israel and foretelling the ministry of the Messiah as his words were interpreted by our savior when we read in Isaiah 61 verse 1-2 it told us what Jesus would do now we pick up Jesus in Luke chapter 4 Jesus went to church and you know the Bible says it was customary right right for Jesus to go to church right amen if Jesus went to church why don't you go Amen to church amen the other thing that Jesus did not do Jesus didn't stay home the [Applause] stream Jesus got up church and went to church they saw him in church but this one day he goes to church in Luke 4 um verse 16 and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written so Jesus they gave him the book he goes to church this day and he said why don't you to read a scripture for us and he opens up the book he finds Isaiah and goes right to Isaiah 61 and he begins to read and it says the spirit of the Lord is upon me because Heath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he have sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and I love this part and recovering of sight to the blind amen now now when when when it says recovering of sight to the blind that means in the past this person has been able to see something has blocked their vision and and now not able to see the things they used to see right oh my we have a lot of people today in the message like that they have lost their sight right amen they they just don't they have they have they have questions about a lot of stuff in the message but but but look it's not the you know even brother brand say don't don't look at the message look at the [Music] message we we put a lot of attention on the messenger but we need to look at the message what was it that he said not not the man himself the man going to make mistakes just like you and I make mistakes that ain't got nothing to do with the message amen hallelujah glory to God often times what it is that people looking for the message to come through a perfect vessel no that's not the way that's not the way God operates even in even in Noah's day wasn't a perfect vessel right right but if you didn't get in the boat if you didn't get in the boat you were messed up you going to lose your life amen in in in Moses day was not a perfect vessel how do we know that Moses himself didn't even go into the promised land it was not a perfect vessel but if you didn't put blood over the door poost your son was dying firstborn son so we're not looking for perfect vessels there's only one perfect vessel his name is the Lord Jesus Christ amen but he did bring a perfect word amen just even by me preaching Jubilee amen again you go to the average Church they would take it only at the 50th year I'm taking it to a time of release because that's what brother Brandon brought us every seven years so Denny and I got the quote here anytime you hear the gospel trumpet sound amen it's a time of Jubilee for you amen I'm telling you you ain't got to wait seven years on you ain't got to wait 50 years you ain't got to wait 7 Minutes amen amen I'mma take it even a little further down you ain't even got to wait 7 Seconds you can go free right now because you heard the gospel trumpet sound amen amen amen oh my my my my I'm I I got to keep going he wants to recover the sight amen of the blind he also says to set at Liberty them that that are bruised and as I as I was just mentioning earlier when you think about the the bruise the bruise is something that happens on the inside of your body and then it manifests on the outside amen like if you were to uh there was a a table of something and you happen to walk by it didn't see it and you oh you hit it with that hited your leg or something like that that bruise going to happen on the inside and then all of a sudden on the outside you're going to see this little dark spot in your skin that that shows that there's a bruise and sometimes uh emotionally people actually get a bruised on the inside and then it reflects itself on the outside but what God what what the Lord Jesus came to do is actually set at Liberty those that have been bruised amen amen amen amen and then verse 19 says to preach the acceptable year of the Lord Brother random tells us that that acceptable year is the Year of Jubilee and um I was just thinking to myself you know they said it was a two-fold purpose political and typical that's that's those are theological definitions that I read to you but uh I believe a jubilee is a restoration I believe a a a jubilee amen has more than a two-fold purpose and earlier Amen in our journey here and get back and step we um uh we looked at the inspiration I will restore sayth the Lord and I said at that time and I'm saying it again a restoration can mean different things to different people it can mean Restoration in your health it can be Restoration in your family it can be Restoration in your business or your income it can be restoration of a prior position that you had that they took away from you right Hallelujah right it can be a restoration in an investment right amen it can be healing to your inner man amen let's let's just go back and just revisit some of that I'm running out of time here today but let me just give you let me let me give you uh a couple of these then I got one more quote to read and I'm going have to let it go but um Jeremiah 30: 17 restoration the Bible says for our restore Health unto thee and I will heal thee of thy wounds sayith the Lord because they call thee an outcast saying this is Zion whom no man seeketh after and and and I I just like that scripture let me just just hit it just for a little bit I'm going to heal you of your wounds and notice these wounds because they call [Music] thee because they called thee some of us need to go through healing on what other people have said about us and the Lord Jesus said I'm going to heal you of your wounds Hallelujah Jes Psalm 51: 11-12 this is healing to your inner man uh but David said cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy Holy Spirit from me and then he says this restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit God amen amen restoration is to deliver back again and and they use a scripture out of Genesis 20 and 7 if you go back and you you pick that up this is uh uh uh ailec being told by almighty God Abraham can I can I just I'm going just have to I'm I'm getting ahead of myself but I'm going just say it this week because I don't know when I'm going get back to say it uh hopefully next week I can get back to say it but uh I told yall brother berley might be passing through so I don't know what'll happen next week but we'll see uh um but uh I I I want to say that um um Sarah needed a jubilee right sir amen and jubilees jubilees are needed for people that find themselves in situations that they don't know how to get out of they don't they they they they in bondage they have no they they don't have money to pay their way out of it they don't have a family member with money to get them out of it they are just stuck but God orchestrated that at every seven year I don't care if the man is in this condition him and his wife could be like this God orchestrated you got to release him and let him [Music] go Sarah and Abraham had told this lie that put Sarah in a really really bad spot yeah this lie caused Sarah to be taken from Abraham because she says he's my brother rather than saying that that's my wife and that's my husband said we're brothers and sisters and this lie uh caused Sarah to be taken into AMC's home AMC was thanking God for sending him a new wife and I told you there's many things in this story that we have to look at aimc had no idea right Sarah's never had a child m and as a king he would not marry a woman that was Barren right he has a purpose for marrying this woman I want to bring forth children from this woman but not knowing that this woman is a barren woman her body had been changed can I tell y'all something even though Abraham saw that the outside had been changed Sarah also noticed that the outside had been changed they did not connect the dots the inside had had also been changed before the outside so Abraham sells Sarah out and and Sarah goes along with the plan my God and they go and go down in the city and AMC say I got myself a new wife thank God for this new wife thank you I didn't even have to go look for her you brought her to me Lord God say AMC I know you're righteous man but don't you touch that man's wife amen he said wife the man told me and she said this they were brothers and sisters he said I know what they told you oh glory to God I know exactly what they told you but that is that man's wife give me um Genesis 27 just throw that up there for me oh Hallelujah he say look and he says he said now therefore restore see this restoration right here restore the man his wife right oh my let me tell you the AMC I have to use you and even though he was a righteous man he was playing the part of the devil he took this man's possession and and and and and this is what happens when when you're when you're in in in need of a jubilee God by Grace when you have put yourself in a really bad position you have put yourself where you are left helpless can you imagine Abraham couldn't sleep that night what did I just do I gave my wife to another man how can I do this and there was nothing what he going to do the next day what is Abraham going to do the next day go and go and say uh sir I'm sorry I lied to you she actually my wife that was death that was a death sentence right there was nothing Abraham could do and some of us are in situations just like that ain't nothing we can do sir but when the Jubilee trumpet sounds and you hear it you can go free amen true amen therefore restore the man his wife for he is a prophet I love the way God talks about Abraham he did not call him a liar he called him a prophet did Abraham lie yes he did did Sarah lie yes she did but according to in God's eyes he's not a liar he's a prophet amen and he shall pray for thee and thou shalt live and if thou restore her not know thou that thou shalt surely die thou and all that are thine amen Sarah herself experienced a jubilee amen let me I'm coming home I got to leave I gotta leave why are the people so tossed about let me give you one last quote here Jesus went into the temple no when he picked up the book gave it to him they didn't know what they were doing but when Jesus I I stopped actually reading the scripture there but when Jesus Took the book and he turned it back to Isaiah he read only so much of Isaiah because the rest of it brother brandom say it dealt with the second coming of the Lord so we got to talk about that later on but what I do want to tell you is that when Jesus took that book opened it to Isaiah and begin to read let me just read everything that he read and I'mma I'mma stop right there I just can't go no further go back to verse 18 there in Luke 4 the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord which is the Jubilee year look at this and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister this the part that get me and sat down right it and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fasting on him now he's sitting down and the priest got the book now but their eyes are not on the priest eyes on the man that's sitting down now and look at what happens next and he began to say unto them preaching from his seat oh come on [Music] Amen right preaching from his seat he makes a statement this dayall this scripture is fulfilled now not like not it's going to be fulfilled he made it present tense this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears so those that came to church Hallelujah heard the sound of Jubilee as it came from the Lord Jesus [Applause] himself and brother Brandon say the greatest anointing that had ever been on any man was when Jesus read Isaiah and sat down yeah I'm feel that anointing in here right now I'm going to sit down this is Jubilee year church and I'm telling you if you just be obedient you're going to experience both your overflow and your you believe God bless you church we'll pick it up again amen I got some more that I want to bring out there but we'll pick it up God God knows all amen let's pray father we're grateful for the word of the Lord we're grateful for truth Jesus told is that we would know truth and truth would make us free Lord I believe this Jubilee trumpet is sounding God that uh people might find themselves in all types of situations and circumstances but oh God Grace has been extended amen Grace is upon us let us not make Grace a disgrace but father help us to uh Lord just receive what you're trying to say to us as a prophet tell us Lord when we hear that gospel trumpet sound we don't have to stay in the conditions that we're in we can go free and we don't have to hold on to whatever it is that the devil has us bound to that is a moment we can go free Lord I pray people to experience that freedom that Liberty young people would experience it old people would experience it even if there's something in our heart that we're holding against somebody may this be a time of release amen we don't realize things like that bring sickness upon our body when we hold on to it so I pray God that people would hear the voice of the Lord and go free we don't have to wait 7 years we don't have to wait 50 years we don't have to wait 7 days we don't have to wait 7 minutes we don't have to wait 7 Seconds soon as we hear the gospel trumpet we can go free thank you Jesus thank you Jesus for what you're doing in our hearts we give you glory we give you honor we give you praise it's in Jesus name we pray amen let's
