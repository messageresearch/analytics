Rod Tabernacle, Columbia, South Carolina. Uh Pastor Henry Simmons. Uh also, Brother Joe Underwood reached out to me about a uh event that they're going to be having on August uh 23rd. I believe it's going to be like a um a outreach that they're doing there in their area. Just a a worship service that they're doing as an outreach. And uh they invited us to come. That's going to be August 23rd. I believe it starts at 6:30 uh there in uh Ocala, Florida. So uh I'll get the information. We'll put it on the on the slide there for you. But that's an upcoming event that will be happening. Also, our giving is multiple ways. Those that are online, we have Zel, we have PayPal, we have Cash App. Preferred method is Zel because they don't take fees. But if you have to use PayPal or Cash App, we understand. If you use Zel or PayPal, use giving atj423.org. And if you use cash app, uh, dollar sign spirit t. And our mailing address is the same there. PO Box 222462, West Palm Beach, Florida 33422. those that are in the sanctuary when you're going out or when you're coming in, there is a box on the table as you're leaving the sanctuary. Uh I don't know if it has our church name on it or not, but it's the wooden box that we always use. Uh it's there on the table. Make sure you use that wooden box for Spirit and Truth because if you put it in the box that's on the wall, then it will go to Eagle's Rest. But you want to make sure you use the wooden box on the table for uh the giving for Spirit and Truth tabernacle. All right, let's uh have a word of prayer. We want to remember these saints that are not feeling well. And if you have a request this morning, just signify it by the lifting of your hand. If it's unspoken, we'll remember you as well this morning. Let's pray. Father, we come in the name of Jesus. We thank you for um this privilege we have to come into the house of the Lord. We thank you for this opportunity we have to worship you, Lord, in this new location. You have provided a place for us, oh God, and we're grateful uh for your provision. Father, we ask that you would look upon the saints that are not feeling well. Um God, there there are many that are that that have reported that the enemy attacking their body. Precious wife, Sister Erica, Sister Lois, oh God, and uh many other saints. Oh God, sister capers, God, we just pray that you would just uh move by your spirit upon their bodies and that you would make them completely whole. And if there's anybody else that came to the meetings last week and maybe have gone back home and en enemies attacking them, we come against that devil right now in the name of Jesus. Uh we we proclaim victory because you gave that to us in the meetings, oh God. Father, we ask that you look upon the saints that have their hands lifted showing that they had an unspoken request. you know exactly what's underneath that hand and I ask that you move upon that knee, God, that you would just show yourself strong on their behalf. We're carefully give you the honor and the glory. Bless the offering, Lord, as we partake of it, Father. May you use this for the furtherance of your kingdom here on earth. It's in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. So good to have um this morning, brother Steve uh with us uh from uh UK. Amen. And his precious wife and children. God bless you all. Amen. Good to have you with us. Praise God. Amen. He will uh be ministering for us uh on today. And just a few um housekeeping uh things. So, Sunday morning is really the only morning that we uh we have to have a have to be uh considerate of time because Eagles Rest will be coming in right after us to start their worship service. So, uh just want to ask that um as we when it's time for us to exit that we all exit uh speedily. Uh if there's someone that needs to use the restroom, we do have to clean the restroom before we let the other church in. Uh so if we if we have any that are trying to rush to the restroom, please do that swiftly so that we can clean it and make sure we turn it over really really nice and tidy. Um there's a lot of not not a lot of breakdown little things that we have to break down uh like our cameras we got to get out and all of that and and cable. So brothers if you can just pitch a hand wherever you can that would be helpful. And when we do go outside, um, we we we don't the one thing about this, we don't have to leave the property because in at the school we had to leave the property, get off the property. They were ready to lock up. We don't have to leave the property. We can fellowship on on the outside, but knowing that the other church is coming in, just maybe push our fellowship down the sidewalk a little bit so we give them access uh to the building. Praise the Lord. And I would also just request that when we're parking on uh on Sunday mornings, let's kind of leave some open spots so that church can have some openings when they come in. We don't have to leave them all open, but leave some open spots. Uh if you see my truck, I parked down a little further because we're just trying to give them some space that they can get in here uh for their service. Amen. We thank God for Eagles Rest. We thank them for opening these doors for us and um we we we we're happy to be in this season uh for Spirit and Truth, but we know God got something greater. And uh the one thing I was telling brother Troy is that I want us to remain a little bit uncomfortable because this is not our final resting place. Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. So this morning we will uh prepare to welcome uh brother Steve to the pull pit this morning and I trust that uh and I know he'll be a blessing uh as he has been in the past. So let's stand to our feet. Amen. Let's prepare our hearts to receive the word of the Lord on this day [Music] like me. Oh, I was [Music] Let's say praise God. Praise God. Praise God. [Music] Amen. Praise God for sure. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. is my joy and honor to stand before the purchased blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; It's one thing I rever so much because when you are talking to the purchased blood of Jesus, you are actually touching the eye of the Lord. So I need to tread carefully &gt;&gt; lest I hit myself some kind of trouble. &gt;&gt; But all the same, I'm happy to be here this morning. I greet you all in the wonderful name of our Lord Jesus Christ who is the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; It's good to be associated with my friends. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise be to God. What beautiful singing. Wow. Uh let me say I'm a man who wants to give flowers to somebody when he's still alive. I don't want to carry my flowers on a grave and say you are so much a good person. &gt;&gt; Let me say these few words. You have a Godgiven pastor. Hallelujah. The governments and the pew as well. I look at the way he does things. It really touches my heart. I'm not saying this because he's standing there. &gt;&gt; I will say this even when I'm in London. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When you are given a good pastor, it means there is another shadow behind. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A man is called by his wife. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We also want to thank sister Erica for standing shoulderto-shoulder with our precious pastor, brother Jack D. I'll tell you, you'll never get lost. Even per adventure, he becomes blind, which he's not going to be blind, &gt;&gt; but he'll still be leading you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We thank God for this. &gt;&gt; I'm happy to stand before you. &gt;&gt; As I have, as I have always said, I'm part and parcel of this church. &gt;&gt; I love you from the depth of my heart. &gt;&gt; Uh you are all my friends. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I was thinking two days ago when the pastor said, "Can you come and speak?" I said that's the right word to use. &gt;&gt; I'm not coming to preach. &gt;&gt; I'm coming to speak to the converted already. &gt;&gt; I'm coming to encourage them. &gt;&gt; I'm coming to say put your hand together with mine. &gt;&gt; Let's soldier on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know these words, especially when I'm reading the Bible, when I come to a word, I analyze it seven times before I move on. &gt;&gt; God does not write has not written these words just for not. &gt;&gt; He has written them for us to understand &gt;&gt; and apply them upon our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Before I'm taken over, let me just take a word of prayer. Precious Lord, thou art the Alpha and the Omega, the firstborn of every creation. Father, we thank you this morning for your grace and mercy that has brought us to this place once more. Lord, we have made us to claim it in the name of Jesus Christ. Father, you have not just given us this place as a temporary measure, but from the depths of my heart. Lord, I believe there's a purpose for the eagles to gather in this place to anoint it. Oh God, &gt;&gt; that the anointing can spread. Oh dear God, like you said in Psalms 133, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together. It is like the oil that is put upon the head of Aaron that runs down through his face, through his beard, even unto his garments. Father, this garment of love, we are spreading it over, Lord God Almighty, to the inhabitants of this church and we claim them in the name of Jesus Christ. Lord, we know you have your own ways and we know Lord God Almighty, you act according to your own time. Let it be established in heaven &gt;&gt; even on this earth. Thus this day we have claimed this church. Oh dear God. &gt;&gt; Oh father we thank you Lord. I'm standing before your purchased blood. &gt;&gt; Heavenly father Lord God almighty. May you take me aside. Anoint these lips of clay until they can profess the oracles of heaven. May you speak to the hearts of your people. until they are convinced. Oh God, until they can say we want to go down and look for our own Goliath. My father, my savior, I thank you Lord God Almighty. Forgive me of all my mistakes, dear God. Father, may you anoint this little thought that I have this morning and may it be a blessing upon your people in Jesus name we pray and believe. Amen. God bless you. Let me just take off my jacket. I was actually thinking what am I going to share and speak to the church of the living God. I looked back at the meetings. I looked back on Friday. All these messages were coming to uplift &gt;&gt; and to give victory to the children of God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Then I said, Satan, I'm not going to spare you as well. &gt;&gt; I'm coming with a bomb. &gt;&gt; And this bomb is now the atomic bomb &gt;&gt; just to finish you off &gt;&gt; and set the church of God at liberty. My brother, my sister, &gt;&gt; the little thought that I have is something to equip you, something to to put your hands on, something to say and turn back and say, "On this Sunday, this message was preached. It has given me hope and encouragement to go into the enemy's camp and discomfort and defeat the devil." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All right. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Today I've got a little sermon. &gt;&gt; Not that I'm restricted to time, but if I give it in too much measure, you might lose the the nuggets of it. I've just given a short and packaged message that whenever you are when you pull one the devil will be scared and you run away. &gt;&gt; Without wasting much of your time, let's get to my scripture readings for the day. 1 Samuel chapter 30 verses 1-2 and we are going to get to verse eight. I was jumping some verses for the purposes of time. Right. The Bible says, "And it came to pass when David and his men were come to Ziklak." &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister, I want you to take note of the names that God is going to use in these scriptures. &gt;&gt; Number one is Ziklag. I'm going to give a definition of what Ziglag is all about. And his men were come to Ziglac on the third day that the Amalachites had invaded the south and Ziglak and Smitt and Ziglak and burned it with fire &gt;&gt; and had taken the women captives. Hallelujah. That were within. If you want to provoke me, my brother, my sister, take my wife &gt;&gt; and you'll see how tall I am. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and had taken the women captives that were with therein. They slew not any, either great or small, but carried them away and went on their way. &gt;&gt; My verse 80 says, "And David inquired at the Lord, saying, shall I pursue after this troop?" My brother, let me tell you one thing. Before you do anything in your life, whether it be small or big, you must go back to God and say, "Lord, shall I do this or not?" &gt;&gt; Although in your eyes you might be seeing it as a very good thing, but it is of importance to go back to God and say, "Lord, shall I do this or not?" This is what David did. He asked God, "Shall I pursue after this troop?" Despite in his heart, he knew his wife had been taken as well. But he had the audacity to go back to God and say, "Lord, shall I pursue? Shall I overtake them?" And he answered him, &gt;&gt; "Pursue, &gt;&gt; for thou shalt surely overtake them, &gt;&gt; and without fail &gt;&gt; recover all." &gt;&gt; Recover all. &gt;&gt; Not a little bit, &gt;&gt; but recover all. &gt;&gt; Verse 18, it says, "And David recovered all that the Amalachites had carried away. And David rescued his two wives. &gt;&gt; And there was nothing lacking to them. Neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil nor anything that they had taken to them. David recovered all. &gt;&gt; My second scripture reading Joshua 1 verse 8-9. This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein. For then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There is a common denominator in verse eight. In order for you to have good success, don't let this word depart out of thy mouth. &gt;&gt; You must meditate there day in day and night. &gt;&gt; Wherever you are, my brother, my sister, you might be lacking in scriptures, but it is good to sing a psalm. &gt;&gt; Just to sing a psalm to your God to show your position with the words. &gt;&gt; Have not I commanded thee? It is a question mark. Maybe something had happened. God is coming back to Joshua and say, "Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of good courage? Be not afraid? &gt;&gt; Neither be thou dismayed, for the Lord thy God is with thee, whether thousoever thou goest." &gt;&gt; Wherever you are going to go, &gt;&gt; God will be with you. For he has proclaimed in his word, I will be with you even unto the end of the world. &gt;&gt; Oh king, &gt;&gt; what is it that you are scared of? &gt;&gt; When our God has given us an assurance, I will be with you whether thou goest ever. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; We don't want to limit ourselves. The scriptures are there to be us &gt;&gt; to say wherever you are going to go, wherever you're going to put your foot, wherever you're going to put your hand, the Lord will be with you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Precious father, we have read your word. Lord, may you come down and anoint it. We give glory. We give honor unto thee. In the wonderful name of our Lord Jesus Christ, we pray and believe. Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. My my my my my &gt;&gt; praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Today my title is season recover. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Season recover all. &gt;&gt; If you have lost a button, it's now time to say I want my button back. If you have lost a penny, it's now time to say, "I need my penny." If you have lost a job, you must say, "I need a job, but with a bit of a promotion on it." If you have lost a househ, you must now start to say, "I need my house." If you have lost your children, you must now start to say, "I need my children back." If you have lost a business, you must now start to say, "I need my business back." is sevenfold. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's time to claim to claim all my brother, my sister. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's a season. What is a season? A season comes with a certain package. Hallelujah. Every season has got a package. Remember the man at the at the ba? Hallelujah. There it was a season and when the season came when people were supposed to jump into the water because he was a lame man for 38 years others would quickly jump and take his place and he would say oh my lord why have you forsaken me? But when the owner of the season one day he visited that pool and when he visited that pool he looked at everybody with ailments and the man that was bad written and per adventure he stood besides him and he said let me just stand and ask this man hallelujah and he said what is your problem my brother he said for all the 30 years I've come to this pool with intention of jumping in but everybody Everybody takes time. Everybody takes the ability and time before I jump in. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister, &gt;&gt; if he knew whom he was talking to, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He would have just said, "Lord, &gt;&gt; help me. &gt;&gt; My God." &gt;&gt; Because he the Lord Jesus Christ, he did not see much faith in that man. &gt;&gt; Then he said, "Stand up and take your bed and go home. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This man, my brother, recovered you all. &gt;&gt; He had plans. &gt;&gt; And when he stood up, he said, "The first thing that I'm going to do is to rebuild my house. The first thing that I'm going to do is to buy myself a car. The first thing that I'm going to do is to see that I recover everything that I've lost within the 38 years." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. My brother, it is your time. &gt;&gt; Don't take this message as a small thing. &gt;&gt; It is the capping message that the spirit and truth must adopt from this day. &gt;&gt; Yes, I'll be traveling to England. But remember this message that I'm preaching to you. It is a message that is known as season recover all. Let's just let's just uh take a look at what the word recovery means. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Recovery is a dynamic process of change characterized by improvements. Hallelujah. In health, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Social functioning my brother. as well as increases &gt;&gt; in wellbeing &gt;&gt; and purpose in life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To find or regain possession of something lost or stolen &gt;&gt; who has stolen your things, it is none other than the devil. &gt;&gt; Maybe have lost it yourself, but you are saying, "Satan, I'm bringing it in your face. You are the one who made me to lose this. But I'm coming all the volume of the book upon the strength of the spoken word to recover everything. And by recovering, I I am improving my health. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you've got a healthy issue this afternoon, &gt;&gt; my brother, it is a now gone thing. &gt;&gt; Social functioning. You got to end social function. People look at you up and down as if you are smelling. You are a child of God. You are a child of God. There has to be an improvement. Hallelujah. In your social functioning, even at workplaces, where you work, even at university, even at schools, my brother, my sister, you need to have an aura. &gt;&gt; An aura where people just like to be near you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It never should end there, my brother, my sister. &gt;&gt; There has to be an increase. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In your wellbeing &gt;&gt; and purpose in life. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you were being looked down. Sometimes people were saying, "Ah, what can come out of this person is nothing." But when God comes into the recovery program and uplifts you and anoint you, then you can hear your boss say, "Let's hear from this sister. She has never spoken for a long time. Let's hear her input." And when you stand to give your input, my brother, that helps the company to develop. Everybody's going to clap hands to say, "Where were you all this time? We were looking for you. You should have spoken long back. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You are going to find or to regain possession of something lost or stolen. &gt;&gt; I bring it to you my brother, my sister, &gt;&gt; this is the season. &gt;&gt; When the season comes for trees to lose their leaves, &gt;&gt; they drop the leaves. &gt;&gt; And one can look at a tree and say, "Oh my, I feel pity for this tree. My brother, my sister, that tree needs to lose those trees in order for it to gain new leaves that will produce possibly 10 times more fruits. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my, I'm enjoying myself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I love this prophet, my brother, my sister. &gt;&gt; As I'm saying, my thought this morning is going to be centered on the above explanation. Why am I saying so my brother, my sister? Our prophet brother Brana teaches us that we were designed to be overcomers. &gt;&gt; We were designed to be overcomers. &gt;&gt; And don't look yourself down wherever you are. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't look down upon yourself wherever you are. Even if when you're going to an interview and you know that there are so many challenges, put your hand in your pocket and say, I've already got this job. &gt;&gt; Put it to God's &gt;&gt; and you say to God, Lord, this is my intention and I'm being bagged it up with your word. I am going to get this job although I am actually having a competition with executive people. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Never look down upon yourself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You are competing with the chief executives &gt;&gt; and you are going there as a non entity. &gt;&gt; The moment you present yourself the moment they see your face. They are not physically seeing your face but they are seeing Jesus face. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Brother, my prophet, brother Brana, he teaches us that the Bible is God in written form. &gt;&gt; How many knows that God? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is God in written form. But we must be able to extract him out of the pages of the Bible and make him a living word again unto us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We just don't read the Bible as a fairy story. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But we need to extract God out of him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Remember, God does not lie. In Numbers 23:1 19, he said, "God is not a man that he should lie. &gt;&gt; Neither a son of man that he should repent. &gt;&gt; Have you heed and shall he not do it? &gt;&gt; Or have he spoken and shall he not make it good?" Amen. &gt;&gt; So whatever God has promised in his word, he is more than able to back it up this afternoon. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I believe it is the dut of every Christian to consult God like I've said before on anything before you embark on it because his ways are perfect. &gt;&gt; We read in 2 Samuel 22 verse 31 that as for God his way is perfect. The word of the Lord is tried. He is a buckler to them that trust in him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Who is trusting on the Lord this morning? &gt;&gt; Who is trusting on the Lord this morning? &gt;&gt; My brother, I've got good news for you this morning. I am saying to you, when you trust on God, who is a buckler, &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; to everything that you are going to do, you are home and dry. &gt;&gt; Never mind about this cobalt. This code might be written sister so and so, brother so and so zero certain to disregard that. &gt;&gt; We are going into the final dying minutes of the game &gt;&gt; where we are going to introduce those substitutes which we call the super substitutes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That super substitute is coming with the word of God. And when he gets onto the ball, they don't see how he's dribbling. only the way he sees it when he scores the ball. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't worry about the devil. &gt;&gt; The devil has been instructed to do his duty faithfully. &gt;&gt; But let me bring it back to you. My brother, my sister, you are the main actor. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Where have you seen a main actor die in any film? No matter how hard surrounded he is but automatically he will find a way to wiggle out and at the end of the day the main actor will stand as a victor today you are the main actor and forever &gt;&gt; don't worry about what the devil is posting around you don't worry about what he's doing to your children it's on temporal basis my brother if that if the sister of that home kneels down brother Brham tells us matter. God honors and hears more from the prayer of a mother. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'm just trying to provoke you mothers. &gt;&gt; When you see the devil try to creep into your children, &gt;&gt; it is time for you to say, "I have my prayer corner. I am going on my prayer corner." &gt;&gt; Oh, to claim for my children. I'm going on the prayer corner to say, Satan, you are a liar. My brother, my sister, the devil is a liar. &gt;&gt; The devil is a liar. &gt;&gt; When you go on your prayer corner and you start to plead before God to say, "Lord, I dedicated this child in your name. &gt;&gt; This child was baptized in your name. &gt;&gt; This child received the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your name." &gt;&gt; What then is going in his life? My brother, the moment you say that &gt;&gt; and you go on your prayer corner and you cry before God, God is more than able to hear you than a minister who is on the desk preaching. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It is good to be a Christian. &gt;&gt; It is good to be a Christian, my brother, my sister. Here we read in first Samuel. Hallelujah. We are looking at season recover all. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Seize and recover all. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm just going to dramatize a little bit and give you a bit of an example. Here we see. I want you to follow our first scripture reading &gt;&gt; concerning David. &gt;&gt; Remember I said the name Zlag. &gt;&gt; God does not just put names for not. Here we see David. He was a servant of God. &gt;&gt; He was a man after God's own heart. coming back to the city which king Akish Akish was a Philistine &gt;&gt; Akish had granted David he had granted him refuge &gt;&gt; when he was fleeing from Saul &gt;&gt; look at it my brother my sister &gt;&gt; here is a Philistine &gt;&gt; giving David a city of refuge &gt;&gt; to hide away from Saul Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's see what Ziglag is all about. Symbolically, some interpretations. They view Ziklag as a symbol of God's faithfulness and the unfolding of his plans for David's kingdom. Even in a period of waiting and testing, &gt;&gt; David was in a period of waiting and testing to become the next king. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Remember it was two days. Hallelujah. After retaining from this victory of Ziglak that David received news of the death of Saul in a battle leading that led to his eventual rise to the throne. &gt;&gt; Now I want to bring it back home. You are living in America. But to me, America is representing Ziglag. &gt;&gt; Ziglag is a period of waiting and testing for you. &gt;&gt; It's a country for you. You are waiting to be tested and adopt your what? Hallelujah. to adopt all the things that we have lost as much as David did. &gt;&gt; David had been running away from Saul for so many years &gt;&gt; until a Philistine said, "I'll give you a city, a refuge city called Zlak. &gt;&gt; Come and stay there and no one will touch you." &gt;&gt; But David was waiting. David was waiting to assume his kingship &gt;&gt; when Saul had died. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When he was coming from the victory of Zlak, this is when he received news of the death of Saul &gt;&gt; and that's when he became king. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; America is representing Ziklak. God is waiting for your time to rise in power. &gt;&gt; All you need to do is go back to the enemy's camp. &gt;&gt; As much as David was doing, &gt;&gt; David was fighting Israel's enemies when he was in a foreign land given to him by a Philistine. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God w his wars in from Zackland. a city given to him by an an a king called Akish, a Philistine. &gt;&gt; They even persuaded him. And he wanted to go with Akish to fight the enemies of Akish. &gt;&gt; Then certain individuals say, "No, no, no, no, no, no. Look here. This man is a Hebrew. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He might turn against us. &gt;&gt; Let him remain behind." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and they all agreed and say you remain behind. &gt;&gt; So what I'm saying to you my brother this afternoon is all you need to do is to go back to the enemy's camp and fight. Get what the devil stole from you. Be on the offensive this morning. &gt;&gt; Don't leave endstone unturned. You'll soon realize, hallelujah, your rise to power against the devil. Brother, &gt;&gt; this is not our homeland. &gt;&gt; Ours is &gt;&gt; yonder. &gt;&gt; But what you need to do, my brother, my sister, is to show your power &gt;&gt; when God is with you. &gt;&gt; To show your power and have your own testimony. &gt;&gt; Tell the devil is not going to be over until you win. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Adopt the stance that I had when I was a young boy. I never gave up on anybody who wanted to fight me. &gt;&gt; They were taking advantage of my heart. But when I fought, I fought like a bull. &gt;&gt; I was charging like a bull. If the fight never ended on that day, I would wake up the next morning and go to that person and knock on the door. And when he opened the door, I'll say, "Let's continue from where I last met." I will say let's continue from where we left from yesterday until I win. This is when I will declare it's over. &gt;&gt; I purposed in my life to say even if I lose my teeth, I will use my gum to bite. &gt;&gt; This is the same attitude that I want you to develop towards the devil. The devil is your enemy, my brother, my sister. You should say, Satan, I've had enough of you. &gt;&gt; I am coming to you in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Be like David of old. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How many Davids do I have in here this afternoon? &gt;&gt; My brother, God is the one who ordains the food of the righteous. David one day he went to see what to give his brother some food but that was not the righteous intention. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When he went there he came there and he said I've brought you some food but his eyes was not on the food. His eyes were on the enemy of the Israel. And he had a big man &gt;&gt; crawling like a lion &gt;&gt; despising the Jews &gt;&gt; and he looked at his brothers. These brothers were already trembling and he said who is that uncircumcised Philistine. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he said I feel righteous now. &gt;&gt; And he said God has guarded himself when I was heading the the sheep of my father. A bear come and he took one and I went after it. A lion came and took one and I went after it. And he said, "This testimonies, &gt;&gt; these testimonies will make a way for another testimony." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How many testimonies have you had in this church? &gt;&gt; How many testimonies have you had in this church? You take advantage of that testimony and say, "Lord, if you can do to that sister, you are more than able to do it on me as well." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When David went there, he started to devel some goose pimples and he was saying, "How can the Israelites keep quiet when this man is actually scolding the Jews?" &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Brother, sometimes we are a mixed group. Sometimes we are a mixed group as much as Moses group was. &gt;&gt; Let me just pass through some when we are a mixed group. I'm I'm directing this to the youths. &gt;&gt; You get involved with a lot of youths from other churches. &gt;&gt; Other churches. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. At the churches, &gt;&gt; they have their own doctrine, their way of looking at the scripture, their way of believing the message. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Wake up, spirit and truth youth. &gt;&gt; You'll be invited. You are drinking lemonade. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Ah, &gt;&gt; why don't you top it up with a little bit of alcohol? The Bible said you can drink but don't get drunk. &gt;&gt; Where have you seen beer &gt;&gt; not making you drunk? &gt;&gt; You are written epistles. Read of all men. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Written epistles. Read of all men. When you hear those news, turn your back and say the cross before me, the devil the world behind me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister, &gt;&gt; is not all who say Lord, Lord will enter the kingdom of heaven. &gt;&gt; There are some people, &gt;&gt; some wolves who are going to come in sheep skin. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They want to take you off the message. Be very careful, my brother, my sister. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm directing this especially to the youth. No wonder why when Job saw his children going to party, he would go and kneel and pray, &gt;&gt; intercede for his children and say per adventure they sin against thee. Lord have mercy upon. &gt;&gt; Parents, &gt;&gt; you have a duty &gt;&gt; to pray for your children. Despite that they have received the baptism of the Holy Ghost, they can get lost. &gt;&gt; When David saw Goliath, he said he's a good he's a good target, big as he is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "I don't need a gun. I don't I just need five stones of faith." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me tell you one thing. David picked up five stones. Maybe one of the stones that David picked had already been used by somebody and he tried to shoot a bed and he missed. &gt;&gt; But when it came into the hands of David, &gt;&gt; the anointed hand, &gt;&gt; it changed every situation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me bring it down to you. &gt;&gt; You are the anointed &gt;&gt; at the end times. &gt;&gt; Whatever you touch &gt;&gt; becomes righteous. &gt;&gt; Whatever you wish &gt;&gt; becomes righteous. &gt;&gt; Whatever you claim &gt;&gt; becomes righteous. David took five stones &gt;&gt; and he said, "Lo, and behold, Goliath, here I come." But Saul said, "No, no, no, no, no, no. Come here. Let me give you a uniform." &gt;&gt; Maybe David was given the the Anglican uniform, the blue and white. &gt;&gt; He tried to walk, he couldn't walk. They said, "Okay, try the Methodist one, the red and black. He tried to walk, he couldn't. Then let's say, oh, let's bring the mother of all, the Roman Catholic God. Do you want a caller? They put the caller. David's head went down like this. He said, take off these things. They are draining my power. &gt;&gt; Then he said, let me walk in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Then he said to the Goliath, Goliath, do you see where I am? &gt;&gt; Then Goliath said, I see a little boy. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. My brother, you might have been despised in any situation, but the here comes your time of opportunity. Hallelujah. They might have despised you to say you are a Christian. You believe in brother Brham, he's a false man. &gt;&gt; He's a false he's a false prophet. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; My brother, the moment they start to scold my prophet, &gt;&gt; I feel pity for them &gt;&gt; because I remember the sister. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. who stood for the prophet &gt;&gt; that sister had cancer &gt;&gt; but he was debating with publicans and the publicans were saying that prophet is preaching he's preaching nonsense and this and that we don't believe then she said although I am sick that prophet is a god vindicated prophet &gt;&gt; rather bram had been told to tell that sister to organize a life because her life was going to end &gt;&gt; but an angel was sent and told to the sister that because you stood &gt;&gt; for my word, I am going to stand for you. The cancer is gone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatever ailment you have this afternoon, &gt;&gt; be it diabetes, be it blood pressure, be it cancer, be it a headache, be it whatsoever, my brother, it is gone in the name of Jesus because you are standing for the word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Remember I said my title is season recover. If you have lost a button, it's time for you to get your button. &gt;&gt; A penny, time for you to reclaim it. &gt;&gt; Whatsoever, my brother, my sister, I want you to declare this afternoon. Whatsoever you want in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother, when you declare it, put it in the Bible. your bless of any scripture you put it there and every time. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Every time open your Bible, look at what you have declared. speak to your God &gt;&gt; to say, Lord, if that short man who came to preach to us is a liar, so let me not have my &gt;&gt; blessing. But if you are standing on the basis of the word, let me have my blessing &gt;&gt; right now. My brother, it can take one day. It can take two days. It can take a week. It can take a month. But God's word does not lie. &gt;&gt; I have seen it working. &gt;&gt; I have seen it working in my personal life. &gt;&gt; I have seen it working in other people's lives. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When David saw the man He said, "Now Goliath, this is the end of your life." He took his ling and he said, "Lord, may you finish the job." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it went tumbling. And Goliath was just a huge man. Then the stone came and was directed to his forehead and he fell down. Let me say every country has got its own territorial demons. &gt;&gt; Her adventure. The territorial demon of this place is something else. I'll speak about my country. The territorial demon of my country back in England is of much of gay. Right now we are witnessing men with pink hair, short skirts. They are no longer scared. They walk in the streets panthering with a handbag. You look at him. That's the most disgusting That's the demon that has crept England &gt;&gt; because they have accepted it in our society. &gt;&gt; The politicians have accepted it &gt;&gt; because they want votes. Amen. &gt;&gt; But I say to you, my brother, even when that demon, if that demon is slaughtered the way Goliath was slaughtered, all the little demons will start to flee away. &gt;&gt; No wonder why the following morning, every little boy stood up and said, "I am going to look for my own Goliath." They were on the hunt of Goliath now because the main demon had been slaughtered. &gt;&gt; This can happen in this country my brother. &gt;&gt; If the main demon if you slaughter the main demon &gt;&gt; from cover to cover my brother, you can go out with your children and say we are looking for demons. &gt;&gt; We want to deal with them. &gt;&gt; People when you meet up people they say what are you looking for? You'll say I'm looking for demons. They'll say are you crazy? I said, "No, I'm looking for demons." Are you one of them? Because I can cast the demon out of you. &gt;&gt; You have the power. &gt;&gt; You have the authority &gt;&gt; because you are a son and daughter of God. He that's in you is greater than he that is in the world. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Let me not divert much from my my scriptures. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I am saying remember the strategic importance of Ziklak. David used Ziklak as a base to launch raids and against Israel. You can still use America to launch raids. Hallelujah. which have bothered you. Hallelujah. To launch raise against your enemies. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. By so doing, you are strengthening your position &gt;&gt; and your resources. &gt;&gt; Remember, you can defeat the devil anytime, &gt;&gt; any place, &gt;&gt; anywhere. Be it in water, be it on the surface or airborne, you still can defeat him. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now it is time for you, my brother, my sister, &gt;&gt; to stop living under privilege. &gt;&gt; You must stop living under privilege. &gt;&gt; You must stop living under privilege. &gt;&gt; God, when God asks us to do something, he equip us. &gt;&gt; He equips us. Give me quotation 56081. The hour of God's delivery shot from a bone. Hallelujah. God sent the baptism of the Holy Ghost and put it in the hands of the church. The hour of God's deliverance to deliver from sickness. &gt;&gt; Are we reading together? Yes. &gt;&gt; To deliver you from sickness, &gt;&gt; from sin, from worry, &gt;&gt; from trouble, from worldliness. &gt;&gt; You can just have a mind of just thinking about the world. I wish I could win the lottery. &gt;&gt; I wish I could win this. &gt;&gt; I wish that's a worldliness mind. God can grant you those things &gt;&gt; without even going into those dirty things &gt;&gt; if he's able to deliver you from sneakness &gt;&gt; and from sin &gt;&gt; and from worry. &gt;&gt; I find a lot of message believers always worrying. &gt;&gt; I am worried. &gt;&gt; I'm worried about my headache. Oh, you're now personalizing your headache. I &gt;&gt; I'm worried about this. I'm worried. A wondering mind. Why should you get worried? &gt;&gt; When you became a message believer, it meant that you're supposed to be at ease and relax. &gt;&gt; You have surrendered your life into the hands of what? God. &gt;&gt; And you say, "God, if you take my life or don't take my life, I don't care." &gt;&gt; And also, I did not volunteer to become a Christian. It was through your love that you you projected towards me &gt;&gt; and I accepted it. &gt;&gt; You filled me with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are worried about trouble. &gt;&gt; Ah, I left the kettle on at work. I don't know whether I find the whole place in in in in trles. God can command his angel to go and switch off that kettle during the night. Amen. &gt;&gt; But we have struck short of it despite God telling us and assuring us all these things through his prophet. But we have we have struck short of it. Why have we struck short of it? Give me another quotation. The next one. Why have we struck it short? Because the word has departed out of our mouths. Joshua tells us, "This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth." &gt;&gt; The moment you come out of Israel, you'll never prosper. &gt;&gt; Come back to the word &gt;&gt; and God can start to prosper you. &gt;&gt; But thou shalt meditate there in day and night. &gt;&gt; We have put all our Bibles in the shelves and they've gathered dust. We have put all our message books in the shelf and they've gathered dust &gt;&gt; and we expect God to &gt;&gt; prosper you, &gt;&gt; that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written. Then for then shall for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success. &gt;&gt; Only if you come back to the word Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Meditate there in the word of God day and night. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's not run away from the Bible. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The Bible teaches us that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's no more time to live under privilege. If we apply the token, &gt;&gt; if we apply the token, we can speak things into existence. &gt;&gt; Speak things out of existence because we are a living Bible. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Next slide. A total deliverance. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All Jesus works was complete. Everything was complete. Total delivered. I love this prophet. He totally delivered the leper from lepros. He totally delivered the woman with the blood issue. from your issue. What issue do you have this morning &gt;&gt; that God cannot tackle? If he could actually deliver the woman of the blood issue, she had been suffering for almost 12 years. Blood is wherever she goes, all the flies were following her. Wherever she was, people were despising her. People were running away from her. But she was determined one day and she said enough is enough. &gt;&gt; She said if only I can hold the hem of a his garment. &gt;&gt; A determination. &gt;&gt; Sometimes my brother you need to adopt an arrogant faith. &gt;&gt; An arrogant faith &gt;&gt; to say when you're just about to do things the devil ask you why are you doing this? And you say, "So what?" &gt;&gt; You need to speak back to the devil. &gt;&gt; God spoke back to the devils &gt;&gt; when they pleaded with him to say, "Please don't cast us away. Maybe cast us into those pigs that are there. It's not yet our time. If God can speak to the devil, &gt;&gt; you are a little god on this earth &gt;&gt; because deity has come upon us. &gt;&gt; Whatever you say, whatever you bind on this earth, it shall be bound in heaven. &gt;&gt; Whatever you wish, it shall be done. &gt;&gt; Amen. He totally delivered the world from sin when he died in the day of the atonement. He totally delivered every sin. He delivered the church. So there's no need for us to live under privilege. &gt;&gt; There it is, my brother. &gt;&gt; People, there's no need for us to live in a defeated state &gt;&gt; because he defeated the devil and took all the principalities and powers. Satan was pruned &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; from all the powers and subdued under his feet. &gt;&gt; No wonder Joshua when the walls of Jericho crumbled. There were five kings there and he took them and he hid them in a cave. He said, "I'll deal with them later." They did everything that they wanted to do. After that, then he said, "Now open the cave. Bring those five kings." And they were lined up. And Joshua took his foot and put on the neck. &gt;&gt; He said, "Go back to where you belong." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is what you should do to the devil. &gt;&gt; Put your foot on the neck. &gt;&gt; And you say, "Poverty, &gt;&gt; you are gone. &gt;&gt; Poverty, &gt;&gt; you are gone. &gt;&gt; Sickness, &gt;&gt; you are gone. &gt;&gt; Satan, &gt;&gt; put your hands off my children. Amen. &gt;&gt; You are gone. &gt;&gt; Because they have got no legal right to rule over you. &gt;&gt; We are Christians filled with the Holy Ghost. [Music] &gt;&gt; It's not a small thing, my brother, my sister. To be filled with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is God. &gt;&gt; In the beginning was the word. &gt;&gt; The word was God. The word was with God. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister, when you adopt such faith, there's got to be a time when you've got to separate yourself. &gt;&gt; You must separate yourself between your feelings &gt;&gt; and your faith. &gt;&gt; Can I hear an amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; Separate yourself between your feelings and your faith. &gt;&gt; And this is the time that we need to do that &gt;&gt; because there are times when Satan puts the heat on us and we have to stop and check and ask God, Lord, do I really believe you? &gt;&gt; You need to check yourself. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Do I really believe in you, Lord? Because by then you are trying to say I'm ready to seal my testimony with my own life. You must defy the devil. &gt;&gt; Defy the devil. My brother, my sister, &gt;&gt; look at Mach Shadrach and Abednego. &gt;&gt; They said our God is able to deliver us &gt;&gt; from this fairy furnace. The king wanted to burn that religion out of them. Imagine. And that's what the devil always tries to do to all of us all the time. Tries to b you up. Hallelujah. Something b you up on something make you seeker when you have been prayed for. Imagine you have been prayed for but you become more seeker. He tries to make you think you've lost your experience with God. &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister, he is a lie. &gt;&gt; When David said, "I've lost the joy of my salvation." &gt;&gt; He had not lost his salvation. &gt;&gt; He had just lost the &gt;&gt; the joy. &gt;&gt; You might lose your joy, &gt;&gt; but you must quickly come back to God and say, "I have lost the joy of my salvation. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Shadrach, they turned their backs on the image and they said, "Our God is more than able &gt;&gt; to fight for us." &gt;&gt; This morning, my brother, if you mean it from the depth of your heart, &gt;&gt; and say, "Satan, I know what you've been trying to do in my own life. in the life of my husband, &gt;&gt; in the life of my children, &gt;&gt; but I'm turning my back on you. &gt;&gt; You do whatsoever you want. &gt;&gt; But what's before me is the cross of Calvary. &gt;&gt; What's behind me is the worldly things. &gt;&gt; You have to be determined. &gt;&gt; You have to be determined, my brother. &gt;&gt; When they did that, these children were being led by a spear. Unless they want to come back, they will be pricricked. &gt;&gt; And the people say move. And when they were moving, Shadrech said, "Let me check on my brother." He said, "Abet, are you sure? Are you determined we are going?" Abed said, "I I'm prayed up, my brother, and I'm determined." Mach, are you ready? He said, "As long as I'm with you, my brothers, I'm determined." And they walked and they walked and they walked until they went into the very furnace. On that day, a wonder happened. &gt;&gt; The flames of the natural fire were turned into a shed where Mishek Shad and Aed Migo were relaxing under the shadow of the burning flames. &gt;&gt; This morning, &gt;&gt; all your burdens All your burdens, my brother, my sister, &gt;&gt; can be a shed &gt;&gt; while you are putting your legs on top of your possessions. &gt;&gt; That's how God can do my brother, my sister. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If Moses said, "Not even a wolf shall remain." &gt;&gt; Think deep, my brother, my sister. Moses is referring to an animal with a spirit without a soul. &gt;&gt; He is saying not even a wolf will remain behind. &gt;&gt; What about you, my brother, my sister? &gt;&gt; You are a Holy Ghost filled son and daughter of God &gt;&gt; with a living soul. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How then can you not make it? Amen. &gt;&gt; How then can you not go into the enemy's camp &gt;&gt; and get all what the stab has taken away from you? &gt;&gt; Not even a wolf shall remain. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; When do you want to go? Now &gt;&gt; Moses, you can leave a few men to look after. He said no way. &gt;&gt; We are taking our old. &gt;&gt; We are taking our young. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are taking everything that belongs to us &gt;&gt; and we are going with it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is that your determination this afternoon? &gt;&gt; Parents, are is that your determination this afternoon? &gt;&gt; You are going with your children. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You are going with your old. &gt;&gt; You are going with your husbands. &gt;&gt; You are going with your wives. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. children. You might go out there and be mischievous, &gt;&gt; but your parents have already your parents have already, let me emphasize, your parents have already prayed for you, &gt;&gt; Billy. Paul, &gt;&gt; stand there. &gt;&gt; Spread your arms. &gt;&gt; What does it represent? A cross. &gt;&gt; Make your decision. You at Cadeshia Banner &gt;&gt; take the road &gt;&gt; that if you despise &gt;&gt; but don't worry. &gt;&gt; I have already prayed for you. &gt;&gt; If you are going to get into heaven with one eye, so be it. &gt;&gt; If you're going to get to heaven with one leg, so be it. &gt;&gt; If you're going to get to heaven with one arm, so be it. Why? &gt;&gt; Because a son &gt;&gt; always a son. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are going with everything. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Not even a wolf is remaining behind. &gt;&gt; What about you son and daughter of God, brother? In the millennium, they won't be making no one will be making babies. &gt;&gt; In the millennium, it's time to talk about the triumphs that you have done. &gt;&gt; You will be enjoying. So this time, it is the time for us to make our own testimonies. You are so much privileged because already you have got one testimony for you to accept this message is a testimony. &gt;&gt; But go out there and claim and recover everything that the devil has stolen from you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Go out there and recover what the devil has stolen from you. Are we together my brother, my sister? &gt;&gt; Go out there. &gt;&gt; What are you recovering? &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; remember recover means it's a dynamic process &gt;&gt; of change &gt;&gt; characterized by improvements. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. improvements in your health. &gt;&gt; It's no longer time to say, "I've got a perennial headache. Oh, I don't have money." Oh, this and that. That language is gone. Now, &gt;&gt; we are now walking into another language. &gt;&gt; I have everything. &gt;&gt; Let the poor say, "I am rich." &gt;&gt; Let the sick say, "I am where." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The only time that you should say you don't have money is when you have got 3,000 in your pocket. &gt;&gt; That's when you must say, I you know, I don't have enough money. Then people say, how much do you have? I only got a bit of a change of $3,000 &gt;&gt; and you walk away. &gt;&gt; That person will come to you and say, "Ah, so how much do you want?" You tell them according to the Bible it says I must lend nations. &gt;&gt; You must lend the bank of America. &gt;&gt; Because everything good belongs to you. &gt;&gt; You are a son and daughter of God. &gt;&gt; But how do you claim those things? My brother, my sister, is to go to the enemy's camp. &gt;&gt; Be on the offensive and Satan and tell Satan, "Get this back from me. &gt;&gt; This one is my one. This one is my one. &gt;&gt; That's my health. That's my money. That's my business. Oh, that's everything. Claim everything. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, spirit and truth tabernacle. I want to leave you with a scripture. &gt;&gt; I don't even know whether it's on my slides. It's Isaiah 54:E1 17. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; When you want to think about me, &gt;&gt; reach that that scripture. No weapon &gt;&gt; that is formed against you &gt;&gt; shall prosper &gt;&gt; and every tongue &gt;&gt; that shall rise against you &gt;&gt; in judgment &gt;&gt; thou shalt condemn. &gt;&gt; This is your inheritage &gt;&gt; because you are a servant of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. and the righteousness is of me, sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; No weapon that is formed against thee. &gt;&gt; That statement is not saying a weapon is not going to be formed against you. &gt;&gt; A weapon will be formed against you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But that weapon &gt;&gt; shall not prosper &gt;&gt; because it's coming &gt;&gt; against a 2010 wall &gt;&gt; which is filled with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Do you hear me? Truth and trouble. &gt;&gt; No weapon &gt;&gt; that is formed against thee &gt;&gt; shall prosper. Brother Jaf, &gt;&gt; no weapon &gt;&gt; that is formed against you shall prosper &gt;&gt; and every time &gt;&gt; every tongue &gt;&gt; every time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You must contain it. &gt;&gt; Because you are a Holy Ghost fililled person. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; No weapon. No weapon, &gt;&gt; no weapon &gt;&gt; that is formed against the &gt;&gt; shall prosper. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And every tongue &gt;&gt; that speaks evil about you, &gt;&gt; condemn me to the pits of hell, &gt;&gt; condemn me to the pits of hell. &gt;&gt; Tell the devil this afternoon, &gt;&gt; I've gone to the enemy's camp &gt;&gt; and I've took everything. My health has been restored. &gt;&gt; My money has been restored. &gt;&gt; My children have been restored. &gt;&gt; I I continuously speak about children. &gt;&gt; My brother, &gt;&gt; what joy will it give me? &gt;&gt; If when you go yonder, &gt;&gt; I am found standing with my wife only. &gt;&gt; My wife only. &gt;&gt; Where are the fruits of them? Do you think I'll be happy there? &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The Lord allowed brother Steve to have an experience of going to the other side. &gt;&gt; And um when he went to the other side, he was able to look back and see his family &gt;&gt; and he saw his children &gt;&gt; on this side. And I believe he saw his son and and uh he had a choice whether to stay there in heaven &gt;&gt; or to go back and raise his family. &gt;&gt; And uh he made the choice to come back &gt;&gt; to raise his family. &gt;&gt; And um so I was just thinking there, you know, uh when he says, "What would what good would it do for me to be on the other side and make it and not see the fruits of my labor?" No, I actually came back &gt;&gt; to make sure that they made it, &gt;&gt; right? And and no matter what those children go through, if if God already showed him one time on that side, he saw his children, I believe he's going to show them to him again on the other side, they'll all be together. &gt;&gt; And I'm one that believes if God showed that to brother Steve, he has no respect of persons. He has the same feelings of regarding all of us. Even the prophet told us say what what what uh when mama would have dinner uh prepared and and she invite all the family said it just it was not the same unless all the children made it to the table. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I'm looking for every child to make it to the table. That heavenly table. Whatever God got to take them through, they going to make it. &gt;&gt; I heard the the preacher say if they have to come without one leg, they have to come without one arm, without one eye. It don't matter. Long as they make it, that's all that matters to me, &gt;&gt; man. I thank God for the word season recover all. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Tell somebody, you going to recover all. &gt;&gt; You going to recover all. &gt;&gt; My God, you going to recover all. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. You going to recover all. All. All. All. [Music] My Lord, my Lord, my Lord, my Lord. I tell you, I thank God for this. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know, I I um I wanted to just uh just make a a quick comment. You can keep playing that softly. um think that's appropriate song, but brother brother Steve hit something for our young people and uh I was grateful uh to hear him say what he said uh because it lets me know uh that we got some other churches that believe the way we believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then, you know, I was um I was informed of something that happened here over our meetings. And um you know, one thing I will tell you is that every church is sovereign. And what uh pastors teach their churches, those pastors are responsible for what they teach their churches. But here at Spirit and Truth Tabernacle, I'm responsible for what I teach to you all. And um and and I am one that I do not believe that saints should drink for no occasions. &gt;&gt; I don't believe that. I don't believe that you could uh invite the prophet to your house and put a drink down in front of him and expect him to drink it. &gt;&gt; And then use a scripture to try to justify why you're drinking because the angel Lord told the prophet not to defile himself. Now, some would say, "Well, that was only for brother Brandham." I don't believe that, right? I believe if God, the same way I believe when brother Brandham had some pecans in his car. Amen. And uh and he told the man, "I didn't have any pecans in my car, got all the way to his destination, and when he uh unloaded the car in the trunk, he saw pecans at the bottom of all his luggage." What the prophet did was actually get back in the car, drive back to the border and actually gave the pecans to the man, reported the pecans. He didn't wait till the next day. He went right then. And I believe that that example of Christianity is something that we're supposed to follow. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I am one I I firmly believe Christians don't drink under no occasions. &gt;&gt; Brother Random even said it like this. He says, you know, um, in the scripture, we had different ones. They had what they call the Nazerite vow. And, uh, this was, um, Samson had a Nazerite vow. Uh, John the Baptist had a Nazerite vow. Uh, I believe Brother Brandham had that same Nazarite vow. And a Nazarite vow, you were not allowed to drink. Hello, somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we also as believers carry that same Nazarite vow. It's a vow of separation from the things of the world. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't believe Christians should smoke. &gt;&gt; I don't believe Christians should drink. &gt;&gt; I don't believe Christians should lie. &gt;&gt; If we going to be Christians, be Christians. &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. &gt;&gt; So, so, uh, that's what I say. So, so young people, if you ever find yourself in a situation where, uh, they pull out the drinks, you know that we don't believe that. Not at Spirit and Truth Tabernacle. And I'll tell you another thing. There was one time in the Bible, a prophet invited a group of believers to the house of the Lord. They were called the Recoites. And when they came to the house of the Lord, uh they said, "We're going to put drinks out in front of these guys." And when they put the drinks out in front of them say, "We're going to see if they're going to drink." You know, and and the record said, "No, no, no, no, no. We still standing with the words of our fathers." And our fathers promised God that they would not drink. and they were generations gone down the line and still standing with that promise. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. The prophet is not here anymore, but we're still standing underneath that same promise. &gt;&gt; God, we not we going to not we're not going to defile ourselves with anything. We're going to hold to this word. We got time, brothers. We got time. We're going to sing this faithful faithful faithful faithful faithful. Everybody say, "Faithful." &gt;&gt; Faithful. Faithful is &gt;&gt; Come on, sing it again. Say, "Faithful." &gt;&gt; Faithful. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh, faithful. Say faithful.

I I I like how the minister put it this morning, Father, how David had to go to Ziglag. Amen. Before he could go to the kingdom, he had to go to Ziglag. And Father, that's a type for so many things. We thank you, oh God, that even you're you're with us even when we're in Ziglag. Hallelujah. You promise never to leave us nor forsake us, oh God. So thank you, Father, Lord, for all that you're doing. We pray, Father, your blessings upon the saints as they leave this place, but not your presence.
