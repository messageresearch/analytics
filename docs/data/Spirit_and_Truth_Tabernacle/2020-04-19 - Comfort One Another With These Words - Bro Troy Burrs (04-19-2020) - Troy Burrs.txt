and the man just encouraged my heart there just wanted to just quickly read the scripture to you and this morning my precious brother Troy will come in and deliver the word of the Lord to us but I was just reading this this week in my Bible readings and thought that I would just give this to the church Deuteronomy 30 and verse 9 I was reading and when I read the scripture just felt lay it to write it in my prayer journal oh I'm just kind of put it on a number of things as you're going through your fridge earlier this year a gobble just give you maybe some scriptures to go along with some of the things you've already been praying them and when you when you pray scripture you're actually praying God's promise right at the top of whatever it is that you're presenting to God and now sometimes it's just so good to remind the Lord you said this you said that and then I was just thinking about some things and a man the thing about the business and the Lord has blessed us with and this scripture came when I wrote it right there on top of the business but this scripture actually has a lot more to just do it businesses every area of your life a man and whatever you might be going through I pray that this will just speak peace a man to your situation the Bible says the Lord thy God will make the plenteous in every word of my man that mean anything you touch don't be blessed by God hallelujah and it says in the fruit of thy body amen there's somebody looking to have children to put this scripture right and in the fruit of that cattle and in the fruit of thy land for good for the Lord will again that mean he did it before he's gonna do it again the Lord will again rejoice over thee good that mean when you celebrating God is celebrating right the man would rejoice over thee for good as he rejoiced over that father's if my daddy was blessed my mom was blessed I'm gonna be blessed man I just I just think God for that and I was just just just encouraged by the word of the Lord just wanting to give that to the church a man this morning whatever it is that you might be faced and put the Word of God on it unless one let's watch God turn it around we just a couple quick announcements here y'all can be seated those that are here in the sanctuary just receive it just for money as you can see we're just doing things different with the giving those that are joining us online we said god bless you I think they're good to have you with us on this fine Sunday morning and we're still rejoicing and what he did at Calvary some 2,000 years ago we're very grateful a man

time a man we're gonna keep the train moving a man in their absence and when we come together a man I believe the song say that's gonna be shouting on the heels of glory amen when we all get together what a time what a time a man I look forward to that amen if we read from 2nd Corinthians amen the 1st chapter will take you from the first a man through the fourth verse hey man I welcome those that

an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of god and timothy our brother unto the church of god which is at corinth with all the saints which are in all IKEA's amen grace be unto you and peace from our God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ bless it be God even the father of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of mercies and the God of all comfort wherefore comfort us in all our tribulations that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted by God I'm a read that last one again who comforts us in all tribulation that we may be able to comfort them which are in trouble by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted by God a man may the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated a man don't mind if I take my time this morning I know we under a little time constraint being the first service but I wanna I don't want to rush through it amen we'll read from first Thessalonians the fourth chapter amen beginning at the 13th verse can everyone hear me I don't want to yell I knew to the cameras and everything like that I thought I had to yell for the people to hear me and I went back and I listened to the last one say man why is he yelling so Amen but you know sometimes I get a little excited about the Word of God you know sometime in my studies you know to just uh get some things that just come and I have to get up and just walk just just sometimes just stop studying and get up and take a walk say Lord Jesus I come back he hit me but one again I got to get up again ain't been for two sentences and I don't walk back and forth three photons and hands raised and look so I hope the same inspiration that he gave it to me amen you receive it in amen I didn't realize you know the reason I said I don't take my time because he the gift is to get me out of the way a man so that he can speak to his people amen and that's my heart's desire amen but in this first Thessalonians the fourth chapter but I would have but I would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord and the eighteenth verse reads wherefore comfort one another with these words if I'll title this message this morning I would say comfort one another with these words amen let us bow his most gracious Heavenly Father Lord we come before you this morning the Lord guarded Lord God just by a mere education man's education we're able to read these words Lord God and but Lord it takes an anointing to make these words live Lord Lord God we ask your father God that you would use this vehicle of my voice Lord God to deliver take these words and deliver this message no father to the hearts of the people that they may be comforted in this hour we asked his blessings all God in Jesus name I pray amen we're gonna look at this just for a little bit the word comfort yeah Amen the Greek word is Pericles now I hope I'm saying that right I'm not a scholar I do the best I can at breaking down the syllables that some of these Greek words and things amen but it means persuasive discourse a stirring address Amen an example is like a general that would address an army before a battle Amen to give those that may be fearful courage right man that they may find comfort in those words and then it also means to exhort comforting and encouraging it also means to instruct a man or to teach a man yes so we take these words and a group of words together yeah a man to convey a message right I mean we'll take these words and these words are supposed to convey a message to you to bring you a certain level of comfort yeah yeah amen but in order to deliver this message Amen that that those words must travel in a vehicle called sound right I can say the words in my mind and but you won't receive them because there's no traveling vehicle to deliver the words to you man so the sound amen is the vehicle used to get your attention yeah so that you would turn any man and pay attention to the words that I'm saying right exactly that you may receive the message and if you receive the message you will be comforted right hey man hey man yes the sound is what you hear and gives your attention to prepare you to receive the message right yes sir the Prophet said the message is simply God's promises all right if you turn to the message system and the message the rapture all right a man 1965 1204 paragraph 16 I want to give a time to get that amen the message to rapture 65 1204 paragraph 16 yeah amen the Prophet says this there's too much supernatural vindication of God's written word of this hour for something not to be approached for us now all right we're just it's too real the things that you it would be astounding to you just to let you know that what is really taking place right many of you strangers perhaps kill these men get up here and make these remarks about a message right of this out and so forth what they are getting at is God's promises for this that he promised what that he promised what he would do and we see him scripturally will vindicate right truly vindicated right not on visiting that again all right exactly what he said he would do he said he would do it Forbes hold it's just exactly perfectly because it's God singing it aiming comfort one another with these words right in the message the rapture preached December 4th 1965 I want you to notice my brothers and sisters there opening scripture that the Holy Ghost directed the Prophet right brother Branham that's all right if I say that right okay all right we don't preach it flap right tell it just how it is amen to read now listen now a rapture message I probably would have went to Thessalonians probably would have said you caught the thief in the night and you'll be Spiritualized my spiritual basis for action all right who wrapped your message what the Prophet you that's his opening Scripture supposed to go ahead and put that up rapture the same message there paragraph 27 all right he says and I want to speak on the subject this morning of the rapture see he said now we believe that there will be a rapture all Christians believe that that's Bible readers believe that there will be a rapture the church say Amen and now we reap for some background my god this is obvious ad we read the twenty-fifth songs I mean I beg your pardon the 27th songs right one through five write a psalm of David I'll be talking about a message about the rapture and psalm of David the Lord is my light and my salvation whom shall I fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid we know wicked even my enemies and my folds came upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fail though our host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear rise up against me this will be confident I'm sorry the Lord and to inquire now I wanted to slow down right there for a little bit and I want to ask a question where is the house of the Lord in this day alright alright turn to Galatians system to sixth chapter all right and the tenth first Galatians two seeks chapter and the tenth verse and it reads Amen Galatians 26.2 the tenth for who are in the household of the household of God my brother our hiding place in the household of faith amen then the message as it was with Moses amen that's preached 1960 oh nine eleven paragraph the 118 that we love in the house today [Music] there's a shake he says here there's coming a shaking Oh cuz God's power is going to shake the country again and only the household of faith will be saved preached in 1960 I think it was prophetic we're living in that Dave right now my brothers and sisters this is a living word hey man there was a place of safety a man from the judgment in Rahab's day right and it was in her house [Music] [Music] [Music] this morning the secret place the Prophet preached the message that truly be Lord we don't make you feel comfortable right we don't say keep your shoes off all right the kitchens over there yes the bathrooms over there the bedrooms over there yeah make yourself at home right the kitchens the living rooms David imagine no room oh Jesus then he's a guest in your house he is not a man he needs to be Lord of your house a man that shows my god you don't have a revelation of who he is you are inviting him in the door a man as a guest come on Ian Lord set yourself down oh but you can't go back in this room alright if he is Lord if he is truly your Lord you say God you can have access to the kitchen you can have access to the living room you can have access to the bedroom [Music] [Applause] [Music] he's not coming to be a man he's coming he made to a household of faith you say when I return will I find faith amen traces of Revelation a revelation of the word for the app in which you live my brothers and sisters amen a secret place Amen we know we see that Noah had a secret place of safety it was a place of comfort in the time of trouble yes Amen yeah they had to receive the message of the hour for their day it would do us no good to go out and build an ark today right Noah's message we would be off it would do us no good no matter how sincere we were right no matter how faithful we were it is the wrong house [Music] me me huh plan a stones at the wrong place yes yeah the prophecy there's one provide a place of worship only one preferred place I know [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] amen the household of faith is his resting place it's where he abides and it's where you were it means to stay there oh we may get a little weary from being in this house I just want to get out and take a walk the house hole of face is the place this is what he brings us comfort this is what he brings us comfort it is a rock of Revelation it is the place within our hearts and this hour it is a revelation it is the revelation of who he is it is the revelation of this house it is the message of this hour he is a mighty tower he is the secret place the Alpha and Omega he is the resurrection amen church say Amen again I want to read a scripture 2nd 1st Thessalonians the 4th chapter first Thessalonians many many men amen it says for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first remember my brothers that the shower was the message that called us out of darkness all tools of man's teaching and tradition a man I'm getting a turn go with me sister - it is the rising of the Sun 6504 1:8 it is the rising of the Sun paragraph 94 amen remember the shout remember I said words first you have to get your attention I can speak the words silently but that's not gonna do you any good I have to shout a man the voice the sound gets you attention that you will turn to to see see there were three poles to this message amen the first two pools was to get you attention for something that was gonna happen what the word oh we gonna get somewhere stay with me my brothers and sisters amen it is the rising of the Sun paragraph 94 as Christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth although tight in many places amen although typed in many places he was the first fruit of those that slept in the bride coming of Christ amen in the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church they'll have to be a sheaf waved again in the last days there's old man waving the sheaf waving of the sheaf what was the sheaf amen the first one that come to mature amen the first one that proved it was a wheat that proved it was a sheaf hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm talking about it was a wave over the people right and the first time they're come forth amen for the bride age for a resurrection out of dark denominational so that message was a message of the word has turned back again in its full power amen and being waved over the people by the same signs and wonders that he did because he live also speaking to his wife he live also what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen the same word the voice is now in the brain I'm saying the voice of the Resurrection the voice of the Resurrection the voice of the resurrection there's the secret place a secret place where we under the protection of the Almighty why because your purpose is your protection the church say Amen amen the prophets say what good it is to polish the hubs in this vehicle what good is remember I said that the word the message but they have to be a vehicle to deliver the word okay what good is it to have all the quotes to be able to remember the scriptures all of the scriptures all of the quotes but you got them all mixed up oh you got him you got him yeah but see you don't have the spirit with it because he said his spirit and they will lead you and guide you right into all truth how can you reject a man remember I say these words they come to comfort you and comfort these words sometimes mean teach you said the teacher yes how do you gonna reject the teacher how you gonna reject the prophet and his message and expect to be able to have the right of the scripture you may have some things you may have a few quotes you may be able to read the Bible remember these are words it takes the spirit to make them live coming to the household of faith a revelation for this he says what good does Italy give her a facelift for simonize job a good way a man clean oh my god fine churches I got that vehicle looking all pretty yes but when there's no dynamics in it no matter how much the mechanics prove to be right there has got to be dynamics forward to work there's got to be dynamics forward to work a man he'd Bible says the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life amen he said in the message Amen so so I'm sorry 1957 twelve thirteen and then came Jesus I want you to go with me through this little story amen amen you'll find it in your Bibles at John the eleventh chapter that I think it starts I forget what verse but I have it down here don't want to prolong and look for it but you'll get it right one coming from him talking about Lazarus yes Lazarus was sick a man and then came Jesus you can go ahead and put it up sister paragraph 13 I'm sorry paragraph 13 and it says then Jesus came amen there was perhaps as anyone know the context of this that we will not have time to unfold tonight and I hope I have time today to you in the cold room but it was during the time of the death of Lazarus his friend Martha and Mary had been his bosom friend and he was associated with them and one time Jesus a vision from the father yes sir brother received a vision from the father and he said God had told him to leave this place and go to another place my brother said I just got the pause right days God telling you to leave one place and go to another place you got to listen to the leading of the Lord for Lazarus was going to die now you say brother branham that's not written in the scripture see this is why we need a prophet he said but in st. John 5:19 Jesus said I do nothing except my father show me first I do nothing in myself the son can do nothing but what he see the father doing he see the father doing that doeth the Son and if he noticed him how the great vision he went away for four days and they sent for him to come Lazarus was sick they sit for him did they send a runner digby put mail in the mailbox did they use a carrier service Amen I don't know what vehicle they use live with the message to Jesus but I know we have one today right it is prayer Lazarus was sick and if any among you are sick a man he's only one prayer way he's only a prayer away he's not too far where he can't be reached he's only a prayer away call Jesus on the scene no matter what trouble you might be going through he's only a prayer way if there's depression or financial trouble or whatever the case may your car won't start he's only a but listen make the story now as we go home he come right away yes nah he's only a prayer way but he's not gonna come out at a time when you first call him now you see I'm sorry 14 here put it back up sister no we don't know just listen at this we don't know just what the sickness was but some historians have said that he died of hemorrhages of the lungs sound like the coal v8 donut yeah I told you that's man putting egg on things but we know it's the same devil the same tormenting devil that is was the impact at the end Amen is here now but guess what Jesus was only a prayer he had an image in his lungs however he grew sicker and the physicians perhaps could do nothing for him and then after a bit he got sick until he died and when he called Jesus and when he died Jesus said our friend Lazarus sleepeth so the disciples we go on here let's check this out and they said well if he sleep he doeth well now see they don't they didn't they don't get and we don't today many time what the word death means that's mean separation it doesn't mean that it doesn't mean that you die forever you just separate from your friends you alive somewhere else Jesus told them in their own understanding that Lazarus is dead oh and for your sake I'm glad I wasn't there but I go to wake him Oh prophet got excited right there he said oh what a marvelous team amen he said I'll go and wake him could you imagine a man Jesus amen could you imagine the disappointment in this little family Mary Martha called a family of God it's little family those were in the house who faith stay with me here they have been excommunicated from their denominational churches I'm just going to kind of seal some things in here you know just stay with me help to worship they they they were they were excommunicated where their fathers had worshiped because they had accepted Jesus as their Messiah oh my and here miss about what he says I can't hear the mocking and the scarf of the unbeliever saying where's your evangelist now where's your healer oh when it comes time his own buddy he let him back now he had he'll people all the time yes but he wouldn't come back from for his own buddy yeah yeah but we're taught that all things work together for the good of them that love God God is making everything move just according to his great timepiece as it is ticking around then when the darkest hour that the little family had ever seen excommunicated from that church degraded in societies of the Church of their church their friends and their friends that they had put too much confidence in they fail them seemingly that all hope was gone Lazarus was dead and buried for four days for four days corruption set in after seven and two hours three days perhaps his nose had already fallen into his face that's the first thing that takes place the nose turns and falls in and then the skin worms had set in its in into his body and then it just at that great strategic moment when the darkest hour they had ever seen then Jesus came oh oh that's just like him to do that he comes in your darkest moment Jesus came by Amen but but then again I'll take just a moment longer to say this that when Jesus come by if he's not accepted then it doesn't do him any good to pass by your way but when he is good to come back come back and show himself then you should be thankful that you would receive him that you would believe him a man now Martha little Martha had been very much amen the word he said it's dilatory about the scripture coming you know okay yeah see but Mary was the one that sat and listened to him at the feet of Jesus but I think in this passage Martha showed just exactly what she was made of I see Mary was the one when they invited Jesus to the party she was a ill-fame woman she wasn't invited to the party but she saw Jesus sitting there with dirty feet and she went spent her money and got the oil the alabaster box and went back and washed his feet amen Saint Mary amen so what would seem that Mary was the more spiritual one I should say but Martha check my file man not the one to play with Martha she heard that Jesus come and she left Martha showed exactly the scene much I can just start what she was made out of she heard that Jesus come and she started through the streets to go meet him now seemingly that she had a right to unbraid him a man and say why didn't you come when we call just something you feel like that when Karl oh Jesus he don't come right when you're wanting amen the Prophet had that problem amen the devil came to him right he called on Jesus to heal his daughter yes and that's what the same devil same devil amen and she had every he says here seemingly she had every right to abrade him why didn't you come when I call you but to Martin it wasn't a question of whether he come or whether he didn't come the thing was that he's finally he was there and it doesn't make any difference tonight that we had had prayer meetings and what we done and so forth he's here that's the main thing how many failures we've had and so forth he is here how many believe he's here this morning amen now he has come and in our darkest hour in the world's history we are now live in listen at this we know that for both politics and religion everything seems to be in chaos notice it now when she went to meet Jesus instead of giving him a sharp rebuke when she saw him she loved oh I love this she fell down before him and she fell down before him and her beautiful face looking up into his face of Master she recognized quickly as her Lord you remember last night he says when I preach the door the door the hearts you must let him in every room amen for him to be your Lord paraphrasing cuz I want to get through this you will accept him as Savior but never as Lord seldom Lord the Lord is ownership and control he controls your emotions who controls your faith he controls your love he controls your life he's in full control of you and you walked in the Spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ and the Bible said that therefore there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit the lordship of Christ has control amen I want to take this moment my brothers and sisters in we want to lose in the darkest hour we see that everything is in chaos in the darkest hour amen Jesus comes amen let me go on lordship a man so we see my brothers and sisters that Martha went to Jesus she had heard Amen that Jesus was coming he wasn't there yet but she had gotten word through the message of the hour that he was coming there were many that was before us that scene of the healings went to the revivals and saw the word coming amen but Martha a man had to catch the revelation amen she had to step amen into my god division notice my brothers and sisters she had spoken with the Lord and he said oh I know Amen that if you would have been here Amen my brother wouldn't have died and he said but she said but even now even now whatever you say will be done a man jesus said to her awesome Martha was looking at he said I am the resurrection I am the resurrection she said yes my god I know he'll he'll rise again he'll rise you know she was putting the resurrection off into some distant time a man she hadn't caught the revelation yet of who exactly she was talking to he told me I'm the resurrection they men the resurrection is not an event that's going to happen down the road the resurrection is a person and that person a man is abiding in the house amen he has control compete control of the house a man that you are living in a manual in the same house a man with the resurrection he says am the resurrection Lazarus laid in the tomb for four days we have seven Church ages these seven Church ages all those seven ages there are four Dean's represented amen the lion for days the lion the ox let me say it this way what we call a day a man is simply a span of time so we have the Lion of the tribe of Judah in the first time period the next time it was the Ox during the Dark Ages the third time period Amen was the man during the Reformation the last time period and was the Eagle is the eagle right where do we find comfort under the wings of the Almighty under the eagle's wings amen anointing Wow because the eagle has a special anointing that he has keen eyesight and look both that Reggie can look into the future he can look into the past a man in the darkest that's the darkest hour he waited the fourth day the darkest hour and say go get Mary Martha called the revelation she finally caught the revelation just like the woman that the world arena she realized who she was talking about she caught the revelation of who he was I say you'd be the Messiah she got up and she ran a made multitude to save face she got up and ran she got up and ran the mother and secretly with the man she didn't say he was coming is here the same together [Applause] they came to comfort her they come and they bring food hey man they comfort you with a bucket of chicken conference she a chicken he's not coming anymore the Word of God has been have been revealed he's not coming anymore he's here back to the same place one provided place so Mary went back to that place amen and Jesus a man said it is time amen I've gathered the bride with the message amen the voice moved amen they caught the revelation now it is time amen we have to lay in the presence of the Sun amen and to we just riping my brothers and sisters and Jesus can't be they did the voice cried with a loud voice Lazarus come forth anything he didn't have to say it twice he didn't have to scream what happened my brother's SS we told you earlier that he had caught a vision and what happened Mary and Martha he told him to move the stone when they moved a stall right they stepped into the vision he became a part of the vision but he had to wait for him to get a revelation but they had a role to play we have a role to play let us take comfort one another with these words this time of trouble this time of chaos everybody is looking for comfort the news is saying that domestic disputes are on the rise suicide is on the increase people have lost their comfort why because they have their comfort in their money in their jobs they have their comfort in the wrong house some of you might be going to church I mean I'm glad that you have a mind to go to church amen but you have to come into the household of faith there's only one provided place I come to you this morning my brothers and sisters and we've been saved for all through seven Church ages for four days that Jesus is

approach that you have some aspects we're looking at tomorrow's news but as we read what the Prophet said we are listening to what the Prophet said we're looking at tomorrow's newspaper so we already know what Spirit happened and we're not sure we're not alarm a man we know that we found the secret place knowledge brought us into it and that's that stuff a good thing that lasts for the fraud went to the Psalms 27 and I think the last verse says say he will hide us they men in his pavilion in the secret of us and it's time for like a hey he got Highness right so you don't have anything to worry
