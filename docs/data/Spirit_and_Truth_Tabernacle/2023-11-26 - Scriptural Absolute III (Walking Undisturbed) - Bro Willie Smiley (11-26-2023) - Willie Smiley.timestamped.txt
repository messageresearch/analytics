[54:10] say
[54:12] hallelujah
[54:18] well I'm not sure many many of y'all
[54:21] know but since I've been back I haven't
[54:24] had a job
[54:26] and the way it was the way it
[54:28] happened I saw a spirit behind
[54:31] it so the last couple months I even told
[54:35] brother brother Jack when I told him I
[54:36] have a job he said well did you look in
[54:37] Optics and I'm like I ain't doing that
[54:39] no more I do all right I ain't doing so
[54:42] of course I went out on my own and tried
[54:44] to I applied from Bag Boy to
[54:48] management everywhere I turned everybody
[54:50] kept saying no but the whole time there
[54:53] was a job up in Port St Lucy that was
[54:55] Optical job I'm like I ain't going up
[54:56] there I said that's not where I'm
[54:58] supposed to be cuz I remember brother
[55:00] Simba testimony where he said he chose
[55:04] where he was going to live based off of
[55:05] where his church was and also brother
[55:08] Jos so I was like I'm not going up there
[55:11] I ain't working up there so I just was
[55:13] Faithfully waiting now let me back
[55:15] up when my job was getting ready to
[55:17] close one of the brothers
[55:20] from cut a long story short I got a job
[55:24] but
[55:26] one of the one of the guys from the job
[55:28] he called me and he was like hey you
[55:30] want me to talk to some people and see
[55:31] if I can get you the job see if they
[55:33] bring you back I'm like sure I didn't
[55:36] even ask him he just said he was going
[55:37] to do it himself so he did it and he was
[55:40] like all of a sudden people out the
[55:41] woodwork just kept coming up saying no
[55:44] no don't hire him don't hire him so the
[55:45] area maner were like no we going to look
[55:46] past him so that same store probably
[55:50] about a week ago I looked on indeed and
[55:54] it popped up and I I think it was only
[55:55] like two two hours old so I was like
[55:59] something said you remember what
[56:02] happened the last time you needed a job
[56:05] where I told you to go I'm like Lord
[56:07] they already told me no I ain't doing it
[56:09] I ain't going back to a place that told
[56:11] me no he was like they told you no I'm
[56:15] telling you to apply oh my I'm like
[56:19] that's good
[56:23] now when God tell you to do something
[56:26] you have to lay pride
[56:28] aside cuz my pride wanted me not to
[56:31] apply I like I'm too prideful I'm I'm
[56:34] way better than this so I was like you
[56:37] know what Lord I'll do it so two days
[56:39] later the area manager call me I'm like
[56:42] hey how you doing he was like yeah I
[56:44] already uh looked over everything he
[56:46] said all I've been hearing is good
[56:48] reports I called HR HR said you already
[56:50] hirable so he was like all all you got
[56:53] to do is meet the store manager and
[56:55] stuff I'm like all right no problem so a
[56:57] day later the store manager called me
[56:59] and was like hey uh I just want you to
[57:02] come in do a Mee and greet I'm like okay
[57:04] so I came in and just everything about
[57:07] the atmosphere just everything was it
[57:09] wasn't even like a meet and greet it was
[57:10] just like conversation it wasn't even an
[57:12] interview she was like we got to get you
[57:14] in here so I immediately started doing
[57:19] the onboarding and everything and just
[57:22] praising I'm like Lord I'm glad I trust
[57:25] in you and not a man
[57:27] so not only that of course you know when
[57:30] you're dealing with corporations they
[57:31] try you cuz they notice I ain't been
[57:33] working for about a month but I stood on
[57:35] God's word I'm like I'm not going back
[57:39] to I'm not going back for less than when
[57:41] I originally was there cuz they of
[57:43] course they were like well it's kind of
[57:45] high what you're asking for I said
[57:47] that's a lie I said the last time y'all
[57:50] I applied y'all gave me this I said I'm
[57:52] not going I ain't coming back for less
[57:54] than that all right let me make some
[57:57] phone calls I got a text probably an
[58:00] hour later we got a prove and they gave
[58:02] me more money than I asked for

[1:14:28] to see everybody I tell you what I had a
[1:14:30] wonderful time on Thanksgiving I it was
[1:14:33] about 50 of us uh came together some of
[1:14:37] my cousins I hadn't seen in years had a
[1:14:40] good time hugging one another's neck and

[1:14:48] just wait till you know every 10 years
[1:14:51] we need to do this quarter

[1:15:04] Jack them kids but my side they don't
[1:15:06] even know my cousins they got other
[1:15:09] cousins yes right amen uh let's start at
[1:15:13] um Matthew 14:22 and Jesus straight
[1:15:17] straightway Jesus constrained his
[1:15:19] disciples to get into a
[1:15:21] ship and to to go before him and to the
[1:15:24] other side while he sent the multitude
[1:15:27] away and when he had sent the multitude
[1:15:31] away he went into the mountains ofart to
[1:15:34] pray and when the evening was come he
[1:15:37] was there alone but the ship was now in
[1:15:41] the midst of the sea t with waves for
[1:15:44] the wind was
[1:15:46] contrary and in the Fourth Watch of the
[1:15:49] night Jesus went unto them walking on
[1:15:51] the sea and when the disciples saw him
[1:15:54] walking on the seed they were troubled
[1:15:57] saying is it a spirit and they cried out
[1:16:00] for fear but straightway Jesus spake
[1:16:03] unto them saying be of good cheer it is
[1:16:05] I Be not Afraid and Peter answered him
[1:16:09] and said Lord if it if it be thou bid me
[1:16:13] to come unto thee on the water and he
[1:16:15] said come and when Peter was come down
[1:16:18] out of the ship he walked on the water
[1:16:21] to go to Jesus but when when he saw the
[1:16:24] uh wind blusterous uh he was
[1:16:27] afraid and begin to sink and he cried
[1:16:30] saying Lord save me and immediately
[1:16:33] Jesus stretched forth his hands and
[1:16:35] caught him and said unto them oh thou of
[1:16:39] a little faith wherefore did thou doubt
[1:16:43] and when they had come into the ship the
[1:16:45] wind ceased let's bow ah heads gracious
[1:16:47] father we thank you this morning we can
[1:16:50] uh truly say you've been good to us you
[1:16:53] you just brought us out just about to
[1:16:56] another uh closing of another
[1:16:58] year Lord you brought us through seen
[1:17:01] and unseen dangers and you've provided
[1:17:04] for us Lord God you just uh one song say
[1:17:08] you just keep on proving yourself yes
[1:17:11] and uh we we we just thank you and we
[1:17:13] praise you oh God this morning we just
[1:17:15] pray that you can help me to get myself
[1:17:17] out of the way that um uh you can just
[1:17:20] be a blessing to your people in Jesus
[1:17:22] Christ wonderful name amen amen you may
[1:17:24] be
[1:17:25] seated uh I want to use as a a subject
[1:17:30] uh my subject that I've been using the
[1:17:32] last couple of services uh a scriptural
[1:17:36] absolute that'll be my subject going
[1:17:38] into next year but uh we have a context
[1:17:41] to the text walking
[1:17:44] undisturbed and and I would just really
[1:17:47] like to uh say how much I appreciated
[1:17:51] brother brother Whispers on last week
[1:17:54] that was just a real master
[1:17:57] Masterpiece and uh one one of the things
[1:18:00] I just like to say uh to the
[1:18:03] ministry uh because maybe the Le don't
[1:18:05] study the same way the ministry studies
[1:18:07] and look at things uh you could never
[1:18:10] get complacent you should never get
[1:18:12] complacent and feel like well I've been
[1:18:14] and I've been preaching for 30 years and
[1:18:17] in 30 years that message was
[1:18:21] Tade for brother whist
[1:18:23] it it was the right season and right
[1:18:25] time cuz I've preached Paradox and I've
[1:18:28] preached absolute over the years several
[1:18:31] times right and I just never saw those
[1:18:34] quotes in correlation I was sitting
[1:18:36] there like you you this thing this thing
[1:18:40] is is just next
[1:18:43] level right but but uh the reason why um
[1:18:48] that I've been using scriptural absolute
[1:18:51] just as the basis of everything that I
[1:18:54] want to preach on and for the things
[1:18:56] that we hear preach is because you know
[1:18:59] we we got to be stable yeah and and like
[1:19:03] he was bringing out a quote that it's
[1:19:05] something that we must have uhuh we we
[1:19:08] we we got to if we're going to
[1:19:10] accomplish anything if we're going to be
[1:19:12] anything in God you got to you got to
[1:19:14] have an absolute right amen faith faith
[1:19:17] has got to have a place to rest
[1:19:20] itself right and it can't on shift SS of
[1:19:24] man's Wisdom and things of that nature
[1:19:26] is that right it it it can't so so this
[1:19:30] is one of the reasons why I've I've I've
[1:19:33] titled this you know a scriptural
[1:19:36] absolute so that we could understand the
[1:19:39] Bible that we could understand it's just
[1:19:42] not sermons all right right it's it's
[1:19:47] something that that's that's tied to us
[1:19:50] and we're tied to it amen right glor to
[1:19:53] God and and if we're ever if we're ever
[1:19:55] going to overcome in this age right we
[1:20:00] we need what's preached in this age all
[1:20:03] right yes sir right scripturally we we
[1:20:05] need sound teaching sound Doctrine am is
[1:20:09] that right because of the age where uh
[1:20:13] scripturally you know people don't like
[1:20:15] to look at the Bible a lot of times but
[1:20:17] the the and this this just keep y'all
[1:20:19] bear with me for a minute it takes me a
[1:20:21] minute to get out of the way
[1:20:23] but but people don't realize
[1:20:25] scripturally the scripture says there'll
[1:20:27] be these false anointed ones false
[1:20:30] they'll be
[1:20:31] anointed but with false
[1:20:35] teachings right glory to God that that
[1:20:38] if it was possible the very elect would
[1:20:42] be deceived I'm I'm going say that again
[1:20:45] if it was possible we would be
[1:20:49] deceived just like all of the world
[1:20:52] right
[1:20:53] right but it's totally
[1:20:55] impossible uh for the elect of God to be
[1:20:59] deceived and so we we have to appreciate
[1:21:02] the son of man ministry right which
[1:21:06] which is just a ministry that's that's
[1:21:08] really uh come in this AE to help us to
[1:21:13] understand the Bible yes sir it's not
[1:21:15] something outside of the Bible like even
[1:21:18] the prophet he was talking about the
[1:21:20] seals on the back of the book he
[1:21:24] realized that that what he was looking
[1:21:26] at is the hidden things that were in the
[1:21:29] book that needed light uh Shone on it
[1:21:33] that's right that's right is that right
[1:21:36] amen amen to pull a cover off of or
[1:21:40] unveil the mystery the things that's
[1:21:42] been hidden so we we thank God for
[1:21:47] exposure
[1:21:49] Hall we think that oh y'all got quiet on
[1:21:52] me then we we thank God for
[1:21:55] exposure and with this exposure it's it
[1:21:59] it
[1:22:00] reveals
[1:22:02] Christ right amen amen in US amen that's
[1:22:07] it well we going to go somewhere this
[1:22:09] morning we going to go somewhere this
[1:22:11] morning I I got a lot of hair on my fork
[1:22:13] and I don't know how far I'm I'mma get
[1:22:16] uh but I'mma just go to time to quit if
[1:22:21] if y'all pull I'll preach
[1:22:23] right if y'all get quiet on me I'll
[1:22:28] medal y'all do not want me m amen but
[1:22:33] let let's let's just kind of let's just
[1:22:35] kind of uh look at the scripture um in
[1:22:40] in the text um in St Matthew chapter 14
[1:22:44] now one one of the things we we just
[1:22:46] want to uh follow a certain thought
[1:22:49] right because uh as as disciples they
[1:22:53] they were they were following the word
[1:22:56] right the word was was made flesh and
[1:22:58] was dwelling amongst them uh he was he
[1:23:01] was uh the the God you know there a lot
[1:23:04] of things that's been preached over the
[1:23:06] last few weeks and we appreciate the the
[1:23:08] Brethren and all the things but they
[1:23:11] they were called out amen they were
[1:23:13] being uh uh
[1:23:16] discipled and and they they were they
[1:23:19] were following the word they were being
[1:23:22] committed by the word okay the the word
[1:23:25] watch watch something right the the word
[1:23:30] commission they was under a mandate they
[1:23:33] had they had a
[1:23:34] purpose right and a part of what he said
[1:23:37] he he commissioned them or commanded
[1:23:40] them to get in a
[1:23:42] boat right and and to to to to move go
[1:23:46] to the other side is that right yes sir

[1:23:51] know I want to make clear clear for us
[1:23:53] this morning we're not a people that's
[1:23:55] standing still right amen amen and
[1:23:59] anytime I hear that that bothers me when
[1:24:02] I hear people say well ain't nothing
[1:24:03] going on around the word and and and
[1:24:06] ain't this and it's not this and it's
[1:24:08] not that those things bother me it just
[1:24:12] proves to me you lack
[1:24:15] biblical understanding because we can't
[1:24:19] be
[1:24:20] transitioning which we are right sir
[1:24:23] right right we we're transitioning we
[1:24:26] we're in a Rapture right sir we're we're
[1:24:29] moving right we're in a spiritual boat
[1:24:33] right going to the other side we we've
[1:24:37] been some song says we been been
[1:24:39] commissioned by Lord G right I forgot
[1:24:43] it's just kind of coming to me so so
[1:24:45] we're under a mandate from almighty God
[1:24:48] is that right right amen we're we're in
[1:24:51] a spiritual
[1:24:52] boat and and you know we're we're on our
[1:24:56] way yes right yes we're we're on a
[1:25:00] journey right we're not standing still
[1:25:03] Church anytime somebody say that you're
[1:25:06] standing still they do not understand
[1:25:09] the Bible all right right they do not
[1:25:13] understand the present day amen
[1:25:15] Commission of the word all right right
[1:25:19] come on glory to God Amen we're we're
[1:25:21] we're on the Move we've been on the Move
[1:25:25] we've been going
[1:25:26] somewhere we have not been standing
[1:25:29] still there's constantly something going
[1:25:32] on Amen is that right amen but you know
[1:25:36] we want to show us something this
[1:25:38] morning because you know uh being on the
[1:25:44] boat uh and and and you're you're on the
[1:25:49] journey you you run into
[1:25:52] uh
[1:25:54] problems all right come on yeah being on
[1:25:58] the ride don't alleviate you from
[1:26:03] problems being a Christian you know that
[1:26:06] that's going to be uh uh problems is
[1:26:11] that right cuz the the scripture the
[1:26:14] scripture says see the ship now in the
[1:26:17] midst of this and let me tell you
[1:26:19] something we
[1:26:20] way down the road now all right now come
[1:26:24] on we so far down the road we can't turn
[1:26:27] back all right come on I won't turn back
[1:26:31] that's it that's it right and and you
[1:26:35] know being being out here you know uh uh
[1:26:39] the scripture says the the sea started
[1:26:43] the toss with the waves for the wind it
[1:26:47] was it was contrary come on yeah right
[1:26:52] right it it wasn't just some at ease and
[1:26:55] Z you know something that you could no
[1:26:59] the
[1:27:01] conditions of the ride was was contrary
[1:27:05] right right glory to God and see and see
[1:27:10] you know when when we come up against
[1:27:14] contrary winds right here's the problem
[1:27:18] now we like to look at this thing
[1:27:21] historically
[1:27:22] right but I don't study the Bible from a
[1:27:25] historical
[1:27:26] standpoint cuz history what history is
[1:27:29] fine but it don't do me as much good as
[1:27:32] present day understanding of the
[1:27:34] scripture all right is that right glory
[1:27:37] to God you you in a boat and and and
[1:27:41] sometimes on the journey things get
[1:27:45] contrary yes things get things get
[1:27:49] difficult right right amen it gets it
[1:27:54] get it really does it gets difficult
[1:27:57] that's it right glory to God and things
[1:28:00] got difficult for the
[1:28:03] disciples but but they they had watch
[1:28:06] this they were under commission by God
[1:28:08] yes sir the call of God is that right
[1:28:12] Jesus told them to go to the other side
[1:28:16] yes sir right amen he never told him
[1:28:20] about the contrary winds that was going
[1:28:22] now let's face this church we serve a
[1:28:26] sovereign God glory God is
[1:28:30] infin God knows what you going to go
[1:28:33] through before you go through
[1:28:36] it God knows what you going to encounter
[1:28:39] before you ever encounter amen is that
[1:28:42] right he told one prophet he said man
[1:28:45] let me tell you something he said before
[1:28:47] you was even conceived in the wom of
[1:28:50] your mama I already knew
[1:28:52] you that's
[1:28:54] powerful see way back
[1:28:58] when your first day as a Christian God
[1:29:02] knew every test and every
[1:29:05] trial right that you will go to but he
[1:29:08] put you on the boat Hallelujah
[1:29:11] commission to commissioned us to go
[1:29:14] towards a Rapture to go towards a
[1:29:17] change to go towards amen a marriage
[1:29:21] supper
[1:29:22] to go towards a millennium rign to go
[1:29:25] towards brother Jack was preaching to us
[1:29:28] a New
[1:29:30] Jerusalem but he did not tell us that
[1:29:33] the ways would be
[1:29:34] contrary
[1:29:36] trth but the sovereignty of God knew
[1:29:40] that it would sir the moment that they
[1:29:43] got on the boat Jesus knew what was
[1:29:46] going to
[1:29:47] happen right it never it never you know
[1:29:51] kind of T Jesus off of God God it it did
[1:29:57] but but what what it what it showed it
[1:30:00] it showed how the humanistic
[1:30:06] elements could could take over come on
[1:30:10] and and uh drown us my is that right
[1:30:15] right and see church I'm going say
[1:30:17] something here we got to learn to live
[1:30:20] above
[1:30:24] negativity negative
[1:30:27] expectations Right Live above the uh
[1:30:31] caral humanistic
[1:30:34] realm we got eye gate ear gate we got
[1:30:37] these all of these
[1:30:39] Gates amen and and things can can be
[1:30:44] overwhelming that's right that's right
[1:30:45] we don't like to preach like this come
[1:30:48] come on you know we like to preach Pie
[1:30:50] in the Sky Christianity but not true
[1:30:53] amen amen see we we like to come and
[1:30:56] shout and pretend like you know
[1:31:00] uh our world is all this and all of that
[1:31:03] but your facial expression shows a lot
[1:31:05] of times man you a contrary
[1:31:08] wins right
[1:31:11] Hallelujah fear is taking over all right
[1:31:15] come on fear fear we're going somewhere
[1:31:17] now
[1:31:19] Church it it should
[1:31:22] but but we got to deal in in order for
[1:31:26] us to live above these things we got to
[1:31:29] point out these things and and and help
[1:31:32] us to see these things is that right and
[1:31:35] to show us uh the differences which we
[1:31:39] going to do this morning in the
[1:31:41] walk in the way cuz there's a difference
[1:31:44] in the way that we walk and then in the
[1:31:47] way that Jesus
[1:31:50] walked and and then you know there's
[1:31:52] still different different you know
[1:31:56] growth periods and some of us walk on a
[1:32:00] higher level than others all right but
[1:32:03] the preaching of the Gospel is trying to
[1:32:05] bring us all to this place all right
[1:32:08] where where we walk amen
[1:32:12] undisturbed is that right glory to God
[1:32:16] but amen with with the the the the
[1:32:20] contrary wind it's it brought forth
[1:32:26] fear yes sir right amen they probably
[1:32:31] just left some some you know feeding the
[1:32:34] 5,000 and all of that and probably with
[1:32:36] sitting there with with a tremendous
[1:32:40] testimony my man did you see that look
[1:32:43] look at what we witnessed look at what
[1:32:45] we were a part of all right amen right
[1:32:49] yeah and and not even you know a day
[1:32:52] later they out here and and boy I just I
[1:32:56] just enjoyed what brother whisper said
[1:32:58] you know God gives us something that we
[1:33:00] could hold on to and look
[1:33:02] back is that right we can look back to
[1:33:05] right right when it seem like our world
[1:33:07] is upside downlu we can look back to the
[1:33:10] things that God has
[1:33:12] already yes sir is that right amen but
[1:33:17] when the whims got
[1:33:19] contrary then then the human
[1:33:23] element you know or I'll say it like
[1:33:26] this they started to be
[1:33:28] affected my right by the the contrary
[1:33:35] winds all right right glory to God they
[1:33:39] start real
[1:33:40] realistically amen they started being
[1:33:43] affected right by you know that they're
[1:33:47] thinking oh
[1:33:49] my what are we going to do come on
[1:33:52] come
[1:33:53] on man do you see the winds come
[1:33:57] on man do you see the waste boy it's
[1:34:01] kind of bad out
[1:34:03] there and and listen let me tell you
[1:34:06] something these were
[1:34:08] boatmen oh y'all going to make me
[1:34:10] preach there you these were these were
[1:34:14] supposedly experienced
[1:34:17] men come on on a boatos ibly in their
[1:34:22] element talk about that yeah that's
[1:34:26] fresh off the press come on huh yeah
[1:34:30] amen experience supposedly they knew
[1:34:34] come on come on probably you know
[1:34:37] probably used to certain levels of
[1:34:42] trauma and stress that's associated with
[1:34:47] being out in the sea right amen yeah but
[1:34:51] but I I believe this was some some Next
[1:34:54] Level type of thing is that right that
[1:34:57] maybe they was like feeling
[1:35:01] inadequate come on you ever been there
[1:35:04] all right where where you feel like you
[1:35:06] know man this is this is something that
[1:35:10] you know what I've not
[1:35:12] experienced before uhuh yes
[1:35:15] sir but then the first thing we
[1:35:18] do we we start looking at the
[1:35:23] situation not from a Biblical standpoint
[1:35:28] but from a natural caral humanistic
[1:35:33] standpoint right I'm G to make a
[1:35:34] statement this might hurt you but you're
[1:35:36] going to be all right I think a lot of
[1:35:38] times as Christians we live more
[1:35:42] carnally than we do
[1:35:44] spiritually
[1:35:46] right we live more
[1:35:49] Earthly right we all guilty now come on
[1:35:53] we all guilty of it we're we're more
[1:35:56] we're more Earthly and caral and
[1:35:59] non-spiritual then then you know we
[1:36:03] think we more spiritual but when you
[1:36:06] really dig down in the word of God you
[1:36:08] should you see yourself be like I ain't
[1:36:11] really what I think I ought to be my my
[1:36:14] thoughts and my actions and the way that
[1:36:16] I approach things and the way that I
[1:36:18] look at things it's like Bo i a i a I
[1:36:21] ain't no bag of chips and whatever you
[1:36:23] know y'all know what I'm talking about
[1:36:24] all right I ain't all that come on
[1:36:27] brother right that's the truth come on
[1:36:31] be be because we we allow the
[1:36:34] contrariness of Our Lives to just uh
[1:36:38] overtake us wow wow wow
[1:36:43] right you know they they were starting
[1:36:46] to you know they was fearful yeah
[1:36:49] because of the conditions that
[1:36:51] surrounded them all right amen hadn't
[1:36:54] even overtaken them but they was they
[1:36:57] was in it it was surrounding them and
[1:37:01] they started operating Amen in
[1:37:05] fear all
[1:37:07] right
[1:37:08] right amen Jess was in a great having a
[1:37:13] great time Thanksgiving all

[1:38:26] thing to to to just seem like overwhelm
[1:38:30] us to a certain degree and but he's on
[1:38:33] his way yes sir when when when the
[1:38:36] contrary seed start cutting up all right
[1:38:39] Jesus had gone up you know to kind of
[1:38:42] you know cuz you know he the god amen he
[1:38:45] the great Shepherd just to to assess the
[1:38:49] situation amen he I I could imagine he

[1:39:24] I'm feeling good come on Jesus came
[1:39:27] walking to to on the water now now I I
[1:39:32] don't know if I want to read it or just
[1:39:33] preach on
[1:39:34] it Jesus listen church I got a quote
[1:39:38] here where where brother Brer makes a
[1:39:41] statement he says you know uh and this
[1:39:44] is where I got my tit he say Jesus came
[1:39:47] walking
[1:39:50] undisturbed
[1:39:53] it's in here I got the quote right he
[1:39:56] said Jesus came walking on the water he
[1:39:59] had see he had substance Faith sir right
[1:40:04] he had a real revelation of who he was
[1:40:07] is that right amen he was he was a he
[1:40:10] was
[1:40:11] different amen right Jesus was different
[1:40:15] was nothing ordinary about Jesus right
[1:40:18] he was he was past the carnal mind
[1:40:22] figuring out yes sir you know when I be
[1:40:24] hearing people on the on on the net and
[1:40:27] they be posting and writing and all of
[1:40:29] that I just I be like listen you'll
[1:40:33] never understand the Bible from an
[1:40:37] intellectual
[1:40:38] standpoint cuz the Revelation is hid
[1:40:41] from the wise imp Putin and reveals to
[1:40:44] Bab such as we
[1:40:47] learn if if you're not willing to humble
[1:40:50] yourself and learn you'll miss God a
[1:40:53] million miles you'll miss what God is
[1:40:56] doing in your season in your time by
[1:41:00] your intellect you never understand God
[1:41:04] by being
[1:41:05] smart right because smart men in the
[1:41:08] Bible couldn't see the further part of
[1:41:11] the word being made
[1:41:14] manifest the priest educated Scholars
[1:41:17] educated men but amen when it came down
[1:41:21] to the unfolding of the word of God Amen
[1:41:25] they couldn't see it amen they didn't
[1:41:28] have no representation but here was a
[1:41:30] woman here was a here was a woman that
[1:41:34] that couldn't come out with the rest of
[1:41:35] the women that was probably looked down
[1:41:39] on as as a nothing cast out and and
[1:41:42] smashed and talked about and everything
[1:41:45] else amen when she met the word yes and
[1:41:49] and the word got the talking to her
[1:41:52] right she recognized something is that
[1:41:55] right amen man I believe you're a
[1:41:57] prophet amen the the one that's supposed
[1:42:00] to come I'm him it it didn't take all of
[1:42:04] you know I'm praying and I'm studying
[1:42:07] and uh no it was some
[1:42:11] representation she was hearing from her
[1:42:14] diony her theophany Quicken something
[1:42:17] down in her
[1:42:19] heart she said my God dropped what she
[1:42:23] was doing and ran out
[1:42:27] testifying Hallelujah while the priest
[1:42:29] was trying to figure out all the things
[1:42:31] that was wrong with the message God she
[1:42:35] gravitated towards it amen she she grasp
[1:42:39] it wholeheartedly why because she was
[1:42:43] simple she was humble amen is that right
[1:42:47] amen glory to God but Jesus Jes Jesus
[1:42:51] you know he came now now watch same
[1:42:57] conditions the same conditions that
[1:43:01] brought about
[1:43:04] fear right Jesus walked in them same
[1:43:07] same conditions
[1:43:09] Wow Come
[1:43:11] on come on Amen the waves was
[1:43:15] contrary and they was
[1:43:19] fearful Glory to God Amen conditions
[1:43:23] didn't change
[1:43:24] yet probably got a little
[1:43:27] worse
[1:43:29] huh Jesus just kept on walking I like
[1:43:32] how brother BR say he said you know that
[1:43:34] thing stop flattening out before
[1:43:37] him all right all right what was what
[1:43:42] what was before saw saw amen the master
[1:43:45] coming it was like rolling out the red
[1:43:49] carpet amen the king of king and the
[1:43:52] Lord of Lord is
[1:43:53] coming let's lay down before him bow
[1:43:57] down before him amen come on Glory come
[1:44:01] on the creator of the elements recognize
[1:44:05] their master sir GL right and just laid
[1:44:09] down before him right amen his faith
[1:44:14] produced the surface listen no nobody
[1:44:17] could ever talk about nothing walking on
[1:44:19] the water before
[1:44:21] Jesus that was unheard
[1:44:25] of
[1:44:27] Amen let's face it you know a lot of
[1:44:30] time when people feel like they
[1:44:32] understand the Bible they miss God
[1:44:34] because he's so unusual that's a quote
[1:44:38] that's it he does things that's unusual
[1:44:41] he does things that's different right
[1:44:44] right amen huh amen the trend is the
[1:44:48] trend and that's why you can't follow
[1:44:50] the trend
[1:44:51] you got to follow the
[1:44:53] word the look cuz look at the trends now
[1:44:57] right look look at look at what what the
[1:45:01] the
[1:45:02] core religious world is is and how
[1:45:07] they're moving and it's like these
[1:45:10] things are so contrary to the
[1:45:13] scripture we we're we're injecting so
[1:45:15] many things that's so
[1:45:18] contrary uh to script dis inclusions and
[1:45:23] you know no hell and and and you know
[1:45:27] all of this Universal teaching all right
[1:45:31] now that's bit it it happened even back
[1:45:34] in the Book of Romans all right where
[1:45:37] they was wor worshiping the creation
[1:45:39] more than the
[1:45:41] Creator amen okay is that right and
[1:45:45] Scientology and and just all of these
[1:45:48] different things man that that they're
[1:45:51] they're
[1:45:53] injecting right that would deceive us
[1:45:57] but we
[1:45:59] predestinated we predestinated I feel
[1:46:02] like Peter I'm not going
[1:46:04] anywhere where can I go right right when
[1:46:08] when when I've tapped into something

[1:52:19] mind set of people what is that do you I
[1:52:24] could imagine you know having a
[1:52:26] conference do you believe that that's
[1:52:29] him come
[1:52:32] on they they were so they were so
[1:52:37] overwhelmed by the S the the
[1:52:41] symptoms and the
[1:52:43] contrariness you know of the elements
[1:52:46] around them that they could not re
[1:52:51] recognize right so much so he says

[1:53:11] because of the humanistic real the the
[1:53:15] the the what they saw right you know and
[1:53:19] then then then you know Peter always
[1:53:22] been one of them ones who you know

[1:54:06] Peter was always just that one that just

[1:54:17] different peculiar right right the world
[1:54:20] don't get you because you you know you
[1:54:23] peculiar right you're a

[1:55:00] right amen you know Jesus lived in a
[1:55:04] world of his
[1:55:07] own right he was here but he was in that
[1:55:11] land right y'all don't know nothing

[1:55:41] and and all of that that we don't even
[1:55:44] know how to live like Christians we

[2:03:54] caps man was rolling in they was big Wow
[2:03:59] when he start and this is us this is us
[2:04:02] a lot of times we we we start out one
[2:04:06] way with with with you know a substance
[2:04:11] faith and we be walking but then we get
[2:04:15] we get our eyes off of the
[2:04:17] word right
[2:04:20] see and and start to get getting our
[2:04:23] eyes on our
[2:04:25] surroundings and what other people are

[2:08:07] christianizing us but sometimes I look
[2:08:10] and be

[2:08:24] come on it's a lot more and I actions

[2:08:36] operating a certain way if we UND
[2:08:41] undisturbed by what's surrounding us
[2:08:45] come

[2:21:19] he done
[2:21:20] drown but he wouldn't Let Me
[2:21:26] [Applause]
[2:21:29] Drown his purpose in coming was so that
[2:21:33] I would not
[2:21:35] drown see Peter Peter could have drowned
[2:21:38] on the water but they could have drowned
[2:21:40] in the
[2:21:41] boat cuz the circumstances could have
[2:21:44] just as well overcame why yeah I ain't
[2:21:46] never been out there like that in in in

[2:22:07] anytime Jesus come he bring a
[2:22:12] calm right anytime he com he bring a cal
[2:22:17] this this should be such a calm in our
[2:22:20] Spirits right the the the the enemy want
[2:22:23] us to be hysterical let me just made the
[2:22:25] way want us to feel overwhelmed and this
[2:22:29] and that and you know but this should be
[2:22:33] a cuz if Jesus is here if he's present
[2:22:38] there should be a peace in our
[2:22:41] spirit right amen as long as we looking
[2:22:45] at the word
[2:22:47] and and walking
[2:22:50] undisturbed man I tell you what that's

[2:23:24] praise the Lord amen um certainly
[2:23:27] appreciate brother smiley on
[2:23:30] today and um tell you what you you ought
[2:23:34] to leave here no matter what you're
[2:23:35] going through um have a determination
[2:23:38] that you're going to walk
[2:23:40] [Music]
[2:23:42] undisturbed as he was just even reading
[2:23:44] the Scripture it just kind of struck me
[2:23:47] how uh when Peter begin to sink and and
[2:23:51] begin to call on the Lord
[2:23:53] Jesus uh Jesus said oh ye of little
[2:23:57] faith and I thought to myself you know
[2:24:00] as he was just reading and like well wow
[2:24:02] I mean
[2:24:03] um had to take Faith to get out that
[2:24:08] boat it had to take Faith to get out
[2:24:11] that boat but for Jesus to say you you
[2:24:15] have little faith
[2:24:18] it went back to what brother Smiler was
[2:24:19] saying you know it's really all
[2:24:21] dependent upon uh your your success or
[2:24:25] your failures depending upon one thing
[2:24:28] what are you looking
[2:24:30] at and when Peter took his eyes off of
[2:24:34] Jesus CU his faith was when he had his
[2:24:36] eyes on Jesus he could and even just the
[2:24:39] word come you know I'm thinking myself
[2:24:41] How would how did Peter just move out
[2:24:44] just simply on that if you if it be you
[2:24:47] then B me come how did he just move out
[2:24:48] on
[2:24:49] come I I believe the reason they was
[2:24:52] able to do is because the
[2:24:56] voice that spoke
[2:24:59] come was a very familiar voice to Peter
[2:25:03] and he said that got to be the same God
[2:25:05] that you know that that that has been
[2:25:06] walking with me talking to me I'm going
[2:25:08] I'm going to trust him and it it took
[2:25:09] Faith to get out that
[2:25:12] boat but when he begin to sink he say oh
[2:25:15] ye of little faith it's because he took
[2:25:16] his Eyes Off Of God whatever you do
[2:25:20] today I want to encourage you put your
[2:25:21] eyes back on Christ and keep walking
[2:25:24] keep moving
[2:25:25] forward amen no matter what the
[2:25:27] circumstance no matter what the
[2:25:29] situation it'll bring you through you
