don't have any written praise reports but praise reports are very very important sometimes we don't it's a testimony somebody has been through a test I remember Sister Zelma getting up and she was is testifying when she made mention that if God could hear our prayers for us the Johnson family over in Dubai he could hear her prayer during that time we weren't happy but when you hear that somebody else was encouraged and got faith to overcome their test and their trial then you can shout hallelujah so it's very important to give your testimony don't matter how big or how small God is God and he moved in your life so we want to give him praise amen thank God for not breaking my glasses Hallelujah uh sister Zelma writes uh I'm asking the church to pray for my brother his name is Jerry Taylor he fell yesterday and broke his hip he's already in a nursing facility and we seen the hand of God move on him and he was back up walking from a stroke he had last year I know the devil wants to take his life but I claim my family for the kingdom of God that they are saved so the token is applied I truly believe through every sermon that has been taught that this is the year of restoration it's been too many testimonies that has that has been coming forth to get discouraged I know God is able to do exceeding abundantly above all I ask or thank you amen I believe that if you believe Give the Lord a hand clap of Praise hallelujah amen he's a Healer savior deliverer restorer and more than that amen praise the Lord so that's the only prayer request we have I haven't seen brother quu but I believe he's back in his States and the Lord has brought him back home safe so we want to thank the Lord for that amen can I have the announcement sister praise the lord we have three birthdays coming

come God bless you I'm getting over cold so please bear with me um I just want to explain this song I actually wrote this song last year um and it came from something that I was feeling that I know many uh Christians feel as well as children of God sometimes we feel that we're not loved by God that um we've messed up too much anything you know feelings of discouragement feelings of doubt and um you know sometimes the devil will use those times when you're feeling that way to speak all types of Lies into your mind um and you know the word of God but sometimes you're just so discouraged but um I wrote this song from a standpoint of you have to know that the word of God is your ultimate absolute no matter what you're feeling it's not the truth the word of God is your truth so hope it's a blessing I'm feeling weak I can't talk I can't see do you still hear me oh I'm down on my knees God you promised me that you would never leave so why do I feel so lonely feelings lie that's the fact of life you are all that I need I can't deny but God in emotions I can't see your devotion you God no matter what I see and even now I choose to believe you might feel down like you won't turn around you wear us M but inside is tough around but God sees you way you are with your doubts and with your scars tell his know he isn't very far and no feelings Li that's the fact of life he is all that you need you can do Li the C in emotions you won't see his devotion he is God no matter what you see so even now please choose to believe choose is that God knows the way that we feel he knows that we sometimes doubt and can't feel that he is always near in our fear and in our Che so please turn a little Sun ear and no feelings lie that's a fact of life he is all that we need we can't deny the C in emotions we can't see his devotion he is God no matter what we see and even now we choose even now we choose all feelings they right that of facts our life here is all that I need I can't Den now but God in emotions I can't see your devotion you are God no matter what I see and even now I choose to believe yes you're God no matter what we see and even now we choose to believe [Music] [Applause]

have people uh um we we we we put down um where we come from all right I can put it that way it's the grace of God that brought us to the Revelation that we have but everything that you went through back there wasn't bad it did introduce you to the Lord right and some of those things can be a blessing you know if you just allow it to be a blessing to you praise the Lord and man some of the young people y'all don't y'all y'all didn't go through any of that back there but that's that's part of our our our history that's that's where we come from and and and sometime I don't mind going back and just touching it just a little bit praise God praise God that was that was the Baptist Church Hallelujah see then we would we when you go to the Pentecost Church they they didn't use a lot of hymns actually the songs that they wrote didn't have any verses uh it was just simply just a couple words put together that's right and uh and we just took off singing that's right praise the Lord amen um

watch too much online but I did today and I saw um uh some comments coming from sister fulford and I believe that is uh brother maris's grandmother amen we want want to say God bless you and uh we looking forward to seeing you in person sister fford amen God bless you God bless you amen but uh our thought today is going on the offense and um you know I just like the way that the Lord uh aligns things amen uh the way he he just he does it he does all things well uh in his own timing and uh what I what I I noticed is that as we were uh entering into this uh sermon I knew it was coming and I was just waiting waiting waiting there were a couple things the Lord began to do one was a sermon that brother Mark preached where he said it's time to fight and I knew that was a confirmation and then um you know and then on in our Wednesday night uh Bible study we've been going through Ephesians 6 and we're currently talking about that that armor of God amen and I believe that the Holy Ghost aligns things so perfectly like that and just even on this Wednesday we were talking about having your feet shot uh with the preparation of the gospel of peace and just a little note that I had in my Bible uh what that means is the uh there's it means eagerness that comes from the gospel of peace that having your feet sha with the preparation of the Gospel peace is an eagerness that comes from the gospel of peace and they said the Roman soldier would wear special shoes called uh calay right and and they put the calay on the feet and the reason that they wore these shoes is that these shoes enabled them to advance against the enemy and I like that definition because when you're going on the offense you're not backing up from the enemy like we read last week there's no jumping back when the devil say boo no we say boo back and that devil begins to get smaller and smaller and smaller and notice the thing that in the dream the man only use his mouth amen and his boo was whatever the word of God said right he going going to only repeat what the word say it's let me let me just say this it's okay to tell us your problem Hallelujah but we know that you also have the solution on the inside of you so we want to hear your solution don't just end with just what the problem is tell us what the word of God say concerning your problem praise the Lord that way we can touch and agree with you on what the word say hallelujah hallelujah let me just uh inject this uh you know brother Quinton sto me this morning just to tell me something he was just listening to Service uh there and brother brother Benny per was preaching in in London at brother brother gw's and brother Benny Perry was preaching on a sermon um um kind of kind of being ready for when inspiration strikes right when inspiration strikes you got to be ready you got to be ready to speak something so uh you know as they were he was going on he say the Holy Spirit just kind of told him uh he's like well what would I ask for if inspiration struck me what would I ask for he says he didn't he's like I don't know what to really ask for so start going through little things I mean things in his life that he might want he said no no I don't want to ask for me I want to ask for somebody else then start thinking about different people in the church he said maybe I ask this for them he said no I got to go further than that he says I got to think about the whole church as a whole He if I if if inspiration was to strike me I'm going to ask God for a church and a school yes sir and you see if you abide in me and my words abide in you then ask what you will right so the inspiration struck so he asked for I say I touch and agree with you and I'm believing God we going to get it but this this this this this preparation of the gospel of peace you have to have a eagerness amen an an eagerness uh to advance against the enemy right and the Christian must have on his feet or possess a sense of eagerness or a willingness to Advance against the devil and I and I like this take the fight to him you know the devil don't have no problem bringing a fight to you he brought one to me this week I wasn't expecting that he hit me my car got got had all kind of I took it for one thing and had three or four problems I said well Leisa and and and and brother Frankie being a mechanic I was running some things by him he said brother I actually thought after I had it fixed and and I paid for it I say I said brother I wasn't expecting all that he says brother I thought it was going to be an engine failure I said oh well uh if it ain't engine failure and I got something to be grateful for and I my attitude shifted and I began to be uh more uh thankful than actually complaining about how much I had to spend the devil didn't have no problem bringing the the the battle to me and I didn't have no problem coming right back with part two of this sermon today brother we advance against the enemy right Glory you better get out of our way we coming after you devil hey hallelujah amen amen amen it says that to the willingness to advance against the devil and take the fight to him such eagerness Amen to contend with Satan comes from the gospel of peace amen the gospel gives peace to the believer freeing him from anxiety now what what gives you freedom from anxiety is the word of God it frees him from anxiety like my my daughter say don't don't trust your feelings trust the word y your feelings change like the weather that's right praise the Lord amen and and and you can't trust this Florida weather especially this time of year my you you get rain and and the rain is is it might be raining here but it's not raining there and all you need to do is just switch positions and you won't get drowned in rain come on somebody amen or actually the floorida rain it only last like this so if you can just endure it just for a little bit you'll see the sun shine again yes hallelujah amen but it says uh they said here such eagerness to contend with Satan comes from the gospel of peace the gospel gives peace to the believer freeing him from anxiety through the advance of uh uh though he advances against such a powerful opponent amen hallelujah so we we got this this feat sharp of the preparation of the gospel of peace I'mma go to a quote out of the fundamental foundation for Faith but you know yeah let's let's just go there for right now uh and I want to read this to you brother Brandon makes a statement he says if you want to go back a little further it says just as far as historical you could see it says um you can see the word in the beginning was the word but what is the word it says a word is a thought manifested a thought spoken forth God first he perceived the thought and spoke it and meant become a word and the word became material and it says so everything that God has spoke in his word received into the right channel received into the right channel everything that God has spoken his word if it's received into the right channel then it will materialize that word for whatever the promise behind it is now you know this is important to me because when brother Frankie just kind of sent me that text and say brother I thought this was when you text me what the problem was I thought it could have been engine failure and I'm thinking engine failure I'm not getting ready to put no new engine in my truck I'm going have to go buy another truck and I just paid this thing off I don't want to buy no another truck truck right so engine F I said Lord I Thank you but see the thing of it is is um I was complaining about how much money I had to spend on it but but not realizing that the god that allowed me to spend the money is able to give me back the money because I'm under restoration not losses come on church right so so so so but but in order to to reach restoration my attitude got to be right see before before the word can be man manifested to you amen before it be materialized it's got to be received into the right channel that mean your attitude got to be adjusted amen your attitude got to be right in order for God's promise to be fulfilled in your life oh Hallelujah I thank God for this it says whatever promise behind it behind it is God will do it he's obligated to it can I say that again it says uh the he the uh the god it everything that God has spoken his word Reed into the right channel will materialize that word for whatever the promise behind it is God will do it he's obligated to it Hallelujah I say Amen then if you abide in me and my word abide in you then you have God the word in you and you believe the word just as you believe God because it is God and it's Inseparable then if you have God's word in you you have God's life in you you have God in you and whatever God's word speaks forth out uhoh I don't know if we catching I'm trying to slow down here the prophet is telling us that we have God in us we have his word in us he's he ain't coming he's already here yes sir come come on Church he's already here I don't have to wait for a special feeling because God already dwells on the inside of me amen I know his word is already in me right so he says and whatever God's word speaks forth out of you whatever his word speaks forth out of you it'll have to come to pass just like it was spoke from God and I I I serve a God the god that dwells inside of me is the same God that spoke at the beginning when he saw nothing when he felt nothing praise God he was looking at emptiness everywhere but in order to change the situation that God said let there be praise God that's the god that's living inside of you all you got to do is open your mouth say the same thing he said let there be praise God let there be healing Let There Be Deliverance Let There Be Freedom Let There Be praise His holy name let there be a restoration of my finances Let There Be customers Let There Be clients Let There Be H praise God hallelujah hallelujah amen Church you have God in you yes and whatever God's word speaks forth out of you it'll have to come to pass why why has to come to it's just like it was spoke from God hallelujah hallelujah and the prophet goes and puts it right back in Scripture it says Jesus said whatever you ask the father in my name that will I do did you ever realize what that means did you realize guys if we go before God In The Name of Jesus it's just the same as Jesus himself praying yes sir yes sir it isn't me praying anymore if I come in his name and he recognizes his name and Jesus said whatever you ask the father in my name that I do and then I I go to the father in Jesus name it isn't me praying anymore it's jesusall it's his Spirit praying through me and then I've got to receive Hallelujah it don't matter how long it take I got to receive it do you know when God said let there be light the Bible only records one thing after he said let there be light the Bible records there was light but the prophet told us that it could have took millions of years before light came but the God we serve when he spoke it he stopped well actually he never even started he didn't worry about what he said you can't speak it and then start worrying as the weather's going to come to pass that's not the way God operates when God said let there be he just went to start working on something else sir sir because God believed his own word and if that God is living inside of you it's time for you to believe the word of God that is in you yes sir yes sir this going Beyond believe it and receive it I'm telling you it's already in you the secret is you want to know the secret the secret is the word is in the blood and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with his word yes [Applause] sir brother it's going on this is offens of material amen we're going on the offense so here the prophet goes on it says uh whatever you ask the father my name that I do and then I then I go to the father in Jesus name it isn't me praying anymore it's Jesus is his Spirit praying through me and then I got to receive what I asked for because he said it and it's God's Own word it can't do nothing else but produce just what it said amen says so then we we believe that we are this is the confidence that we have in God that we get what we ask for now he's quoting another scripture out of John this is the confidence as that we have the confidence we have in God that we get what we ask for we get the church we get the school we get the healing we get the Deliverance amen and and and can I put it this way cuz brother Brandon preached the me he well he might have preached the message called Deliverance but what I'm in what the one that I'm thinking right now that he preached he said total so we're not selling for partway deliverance can I go can I say it like this I'm happy to see you in church come on but you got a little further to go we going to get you into Christ I mean all the way buried deep into Christ hallu I'm happy to see you online and you streaming all the services but we want to get you bued deep Hallelujah into Christ yes sir you become a pillar in the church a rock in the church come on somebody every time the church doors open you there amen all right Hallelujah one of the prayer warriors in the church amen amen amen all right let me let me go and finish this quote says so then we believe that we are this is a confidence we have in God that we get what we asked for for he's God and cannot take back his word and that's even a word that's coming out of you God can't take that back amen it says uh cannot take back his word he's got to stay with his word so then if you abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will and it'll be given unto you isn't that simple it says Faith created we was made for that purpose y'all get that what what we talking about we were actually created to do this yes sir yes sir let I'm I'mma go I'm going read the rest of this quote I'm going tell you why we're not doing it amen and the rest of the quote says this we was made for that purpose then through the fall why we was taken away from that then in Redemption we was brought back to do it again yes Lord hallelujah and the only thing that hindered the human race today from being Superior and controlling like they did in the beginning is because that the power lines of the outlet of God made in the human being has been clogged up oh I read that and got a little I I got up set with the devil it's time my power lines have been clogged up any of y'all ever had a clogged up sink or tub or something like that and it just it the the if the tub get clogged up S sisters go through this all the time because sometime the hair get in there y'all know I'm telling the truth you a got to say amen I I I know it's the truth hair get it all CL even in the sink hair ha hair everywhere get everything clogged up come on somebody and and you got to get special uh uh stuff to pour into that in order to break it all down and once once you pour whether it's Drano or whatever it is you pour it in there and just let it sit it has a way of just breaking down all these chemicals and a amen the chemicals break all the stuff down and before you know it's all running smooth again Hallelujah the Holy Ghost has been coming into the church with the message The transformational Power of Love breaking down things oh I I know what I'm talking about walls are being broke down by the power of love amen the transformative Power of Love things are being broken down and and when things are being broke down then that's when things start running smoothly again the gifts can run smoothly again when we got the line the power lines free yes sir amen thank you Lord all right I was made for this you was made for this it's been God's plan all along so here we got to understand that we've been under attack by the enemy that's why the scripture tells us amen the kingdom of of of God the Kingdom of Heaven been suffering violence it's been under attack but the violent have to take it by force that mean the devil ain't just going to give give this to you you going have to do something to go get what belongs to you am I was looking at this amen scripture and uh I went to my Greek Lexicon this is a scripture that I've heard for years but I've never preached it before and um and and like I said when brother Mark Struck it in the sermon said okay that's my release I got to go and and now I can I can preach it it was it was it was it was something you know for me that Wednesday night and um you know so I went started looking at this and I wanted to look and see what the theologians had to say Let me let me let me just I need to just Coast a little bit I'm trying to I'm trying to let me just look at a couple things here before I get yeah all right I think I can I can go here all right so I I went to look at what theologians said what different people might on the internet might have had to say about it and then uh I also uh just went into a little meditation on it myself just just thinking about this scripture and um you know when when I clicked in the Greek Lexicon like it's very confusing that it was say the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence but the violent take it by force it seemed a little confusing amen but let's just look at it and and see if we can get some of there when I looked in the Greek Lexicon when that that suffereth violence it says that it's uh that means that they are applying Force to us right they're inflicting violence on God's people now you can look at there's there's so many scriptures where you can see go back to Daniel and aliance then there was force right the Hebrew boys being cast into a man a fire furnace they they they suffered Force I mean Jesus going to a cross it was it was force I mean and and even today we're all we all suffer from something amen people don't like this Christian Life some of y'all been ostracized by your families they don't even like when you come around they can't wait for you to leave that's when they can crank up the music that's when they can pull out their weed sir that's right right they all they drinks that they want to drink they hate when you come and and they just be under their breath when when she going to leave your your testimony bring too much light in the midst of all that darkness and and it used to be a time they wouldn't even drink in front of you but now they getting more and bold Hallelujah if the devil can get bold then we as Believers can also get bold yes sir let me tell you brother and sister I don't care what they situation don't let them bring that stuff to your house sir when God bless you at that house tell them they can't drink there and they can't smoke there and and and are y'all married are y'all married if you ain't married you ain't sleeping here either you going to have to find a hotel somewhere that's right that would condone that lifestyle but here we don't we don't do that here sir no sir you don't see me sleeping with nobody you ain't going to do it here either no sir amen all right amen church but but but but we got they apply for us they apply Force trying to amen even in peer pressure to the young people that's an application of force to try to force you into something don't don't don't don't fall for that see the kingdom of God suffer violence Force they apply Force but here you know uh when it say that the violent take it by force who are these violent in in the in in the Hebrew lexicon it's it's the strong the violent ones that take it by force these are the strong ones my God these are the forceful ones amen you got to be strong in the word know your position in the word amen and you can kind of stand up against no you ain't going to do that not today Satan see that's a strong one that's a force one no I ain't taking that right no I'm not going to stand with that no no no no I'mma take this thing by force yes sir Hallelujah them Hebrew boys amen they can take it by force no say look look look look look look look look let let me tell you something we know our God is is able to deliver us but but but we but we we want to be on record King that if he don't if he don't deliver it's not that he can't it's just his choice that he didn't but we know that our God we ain't never seen nobody get delivered from no fire we never heard no trial like this but we know that our God that we serve is more than capable of delivering us from your fire yes sir I can just see them tell that fell he say oh y'all talking you don't know you don't know who you talking to yeah we know who we talking to you ain't nothing but a man well I heated it up seven times harder it ain't hard enough put it 14 or 15 if you want to it ain't hard enough for us and Them Boys knew what that God was able to do they say but if he don't they were forceful they were strong if he don't we still not going to bow down to you tie these fellas up get my strongest men tie them up and and they begin to Usher him down into the Fire King didn't realize because he heated the fire seven times harder it did not affect the Hebrew boys but his strong men died never even going in the fire just around the fire and they died Lord and when they get inside seven times hotter my Lord how could they I mean the the they measuring with the temperature whatever seven times and they get in and these boys just walking around and manall Lord just in there dancing and and and worshiping and praising God and King look like what is going on these boys should be dead by now and I'm telling that's the way the devil feel about you you should have been wiped out by now how many accidents you done had and you done walked away from all of them praise God that the devil don't realize he can't touch you till God says here they are in the fire and just dancing and worshiping and pray and he said now this is this is UN this is just unbeliev they should been dead by now my God God looked into the fire and said now now I'm having a math problem my like my daughter say the math I know I can count how many y'all throw in there three we know there three three Hebrew boys that went in well why when I look inside this fire now I need you to understand he didn't show up before they got in the fire he he didn't show up while they were standing Amen in front of the king he could have yes sir but you understand the testimony is greater because he showed up in the fire not out the fire the testimony get greater because he shows up with whatever you going through and when he showed up in the fire they said now I count four and one of them looks like now when did he ever see the son of man but one of them look like the son of man I don't understand what's going on here they all come out the fire unhinged didn't even Smell Smoke on them no impact no effect that's when you make the devil upset that everything he I'm through in your direction yes sir you got a Hallelujah anyhow never never let your problems get you down whenl problems come your way hold your head up Hallelujah y'all got to understand when when a songwriter put something like that together they said I'm going through a lot but Hallelujah the strong forceful resilient these are the violent right now I was uh looking at something because the theologians as I was looking through they they just not in Harmony on the definition of the scripture that we're referring to in Matthew uh 11 and and 12 now I'm going to say a couple things I read verse 11 for a reason because I do want to read a quote for that verse 11 it said verily I say unto you among them that are born of women they're not risen or greater than John the Baptist notwithstanding he that is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he so uh thank you my brother it is Florida uh but I I did find a a gentleman that was that wrote something in a in a website daily word for all about this scripture that I I like one of the statements that he made and it says uh in Matthew 11:12 says and from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of God suffer violence and the violent take it by force the Bible verse records the violent take it by force it means that entering God's kingdom takes courage it's takes unwavering faith it takes determination and it takes endurance see weeping may endure for night but joy going to come in the morning you got to endure through the night sometimes right it says determination and endurance and it says examples in the Bible that illustrates the meaning of this verse Jacob held God tightly and forcefully saying I will not let you go unless you bless me and he got his Blessing right j j j i mean J no I got to use some Force here I'm not going to Turn You Loose you going have to do something for me before I let you go he was Ser he was serious right and we got to we got to get down to business with God another example amen they say the woman that had an incurable condition with the issue of blood and I like this this this woman she was suffering but but but the violent take it by force she was in a situation with her blood condition Jesus actually could not come and touch her the priest had wrote certain laws God gave them laws and the priest could not touch the the ladies in that condition nobody could touch them they couldn't even sit where they were sitting they had to stay away from him but this lady say now I know the law say he can't touch me all right but the law does not say that I can't touch him and by force do y'all see that lady by four she moved this one out the way and for 12 years she had this condition she moved that one out the way and she she was crawling underneath legs and doing all kind of things she said now he can't touch me I can't get him to come to my house but I'm going he passing by my way and I ain't going to let this opportunity pass me I don't don't care who got what to say you ain't got my condition you ain't dealing with I what I'm dealing with I I'm going to touch him today no strength no nothing but she pressed her way and she came behind the Lord Jesus and just touched the him of His Garment and walked away she said mission accomplished Lord she went on the offense she said mission accomplished and turned and walked away but had no IDE idea that it was going to stop the possessional line Jesus stopped and say wait a minute it it interrupted everything he was doing who touched me yes sir and Peter amen rebuked them how you going to say who touch you you see all these people around you everybody here touching you even I'm touching you no Peter that ain't what I'm talking about you just somebody people just touching me just to touch me but somebody touched me with a need yes amen amen who touched me and he looked around and say virtuous left me I got to find out who touched looked around and he saw the lady running away say sister your faith your willingness your eagerness that has made you whole and no longer you going to have to deal with that condition You' been made whole from this time for that lady got her healing because she was willing to be violent yes sir she was willing to be forceful yes sir another example that they gave is even blind barus was asked to keep quiet but he refused crying out the more Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me see the violent take it by force he took his healing everybody saying man hush he can't hear you louder and louder he got his faith get louder sir and that was the last miracle that Jesus was going to perform before he went to the Cross amen hallelujah we don't know when our last moment going to be let's take advantage of every moment we have here you know uh I I looked in the emphatic diglot and let's bring up uh verse 11 and 12 again there on the screen Matthew 11 uh 11 and 12 uh you can read on the screen but I'm going to read it amen out of the emphatic diaglot it says indeed I say to you among those born of women there has not risen a greater than John the bapt John the immerser and because baptism is by immersion it's not sprinkling baptism has to be by immersion and and and it's just like Jesus went into the heart of Earth for 3 days you go into that water for 3 seconds Jesus rose to New Life when you rise from the water you rise in a new life yes sir and you start walking in new life amen amen amen great and John Johnny merer yet the least in the Kingdom of Heaven is superior to him then the next verse says and from the days of John the immerser till now the Kingdom of Heaven has been forcibly assell and the violent sees it so you know when I looked at that word a sell the the kingdom of God has been forcefully saell it means the kingdom of God has been attacked or strongly criticized the kingdom of God has been strongly criticized well I think we live in a time period where we have seen the kingdom of God strongly criticized forcibly a sell but but but here's the thing hey amen the violent sees it the violent take it by force that mean we ain't got to take everything people say amen sometimes you get to a point where that's enough glory to God you done said enough now it's time for me to speak all right but we done been attack on every hand amen and you know all kind of stuff out there about this message I I and it only well it only came out in the fourth generation it only came out then this did not happen years ago it there was a spirit that was released in this day sir and you got to understand that same Spirit happened way back in in Moses day when they came to the fourth generation they got to a spot where they did not even know who God was they didn't even know who God was I mean the thing the things they saw in the days of Moses in the days of Joshua it was all past tense but they didn't know that he was the same yesterday today and forever right right but we see that same Spirit released today young people watch it don't sir look if you was living in the days of brother brandom you would have never approached him with your foolishness Lord when the man can tell you every you you had on this yesterday you was doing this and you was thinking this yeah you would never approach him with that foolishness you knew that you were standing in the presence of God God was fail in a man you didn't you didn't approach that you didn't come and know you know look even the even the brothers in Chicago knew 400 preachers right and you by your you by yourself you got something to say 400 preachers knew better than to say anything right amen and he stood there he said now now now look uh and Bo the Holy Ghost is is a power they got a trap set for you what I came to a meeting I'm here to help the people they got a trap set for you what's this trap Lord they got a question on your Doctrine they going question about this question about that told him so he can be prepared and he said now and and also they got a room that they prepared to do this in but they not going to be able to get that room it's going to have to be over this room this room this room and and and then this person going to be sitting here this person going to be sitting here brother Brandon went and told the man that invited him say he first he tried to set him up he said brother why don't you uh take my place and speak for me tomorrow said no I can't do that brother brand say Brother come on just help me out this time brother brand just setting them up please Brother come on help me out no I can't do it brother Brandon I can't do it he said he said I'm going tell you why you can't do it cuz they got a trap set for me tomorrow he said in the place that y'all had to y'all had to arrange to get this meeting at y'all not going to be able to get it y'all have to move it to this place and when we get there so and so going to be sitting here this one going to be sitting there this going to be sitting in and he said no we had this thing for for a year ain't no way brother BR said you'll see got a telephone call we double booked we can't let y'all have the room and say what say uh he said everything brother Brandon told him came to pass just like that yes sir and the man walked into the room and looked and saw everybody s he said oh I know some of y'all got something against brother random on this Doctrine but I'mma just tell you something everything that has happened this morning this man just told me it was gonna happen now if y'all got a problem with him be my guest but I'm just telling you everything the man said has come to pass and if God can show the man who going to be sitting here and the place going to be canceled and this going to happen that you think you think God that that's that small that he would also show this man the revelation of the word come on no you that God ain't that small your mind is that small your thinking is that small your flesh is that small yes sir amen but not the God we serve this message has been thoroughly Vindicated God himself Vindicated it we ain't got to vindicate no message it's already Vindicated right brother brandom say look I tell you what I God already told me y'all had a trap set before me any brother just just bring this yeah bring this bring your Bible this is why we can say to you the message that we believe comes from this we can show it to you here right amen amen now use this to disprove it I'mma go back to my scriptures now don't make me go back cuz I I I I we're suffering violent but now a violent getting ready to take it by force Jesus said that Elijah was coming uhuh and he restore all things yes sir but I say to you Elijah is already come and they did them what whatever they they desired that's what Jesus said and then the disciples understood he was talking of John the Baptist understood which one one was John the Baptist because Jesus spoke of two different Elijah one that would come and restore yes sir and then uh what's that act say uh to the restitution of all things John the Baptist is already gone right sir so all things were still coming yes sir so John I mean here the scripture said the restitution of all things it didn't happen in John the Baptist day this happened after Christ true so there's another message that comes after Christ according to the Bible right amen so now if you going to tell me John the Baptist was the one that fulfilled that Matthew scripture you know my question what that John the Baptist restore and if you ain't got no answer your Doctrine is false yes sir exactly right the kingdom of God has been suffering violence but the violent today are taking it by force yes sir your Doctrine is false and you need to repent of that Spirit yes sir evil Spirit yes sir [Music] amen let me read a quote real quick and I I'm I'm I forgot to start my time so I know I'm a little overtime but that's okay CU that there's more to this let me read a quote out of influence the scripture said there had not been one greater than John the Baptist but the least in the Kingdom of Heaven is superior to him look at this in the message influence brother random says what did John the Baptist do the man that Jesus said there was never a man born of woman like him or could compare with him there's no one can compare to him until that time now I I'll just give it away real quick so you a got to be too you got to try to let just blow your mind why was John the Baptist acknowledged by Jesus that there was none born among women that was like him why because John had the specific responsibility of introducing Christ at his first coming now Jesus says there is another one where the spirit of Elijah is going to come and restore all things so until that time there was not one born like John the Baptist nobody that could compare until that time right now we're dealing with the second coming of the Lord and as John the Baptist the angel said as John the Baptist amen was sent his message was ident was to identify the first coming he was the Forerunner of the first coming of Christ your message will forerun the second coming of Christ so now we have a prophet that could be compared to John the Baptist ooh because his ministry according to the angel is to allow him to introduce Christ sir we not following something blind we know exactly where we are and we're not just serving a god of History our God is the same yesterday today and forever let me finish reading this all right what did John the Baptist do the man that that Jesus said there was never a man born of a woman like him or could compare with him until that time the great prophet ordained of God before the foundational World spoke of 127 years before he ever come on or 712 years rather before he came to the Earth by the prophet Isaiah here what did he do when he seen a man come walking down out of the audience amen and he looked up above and saw that fire coming down from heaven in the form of a dove he cried out I have need to be baptized Of Thee I must decrease he must increase God can't have two on the earth at the same time only one has the message you know I must decrease he is the messenger I've been up to this time now he takes my place as Elisha when Elijah went up and throw back his robe to Elisha his ministry was finished Elisha must take up where he left off he must increase I must decrease John the Baptist there was a lot said in that quote the types that he gave Sir were a little different than what we were expecting because the increase and decrease that John was talking about he was talking about Christ I must decrease so Christ can increased brother brandom did the same thing he decreased Christ increased but in this quote he showed he said like Elisha and Elijah well who is Elijah Elijah is the prophet that brings the word and restores us even in the book of Kings Elijah was the one that restored the worship they were worshiping Idol gods and then he had to go in the office with him and say uh choose you this day whom you going to the god that answer by fire let him be God he said let that God be God said we tired of this bail thing going on let he got bold yes sir right he said now let let let let that let the god that answer by fire be God get your altars all set up and when when they got the altar set up he said you know what man they went all day long cutting themselves and doing all kind of crazy things trying to get their God to respond they bleeding all all he said y'all just get back all y'all just stand to the side and he and he he say he said now Lord I come here according to your word let them see that restoration is coming through this ministry amen yes sir he said Lord send your fire down I've done everything I prepared the altar the way amen that you want to prepared now let the fire come down and fire came down and consumed everything not just Elijah's aler alar but also the altar Bell consumed everything proving that God was God sir Amen brother random say now that that spirit that was on Elijah falls on Elisha Elisha types can I mean let me let me make it very clear Elisha does not type Jesus Elijah was the first prophet that came but then he his anointing settled on Elisha and Elisha does not type Jesus Elisha types you you are the Elisha we had an Elijah but now we're looking for Elija and Elisha carries a double anointing you think if I got a double anointing I'm going to run from Devils no I'm going on the offense I got I got twice as much power brother I tell you the truth I I feel like I've been eating spinach and I I I feel like my my muscles are popping out like papy Brother anytime papey got just a little bit of spinach Bruno was spish I don't care how many times Bruno said boo when Papa got some spinach it was over and I feel like the bride has been getting the word the vitamin for her soul yes sir causing us to go on the offense we recognizing who we are my God Amen let me try to uh find I got I got a lot here a lot and I can't preach at all so let me just get something where I can slip out here today go to this mage Is possessing all things you say brother brandom I need healing hold on one second Lord Jesus that's all right I'm yeah I'll just read this there's some other things I got here that I

talk but they playing with a little something and you take it away from them they just walk up they kind of look at you a little and they ease up on you now when they easing up in their mind they they can easing up on for a purpose but when when they just going to get right up close to you and they see you talking and doing all kind of stuff and but they got their mind on one thing that thing you took from me I ain't forgot about that you need to tell the devil I ain't forgot about that no I ain't forgot about that ease up on that devil and when you get your hand just reach [Applause] out just walk on way this it was mine in the first place and I dare you to try to take it back I'm getting ready to read the rest of this quote if there's some things that belong directly to you that the devil done took from you it's time for you to take it back you know when when when uh when when David went out the battle you can lower that just for a second I'm going come back to in a second he went out the battle and he he actually fighting with the Enemy he's on he's on the Philistine side he had to play Crazy to even get into the army Lord y'all y'all got me way out here you playing crazy in order

there and and and and and when he done did all this to get into the army they get to a situation now uh this one this this battle a little different other battles we don't mind you fighting but this one why because we getting ready to go against your people and we don't know if you might change your mind in battle it's going to be hard for you to kill your brother it's going to be hard for you to kill your uncle and and now when you see that you going to turn and now you're going to start fighting against us so it's going to be best that you don't even go to battle send them send them home him and say well what have we done we we've been honest we've been good well no we we realize we we you ain't done nothing wrong but we just can't send you out to this battle David was going back home and

discouraging David amongst all them Warriors sometime you can be amongst everybody and find yourself alone but when you find alone in the midst of everybody you got to do what David did David reached around with his hand and slapped his own back the Bible say he encouraged himself in the Lord amen I don't know how I'm going get this but I'mma get it I don't know I don't know what's going to happen

tracks let's just follow the tracks they start following they get they get they get they going they going they going the next thing you know they see this one little fellow been laid there for dead now you know what I'm going say it like this God allowed that man to get deadly sick so he could be the Spy that's right to let them know where the where the Army was and David found this little man now he could barely talk when they got him they so they had to give him a little nourishment give him some food give him some water about three days they just sitting there nourishing that fell and

something you done no sir it's the unmarried gift that God gave us and it's ours it belongs to us Satan cannot hold it if you go to him in the scriptural authoritative word with faith to say it's mine lay it down yes sir and if I abide in him Hallelujah and his worried about in me and I can ask what I will and it's got to be done [Music] hallelujah look at this it's the unmerited gift that God gave

from me you give it back because I'm serving notice on you I got the notice written right here on the word Heaven and Earth will pass away but this notice shall not so I come with this notice to serve on you that Jesus Christ said whatsoever I ask the father in his name he'll give it to me and here's the other thing about that when I'm saying it in Jesus name in The Name Of The Lord Lord Jesus Christ when I'm using that type of language it's just as if Jesus himself was saying it I'm going say it like this I can't think of one prayer that God denied Jesus even in the garden he didn't deny him Jesus came to the point where he realized that this was greater right amen so he had to come and say Lord he stopped asking at some point he said Lord not my will but your will be done am amen now when it come to my children I know that's the will of God for when it come to my health I know that's the will of God now uh that car you looking for that Maybach you might not need a Maybach and if God ain't bless you with that why don't you just pray Lord not my will but thy will be done you don't need a Maybach you need a Mazda you took it from me you give it back because I'm serving notice of you I got this notice written right here on the word heavens and earth will pass away but this notice shall not so I come with this notice to serve you to serve on you that Jesus Christ said whatsoever I ask the father in his name he'll give it to me if I say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in my heart but believe that what I said shall come to pass I can have what I say it lay it down that gets him started don't and he said this don't get him started gets him running if you just resist the devil he'll flee lay it down as you running out of here lay it down because I have come with the scriptural Authority I'm a Believer you get it yes sir am yes sir it's going on the offense time church I'm expecting God to do all that he has promised that he will do and can't no devil stop it open up your mouth and speak now you got to watch when inspiration strike you got to be ready Hallelujah and just release it out of your mouth just like God released it out of his mouth how it's going to come to pass a that ain't my business ain't my business all I know like y'all saw the a plant was moved that's because we're not planted here but when we get to where we rooted and planted we won't move no more and won't nobody else move our stuff no more either everything will be right where it need to be we not planted here let that be a signed to you just like the plant move

other things on the side I'm a teacher I am a teacher he says but I do so many other things on the side that I don't have to depend on the income so I'd be willing to volunteer my time in order to see that go to come to fruition I'm talking about people outside that want to be a part of this and you telling me uh you you you're telling me devil going to try to block block what God got for us nuh-uh

and I'm not taking that back that's right I won't take it back now I also believe we might have to give a down payment before we get it free and clear amen amen so that ain't taking away from the free and clear that's just taking a little out of your pocketbook amen all right we ain't got the money in the bank for nothing God blessed us with the money for a purpose and and as we give that's how the blessing comes back to us give and it shall be given how is it going to be given y'all don't know the Bible y'all don't know no Bible y'all don't know the Bible y'all ain't quoting scripture now y'all

put some more on top and and press that down then the Bible say I'm trying to move some stuff around to get you more blessings shake and then on top of that it's time for the Overflow and look at this shall men give into your bosom for with the same measure that you meet with all so if you're going to hold it in your pocket then you can't give God an opportunity to bless you we going to have a church free and clear we're going to have that but God didn't have us raise the money for no reason amen that's part of the blessing too yes sir your giving is part of the blessing the Overflow
