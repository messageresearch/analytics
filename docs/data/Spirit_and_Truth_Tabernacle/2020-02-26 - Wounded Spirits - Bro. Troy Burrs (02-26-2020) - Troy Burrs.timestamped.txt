[0:13] forty-two man Psalms 42 just a real good
[0:21] study the word a man
[0:31] some sorta to the first chapter will be
[0:34] reading first through the third chapter
[0:41] amen
[0:43] it reads as the heart penneth after the
[0:49] water Brooks so Paneth my soul after the
[0:53] O God my soul thirsts for God for the
[1:01] Living God when shall I come to appear
[1:06] before God my tears have been my meet
[1:11] day and night while they continually say
[1:14] unto me where is thy God amen
[1:20] you may be seated made a lord at a
[1:22] blessing to the reading of his word amen
[1:32] last time I was before you I think it
[1:35] was last Wednesday I was sharing on how
[1:41] how antibiotics and different
[1:45] medications and different things you
[1:48] there's a certain weight you have to
[1:52] follow the prescription if it's going to
[1:53] do you any good and sometimes we get
[1:57] physically sick in our bodies and
[2:00] different things let nature and we go to
[2:04] the doctor and the doctor will prescribe
[2:09] him do it run some tests a man said well
[2:14] I'll see what's wrong what's wrong with
[2:16] you
[2:17] a man and and and and and that's kind of
[2:20] you know what God is doing you know when
[2:23] our life there's certain things that
[2:24] happen certain trials and tribulations
[2:28] and things that we come up against this
[2:31] is God just running tests a man to see
[2:34] where you might be lacking so once you
[2:38] find out where these trials and tests
[2:40] and different things that you might go
[2:41] through and you might discover what were
[2:44] you a little bit low here or you got
[2:46] this maybe a little high the doctor
[2:50] prescribes a prescription for that so
[2:54] what I'm going to prescribe this and dis
[2:58] use you to take it this way and and and
[3:02] the problem is is you you will go and we
[3:07] may take get this for subscription and
[3:10] and we'll we'll sit it on the counter
[3:13] and and and don't take you and it's not
[3:17] going to do us any good unless we take
[3:20] the prescription not only must we take
[3:24] the subscription we must take it
[3:26] according to the directions prescribed
[3:30] on the bottle president God said that
[3:35] you know medicine is a form of healing
[3:39] he said that he knew to Debbie people
[3:45] he loves people so much they said they
[3:48] knew the dougie people that won't come
[3:50] to church he knew that there will be
[3:52] people that won't have her faith amen to
[3:56] trust and believe in God so what he did
[3:59] he provided he he allowed men amen to
[4:03] dip into the mind of God amen and to
[4:06] develop medicine amen for their bodies
[4:10] they may he allowed he allowed science
[4:14] amen the science is to just go a little
[4:18] deeper to things and be able to put
[4:21] things together to be able to to to to
[4:24] aid in the healing of the body God
[4:27] allows this so our doctors in in our our
[4:32] medicine that we have there is a form of
[4:35] healing a man a doctor can take a bone
[4:39] or whatever and put it in place but
[4:41] ultimately it's God that does to heal it
[4:44] but he allowed me to help facilitate
[4:47] these things amen
[4:49] but God is still the healer a man I'm
[4:54] reminded when the Prophet was gone
[4:57] uh-uh-uh-uh-uh he was a contested by
[5:00] this man named dr. Beth and I think it
[5:06] was a bad word say well let me Adam
[5:09] brother Brent let me have him he say
[5:12] well long as you don't get up there and
[5:14] start fighting with the man and get all
[5:18] up said no no no I won't I won't do that
[5:21] I won't do that and one of the thing man
[5:26] was where he asked brother Bosworth was
[5:28] brother broswer tied him up and just
[5:31] taller Muslims those seven names of
[5:35] Jehovah is that Christ the man got all
[5:38] discombobulated and just didn't know how
[5:40] to come back so now he he got upset but
[5:43] brother bars worsen and and everything
[5:46] and and and he said where is that healer
[5:49] where is that healer and but the bonds
[5:52] were totally saying that my that brother
[5:54] branham never
[5:55] to be a healer he just claimed to be a
[5:58] minister for the gospel so brother
[6:00] Branham I never claimed to be a hill of
[6:03] God is to heal a man in the minister and
[6:06] the prophets they just facilitate a man
[6:10] on my mind a winner
[6:12] mm I'm sorry this drew a blank he fell
[6:19] through the lattice and he took up sick
[6:22] after he fell through the lattice and he
[6:26] went down
[6:27] amen to consult Beelzebub a man for
[6:31] healing and the Prophet said go stand in
[6:36] his way
[6:37] seeing a process that our God will build
[6:41] will send all kind of things when you
[6:43] are gone in the wrong way when you're
[6:44] gone about it the wrong way to stop you
[6:48] but a lot of times we fight all over
[6:50] what God is doing
[6:52] we fight right over what he's doing
[6:54] he'll give us he said why is there no
[6:56] balm in Gilead why would you go and
[7:00] consult a man the world or for for the
[7:03] things that that you have need of and
[7:06] when is there no ball and killing it
[7:09] amen
[7:11] now let's get to where we trying to go
[7:14] here we see here this description of
[7:17] this distance here in Psalms and David
[7:20] as the heart pennant after the
[7:22] waterproof so does my soul throne of my
[7:28] soul after the Oh God
[7:30] we see that dis describing of the animal
[7:33] amen the heart which is a deer and man
[7:38] that is in a situation of having been
[7:42] wounded and bit of an animal of prey
[7:45] that is seeking to devour we know that
[7:49] Satan is like a rolling lion roaming to
[7:52] and fro seeking whom he may devour so
[7:55] this this animal prey on his deer
[7:58] seeking to devour him and
[8:01] and this deer is searching for water to
[8:06] stop the bleeding he's wounded and
[8:09] there's a lot of times we get wounded a
[8:12] man but we what we need to do a state
[8:16] right with life-giving water a man
[8:19] because that life-giving water is what's
[8:22] going to sustain us through that womb a
[8:25] man he says my soul thirst for God and
[8:32] for the Living God when shall I come and
[8:37] appear before God amen
[8:40] he's asking a question when shall I come
[8:43] and appear before God when will it be my
[8:47] turn to meet God and observe him in a
[8:51] personal encounter appear means to look
[8:55] at or either face the encounter to meet
[9:00] with a cause to look intently at take a
[9:04] real good look at the situation wait oh
[9:08] god I thirst after you where are you
[9:11] gonna show me you wait have you gonna
[9:15] wait when can I see you do something in
[9:19] my life amen in this present situation
[9:23] that I'm going through this deers
[9:25] wounded and he knows if he don't get to
[9:33] water it's over he'll be destroyed the
[9:38] Lord lead me to the brook amen he says
[9:43] my tears have been my meat day and night
[9:47] oh my David is really going through
[9:50] something he's wounded a man he said my
[9:55] tears have got me been buy me day and
[9:57] night while they continually saying unto
[10:01] me where is that God so he's going
[10:05] through a trial it may not be a physical
[10:09] trial it may not be a physical one
[10:12] but it's spare
[10:13] is wounded sometimes we get wounded on
[10:17] the inside but we walk around with a
[10:20] smile on my face we walk around with a
[10:24] shell amen and like everything is okay
[10:29] but in our heart we're like David here
[10:33] my tears is my meat day and night where
[10:37] oh where is the God of my salvation amen
[10:43] David is writing this as a man that is
[10:47] in discouragement
[10:49] he's the wounded spirit and others are
[10:53] observing him that it seems like God is
[10:57] not around to bring him relief for him
[11:01] in the way that they think God should
[11:03] give relief and I see that's just it he
[11:06] said he'll never leave us nor forsake us
[11:09] and a lot of times when when when the
[11:12] answer don't come in the way that we
[11:14] think it should come we think that God
[11:16] is not there sometimes he wants you to
[11:21] go through a little bit remember the
[11:24] doctor is testing you and sometimes when
[11:28] the doctor is testing you it may hurt I
[11:32] have to go in the morning to give blood
[11:36] I need a hurt why do I have to go
[11:40] through this but when they're running
[11:43] the tacks it may cause some pain but you
[11:46] have to rest and I think rubber cause a
[11:49] little pain you know thank God is with
[11:52] you that that give out of 5 it meant
[11:55] they're going to find nothing amen
[11:59] are they going to be able to cure
[12:01] whatever you find out whatever may be
[12:04] low high or whatever the deal is but you
[12:08] may go through some pain you may go
[12:11] through some torment that's physical
[12:14] same thing in the spiritual where oh
[12:17] where is God the Bible says in proverbs
[12:21] 18 the spirit of a man was
[12:26] sustained his infirmity but a wounded
[12:31] spirit who can bear the spirit of a man
[12:36] will sustain his infirmity but a wounded
[12:39] spirit who can bear his physical
[12:43] sickness or disease a man people can get
[12:47] a bruised and her and won't in their
[12:50] spirit that is often harder to bear than
[12:55] to heal from a physical injury I'm gonna
[13:02] say that again people can't get a bruise
[13:05] and hurt and wounded in this spirit that
[13:11] is often harder to bear or harder to
[13:16] heal than from a physical injury or pain
[13:23] talking about wounded spirits the
[13:29] subject the purpose is to bring
[13:32] encouragement that no matter what it is
[13:36] you're going through there is a balm in
[13:40] Gilead there is an attested inoculation
[13:46] for whatever you might be going through
[13:51] be encouraged expecting for those of us
[13:56] who struggle with wounded spirits in
[13:58] some way for we will all go through
[14:02] these things at some time or another
[14:05] because this is the way of the journey
[14:08] of life that we are all alone but there
[14:11] is a bone there is a medicine God has
[14:14] provided that for us he said in the Book
[14:19] of Psalms 147 the third chapter he that
[14:25] he lists a broken heart and bind it up
[14:29] there was a man
[14:33] proverbs 18 the spirit of a man will
[14:36] sustain infirmity
[14:38] but the wounded spirit II can bear a
[14:41] spirit that has been struck and received
[14:44] a hard blow a spirit that has been
[14:50] struck and received a hard blow the
[14:54] prophet said a lot of times they would a
[14:57] hard blow causes a bruise and sometime
[15:02] that would cause an infirmity cancer
[15:07] from a fall from a bruise from a hard
[15:12] blow amen
[15:14] so we see here in proverbs the 17th
[15:18] chapter xxii verse a merry heart doeth
[15:24] good like a medicine but a broken spirit
[15:29] dries the bone in other words it can
[15:33] drain once strengthen a merry heart when
[15:39] a person is joyful a man in laughter
[15:43] humming in know laughter is a form of
[15:45] healing amen
[15:47] but a broken spirit says try it's the
[15:53] bone it drains you not only does it
[15:59] drains you to fix others around person
[16:05] asked me one time on an interview it's a
[16:07] job interview so when are you at your
[16:09] most happiest and I guess it was
[16:13] inspiration all that because I had never
[16:15] heard the question or whatever had not
[16:17] answered the question when the others
[16:18] are around me are happy she kind of
[16:22] paused and so I never heard that I said
[16:25] me neither
[16:29] me neither but it was good wait agreed
[16:33] on that
[16:34] she said yeah that was good but that's
[16:37] what came from my heart when are you at
[16:39] your most happiest when others around me
[16:41] are happy it's contagious its contagious
[16:44] amen
[16:46] so we see we know the human spirit of a
[16:51] man or woman then Austin does become
[16:54] discouraged and even wounded by varying
[16:58] degrees by negative exist some
[17:00] circumstances in life our spirits can
[17:04] also be affected by negative actions and
[17:07] attitudes and words of others especially
[17:11] from people that are closest to us
[17:14] hey man sometime we all say things that
[17:19] we wish we could bring back just not
[17:23] thinking sometimes a man thoughts not
[17:27] thoughtful enough before we say things
[17:29] sometimes we can say things I've heard
[17:32] others because maybe we're just a little
[17:36] carnal insensitive absorbed in ourselves
[17:40] so that tend to make us not very
[17:44] perceptive of what others might be going
[17:48] through relationship and others that
[17:51] maybe just a little bit more sensitive
[17:53] and how many times have you been talking
[17:56] with someone and you just say something
[17:57] and joking and they take it the wrong
[18:00] way
[18:01] amen that's because that person has
[18:04] already got a wounded spirit and you
[18:06] just hit a sore spot see so we must be
[18:12] perceptive amen
[18:15] but that person we're talking about the
[18:17] wounded spirit there is a balm in Gilead
[18:20] for that wounded and broken spirit a man
[18:27] we see that there are many things many
[18:34] things that can negatively influence us
[18:37] that would even wound our spirit amen
[18:41] David experienced rejection by King Saul
[18:46] rejection from leaders can wound our
[18:49] spirits rejection by friends family
[18:56] these things can wound us unforgiveness
[19:01] can wound our spirits it will bring us
[19:06] harm
[19:08] betrayal betrayal can cause us to have a
[19:13] wounded spirit being falsely accused or
[19:19] suspected of something that you did not
[19:21] do can wound your spirit a loss of a
[19:28] close loved one can wound the human
[19:32] spirit these are just a few of the
[19:35] things that everybody will go through at
[19:39] some point or another in our lives that
[19:43] will wound us it's impossible to work in
[19:49] a kitchen environment certain
[19:52] environment without getting scrapes but
[19:55] it's impossible to go through this world
[19:59] without getting scrapes cuts but we must
[20:05] be wise and how we treat those we don't
[20:11] ignore a wound or to get infected and
[20:15] cause a bigger problem sometimes we
[20:20] ignore a wound and the pastor was
[20:23] talking about that slow fade it calls
[20:27] you to faith and you wonder what's wrong
[20:30] you got a room that you didn't take care
[20:34] of
[20:34] and it got infected now there's a
[20:39] infection through the body but you gotta
[20:43] take there's an inoculation what's the
[20:48] sense of going to the doctor getting the
[20:50] prescription and dying on the doctors
[20:53] doorstep there is a bomb in Gilly
[20:58] when we talk about a bomb when they when
[21:00] they win mate when they when they
[21:02] develop medicine they go through
[21:05] research and they use what we call them
[21:08] guinea pigs but those things have
[21:14] variables because the guinea pig or
[21:16] whatever they may use is not exactly the
[21:18] same as a human body and they test this
[21:22] serum at on this guinea pig to see if it
[21:26] cure this or I would have fixed this and
[21:28] they may look at all of the side effects
[21:30] and sometime I'd rather take I'd rather
[21:33] deal with that to deal with the side
[21:34] effects but see when God brought a
[21:40] guinea pig oh Jesus
[21:42] he had a guinea pig and he injected him
[21:46] at Calvary amen and it healed it when
[21:53] they injected him at Calvary a man
[21:56] wounded for our transgressions bruised
[22:01] for our iniquities and the chest
[22:04] tightened and other people's upon him
[22:05] and by His stripes were healed they then
[22:10] use a guinea pig he used our Lord who
[22:15] came down and took on the body like ours
[22:17] amen so there's no side effects - that's
[22:20] the population no side effects it does
[22:26] what it's sad it does amen
[22:31] it does exactly what it says it does you
[22:35] think and apply it according to the
[22:41] directions
[22:42] according to the prescription I made the
[22:45] comment and I was coming to church
[22:47] Sunday I was praying in myself and it's
[22:53] his law did so many need he say the Word
[22:56] of God the Word of God do the job but
[23:02] then it was just like the law was
[23:04] sitting in the next scene of when he
[23:05] said but you have to take you have to
[23:08] apply it correctly see we can have all
[23:11] of the quotes we can have the Bible is a
[23:17] new book but unless we do what it says
[23:28] like I see we come to the doctor on one
[23:31] day he give us assignment go take this
[23:35] take this do that hit plenty of rest
[23:38] drink liquids come back in two weeks if
[23:41] you don't come back in two weeks he
[23:43] can't see us what you have to come back
[23:49] you have Jesus meets all his
[23:52] appointments do you he means the Prophet
[23:57] said that a Christian with the baptism
[24:00] only knows can't wait to get to his
[24:03] appointment we have an appointment a
[24:06] divine appointment a meant to be in the
[24:10] presence of the Lord in the presence of
[24:21] the presence of the Lord to womb to heal
[24:34] that wounded and broken spirit but we
[24:38] get cuts in this life
[24:40] and the worst thing you can do is ignore
[24:45] well it's just a little cut
[24:48] Oh it'll take care of itself
[24:53] you don't put nothing on it you don't
[24:56] come to the lower house of the Lord and
[24:58] that's boomed in your spirit
[25:01] don't get no SAP and it's an open wound
[25:05] and the devil just simin other devils
[25:10] right in that womb infecting the body

[25:15] no peace in your heart you begin the
[25:24] thirst you begin the thirst yes you've
[25:29] not taken the right prescription if
[25:33] you're not standing the presence of the
[25:35] Lord
[25:35] dangerous say Lord lead me to the water
[25:38] guess what the devil quench that thirst
[25:44] if you don't he will give you some
[25:48] substitute you got an open wound the
[25:54] body is infected now he says just take
[26:00] your drinking and liver it'll take care
[26:03] down here to take care that pain
[26:05] I got so afraid go to the West doctor
[26:10] you go to Beelzebub kill it you go to
[26:16] Beelzebub to find a cure for that
[26:20] whatever is bothering you on the inside
[26:22] a many tenant coming into the house or

[29:32] you don't to clean this body Lord Amen
[30:35] there is a balm in Gilead for whatever
[30:40] you're going through
[30:41] it's like castor oil my grandmother used
[30:45] to give me cash to roll it took three
[30:47] good men to hold me down I couldn't
[30:52] stand that stuff but they get it in me

[31:18] 13 verse says there has no temptation
[31:23] taken you but such as is common to man
[31:27] but God is faithful who will not suffer
[31:31] you to be tempted above that ye are able
[31:36] to bear a man but will with the
[31:41] temptation also make a way of escape
[31:45] that ye may be able to bear it
[31:49] see a man it's only your test a man we
[31:57] trust our doctors we go and if they say
[32:02] they got to do surgery we trust him so
[32:06] open up our body to do what they have to
[32:09] do to save our life allow God to
[32:17] spiritually open you up and perform a
[32:22] surgery he's the best doctor areas the
[32:26] best doctor area see that not that he
[32:29] can only Deacon all the work on what he
[32:31] can see he can only work on that
[32:33] physical part but see when our spirit is
[32:36] oh we need we need we need something
[32:40] more than just that doctor man
[32:41] we need doctor Jesus

[32:49] trust him we need to keep our
[32:51] appointments amen we take the medicine
[32:55] Amen we apply it according to the
[32:57] directions it will soothe us it would
[33:01] take care of what Elvis but we have to
[33:03] have faith and be patient
[33:06] half a and be patient and trust in it
[33:09] it'll take care of us amen
[33:14] it says and it seems like the Lord this
[33:19] is uh and I'm sorry then there are times
[33:24] we'll also be in our lives that even as
[33:30] even if we have a close relationship
[33:34] with the Lord
[33:36] times of trouble will come along in our
[33:40] lives and it's seen by the law fails to
[33:43] bring relief to our trials like we think
[33:47] he should and then we may feel that he
[33:52] has failed us as a friend as they Savior
[33:56] and then if we're not mature enough our
[34:00] relationship can become stained with the
[34:04] Lord or strained with the Lord
[34:07] and that can also wound our spirit by us
[34:13] thinking that the Lord has led us down a
[34:15] man but actually that is just wrong
[34:18] thinking remember the Prophet went
[34:20] through that when his baby died he was
[34:25] met with that test the double came and
[34:28] told him and you serve a god like that
[34:32] amen
[34:34] he was back that spirit was rising up in
[34:37] him trying to rise up in him to get him
[34:41] angry with the Lord all of these people

[34:49] used them haven't he had an illness the
[34:52] hot stuff in his mouth for you to say
[34:56] some gas
[34:57] something he said I go around healing
[35:00] people and touching this person and heal
[35:02] healing that person but Lord I have to
[35:04] go through this
[35:04] he just had to trusted an inoculation he
[35:09] had to just trust in it
[35:10] amen that God will bring the healing
[35:14] Psalms I think Marie of Psalms 46 psalm
[35:17] 46 God is our refuge and Our Strength
[35:23] 1st chapter God is our refuge and
[35:26] strength a very present help in the time
[35:29] of trouble therefore we will not fear
[35:33] though the earth be moved and though the
[35:35] mountains be carried into the midst of
[35:38] the sea though the waters thereof raw
[35:41] then troubled though the mountains shake
[35:45] with the swelling thereof sail on there
[35:50] is a river the stream where all of shall
[35:55] make glad the City of God the holy place
[35:59] of the tabernacle of the Most High God

[36:13] a man Hebrews the 13th chapter I will
[36:21] never leave you nor forsake you I'll be
[36:23] with you to the end Isaiah 40 second
[36:28] chapter the third verse says a bruised
[36:31] Reed shall he not breathe and the
[36:37] smoking flax shall he not quench he
[36:41] shall bring forth judgment unto truth a
[36:44] bruised Reed will not break and the
[36:50] smoking flax shall he not quench he
[36:55] shall bring forth judgment unto truth
[36:59] amen in other words he will faithfully
[37:01] bring us out of the situation in the end
[37:06] it is just our perception at the time
[37:09] the trial that we would think that he is
[37:12] left us it is just our perception
[37:17] because of the bruise but he will be
[37:21] with us to the end and that we could not
[37:25] see him at work
[37:26] a man while we are in the trial a lot of
[37:31] times we can't see what he's doing
[37:34] that's why you have to have faith in Him
[37:37] a man he could be doing something for
[37:41] your own good but we can't see the end
[37:43] but we have to have faith and believe
[37:45] that all things work together for good
[37:51] to them that love God in the call
[37:54] according to his purpose
