just for a moment here um just some kind of way um god has a way of just confirming things to you [Music] and i didn't know brother solomon's going to bring me out on that on that song today but i just one thing i do know is that we're in the right place at the right time amen and i just feel like god got something in store for us that's already started uh here um this morning i was uh i was contacted by a precious brother um from trinidad there brother ovid and he was they were telling me they can ready to do a virtual convention and um the pastor that is hosting the convention is actually from ghana and they actually said brother jack and i've done this before the accident uh would you just send a few songs that uh you know maybe from you all singing as well as we want you to take 10 minutes and just greet the people you know and uh the first time i tried to do it i we recorded a video amen in the church but the video was too large and i just couldn't send it across so we sent the songs and that was that was it well this time they asked me and the the song that came my mind to send them was not a kelly moo and i was telling brother simba if he would just go in strip it from one of the services i can't remember what service it was that we did it but i asked him to strip it from there and just create a file and we'll send it over to him and i was just telling my brother to say i'm a sinless greeting and amen and and um um you know just trust that it'd be a blessing to uh uh the saints and most of y'all know our some of y'all know our history and uh so some of the saints that we're sending this video to these are saints that we haven't fellowship with probably 20 years and uh so it's it's it's meaningful you know and i feel like you know with the recording and just the song that i had in my heart to sin i felt that was the confirmation right there so thank you brother solomon just for being led of the spirit oh my god i remember when i went to jamaica and uh and i and i ministered and they were singing that song in jamaica i said man i ain't heard this when i heard this and i got to take this one back home and and uh it just i just love the words you've done so much for me god i can't tell at all and then then you know i have to switch from english to another language because naughty killing you know amen what it says receive my praise so uh i just i just appreciate daddy man that's just that's just wonderful uh well i'm not gonna take too much time amen good to have everybody in the house of the lord today uh there was another announcement that came to my mind uh oh yes um we are still receiving any gift cards that anybody want to give we gonna be a blessing to the school here during this holiday season um 75 teachers that was talking to [Music] both sister tina and my wife and they would just make some suggestions i think sister tino's sent us teachers they need supply supplies so we actually gonna bless them with supplies and my wife was saying that maybe we just give them like a little gift card uh in the supply bag so you know uh just something maybe a little different just feed them because everybody can't come and eat at the same time and all that so i said okay that sounds good and we will uh what that's what our plan is so this week is the week that we want to try to do it i want to i want to try to get this to them and i believe by friday we want to get it to them and so anybody that still want to give towards that you're certainly welcome to but we're going to try to have everything in place by friday and just be a blessing to this this school we thank god for them opening the doors for us to be able to come amen and and fellowship during this season and that's all it is is a season and seasons change amen

uh uh maybe amazing grace let's go there but uh brother quake who's gonna come and speak for us amen this morning um actually brother quick brother quick who will be going to minister in south america

america uh you know the lord blessed him and brother quaker if he wanted to he could preach in spanish if he wanted to uh so the lord has anointed him to be able to speak the language and um you know

the anointing for us to the lord be the glory amen sometime sunny i feel like the church is even over because i'm already fed i feel like we should say thank you lord that we should dismiss the songs that the testimonies the the comments you know and it's just wonderful and but jack and i happened to fellowship a little bit at the room and i'm already fed things that we the lord revealed to us is just wonderful amen the lord is in our midst and the lord is in you and it's in me and he's manifesting his glory in us amen so don't question your mind that the lord is not in us no matter the circumstances amen the circumstances not what defines is what the lord has said is what defines your situation amen don't worry about time and season they come when the lord unlocks them they come as the lord want them to come don't worry about your prayer prayed the lord has said already the lord told daniel that before you prayed i heard you amen don't worry about the time when the lord is going to manifest it it's an on-time guard is it brother there's satina god bless you right on time god you bring it right on time so you believe that you've already received what you pray for amen and that is the ministry of jesus christ when you pray you believe it and it shall be given unto you amen because we walk by faith and not by sight glory hallelujah to the lord we have everything that we need we have our new church and our new school we have all that we need amen it's in our heart it's coming out we are created we have spoken and is created amen it will be a exact location is that time is that season is that preferences amen as you prayed and as we prayed and we asked for the lord has already done it amen your family your children your husband your wife your grandparents your grandchildren your loved ones your finances your money eternal life holy ghost baptism it's all for you and it's all in you amen just receive it speak it and rest and know that your word is here and amen glory hallelujah to the lord blessed be the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen amen we thank you jesus glory hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord amen glory we want to speak on a little theme which already spoken on it it's been a thought that has been on my heart for since ghana for maybe four months five months ago i have commissioned you by my name says the lord jesus christ i have commissioned you and i want to personalize it to you not a group personally to you brother troy sister michelle and all of you individually you take it as you or me amen says the lord almighty glory hallelujah to the lord [Music] let's read the first scripture i give the first the scriptures but i want to add one scripture to it probably a couple more so let's read from genesis chapter 1 verse 27 to 28 genesis 1 27 and 28 let's go back to the beginning of our commission before we drop on earth let's go to where we began amen where you began amen genesis 1 27-28 says so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them what i think 28 what where does this let us make man in our own image let us make man in our own image in the image of god created him amen you can take your seat please god bless you so the lord wanted to before the earth was formed and when i'm talking about the earth don't look at mother earth look at your earth amen before brother sullivan was formed before that trial was formed the lord said that let us make you he told you that let us make man in our image so that shows that you already existed before you pack the flesh called brother solomon amen but a solomon used to be before the foundation of the world amen not the flesh but brother solomon that eternal person the theophany the pill of fire amen whatever your father is you are amen if you want to test if brother jack is the father and historical the parents of his their daughters their blood is their blood amen they are one they have got the same spirit amen their dna is in them amen so whatever jesus christ is is you amen don't separate yourself from the lord and don't separate the lord from you you are him and he is you amen if you want to manifest him you have to accept him as you and you as him amen so he said let us make man in our own image so that is plurality of god god and his attributes now we were taught by the prophet that we were in him before the foundation of the world paul said it in ephesians chapter one i think verse four that we were in christ before the foundation of the world and all the prophet taught it that we pre-existed not in the flesh but in the spirit that's what the lord is not like you're thinking amen god's thought is real when he says real if god said microphone he means microphone it's not like a blueprint on his mind that he's going to make a microphone someday but when the lord said that brother uh quentin existed he existed amen his height everything about him he it was just the same amen glory hallelujah so before you drop here you were there here and there look at that let me put the natura the letter the word here h-e-r-e there t-h-e-r-e the only difference is what the tea the tea is the theophany and the teresia amen one was a terrestrial bean one was a celestial bean amen one was in the theophany one was in the earth amen so that's the only difference it's just the light the on and off switches it's the same electricity you can turn it on they save the same whatever where is it do you have one here thank you brother the same note you can turn it on off and the place will be dark you turn it back on and it will be light so just on an off switch amen it's just here and there amen glory hallelujah between here and there amen your answer is right there amen glory hallelujah to the lord blessed be the name of the lord jesus christ [Applause] amen glory hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord amen the lord is good so i just want to just want to learn a little background about our commission so i will use some few scriptures thank you i'll use some few scriptures to later background let's go to job 37. when you was in trial when he was in amnesia you forgot who he was but the lord reminded me job where were you when the sons and daughters of god shouted for joy it means job existed his problem doesn't what changed his who he was amen because his pre-existence he still funny his commission take precedence to his problems amen so when you remember your commission your permission commission truncates your problems amen remember who you are brad jack always preached to us that your purpose is your protection the purpose god has given to you that is why you are here you are not here because you are the most handsome woman uh most handsome man or most beautiful lady you are here because god has a purpose and has a commission for you amen glory hallelujah the other scripture is hebrews chapter 12 verse 1 cloud of witness how can a cloud be a witness the cloud is still funnies amen you were there in those clouds not a physical cloud but a supernatural cloud because whenever elohim travels he travels with its people he's a king he's got subject he's got queen he's got the kingdom he's got his wife he's got his servant so whenever he travels just like a president or a king travels he goes with his entourage amen and you are part of the entourage of jesus christ glory hallelujah so the lord has a commission for you amen let's look at the word commission and try to break it down a little bit commission i look at the cambridge dictionary and he said commission is a group of people who have been formally chosen and given the authority to get information about a problem or to perform other special duties a group of people who have been specially chosen and put yourself there amen were you chosen by the lord jesus christ amen have you been given authority of the word do you have all the information revelation of jesus christ to accomplish your commission on earth glory hallelujah another definition said a commission is a high ranking position in the armed forces or a special committee that controls and investigate something amen so you are here as an angel of the lord as a messenger to control and investigate the earth amen the spirit of christ in you remember ram talk about when they see flying sources and they're trying to find out what is this nasa and all the scientists and government want to what is this sources what is this unidentified flying object ufos and they didn't know that those are supernatural beings amen those are few funnies those are holy spirit those are the spirit of christ the entourage of jesus christ investigating the earth and seeing what is going on and then bringing report back to the king of kings the lord jesus christ amen you are somebody you are message jesus christ you are the very heart of god amen you are the motive and the purpose of god creating this big universe put yourself as a tiny little brother or sister that you are the motive the reason the purpose that the lord created all these big planets and the universe that exists not only earth by mercury jupiter they see the oceans antarctica whatever planet you can talk about you are the purpose that the lord created that planet amen and nothing can take your purpose away amen not even your mistakes and your errors and your weaknesses glory hallelujah to the lord amen and sometimes the lord allows you to go through some things to be able to accomplish the commission like as we read at a commission in the military's high ranking position we have got what they call special forces they are trained in a special way now to be in the special force you have to go through certain training you have to go through the extreme hard a harsh weather condition very cold condition they'll find a place which is very cold and you train over there because for the purpose if you need to capture somebody if you need to kidnap some somebody's kidnapped you need to go to that place to rescue them you should be able to face those weather conditions so they are not going to give you the normal condition you're going to go through very cold area early morning snow and you're going to train you're not going to wear glass you're going to train in the snow run and do jogging in snowy area just to get your body acclimatized to what lies ahead you in the future amen so whatever you are going through now is just an acclimatization the lord is trying to get you used to accustomed to what your commission is amen just like an officer just like a military person the lord is training us for a purpose on earth glory hallelujah to the lord so one establish in your mind that you existed before you park on this flesh amen here and there here is not the only existence that you have there is also your existence you had it you funny before you dropped in the flesh if you didn't have a few funny you didn't go back there but because you had a theophany you drop on flesh you put on just the flesh to help you to manifest in this dimension glory hallelujah to the lord just like i use electricity if you want to connect your cell phone or your refrigerator with with a 10 000 voltage it's going to blast you and fry you like a beef or like a fish it's not going to work it doesn't work that way so you have to step the electricity 10 000 volt down down to where 22 000 uh sorry to uh 110 volts where you can comfortably plug in your computer yourself on your refrigerator and what have you so the holy spirit the peel of fire try to step himself down from the logos the theophany become an angel become a thief became a human being so that you can communicate on earth amen glory hallelujah to the lord amen because the supernatural is beyond what the flesh and blood can contain so the lord has to step himself down in you to manifest his glory in your life blessed be the name of the lord jesus christ thank you jesus amen so the lord said let us make you made yourself what you are now you choose your blessing and you choose your problems the two go hand in hand amen you choose your blessing and you choose your problems as well but because we came through amnesia we don't remember and we want to only have the blessing remember jesus he was the almighty god was he but in flesh there was a time he said father who is the father he was praying to the pillow of fire in him that let his cap cut means what suffering passed over me because he could see the suffering that was coming ahead of him because he was what he was flesh and blood because flesh and blood is not made naturally to suffer but without the suffering you cannot appreciate the other side he had to suffer on the cross to become the king of kings to become the lord of lord to live in many member bodies it was comfortable to live in the flesh called jesus but he had to step down that flesh accomplished that work redemp redemption work and then moving toward many members body millions and billions of people all over the planet glory hallelujah to have an experience so the lord steps you down to be able to accomplish the purpose you need to accomplish your commission on earth blessed be the name of the lord jesus christ so for your commission to start your commission on earth the most important thing you need is the new breath the new birth set you on the platform on the right at the right position to be able to establish your to be able to start your commission without the new breath you all messed up i'm all messed up without the holy ghost baptism you cannot fulfill that commission without being called by the master to equip you and to send you on the field you're gonna fail you can't go to afghanistan to go and fight when you don't know you haven't been trained to face al-qaeda's they'll blow you to pieces but those who are trained they know how to walk they know how to dodge land mines they might be land might they can detect that there could be a lineman here let them pass this way when they are going on a patrol they know how to maneuver they know how to move themselves around they know how to keep quiet they know when to talk but if you have not been trained right you just be talking and they'll blow you to pieces amen so the lord train us there are certain times in our lives that the lord is training you in the quiet time so you don't seem to hear from the lord he's training you amen when you go to the native indians when the children are born they don't train them how to talk first they train them how to listen first because they used to have tribal enemies so they don't want the kids to give them away so they train you to be to keep quiet for an hour you don't say nothing just keep quiet and you learn and when you learn how to keep quiet then they train you how to talk because the silence time is as important as the talking times we are only used to babbling talking we talk about the certain time you want to what want to be quiet and listen to the king of kings in your heart and sometimes when you listen to him you find that you have only you already have the solution of the problem that you are battling with but because we don't listen sometimes we think the problem the solution is like million billion miles away but it's right here amen you just only have to what have a listening ear and when you pray then believe listen to your heart for he lives in your heart he speaks amen he can speak through your own lips to encourage yourself he can speak through somebody's lips he can speak through scriptures he can speak through a text message someone who sent to you he can speak through a billboard he can speak through nature he can speak through animals he can speak through everything to help you in your situation glory hallelujah to the lord blessed be the name of the lord jesus christ so you need the baptism of the holy ghost the old person has to die amen and then you go to the back of the desert like moses remember moses was a failure as a prophet as a deliverer so moses bought it himself up and gave up on his commission and went to uh africa to look for a wife and then settled there become became a shepherd taking his fathers in lordship but what he said in heaven took precedence of his failure amen in heaven in the sixth dimension moses told himself i am going to deliver the people and lord send me at this time and the lord sent him to aaron and his mother i forgot his name yoshi thank you so moses nobody could take moses please regardless of his failures moses could not run away no he was still in the arms of the lord amen after he thought his run he found a voice moses take off your shoes for the land is the holy ground and he thought he's run away it's okay he's cool but the lord still went to fetch him and said go to egypt and go and deliver my people he said lord no you you don't understand i can't go there i have a warrant to be to be kidnapped to uh to be arrested and said go i am i am that i am is sending you my commission take precedence over over your uh arrest warrant so go back your mistakes doesn't negate your election amen your righteousness is not what makes you who you is not what elected you your holiness didn't give you eternal life and your mistakes can never in no way negate your election your redemption your eternal life your manifestation amen regardless of how many mistakes you made or how many sins you've committed they can't negate the mind of god remember the man of god is what eterna and israel is he and amen no matter how much yours your children may run away they are still in the arms of the lord [Applause] they can run to the north the south the east the west they're still in the arms of the lord they haven't gone nowhere amen and you believe for them amen just as you believe for yourself and it will happen amen glory hallelujah to the lord blessed be the name of the lord and sometimes the lord let us go through some crude stuff just for your election let me use esther for example esther was born to be a deliverer oh how could she be a deliverer she's a woman yes she was born to deliver israel amen in the way the lord ordained her to be amen so esther the lord at the tender age the lord took both parents it wasn't the devil it was the lord who called their parents back home that your job is to bring esther it was somebody somebody else's job to train esther to fulfill what i want her to fulfill glory hallelujah so the devil is just a tool in the hand of the lord blessed be the name of the lord so now esther's parents were taken away and esther has to be raised by mordecai who became the father and mother trained her in the word of the lord in prayers and in fasting and reading the scriptures at the scroll and so esther grew up learning the word of the lord amen not fully understanding what her purpose on life were she was a human being you can read about esther now and talk about how great she was but when she was going through her commissioning she had to go through some tough times losing both parents not even that or mum remaining but both of them were gone and she was now a foster child but that isn't negate estes election that didn't negate her calling for her life amen it actually rather enhanced her calling amen because she learned how to pray how to fast how to wait on jehovah how to do 3-d praying fasting it became it was engrained in hair for the purpose that she had to fulfill on earth and when the right time come the lord glorified her your commission your purpose is your protection your commission is your glorification the lord has put this glory on you the lord has made by the jack who is because of the commission that they call him to be amen the lord has put their glory on you because of the commission he has called you to be amen amen so there was a time that esther went through the training and was turned over elevated esther esther was she was an immigrant a jewish person and in those time the land of er wasn't him the king was kinna jesus it was like the united states about 54 still put together amen the bible said that 127 provinces is that it's the modern day india and her kin his kingdom straight from india eastern countries all the way to africa because the bible says ethiopia was part of his kingdom and this one was very powerful and it came to pass that his wife disobeyed him and they needed another lady another queen for the kingdom another wife for the king and there were many more beautiful women who were more men who were more beautiful than esther by the lord odin esther for that time and season ernesto didn't put on lipsticks she didn't put on nothing artificial but she went to praying fasting it was like a beauty contest whoever i want or for all the young virgins you can have whatever you need if you need money you need clothing you need whatever to maybe take care of yourself for six months and appear before the king and if you please that can you are going to be the queen the king's wife and esther went into prayer and fasting with his uncle with his father and esther when appeared when she appeared before the king there's something supernatural about esther that when the king saw her he said this is the lady this is a young lady that i want to marry and esther became the queen right but that wasn't just for esther's comfort amen that was a comfort yes she became the first lady of the land the queen of of of i mean of united states that was great with all the purposes around but there was a purpose to that amen the purpose was to save israel glory hallelujah and there was a time when the enemy arose what is his name the man who wanted to amen wanted all the jews to be killed and there was there was evil against israel and of course esther was a jewish regardless of her being the queen she was a jewish she was an immigrant so if they were going to kill all the jews the queen would be killed as well regardless of being the the queen so the anchor said hey esther don't think because you're in the palace you're in a white house you still have to remember your praying fasting [Applause] we still have to go on our knees and the lord puts you there for a purpose you have a purpose esther that is why the lord gave you to me to train you and so pastor rise to the occasion amen and esther rose to the occasion he said i need your praise and support and i'm going to do what i need to do if i die i die and if i'm sick i've saved glory hallelujah to the lord blessed be the name of the lord there are certain times that the lord uses women as well amen for some great things on earth amen and the lord will put that purpose in your heart and you have to rise to the occasion and accomplish what the lord wants you to do blessed be the name of the lord so as i said you pray for me we are going to pray and fasting and she was a prayer warrior already so she's just you have to know how to switch dimensions [Applause] there are certain times that you are walking there just as a human being but when they say need you have to go back to who you were amen there sometimes you'll be working as brother jack a human being he's a son he's a father he said brother he's a friend but there are certain times that they asked what switch dimension and go to the real brother jack in him come out to take care of certain things you need to take care of amen there are certain things that you'll be mr erica sweet and kind but there are other times that you have to go back to who you are amen and manifest the one in you to be able to bring things to pass glory hallelujah to the lord amen blessed be the name of the lord jesus christ and esther had learned how to switch dimension through prayer and fasting and the screw that they read in their time so when the time came esther went into the spirit of the lord in prayer and fasting and she was a queen she had all their food whatever breakfast she wanted lunch dinner but i said no i don't want none of them it's time for me to go back to the theophanic dimension because there's something that needs to be accomplished glory hallelujah and through prayer and fasting the tide began to change in favor of esther and the law of the land was that if you go before the king if the king didn't call you and you go before the king there are two things that could you have or two alternatives two choices if you choose to go before the king and the king doesn't stretch his hand or his sword for you then executes to come for you and kill you so it's not a joke to go before the king when you have not been invited but esther put her life in her hands and went before the king and the king said esther thou great beautiful queen what is your desire even half of the kingdom i'll give it to you what made the difference prayer and fasting switching dimension she has to close your belly amen nigerians have got a term called belly fall he didn't go belly full she went barely empty when the theophany was full in her amen she did away with the sticks and all the good food and all the chicken even the plant food not even the vegetables she did all away with them and she went barely empty and then that you found a pillow fire the true esther came into manifestation and when she appeared before the king it wasn't a physical esther but it's a pill of fire that changed the heart of the king to give favor to esther and now things change in the favor of esther and esther became the great deliverer and even after now if you go to israel or jewish people in all the land they have a piece called the feast of esther if you look at jewish calendar they have it there observe what esther did for israel but look at the beginning of esther she was somebody was born under privilege losing both parents when she was a little kid but the lord had a purpose her commission her election her predestination had to do with what you are going through and your purpose your predestination your commission has got to do with everything you are going through amen so don't worry don't fret your heart why me why do i have to go through this yes it's you that the lord choose it's you it's me amen so that you can bring your commission to be accomplished because heaven is written on you heaven is dependent on you heaven is counting on you sister virginia god bless you heaven is counting on you to bring those peppers into manifestation amen and when you got the holy ghost baptism in other words the crisis in you if you and your theophany are united you are on the on switch if you are the off switch you don't even know you have a commission peter didn't know he had a commission when he was in the off switch he was concerned about fishing in fact all the disciples who is going to sit at at the top of jesus christ at the side of jesus christ which brothers which family will sit close to jesus but when the day of pentecost when the holy ghost came when the spirit of envy comparison by biotin was done away with and they got their commission at the upper room they were not talking about who would be greater in the kingdom of god they came down to save amen your commission is not to be big but your community is to go so low and save amen that's why we are servants and handmaids of the lord because we are we are here to save god's creation upon the earth blessed be the name of the lord let's read a couple of scriptures i've not even read the scriptures let's go to matthew 28 16-20 matthew 28 16-20 and probably i'll give the rest of the scriptures to us to go to read at home marty 28 16-20 i left my bible home the lord had a purpose for it so we than the lord is then the 11 disciples maybe our liberal jack read for me you helped me with the ears so that we can go faster blessed be the name of the lord matthew 28 16-20 then the 11 disciples went away into galilee into a mountain where jesus had appointed them and when they saw him they worshiped him but some doubted it and jesus came and spake unto them saying all powers given unto me in heaven and in earth go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you and lo i am with you always even unto the end of the world amen amen so that is one of the commission go into the world that is a command commission the king has commissioned you and preach the gospel teach other nations that thou be believed baptize them in the name of the lord jesus christ that is the commission god has given to all of us to be a witness amen to share the gospel and do you know the best preaching you can preach preach with your life if you can utter one word with your lips let the christ in you shine before the people and they will see their cries in you amen that is the best preaching that your neighbor will knock at your door sister my daughter is sick i've watched you you've been neighbors for two years 20 years what however long you've been neighbors for and i could see you are different and i'm not a christian or i don't know the lord but can you tell me a bit can you tell me something about the guy that you save i see you and your family i could see the way you dress i could see the way you carry yourself i could see how you talk i could see your laugh towards the neighbors i could see you are different what makes you that different this is a ritual and you're going to open your arms of blessing and you're christ in you the pill of fire in you and be a blessing to the people amen and that is the commission the lord has commissioned us to be we want to go to another scripture john 9 4 the book of john chapter 9 verse 4. amen let's finish the reading then john 9 4 i must work the works of him that sent me while it is day the night cometh when no man can work amen glory hallelujah i must work jesus said this that he must work when he was on earth the work that he's been sent to do he was a servant he was the almighty god but he left his glory he left the tea and he came here amen he left the glory the theophanic dimension the theophany was telling him but he put himself in a cloud of flesh to be able to manifest as a redeemer to be a servant to wash feet to to hug little children to pray for mothers to heal their sick and that was commissioned so he said i must work the rest of him that sent me while it is there the ninth comet went over can work what was the night that was the seventh church ages the night time when the moon when does the moon come the moon come and the night does the sun shine at the night no the moon does what reflects the light of the sun so the night time the heart stars they had messengers but they didn't have the fullness of the sun starting from paul up to abraham amen but then the lord used the nighttime to show the ministry of the wife the moon is the minister of the wife amen it reflected from the sun the prophet and the messengers were reflecting the light of the sun but the fullness of the sun had not come yet but in the morning the sun comes out amen so the prophet preaching the same one called it is the rising of the sun it means that night time is over we are no longer in the seven church ages it is we put it relegated to the rail amen but the lord had a special designation for certain special people remember when we read the meaning of a commission that special class of people that have been commissioned to do a special job so you were not brought up in the seven church ages we were born after the seven church ages and seven is accounting if you go to the greek number seven is a counter number eight is two zeros in actuality eight is eternity double portion so the lord ordained and designed and commissioned you to come after the seven churches to manifest him on earth glory hallelujah that's why you and i didn't get to see the prophet because you have to see the lord himself amen glory hallelujah amen blessed be the name of the lord that is why you didn't get to see the messenger that is why john the baptist when he was born he had a special designation and commission so at the age of nine his father was already taken to heaven because he wasn't born to brain incense zakaria was born to to burn incense in the temple but john his commission was way higher than his father was to introduce the messiah so john the lord made sure that this father's work will not contaminate his commission glory hallelujah there were people in the days of the prophet that when the prophet was taken away it was like the literate the lord jesus christ has been taken away families were broke into pieces they didn't know where to turn because a man who could tell you things in your family who could tell you your destiny who could tell you tell your house number when he has never been to your house before who could tell you the conversation that you were having with your children and your wife when he wasn't in your bedroom i think brother prayed green one time was when he met him and said he was going to he was the arrangement meeting for abraham and he was talking to his wife about going to get a kiss haircut and when he said he said you are brother green you love the color green your dough is green you were talking up to your wife about the haircut is that a brown were you hiding around my house i said no i wasn't hiding there but i saw you but i saw you glory hallelujah and if the lord wants you to be in india without you stepping foot to india you make sure you do that if the lord wants you to be in africa or europe without you stepping your foot to europe but at solomon the pillow fight in you can do that amen so the lord makes sure that we're not born in the night time but we're born at the rising of the sun so greater is your faith when you didn't see the prophet but you have to deal with the son of man himself amen you believed you didn't see the prayer line you didn't see the discernment but you have belief after time because you are believed in eternity amen and when you speak you already see an amen you don't have to wait for abraham to preach to you because you already preach the word to you the word is in your heart and when you take the word and you eat it it would have been awesome to be in bradham tabernacle listen to the prophet sitting at at the front uh pew and hearing the prophet of the lord that would have been a blessing but it's a greater blessing when the lord himself steps his feet in your flesh and said i am that i am i have married you i am in your flesh i am greater than the prophet amen remember the man in the time of jesus the man who was the name the crippled person who wanted to be healed and in those time the lord sent an angel to stead the waters and whoever will dive into the water will be healed and this man has tried is this 38 years he couldn't and almighty that this the sender the the pres the king himself was talking to him that do you want to be healed and he started making excuses yes i've tried for 38 years trying to be healed trying to get my strength back but i'm lame i can't walk before i get there people get ahead of me the question is do you want to be healed whatever infirmity that you have and when the lord got him to know that i am that i am standing before you he said lord i want to be healed so rise up and take your mat and go your way amen what is your infirmity what is your trouble now is it cancer is infertility is it job is it money is it peace in your family redemption of your loved ones it's in you amen just believe it speak it and it will happen amen because the creative voice is in you and your father wants you to manifest him he doesn't always want to give it if you there's a scene that teach me how to fish do not fish for me because if you fish for me give me two pieces of fish i'll eat it i'll get hungry and i'll come and knock out your door give me fish but if you teach me how to fish i can go to the lakes and oceans and everywhere to fish for myself and the lord doesn't always want to carry us yes he carries it when we're babies but we are adults now spiritually speaking and he wants you to manifest him he just wants to see his sons and daughters speaking and claiming and believing and the lord who is proud he's more happy when he when he has to how do i put it the lord is not too pleased when he has to carry you all the time then become like an orphan he become like like a lame person spiritually disabled he has to be pushed all around but when he can have confidence in you that his son brother troy can speak and cancer will drop can speak he's not going to say oh i wish but abram was here i wish jesus of nazareth is here how he's going to heal my sickness how's going to take up my situation you are jesus of nazareth amen oh let's put this way you are jesus of west palm beach [Applause] of miami wherever you live jesus roya palm jesus of north carolina jesus of atlanta georgia jesus of whatever wherever you come from you are jesus christ in flesh the man literally jesus christ in many form amen and when you speak it's as good as jesus of nazareth's book it's as good as paul of tarsus book it's as good as william abraham of jeffersonville spoke you are jesus of a florida amen and if somebody's looking for jesus praise god hallelujah he said oh i'm the one you are looking for i am jesus amen remember the policeman in england when the american paparazzi went to england to investigate john wesley's ministry they went they didn't get nowhere they went to this policeman who was full of the fire of god the pill of fire imbabbing him and praising the lord and they say hello sir we want to uh we're looking for a john wesley's revival he said you have born a revere you have arrived i am john wesley's revival amen you should be able to tell people that i am jesus christ i can pray for you i can lay my hands on you i can anoint you i can change your situation because the power the authority has been given to you amen do you know that rapture is in you the rapture is not going to come from somewhere you are the rapture the resurrection is in you millennium is in you whatever you need is in you because eternal life is in you eternal life jesus christ is in you amen that's why the bible said that repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and you shall seek you shall receive the holy spirit the bible said seek ye first the kingdom of god and the righteousness thereof and all the other things all the other commission all the other attributes will be manifested in you resurrection millennium new heaven and new earth is right in you amen god bless you amen everything that you need off is right in your heart amen if you have a desire just like esther like hannah had a desire hannah couldn't accept being barry no she was 17 years old said no no me have served the lord with my husband since i'm remarried we're teenagers i am going to bear children i am not a baron and hannah spoke to herself she she cried yes she went to the moses ministry of crying but she came to the joshua ministry of allotting the land to herself amen when it's time to cry cry it's okay it relieves some emotions that's why the lord brought moses moses means taking from water so water was with moses all the time but then when they come to joshua i remember moses had to cross the red sea but joshua what did joshua do a lot the land william brahm's ministry was moses ministry if you read a what's the name um what's the scripture the last book of the old testament malachi a thread somewhere said our behold elijah and moses i'll send you a prophet like elijah moses so he has both elijah and moses ministry and encompassing him but who gave him that ministry jesus christ and that ministry is in you but then when after time at the rest of the sun what administration do we have if the night ministry was so great what about the money ministry if the sun is so brilliant could give us so much light yes sorry if the moon could give us light during the night how much more the sun because where does the moon get his light from the sun is the son of man in you are you the son of god are you the son of david are you the son of man you have all the ministry in your heart the lord jesus christ in the flesh of jesus two thousand years plus ago could do the same thing in the flesh of brother solomon in the flesh of brother jerry in the flesh about the quentin junior in the flesh about the quentin senior brother brother simba in every one of us in all the sisters the same lord jesus christ if there's a need for you to pray for cancer don't look for oh i wish bubram is here oh my how you could spill the cans out of existence you sister cherise am i right cheryl god bless you you can speak the cancer out of existence because the same christ in hana in willie abraham and jesus is in you and whatever jesus did 2000 years ago you can do the same thing when they need arise they lost authority and power is not for sure no but it's for a need when they need a rice you have to arise to the occasion just like esther glory hallelujah to the lord blessed be the name of the lord jesus christ let's read one more scripture isaiah 43 and verse 6. isaiah 43 6 glory to the lord i will say to the north give up and to the south keep not back bring my sons from far and my daughters from the ends of the earth amen this scripture i will say this the description is fulfilled it's connected directly connected to ephesians 3 17 2 19. i used this scripture when i the last time that i preached and it was so much on my heart wanted to explain it but i read it didn't explain it and the next week or a week after but i just came right and put the same scripture and broke it into pieces for us the bread because after i still fell in my heart like i didn't give the children's bread to them and but i just came right back and just picked the same scripture i would say to the north give up and to their self keep not back bring my sons and i'll add my daughters from afar and my daughter's from the ends of the earth and he just broke it into pieces and gave it to the children so glory hallelujah i was sitting right here i said lord you know my heart you were the one who put it on my head you see how the ministry is connected is the same ministry is the same jesus christ but a jack in me and you in every one of us amen so you use brother troy to speak the same one he's the one who used but a troy and he used by the jack to speak the same sermon in another way and his brother jerry to speak the same same one and his brother who is used by brother brother but a smiley is the same jesus christ amen it's not true it's not five holy ghost no it's one holy ghost in brother smiley in brother jack in mother troy in brother jerry in madagascar and every one of you amen brother joseph amen little preacher god bless you it's the same holy ghost in us amen that's why we have got the mind of christ and the more we subject ourselves to the holy ghost the more the supernatural takes place the more we see things amen because the lord wants his children to be united we are many member buddies by the same body no bodies body many members but same what buddy let me use science to explain something and i told me when you go to medical school sometimes they give you dead bodies maybe you start with rabbits sorry guinea pigs and rats and different things but ultimately they give you a human being i know my cousin was a doctor and said the first time they tried to shock you they don't tell you they've got the dead body's in the room so they open this room you follow your professor open this room and then you come and dead bodies this is for you that's your property your first day medical school and people be sharing and shaking he said yes this is welcome to medical school you want to be a doctor welcome take the dead body we're gonna decide that we're gonna start that dissection from the brain you've already learned the anatomy of the brain cerebellum uh cortex what have you thalamus hypothalamus and so on and so forth that's the basis but now we are going to go to the intricate part of the brain maybe you want to be a neurosurgeon you have to know all the gray matter substantia all those little intricate pieces of the brain so they chloroform the dead body for you and you're gonna start cracking the brain open it without touching the blood vessels and you're gonna go that's why doctors true doctors are very patient because they go through their training their training itself will teach you patients and you go through the intricate and dissect when you finish with your brain come to the neck region you finish you come to the torso you come to the stomach they'll give you a kidney i see medical student carrying kidneys and lungs and heart in a bottle chloroform around investing campuses that's your property bones give you bones of live bones of human beings people that die some people give their buddies when they die they should be used for that some people when they can't find a somebody died in us then they can't locate they give it to medical school and they use it for training so you see people carrying bones and you have to study the bone they're intricate they're firm or different than how they interlock and they interconnect how the brain cells and uh what they call it the fibers and blood vessels innovate and bring action potential and what have you you learn all of them but remember despite the thousands and millions of intricate of the human parts is one person it's one whole human being amen we came from eternity different many members different attributes by we are one one christ one god one family one destiny one calling one hope one faith and that is the lord jesus christ that's why we are all named there's a name one name that connect connor to all of us that name is what the lord jesus christ glory hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord and so we are one in christ and when we understand that oneness in christ you won't compete with your sister you start get this brother get this your heart lord let my brother get this nose oh lord i wish i'm the one in the front i wish like i'm the one everybody see me no you don't compete but it's one body amen brother solomon is singing it's me singing it brother jack is singing it's me singing glory hallelujah if sister tina is singing is me singing glory hallelujah is the lord that has put the same attribute amen if sister becky sister rachel they are playing piano and different things is me amen because the lord knows i don't know the keys if you put me here the only care i know is the key of k kweku make a little melody to the lord but when it comes to ki g and f i don't have a clue so the lord ordained sister rachel sister becky sister shalom or hadassah and so on to sing sisters to sing for us amen so we are extensions of each other the same member body we are extensions of one body amen so the lord has us here for for a purpose and your purpose is your your protection nothing can touch you until the lord has finished with you another height another death sickness cancer nothing can take your life nothing poverty coronavirus we've come across you've come through the one of the worst plaques that planet earth has ever experienced coveted 19. what wasn't your strength it wasn't how good you took care of yourself yes we do that and we must take care of ourselves but that's not what kept you it's your commission it's your purpose that kept you through the lord has not finished with you and nothing no covet virus will take your life [Applause] nothing no sickness no bacteria no gem life no cancer no tumor no poverty no homelessness nothing absolutely nothing can take your life because you have been commissioned here to manifest the lord jesus christ glory hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord jesus christ there's nothing the lord has you here for purpose let's look at a cloud of 63. there was a cloud that some people don't believe it's a cloud some people believe i remember i preached for it some people thought it was a reflection of it was a jet plane or something like that jet plane cannot go no mechanical device can go that far not even astronauts they cannot go that far it was almighty god it was you and i in the form of pill of fire a cloud version if you go to let's read um revelation chapter is it one cloud is talking about cloud i think revolution one seven let's see if i'm right five seven somewhere please help me thank you ray jack the whole he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierce him and all kinders of the earth shall well because of him even so amen amen he cometh with clouds who is he the lord jesus christ he come up with a clouds in every eye the scientists saw him sinners saw him but then the photo that they took they didn't understand because it wasn't meant for them it wasn't about the brahmo to the picture it was a scientist they saw it in their computer not only in the us canada mexico they saw their observatory they turned their computers they say something supernatural and they captured it took a picture and they had it turned upside down and they brought a copy to the prophet and he said turn it upright and when they turned upright they saw who christ they saw his beard his face everything just like the man who lived two thousand plus years ago he's here amen he lives in man amen and we were there you in that cloud glory hallelujah remember i said that you were not born in the in in the church ages you were born after time after the seven we were born in the um if i put it in the omega all right or even beyond omega because christ is the alpha and omega by so beyond omega before the beginning he was and after the end he will be so you and i were there we had the ministry we had a commission but before we drop on earth we were in that celestial dimension amen brother solomon you were there yes we went through amnesia we don't remember physically but we were there amen were you in christ before the foundation of the world that was before even time began if you could believe that why can't you believe that you were in the clouds amen paul talked about cloud of witness so you had all of you were there not in your flesh but in your celestial body and the lord commissioned you to do what you are doing right now amen the ministry the lord has for you and so at the right time the lord gave you to your parents you came the same life the celestial life in you if you preach if you go to your father and operate in your father you are not going to see a human being it's a life but when the time comes for that life to fall on earth to come on earth through the union of the father and mother the woman conceive and even when the baby is in the womb the future doesn't have that life yet it just depends on the life of their mother but when it drops that life in the cloud dropping the flesh and the baby begins to cry life has begun amen the day you were born there was something there was a star that crossed in the heavens amen there was an angel that stood by your mother in the hospital where you were born your mother might not have seen that angel you might have not have seen that angel but it was an angel of the lord because you were a seed of god amen you have a purpose on earth you say oh i wish my mother saw a light light but abraham when his mother saw the light and coming in because you are not too controversial it is easy for you to be believed down for willie abraham even with all the other other vindication proposals can take it they can go back to the bible and believe paul was a servant of the lord a prophet they can go back to moses they didn't see moses they didn't see where moses was born but people are still wondering oh we don't find a bridge where he talked about the system people fail what has bridge got to do with eternal life what has breached and did got to do with eternal life do you have a theophany do you have a something in your heart that puts you towards the word of the lord look there was that in egypt they didn't have a bible in the time of jew it was moses that began to put something on on a what do you call it on scroll and on rocks and different things the lord began to write prince they used the zodiac they didn't have is that i think one is that the bravo make us like a kind of a like like a king we want to always lean on a cane but there are certain times that you are the bible amen and so the lord ordained you there was a cross of the star and give you the glory that is god in you amen because you have a purpose on earth a commission and when your prayers were brought before for you to understand the law of contrast to understand the negative the switch the switch has got the binary system negative light off and light on you went through the negative you were born in sin and shaping iniquity but then at the right time when the light in you begin to show himself he put on the on switch and you got a new breath it's like a whole brand new world has been open to you you could speak miracles could come before you were born again you did understand miracles what is miracles when you are sick the first thing you think about go to hospital but when something in you when they switch the on switch begin to take place you can believe healing you can receive healing for yourself you can speak your healing into existence you can speak cancer out of lives you can speak whatever sickness out of life the lord allow you to go through it to understand jesus christ was all in all but he came to the earth to experience humanity sickness suffering crying shame pain so that he can be a redeemer so are you amen you are a redeemer amen but you have to go to redemption first and be redeemed then you can understand the law of redemption and you can bring redemption to other people around amen glory hallelujah you understand if you have never been sick before if you've never been poor before you understand why is every why why are these people poor but if you've been homeless before you've been poor before you can understand you can associate yourself with them amen so the lord allow you to go through what you went through in all your predestination everything about you was predecessor by god he knows the hair the number of hairs on your head amen he knows the right parents to give to you you could have come through a different mother right you could have come to a different father but it couldn't be you had exact right perfect parents say oh my parents were no good yes they were perfect for your calling amen john the baptist's father died early but that was the perfect condition for john the baptist esther lost both parents but that was the perfect condition for her my father wasn't there for me that was the preference so that you can look up to jesus christ as your father my mother wasn't there for me perfect glory hallelujah so that you can look at the new jerusalem as your mother amen so whatever happened to you is part of your commission glory hallelujah and if you can take it at all glory you right above the clouds of circumstances because whatever is happening to you happened to you is for your calling and your commission amen and there's nothing out of cater amen there's nothing absolutely nothing time is nothing before the lord esther it was too long but esther became the queen in the kingdom esther it was 70 years bahana had a baby and he didn't just had a baby had a prophet samuel and the longer that your your your promises keeps the greater their blessings is going to be whatever promise that you are waiting on the lord is going to be so high so glorious amen because you share the glory of the father amen the lord has glorified you in this dimension because you can't accomplish your commission without the glory of the father above so he himself how does he glorify you does he put a crown on your head no not this crown but he's living in you amen the holy ghost baptism is your glorification amen let's think i have one more scripture did we read hebrews what hebrews 12 1 i'm not sure if i read it already blessed be the name of the lord wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a clown of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us amen what is a cloud of witness tiofani celestia beans the bible uses different technologies for the same something sometimes it's a star an angel because it's of another dimension so cloud of witness is not a physical cloud but yeah celestia but it's you the lord jesus christ amen you are a witness on earth amen remember the ufos you are a witness here you are unidentified flying object people don't understand you you are ufo people don't understand why do you sister becky why do you dress the way you dress your co-workers may not understand you why don't you wear some pants why don't you put some whatever uh manicure and pedicure and so forth why do you keep yourself natural some people say oh you are very original and they are they actually telling you who you are i used to work in in war green and someone said you are very original i said why we are you are original too because he's got a bunch of tattoos and nose ring tangerine and all kind of rings on his body so he said you are very original because you are who the lord created you to be and you should be happy for being original don't let somebody put you down for being original especially pressure sisters young sisters if you dress the way the lord wants you to dress don't let somebody put you down now why do you dress all this way why can't you go easy so i'm very easy i'm happy amen you are original from the man of god and don't swap your originality for nothing amen be who you are fulfill your commission and the lord has glorified you and is blessing you amen so you have a cloud of witness you are a witness of the lord jesus christ on earth wherever the lord puts you love sahaji amen brotherhood are witnessed in los angeles you might not know your neighbors might be watching you you might not know they might be talking about you you might not know because the lord has put you there to be a witness unto people around you amen and the lord wants to stretch you sometimes stretch you a little bit beyond what you are used to amen let me read my last scripture here i think have you read it already uh let's see where's the scripture praise god hallelujah height length breath okay let me see glory hallelujah we're getting closer running up efficiency it was efficient 17 15 oh sorry ephesians 3 17 to 19 length breath height oh three yes i think we've read that already haven't oh we didn't okay thank you read for us ephesians 3 17-19 praise god that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love of christ which passive knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of god amen who might be fooled you might be filled was it you know we know the bible just had what the fullness of the lord fullness of god had bodily dwell in jesus right but now he said that you might be filled with the fullness of the lord so is it wrong to say that you have been filled with the affordance of the lord no that is your very very word of the lord for you that is your commission that you and i might be filled with the fullness of the lord because without the fullness partiality we can accomplish things the way it should be accomplished but when you have the fullness this is that richard you stand as a daughter of god and you speak and your word is as elohim speaking because you are elohim amen in west palm beach amen glory hallelujah so we comprehend all the sin the breath the length the death and height what is the height let me start with the height the height is how much you can receive from the lord the degree how much you can contain the lord want to pour all his fullness in you will you be able to receive it that's your height what is the length the length is okay let me go to the death the death is how you are rooted in the word of the lord in the revelation of jesus christ your root you stand frame that in terms of when the wind is blowing you are not shaking you're sustana you stand strong you know who you are amen the winds are blowing and people are running helter skelter but you are standing strong and tight because you know who you are amen coronavirus is not shaking you amen government and policies do not shake you orders of the land doesn't shake you the cosmos order doesn't shake you because you are the logos not just you have the logos but you are the logos the mind of jesus christ amen so you are rooted in the word that's why we come to hear the word the teachings work by the jack teachers prayer praying in the family amen oh glory what about their breath their breath is how much you can give to people how much you have you have received and now you are rooted now you have to what give and the length is how much can you be stretched like the ego the ego has to they said some of the eagles have got i think 14 feet right they construct themselves and there'll be a storm that should have swept them somewhere but the eagle will be standing and stretch his wings and fly and go above the storm because the ego was born and commissioned for that purpose amen glory last night i was stretched a little bit let me give an experience i was preparing to preach and i was at my kitchen and thinking about the word and i had a call i have a brother i mean a pastor from pakistan we became friends a couple of months ago and english is not a language so we have we speak like in code like when i started speaking spanish that's the way i started if i know where like church is iglesia i didn't know the verb to say i'm going to church so i say brah jack iglesia parami church for me that's it that's the way i used to speak my spanish so that me and my brother is speaking code and he takes something like brother church tempted to preach and i said yes i know church 10 preach so in my mind i thought he was asking me do i preach 10 30 because he was praying for me i said yes 10 30 10 10 preach so he called me last night 11 15. and said brother he on video he said brother time nine preach 10 10 i said no it's saturday i'm still in saturday so i'm going to preach tomorrow sunday at 10 not night i said no brother hear me preach my church preach i said oh my goodness [Laughter] i signed a contract i didn't know the contract have you signed a contract why are you doing me read the fine prints and they bring up before you sign and the company will be taking your money why is this money you pay your signature to it you didn't read a five prints and that's what i did i signed a contract i didn't understand i said brother it's midnight here he said 20 minutes me go church 30 minutes 20 minutes preach me preach 20 minutes that is it i should preach 20 minutes and he'll pray 20 minutes so oh that's okay brother okay i was okay right now i said no i'm not in a church he showed me a video i'm in the house with my wife and kiss so it's going to take 30 minutes for him to get to the church and then i'll preach 20 minutes wow this brother stretching me so so i have to yes okay i said brother we make it happen so i wait for you and so i was there i said let me record a message because one of the messages now i got a revelation of what he was trying to say all along because it takes a message that brother preach record audio 20 minutes and i said okay so now i'm now understanding what he's trying to say so you know what let him record a message if he calls me he doesn't come here i can send you the message so i recorded like five less than ten minutes of short brief sermon and gave it to him in fact i was trying to try to make a deal with him hey bro let's make it next week i have all the time for you he said no now today today you preach my church you pray 20 minutes midnight and i was looking at this scripture that you have to stretch length to measure length height breath and death so the lord will let you stretch being a person that you might be you must be what instant in season and what out of season even midnight if you have to preach me 20 minutes you have to preach me 20 minutes so sometimes in your life not everything's going to be comfortable for you certain things will not be your comfort zone but it's the law that is stretching you because you are here to learn measure height not the physical height but how much more of the lord you can give to others how much more can you sacrifice your time your resources your word your wisdom your whatever sometimes in your family you sacrifice things for the name of the lord amen sometimes we talk about great men let me use by the brown for example i'm done and how much is sacrifice sometimes he said you travel and when you get to people already vehicles around his house and he has to sacrifice and pray for the sick people they are waiting for him to be prayed for he doesn't even get to see his family first there's already prayer line around his home people that have got cancer different issue and before he goes to see his wife and daughters he has to take care of these people there was a time that sister who uh sister mida she cooked for people people traveling to to a home she cooked for all of them but her own children had not eaten and the kids were crying and she almost had a nervous breakdown but the lord has a purpose but bram came back home and his wife had broken down it was just too much for her and she was crying and she's just changing change himself and when to cut onions and trying to change the atmosphere amen you pick an onion cut it and start talking to the wife and all the pain begin to you know subside and said i'm going to buy you a dress he said i don't billy i don't need a dress oh yes i've seen this dress and it's so beautiful and what have you trying to change the atmosphere because you are christ amen wherever you are there is peace and it wasn't too long since amida was giggling and laughing and happy he chained the atmosphere by cutting onions and talking to her and buying even promised to buy a dress when she didn't even need a dress amen that attribute is still in you amen i remember when we're in the old church i talk about families and their children that the children they are yours and they are not yours they are gods amen they are gifts of the lord to you and they are yours because they are your children earthly speaking but they are beyond you your biological uh genetic connection they are the almighty's property amen and you're going to spend some of your time not only to work for them and feed them but to speak to them amen but a jail cannot do it all the ministers cannot do it all what has been preached the way the tips whatever break it down to your children and i said that as a family it doesn't matter how long you know your time take one children you and your wife to the park somewhere outside the house and let them know talk to them about the way that is preached to them what do you want to use your life for not talking about being an engineer being a doctor they're all great and dandy being nurses being a teacher being a whatever but do you not ask them do you know the mind of christ for you my son my daughter have you thought about god's plan for your life just the thought they might not understand it all but it's in your heart as much as mother did joe kebab was a typical example he taught moses when they were in the palace of pharaoh now moses whatever you do remember you were born a deliverer moses didn't see the angel of the people of fire come into their mother's room but their mother and their father saw the pillar of fire themselves just like what's the name of the uh just like samson's mother when the end of the lord came to commission them that you're gonna have a son no result shall touch his head he shouldn't drink wine and you shouldn't go near dead body and different things the same thing your children are god's personal property and you have to be smart than the devil because the world want to put all the garbage in them through school phone internet friends pierce what have you but then you have to put all christ in them before even the devil can get close to them amen and it's when they are younger and tender their mind is fatter they can take more than when they get to 21 or even now before 21 when they get to 18 or even before 80 when they go to 16 or even before 16 when they get to 14 when the devil has taught them so much and they want to experience an experiment because every child has got a curious mind why if you try to tell a child don't touch this stuff that's the person she's going to touch he's going to touch why don't why why is that he telling me let me see he's not around let me see when they get then oh okay now they learn by risk good and they learn by the their reason is not developed but cause and effect is how children learn that's why we teach children cause and in fact if you do this this will happen to you they don't understand why so much they ask why even if you experience something they don't understand but if they know their cause and effect no that he said don't touch it if he is going to bend you he's going to tell his brothers okay then because of the burning they won't touch it and as they grow their reasoning will develop and they will understand it more so parents god has given their children to you as a property it just came on my on my heart just to tell the church again that your children don't wait till they get 18 to get 20 but when they are tender even when they are one years old preach to them speak to them pray over them night and day amen don't think the church is enough oh yes i'll bring them to the chair but the jack is my pastor glory hallelujah but then when you take them outside the church do you know what happens to them when they go to school jack is not the one who teaches them at school if they go to school they learn things that you don't know they have things in their backpack that you don't have an idea they receive text message from their friends that you don't have a clue so you have to be way ahead of the game it's like the game of chess you have to think ahead of time whatever game you have to think it's like businessmen they think about the market corona they are thinking about five years 20 years where to invest their money how the the business world is going to change because of the covet so we as christians we have to we are eagles amen we've got that faculty we're beyond the world supernaturally so we have to think way ahead of the devil and be the devil in on his own ground amen by the way that has been preached to you ask them do you have a pro what is your purpose on in life not about being engineer being a doctor that is good but spiritual what do you think god has for you daddy i don't know mama i don't know okay daughter that's what you should pray about son that's what you pray about i cannot tell you i know god has purpose for you but i don't know god is going to make you a preacher or make you a housewife or make you a mother and make you a prayer warrior so son daughter pray about it let's pray and you pray with her that thing will be inscribed on her heart or on inside the rest of your life even when you are in glory your son or remember that when i was two years old when i was three i remember certain things when i was two years old in africa they put babies at the back i remember i was at the back of my mother and i remember so don't think children did might not be able to say it but they remember and if you plant in them they might not understand on their mind they have a few funny that you funny captures and the more you plant the more it captures and the more fruit is going to be it doesn't matter how far they go they can go to the north they can go to the south but what you planted will never leave them it will chase them overtake them and bring them back amen so you need to sow in their children to me that is the most important thing that parents need to do i mean it's good to work it's good to support them take them to a disneyland great do all of them i think jeff bezos right amazon has got a space commission was a tourist space tourist now you can go i think 11 hours it will take you to space and look how the beautiful place on the planet and bring you back if you have got the money to be on jeff bezos astronaut and go and take your kids to do that glory hallelujah do it for the kids support them as much as you can let the kids know about the earth and see the other planet and so forth but but never forsake to take them to that supernatural space tour plan the word in them simply i've got it doesn't matter ten kids find time aren't you with your wife and your child your what your family let's take this one this time next weekend let's take this one and speak to them and because it's not part of their house that you're not going to what's going on dad and mom is taking me to the park to this place what on earth that they've got on their mind that they can't tell me at home and they're going to take it serious they know they haven't done nothing wrong but it's outside their home and it's okay god has a purpose for you son i may not even be here i may be in heaven but it doesn't make no difference i want that purpose to be established daughter let jesus christ be your audience oh do you have the holy ghost ask those questions let's have those questions with the children have you received the holy ghost and you've been listening to black jack since you were born but have you received the holy ghost i don't understand that what do you mean by holy ghost okay then now we can talk amen holy ghost is christ in you god's speaking to you directly haven't had that experience okay then daughter son we need to pray i'll pray for me and your mom will pray for you me and your dad will pray for you and now you fight time and now you've got the holy ghost class you pray or bring head to the pastor bring them to the pastor my son my daughter want to receive the holy ghost let the pastor pray for them and so now that they are connected to that channel when they are talking about holy ghost who is going to tell them that they should go and drink when is seeking holy ghost do you think a thief somebody who's a thief comes to your house and the thief asks you to pray for him he's going to steal and you want to be successful in his business he was going to rob a bank and it comes about a jack but jack this bank has got like 10 million i know they've got 10 million in their bank and i want to go robert so pray for me and i wanted to have a prayer five hours prayer and after i go and do my business do you think the business will happen after he's going to be a preacher after praying for him he's going to change his mind because the supernatural will take place say no i won't rob the bank i'd rather go and work and get my money so when you take the children through that channel of supernatural the lord takes them over your job is done but if you don't take them through that channel and the devil is going like this he's watching now they are kissed the innocent he's watching them trying to find his showing a lot of things in them that you don't know and you don't know that those trees growing because you have not planned you haven't planted nothing you leave them to chance and then when the time comes that the enemy will use them fully then they will take over their lives but when you plant them and you point them always god holy ghost prayers pray eating pray at night go to the room and pray for them wives husbands do it and when you bombard them with the holy ghost even mentally they're gonna know that why does my daddy come to pray for me why mommy pray for me we pray in church but why is mommy pray for me tonight he she came to lay her hands on me what is it and that is gonna ring her bell and the pillow fire will take over and explain to her amen shall we be on our feet [Applause] glory to the lord shall we pray let's have the musicians here please heavenly father we thank you we bless your name we give you praise and i thank you for all the blessing and father the commission you've given to us father not only to the adults but to the children because we're all young kids and you are brothers this far we pray

and give perfect health give us a wonderful week of supernatural blessing in our life and natural blessings as well we thank you father we love you we bless you in jesus christ and we pray amen amen [Applause] praise the lord how we appreciate uh brother kwaku uh um there was a lot and that sermon um my notebook is quite full and um but there was a couple things i just want to um just make a quick mention of and he was talking about redemption being inside of us and i think i don't know if it was i think it was this week i was teaching on on wednesday um on this international type thing that i do i teach in in the mornings and i also listen to some of the other brothers that teach but my my i had to teach on wednesday and i've been teaching through revelation 10 verse 8 through 11. and what the lord had showed me is like when john in revelation 5 he he was looking at this book and there was no one that was able to take the book and to loose the seals thereof and john began to weep he began to cry begin to just get emotional like man nobody could even nobody can even just look at the book so uh he heard the voice a man of one of the elders say we've not the lion of the tribe of judah has prevailed to take the book and delusion seals thereof and uh and when john looked he saw a lamb well that same book showed up in revelation 10 and it came with an angel that had one foot on land one foot on the sea and he had an open book in order to reveal it to us and that's through the ministry of brother branham but when you get to verse 8 through 11 that same book john is told to go and eat the book so the same book that he couldn't look on is now in him and that book that john could look at that no man could look at no man could look upon that book was the book of redemption and when john ate the book now the book of redemption is inside of john john represents us as the bride of christ redemption lives in us as he was talking there about you know just just parents and just working with your kids and just planning certain things in them at a very young age and it's all about purpose you know they used to have a saying when i was coming up only what you do for christ will last so song says only what you do for him will be counted in the end only what you do for christ will last and you know oftentimes we we we want to be so accomplished in the things of the world but if we forget if we forget that there's a greater purpose to our existence than amen what we accomplish in this world and then we've messed up we've missed the point but uh you know he was just just kind of talking about that and and there was a a little story that i heard here recently we want to we want to do things and say things that will change lives that's that's that's the real purpose what god got us and we want to change lives and just re just this morning somebody sent me a little text and and it was um a story of um i believe it was three preachers or three missionaries that was going into a certain city to visit and uh and when they got there there was a judge i believe a police officer and a jailer that were there at the uh at the city so one preacher jumped up he started preaching judge ordered police officers take him and put him in jail and uh the next one you know why they got him handcuffed him the next one jumped they'll say i'm gonna take off i'm gonna pick up where he left off and i'm gonna take and i'm gonna start preaching judge order take him put him in jail and then the third one said well y'all got them two in jail i'm jump up i'ma start preaching too he said take him and put him in jail so all three of these preachers are now in jail and when they got to jail they began to make so much noise in the jail the the the judge said you got to separate them they got to stop all that noise put one over here and two over there just do something get get get stop all the noise so they stopped the noise and they thought they stopped the noise and uh they took the two of them and put them in in another cell and they happened to put in the cell of a man that was a robber and as they put them in the cell uh them preachers got to preaching to that man that was arriving next thing you know the man got converted he start making more noise than they was making and then the judge said i thought i thought i told you to separate them they're still making all this noise stop stop him he says no if we keep separating them they're going to make more noise because they're going to convert everybody see our purpose our very purpose is here to reach somebody else i i just brother branham said you know you get to the other side and you'll see a halo hanging over somebody's head and realize it's there because you had
