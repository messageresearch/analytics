[1:23:01] hallelujah you know we was talking about
[1:23:04] it today I've been coming to Florida for
[1:23:06] about 20 years you know and it never
[1:23:09] gets old and the weather never stops to
[1:23:14] me cease to amaze me
[1:23:16] generally I'm in verse verse chapter 1
[1:23:19] let's die read that verse 1 jonah 1 and
[1:23:21] 1 you ever say man now the work of the
[1:23:25] lord came unto jonah the father of
[1:23:28] Mattia saying arise go to Nineveh that
[1:23:33] great city and cry against it for their
[1:23:37] wickedness has come up before me
[1:23:40] hallelujah but generous up to flee to
[1:23:45] Tarshish from the presence of the lord
[1:23:48] and went down to Joppa and he found a
[1:23:52] ship down to Joppa and it and he found a
[1:23:57] ship going to tosha's so he paid the
[1:24:00] fare thereof and went down into it to go
[1:24:04] with him on to Tarshish from the
[1:24:07] presence of the lord but the lord sent
[1:24:10] out a great wind into the sea and there
[1:24:14] was a mighty tempest in the sea so that
[1:24:16] the ship was like to be broken hey man
[1:24:20] let's go to st. John 11 God said I'm
[1:24:26] going to show you you gonna disobey me
[1:24:28] I'm gonna make this trip hard st. John
[1:24:35] 11 they start at verse 1
[1:24:49] st. John 11 and verse 1 now a certain
[1:24:54] man was sick named Lazarus of Bethany
[1:24:56] the town of Mary and her sister Martha
[1:24:59] it was that Mary which anointed the Lord
[1:25:02] with ointment and wiped his feet with
[1:25:05] her hair whose brother Lazarus was sick
[1:25:08] therefore his sister's sick unto him
[1:25:12] saying Lord behold he whom thou lovest
[1:25:15] is sick when Jesus heard that he said
[1:25:19] this sickness is not unto death but for
[1:25:21] the glory of God that the Son of God
[1:25:25] might be glorified here by a mail-order
[1:25:29] blessing to the reading of his word you
[1:25:31] can have your seats and you know the
[1:25:36] rest of the scripture says now Jesus
[1:25:38] loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus
[1:25:43] so these people they knew Jesus real
[1:25:47] well and this wasn't just them umm
[1:25:51] presumptuously making a request they
[1:25:54] made this request because they knew he
[1:25:57] could hear that brother you know so
[1:26:00] tonight by God's grace I have a subject
[1:26:02] and I'm praying that the Lord gives the
[1:26:04] inspiration but that relies on you
[1:26:06] tonight you know because we don't know
[1:26:08] where God will go but I'm willing to
[1:26:10] follow so tonight my subject is play
[1:26:14] your role they may play your role
[1:26:17] because sometimes people are in
[1:26:20] desperate need but you got to play your
[1:26:22] role so they can be breast hernia you
[1:26:25] know as I as I looked in the scriptures
[1:26:28] and you know sometimes about playing a
[1:26:30] role you can look at something and not
[1:26:33] understand it and you can judge it
[1:26:34] before the time and you know as
[1:26:37] Christians we do that all the time we'll
[1:26:39] see something happen we'll see stuff
[1:26:41] happen to somebody we hear something
[1:26:43] said heard really something somebody say
[1:26:46] that we heard and we because we're human
[1:26:49] we're trying to understand it
[1:26:51] intellectually
[1:26:53] but we kind of understand it as natural
[1:26:56] people in a collar level but the Bible
[1:26:59] says sisters Virginia that hallelujah
[1:27:01] you can understand the mind of God the
[1:27:04] Bible says his ways in that our ways his
[1:27:07] thoughts are not our thoughts so let me
[1:27:09] say this me as a Christian me as a sort
[1:27:12] of God you just looking at me came
[1:27:15] understand what God is doing with me
[1:27:18] hallelujah because evening that know
[1:27:21] what God has in store for me you may not
[1:27:24] know the role he want me to play and
[1:27:27] sometimes you do play a role that role
[1:27:30] is really not you but it's the scene God
[1:27:32] won't you really yeah so you have to
[1:27:40] wait until the play is over before you
[1:27:45] open your mouth and speak about all
[1:28:03] throughout the scriptures we saw
[1:28:05] different roles we play you know and God
[1:28:09] oh yeah it is a great role playing
[1:28:12] himself God loves to play a role he
[1:28:16] loves to keep the people guessing and
[1:28:19] you know we was talking about this in
[1:28:22] the house and I was like Lord stop just
[1:28:25] stop
[1:28:25] you know and we started talking about
[1:28:27] God and how God begins you unveil
[1:28:30] himself see he wanted to change roles
[1:28:33] and the public God said in a mighty
[1:28:36] garden well it was God changing his name
[1:28:38] you know when you were younger
[1:29:32] [Applause]
[1:29:35] [Music]
[1:29:42] [Applause]
[1:30:01] so we look at look at the roadway
[1:30:05] somebody might get secret counsel oh no
[1:30:11] I'm just play the role I have to play
[1:30:14] the role of someone fill with a brain
[1:30:16] tumor just so got the show the hospital
[1:30:21] so I can play that role with the head
[1:30:25] that she is not on to death but father
[1:30:29] so sometimes we look like you're
[1:30:31] struggling sometimes you look like you
[1:30:33] found out but God has you played a role
[1:30:36] so he could get girly God won't screw me
[1:30:41] and sometimes we got the little like we
[1:30:45] defeated so God could be holy gonna stop
[1:30:54] you don't know what I'm going through my
[1:30:57] panel it ain't what it seems on the
[1:31:02] outside
[1:31:03] let's talk about it a little bit you
[1:31:07] know we look and we see that God loves
[1:31:11] to play a role but what he was doing he
[1:31:13] was on fellas you know he started that
[1:31:17] esterday the great eternal he was all by
[1:31:22] himself but that wasn't who he really
[1:31:24] was
[1:31:25] so he began to change masks and he
[1:31:28] started in valence him but we unveiled
[1:31:31] himself he kinda
[1:31:33] Cindy let me he came down a little bit
[1:31:36] lower honey that we already know he was
[1:31:38] dating hot but he wanted to come down so
[1:31:42] we could understand him so he had to
[1:31:44] play a role that we could catch because
[1:31:47] that's him the great control we couldn't
[1:31:49] understand that scene so he was playing
[1:31:55] and say that's Christ and he he
[1:32:03] condescended from the great eternal he
[1:32:07] changed man she took that mask off we
[1:32:09] were little mascot and separated him
[1:32:12] self-existing honey all by himself but
[1:32:15] he still couldn't catch the world we
[1:32:17] still couldn't catch her in Ross because
[1:32:19] at that time that he wasn't even God
[1:32:24] we still didn't know him
[1:32:26] creation didn't know him because you all
[1:32:29] by herself and he did not want to be all
[1:32:32] by himself
[1:32:33] so he had to change master here honey
[1:32:35] see you all about him getting going so
[1:32:38] he took off that mask put on the mask of
[1:32:40] the anger and the leg off with the
[1:32:47] public concepts that the low-cost
[1:32:49] is God created anointing the British
[1:32:52] started creating holiness he's got to
[1:32:54] create moons
[1:32:55] silence oceans rivers all these things
[1:32:58] because that's what the logos tell it
[1:33:00] comes out it create so he was saying
[1:33:04] from each mass he was revealing his
[1:33:07] glory he was from being eternal saying
[1:33:09] nobody can touch me catch it now catch
[1:33:15] out who wrote this play he was
[1:33:18] untouchable in the beginning Pilar did
[1:33:21] he changed to be self existent that
[1:33:24] means nobody stands with him but did
[1:33:26] that stop him from being untouchable
[1:33:29] still the same person still the same was
[1:33:34] he still in touch unchangable unshakable
[1:33:39] unstoppable passing you are oh you are
[1:33:48] God alone what we think these
[1:33:50] inspirations are coming from it comes
[1:33:52] from a place huh yeah that God calls
[1:33:55] just by himself and you don't touch as
[1:33:58] he I don't want to get too deep into
[1:34:00] this pot but you know church as he begin
[1:34:03] to change Mass he says okay I got
[1:34:05] something I got a real purpose in in
[1:34:08] this so he took that mess off of the
[1:34:10] logos creating and then he turned he put
[1:34:13] that aside Harish he created angels and
[1:34:16] all these things did he became gone and
[1:34:19] now he's in a surprise huh when meeting
[1:34:22] you can recognize the role we could look
[1:34:24] at him and say hey that stuff that was
[1:34:26] brought over here that was brought over
[1:34:28] there that was
[1:34:57] [Music]
[1:34:59] he became God
[1:35:01] we became worse of us failure so when
[1:35:04] God changed math to become something he
[1:35:07] brought us alone win the Java honey and
[1:35:10] God begin the play spot hurry
[1:35:12] so I'm saying tonight Church what role
[1:35:15] are you playing but we see God he kept
[1:35:22] condescending condescending
[1:35:24] condescending and I lived the part where
[1:35:26] he gets down he creates he begins to
[1:35:28] create man he says us make man in our
[1:35:32] image you know people have debated this
[1:35:34] for years they said well it was it was
[1:35:36] it was us in the garden it was you know
[1:35:38] me and press themselves and all these
[1:35:40] other things and he was talking to the
[1:35:42] US but no let's realize who the US was
[1:35:45] because at that point honey none of us
[1:35:48] were created we were in his mind so he
[1:35:56] wasn't talking to me he wasn't talking
[1:35:58] to you
[1:35:59] but this was happening if you can go
[1:36:02] there with me that we are what I'm doing
[1:36:04] is I'm illustrating a drop I want to
[1:36:07] show you the play that was in God's mind
[1:36:09] so as we remember God kind of seen it
[1:36:11] from these first steps earlier but he
[1:36:13] was still eternal take a look back and
[1:36:16] he can see that he was he killed her but
[1:36:19] now he's down here a man he's always in
[1:36:22] condescended always out to God but he
[1:36:24] still eternal hurry let's come down a
[1:36:27] little bit low he still held him let's
[1:36:29] come down a look at mo he's still hungry
[1:36:32] Oh God but here at God he says I want to
[1:36:35] create a man so he turns around and
[1:36:37] looks at himself nobody else to change
[1:36:47] mess with him
[1:36:48] nobody asked was eternal nobody else was
[1:36:52] self existent nobody else had power but
[1:36:55] we was talking to he turns around and he
[1:37:03] looks at the expressions of himself and
[1:37:06] he says hey you tunnel hey lo gosh hey
[1:37:11] let us make man in our image and we God
[1:37:19] comes inside of you that makes you
[1:37:21] eternal that makes you stop existence
[1:37:25] that gives you creative power to touch
[1:37:28] anything cats dogs roll out with you the
[1:37:32] road in the plane if you can see God in
[1:37:40] his room you could see yourself I'll say
[1:37:46] let us make me you know everybody was
[1:37:49] get the credit but no you know remember
[1:37:53] he said he alone get going and the Bible
[1:37:56] said he won't share his glory with
[1:37:57] nobody but then he comes back around and
[1:37:59] said hey that these problems you going
[1:38:01] through these sufferings it is not even
[1:38:04] worthy to be compared with for glory
[1:38:08] I just told you he said let us oh look
[1:38:23] at God playing a rope and his whole
[1:38:26] motive is that you may know who he is
[1:38:29] but I want to show you something tonight
[1:38:32] about playing a role you can look at
[1:38:34] something that you could characterize it
[1:38:37] even in a religious form and you can say
[1:38:40] man that brother look like it ain't true
[1:38:42] it look like it ain't real let the play
[1:38:45] be played out
[1:38:46] let the script be played out just in
[1:38:49] case you hadn't known just in case it is
[1:38:53] you know is so much stuff on the
[1:38:55] internet so much stuff going out let me
[1:38:58] explain something to you
[1:38:59] I almost things I just talked about
[1:39:01] almost different masks I just talked
[1:39:03] about was there before there was a
[1:39:06] Google was there before there was an
[1:39:13] Internet was there before there was a
[1:39:16] Wikipedia so I don't need to research
[1:39:19] that to understand my room I don't need
[1:39:23] to research that to understand that God
[1:39:26] sent some truth in this day it will
[1:39:28] connect with who I am as I pay out my
[1:39:32] JAMA you know some means some people can
[1:39:39] get so caught up in the role that stuff
[1:39:42] will come to them by inspiration that's
[1:39:44] not even on the script I just give you a
[1:39:52] natural natural one I've heard I've seen
[1:39:56] the interview of Denzel Washington never
[1:40:00] heard of him this is only if you order
[1:40:09] in this world but you're not of this
[1:40:11] world but you know he played a role of
[1:40:15] Malcolm X and he said he got so caught
[1:40:18] up in the role he starts to rehearse
[1:40:21] he's got to rehearse lines and scripts
[1:40:25] that wasn't even what the director put
[1:40:27] out it was coming from the spirit of the
[1:40:31] man who you know and you know partly
[1:40:34] that the proper God say God takes the
[1:40:36] man but he leaves the spirit he says the
[1:40:38] devil does the same thing so I'm here to
[1:40:41] say trust that demand they leave but the
[1:40:43] role will always be there for someone to
[1:40:48] act it out in no time I'm here to say
[1:40:51] tonight that there are scenes that are
[1:40:54] that have been specifically ordained
[1:40:56] that you've got to play in nobody else
[1:40:58] can play there's only one country teach
[1:41:02] nobody never be able to take my lines
[1:41:07] there are things that God gave me before
[1:41:10] the foundation of the world that no man
[1:41:12] will never be able to put claims on have
[1:41:15] you ever heard another preacher cousin
[1:41:30] what is it it's inspiration in my role
[1:41:34] never seen a preacher sniffing involved
[1:41:44] and only I could act out that role and
[1:41:48] that's things about him that nobody else
[1:41:50] can act
[1:41:50] but you know my hope I ain't going to
[1:41:56] fastly but you know what this is where
[1:41:59] we supposed to me we ain't supposed to
[1:42:01] be dragging around honey when your
[1:42:03] anointing is here we're supposed to
[1:42:05] catching it right choice let's look at a
[1:42:09] full second reason why I read Jonah we
[1:42:14] look at Jonah God told him specifically
[1:42:16] go to Nineveh and preach because the sin
[1:42:20] of the people have come up to me then in
[1:42:22] the first time God said he said the same
[1:42:25] thing about stop the sales of sign have
[1:42:27] come up to you so one thing I want you
[1:42:29] to understand when you in sin you ain't
[1:42:31] getting by it's coming up to God and
[1:42:35] eventually he's going to send a wire to
[1:42:37] deliver you but the problem is people
[1:42:40] don't understand the role that's being
[1:42:42] played then hit a preacher there see how
[1:42:45] it come and they're like nah he ain't
[1:42:47] the one to correct me
[1:42:49] you're missing the room
[1:42:52] oh yeah you're missing the room but you
[1:42:56] know God told Jonah he say hey I want
[1:42:59] you to go to Nineveh and I want you to
[1:43:01] present those I know they don't deserve
[1:43:04] the difference that wasn't his choice
[1:43:06] God can say we wanna see God could give
[1:43:10] grace do we wanna give grace to you but
[1:43:13] see the problem we look at things and we
[1:43:15] see hey they too far gone ain't no help
[1:43:17] for them but let God be the judge first
[1:43:21] and see we look at Jonah God gave him a
[1:43:24] direct order go and preach it doesn't
[1:43:27] nope I'm going to Tosh
[1:43:29] I'm gonna jump on his boat and I'm goin
[1:43:32] home to us he look like a direct
[1:43:35] backslide
[1:43:39] do backdrop well let me say like this
[1:43:43] low know the proper God saying he was in
[1:43:48] the complete will of God see this is
[1:43:53] what I love about the message of the
[1:43:54] hour the Prophet will say things to
[1:43:57] challenge you as a Christian because as
[1:44:01] a man as a regular man it looked like he
[1:44:04] was playing his role wrong but according
[1:44:07] to God lucky let's understand this you
[1:44:12] will never be able to do something catch
[1:44:13] God off God you would never be able to
[1:44:16] do something here in and any catch God
[1:44:19] by surprise you would never be able to
[1:44:21] do something god sake uh what I'm gonna
[1:44:23] do now so how could it be out of the
[1:44:28] will of God when God is watching over
[1:44:30] him remember the Bible says all things
[1:44:35] work together for good now we can select
[1:44:39] which play that's gonna work on it has
[1:44:41] to be for everything
[1:44:43] oh yeah but we look at we look at Jonah
[1:44:46] Helena we judge the situation with a God
[1:44:49] told him to go this way and he would
[1:44:51] another way backslider purpose here
[1:44:54] goddamn i'ma drop something on you now
[1:45:03] we're doing that about people that's
[1:45:05] left the message
[1:45:11] backslide let's talk about the topic
[1:45:13] last detail let's let it play out
[1:45:21] let's let it play out
[1:45:24] let me ask you something look children
[1:45:26] leave the house and they go out and do
[1:45:28] you know who just passed away and say I
[1:45:30] mentioned little paper not my child
[1:45:33] anymore
[1:45:33] no you're believing in a return you're
[1:45:37] believing that this is just something
[1:45:39] they're going through so you're waiting
[1:45:41] for God to get glory because you're
[1:45:44] holding all the structure that said
[1:45:46] write them up in the way that they
[1:45:48] should depart from so no writing for God
[1:45:54] to play as well cuz you play those
[1:46:00] sometimes we can't be God part of the
[1:46:03] time we got to be gods all the time
[1:46:06] hallelujah
[1:46:08] but we look at Joe Louis backslide boy
[1:46:11] are you going to hell you know I know we
[1:46:14] feel that way
[1:46:16] family members and different things but
[1:46:19] remember he said this sickness is not
[1:46:21] unto death but for the glory of God you
[1:46:25] think about a child go out in the world
[1:46:26] get tattoos just start up hallelujah
[1:46:29] stop drinking and smoking URIs honey
[1:46:33] your boys hug let your hair grow out
[1:46:35] like a Rasta failures and all this stuff
[1:46:37] you know and then one day they look at
[1:46:41] the mom and dad and they say boy I had
[1:46:43] it good and then they started working
[1:46:46] they way back see if you already
[1:46:49] prejudge the situation ok we'll seize
[1:46:51] him and you know condemn him the hell
[1:46:54] you came you think it is a certain way
[1:46:57] he got to come no let God take care
[1:47:01] you just play a role judge I fight we
[1:47:05] miss it sometimes with our children with
[1:47:07] our loved ones little things God is with
[1:47:10] us in the place of Redeemer why is no
[1:47:15] child your love for your spouse get
[1:47:17] louder and then love when you love why
[1:47:20] don't you be upset yeah it's 10
[1:47:28] attention it before that's what we do we
[1:47:31] look at it and we say oh lordy go on the
[1:47:33] head you don't know your role
[1:47:37] the sickness is not unto death but for
[1:47:39] the glory of God now let's look at it
[1:47:42] that child come back they surprise you
[1:47:45] when they sitting up in church you
[1:47:47] Presonus for a man priests and they have
[1:47:49] no hope what happens then God gets glory
[1:47:57] but if you prejudge it no that'll never
[1:48:00] happen
[1:48:01] so we got to press on we got to let it
[1:48:04] play out but you know these religious
[1:48:09] these religious these all going for
[1:48:13] luxury wear Pharisee acting message
[1:48:17] believers that think they know
[1:48:18] everything
[1:48:21] please don't get me started
[1:48:23] just me and my only personal opinion I
[1:48:26] think when people are so dogmatic that
[1:48:28] they don't believe in grace they don't
[1:48:30] know Jesus they don't believe that God
[1:48:33] could save a prostitute that God to save
[1:48:36] our children that God could say well I
[1:48:38] am the doctor say well chief the doctor
[1:48:41] say when I don't you up in the
[1:48:44] again let's take our hands off and play
[1:48:48] our role she chose let's remember the
[1:48:57] property God talked about the law of
[1:48:58] contrast so you need a negative to see a
[1:49:01] positive and if you it isn't certain
[1:49:04] somebody you know that I did on the
[1:49:06] negative why don't you be the pilot you
[1:49:12] see up to the place now and I say this
[1:49:15] humbly I'm not moved by what people say
[1:49:21] I've been called a lot of things but the
[1:49:25] word harderberg quintet this is let me
[1:49:27] laugh a little bit yes I you just you
[1:49:30] just nice man
[1:49:35] matter itself well they won't mean
[1:49:37] except in the name of religion and I
[1:49:40] won't curse I don't argue first I just
[1:49:43] say the Bible and the Prophet says just
[1:49:45] and I don't argue about it oh ah he just
[1:49:48] he just nice nasty I say thank you that
[1:49:53] means that really ain't got no hold on
[1:49:54] me I really didn't react the way they
[1:49:57] want me to reaction so I'm alright with
[1:50:00] it as long as I'm not singing Hallelujah
[1:50:03] she will see these will see things
[1:50:05] happen and then we try to put it in a
[1:50:07] certain category let it play out
[1:50:10] still let's look at the role a little
[1:50:18] bit everybody all right Jonah gets on
[1:50:22] the boat I got red disobedient get from
[1:50:27] the boat and he think he's running from
[1:50:30] God now this is the question I always
[1:50:31] acts it's just like a person that's
[1:50:34] gonna rob a bank and think they're gonna
[1:50:35] get away if they were sitting next to
[1:50:37] question how many people do I know ever
[1:50:40] got away they wouldn't do it because
[1:50:44] nobody knows somebody's I don't I got no
[1:50:47] friends that ever robbed the bank Sarah
[1:50:49] and got away with it so I don't have
[1:50:51] them kind of cause I don't go there
[1:50:54] those
[1:50:55] things are not in my mind you can't get
[1:51:00] me to step in one of those roles cuz I
[1:51:04] don't see guardian Gloria turning up
[1:51:07] suitors the only way God can get glory
[1:51:09] out of it is if you think it's possible
[1:51:12] so you know even when we look at the
[1:51:15] situation and we see Jonah he's gone the
[1:51:17] complete different route of what God
[1:51:19] told you headin and he heard God over
[1:51:23] here say go to Nineveh now what may tone
[1:51:26] of 8 that same God has put him over here
[1:51:28] what I'm gonna speak to him on the boat
[1:51:32] the road got to be played so don't get
[1:51:36] sunk a boat and to us if you looked like
[1:51:38] he backs it in hear him jump on that
[1:51:40] boat and not gosh
[1:51:42] shaking up the water why something had
[1:51:45] to be played out because Jonah had to
[1:51:49] play the role of a backslide but he was
[1:51:52] at a bachelor party
[1:51:54] so sometimes you can play a role but
[1:51:56] that's not who you really are
[1:51:58] let's look at a church he jumped on the
[1:52:00] boat and it looked like you know the
[1:52:02] water stock Giddings very shaky and the
[1:52:04] men on the boat start getting shook up
[1:52:05] and Jonah on the boats
[1:52:07] let me ask you something how many of you
[1:52:10] ever get good rest when you know you out
[1:52:13] of the will of God I don't know about
[1:52:19] you but when I doing wrong I don't get
[1:52:21] no rest so what was it about Jonah when
[1:52:25] he could get on the boat and go to sleep
[1:52:27] be confident everybody else shook up if
[1:52:30] you wrong God will not give you rest
[1:52:32] in your bag so Jonah didn't think he was
[1:52:37] back to me Rudi
[1:52:45] how could he have peace go on a direct
[1:52:48] opposite way of God to him the only way
[1:52:53] you can get pieces if God give it to you
[1:52:57] deviling or do you know pcs de tormenta
[1:53:01] husband
[1:53:02] so total of all these feet whoever in a
[1:53:05] boat shake what I think is just shaking
[1:53:09] obstacle like it was pressure you know
[1:53:12] Church the man come in the music in a
[1:53:17] time like this
[1:53:28] hey don't listen to me with your mind
[1:53:31] listen to me with your heart because you
[1:53:34] know when you roll you can't sleep huh
[1:53:39] you can't hardly eat that's if you love
[1:53:42] God you somebody playing Church you go
[1:53:45] out do all kind of crazy stuff and
[1:53:47] cookies like haha Lea Oh fake up but
[1:53:54] don't know headrests he's on the boat
[1:53:56] just relaxing toss it you know the man
[1:54:01] they experience it all the trouble
[1:54:03] so they come wake up Jonah is then - hey
[1:54:07] hey you hey do you realize what's going
[1:54:09] on call on your God Jonah's ain't no
[1:54:15] need for that throw me overboard and
[1:54:20] they're like don't you over
[1:54:21] playing he's in his role now she
[1:54:24] realized holy yeah I didn't miss uni
[1:54:27] Eliza cuz I'm out of the will of God if
[1:54:30] a child could ever get that revelation
[1:54:33] then you ain't the only one going
[1:54:35] through when you laugh
[1:54:39] no Paris I said yet defending you family
[1:54:47] members huddle charge bevels hallelujah
[1:54:49] don't know when y'all go I hear do stuff
[1:54:51] y'all represent hurry up here Bible
[1:54:54] truth and spiritual holy no they see the
[1:55:00] otic junk over there we followed him up
[1:55:04] cuz of the role you play you get on the
[1:55:08] internet and you make comments oh you
[1:55:13] represent in your church hey stop
[1:55:16] calling your pastor stop calling it pass
[1:55:18] to the police because of something you
[1:55:20] might like it don't get me wrong I got
[1:55:32] social media cheese but it gets on my
[1:55:33] nerves
[1:55:36] it's on my nerves
[1:55:38] hey they say they just all these
[1:55:39] internet preachers they say they just
[1:55:41] want to get out here and say something
[1:55:43] and try to draw people in all this stuff
[1:55:44] we got to be stronger not to get caught
[1:55:46] up in that father when they put stuff
[1:55:51] out and they asking questions you ought
[1:55:52] to say I don't know I don't know when
[1:55:55] keep moving when you're secure and where
[1:55:58] God is done let me say like this I've
[1:56:00] played the role of a council patient so
[1:56:03] you can't tell me God didn't play the
[1:56:04] role of a hero so no matter what kind of
[1:56:08] sickness you got you'll never be able to
[1:56:09] convince me that God can't heal you cuz
[1:56:12] I've already been in that scene and God
[1:56:15] ever save you by what we call this
[1:56:18] message you were dotted again and we was
[1:56:28] talking about me me me a jet was talking
[1:56:30] about I'll tell him I wasn't sometimes
[1:56:32] I'll just have another Becca Church
[1:56:34] talking about when him and sister Erica
[1:56:36] grounded a plane no I told Mike a woman
[1:56:40] in Memphis Tennessee
[1:56:42] that what you read about the proper deed
[1:56:45] is to say the miracle-working in here
[1:56:47] the same way it's the same garden oh so
[1:56:56] much so much has happened funny we've
[1:56:58] that time to entertainers foods God has
[1:57:01] been so real
[1:57:02] you've done so many supernatural things
[1:57:04] I don't have time to get caught up in
[1:57:06] previous file a I won't my way to happen
[1:57:09] and if I got to play the road somebody
[1:57:12] nice nasty if they give me to the
[1:57:14] rapture praise the Lord
[1:57:16] [Applause]

[1:57:28] away from that person who ain't never
[1:57:30] roll cuz they are raised right I mean
[1:57:35] you can tell them they fit across the
[1:57:38] street and the bus coming at you till
[1:57:40] Hey look out for the bus I ain't coming
[1:57:43] boom see me cuz I'm nice nasty I see I
[1:57:50] thought it would come
[1:58:00] don't get me wrong I'm not one of those
[1:58:02] people like to say I told you so I just
[1:58:04] didn't play out let me get in since I
[1:58:07] don't want to be long tonight him I
[1:58:09] won't hit it and even gonna fly up idea
[1:58:11] huh the days of walking out of churches
[1:58:14] over it's time for us to fly you're not
[1:58:18] him should be so hot we don't wanna lose
[1:58:20] the people we have known in Cebu so high
[1:58:23] we walk out of here with the blessings
[1:58:25] of God in our hands
[1:58:27] hey it's too often we come to church
[1:58:31] with things are not hard and we leave
[1:58:34] with the same things on our heart we
[1:58:36] need church Jonah just showed that he
[1:58:44] was playing the role of a backslider he
[1:58:48] know he's on the boat the boats being on
[1:58:50] shook up he says hey throw me overboard
[1:58:52] I know what's going on and they like no
[1:58:54] no we're gonna get you out hey product
[1:58:57] put the sails up higher honey - told the
[1:59:00] guys to start rolling it rolling
[1:59:02] sails up higher the wind stopped in the
[1:59:04] water stop this is no we can't get out
[1:59:07] of here we can't get out of here he said
[1:59:09] I told y'all throw me overboard so
[1:59:13] finally they tied his hands
[1:59:16] they didn't just throw overboard they
[1:59:19] tied him up some of y'all need to tie up
[1:59:23] those loose seeds in your mind some of
[1:59:27] that used unbelieving either tied up cuz
[1:59:31] it's time to jump overboard with him
[1:59:33] shouting huh and they take him in a form
[1:59:36] of a board and as soon as he hit the
[1:59:39] water let's deal with the surface first
[1:59:42] doing gonna deal with the bottom on the
[1:59:45] surface that man who looked like a
[1:59:47] backslider as soon as he hit the water
[1:59:50] everything he had to play that role why
[1:59:54] for those men because those men wasn't
[1:59:59] in innovate but when you go back and
[2:00:01] read the Bible when Jonah hit the water
[2:00:04] they repented and offer sacrifice to the
[2:00:07] true and living God
[2:00:10] so Java had to play the role of a batch
[2:00:13] model because they were mean for Natasha
[2:00:16] that wasn't serving God like they
[2:00:18] supposed to so God had to use a man
[2:00:21] honey to play the role model but really
[2:00:24] was apostate to get these means to get
[2:00:26] back in their proper role because the
[2:00:33] controller was out of the will of God
[2:00:35] why he got all right have a special made
[2:00:38] system see we chose the situation before
[2:00:46] is over if you allow the winner God God
[2:00:49] we live round like a god save him
[2:00:51] because he was right where he was
[2:00:53] supposed to be the Bible says over in in
[2:01:02] verse 2 you sense Jonah says with my
[2:01:04] soul fainted within me I remember the
[2:01:07] law she says that's what we got to be in
[2:01:10] your darkest movie in your darkest hour
[2:01:12] you've got to remember you sir I said
[2:01:16] again this is the theme of my life I
[2:01:18] wake up and there's two things I say to
[2:01:20] myself one God cannot lock that do that
[2:01:27] don't do that self you realize that your
[2:01:31] God King lock that means is it in the
[2:01:34] Bible is truth that means you can't take
[2:01:37] it back
[2:01:38] that means don't sway to the left or the
[2:01:40] right that means it's a promise so I
[2:01:45] read it easy these things he said
[2:01:48] blessed is he who sins is forgiven that
[2:01:52] put me into a praise dance cuz I know
[2:01:54] I'm trying to live for the Lord when I
[2:01:56] like that so when I really seven skip
[2:01:59] does it just make me move a little bit
[2:02:01] partners I like come to church and wait
[2:02:05] for somebody to get it started out there
[2:02:06] I would get it started
[2:02:11] [Applause]
[2:02:18] [Music]
[2:02:52] [Applause]
[2:03:00] [Applause]
[2:03:12] [Applause]
[2:03:25] [Applause]
[2:03:28] he said I have a church with us my
[2:03:31] business or a cow to present to himself
[2:03:35] dealers with nobody else doing it by
[2:03:38] himself
[2:03:42] and you want me to dance in your church
[2:03:46] I'm sorry I'm one of them people who
[2:03:49] give you moves honey
[2:03:51] somebody tell not new that don't just
[2:03:58] belong to my mama she gave it to me

[2:04:14] silver bracelet with the hog wailing

[2:04:19] why you know what your feet lay low at
[2:04:22] the tone

[2:04:30] has breath praise she's alone oh my man
[2:04:36] I'm running out of time all the time
[2:04:39] look Jolla had to play the role of a
[2:04:41] backslide to get these me who wasn't
[2:04:43] serving God I didn't supposed to but
[2:04:45] we're looking at it I know he was right
[2:04:48] with God water and then God puts them in
[2:04:53] the belly of a fish and journal begins
[2:04:56] to realize his error see God gotta get
[2:04:58] you in a place Holly way you can get
[2:05:00] back in your room you miss a couple
[2:05:03] lines hallelujah but God's sake
[2:05:05] these same lines waiting on you now go

[2:05:10] Solomon said whenever we look toward
[2:05:11] that temple that you were here I hope I
[2:05:13] see you heard those lines before honey
[2:05:16] so don't start rehearsing he's not
[2:05:18] praying right there in the red there in
[2:05:20] a bit of a wheel now how many of y'all
[2:05:23] pray some kind of weight don't like that
[2:05:30] loose he got loose in his bondage Karuna
[2:05:38] go ahead and play the rain God got a way
[2:05:41] to break every chain I said this before
[2:05:47] church think about heylia what we called
[2:05:50] to be the tambourine was created in a
[2:05:53] time of 400 years of bondage
[2:05:58] Miriam had a tambourine where did it
[2:06:00] come from
[2:06:01] it was created why they were in slavery
[2:06:04] because they had to play the role of
[2:06:06] someone that was insane
[2:06:08] but they still had instruments that
[2:06:10] we're going to dictate their future
[2:06:12] [Applause]
[2:06:15] it's a missile freedom instruments of
[2:06:18] worship and when they got on the other
[2:06:20] side of the Red Sea they brought those
[2:06:23] instruments that look like they were
[2:06:24] punish me honey and she stopped playing
[2:06:27] the instrument and they say all the
[2:06:29] tolerance of fire began to play their
[2:06:33] role hey Lucy huh
[2:06:36] but we look now it ain't over because
[2:06:40] John I have a role to play he couldn't
[2:06:42] go honey straight to Nineveh he had to
[2:06:44] go to tosha's for what the men on the
[2:06:47] boat see God had to get glory
[2:06:49] the Bible says those men offered
[2:06:51] sacrifice went down on the boat and say
[2:06:53] he serves the true and living God honey
[2:06:57] right there so to us you look like a
[2:06:59] bachelor but to him it looked like he
[2:07:01] was a man of God they didn't even care
[2:07:04] about the storm and ceasing and
[2:07:06] everything once everything was silent my
[2:07:13] donor is the intervener belly of a fish
[2:07:15] huh oh yeah a special fish hallelujah
[2:07:18] now the fish for some kind of weight you
[2:07:20] got directions turn Italy if Jonah was
[2:07:28] out of the will of God how does a fish
[2:07:33] know where God wants him to take Jonah
[2:07:41] the fish ain't got no mind but what
[2:07:47] we're saying the fish talk to God God's
[2:07:51] in control
[2:07:53] some kind of way God orchestrated all of
[2:07:56] this so he could keep glory but look at
[2:07:59] the idea brother in Here I am honey kill
[2:08:02] him man get scenes get in the fish honey
[2:08:05] we start to pray fish start going a
[2:08:07] little vague
[2:08:08] next thing you know funny the fish is
[2:08:11] like oh I'm sick I think I'm gonna stop
[2:08:14] right here
[2:08:16] I can't smell no more I'm tired I think
[2:08:21] I'm gonna stop right here and just so
[2:08:24] happen is right there had nothing now
[2:08:29] what's so powerful about that when you
[2:08:31] do your research we know that the people
[2:08:33] that literally worship the fish God I
[2:08:41] thought he was out of the will of gosh
[2:08:44] no he was playing a role he had to play
[2:08:48] that role so he could look like he was
[2:08:50] the fish guy Oh fish stop open his mouth
[2:08:58] people worship the fish car but a man a
[2:09:01] man with dust and the Lord telling the
[2:09:05] people to repent hey how can a
[2:09:08] backslider please repentance what was
[2:09:15] happening Church God was getting lonely
[2:09:17] out in the whole thing
[2:09:20] [Applause]
[2:09:21] somebody needed to play their role so
[2:09:25] ahead to play the room let alone of a
[2:09:28] backslider
[2:09:28] did he play the role of a fresh guy so
[2:09:31] God to get the glory
[2:09:37] you know what happened out of that it
[2:09:41] was the greatest revival ever recorded
[2:09:45] by one crossing over 250,000 people got
[2:09:50] saved in that one scene by me now how
[2:09:55] you gonna be out of the will of God and
[2:09:59] God weren't like that see don't judge it
[2:10:04] before it's over let's read a little bit
[2:10:09] in here and then I'm gonna get out you
[2:10:10] me honey this is her she says Jonah was
[2:10:14] it out just in case just in case y'all
[2:10:16] think the same in the message
[2:10:18] [Music]
[2:10:20] God said there's a profitable reason go
[2:10:25] go go go back and read your Bible Paul
[2:10:28] talks about the manifestation of this
[2:10:30] time that they waited for it for years
[2:10:32] but now we got how do you talk the Proms
[2:10:37] old he's old Daniel and different ones
[2:10:39] write it up don't know he say he's a
[2:10:40] filling up done right but in how are
[2:10:43] there honey is God opened the book God
[2:10:46] told us about honey let me tell you how
[2:10:49] important the seals are hugging God
[2:10:51] sending God sending a vindicated prophet
[2:10:54] now I don't know too many people that
[2:10:56] have ever wont written books or preached
[2:10:59] on the seven seals or the church changes
[2:11:00] I don't know too many people but I know
[2:11:02] there's some out there but the
[2:11:05] significance of it is how what's written
[2:11:07] changed the lives of the people that's
[2:11:10] when you know there's a real inspiration
[2:11:13] behind it and you know turns every plea
[2:11:15] of men who wanted to write about the
[2:11:17] seals and this blew me away when I heard
[2:11:20] just Hudler I was watching a documentary
[2:11:22] on on the oil what happened in Waco
[2:11:25] Texas I'm in the back some of y'all may
[2:11:27] be too young but Waco Texas there was a
[2:11:30] man hugs I forget his name but he called
[2:11:33] he wasn't David Koresh this man called
[2:11:37] himself a price this man honey went it's
[2:11:41] hard to say that he was Jesus he was
[2:11:44] Jesus what blew me away I remember back
[2:11:46] in the days when he saying Jesus I think
[2:11:48] Holly we actually met the man in Daytona
[2:11:51] Beach because we're falling with the
[2:11:54] Texas I think is a Daytona Beach and a
[2:11:55] friend of mine hunting wheels hustles
[2:11:57] back in freedom I went up to him and try
[2:12:00] to sell him some openness some opening
[2:12:03] shades 300 on shaking $80 some
[2:12:05] you know you're helpful you can't get
[2:12:07] all your money back but are you trying
[2:12:09] to get the money back what up - hey I
[2:12:11] want to say you say you how about the
[2:12:12] shaving man look at me saying I can't
[2:12:14] put those shades on my eyes because
[2:12:16] people can't see the Jesus in Jesus
[2:12:23] I ain't never felt like that but you
[2:12:26] know anyway this man how you say he was
[2:12:29] Jesus and all these things and blah blah
[2:12:31] blah he was playing a role but sometimes
[2:12:35] you can see a people play a role and
[2:12:37] you'll see that role don't sit in they
[2:12:41] doing something just don't feel right to
[2:12:44] me
[2:12:44] I hate Heights and I found that you know
[2:12:48] they shouldn't be doing it but it just
[2:12:50] don't sit right cuz we just had a and

[2:14:29] on you know what was happening I wasn't
[2:14:32] comfortable being an impersonator I
[2:14:38] wasn't confident play the role of
[2:14:40] something I'm not and I tried to hold it
[2:14:45] hold on says they even had one of them
[2:14:47] with to the African store and got me one
[2:14:49] of them one of them bees with the cross

[2:15:49] a hug and went to the bathroom for all
[2:15:53] so I could be myself
[2:15:56] see one thing about playing a role when
[2:15:59] you know your impersonate is gonna come
[2:16:01] to near because you can't hold out much
[2:16:04] longer it's gonna come to here well you
[2:16:07] know you may really say like you're
[2:16:09] supposed to be it's gonna come to in
[2:16:11] here when I say that to say Church huh
[2:16:18] yeah when we look in the scripture and
[2:16:20] we see that there were all kind of roles
[2:16:22] being played hung up
[2:16:23] Rahab played the role of Muhammad but
[2:16:26] she wasn't really a hard enough
[2:16:29] she was out in the prostitution and
[2:16:31] she and she she she gave up her cell she
[2:16:34] did all these things for a purpose why
[2:16:36] so God could get glory hurry up they
[2:16:39] look down and they criticize they call
[2:16:41] her they call all kind of name they call
[2:16:43] a prostitute now she played the role of
[2:16:45] a prostitute you should really work well
[2:16:48] the one that was gonna let the seed of
[2:16:50] Jesus Christ come through her body polio
[2:16:54] for a lot of people just think before it
[2:16:56] happens
[2:17:07] he said that God is willing if we are
[2:17:10] willing but we have our possibly this
[2:17:14] individual has a practically I can no
[2:17:17] more make a revival catches now I can
[2:17:21] never make a revival out of it or a
[2:17:24] meeting than nothing and no one
[2:17:27] individual or no just two people three
[2:17:30] of you how you three of you it'll take
[2:17:35] all of us see that you want to see in
[2:17:40] your church you've got to be a part of
[2:17:41] it you can't just put on a pressure on
[2:17:44] the ministry all the musicians or
[2:17:45] whatever you got a neighbor play honey
[2:17:47] and when you think about playing a role
[2:17:50] honey you gotta have those token things
[2:17:52] just so he could get glory Oh God
[2:17:57] amen when we look we look how how he
[2:18:00] changed man this was a promise a
[2:18:02] republic God said he said and God what
[2:18:05] what he does he just changes himself to
[2:18:08] be
[2:18:08] come to that generation to make know
[2:18:11] himself to that people holier so for
[2:18:14] every generation God changes his manage
[2:18:17] to fit the needs of the people so the
[2:18:21] need of those people the need of you and
[2:18:24] I what we're striving for perfection I'm
[2:18:28] not striving for just to be justified no
[2:18:32] we got that boy ain't striving for
[2:18:34] sanctification we know how to dress
[2:18:36] I ain't striving for gifts we got gifts
[2:18:38] in our life what I'm striving for the
[2:18:40] home I'm striving for the perfection
[2:18:43] hallelujah and we look at it there's a
[2:18:45] role to be played everybody has a role
[2:18:48] to be played and I want you to
[2:18:49] understand when you play a role it has
[2:18:51] to be in sync
[2:18:54] think about it we get up here musicians
[2:18:57] come it's only to come and we start
[2:19:01] singing a song and I'm in the key of C
[2:19:04] and then the kid elf song that's gonna
[2:19:08] sound like a mess because somebody ain't
[2:19:12] playing in Rome right you know musician
[2:19:14] can look at me and they say but I ain't
[2:19:22] built like that I can't play that role
[2:19:24] so they have to be able to hire you
[2:19:27] forget about their own home and help me
[2:19:31] with mine and then we all get blessed
[2:19:36] sometimes you got to forget about
[2:19:37] yourself and place for that person you
[2:19:40] know is in need hunger and either
[2:19:42] everybody get blessed earlier such as
[2:19:45] we've got to work as a team hariya look
[2:19:50] like i just said about Rahab
[2:19:52] she look like she was a prostitute but
[2:19:54] God was working things all in it like I
[2:19:56] said last night honey
[2:19:57] God took a three days journey and made
[2:20:00] it 40 years probably God say was three
[2:20:06] to five days to get to the promised land
[2:20:08] why did it take 40 years you say cause
[2:20:11] the people who complain is old somebody
[2:20:13] played that role somebody say I'm hungry
[2:20:16] they had to play that role and God
[2:20:19] dropped the bread down film they stopped
[2:20:22] you don't want you eat all that bread
[2:20:24] you get thirsty
[2:20:26] and there's somebody say how thirsty you
[2:20:28] ain't first yeah I'm thirsty
[2:20:30] stop the whole church again see all
[2:20:33] these roles had to be played Moses goes
[2:20:36] over the islands ticket wait no more
[2:20:38] than we need to get off a Golden Calf
[2:20:40] all these things had to be played just
[2:20:43] flow the church up why did God slow the
[2:20:46] tree allowed the church to be strong he
[2:20:48] couldn't just kill everybody they leaned
[2:20:49] over there but he had certain rules they
[2:20:52] had to be playing that this brings us to
[2:20:54] Rahab God could not let it go three days
[2:20:57] or five days because they were got there
[2:20:59] in three days or five days way that
[2:21:01] wasn't born yet so if we're having
[2:21:05] boiled hot Jesus Christ won't come to
[2:21:07] see if we haven't bought a know both
[2:21:13] hands they know Ruth may have a boy they
[2:21:16] know over they know Jesse
[2:21:18] there ain't no David there ain't no
[2:21:21] Jesus
[2:21:22] so God sometimes gosh rolling it up
[2:21:39] because some people ain't in position
[2:21:42] yet sometimes it look like things ain't
[2:21:47] happening church like it supposed to God
[2:21:49] intention is showing it up cuz we won't
[2:21:52] change into position we listen when
[2:22:04] things happen honey best thing for us to
[2:22:07] do is just be quiet
[2:22:10] go pray because you know come down we
[2:22:13] can no no you just pray better yet call
[2:22:23] that person and encourage them play a
[2:22:27] room cuz we want God to get glory right
[2:22:30] listen the public God say he said he's
[2:22:33] saying he said uh he said why did God
[2:22:36] let this happen he told my hoots with my
[2:22:38] Abraham listen a man listen
[2:22:41] April help everybody all right listen
[2:22:47] God's o Abraham hey you the Father faith
[2:22:49] you gonna have a child and then all of a
[2:22:53] sudden Pharaoh come up she saying yeah
[2:22:55] we have a child but it's gonna be
[2:22:57] through Hagar why did God let that
[2:22:59] happen
[2:22:59] why do you let that happen because there
[2:23:03] had to be some kind of opposition cuz so
[2:23:05] God could show how great he is in his
[2:23:08] elected church so they had to be a group
[2:23:12] of false belief had to be some false
[2:23:17] roles being played people that say they
[2:23:20] services let's say they dollars and it
[2:23:23] really ain't remember chance either
[2:23:26] you're gonna play the role of good on
[2:23:28] the role of band Judas played the role
[2:23:30] of a devil
[2:23:32] it was he really the devil yeah that
[2:23:36] spirit all he played the role and as in
[2:23:39] that spirit left what he did kill
[2:23:41] herself
[2:23:42] because once he realized what he did he
[2:23:44] came to his senses so he wasn't really a
[2:23:47] devil he just played the room you have
[2:23:53] to be careful what kind of spirit you
[2:23:55] let lead
[2:24:00] listen Abraham Sarah they marching Holly
[2:24:04] they're going the next thing you know
[2:24:05] honey we think they walk down here this
[2:24:08] a young king young king sees them but
[2:24:13] the phone even even see Sarah Abraham
[2:24:15] picked it up in the spirit so ever ham
[2:24:18] changed man right the same ain't your
[2:24:21] husband ain't you later
[2:24:24] I'm you I'm you on your brother she
[2:24:27] changed man he changed roles he changed
[2:24:29] role he said they gonna kill me
[2:24:32] they don't want to kill me because you
[2:24:33] knew my wife whatever and it's been said
[2:24:36] that back in those days and customs when
[2:24:39] the king wanted a woman it didn't matter
[2:24:40] who you would he kill you and take your
[2:24:42] life and Abraham feared that so he
[2:24:45] changed massively Abraham's egg good
[2:24:48] good
[2:24:50] see in the midst of him changing roles
[2:24:53] he forgot to give God glory because if
[2:24:55] you were really caught it here to see
[2:24:57] that severals in position now to have a
[2:24:59] baby but because of his own fears he put
[2:25:03] on the wrong mask hi Lisa he went from
[2:25:06] husband to brother which they actually
[2:25:09] was system brother but that wasn't the
[2:25:11] time for him to be a brother no he was
[2:25:15] supposed to be husband but he stepped
[2:25:17] back into a role that was paid out
[2:25:20] [Music]
[2:25:22] [Applause]
[2:25:24] don't live in a scene that's already
[2:25:27] been acted out radio part that's now
[2:25:31] play the part that the church needs now
[2:25:34] you step back into something you used to
[2:25:36] be see at one point he loves her brother

[2:27:38] yeah he gives Sura back to Abraham honey
[2:27:42] Abimelech is all right everything is
[2:27:44] safe because God had to put it in the
[2:27:46] law and sometimes we were stepping do
[2:27:48] things don't worry about what people say
[2:27:50] God Street see we say we say we say
[2:27:54] uh-uh why the Prophet Sawa's and why did
[2:27:56] God allow that to happen because God had
[2:27:58] list several roles play out in the

[2:28:59] had some guys come and play the role her
[2:29:02] and some even they'll sound convincing
[2:29:04] and even when even when maybe Rachel man
[2:29:07] without was seeing things she was
[2:29:08] supposed to see because she was
[2:29:10] in that time or in that moment maybe

[2:33:29] father he wants to be bothered that way
[2:33:32] he does know don't never think that you
[2:33:36] could ever exit much of God I believe
[2:33:40] the scripture says you have not because
[2:33:42] you ask not and you ask not because you
[2:33:46] believe me now what I'm doing I'm
[2:33:49] quoting the prophet and the Prophet is
[2:33:52] quoting the Bible so let me ask this
[2:33:55] what's the problem what's the problem
[2:34:01] home the Prophet always brought us to
[2:34:04] the Bible so if I read a poem is
[2:34:07] biblically inspired he said he won't son
[2:34:16] and besides when you go beyond the
[2:34:19] curtain of time hallelujah and the
[2:34:21] people hardly are saying this the people
[2:34:23] are talking to you in the saying you
[2:34:24] know I'm one of your comfort than what
[2:34:26] an Angels talking to you but with people
[2:34:28] funny the people talking you let me to
[2:34:31] cut when I was just 19 years old
[2:34:34] listen that lonely steep beginner
[2:34:36] actually say well I want to see the Lord
[2:34:37] say where he's in a higher realm you
[2:34:40] know it was two people talking to him
[2:34:42] his converse hallelujah Church and then
[2:34:44] utilizing without and everything and he
[2:34:46] says well we were parlor his groupie
[2:34:49] there and he talking
[2:34:55] they talking all the stuff him to come
[2:34:59] at the Bible and all these things let's
[2:35:01] get back to the Bible at all always in
[2:35:04] the Bible even he confessed that he was
[2:35:07] reaching out in the Bible
[2:35:09] cuz when when they said that he several
[2:35:11] Paul's groupies there he said they said
[2:35:13] they said yes he said cuz I preached the
[2:35:16] same thing he preached and the people we
[2:35:19] as we said we're resting on that because
[2:35:23] we're not depending on the words of
[2:35:25] brother Branham we were preaching the
[2:35:27] Word of God play the role or play it
[2:35:34] right
[2:35:35] we don't rush of the man we stick with
[2:35:37] the Word of God and he wasn't a Bible
[2:35:41] based people we wouldn't be following
[2:35:44] him we're resting on I want you to catch
[2:36:00] he say he wants us to ask and believe
[2:36:02] that our choice would be full he wants
[2:36:05] you to ask abundantly and acts big
[2:36:07] things
[2:36:08] don't let your faith oh yeah he said
[2:36:10] don't limit your faith to some little
[2:36:12] mustard seed he said get out there how
[2:36:14] do you say he said get out here to some
[2:36:16] kind of faith and move out into big
[2:36:19] things did you hear me
[2:36:22] big things let me finish
[2:36:25] look the proper God says he says you see
[2:36:31] they could not figure out God's love
[2:36:34] they thought that love meant no
[2:36:36] suffering then this is the just of what
[2:36:39] I'm talking about and I'm gonna leave it
[2:36:40] alone he said they couldn't see that
[2:36:43] God's love he said but they felt that
[2:36:47] love meant no suffering they thought
[2:36:49] that love meant a baby with no parental
[2:36:52] care that God said his love was elective
[2:36:56] love the proof of his love is election
[2:36:58] that no matter what happened his love
[2:37:02] was proven truly by the fact they were
[2:37:05] chosen
[2:37:06] to salvation because God had chosen you
[2:37:08] to salvation through sanctification of
[2:37:11] the Spirit and belief of the truth he
[2:37:14] say that listen to this church we talked
[2:37:16] about God choosing you in his love
[2:37:18] Hanyu and what he's committed us to the
[2:37:21] role we must play listen touch he says
[2:37:23] he said he may commit you to death as he
[2:37:28] did Paul Paul understood his role when
[2:37:32] Paul II told no no gonna see they say
[2:37:34] for this purpose I came he knew it wrong
[2:37:40] Church he didn't shout out from getting
[2:37:43] whipped and scarred and all these things
[2:37:45] says he won't happen of New Testament in
[2:37:47] jail that was his role he wasn't
[2:37:51] thinking about his own way of being
[2:37:52] church he was so locked up in his word
[2:37:54] one winter you say hello yeah can you
[2:37:57] bring me a coat that man knew his room
[2:38:05] he says he may commit you to death as he
[2:38:08] did Paul he may commit you to suffering
[2:38:11] as he did Joe Joe had to play a role
[2:38:16] honey
[2:38:17] lost his money lost his cattle lost his
[2:38:19] children lost his wife knows all his
[2:38:22] friends you're playing a role why
[2:38:24] so God could get glory so that all that
[2:38:26] he loves you've never seen one time this
[2:38:31] guy will commit you to so he can get
[2:38:34] glory but you don't choose that hunger
[2:38:37] is God's choosing listen he says he is
[2:38:42] how easy that is his hunger prerogative
[2:38:46] he is sovereign but in all with the
[2:38:49] purpose if he did not have a purpose
[2:38:52] then he would be the author of
[2:38:54] frustration and not the author peace his
[2:38:56] purpose is that after we have suffered a
[2:38:59] while huh we will be made perfect so
[2:39:03] what is the suffering all about to think
[2:39:08] one of the roles all about perfection
[2:39:11] everything God is doing is perfecting us
[2:39:15] so when you see a role you see something
[2:39:17] being played out don't tell you
[2:39:20] let it go keep your mouth closed don't
[2:39:26] speak only because woman I won't you
[2:39:29] understand God cannot lie and God cannot
[2:39:34] fail so that means God does not worry so
[2:39:41] he'll let you go ahead and let you do
[2:39:43] this thing or whatever whatever he got
[2:39:45] to do to make sure what he saw his mind

[2:57:54] play your role 1 a a wonderful wonderful
[2:57:59] fountain there and just my mother digs
[2:58:02] just went in picked up Jonah and shown
[2:58:05] us that he was always in the public will
[2:58:07] of God everything that he was doing God
[2:58:10] had ordained you know and I believe the
[2:58:13] scripture tells us that the steps of the
[2:58:16] righteous are hoarded up alone so even
[2:58:19] when you and a backslidden state dog has
[2:58:21] don't get some glory out of that right
[2:58:24] he's gonna get some glory out of that
[2:58:25] and even when we've done wrong God's
[2:58:27] gonna get some glory out of that and I
[2:58:29] was just grateful you know using that
[2:58:32] going through Jonah I remember you know
[2:58:34] that I was coming from church I grew up
[2:58:35] and this a man of temping Pentecostal
[2:58:38] churches that you know they preach about
[2:58:39] Jonah he was always in fact slit prophet
[2:58:43] but it was only the prophet of God that
[2:58:46] I ever heard say no no he was not on the
[2:58:49] will of God he was he was right in the
[2:58:50] perfect will of God and you know I've
[2:58:52] never heard anybody bring out that the
[2:58:54] people of Nineveh actually saved the
[2:58:56] fish dog so when this fish got sick and
[2:59:00] decided to take a detour because he
[2:59:03] didn't have any intelligence of his own
[2:59:04] but he just stood up on the shores of
[2:59:06] Nineveh and when it gets there here they
[2:59:08] worship in the fish garden and he opens
[2:59:11] his mouth and out comes das prophet with
[2:59:13] the message of repentance only God to
[2:59:16] orchestrate something like that
[2:59:19] my I just I mean oh and when I heard the
[2:59:22] message brother branham brought that out
[2:59:24] I have never heard anybody bring that
[2:59:26] out before so I know you know this
[2:59:28] message is nothing but rules them in
[2:59:31] church don't don't don't don't don't be
[2:59:33] fooled by anything you hear anything you
[2:59:36] see I don't internet everybody's just
[2:59:39] playing a role and about this playing a
[2:59:42] role and we got we got some believers
[2:59:46] trying to go to Tarsus God somehow
[2:59:51] someway don't get into minima so I'd say
[2:59:58] what we just don't trust God we won't

[3:00:38] all over the world that's what they
[3:00:41] would do for denominations but as

[3:05:18] we felt but we felt Lord just led by the
[3:05:21] spirit to do this tonight he didn't ask

[3:05:30] to show our love we want to show our
[3:05:32] appreciation we want to show our respect
[3:05:35] to this gift of God's but I'm a witness

[3:05:56] that role is to be a full-time
[3:05:58] evangelist will thank you for this
[3:06:00] opportunity we have tonight and we pray
[3:06:02] God that you would bless it and multiply
[3:06:04] it as we give from our hearts tonight in
[3:06:06] Jesus name we pray amen and amen god
[3:06:10] bless you just give as the Lord would
[3:06:11] lead you amen and we'll go from there I
[3:06:14] wanted to just quickly to share a man of
[3:06:17] testimony you know some of you all might
[3:06:21] not know this a man but um but if they
[3:06:24] see often shares about the cancer a man
[3:06:27] that he he had in his brain and that was
[3:06:32] just
[3:06:36] that was on that was just one testimony
[3:06:41] right that was just one testimony and
[3:06:44] but there was a time for the digs before
[3:06:47] he went into full time ministry the Lord
[3:06:51] the Lord sent him the Florida
[3:06:53] - brother smiley church and he came he
[3:06:57] came and he preached as a blind man we
[3:07:01] saw him blind come up to the pulpit
[3:07:04] pretty much happened to be laying up
[3:07:05] here to the pulpit and all the time his
[3:07:08] eyes were open is when he opened up his
[3:07:10] Bible and he's there many preached and
[3:07:12] when he closed the Bible he had to be
[3:07:14] led off the pulpit
[3:07:15] that's his chair and we watched this you
[3:07:18] know and my heart just went went out to
[3:07:21] him when I when I saw us awhile it's
[3:07:23] just hard to believe this you know that
[3:07:25] this was happening and he was out there
[3:07:28] for the smilers and you know we come
[3:07:30] back our hearts broken and the very next
[3:07:32] day they went out to eat at Golden
[3:07:34] Corral and brothers brother smiley
[3:07:36] played the part he put a real difficult
[3:07:39] part brother these could see and brother
[3:07:42] thigs wanted something from them from
[3:07:44] the bar up there at Golden Corral and
[3:07:47] brother smiley total state now better if
[3:07:49] you know that we're not going to get it
[3:07:51] for you all you got to go get it
[3:07:52] yourself
[3:07:53] so brother they say okay if it's gonna
[3:07:56] be like that it's gonna be like that
[3:08:00] I'll go get it myself
[3:08:02] he went to the bar got his food in this
[3:08:05] I stayed open ever since that time
[3:08:09] [Music]
[3:08:12] but the purpose why God allowed him to
[3:08:14] go through that is because God was
[3:08:16] actually making things uncomfortable for
[3:08:18] him actually made forced him off his job
[3:08:22] they had to fire him because he couldn't
[3:08:25] see he was drugged driving forced him
[3:08:27] off the job and forced him into
[3:08:28] full-time ministry and we had been
[3:08:31] enjoying this gift of God when he's 20
[3:08:35] years and I'm grateful Church I'm
[3:08:39] grateful you know I you know even even
[3:08:42] we talk about the miracles and
[3:08:43] everything that God's prophet
[3:08:45] you know performed in different
[3:08:47] different testimonies we got some
[3:08:49] personal testimonies right amongst us
[3:08:51] proving that Jesus Christ is the same
[3:08:53] yesterday today and forever and I'm
[3:08:55] gonna tell you any time you are you know

[3:09:19] did God healed a blind man God healed a
[3:09:25] blind man we saw it with our own eyes
