but amen it's a it's a real honor to be here and it's a special time amen we appreciate you brother Jack thank you for the invitation to come and amen the opportunity to speak to you today and if you have your Bibles we'll go straight to the word we want to invite you I did the book of First Thessalonians the fourth chapter the book of First Thessalonians the fourth chapter and I do want to say it's a real honor to have my wife here and our little son Malachi with us and we sure sure thank the Lord for His blessings on our life and amen we want to say God bless you to all the ministers here and um I just want to say that I was thinking this morning I think the first time I met brother Jack was probably around 2013 in some meetings North Carolina and I remember the first message I ever heard him preach was the Holy Ghost is a must amen and I tell you we sure have appreciated this fellowship and he's never never changed always been the same and we sure appreciate him and his friendship and his stand on this message and amen what's being done here in the community for the Lord we just say God bless you all and just before you read the word let's just buy our hearts together and ask the Lord's blessings upon his word Heavenly Father the Lord as your Believers have gathered here this morning we're asking that your mercy and Grace would come down upon this meeting father we've not gathered here on this Resurrection Sunday to honor a code of morals or a code of ethics Lord we've not come here to punch a time card and fulfill a religious duty but Lord we're here because there is a deep calling to the deep and Lord At The Voice Lord of your word we must respond Lord as we come here today we're inviting you to come may you be both speaker and here in this meeting today Father may you take control of our thoughts take control of our motives our objectives Lord and father you know our heart Lord as we prepare to come to these meetings Lord had another Direction on our heart but father just yesterday feeling a change just a shift in Direction Lord you would lead us in this way and father to sit there this morning and hear the songs Lord father leading Us in the direction of rapture now father as we look into your word we invite you this morning may it be more than just a sermon but may it be a reality me the spirit of Revelation may it fill this room here today now father we pray you would break every Spirit over the hearts and lives of your children Lord refill us with the Holy Ghost fill with the Holy Ghost father may you refresh us today with your presence and we'll be sure to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory for it's in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray and all the Believers says amen and amen the book of First Thessalonians the fourth chapter and I want to look in the 13th verse I know this is a very a very familiar reading to the Bride of Jesus Christ in first Thessalonians 4 and verse 13 Paul says but I would not have you to be ignorant Brethren concerning them which are asleep that ye sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again how many believes that even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him for this we sing unto you notice how they say this how Paul says this by the word of the Lord so he's speaking to them by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep now the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout where the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first notice here Paul pulls these words from verse 15 again into verse 17 and says then we which are alive and remain shall be called up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore Comfort one another with these words amen I also want to turn to First Corinthians 15. and just pull one verse uh from First Corinthians 15 in the 22nd verse I don't know if you in the back there Brothers if you all can give me some more in this microphone in my ear and I'll control it on my side I'd appreciate it uh First Corinthians the 15th chapter and the 22nd verse it's a very beautiful reading speaking of the Resurrection the 22nd verse Paul says for as an atom all die but even so in Christ shall all be made alive amen I like that in the second Adam which is Christ shall all be made alive we asked Lord this morning to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you I can have your seats here this morning I want to by the help of the Lord for just a few moments if I may as I said I had a direction on my heart for the service this morning and just praying yesterday and meditating the whole Direction Changed so this morning I want to by the help of the Lord to speak to you on this thought of we which are alive and remain we which are alive and remain I I know you probably called it in the song services in the specials you were hearing amen the the sounds of a Rapture Amen in the hearts of the people I believe if there's ever been a time Amen to look forward to the Rapture or the second coming or the catching away of the church amen I believe now is the time to do it now remember says I'm going to be on the camp 1964. he said we'll all be called up together to meet the Lord in the air think of it amen missing people they can't see you no more but you're getting together with the rest of the group and they which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent that word hinder amen those which are asleep not dead no Christians don't die they're just taking a little rest see that's all and the Trump of God shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise first and appear to many and all at once you happen to stand and look and well there's a brother and you know it ain't going to be long amen now notice this he's separating this from those that are asleep Amen to those which are alive and remain and he says you'll be standing there and in a few minutes you'll look and there'll be a brother and he said in a few minutes we'll be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye and together with him will be missing on the Earth but will be called up to meet the Lord in the air now amen this is the this is where the burden of this thought this morning is coming from he said and to think with all that we have seen in the scriptures and the clear-cut vindications of the hour that we're living in it could happen before this service ends amen it could happen before this service ends what I just read to you amen from first Thessalonians 4 amen could happen before this service ends what I just read to you amen from a word Prophet that you could see loved ones appearing amen it could happen before this service ends I I think it's a very powerful thing to realize that the world conditions amen they're not going to get any better as I'm matter of fact they're only going to get worse amen politics is not going to get better Republicans Democrats Independents liberals concern they meant nothing is going to change the conditions of this world Amen this world has fallen underneath Bible prophecy amen the conditions are going to get worse then as the conditions get worse I believe that that should cause the Church of the Living God Amen to be looking forward more and more every day amen to the Rapture or the catching away or the changing of our bodies now you know the prophet of God comes in 1965. I've often said it like this people say brother Andrew what do you believe about the Rapture well I'll tell you it's in a tape called The Rapture 1965 Yuma Arizona go listen to him you want to know what I believe about the Rapture is what a prophet taught and he said we believe there will be a Rapture paragraph 28 We Believe amen there will be a Rapture all Christians believe that amen that Bible Believers believe there will be a rap sure amen how many Christians do we have here how many Bible Believers in Bible readers amen then all Christians believe there's going to be a Rapture paragraph 81 if there's not a Rapture friends amen then where are we at what are we going to do what age are we living in amen what promise do we have there is going to be a Rapture amen you didn't know you was going to help me preach but you are I mean look at somebody next to you and say there's going to be a Rapture amen amen there's going to be a Rapture I don't care what you're going through I don't care what you're facing amen there's going to be a Rapture I don't care amen what they're doing in the white house or what they're doing in City Hall amen there's going to be a Rapture I don't even care what they're doing around the ranks of this message and trying to change it amen and water it down amen a Bible Prophet has spoken there is going to be a Rapture and the Bible says there will be and it will only be for the elected lady the bride in the last last day amen that has been pulled out of the church amen then may I announce to you this morning that the time of the Rapture is at hand amen the prophet said a man asked me a few moments ago about the coming and the Rapture he said we've lived the time out the time of the Rapture is at hand and we're looking for a rapturing faith that can pull the church together and give it some Supernatural strength that can change these bodies that we live in when we see God raised the dead off the floor or out of the yard bring him back to life again presenting before us when we see a God who can take a cancer let's eat a man to a shadow and raise him up to a strong healthy man that ought to give a rap stream Faith to the people he said see when that light flashes from the sky and the trumpet sounds and the body of Christ will click quickly rather be gathered together and changed in a moment and taken into heaven there's got to be something like that happen and our schools of theology can never produce and I want to emphasize that our schools of theology can never produce it yet they intellectually are right amen but you've got to meet that light amen the only thing that can produce the strength for a Rapture is you got to meet that line you got to find that something listen friends amen if you're going to if you're going to go from here to Hawaii admit you got to find a ride to get there if you're going to go from here Amen to Beckley you got to find a ride to get there if you're going to go from here to somewhere else amen you've got to find a ride to get there there's got to be a mode of transportation Amen to move you from one place to another and if you're going to leave laodicea and you're going to go to the Future home if you're going to leave time and go back into eternity then there's got to be something get you there well I didn't come to tell you this morning that we're looking for something I come to tell you amen that we have what it's going to take amen take the church out of time and to put her into eternity we have what it's going to take to change gray hair back black again we have what it's going to take Amen to remove wrinkles and stoop shoulders we have what it's going to take Amen to call the dead out of the ground they say preacher we're looking for it you may be looking for it amen but there's a bride upon the earth that is found the revelation of the hour that she's living in we're not looking for the message amen we are the message we're not looking for the bride's Revival we are the bride's Revival people say well someday somehow or sometime I say if not now then when well somebody if not you then who amen there's not another age coming there's not another generation coming this is the rapture in generation this is the culmination this is the final age this is the hour when God has sent a message amen a message of light Amen to move you from one dimension into another this message is not by accident it this message is not a guess this message is not a happenstance the message of the hour is a claiming message amen the message of the hour is a claiming message you say preacher a claiming message prophet of God said I claim them for you tonight Jesus as your own personal treasure as chims in your crown as members of your bride I claim their lives another place the six sealed he said May ever call Child of God that's in hearing distance of here or other that'll hear the tape shall strike May at that time he said I claim them for the kingdom of God upon the basis of knowing this amen is the word that's being revealed in other words you didn't claim the message amen the message claimed you come on you didn't claim the message I meant the message claimed you amen let me say this you were not claimed by accident amen you were claimed on a purpose amen for a purpose amen and by a purpose you were claimed on purpose you were claimed for a purpose and you were claimed by a purpose you say what are you saying I'm saying amen that the Rapture has claimed you amen for its fulfillment come on church amen the Rapture of the Bible amen has claimed your flesh amen for its fulfillment amen somebody's hair is going to turn back black amen somebody's gonna be standing in the mirror some morning between six and nine and see their loved ones appear behind them amen somebody's going to be hearing the message and a cold sweep go across their body and a few moments they be changed I'm on church amen you want something to shout about amen that's something to shout about that out of millions of people on the face of the Earth amen that gone by a seed a predest the nation amen through foreknowledge claimed your body they meant to perform a paradox and it's not going to be a paradox of the fishes and Loaves it's not going to be a paradox a men of a man building an ark and surviving a flood it's going to be the greatest Paradox that God will take humanity and it'll change him back into a glorified condition in the moment in the twinkling of an eye they said we're living in a Dying World Church amen but we have heard a voice of life and that voice of life amen did not come from this world it comes from another world the Bible said behold I am alive amen forevermore who is that speaking amen that's Jesus Revelation 2 8 he said unto the angel of the church and some earn to write these things saith the first and last which was dead and is alive among which was dead and is alive I love what the prophet says the first thing that happens to a man is he is born is alive and the last thing that happens is he dies so this is not a man speaking this is deity now watch First Corinthians 15 22 said amen that in the first Adam all die in the second Adam which is Christ shall all be made alive remember said the man Adam took life and turned it into death but this man Jesus Took death and turned it into life amen Adam took innocence and turned it into guilt amen but this one took guilt and turned it into righteousness Adam took a paradise turned it into a waste howling Wilderness but this one is coming back to turn an earth rocking and reeling with destruction into another Eden amen notice this this second Adam the prophet said and here he is amen he is walking in the midst of Those whom he has redeemed even his church what are those who were redeemed we're not many like Paul murderers and corrupters we're not many like the dying Thief robbers and Men Killers but all are trophies of his grace all have been brought back from the dead dead amen all are made alive in Christ Jesus all are made alive in Christ Jesus the Lord as the seed of fruit then is in the midst of the fruit so is he amen the Royal seed in the midst of the church amen see he was dead but is alive he paid the price the sole ownership of the temple of God he rules it he's worship tinted and he resends anyone taking over his lordship and Authority he said no doubt the reason he introduces himself to each age as deity is to warn and comfort the people he warns the false Vine but he Comforts The True Vine he said this is the one true almighty God Amen hear him and live amen so the first Adam amen took amen took a paradise and turned it into a waste hell in the wilderness amen the first Adam amen took health and turned it into sickness they've been the first Adam took peace and turned it into chaos amen but according to the Bible there was a second Adam that was coming upon the Earth amen now think if the first Adam had a first believe amen then the second Adam is going to heaven Eve and she's not going to be a denomination that's going to take the word amen and turn it into Creeds and dogmas amen but see for the power and the anointing of the second Adam is going to turn the screeds and dogless amen back to the pure word and by that word she's going to take a Rapture and by that word she's going to change her body listen friends amen you're not just citizens of Palm Beach County you're not just doctors and lawyers hey men and school teachers or whatever nurses amen you are the Bride of Jesus Christ and the Bible says that the wife of God has made herself ready you are the Lamb's wife now I'll just say it to you like the prophet said we know there's going to be a right we know there's going to be a bride and there's going to be a wedding supper that's going to be served in the skies amen see and notice this that's just as sure to be as God is amen and the bride is going to be his church and they're going to appear before him without Puerto Rico and they have the material Amen on the earth now to make themselves ready listen we are not sinen amen through denominations to find some material to prepare us for the change of our body amen but when a prophet walked off the scene contrary to popular belief he does not have to come back and release the Revelation that'll change her body when he walked off the scene amen he could say his tongue said amen I must decrease and now he must increase amen then who was the increasing in the church it was not the personality well I might as well preach since I'm here it was not the personality of William random and I'm just going to go ahead and say it amen I'll tell you what we've done around the message amen we've made a mockery out of things amen we have taken William branham's greatest enemy and made the biggest Idol out of him than I've ever seen you say greatest enemy he said my greatest enemy is William Branham we got people baptizing in his name we got people carrying suitcases like him and wearing belt buckles like amen this message didn't come they meant to make a bunch of man followers amen but this message come they meant to break the Creeds and the traditions and the bondage that was over the hearts of the seed of God that they could come forth in the Glorious Liberty were with Christ and made them free listen you may not like us but I'm gonna preach anyhow we are not worshiping William Branham we are worshiping Jesus Christ the son of God the Lamb of God that has come into this world to take away the sins of the world I tell you what we've done William Branham spent years of his life trying to crucify his greatest enemy and we got preachers trying to resurrect it amen and wave Flags around amen I say it's time Amen to fulfill the word amen this time somebody amen lift up the son of man amen he said his eye be lifted up I will draw all men into myself they say preacher if you're going to lift up the son of man then you got a clip quoting a prophet I say hogwash I'm quoting with a prophet say it and lifting up the Son of Man and Dead feeding Devils while I'm doing it because there's an anointing on my life they meant to lift up the revelation of the hour that will change her bodies we're not looking for the material we're not idolizing the man that brought it we have received the message we receive the message you say what is the material I'll say this the material that will call the bride is the same material that'll prepare the bride and that is the message of the hour you say preacher what is this message of the hour mean remember so what are they getting at is it's God's promise of this hour what he promised he would do the message of the hour is no more than God's Promise by scripture of what he said he would do in the hour that you're living in then we're living Church in the hour of preparation the prophet said Noah was working away Not only was he performing a miracle but he was looking also for a miracle and the church today is laboring away under the task of preaching the gospel with signs and wonders of following they are preparing for a miracle among they're preparing for a miracle he said what is that it's the Rapture of the church and the going home amen preparing people getting them alive unburdened from the things of the world getting their soul set in the presence of God that when Jesus does appear the second time in glory those who are ready will Rapture and be called up together to meet him in the air and be with him another place he says which the Rapture will be an easy thing when Jesus comes amen they'll be called up but because they believe in such then come on Friends amen the Rapture is not some it's not something you're working yourself into it's not how many books can I read how many songs can I sing how many tapes can I listen to amen how many meetings can I attend I'm on church this Rapture is not sure do and amen it's your going amen it's God kidnapping you it's God snatching you it's God carrying you off come on Amen you are Juliet amen and Romeo is on his way and he's gonna snatch you away and he's going to take you out here what are you saying I'm saying Church to Living God there is a bride on the Earth today who is not working her way in this Rapture but the only reason she can shout about going in the Rapture is because Grace has made a way a man out of sin and out his Creeds Grace has made a way for this bride to go in this Rapture you ain't gonna work yourself into it you ain't gonna shout your way into it ain't no man gonna put you in it and there ain't no man can take you out of it it's the Sovereign Grace of almighty God it's the hour of adoption the promise said this is adoption time he said when the church in Christ will become so close together till Christ will become visible Among Us and he will raise the dead and we will go in the rapture Christ will become so visible among us that he will raise the dead and we will go in the Rapture brother Solomon I think that's powerful that when Christ and the church becomes one now we've got a whole message called the Oneness we got a whole message called the uniting time and the uniting China we got another message called United under one God right amen this message is a message of unity it is a message that is dividing you amen from the traditions of man and is uniting you with the Vindicated word of the Living God I love what Paul says he said he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning amen the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence somebody say preeminence that in all things he might have the preeminence remember said Christ the mystery his body was not held in the grave amen recognized with him in the resurrection same as he is now listen which means this he his word which he is has begun to be risen the word down to the age of Luther Wesley C has begun to raise up to its power there it began to move he said then it moved a little bit more he said but now somebody say now but now it's coming up to identification do you see amen now to the life in the body is a Vindication of the Rapture at hand when you see the headship and the body becoming one and the fullness of the measure of his manifestation shows that the body is about to be received to the headship when you see the life that was in the head manifested in the body it is a clear-cut Vindication amen that the time of the Rapture is at him look around I do not see a Corporal physical body of Jesus walking through this building this morning I don't see a corporate body brother Simon with nail scars in his hands or crowned The Thorn piercings on his head amen but I do see a body come on church I do see a body and what I see in that body is the same thing I've seen in the Corporal body when he was walking on the earth he's saying a corporate body in a corporate body he raised the dead in a corporate body he performed Miracles and a corporate body he spoke the word listen friends the prophet of God said this is the mystical Universal body of Jesus Christ then whatever was in the headship sister Erica was manifested Amen in the Corporal body and the same headship has come on to a universal body and with a hand done then to the body the head is to announce to the body the dead are being raised Sinners are being saved devils are being defeated sicknesses are being healed Revelation is taken over life you say how can you say that and when you see those things it ain't time to bury your head it ain't time to start following CNN and listening to Fox News it's time to lift up your head when you see life manifesting to the body it is a direct vindication and of warning that the Rapture is at hand what are you saying I'm saying all that was in God he poured into Christ and all that was in Christ he has poured into the church the prophet said those who are dead of the world they are alive in him we which are alive those who are dead to the world are alive in him and they are living in this present day they are making the word that God has used him for for oh that for ordained them he said place them their names in this bright book when the waters comes upon that seed that's in the heart it'll raise it up to be the bride of Christ now we've come to The Headstone which is the Capstone which is the ministry of cerebrum in Zechariah 4 where he says Grace Grace To The Headstone right amen notices the prophet said The Headstone crying what amen Grace Grace amen what passed from death and Creed into a Living Word of the Living God whether this is a power punch quote God's only provided plan for his age his sons in the the word AIDS quickened by the spirit like a spark that is lit off of something to make it alive and seated now in Heavenly places present tense amen already alive and subject to every promise in the word then what does that do you being a part of God's Gene a part of the word other man a part of God's word you're seated together you manifest the entire body of Christ because there's no leaven among you amen just the word only seated in Heavenly places in the door where he has put his name amen Christ Jesus now watch this he said no leaven among you when there's no leaven among you breath attack then that brings the entire fullness of the godhead bodily among you couldn't do it in Luther's age couldn't do it in Wesley's age couldn't do it in a Pentecostal age but in the day when the son of man is manifested revealed brought back the church together are you ready for this the entire deity of God amongst his people well if I was the devil I'd try to cut the air off too if I was a devil I'd try to steal your building too if I was the devil I'd try to bury you too because this is not a church Gathering where we're punching time cards and paying our religious duties but this is the entire deity of almighty God back on the earth in a flesh body I tell you why the devil's fighting you amen because Greater Works than this amen not your might do amen you shall do I say this if I was the devil I try to shut up Spirit true Tabernacle amen but I just want to stop here and preach for a minute amen after all satan through at this church you're still here and you're still standing and you're still preaching the message and you're still singing and you're still believing and you're still shouting and you're still dancing and you're still listening to tapes you know why amen because greater is the deity on the inside of you than the humanity against you and if God before you who can be against you oh I'm talking about a church I'm talking about a glorified church I'm talking about a powerful church I'm talking about a church where there's no leaven among them and the entire deity of God is in them brother well somebody say greater is the deity greater is the deity in you amen than the humanity against you I'm on your brother Capers you've been serving God for a long time Mr Capers you've been serving God Amen had every reason to quit and every reason to Bow your knee and say well it's just too hard amen but here they are on a Sunday morning in a hot building singing about the Beauty Land worshiping God I'll tell you what that is amen that's not the gene of Capers that's not the bloodline of Capers amen that is a seed of the almighty God that was placed in there from before the foundation of the world come on Church you know every church that's got three kinds of Believers right every church has got three kinds of Believers there's a make-believer there's an unbeliever and there's a real genuine believer do you realize inside every believer there's three kinds of believers inside every believer right here there's three kinds of Believers amen you gotta you got flesh and it's an unbeliever your flesh didn't want to get out of bed your flesh didn't want to comb its hair your flesh didn't want to come to church your flesh right now saying it's too hot Amen to sit in this building you need to go somewhere else amen but then you got a spirit and that Spirit to make believer if your favorite songs being sung you'll be shouting all over the place if your favorite preacher's in town you'll be on the front row amen but if you wake up in the morning and it's a bad report amen that spirit will drop in the low of lows and you'll say well I don't know if I can make it I don't know if I can go another day amen but let's not talk about the unbeliever and let's not talk about the make-believer amen but let's go to the real you which a prophet said is your soul amen come on Church the real you is not your flesh the real you is not your spirit the real you is your soul that's why you can shout when you're in a hospital room that's why you can praise God when devils are surrounding you it's because there's a soul all in there and that Soul's got a seed and that seed is a dermatized seed and that seed don't know the word quits that seed don't know the word turn around that seed has been ordained and predestinated and set in direction for Rapture I say a house of hell you might as well give way you ain't gonna stop us you can try next year we'll still be here you can try two years from now and we'll still be here because greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world crazy man there's a force there's a driving force when I don't feel like preaching I preach anyhow when I don't feel like singing I sing anyhow when I don't feel like worshiping I break out right in the devil's face and I worship anyhow because I'm not a flesh Christian I'm not just a spirit Christian I'm a soul Christian I love him for my soul I sing for my soul I preach for my soul I believe from my soul I'm gonna take a Rapture from my soul Hallelujah I think we ought to open the door and kick that devil out we're not here on feelings we're not here on Sensations we're soul Christians there's a soul in you that flesh is giving you every reason to quit but you're still here [Music] [Applause] hormones hurt I never hate you brother Troy that devil hates you you know why because you stayed under the anointing long enough that the anointing has baked all the greenness it's baked all the immaturity out and now there's a mature manifested Son of God I'm on Church you know what I'm talking about if you can stay under this anointing it'll bake all the immaturities out of you come on some of y'all are here and you're not here because you've got your favorite seat you're not here because you got your favorite parking spot come on but you're here because you're a worshiper you're a worshiper in the good times you worship God in the bad times you worship God come on sister Amen in the times when there ain't nothing you'll stand right up and say I'm still amen pressing my battle you're not pressing your battle from your flesh you're not pressing your battle amen from all the things of life you're pressing the battle from your soul and you're looking at Devil's Square in the face that devil says I'm gonna get you I'm going to get you I'm gonna get you in my immaturity since you know what I done I got scared and run back and said well maybe he's going to get me but I've laid under the anointing of a son of man long enough that when the devil says it now I swear my shoulders back and say devil if you was going to get me you should have got me when you had a chance if you was going to kill me you should have killed me when you had a chance if you was going to take my family out of the Redemption plan of almighty God you should have done it when you had a chance but the gene seed of God on the inside of you amen was stronger than the devil against you all right that devil ain't got you now he ain't ever gonna get you or say the deity in you saying I'm saying there's a seed of rapture in you the life is laying in the sea well that old depression devil don't want me to preach so it shouldn't have push back against me we're still here and we're still standing and we ain't going nowhere [Applause] we ain't going nowhere amen send us the back way and wreck our plane red plane directions wreck everything we'll fly here and there but we'll stand there and preach this message amen take our bills and we'll gather in a school room and we'll shout and sing until the Holy Ghost breaks out on the people this is not a church Revival this is not a temporary painful this is not a feeling Revival it's a word Revival then wherever you are brother Capers I think we ought to print up some T-shirts that says wherever I'm at there's a potential for a Revival to break out [Music] wherever I go wherever I be there is a potential that the Holy Ghost might break out and discern the thoughts and intents of the heart and change the outcome of a situation you say how can you say that amen because I might not just swing in the Billy stick and somebody say where is Laurel's Revival where is the worst Revival I can point to myself you're looking at someone else Revival they say where's the bride's Revival where's the bride's Revival is it in Jeffersonville is it in the desert is it in Tucson it's here in West Palm Beach Florida the bride's Revival amen is thundering seven Thunders it's ringing out Seven Seals [Applause] hallelujah it's a season of deity in the church we are still here therefore [Applause] I can't get away from this thought y'all remember how it used to be y'all remember in our immaturity when the devil through something matters we got all scared and backed up and said oh no I don't know what to do but now in our maturity when the devil foes something at us we go over and pick it up and throw it back say is that the best you got is that the best you got amen amen is that the best you got well we're going to take your bill we're going to raise the rent amen we just picked it up and threw it back said is that the best you got amen we're not serving God because of a building we're serving God because of the word that has been released in the age that we're living in there's a seed on the inside of you it is a seed of rapture therefore the bride this morning is preparing for this Rapture by the appearing of the Lord he said the appearing is different from his coming he said the appearing is Luke 17 30. it's getting them ready for the Rapture for the coming of the Lord see when you see his appearing it is preparation for his coming when you see his appearing it is the preparation for his coming see this is the day because there may not be a tomorrow so what are we doing we are living in the expectations of the soon coming of the Blessed Lord then the prophet of God will sit like this this is the time that these things ought to be preached now people say to me brother Andrew why are you preaching the revelation of this message well I said like this if there's ever been a time to preach it now's the time to do it right now's the time Amen to say I was preaching the Church of the day brother Jack and I walked out and the guy met me at the back door he said well there's two things I can say about you when you come by here I said what's that he said well the first thing you're going to do is you're going to tell us where the bride he said in the second thing you're going to do is you're going to tell us what brother Brown said now he probably thought that'd be a little bit of a shame to me but actually it was a compliment because the first ever been a time to tell the people who they are Now's the Time to do it and if there's ever been a time to say what a word Prophet said about you well I'm here I might as well preach that that's why I don't understand people say well Amy we need to set all the ministry down and just play tapes we need to quieten the ministry I'll Grant it to you amen that 70 years ago half the sermons probably weren't less worth listening to a bunch of nonsense a bunch of confusion amen but right now there's a Ministry on the earth and for the first time they've actually got something to say and they want him to quit preaching well it's the truth in how you can like it whatever it's the truth and now they want you amen but I say if there's ever been a time to lay in what a prophet said listen if you ain't going to say what a prophet said then I agree take your preacher coat off and go flip hamburgers amen but if you're going to say what a prophet saying take the gloves off get rid of the panty ways and stand with the prophet of God in the face of every opposite hell glory to God it's the truth amen but I'll tell you what we got I might as well preach that got a bunch of 65 preachers that don't have a backbone anymore to stand with a prophet so it's a lot easier to put a tape player in the pulpit and let brother Brandon preach against televisions and let brother Brandon preach against makeup and let brother Brandon preach against high heel shoes and let brother Brown preach against boys wearing shorts it's a lot easier to put a tape player in there because you don't have to bear the heat remember if you was a real man of God you would stand with a prophet if it shook the height off of somebody you would stand with what a prophet said and say that ain't nothing but the truth and this church stands with it this family stands with it this preacher stand oh better get out of here David I got a sword in my hand I think it's time we stand with the message of the hour regardless of what it cost us [Applause] I say thank God for men of God like right here in this church that are standing with this message Mighty shout out ouch me amen it's the truth anyhow first ever been a time to say it now it's the time to say it because as I said before the prophet said the Rapture could happen before this service ends in other words brother Steve we are on the verge of the Rapture now you know what that word on the verge means to means it means close to on the brink of the term uses the Verge in the sense of the brink or the border of something now the problem of God telling you it could happen before this service is over and and Brass serpent 1953 I believe that we're just on the verge Lord of one of the greatest sakings that the world has ever received and will all say Amen to that Thurston for Life 58 this Nation's on the verge of going into ashes at any minute right now and it could happen before morning Church we're 57 years since a prophet went off the scene seven major Visions 1933 amen six of the seven has been fulfilled come on Church the seventh one was I saw America as one big crater amen smoldering with ashes and listen we say Amen that could happen before morning then why can't we say Amen that before this service is dismissed this meeting in this church could turn into the meeting in the air now I'll say it like this on the verge amen means to go forward or to go backward if you're on the verge of something you're on the verge of going forward or you're on the verge of going backward according to Paul there are some who are on the verge of going back under Perdition but also according to Paul there are some amen who is on the verge of going on unto Perfection look at this word Perfection it means finisher one who has in his own person raised Faith to its Perfection see then I ask you the question amen here we are we're in 2023 amen the seals have been opened the word is in the bride the Revelation has come where do we go from here where do we go from here the prophet said we want to know where we go from here let's take the only book that can tell us the only book that can tell us where we go from here is the Bible the book of redemption the prophet of God called it a road map amen from the Cradle to the Grave he would say how can you have a map amen now watch this you can have a map and still go in circles without a god now I know some of us young people here probably have a hard time believing it but at one time they didn't have GPS cell phones to get from here to there at one time you actually had to stop go in a store buy an atlas come on Church go in there get it brother Smiley's Pizza with me amen go I remember one time we was on a trip years ago I was just a little kid I remember we got we was going somewhere I can't remember but I remember we was on a back road and we found a little gas station brother Capers my grandmother she went there and she got an atlas she brought that Atlas out I remember we sat there for a few minutes she flipped through it flipped flip through it amen she finally got up and went inside and said where am I at see you can have an atlas but if you don't have a God then you'll still be going in circles and for 2 000 years we had the Bible but we did not have a guide to tell us where we was had we had preachers placing Us in all seven Gentile ages we had them saying we're here and we're there but according to John 16 13 when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all truth the prophet said in other words he will be the one that will reveal the thing you see so you're looking at the map but you don't know where you're at but the God shall descend into the church and he shall take the map and he shall say here's where you are you are in the revelation of third chapter you're in the layout of sin age your seventh star is the star of Malachi 4 it's the star of Revelation 10 7 it's the messenger it's rubable Amen this is where you are now listen you're not going back to Luther's day you're not going back to us this day but I have clearly identified where you are and your next step is rapture well I feel like shouting right now your next step is the rapture so then he would come along and say now I'm going to preach to you on the Seven Seals right can I take some Liberty here in the seventh seal open in paragraph 43 he says now heavenly father as this goes forward now to preach or to teach on this Great Mighty event that's taking place in glory some 2000 years ago and was given to the great beloved Apostle John and tonight we're to speak upon it you ready for this let the Holy Spirit Come forward now in his mighty power of Revelation that he might reveal to us that thing which he wants us to know he might reveal to us the thing that he wants us to know he said as he has in the last few nights now you always throw the message no you can go to your seven seal tapes you can listen to the first to The Sixth Seal and hear them come to a point and say Here's my revelation of it like the first seal he'll say now here my Revelation it's the Antichrist Spirit seconds he'll hear amen but you come to the seventh seal and the proud of God says here is my revelation of it and starts talking about his own Ministry and so you say well I thought it was going to be a revelation of the seventh seal so you go back and listen again and you come back to the same point here's my revelation of it and he starts talking about his ministry he starts talking about Sabina Canyon he starts talking about Junior Jackson's dream he talks about the Crowbar come down out of the Skies broke the cap off the pyramid and there was some White Rock laying are you hear him he starts talking about his ministry amen do you realize amen that the seventh seal amen was the ministry of the seventh angel which was the Fulfillment of Luke 17 30 which was the preparing of the Lord the preparation for the bride listen friends amen I this may get me shot someday but I'll say it anyhow brother random is not coming back the word is in the church [Music] the Bible has been open though well come on let's put our let's let's go into some swimming Waters can we the word is already opened the prophet said when that sword come in my hand he said it was I was so inspired and I was so directed listen people say well someday brother Jack the book will be open according to a prophet who would dare say that wasn't the inspired word of God when he foretold it here and sent out yonder to Arizona brought it right back even with science everything else improved it so this book is already opened that's right now watch this just waiting for the seventh seal to be identified of the coming of Christ or the Capers he did not say waiting for the seven seal to be open he said waiting for the seventh seal to be identified amen which is the coming of the Lord now you know it'll start talking about three pools right and he will identify what those three pools are I'm preaching you the Rapture he will identify the first pool was healing he will identify the second at Paul was prophesied he will identify the third pool amen was the revealing of the word or the opening of the word and he will say remember the third poor was the opening of them Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word no higher order to reveal it than a prophet now we talked about three kinds of Believers right in every Church believer unbeliever make believer do you realize that those three pools amen can actually be taught back to a prophet saying that you are a Triune being you are a body Soul and Spirit right amen that first pool was dealing with your flesh the healing of your body that second pull was the discernment of what was laying in your spirit that was causing the Affliction in your body but when you come to that third pull it was the reveal and not of the heart of the church but the revealing of the Heart of Jesus Christ amen of the back part of God's mind come on church amen we're not just the first bullbride we're not just a second pool bride amen but the first ever been a time to preach the Third or amen you are a third poor bride with a third puller 19 with a third pool power program said like this amen can I just take some Liberty they said everyone knows that amen the first one was identified second been identified and if you'll think you're closer you who are spiritual here he is the third is properly identified sea we know where it is the third pool is here the third pull is here uh oh my I never one time right when I first started preaching out on the field of traveling I was preaching out of the message is this a sign of the answer and in that date remember says these words he said is this that third poor he said they will bring the power of Christ back in the church he said you draw your own conclusion for the Capers I sit in my my room as a young boy studied and when I heard that something just surged through my body and I said it's that brother Branham and when I said that there was a power dropped in my heart amen people say well we want the power of God in the church amen listen the power of God can only come by God's provided way and God's provided way of ushering the power back in the church was not fancy footwork it was not fancy Keys it was not good music it was not well-dressed pliers it was the revealing of the word would be the road would be God's provided way to Usher the power of the Resurrection back into the church he said that watch the third pull then see amen will be absolutely to the total loss but it'll be for the bride amen and the church right there you can back every devil up and say Amen the third pool is to the total loss but it's for the bride it's to the total loss but it's for the bride I'm on Church who is the bride she is the rapture elect lady that third pull is your pull program said what is that seventh seal it was the coming of the Lord Matthew 24 36 at that day I'm going somewhere stay with me no man knoweth no not the angels of heaven but my father only first heal he says don't go down John and say now this is just what it is now what's under this seventh seal don't go down and tell that for if I tell John that then all down to the age the whole plan will be broke it's a secret if you want to study that you can go to sudden secret go in the way of the church 1958 and Jeffersonville retitles it the sudden secret going away the church but if you look underneath that title it says secret rapture oh God is this okay it'll be a secret he said nobody's gonna know when I'm coming I'm just coming see that's all it ain't for my business to know when I'll just be ready now I know since the seven chills come we've had all kinds of teachings we've had all kinds of doctrines all kinds of ideas but a few months ago I actually went through the seventh seal and actually began to find prophetic instructions when the revelation of the seventh seal was released to the church I found the prophet say this so paragraph 322 so the thing for you to do is remember that I speak to you in the name of the Lord be prepared for you don't know what time something can happen paragraph 390 he stops and says now do you notice on the opening of the seventh seal it's also in a threefold mystery now it's in a free-fold mystery okay now we can go to Christ the mystery of God how was that revealed in a threefold manner the first fold was he will reveal himself the second fold is he will take preeminence in the body by the revelation of himself and the third fold was amen by the revelation of himself having preeminence in a body he will lead a bright church amen back into the Garden of Eden condition again what are you saying I'm saying you can go to first Thessalonians 4 which the prophet preaches in the Rapture tape and says now here's the revelation of the Rapture the Lord himself shout his sin from heaven with a shout he said what is the shout it's the message it's the living bread bringing forth the bride he said then the voice what is the voice it's the voice of Resurrection the same voice that called Lazarus from the grave he said in the third part of the Rapture will be the trumpet which will gather the Bride As the marriage supper of the Lamb listen friends you cannot argue with this message you cannot argue with this Prophet among people say well brother Andrew don't stop there okay let's go to Revelation 10 shall we the seventh seal will be revealed in a threefold mystery he said watch he said Revelation 10 is the seventh seal do you realize in Revelation 10 there's three parts there's Revelation 10 1 which is the mighty Angel descending with an open book amen there's a second part which is revelation 10 7 which is an Earthly Angel receiving the open book from the mighty Angel but some people just stop there but let's not stop at the same thing so let's go to Revelation 10 8 there was a man there named John who a prophet identified was a type of the bride and he said John said give me that book right there in Revelation 10 amen there's a mighty Angel there's a seventh angel and there's a bride receiving the Revelation which is putting her in condition to change her body her bones Church there's not a bride looking for the Revelation I predict I propose to you this morning you are in possession of the Revelation that'll change your body come on Amen you want to know how quick it's going to happen heard me remember to say this morning he said twinkle your eye he said just tweak their eye he said that's how fast amen the Rapture will take place well if we're waiting for a tent and we're waiting for an airplane and we're waiting for some brother Branham to come ride a white horse out of the West amen you cannot blink your eyes and all three of them things happen in the blink of an eye but I can prove by infallible proof in the word of God and I can blink my eye and when I open my eye you can have black hair again when I open my eye I could see my loved ones we're not looking for the Revelation we're in possession of it or are you saying I'm saying prophetic instruction from the seventh seal paragraph he says here paragraph 399 when he opened it see he omitted it again he said but now until that time let's just all pray and live good straight Christian lives looking forward for his coming paragraph 400 and now if this tape would happen to fall into the hands of some person somewhere don't try to make an ism out of it the only thing you do is just continue serving God yeah I feel the preacher coming on don't try to make an earsom out of it you just continue serving God you say what are you saying I'm saying amen that the prophet said there's a symphony taking place do you realize what a symphony is it's composed in four major movements four mate can I am I going too long do you have a time limit four four major movements I'm gonna hurry Luther Wesley Pentecost but you come the fourth one which was what was the Life coming in the body the prophet said then what's the next thing people say well the next thing is there's going to be a squeeze well the next thing is there's going to be a tent well the next thing is there's got to be a Horse Ride well the next thing is going to come back and go around the world and preach the Revelation but according to a prophet the next thing is a change in a moment in the twinkling of an eye we'll have to have a changed body the next thing in order for the church now is a changed body right he meant us old people go back and be young so much in the whole but we will and we will be there but we got to have a changed body in order to receive the sun we're going to meet him in the air amen Rapture will come a change in a moment in a twinkling of an eye then what does brother bam use for his opening text I know I slowed down here but I'm laying some word in in his opening text for the Rapture he reads psalms 27 right right and says this he says in the time of trouble shall he hide me in his Pavilion go look at that word Pavilion in the secret place of his Tabernacle shall he hide me amen he shall set me upon a Rock Amen what is a rock a rock is a revelation amen if you study psalms 27 5 you will find the word tent in Psalms 27 so if you want to preach a tent let's preach at the way a prophet preached it he said he will be in his tent come on church where is his tent it's not an intent Factory this morning being made it's not in a storage unit his tent is his bride you are the Flesh of the tent of the third pull I know what he said he said I'll ride this Trail again and a lot of I I pray this is okay a lot of guys have stopped right there but they never turn the corner with a prophet when he said she will ride this Trail again who is that she that she is the Bride of Jesus Christ who is going to ride this Trail the Bride of Jesus Christ what do you saying preacher I'm saying get off of your pity party get off of your ass Heap get off your spirit of condemnation and get on this word and draw your sword and ride that devil down and cut that devil's head off you are in position this morning by the Revelation to do such the true bride he says we'll be waiting for oh God I'm stepping over so much the true bride will be waiting for the Rapture revelation we are now in possession of the Rapture Revelation first Thessalonians 4 15 then we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord verse 17 we which are alive this word alive means can I preach a little bit here in closing to be among the living not lifeless and not dead to enjoy real life to have true life and worthy of the name to be active to be blessed endless in the kingdom of God I love this part brother Smiley to be in full Vigor to be fresh to be strong to be efficient oh God the prophet said there's been three raptures right he said now we which are alive and remain that's the bodies that are left on Earth foreign last time I checked you're not in the graveyard we're not taking you to a funeral parlor this morning you're in the house of God your body has got life in it and you're on the earth now I wanna I wanna stop here and just show you this in a moment amen if you'll go that first slide uh some of you may have seen this I was actually in Jeffersonville went by voice of God and I took these pictures amen these are actually brother branham's notes on the Rapture if you ever seen it it's a powerful thing look at brother Jack I look at them notes and think man he preached that with just a few pages go the second page go to the third page you see here go to the fourth page then the fifth page see that was a prophet's notes on the Rapture if you can go back to the second one I'd appreciate it in the second one here he says now he says uh one more Yep there now the Rapture is only for the bride church I was looking at this brother Jack and it come out at me the elected ones in him from the beginning father spiritual genes which are attributes I got to look at this point right here he says now how do we get in him or come alive to it how do we get into him if you can leave that there how do we get into him or how do we come alive to it that's the same word that Paul is using in first Thessalonians 4 that we which are alive and remain which will be bodies on the earth will be called up amen and then the prophet in the Rapture tape says do you know there's only one term of the millions moving around that's ordained and there's only one egg that's fertile in the beginning way back before there was a time if you were a born-again Christian tonight you were in God being that's why you come in this life here and profess Christianity everything wrong you've wondered why this and all this and it's wandered at you but one day something struck you help me church one day something struck you what was it it was that life that was down in there from the beginning paragraph 108 thank commence filter what made you desired in the first place because down in your soul there was a predestinated seed which was eternal life it was always laying in the air it always was in there another paragraph what is it it's the germ seed word from the beginning that you was in God at the beginning standing here drawing the sea life and that seed is in Your Heart by before ordination the seed is already in there visible Union paragraph 222 The Germ that was in you at the beginning it found you here we go you are a predestinated seed just like Christ was then what is the Holy Ghost doing he says the holy spirit is coming down to Quicken or to make alive amen those people that's for ordained of God to be in the Rapture oh my then what is it it's the quickening power of the Holy Ghost it's the revelation of the message of the hour it's the appearing of the hormone church amen what did he say we which are alive I just couldn't say it I believe I'm preaching to people that you'll never have a funeral service I believe I'm preaching to people that you'll never plan a funeral I'm on church I believe I'm preaching to people that you'll never buy flowers for them preaching to people that'll never see a graveyard you say how can you say that because by the word of the Lord I speak to you in the name of the Lord concerning the coming of the Lord that we which are alive I want to tell that devil this morning and close them there is bodies upon the Earth and we're not dragging around like something half defeated and we're not barely hanging on come on I'm gonna preach my way right out of this one we're not barely getting by by the skin of our teeth but there's a fire in this bride there's a power in this church there's an anointing upon you brother Capers we which are alive and remain let me set you like this we are alive in him because he is alive in us we have come alive to it you say come alive to what to the reality of who we are I love this Easter seal and you are quickened and this quickening power brings your body into a raptured condition already oh brother your body this morning is in condition for the Rapture I love what a prophet says here I'm just I'm just beating the Devil up and closing okay the Rapture is in you right then the Rapture is in us now then in heaven today we are glorified in the presence of God we are just pushing out to it Remember The Word Alive to be in full Vigor to be fresh to be strong so according to Paul and brother Branham there will be bodies on the earth that will be full of vigor they will be fresh they will be strong how many years ago was this 57 years since the Rapture was preached now how can I talk about being alive and fresh and not talk about a man named Caleb Caleb for 80 years had been waiting for his mountain and brother Capers when it come time for him to take his Mountain I love what the Book of Joshua says Caleb looked at all of them and said listen your negative report is enough Caleb got tired of all the negative talk come on Spirit true Tabernacle if you're going to be alive and going to remain and going to be fresh and going to be full of vigor and going to be efficient and going to be strong you got to quit all the negative talk come on Amen that be that'd be like you sitting there amen talking about taking your kids on vacation and all the things you're going to do all the places you're going to eat all the good things you're going to see and then stop right in the middle and say I need to make my funeral plans before we go what kind of damper does that put on the expectation that's why amen we're not talking about the grave the grave is not our goal the sky is our goal Caleb stood there I love this brother brother Solomon he's standing there look at this mountain and they've got all these negative reports and Caleb speaks up and says these words now behold the Lord hath kept me alive as he said these 40 and five years even since the Lord spake this word into Moses amen the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness now lo I am missed a four score and five years old brother Jackie says this but yet I am as strong this day as I was in the days that William Branham preached the Revelation I'm as strong today as I was in the days Moses sent it he has preserved me for a Time such as this what are you saying I'm saying Church lift up your heads get rid of the negative talk get rid of well I'm not gonna make it and I'm not gonna overcome you are in position right now this morning to take a Rapture by the revelation of the word give me my mountain give me my Mountain Caleb you can't have it give me my Mountain Caleb you're too old to take it give me my Rapture come on church then I don't have time to finish it I'll preach it I'm just preaching here real quick this message has changed our language because the Rapture is in us and we are in the rapture we are feeding upon the faithful Saiyans of the revelation of the word and the age we're living brother Jack I got to think about to the day we're just down there at Louisiana that brother Tim Pruitt's in his wife's funeral sister Karen's we was walking out of the walking out of the graveyard and there's probably two 300 Believers out there and they were all literally standing around I can't hear it over and over some morning between six and nine some morning between six and nine I got to thinking about that I bet Funeral Directors have got a private WhatsApp group if they all talk to each other and say there's some crazy people come around here every now and again and they all talk about some morning between six and nine I tell you why we talk about fan it's because the revelation of this message has changed our language and at any moment any second any hour we're going to be like Enoch we're going to be here one second and the next second we're not going to be what are you saying I'm saying this this is another Ephesians this message is the Revelation that'll put you in position for the changing of your body Birmingham come along very beautifully and says it in Paradox he says what is it it is a revelation of the Unseen I love this he says the Ephesus is here brother Troy how are we going to get there we talked about a Rapture we've got a tape called things are to be we got a tape called the future home we got a tape called beyond the curtain of time and the prophet says the Ephesus is here I love this brother Jack he said this is the thing that will bridge between denomination and the glory land this message is the bridge between denomination and the glory land in other words I'm saying how many wants to go to the glory land how many wants to go to the Future home how many wants to go into things that are to be well if you're going to get there you got to have a ride but I leave you this morning by saying this your ride is here you're ride is here amen you need an Uber your Uber's here you need a lift your lift is here the message is your Uber the message is your lift this message is what's going to take you out of this Earth and set you at the marriage supper I'm on church we had a Great Divide between denomination and the glory land but a prophet said this message will be what will connect this denominational realm to that glory land Realm and she'll step out of time into eternity what he's saying I'm saying your right is here get in it it's a perfect ride let our musicians come what are you saying I'm saying there's gas in the tank there's fire in the engine there's oil in the motor you ever let somebody get in your car and drive you crazy because the first thing to do when they get it start changing things like don't touch nothing just get in here just get in it's a ride it'll get you here they want to change your air conditioner change your music change the seat this message is your ride it's perfect don't touch nothing just get in it and ride the Revelation to Glory [Applause] it's a perfect ride it's a perfect ride just get in it just say what a prophet has already said right just obey prophetic instructions continue serving the lord now I I I'll say this to you this is what will get us from here to the glory land I I remember one time a long time ago I heard brother biscal say something that's always stuck with me he said this message is what will get you out of this Dimension he said look right here right now when I'm preaching he said outside those streets of Vancouver he said loved ones could be walking the streets of Vancouver he said the loved ones could be walking right now the streets of Vancouver he said while I'm in here preaching to you they could be walking he said see but if you miss this then you'll miss them I said that's a preaching point he said if you miss this then you'll miss them but he said if you see this then you'll see them I said Amen brother bisco if you see this you'll see them and there's a bride this morning that's in Possession come on Sir amen amen you can see how can I preach you can see brother Roosevelt come walking around through this building this morning I'm not a crazy man I've seen the Revelation that has opened my eyes if I can see this I'll see my granddaddy if I can see this I'll see Paul if I can see this I'll see William Branham if I can see this for the Capers I'll seek Jesus Christ and I'll fall at his feet and I'll hug his neck and I'll kiss his feet and a love on him through eternity if you can see the Revelation you can see the future I want you to stand to your feet this morning [Applause] if you can see this you'll see them if you can see this if you can see this if you can see it you'll see them if you can see the Revelation what is the attraction it's God fulfilling his word sisters it ever dawned on you when you've seen something you can't unsee it when you've seen something you came and see it oh God there's a preacher anointing in this building this morning when you see something you can't unsee and I I remember a few years ago we went out to I was preaching over in Canada brother John Simons we went there after a couple Brothers with me brother Seth Martin brother Sean's son and then brother Isaac Hatfield Brother Ray Erickson's grandson Nathan Erickson I think you all know Nathan his cousin he went with us we

brother brother Solomon we pull up and there's a big barricade there and says well that's different uh you can't park here I said now man you said you knew where we was going he said oh I do I said now how we gonna get there and long story short we parked the car we get over there and said see he said I knew where the attraction was he said a lot of things have changed around it but the attraction Still Remains the Same he said I knew what I seen when I was a kid would still be there water rolling off the falls it was still there brother Solomon a lot of things changed around at Park and changed ways to get there but the attraction was still the same come on Church there's been a lot of change around this message there's been preachers come and there's been preachers go there's been churches rise and there's been churches closed amen but I tell you this morning get your eyes on the attraction it's never changed it's still Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever it's still the Rapture it's still the resurrection it's still Divine Healing it's still Miracle signs and wonders it's still the attraction let's buy our hearts together this morning and there will be a body left on the Earth that will be alive she will be alive she will be quick and she will be fresh she will be strong she will be continuing to serve God Faithfully she won't be making isms out of the Revelation she'll be feeding on the revelation she will be in position to change her body I ever had about ever I closed this morning will there be one could say Lord I want to be in that that condition I want to be fresh and listen I know there's a lot of things here that you've been through things you faced that could literally it's destroying other people but here you stand this morning fresh strong and efficient Heavenly Father as we come the close of this service we thank you for your grace this morning and we thank you for your power that is Lord wave after a wave come to this building today now father there's no way that I as a man can take this revelation and by my physical hands place it into the heart of the Church of the Living God but Lord your quickening spirit is here this morning Lord you can take these things and you can rightly divide him in the hearts of your children Lord maybe some here already knew some of these I'm sure most of them did maybe some here that are new that are growing in the Revelation and Lord your spirit can take it and positionally place him but father may we never let this message become a bunch of cliches and a bunch of isms and a bunch of this and a bunch of that oh God no may we allow this message to become our Focus may we allow this message to become amen the reason we get up the reason we Face another day now father I commit this congregation into your hands Lord we're not looking for the revelation we are shouting and rejoicing in the Revelation that has come in the age that we're living in father I believe if there's ever been a time to say what a prophet said now is the time to say it Lord I believe I've spoke to a group of people here this morning that are hungry hearted Eagles lord they're feeding upon this Manna and Lord It's given them strength it's making them feel full of vigor it's making them strong it's making them fresh it's making them efficient now Lord may this Revelation drop in the hearts of your children and Lord may they take the sword of the word and strike down every devil in the name of Jesus Christ father may they not let the world conditions may they not let their vocabulary change to World Language about politics and this party that party this this condition this economical problem May our May our May our vocabulary be the faithful Saiyans of this message which is the revelation of our change may we say it every day may we feed on it every day may we may we fellowship with our friends and our families around it until one day until one day we take that final drink from the inexhaustible Fountain and push out that final bit and our bodies are changed in the name of Jesus Christ we pray do you love him today do you love him today how many can say I'm going to take this revelation and I'm on a fat head devil and we'll knock him down brother Capers I I can't close by not saying this I told this to brother Jack last night I only know if you remember it or not but I was about I don't know 16 17 and I met you brother Fred Mullins I've told this around the country around the world actually I met you at brother Fred Mullins and I was preaching that night on the fire of God and the revelation of this message and that man walked out back he didn't know what I was going through he didn't know that I was preaching in message churches that I thought believed the message in men tell me don't quote brother Brandon and don't say this and don't say that and I walked out of that building brother case were standing around back he said we've been coming this meet for years I think y'all had the same room at the hotel there every year in Florence it's been come this meeting for years he said like this he said you believe God called you the preach this message young man I said yes sir I do he said if God's called you to preach this message and you don't have one Lord to preach it and didn't have a clue what I was going through he said you go out in the woods and find you a rock and start preaching this message that rock and capers you said somebody I'll come sit on that rock and I was kind of looking at you you said because God don't send a message and not somebody there to hear it I've taken that testimony and that that experience with that brother and our Lord and whip Devils around this world with that this message is the truth somebody's going to preach it somebody's going to believe it somebody's going to overcome bad and somebody's going to change their body by some morning between six and nine brother Jack would you come it's real this morning Shake somebody's hand and say I'll see you in the Rapture it's real [Music] let's give the Lord a hand of praise for the word of the Lord on today [Music] um just um absolutely blessed amen by Brother Andrew and but just even that last comment that he made about brother Capers asking him are you uh do you feel called to preach this message and um to me that's very very important brother Branham went through ordination and he was he started to ordain this one brother or a couple Brothers next thing you know all these people just start standing up and like I want to be ordained I want to be ordained I want to be ordained and uh so he began to just kind of ask anybody know this person because I just can't ordain if I really don't know him anybody can vouch that this person got a call in their life and I think there was a brother that was coming from the Salvation Army and he says well yeah I want to be I want to be ordained and brother Brandon say well now um we have a message and we were ordaining people to preach this message he says uh you know we just believe God's called us to something and as brother brother Andrew said this in his in his uh closing there this is our lift this is our vehicle to get us into the Rapture it's this message that God has sent us and the messages come through the scripture [Music] look how chapter four Revelation 10 7. Saint Luke 17 30. and they say the message is being able to recognize the the scriptures that are for your day see we're not living in Moses day if you see somebody putting amen Blood on the door and talk about they're getting ready for something something's wrong somewhere it's not going to be on the physical door but it will be on the door of your heart if you see somebody building a boat talking about jump in don't go get into that but I will tell you this when you can find yourself in the word of God get into that this is the vehicle we're not just ordaining people to ordain people we got a message and I tell you what I I I'm I've watched brother Andrew for a number of years he first came to us to preach he was 18 years old and uh now he's 26 and you know you can just see the growth that has gone that has happened in this ministry and just you know many of the things that he laid out as a pastor I would probably take a whole year to go through some of those things that he talked about today right and and I'ma just this one statement that he made but I I just the growth that I see in him and just the the depth of the word uh man we we ate this was this was spiritual food in due season and I know sometimes some of these things can go over people's heads we're not just shouting just to be shouting but there's a reveal word that is coming our hour that's pulled this shout out of us we know we stand but he made a statement there um if you can stay under the anointing it will bake the greenness out of you keep coming to church we're here on on Wednesday nights we're here on Sunday mornings but just keep coming to church it'll bake the greenness out [Music] I don't know why we're shouting this word this word this word this word we all come from somewhere uh my I was somebody was asked me the other day like um um our background yeah I was so you were Baptist right so no no my family on one side of the family on this side is Baptist but on this side is Pentecostal so we just caught in the middle of all this but when the word came when we understood by the word and I'm talking about by wait a minute what does it say right there I'll send you a line to the prophet before the coming of the Grateful Dead in the Lord and not not here's the other thing I'll send you [Music] I I'll send you the very last scripture in the Old Testament Hidden book everybody want to go talk about ties and offers in the Book of Malachi but what about God sending you a prophet I'll send you Elijah the prophet before the great and terrible that's a prophecy in scripture so when is it time for that to be made manifest you know there was Elijah came amen at the first coming of the Lord Jesus his name happened to be John the Baptist but he come in the spirit of Elijah and if there was an Elijah that came at the first coming and we know we're living in the days of the second coming then Jesus Christ the same yesterday that day and forever there'd be another Elijah had ever come before the second coming of the Lord Jesus not to turn our attention to Elijah but to get our attention back on Christ [Music] oh I thank God I'm locked in I got my seat belt on I'm ready for the ride man I tell you I'm I'm happy brother my soul is blessed my soul is blessed my soul is blessed I I I I I I I I made this comment a man um a few weeks ago we don't know we didn't understand why we were here why why God would just bring us here but what we've come to understand that if God just had one one person one person that he wanted to reveal all of this to then we
