[13:41] realized that how much I Savior loved us
[13:44] a man Ephesians the fifteenth chapter I
[13:50] mean the fifth chapter in the fifteenth
[13:52] verse says see that you see that ye walk
[13:57] circumspectly not as fool's but as wise
[14:03] redeeming the time because the days are
[14:06] evil wherefore be ye not unwise but
[14:09] understanding what the will of the Lord
[14:12] is and be not drunk with the wine where
[14:17] is in excess but be filled with the
[14:20] spirit speaking to yourselves in Psalms
[14:24] and hymns and spiritual songs singing
[14:26] and making melody in your heart to the
[14:29] Lord
[14:31] giving thanks always for all things unto
[14:37] God and the Father in the name of the
[14:40] Lord Jesus Christ made a Lord out of
[14:44] blessing to the reading of his word a
[14:46] man you maybe see that I want to keep it
[14:48] standing now we're going to go over
[14:52] start out here to Genesis Genesis the
[14:56] second chapter
[15:00] Genesis the second chapter
[15:12] in the seventh verse Genesis 2:7
[15:28] and the Lord God formed man out of the
[15:34] dust of the ground and he breathed into
[15:39] his nostrils the breath of life and man
[15:45] became a living soul a man if you go
[15:50] over to the second shot at a 21st verse
[15:55] and the law calls the deep sleep to fall
[15:59] upon Adam and he slept and he took one
[16:08] of his ribs and closed up his flesh
[16:12] instead thereof and the reel which the
[16:16] Lord God had taken from man made he a
[16:21] woman and brought her unto the man and
[16:26] Adam said this is now bone of my bones
[16:31] and flesh of my flesh she shall be
[16:35] called woman because she was taken out
[16:39] of man a man may the Lord had a blessing
[16:43] to the reading of his word
[16:45] let us pray Lord did Heavenly Father
[16:47] Lord I just actually Lord God - Lord use
[16:52] my lips O Father God my faculties Oh
[16:54] father God - just speak to your people
[16:56] of father God
[17:08] precious name Amen amen
[17:12] oh we're going to speak on this evening
[17:17] the power of the blood the power of the
[17:23] blood now I'd like you to go back to
[17:26] Ephesians for just a little bit here go
[17:30] back to Ephesians and we're gonna
[17:32] continue reading from the ninth the
[17:35] fifth chapter nineteen first a man
[17:39] speaking to yourselves in Psalms and
[17:43] hymns I'm sorry good of the 21st verse
[17:46] submit yourselves one to another in the
[17:49] fear of God he says your wives submit
[17:53] yourselves unto your husband's as unto
[17:57] the Lord for the husband is the head of
[18:01] the wife even as Christ is the head of
[18:04] the church and he is the savior of the
[18:10] body
[18:10] wherefore the church is subjected unto
[18:13] Christ let the wives be to their own
[18:17] husband's in everything husbands love
[18:21] your wives even as Christ has loved the
[18:24] church and gave himself for it that he
[18:29] might sanctify and cleanse it with the
[18:33] washing of the water of the word now I
[18:37] just wanna I just I just want to take my
[18:40] time a little bit here and I'll just
[18:42] lose one of talking just and let God
[18:45] just have his way like that alright
[18:47] we're looking at this scripture here a
[18:50] lot of times and we a lot of time some
[18:52] sorts of the read this passage of
[18:54] scriptures and they Creon's just a
[18:56] little bit because they looking at it
[18:59] through the eyes you know of the husband
[19:03] when I got to submit to this man and the
[19:06] man said get a little bit puffed up a
[19:09] little bit feel good
[19:10] you tell them - why not - do what I say
[19:13] they got to submit themselves to me but
[19:16] I want you to understand and realize
[19:18] that that script is not you
[19:20] talking to sisters that's if you look
[19:23] beneath that scripture that Scripture is
[19:25] talking to the bride if you read all
[19:29] down there the Bible says that now I
[19:32] heard you to know that this is a great
[19:35] mystery he's not just talking to women
[19:39] being subject to their earthly husband
[19:43] but he's talking about earthly bride
[19:46] being subjective to the Lord Jesus
[19:49] Christ amen
[19:52] we must obey and submit ourselves to his
[19:58] will and to his way now lately I've
[20:03] noticed here that the Lord has been
[20:05] leading a certain kind of direction
[20:07] we've had two ministers visiting
[20:09] ministers come to one minister said only
[20:12] you know if you have the baptism of the
[20:15] Holy Ghost then the other minister came
[20:18] and said I'm thinking that people don't
[20:22] realize that they really don't have the
[20:25] baptism of the Holy Ghost my brothers
[20:28] and sisters that tells me something that
[20:31] God is trying to tell us something
[20:33] my brothers and sisters if we took that
[20:36] the Holy Ghost should be and he is the
[20:41] most important thing to the believer it
[20:46] is the very life of God you might have
[20:52] heard me say recently a few times that
[20:54] God came down and created a blood cell
[20:59] in the womb of Mary a man that was not
[21:04] the blood of a man that shed at Calvary
[21:07] it was the blood of Almighty God that
[21:11] was shared there and Calvary for what
[21:14] for the remission of our sins that we
[21:17] can go through the blood and come out
[21:21] clean on the other side amen
[21:24] it has to be a new brush my brothers and
[21:28] sisters we can't just go along a man
[21:32] with the good feel
[21:33] Oh which Oh with the good idea say kid
[21:38] we have the Holy Ghost amen because the
[21:42] Holy Ghost
[21:43] it's supposed to free do something we're
[21:46] going to get into that a little bit we
[21:49] see back here in Genesis that God is
[21:53] talking about him and his bride here in
[21:55] Ephesians he's talking about a love
[21:58] affair he's saying wives submit
[22:02] yourselves to your husband's in all
[22:05] things to his will a man and husband
[22:11] loves your wives as Christ loved the
[22:16] church that he might sanctify by the
[22:20] cleansing and the washing of the word
[22:23] that he might present it to himself a
[22:25] church without spot or wrinkle listen we
[22:32] look back here in Genesis and we see
[22:35] that that when God created that he crea
[22:41] the spirit say let us create man in our
[22:45] image he created man as a triune being
[22:49] we are flesh spirit and soul okay so he
[22:57] then went on down and he created the
[22:59] flesh of man took from the dust of the
[23:03] earth not in the recent Bible study Jack
[23:05] showed scriptures that that Doug that
[23:07] body is going to go back to the dust now
[23:10] we read the engine that he breathed into
[23:13] Adams nostrils when he believed in the
[23:16] atoms mantras that he became a living
[23:18] soul now we're not talking about just
[23:22] breathing the air he became eternal at
[23:26] that point he became God on the earth
[23:29] the Bible says so at that point he was
[23:34] eternal God owners he breathed into him
[23:39] the breath of life now I want you to
[23:42] understand what things my brothers and
[23:43] sisters
[23:46] I did a little study on looking I said
[23:48] that's blood the blood one thing I found
[23:50] one of the uses and the uses of the
[23:53] blood in our body it's to carry oxygen
[23:56] to our members to our organs that they
[24:01] function the blood carries the life of
[24:06] God but if he no breathe on you
[24:12] there's no life to carry it has to be
[24:17] breathed on you the blood is there
[24:21] waiting for you to excel hey man the
[24:26] breath of God he go on in Genesis day
[24:29] and he said he created took a reel of
[24:34] Adam and he created a woman a man he
[24:40] said you are now flesh of my flesh bone
[24:44] of my bone so what does that mean she
[24:48] now has the same blood coursing through
[24:51] her veins as Adam why because she
[24:57] accepted she came from him they meant so
[25:03] the Spain blood the same breath the same
[25:07] oxygen that was closer to Adam when the
[25:10] Lord Himself breathed into his nostrils
[25:13] was talking through her veins cuz that
[25:17] was her husband Amen now we want to look
[25:23] at something here lord help me
[25:29] in the message blasphemous names a man
[25:38] paragraph 180 folk I'm gonna start at a
[25:45] 185 now it reads now they take the
[25:51] scripture from Bank he's talking about
[25:53] the Jehovah's Witness because the
[25:55] Jehovah's Witness believed that we all
[25:56] breathe the same air I
[26:00] got something for you here now they take
[26:02] the scripture back from that God
[26:04] breathed into his nostrils and they
[26:05] became a living soul now I want to ask
[26:08] you something if it was man what kind of
[26:13] breath did he breathe before God
[26:16] breathed into him breathe his breath of
[26:21] life into him see what kind of breast
[26:24] was it he was a breathing living man
[26:27] well then he then if that be so then
[26:33] every animal is a living soul cause the
[26:38] breath of a human soul or the breath of
[26:43] a human soul or our soul and our and all
[26:47] together there Jesus would have had then
[26:52] Jesus would have had to die wouldn't
[26:54] have had to die the animal sacrifice
[26:57] would have been sufficient so brother
[27:00] the argument don't stand but what God
[27:03] did he breathed the breath of eternal
[27:08] life then he became a living soul
[27:11] so that they sold that can't die
[27:16] now watch now say we're going to get up
[27:19] into the hundred plumb up to our elbows
[27:20] notice the breasts the breed that the
[27:25] breasts the breasts of eternal life into
[27:28] the nostrils and he became a eternal
[27:31] soul because God breathed not what
[27:34] nature done but what God did he breathed
[27:38] eternal he breathed the life into his
[27:40] nostrils and he became a living soul
[27:43] then you say to me Adam died brother but
[27:48] remember before he died he had a lamb
[27:51] that was that redeemed him hallelujah
[27:54] those who he foreknew he called he got a
[27:58] lamb to redeem him then that was a
[28:01] perfect type that was a type Adam fail
[28:05] then when Adam then the lamb was
[28:08] provided for Adam because already
[28:13] his nostrils had become the breath of
[28:16] eternal God and he became a living soul
[28:20] he was a son of God not his breath
[28:24] says as the African word I don't know
[28:28] the Greek word but the African word is
[28:31] called amor which means the wind and an
[28:34] unseen force animals breathe amor you
[28:38] sinners breathe amor you
[28:41] Saints don't breathe amor you a man then
[28:48] why should we struggle for eternal life
[28:51] if that's the eternal soul breath into
[28:55] the breasts why would we struggle for
[28:57] eternal life says that backfires brother
[29:00] see it just can't do it
[29:02] but God especially upon Adam breathed
[29:07] the breath of eternal life and he became
[29:11] eternal person with God had power like
[29:15] God he was an amateur God he was God on
[29:18] earth
[29:19] not God in heaven now God on the earth
[29:22] and someday the sons of God will again
[29:26] become God
[29:28] jesus said so he said it is written in
[29:31] your law that ye are God's then if you
[29:34] can call those who call themselves God
[29:39] amen he says when when I am son of God
[29:44] see now with him is something deep watch
[29:47] this and we going to drive it down now
[29:50] here they are
[29:52] he is now a son of God but he makes a
[29:56] mistake he knows he's done wrong
[30:00] now remember Adam was not deceived the
[30:04] Bible said so in first Timothy not see
[30:07] but the woman was deceived when the
[30:10] transgression Adam with Eve because it
[30:16] was his wife back to Ephesians it was
[30:23] his wife he loved her so much that he
[30:27] was willing to walk out with her to
[30:30] redeem her amen
[30:33] now we recognize that that blood that
[30:37] was shared for us at Calvary God created
[30:42] a blood cell in the Marian that blood
[30:45] cell came up and grew up to Jesus it was
[30:47] his men Redeemer it was God said oh he
[30:52] gonna he call us bride he was there to
[30:56] put to take out a Gentile bride now in
[30:59] order for us to take the blood we have
[31:01] to come through the blood amen
[31:04] so and how is that we going to do that
[31:06] he said there must be a new verse you
[31:09] must be born again
[31:11] you must come through the fight through
[31:13] the water
[31:14] amen verse is missing a birth is message
[31:19] first there's water didn't there's blood
[31:23] then there's life have to come through
[31:28] the blood haiya Pentecost he told him I
[31:33] go to prepare for you he favored work
[31:36] there were I go that she may be also a
[31:38] man he said going to O Jerusalem amen to
[31:44] the upper room and wait there amen and I
[31:48] will sing you amen the Holy Ghost and
[31:52] they was there in the upper room on one
[31:54] Accord and they stayed there for a while
[31:57] the expectation of God was going to do
[32:01] they had no idea all of us certainly
[32:05] said that there came a sound from heaven
[32:07] like him the Russian wing amen and they
[32:11] will all fear what was it the God just
[32:14] breathed on them received baptism of the
[32:18] Holy Ghost amen
[32:20] had a child oh how does it you know a
[32:23] child is alive a child they man they had
[32:25] that child is born they don't live until
[32:30] they take that first breath not until
[32:34] they take that first breath that's why
[32:36] the nurse got to take the baby
[32:38] clean out the airways and everything and
[32:40] probably say they hold him up and give
[32:42] him a little part of hazard stimulation
[32:45] give him a little spanking and that baby
[32:48] beginning to cry once that baby
[32:50] beginning to cry what is he doing he's
[32:52] breathing and Helen me life amen the
[32:55] blood begins to flow a man is ironic
[32:58] back the world symbolizes the heart we
[33:01] love I wonder what they got that from
[33:03] that they symbolizes the heart a man
[33:07] wouldn't love and that love that heart
[33:10] beats and it pumps the blood it sends
[33:14] the blood it comes from a place of love
[33:16] my brothers and sisters the Holy Ghost

[37:59] gone through in this life that has
[38:02] taught us to piece things we don't talk

[39:07] party he says now the word death means
[39:11] separation when we die this way
[39:15] it does not mean our physical death that
[39:19] we are dead jesus said he that believeth
[39:22] on me though he were dead yet shall he
[39:25] live whosoever liveth and believeth on
[39:27] me shall never die now that that
[39:30] speaking of is separation from the
[39:32] presence of God but the physical death
[39:35] that we have to go through here is yet
[39:38] now I'm gonna go down to 51 now from
[39:43] Adam until now man has tried his own
[39:49] substitute he tried his best to do
[39:52] something a little better than what God
[39:55] did and that's the natural man man
[40:00] always trying to better to better
[40:04] something to make it a different way he
[40:07] wants to inject his own ideas into the
[40:10] plan of God and that's why we stand
[40:13] tonight separated as Christian people of
[40:15] the world by barriers of denomination
[40:20] denominational barriers it is not
[40:24] because that it is because it does this
[40:27] because that man has injected his own
[40:30] ideal in the plan of God crowd got 52
[40:34] and Adam Express man in the garden when
[40:39] he made his self a fig leaf apron to
[40:43] face God it's something that he did
[40:45] himself from the fig leaves
[40:49] he tried education towers cities idols
[40:54] civilization denomination but if that it
[40:59] ever remains the same God only accepts
[41:02] his subjects under the blood that's all
[41:08] education has totally failed more
[41:11] education we get the further we get from
[41:13] each other denomination has totally
[41:16] failed we draw lines of barriers and
[41:20] each one trying to get that denomination
[41:22] higher than the other and it breaks
[41:25] fellowship civilization has merely
[41:28] brought about
[41:29] fusion cities towers and whatever more
[41:33] has all failed God planted still remains
[41:36] the same under the blood the blood must
[41:40] be displayed over the doorpost over the
[41:46] doorpost it must be a display blood now
[41:50] how do we display the blood how do we
[41:53] display what we go through birth on the
[41:58] end of that new versus worth life so
[42:02] that display must be the life of God
[42:06] must believe on display that's how you
[42:10] when you got it that you are producing
[42:12] that life listen he will be ready
[42:16] Fijians God took on a wife amen

[43:21] able to read the love letter you must be
[43:23] able to read it through the filter to be
[43:25] able to read between the lines that's
[43:30] the only way you're gonna be able to
[43:32] receive the Holy Ghost that's the only
[43:35] way you're gonna be able to get the
[43:38] message from him amen now the prophets

[46:16] ain't even tried to find it
[46:19] ma no you don't have the ring or did you
[46:23] ain't even trying to find it
[46:26] Turks we got to shake ourselves we God
[46:30] came here with two ministers it's a
[46:33] warning my brothers and sisters my wife
[46:37] can attest this message had been on my
[46:39] heart
[46:39] months ago and he just been giving their
[46:43] little things give me little things now
[46:45] we still in part in that we're gonna now
[46:49] add them until now let me see here I'm
[46:54] sorry
[47:01] hey man you love the Lord hey man he
[47:10] says I'm gonna paragraph 55 says we
[47:14] believe every word that Jehovah says but
[47:17] that didn't expel it you might have come
[47:22] ago back they might have confessed that
[47:24] we believe every word that Jehovah says
[47:27] but that didn't expel it they had to
[47:31] display the token the blood must be
[47:34] shown that's the way it is tonight I
[47:37] believe that every Christian has to
[47:40] display the blood of Jesus Christ that
[47:43] cleanse them from all the things of the
[47:46] world now it's time now in that time the
[47:52] token must be on the door it must be
[47:56] there regardless of how religious how
[48:00] religious the house was how religious
[48:02] the people how well they had brought up
[48:05] their children how fine they had
[48:07] attended church how well they had
[48:10] displayed all the things of God he said
[48:14] it still at that last hour where it
[48:18] showed between death and life the blood
[48:21] had to be displayed the blood showed
[48:24] that an innocent substitute had been
[48:27] taken in place of the worshiper he says
[48:30] now the chemistry of the blood the red
[48:32] blood cell the red blood itself was a
[48:35] sign on the door that the house was safe
[48:38] under the blood now that was a title now
[48:42] in the last days we are coming back
[48:45] again to the hour where we believe we're
[48:49] delivering his church I believe I
[48:53] believe as and as certain as the blood
[48:57] has to stand for a memorial so does the
[49:01] token have to be it's required today for
[49:05] now they could not take the chemistry of
[49:07] the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[49:09] place it upon their hearts door but you
[49:13] see that
[49:14] time an animal died which was a lamb and
[49:17] it showed that the animal was dead the
[49:20] blood was on the door so the life that
[49:24] was in the animal could not come upon
[49:26] the worshipper but the animal doesn't
[49:28] have a soul so that was in the animal
[49:32] could not come upon the worshipper but
[49:34] today when the blood of God his own son
[49:37] was shed at Calvary for the pardoning
[49:40] and release the life that was in the
[49:44] blood was God himself and the Holy
[49:49] Spirit returns upon the church upon his
[49:52] believer and it's a token in these last
[49:55] days that he will pass over the man or
[49:59] the wormans that accepted the death of
[50:02] theirs for a substitute a man a man a
[50:13] man the message miracles sister a man
[50:18] now the Prophet was talking about that
[50:21] Jonah in the belly of the whale I'm
[50:23] sorry you got it a man 188 just above it
[50:31] a man now Jonah in the belly of the were
[50:37] acted first upon the word and God know
[50:40] that he was gone from the physical hands
[50:43] that he was gone as far as physical his
[50:47] hands were bound his feet was vital that
[50:50] preacher to the Gentiles was thrown out
[50:53] of the ship into the whale's belly and
[50:55] down to the bottom of the sea amen we're
[51:00] gonna go down there to 189 I don't want
[51:04] to do too much read my wife Jeremy don't
[51:06] do too much read amen the storm we're
[51:10] gonna start here all hope was gone when
[51:13] he was in the ship now he was in the
[51:15] whales belly farther away farther away
[51:19] from the hope than ever when only he if
[51:22] only he he could see the belly of the
[51:26] whale he said
[51:27] there are lying vanities I won't believe
[51:30] them anymore but look towards your holy
[51:35] temple the holy temple wasn't looking
[51:38] down he said it's up there so I'm
[51:42] looking towards it and when he seen
[51:46] God's miracle somehow oxygen came into
[51:52] the whale and he just breathed normally
[51:57] for three days and took a nice little
[52:01] rest and Rob take these for today
[52:06] journey across a wicked City bound and
[52:08] preached the gospel God all freshened up
[52:12] a man with some new oxygen out of heaven
[52:16] mine some new oxygen out of heaven it
[52:20] couldn't come out of the will and it
[52:23] couldn't come out of the sea so it had
[52:25] to come from God
[52:27] Oh breathed on us tonight Lord let the
[52:31] oxygen of the Word of God and the power
[52:33] of his resurrection that we can stay
[52:36] alive in these last and wicked days
[52:39] breathe upon us O Holy Spirit this is it
[52:44] brother breathe Lord fill us with the
[52:47] oxygen like I told you this morning
[52:49] about that duck I don't want to read I
[52:51] don't want to get into that but let him
[52:53] talking about the oxygen breeze on us
[52:56] Lord that ought to be your prayer that
[52:59] ought to be your desire for the Holy
[53:01] Spirit for God to breathe on you the
[53:05] breath into your nostrils and you become
[53:09] a living soul what is it you must first
[53:13] die this flesh must die
[53:16] we must yield ourselves and surrender
[53:19] ourselves to God's will amen and he
[53:22] promised us that we baptized heat he
[53:26] will give us the whole ago we just not
[53:28] asking for it
[53:29] we just not sincere he said if you be
[53:31] sincere he'll hold nothing from you know
[53:35] the problem that out that but then it's
[53:38] in here and I don't want to do a whole
[53:39] lot of reen and everything
[53:41] the prophet of God say we get ritualized
[53:45] we begin after a while we come to church
[53:48] it's just a ritual it's just something
[53:51] to do it becomes a form of godliness but
[53:54] denying the power we have to come in my
[53:58] brother under expectation we have to
[54:02] come in really seeking something from
[54:04] God if there's something in your life
[54:06] and you know you know but the brother
[54:08] said is you know whether you got the
[54:11] Holy Ghost or not he said you know where
[54:15] that you got the Holy Ghost in life but

[1:06:46] is so important
[1:06:47] and it's so sacred because it is the
[1:06:52] very thought in the heart of God a man
[1:06:57] when he created Adam he said it's not
[1:07:00] good for man to dwell alone a man
[1:07:03] because he was Elohim and he know what
[1:07:05] it was like to be alone
[1:07:07] not that he was lonely because he had
[1:07:10] his thoughts he's God he's not lonely a
[1:07:13] man but he said it's not good for a man
[1:07:15] to dwell alone
[1:07:16] he wanted a bride he wanted a wife a man
[1:07:21] and he come to this Gentile through the
[1:07:24] Old Testament down to this New Testament
[1:07:27] hid it and he died on the cross for a
[1:07:31] Gentile bride for a Gentile bride and we
[1:07:36] must be cleansed we must go through the
[1:07:38] blood we must be we have to be born
[1:07:43] again
[1:07:43] I surrender also a man you love the Lord
[1:07:47] Amen so let us not come ritualistic let
[1:07:52] us not take these opportunities a man

[1:19:26] God we need it Lord daily we need him
[1:19:28] God don't let us miss with what the
[1:19:31] voice of God is speaking in this hour

[1:19:49] what produces Emma so God let it flow
[1:19:51] through every every vein let it flow
[1:19:54] through our being or God father that's
[1:19:56] that's what we desire that's what we

[1:20:02] pray amen come on give the Lord a hand
[1:20:05] of praise tonight
[1:20:08] blessed be the name of the Lord blessed
[1:20:12] be the name of the Lord man you can be
[1:20:15] seated in his presence
[1:20:17] you may certainly thank the Lord for
[1:20:22] thought tonight on the power of the
[1:20:24] blood and just kind of reminded of the
[1:20:29] story that the Prophet told of them
[1:20:31] there was a man one time that was filled
[1:20:35] with the Holy Ghost and his friends
[1:20:38] noticed a difference in him they noticed
[1:20:41] a tremendous difference cinnamon one of
[1:20:44] his friends said you know I want that
[1:20:46] what you got and and he and you know I
[1:20:50] said well you know I'm I want you to
[1:20:52] come pray with me and they went to a
[1:20:54] particular and they told them say well
[1:20:56] you're not got like this you're not
[1:20:58] gonna get it like this and they said
[1:21:01] well what you mean I'm not gonna get it
[1:21:03] like that so you know you you know you
[1:21:04] it's gonna take a little bit Matt so
[1:21:07] they went to another little area and and
[1:21:10] he said no you're not gonna get it here
[1:21:12] either say no no you're not gonna get it
[1:21:14] here either he said well what you mean
[1:21:16] we'll take me where I'm gonna get it so
[1:21:17] it took him I'm actually cutting in and
[1:21:19] out here
[1:21:20] he says I'm he says come follow me and
[1:21:23] they took him a man to a pigpen when I
[1:21:27] got to the Pigpen all the muck and
[1:21:30] everything around and he said now follow
[1:21:32] me out here and they say well I got to
[1:21:34] go out there and I got to do that he's
[1:21:35] like he's like yeah come on to see this
[1:21:37] with you and get it at right out here
[1:21:39] Annie and he went out a man into the
[1:21:42] Pigpen and God Philip filled with the
[1:21:43] Holy Ghost but God had to get him out of
[1:21:45] his comfort his places of comfort right
[1:21:48] and you know and the things that he
[1:21:50] thought would produce it you know
[1:21:52] because oftentimes we have our own
[1:21:54] imagination a man as to as to what the
[1:21:57] Holy Ghost is all about but you know as
[1:21:59] God got God knows what he wants from us
[1:22:01] in
[1:22:02] each one of us know a man whether it's
[1:22:04] something that we've really really
[1:22:05] struck that spot with God and I'll tell
[1:22:07] you what a man let's not come to church
[1:22:09] I agree a man let's not come to church
[1:22:11] and just make a tradition a man let's
[1:22:14] make this a place where we can receive a
[1:22:16] man from God need the Spirit of God
[1:22:18] every time we come amen we need the
[1:22:21] Spirit of God and don't be ashamed if
[1:22:23] this altars always open for anybody that
[1:22:26] wants to come a man I remember the
[1:22:29] brother that one time he was in the
[1:22:32] prophets meetings and whatnot the
[1:22:34] prophets meet prophet told a story about
[1:22:36] him
[1:22:37] but he was was in a situation where a
[1:22:40] storm at bluing over blown over is the
[1:22:42] hurricane or something like that and
[1:22:43] blew blow over that blew over the camp
[1:22:45] and he was in there praying there was an
[1:22:47] old lady there she was she was praying
[1:22:49] and she was all comfortable saying well
[1:22:50] if I if the storm take me away I'm
[1:22:53] settled I'm set up my heart is settled
[1:22:55] with God and I know everything gonna be
[1:22:56] alright so the young man went into her
[1:22:58] little area into her tent there and or
[1:23:01] the cabin that she had and and he prayed
[1:23:04] a little bit and she he saw the calmness
[1:23:06] over he said to himself I say you know
[1:23:07] what I need that same type of calmness
[1:23:09] and he he after he come through the
[1:23:13] storm the first thing he did was go to
[1:23:15] the church and before the preacher could
[1:23:18] even come up to preach that young man
[1:23:20] was on the altar crying out to God right
[1:23:22] that man meant business with God right
[1:23:24] he meant business with God and and I
[1:23:26] think sometimes we got it we got to show
[1:23:28] God that we mean business with them
[1:23:30] right Amen let's let's break out of our
[1:23:32] comfort zone let's do whatever it take
[1:23:34] to make sure that's fine
[1:23:36] what God is requiring of us a man
[1:23:40] wouldn't it be a shame to sit here and
[1:23:42] have all this word but be missing the
[1:23:45] main thing and that's to be filled with
[1:23:47] the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen I
[1:23:49] don't want that to be our testimony
[1:23:51] church amen I don't want it to be my
[1:23:53] testimony Amen I'll take this a man to
[1:23:58] heart tonight and we will begin to do
[1:24:00] things if we know if we don't have it
[1:24:02] let's press in until we get it amen

[1:31:36] heard brother Nathan that give me a call
[1:31:39] on yesterday and he was telling me just
[1:31:44] about something that happened in their
[1:31:46] church here recently they were there's a
[1:31:49] brother that's been visiting a church
[1:31:51] from one of the countries in Africa and
[1:31:54] he speaks primarily French and doesn't
[1:31:59] really knows very very little English
[1:32:01] you know but it does speak just a little
[1:32:03] bit and he's been coming to church and
[1:32:06] he's like lord I just can't understand
[1:32:07] anything that they're saying you know I
[1:32:10] mean they just it's just not my first
[1:32:12] language so I just I'm catching very
[1:32:14] little so he prayed a prayer on Sunday
[1:32:17] morning said Lord let me hear what the
[1:32:19] preachers saying please God let me hear
[1:32:21] what the preachers saying and and they
[1:32:24] said they you know was going through the
[1:32:25] preliminaries a song service that man
[1:32:27] can hear anything him and I think
[1:32:29] brother Nathan happen to call his name
[1:32:31] during one an announcement and he heard
[1:32:33] that and that was not only heard and
[1:32:34] then brother Nathan picked up you know
[1:32:37] to read his Bible and just begin to you
[1:32:40] know go into the sermon and that when he
[1:32:42] picked up the man say he felt somebody
[1:32:43] touch him on his back
[1:32:45] and he was getting ready to turn around
[1:32:46] and see who it was it touched when he
[1:32:48] heard a voice say no don't don't turn
[1:32:49] around just just keep your eyes focused
[1:32:51] keep looking forward and and as he kept
[1:32:56] his eyes looking forward brother Nathan
[1:32:57] started his sermon the man stood up and
[1:33:01] and he was you know listing and and so
[1:33:05] he stood up and brother Nathan like why
[1:33:07] he was say a man sometimes and it's like
[1:33:10] well the guy could barely understand why
[1:33:11] they're saying a man is saying he won't
[1:33:13] sit down he just stated his State
[1:33:14] standing the entire service they say
[1:33:16] won't sit down said he didn't do this
[1:33:18] the other night why are you doing this
[1:33:19] now I said this is kind of strange so at
[1:33:21] the end of the sermon the man went up
[1:33:23] you say you know
[1:33:25] a miracle happiness image this if this
[1:33:27] miracle happened in here underneath this
[1:33:29] ministry I want this man just to pray
[1:33:31] for me just just just because I think he
[1:33:33] need to pray and I'm you know brother
[1:33:35] Nathan pray for me went back to the
[1:33:36] scene after services to brother Nathan
[1:33:38] said something touched me and told me to
[1:33:41] keep looking forward and say when it did
[1:33:42] that it something's like something was
[1:33:46] interpreting every word that you said
[1:33:48] why you were preaching
[1:33:50] I can't hear every word that's why I
[1:33:52] stood to my feet because I heard
[1:33:54] everything you sent and and after they
[1:33:58] you know after the sermon was done he
[1:34:01] couldn't hear anymore
[1:34:01] but his prayer was Lord let me hear what
[1:34:04] the preachers saying right and God
[1:34:06] blessed him and he heard exactly what
[1:34:08] the preacher was saying and that is what
[1:34:10] happened in the book of Acts right that
[1:34:12] is what happened that's what we were
[1:34:14] talking about in our Sunday School on on
[1:34:16] on Sunday and you know so to see God
[1:34:19] doing things like that today he is the
[1:34:22] same yesterday today and forever and
[1:34:24] Church we ought to expect these type of
[1:34:26] things when we come together amen let's
[1:34:29] not limit God let's put let's let's
[1:34:31] create environment so he can move in
[1:34:33] this place amen and do what he does best
[1:34:36] amen god bless you let's have a word of
[1:34:38] Prayer and we'll prepare to dismiss you
[1:34:40] tonight father we thank you for this
[1:34:41] opportunity we've had to come into
[1:34:42] fellowship at your feet
[1:34:43] pray to to it bless us now as we leave
[1:34:45] this place but not your presence may we
[1:34:47] go meditate them thinking on the things
[1:34:49] that we've heard here tonight and God
[1:34:51] breathe on us breathe on us God just
[1:34:54] like you breathe on you breathe into
[1:34:56] Adam the breath of life Lord also when
[1:35:00] when Jesus was on earth he pulled the
[1:35:02] disciples to decide me breathed on them
[1:35:04] Lord and said receive ye the Holy Ghost
[1:35:06] got tonight breathe on us that we might
[1:35:09] receive a man a feeling and a refilling
[1:35:12] we need the that oxygen from heaven got
[1:35:16] to come upon us Lord let us go with a
[1:35:18] heart of desperation and and God we
[1:35:21] don't limit you to where you can move we
[1:35:23] know you can move wherever so God even
[1:35:24] as we're going home maybe we meditate
[1:35:26] maybe we think on these things and and
[1:35:28] God even as we're going through the day
[1:35:30] tomorrow and on Friday Lord maybe we
[1:35:31] continue to think on these things until
[1:35:33] we come to the spot look where we feel
[1:35:35] like buddy Ryan who went to the corn fee
[1:35:39] and said God unless you fill me with the
[1:35:41] Holy Ghost you're gonna find a pile of
[1:35:43] dead bones in this field the man got
[1:35:45] desperate and when we get desperate
[1:35:47] we'll see you God will meet you Lord we
[1:35:50] gotta be desperate or will perish so
