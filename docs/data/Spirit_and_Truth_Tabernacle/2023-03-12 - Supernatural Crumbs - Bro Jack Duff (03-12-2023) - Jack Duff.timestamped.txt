[51:16] to reflect back on that service that we
[51:20] had when this was was given
[51:23] and uh just a number of things that had
[51:25] happened in that service
[51:28] um I remember

[51:33] thing for brother Nehemiah
[51:34] on that day and and I was going to tell
[51:38] your brother Nehemiah the um we have a
[51:41] chair in storage that remembers that day
[51:45] amen the tap the chair testifiers
[51:48] as to what God did on that day and
[51:52] um uh we were just there having service
[51:54] and the lord gave us this word through
[51:57] our sister Rebecca while she was on the
[51:59] on the piano
[52:01] and um just spoke out nobody was
[52:04] expecting it but God spoke to us and
[52:06] says have not I spoken these words to
[52:09] you
[52:10] I am doing a new thing
[52:13] I am doing a new thing my bride
[52:16] just wait on me and and I will do what
[52:21] you have asked me to do
[52:24] uh you don't have to worry
[52:26] for I am he I am here I am he who speaks
[52:32] to you uh right now uh you just say what
[52:37] you need and I will give it to you
[52:40] open your mouth wide and I will feel it
[52:44] that's what I have promised that's what
[52:48] I will give to you open your mouth wide
[52:53] open it wider and wider and wider and I
[52:59] will give it unto you my bride amen just
[53:02] reminded of what the Lord said to us and
[53:06] and we are uh under expectation for him
[53:10] to do exactly what he says
[53:12] amen he's an on-time God
[53:17] it may not come
[53:19] when you want them
[53:21] but he'll be there
[53:24] right on time
[53:26] cause he's an on-time guard
[53:30] yes he is
[53:33] turn with me to Hebrews 11.
[53:38] amen verse 6.
[53:45] I like seeing these young people up
[53:47] front like this uh thank you to our
[53:51] Deacon amen but this is this this
[53:53] reminds me the old time uh how we used
[53:56] to kind of be on that front row now we
[53:58] up here but one day we're gonna be
[54:01] sitting down and let the young people
[54:02] take it and speaking of that the young
[54:04] people did a wonderful service on Friday
[54:06] night we had a wonderful time
[54:09] amen a Special Assistant Abby wrote a
[54:13] song Amen and and sang it for us and you
[54:17] know out of Psalm 37 I believe it was
[54:19] and enjoyed that sister uh Shalom song
[54:24] of song for us and we enjoyed that and
[54:26] then brother Quentin amen spoke to us
[54:29] and Mai did an excellent job man you
[54:33] better watch what you eat
[54:35] yeah
[54:36] he just really really blessed our hearts
[54:39] with with the thought that the lord gave
[54:41] on me man but I was just happy uh uh
[54:44] that we all came and just was was was
[54:46] was just enjoying the presence of the
[54:48] Lord amen on on Friday night so praise
[54:51] Lord I want to encourage us when we when
[54:53] we have the youth services if if even
[54:55] the parents say man and some of the
[54:57] other Saints you might think well that's
[54:58] just for the young people no it's for
[55:00] all of us but what we want to do is
[55:02] encourage our young people I even told
[55:04] uh sister Shalom said we have these
[55:06] Services I want you to be start playing
[55:08] the piano for the for the Youth service
[55:10] right and I might I might I might
[55:13] surprise y'all with a new song leader
[55:15] too for the Youth service
[55:18] amen but I'm getting the I'ma raise
[55:21] these young people up
[55:23] I'ma pull them up praise God uh but I
[55:27] believe God got gifts here in our nips
[55:29] and and we're gonna we're gonna we just
[55:30] gone we're gonna we're gonna make sure
[55:32] that they're nourished in the right
[55:33] environment and uh that God can get the
[55:36] best out of them praise the Lord we're
[55:38] not waiting for God to send no more
[55:40] young people we got enough right here to
[55:42] get started with and all we got to do is
[55:44] just be faithful what we got
[55:46] amen you build it they'll come
[55:51] all right
[55:53] Hebrews 11 and 6 it says
[55:57] but without faith it is impossible
[56:01] to please him
[56:04] for he that cometh to God must believe
[56:07] that he is and that he is a rewarder of
[56:11] them that diligently seek him uh also uh
[56:16] just want to go back to a verse over
[56:18] here in First Kings
[56:20] we touched on this uh last time we were
[56:25] speaking on a risk and reward
[56:28] and I use this particular story there in
[56:33] scripture and we'll just touch just a
[56:35] little bit of it uh today but but we
[56:38] want to kind of move into a different
[56:39] direction but here in First Kings 17
[56:43] verse 14 it says for thus saith the Lord
[56:46] God of Israel
[56:48] the barrel of meals shall not waste
[56:52] neither show the crews of oil fail
[56:55] until the day that the Lord senteth ring
[56:58] upon the Earth let's pray father we come
[57:02] in the precious and awesome name of the
[57:06] Lord Jesus Christ uh we thank you for
[57:09] what has happened thus far in the
[57:11] service uh just appreciate Lord the the
[57:15] the worship the time of worship the the
[57:18] song leading the musicians the specials
[57:21] Lord as they went forth and uh God just
[57:25] feeling the anointing just moving in
[57:27] this place and other people as they
[57:29] entered into the worship now God we come
[57:32] to the most important part of the
[57:33] service and that is the word of God
[57:37] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[57:41] every word that proceeds out of the
[57:44] mouth of God so Lord speak to us this
[57:48] morning through your word and may we
[57:50] leave strengthened father by the things
[57:52] that we hear and may the Holy Ghost take
[57:54] control over everything felt not just
[57:56] mad thoughts but the thoughts of the
[57:58] people don't let the devil steal their
[58:01] blessing
[58:02] God you got something for all of us so
[58:04] God so help us to focus our attention on
[58:07] what you want to speak to us today and

[58:30] presence of the Lord
[58:33] um we we want to take a topic amen today

[58:41] amen Supernatural crumbs praise the Lord
[58:46] uh just bear with me as we would just
[58:49] um get through this today
[58:52] I want to go back to a statement that
[58:57] was made by God's Prophet uh we we had
[59:01] our our tape service at home couple
[59:04] weeks ago first first Friday of the
[59:06] month we always do uh our tape service
[59:09] and um and you know I sometimes I'm
[59:14] planning those tapes out either a month
[59:16] even sometimes you know a year in
[59:18] advance and I just I kind of you know as
[59:20] the Lord would lead me I just put okay
[59:22] let's re let's listen to this one let's
[59:23] listen to that one and um and I may not
[59:26] remember what tape I actually uh put
[59:29] there until it shows up on the calendar
[59:31] that okay that's the tape that we're
[59:33] gonna listen to and as we were uh
[59:35] preparing to listen to that tape I was I
[59:38] was like Lord I need you to speak to me
[59:40] uh because of you know just this season
[59:42] of life that I'm in I I need a word from
[59:45] the Lord amen I always need a word from
[59:48] the Lord every day I wake up I need a
[59:51] word from the Lord hey amen when I come
[59:53] to church I still need a word from the
[59:55] Lord so anybody standing here preaching
[59:56] I'm looking to see what is God trying to
[59:58] say to me come on church amen amen I
[1:00:03] come I always come needy glory to God
[1:00:06] Amen I come needy this morning
[1:00:09] Hallelujah so so I was just I was just
[1:00:11] there and just just uh like Lord I need
[1:00:14] you to speak to me and brother Brandon
[1:00:16] made a statement in in that sermon the
[1:00:18] unchangeable god
[1:00:20] amen the unchangeable God and and he
[1:00:23] makes the statement he says now the
[1:00:26] thing is with the people is the way God
[1:00:30] Appears he says many times we want to
[1:00:34] make an idol out of God
[1:00:37] that's all right we ask God to do
[1:00:41] something and then he must do it
[1:00:45] just of the way that we ask it or we'll
[1:00:50] say he never answered
[1:00:52] now now we gotta stop right there right
[1:00:54] because because you know we we have
[1:00:57] requests that we've put out before the
[1:00:58] Lord amen and and here's the thing once
[1:01:02] you put a request out before God you
[1:01:05] have to release it in God's hands that
[1:01:07] he can answer it however he wants to
[1:01:12] look you you you can't pray and ask God
[1:01:14] to do it and then tell God what to do
[1:01:18] hello somebody amen if that was the case
[1:01:22] you might as well do it yourself but
[1:01:24] since we need God to do it we might as
[1:01:27] well allow him to be God and to do it in
[1:01:30] whatever way he desires so whatever your
[1:01:33] need is this morning just let God be God
[1:01:37] amen We're not gonna make an idol out of
[1:01:40] them
[1:01:40] amen amen we're gonna we're gonna free
[1:01:43] them up to do whatever he desire to do
[1:01:45] oh my you know I I um I I I I'll I'll
[1:01:49] I'll I'll I'll be the first to admit
[1:01:51] that I try I made an idol out of God
[1:01:54] I made a night out of God seven years
[1:01:56] ago I made an idol out of God I'll be
[1:01:58] the first to admit it and and what what
[1:02:00] happened was that I told the Lord I say
[1:02:02] Lord
[1:02:04] um you know uh I need to I need to I
[1:02:07] need you to pay off my house
[1:02:09] so I can go full time in Ministry
[1:02:12] that's what I told the Lord I need you
[1:02:13] to pay off my house I want to get out of
[1:02:15] the dead of my house so I can go full
[1:02:17] time and minutes and I gave God a reason
[1:02:18] why I needed him to pay off my house
[1:02:21] and then what God did is say no I'm
[1:02:23] gonna have you go full time in Ministry
[1:02:25] and I'ma still have you making payments
[1:02:27] on your house
[1:02:28] and for seven years God has been making
[1:02:31] payments on my house and see I thought I
[1:02:33] was smarter than God right but God God
[1:02:35] had to share show me say no I can show
[1:02:38] you that I can make a way I can I can
[1:02:40] provide your needs you don't need it
[1:02:41] paid off
[1:02:42] Hallelujah you just need to know how to
[1:02:45] manage your money
[1:02:48] right and say no you so you're not no
[1:02:51] easy way out here but I want you to know
[1:02:53] that you can trust me with anything
[1:02:56] now I still believe you're gonna pay off
[1:02:58] my house after I make some payments but
[1:03:01] he's just training me in that and see
[1:03:03] what I had to learn I can't make an idol
[1:03:05] out of God and and and have him do it a
[1:03:07] certain way no no God you you just do
[1:03:10] whatever you want to do
[1:03:12] my my I Feel Jesus in the house
[1:03:16] but here the prophet tells us to say we
[1:03:18] ask God to do something and then he must
[1:03:20] do it just the way we ask it or we'll
[1:03:23] say he never answered when we do that we
[1:03:26] weaken our faith in God and when we
[1:03:29] weaken Our Testimony when we do that uh
[1:03:32] when we do not take him at his word God
[1:03:35] always answers no one never asked Jesus
[1:03:39] said ass and you shall receive seek and
[1:03:43] you shall find everyone that asks will
[1:03:45] receive everyone that seeks shall find
[1:03:48] everyone that knocks it'll be open to
[1:03:50] them now that's the only way that I've
[1:03:52] always found it uh that I can get
[1:03:54] anything from God is to take him at his
[1:03:57] word and believe it the way he sends it
[1:03:59] now if we do not take it just the way we
[1:04:02] think it is we build God as an idol
[1:04:06] he's got to answer just according to our
[1:04:09] ways or that's just no good he didn't
[1:04:12] answers God answers in many ways answers
[1:04:15] in Peculiar ways times and everything is
[1:04:19] odd so you don't know how God gonna do
[1:04:21] things but you just receive it as it
[1:04:23] comes oh God got purpose for our being
[1:04:26] here today
[1:04:28] all right I want to go forward I got a
[1:04:30] few more things I want to lay down here
[1:04:32] amen uh just in our foundation this is
[1:04:35] coming out of the sermon a statue of a
[1:04:37] perfect man and we're talking about this
[1:04:39] Faith
[1:04:40] um this this this this this morning just
[1:04:43] uh something to encourage our our hearts
[1:04:45] we read there in the scripture without
[1:04:47] faith amen it's impossible to please him
[1:04:50] for he that cometh to God must believe
[1:04:52] that he is and that he is a rewarded
[1:04:54] them that diligently seek Him amen God
[1:04:57] is a rewarder of them that diligently
[1:04:59] seek Him Hallelujah you got to keep
[1:05:01] seeking amen don't give up on seeking
[1:05:05] hallelujah hallelujah hearing this
[1:05:07] message statue of a perfect man says
[1:05:09] notice you must be born again it says
[1:05:12] and when you're born again you can't be
[1:05:14] born again without having faith right
[1:05:17] that's right so you see on my chart here
[1:05:20] I got the very Foundation faith is the
[1:05:22] foundation of all of it for without
[1:05:25] faith it is impossible to please God he
[1:05:29] that cometh to God must believe that he
[1:05:31] is and a reward of those that diligently
[1:05:34] seek him a man says uh when you are
[1:05:37] skeptic of the Bible when you're a
[1:05:40] skeptic of the word being right you just
[1:05:43] might as well stay back until first you
[1:05:45] believe him what is sin unbelief there
[1:05:49] are only two elements that controls the
[1:05:51] human being that's either doubt or faith
[1:05:54] one or the other you are possessed of
[1:05:57] one that dominates your life just
[1:05:59] depends on how much Faith you have
[1:06:02] how high you can rise but right but
[1:06:05] first it's got to be Faith let me stay
[1:06:08] on the foundation for a while it depends
[1:06:10] on how much Faith you have as to how
[1:06:12] high you can rise
[1:06:14] praise the Lord now we're gonna we're
[1:06:16] gonna make another another comment here
[1:06:18] on this amen because you can have faith
[1:06:21] a man sometimes and and don't even
[1:06:24] realize that you have it but I think
[1:06:26] sometimes there's circumstances and
[1:06:27] situations that pull it out of you
[1:06:30] glory to God Amen we'll talk about that
[1:06:34] a little bit later but amen here you
[1:06:36] know here's another thing about about
[1:06:38] faith hallelujah hallelujah let's go to
[1:06:41] this this sermon as the eagle stirth up
[1:06:43] her nest amen look at what he says here
[1:06:46] Glory says just remember now as I go on
[1:06:51] record in these tapes I say this with
[1:06:53] all my heart that if any persons will
[1:06:58] take the right mental attitude towards
[1:07:01] any Divine promise that God has made now
[1:07:04] now I wanna I wanna I wanna also inject
[1:07:07] because as we were listening to that
[1:07:08] sermon the unchangeable god brother
[1:07:10] Brandon made a statement in there he
[1:07:12] says that when you look at scripture
[1:07:15] hallelujah amen and you can look at
[1:07:18] something and you can see that God might
[1:07:20] have written this to the children of
[1:07:22] Israel or God might have written this to
[1:07:24] this person a god might have said this
[1:07:25] to that person but he says but if you
[1:07:28] can take it personally as God God was
[1:07:31] writing it to you then you'll see God
[1:07:33] manifest that same thing in your life
[1:07:36] hallelujah amen I took it personal when
[1:07:38] I read the script in Jeremiah amen I
[1:07:41] believe was chapter 32 and God said that
[1:07:44] he was going to Rejoice over me to do me
[1:07:48] good and he was going to plant me in
[1:07:50] Atlanta sure I say that's not just for
[1:07:52] Israel and they're promising that is
[1:07:55] from me and I'm receiving that as my own
[1:07:58] personal promise and if I have the right
[1:08:01] mental attitude I'm gonna watch that
[1:08:04] thing come to pass
[1:08:06] claim every promise is yours as God was
[1:08:09] writing it specifically to you
[1:08:12] he says just remember now as I go and
[1:08:14] record these things I say this to all my
[1:08:16] heart that if any person will take the
[1:08:19] right mental attitude towards any Divine
[1:08:21] promise that God has made it'll bring it
[1:08:24] to pass if you could take the right
[1:08:27] attitude towards what he said it will
[1:08:30] bring it to pass I've seen a sarcomas
[1:08:34] cancer lead people by that same thing
[1:08:36] now maybe you won't be able to receive
[1:08:40] just receive enough just to deliver you
[1:08:43] all of a sudden see that means your
[1:08:45] faith might not rise to a level where
[1:08:47] you can just get a Deliverance just like
[1:08:48] that Hallelujah watch he says but I
[1:08:51] might say uh tonight just because I want
[1:08:53] to talk to you a moment and say this if
[1:08:56] you can't receive enough Faith to be
[1:08:58] healed instantly
[1:09:00] then you take the adopted baby routes
[1:09:05] hello somebody if you if you don't have
[1:09:08] enough Faith to believe that he's a
[1:09:11] reward of those that diligently seek him
[1:09:13] you don't have enough Faith to believe
[1:09:15] that God can do it right now then take
[1:09:19] the adopted baby route
[1:09:23] hello somebody he said did you ever hear
[1:09:28] of adopting a baby he says now if you
[1:09:31] take a young woman

[1:09:48] don't you ain't got to listen to what a
[1:09:49] doctor said God is able to change things

[1:10:44] it keep speaking God's promises over you
[1:10:47] no matter don't don't look at

[1:11:51] amen you you got they say you got more
[1:11:53] need than you got money

[1:12:03] that power for your sake do you stand on
[1:12:06] the word of God and watch God fulfill
[1:12:08] his word
[1:12:11] [Applause]
[1:12:13] oh I I'm telling you I tell you I tell
[1:12:16] you Hallelujah we got we talk about a
[1:12:19] God that that's a supernatural he can
[1:12:21] take crumbs you ain't got nothing
[1:12:23] crumbs God can do something with crumbs
[1:12:27] I want to tell you that the god that we
[1:12:29] serve he can do more with crumbs and you
[1:12:31] can do it a million dollars
[1:12:36] crumbs you down to your last when you're
[1:12:40] reaching your pocket you feel lit
[1:12:46] but God can do something with that with
[1:12:48] it with the lint
[1:12:50] Jesus
[1:12:52] hallelujah hallelujah we serve a mighty
[1:12:55] God
[1:12:56] amen amen so here he says she won't if
[1:13:00] she if she's if she has uh uh uh if
[1:13:03] she's scared that she's not gonna have
[1:13:04] it then she won't
[1:13:06] it says um and and she's so scared she
[1:13:09] won't have it she won't because just
[1:13:11] like job said the things that I feared
[1:13:13] the most come upon me
[1:13:16] but you take that same woman now if
[1:13:19] there's doctors which they're probably
[1:13:21] sitting by nurses you take that same
[1:13:23] woman and let her adopt a baby
[1:13:27] then she will have one herself
[1:13:33] now you know and this we got to be
[1:13:35] careful with this right because what
[1:13:37] what you know what brother random was
[1:13:39] was kind of was and I know there was a
[1:13:41] family that I just met uh out in out in
[1:13:45] Arizona they uh they couldn't have kids
[1:13:48] and they adopted this one one young man
[1:13:49] and next thing you know they had nine
[1:13:54] you know
[1:13:56] and and and here's the thing I want you
[1:13:59] to be careful I'll share this quote but
[1:14:01] you know
[1:14:02] um oftentimes we will hear somebody else
[1:14:05] testimony and then we'll try to make it
[1:14:08] ours
[1:14:10] right no that's what God did for them
[1:14:12] now now here's the thing the same God
[1:14:15] that moved for them he will move for you
[1:14:19] right but don't try to steal their
[1:14:21] testimony let God give you on your own
[1:14:24] personal testimony
[1:14:26] Hallelujah I was I was reading and God
[1:14:29] God put this in my spirit or I was
[1:14:31] listening to this sermon and God put
[1:14:33] that let God give you a personal
[1:14:34] testimony you step out with that
[1:14:37] it's something about when they become
[1:14:38] your own personal property
[1:14:40] here he says it says now if the doctors
[1:14:43] would say probably uh is sitting here is
[1:14:45] sitting by nurses you take that same
[1:14:47] woman let her adopt the baby then she
[1:14:50] will have one herself see it quietens
[1:14:52] her
[1:14:54] right the baby just having a baby in the
[1:14:56] home it quiet it get her nerves down
[1:14:59] hallelu nah she's in position her body's
[1:15:02] in position to be able to receive
[1:15:04] glory to God Amen she was too worked up
[1:15:07] before it said but when the adopt the
[1:15:10] baby you just bring the baby into the
[1:15:11] environment it does something for you
[1:15:13] Hallelujah so now if you haven't got
[1:15:16] enough Faith to receive it right now as
[1:15:18] a miracle then take the adopted baby
[1:15:21] attitude
[1:15:23] lord it's mine because you promised him
[1:15:26] I will go from here tonight praising you
[1:15:29] just the same as as I was well right
[1:15:34] Watch What Happens you receive it it has
[1:15:37] to happen God promised it so he's the
[1:15:40] infinite God and if you can feel if you
[1:15:43] can feel just a little speck of faith
[1:15:45] that tells you that you'll be all right
[1:15:47] and believe it just go on thanking him
[1:15:50] for it
[1:15:51] so that's the adopt a baby attitude
[1:15:53] we're gonna thank God and praise God
[1:15:54] before it even happens
[1:15:57] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:16:00] amen
[1:16:03] we're talking about supernatural crumbs
[1:16:07] and when we look at uh justice
[1:16:12] this this word and actually let me uh
[1:16:14] let me let uh brother brother brother
[1:16:16] brother Quentin read a scripture on
[1:16:19] uh Friday night and and I have been
[1:16:22] thinking about this sermon and then I'm
[1:16:23] gonna kind of put it to the shelf and
[1:16:26] then I was sitting here on Friday night
[1:16:27] brother Quentin came out and read a
[1:16:29] scripture I said oh I think that that
[1:16:31] one was for me brother Quinton and uh
[1:16:34] and I appreciate you reading this
[1:16:36] without a Luke chapter 16 and let's just
[1:16:39] read a little portion of it
[1:16:41] uh Luke 16
[1:16:45] and um I'll start at verse 19. this is
[1:16:49] the story of
[1:16:51] the the Rich Young Ruler the Bible says
[1:16:54] the rich man and Lazarus and I love how
[1:16:56] brother Quentin called it the brother
[1:16:58] Brandon brought it to us this rich man
[1:17:00] that we see in scripture uh Luke said
[1:17:03] Luke 16 he's also spoken of I think in
[1:17:06] Luke 18 I think Luke 12. I think those
[1:17:08] are three three scriptures but this this
[1:17:11] uh he and and portion of scripture it's
[1:17:14] a prophecy that Jesus is telling in a
[1:17:16] parable
[1:17:17] about a rich man that's going to
[1:17:19] approach and and how he's going to get
[1:17:21] richer and how different things are
[1:17:22] going to happen but eventually he's
[1:17:24] gonna uh lift his eyes in hell
[1:17:27] right he's going to reject the word he's
[1:17:29] going to reject Christ and he's going to
[1:17:31] lift his eyes in hell you know and and
[1:17:34] and the prophet is told so it's not just
[1:17:36] these several Richmond it's the same
[1:17:38] Rich Young Ruler that walked away from
[1:17:40] Christ
[1:17:40] hallelujah amen so here you know we see
[1:17:44] something in verse 19 there was a
[1:17:46] certain rich man
[1:17:47] which was clothing purple and fine linen
[1:17:50] and ferret sumptuously every day he was
[1:17:53] doing very well for himself and there
[1:17:55] was a certain beggar named Lazarus which
[1:17:59] was laid at his gate full of sores now
[1:18:03] look at this and designed to be fed
[1:18:07] with the crumbs
[1:18:09] which fell from the rich man's table
[1:18:11] moreover the dogs came and licked his
[1:18:14] swords and you know as I was just kind
[1:18:16] of meditating on that and you know uh my
[1:18:19] we all know the the end of this story uh
[1:18:22] Lazarus ended up in Abraham's bosom and
[1:18:25] the rich man ended up in hell we
[1:18:26] realized that and they had a
[1:18:28] conversation there in hell where uh the
[1:18:31] rich man was trying to get Abraham the
[1:18:32] sin Labs was back to go testify to his
[1:18:34] brothers to tell him not to come to this
[1:18:36] place and and all that we get that but I
[1:18:38] just wanted to kind of focus a little
[1:18:39] bit on this this man design crumbs
[1:18:43] uh oh I mean all the rich man wanted was
[1:18:46] just crumbs and and I just began to
[1:18:49] think what type of crumbs could these be
[1:18:51] that this man would just want crumbs
[1:18:54] Hallelujah crumbs is not enough to feed
[1:18:56] anybody curls is not enough to satisfy
[1:18:59] anybody but you know sometimes a man and
[1:19:02] especially in in in in in in our society
[1:19:05] we throw a lot more weight than just
[1:19:07] crumbs
[1:19:08] hello somebody we we thought we throwing
[1:19:11] a whole meal away
[1:19:13] right
[1:19:14] Hallelujah glory to God Amen even when
[1:19:18] it come to spiritual things we don't
[1:19:21] realize what we thrown away
[1:19:24] we don't realize what we're walking away
[1:19:26] from we don't realize the the the the
[1:19:28] the the the sustenance that's in there
[1:19:31] come on somebody you better watch what
[1:19:34] you throw away
[1:19:36] hallelujah amen brother brother Quentin
[1:19:38] told us on Friday night watch what you
[1:19:40] eat and also watch what you don't eat
[1:19:45] because the things you don't eat might
[1:19:48] actually be the vitamins that you need
[1:19:50] spiritually
[1:19:53] but this man was just just Desiring
[1:19:56] crumbs
[1:19:57] if I could just get crumbs from this
[1:19:59] this rich man say what was he throwing
[1:20:02] away that this man would want to sit at
[1:20:04] the gate it was enough being thrown away
[1:20:06] at its man felt that he could sustain
[1:20:08] himself
[1:20:10] here's the problem though this rich man
[1:20:13] amen uh never actually provided any
[1:20:16] crumbs to Lazarus he never gave him
[1:20:18] anything and I want to just kind of look
[1:20:20] at this word crimes because it's uh it's
[1:20:23] it's the the definition is a small
[1:20:25] particle or portion of anything it's
[1:20:28] just a fragment
[1:20:31] hallelujah it's just a small portion or
[1:20:34] just a fragment of something it's not
[1:20:36] it's not much
[1:20:38] oh my my my my my it's just a little bit
[1:20:43] it's just a teeny weeny
[1:20:47] Hallelujah probably something it won't
[1:20:49] even wet your appetite
[1:20:52] it's just it's just uh uh uh I mean
[1:20:56] you'll leave that Desiring more
[1:20:59] when you just have crumbs right it's
[1:21:02] just it's a small particle a portion of
[1:21:05] anything a fragment they said a bit a
[1:21:08] bit just a little bit and and I thought
[1:21:10] about a man uh different ones in
[1:21:13] scripture because you know this this
[1:21:15] this
[1:21:16] um this rich man did not share even his
[1:21:18] crumbs with Lazarus he wouldn't even
[1:21:21] just share his crumbs with Lazarus maybe
[1:21:25] if he would have shared his crumbs his
[1:21:27] uh his destination might have been a
[1:21:29] little different
[1:21:32] last is when asking for a lot just give
[1:21:35] me a chrome
[1:21:36] just just just give me a little bit of
[1:21:39] work you fearing sumptuously why don't
[1:21:42] you just give me just a little bit of

[1:22:43] capture in verse 11 first king 17 verse

[1:22:49] last and can I put it this way she was
[1:22:51] down to crumbs

[1:22:56] willing to do something with her crumbs
[1:22:59] Hallelujah here in first first Kings 17
[1:23:01] verse 11 says and as she was going here
[1:23:04] the prophet was was told to come to her
[1:23:07] house with Prophet Elijah and as as he
[1:23:09] gets there to the house uh God didn't
[1:23:12] tell him this woman was down the crumbs
[1:23:13] he just said I have I have ordained that
[1:23:16] this woman will sustain you during this
[1:23:18] time amen the famine was on glory to God
[1:23:22] there was no food I mean there was a
[1:23:24] lack of food there was a lack of rain or
[1:23:26] no water nothing to sustain the people
[1:23:28] at this time but here this woman has
[1:23:30] been ordained by God to sustain a
[1:23:33] prophet
[1:23:35] Hallelujah so when the prophet sees they
[1:23:37] says uh will you mind going to fetch me
[1:23:40] some water
[1:23:41] and here the Bible picks up says as she
[1:23:43] was going to fetch it
[1:23:45] he called her and said bring me I pray
[1:23:47] the immortal of bread in thine hand
[1:23:50] glory to God and she said as the Lord

[1:24:23] die because what I got in my little

[1:25:22] that the Lord sinneth rain upon the
[1:25:24] Earth this lady was willing to give her
[1:25:27] crumbs
[1:25:30] as she gave her crumbs to God she got a
[1:25:33] blessing Beyond
[1:25:34] imagination
[1:25:37] God can turn your crumbs into overflow
[1:25:44] God I ain't got but crumbs I got lit in

[1:25:53] gonna give my dollar
[1:25:55] and I'ma let God take the linen bless it
[1:26:00] crumbs see I I think there's many
[1:26:04] different uh passages of scripture that
[1:26:06] we could go to to show a man where God
[1:26:09] is used uh different ones where all they
[1:26:11] had was just crumbs just just a little a
[1:26:14] little bit just a little uh uh uh they
[1:26:17] didn't have much just a small particle a
[1:26:19] small portion but they brought whatever
[1:26:21] they had and they gave it to the Lord
[1:26:23] and he blessed it
[1:26:25] before I go further Amen to give you
[1:26:27] some more examples I was just looking
[1:26:29] amen at this word faith and and
[1:26:32] different statements that brother
[1:26:33] Brandon made about faith and I want to
[1:26:35] just give it to you faith don't reason
[1:26:38] at all
[1:26:39] Faith believes it
[1:26:42] Faith don't reason Faith don't dig and
[1:26:44] say that's all I got is this well God
[1:26:46] know what you got and he asks you to
[1:26:49] give that
[1:26:50] when you're down the crumbs give God
[1:26:52] your crumbs
[1:26:55] it says faith is so simple
[1:26:58] you don't even know you have it
[1:27:02] you don't even it's so simple that you
[1:27:04] don't know you have it I remember
[1:27:06] example that that brother Wesco used to
[1:27:08] give all the time and and many of y'all
[1:27:10] walked in today and you have faith in
[1:27:12] the chair that you're sitting in
[1:27:14] you have faith not one of y'all
[1:27:17] stopped and looked to see if the screws
[1:27:19] were still inside the chair
[1:27:21] everybody just put a pillow down and
[1:27:24] play and just put all your weight down
[1:27:26] in that chair you didn't even think
[1:27:28] about it you didn't ask nobody you
[1:27:31] didn't ask for Deacon or us to say is
[1:27:33] this channel can't you didn't ask
[1:27:34] nothing about that you the chair was
[1:27:37] designed to hold you
[1:27:40] the chair was made to hold you amen do
[1:27:43] you have confidence in the designer you
[1:27:46] had confidence in the person that made
[1:27:48] it that this chance gonna do exactly
[1:27:50] what it needs to do for me the word of
[1:27:52] God is designed to hold y'all the word
[1:27:56] of God is designed to keep you praise
[1:27:58] God the word of God will make a way for
[1:28:01] you
[1:28:03] put your weight on it
[1:28:06] drop your weight on the word of God
[1:28:09] don't ask no questions the reason we're
[1:28:13] God put your weight on the Promises of
[1:28:16] God
[1:28:22] faith is so simple you don't even know
[1:28:25] you have it
[1:28:27] it says now real Faith doesn't shift by
[1:28:29] Creeds and man-made doctrines and
[1:28:31] unbelief it stays right with the word
[1:28:34] real faith in the word where you can put
[1:28:37] your faith on where and where can you
[1:28:39] put your faith on anything else but the
[1:28:41] word
[1:28:42] we've done the statement he says faith
[1:28:44] has no hindrance
[1:28:47] there's nothing going to stop it
[1:28:50] amen and he used the uh the example of
[1:28:54] the Queen of Sheba and how she was
[1:28:56] approaching glory to God she she heard
[1:28:59] about Solomon she heard about the wisdom
[1:29:01] that was going forth there she's like I
[1:29:03] got to I just I need to just be in one
[1:29:05] service I just need to be in one I got
[1:29:07] to go see what this man is talking about
[1:29:09] what is happening there's Revival
[1:29:11] happening there in Israel I need to go
[1:29:13] see and this woman wrote 90 days on the
[1:29:16] back of a camel to get there to Solomon
[1:29:19] she has so many obstacles that she had
[1:29:22] to overcome amen first is that her her
[1:29:25] priest told if you if you go to that
[1:29:27] church we're going to kick you out of
[1:29:29] this one
[1:29:30] hallelujah amen she had money that she
[1:29:32] was carrying glory to God and she had
[1:29:35] robbed there were robbers on the desert
[1:29:37] that at any time could Rob anybody and
[1:29:39] they would have sick everything this
[1:29:41] lady had by being a woman and and on the
[1:29:44] on the back of a camera in a desert
[1:29:46] where she gonna use the restroom
[1:29:49] huh I mean think about all the
[1:29:52] hindrances that this lady had but yet
[1:29:54] she overcame every obstacle Amen to get
[1:29:58] to the presence of Solomon
[1:30:00] and when she got there she was willing
[1:30:02] to give her everything she got she say
[1:30:04] the haves have not even been told the
[1:30:06] things that I heard ain't even enough I
[1:30:08] mean I had to see this for myself
[1:30:12] Faith knows no hindrances
[1:30:16] there's nothing going to stop another
[1:30:18] statement it says When Faith speaks
[1:30:21] everything else sits down
[1:30:25] he said that's right that's right when
[1:30:27] it speaks everything else shuts up
[1:30:31] Hallelujah brother that's greater than
[1:30:33] EF Hutton
[1:30:36] that's bigger than EF hunting When Faith
[1:30:39] speaks everything shuts up the doctor's
[1:30:43] report shuts up what the bank said
[1:30:47] [Applause]
[1:30:50] we ain't listening to none of that
[1:30:53] faith is talking right now
[1:30:55] and we only want to hear what Faith's
[1:30:58] got to say
[1:31:01] God let Faith speak
[1:31:07] glory to God he says faith will always
[1:31:10] emit the word is truth
[1:31:12] amen see if you've got real faith in the
[1:31:15] Bible tells you that you're doing wrong
[1:31:17] you'll admit that you're wrong
[1:31:19] another one it says faith don't explain
[1:31:21] it
[1:31:23] amen did you did you know that Faith
[1:31:26] just believes it
[1:31:28] I like that and he gave an example you
[1:31:31] know I was just kind of uh actually I
[1:31:33] think that maybe the Lord inspired me uh
[1:31:35] no no no no no no no no uh he gave an
[1:31:37] example on this when he was saying how
[1:31:39] uh uh Faith don't Faith don't explain it
[1:31:41] and they gave an example of how Peter
[1:31:43] was there with Jesus and Jesus come out
[1:31:46] and preached this remarkable sermon amen
[1:31:49] and uh he says unless you eat my flesh
[1:31:52] and drink my blood you have no part with
[1:31:55] me and when Jesus preached that sermon
[1:31:57] the whole church was shook
[1:32:02] everybody start walking out of church
[1:32:04] that day I told y'all this man was crazy
[1:32:07] I mean this is it that no more coming to
[1:32:10] this church to eat his flesh what what
[1:32:14] does that mean they didn't wait for an
[1:32:16] explanation
[1:32:18] they just immediately took to themselves
[1:32:20] that we leave in church we cannot bring
[1:32:22] our families back here anymore and Jesus
[1:32:25] allowed each one to walk right out of
[1:32:27] the church
[1:32:28] God bless you God bless you God bless
[1:32:32] you God bless you I mean all the members
[1:32:35] walked out at one time it was 12 left
[1:32:39] and he looked at the 12 in Acts 12 and
[1:32:41] asked them a question will you also go
[1:32:46] no
[1:32:47] explanations will you also go I know you
[1:32:51] just heard the sermon and you saw the
[1:32:53] response will you also go
[1:32:58] Peter said these words because Peter had
[1:33:00] faith
[1:33:01] Peter said to whom shall we go
[1:33:05] Peter knew where he had come from the
[1:33:08] place he come from they didn't they
[1:33:10] weren't sharing things like that to whom
[1:33:12] shall we call only you have the words of
[1:33:15] eternal life
[1:33:16] amen amen hallelujah
[1:33:19] faith faith wasn't gonna be shook
[1:33:22] favor I mean Peter said I saw my cousin
[1:33:25] go
[1:33:26] I saw this one go my auntie my uncle I
[1:33:29] saw them leave too but I'ma stay right
[1:33:31] here
[1:33:33] I ain't got nowhere I can go
[1:33:35] maybe maybe they have a place they can
[1:33:37] go but I don't have nowhere I can go
[1:33:39] only you have the words of eternal life
[1:33:43] and you know that didn't even move Jesus
[1:33:46] he says okay I got 12 and one of y'all
[1:33:49] is a devil
[1:33:53] you imagine this
[1:33:55] you wanted a 12
[1:33:57] you don't know which one of y'all is the
[1:33:59] devil you could actually be
[1:34:02] the devil
[1:34:05] but I reminded of what brother Branham
[1:34:07] said one time he says he said I love him
[1:34:09] so much that even
[1:34:12] if he sent me to Hell after serving him
[1:34:16] with this life I would still serve him
[1:34:18] in this life
[1:34:20] see I'm gonna tell you something Faith
[1:34:22] Can't Be Moved by nothing
[1:34:24] and here's the other thing when they say
[1:34:26] faith does no no no explaining Peter
[1:34:29] couldn't explain what Jesus just said
[1:34:31] they have nothing somebody actually not
[1:34:33] Peter what you think he meant by that
[1:34:35] I don't know
[1:34:38] but I ain't going nowhere
[1:34:42] and see here's the thing about faith
[1:34:44] faith didn't ask you to understand
[1:34:46] Faith didn't ask you to explain
[1:34:49] Faith simply asks you to believe
[1:34:51] [Music]
[1:34:56] and here's another one about faith that
[1:34:57] I love brother Brown say faith makes you
[1:35:01] little
[1:35:05] I want y'all to get that one now Faith
[1:35:08] faith when you really
[1:35:11] like you little
[1:35:15] you get down the crumbs
[1:35:19] all right let's let's read a little bit
[1:35:21] more here my God my God my God here's
[1:35:24] one out of uh uh why Christ speak
[1:35:28] he says this
[1:35:30] but as Faith led him to take
[1:35:33] the choice of the word and not the
[1:35:35] glamor
[1:35:36] he took the word he's talking about
[1:35:37] Moses that's what Moses Faith did When
[1:35:40] Faith looks on God's words when Faith
[1:35:44] looks on God's words
[1:35:48] remember here was the glamor now of the
[1:35:50] world see the highest king of the world
[1:35:53] and and where was God's promise in the
[1:35:57] mud hole mud daubers but when Faith When
[1:36:00] Faith looks at God's words it esteems it
[1:36:04] Greater and more valuable than the best
[1:36:06] the world can show can I put it this way
[1:36:08] when Faith just looks at God's crumbs
[1:36:12] it's better than anything the devil can
[1:36:14] offer you
[1:36:16] amen God's crumbs is better than
[1:36:18] anything the devil can offer you
[1:36:22] Hallelujah glory to God he says uh more
[1:36:26] valid than the best the world can show
[1:36:27] yes sir when Faith looks at it when
[1:36:30] faith can see it when faith in the word
[1:36:32] can see the word may manifest it's more
[1:36:35] to them than all the glamor and
[1:36:37] archbishopry and and everything else you
[1:36:39] can speak of Faith does it you can see
[1:36:42] the worst the the despised and rejected
[1:36:45] the whatever it might be let it be at
[1:36:48] its worst and yet Faith esteemed that a
[1:36:51] million million miles higher than the
[1:36:53] best the world can produce amen that's
[1:36:56] the way that's the that's the way we
[1:36:57] sing that song I'll take the way with
[1:37:00] the Lord's despised few see oh man he
[1:37:03] goes on says for you see faith sees what
[1:37:06] God's once done oh I hope this goes in
[1:37:10] faith does look at the present time I'm
[1:37:12] sorry Faith doesn't look at the present
[1:37:14] time Faith doesn't see this here Faith
[1:37:18] looks to see what God wants and works
[1:37:20] accordingly that's what faith does it
[1:37:23] sees what God wants and what God wants
[1:37:25] done and Faith operates through that
[1:37:28] faith is a long-range vision
[1:37:32] and here's a good one it don't lower its
[1:37:36] sights
[1:37:37] amen it it holds to the Target amen any
[1:37:41] good shooter knows that see it's a long
[1:37:44] range it's a telescope it's a binocular
[1:37:47] that you don't look around here you
[1:37:48] don't you don't use binoculars to look
[1:37:50] to see what time it is see you don't use
[1:37:53] that but you use binoculars to look away
[1:37:55] off and Faith does that Faith picks up
[1:37:58] God's binoculars see both of them he's
[1:38:01] talking about the Bible right here these
[1:38:03] are God's binoculars the Old Testament
[1:38:04] and the New Testament it says it picks
[1:38:07] up God's binoculars both of them both
[1:38:09] sides the New and Old Testament and sees
[1:38:11] every promise that he made and they've
[1:38:14] seized it out yonder and they chooses
[1:38:16] that regardless of what the present
[1:38:19] tense says here he looks at the end he
[1:38:22] don't drop his sights down to look this
[1:38:24] way he looks out yonder he keeps the
[1:38:26] Crosshair debt send it on the word
[1:38:28] that's what faith does that's the faith
[1:38:30] that's in a man that does those things
[1:38:32] and I'm telling you when we got faith
[1:38:34] all we look at is what the word says
[1:38:37] and that's all we can look at is what
[1:38:39] the word says all I want to hear is what
[1:38:41] the word says when I'm using my faith I
[1:38:44] was telling you you know this woman
[1:38:46] there Amen in First Kings she just gave
[1:38:50] God just a crumbs
[1:38:52] and God took a crumbs and and and and
[1:38:54] did something Supernatural with her
[1:38:56] crumbs turned the whole thing around I
[1:38:59] mean here she was down to her last but
[1:39:01] because she was willing to give her
[1:39:02] crumbs God said you know what your
[1:39:04] Barrel ain't gonna go empty your cruise
[1:39:06] won't run dry all right just because she
[1:39:08] was willing to give God crumbs sometimes
[1:39:11] it don't take God much he he can just
[1:39:13] work with the little that you got if
[1:39:15] you'll give it completely
[1:39:17] if you'll give it holy God can do
[1:39:19] something with it I was thinking on this
[1:39:21] uh other people that just gave crumbs
[1:39:24] when you when you read the story of the
[1:39:26] of the 5 000 that was fed
[1:39:29] has 5 000 people in actually the Bible
[1:39:32] says 5 000 men and it wasn't counting
[1:39:35] the women and the children
[1:39:37] with two fish and five loaves of bread
[1:39:40] really all they gave Jesus to work with
[1:39:43] was crumbs when you're looking at a
[1:39:45] group that size
[1:39:47] but it took the crumbs and did something
[1:39:50] Supernatural with it
[1:39:53] if I can just encourage you to do one
[1:39:55] thing just give God what you got
[1:39:59] sister Michelle used to sing the song
[1:40:01] what's that you got out of your hand
[1:40:03] I can use it
[1:40:06] Hallelujah but you got to be willing to
[1:40:09] lose it
[1:40:10] take the little you have
[1:40:13] gotta make it Grand
[1:40:17] am else should die and uh more than
[1:40:20] Supply your need but you got to be
[1:40:22] willing to give God what you got God all
[1:40:26] I got is crumbs
[1:40:30] but here go my crumbs Jesus
[1:40:34] watch him do something Supernatural with
[1:40:36] your crumbs
[1:40:38] if your life is in Chrome crumb
[1:40:41] condition
[1:40:44] your life is in Chrome condition just
[1:40:46] give that to Jesus
[1:40:48] Lord I done messed up I don't did this I
[1:40:50] don't did that oh Lord he can use
[1:40:53] anything you give it to if you just give
[1:40:55] it all
[1:40:58] right
[1:41:00] I got crumbs
[1:41:02] and that's what he asking for
[1:41:04] that's what the woman she she's like
[1:41:06] like I ain't got no I wish I Prophet you
[1:41:08] came at the wrong time no no I came at
[1:41:10] the right time I want your crumbs
[1:41:13] I want you to cross be willing to give
[1:41:16] crumbs
[1:41:20] here you know we we you look at the 5000
[1:41:23] but it also a couple couple chapters
[1:41:26] later God did the same thing with four
[1:41:28] thousand and he had seven loaves of
[1:41:30] bread and just a few small fishes in the
[1:41:32] any and he and he took the crumbs and
[1:41:34] blessed it
[1:41:36] did something Supernatural
[1:41:38] with just a small particle he fed four
[1:41:40] thousand
[1:41:41] Hallelujah I um
[1:41:47] I want to say this don't just be willing
[1:41:50] to give God your crumbs
[1:41:52] but also be willing to receive from God
[1:41:55] crumbs
[1:41:59] don't just be willing to give God your
[1:42:01] crumbs but we're willing to also receive
[1:42:04] from God
[1:42:05] crumbs
[1:42:06] because God's crumbs are not like your
[1:42:09] crumbs
[1:42:13] God's Little will overflow you
[1:42:18] God's Little will overtake you
[1:42:21] God's Little you can't even handle
[1:42:26] Hallelujah Church
[1:42:28] I'm talking about supernatural crumbs
[1:42:33] there was a woman
[1:42:35] that we find in Scripture
[1:42:37] she was willing to just take crumbs
[1:42:42] and because she was humble enough
[1:42:46] to just want the little hey God you got
[1:42:49] to give me all this and you got to give
[1:42:51] me all that but just just give me a
[1:42:53] little bit
[1:42:54] if you can just give me a little bit I
[1:42:56] think I'll be all right actually I know
[1:42:58] I'll be all right if Lazarus sitting at
[1:43:02] the Gate of the rich man could feel like
[1:43:04] he could be sustained with crumbs
[1:43:07] what about us when we're sitting at the
[1:43:10] feet of Jesus
[1:43:12] will be sustained by his crumbs
[1:43:16] oh I'm just I mean it's just so many
[1:43:18] things you know even even
[1:43:20] um you go back to scripture there was a
[1:43:23] uh an Old Testament God told him when
[1:43:25] you reap the field
[1:43:28] don't just don't take everything out the
[1:43:30] field amen just leave a little bit in
[1:43:33] the corner of the field amen for the
[1:43:34] poor to get to what he's saying give
[1:43:36] them just some crumbs
[1:43:39] hallelujah amen I want to sustain them
[1:43:41] too so don't don't try to take it off
[1:43:43] and remember a man when um my when uh
[1:43:46] when Ruth came into the field
[1:43:48] Hallelujah glory to God the uh Boaz told
[1:43:52] a Reaper saying now when you when you're
[1:43:53] reaping the field say now I don't want
[1:43:55] her to work too hard it says she don't
[1:43:58] need to be out there trying to grab
[1:43:59] nothing but I want you to do something
[1:44:00] drop a little bit
[1:44:02] just a little bit drop it on purpose for
[1:44:05] Ruth
[1:44:06] Amen Let Ruth pick up some crumbs
[1:44:10] and these problems will sustain Ruth and
[1:44:12] Naomi
[1:44:15] God want to make sure you're sustained
[1:44:17] in this hour
[1:44:19] are you willing to just take God's
[1:44:20] Little
[1:44:22] are you willing to give God your little
[1:44:24] as long as you're giving with all your
[1:44:26] heart
[1:44:28] this woman we we read about it here in
[1:44:31] in the Bible and amen Matthew 14 is
[1:44:34] where I want to go to
[1:44:39] Matthew 14.
[1:44:42] Oh Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory
[1:44:49] I might that might be Matthew 15. I
[1:44:51] might have something wrong here hold on
[1:44:52] one second
[1:44:54] yes Matthew uh
[1:44:56] 15 verse 21.
[1:45:00] look at this woman
[1:45:05] says then Jesus went Vince
[1:45:09] and departed into the coast of tire and
[1:45:11] sidon
[1:45:14] and behold a woman of Canaan came out of
[1:45:17] the sand coast and crowded him saying
[1:45:19] have mercy on me O Lord thou son of
[1:45:22] David my daughter is grievously vexed
[1:45:25] with the Devil
[1:45:27] but he answered her not a word
[1:45:30] and his disciples came in but saw him
[1:45:32] saying send her away for she cries after
[1:45:35] us now let's let's just kind of get on
[1:45:36] the scene a little bit here let me just
[1:45:38] read the next verse before I go to uh uh
[1:45:41] and I want to step into something says
[1:45:43] but but he answered and said I am not
[1:45:46] sent
[1:45:47] but unto the lost sheep of the House of
[1:45:49] Israel
[1:45:50] now
[1:45:52] um
[1:45:53] what we see if you if you go back and
[1:45:56] just kind of read this chapter Jesus was
[1:45:58] just having this great discussion with
[1:46:00] the Pharisees and Sadducees they always
[1:46:02] got questions about the word they not
[1:46:05] they actually don't have questions where
[1:46:06] they're really seeking answers
[1:46:08] oh y'all y'all let me let me just make
[1:46:10] sure everybody ain't got questions where
[1:46:14] they seeking
[1:46:16] seeking these people
[1:46:20] these people and he was just really in a
[1:46:22] situation like look I'm just kind of
[1:46:23] getting tired of oh yeah either y'all
[1:46:26] gonna believe or not believe and he
[1:46:28] realized I'm not sent to these Pharisees
[1:46:30] and Sadducees anyway hey man sorry so he
[1:46:32] uh he decides to kind of get a little
[1:46:35] rest and as he's getting rest he goes to
[1:46:37] the city a man tire and sidon that's
[1:46:40] just it's two two cities amen Sinai was
[1:46:43] the first city but it's about 25 miles
[1:46:46] um apart and and they're like Twin
[1:46:48] Cities right so so Jesus goes just to
[1:46:50] kind of get a little rest in this area
[1:46:52] now these cities are not really cities
[1:46:55] of Israel They Don't Really belong to
[1:46:57] Israel I believe they belong to the
[1:46:58] syrians or something like that but Jesus
[1:47:00] is going down here and Jesus tells this
[1:47:03] what I'm saying now I'm only sent to the
[1:47:05] lost sheep of Israel this woman realized
[1:47:08] now if you were sent to the Sheep of
[1:47:10] Israel what you didn't do an entire in
[1:47:12] sidon
[1:47:14] why are you over here entire Sinai now
[1:47:17] now maybe she's saying I might not have
[1:47:19] been able to come as a gentile into
[1:47:21] Israel to get what I needed but I found
[1:47:23] that you came to where I'm at
[1:47:26] that's right guess what and since you
[1:47:29] were here he was coming to get rest but
[1:47:32] since you here I got a request and this
[1:47:35] lady had faith that was not going to be
[1:47:37] moved this lady had faith that would not
[1:47:40] take no for an answer this lady had
[1:47:43] faith that she would take God for his
[1:47:45] crumb
[1:47:50] she makes a statement here
[1:47:52] and when he when he tells her you know
[1:47:54] uh I'm not sent you know first first of
[1:47:57] all let me let me let's just back up a
[1:47:59] little bit when she says Lord thou son
[1:48:01] of David in verse 22 Lord thou son of
[1:48:04] David my daughters grievously vexed with
[1:48:07] the devil but he answered her not
[1:48:09] and brother random makes a statement
[1:48:10] that she had no right
[1:48:13] to call him
[1:48:15] son of David
[1:48:17] see only the Jews could lay claims on
[1:48:20] him as son of David this is why he did
[1:48:22] not respond because she had no right to
[1:48:26] call him son of David
[1:48:28] brother man said he's the son of David
[1:48:31] to the Jew amen but but but uh but he
[1:48:34] says
[1:48:37] call him son of David he said nothing
[1:48:39] then it just he just mentioned to us say
[1:48:41] look
[1:48:42] uh I'm not sent but unto the lost sheep
[1:48:45] of the House of Israel and she like okay
[1:48:47] okay I got you but you over here entire
[1:48:48] and sidon you're not in Israel right now
[1:48:51] you entire sidon and look she said not
[1:48:54] in her heart she like the same God that
[1:48:57] moves in Israel is standing here now and
[1:49:00] tiring Sinai that same God can move for
[1:49:03] me
[1:49:07] verse 25 says
[1:49:09] then came she and worship him saying now
[1:49:12] see this is here's the thing when I when
[1:49:14] I said earlier
[1:49:15] Faith makes you little
[1:49:18] Faith makes you little watch what this
[1:49:20] lady had faith faith that would not be
[1:49:22] moved faith that would not reason faith
[1:49:24] that would not take no for an answer oh
[1:49:28] even when Jesus is saying no her faith
[1:49:32] is still saying yes
[1:49:35] faith that moves God
[1:49:40] let me let me let me let me let me let
[1:49:42] me let me just throw something else at
[1:49:43] you and I I'm not going to read all this
[1:49:45] there's a statement brother saying do
[1:49:47] you know God does things sometimes just
[1:49:49] to do things a different way just to
[1:49:52] find out what people will do
[1:49:56] that's right
[1:50:01] hey let me
[1:50:04] God will do things sometimes just to see
[1:50:06] what you're going to do
[1:50:09] so he he responded to this lady in such
[1:50:11] he made this comment to her right about
[1:50:14] I'm sent to the lost sheep of Israel
[1:50:17] he did that just to see what her
[1:50:19] response was going to be and then he
[1:50:21] kept going deeper
[1:50:23] Watch What Happens in verse 25 then came
[1:50:26] she and worship him saying Lord
[1:50:29] help me now when she called him son of
[1:50:33] David
[1:50:34] she had no right to calm that being a
[1:50:37] gentile but when she said Lord help me
[1:50:40] the thing changed and I like this
[1:50:42] because brother Quinton brought it to
[1:50:44] attention Some People Want Jesus to be
[1:50:46] their savior
[1:50:48] but they don't want him to be Lord
[1:50:50] savior means he just keeps saving you
[1:50:53] from your sin and from your troubles but
[1:50:55] Lord means he's your ruler
[1:50:59] I want him to be my savior and I want
[1:51:02] him to be my Lord
[1:51:04] she said Lord
[1:51:06] help me
[1:51:10] verse 26 he does something now but he
[1:51:12] answered and said it is not meat
[1:51:18] to take the children's bread
[1:51:21] and to cast it to dogs
[1:51:25] now now see here's another one he's
[1:51:26] doing the shake of Faith but see when
[1:51:29] you really got faith no matter what
[1:51:30] anybody say
[1:51:32] [Music]
[1:51:33] that's right God will do things
[1:51:37] intentionally
[1:51:38] to shake your faith
[1:51:41] but he's trying to see if his real true
[1:51:44] Faith because if it's true Faith then
[1:51:46] what God does intentionally will still
[1:51:49] not shaken
[1:51:57] I'm talking about God will do something
[1:51:59] intentionally try to shake it
[1:52:01] but you gotta
[1:52:03] hold the target
[1:52:04] brother Ramsey you got that crosshairs I
[1:52:06] mean you I got a line on the target
[1:52:08] ready to pull the trigger
[1:52:11] God ain't gonna let this thing go
[1:52:14] look I I can you gotta get on the scene
[1:52:16] let's say that you entire inside
[1:52:20] you came to me I didn't come to you you
[1:52:23] came over here and and the same
[1:52:26] testimony said I heard about you over
[1:52:28] there I know you're here to get rest
[1:52:31] but I have a need
[1:52:35] and I realized the only person
[1:52:37] Hallelujah that can change what's going
[1:52:40] on in my life it's you
[1:52:42] my doctor can't do it my my pastor can't
[1:52:46] do it my Deacon can't do it nobody can
[1:52:49] do it but Jesus
[1:52:53] I might be approaching you wrong
[1:52:56] I'm calling your son of David and I'm
[1:52:58] not not getting any response you ignore
[1:53:00] me but Lord
[1:53:03] [Music]
[1:53:05] Lord have mercy on me
[1:53:08] see you got to have the right attitude
[1:53:11] when you're approaching him
[1:53:15] lord lord lord lord lord lord Lord have
[1:53:18] mercy
[1:53:20] then he tells her the shake of faith
[1:53:23] it's not meat
[1:53:26] to take the children's bread
[1:53:29] and cast it to dogs really he's just
[1:53:31] saying your people are dogs
[1:53:35] now that was that was enough for this
[1:53:36] lady to get upset with and and and uh
[1:53:40] now you know here I'm I'm coming to you
[1:53:42] and I'm begging you and at this moment
[1:53:44] you call me a dog uh now that's a little
[1:53:47] bit too much
[1:53:51] because you know she didn't have this
[1:53:53] this version the you know she ain't like
[1:53:55] the sisters today who you think you
[1:53:57] talking to I ain't gotta take that
[1:54:02] Faith makes you little
[1:54:06] [Music]
[1:54:08] you know it's reason reason you may be
[1:54:10] taking that because God is testing you
[1:54:16] we act like we bigger than Jesus
[1:54:19] Jesus was spit on
[1:54:22] nailed to a cross
[1:54:25] called the devil
[1:54:27] I mean he was criticized I mean he went
[1:54:29] through all kind of stuff and he did it
[1:54:31] without complaining
[1:54:34] and we can't take nothing
[1:54:36] but this woman her faith would not be
[1:54:39] moved
[1:54:41] look at this one she just got caught a
[1:54:44] dog
[1:54:46] watch a response not not not not get up
[1:54:49] and leave the meeting
[1:54:51] not not oh I can't believe he said that
[1:54:54] not not go to Facebook
[1:54:57] not go to social media
[1:55:00] and post what you know what Jesus said
[1:55:03] he called me a dog
[1:55:06] this is the loving Jesus
[1:55:10] no that's not her that's not the way she
[1:55:13] handled things look at what she said she
[1:55:16] said she said truth Lord see Faith
[1:55:18] always acknowledges that the word is
[1:55:21] right
[1:55:24] so she said truth Lord
[1:55:27] amen says uh yet the dogs
[1:55:31] you telling the truth Jesus but yet the
[1:55:34] dogs
[1:55:35] eat of the crumbs
[1:55:38] which fall from the master's table
[1:55:41] see she's saying look I'm I I'm here
[1:55:44] just to get crumbs if you just give me a
[1:55:47] Crump a chroma take care of my situation
[1:55:51] amen one of God's crumbs is greater than
[1:55:53] anything you can ask for
[1:55:55] be willing to take a crumb
[1:55:59] can you this crumb brought a change in
[1:56:02] her house
[1:56:03] this crumb brought Deliverance to her
[1:56:06] daughter
[1:56:07] but I want to tell you was more than
[1:56:08] just the crumb it was her attitude
[1:56:12] in receiving the crumb
[1:56:15] even dogs
[1:56:21] can eat crumbs
[1:56:23] as they fall from the master State we're
[1:56:25] not eating at the table
[1:56:28] your dog shouldn't be eating at no table
[1:56:32] we're not eating at the table
[1:56:36] but we do hang
[1:56:39] up because just in case
[1:56:41] a crown
[1:56:45] and if you got a dog
[1:56:51] you could have just fed that dog in his
[1:56:54] bowl and then sit there eating this bowl
[1:56:56] but he see you eating
[1:57:00] and it's all kind of he don't bother you
[1:57:02] while you're eating he just hang around
[1:57:04] because he he got he got this stuff this
[1:57:06] this sense they didn't know something I
[1:57:09] don't care how good you are with a fork
[1:57:12] and your knife somehow things begin to
[1:57:15] creep out they fall off your plate
[1:57:16] somehow
[1:57:18] and the dog is sitting there just
[1:57:20] waiting
[1:57:22] because soon as something fall to the
[1:57:24] ground that dog is all over it you don't
[1:57:27] even get a chance to pick it up
[1:57:30] the dog the dog and and there's
[1:57:32] something about the dog hanging around
[1:57:33] the table he knows good food falling off
[1:57:35] the table
[1:57:39] and I just hang around where I know the
[1:57:41] blessings are flowing
[1:57:43] brother if I see you being blessed I'm
[1:57:45] Gonna Get Next To You imma hang out next
[1:57:47] and since I see you again imma stand and
[1:57:50] talk to you a little bit
[1:57:51] because if I could just get a crumb
[1:57:57] I ain't jealous about what God is doing
[1:58:00] in your life if I could just get a
[1:58:03] chrome
[1:58:05] I'm gonna fall off towards me
[1:58:12] one crumb
[1:58:15] can change my Outlook
[1:58:18] one crumb
[1:58:20] can change my whole situation
[1:58:23] one crumb can bring healing to my body
[1:58:28] I've been suffering for years but I got
[1:58:31] a crumb
[1:58:34] even the dogs
[1:58:40] even the dogs
[1:58:43] eat the crumbs which fall from the
[1:58:45] master's table
[1:58:47] then Jesus answered see he wasn't
[1:58:50] talking at first but Faith moved them
[1:58:53] then Jesus answered and said to her oh
[1:58:56] what man
[1:59:00] great is thy faith
[1:59:04] and since you got so much Faith be it
[1:59:07] unto thee even
[1:59:10] as thou wilt
[1:59:13] and her daughter was made whole from
[1:59:15] that very hour
[1:59:16] let me just read you something her
[1:59:18] daughters make whole because of This
[1:59:19] Woman's faith
[1:59:21] and not only just because because she
[1:59:23] was willing to endure
[1:59:25] every criticism
[1:59:27] she was willing to even endure rejection
[1:59:29] from Jesus
[1:59:33] no I can't I'm sorry I I understand I
[1:59:36] approach it the wrong way I said it the
[1:59:38] wrong way Lord I call you son of David
[1:59:41] but now let me Lord Lord Lord
[1:59:43] let me let me approach it the right way
[1:59:45] help me
[1:59:46] I I know I know I don't heard all the
[1:59:49] testimonies happening in Israel and
[1:59:51] ain't nothing happened down here in time
[1:59:52] I wish I could be in Israel
[1:59:56] but since you came to me
[2:00:00] and they told me you was here trying to
[2:00:02] get some rest I'm sorry to interrupt
[2:00:04] your rest
[2:00:06] since you here in my city
[2:00:10] I'ma need a crumb
[2:00:14] I'm gonna need a crow
[2:00:16] let's look at something
[2:00:19] oh my
[2:00:21] just a couple couple more quotes here
[2:00:23] I'm going back to as the eagle stir uh
[2:00:26] up her nest
[2:00:28] says you have to come with the right
[2:00:29] kind of approach to God
[2:00:31] if you come selfish
[2:00:34] if you come in any other approach but
[2:00:37] the right mental attitude towards God or
[2:00:40] any Divine gift you'll never receive any
[2:00:42] benefits from it
[2:00:45] this is the second little uh thing I got
[2:00:47] on on that as an eagle stirth and that's
[2:00:49] says um uh you'll never receive any
[2:00:52] benefits from it you've got to come with
[2:00:55] your surrendered all to God
[2:00:58] look at the sir Phoenician woman when
[2:01:00] she was told by Jesus it's not right for
[2:01:03] me to take the children's bread and feed
[2:01:06] you dogs
[2:01:08] what would you have what would you have
[2:01:11] said if he have called you a dog you'd
[2:01:14] have said I would join the next church
[2:01:16] but not her she knew who she was talking
[2:01:20] to she said Lord that's right you're so
[2:01:23] right in that but the dogs is willing to
[2:01:26] eat the scraps under the master's table
[2:01:29] that got him
[2:01:31] says that got him my uh it says that was
[2:01:35] it that's what he was waiting for you to
[2:01:38] do humble yourself into such a place no
[2:01:43] matter how God sends it to you see don't
[2:01:45] make an idol out of God no matter how
[2:01:48] God sends it to you if you're healed
[2:01:50] instantly if you're healed by degrees
[2:01:53] that means over time is if you're if
[2:01:55] you're put off like Abraham was 25 years
[2:01:58] waiting for the promise but instead of
[2:02:00] getting weak he got stronger all the
[2:02:02] time giving praise to God just so that
[2:02:05] you know that God promised it and you
[2:02:08] accept it for yourself
[2:02:10] it's got to come to pass
[2:02:13] I believe that
[2:02:16] see when you're going through a trial
[2:02:17] don't let your faith get weaker
[2:02:21] let it get stronger
[2:02:24] I want to go to questions and answers on
[2:02:26] the Holy Ghost
[2:02:28] couple statements here brother Brandon
[2:02:30] makes I just I just love this you got to
[2:02:31] be willing to give crumbs you got to be
[2:02:34] willing to receive crops
[2:02:36] when then when they're in the hands of
[2:02:38] God they become Supernatural crumbs
[2:02:41] Hallelujah
[2:02:44] he says I want you to remember this and
[2:02:46] I'll try to get over get uh go over it
[2:02:49] in the morning again Gentiles the gospel
[2:02:53] that's given to them is a Faith gospel
[2:02:56] it says not a works at all like I said
[2:02:59] last night when the Holy Ghost fell at
[2:03:01] Pentecost when they went down to the
[2:03:03] Jews Acts 19 5 they had to lay hands on
[2:03:07] them that they receive it and when they
[2:03:09] went down to the Samaritans they had to
[2:03:11] lay hands on them but when they come to
[2:03:13] the Gentiles at Cornelius house while
[2:03:17] Peter spanked these words no laying of
[2:03:21] hands the Holy Ghost feeling them as
[2:03:22] Peter spoke the word see this is the
[2:03:25] difference in Gentile Faith amen and
[2:03:27] what the Jewish the Jewish faith Gentile
[2:03:29] faith is speak the word only
[2:03:33] yes sir Hallelujah Watch What Happens
[2:03:36] here he goes on and says when the little
[2:03:37] girl died jairus's daughter the preset
[2:03:40] come lay hands on her
[2:03:42] and she will live but when the Roman
[2:03:45] Centurion the Gentiles said I'm not
[2:03:47] worried that you come under my roof
[2:03:50] speak the word that's it see the sir
[2:03:52] Phoenician Woman Greek actually what she
[2:03:54] was when Jesus said to her it's not meat
[2:03:58] for me to take the children's bread and
[2:04:00] to give it to dogs she said that's true
[2:04:03] Lord but the dogs under the table eats
[2:04:06] the children's crumbs he said for this
[2:04:09] thing now you if you pick if we would
[2:04:10] have picked it up in March 7 you'll see
[2:04:13] he made that statement we're talking
[2:04:14] about the same story for this saying let
[2:04:17] me just tell you something you got to
[2:04:18] say the right thing
[2:04:21] when she said even the dogs
[2:04:25] can get crumbs from the master's table
[2:04:27] Jesus said for this saying go find your
[2:04:31] daughter mate hole
[2:04:34] if you say the right thing if you say
[2:04:36] the right thing you can get a blessing
[2:04:37] for this saying
[2:04:40] look at look at this uh he gonna go on
[2:04:42] he says um
[2:04:43] uh he says uh the uh but the dogs eat
[2:04:47] the dogs under the table eat the
[2:04:49] children's Children's crumbs he said for
[2:04:51] this thing the devil's left your
[2:04:52] daughter
[2:04:53] say good things then
[2:04:56] say something good about somebody talk
[2:04:59] about Jesus say something loyal
[2:05:02] something real that's the way to get rid
[2:05:06] of devils
[2:05:09] Hallelujah he never said he never prayed
[2:05:12] for the girl
[2:05:14] you talk about this this woman daughter
[2:05:16] to come she acts she asks I need you to
[2:05:19] come do some brother Branham say Jesus
[2:05:21] never prayed for the door the girl
[2:05:27] her action her attitude her response is
[2:05:32] what actually produced The Healing
[2:05:37] I don't know if we get that it wasn't
[2:05:39] even Jesus prayer
[2:05:43] it was the latest attitude it was the
[2:05:46] latest action it was the latest response
[2:05:49] that got her answer to prayer
[2:05:52] Jesus actually did not amen pray for her
[2:05:56] daughter the way she wanted but Jesus
[2:05:58] gave her the answer that got it already
[2:05:59] that she really wanted from God your
[2:06:02] daughter is already healed
[2:06:05] and you want to know how because of your
[2:06:07] faith
[2:06:13] we got to have the right attitude he
[2:06:15] never prayed for the girl he never said
[2:06:18] one thing about her being healed he just
[2:06:20] said for this saying
[2:06:23] for the sake he says had it right the
[2:06:25] other day she didn't ask for nothing she
[2:06:28] was just sitting there but she said the
[2:06:32] right thing which pleased the Holy
[2:06:34] Spirit
[2:06:35] mama just inject that real quick we all
[2:06:38] know the story but some may not know it
[2:06:40] but brother Brandon went to Hattie
[2:06:42] Wright's house one time just sharing
[2:06:43] testimonies and as is there sharing
[2:06:46] testimonies about how God had given him
[2:06:47] this ability uh God had quickened the
[2:06:50] scripture if you say to the mountain be
[2:06:52] thy removed be thou cast into the sea
[2:06:54] don't down in your heart you can have
[2:06:55] what you say he says do you believe that
[2:06:57] God began to speak to him do you believe
[2:06:58] he said yeah I believe him it says well
[2:07:01] uh he says but I just been afraid to
[2:07:03] preach it because I don't really
[2:07:04] understand it he said he says well uh
[2:07:06] what you out here hunting for I'm
[2:07:07] hunting for squirrels he says well why
[2:07:09] don't you speak to where the squirrel is
[2:07:11] going to be and now how many squirrels
[2:07:12] you want says I want three well speak
[2:07:14] where they're going to be and I'll I'll
[2:07:16] give you those squirrels he said what I
[2:07:19] ain't never had nothing he says okay I'm
[2:07:20] gonna say something crazy I want the
[2:07:21] squirrel to do this do this do this jump
[2:07:23] out on this limb and I'm going to shoot
[2:07:25] it right there squirrel come out of
[2:07:26] nowhere
[2:07:27] everything he said he shot it knocked
[2:07:29] the first one down
[2:07:32] say where the next one will come second
[2:07:34] would come he said I want to do this do
[2:07:36] that and I'm shooting over there it did
[2:07:37] exactly shot it knocked it down and he
[2:07:40] got to the point he said my God that
[2:07:43] spoken word creation squirrels come out
[2:07:45] of nowhere I don't think that's that's
[2:07:47] crazy because a lamb a ram came out of
[2:07:50] nowhere for Abraham
[2:07:53] Abraham actually spoke it Abraham said
[2:07:57] the Lord will provide himself
[2:08:00] a sacrifice and that scripture had a
[2:08:04] dual meaning because it was Christ
[2:08:06] coming himself as well as God provided a
[2:08:09] sacrifice for Abraham
[2:08:10] spoken word
[2:08:12] brother random got the two squirrels and
[2:08:14] he was on his way home and again got him
[2:08:17] packed him give him relief God said no
[2:08:18] no no don't go nowhere
[2:08:21] how many did you ask for
[2:08:23] three
[2:08:25] speak it again
[2:08:27] and sit here and when you speak it here
[2:08:30] it is now here's the other part when you
[2:08:32] speak it wait on it
[2:08:36] just wait on it and he sat down he
[2:08:40] waited here come that third squirrel
[2:08:42] doing exactly what he's saying
[2:08:44] shot it
[2:08:45] God gave him three squirrels and God did
[2:08:47] it twice in his life
[2:08:53] he went to Hattie Wright's house and he
[2:08:55] knew people wouldn't believe that just
[2:08:56] this is just crazy people ain't gonna
[2:08:58] believe what I'm just testing on and I'm
[2:08:59] just sharing but this book and word
[2:09:00] creation I don't believe and as as he
[2:09:03] was sharing sharing it had it right was
[2:09:05] there she was a poor woman just
[2:09:07] giving a few dollars actually let me put
[2:09:09] it this way had it right at just giving
[2:09:11] crumbs
[2:09:14] to the building fine
[2:09:18] she had a very a small amount that she
[2:09:21] reached in and got her crumbs and she
[2:09:23] brought that to God the Lord I want to
[2:09:26] give you my crumbs
[2:09:27] and he and when she gave the crumbs she
[2:09:30] was not even expecting anything back
[2:09:31] went on home about her business but here
[2:09:34] come brother Branham I think he took
[2:09:36] that money and said I got to give this
[2:09:38] back to this lady I can't let her and
[2:09:39] then the Holy Spirit comes with that I
[2:09:41] stop the woman
[2:09:43] when I was on Earth that I stopped the
[2:09:46] woman that came everybody else was
[2:09:48] dropping their money in the bucket but I
[2:09:50] let a lady come and give
[2:09:52] crumbs
[2:09:53] two peonies
[2:09:56] I did that for a reason I didn't stop
[2:09:59] her had it right gave her best
[2:10:01] because I had something better for her
[2:10:04] brother random went to the house sharing
[2:10:06] his testimony and he said I can't give
[2:10:07] it back the money so I just sit here and
[2:10:09] eat and fellowship and and as they're
[2:10:11] sitting there eating and all of a sudden
[2:10:12] the Holy Ghost came into the room and
[2:10:15] and had it right had it right uh when
[2:10:16] she heard the testimony about the
[2:10:18] squirrels being created she said that's
[2:10:19] nothing but the truth
[2:10:22] now I'm gonna say something to y'all
[2:10:26] Hattie Wright had to open up her mouth
[2:10:30] can I say it like this had it right was
[2:10:32] not sitting in her house just nodding
[2:10:34] her head
[2:10:38] [Music]
[2:10:42] and inside she's saying amen
[2:10:45] [Music]
[2:10:48] but God needed to hear it
[2:10:52] God needed something to come out from
[2:10:55] the inside
[2:10:56] if it's the word then say Amen to the
[2:11:00] word
[2:11:03] and Hattie Wright said amen that's
[2:11:06] nothing but the truth
[2:11:08] and when when when Hetty Wright said
[2:11:11] that the whole atmosphere changed
[2:11:13] a brother man I'm saying I mean the Holy
[2:11:15] Spirit came to say now tell her whatever
[2:11:17] she asked for right now she can have
[2:11:21] and if she don't get it right now tell
[2:11:23] her you're a false prophet
[2:11:27] had it right look and say what I wasn't
[2:11:29] expecting that had had you ain't got no
[2:11:31] money you want money actual money Hattie
[2:11:34] you want you want your mama and dad is
[2:11:36] sick they old and old and and and and
[2:11:38] and Pharrell asks for the hell your
[2:11:40] sister been sick in a wheelchair for
[2:11:42] years all her life asked for her healing

[2:11:49] prophet

[2:11:53] the lady had given crumbs
[2:11:57] she looked around the room and and she

[2:12:01] for say I can't tell you but I can tell
[2:12:02] you got all this I don't know what the
[2:12:04] and brother Branham left out one thing
[2:12:08] had it right looked around the room
[2:12:09] underneath the supernatural anointing
[2:12:11] one man's face is inside the plate
[2:12:16] can you imagine that most of y'all know
[2:12:18] y'all ain't trying to get your face
[2:12:19] dirty with food but this man's face is
[2:12:21] in a plate
[2:12:22] the noise is so great
[2:12:25] didn't care what he looked like might be
[2:12:28] walking out with spaghetti all over his
[2:12:29] face

[2:13:01] around

[2:13:04] that were not Christians and they were
[2:13:06] just sitting there giggling and playing
[2:13:07] in the anointing
[2:13:10] I love it because Mama's desire
[2:13:14] was greater than those boys
[2:13:18] and just by Mama making a request
[2:13:22] my mama said I want the salvation of my
[2:13:25] two boys

[2:13:29] eternal
[2:13:31] and God right there on the spot change

[2:13:41] church amen they want to serve God
[2:13:46] Hattie Wright gave crumbs God gave her

[2:14:09] Lord my children their life all messed
[2:14:12] up their life is crumbs
[2:14:15] but God if you can just do something
[2:14:17] with the crumbs
[2:14:19] and God I'm gonna tell you what I'm I'ma
[2:14:21] stop begging you for all these big
[2:14:22] things

[2:14:25] things but if you happen I'm not I'm not
[2:14:27] gonna make an idol out of you if you
[2:14:29] just give me
[2:14:32] a crop

[2:14:36] satisfy my need
[2:14:39] y ass

[2:15:18] that's the ministry that we're entering
[2:15:20] into we're way up the road now soon the
[2:15:23] coming of the Lord Jesus and we've got
[2:15:25] to have Rapture and faith in a church
[2:15:28] that can be changed in a moment in the
[2:15:30] twinkling of an eye
[2:15:32] to go out or will not go watch this but
[2:15:37] don't worry
[2:15:40] it'll be there
[2:15:42] that's a promise from God that faith
[2:15:45] that we're looking for to change our
[2:15:46] bodies sometimes we look Lord Amy I
[2:15:49] don't I don't even feel like I got faith

[2:16:02] having your key close to the car you're
[2:16:04] gonna push a button you expect it to
[2:16:06] start

[2:16:21] there and when the power
[2:16:23] of this church Rises it'll bring its
[2:16:26] Brethren the power of that church Rises
[2:16:29] will bring its Brethren the power of
[2:16:32] that church will bring the other
[2:16:33] Brethren then there'll be a general
[2:16:35] resurrection and we're looking forward
[2:16:38] to it I'm so glad I'm so glad that this
[2:16:42] faith that this woman displayed is the
[2:16:45] same Faith that's lying inside of all of
[2:16:47] us today don't you be moved by nothing
[2:16:50] the devil does
[2:16:53] don't you be moved by nothing a doctor

[2:17:25] is
[2:17:27] we need we can have it right now
[2:17:30] Lord I I
[2:17:32] just in the story Jesus he never prayed
[2:17:36] for this woman and I had some other
[2:17:38] quotes here to show her even that
[2:17:41] happened in brother Banner's Ministry
[2:17:42] people pass through the prayer line
[2:17:44] and uh they would never actually be
[2:17:47] prayed for he would just tell them this
[2:17:49] is what you came here for this is what
[2:17:51] you're looking for the the Holy Spirit
[2:17:52] Will discern what was happening in their
[2:17:55] life and they say you know go find it
[2:17:57] the way you believe it God bless you
[2:17:58] never lay hands on them never prayed for
[2:18:01] them it's just it was proven that that
[2:18:03] same God that that was in Bible times
[2:18:06] was here today
[2:18:08] and Lord I believe even right now Lord
[2:18:10] whatever the needs are here if there's
[2:18:12] any sick in our midst they can receive
[2:18:15] Lord this Supernatural crimes
[2:18:17] mine from the word of God that it would
[2:18:20] bring healing to their bodies as the uh
[2:18:23] Centurion he says just speak the word
[2:18:25] only my servant will be made oh the word
[2:18:28] has been spoken all we have to do is
[2:18:31] receive it
[2:18:32] God I pray father that you would help us
[2:18:35] to walk in this and Lord many of us have
[2:18:37] situations that are broken
[2:18:40] circumstances that are maybe in crumb
[2:18:43] conditions
[2:18:44] finances that are in crumb conditions
[2:18:46] our bodies and crumb conditions our
[2:18:49] relationships and crumb conditions but

[2:18:53] supernatural God you're able to change
[2:18:56] all those hopeless conditions
