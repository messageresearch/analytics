[52:00] shall be bound in heaven so whatever
[52:04] this condition is we might not know the
[52:06] name of it but whatever it is we find it
[52:09] now in the name of Jesus Christ and we
[52:15] loose your healing power to flow from
[52:19] the crown of a head to the soles of her
[52:21] feet and that she would be able to enjoy
[52:24] the remainder of this service you're the
[52:27] same God that touched Peters
[52:30] mother-in-law she was down with the flu
[52:32] in and got when you touched her you went
[52:35] into the house and touched her within
[52:36] the self-same hour she's back up doing
[52:38] the things that she normally did
[52:40] so Satan we come against you amen Lee
[52:43] and as a with the authority of sons and
[52:46] daughters of God we come against you and
[52:48] whatever attack this is we come against
[52:50] it in the name of the Lord Jesus and we
[52:53] declare her freedom even right now
[52:56] in Jesus name we pray amen amen
[53:01] [Music]
[53:04] hail and praise the Lord
[53:08] but we're just so grateful a man to God
[53:12] Amen on today for all that he's doing in
[53:17] our midst we just appreciate a man his
[53:23] spirit and I thank God for a precious
[53:27] brother and sister from Vancouver a man
[53:29] good to have you visited they've been
[53:32] with us on today a man always a blessing
[53:36] and we just just a quick a couple of
[53:42] things I need to take care of before we
[53:43] actually go into the word of the Lord on
[53:47] Friday night a couple of things happen
[53:50] for those that weren't here a man we
[53:54] just want to bring you up to speed but
[53:57] we had our annual a church feeding on
[54:00] Friday night and there were some things
[54:01] that were voted on that we want all the
[54:05] members to be aware of one of them Amen
[54:09] that we voted on was we voted on brother
[54:13] Troy becoming a deacon a man in our
[54:15] church and praise the Lord thank the
[54:20] Lord there was believe about 26 votes
[54:25] and 23 of them 26 voted for him to
[54:30] become Deaconess is what the church
[54:31] decided the other were either you know
[54:35] lower just no vote at all but about 23
[54:38] of the 26 which shows that it was a
[54:40] tremendous majority Amen that
[54:43] that it wanted that so we want to a man
[54:46] acknowledge that but we want to do
[54:49] things according to the scripture and I
[54:51] want to just turn your Bibles to the
[54:53] first Timothy chapter 3 a man I
[54:57] mentioned on on Friday night that we
[55:01] would just pray over him today but what
[55:04] we'll do is there's something here in
[55:06] Scripture that we need to do and we want
[55:08] to follow that first Timothy three says
[55:10] verse eight says likewise must the
[55:12] Deacons be grave not double tongue not
[55:15] given to much wine not greedy and filthy
[55:17] lucre now holding the mystery of the
[55:19] faith and a pure conscience and let
[55:22] these also first be proved alright so
[55:24] this is what the scripture tells us that
[55:26] they have to be proved my brother Troy
[55:27] has been a deacon and a couple other
[55:30] churches before the Lord called him to
[55:32] be a part of this ministry and we know
[55:34] that he served in that capacity but just
[55:37] based on Scripture based on some of the
[55:39] things that the Prophet teach what we
[55:40] want to do this is a new congregation a
[55:43] man that he's becoming deacon apart
[55:45] began to be a deacon and so we want to
[55:47] make sure we go through the process of
[55:49] proving and proving time is where he
[55:53] gets a chance to kind of know the people
[55:55] the people get a chance to know him and
[55:56] and then there comes a time where we
[55:59] kind of take him off for that where the
[56:00] church has the opportunity to vote on
[56:02] that but but we've entered into that
[56:04] phase of him proving himself as a deacon
[56:06] here spirit and truth tabernacle and
[56:08] we're doing that a man as of today just
[56:11] letting everybody know let these also
[56:13] first be proved let then let them use
[56:15] the office of a deacon being found
[56:16] blameless even so must their wives be
[56:19] grave not slanderers sober faithful all
[56:21] things that the deacon be the husband of
[56:24] one wife ruling their children in their
[56:26] own house as well for they that have
[56:28] used the office of a deacon well
[56:30] purchase to themselves at that degree
[56:31] and great boldness
[56:35] in the faith which is in Christ Jesus so
[56:37] again what we voted on and what the
[56:40] church voted on was to have brother Troy
[56:43] began to Amen serve here at spirit of
[56:47] truth Tabernacle was certainly happy
[56:48] amen to have him amen in that capacity
[56:51] he'll be going through a time of proving
[56:54] a manner that will bring it back around
[56:55] to the church to vote once the proving
[56:57] has has completed but as of today he'll
[57:00] certainly be acting Amen in that
[57:02] capacity Amen a deacon based on what the
[57:05] church's vote was from Friday night so I
[57:08] just want everybody to understand that
[57:10] and we understand that the deacon is a
[57:12] police village church one of the most
[57:14] strict offices in the church so if
[57:17] brother Troy is asking you know you to
[57:18] do something he's been given the
[57:20] authority by the church to ask you to do
[57:23] that so Amen we we certainly so grateful
[57:26] for that we had brother for the Robles
[57:28] here and and the Lord I put it in
[57:31] brother Oh blessed heart to relocate
[57:33] back to Dominican Republic and and as
[57:36] God was taking brother Robles out God
[57:38] was bringing you no other help in and
[57:40] we're so grateful for what the Lord has
[57:42] done so we just we just appreciate we
[57:44] appreciate that and we want you all to
[57:46] certainly be cooperative Amen with our
[57:48] precious brother a man also there was
[57:51] one other thing that was voted on and we
[57:56] need to just talk about that really
[57:57] quick we will prepare for offering a
[58:01] manna extra the Solomon not to do the
[58:03] offering I wanted to do that today
[58:05] itself on the on the table out there we
[58:09] have a couple of things we have this
[58:11] pledge forms and and then we also have
[58:15] this letter and that's on the table as
[58:19] you're going out one of the things that
[58:21] was voted on on Friday night we just
[58:25] kind of took the church through our
[58:28] financial picture showed them you know
[58:31] the money that's coming in the money is
[58:32] going out
[58:34] certainly grateful that God has allowed
[58:35] us to stay establish this ministry for
[58:38] another year and we're always happy
[58:41] every time God opens doors and makes
[58:43] ways for us we're happy for that but we
[58:46] just kind of cast vision that we we need
[58:49] to start making preparation to move into
[58:51] our own space not just keep renting you
[58:54] know year after year and all the money
[58:55] that we pay in rent but we want to move
[58:57] into our own space and be able to own it
[58:59] you know ourselves so we're moving into
[59:02] about 16 years of ministry now and we
[59:05] want to start making preparation for for
[59:07] something else so we voted on a one-year
[59:10] plan a three-year plan or a five-year
[59:12] plan and contributing you know towards
[59:15] our building fun we've talked about time
[59:17] and we talked about offering three
[59:19] levels of giving tithing offering and
[59:21] then building funds and and we got a we
[59:24] made a we voted on building fund and how
[59:27] much we said 35 people giving so much
[59:29] money a man over one year period three
[59:32] year period a five year period what you
[59:35] know we show what the numbers would be I
[59:36] think if if if 35 people I don't have my
[59:41] my notes here but I think it was a if we
[59:45] were trying to raise $300,000 and 35
[59:48] people gave $8,600 one time we would you
[59:51] know be over at about three hundred and
[59:53] one thousand I believe then we had a
[59:55] three year plan if you gave three
[59:58] thousand dollars per year for the next
[59:59] three years we have about three hundred
[1:00:02] and fifteen thousand of the same
[1:00:03] thirty-five people committed to three
[1:00:05] thousand dollars per year for the next
[1:00:06] three years then we had a five-year plan
[1:00:09] if thirty-five people commit to
[1:00:11] seventeen hundred and fifty dollars per
[1:00:13] year for the next five years then we
[1:00:15] would raise roughly three hundred and
[1:00:17] six thousand or something like that so
[1:00:19] we put that to a vote we had four people
[1:00:23] that wanted to do the $8,600 one time we
[1:00:27] had nine people that was a one-year plan
[1:00:29] for what four people voted for that nine
[1:00:32] people voted for the five-year plan and
[1:00:34] thirteen people voted for the three-year
[1:00:36] plan so the thirteen a man says thirteen
[1:00:40] you know more we have more people voting
[1:00:42] for that we
[1:00:42] greed as a church to enter into a
[1:00:44] three-year plan pledging $33,000 per
[1:00:48] year amen in order to move us towards
[1:00:50] ownership to give us money to put down
[1:00:53] and things of that nature so that is
[1:00:55] something that uh that we voted for and
[1:00:57] when I asked a man all the members to do
[1:00:59] just take one of these forms you'll have
[1:01:01] that on the outside I mean just there on
[1:01:04] the table make sure you take one of
[1:01:06] these forms sign your name to the pledge
[1:01:08] and now there might be some that say you
[1:01:10] know pastor I know we voted for that but
[1:01:12] I don't have that what I'm asking you to
[1:01:15] do is just make a commitment on
[1:01:16] everybody to be a part of this I know
[1:01:18] God gonna make a way I know God gonna do
[1:01:20] some things that we just never imagined
[1:01:22] but I think we all have to be a part of
[1:01:24] it somehow someway and you know the
[1:01:26] scripture says I put a script in there
[1:01:28] Isaiah 54 and - it says enlarge the
[1:01:31] place of that tent and let them stretch
[1:01:33] forth the curtains of their habitation
[1:01:35] spare not lengthen my cords and
[1:01:37] strengthen our states and and as we're
[1:01:40] moving into this season it will be a
[1:01:42] task it would be a challenge
[1:01:44] amen you know on us to give but I know
[1:01:47] that there's a blessing on the other
[1:01:48] side of the giving a man so I'm asking
[1:01:51] everyone somehow find a way just to get
[1:01:54] involved in this I know for sure we got
[1:01:57] 13 that say they want to give $3,000
[1:02:00] right and we and those that wanted to
[1:02:02] give you know just one year if you I
[1:02:05] mean really what it ends up 3,000
[1:02:07] dollars per year for three years equals
[1:02:09] a $9,000 pledge so if you want to say I
[1:02:11] want to give my 9,000 right now you can
[1:02:13] do that right now
[1:02:14] right that's totally that's totally
[1:02:16] after you but we want everybody to try
[1:02:19] to meet what the church voted on but if
[1:02:21] you can't do that please just do the
[1:02:24] best you can but make sure it's
[1:02:26] stretching yeah but don't take your bill
[1:02:28] money now don't take your bill money and
[1:02:30] do that these are things that uh you
[1:02:33] know you have to start praying acts and
[1:02:34] God just to bless you to be able to be
[1:02:36] able to do that and I'm sure he'll make
[1:02:38] a way
[1:02:39] man if you desire to do that so we're
[1:02:41] asking everyone all the members of the
[1:02:42] church to do that now that's that's one
[1:02:45] side this is the the church form a man
[1:02:48] for the members of the church but you
[1:02:50] know I didn't know that the vote would
[1:02:52] actually happen and go that way where
[1:02:54] everybody would do the three-year plan
[1:02:55] but I written this letter before the
[1:02:58] meeting a man and this is a letter
[1:03:01] you'll have it you can take some and
[1:03:03] just give it out to different people but
[1:03:04] on the letter as you would read it
[1:03:06] you'll see that the Lord put in my
[1:03:08] spirit just to ask people to join us
[1:03:10] with a three thousand dollar pledge
[1:03:12] towards our building fund and I had no
[1:03:14] idea that that was gonna be the one
[1:03:16] selected so I believe God was
[1:03:18] vindicating a man that that's what he
[1:03:20] wanted us to do and so these forms are
[1:03:23] just for friends and family people that
[1:03:25] you think a man that would be able to
[1:03:27] just help us raise the money that we
[1:03:29] want to raise in order to move towards
[1:03:32] on the ship so please take some and when
[1:03:35] we run out we'll put some more out there
[1:03:36] but try to find that but but the other
[1:03:38] thing is don't don't take this and find
[1:03:40] a bunch of people to give but you
[1:03:42] yourself don't give don't do it that way
[1:03:44] you have to be a part of this aid man I
[1:03:47] believe that's where you're gonna get
[1:03:48] your blessing when you actually enter in
[1:03:50] so some of you have your forms a man
[1:03:52] today and we want to actually the
[1:03:54] brothers that come we're gonna take this
[1:03:56] morning times and often if you do just
[1:03:57] fold your form up put it inside the
[1:03:59] offering and then those that did not get
[1:04:01] it just make sure you get one a man
[1:04:03] before you leave today and and put that
[1:04:06] amen either in the offering or in the
[1:04:08] basket there it's a man praising one
[1:04:11] let's just pray over this man before we
[1:04:20] before we partake of the offering father
[1:04:26] we are just coming in the name of Jesus
[1:04:30] thank you Lord for the church coming
[1:04:36] together in and God just voting on on
[1:04:40] how we want to move towards ownership
[1:04:42] the Lord I know it'll be a stretch for
[1:04:44] many of us but God I know that if you've
[1:04:48] placed us for force and somehow you'll
[1:04:50] make a way you open up doors that we
[1:04:52] can't see and you'll provide you are
[1:04:55] Jehovah Jireh we've seen you do it many
[1:04:58] times before so we know that you're
[1:05:00] capable of doing it all over again my
[1:05:03] prayer is that everyone that would take
[1:05:07] the forms and that they would sign them
[1:05:09] God my prayer is that you would open
[1:05:12] doors to it make ways for them to
[1:05:15] fulfill the pledge that they have Lord
[1:05:19] used us for your glory use this for your
[1:05:23] honor we trust lorda to return back to
[1:05:27] the people a hundredfold as they give
[1:05:30] from their hearts today Jesus name we
[1:05:33] pray amen

[1:08:14] I read this on Friday night and I just
[1:08:17] wanted to read it over the church I
[1:08:19] should have did this at the first of the
[1:08:22] year but since we're still in the first
[1:08:23] month I read this over you this was
[1:08:27] something the Prophet said in Revelation
[1:08:30] chapter 4 just 1966 so so Harmon is glad
[1:08:34] and happy the Lord spared you through
[1:08:37] another year and then here we are coming
[1:08:39] up to the end of the road and pray that
[1:08:41] God will forgive us of all of our sins
[1:08:43] and our shortcomings now I want to say

[1:09:17] this we're asking God's blessings upon
[1:09:20] each and every one that got what bless
[1:09:23] you in such a way that you've never even
[1:09:24] imagined and and I pray that you'll

[1:09:28] received that last year and I saw God do
[1:09:30] more for you last year than ever been
[1:09:32] done before but he's giving a ticket to
[1:09:34] another level
[1:09:35] and I believe that with all my heart so
[1:09:37] god bless your church thank you so much
[1:09:39] amen for all you have done to make

[1:10:14] we could just stand to our feet we'll

[1:10:17] into our thought for today a man to
[1:10:20] praise the name of the Lord I want to
[1:10:23] turn to the book of James again we were
[1:10:25] here last week and we want to just go
[1:10:28] forward in our thought unwanted
[1:10:34] circumstances a man unwanted
[1:10:38] circumstances so here in James

[1:10:46] James chapter 1 verse 2 this is my
[1:10:51] brother encountered all joy when you
[1:10:53] fall into divers temptations just many
[1:10:57] tests and trials and my god and and and
[1:11:02] if I were completely honest after
[1:11:05] preaching the sermon last week man we
[1:11:08] failed in too many tests and trials but

[1:11:13] just keep smiling right just keep
[1:11:17] smiling don't even don't even pay it no
[1:11:19] tension just just keep smiling right so

[1:11:22] fall into into divers temptations
[1:11:25] knowing this that the trying of your
[1:11:27] faith worketh patience but let patience
[1:11:31] have a perfect work that you may be
[1:11:32] perfect and entire wanting nothing if

[1:11:38] that giveth to all men liberally and
[1:11:40] upbraideth not and it shall be given him
[1:11:44] but let him ask in faith nothing
[1:11:48] wavering for he that waiteth is like a
[1:11:51] wave of the sea driven with the wind and
[1:11:54] tossed you're not gonna make it very far
[1:11:57] if you're wavering and God right you
[1:12:00] have to be establish fixed establish for
[1:12:02] permanency right it says for for let not

[1:12:07] anything of the Lord a double minded man

[1:12:32] you through your word is in Jesus name
[1:12:34] we pray amen
[1:12:35] god bless you could be seated amen so
[1:12:43] again our our title today is unwarranted
[1:12:47] circumstances unwarranted circumstances
[1:12:50] I would like to just kind of start with
[1:12:53] a quote here at the mighty Conqueror you
[1:12:56] know in everybody everybody's life you
[1:12:59] have these what we call unwanted
[1:13:01] circumstances there are things that
[1:13:03] happen to you and notice the title says
[1:13:05] circumstance tense not circumstance
[1:13:09] right because you'll go from one trial
[1:13:11] to the next trial a man you go from one
[1:13:14] distress to the next distress but in the
[1:13:17] midst of that God is actually
[1:13:18] strengthening you God is goddess goddess
[1:13:21] preparing you actually for the next
[1:13:22] thing that you're about to face a man is
[1:13:25] it's bringing you to a place of
[1:13:26] perfection in him glory to God so we
[1:13:29] don't we don't run from our trials it's
[1:13:31] like David David didn't run from Goliath
[1:13:33] he actually went to face Goliath a man
[1:13:36] so whatever whatever situation is
[1:13:38] actually coming your way understand the
[1:13:40] first thing that you need to understand
[1:13:42] is God will never give you more than you
[1:13:44] can bear
[1:13:44] a man he'll never put more on you than
[1:13:47] you can bear so you have to you have to
[1:13:48] face it with joy and and I love the way
[1:13:51] James puts that because brother branham
[1:13:53] even tells us the right mental attitude
[1:13:55] right towards any divine promise will
[1:13:58] bring the thing to pass so before you
[1:14:00] even get started a trial you
[1:14:02] gotta have the right attitude in the
[1:14:03] midst of it glory to God don't I mean
[1:14:06] when you're going through nobody should
[1:14:08] be able to know Amen now some things
[1:14:11] people it's just gotta be known like if
[1:14:14] you lose a loved one or something like
[1:14:15] that those things are gonna be known and
[1:14:16] people understand that but but there's
[1:14:18] other little things they man that
[1:14:20] happened in our life nobody should be
[1:14:22] able to tell that you had a bad day on
[1:14:23] the job
[1:14:25] come on church right even if you lost
[1:14:28] your job the Bible say bless the Lord at
[1:14:30] all times right even if you lost your
[1:14:33] job you got to learn how to praise God
[1:14:35] in the midst of losing your job thanking
[1:14:37] him for the next job that is get rid or
[1:14:39] take you into a mess but don't come to
[1:14:42] church with a sad face you know you
[1:14:44] cannot come into the presence of a king
[1:14:47] with the sad face
[1:14:49] did you know that was Scripture right
[1:14:53] Amen I'm here mind if they could not go
[1:14:55] into the presence of the king with a sad
[1:14:57] countenance and when you coming into the
[1:15:00] presence of the King of Kings you can't
[1:15:02] have that sad countenance you change the
[1:15:05] atmosphere within the kingdom when you
[1:15:07] come like that so you gotta come with
[1:15:09] joy and see joy is different from
[1:15:14] happiness happiness occurs because
[1:15:17] something happened but joy is there when
[1:15:21] nothing happens
[1:15:23] I got joy in the good times I got joy in
[1:15:26] the bad time
[1:15:27] I got joy at all times that's the way
[1:15:31] you act when you a question when you got
[1:15:35] a revelation of who you are in Christ
[1:15:38] amen come on church lorry to God I was
[1:15:41] blessed you know this week we had that I
[1:15:45] heard brother solomon sharing testimony
[1:15:46] but we had that the brothers text going
[1:15:49] back and forth an brothers brother Silas
[1:15:50] sent out you know the devil tacking me
[1:15:52] with laryngitis or something like that
[1:15:54] and within about five minutes the
[1:15:56] brothers had done bronchitis that the
[1:15:59] bronchi landed within about five minutes
[1:16:01] the Devils on the run right I mean you
[1:16:04] know them brother the brothers fight
[1:16:05] back with encouraging words and all kind
[1:16:08] of things like that brother next thing
[1:16:09] you know brother some say I'm healed in
[1:16:10] Jesus name the whole thing changed just
[1:16:13] like that
[1:16:15] when you're going through is your
[1:16:17] attitude in the midst of it you know
[1:16:18] there's some you know some people when
[1:16:20] they're going through and they they let
[1:16:21] people know they want the pity party you
[1:16:26] enjoy a pity party you I mean people
[1:16:28] enjoy just talking about negative stuff
[1:16:30] they enjoy that right but but you got to
[1:16:33] be a personal no no I don't want to be
[1:16:34] around nobody's gonna talk negative
[1:16:36] because you know that that type of stuff
[1:16:37] is contagious right you need somebody's
[1:16:40] gonna talk to work gonna talk faith a
[1:16:42] man sometimes gonna help elevate you not
[1:16:44] bring you down praise the Lord
[1:16:46] so we're talking about this I'm one of
[1:16:48] circumstances we all have them a man we
[1:16:50] all we all have them I was you know
[1:16:53] before I hit this this quote if every
[1:16:57] parent in here a man with with children
[1:17:00] you have experienced a man laboring over
[1:17:04] the stove a man preparing a really nice
[1:17:07] meal and you know and modest the best
[1:17:10] broccoli you ever cooked in all your
[1:17:12] life hallelujah and and you know you lay
[1:17:16] that down on the plate and you know and
[1:17:19] I mean you just eaten and you just
[1:17:21] enjoying it
[1:17:21] but all of sudden that kid look at
[1:17:23] something green on the plate and and
[1:17:25] they they begin to frown up they begin
[1:17:26] to look a little different you know at
[1:17:28] that and and and and those those words
[1:17:30] that come out of their mouth that just
[1:17:32] hurt every parent is and after you done
[1:17:35] did everything you could to feed them
[1:17:37] and you get I don't want it right when
[1:17:40] you hear that I don't want it a man that
[1:17:43] that's the kid is saying that they've
[1:17:45] great they got something on their plate
[1:17:46] that's unwanted it's an unwanted
[1:17:48] circumstance with them I'll take the
[1:17:51] fries right and I'll take all the stuff
[1:17:54] that's bad for me but but that green
[1:17:56] stuff I don't want it it's unwanted to
[1:17:59] them right amen but but the green stuff
[1:18:01] is what's really good for them and
[1:18:04] sometimes in life we get some some green
[1:18:07] stuff some trials and tribulations some
[1:18:10] distress it but that's the good stuff
[1:18:12] for you you can't tell the Lord I don't
[1:18:14] want that no that's good for you
[1:18:18] see the Prophet talked about you know
[1:18:21] his his his his mama giving him castor
[1:18:23] oil you know y'all remember that and say
[1:18:27] you know he would get that that caste or
[1:18:29] and say he say you know it was just it
[1:18:31] was just so hard to take that he say he
[1:18:34] want he wanted to tell Mama's just gonna
[1:18:35] make me it's gonna make me gag mama I
[1:18:38] can't take that it then he say the
[1:18:39] Castro actually make me sick when I take
[1:18:42] the castor oil I get worse mama but if
[1:18:45] I'm gonna say anything that don't make
[1:18:47] you sick it won't do you no good
[1:18:50] [Music]
[1:18:51] hallelujah so anything sometimes your
[1:18:54] trials come and they make you sick but
[1:18:57] when you get sick it calls you to pray a
[1:18:59] little bit more it make you want to come
[1:19:02] to church and hear the word of God
[1:19:03] that's what happened when you get sick
[1:19:06] but Amen I want you to get sin sick
[1:19:10] Halloween or somebody Amen and God uses
[1:19:14] our trials to try you to a place where
[1:19:17] you'll serve him think man we just love
[1:19:20] the Lord so your trial you're looking at
[1:19:23] just you know remember as we mentioned
[1:19:25] last week you looking at it
[1:19:27] Amen that's that's just angry clouds but
[1:19:30] it's not angry Klaus it's angel's wings
[1:19:32] beating together it's not angry clouds
[1:19:35] this angel's wings that are beating
[1:19:36] together now look at this of what the
[1:19:38] Prophet said in the mighty Conqueror it
[1:19:41] says this and after Constantine come
[1:19:44] over and liberated them from under the
[1:19:46] Roman persecution and United the church
[1:19:48] and state together there's where we got
[1:19:52] Catholic to begin with and we and when
[1:19:54] they did the church lost more grounds in
[1:19:56] 10 years then it had gained all through
[1:20:00] the persecution he says if there is
[1:20:02] anything that makes Christians lazy it's
[1:20:08] when they're on a flowery flowered bed
[1:20:11] of ease you all know when people start
[1:20:15] giving up and quitting church when they
[1:20:18] get some money in their pocket when they
[1:20:22] get it when they you know you know my we
[1:20:24] couldn't we they was calling everybody
[1:20:26] trying to get the church when they
[1:20:27] didn't have a ride but as soon as God
[1:20:30] with a car they forgot about coming to
[1:20:34] church if there's anything that makes a
[1:20:39] Christian lazy it's when they're on a
[1:20:42] flowered bed of ease listen we don't
[1:20:47] have it persecution enough now your
[1:20:50] brother said now I'm going through
[1:20:51] enough as it is they say you don't even
[1:20:53] have it bad enough yet
[1:20:55] vodka say we don't we don't have it
[1:20:57] persecution of we don't have that hard
[1:20:59] enough always at the chain is the
[1:21:02] strongest at its weakest link he says
[1:21:05] that a man under pressure is what he is
[1:21:07] when he's under pressure so oftentimes
[1:21:09] you go through these trials God putting
[1:21:11] you under pressure we've seen what you
[1:21:12] really made a man I'm too precious what
[1:21:15] he is under pressure his real true
[1:21:17] characteristics will show when he some
[1:21:20] depression get him all riled up then
[1:21:23] you'll see the real man come out if he's
[1:21:26] got a temper it'll show itself if he's
[1:21:30] meek and gentle it'll show itself
[1:21:33] put him under pressure once and God puts
[1:21:36] all his children I like that statement
[1:21:38] not just some of his children I need you
[1:21:41] to understand if you not going through
[1:21:42] anything right now give it a little time
[1:21:44] you will be going through something see
[1:21:47] every son that comes to God must be
[1:21:49] tried glory to God don't run from the
[1:21:52] trials a man listened said God puts all
[1:21:55] the student under test to see whether
[1:21:56] they're there any flaws in them and I
[1:21:58] just want to say I want to say this
[1:21:59] don't run from you no distress I know
[1:22:02] you know sometimes people people tell
[1:22:04] others when they um you know they want
[1:22:06] to think about being a Christian man
[1:22:07] it's not it's not easy being a Christian
[1:22:09] it's not easy it's gonna be hard and you
[1:22:12] know and they hear that me thinking a
[1:22:14] lot if it's gonna be hard you know maybe
[1:22:16] I'll just stay where I'm at no no no you
[1:22:18] misunderstand it you mistime stem it's
[1:22:20] hard for everybody
[1:22:22] listen even without Christ people have
[1:22:24] frowns without price they have trials
[1:22:28] you know but I rather face but I'm
[1:22:30] facing with Christ then without Christ
[1:22:33] because at the end of it all even if I
[1:22:35] have to face death I want to face death
[1:22:38] with Christ not without Christ because I
[1:22:41] the end of all I'm like I
[1:22:42] certain promises that lay on the other
[1:22:44] side of death right so I mean it's gonna
[1:22:48] be trials no matter what but you know
[1:22:49] what I choose it I'm I'm going to suffer
[1:22:52] the affliction with the people of God
[1:22:54] than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
[1:22:57] season praise the Lord Amen but
[1:22:59] Christians if you want to get lazy be on
[1:23:03] a flower bed of ease that's why God is
[1:23:05] gaga grbac gonna answer them kind of
[1:23:08] fresh they've kind of prayers that sets
[1:23:09] you up real good and stop you from
[1:23:11] praying you know what I'm saying
[1:23:15] the ones that stop you from praying God
[1:23:16] answering them he got he just give you a
[1:23:18] little bit out of time get you out of
[1:23:20] this and then you got to get back on
[1:23:22] your knees and then he'll get you out of
[1:23:24] this and then you got to get back on
[1:23:25] your knees and then he'll get you
[1:23:26] he's gonna keep hearing you otherwise
[1:23:28] you'll stop talking to them he got to
[1:23:33] keep you in church and the way to get
[1:23:35] you that just a little pressure oh you
[1:23:39] don't understand when you have the
[1:23:41] pressure what brother branham Kota is
[1:23:43] the tender hand of Jehovah it's actually
[1:23:46] moving you right to where he wanted you
[1:23:48] all the time
[1:23:49] the pressure is used to do that so count
[1:23:54] it all joy all right let's go on here's
[1:23:57] here's one thing I won't read this out
[1:23:59] of Exodus 112 just read this with me
[1:24:02] because the children of Israel were
[1:24:03] actually put under pressure when they
[1:24:06] were inside of Israel they're before you
[1:24:10] know they got that before they reached
[1:24:11] their point of deliverance amen they
[1:24:13] were they were placed under pressure
[1:24:15] Moses had come back in and man when they
[1:24:18] first heard that Moses was there the
[1:24:20] children of Israel the Bible say they
[1:24:21] believed and they just begin to worship
[1:24:23] because they knew God has sent them a
[1:24:25] prophet I love that at one time they
[1:24:30] believed that God sent them a prophet
[1:24:32] and they worshipped but later on because
[1:24:35] of some of the unwanted circumstances of
[1:24:37] the wilderness they start complaining
[1:24:39] about the Prophet amen
[1:24:42] don't let your componet your
[1:24:44] circumstances change your faith
[1:24:48] hallelujah can I say that again
[1:24:51] don't let your circumstances change your
[1:24:54] faith but let your faith change your
[1:24:58] circumstance
[1:25:02] hallelujah somebody glory to God but
[1:25:06] because of the unwanted circumstances of
[1:25:09] the wilderness their faith changed and
[1:25:12] they begin to complain against God's
[1:25:14] prophet but there was a time in Exodus 4
[1:25:17] it said that they believed that God sent
[1:25:21] them a prophet and not only did they
[1:25:23] believe they begin the worship God and
[1:25:25] thank God for sending them a prophet but
[1:25:28] they aren't wanted circumstances is what
[1:25:30] change what's wait them don't let that
[1:25:33] be a situation I remember I remember
[1:25:35] Jeremiah had a circumstance I'm coming
[1:25:38] to this in a second but Jeremiah because
[1:25:40] he had testified him because he
[1:25:41] prophesied one time you know the king
[1:25:44] said now I'm gonna give you a chance to
[1:25:45] kind of take that back you say no I
[1:25:46] can't God told me saying I'm gonna say
[1:25:48] okay we have to let you down inside this
[1:25:50] pit and they put him pitting and
[1:25:52] Jeremiah begin to sink in the muck and
[1:25:54] the mire he just began and they were
[1:25:56] starving them to death and just it's
[1:25:58] just a terrible situation but but before
[1:26:00] you know it there was a man called
[1:26:01] Abimelech that come along again and got
[1:26:03] some old ropes and put them down there
[1:26:04] and gave it to Jeremiah to lift the life
[1:26:06] out of that situation and after you come
[1:26:08] out they say are you gonna change your
[1:26:09] testimony no I'm gonna keep saying
[1:26:11] exactly what God told me to say he did
[1:26:13] not let his trial change his testimony
[1:26:16] and that's the way you got to be as a
[1:26:18] Christian don't let whatever you're
[1:26:20] going through don't let it change your
[1:26:21] testimony look at what happened with the
[1:26:23] children of Israel and Exodus 1:12 look
[1:26:26] at this they were they the Bible says
[1:26:27] but the more they afflicted them the
[1:26:30] more they multiplied and grew what I'm
[1:26:34] trying to get to this is that no matter
[1:26:35] so so when the devil sends the great
[1:26:37] trial upon you it's a great blessing on
[1:26:39] the other side of it the more I am
[1:26:41] afflicted the more I'm gonna multiply Oh
[1:26:45] hallelujah
[1:26:47] the more you attack my finances the more
[1:26:50] God gonna bless me ha the more you
[1:26:53] attack my body amen the more health I'm
[1:26:56] gonna receive amen
[1:26:58] whatever you do Satan God gonna do more
[1:27:03] it says but the more they afflicted them
[1:27:05] the more they multiplied and grew and
[1:27:08] they were grieved because of the
[1:27:10] children of Israel but the more they
[1:27:13] afflicted them amen they were agree
[1:27:18] because of two misery so I wanted to
[1:27:19] just get that the more that you
[1:27:21] afflicted the more you're gonna prosper
[1:27:24] all those unwanted circumstances just
[1:27:27] gonna produce a blessing in your life
[1:27:29] hallelujah
[1:27:31] III mean some of y'all can look back
[1:27:33] even now and look at you know just many
[1:27:35] of the things that you suffered through
[1:27:37] things that you suffered through church
[1:27:39] things that you suffered through
[1:27:41] financially things that you suffered
[1:27:43] through physically but God has brought
[1:27:45] you out into a wealthy place that's the
[1:27:49] way God does us God God does not give us
[1:27:52] something to make us a man decrease but
[1:27:54] it's actually to increase
[1:27:56] oh I'm just I'm just so grateful listen
[1:27:59] to this amen
[1:28:02] let's read another quote here this is
[1:28:04] out of the message of the resurrection
[1:28:06] of Lazarus the Prophet says this Lazarus
[1:28:09] took sick theologians believe he died
[1:28:12] with hemorrhages of the lungs that I
[1:28:14] don't know that the Bible don't say
[1:28:16] nothing some of the writer said it was
[1:28:18] all right he got sick and sometimes God
[1:28:20] tries your faith do you believe that
[1:28:22] ever every son that come coming to come
[1:28:26] up to God must be trying kit not strange
[1:28:29] that fiery trials come because it's only
[1:28:32] done to perfect your faith to draw you
[1:28:35] closer though they're worth more than
[1:28:38] the than gold to you your trial is worth
[1:28:42] more than gold to you oh I love that if
[1:28:47] you got all these people on the side of
[1:28:49] the road talk about we buy gold but how
[1:28:54] many would stand out there with the
[1:28:55] science that we want more trials the
[1:28:58] trials are actually worth more than gold
[1:29:00] to you let think about it it says so
[1:29:05] they're worth more than gold to you
[1:29:06] alright then when these things begin to
[1:29:08] take place Mary Martha
[1:29:09] and said have Jesus coming come come
[1:29:12] back and pray for him and Jesus just
[1:29:14] ignored their call he went to another
[1:29:15] city further away well then they sent
[1:29:18] again and he still ignored their call
[1:29:20] sometimes you would go through prayer a
[1:29:22] man and just believing that the Lord gum
[1:29:26] just kind of make a wave real quick for
[1:29:27] you and I hate to say this
[1:29:29] we just we in this microwave age
[1:29:32] mentality that we say a prayer and as
[1:29:35] soon as we say the prayer we want an
[1:29:37] answer no it's not going to work that
[1:29:38] where you got the weight on that answer
[1:29:40] sometimes you got to wait years but as a
[1:29:43] Christian you got to continue to
[1:29:44] maintain your testimony in the midst of
[1:29:47] your waiting look at this just read this
[1:29:51] scripture out of Luke 23 verse 39
[1:29:54] through 43 look at this Luke 23 verse 39
[1:29:57] and one of the male factors which were
[1:29:59] which were hanged railed on him saying
[1:30:03] if thou be Christ save thyself enough
[1:30:05] verse 40 Luke 23 but the others but the
[1:30:08] other answering rebuked him saying does
[1:30:10] not thou fear God seeing thou art in the
[1:30:13] same condemnation and we indeed justly
[1:30:17] for we receive the due reward for our
[1:30:20] deeds but this man hath done nothing
[1:30:23] amiss and I want to I want to dwell
[1:30:27] there for a little bit you know let me
[1:30:28] just finish read this but I want to come
[1:30:30] back that statement this man has done
[1:30:31] nothing to miss first 42 says and he
[1:30:34] said unto Jesus Lord remember me when
[1:30:36] thou comest into thy kingdom and Jesus
[1:30:37] said in him very last entity today thou
[1:30:40] shalt be with me in paradise
[1:30:42] now verse 41 says that we receive the
[1:30:45] due reward for our deaths but this man
[1:30:47] have done nothing amiss here this
[1:30:49] justice this up thief on the cross is
[1:30:51] actually standing up for the Lord Jesus
[1:30:53] and he makes a statement saying it
[1:30:55] didn't do nothing wrong Jesus never did
[1:30:57] anything wrong
[1:30:59] but yet he was suffering oh my god I
[1:31:02] want you to get this you gonna go
[1:31:04] through some things in life where you
[1:31:05] actually did nothing wrong but yet
[1:31:09] you're still suffering now that does not
[1:31:11] mean that God does not love you right
[1:31:14] that don't mean that God doesn't love
[1:31:16] you cut I mean you gotta have the same
[1:31:17] type of faith that that that charm
[1:31:20] we knew he's done nothing wrong but yet
[1:31:23] he was suffering Joe said though he slay
[1:31:26] me yet will I trust him well I might be
[1:31:31] going through but I'm not giving up on
[1:31:33] God I am NOT throwing in the towel I am
[1:31:36] not quitting I'm still gonna be in
[1:31:39] church though he slay me yet will I
[1:31:43] trust him say though the skin words eat
[1:31:47] up my flesh you say yeah in my flesh I
[1:31:50] know I shall see God
[1:31:53] I feel by myself is not another you
[1:31:55] gotta have a revelation in the midst of
[1:31:58] your trial of the god that's dwell on
[1:32:00] the inside that try with you and greater
[1:32:02] is He that is in you than he that's in
[1:32:04] the midst of that trial look at this
[1:32:07] Jesus was rejected of his own he did
[1:32:10] nothing wrong he did nothing amiss he
[1:32:12] was rejected of his own he was lying
[1:32:13] upon by false witnesses he prayed that
[1:32:16] God was allowed a bitter cup to pass so
[1:32:18] many of us have been in that same
[1:32:19] situation when we pray that God to just
[1:32:21] let this thing pass Jesus was crucified
[1:32:23] on the capital punishment and died the
[1:32:26] most cruel death amen
[1:32:28] with those nails in his hands and in his
[1:32:31] feet the most cruel death that any
[1:32:33] person could die and he never did
[1:32:35] anything wrong but he's also raised on
[1:32:38] the third day in power and he sits on
[1:32:39] the right hand of the Father right now
[1:32:41] you know and and and brother Branham
[1:32:43] said he got raised so high that he has
[1:32:44] to look down now this is the very earth
[1:32:46] that would not receive him not he
[1:32:47] looking down on that earth right Church
[1:32:50] I'll tell you what when God uses a man
[1:32:53] these trials to exalt us don't run from
[1:32:56] it count it all joy counted all joy
[1:33:00] hallelujah hallelujah I told you how
[1:33:03] Joseph went through so much but
[1:33:05] everything he was going through God was
[1:33:06] exalting him he couldn't see the
[1:33:09] exaltations he couldn't see what God had
[1:33:11] in the end but but God had things
[1:33:13] prepared for Joseph you got to
[1:33:15] understand God got something prepared
[1:33:16] for you so don't don't run from the
[1:33:19] trial run to the trial listen I was
[1:33:25] thinking on another person that has some
[1:33:26] unwanted circumstances in their life
[1:33:29] Esther man she has some unwanted
[1:33:31] circumstance
[1:33:32] I mean just my god she would not that
[1:33:36] nobody would choose their trials you
[1:33:39] know we often times a man we see what
[1:33:43] there's a story that this man you know
[1:33:45] that this man had a cross that he was
[1:33:47] carrying and as he was carrying the
[1:33:50] cross he got the complaint said Lord
[1:33:52] this cross was just way too big I can't
[1:33:53] carry this cross Lord I came to it I
[1:33:55] can't do it
[1:33:56] so what's it look at tell you what bring
[1:33:58] your cross and and put it in this room
[1:34:00] sit but now everybody got to have a
[1:34:02] cross to bear
[1:34:03] everybody got got a care across it say
[1:34:05] okay no problem or but I I just I just
[1:34:07] can't carry this and say okay no just be
[1:34:09] put in this room come in and still put
[1:34:10] in this room and then I want you to walk
[1:34:12] out the door and then come into this
[1:34:13] other room and you find yourself across
[1:34:15] the net I picked up and there it say
[1:34:17] okay what I'll do it so he looked over
[1:34:18] say and he saw some huge cross say oh
[1:34:20] look at that constant man I don't know
[1:34:23] how anybody can carry that that's right
[1:34:25] no no no I ain't gonna take that one no
[1:34:27] they ain't taking that with me that's a
[1:34:28] pretty good man that's that's pretty bad
[1:34:30] so he started eating meat across in the
[1:34:32] corner he say yes Lord I found me a
[1:34:35] cross and when it got the cross picked
[1:34:37] it up he said Lord I got one Lord you
[1:34:39] say we got a care one I got one he said
[1:34:41] yes and that's the very one you just put
[1:34:42] down God knows exactly what you can bear
[1:34:48] hallelujah stop complaining and start
[1:34:51] praising look at this Esther once one of
[1:34:59] the unwanted circumstances that she lost
[1:35:01] both of her parents at a very early age
[1:35:03] and and and and when something like that
[1:35:06] happens it's very easy for a person to
[1:35:08] get themselves in a man just in a spirit
[1:35:12] of depression right Amen it's very easy
[1:35:16] to get get down on yourself and why did
[1:35:18] this happen to me and you get that why
[1:35:20] me spirit it's the unwanted circumstance
[1:35:22] that's all it is right you know but God
[1:35:24] had purpose went went when Esther a man
[1:35:27] got got lost both her parents then it
[1:35:29] forced her to be raised by her uncle
[1:35:31] Mordecai hallelujah
[1:35:33] now you might you know when I look at
[1:35:35] that God there might have been certain
[1:35:37] standards in Mordecai's house
[1:35:39] that might not have been in her parents
[1:35:43] house in order to get asked the way he
[1:35:48] wanted s to the P he had to make a
[1:35:51] certain way put up under a certain roof
[1:35:54] to bring certain qualities out of ha oh
[1:35:58] my god
[1:36:00] you don't realize that sometimes God
[1:36:02] does things in your life in order to get
[1:36:04] the best out of you he does that it's an
[1:36:10] unwonted circumstance but you gotta know
[1:36:12] that God is in control he put her in an
[1:36:16] uncle Mordecai Skinner and you know and
[1:36:19] I don't know maybe Mordecai was a pretty
[1:36:21] strict fella and when King a hat service
[1:36:26] had an unwanted circumstance right it
[1:36:29] may his I want a circumstance that he
[1:36:31] wanted his wife Queen Vashti become a
[1:36:34] man and show her beauty off to all all
[1:36:36] of his guests and now he was just so
[1:36:38] proud of his wife right and when he
[1:36:41] called for that you say I'm coming no
[1:36:43] way I got my own party going over here
[1:36:45] ain't coming nowhere and he say uh-huh
[1:36:49] I'm the King say what we didn't know
[1:36:52] what to do with vastra so somebody comes
[1:36:54] in and I look King I'm gonna tell you
[1:36:55] you got the kind of get rid of her and
[1:36:57] get yourself another Queen because if
[1:36:59] everybody sees how - she just did you
[1:37:02] all the other ladies in the kingdom
[1:37:03] gonna do the same thing to their
[1:37:05] husbands they say we're we're gonna have
[1:37:07] to bring out to take care of this and
[1:37:08] and this unwanted circumstance in and
[1:37:11] King a hasret's life created an
[1:37:13] opportunity it was a blessing in
[1:37:19] disguise meant for Esther oh my god so
[1:37:24] here comes after long and you know but
[1:37:27] but Esther being raised in Mordecai's
[1:37:29] house he has some very strict standards
[1:37:32] in how you know maybe she couldn't go
[1:37:35] out like the other girls come on
[1:37:38] somebody I got to work with me today no
[1:37:41] you ain't gonna take that boy you ain't
[1:37:44] gonna go out
[1:37:46] run around like the other girl she's
[1:37:48] gonna stay right here in the house and
[1:37:53] she knows maybe she thought that man my
[1:37:55] mama okay just so tight my uncle's so
[1:38:00] hot
[1:38:01] come on somebody my father my uncle was
[1:38:07] preparing ha and she had no idea what
[1:38:12] she'll be but therefore circumstances
[1:38:18] produced the Queen I wanted
[1:38:26] circumstances produced great this here
[1:38:32] Mordecai maybe he'll and the law down so
[1:38:35] you know you ain't gonna do this and you
[1:38:36] can't do that and you can't do this and
[1:38:38] you can't do that
[1:38:39] but then when it come time for hasturs
[1:38:42] to have it I'm one of circumstances that
[1:38:43] connected and now they looking for a new
[1:38:47] queen but this Queen had to have certain
[1:38:50] qualifications that they meant see has
[1:38:53] she been allowed to run around she might
[1:38:57] not have met the qualifications but
[1:39:00] because I um could kept her so tight and
[1:39:03] then he had that he had the release of
[1:39:06] one day so now now look mister Enoch is
[1:39:08] is they they wanna they want to see all
[1:39:09] the virgins in the land oh my god and
[1:39:13] night-night now maybe in the land that
[1:39:15] might not have been that many virgins
[1:39:17] the Bible don't tell us how many it was
[1:39:19] right so it might not have been that
[1:39:21] many virgins but here she come up
[1:39:22] because of underneath her uncle's care
[1:39:24] she was kept now she's a virgin and and
[1:39:28] when they're looking for it they lookin
[1:39:29] front they looking at a version of land
[1:39:30] here she comes out this this beautiful
[1:39:32] young lady and maybe it may be her uncle
[1:39:35] also had rules that you can't wear
[1:39:37] makeup you can wear this you can't wear
[1:39:43] that and you can't do this and he came
[1:39:45] through that and when she walked out
[1:39:46] they looked at the mind what
[1:39:48] what is this and they just like the
[1:39:51] natural beauty say she beautiful all by
[1:39:55] herself she don't need no help here
[1:40:02] after standing there and that I mean a
[1:40:05] hatchery say III III found my queen I
[1:40:08] found my replacement to Vashti it might
[1:40:11] it was an unwonted circumstance but I
[1:40:13] got somebody look a little bit better
[1:40:16] but Uncle say also now don't reveal your
[1:40:19] identity
[1:40:20] don't tell them who you are don't tell
[1:40:23] them who your people are just just keep
[1:40:25] it to yourself and you can just see
[1:40:27] Esther when you read the book of Esther
[1:40:29] how she just man man I'm grateful I'm
[1:40:32] glad that you're not my uncle my uncle
[1:40:34] did this him you know in heat and I'm
[1:40:37] glad he raised me the way he raised me
[1:40:38] and and look at me I'm promoted to queen
[1:40:40] and you know and look at all this you
[1:40:43] know but I mean maybe she just kind of
[1:40:45] just got to get lost in her new position
[1:40:48] but there was some pressure that came
[1:40:51] because a man gonna be what he is I'm
[1:40:55] the pressure see I mean when you get on
[1:40:58] the pressure that's when your true
[1:41:00] character gonna begin the show
[1:41:02] hallelujah somebody and when the
[1:41:04] pressure came motor casting out now
[1:41:08] Esther you need to go an out you need to
[1:41:10] go talk to keep saying that now wait
[1:41:11] uncle Mordecai you know you're not
[1:41:14] supposed to go to the king unless you've
[1:41:15] been called Mordecai say don't forget
[1:41:18] why you're really in the kingdom Esther
[1:41:22] don't forget why you then don't forget
[1:41:24] what God done done for us they don't
[1:41:26] don't don't you forget about all that
[1:41:27] yeah you don't made it to certain steps
[1:41:29] but remember God gave you that status he
[1:41:33] said maybe maybe maybe maybe your whole
[1:41:35] purpose not just to be queen but maybe
[1:41:36] God brought you to the kingdom for such
[1:41:40] a time as this
[1:41:43] Esther so y'all pray three days of
[1:41:46] fasting and praying and after we after
[1:41:48] we fast and pray I'm gonna go in and I'm
[1:41:50] gonna see the king and Esther took it
[1:41:52] upon herself she say if I die if I
[1:41:55] perish let me perish but I am going in
[1:41:58] to see this
[1:42:00] and when she went before a hazard say
[1:42:02] what do you want you know you whatever
[1:42:04] you need you can have it he just began
[1:42:06] to you know invited him to dinner and
[1:42:08] invite you know hang them to dinner and
[1:42:09] often say Haman Haman Haman had an
[1:42:11] unwonted circumstance you know his I
[1:42:14] don't want a circumstance he hated
[1:42:16] Mordecai because Mordecai would not
[1:42:18] battle now how is it that Mordecai would
[1:42:20] not bow but Mordecai raised a young lady
[1:42:23] that became queen can you imagine all
[1:42:26] the dynamics that was going on in more
[1:42:28] to Kyle's house and maybe understand you
[1:42:30] not my dad anyway
[1:42:32] oh come on somebody
[1:42:37] oh all the pressure but God was actually
[1:42:39] preparing them something so much green
[1:42:44] man aw and when you just go back and
[1:42:46] read the story in how our Haman had that
[1:42:48] plan I'm one on one that circumstance he
[1:42:50] was gonna hang his unwanted circumstance
[1:42:54] because they had the wrong heart the
[1:42:57] same gallows that he'd built for
[1:42:58] Mordecai are the same gallows he ended
[1:43:01] up hanging from be careful when you're
[1:43:04] digging a ditch for somebody you just
[1:43:08] might fall in yourself all right thank
[1:43:13] God that Esther was raised and she was
[1:43:15] able to spare her people even after she
[1:43:18] went through all the all the unwanted
[1:43:20] circumstances when the pressure was
[1:43:21] actually put on Esther Esther then the
[1:43:24] revelation came out as to who she really
[1:43:26] was thank God thank God for that first
[1:43:29] Peter four and twelve says beloved think
[1:43:31] it not strange concerning the fiery
[1:43:35] trial which is to try you as though some
[1:43:37] strange thing happen unto you think it
[1:43:39] not strange and I want to just read a
[1:43:41] quote here from Smyrna in church age
[1:43:44] glory to God the Prophet tells us says
[1:43:48] thinking that strange concerning the
[1:43:49] fiery trials that aren't to try to you
[1:43:51] that is what Peter said is it is a
[1:43:54] strange that God wants us to develop a
[1:43:57] christ-like character that comes through
[1:44:00] suffering no sir and we all have trials
[1:44:05] we all are tried and chasing their sons
[1:44:08] not one but goes through that the church
[1:44:11] that is not
[1:44:12] suffering and it's not being tried isn't
[1:44:17] of God my god the church that is not
[1:44:22] suffering and it's not being tried isn't
[1:44:24] of God you're not of God if you're not
[1:44:27] going through something
[1:44:28] hallelujah that's why you got a counter
[1:44:30] off George soon as the devil unleash an
[1:44:32] attack praise God I was telling somebody
[1:44:35] this week and I want I remember somebody
[1:44:37] telling me this
[1:44:38] people do not throw rocks bottles sticks
[1:44:43] at trees with no fruit on it so if you
[1:44:52] get hit with a rock a bottle or a stick
[1:44:54] is because you producing some fruit come
[1:44:58] on somebody that's the only reason they
[1:45:01] throw it because they see fruit you
[1:45:04] ain't got to be jealous so the fruit
[1:45:06] just get planted and you will start
[1:45:08] going glory to God
[1:45:16] listen Hebrews 12:6 for who the Lord
[1:45:18] loveth he chases and scourgeth every son
[1:45:21] whom he receiveth but if he be without
[1:45:24] chastisement where's our where all our
[1:45:28] partakers then are you bastards and not
[1:45:30] sons it goes on to say this aid man says
[1:45:34] now this special condition of Smyrna
[1:45:36] must be applied to every age there is no
[1:45:39] age free from it it says there is no
[1:45:42] true believer free from it this is of
[1:45:46] God's this is the will of God it is
[1:45:51] needful we need the Lord to teach us the
[1:45:55] truth that we are to suffer I love this
[1:45:58] we are to suffer and be christ-like in
[1:46:01] doing it
[1:46:02] love suffereth long and is kind love
[1:46:08] suffers long and is kind Matthew 5 verse
[1:46:11] 11 through 12 says blessed are ye when
[1:46:13] men shall revile you and persecute you
[1:46:15] shall say all manner of evil against you
[1:46:18] falsely see Jesus did nothing amiss so
[1:46:20] when people do you the same way they did
[1:46:23] Jesus just know you
[1:46:24] you must be doing something right when
[1:46:27] people say all manner of evil against
[1:46:29] you falsely for my sake rejoice and be
[1:46:31] exceeding glad what a scripture it
[1:46:34] didn't say it didn't say come to church
[1:46:36] with a sour look on your face and I'll
[1:46:39] talk about what you're going through
[1:46:40] your job I'm told I'm talking I'm
[1:46:43] talking when evil is just you know just
[1:46:45] all-around wickedness all around but the
[1:46:48] Bible say rejoice and be exceeding glad
[1:46:52] look at that rejoice and be exceeding
[1:46:55] glad for great is your reward in heaven
[1:46:56] for so persecuted they the prophets
[1:46:59] which were before you see it's all about
[1:47:02] the attitude let's go on this is this is
[1:47:04] one of my favorite cool so I'm going to
[1:47:05] keep I'm still in that same quote this
[1:47:08] is one of my favorite quotes where the
[1:47:09] Prophet says this the cloudy skies and
[1:47:12] storms of life are no signs of God's
[1:47:16] disapproval they hear that the cloudy
[1:47:19] skies of just right down beneath it the
[1:47:22] cloudy skies and storms of life are no
[1:47:24] signs of God's disapproval neither are
[1:47:28] bright skies a man neither bright skies
[1:47:31] and steel waters glory to God signs of
[1:47:35] his love and approval his approval of
[1:47:39] any of us is in the beloved his love is
[1:47:42] elective oh my god
[1:47:45] which he had for us before the
[1:47:47] foundation of the world
[1:47:49] does he love us ah yes but how shall we
[1:47:55] know we shall know oh you know some of
[1:48:01] us think some of us think that God's
[1:48:03] love is proven in our material blessings
[1:48:05] Oh
[1:48:07] so you gotta understand that even if
[1:48:09] even if you don't have material
[1:48:11] blessings he still loves you he still
[1:48:13] went to the cross and died listen he
[1:48:16] says he says but how should we know we
[1:48:18] shall know because he said so and
[1:48:22] manifested that he did love us he
[1:48:24] brought us to himself and gave us of his
[1:48:27] spirit raising us as sons and how shall
[1:48:30] I
[1:48:30] prove my love to him not just with your
[1:48:33] lip service it says by believing what he

[1:49:44] there's these unwanted circumstances
[1:49:46] that happen to us all just I want to
[1:49:50] read another quote here and then I want
[1:49:52] to get into Jacob my now this this quote
[1:49:58] is going to come from the sermon the
[1:50:03] angel of God and something happened on
[1:50:07] platform which would have been an
[1:50:09] unwanted circumstance something was
[1:50:12] revealed on platform that's that's why I
[1:50:15] wanted you don't want to be embarrassed
[1:50:17] in front of everybody but sometimes what
[1:50:19] that produces is a blessing listen look
[1:50:22] at this the angel of God the Prophet
[1:50:24] says this says but on the platform I
[1:50:26] have to watch I'm just opening up my
[1:50:30] heart I feel that I'm before friends
[1:50:31] tonight I have to be careful what I do
[1:50:33] did you did you know divine gifts could
[1:50:36] cause you to lose your soul so you have
[1:50:39] to watch what you do with that with
[1:50:41] divine gifts my heart goes
[1:50:42] I look here and see this little water
[1:50:44] head baby land before me now you don't
[1:50:46] know how my heart goes out for that baby
[1:50:48] wish I could see what a wish wish I
[1:50:52] could see what would take place how I
[1:50:55] believe to say that little mother there
[1:50:57] oh Jesus Christ has healed you baby your
[1:51:00] prayers are answered wish I could say
[1:51:02] that but I can't till he tells me I have
[1:51:05] to be careful it says now may be the
[1:51:08] privilege of giving that person before
[1:51:10] me maybe there's something causing that
[1:51:12] well if I get it
[1:51:14] maybe when standing before the person or
[1:51:16] this lady sitting here you or interview
[1:51:18] it might it might see the reason now now
[1:51:21] you noticed I'm very particular how I
[1:51:24] rebuked a spirit out there I'm there
[1:51:27] particular on how our rebuking spirit
[1:51:29] out there because you have to watch
[1:51:31] sometimes God use this sickness for
[1:51:37] chastisement for the people did you know
[1:51:39] that I wanted circumstance of sickness
[1:51:45] is used as trust chastisement for the
[1:51:48] people I'm gonna next week I think I'll
[1:51:56] hit this but Miriam got sick and it was
[1:52:02] chastisement for her she developed
[1:52:05] leprosy because she spoke against God's
[1:52:09] prophet oh my god now I need to tell you
[1:52:16] all that when a person developed leprosy
[1:52:19] there was a particular way that they had
[1:52:22] to go through to have it cleansed let me
[1:52:25] also go a little further one of the
[1:52:28] other things that they had to do was put
[1:52:31] the person outside to camp
[1:52:33] I can't preach my sermon next weekend
[1:52:35] I'm gonna let that go
[1:52:37] no i'ma let that go that's coming to my
[1:52:40] sermon next week but let me let me just
[1:52:43] say this when you recognize leprosy they
[1:52:48] had to take it to the priests not to
[1:52:52] psychiatrists
[1:52:54] not to a doctor it had to go to the
[1:52:57] priests and there are some people that
[1:52:59] have a problem with the preacher or the
[1:53:01] priest being in their business but
[1:53:03] according to Old Testament scripture you
[1:53:05] supposed to take it to the priest and
[1:53:07] the priest is the one that announces or
[1:53:10] pronounces whether you clean or not
[1:53:12] clean and if the priest said you were
[1:53:15] unclean you know I had to happen you had
[1:53:16] to separate for seven days a week
[1:53:20] oh god I'm gonna actually how to do
[1:53:24] something sometimes you get leprosy in
[1:53:29] they can have it in the forehead you
[1:53:31] have it in the forehead right right here
[1:53:34] and the priest would have to examine the
[1:53:36] forehead and they'd have to see you know
[1:53:38] or if they got in their head or anywhere
[1:53:39] just you know any anywhere in the skin
[1:53:42] and maybe if it was developed some kind
[1:53:44] of way in the face you had to you know
[1:53:47] deal with it can I tell y'all something
[1:53:50] this from leprosy and Facebook and it
[1:53:57] would be real nice if you disconnect it
[1:54:00] for about seven days its leprosy in the
[1:54:08] face and some of the things that you
[1:54:11] actually I'll come through your eyes and
[1:54:12] you read and you don't realize you
[1:54:14] getting sick so I'm an axon just as a
[1:54:23] priest disconnect for at least seven
[1:54:25] days now I know some of y'all run
[1:54:28] business and you got to do business I
[1:54:30] thought the personal stuff disconnect
[1:54:32] from the personal stuff for seven days
[1:54:34] Facebook that's next week's sermon but I
[1:54:40] have to let me keep going I wanted
[1:54:44] circumstance now that might to some
[1:54:45] y'all that that might be an unwanted
[1:54:47] circumstance but I've talked about
[1:54:48] leprosy in half go back and read
[1:54:50] Leviticus 13 and 14 you'll understand
[1:54:53] how these things got to be handled glory
[1:54:55] to God
[1:54:56] alright do you want to stop the leprosy
[1:55:00] disconnect all right let me keep reading
[1:55:05] where was I was reading a quote here
[1:55:06] either
[1:55:06] angel
[1:55:07] so let me keep going here a man and and
[1:55:10] trust me next week come back next week I
[1:55:12] got I got more on that a man all right
[1:55:15] where was I in that quote here oh yeah
[1:55:20] sometimes God uses sickness for
[1:55:21] chastisement for the people did you know
[1:55:24] that sometimes it's brought a pump them
[1:55:25] for a whip
[1:55:27] to bring them back to God and what if
[1:55:30] God has permitted something there and I
[1:55:32] buy a divine gift taken off without
[1:55:34] repentance of that person did you notice
[1:55:39] the man here that told me a couple of
[1:55:41] nights ago something another that was
[1:55:44] standing here on the platform he
[1:55:45] professed to be a Christian oh Lord see
[1:55:47] a lot of people profess to be Christians
[1:55:49] but they finished demonstrate that
[1:55:51] they're not Christians listen he
[1:55:54] belonged to a modern church and
[1:55:55] everything and he had some trouble wrong
[1:55:57] with him and I looked and I kept seeing
[1:55:59] it turned dark and I kept watching I've
[1:56:01] seen him standing on a corner with the
[1:56:03] sick guy on his mouth smoking like that
[1:56:05] blowing the smoke I said sir you have a
[1:56:08] habit and that's what standing between
[1:56:10] you and God if you're ready to lay down
[1:56:12] those cigars God's ready to heal you now
[1:56:14] say in front of everybody but he was
[1:56:17] professing to be a Christian but cometh
[1:56:19] oh that pillar of fire and a had it
[1:56:21] called die what was really going on this
[1:56:23] life don't don't be embarrassed by God
[1:56:26] get to life right right God he says
[1:56:29] God's ready to hear you now see and he
[1:56:31] goes we'll stay here not long ago there
[1:56:33] was a woman come across the platform
[1:56:35] very saintly looking woman and she
[1:56:36] walked up on the platform
[1:56:37] she had one ear death I just detected a
[1:56:41] deaf spirit and I tried to rebuke it in
[1:56:43] a state with the woman and while looking
[1:56:45] at her I've seen a young lady stepping
[1:56:47] in front of me about 14 years old and
[1:56:48] she took the road that's wrong I began
[1:56:51] to tell I told a woman she had a baby
[1:56:52] before she was before she was even
[1:56:55] married and then she married a man she
[1:56:57] left him and but that was some religious
[1:56:59] cult calls her to marry some other man
[1:57:00] she didn't love him she left him I said
[1:57:03] you're living with her husband now that
[1:57:04] you're having all kinds of trouble and
[1:57:06] the woman fainted on the platform and
[1:57:08] when she rose up from there she screamed
[1:57:10] God have mercy on me and when she did
[1:57:12] God open up her ear give her the baptism
[1:57:16] of the Holy Spirit standing on the
[1:57:17] platform right there it was our mourning
[1:57:20] circumstance to
[1:57:21] there's in front of all those people but
[1:57:22] when the saying got clear the lady
[1:57:24] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:57:27] God uses sunburnt circumstances to draw
[1:57:31] us closer to him oh my god I want to
[1:57:35] pick up the story of Jacob man he had so
[1:57:41] many unwanted circumstances that
[1:57:44] occurred in his life and let's just turn
[1:57:47] here to Genesis 31 and we'll read this
[1:57:55] praise the Lord we all have it we all
[1:58:01] have unwanted circumstances but God can
[1:58:03] use those those circumstances
[1:58:05] amen a draws closer to him closer to him
[1:58:09] count it all joy well already got
[1:58:14] Genesis 30:1 starting at verse 1 now as
[1:58:19] we as we read this to understand you
[1:58:23] know there are some other things that
[1:58:24] happen in Jacob's life before he got to
[1:58:27] this part and some of those things that
[1:58:29] happened a man Jacob there born in the
[1:58:33] house with his parents and man his mama
[1:58:37] loved him but his daddy loved his
[1:58:38] brother Esau the Jacob got you know he
[1:58:43] fixed some good porridge and got a
[1:58:44] blessing you know a birthright you know
[1:58:47] from his from his brother so you know
[1:58:48] look if you you want if you his brother
[1:58:50] come from hunting and also you want you
[1:58:52] want you want some food you got to give
[1:58:53] me your birthright say I don't care
[1:58:55] about my birthright you can have it so
[1:58:56] I'm about to die you can have it just
[1:58:58] gave him a little porridge some lentils
[1:58:59] you know for my understanding and he
[1:59:02] sold out for that you know Esau slowed
[1:59:03] down and then when it come time for a
[1:59:05] blessing if I thought he was about to
[1:59:09] die and it says it's except since of
[1:59:11] Esau at the field give me some good
[1:59:13] savory meat let me eat that at your hand
[1:59:16] before I die and I want to bless you
[1:59:18] well the the wife Rebekah heard this and
[1:59:21] she calls Jacob to going she said what
[1:59:24] I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go and get an
[1:59:25] animal I'm gonna make it just the way
[1:59:26] your daddy like it and when I make you
[1:59:28] the way your daddy like it then I want
[1:59:30] you to go in and
[1:59:31] and get that blessing from your daddy
[1:59:34] now now you got to understand I look at
[1:59:36] this lady everything she was doing she
[1:59:38] was manipulating behind the scenes and
[1:59:41] nobody knew she had done all that Jacob
[1:59:44] knew she done it right Jacob knew she
[1:59:46] done it but you know even when it comes
[1:59:48] to time that Jacob left home because
[1:59:50] Esau was gonna kill him
[1:59:51] Esau lived all their years not knowing
[1:59:54] his mama was the one that set him up
[1:59:58] that's that's that's that's something
[2:00:00] that I mean this play they had a spirit
[2:00:02] on her where she was I mean she was
[2:00:04] trying to help God out God had told gave
[2:00:07] a promise about the older was serving
[2:00:09] the younger but she didn't have to help
[2:00:11] God out that way she created her own
[2:00:13] problems in her own household but with
[2:00:16] her actions these stories I'm half in
[2:00:20] the scripture just to happen we got to
[2:00:21] learn how to just let God be God
[2:00:23] otherwise we create unwarranted
[2:00:26] circumstances in our house we treat one
[2:00:29] child different than we cheek to treat
[2:00:30] the other one don't do that as parents
[2:00:32] treat them all the same man when I
[2:00:35] bought my daughter's cause if y'all
[2:00:37] noticed they all had the same car they
[2:00:42] all had this all them end up with
[2:00:44] Hyundai Sonata
[2:00:46] treat them all the same they've got
[2:00:48] different colors but they got the same
[2:00:50] car now when it's time for them to buy
[2:00:52] their own cars they can choose whatever
[2:00:53] they want to choose but they can't say
[2:00:55] daddy love the other one but no no no
[2:00:57] daddy didn't dare to treat you all the
[2:00:59] same all right praise the Lord but when
[2:01:02] we look at you know we look at the story
[2:01:04] amen
[2:01:05] here Rebecca is behind the scenes and
[2:01:08] she's manipulating and doing all kind of
[2:01:10] things and and and when went when they
[2:01:12] when they go on their trick you know
[2:01:14] Isaac and I mean here she's tricking her
[2:01:16] husband here she's also tricking her son
[2:01:18] I mean here she's just creating all
[2:01:20] kinds of problems in order to get this
[2:01:22] blessing for one boy right so when when
[2:01:26] Jacob goes in he gets this blessing and
[2:01:28] and the scripture talks about how you
[2:01:30] know as I said you know it's that guy I
[2:01:32] can I can feel the hair you know you
[2:01:35] know because II thought was a hairy man
[2:01:37] right and and Jacob was not a hair and I
[2:01:40] said now you don't put this this this
[2:01:42] this skin on your on your face and
[2:01:44] you make yourself your hair so now it
[2:01:46] feels like Esau's body but it sounds
[2:01:48] like jacobs voice you said now wait a
[2:01:52] minute say something writers Betty went
[2:01:54] on and ate and they smelled at me said
[2:01:56] you know what all right you must son I'm
[2:01:57] gonna take it because his eyes was going
[2:01:59] dim I want circumvent that this man was
[2:02:01] going blind right so he said he say uh
[2:02:03] he said I'm gonna take it I'm go ahead
[2:02:05] and bless me bless Jacob Jacob got that
[2:02:08] blessing and got out of there and then
[2:02:09] here come East off running as a dad I
[2:02:11] got the meat for you daddy I got it I'm
[2:02:13] you know I'm ready ready for my blessed
[2:02:15] they say son who's that just left him
[2:02:16] who just left here so Jess guy said he
[2:02:20] said son I just blessed somebody already
[2:02:21] whoever will just just here just got the
[2:02:23] blessing say my brother Jacob them did
[2:02:26] it to me again
[2:02:26] well athlete say daddy you got to have
[2:02:28] at least one blessing for me at least
[2:02:30] one more he gave him a blessing and said
[2:02:32] man daddy when he didn't tell his dad
[2:02:34] but in the start said once my daddy dies
[2:02:36] I'm gonna kill my brother
[2:02:38] Jenkin I'm gonna kill him I'm gonna kill
[2:02:41] me them took my birthright ain't gonna
[2:02:43] took my blessing I'm gonna kill him well
[2:02:46] the mama say well send them on back to
[2:02:49] my brother Laban because his brothers
[2:02:52] pretty furious with him he gonna get him
[2:02:53] and and and and we need to just get him
[2:02:55] out of here for right and I get Jacob
[2:02:56] out of here and she used another story
[2:02:58] to get him out of there
[2:02:59] Oh Lord Jesus her story was you know how
[2:03:03] two wives of East all Oh God
[2:03:06] you can bring the wrong wife home and
[2:03:09] actually create unwanted unwanted
[2:03:15] circumstance by bringing the wrong wife
[2:03:17] or bringing her own husband home and
[2:03:20] they said she say these ladies just
[2:03:22] grieved me I just I don't know what to
[2:03:25] do with these these lady please send my
[2:03:28] boy don't let him get married to one
[2:03:30] these ladies right here send them back
[2:03:32] home and let him get my brother Laban
[2:03:33] and let him find a wife down there most
[2:03:35] months of people so she sent Jacob away
[2:03:38] and we picked this story up and I was I
[2:03:40] was glad as Jacob when it went on his
[2:03:42] own you'll go back here you can read
[2:03:45] this but as he went on his own there
[2:03:47] come a time Jacob got so tired he just
[2:03:50] couldn't take another step and he laid
[2:03:53] down on the ground and when he laid down
[2:03:55] on the ground
[2:03:56] he saw a ladder going up you know to
[2:03:59] heaven he saw angels ascending and
[2:04:01] descending but the very spot that he
[2:04:03] felt tired Oh God God allowed him to get
[2:04:06] tired say the very spot to show him this
[2:04:08] lamb I have given you and I've given it
[2:04:11] to your seat after you the very spot
[2:04:13] that he felt like he couldn't go no
[2:04:15] further that's where he got a promise
[2:04:16] from Almighty God today you might feel
[2:04:19] like you cannot go any further but God
[2:04:22] got a promise for you that he's gonna
[2:04:24] turn a man that that that that that what
[2:04:27] looks like a a man looks like a cloud of
[2:04:29] situation gotta make that a blessing in
[2:04:31] disguise meant for you you can't go in
[2:04:34] there first but God got a blessing
[2:04:35] waiting for you if you keep pressing
[2:04:37] through it Jacob finally makes it to
[2:04:41] Laban that unwanted circumstance that
[2:04:44] caused him to leave home the blessing
[2:04:47] that he received he got a wife the love
[2:04:51] of his life
[2:04:51] Rachel was waiting for him on the other
[2:04:54] side of his trial he got Rachel well it
[2:04:59] didn't stop there because when he
[2:05:03] married Rachel
[2:05:04] he served seven years oh can I just I'll
[2:05:07] just bear with me just for a little bit
[2:05:08] here I'm coming out see honey
[2:05:10] sister sweetheart you want a man that
[2:05:15] will go to work you want a man that'll
[2:05:19] go to work not a man that you working

[2:05:37] Bible say right you want yourself a man

[2:07:06] all them tricks that he played in his
[2:07:07] past they caught up with him all them
[2:07:11] wanted circumstances that he created now
[2:07:14] he got some but you don't marry tonight
[2:07:19] you can't you can't get rid of it
[2:07:20] so the daddy say I tell you what you
[2:07:22] just fulfill how weak and then you work
[2:07:24] another seven years and I give you
[2:07:25] Rachel
[2:07:26] now now it didn't it wasn't that he
[2:07:29] worked another seven years to get Rachel
[2:07:30] he only had to wait seven days to get
[2:07:32] Rachel but during the time of him
[2:07:34] waiting seven days ago I mean by also
[2:07:36] getting Rachel he had to also fulfill
[2:07:37] another seven years so he was there for
[2:07:40] 14 years now and got his two wives a lot
[2:07:45] of different things come up a lot of
[2:07:46] different trials come up a lot of
[2:07:47] unwanted circumstances and we pick up a
[2:07:50] time for Rachel I mean for Jacob to take
[2:07:53] his wives and it's time for him to go
[2:07:55] back home to his his daddy that's what
[2:07:57] we picked up and let me let me tell you
[2:07:59] something there's gonna come a time in
[2:08:00] your life God gonna create some unwanted
[2:08:02] circumstances and it's gonna drive you
[2:08:06] back to where you come from oh I just
[2:08:08] said something
[2:08:11] God will create some unwanted
[2:08:13] circumstances in your life and it will
[2:08:16] drive you back to where you come from
[2:08:18] I remember the slalom he came from
[2:08:24] Florida I had to come back to Florida
[2:08:33] I wanted circumstances will drive you
[2:08:36] right back to where God wanted you to be
[2:08:38] all along so in the midst of it count it
[2:08:42] all joy let me just pick up these notes
[2:08:48] he had to run for his life from his
[2:08:50] brother Esau after taking the birthright
[2:08:52] of the blessing sometimes things occur
[2:08:54] in a family that might generate a need
[2:08:56] for separation but during the separation
[2:08:59] God has to do a work on both ends in
[2:09:01] order to bring the two parties back
[2:09:03] together again
[2:09:04] I hope you get that during the time of
[2:09:07] separation God has to work on both ends
[2:09:10] in order to bring the two parties back
[2:09:11] together again Joseph's brothers had
[2:09:13] they still had the same spirit on them
[2:09:16] when they came back the story would not
[2:09:18] an end it the same way and had Joseph
[2:09:21] not change himself the store would not
[2:09:23] have ended that way but God had did a
[2:09:25] work on both of them while they were
[2:09:27] separated in order to bring the two
[2:09:29] parties back together again where you
[2:09:31] can see reconciliation while on the run
[2:09:33] Jacob encountered God he saw the angels
[2:09:35] descending Amen ascending and descending
[2:09:37] to heaven he was tired of walking but
[2:09:39] the very places he was laying words
[2:09:41] ordained by God to be his and to be an
[2:09:43] inheritance for his children he worked
[2:09:45] seven years of Mary Rachel tricked on
[2:09:47] his wedding night and was given Leah
[2:09:49] worked in additional seven years a man
[2:09:51] to finally get Rachel a man he worked
[2:09:53] seven days but then he had to work
[2:09:54] another seven years
[2:09:55] amen as he as he agreed to with Laban
[2:09:58] and order to have both Leah and Rachel
[2:10:00] now we picked up something here in
[2:10:01] Genesis 31 let's read verse 1 through 7
[2:10:04] and then we'll call it a closed today
[2:10:06] he said they heard the words of labour
[2:10:08] this is the time where Jacob is being
[2:10:09] driven back home says inherit the words
[2:10:11] of Laban latest on sin Jacob have taken
[2:10:15] away all that was our fathers and of
[2:10:17] that which are which was our fathers
[2:10:19] have he gotten all this glory and
[2:10:22] a cat beheld the countenance of Laban
[2:10:24] and behold it was not toward him as
[2:10:26] before and the Lord said unto Jacob
[2:10:30] return unto the land of our fathers and
[2:10:33] to their kindred and I will be with thee
[2:10:35] see see now God is speaking that it's
[2:10:36] time to go and there's some things
[2:10:38] that's happened throughout this time of
[2:10:40] him being with Laban and God allowed
[2:10:42] these things happen in order to push
[2:10:44] hiccup to the place where he didn't feel
[2:10:45] comfortable where he was it's time to go
[2:10:47] back home now
[2:10:48] glory to God don't worry about us one
[2:10:51] day and dad is one day the children
[2:10:53] gonna have to come back home just wait
[2:10:55] on the unwanted circumstances God has a
[2:10:59] way it's some time it might take 20
[2:11:00] years just like it took for Jacob but 20
[2:11:03] years later here that aren't what that
[2:11:04] circumstance coming they coming back
[2:11:06] home listen and Jacob said and called
[2:11:09] Rachel and Leah to the field unto his
[2:11:11] flock and said unto Him I see your
[2:11:13] father's countenance is that it is not
[2:11:15] toward me as before but the God of my
[2:11:18] father has been with me and you know
[2:11:20] that with all my power I have served
[2:11:22] your father and this is what I like here
[2:11:25] and your father hath deceived me and
[2:11:28] changed my wages ten times but God
[2:11:31] suffered him not to hurt me so he worked
[2:11:35] for them 20 years and he's changed his
[2:11:37] wages ten times now we thought we
[2:11:40] thought we thought we saw two of them
[2:11:43] work seven years and you can have Leah I
[2:11:45] mean Rachel well then it comes that well
[2:11:47] okay another one you work you just
[2:11:49] fulfill how weak and then you can get
[2:11:51] you know Rachel but then you have to
[2:11:52] work another 70 years that Jacob has
[2:11:54] been in this journey for 20 years with
[2:11:56] Laban and ten times his wages has been
[2:11:59] changed he's had trial after trial after
[2:12:01] trial with Leoben I want you to
[2:12:05] understand something here cuz you got
[2:12:06] trial at the trial with your personal
[2:12:08] even whoever that is might be your boss
[2:12:10] a man it might be somebody in your
[2:12:12] family but whoever that is you got your
[2:12:14] trial but here here here's here's the
[2:12:16] thing I want you to understand he says
[2:12:17] he said your father have to see me and
[2:12:19] change my wages ten times but look at
[2:12:22] this but God suffer him not to hurt me
[2:12:27] and when I'm telling you going through
[2:12:29] some trials you're going through some
[2:12:31] tribulations you're going through some
[2:12:33] de-stresses but it could be worse
[2:12:36] and what what Jacob was saying but God
[2:12:40] suffered him not to hurt me yeah he
[2:12:42] might have changed my might change my
[2:12:44] wages but he couldn't touch my life and
[2:12:46] what you need to learn how to do is find
[2:12:47] something to give God praise for why are
[2:12:52] you in the midst of whatever you're
[2:12:54] going through find something that you
[2:12:56] can just worship Him and just glorify
[2:12:59] his name and stop complaining all the
[2:13:01] time see this is how you have joy in the
[2:13:04] midst of your trial I like that he said
[2:13:08] he found something to give God thanks
[2:13:10] for and he was finally blessed to return
[2:13:13] home to his father and to his mother but
[2:13:16] it took Jacob a number of years to get
[2:13:18] to this point but God will allow
[2:13:20] unwanted circumstance to drive a person
[2:13:23] right back to where he wanted them to be
[2:13:25] all alone
[2:13:27] god knows what he's doing we believe
[2:13:30] that praise the Lord
[2:13:33] amen let me finish up just read a quote
[2:13:37] here for you Oh glory to God I want to
[2:13:42] just Tarrant turn just a quick page and
[2:13:44] we're gonna call it a date you know
[2:13:46] there's unwanted circumstances I'm gonna
[2:13:48] be recognizing your day in its message
[2:13:49] that'll be a friend of quote but even
[2:13:51] even here in our land their unwanted
[2:13:53] circumstances that occur and and and
[2:13:56] sometimes laws and leaders and all kind
[2:14:00] of things God creates God a lot not
[2:14:02] creaks but he allows these things to be
[2:14:04] created in order to put us in a place
[2:14:06] where we need to be the Prophet makes a
[2:14:09] statement here and recognizing your day
[2:14:10] in its message see we don't have to get
[2:14:12] too involved in all the political
[2:14:13] conversations don't don't don't don't
[2:14:17] don't allow yourself to get wrapped up
[2:14:18] in that type of stuff
[2:14:19] God knows who's gonna be who Amen God
[2:14:22] already knows that praise the Lord
[2:14:24] whether they cheat it to get in or what
[2:14:26] God knew that they were gonna get in
[2:14:28] listen like Israel back in the promised
[2:14:31] land she don't know how she got back
[2:14:33] there she was just automatically put
[2:14:36] back there why master of force put her
[2:14:38] in her place now I'm gonna say something
[2:14:41] national force put Israel in her
[2:14:43] homeland national force will put the
[2:14:46] church in the World Council of Churches
[2:14:49] that's that's national force that's
[2:14:51] government right he says but the power
[2:14:54] of God will put the people in the
[2:14:57] bride's the world forces this way and
[2:15:01] the world forces that way but God forces
[2:15:05] upward unwanted circumstances will
[2:15:08] produce a rapture Kevin oh joy church
[2:15:17] glory to God say the Spirit of God which
[2:15:20] is the word of God my word and spirit in
[2:15:23] life will put the bride in her place
[2:15:26] because she'll recognize her position in
[2:15:29] the word then she's in Christ we'll put
[2:15:32] her in her place no national force will
[2:15:34] do it but the national force did drive
[2:15:36] Israel to the homeland the National
[2:15:39] forces of the Council of Churches will
[2:15:40] drive every organization into it but the
[2:15:43] power of God will raise the bride into
[2:15:46] glory out of it old people recognize
[2:15:50] their day as Jesus warned you the sign
[2:15:52] of Sodom and the church's condition of
[2:15:54] this thing we got a lot of unwanted
[2:15:57] circumstances spiritually but God is
[2:16:00] using every one of them to draw us
[2:16:02] closer to him I counted joy I counted
[2:16:09] joy hallelujah praise the Lord let's
[2:16:16] have a word of Prayer Church thank you
[2:16:19] Jesus glory to God

[2:16:30] trials they're not even not even
[2:16:33] we can't even account them worried into
[2:16:36] the glory that's going to be revealed in
[2:16:38] us we can't even compare it Lord to that
[2:16:41] so help us Lord to just embrace what you
[2:16:47] have allowed to happen it's preparing us
[2:16:49] for something much greater we Lord we
[2:16:52] can see all the little of natural things
[2:16:55] but God it starts moving to the
[2:16:56] spiritual side Lord how the prophetess
[2:16:59] brings in these national national forces
[2:17:01] listen doing that Lana unwanted
[2:17:03] circumstances even even in the past
[2:17:06] administration some of the laws that
[2:17:08] were passed unwanted circumstances but
[2:17:11] it's moving us closer to you Jesus help
[2:17:15] us to understand that God you'll never
[2:17:16] leave us nor forsake us so help us God
[2:17:21] so discount it joy no matter what it is

[2:24:04] this role as and Lord gave me a couple
[2:24:10] of things if they're Whitney I wanna
[2:24:13] find them real quick if you keep glasses
[2:24:16] that help take the fresh off me
[2:24:20] [Music]
[2:24:29] many of you know me and I've known for a
[2:24:39] long time this is not something that I
[2:24:47] [Music]
[2:24:50] stumbled into you know it's not
[2:24:56] something that often and I'll tell you
[2:24:59] this you know don't apologize for that I
[2:25:06] can't be nobody else but Who I am
[2:25:10] been through a lot of things you know
[2:25:16] I'm your brother man just like like
[2:25:21] everybody else
[2:25:21] and in this walton is gospel that we go
[2:25:25] through there's been some trying times
[2:25:28] I can certainly say there's been some
[2:25:30] trying times you know but uh God is
[2:25:35] faithful
[2:25:37] my wife and I I went through some real
[2:25:41] difficult trials in my life but uh you
[2:25:45] know I'm gonna serve the Lord with all I
[2:25:47] got you know they probably made a
[2:25:50] statement here in the message super sign
[2:25:54] very poignant there's 31 years ago I
[2:26:02] dedicated my life he said and I died the
[2:26:08] over the Brenham and give myself a
[2:26:14] service to respect and to take the filth
[2:26:18] off of the name of Jesus Christ and to
[2:26:22] put the Word of God back into the church
[2:26:25] he says I'm 31 years in service I turned
[2:26:32] 50 years old this year
[2:26:35] [Music]
[2:26:37] and Tina can attest it's just a brand
[2:26:44] it's just a car touch over 31 years that
[2:26:49] we've been in this message it's been a
[2:26:53] touch over 31 years that we we all
[2:26:57] remember what we went through when we
[2:27:01] first was introduced and came into this
[2:27:04] faces we all understood not not
[2:27:07] realizing that we'll be here at this
[2:27:10] time for sure that the rapture would
[2:27:16] have been taking place but here we are
[2:27:20] [Music]
[2:27:23] remember here in a lot of time that even
[2:27:26] at that time when we were young
[2:27:28] teenagers you guys age or younger
[2:27:32] there's some young men will take this
[2:27:34] message and take it across in sis I have
[2:27:42] the camera before I had been looking
[2:27:44] forward we would hear that and we
[2:27:47] wouldn't think for that would be yes we
[2:27:49] figured the rap should be done took
[2:27:51] place fun manner but like I say here we
[2:27:53] are
[2:27:54] and my grandmother passed few years back
[2:28:05] she was matriarch truly a woman that
[2:28:11] I've never heard that I look to as an
[2:28:13] example of a Christian a true Christian
[2:28:19] and the Lord took her home and it
[2:28:25] it did something to me in not long after
[2:28:33] that he took me father and I told the
[2:28:38] Lord that from my age that I was and
[2:28:45] when I was born my grandmother was
[2:28:47] around fifty years old I've never known
[2:28:50] her not to serve God with everything she
[2:28:53] had and I made a vow to God I promise
[2:28:58] that my children are my grandchildren
[2:29:03] from this day forward I never know
[2:29:08] me not serving the Lord regardless of
[2:29:13] where I'm and regardless of circumstance
[2:29:17] I'd go through I'm fully committed to
[2:29:23] serving God nothing will stop me
[2:29:28] [Music]
[2:29:31] we come a long way become a mighty long
[2:29:35] way and I believe what I see that God is
[2:29:41] doing that uh it's the hand of Lord yeah
[2:29:48] I remember back when we were in the
[2:29:51] other church and you know we had the
[2:29:57] meetings coming up brother Westco and la
[2:29:59] Fontaine's getting ready to uh they
[2:30:03] don't talk la Fontaine's were touring
[2:30:10] before Bobby Troup started touring and I
[2:30:15] found taste out of torment from watching
[2:30:17] the truth we we took it on the road
[2:30:20] first man sister Luis we would get a bus
[2:30:26] and we hit the road having church to
[2:30:30] church spreading God's Word brother
[2:30:34] James was our past and would preach and
[2:30:38] since the Lois was saying and the words
[2:30:41] spread the gossip rated was it was just
[2:30:43] wonderful
[2:30:45] but they tend to handle Jehovah my
[2:30:50] circumstance is unwanted brought us here
[2:30:54] and to finish this quote says 31 years
[2:31:00] of service God helped me to live and to
[2:31:04] see the day when I can see the hearts of
[2:31:07] Christians beating as one and the filth
[2:31:11] of women and mien and churches and their
[2:31:17] Creed's things drop away and the truth
[2:31:23] unadulterated Church of the Living God
[2:31:26] stands in the beauty of Christ to
[2:31:29] receive him when he come and I
[2:31:34] everything in my power to achieve them
[2:31:37] and that's my desire of my heart I
[2:31:40] realized what was so close we had to eat
[2:31:43] God is coming back for the church not
[2:31:47] only a church
[2:31:49] but a church church body and a church
[2:31:55] assembly without a spot or wrinkle we
[2:31:59] want the church well God have Liberty
[2:32:02] among us so everything has to be second
[2:32:07] order
[2:32:07] I said I'm reminded of the the young
[2:32:11] woman and the Bible there that
[2:32:13] approached Jesus as a Gentile and said I
[2:32:16] was on a date she didn't he just like
[2:32:19] like he didn't even hear because she
[2:32:22] approached him incorrectly she
[2:32:25] approached him incorrectly so when
[2:32:27] everything is in order
[2:32:31] we're in lockstep and we're all on one
[2:32:35] Accord
[2:32:36] God can will it blesses it must be in
[2:32:40] order it must be in alone

[2:33:23] that's gonna be it's gonna do everything
[2:33:26] according to Scripture you know Jesus

[2:33:33] you you know need to say some say John
[2:33:39] the Baptist some say you're a great
