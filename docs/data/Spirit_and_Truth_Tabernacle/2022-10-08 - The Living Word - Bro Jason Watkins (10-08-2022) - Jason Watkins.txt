tonight and I I like to call these types of services uh the whosoever will let them come amen and I remember brother brother Hugo McDonald he made a statement uh years ago and it just stuck with me um it was talking about if you had the opportunity a man to uh be in one of brother branham's Services uh where maybe there was thousands in the service or if you had the opportunity to have a personal interview with the prophet he says which one would you choose and uh it's just you and the prophet that's there and every question that you have in your heart you could just just just ask and you know just believe that you'll get an answer and uh and I think you know when he when he posed that question I said for me I said I would love to have this maybe just a little private moment uh with the prophet and just kind of have all my questions answered and and and and and and and not you know I mean I appreciate the big service but you know just that that what we call the intimate moment which just means so much and sometimes we have services like this it's what we call an intimate moment amen that we can have with God it's just you and God Alone ain't no distractions God can just speak directly to you and we trust that's what the Lord will do with us tonight amen we we certainly thank the Lord um and and let me also just um make mention that we thoroughly appreciate uh brother Quentin Jr on last night he he built the case and uh I mean I think we left here knowing certainly that a young person can live for the Lord Jesus amen and do it with uh with uh I mean with joy not

kept standing out of her mouth and now you know when somebody's speaking like that you don't lay no straw in front of them hey man you just joined your faith with their faith and expect God to do the

when the Lord just kind of put it in my heart to text him and invite him to come and be with us and I was just kind of going through a few mind battles there and like well I'll just wait till we get a a place before we start inviting ministers you know to kind of come and the Lord just said no no no no you can you can just get this place opened up just ask for him to open it up and just invite

wonderful wonderful wonderful praise God Amen brother Jack told me he was going to be leading singing tonight and I said good on me wow what a treat praise the Lord so we're looking forward to What the Lord Has for us this evening and tomorrow and I know the Lord is behind it amen and we just want to get out of his way quickly and we're going to invite you right into the scripture to Saint John chapter 1. very familiar reading for us been reading these passages here probably since our days of children and Sunday School here we see this is where Jesus comes to John in the water declares him to be the Lamb of God I want to speak to you tonight on The Living Word the living word and that's I want to underscore living and I sure appreciate just before we get get preaching want to say how much I appreciate brother Jack you have no idea how much we love brother Jack my and uh he's loved around the world and he's been like the the opening of the seals to the men's meeting amen when he come up there last year man it was a seal was broken amen and so they wanted him back this year and I could see why amen so we certainly haven't been enjoying him for many many years and brother Jack and I share teaching duties on our morning Bible study and uh I always loved to catch mother Jack I just his his way of going through his Bible studies is I always glean so much so much so if I say something tonight you might have heard before it's probably why I might have heard brother Jack said Amen on on the line and uh but you know it doesn't belong to any of us it belongs to the Lord and we're just his humble servants amen all you know I I I'm always mindful to say Lord you know that that's all I want to be just your servant amen praise the Lord so we want to to look right into the word of God tonight I have a you know kind of a special burden not not a special sermon per se but a real special burden on my heart that the Lord has been dealing with me about this service tonight and I can't confess to you that I know what's up fully but I do know that the Lord has got a great purpose in this service tonight so I want you to be mindful of that and I've done all I can do I've set myself aside and I've you know just laid before the Lord intentionally and just believing that God wants to do something very special tonight amen so I'm going to pretend I'm at home amen amen I'm among Home Folks amen praise the Lord praise the lord we have one common father and that's almighty God amen but to see brother smile he put a smile on my face I was sitting down my head down I was overlooking my notes and suddenly the room got dark and I I realized somebody stepped into the light and I looked up and there's brother Willian like my grandson with Brother Willie I have to get on my tiptoes to give him a hug brother Smiley my wife told me the first time you ever come and preached at Beaufort and you stepped out and I and and I introduced you at the platform she said for the first time in my life somebody made you look little I said wow hey man so we've been loving brother Willie for a long time as well appreciate his stand in the word of God heard y'all out here talking about brother Diggs and we don't call him brother Diggs around our church we call him the weapon I mean I'm not kidding even on the church calendar it don't say Cadre Diggs it says the weapon and everybody knows when they see that oh brother Diggs is coming [Laughter] even our church calendar says that oh the weapon is going to be here so praise the lord we we sure we seem to love we seem to have a lot of things in common brother Jack that we we love a lot of the same people amen praise the Lord let me get to my scripture a man would stand here and talk I feel relaxed and enjoying myself so amen we just want to go straight in here in first John I'm sorry Saint John chapter 1 verse 29. you have it say Amen the next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him and saith Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world this is he of whom I said after me cometh the man which is preferred before me for he was before me and that amazing he's saying this is the this is this is the man that's right this man and actually John was older and he says this man was actually before me see and I knew him not but that he should be made manifest to Israel therefore am I come baptizing with water and John bear records saying I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it Abode upon him and I knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me upon whom Thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same as he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost and I saw and bear record so John is a living witness here and I saw and bear record that this is the son of God again the next day after John stood in two of his disciples and looking Upon Jesus as he walked he saith Behold the Lamb of God he's saying it again see and the two disciples heard him speak and they followed Jesus and um you know it's just amazing John he's so positive you know that he's he's saying it here two and three times I I bear record this this is the one this is the Son of God this is the Lamb of God see and and so um uh let me see if I want to continue on here yeah okay so verse so verse 38 John Is Now John has been told you know that uh whoever he would see the spirit of God descending and remaining upon this would be the Lamb of God verse 38 then Jesus turned and saw them following and saith unto him what's seek ye they said unto him Rabbi which is to say being interpreted Master where dwelleth thou he saith unto them come and see now if you go 7 chapters deep into the Book of Luke I want to go to Luke chapter 7. praise God now this next passage is astonishing having heard just how positive John was in saying two and three different times repeating it and even telling the miraculous sign that he said the one who sent me told me when you see this and I saw it right now it's it's going to be difficult to reconcile but watch Luke 7 18. and The Disciples of John coming now to Jesus John sent them from prison John gets thrown in prison sends them to see Jesus and the Disciples of John showed him all these things and John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus saying art thou he that should come or look we for another when the men were come unto him they said John Baptist hath sent us unto thee saying art thou he that should come or look we for another and in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues and of evil spirits and unto many that were blind he gave sight then Jesus answering said unto them go your way and tell John what things ye have seen and heard how that the blind sea the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the deaf hear the dead are raised the poor to the poor the gospel is preached and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me let's pray father we stand here tonight Lord and they sang a song Lord that the bride has sung around the world Lord for decades now only believe all things are possible Lord they they sang a song and invited me to come forward and all I've done Lord is follow you up here now that's all I've done that's all I I'm just here to be your assistant Lord that's all I want to be that's all I've ever wanted to be is just your assistant so now Lord I humble myself and as brother Branham said I humbled myself again father now we just lay ourselves out to The Obedience of your spirit may you give us the bread of life we are depending on you tonight in Jesus name amen God bless you friends you can be seated say brother Jack I left that water both of those back there if you could grab one of them for me I'd appreciate it so I want to take tonight the Living Word and I'm I'm just going to if you'll just bear with me for a little bit I like to kind of lay a foundation thank you sir and and kind of build my case you know that's what the the word of God is I'm here to convince you of the word of God now I know you don't need convincing of the word of God you believe the word of God but but but a lot of times uh you know it's one thing to believe the word of God but then when it comes time for the word to live in you now we get a little shaky sometimes a lot of times we have a hard time because you know um kind of like John here we find sometimes that you know life can take a turn right and you know to to John you know it it you know it it it began to look doubtful to him when the circumstances of his life got really bad now it was one thing when he was in church and baptizing people and the spirit of God is descending and the Lamb of God is there and he's he's surrounded by all of his disciples and he's got Fellowship of the Saints and but you know now he he's not in church he don't have Fellowship he's cut off he's in jail and and suddenly life's not so bright anymore and brother Branham talks about his eagle eyes must have got a little dim and and you know and I I say that tonight not to not to throw our dear brother John under the bus but to encourage you if it can happen to Elijah it can happen to me it can happen to you that's right you know a lot of times you don't you know you don't always have that same you know that same feeling you you know a lot of times a pastor I I said this to my church recently I when I sometimes when I see the people you know away from church I don't always see that glowing smile and that joy and that happiness because life has a way of getting you down and then in perfect honesty and perfect sincerity and humility I don't always see the same guy in the mirror that I was that I was on Sunday I mean on Sunday you know it's the power of God and the people are here and the singing and the worship and the preaching and mind you just where's that devil and you're ready to crush him and then and then Monday comes and then sometimes things aren't as rosy and beautiful as they as they were and you know this is this is how it can go but now I'm preaching to you tonight on a living word because there is a word to be lived not just believed you know a lot of times we have to come to the sobering reality that we don't believe the word quite as much as we would like to think we do and and I and I'm not talking about being mentally convinced of it I'm talking about seeing it manifest in my life because if you believe it you'll live it so then sometimes when I see how I do and see how I am and see how I go sometimes I catch my actions or my reactions which is normally that gets us in trouble more than our actions is our reactions and I wonder my goodness I don't I don't have enough Faith here I thought I was a believer of this word hallelujah it's sometimes it can be uncomfortable to look in God's mirror and the and that you know it's when you when you look in the mirror of God's word it shows you the kind of person you really are and Paul you know he he warned against coming and looking into the mirror of God's word looking into this Liberty and and then the word really shows you really where you are I mean it takes away all doubt when you come out of the presence of God and the anointing and the and the ministry starts preaching the word of God you really get a real look at where you are spiritually and and that's not a bad thing that's a good thing that's why you come to church the bad thing Paul says is you leave the church and forget straight away what manner of man or woman the Bible showed you you were yes see Jesus talked about a principle of of the children of God versus the children of Darkness the children of Darkness do not like the light they won't come to the light they don't want to come to the light because the light exposes them and they don't want to be exposed but he talks about the children of God come to the light they love the light and the word of God exposes me it exposes you but I'm here to tell you I want to be exposed now don't want to be exposed to you but I want to be exposed to me I want to know where I stand I want to know if I got a problem I want to know about it [Music] I don't want the Lord to just Pat me on the head and say you're a good boy now carry on I want to know I'm looking to make a rapture I want to see the power of God flow freely when I pray for my children or grandchildren I want to see Devils move when I when I got married couples coming that need a problem I want to have a problem I want to see a devil defeated people are sick people are bound I want to see them free I got no time uh to to let myself I got no time for me listen we have seen the enemy and it is us that man in the mirror is your worst enemy see it's that one that you've got to constantly put under the blood and constantly keep your guard up there's a Living Word to be lived and a living force of God working to live his life in you that's a that's a mouthful but that's a point that I want you to get right off the bat there is there is a word to be lived there was a word in every age and there's a word in this age to be lived and a living force of God working to live his life in you now say man that's Jubilee I'm going to shout for that hold on there's an enemy lurking there's also an anti-word and a living devil trying to do the same thing just like there's a spirit of Christ there's a spirit of antichrist and just like there's a word there's an anti-word and just like there's a living God trying to live his Living Word in you alive there's a there's a devil trying to live an anti-word by his anti-life and know this he is anti-life he is anti-life I tell young people he's not your friend he he's trying he hates you he hates your family he wants to kill you he wants to kill every Satan will take away from you everything you care about right amen amen I want to be subject to The Living Word of God Jesus concluded here when he was he was giving the answer to John's disciples you know he didn't reintroduce himself he didn't he didn't pull out a business card you know John wants to know are you the one you know he he didn't he didn't show a photo ID he had nothing to do with that he wasn't trying to say yeah go back and tell him yeah I'm Jesus of Nazareth and his mother and my mother and all you know remember all of that remember that prophecy he didn't actually he actually didn't even go into the in into the into just the the history of of Prophecy but he actually referring back to Isaiah 61 about that the spirit of the Lord God would be upon him now he had already read that and went into his ministry the spirit of the Lord God is upon me to do what to set that Liberty that I'm her held captive to open these blinded eyes to to declare the acceptable year of the Lord and so when he when he's going to remind a word prophet of who he is what does he do he says go back and tell John what things you have seen and heard how that the blind sea the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the death here the dead erased the poor have the gospel preach because John knew a word Prophet would identify the word Jesus knew that a word Prophet like John Jesus knew a word Prophet would identify by the word and when he could see when the disciples came back as living witnesses to say what he read in Isaiah 61 1-2 we saw it we Are Witnesses and and that that satisfied John he was ready to go home to Glory I'm here to tell you something friends sometimes we can get down also we can get our eagle eyes filmed over uh circumstances can put that on us but when I come back to this word and I and I don't see it's just on a page but I see it living in the lives of the people and I see the the divine power of God moving see you've come too late to tell me it's not true and Jesus said blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me see so Jesus who was performing these Messianic Miracles reminded John's Disciples of this his point was that you know don't be offended when you see the word coming to pass when you go back to the Greek you find that it's meaning don't get trapped and thus let oneself be ensnared away from the word of God because sometimes The Word Alive offends human Minds it offends political correctness sometimes it it you know Jesus looks at a at a Greek woman and calls her a dog brother Branham said if he'd have done that to a Pentecostal they had jumped up and walked straight out of the building and I said I don't have to put up with this and she didn't have to put up with it but she was willing to because it was a test of her faith oh my goodness friends how many of us could witness tonight and say the Lord has tested me and I'm here still standing and still believing this word Hallelujah one had to have faith in his message and in his works that he was indeed that Messiah the worst translation records that 23rd verse and spiritually prosperous is he whoever does not find in me that of which he disapproves and which hinders him from acknowledging my authority now it's interesting because when they had said to Jesus we read it in our opening text then Jesus turned and saw them following and saith unto him what seek you they said in them Rabbi where dwelleth thou and he saith unto them come and see it's interesting because he's already starting to establish here that that you know you're going to have a right and you should have an expectation to see the power of God it shouldn't just be something that's an intellectual concept because you can be persuaded that doesn't mean you're revelated if you can be talked in you can be talked out if you can be persuaded in you can be dissuaded out brother Burley Williams honor brother Burley brother Burley told me one time he said brother Jason I learned long time ago if somebody can get you in with a hot dog somebody gets you out with a hamburger said Burley you're the only man in the world would come up with and there's so much truth in that listen friends I'm not I I the Bible is provable and the message is provable by the Bible if you believe the Bible you can't you can't uh you can't come against the message I've been challenging that since 15 years old doing public Bible studies uh in public I mean that this this message is nothing but the scriptures and it's provable forwards and backwards I I one time we had a a a a situation in Beaufort where we had a church come against us and we decided to have a kind of a public venue in a public forum that I wouldn't let it turn into a debate but I said it'll be a it'll be an open forum and uh I'll take some time and you can take some time and we'll invite the public and and let whoever wants to come and I probably shouldn't have said that man the newspaper got a hold of it brother Jack and people started showing up we had the Performing Arts uh rented at the college campus College professors were coming students were coming people from the community were coming is like a big Showdown and I didn't want him to be a big Showdown oh my but you know we were I don't want to get sidetracked that's a lengthy testimony but but but but but I'm making this point that that we had agreed to to take the topic of the original sin wow and this this this pastor had a big Bible school as Doctor of divinity had a large Bible school that he was the dean of and and pastor of a large Church there and here I am you know this is why I was just starting my goodness I didn't have maybe 30 some odd people and and and here we are all of our people in one little row and his whole church filling up row after row after Rome and then all the people come in the back and the professors and students and uh in place with seat 500 people and we didn't have near that but but we had probably at least several hundred and so you know but I I was trying to get him to understand that you know I'm going to bring the thought of the original sin the Serpent's Seed and you know he just he just you know he I don't want to repeat what he said it's not anything to repeat in a pulpits not even something I'd want to repeat in public the man was just so horrible and you know he's threatening this and he's going to do this and make me you know make me look like an idiot and all these kind of things and I'm just you know and and we're kind of go on the phone and I'm thinking wow why is this guy so upset we're just we're supposed to be preachers we're gonna just discuss the scripture and and you know he uh he said he said I won't have any problem he said because that that that that that Doctrine is nowhere in the Bible and I said Dr Baker it's all through the Bible and he said I'll take my Bible and he said I'll make you look well he's what he said he'd make me look like I ain't gonna say back part of a horse but he didn't say it that way yeah it had a he had a thoroughbred Baptist temper and so you know we're and I I was troubled and I I said he said I'm going to take my Bible and show you up in this way and I said Dr Baker I'm just going to warn you right now I said I'm just going to warn you sir your doctor of divinity I have none of that I said but I'm going to warn you that if you if you come against the teaching of the original sin you better bring something other than your Bible oh and that just kind of made him more mad I said because it's all the Bible and uh and and God came down and proved it in it in a miraculous way amen I I can't get sidetracked on all these stories but I'm here to tell you something friend God God proves his word God proves his word you don't have to you don't have to back up from it God will demonstrate it I've seen him demonstrated around the world this Living Word lives see and so so we find then that Jesus would when they said where do you do you where do you dwell and he said come and see interestingly enough we find that this is the very thing he says in Revelation 6 1 when the seals are opened and and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as the very first one as it were the noise of a thunder one of the four be saying come and see he says it again all the way through all the way through the fourth seal under the eagle age that we live in today Revelation 6 7 and we need to open the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth Beast say come and see so there's obviously something to be said about what we see what we perceive and what we conclude see so it it becomes very clear in the scripture that you know life can throw these things at us just like it through things that John but you know John was able to recover by a reconsideration of the word of God you know I want to tell you something tonight friends I I I can't help and I might can't even explain why why why you might be in the trial you're in why something might be in your life hindering you it might be a sickness it might be a bondage it might be some Calamity it might I don't know what it might be but I know this have a reconsideration of the word of God tonight because my conclusion is this that he lives and he's true and he wants to live in me and it becomes important what we believe and what we demonstrate see brother Brannan picks this up in looking at the Unseen and the seventh seal and various places I don't want to get too bogged down tonight uh in scriptures and quotes because I'm trying to really deliver my heart to you my brother Branham talks about being a witness amen and you remember he tells the the amusing story of being a boy and how he could jump out of his overalls into the cold water and all of his friends he was always the first one in and one finger minutes cold be careful come in Easy boys two fingers met yeah it's warm Jump On In and and brother Branham said he said now he says he says I I was a witness I had already tested it and now if there's any here tonight that perchance are not born again just come on in the water's fine I've already witnessed it he was a witness of God's word you're you're more of a witness than you realize friends I'm a witness I've take I've traveled this message on six of seven continents and I've seen the power of God move I know what this word will do in a person's life Hallelujah brother Brandon talks about in the seventh seal man have I ever had this happen he says I went to a man not long ago he come to me rather and he had been arguing oh my they loved argue don't they he had been arguing all around everywhere against Divine Healing all right and he come up and he said I don't believe in Your Divine Healing I said mine I guess wouldn't be any good because I ain't got any and he said and I said but God is perfect and he says there is no such a thing I said you're too late to say that buddy yeah you done waited too long for that you might argued that a few years ago but there's another age on now there's Millions to testify I said you're too late now fella to say that I'm here to tell you something friends the world is too late to tell me it's not true because we're all we're we're living and I'm not just talking about miracles I'm talking about the greatest Miracle listen friends the greatest Miracle you've already accomplished it in your life you pass from Death unto life something you had no way to affect in your own life but God rich in Mercy it was a supernatural act I mean your human mind was enmity against God and could never agree with this word how are you ever even going to believe it God rich in Mercy I'm here to tell you something friends you've already conquered the greatest battle you would ever have to fight everything from there is downhill because now you got a new nature so don't be discouraged press the battle we're living in an age of impossibility it is impossibly dark there's no way no bride should have been able to survive this my brother Brandon when he's asked I remember theorasmus talked talking about when brother Brandon was there and there was a reporter from his country who interviewed brother Branham concerning his prediction of 1977. why did you choose 1977. and he says because that it got so dark after that he said I couldn't I don't think I didn't think anyone could survive it and here you are decades into impossibility you are decades you say I don't feel like much of a Christian God is doing more in you than you are aware of Hallelujah the world is falling away into insanity but there's a group of people who are still standing still believing still going forward the world cannot have me I belong to the Lord God keeps his word god proves his word God is looking to live his word through you I mean in the in the nature change and Divine Healing and deliverance and and blessing and all of these various things I mean listen friends they've come too late to tell me I've done seen blinded eyes open I've done seen the lame walk I I've I've I've been around ministers personal close ministers and and we've already had the dead raise and that's that's not yesteryear that's recent friends you who can raise the dead except God see so I've I've seen too many experiences one of the things that I've looked for and I would just say it like this one of the things that when I look in the book of Acts and I see you know the various Miracles and and the the shadow of Peter and and and you know and and laying their hands in many many miracles and the power of God one of the things that always has intrigued me was when I come to the house of Cornelius now Peter is on a roof he's praise and prayer his daily prayer and here comes a vision and a blanket is let down by the Four Corners and upon it is all manner of unclean beasts that as a Jew he's not supposed to eat and he hears a voice saying Peter slay and eat and he says not so Lord no unclean thing has touched my lips and the Lord said to him don't call unclean what I've called clean now the Lord's trying to he's about to to do something and he's trying to give Peter the word so that when it happens it'll make sense to him see I want to tell you something Friends The Rapture is going to make sense to me because I've already got the word in this hour you say how you know you're you're an overcomer I know I'm an overcomer and I understand how I am because the word said I would be and it sent me what I would need to be that say Do you ever make mistakes that's the beauty of it I do all the time then how are you an overcomer listen brother branham's taught us that that that when you are knocked down that doesn't mean you're defeated it's only when you lay there that you're defeated Hallelujah I said brother Jack I said to my church some time ago I walked out from my poop and I said you're looking at a man undefeated in battle because I've never laid there I always get back up and get back up and get back up I've never actually been defeated I've been knocked down but I'm not defeated I'm 59 years old I'm 59-0 I've never been defeated Hallelujah [Music] and it makes sense to me because he's given me the word the world doesn't scare me my heart's not failing for fear because the greatest fear is the fear of the unknown that's why little kids won't go in a dark room even adults won't sometimes because you don't know what's in there especially if you're in there and you can't see and you hear a noise then he's supposed to be there oh my goodness my my oldest grandson Gideon big big is brother Smiley and 19 could probably press me with one arm and he spent the night at our house me and sister Debbie were out of town people can I stay at your house yes sure gee and so he's he he calls me up and I and I looked at my phone I said Gideon's calling me and I answered he goes Peppa your house makes a lot of weird noises I said get in it you're fine you're I mean I'd be terrified if I come and broke in the house and you were in there and so you know but but but but but men's Hearts failing for fear my heart's not failing for fear because not only do I know what's going on I understand it I understand what's going on I understand what God's up to I understand the why and that's the question that plagues man is the why even if he understands the what he but the why but I know the what and the why and I know the end and I know the plan and I know what's I know what we're doing I'm here to tell you something friends this crazy world makes perfect sense to me because of the Bible I know that man has to go off into insanity and Destroy himself [Music] amen and so when the world sees what's happening in Russia or Ukraine or North Korea or China there there you Wall Street gets all nervous and the stocks go up and down and the president makes all kinds of speeches and and people do all kinds of things I just sit back and turn the next page yeah I knew it and there it is there it is and there it is I see what the devil's doing I know what the plan is hallelujah we're privileged tonight friends and I and here goes Peter it happens three times he says now there's men coming doubt nothing go with them he goes with them he goes into the house of Cornelius and he's still he's still unaware what's going on there's a gentile he's definitely not supposed to be hanging out with him and he goes in and Cornelius starts to tell him a testimony I was in prayer just like Peter and a man in shining garment stood in front of me and said send a Joppa for a man named Simon Peter and he it is who will give you the words of life and so I sent Messengers and they got you and here you are and now my whole household is assembled and we want to hear what you have to say and Peter began preaching and I've always looked at this brother Jack because it's one thing you know brother Brian I'm talking about the laying on of hands and he said that's a Jewish thing the Gentile was just say the word you know as you believed so be it unto you and and brother Branham used prayer lines that we use them I use them all the time I'd hold one tonight if the Lord told me to uh we're not not nothing against that don't misunderstand me that's not my point but but but while Peter was speaking while the word was going forward suddenly the Holy Ghost fell down and baptized everyone in the house and when Peter got back they bring him up you know call him on the carpet you know when he gets back to Jerusalem and you know what were you doing and Peter said listen here's what happened I was on the roof I saw a vision I went to see him he told me he saw an angel and I started preaching and the Holy Ghost failed just like it did on us what you want me to do about it I'm not God God can do whatever he wants to do I'm just here to be a servant see he didn't warn me he didn't tell me what was happening I might not have went if he'd have warned me he told me to go and doubt nothing see and while Peter yet spank these words I was in I was in Moscow probably I think 2018 Maybe 2019. and I I had always looked at that scripture brother Jack and I like I say many times I'd seen Devils cast off laying on of hands calling on the name of the Lord epilepsy demon possession blinded eyes you name it deafness it didn't matter um you know and see people baptized with the Holy Ghost those kind of things you accumulate we were we were we were baptizing in the Philippines one time after a set of meetings and a man a native man can't the the native Filipinos are not Asian that's who settled the island the native Filipinos are dark skinned they live up in the mountains and he actually come down walked for days to get to the meetings and sat in the meetings I didn't even know he understood English I don't know if he had an interpreter but at the end he wanted to be baptized and that man came when he stepped out to be baptized we realized this man's entire body was covered in sores and in and for and and I I don't know I'm not a doctor but I'm going to tell you every symptom suggest tested it with smallpox he was covered in them now that's supposed to be eliminated pretty much in the world but in those upper mountains that's what it looked like this man had little sores all head to toe when he come down in the water and brother walls baptized him in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that man came up with baby skin those sores literally washed right off of him see so don't I already know you've come too late to tell me God don't keep his word you know I had an I had an 80 year old lady come up you'd think you know why would God here she is 80. why don't she just be happy with what she's gotten going to be with the Lord but God cares about 80 year olds my mother's 81 and I'm glad he cares about her and she'd come up blind and we prayed a prayer for her one of one of her eyes was completely blood blind she couldn't see out of it at all and this eye was not doing so good and this one was totally blind and we just prayed a simple prayer for her that night in the meeting and she went home she left the prayer line still blind but that doesn't matter that never matters see she she comes back the next night when we're walking up and I'm walking up into the building big big Auditorium and and the translators with me and all of a sudden you wouldn't think an 80 year old woman could run Here Comes This lady running screaming and as soon as I saw her coming I knew what must have happened and she come rolling up speaking and speaking in Russian and and she she she she's doing this right here and she's going you know and I just started praising God and she's telling the translator and the translator said oh my brother Jason last night after you prayed she went back to her room and she went to bed and in the middle of the night a light came into her room and went inside her eye and came back out and now she can see Hallelujah God keeps his word friend to tell you he's reliable you can believe him for anything so I've seen cases where we laid hands we had a beautiful five-year-old little girl beautiful oh my goodness she was Mongolian she had dark hair and big dark eyes and just a beautiful little child and and was having two and three epileptic seizures a day five years old broke my heart and even though even under medication she couldn't they couldn't get under control and her mom and dad had came from from uh um charismatic movement and they were starting to look at the message and they were starting to read the books and you could tell they were very astute and very highly educated and they were very dressed very fine she was in very expensive clothes and they just brought her up into the prayer line and you know what I just prayed a simple prayer listen there was no thunderclaps or lightning flashes I just simply commanded the devil to leave her she was healed that instant she stopped having seizures that moment and she didn't need medicine anymore she walked up Bound by a devil and without any Fanfare Christ kicked him out I'm here to tell you something friends he can kick him out of your life he can kick him out of your situation so they've come too late to tell me they come to tell me this message ain't true you're too late buddy you're too late I don't seen God perform yes so I've seen all of those kinds of things I could stand here all night in in years of traveling the world Miracle after Miracle after Miracle but now I was in Moscow in night in 2018 or 19 I can't remember as there was brother Sergey you can you can write to him to get his testimony he's the one who gave it to me this came from the pastor straight to me and when we when we started when we started the services brother Jack right after the first service brother Sergey came to me and said brother Jason an amazing thing happened tonight yeah you know with with healing and deliverance and I said well that's wonderful but I didn't I didn't we didn't call it a prayer line we didn't pray for anybody he said no it was while you were preaching and I thought about the book of Acts while Peter yet spake these words and I said what happened he goes there were several people who had been battling disease and sickness and while you were preaching the word they stood up healed completely and he said they're totally healed and I said my that's a that's wonderful the very next night same thing happened again the very next night same thing happened again young people who had been seeking the Holy Ghost were standing up full of Holy Ghost people who had been bound and and all kinds of of weaknesses in their lives and bound by evil spirits stood up free we I there was a man who came in off the street when he walked in off the street I would brother Jack he was a sinner and he had been in a far City and he was drugs and alcohol and spent all his money and his last rubles his last rubles something told him get on a train and go to this city where we were holding the meetings and he got off the train he has nothing he's just walking down the street and he walks past our building and he hears uh he hears uh singing and he comes walking into the building and by the time he walks in I'm not even preaching I'm just reading my text I'm just reading my Bible I'm reading the text and that man threw his hands up and hit the floor and gave his heart to the Lord on the spot [Music] and he said God is in this place and I want a part of that God in my life and that and the Lord turned his life around let me tell you something friends God can turn your life around and it doesn't take him very long Hallelujah he can do it in five minutes and I was standing there and and then the third night and then the fourth night and it just kept happening it kept happening Brother Jack we lost count how many people were coming up saying I've had this for years I'm free I've had this for years I'm free I've had this for years I'm free and on the last night the very last night after after the uh it was actually the next morning it was the Sunday morning service we had Services leading up to the Sunday and I finished preaching I never called a prayer line I didn't need to I never even called one just just that preaching and and after the Sunday service there was an elderly lady who came with brother Sergey with the pastor because the story was a little strange and I think brother Sergey knew it would make me feel better if he actually related the story and this woman was elderly I would she was certainly older than me not as old as my mom but somewhere uh in that in that range and this poor woman had been bound by a spirit of dark debilitating depression and oppressiveness and she had been that way for years and she couldn't shake it she's been to doctors and had medicines and had all kinds of treatments and and and and and and nothing would help her and she just she walked around in a Perpetual Darkness she had a dream one night she fell asleep and in the dream now she's telling me this through the pastor and the pastor's relating the story to me that in the dream she found herself in a in a basement in Pitch Black she said there were no windows no doors no lights I couldn't see the hand waving in front of my face and she said I was going along the wall trying to feel where am I where what's going on how how did I get down here and she couldn't see no way out and she said something come over her and she started crying out Jason help me Jason help me and when she said that a light from up high suddenly appeared and she looked up and it was a door that had been opened and there was a little girl standing there looking at her and there was a spiral staircase in the very middle she couldn't see in the dark I actually think that the dream was pretty much self-explanatory I think that that that that little girl was her and that's where she caught that see somehow she got trapped down in that basement and she said she took her opportunity and ran while that light was shining and she hit the stead the spiral staircase and up and up and up and up and she burst through the door and woke up she thought to herself why would I dream such a dream and who why would I cry out Jason help me I don't know it Jason and then she thought to herself she said you know I remember years ago there wasn't a young American preacher named Jason something who came to Family Camp and it's about probably 15 years prior to this and she said that's the only Jason I've ever heard of she said I wonder she said I went around my house seeing if I had an old tape anywhere of those Services he said I had nothing and she said I sit down on the couch and wondered why would I have this strange dream and call out Jason help me and she said in my phone rang and it was her friend in Moscow and she said guess who's coming to preach our family camp in Moscow she says who Jason Watkins from America she said I've just had a dream and in the dream I was calling out now you can understand how that made me feel a little awkward a little awkward I'm glad she was elderly and I'm glad the pastor was the one telling me the story all right I just had to start backing up a little bit but but but she was so sincere in it and she was telling that her friend said oh you must come out and she said well I have no money she said I'll send you the train ticket I'll send it to you you must come to the meetings and she came and she had been there the first night second night third night and all these people about rounder jumping up healed and she sat there in her darkness and on the last day on Sunday morning and I don't remember now what I couldn't tell you for anything what I was preaching and all of a sudden while I yet spake these words she said suddenly the darkness shattered over the top of her the light broke through and she stood to her feet for the first time in 40 years free and she was free she said I don't mean light at the end of the tunnel I mean I was out I was free and I left her free and she's still free and I'm here to tell you while he spanked these words the Holy Ghost fell I don't know what your problem might be tonight but while the word is going forward I'm here to tell you something friends there's power in the word of God it's a Living Word and he wants you to live it how are we doing got 20 more minutes so when we think about the inheritance of the Saints you know you don't want to give away an inheritance and and you know when when Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence he used a a very archaic old word called unalienable now we changed it modern day we call it inalienable means the same thing he wrote in the original wording the unalienable rights that we we have certain unalienable rights and that we are endowed by our creator see and unalienable means that that it it basically means that that no one needs to give you permission no one can take it from you you don't have to ask it's your unalienable right given to you by God and so we have these unalienable rights because of the purchase price that Jesus Paid at Calvary and these rights are I I want to really emphasize this to you tonight that unalienable means natural and legal so Jefferson wasn't just declaring a legal document I'm not just saying you know legally King George legally we have the right to be free people but what he was saying is we have unalienable rights that are given to us by our creator and we don't need your permission right we don't need any validation God gave it to us it is my inheritance and I'm here to tell you something friends you have an inheritance at Calvary and I just say to the devil don't try to hold me back from my unalienable rights purchase for me and Calvary it's your inheritance to be healed is your inheritance to be delivered as your inheritance to be free to have the Holy Ghost to have your nature changed it's your inheritance [Music] Hallelujah I have a right to be healed I have a right to be delivered I have a right to be free from sin Hallelujah I'm not here to beg God for it it's already mine Hallelujah this is exactly why we needed the full word we had to have the full word and the Saints this is this is this is this was the real problem and I and I I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this because I don't wanna I don't want to go down the line but you know I grew up in this message and my parents were in the meetings of brother Branham and I grew up at the Branham Tabernacle and I saw all the camps rise up and I saw these super preachers and brother Branham kept telling us don't chase supers don't do that but it's human nature to do that and this super preacher and this super camp and this super preacher and this super Doctrine and this super and my goodness the whole the whole message through the 70s was being divided into camps now granted they had a lot of wonderful people in them and a lot of those men of God were great men of God running with a partial understanding when they should have waited for it to mature there's there's not any of those camps that didn't have a truth that it was based on I get that I understand that the problem that I had then and the problem I have now with any Kingdom Builder type Ministry who's trying to build a kingdom to himself is here's what here's one common denominator that all of those camps had in common they had various doctrines and various angles on various doctrines various ways of going about things various worship various this various that but one of the things they all had in common was they told you and gave you what you must believe and they not only told you what you must believe but they fixed limits on what you could not believe and therefore this is our camp and you need to believe everything inside of here and don't go outside of this circle or you're not or you're out of the word well I'm here to tell you something friends I never needed their permission to believe God I never needed their permission to accept my inheritance I never needed their permission to believe that I could be free that I could be full of the Holy Ghost and I couldn't believe all the word of God I didn't need it then I don't need it now whom the son is made free is free indeed Hallelujah okay amen hallelujah and this is where we come to friends tonight the challenge of faith the challenge to believe every word of God and we're some messed up people we are I mean if you think about everything that's made you you up to this point I mean things we inherited by our heredity brother man talks about that he talks about a man who comes up in a prayer line and the man suffering a lot of anxiety and worrying he says now he says I I see that one of the problems you have sir is you're always crossing a bridge before you get to it see he says now you get that from your mother that came to you through through heredity and then you know he got it here's a lady and he talks about her he goes right into his own family and uh brother Jack I don't know if you knew it but those quotes you were reading about that young man that brother Brandon was saying you know I think it was you who was saying the young man should never get married and uh and and and and and and what was happening was he said because he's got the nature of his dad and his dad is of his whole his dad's whole family that whole tribe are Fighters and drunks and killers and the mother and her whole clan were from Germany and they were very arrogant and they never would apologize and this boy had the double barrel shotgun of it all right he had both of them now brother Brandon was saying that to the dad he said now you're not like that and to the mother you're not like that you're not like your family sir you're not like your family now the way brother random knew that is this young man was his nephew and the man was his brother and the woman was the mother was his sister-in-law I didn't know if you knew that I started to tell you that at Family Care I mean at at men's meeting and that's how brother Branham could speak so authoritatively this is how he knew their family see he come from this Man's family he said you know we're all a bunch of Fighters and drunks brandons are always that way wow see he said but now you're not like that she's not like that she's sweet and humble and you're sweet and humble he said what did that the Holy Ghost see now you're not living your life you're living the life of Christ and he says now this young man's got to have that same experience or I'd recommend he never get married or he'll make some girl's life on a hell on Earth he'll make her life hell on Earth see because he and his dad said well Bill I know my son has has given his heart to the Lord and brother Brown said yes mentally he has but he's got to have that hard experience I'm here to tell you something friends you can't just be convinced of it you got to be revelated it's got to become a living reality this is a Living Word and God wants to live it in you my God Amen so we have things that we inherit in our heredity we have our various temperaments and I want to get into all of that those are all sermons brother Beckett is an expert in those things we have our birth sign we have our I mean those things affect your life we have our raising see we have our social culture that we were raised in that's right you know and then as we grow older into adulthood we have our educational and our political and our religious influences and it all just piles up yeah I'll tell you something if it weren't for God we're just some broken people the world is filled with broken people and and and how much how many zeros are in your bank account don't matter millionaires still jump out of 50-story Windows movie stars and sports stars with all the fortune and glory and the fame and everything they could want burn their life out and kill themselves yeah wow the world has gone insane and there's only one place of sanity and that's the mind of Christ see but the Bible says let this mind be in you in other words allow it permit it the Bible says in another place let the word of God dwell in you richly allow the word of God to dwell in you richly and so we find I I was reminded about when Solomon built was building the Temple and of course the temple the Tabernacle in the wilderness the temple it was all foretelling Christ when God would come and live in a temple but then ultimately it was also his bride his body because that's what Peter says your Lively Stones you're the Temple of the Living God brother Brandon preached you're the brother Brad and preach that that you're the Tabernacle of the living God's presence see and so so we are Lively Stones we're built up we're a habitation of the Holy Ghost so when so when it's not a stretch then to see Solomon building his Temple and he's got all of these parts that David his father has put together and laid out all the material but Solomon don't know how to build it he don't know how to put it all aparts and pieces together and so he writes a letter to the king of tire and he says listen you are friends with my dad and and there's nobody like the cydonians who are skilled and cutting of of rock and and gems and blue and purple and all of these things you guys are are artists and you're you're you're anointed and I need you to any and he writes to the king he says you know this Temple must be great it's going to it's going to be the dwelling place of God and how can I even begin to approach it and I and I and I got all these parts and all these pieces but I don't know how to fix it and arrange it all and he says to him send me therefore a man skilled and cunning and cutting and gems and stones and blues and purples a man who who understands how the parts go because the parts the temple is representing you and I'm here to tell you something friends God put you here but you got a bunch of scattered parts and I don't know maybe they came by hereditary maybe they came by social maybe they came by political maybe they came by religious maybe there's your birth sign maybe it's your temperament I don't know I just know this I need somebody who understands me somebody who could come and take all the pieces and fix me and put me together Hallelujah friends that's what this word has done in this hour God has sent a message and a messenger to do what to put the pieces together [Music] brother Branham said Faith finds a source that others don't see Faith finds a source and the message persevere and he preached it a bunch of times this is June 1964. he in perseverance Faith finds a source that others don't see I think about the scription I'm going to close with this for God who commanded this is second Corinthians 4. verse 6 for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness hath shined in our hearts to do what to give light to give light so there's a purpose behind it you understand he had shined in our hearts to give light amen of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ see you are his glory you are the manifestation of his life that was the that was always the plan see but we have this treasure in Earthen vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us here's an honest confession I think we could all relate to we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body for we which live are always delivered unto death for Jesus's sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh say brother Jason stand with me have my musicians come back let me let me just I'm just going to push a pause button tonight and uh there's no way to finish this I've got this whole burden we'll carry on with it tomorrow but let me let me just push a pause button after this and you can just play sister whatever just something softly please it's a fair question when we read these passages for we which live are always delivered unto death for Jesus sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh how it's a fair question to say how can I possibly brother Jason you just don't know the battles that I'm battling you don't know what's happened in my life and you'd be right I don't but he does the one who I represent here tonight the one who's who led me to accept the invitation of brother Jack the one who has dealt with my heart for days the one who has who woke me up early this morning at 3 30 and began dealing with me in a very special way for this service tonight knowing each one of you that would be here in this service I don't know what brought you here I don't know what you're facing when you leave here but I'm here to tell you something friend God who's rich in Mercy I believe with all my heart in this service tonight I don't care what is your Affliction or what your bondage you can leave here delivered you can leave here free if you'll accept it God has dealt with me very strangely all day long flying coming laying in the motel studying preparing praying has dealt with me and I I have felt that that this is how what I wanted to deliver to you tonight say brother Jason how can I possibly get victory in these battles and I read to you the answer for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness that same God you know why that light shined out of Darkness because God commanded it God commanded the light to shine out of Darkness I'm here to tell you something friends
