[1:16:34] people lord
[1:16:36] somebody
[1:16:38] had to be a witness and you've chosen us
[1:16:40] to be a witness in this end time father
[1:16:43] so we do it by faith in jesus christ's
[1:16:45] name bless us all
[1:16:47] in jesus christ name we pray and ask it
[1:16:48] amen saint mark 11 22
[1:16:52] amen it says then jesus answered
[1:16:54] answering saith unto them
[1:16:57] have faith
[1:16:58] in god
[1:16:59] for verily i say unto you that whosoever
[1:17:01] shall say unto this
[1:17:03] mountain
[1:17:05] be thou removed and be thou cast into
[1:17:07] the sea and shall not doubt in his heart
[1:17:11] but shall believe that those things
[1:17:13] which he said shall come to pass
[1:17:15] he shall have whatsoever he saith
[1:17:18] therefore i say unto you that whatsoever
[1:17:20] things you desire when you pray believe
[1:17:24] that ye receive them
[1:17:26] and he shall have them
[1:17:28] and when you stand praying
[1:17:31] forgive
[1:17:32] if you have ought against any that your
[1:17:34] father also which is in heaven may
[1:17:35] forgive you your trespasses but if you

[1:17:40] neither will your father which is in
[1:17:42] heaven forgive your trespasses let's go
[1:17:45] to first john chapter 3.
[1:17:50] amen it says verse 21
[1:17:54] beloved if our heart condemned us not
[1:17:59] then have we confidence toward god
[1:18:02] and whatsoever we ask we receive of him
[1:18:06] because we keep his commitments
[1:18:08] and do those things that are pleasing in
[1:18:12] his sight
[1:18:13] may god add his blessing to the reading

[1:18:17] morning
[1:18:19] amen amen how many loves the word of god
[1:18:23] amen praise the lord we want to take for
[1:18:26] a subject from this portion that we read
[1:18:29] in those two places if we can draw for a
[1:18:32] subject this morning
[1:18:33] we want to subject this
[1:18:35] unhindered faith
[1:18:39] unhindered
[1:18:40] faith
[1:18:42] that is the kind of a faith the bride
[1:18:44] must have in this hour
[1:18:47] is a faith that's unhindered by
[1:18:50] circumstance
[1:18:52] it's a faith that's unhindered by
[1:18:55] symptoms
[1:18:57] we live in a world today where sin is
[1:18:59] bold
[1:19:01] satan is bold
[1:19:03] so it takes a people of god
[1:19:05] to stand with boldness
[1:19:07] by the word of god
[1:19:09] unhindered faith
[1:19:11] do you know what type of faith that is
[1:19:13] that is the faith of god
[1:19:15] by the holy spirit in his bride
[1:19:19] that's what we need
[1:19:21] because if we're to go to a rapture
[1:19:22] we've got to have faith to go to the
[1:19:24] rapture
[1:19:26] we've got to have rapturing faith
[1:19:28] we've got to have it
[1:19:31] i want to set the scene for you this
[1:19:32] morning
[1:19:34] a prophet says in the message a super
[1:19:36] sense
[1:19:38] he says
[1:19:39] and we are grateful to god that we have
[1:19:42] the five senses
[1:19:44] we've got five senses god give us five
[1:19:45] senses
[1:19:47] but by no means was these five senses
[1:19:49] given to you to guide you
[1:19:54] you see where a lot of us already fall
[1:19:56] short
[1:19:57] we're letting these five senses lead us
[1:20:01] and as long as we're being guided by
[1:20:03] these five senses
[1:20:04] we've got to fail
[1:20:08] but he says
[1:20:10] they were given to you
[1:20:12] for earthly contact
[1:20:15] but there was giving you the sixth sense
[1:20:19] oh my let the church say amen
[1:20:22] but there was giving to you the sixth
[1:20:25] sense
[1:20:26] and that sixth sense
[1:20:28] is belongs to the christian
[1:20:31] only to the christian
[1:20:33] and you cannot have that sick sense
[1:20:36] until you become a christian
[1:20:41] so we want to talk to the christians
[1:20:43] this morning
[1:20:44] and we want to cut bring such a
[1:20:46] conviction on you
[1:20:48] if you're not a christian to come into
[1:20:50] the kingdom of god
[1:20:53] because when christ is returning for
[1:20:55] what
[1:20:56] his body of believers
[1:20:58] which is his bride
[1:21:00] amen and the only way you get into that
[1:21:03] kingdom is by a holy ghost baptism
[1:21:06] you see but that was given to you a
[1:21:08] sixth sense
[1:21:09] and that sixth sense
[1:21:11] is belong only to the christian and you
[1:21:14] cannot have this sixth sense until you
[1:21:18] become a christian
[1:21:20] don't matter how much goods you you
[1:21:22] devote to the poor it don't matter how
[1:21:24] much money you you you give to the
[1:21:26] charity that means nothing
[1:21:29] you've got to be a christian
[1:21:32] if you want to make it up there you've
[1:21:34] got to come into the kingdom of god
[1:21:40] and you cannot have this sixth sense
[1:21:42] until you become a christian is the only
[1:21:44] way that you can ever have any more than
[1:21:46] the five natural senses
[1:21:48] for the natural person but the sixth
[1:21:51] sense is better known to the christian
[1:21:52] as faith
[1:21:55] it's the one that governs and guides you
[1:22:00] and it is superior
[1:22:02] to all the other senses
[1:22:06] the sense of sight will fail
[1:22:08] the sense of hearing will fail
[1:22:10] but faith is absolute
[1:22:13] faith has hair on his chest
[1:22:16] faith is unwavering
[1:22:18] faith never gets excited
[1:22:21] faith is not afraid
[1:22:23] you never saw jesus excited
[1:22:25] did you ever read the bible and it says
[1:22:27] jesus was excited
[1:22:29] on the troubled sea
[1:22:32] with the winds tossing to and fro
[1:22:35] jesus just slept in the boat he wasn't
[1:22:38] shook by the circumstance
[1:22:42] jesus was never excited why because he
[1:22:44] had perfect faith
[1:22:47] and the bible says in this super sense
[1:22:49] is the holy spirit the faith of god
[1:22:54] that dwells in you
[1:22:58] the sixth sense
[1:22:59] is the holy spirit which is the faith of
[1:23:03] god that dwells in you
[1:23:07] you say that's against my faith what
[1:23:08] kind of faith do you have
[1:23:10] because there's only one true faith
[1:23:13] and that's the spirit of god the faith
[1:23:16] of god that dwells in you
[1:23:20] when the spirit of god comes in you it
[1:23:22] gives you a supersense
[1:23:27] the doctor said i'm sick
[1:23:30] but the sixth sense says by his stripes
[1:23:36] he was wounded
[1:23:37] he was bruised
[1:23:39] and with his stripes
[1:23:41] we are healed
[1:23:42] see we're not going to be healed we're
[1:23:45] already here
[1:23:49] if you're gonna have the victory it's
[1:23:51] got to be right now
[1:23:53] don't wait for the millennium to have
[1:23:54] the victory
[1:23:55] if you want the victory god paid the
[1:23:58] price
[1:24:04] if god paid the price
[1:24:06] why are you trying to pay it again
[1:24:08] your works mean nothing
[1:24:11] your works prove your faith
[1:24:13] but if your works is not by the word of
[1:24:15] god you have the wrong works
[1:24:18] jesus paid the price
[1:24:20] to give the bride a faith
[1:24:22] unhindered faith
[1:24:24] unmovable face
[1:24:26] that in the face of sin
[1:24:28] faith will stand still
[1:24:34] but you know that type of faith
[1:24:36] can only be built
[1:24:39] on spiritual revelation
[1:24:42] that kind of faith that the bride should
[1:24:44] have you should have it
[1:24:46] there should be no excuse why in july
[1:24:50] 2022 that if you profess to be the bride
[1:24:53] that you don't have that perfect faith
[1:24:57] it comes by the holy ghost
[1:25:00] you've got to have that perfect faith
[1:25:03] if you don't have it don't worry about
[1:25:05] going to the rapture
[1:25:07] it's not for you
[1:25:09] but that type of faith is built upon
[1:25:11] spiritual revelation
[1:25:13] of who christ is
[1:25:16] not what the pastor says but what god
[1:25:19] reveals
[1:25:20] individually to you
[1:25:23] oh yeah i heard my mom said that he is
[1:25:25] christ
[1:25:26] i heard our pastor said he is christ but
[1:25:29] if you don't know it
[1:25:32] you're not made you didn't make it yet
[1:25:36] and it's time for the bride
[1:25:38] to put that sick sense into action
[1:25:42] why do we come sick
[1:25:44] and leave sick
[1:25:46] why do we come bound and leave bound
[1:25:50] when we come in the presence of jehovah
[1:25:52] god
[1:25:53] he is the same yesterday today and
[1:25:56] forever
[1:26:00] there's enough faith in this room
[1:26:03] to speak another world into existence
[1:26:06] and go live in it
[1:26:08] but the only thing that keeps us from
[1:26:10] doing that is the word of god
[1:26:12] god does everything by his word
[1:26:15] god's word is his law
[1:26:17] if i may create a word and go live in it
[1:26:19] what happens to the millennium
[1:26:21] god has a purpose god has a plan
[1:26:24] but there should be enough faith in the
[1:26:26] bride to shake the world
[1:26:30] there's enough unbelief in the world
[1:26:33] there's enough sin in the world
[1:26:36] there's enough hypocrisy in the world
[1:26:39] then there's got to be faith in the
[1:26:41] bride
[1:26:42] [Music]
[1:26:46] a brother says the sixth sense comes for
[1:26:48] this reason only
[1:26:49] that was to make the five senses in you
[1:26:54] deny
[1:26:55] anything that's contrary to god's word
[1:26:58] it don't matter what it don't matter
[1:27:00] what anybody else says
[1:27:01] if it's contrary to god's word don't
[1:27:04] believe that
[1:27:06] the sickness in you shall let you know
[1:27:08] that's a lie
[1:27:11] the bride has got to have that sixth
[1:27:13] sense
[1:27:14] see the power of god is down in the
[1:27:16] bride
[1:27:17] the power of god is not going to come in
[1:27:19] the bride it's in the bride
[1:27:21] it's the promise of god the greater
[1:27:24] works we should do
[1:27:26] see the disciples after pentecost had
[1:27:29] that sick sense that unhindered faith
[1:27:33] enough to give eternal life to as many
[1:27:36] as believers
[1:27:39] not only to cast out devils
[1:27:41] not only to lay hands on the sick and
[1:27:43] they shall recover
[1:27:44] but the power of god is in the bride
[1:27:46] right now
[1:27:47] to give eternal life
[1:27:50] to those who will receive it
[1:27:54] see the power of god is not coming it's
[1:27:56] here
[1:27:58] but the issue is there is a lack of
[1:28:01] faith in the people to make the word of
[1:28:03] god move
[1:28:05] because the only way god's word is going
[1:28:07] to move is by faith
[1:28:09] you can't move you can't make it move by
[1:28:11] into by your intellectual intellectual
[1:28:13] faith
[1:28:17] don't matter how much you pray if you
[1:28:18] don't believe it it's not going to
[1:28:19] happen
[1:28:21] you've got to believe
[1:28:23] you speak to the mountain then believe
[1:28:25] it's going to move
[1:28:27] [Applause]
[1:28:29] amen
[1:28:31] let me read you something here i said
[1:28:32] this with the church last time i let me
[1:28:34] run over it again
[1:28:36] it says imperfect faith says he had
[1:28:38] faith jesus had faith with his power
[1:28:40] how did he he said i can do nothing to
[1:28:42] myself
[1:28:43] why he relied upon what he was
[1:28:46] jesus christ relied upon what he was
[1:28:51] watching closely he relied in knowing
[1:28:53] that he was the word
[1:28:57] and he has faith in god
[1:29:00] who made him the word he was god the
[1:29:02] word and there was in him and that gave
[1:29:04] him faith because he understood his
[1:29:07] position
[1:29:09] jesus christ was the word
[1:29:11] he had faith in the word that made him
[1:29:13] the word
[1:29:14] and he understood his position
[1:29:19] don't let that devil lay around in your
[1:29:20] life
[1:29:22] you've got the power to move him out of
[1:29:24] the way
[1:29:26] see
[1:29:28] and uh he says and they wasn't him and
[1:29:30] that
[1:29:31] let me go back just a little bit and he
[1:29:33] had faith in god who made him the word
[1:29:36] he was god the word and there was in him
[1:29:39] and that gave him faith because he
[1:29:41] understood his position
[1:29:43] he knowed what he was
[1:29:45] because the scripture had says what he
[1:29:47] was this and here every scripture tied
[1:29:50] in to prove that he was exactly
[1:29:53] what the scripture says
[1:29:57] if the scripture says that you are the
[1:29:58] bride your life should reflect what the
[1:30:02] word says about you
[1:30:06] and believe you me the world will always
[1:30:09] recognize a true believer
[1:30:12] because we're oddballs
[1:30:14] we're different from the crowd
[1:30:16] they can't understand us
[1:30:18] see the disciples could not understand
[1:30:21] how the ship was just about to turn over
[1:30:24] but jesus christ was rest asleep
[1:30:27] he had the unhindered faith
[1:30:30] he had that perfect faith
[1:30:32] he was that sixth sense
[1:30:34] and if christ is in his bride no matter
[1:30:38] what you see out there
[1:30:39] christ is in the ship
[1:30:41] be still ain't know that he is god
[1:30:46] therefore
[1:30:47] he relied upon what god had made him
[1:30:51] and if he did that
[1:30:54] if christ relied upon what god made him
[1:30:56] then can't we rely upon what god made us
[1:30:59] as believers
[1:31:02] see god
[1:31:04] predestinated us
[1:31:06] before you even sin
[1:31:09] god spoke that the lame will die
[1:31:11] and when god spoke that the lamb will
[1:31:13] die before the foundation of the world
[1:31:16] he associated your name with it
[1:31:20] before you was even before you was even
[1:31:22] conceived
[1:31:23] god had already forgiven you for all
[1:31:25] your sins
[1:31:27] so the devil is lying to you
[1:31:30] you're not condemned you're set free
[1:31:33] but you just don't know it yet
[1:31:36] you just don't know it yet but once you
[1:31:39] can recognize that god has paid the
[1:31:41] price
[1:31:42] god has paid the price you can go free
[1:31:49] if he can rely upon what god made him
[1:31:53] and if he did that
[1:31:54] then can we rely upon what god made us
[1:31:57] as believers
[1:32:00] see the plan has already been made
[1:32:03] and god is not going to go back and
[1:32:05] erase anything he wrote
[1:32:09] you're predestinated
[1:32:12] to eternal life
[1:32:14] that is the plan of god
[1:32:16] if you don't have eternal life it's
[1:32:18] because you have not received it just
[1:32:20] yet
[1:32:21] it's here for us but we have to have to
[1:32:23] have the faith but because he
[1:32:25] you have to have faith in god to receive
[1:32:28] anything from god
[1:32:31] amen
[1:32:33] praise be to our god no matter what we
[1:32:35] can be in this world
[1:32:37] the best thing for anyone to do
[1:32:39] is to come into the kingdom
[1:32:41] and be identified and take your
[1:32:44] identification with god in his spirit
[1:32:47] you've got to be identified the world is
[1:32:50] not ashamed to be identified of who they
[1:32:53] are
[1:32:54] look around they're not the same
[1:32:56] they're not the same
[1:32:58] they strip their clothes off to let you
[1:33:00] know i'm a prostitute
[1:33:03] they smoke and drink and do these things
[1:33:05] to let you know i'm a sinner
[1:33:08] so the bride must believe
[1:33:13] the bride got to believe
[1:33:15] and if you believe your works will prove
[1:33:17] your faith
[1:33:18] because faith without works is dead
[1:33:22] profession without a life is dead
[1:33:26] you may profess all you want to but the
[1:33:28] devil when he comes against you he know
[1:33:30] what is at him
[1:33:32] the devil knew he could not mess with
[1:33:34] christ
[1:33:35] that's the wrong one try them one time
[1:33:37] crush that it is written
[1:33:40] try them another time cross said it is
[1:33:42] rain
[1:33:43] came again christ said it is also rain
[1:33:49] so what brings the feet
[1:33:51] it's the word of god
[1:33:53] and the prophet tells us you'll become
[1:33:55] the word as you receive the word
[1:34:01] we gotta receive the word saints and
[1:34:04] everything that god has wrote in this
[1:34:06] book
[1:34:07] for us to fulfill it's our job to
[1:34:10] fulfill it
[1:34:14] amen
[1:34:16] you know the apostles
[1:34:17] they walk
[1:34:18] but they're unhindering faith
[1:34:22] after the day of pentecost
[1:34:23] there was nothing that could handle the
[1:34:25] apostles
[1:34:27] because that the god the christ that
[1:34:29] walked with them
[1:34:31] was now in them
[1:34:34] in the same way that jesus just rested
[1:34:36] upon what he was
[1:34:38] the apostles by the revelation who they
[1:34:41] was by the holy ghost
[1:34:43] began to have faith in who they were
[1:34:46] and that's what we need in this end time
[1:34:48] we've got to have the holy ghost in us
[1:34:50] our identification
[1:34:52] to make us to know who we are
[1:34:56] you can have all of this world's goods
[1:34:58] but if you don't recognize that you do
[1:35:01] you will live in poverty
[1:35:02] but when you can recognize that the god
[1:35:05] of all creation is your god
[1:35:09] waymaker
[1:35:11] miracle worker
[1:35:12] promise keeper
[1:35:14] oh hallelujah that's what he is
[1:35:18] god don't change
[1:35:20] see the problem is we worry too much
[1:35:22] we worry more than we have faith
[1:35:25] we think more that we have faith
[1:35:27] we reason more than we can have faith
[1:35:29] but if you can have faith you'll
[1:35:30] recognize who god is
[1:35:34] we'll live a defeated life because we
[1:35:36] fail to recognize what god is
[1:35:40] we fail to recognize who god is
[1:35:42] let me move forward it's 11 50. i'm
[1:35:44] watching my time this morning
[1:35:46] praise be to our god
[1:35:49] amen
[1:35:50] let's move on
[1:35:52] but you know jesus says here
[1:35:55] verse 24
[1:35:56] therefore i say unto you
[1:35:58] what things soever you desire when you
[1:36:00] pray
[1:36:02] amen believe that you receive them
[1:36:05] and ye shall have them
[1:36:08] now what's his next statement and when
[1:36:10] you stand praying
[1:36:12] forgive
[1:36:14] me
[1:36:15] when you stand and pray
[1:36:17] [Music]
[1:36:19] forgive me
[1:36:21] i'm not saying you're not a christian
[1:36:23] but what i'm saying is
[1:36:25] when you stay when you pray and stand
[1:36:27] praying
[1:36:28] if you're not forgiving
[1:36:30] your prayers will not be answered
[1:36:35] watch what he says
[1:36:37] if you do not forgive
[1:36:40] neither will your father which is the
[1:36:42] heaven forgive your trespasses
[1:36:44] so one of the greatest hindrances in the
[1:36:48] church of the living god
[1:36:50] is a lack of love
[1:36:54] love to forgive
[1:36:57] love to pardon pardon is a great thing
[1:37:00] it's the greatest thing that the
[1:37:01] believer has received his part in
[1:37:04] when you know you've done the sin
[1:37:08] you are guilty of it
[1:37:10] then you look in the word and it says
[1:37:12] the lamb was slave for your sin
[1:37:16] and the prophet comes and said that be
[1:37:17] the believer do not sin the christians
[1:37:20] don't have any sin because the seed of
[1:37:22] god remained in the believer
[1:37:25] so when the believer can recognize that
[1:37:27] his sins has been forgiven
[1:37:30] that's the greatest thing
[1:37:32] and jesus says the same way i've given
[1:37:35] you pardon
[1:37:37] you've got to give that same party
[1:37:41] and if you cannot pardon it will always
[1:37:44] hinder your prayer
[1:37:46] it will always hinder your faith
[1:37:50] you cannot have faith unless you have
[1:37:52] love
[1:37:54] the bible says faith and love is married
[1:37:57] and when faith and love is married you
[1:37:59] can ask what you will
[1:38:04] condemnation in your heart the prophet
[1:38:06] says
[1:38:07] condemnation in your heart
[1:38:09] and god will not come into that heart
[1:38:11] condemned
[1:38:13] see
[1:38:14] god don't dwell in that you got to make
[1:38:17] it right
[1:38:19] then when you do
[1:38:20] you must have faith
[1:38:24] don't have condemnation in your heart
[1:38:26] they come before the father for anything
[1:38:29] you know the prophet one time uh uh went
[1:38:31] to pray for a little girl we know the
[1:38:33] story real well
[1:38:35] but earlier that day
[1:38:37] he had made his wife to misrepresent
[1:38:39] something
[1:38:40] he was troubled by the tax situation he
[1:38:42] was going through and uh and the lawyer
[1:38:45] called her home and he ran at the house
[1:38:48] and told his wife say i'm not here
[1:38:52] then later on went and tried to pray for
[1:38:54] a little girl
[1:38:56] then there was condemnation in his heart
[1:38:59] and he knew that would handle his faith
[1:39:02] so he said stay right here
[1:39:04] i'll be back
[1:39:06] jesus taught the same thing
[1:39:09] if you come to the altar
[1:39:11] and realize that something is not right
[1:39:13] go and make it right they come back
[1:39:16] because without making it right
[1:39:18] if there's condemnation in your heart
[1:39:21] forget about it
[1:39:23] you cannot move god
[1:39:26] god will not build anything on the mess
[1:39:30] god will not build on sin
[1:39:32] if you want the movement of god if you
[1:39:35] want the revival of god if you want the
[1:39:37] faith of god
[1:39:38] you've got to have perfect love
[1:39:43] [Music]
[1:39:46] the bible says in 20 years of research
[1:39:48] of the bible
[1:39:50] and talking with the angel of the lord
[1:39:52] in the many things
[1:39:53] i find here is two things
[1:39:56] that is love
[1:39:58] and faith
[1:40:00] if you love god
[1:40:02] just purely unadulterated love
[1:40:05] you've got to have faith in him it'll
[1:40:08] accompany faith every time
[1:40:11] and when love and faith gets married you
[1:40:15] ask what you want to and you'll have it
[1:40:19] but you cannot receive because you
[1:40:22] refuse to forgive
[1:40:26] how are we going to go beyond the
[1:40:27] curtain of time
[1:40:29] where there is perfect love
[1:40:31] if we don't have it right here
[1:40:35] how are we going to spend millennium
[1:40:36] we're believers
[1:40:38] of perfect love
[1:40:40] if we can't forgive
[1:40:43] he stepped on my toes
[1:40:47] oh he did this he did that jesus said if
[1:40:49] they bring him before the law for your
[1:40:50] cult give him the cloak also
[1:40:54] as i prophe as the pastor said they
[1:40:56] stole your dog he took your dog buy you
[1:40:58] another dog
[1:40:59] [Applause]
[1:41:01] we're in america
[1:41:02] there's plenty of dogs to go around
[1:41:05] we're holding on to little small things
[1:41:08] things that mean absolutely nothing
[1:41:11] [Music]
[1:41:12] but we want to see god
[1:41:15] how is god going to come down on top of
[1:41:18] a mess
[1:41:20] god don't work by imperfection
[1:41:23] but god moves by perfection
[1:41:27] [Applause]
[1:41:33] you want to see god move
[1:41:35] get that divine love in your hearts
[1:41:38] you want to see god move
[1:41:40] you want your sick to be healed
[1:41:43] you want the gifts of god in the church
[1:41:45] repent today
[1:41:48] and watch god moves
[1:41:50] what's god move
[1:41:52] no matter what they did to christ they
[1:41:55] smote him they beat him he said father
[1:41:58] forgive them for they know not what they
[1:42:00] do
[1:42:02] so if christ is in my heart i've got to
[1:42:05] forgive i've got to repent i've got to
[1:42:08] make it right
[1:42:11] [Music]
[1:42:13] we think god is waiting on something
[1:42:15] else
[1:42:16] god is waiting on you
[1:42:20] we're waiting for the rapture
[1:42:22] we want a body change
[1:42:24] but god is waiting on you
[1:42:28] you are a royal priesthood
[1:42:31] a holy nation
[1:42:34] a holy nation
[1:42:36] we've got to be perfect saints
[1:42:39] and if we're going to be perfect then
[1:42:41] we've got to do it now
[1:42:43] if we're going to have love in the
[1:42:44] millennium we've got to have it now
[1:42:46] see the same ministry that jesus had
[1:42:50] he never took it away
[1:42:52] he gave it to the church
[1:42:55] he says greater work shall you do
[1:42:57] because i go into my father
[1:43:00] so if we're coming in here we're not
[1:43:02] seeing the move of god it's time to
[1:43:04] repent
[1:43:06] it's time to come to the altar and get
[1:43:08] that divine love in our hearts
[1:43:11] then it will bring faith to move god
[1:43:18] amen
[1:43:20] [Music]
[1:43:23] the prophet says in divine love he says
[1:43:26] if i say this to the little church
[1:43:28] that's prayed for me
[1:43:30] for the world mission
[1:43:32] that's my success in praying for the
[1:43:34] sick
[1:43:36] if i can't get down right down into the
[1:43:39] feeling of the sickness of with the
[1:43:40] person
[1:43:41] it usually doesn't do any good
[1:43:46] you've got to come right down to it's
[1:43:48] just you feel it yourself
[1:43:52] you've got to get down and put yourself
[1:43:54] in their shoes
[1:43:57] put yourself in their position
[1:44:00] in their place
[1:44:01] then pray for them
[1:44:03] then watch god move
[1:44:05] the bible says confess your false ones
[1:44:07] with another
[1:44:08] and pray one for another
[1:44:11] for the effectual fervent prayer of the
[1:44:13] righteous avenge much
[1:44:17] if we want god to move we've got to put
[1:44:20] ourselves in the position of the other
[1:44:22] one
[1:44:23] we've got to love our neighbors as
[1:44:25] ourselves
[1:44:28] when we get to the gates of heaven god
[1:44:30] is not going to give you time to repent
[1:44:33] now is the time to do it
[1:44:39] we want to see sinners get saved
[1:44:42] but we got to get right first
[1:44:44] how are we going to lay hands on the
[1:44:46] sick
[1:44:47] when that's come the national hearts
[1:44:50] how we expect to impart eternal life do
[1:44:53] you realize what that mean
[1:44:56] god did not just give us the power to
[1:44:58] lay hands on the sick
[1:45:00] but we've got the power to give eternal
[1:45:04] life
[1:45:06] to believers
[1:45:08] but how can you do it when there's sin
[1:45:10] and condemnation in your hearts
[1:45:14] we've got to watch it saints we've got
[1:45:16] to make it clean
[1:45:18] we've got to make it right
[1:45:20] it's time to get back in fellowship
[1:45:22] it's time to get back in perfect love
[1:45:27] we worry too much we're too sensitive
[1:45:31] we cry too much but it's time to have
[1:45:34] love with your faith
[1:45:37] that will move god
[1:45:39] that will bring a revival
[1:45:41] the church
[1:45:42] it's good to sing we love singing
[1:45:46] but what about our life
[1:45:48] where is the life
[1:45:49] where is the face that was once
[1:45:51] delivered to the saints
[1:45:56] this place shall be more filled than
[1:45:59] saint mary's
[1:46:01] because wherever jesus is
[1:46:03] there is life
[1:46:05] there is grace
[1:46:07] there is healing
[1:46:08] there is joy
[1:46:10] there is victory
[1:46:14] you don't need insurance
[1:46:16] you got it keep it but get faith
[1:46:19] get faith with your insurance
[1:46:22] god is waiting on us
[1:46:25] god is waiting on us saints
[1:46:29] we've got to clean up
[1:46:32] we sing
[1:46:33] but there's no life
[1:46:35] we shout but there's no life
[1:46:38] we've got to take god's word
[1:46:40] believe god's word
[1:46:42] and let god be made manifest in us
[1:46:46] but he cannot manifest
[1:46:48] if we're not in the word
[1:46:52] amen the mountain cannot move if you
[1:46:55] don't forgive
[1:46:56] the mountain cannot move if you don't
[1:46:58] believe
[1:47:00] you've got to have that perfect love
[1:47:05] i believe you got it this morning
[1:47:08] i believe the faith is here right now
[1:47:11] i believe the bride can receive
[1:47:12] whatsoever they ask for
[1:47:15] because god is here to give it to you
[1:47:18] amen
[1:47:20] let me skip down a little bit here to
[1:47:22] the scripture
[1:47:23] praise be to the lord jesus christ do
[1:47:25] you love him this morning
[1:47:27] amen
[1:47:28] it's time to take the limit off of god
[1:47:31] you've got to realize when you refuse to
[1:47:33] keep god's word when you refuse to walk
[1:47:36] in love
[1:47:37] you limit god
[1:47:40] you handcuff god
[1:47:43] god can only move according to your
[1:47:45] faith
[1:47:47] no matter how much he died on the cross
[1:47:50] but if you don't receive his pardoning
[1:47:52] grace it will never be to you
[1:47:55] and that's the thing that moves the that
[1:47:57] hinders the move of god in his bride is
[1:48:00] a lack of faith
[1:48:02] a lack of love
[1:48:09] but the bible says i'd rather
[1:48:11] be wrong in my doctrine
[1:48:14] and right in my heart
[1:48:17] god will respect it more
[1:48:20] so if amen is wrong
[1:48:23] what of it
[1:48:24] help him
[1:48:26] he needs help
[1:48:27] love him
[1:48:30] do you realize
[1:48:31] when jesus christ was being crucified
[1:48:34] when they put a thorn a crown of thorn
[1:48:36] on his head
[1:48:38] mistreated him
[1:48:39] capital punishment
[1:48:42] it wasn't a joke
[1:48:43] it wasn't an act
[1:48:45] christ suffered but still had grace in
[1:48:48] his heart to say father forgive them
[1:48:53] enough love in his heart
[1:48:57] to save the world
[1:48:59] see christ had enough faith to raise the
[1:49:02] dead
[1:49:03] the enough love to wash feet
[1:49:10] enough love to move the world
[1:49:12] enough faith to do miracles
[1:49:16] cast out devils
[1:49:19] but enough love to say father forgive
[1:49:20] them
[1:49:21] for they know not what they do
[1:49:24] that spirit is in the bride
[1:49:26] that spirit should be in the church
[1:49:31] so what of it help him he needs help
[1:49:33] love him
[1:49:34] if you can't love your enemy in this the
[1:49:37] same as you love those who love you
[1:49:39] you're no better off than republicans
[1:49:42] that's right that's what the church has
[1:49:45] failed
[1:49:46] to get
[1:49:47] i hope you get it this morning he says
[1:49:49] i hope you see what i'm talking about is
[1:49:51] back to love
[1:49:53] redeeming love
[1:49:55] all the other things are fine but we've
[1:49:57] got to come back
[1:49:59] to fellowship
[1:50:00] with one another
[1:50:02] we've got to do it
[1:50:04] it's time that the brides start digging
[1:50:06] in their lives
[1:50:09] we're getting more rich
[1:50:11] but not more faith
[1:50:13] more busy but not more love
[1:50:15] there's enough distractions in the world
[1:50:18] but not enough time for god
[1:50:20] but god wants your fellowship
[1:50:23] he wants your love
[1:50:25] and you can't have fellowship with god
[1:50:26] unless you have fellowship with your
[1:50:27] brother
[1:50:29] you can't have faith in god unless you
[1:50:30] have love in your brother or for your
[1:50:32] brother
[1:50:35] it's time to get back to redeeming love
[1:50:37] so it's time this morning
[1:50:40] there's not much else that need to be
[1:50:41] said
[1:50:42] you want faith
[1:50:44] you want the mountain to move you want
[1:50:46] god to answer you've got to love
[1:50:48] and after you have love and dig out
[1:50:51] everything that's not of god out of you
[1:50:53] then have faith
[1:50:55] and god will answer
[1:50:57] you know the children of israel went to
[1:50:58] battle one time against moab
[1:51:01] and they got to a certain place where
[1:51:02] there was no water
[1:51:05] and they called the prophet elisha
[1:51:07] and elijah got the word of the lord he
[1:51:09] says
[1:51:10] dig you ditches in this valley
[1:51:14] you want water dig your ditches
[1:51:16] you want the divine love of god dig out
[1:51:20] that old root of bitterness
[1:51:23] stop being so bitter
[1:51:26] stop
[1:51:28] those unclean things
[1:51:31] because that will bring the power of god
[1:51:34] in the heart of the believer
[1:51:36] it's time that the church get desperate
[1:51:39] because god is only waiting on one thing
[1:51:42] for the bride to make herself ready
[1:51:46] we've got some more with that unhindered
[1:51:48] love
[1:51:49] by unhindered faith
[1:51:51] in the word of god
[1:51:53] we've got to have his saints
[1:51:56] that's what i have for you this morning
[1:51:58] back to love
[1:52:00] back to your divine faith
[1:52:03] and god will move
[1:52:05] god will heal
[1:52:07] god will fight for you
[1:52:09] paul says i have fought a good fight
[1:52:12] i finished my course
[1:52:14] i've kept the face
[1:52:17] the same faith that was in the apostles
[1:52:20] christ have to find that same faith
[1:52:24] god has is coming to only receive
[1:52:27] those who is walking by that perfect
[1:52:30] love
[1:52:31] by perfect faith
[1:52:33] and his perfect word
[1:52:35] let's stand this morning
[1:52:43] let the musicians come
[1:52:44] [Applause]
[1:52:52] the prophet says
[1:52:53] real faith
[1:52:55] knows no defeat
[1:52:57] it cannot be defeated
[1:52:59] even death itself can't defeat it
[1:53:03] it knows no defeat
[1:53:05] trials no defeat
[1:53:07] but faith
[1:53:08] knows no defeat
[1:53:10] it cannot be defeated
[1:53:12] and it is the only way
[1:53:15] that you can please god
[1:53:17] for without faith
[1:53:19] it is impossible
[1:53:21] to please god
[1:53:22] let us pray father
[1:53:25] we present ourselves to you this morning
[1:53:28] and we for ask for forgiveness

[2:01:39] unhindered faith
[2:01:42] and um
[2:01:44] i trust that it didn't go over your your
[2:01:47] head i believe god just dropped
[2:01:49] something off brother brother branham
[2:01:50] told us that god was hidden and revealed
[2:01:53] in simplicity
[2:01:55] and god just dropped something off uh to
[2:01:57] let us know that what unhinders our
[2:01:59] faith is when we can forgive
[2:02:02] amen i was i learned something a long
[2:02:05] time ago
[2:02:06] uh forgive is to set the prisoner free
[2:02:11] only to realize that you were the
[2:02:13] prisoner
[2:02:14] [Music]
[2:02:15] so forgiveness actually sets you free
[2:02:19] it unhinders your faith
[2:02:22] cause god to move on your behalf so
[2:02:24] brother mike god bless you and amen

[2:03:36] a scripture turn in 80 you'll be 80
[2:03:39] years old tomorrow and oftentimes i like
[2:03:41] to try to go and find
[2:03:43] a verse in the bible that with the
[2:03:45] number eight is somehow associated with
[2:03:47] it because there's not many of them
[2:03:49] with 80
[2:03:51] 80 uh
[2:03:52] verses or 80 chapters ain't many in
[2:03:54] there amen so it's a milestone for amen
[2:03:58] brother let's go to reach this amen this
[2:04:00] this point and we just thank god for how
[2:04:02] he's kept them all all through the years
[2:04:04] and amen we just appreciate what we see
[2:04:06] the lord doing continuously in his life
[2:04:09] i want to turn to psalms 119
[2:04:13] verse 73
[2:04:15] [Music]
[2:04:18] and it says
[2:04:20] the hands have made me and fashioned me
[2:04:24] give me understanding that i may learn
[2:04:26] thy commandments
[2:04:29] they that fear thee will be glad when
[2:04:31] they see me because i have
[2:04:34] hoped in thy word
[2:04:38] know o lord that thy judgments are right
[2:04:40] and thy that thou thou and faithfulness
[2:04:42] has afflicted me
[2:04:45] let i pray thee thy merciful kindness
[2:04:48] be for my comfort
[2:04:50] according to thy word unto thy servant
[2:04:55] let thy tender mercies come unto me that
[2:04:57] i may live
[2:04:59] for that law is my delight
[2:05:02] let the proud be ashamed for they dealt
[2:05:04] perversely with me without a cause
[2:05:07] but i will meditate
[2:05:09] in thy precepts
[2:05:11] let those that fear thee turn unto me
[2:05:13] and those that have known
[2:05:15] thy testimonies
[2:05:19] verse 80 says let my heart be sound
[2:05:23] and thy statutes
[2:05:26] that i be not ashamed
[2:05:30] brother west goes one that we found a
[2:05:32] man to be sound in the statutes of god
[2:05:36] and i believe today is a day that he is
[2:05:38] not ashamed
[2:05:41] i wanted to uh just just
[2:05:44] say three things and brother esco i want
[2:05:46] to thank you for your
[2:05:48] your faithfulness
[2:05:51] uh as i work closely with you in
[2:05:54] ministry over the years
[2:05:56] i've just just saw the faithfulness amen
[2:05:59] that you have given god and i remember
[2:06:01] uh going to a house that you bought one
[2:06:04] time and i mean the first time you
[2:06:05] bought a house cause brother west goes
[2:06:07] to live in an apartment and he bought a
[2:06:08] house his first house and they walked in
[2:06:10] i say this is a blessing i say this
[2:06:12] because you've been faithfully say oh
[2:06:14] that was it right there he couldn't
[2:06:16] understand why god had opened up that
[2:06:17] door for him but it's because of his
[2:06:19] faithfulness
[2:06:20] and then he didn't just stay at that
[2:06:22] house but god gave him another house
[2:06:23] gave him two houses at one time because
[2:06:26] of his faithfulness and brother wester i
[2:06:28] remember a man just watching you work
[2:06:30] with the people of god
[2:06:32] oftentimes you have to be so patient and
[2:06:34] laboring with the saints amen because
[2:06:37] many of them would let you down
[2:06:38] and i remember one time i asked brother
[2:06:41] wesker i said brother how do you
[2:06:43] continue to put up with all the letdowns
[2:06:46] that you get how do you stay so positive
[2:06:48] and brother weskel told me something
[2:06:50] that day that has stuck with me all the
[2:06:52] days of my life he responded says you
[2:06:54] know in order to be a pastor something
[2:06:56] god has to give you the heart to be
[2:07:01] god has to give you the heart
[2:07:03] of a pastor
[2:07:05] i said i didn't understand it until i
[2:07:07] became a pastor
[2:07:11] god gave you the heart and your
[2:07:12] faithfulness in serving god's people
[2:07:14] even when we let you down even when we
[2:07:16] disappointed you still remain faithful
[2:07:20] god bless you brother wesker we want to
[2:07:22] thank you for your dedication
[2:07:30] [Music]
[2:07:32] my second point i want to say thank you
[2:07:34] for your dedication and ministry
[2:07:38] and for me as a young man just watching
[2:07:42] you and
[2:07:43] one of the most difficult times in your
[2:07:46] life
[2:07:48] i had my eyes on you brother wesco you
[2:07:50] didn't know it but i had my eyes
[2:07:52] fixed on you it's during this season of
[2:07:55] your life that
[2:07:57] the lord called your son home
[2:08:00] it's a very difficult time
[2:08:02] but in that same week that amen the lord
[2:08:06] called your son home we had another
[2:08:07] brother staying right here on the
[2:08:08] property and god called him home in the
[2:08:10] same week i said my high can we as a
[2:08:13] church
[2:08:14] bear this
[2:08:16] but i watched brother west go just
[2:08:21] somehow
[2:08:22] uh get it get get get get get ready for
[2:08:25] his assignment and
[2:08:27] he stepped out and we had a service here
[2:08:29] i think on a friday night and brother
[2:08:30] weskel came in and preached the gospel
[2:08:33] amen for the man brother maina who was
[2:08:36] lost he came and preached the gospel
[2:08:38] even in the midst of grieving for his
[2:08:39] own son
[2:08:41] i said how could this man do this
[2:08:44] your dedication to ministry spoke much
[2:08:46] to me
[2:08:48] brother let's go uh 2015
[2:08:51] as a church we went through some serious
[2:08:53] times we lost four or four people in the

[2:08:57] people in my life and in one month time
[2:08:59] i lost both my my biological father and
