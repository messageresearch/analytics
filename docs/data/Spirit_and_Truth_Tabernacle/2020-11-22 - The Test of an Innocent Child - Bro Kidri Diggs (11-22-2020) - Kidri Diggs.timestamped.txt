[1:05:24] saint john 15. amen let's
[1:05:27] start at verse uh verse one
[1:05:31] he says i am the true vine
[1:05:34] and my father is the husband every
[1:05:37] branch in me
[1:05:38] that brings not fruit he takes away and
[1:05:41] every branch that beareth
[1:05:43] fruit he purges it that it may bring
[1:05:46] forth
[1:05:46] more fruit now you are clean to my word
[1:05:50] which i have spoken unto you amen let's
[1:05:52] go to um galatians chapter four
[1:05:55] galatians chapter four
[1:06:00] hallelujah galatians
[1:06:04] chapter 4 verse 1.
[1:06:08] you have to say man the bible says now
[1:06:12] i say that the air
[1:06:15] as long as he is a child differ
[1:06:20] nothing from a servant though
[1:06:23] he be lord of all look
[1:06:26] he's a child but at the same time he's
[1:06:29] lord of all
[1:06:32] but it's under tutors and governors
[1:06:35] until the time appointed of the father
[1:06:39] amen you have your seat say man man lord
[1:06:41] bless reading of his word
[1:06:43] as you're sitting let's go to um
[1:06:46] let's go to uh first samuel
[1:06:50] chapter 16. samuel
[1:06:54] 16. samuel 16.
[1:07:04] i believe that's what i want
[1:07:09] listen the bible says then samuel took
[1:07:12] the horn of allah and anointed him in
[1:07:14] the midst
[1:07:15] of his brother and the spirit of the
[1:07:17] lord came upon
[1:07:18] david from that day forward so samuel
[1:07:22] rose up
[1:07:23] and went to rhema hallelujah
[1:07:26] you know today my my subject you know
[1:07:28] church i just can't help it
[1:07:30] i'm telling jack the span that i'm in in
[1:07:33] my life
[1:07:34] is that i can't look at things uh
[1:07:38] that i'm going through as uh uh
[1:07:41] not working for my good i look at
[1:07:44] everything i'm going through there has
[1:07:46] to be
[1:07:46] something good coming out of it because
[1:07:49] that's the promise god gave me
[1:07:51] he said no matter what you're going
[1:07:52] through all things work together for
[1:07:54] good
[1:07:55] because those that love god those are
[1:07:57] called according to his purpose
[1:07:59] so no matter what you're going through
[1:08:02] you have to be able to take the mindset
[1:08:04] to say
[1:08:04] lord show me what you want me to see
[1:08:07] amen
[1:08:08] there's something in it that god is
[1:08:10] trying to rise you up to be amen
[1:08:13] and you know church today my subject by
[1:08:15] the grace of god
[1:08:16] is the test hallelujah of an
[1:08:20] innocent child test of an innocent child
[1:08:23] now church we may not we
[1:08:25] we as parents and different ones you
[1:08:27] know there are
[1:08:28] things that we do to our children to
[1:08:31] help them grow
[1:08:32] we we we assist in the process of
[1:08:35] they're growing
[1:08:36] and they don't even realize that they're
[1:08:37] being tested they don't even realize
[1:08:39] they're being tried
[1:08:41] but what we're doing we're trying to get
[1:08:43] them to mature
[1:08:44] we're trying to get them to a place to
[1:08:46] where they can handle
[1:08:47] certain responsibility and you must
[1:08:50] realize god is the same way
[1:08:52] god takes us through things so we can
[1:08:55] grow
[1:08:55] but i want you to realize you know a lot
[1:08:57] of times people go through things
[1:08:59] and we'll say oh the devil
[1:09:03] we've done that too much we've given the
[1:09:05] devil credit
[1:09:06] when he don't deserve it the devil is
[1:09:08] running to god saying
[1:09:10] you know i can't do this except you give
[1:09:12] me permission
[1:09:13] but what we do we get down in prayer and
[1:09:15] we start calling on the devil
[1:09:17] oh lord the devil does oh lord the devil
[1:09:20] that
[1:09:20] oh lord and god is saying i thought i
[1:09:23] was in control of your life
[1:09:26] see church you must be careful at your
[1:09:28] confession you know even if you lose
[1:09:30] your house your car
[1:09:31] you can't say well the devil may be
[1:09:33] losing if you make that confession
[1:09:35] you're saying that the devil is control
[1:09:37] of your life
[1:09:39] god is in control so if i lose it praise
[1:09:42] god
[1:09:42] if i get it praise god you know i would
[1:09:45] whatever's taking place
[1:09:47] i i'm determined to say praise god
[1:09:50] but you know church as an innocent child
[1:09:53] we go through things
[1:09:54] and we uh don't understand why sometimes
[1:09:57] god don't give you an
[1:09:58] answer sometimes god is quiet that
[1:10:00] doesn't mean he's not on the scene
[1:10:05] sometimes god will stay quiet hallelujah
[1:10:07] because he's watching you grow
[1:10:10] he'll stay quiet because he knows you're
[1:10:12] gonna your prayers are gonna become
[1:10:14] more intense your worship is going to
[1:10:16] become
[1:10:18] more like spirit and truth hallelujah so
[1:10:21] he'll just sit back
[1:10:22] and watch you grow hard he'll sit back
[1:10:24] and be quiet till you get into that
[1:10:26] place where he can just put his finger
[1:10:28] on you and say
[1:10:28] see that's what i was looking for but
[1:10:31] church when we
[1:10:32] as christians let me let me dive into
[1:10:35] this you know
[1:10:36] sometimes we think because we have the
[1:10:38] holy ghost
[1:10:39] that there's no room for error
[1:10:43] all right that's the deception that the
[1:10:46] devil has tried to get us to believe
[1:10:49] church the only time we're going to be
[1:10:51] perfect
[1:10:52] in this body is when we're translated
[1:10:56] they're going to be uh times and spaces
[1:11:00] where we're going to see ourselves
[1:11:02] growing hallelujah
[1:11:03] and the only way you grow let's read
[1:11:07] let's read listen i want you to
[1:11:09] understand the grace of god today
[1:11:12] hallelujah i feel good church
[1:11:16] i want you to understand the grace of
[1:11:18] god like jack jack was just talking
[1:11:19] about
[1:11:19] uh brother dilla i remember the first
[1:11:22] time i met brother dylan i thought we
[1:11:23] was in macon
[1:11:24] at brother larry's uh convention and you
[1:11:28] know what i was seeing that thing i was
[1:11:29] like what this old man gonna do
[1:11:31] you know by that time he was a little
[1:11:32] bit old and everything and i'm like this
[1:11:34] old man
[1:11:36] they're supposed to be a revival they
[1:11:39] like you know i was young and dumb you
[1:11:41] know what i mean i'm thinking
[1:11:42] you know got to be young people whatever
[1:11:44] the case is and i said you know what i
[1:11:45] bring this old man
[1:11:48] man that man stopped preaching
[1:11:50] hallelujah he started tying stuff and
[1:11:52] kicking his leg and doing all
[1:11:53] i was like whoa boy when i get his age i
[1:11:56] want what he got
[1:11:59] hallelujah hallelujah so thank god for
[1:12:02] brother dylan amen
[1:12:04] you know and all the other uh soldiers
[1:12:06] that have gone on but
[1:12:08] luke church um if you will
[1:12:11] let's let's let's let's go back to um
[1:12:14] saint john right quick
[1:12:16] let's go back to saint john chapter 15.
[1:12:20] we want to bring out something you know
[1:12:22] and i kind of want to just uh
[1:12:25] deal with this area because i want to
[1:12:27] encourage you amen
[1:12:28] saint john chapter 15. let's read verse
[1:12:31] 2.
[1:12:32] the bible says every tree in me that
[1:12:35] bear is not
[1:12:36] fruit he taketh away he say every branch
[1:12:40] that buried fruit he purges it that it
[1:12:43] may bring forth
[1:12:44] more fruit so look the tree is already
[1:12:48] breathing for fruit but god says that
[1:12:50] you beat forth
[1:12:51] more fruit i'm going to purge it
[1:12:54] honestly
[1:12:55] what does this purge mean let's look at
[1:12:56] it church we're going to deal with
[1:12:58] something now
[1:12:59] now the tree is bringing forth something
[1:13:01] already it's being used of god
[1:13:04] but now he says i'm going to purge it
[1:13:06] purge means to cleanse
[1:13:08] now you mean to tell me i'm filled with
[1:13:10] the holy ghost i'm serving god
[1:13:12] but god said i still need to be cleansed
[1:13:15] i'm going to purge you that you breathe
[1:13:17] for more fruit let's read it a little
[1:13:19] bit more
[1:13:19] he says i'm going to purge it he said
[1:13:22] purge
[1:13:23] this is the definition of purge purge
[1:13:25] means to cleanse
[1:13:26] of filthy impurities not too much
[1:13:33] now you can't tell me that you don't
[1:13:34] have thoughts you should not
[1:13:36] have hurry but what happens god comes in
[1:13:40] with the word
[1:13:40] and he begins to purge it hallelujah he
[1:13:43] begins the cleansing
[1:13:44] of his unfilthiness now you may say well
[1:13:47] brother diggs you know
[1:13:48] uh the holy ghost is supposed to take
[1:13:50] all those things away
[1:13:51] and it does the holy ghost holy
[1:13:54] first let's deal with sanctification how
[1:13:57] do you know you're sanctified
[1:13:59] if you're really sanctified it's not by
[1:14:01] how you dress
[1:14:04] holy she really put uh sanctification
[1:14:06] and all these things
[1:14:07] on the outside god is never dealing with
[1:14:11] your outside
[1:14:13] he's always dealing with the life inside
[1:14:15] of you
[1:14:16] so if you get purged you're getting
[1:14:18] purged from the inside out
[1:14:20] because who you are on the inside is the
[1:14:23] real you
[1:14:24] because there are people who can sit in
[1:14:26] church dress right look right everything
[1:14:28] leave here and go do some foolishness
[1:14:32] who you are is in your heart what you
[1:14:35] really believe
[1:14:36] but to really be sanctified the prophet
[1:14:38] of god say
[1:14:39] is when god comes and he takes the one
[1:14:42] two away
[1:14:46] everybody sacrifice i said does anybody
[1:14:48] say to fight
[1:14:50] see when you're really sanctified god
[1:14:52] will change your desires
[1:14:54] the world that doesn't mean you may not
[1:14:58] sleep up and do it
[1:15:00] but if you're really sanctified there's
[1:15:02] no desire to do it
[1:15:05] that's the reason why i read david luke
[1:15:07] church i'm gonna run this down i don't
[1:15:09] plan on being alone
[1:15:10] but look at david honey saul hallelujah
[1:15:13] couldn't obey god so god said i'm gonna
[1:15:16] get a man
[1:15:16] after my very own heart can we agree
[1:15:20] god's saying i'm gonna get a man after
[1:15:22] my very own he didn't go get
[1:15:24] david but david being an innocent child
[1:15:27] did not realize what he had to go
[1:15:30] through
[1:15:31] to be king he didn't realize what he had
[1:15:34] the trials and tribulations and
[1:15:36] all the things he had to go through
[1:15:38] hurry as a man of god's
[1:15:41] own heart
[1:15:46] david was king but he had to be purged
[1:15:59] look look god didn't make his heart
[1:16:03] hurt into the place he was supposed to
[1:16:05] be when he chose him
[1:16:07] he already had the heart of god
[1:16:11] but god had to clean him up make him fit
[1:16:15] for the usury of the holy spirit look
[1:16:17] church
[1:16:18] david remember i said an innocent child
[1:16:22] david being called of god all his
[1:16:24] brothers were like man please not david
[1:16:26] david ain't doing all he's doing is
[1:16:28] taking care of sheep what about me
[1:16:30] lord i'm tall i'm big i'm strong god
[1:16:32] said no i want a man with
[1:16:34] a certain character that i'm looking for
[1:16:36] but look church
[1:16:37] hunger david didn't even know he had the
[1:16:40] strength within him to kill a bear
[1:16:43] to deal with a lion all these things why
[1:16:45] because god was setting him up for
[1:16:46] goliath he didn't realize
[1:16:49] just the innocence of a child hallelujah
[1:16:51] out there dealing with the sheep
[1:16:52] that one day he was gonna have to fight
[1:16:54] a lion but god knew
[1:16:56] he would be able to overcome it god put
[1:16:58] him in a place
[1:16:59] where he get glimpses of the power in
[1:17:02] his life
[1:17:05] i wonder how many of you god is getting
[1:17:07] glimpses
[1:17:08] of the power in your life and you ain't
[1:17:10] doing nothing with it
[1:17:11] god gave david glimpses of their power
[1:17:14] with the bad bear
[1:17:15] he was a lion so that's why david could
[1:17:18] stand up didn't tell saul
[1:17:20] i fight goliath
[1:17:25] he had already seen glimpses of the
[1:17:28] power
[1:17:29] so dave was like lord he said i'll go
[1:17:31] and fight but look
[1:17:32] look at how his brothers received him
[1:17:34] he's just an innocent child
[1:17:37] he's innocent going through a test so
[1:17:38] you know what church he is dead he's got
[1:17:41] his dad comes
[1:17:42] he says hey i want you to go y'all know
[1:17:43] like i said last night i want you to go
[1:17:45] take your brother some chipotle
[1:17:48] so he gathered up everything david going
[1:17:51] down there
[1:17:52] david don't even know goliath is down
[1:17:53] there
[1:17:55] david don't even know that a battle is
[1:17:57] going on
[1:17:58] his father has told him caleb go take
[1:18:00] your brother something to eat
[1:18:02] he's walking into this situation
[1:18:04] innocent
[1:18:07] but god said even when you bring him for
[1:18:09] fruit
[1:18:10] i
[1:18:23] that's why it's important to come to
[1:18:25] church
[1:18:27] church now david he steps out there
[1:18:29] hallelujah and you know next thing you
[1:18:31] know
[1:18:31] he's bringing the food how do you mind
[1:18:33] his own business he's innocent
[1:18:35] he breaks the food and the next thing he
[1:18:37] hears break me man
[1:18:46] irritating to david see everybody else
[1:18:49] got used to hearing the devil stream but
[1:18:52] david wasn't used to that kind of stuff
[1:18:54] in his ear
[1:18:54] he didn't used to hearing the devil talk
[1:18:56] to him
[1:18:59] [Music]
[1:19:00] some of us didn't got used to hearing
[1:19:02] the devil talk to us
[1:19:04] and we don't even challenge his voice
[1:19:10] david heard him streaming bring me in
[1:19:12] there bring me a man and they were like
[1:19:14] huh
[1:19:15] huh who does what what's going on who is
[1:19:18] this
[1:19:19] and his brothers got mad at him because
[1:19:21] he was willing to take the
[1:19:23] to take the challenge so david says who
[1:19:25] is this
[1:19:26] uncircumcised philistine hallelujah that
[1:19:29] has defied
[1:19:30] the armies of the living god he walked
[1:19:32] into the battle innocent
[1:19:34] holy but and his innocence he was
[1:19:36] equipped for the battle
[1:19:40] his brother's been been there all this
[1:19:41] time they said go live streaming for 40
[1:19:43] days for the night
[1:19:44] bring me a man premium man and you know
[1:19:46] how the devil is he's so subtle to be
[1:19:48] like hey
[1:19:49] ain't no need for innocent people to die
[1:19:53] they don't need hey look ain't nobody
[1:19:54] watching you just go ahead
[1:19:56] you know wine is good for your stomach
[1:19:59] wine is good you know we're in a
[1:20:01] pandemic you know that's why i might
[1:20:03] this wine might stop the virus don't
[1:20:06] worry about going take a drink ain't
[1:20:07] nobody look
[1:20:08] bro jack don't see you don't worry about
[1:20:10] it so it's don't worry look a sister
[1:20:12] told me
[1:20:13] she said the sister told me she said uh
[1:20:15] she was
[1:20:16] you know laura was dealing with her you
[1:20:18] know about living closer to him
[1:20:20] you know she once was out kind of like
[1:20:22] in the world and you know she's raised
[1:20:24] right she's trying to make her way back
[1:20:26] and you know she was wrestling with
[1:20:27] wearing pants
[1:20:32] she's having them thoughts should i say
[1:20:35] with my pants you know you know what
[1:20:36] people do
[1:20:37] when they ain't around to church people
[1:20:38] that they put them on they going by they
[1:20:41] building they be stepping to
[1:20:43] doing their thing she worried about
[1:20:44] nobody you know what i mean
[1:20:46] but what you fail to realize is god see
[1:20:48] you
[1:20:50] you don't have to put on for us god see
[1:20:52] you he's though and let me say like this
[1:20:54] we're not your judge god is if you're a
[1:20:56] person
[1:20:57] you can't shake nobody's hand and
[1:20:58] fellowship with them because of the
[1:21:00] things they might be going through
[1:21:02] you need prayer holy because how many
[1:21:05] times
[1:21:05] did we ever see christ condemn a sinner
[1:21:10] he let the word do it hallelujah he
[1:21:12] never
[1:21:13] just openly just blasted the ceiling now
[1:21:15] he blasted the sadducees
[1:21:17] pharisees because they were religious
[1:21:19] sinners hallelujah
[1:21:20] but church just the innocent people you
[1:21:23] look they brought the woman to him say
[1:21:24] hey
[1:21:25] this woman was caught in adultery but
[1:21:27] god being much wiser to me
[1:21:29] god just sit there writing in the sand
[1:21:31] and in his mind he probably thinking
[1:21:33] this woman was set up because where is
[1:21:35] the man
[1:21:41] so he said really you be without seeing
[1:21:42] you cast the first stop
[1:21:45] don't measure your your christian
[1:21:47] ability or experience
[1:21:49] by the person you're sitting by you
[1:21:52] measure it by what god has did in your
[1:21:54] life
[1:21:55] how much you have overcome oh yeah
[1:21:57] because if i met if i try to mess with
[1:21:59] myself up to jack
[1:22:00] there's some things god did in his life
[1:22:02] he will never do in mine
[1:22:04] oh yeah so church look david he's out
[1:22:06] there
[1:22:07] and i'm just running kind of fast
[1:22:08] because it's somewhere i want to get
[1:22:09] david he's out there church and he's
[1:22:11] he's uh uh he is goliath now he's
[1:22:14] innocent
[1:22:14] he had no intentions on going in a fight
[1:22:17] that day
[1:22:20] but god said you know what they need to
[1:22:23] see somebody
[1:22:25] they need to see somebody that ain't
[1:22:26] afraid
[1:22:28] they need to see somebody that's going
[1:22:29] to step up to the challenge and not only
[1:22:31] just somebody but one of their own
[1:22:37] what are brothers people what are they
[1:22:39] message believers
[1:22:41] i want them to see what their real
[1:22:43] potential is
[1:22:45] that's why when you go through a trial
[1:22:47] you have to go through it like a soldier
[1:22:49] because god may have you on a pedestal
[1:22:51] and somebody in your family may be
[1:22:53] watching you
[1:22:54] to see how you're going through it and
[1:22:56] if you go through it wrong
[1:22:58] it's going to throw them off but if you
[1:22:59] go through it right they're going to get
[1:23:01] saved
[1:23:04] hallelujah let's go through it right
[1:23:09] let's not mumble and complain when was
[1:23:11] the last time you said

[1:24:02] so i'm like i'm thinking you know i got
[1:24:03] a revelation so i'm like
[1:24:05] if it'll show up in my system like that
[1:24:08] key and cookies why you ain't calling
[1:24:10] ted cookies

[1:24:20] see how sleek the devil is she agreed
[1:24:23] with me that is tea and cookies
[1:24:24] but then she tried to change the name of
[1:24:26] diabetes
[1:24:28] don't you let the devil change his name
[1:24:30] on you
[1:24:32] it's tea it's cookies it's five guys
[1:24:35] it's all that
[1:24:37] you putting it in your body and you got
[1:24:40] the power to tell it what to do
[1:24:45] hallelujah church now david is there
[1:24:48] and david would say hey i'll fight his
[1:24:50] goliath his brothers get mad at him
[1:24:52] because he's
[1:24:53] willing to accept the challenge is that
[1:24:55] something he's innocent
[1:24:57] he had no he had no intentions on going
[1:24:59] there to fight
[1:25:00] but david heard it stepped up to the
[1:25:02] battle and his brother got
[1:25:03] mad at him because he was willing to
[1:25:05] fight you know hallelujah
[1:25:07] their pastors hallelujah who the people
[1:25:09] have got mad at them
[1:25:10] because they kept church going doing
[1:25:12] covet
[1:25:18] we all you got to remember the people
[1:25:20] and listen he said i am remembering the
[1:25:22] people
[1:25:23] there are people who want to be in the
[1:25:24] presence of god there are people who
[1:25:26] want to come to church
[1:25:27] and operate in the scripture where it
[1:25:29] says when you see that they're
[1:25:30] approaching you ought to fellowship them
[1:25:32] all
[1:25:33] hallelujah church just like y'all amen
[1:25:36] you know my pastor were receiving
[1:25:38] persecution because he kept the church
[1:25:40] open

[1:25:43] governor came and said
[1:25:44] church is essential i'm not closing it
[1:25:49] thank god for sc hallelujah church is
[1:25:53] essential amen so my pastor kept the
[1:25:55] church over
[1:25:56] just despite what people thought and all
[1:25:57] this stuff and behind we didn't know
[1:26:00] that there were people among us
[1:26:03] accusing him people among us that he
[1:26:06] would feed
[1:26:06] daily until that time turned on him
[1:26:10] now we didn't know we going to church
[1:26:12] having a good time praising god
[1:26:14] then all of a sudden was in church and a
[1:26:16] sister was singing a song

[1:26:21] oh hallelujah and then she started
[1:26:23] interpreting hallelujah
[1:26:24] and then they didn't lost he said i am
[1:26:26] the lord thy god

[1:26:31] this house open
[1:26:39] [Applause]
[1:26:42] the bible says touch not my anointing
[1:26:45] you better be careful how you talk to

[1:27:00] that
[1:27:01] have told him to keep this house open
[1:27:03] and the lord said

[1:27:13] this is going to bring my people back
[1:27:17] i don't know what the lord said in your

[1:31:51] through
[1:31:51] he said but hey don't let the devil
[1:31:54] listen to this
[1:31:55] he said don't let the devil take your
[1:31:57] joy
[1:32:00] once he take your joy he gonna knock you
[1:32:02] out
[1:32:04] once you leave that that freshness that
[1:32:07] excitement
[1:32:08] out of serving god then the devil can
[1:32:10] get you to do anything
[1:32:12] because you start feeling sorry for
[1:32:14] yourself you start feeling pity but look
[1:32:17] i was innocent hallelujah an innocent
[1:32:19] child
[1:32:20] but this test was gonna make me stronger
[1:32:22] than i ever was
[1:32:32] he said hey i don't even know what
[1:32:33] you're going through but i can tell
[1:32:35] something ain't right
[1:32:36] he said because you're coming to church
[1:32:37] with jeans and tennis shoes on that
[1:32:39] ain't you
[1:32:42] that ain't me i'm normally hallelujah
[1:32:46] it's something some fine rule hallelujah
[1:32:49] a little bit of silk
[1:32:53] hallelujah church
[1:32:57] real spiritual people they can catch it
[1:32:59] when you're going through something
[1:33:01] and they are there to help lift you up
[1:33:03] hardly but what was happening
[1:33:05] god was purging he was persian church
[1:33:08] hallelujah
[1:33:09] and you know what that that that
[1:33:11] interpretation just came this year
[1:33:14] so i had to keep pressing and keep
[1:33:16] pressing until i heard from god
[1:33:17] hallelujah
[1:33:18] and you know what the enemy was saying
[1:33:19] give up this and that get rejected all
[1:33:21] these things
[1:33:22] but you got to keep pressing early you
[1:33:24] can't give up sometimes you got to
[1:33:25] reflect back
[1:33:26] like david did i can fight this goliath
[1:33:29] because i already fall back
[1:33:31] why is he going to fight goliath because
[1:33:33] he had a testimony
[1:33:39] a child is no more than a servant
[1:33:43] until he matures
[1:33:47] look though he be lord of all
[1:33:51] look church purge means the cleanse of
[1:33:55] filthiness
[1:33:56] et cetera hollywood the brutal tree
[1:33:58] finds unless
[1:33:59] uh uh unless it's you look at the
[1:34:01] metaphor listen to me what purge means
[1:34:03] hallelujah
[1:34:04] free from guilt
[1:34:11] now all of us needed that kind of
[1:34:13] purging
[1:34:15] hallelujah but look let's look at it
[1:34:20] david was a man of the godzilla but look
[1:34:22] let me tell the end of what the lord
[1:34:24] said to me
[1:34:26] he said i'm the lord who hath
[1:34:29] upholded thee
[1:34:33] the lord said and i will uphold thee
[1:34:38] ain't none of us keeping ourself god
[1:34:40] doing it
[1:34:41] oh yeah and you know what church i truly
[1:34:43] believe because i had got to a place
[1:34:45] to where no matter what sister brown i
[1:34:47] was going to keep coming hallelujah
[1:34:49] i was going to keep giving god praise
[1:34:50] and worshiping him no matter what
[1:34:52] people thought no matter what people
[1:34:54] said so i believe god allowed that to
[1:34:56] happen not only for me
[1:34:57] but my sisters and brothers i fellowship
[1:34:59] with so they can have some comfort
[1:35:01] hallelujah
[1:35:02] so they can cast down all the rumors and
[1:35:04] all the nonsense
[1:35:08] [Music]
[1:35:09] praise god that god allowed it to happen
[1:35:12] hallelujah
[1:35:13] because there's a persian for more fruit
[1:35:16] hallelujah
[1:35:16] look church remember with the holy ghost
[1:35:19] sometimes you will make mistakes
[1:35:20] that you don't want to make listen to
[1:35:23] that part
[1:35:24] that you don't want to make that's the
[1:35:27] difference of a person who got the holy
[1:35:28] ghost
[1:35:29] and a person that just got a ghost
[1:35:32] things happen that you don't want to
[1:35:34] happen why
[1:35:35] because there's something god wants to
[1:35:37] deal with
[1:35:38] hallelujah god like i said last night
[1:35:41] god dealt with abraham in such a way
[1:35:43] he already called him the father of
[1:35:45] faith but he took him through an
[1:35:46] innocent trial
[1:35:48] he didn't even know that he was going to
[1:35:50] have to make a decision should i give up
[1:35:52] my wife
[1:35:52] or should i keep my life
[1:35:57] but listen in the heat of that moment
[1:35:59] abraham he said you know what
[1:36:01] you my sister he started reasoning
[1:36:05] now look they wasn't living together as
[1:36:08] sisters and brothers
[1:36:10] technically that was his sister but they
[1:36:13] weren't living together assistant
[1:36:15] brother with his
[1:36:16] husband and wife that's what we call a
[1:36:18] white lie
[1:36:22] the white light got some truth in it but
[1:36:24] you know uh
[1:36:26] god forgive me he know my heart
[1:36:29] but god knew abraham had a little line
[1:36:31] in him
[1:36:33] so god put him in a place he put him in
[1:36:35] a position
[1:36:36] he innocent his wife going a certain way
[1:36:40] king saw his wife and say hey you know
[1:36:41] what i got to have her and at the same
[1:36:43] time while the king was going to see
[1:36:45] abraham tapped into it he tapped into it
[1:36:48] before it even happened
[1:36:50] and he said look you're beautiful and
[1:36:51] they're going to they don't want you
[1:36:53] so they're going to kill me so you my
[1:36:54] sister look he already premeditated the
[1:36:57] lie
[1:36:58] now god put him in position hallelujah
[1:37:00] put him in an innocent trial
[1:37:02] so god can rise that lie up hallelujah
[1:37:04] and that god
[1:37:05] dealt with that lie but let me ask you
[1:37:07] something did that lie change god's
[1:37:09] promise
[1:37:14] god wanted to deal with him and once god
[1:37:17] dealt with it hallelujah
[1:37:19] god showed abraham his life god let the
[1:37:21] king go down
[1:37:23] even though he lied and everything god
[1:37:25] told the king if you don't give him back
[1:37:26] he was good as a dead man
[1:37:29] even though his servant his child was
[1:37:32] lying
[1:37:33] that still did not stop or change
[1:37:36] god's promise to his son why
[1:37:40] because he was a son with that lying
[1:37:43] spirit inside of him
[1:37:45] but god said i'm going to purge you so
[1:37:47] that you really can be the father of
[1:37:49] faith
[1:37:50] and from that point he never lied again
[1:37:55] hey so god would allow things to happen
[1:37:57] so that you could bring forth more fruit
[1:38:00] look remember like i said last night the
[1:38:01] prophet of god hallelujah
[1:38:03] innocent the test of an innocent child
[1:38:08] he's just serving the lord you know he
[1:38:10] got uh uh uh
[1:38:11] uh mission funds all these things boom
[1:38:14] here come the irs
[1:38:16] you owe us some money you're like what
[1:38:18] what you know i'm doing what i'm
[1:38:19] supposed to do hey
[1:38:20] what is this you owe us so many thousand
[1:38:22] and back in them days i was like me
[1:38:26] and now the prophet he can't do nothing
[1:38:28] about it and the people are on his back
[1:38:30] they own his track
[1:38:31] and god ain't doing nothing
[1:38:34] [Music]
[1:38:36] god ain't doing nothing god let it
[1:38:38] prolong he let it prolong church think
[1:38:40] about this
[1:38:41] god let him prolong and you think about
[1:38:43] all the times
[1:38:44] the prophetess went and asked god to do
[1:38:46] certain things and god did it like that
[1:38:48] right but in this moment
[1:38:51] god ain't doing nothing test of an
[1:38:55] innocent child
[1:38:56] what is he doing he's going to purge the
[1:38:58] prophet
[1:39:00] field the holy ghost seeing visions
[1:39:02] having
[1:39:03] having prayer lines casting out demons
[1:39:05] all the stuff
[1:39:06] but way down in there is a lion spirit
[1:39:22] that little church he he the people are
[1:39:24] calling them back and forth and you know
[1:39:26] the prophet had like three or four
[1:39:27] different lines
[1:39:28] church look at how strategic god is
[1:39:31] look church he comes home and the people
[1:39:33] call exactly when he's back home
[1:39:35] how do they know he was back in town
[1:39:38] how do they know which phone to use
[1:39:45] so they make the phone call now he's at
[1:39:47] home he's all
[1:39:48] under pressure about all the stuff and
[1:39:50] his wife and me say
[1:39:51] oh it's them system tax people again and
[1:39:54] he says
[1:39:55] tell him i'm out back he said he got out
[1:39:59] back
[1:39:59] everything was good but i got out of
[1:40:00] that i'm good but his wife
[1:40:04] his wife knew that wasn't quite right
[1:40:07] and he gave his wife
[1:40:08] credit for being a little bit more
[1:40:10] spiritual in that moment than he was
[1:40:13] she said now you know bill that wasn't
[1:40:15] quite right he said what
[1:40:16] i wasn't in the house
[1:40:20] look let me say this when god catch you
[1:40:23] don't try to reason your way out
[1:40:26] [Music]
[1:40:30] because reasoning your way out don't
[1:40:32] bring deliverance
[1:40:34] so you take an adulterer hallelujah and
[1:40:36] that adulterer will get caught
[1:40:39] that don't mean he's delivered
[1:40:42] getting caught don't bring deliverance
[1:40:45] getting converted will
[1:40:48] that's why a lot of times men and women
[1:40:50] they get caught and they go back and do
[1:40:52] it again
[1:40:53] because the spirit is still there
[1:40:58] but look church the prophet says he
[1:41:00] tells his wife
[1:41:01] well honey you know i wasn't i wasn't
[1:41:03] quite in the house she said now you know
[1:41:04] beard i wasn't quite right
[1:41:05] but the test of an innocent child now
[1:41:08] he's thinking everything good
[1:41:09] it's all this just my wife ain't even
[1:41:11] realized that media was representing god
[1:41:18] you sisters stand on your convictions
[1:41:23] sir the prophet now he's meant to go
[1:41:27] and bring forth fruit like he's always
[1:41:30] done
[1:41:30] now he's gonna go pray for a child
[1:41:32] hallelujah he steps out there to pray
[1:41:34] and god tells him get your filthy hands
[1:41:36] off that child
[1:41:37] you ain't fit to pray for a child like
[1:41:39] lord what you mean you just told a lie
[1:41:44] god's bringing it all back to him church
[1:41:46] did he have the holy ghost
[1:41:49] was he saved was he being used by god
[1:41:56] but this is the point church hallelujah
[1:41:59] he didn't
[1:42:00] have the desire to lie earlier
[1:42:03] he got caught up in all the pressure it
[1:42:05] was a test
[1:42:08] but what was god doing none of us none
[1:42:10] of those people back then
[1:42:12] they could see that spirit of him but
[1:42:13] god could all they saw that he was the
[1:42:15] prophet being used of god
[1:42:17] but god said holy he ain't quite there
[1:42:19] yet i got to put him in a situation
[1:42:21] where i can get that lying spirit out
[1:42:22] before him embarrass himself
[1:42:32] i have ordered your steps
[1:42:36] church look now the prophet holland he
[1:42:39] says i personally say even when you
[1:42:40] bring forth fruit
[1:42:41] uh percy that you bring forth more fruit
[1:42:43] in that church he gets down there he's
[1:42:45] trying to pray
[1:42:45] god said you ain't even worthy don't put
[1:42:47] your hands you just told a lie so you
[1:42:48] know what he does
[1:42:49] he goes back to the man holly he goes
[1:42:52] back to his office
[1:42:53] and he confesses hallelujah see that's
[1:42:55] the heart of god
[1:42:57] see he didn't try to continue on in his
[1:42:59] mischief he didn't go to the man's i
[1:43:01] always say well y'all calling me y'all
[1:43:02] put all this pressure on me
[1:43:04] y'all doing all this stuff to me and i
[1:43:06] did nothing wrong he
[1:43:07] tried to explain his lie all he did was
[1:43:09] say yeah i did it and he called
[1:43:11] he's talking to the man he said look he
[1:43:13] went to the man office face to face
[1:43:15] he said no you know when you just called
[1:43:17] me i was home and i'm sorry i lied to
[1:43:19] you i didn't mean to do it see the man
[1:43:21] put his hand on his shoulder
[1:43:22] and said mr branham i always had respect
[1:43:25] for you
[1:43:25] he said but now i got more respect
[1:43:31] that you bring forth more fruits
[1:43:38] oh my the free
[1:43:41] from guilt that's what persian does but
[1:43:44] of church we could go we could step a
[1:43:46] little bit further
[1:43:46] let's look at david hallelujah now david
[1:43:49] is the king hallelujah
[1:43:50] now god hallelujah has him in the house
[1:43:53] of has him in the house of solomon
[1:43:55] and all david is due he's innocent he's
[1:43:57] just being what god wants him to be
[1:43:58] all of a sudden a javelin comes crosses
[1:44:00] him
[1:44:02] saul was angry with him just for being a
[1:44:04] child of god
[1:44:06] just for having the anointing on his
[1:44:07] life david didn't know what was going on
[1:44:10] with saul hallelujah
[1:44:11] but god put david in that place so he
[1:44:14] could see
[1:44:14] hallelujah what kind of king he
[1:44:16] shouldn't be
[1:44:23] so he put david in the atmosphere with a
[1:44:26] man
[1:44:27] he loved hurry david love saw david had
[1:44:30] respect for saul
[1:44:31] now how you gonna love somebody that's
[1:44:33] trying to kill you
[1:44:37] it has to be the nature of god
[1:44:40] because god did he loved the people that
[1:44:43] killed them on the cross
[1:44:45] amen the test of an innocent child
[1:44:48] church now
[1:44:48] holy sabbath i think i think i think he
[1:44:51] threw javelins at david at least three
[1:44:53] or four times
[1:44:55] and all he's doing is trying to help the
[1:44:57] man everything he has david to do
[1:44:59] david go do it they think you know
[1:45:01] javelin
[1:45:03] he's telling david to go do this javelin
[1:45:06] she's so angry so mad david kept the
[1:45:09] anointing upon his life
[1:45:11] david would come hallelujah while he's
[1:45:13] all messed up with all them demons on
[1:45:15] them
[1:45:15] stand there and worship with them
[1:45:19] what a beautiful name it is
[1:45:23] a beautiful name is the name of
[1:45:27] jehovah uh king
[1:45:31] now listen david was so anointed
[1:45:35] that he could drive off a spirit that
[1:45:37] god put there
[1:45:46] church we supposed to have something
[1:45:47] real
[1:45:50] look just coming to church that
[1:45:52] shouldn't be a trial
[1:45:55] we should be way overcome that we should
[1:45:58] be way
[1:45:58] down the road holla we should come here
[1:46:00] and turn this place upside down
[1:46:02] we shouldn't be home i wonder if i'm
[1:46:03] going to church tonight
[1:46:05] if you fight in that battle you need to
[1:46:07] get to the altar
[1:46:11] church and even church earlier saul was
[1:46:14] trying to kill david david playing the
[1:46:16] music all the stuff
[1:46:17] rising and demon up but to know that god
[1:46:19] put it there every time david drive it
[1:46:21] away and come back
[1:46:24] hallelujah church he was innocent he
[1:46:27] didn't even realize what he stepped into
[1:46:29] but he was already anointed king
[1:46:31] hallelujah
[1:46:32] so he had to go through these things and
[1:46:33] next thing you know hallelujah
[1:46:35] now he's running from saul hallelujah
[1:46:37] he's running and running and running
[1:46:38] next thing you know hallelujah god puts
[1:46:41] his enemy in his hands now
[1:46:44] now he has him and he can do whatever he
[1:46:47] wants to do with saul but there was
[1:46:48] something
[1:46:49] in his heart that he didn't want to
[1:46:51] touch god's anointing
[1:46:53] and got mad at anybody else who wanted
[1:46:55] to kill the man that was trying to kill
[1:46:57] him
[1:47:03] that seems like a man with real
[1:47:04] integrity he wasn't there yet
[1:47:08] he wasn't there yet the trial for david
[1:47:12] didn't really start till he got the
[1:47:14] power of king
[1:47:16] until he got the position of king all
[1:47:19] that stuff with
[1:47:19] all that stuff we saw that's what you
[1:47:22] call a pre-workout
[1:47:28] all right it ain't the real workout so
[1:47:32] it's just what's really gonna get it
[1:47:34] going huh
[1:47:36] because at that moment david had all his
[1:47:38] boys he had everybody with him
[1:47:40] all the rest of the giant killers you
[1:47:41] know all of them
[1:47:43] you know but then god was going to put
[1:47:44] him in a place where it was just him by
[1:47:46] himself
[1:47:47] hallelujah and you know what it was
[1:47:49] church now david is king
[1:47:51] he got all power 500 wives
[1:47:54] now god is going to purge him now
[1:47:57] remember he's a man of god's very own
[1:47:59] heart
[1:47:59] i don't want you to lose sight of that
[1:48:01] he's a man of the god's very own heart
[1:48:03] that's the reason
[1:48:04] why god chose him but then david go see
[1:48:06] a naked woman taking a bath
[1:48:08] and he already got 500 wives
[1:48:12] and something rolls up on david and say
[1:48:14] man i got to have him
[1:48:17] i got to have her you know he david went
[1:48:20] and took
[1:48:20] another man's wife god knew he had an
[1:48:23] adulterous spirit inside knew he had an
[1:48:32] adulterous spirit inside of him god knew
[1:48:35] he had premeditated murder inside of him
[1:48:40] what i love about god he didn't tell
[1:48:42] nobody else what was going on in david
[1:48:46] the only other person knew what david
[1:48:48] was guilty of
[1:48:50] was nathan your royals didn't even know
[1:48:56] none of the captains heard none of them
[1:48:58] knew nobody knew what david did the only
[1:49:00] one knew what david did was god and
[1:49:01] nathan
[1:49:04] see god knows the thoughts and intent of
[1:49:07] your heart
[1:49:08] and if you're not willfully out there
[1:49:10] just doing stuff god won't embarrass you
[1:49:12] hallelujah he'll put you in private and
[1:49:14] deal with it now you got to accept the
[1:49:15] help
[1:49:16] now if you don't accept the help then
[1:49:18] you may get exposed
[1:49:19] because he says child go and sin no more
[1:49:22] unless a greater thing come upon you
[1:49:26] once god show you your wrong show your
[1:49:28] sin hallelujah
[1:49:29] don't you just lightly esteem it get it
[1:49:31] right
[1:49:32] see a man of god's very own heart will
[1:49:35] accept correction
[1:49:37] and repent i want to show you the power
[1:49:40] of repentance
[1:49:42] before this is over david hurry up he
[1:49:45] commits
[1:49:45] adultery takes a man's wife hallelujah
[1:49:48] sets the man
[1:49:49] up gets the man killed and even made an
[1:49:54] offspring
[1:49:56] whoo was he not a man after god's very
[1:49:59] own heart
[1:50:01] did that change does that change what
[1:50:04] god thought about it
[1:50:06] did god say i can't use you no more
[1:50:08] david nope
[1:50:10] nope with all that wrong he did
[1:50:14] god still kept him keen
[1:50:17] and god still kept the hands of war on
[1:50:19] him god still kept authority in his life
[1:50:24] now listen don't bring an uncertain
[1:50:25] sound to what i'm preaching to you this
[1:50:27] morning
[1:50:28] i'm not preaching it's okay to sin
[1:50:32] i'm not preaching it's all right to do
[1:50:34] filth
[1:50:35] what i'm saying is sometimes the devil
[1:50:37] will get a lick in
[1:50:39] but is it really the devil or is it god
[1:50:43] giving room
[1:50:44] holly for the devil to be your sparring
[1:50:46] partner
[1:50:48] he can't beat you but you he just
[1:50:50] letting you you trade with him for the
[1:50:52] real match
[1:50:54] you need to turkey pre-workout now the
[1:50:57] devil's sparring with you but there's a
[1:50:59] greater match that's going to come
[1:51:01] hallelujah so now church amen
[1:51:04] david didn't done all this david
[1:51:05] pre-meditated murder then call your riot
[1:51:08] say hey
[1:51:08] why don't you go home and spend the
[1:51:10] night with your wife
[1:51:12] trying to put his mistake on the next
[1:51:14] man
[1:51:17] was he still a man of god's very own
[1:51:20] heart
[1:51:21] are we going to drive it home because
[1:51:23] what we do
[1:51:25] we see people going through things and
[1:51:27] because we don't know what's going on
[1:51:29] we immediately cast judgment
[1:51:34] ah you know so and so left messaging
[1:51:37] so and so this happening they just and
[1:51:39] they that how we know god ain't allowed
[1:51:41] it
[1:51:42] how we know god ain't rising up stuff
[1:51:44] and taking it out
[1:51:45] so we can get them to the next level
[1:51:48] because remember with all david's
[1:51:50] mistakes hallelujah he still was
[1:51:52] anointed kings
[1:51:53] hollywood and even after that hallelujah
[1:51:55] they anointed him king over jeweler
[1:52:01] church now david anybody in the bible
[1:52:06] now i go back to the prophet because he
[1:52:08] still has some stuff too
[1:52:10] that we know that a prophet is born a
[1:52:12] prophet holy am i right
[1:52:14] he was born a prophet before he even
[1:52:16] realized he was a prophet
[1:52:18] you know what he had a spirit of murder
[1:52:19] inside of him
[1:52:21] yes he did i would probably had a spirit
[1:52:24] of murder inside remember he got beat up
[1:52:25] hallelujah
[1:52:26] he got beat up hallelujah what did he do
[1:52:29] he went and got his gun and said i'ma
[1:52:31] kill every last one of them
[1:52:32] and he wasn't bluffing
[1:52:35] but was he not a prophet before the
[1:52:37] foundation of the world
[1:52:41] i'm gonna take away your reasoning and
[1:52:44] to show that whatever god does
[1:52:46] god does holy church
[1:52:49] he was a prophet hallelujah before the
[1:52:51] foundation of the world but he had
[1:52:53] murder inside of him
[1:52:54] premeditated murder and you know what
[1:52:56] the boys beat him up and you know what
[1:52:58] he said jerry went back home and got his
[1:53:00] gun
[1:53:00] he said i'ma kill every last one of them
[1:53:02] got that gun and look
[1:53:03] premeditated sat in the bushes knew the
[1:53:06] way that they come home
[1:53:07] and waited on them does that sound like
[1:53:09] a private
[1:53:13] you know what it was it was the death of
[1:53:15] an innocent child
[1:53:17] god let him get beat up so bad
[1:53:21] so he could see that you can't kill
[1:53:23] nobody except i allow it
[1:53:30] church he sits there puts the bullets in
[1:53:33] the gun
[1:53:34] he says jumps out
[1:53:38] jumps out he's not bluffing he's been a
[1:53:40] blast on all of them
[1:53:41] he's like they say like the gates are
[1:53:42] safe he finna put in work
[1:53:49] caused the gun he wasn't bluffing his
[1:53:52] testimony is i pulled the trigger
[1:53:54] well that sounds like that sounds like a
[1:53:56] murderer a lot of profit right
[1:54:01] [Music]
[1:54:03] oh i don't sound like a little profit to
[1:54:04] me
[1:54:07] sound like a murderer premeditated
[1:54:09] murderer
[1:54:10] church pulling police i pulled the
[1:54:12] trigger holly not once
[1:54:15] bullet jam up put another one in not
[1:54:18] twice
[1:54:19] he kept putting him in there as long as
[1:54:21] he could see him he kept reloading
[1:54:22] he wanted to kill somebody he wanted
[1:54:25] somebody to feel some pain
[1:54:28] let me ask you a question was he not a
[1:54:30] prophet in that moment
[1:54:36] church i'm trying to rise you above your
[1:54:39] trials
[1:54:41] because what satan does when we go
[1:54:42] through things he tries to make you feel
[1:54:44] condemned
[1:54:46] but could it be god allowing things to
[1:54:48] happen so he can rise it up and sweep it
[1:54:50] off
[1:54:54] look church now all those boys got out
[1:54:56] of his sight
[1:54:57] he takes the same bullet that jammed up
[1:55:00] put it back in put it in the gun
[1:55:02] power and now he has a testimony that
[1:55:05] god protected him from being a murderer
[1:55:09] and he wasn't even in the office of a
[1:55:12] prophet yet
[1:55:13] but he was still a prophet
[1:55:16] now he has a testimony that earlier when
[1:55:19] i when i get in a place where i'm angry
[1:55:21] remember
[1:55:22] he used to be a boxer because he had he
[1:55:23] had a temple
[1:55:28] but god is going to purge and bring all
[1:55:30] the stuff out hallelujah
[1:55:32] so when he gets him in his office to use
[1:55:35] them none of that stuff will be a factor
[1:55:38] think about hollywood he goes from that
[1:55:39] point to getting beat up the test of an
[1:55:41] innocent child see church when you go
[1:55:43] through your things
[1:55:44] you have to go back and reflect and see
[1:55:45] what god has done in you already
[1:55:48] because in that moment when he tried to
[1:55:50] kill her he still was a prophet amen
[1:55:53] he just hadn't stepped in the office yet
[1:55:55] so what was god doing
[1:55:56] god was protecting that seed he was
[1:55:58] protecting that gift
[1:56:00] now he takes that same man who got beat
[1:56:02] up by those little boys
[1:56:03] that he wanted to kill put him in a put
[1:56:06] him in a meeting where a man would spit
[1:56:08] in his face
[1:56:11] you know what ain't no murder there no
[1:56:13] more
[1:56:17] ain't no fighting there no more
[1:56:19] hallelujah
[1:56:20] what's happened it's been purged
[1:56:24] now he's gonna bleed for some food that
[1:56:27] the whole world would see
[1:56:31] that the whole world would wish they had
[1:56:33] that kind of power
[1:56:43] he's going in that in that moment he's
[1:56:46] going to reflect
[1:56:48] the heart of god
[1:56:54] church is easy for us to quote a good
[1:56:55] quote quote scripture you know the bible
[1:56:57] says
[1:56:57] love those who despitefully use you
[1:57:01] you know what what about the one where
[1:57:02] it says pray for your enemies
[1:57:05] if that's just a good quote for you uh
[1:57:07] uh you still got some way to go
[1:57:10] but god wants to manifest this thing
[1:57:12] look the man comes running down the
[1:57:14] aisle
[1:57:15] all the other preachers jumped up and
[1:57:16] they gone because they didn't see
[1:57:18] what he could do the prophet standing
[1:57:21] there
[1:57:22] the man said you snake in the grass i'ma
[1:57:24] do this i'm gonna do that to you i'm
[1:57:26] gonna do everything
[1:57:27] he just said didn't move
[1:57:31] he said i'm gonna break every bone in
[1:57:33] your body the man
[1:57:35] who was an undefeated boxer
[1:57:39] brother was an undefeated boxer
[1:57:43] six second smith hello that's what he
[1:57:46] was trained by
[1:57:47] so if he wanted to fight he knew how to
[1:57:49] fight harley
[1:57:51] and i'm pretty sure he could have tucked
[1:57:52] that man down because back in those days
[1:57:55] they wasn't fighting with gloves he was
[1:57:56] bare knuckles
[1:57:58] hallelujah but in that moment hallelujah
[1:58:01] he was fighting a different way it
[1:58:04] wasn't a physical affair
[1:58:06] anymore hallelujah he says even when
[1:58:08] you're bringing forth fruit
[1:58:10] i'm approaching that you bring forth
[1:58:11] more fruit church now you're standing
[1:58:13] there
[1:58:14] and the man says no that ain't what he
[1:58:18] did ain't what it did
[1:58:21] because i haven't been preaching i might
[1:58:22] have been got too close to one of y'all
[1:58:23] and spit on you
[1:58:25] and you be like amen brother amen
[1:58:32] amen brother preach oh you know somebody
[1:58:34] spit on you trying like you ain't see it
[1:58:42] you know i ain't doing that
[1:58:43] intentionally so it's all right that
[1:58:45] spit don't hold the same weight as me
[1:58:48] purposely getting in your face
[1:58:50] and going
[1:58:54] that's what this man did it wasn't just
[1:58:57] no you talking i'm talking to you and
[1:58:59] a drip or two hit you on the chin or hit
[1:59:02] you on the top of your eyes so you know
[1:59:03] you saw it
[1:59:07] that's not a real battle you're looking
[1:59:08] at me like i'm still your brother
[1:59:10] brother spit on me but
[1:59:11] he's still my brother that was love spit
[1:59:16] he's still my brother but the same
[1:59:18] person
[1:59:19] come out be the same uh human being come
[1:59:22] and gargle on you and you know
[1:59:26] the intent is wrong look you in your
[1:59:29] face
[1:59:30] rail back with some wind
[1:59:38] and you tell me nothing don't rise up in
[1:59:40] you
[1:59:43] church listen to me good in that moment
[1:59:47] nothing was there in that prophet
[1:59:55] this man railed back remember he was
[1:59:58] angry
[1:59:59] he was out of his mind so he just walk
[2:00:02] up and say
[2:00:02] ah no
[2:00:06] he's putting a stamp on it
[2:00:10] and the prophet said i knew better than
[2:00:12] to say anything
[2:00:14] now catch the scene spit dropping down
[2:00:16] his face
[2:00:20] i knew better than to say anything
[2:00:24] dude
[2:00:28] and then something spoke out of me
[2:00:33] since you have decided to challenge
[2:00:37] the spirit of the lord think about this
[2:00:41] where was the lord
[2:00:45] where was the lord the lord was
[2:00:48] in that little frail body that just got
[2:00:50] spit on
[2:00:54] but just like he always did he wasn't
[2:00:57] going to fight with physical strength
[2:01:00] read your bible he never fought with
[2:01:02] physical strength
[2:01:05] it was always a spiritual affair holy he
[2:01:08] said i can call
[2:01:09] leaders of angels but he didn't do it
[2:01:14] holy church the prophet said that would
[2:01:16] speak going down his face
[2:01:18] hallelujah church you might say brothers
[2:01:20] you believe that yeah i believe it
[2:01:22] i believe that i wasn't there but i
[2:01:24] believe it hallelujah
[2:01:26] because we've all gone through things
[2:01:27] where we've been tried
[2:01:29] and when you fail what comes back to
[2:01:31] your mind how the profit
[2:01:34] overcame
[2:01:36] that's why these things are on tape
[2:01:38] hallelujah so we can overcome hallelujah
[2:01:41] but church look even even we got to get
[2:01:43] to the place where the scriptures say
[2:01:45] somebody smack you turn the cheek
[2:01:50] glad i ain't get a bunch of amen cause
[2:01:51] y'all know some of y'all ain't there
[2:01:55] some of y'all ain't dead y'all stop the
[2:01:57] fire somebody
[2:02:00] stop the fire item didn't go underground
[2:02:02] for a moment
[2:02:03] press pastor jack i can't i can't come
[2:02:05] back to search right now
[2:02:07] can't wait till the code over
[2:02:11] no you got to deal with that demon
[2:02:13] inside you
[2:02:15] the angry demon it shows up sometimes
[2:02:18] when you be on 95
[2:02:19] behind somebody going too slow but you
[2:02:22] put stupor
[2:02:23] doing
[2:02:27] church what i'm saying it has to be
[2:02:28] something real
[2:02:30] it has to be a real reflection see god
[2:02:32] will purge us
[2:02:33] so that he can bring forth more fruit
[2:02:36] now you look at this you look at the
[2:02:37] prophet god spit on all these things and
[2:02:39] then the lord began to speak out of him
[2:02:41] since you've challenged the spirit of
[2:02:42] the lord today you're gonna fall over my
[2:02:45] feet
[2:02:46] and the man's response was i'll show you
[2:02:48] whose feet i'm gonna fall over and he
[2:02:50] railed back to hit
[2:02:51] who not brother branham he ran back to
[2:02:54] hit god
[2:02:55] let me ask you something when has god
[2:02:58] ever been touched unless he wanted to be
[2:03:02] touched
[2:03:07] that's if he and you me and me
[2:03:10] the only way to be touched is if god
[2:03:12] wants to be touched
[2:03:14] church and he rails back the punch
[2:03:16] hallelujah and the man falls over his
[2:03:18] feet
[2:03:20] and people say oh we need to get the
[2:03:22] handle on this and that blah blah
[2:03:23] probably say no this is a spiritual fan
[2:03:26] see
[2:03:27] more fruit he was already a prophet
[2:03:30] that's the same man harlow tried to kill
[2:03:33] him boys
[2:03:35] the same man the same man who had a
[2:03:37] vision
[2:03:38] of people cutting down his tree and he
[2:03:40] gave the man a quick three
[2:03:42] piece
[2:03:50] if you feel real like brother brandon
[2:03:51] had fighting in him
[2:03:53] he always said he had irish background
[2:03:56] mixed with the indian he was already
[2:03:59] fiery
[2:04:01] who ever seen a calm indian
[2:04:08] but what was it god was persian that he
[2:04:10] bring forth more fruit
[2:04:11] he was innocent though going through all
[2:04:13] that stuff and let's get back to david
[2:04:15] david hallelujah
[2:04:16] david he's premeditated murders done all
[2:04:18] these things
[2:04:19] god bless sheba all that hallelujah and
[2:04:22] now he's he's he's the baby's coming
[2:04:24] forth he's bringing uriah all the stuff
[2:04:26] trying to hide and everything and then
[2:04:28] finally
[2:04:30] he has your riot killed everything is
[2:04:32] all right
[2:04:34] he can kind of go on the ground with it
[2:04:35] and everything good
[2:04:37] but god gotta deal with him how's god
[2:04:39] gonna deal with him
[2:04:40] he's gonna show david himself
[2:04:44] that's how god deals with us it ain't up
[2:04:46] to you to come and rebuke me
[2:04:50] especially if it's not god and a lot of
[2:04:53] times that's what happened
[2:04:54] we'd be so quick and ready to rebuke
[2:04:56] somebody and it ain't even god
[2:04:59] because you're going to rebuke me i'm
[2:05:00] going if it's really god
[2:05:02] i said i'm supposed to feel your love
[2:05:06] that brother told me that for my good
[2:05:08] just like the brother told me
[2:05:09] man you sitting in the back of the
[2:05:10] church that ain't you you come to church
[2:05:12] with jeans and tennis shoes
[2:05:14] that ain't you brother d don't let the
[2:05:15] devil steal your joy

[2:06:19] religion to make them sick
[2:06:23] coming to church don't want to be here
[2:06:26] songs on the board don't want to sing
[2:06:28] that that that just aggravates me
[2:06:30] the music right there you still
[2:06:36] still won't open your mouth that's just
[2:06:39] a defiant spirit
[2:06:40] i'ma tell my secrets i'm sorry i'm gonna
[2:06:42] tell you a secret
[2:06:44] when i see that spirit and sometimes
[2:06:46] people just be
[2:06:48] you know going through things they
[2:06:49] hadn't settled in or whatever you know
[2:06:51] so i ain't quick to judge

[2:07:26] life then it's a demon
[2:07:31] it's a demon that ain't the job then it

[2:08:02] david now he does all this are you with
[2:08:04] me
[2:08:06] all the stuff david did are you with me
[2:08:08] let me ask you a question
[2:08:09] was he still a man after god's very own
[2:08:11] heart
[2:08:13] with that baby in beth shebo
[2:08:16] he still was a man out of god's very own
[2:08:18] heart even though he put your eye on the
[2:08:21] front line to get killed

[2:12:13] preaching this it's a revelation
[2:12:16] hollywood it's these i've had to
[2:12:17] overcome
[2:12:19] and it didn't start until i started
[2:12:20] going through a strenuous trial
[2:12:24] like i had one brother his daughter was
[2:12:26] gonna marry a guy that she
[2:12:27] he didn't approve of the guy was
[2:12:29] whirling you know she grew up in a
[2:12:30] christian home and all this stuff
[2:12:31] and one day the young man rolls up at
[2:12:34] him
[2:12:35] well as he rolls up and rolls up and
[2:12:37] knew he was a christian knew he was a
[2:12:38] christian man young man rolls up adam
[2:12:40] got in his face like what you gonna do
[2:12:42] old man
[2:12:43] what you gonna do pops i gotta
[2:12:46] and he said in his mind that boy was
[2:12:49] up over and down
[2:12:54] but he said he knew he couldn't do it
[2:12:56] because he did it he
[2:12:57] lost the respect of his wife and he had
[2:13:00] beat up his wife
[2:13:01] his girlfriend's boyfriend he lost her
[2:13:03] respect
[2:13:04] so what he had to do he had to take it

[2:14:06] family so much
[2:14:07] he wasn't going to do anything to make
[2:14:08] them go away what
[2:14:11] but that was the end of his trial that

[2:14:50] power in his life
[2:14:51] call him say hey i need you come pray

[2:15:10] he called him about three times he still
[2:15:12] didn't come then god started dealing
[2:15:14] with him he said see
[2:15:17] i allowed this to happen to deal with
[2:15:19] that hatred that was inside of you
[2:15:23] i used this situation to bring out that
[2:15:26] spirit of hatred hallelujah
[2:15:28] an indifference that was in you that
[2:15:31] only
[2:15:31] this young man could bring out
[2:15:39] church you don't know who i am in church
[2:15:44] oh you do look at everybody boy that was
[2:15:46] a problem that's a preacher you don't
[2:15:47] know what's down inside what we're
[2:15:49] struggling with
[2:15:51] you don't know what the next man is
[2:15:52] struggling with holly when them birds
[2:15:54] are trying to make nests on our heads
[2:15:59] but that same brother he overcame and
[2:16:02] now he can treat that young man even
[2:16:04] though he ain't safe or whatever
[2:16:05] treat him with the same love of god what
[2:16:08] was it it was
[2:16:09] hardly the purging of the tree
[2:16:13] oh my i think y'all get it church
[2:16:19] don't get so caught up in your failures
[2:16:21] for you to fail
[2:16:22] in any kind of way god has to allow it
[2:16:25] hallelujah
[2:16:26] but one thing you must realize if you
[2:16:29] are bride if you are the true seed of
[2:16:30] god
[2:16:31] your trial doesn't change the sea within
[2:16:35] because you can have a hurricane out
[2:16:36] here and take apple trees down
[2:16:39] tear down the main goal blow them over
[2:16:42] break branches crop crops everything but
[2:16:46] that tree is still standing
[2:16:48] when the season come forward to bring
[2:16:49] forth fruit it's going to bring forth
[2:16:51] the same fruit
[2:16:54] so the hurricane didn't change the life
[2:16:56] within it all it did was alter the
[2:16:58] structure a little bit
[2:17:00] but if it stays in the presence of the
[2:17:02] sun it'll straighten back up
[2:17:04] and it'll push out like it normally does
[2:17:08] church one more and then i'm gonna quit
[2:17:11] hardly
[2:17:12] i want to show that god chooses us
[2:17:15] already knowing hallelujah what we're
[2:17:18] going to do
[2:17:19] already knowing the mistakes we're going
[2:17:20] to make and like i said i want to show
[2:17:22] the power of repentance david repented
[2:17:25] remember
[2:17:26] he repented for all the things he did
[2:17:28] with bathsheba and what came out of that
[2:17:30] psalm 51
[2:17:32] created me a clean heart hallelujah we
[2:17:35] renew
[2:17:36] the right spirit within me all that came
[2:17:38] up what happened with besheba
[2:17:40] but church from that moment because he
[2:17:42] repented he never went through that
[2:17:44] again
[2:17:46] see repentance drives the spirit out
[2:17:49] hallelujah but church you look holy one
[2:17:52] more person amen
[2:17:53] there's a man in the bible his name is
[2:17:55] peter
[2:17:57] you're under him right look here we
[2:18:00] repeated with one of them
[2:18:01] peter one of them people in church who
[2:18:03] still had a little cussing demon
[2:18:04] demon in inside of him they're getting a
[2:18:07] little upset with the people at chapel
[2:18:11] i'm sick of but you know what in that
[2:18:15] moment
[2:18:16] he was cussing and doing all that stuff
[2:18:17] you know what else he was doing healing
[2:18:19] the sick and raising the dead
[2:18:26] let me ask you something when he was
[2:18:29] cussing
[2:18:30] was he not a disciple
[2:18:35] his cussing harlow didn't change his
[2:18:37] destination
[2:18:39] god knew he was going to do that hello
[2:18:42] but let's back up a little bit more
[2:18:43] hallelujah
[2:18:44] before he got there hallelujah hey look
[2:18:48] jesus came to him he said hey who do men
[2:18:51] say i
[2:18:52] am listen to this man this man was
[2:18:55] revelated
[2:18:56] revelating with a cousin demon inside
[2:19:01] another a cussing angry demon
[2:19:04] church he goes he comes in that he comes
[2:19:07] in there he says
[2:19:08] he says he says who the men say i am
[2:19:11] peter says some say they say some say
[2:19:14] jeremiah
[2:19:15] some say isaiah some say you wanted a
[2:19:17] prophet he said but who do you say i am
[2:19:19] peter said thou art the christ
[2:19:21] the son of the living god he says peter
[2:19:24] well done my son
[2:19:26] he said flesh and blood have not
[2:19:28] basically he's saying
[2:19:29] god is with you
[2:19:32] god is with you next scene
[2:19:36] next scene but but before i get there
[2:19:39] hallelujah
[2:19:40] he said god is with you and because god
[2:19:43] is with you peter
[2:19:44] i'm gonna give you the keys to the
[2:19:46] kingdom
[2:19:51] oh peter this revelation you got i'mma
[2:19:54] build my church on
[2:19:56] i want this revelation to you to be the
[2:19:59] example
[2:20:00] that's it
[2:20:03] and then peter walks out and they say
[2:20:08] we come to get jesus
[2:20:11] you come to get who y'all
[2:20:18] remember he said thou art the christ if
[2:20:20] he really understood what he was saying
[2:20:22] he knew jesus can defend himself
[2:20:25] but he got caught up in his flesh he had
[2:20:27] a little angry in him
[2:20:28] unless he still had a little fighting in
[2:20:30] him hallelujah so peter pulled out that
[2:20:32] knife you know what look church
[2:20:34] i want you to understand honey they
[2:20:36] wasn't as sharp and crafty as we are
[2:20:38] today
[2:20:39] you know we got jiu-jitsu and jeju-su
[2:20:41] and all this other soup
[2:20:44] and all this other cadate and a latte
[2:20:46] and a latte
[2:20:48] church i don't believe peter was so
[2:20:51] precise
[2:20:52] he was trying to chop off an ear
[2:20:55] he was going in for the kill he was
[2:20:58] going in for the kill but god hallelujah
[2:21:01] wanted to show him mercy only allowed in
[2:21:03] an ear
[2:21:04] even even in his anger god was going to
[2:21:07] use him to produce a
[2:21:10] miracle
[2:21:20] god allow that to happen so he could do
[2:21:23] a healing
[2:21:25] in the in the in the presence of the
[2:21:26] unbelievers
[2:21:30] jesus y'all know i feel good
[2:21:36] jesus jesus allowed it to happen did he
[2:21:39] get rid of the evidence so nobody could
[2:21:41] bring any charges against peter
[2:21:45] [Music]
[2:21:47] why why because he told peter
[2:21:50] upon this rock i'm gonna build my church
[2:21:53] so i can't get
[2:21:54] nothing into this revelation hello they
[2:21:57] ain't gonna be able to go back and say
[2:21:58] i i can't deal with peter peter chopper
[2:22:01] off no
[2:22:01] god got rid of the evidence holy because
[2:22:04] god knew
[2:22:04] he one day he was gonna be the spoke
[2:22:06] person for everybody
[2:22:10] hallelujah what was it was a pulling
[2:22:13] church approving
[2:22:15] god allowed that here to be cut off
[2:22:16] hallelujah just so he could do a miracle
[2:22:19] get rid of all peter's uh charges and
[2:22:22] everything but he wasn't done yet
[2:22:24] come on now he walking downs you know
[2:22:26] the church is scattered everybody's
[2:22:28] running
[2:22:28] covered everywhere they go
[2:22:31] cold everybody running church
[2:22:34] they say hey they're going to want to
[2:22:35] his assignment repeaters are not me not
[2:22:37] me i want i ain't down with that
[2:22:40] somebody say there you go they don't
[2:22:41] want to say no not me not me i don't
[2:22:43] know him
[2:22:44] and later come and say what you when you
[2:22:45] one of the ones
[2:22:49] i told you
[2:22:52] i told you i ain't one of them now leave
[2:22:54] me alone
[2:22:56] y'all sowing souls always dissing that
[2:22:58] messing with me
[2:22:59] probably cuts his way all the way out of
[2:23:01] the temple
[2:23:04] but this is what i want you to catch god
[2:23:07] allowed that to happen
[2:23:09] you know why because him and jesus had
[2:23:12] to make eye contact
[2:23:14] come back and read your bible god told
[2:23:17] me he said before the crow crop three
[2:23:18] times
[2:23:19] you gonna deny me holly so that last
[2:23:22] time when he denied him
[2:23:23] the bible says and he looked at jesus
[2:23:30] can you imagine you just did the wrong
[2:23:33] that god told you you was gonna do
[2:23:35] and you were unaware that you were gonna
[2:23:37] do it and you do it
[2:23:39] and now the next thing you're looking at
[2:23:40] is the eyes of jesus
[2:23:43] he probably felt by this being
[2:23:46] that's why he said man i'm going back
[2:23:48] fishing ain't no hope for me
[2:23:51] ain't no for me i give up but what was
[2:23:53] god doing
[2:23:55] even in that moment listen to me good
[2:23:58] night
[2:23:59] in that moment he still had the keys to
[2:24:01] the kingdom
[2:24:02] [Music]
[2:24:08] still had the keys to the kingdom church
[2:24:10] and look
[2:24:12] when christ came back after he was
[2:24:13] crucified peter was among those
[2:24:17] that the lord came back to hallelujah
[2:24:21] and now god's going to anoint him for
[2:24:22] the next work harlow you told me that go
[2:24:24] go go go to jerusalem and wait go just
[2:24:27] go and wait hallelujah
[2:24:28] now that it gets up there hallelujah and
[2:24:30] the anointing falls
[2:24:32] who's the person that comes out
[2:24:35] who's the first one to come out and say
[2:24:37] this is death we're not
[2:24:38] drunk as you suppose see church god knew
[2:24:41] that he was
[2:24:42] always that peter
[2:24:45] but what he had to do he had to clean
[2:24:48] him up
[2:24:49] remember like i said last night once
[2:24:51] that shell
[2:24:52] breaks away in the dirt the next thing
[2:24:55] that it sees
[2:24:56] is water and the water begins to wash
[2:24:58] the seed while it's in the dirt
[2:25:11] listen pruning what is pruning
[2:25:15] to prune a tree listen what it says
[2:25:17] trimming for tree
[2:25:19] trees health is often referred to as
[2:25:22] pruning
[2:25:23] and this is what it it involves removing
[2:25:26] branches that
[2:25:27] are diseased
[2:25:31] i don't know about y'all but i thank god
[2:25:33] for my pruning

[2:25:38] could cause a major sickness

[2:43:45] another hand of praise for the word of
[2:43:47] the lord on today
[2:43:52] and the test of an innocent child
[2:43:58] i just think it's almost impossible
[2:44:03] that everyone that was sitting here uh
[2:44:05] present those that
[2:44:06] are listening online i think it's almost
[2:44:09] impossible
[2:44:10] uh if each one did not hear from god
[2:44:14] themselves
[2:44:15] amen i believe the lord just kind of
[2:44:17] went through so many
[2:44:18] uh um situations just through the
[2:44:21] examples that
[2:44:22] our precious brother was sharing um
[2:44:25] one thing that i was saying for myself
[2:44:27] is um i love being able to come to
[2:44:30] church you know after
[2:44:31] coming uh out of a fresh
[2:44:35] trial amen i mean if something just
[2:44:38] happened to you this week and
[2:44:40] you know i mentioned um a few weeks ago
[2:44:42] we were having a wonderful service and i
[2:44:44] said now don't think that the devil
[2:44:47] ain't gonna come with a trial after
[2:44:49] something like this and
[2:44:50] you know you say those things because
[2:44:52] just
[2:44:53] just being a christian for a number of
[2:44:55] years you see it happen over and over
[2:44:57] again
[2:44:58] and i i was uh i said that and then my
[2:45:01] god
[2:45:02] uh seemed like the devil just went
[2:45:03] roughshod you know
[2:45:05] uh there in our home and and uh just
[2:45:07] just just just a number of things i
[2:45:09] think a little accident with my
[2:45:10] daughter's car and had to put that in
[2:45:12] the shop
[2:45:13] and and um and then you know something
[2:45:15] happened within within the business
[2:45:17] there for me and
[2:45:18] and i was like lord i was not expecting
[2:45:20] this wasn't expecting this
[2:45:22] sometimes when things happen you are
[2:45:24] ready to put up your dukes and fight
[2:45:29] but god is showing you what's really on
[2:45:30] the inside of you
[2:45:32] right and you got to learn how to just
[2:45:34] let go and let god and
[2:45:36] and sometimes you know you know you we
[2:45:38] know all the quotes that if
[2:45:39] if you fight then god can't fight
[2:45:43] you know you you know all that that come
[2:45:45] to your mind but you're still trying to
[2:45:47] scheme
[2:45:48] you're still trying to come up with
[2:45:49] something you know i'ma do this
[2:45:52] but you you come here and hear the word
[2:45:54] of god like i ain't gonna do nothing but
[2:45:55] just let god be god
[2:45:59] hallelujah it's gonna turn out just fine
[2:46:03] that thing gonna turn around in your
[2:46:05] favor just like it did job and
[2:46:07] and uh look you're gonna end up in a
[2:46:09] better position than you was at the
[2:46:11] end if you just let god have his weight
[2:46:14] i i was blessed i i i was
[2:46:18] i was blessed
[2:46:20] [Applause]
[2:46:23] and um and each one you don't have to go
[2:46:26] and remind somebody now remember he said
[2:46:28] this
[2:46:28] man that was for you you know that was
[2:46:30] no no no no no no no no
[2:46:32] everybody take they part and apply it
[2:46:36] praise god don't just let this be
[2:46:37] something that went in one ear not the
[2:46:39] other no we heard from god here today
[2:46:41] and if everybody just take they part and
[2:46:43] apply we'll all be better people
[2:46:46] i believe the prophet told us that when
[2:46:48] we come to church we can leave
[2:46:49] one or two ways we can either leave
[2:46:52] better
