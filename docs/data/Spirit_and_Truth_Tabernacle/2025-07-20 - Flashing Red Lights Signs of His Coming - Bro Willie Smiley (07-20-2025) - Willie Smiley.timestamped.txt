[4:45] Praise the Lord. Psalms 4 reads, "Hear
[4:48] me when I call, oh God, with my
[4:50] righteousness. Thou hast enlarged me
[4:52] when I was in distress. Have mercy upon
[4:55] me and hear my prayer. Oh ye sons of
[4:58] men, how long will you turn my glory
[5:00] into shame? How long will you love
[5:03] vanity and seek after leasing salah? But
[5:07] know that the Lord hath set apart him
[5:09] that is godly for himself. The Lord will
[5:12] hear when I call unto him. Stand in awe
[5:15] and sin not. Commune with your own
[5:18] heart, your own heart upon the bed and
[5:21] be still. Salah. Offer the sacrifice of
[5:25] righteousness and put your trust in the
[5:27] Lord. There be many that say, "Who will
[5:30] show us any good, Lord, lift thou up,
[5:34] Lord, lift thou up the light of thy
[5:36] countenance upon us? Thou hast put
[5:39] gladness in my heart more than in the
[5:42] time that their corn and their wine
[5:44] increased. I will both lay me down in
[5:47] peace and sleep. For thou, Lord only
[5:49] makest me dwell in safety. Amen. Let's

[6:10] praise, the honor and glory that we can
[6:12] offer, Lord, from our our lips, from our
[6:15] heart, Lord, our very being. We offer

[6:19] worthy of it. And Father, as we welcome
[6:22] you to this service, we pray that you
[6:24] would anoint every vessel here, both
[6:26] this congregation of the Lord, the
[6:28] musicians, song leader, uh the minister

[43:51] remember my family in prayer and the
[43:53] many families in prayer that lost some
[43:55] loved ones. And let's remember brother
[43:57] Jack. Let's get our Bibles out. Genesis
[43:59] chapter 6. Um, Brother Jack trying to
[44:04] make it to the service this morning. So,
[44:06] just remember him. Trust that uh they
[44:09] have safe travels.
[44:12] I'm grateful for this fan
[44:15] &gt;&gt; cuz I was I was starting to struggle.
[44:18] Not struggle. I was starting to struggle
[44:20] back then. I'm like, I don't know if I'm
[44:24] going to make it, boy.
[44:26] Amen. And as you get as you get older,
[44:30] you know, when I was young, I just felt
[44:31] like I was invincible.
[44:34] I bet I didn't feel nothing. I started
[44:37] getting into them 50s
[44:40] and boy, now I'm in them 60s and it's
[44:43] like, oo Lord,
[44:46] man, I'm talking about retirement. I
[44:48] never thought about retirement back
[44:50] then. And it's like, Lord, you got to
[44:52] make a way out of now way. Out of
[44:53] nowhere so I could go somewhere and sit
[44:57] down and relax. I was talking to a lady
[44:59] in the store every morning on Sunday.
[45:02] She she greet me and uh she wish me safe
[45:06] travel. She was like, "Man, I'm with
[45:08] you, Re.

[45:13] It's like five o'clock and and boy.
[45:18] Well, God God knows all things. Amen.
[45:21] He's able to do the exceedingly
[45:23] abundantly above all we can ask or
[45:25] think. Amen. I guess we want to greet
[45:28] our visitors. We're not quite sure uh
[45:31] who they are. Maybe they can introduce
[45:33] themselves to us.
[45:44] Amen. From whose church in Michigan?
[45:49] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[45:51] &gt;&gt; okay. Okay. Okay. Brother Ray, we know
[45:53] brother Ray.
[45:56] Amen. Uh let's let us start at the uh
[46:00] first verse of Genesis chapter 6. And it
[46:04] came to pass when men be to multiply
[46:06] upon the face of the earth and daughters
[46:08] were born unto them that the sons of God
[46:11] saw that the daughters of men that they
[46:13] were fair. And they took them wives all
[46:17] which they chose. And the Lord said, "My
[46:21] spirit shall not always strive with man,
[46:23] for that he also is flesh, and yet his
[46:26] days shall be uh 120 years."
[46:31] Uh let's skip to the fifth verse. And
[46:33] God saw that the wickedness of man was
[46:35] great in the earth and that the very
[46:38] imagination of the thoughts of his heart
[46:41] were only evil continually.
[46:45] U let's just bow our heads for a word of
[46:47] prayer.
[46:49] Gracious father, we just thank you and
[46:50] we praise you God this morning for
[46:52] allowing us another opportunity to uh be
[46:56] in the service of the living God. And uh
[46:59] we just want to uh just ask that you'd
[47:02] help us to get uh the human part pushed
[47:05] to one side so that Lord the Holy Spirit
[47:09] can just use this vessel uh this
[47:12] morning. And uh may you anoint us aresh
[47:16] Lord God forgive us of all our
[47:18] trespasses Lord. Uh we just appreciate
[47:22] you, oh God, for the season that we're
[47:24] in, Lord. And uh we we just love you for
[47:27] all things in Jesus name. Amen. Amen.
[47:30] You may be seated.
[47:32] Amen. Good to see brother Stanley
[47:35] this morning and his family and Sister
[47:39] Boy.
[47:42] Oh, folk we've been known for a long
[47:44] time. Long long time. Amen. Sister Boy.
[47:49] Uh we want to use as a little subject
[47:52] this morning, flashing red light, signs
[47:54] of his coming. And uh we've been having
[47:57] some wonderful services uh um in the
[48:01] church. I tell you what, that brother uh
[48:04] on Wednesday night, he was getting it
[48:06] in.
[48:08] He was definitely getting it in. and
[48:10] other brother Sunday and uh brother Jack
[48:12] and just you know you as a servant of
[48:15] God um uh you just want to f follow try
[48:19] to follow the just the inspiration and
[48:22] and the move of the spirit of God um as
[48:26] God is moving I believe God always has
[48:29] something amen to say to the church of
[48:32] the living God to just to keep us on our
[48:36] toes.
[48:38] Is that right? And uh we we realize s
[48:41] we've we've had a a new pope that have
[48:45] come out of America. And I'm I'm quite
[48:48] sure that you know when we we've seen
[48:51] seeing all of these different uh
[48:53] prophetic things come to pass. It just
[48:56] kind of moves us in moves us in a
[48:59] certain way. And and also it's it's just
[49:02] a real indication of of where we are.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; Is that right? You know, the Bible says
[49:09] that uh no man knows the day or the
[49:12] hour. Is that right? When when he's when
[49:15] he's going to come. But but you know,
[49:18] God is God is sovereign.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; God God, you know, don't really leave
[49:23] anything to just chance. I think God God
[49:28] uh I I was thinking about something that
[49:30] I I wanted to preach, but I ended up
[49:32] here uh just working with with prophecy
[49:36] and just to try to show how it's it's
[49:39] it's you know, we give the devil credit
[49:42] for a whole lot of stuff
[49:44] &gt;&gt; that we shouldn't be giving the devil
[49:46] credit for
[49:47] &gt;&gt; because it's it's it's the the prophecy
[49:50] of the scripture
[49:52] &gt;&gt; that that's causing uh a a lot of these
[49:56] different things to take place. Is that
[49:58] right? You know, the Bible says uh that
[50:01] his word can't return unto him void that
[50:04] it it has to accomplish. So, it's it's
[50:07] the prophecy of the scripture that's
[50:11] overseeing modern events.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; I think brother Jack preached modern
[50:16] events made clear by prophecy.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; Is that right? You know, we see things
[50:22] and we get in the flesh and and and and
[50:26] you know, we can't hardly figure out
[50:29] things and but we we got prophecy of the
[50:33] scripture
[50:34] &gt;&gt; that has let us know um um what this
[50:38] season would be
[50:41] &gt;&gt; and what would be taking place in this
[50:43] season. Is that right?
[50:45] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Outside of that, you know,
[50:48] we we all are kind of be like the
[50:50] scripture says because we
[50:54] uh men's hearts is failing for fear. We
[50:57] we will all be fretful. Is that right? A
[51:00] little neurotic.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; We just probably is a tad bit neurotic,
[51:06] but you know, we we thank God that that
[51:09] we got a third pull.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; Is that right? that that you know and
[51:14] and I've been been listening to the
[51:16] inspiration
[51:18] uh of of the ministry. We ought to be
[51:21] grateful that we do have a third pull
[51:24] &gt;&gt; that's that's working this morning.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; Is that right? He lets us know it'll
[51:30] work in a greater measure as the the the
[51:32] squeeze come down which we're actually
[51:35] being squeezed this morning. Is that
[51:38] right? But but we we have something in
[51:43] us by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[51:46] that's keeping us.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[51:49] &gt;&gt; When when the flesh wants to give up,
[51:51] when the flesh wants to quit, when the
[51:54] flesh wants to go back, there's
[51:56] something in us that's holding the rain.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. You know, we used to sing that
[52:03] song. Something deep inside of me.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; Telling me go ahead.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; Something deep inside of me telling me
[52:15] go ahead. Y'all come on sing with me.
[52:17] Something deep inside of me telling me
[52:21] go ahead. Go ahead.
[52:24] Hey, go ahead. Now, I know it's hot, but
[52:28] we going to have some churching here
[52:29] this morning.
[52:31] Is that right?
[52:33] &gt;&gt; We thank God for for what's inside of us
[52:36] &gt;&gt; that's that's that's pushing us.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Telling us, you know, you
[52:42] can make it.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; I feel like brother Wesco this morning.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; Brother Wesco sometime was saying got
[52:50] this song.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. But but we we want to we want to
[52:55] start right here. We want to read us a
[52:57] couple of quotes and and continue to
[52:58] move on. Right.
[53:01] We we want to see the signs of his
[53:04] coming.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[53:07] &gt;&gt; Uh God God will not allow us to be
[53:10] caught off guard.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[53:14] &gt;&gt; If you're caught off guard, it's your
[53:15] own fault.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; I'm going to say that again.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; If you're caught off guard, if you don't
[53:22] make it, it's your own fault.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; It it it won't be the ministry's fault.
[53:27] It'll be your own fault.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Because you know of of the word that's
[53:33] been preached and especially in the hour
[53:35] that we living in uh in end time evangel
[53:40] evangelism 1962 it starts out with uh
[53:43] the red lights is flashing.
[53:46] He said the signs down the signs down
[53:50] his coming is at hand. How how many
[53:53] believe that? Amen.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; He says in Isaiah the 60th chapter, he
[53:58] says, "Darkness has covered the earth.
[54:02] Gross darkness will cover the people,
[54:05] but thank God for light."
[54:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; You know, this is definitely a dark
[54:10] hour.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Just just when when we think about the
[54:14] the the minds and the concepts and the
[54:18] precepts of man, man, men are evil.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[54:23] Folk folk folk do things now that folks
[54:26] wouldn't have done 40, 50, 60 years ago,
[54:31] &gt;&gt; right? You you just look at this this I
[54:35] don't want to pick on the younger
[54:36] generation, but the these YNs, man, they
[54:39] something serious.
[54:42] Y'all think I don't know nothing, don't
[54:44] you?
[54:46] You know, you and you and you know I
[54:52] forget I'm over 60 so I'm in a whole
[54:55] another category now right but these
[54:58] these just the the the mindset man
[55:04] uh of this generation they different
[55:08] &gt;&gt; you know even I remember brother Israel
[55:11] uh read this quote and I don't have a
[55:13] quote but it's just coming to my mind it
[55:14] says each generation gets 10 times worse
[55:17] than the next
[55:19] &gt;&gt; and and we could we could really we
[55:21] could really see when I was coming up we
[55:24] we respected folk.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; We we respected the police.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; It's it's you know different things that
[55:31] we respect
[55:33] nothing and nobody
[55:35] &gt;&gt; is that right? They shoot at the police
[55:37] just like they shoot at the average
[55:39] person.
[55:40] It's it's just you know we was just
[55:42] taught you know respect and fear the
[55:45] police come you you know now it's man
[55:48] well who are you
[55:50] &gt;&gt; right
[55:51] &gt;&gt; but it's just the sign of our releasing
[55:58] &gt;&gt; it's a it's an indication
[56:00] of the the the the lateness the attitude
[56:05] of the people it's a it's a sign of the
[56:08] lateness of the hour and just how dark
[56:12] it is.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; Right.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; You know, uh at times, you know, I I
[56:18] listen to some of the podcast uh and I'm
[56:21] like I'm getting to the place where it's
[56:23] like, man, this stuff is draining.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; It it's it's draining because this stuff
[56:29] is just so far away from scripture,
[56:33] &gt;&gt; right? and and the principles and the
[56:36] things that's being presented to this
[56:38] generation man is so far away from Bible
[56:43] that if you you feed on this you be
[56:45] messed up
[56:47] &gt;&gt; right and a gener and you you find a
[56:50] generation is just so messed up be
[56:54] because of what folks are feeding on
[56:57] &gt;&gt; I'm grateful for a seven course meal
[57:00] this morning
[57:01] &gt;&gt; is that right I'm grateful for a seven
[57:04] course meal this morning, right? Be
[57:08] because you know what a caucus is, there
[57:10] you'll find the eagles gather.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; You'll find eagles feeding upon eagle
[57:17] food.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[57:19] &gt;&gt; And and that food is this is the thing
[57:22] that that gives us strength
[57:25] &gt;&gt; to overcome and understanding to
[57:28] overcome in the age that we're living
[57:30] in. Amen.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; Cuz it it's it's dark.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; Right. But it's light at the same time.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; But you find people will choose darkness
[57:43] over light.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I'm grateful for light.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm I'm grateful for for a prophet.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; Watch. He says the end time messenger
[57:59] and message should meet the end time
[58:02] conditions.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; Right? See these conditions brought us
[58:08] amen.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; See he c he couldn't have come before
[58:16] the evening time.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; Right. He had to come in its season.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. When when the conditions
[58:27] were right for our going,
[58:30] &gt;&gt; right?
[58:32] &gt;&gt; And I'm I'm grateful because what he
[58:35] brought me was a perspective.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; A clear understanding.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; Right.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; So, because wi without without that, we
[58:46] look church, we'd never get we'd never
[58:49] get out of here. That's true.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Right. We we we be sucked up. We take
[58:54] the mark of the beast. Is that right?
[58:57] &gt;&gt; Because look, just look at people's
[58:59] perspective even on the mark of the
[59:01] beast. Yes, sir.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; Right. Not realizing it's a religious
[59:05] mark, not some tattoos and you know, we
[59:08] we got people looking for all sorts of
[59:10] things and but you know, we we have
[59:13] understanding.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; Right. That that it's a it's a religious
[59:19] mark. is turning down the word for your
[59:22] day.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; The word in its season.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Seeing people looking for, you know,
[59:29] tattoos and, you know, and and and
[59:32] steady turning down the word
[59:35] &gt;&gt; all the time. Glory to God.
[59:39] But his ministry, he said the end time
[59:41] messenger and message should meet the
[59:45] end time conditions.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Don't you think so? He say this message
[59:51] could not have been preached 40 years
[59:53] ago. Now
[59:55] &gt;&gt; that was during his time. We know we way
[59:58] up the road from that. The messages has
[1:00:01] come and that's what we're feeding on,
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; right? But in in 1962, end time
[1:00:06] evangelism,
[1:00:08] right? He was letting us know this
[1:00:10] message couldn't come to its appointed
[1:00:13] season.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; Right? Amen. He says this message could
[1:00:18] not have been preached 40 years ago. No,
[1:00:21] the end time message and messenger has
[1:00:24] got to meet.
[1:00:27] He says back there, you know, and and I
[1:00:29] I just want to stop here and label for a
[1:00:32] second. These principles are difficult
[1:00:36] if you're not predestinated
[1:00:39] be
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; because you you don't see how important
[1:00:44] God sending us a prophet is
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; right
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; because we speak about God sending us a
[1:00:52] prophet and it's like you know well well
[1:00:54] why is he so important and you know you
[1:00:56] mean to tell me y'all y'all fighting
[1:00:58] over it's like you just don't understand
[1:01:02] the importance
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; this is because this just goes beyond
[1:01:06] just church going. Yes, sir.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; This morning, this ain't just about
[1:01:12] church going. Yes, sir.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; This this is great. This is feeding our
[1:01:17] souls. Amen. A perspective that'll keep
[1:01:21] us anchored in the day and hour that
[1:01:23] we're living in. Is that right?
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. We we needed Malachi for
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; in in the day that we're living in. Is
[1:01:33] that right?
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Be because this is the day of false
[1:01:37] anointed ones.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Genu and see it's so
[1:01:44] deceiving because you see people
[1:01:46] anointed.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; Genu genuine genuinely anointed.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; But what are they teaching?
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; That's it. See,
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham say it's it's a genuine
[1:02:00] anointing upon them.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. But but it's their
[1:02:06] teaching. What are they teaching the
[1:02:09] people?
[1:02:10] [Music]
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; That that makes the difference. What are
[1:02:15] you feeding on? What are you being
[1:02:16] taught?
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You know, it's it's so
[1:02:21] important for us in this hour with kids
[1:02:23] to make sure we teach our kids if
[1:02:25] they're going to have any hope in this
[1:02:27] in this age that we living in to teach
[1:02:30] them biblical principles.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. As parents, you got to
[1:02:35] have that understanding, right?
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; Cuz it's different.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; It's different now, sir.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:02:46] and and you can't afford for for your
[1:02:49] children to feed upon the things that
[1:02:53] you know that's out here now,
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; right? Glory to God.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; It's important that that if they going
[1:03:01] to have any hope, you know, the Bible
[1:03:03] said train them up in the way that they
[1:03:04] should go,
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; right? it, you know, cuz they might
[1:03:08] struggle, they might venture out, they
[1:03:10] might drift away from, you know, uh,
[1:03:13] what's been taught, but what's been
[1:03:16] taught goes with them when they walk
[1:03:18] out.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Right? What's been taught, follow them,
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; see, you know, when I was when I was
[1:03:26] young and I was a little bit wild. I
[1:03:29] wasn't like the Yins now, you know, but
[1:03:31] I was a little wild, you know, and I
[1:03:34] hung with some I hung with some wild
[1:03:36] guys.
[1:03:38] They was like the Yins of that day. We
[1:03:40] were our Yu
[1:03:43] of of of yesterday
[1:03:45] and they they they would do things and I
[1:03:47] be like, man, I can't do that.
[1:03:51] boy, there was there was a consciousness
[1:03:54] there
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; that there was something there,
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; you know, uh that kept me from from
[1:04:01] crossing certain lines,
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; right? Amen.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; Cuz a lot of them didn't grow up in
[1:04:07] church and all of that. All they knew is
[1:04:09] is hood life and uh so there was no line
[1:04:12] there. But for me, you know, man, I went
[1:04:15] to church.
[1:04:18] Glory to God. I I know what it's like to
[1:04:21] sit next to grandma in church.
[1:04:24] Y'all ought to preach with me up in
[1:04:26] here. I remember I got some I got me and
[1:04:30] my three older cousins. We was talking
[1:04:33] the other last Sunday. Matter of fact,
[1:04:35] on my way I called and we chatted
[1:04:37] chatting it up. They were older than me,
[1:04:40] but I live with my grandmama and and
[1:04:43] they live with their parents. And man,
[1:04:46] after Sunday school, boy, we used to go
[1:04:48] to the store and wander around and well,
[1:04:53] one day my grandma would say, they used
[1:04:55] to call me Woody. I don't know where
[1:04:57] they get Woody from Willie.
[1:05:02] And and and my grandmama say, "Boy, come
[1:05:04] here." Say, "Where you be at outside of
[1:05:08] school?" Uh, yeah. Ain't no lying to
[1:05:10] grandma back in them days. Boy, that
[1:05:13] gets you good in you. I'm talking about
[1:05:15] a good put you to sleep whooping.
[1:05:21] When they finished with you, you going
[1:05:22] to bed.
[1:05:25] She said, "Boy, let me tell you
[1:05:26] something. When Sunday school out, you
[1:05:29] and your brother better park y'all parts
[1:05:34] right next to me." Boy, I used to be mad
[1:05:39] watching them pick on me. Boy, we f to
[1:05:41] go to the store.
[1:05:44] Well, y'all go ahead and start going to
[1:05:45] sit next to grandma cuz I ain't going to
[1:05:48] get no whooping. So, y'all don't live
[1:05:50] with her. I live with her.
[1:05:55] But you know what it turns out? living
[1:05:58] with her and those those conversations
[1:06:01] that I would have
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; uh uh on a daily basis with grandma is
[1:06:08] what helped me through even when I was
[1:06:10] struggling
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; with with my identity.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; Is that right? All all of and I I could
[1:06:17] look back and I understand a lot of
[1:06:19] things that she said and a lot of things
[1:06:22] that she did. parents when I was, you
[1:06:24] know, 12, 13 years old and a little
[1:06:27] younger. Um, I I couldn't What you
[1:06:31] talking about, granny?
[1:06:33] But, but now I look back and I've
[1:06:35] developed a little bit and and I realize
[1:06:38] the conversations that I had and the
[1:06:40] things that my mom tried to tell me. So,
[1:06:43] you know, we we're we're blessed. Is
[1:06:46] that right, you young people, you know,
[1:06:49] and I'm going to move on. Y'all know me.
[1:06:51] Ain't no telling where I'm going to go
[1:06:52] this morning, but I got some notes. But
[1:06:55] we'll see
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; when when when inspiration I follow
[1:06:58] inspiration.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; But you know, you young people, you
[1:07:02] ought to be grateful
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; for for being up under a ministry,
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; right? And for for for the information
[1:07:13] uh uh um uh that you're getting. Is that
[1:07:17] right?
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; Good to have brother Jack with us this
[1:07:19] morning. Uh uh that that's that's a
[1:07:23] blessing. You you you don't want to take
[1:07:26] that that lightly.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Don't take the
[1:07:30] conversation cuz you know we like to
[1:07:32] stick out our lips and poke out and
[1:07:34] stomp and kick.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; I was one of them too,
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; right? No, no, don't don't do that. Try
[1:07:42] to try to ponder, try to think about uh
[1:07:46] the importance of the information that
[1:07:50] you're getting. Is that right? Well, I'm
[1:07:52] only 10, but one day you'll be 20.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; By these years go by so fast. One day,
[1:07:59] you know, I was 25 when I got saved and
[1:08:02] now I'll be 63 in a couple of days.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Time has a way of passing
[1:08:09] us by.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. And so in order in order
[1:08:14] to make it and be productive, you know,
[1:08:16] you got to think about the information
[1:08:20] and and feed upon it and and and and see
[1:08:24] the importance in it and and why why are
[1:08:27] they saying it? Is that right?
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; You know, because if a real good parents
[1:08:33] parents, we make a lot of mistakes. Is
[1:08:34] that right? Come on, parents. Y'all
[1:08:36] ain't perfect. Come on, parents.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Let me hear you real loud. Come on,
[1:08:40] parents.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Cuz I know I ain't the only one made a
[1:08:44] whole lot of mistakes.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Y'all Yeah. This generation got it
[1:08:52] a lot better than than than us, right?
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Because they got better information.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; You know, they got the whole mind of
[1:09:00] God.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; They they they they feed from the the
[1:09:05] the the opening open word.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:09] Everything is revealed,
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; right? You know, it it was so much error
[1:09:16] in in the principles and whatever we was
[1:09:19] trying to feed upon to to to grow up and
[1:09:23] try to be productive and make ourselves
[1:09:26] and men and you know, I know hindsight
[1:09:29] is 2020, but man, given what I got now,
[1:09:33] boy, I wish I could go back and do it
[1:09:35] all over again, but life just don't work
[1:09:37] like that. Amen.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; You know, maybe maybe you know, I guess
[1:09:41] that's why they call it grandparent,
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; right? You get a doover with your
[1:09:48] grandchildren.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; You you able to you you able to pass on
[1:09:52] information to your grand that you
[1:09:55] didn't have so much of, right,
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; when you were raising your children. You
[1:10:01] was raising your children as you was
[1:10:04] raising yourself.
[1:10:08] Oh, come on.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; We was we was immature.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Sometime we like to think how mature we
[1:10:15] was, but when we go back and look like,
[1:10:17] oo,
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; I did that. Like Erl said, "Did I do
[1:10:22] that?" Yes, you did. Sure you did.
[1:10:26] But But it was all a part It was all a
[1:10:29] part of growth.
[1:10:32] It's all a part of mature. So y'all got
[1:10:34] that, young people. Yeah,
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; you know the the the But give me five
[1:10:40] minutes on it, young people, and I'm
[1:10:41] going to move on. It's it's hurt. It's
[1:10:44] hurting to watch this young generation
[1:10:49] cuz I know for me, it's hurting to watch
[1:10:51] this young generation
[1:10:54] do the things that we we try to uh show
[1:10:58] them that's not right.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; Right. Come on.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Come on. Yes, sir.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Come on. See, we we try to we try to
[1:11:09] share the positive,
[1:11:12] but but it's the negative that they
[1:11:14] want.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; And and see, like the first church age
[1:11:20] under the white horse rider,
[1:11:23] they couldn't see the the
[1:11:28] death associated
[1:11:30] with following false doctrine. Right.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; And and sin starts out
[1:11:38] pretty.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; all of that that you see ain't nothing
[1:11:44] behind it but death.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Cuz the wages of sin is death.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; This is life right here.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; Under the third pull. This is life.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; That's death.
[1:12:02] brother.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; And and you know, it's it's hurting to
[1:12:06] watch, you know, young people, you know,
[1:12:09] that that are raised up in church. I
[1:12:12] mean, you look around us, church, this
[1:12:15] this building shouldn't have been big
[1:12:17] enough for us when we came here.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; The the the other build these buildings
[1:12:26] never should have been big enough for
[1:12:28] us,
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; right? Not unless we, you know, took all
[1:12:31] of that.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; With with all of with all of the people,
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; come on, church. With all of the people
[1:12:39] and all of the young people and the
[1:12:41] young couples and they children
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; If we think about it, if if all of my
[1:12:47] children,
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; right,
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; and my grandchildren, all of brother
[1:12:51] Jack
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:53] children and grandchildren and and and
[1:12:57] brother Solomon and his his all of his
[1:13:00] children. He got a couple here, right?
[1:13:02] He ain't you know Nehemiah ain't married
[1:13:04] yet. At least I ain't hurting anybody.
[1:13:09] And and just on and on. Sister Vernon
[1:13:12] and all her children and grandchildren,
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; right? And just on and on and on.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Is that right? right?
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; The the kids that are raised up and then
[1:13:22] just think about all of all of the
[1:13:25] people that have come in contact
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; with the Son of Man ministry that never
[1:13:32] fully understood,
[1:13:34] [Music]
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; right? Never understood why we needed a
[1:13:40] prophet,
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; right? They went to church. They
[1:13:44] shouted. They shot. They ran around the
[1:13:47] building, but they never really
[1:13:48] understood
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; what what the ministry was all about.
[1:13:53] The ministry was never about a man.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; The ministry was about God.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; God, Amen. Veiling himself and his
[1:14:03] people.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; God bringing a perspective in this age.
[1:14:10] But you know, people like, well, you
[1:14:12] know, it's these little books and it's
[1:14:14] this man. It's like, man, come on.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; If you don't know, just say you don't
[1:14:20] know.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; Don't act like you know.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; Don't Don't run all around with
[1:14:26] misinformation.
[1:14:28] If you don't know, if you don't know
[1:14:30] what you just say, you know what? I
[1:14:32] ain't I just can't comprehend.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; I ain't really understanding what they
[1:14:38] talking about. But you know, we people
[1:14:40] are so proud now that they won't just
[1:14:43] pull the ministry to the side and say,
[1:14:45] "I got some questions,
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; you know, and I'mma keep asking them,
[1:14:50] right, these questions, cuz ain't no
[1:14:53] question too small."
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; There's no question too insignificant.
[1:14:58] You keep asking questions until you
[1:15:02] convince.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; The Queen of Sheba had a lot of money.
[1:15:07] She had a lot of fun. She had a lot of
[1:15:09] goods,
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:15:12] But she, you know what? She wasn't about
[1:15:14] to be ran off.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Right. She stayed there till she was
[1:15:19] convinced.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; She started looking around at at the
[1:15:24] order.
[1:15:26] Yes, sir.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; Watching the ministry,
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; watching Solomon.
[1:15:32] She say, "Okay, I brought this for
[1:15:34] y'all. This where I need to be.
[1:15:37] All right. But some people, most people,
[1:15:39] man, I seen it, man. I with our pastor
[1:15:43] in Okchobee, folk would come in and boy,
[1:15:46] we be dropping
[1:15:48] bombs up in there, breaking bread.
[1:15:53] This the truth in it. How I ain't shamed
[1:15:56] to say it, boy. We got something.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; And when I'mma tell you something. I
[1:16:02] know we like to follow preachers, but
[1:16:04] I'm just tell I'm brag on the God that's
[1:16:06] in me.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; When God give me something to preach,
[1:16:10] brother, I can preach it
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; by the spirit. We be trying to follow
[1:16:15] this ministry and this man,
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; brother, God give you a local shepherd.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; If you pull, he'll preach.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; I remember one lady said, one lady came
[1:16:29] in there. She sat there, "Boy, I don't
[1:16:32] remember what I preached on." She said,
[1:16:34] "This is what y'all This is what you
[1:16:36] preaching. This is what y'all feeding
[1:16:38] on."
[1:16:40] That was a joke. She never came back.
[1:16:45] Right. It was it it was something that
[1:16:47] she couldn't comprehend,
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; but she didn't stay long enough. And
[1:16:51] some would stay a few weeks, a few days,
[1:16:54] a few Sundays, a few services, and then
[1:16:57] they disappear,
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; right? Be be because it was something
[1:17:02] out of the ordinary.
[1:17:04] Yes, sir.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Cuz cuz people want the ordinary, but
[1:17:07] this is outside of the ordinary.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; This is extraordinary
[1:17:14] teaching.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; So he says the the end time message and
[1:17:22] message should meet the end time
[1:17:24] conditions. He says he says this message
[1:17:28] couldn't have come and been preached 40
[1:17:30] years. He said the end time message and
[1:17:32] message has got to meet back there in
[1:17:36] them days. They had it probably wouldn't
[1:17:40] have had probably wouldn't have worked,
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; right? But it's it it's got to cope with
[1:17:47] the end time conditions.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; These conditions got to be here for one
[1:17:55] as a sign
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; in order
[1:18:00] uh to bring the messenger and its
[1:18:03] message.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Right. Is that what he said?
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. The end time message and
[1:18:10] messenger has got to meet. He says back
[1:18:14] there in them days they had it probably
[1:18:17] wouldn't have worked but it's got to
[1:18:20] cope with the end time conditions.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Be converted. Believe God's sign. Don't
[1:18:27] believe the sign.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Believe the gospel sign.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Don't believe that.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; Don't just hurt people.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; Right. You said believe the gospel
[1:18:43] signs.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; See, if we understand what I mean,
[1:18:46] brother Brad was preaching.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Right. Glory to God. He wasn't exalting
[1:18:52] himself. He was pointing us to
[1:18:54] something.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; He understood. See, this is what I like
[1:19:01] about the message. Brother Brandham just
[1:19:03] wasn't doing random things and saying
[1:19:05] random things,
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; right? He was scriptural in his approach
[1:19:12] to the gospel,
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; right? Glory to God. Because we needed a
[1:19:17] scriptural understanding to be able to
[1:19:20] cope with the conditions,
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; right? Because we we we're living in an
[1:19:25] age of insanity,
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; right? I remember 30 some years ago and
[1:19:30] reading some of that stuff and even
[1:19:32] preaching some of that stuff and now
[1:19:34] it's like, bro,
[1:19:37] we needed that. We needed somebody to
[1:19:40] tell us about the conditions in this
[1:19:43] age.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Glory to God.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. Just look at the
[1:19:49] people,
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; right? People with all of the education
[1:19:54] and everything that we got. People are
[1:19:56] worse off than they've ever been in the
[1:19:58] history of the Bible.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; We got more hospitals, more medicine,
[1:20:03] more therapists, more psychologists,
[1:20:05] more all of this stuff. And people are
[1:20:08] worse off than they've ever been in the
[1:20:10] history of the Bible.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; The truthmen,
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; right? We we understand what's been
[1:20:18] loosed, right? But we we got something
[1:20:21] to help us to cope.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. Amen.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; Right. Because you can go to these
[1:20:28] places and listen to these people and
[1:20:30] still not get what's necessary to cope
[1:20:33] with the conditions. The only thing that
[1:20:35] helps you cope with the condition, Amen,
[1:20:38] is the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[1:20:41] word.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; That's that's it.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; You know, uh I'm not here to tell you
[1:20:49] not to get what you need. If you need
[1:20:51] that, you go get that,
[1:20:54] right? Glory to God. Cuz who am I in to
[1:20:57] stand am I to stand in the way of, you
[1:21:00] know, whatever folk need? But but I am
[1:21:03] here to say under this word
[1:21:09] has been given to us what's needed to
[1:21:12] cope.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; Well, I smoke me some weed.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; I drank me some brown.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; I smoke me some cigarettes.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; All of that stuff make you nervous, make
[1:21:30] you a neurotic. All right.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Y'all talking to somebody. Listen,
[1:21:33] church. I did all that. I smoke
[1:21:35] cigarettes and then when you ain't got
[1:21:37] nothing, you you feeding.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, Lord. Can I Can I can Can I get Can
[1:21:41] I get a cigarette, bro?
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; Boy, you will drive yourself crazy.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; You need a drink. You need a puff to get
[1:21:52] up, a puff to go down, a puff to cope.
[1:21:56] I know what I'm talking about. I work I
[1:21:59] work my little with my little baby
[1:22:00] cousin and man sometime he just drive me
[1:22:03] crazy.
[1:22:05] It's just a and the people around me
[1:22:07] some puff puff puff puff puff puff puff
[1:22:09] puff puff
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; and they ain't getting no better.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; They ain't getting no better
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; cuz those things don't make you better.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; Christ makes you better.
[1:22:21] And and for all of the reasons why I
[1:22:25] thought that that I needed those things,
[1:22:28] being sober since 1988, I realized I
[1:22:32] never needed that. I needed Jesus.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; See, to help me cope with my condition,
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; to help me to cope with my struggles.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; See, that stuff ain't going to help me
[1:22:49] cope.
[1:22:51] You say, "Man, I've been a Christian 38,
[1:22:53] but I still got my struggles."
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Right? Amen. And and you know what? I
[1:22:58] need something to help me get up in the
[1:23:00] morning, help me go through the day, and
[1:23:02] it ain't that stuff,
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; right? That just uh compound my
[1:23:08] situation, just makes it makes it worse,
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; right? I I need something to to give me
[1:23:16] rest to settle me. And the only thing I
[1:23:20] found to do that is Christ.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; It's the word. That's the only thing
[1:23:25] that settles me. That's the only thing
[1:23:27] that keeps me from blowing my brains out
[1:23:30] sometime.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; In the flesh, the flesh be feeling like
[1:23:37] giving up,
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:23:42] But there's something in me, you know,
[1:23:45] that that'll, you know, quicken a word.
[1:23:51] Boy, you put your hand to the plow, you
[1:23:52] can't turn back.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; My flesh be want to turn back sometime
[1:23:59] and give up. I'll be real with you, sir.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:24:04] Then the scripture come.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; All right. Okay.
[1:24:10] This a report I got to believe,
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Cuz I'm I'm overcoming,
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; you say, why you say stuff like that,
[1:24:19] brother? Because I know that. You know
[1:24:21] what? I don't come out here to say it,
[1:24:23] but somebody probably struggling,
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:24:28] You know, some couple, some individual,
[1:24:32] somebody feel like quitting,
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; somebody feel like throwing in a towel,
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; waving the white flag. Don't do it.
[1:24:41] [Music]
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; Come on. Glory to God. We got a message.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; That we've been given,
[1:24:51] right?
[1:24:52] Amen. He says, "Back there in them days,
[1:24:55] they they had it probably wouldn't have
[1:24:58] worked, but it's got to cope with the
[1:25:00] end time conditions." He be converted,
[1:25:02] believe the gospel signs. He says,
[1:25:04] "That's the matches of today.
[1:25:07] Wash your souls in the blood of the lamb
[1:25:10] and believe the gospel that the end time
[1:25:14] signs are here.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; They're here.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; See, boy, I'm going to keep going. Boy,
[1:25:21] I tell you, I want to get this up right
[1:25:23] quick. He says, "Here we are, the end
[1:25:28] time." He was saying that back in the
[1:25:31] 60s. Why? He could see the conditions.
[1:25:35] Yes, sir.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Right. He can see the conditions
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; when when the world was, you know, do
[1:25:44] doing their thing and all of that. Uh he
[1:25:48] could see the condition,
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; right, of the day,
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; The the condition says something,
[1:26:00] right? Yes, sir. It says that, amen, the
[1:26:04] coming of the Lord is at hand.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; He says, here we are, the end time, the
[1:26:11] red light down, flashing, coming of the
[1:26:15] Lord is at hand. Yes, sir. Listen, the
[1:26:19] end time message should meet the end
[1:26:22] time,
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Condition. He says, "Whether we've we've
[1:26:29] got off, the message ought to bring it
[1:26:32] back."
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; Right? See, the the message brings back
[1:26:38] pure understanding.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Which is so important,
[1:26:46] right, for us.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; God ain't rapturing in this age. Amen.
[1:26:52] False doctrine.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:26:56] Glory to God.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; See, in the sovereignty,
[1:27:01] the omega church and the alpha church is
[1:27:04] got to be the same church.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Right. This the same word, the same kind
[1:27:12] of life,
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; The same kind of power,
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; is that right? Glory to God.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And so, in order for that
[1:27:20] to be produced,
[1:27:23] we had to get back to the word. Amen.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; See what what they're getting out there
[1:27:31] will not produce what God is looking for
[1:27:35] in the evening time.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; Because because there's things that God
[1:27:41] is requiring that will not never be
[1:27:45] produced out there in in those the
[1:27:47] systems.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; Is that right? as as good as they may
[1:27:52] be, they could never produce because he
[1:27:55] produces that which is past.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; see what what is past got to be present.
[1:28:02] If that makes sense,
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; right? Be because if if if we're looking
[1:28:07] back to the Alpha Church as an example
[1:28:12] for us, right?
[1:28:17] Then we got to get back to the kind of
[1:28:19] word that they were preaching and that
[1:28:21] they were feeding upon to bring forth
[1:28:24] those kinds of results.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Glory to God. And see when
[1:28:31] when when when people think, well, you
[1:28:34] know,
[1:28:36] brother Brad was off with the word. He
[1:28:38] was a prophet as long as the anointing
[1:28:40] was on him. But when he wasn't under the
[1:28:43] anointing and it's like, brother, what
[1:28:45] are you saying?
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; That don't even make sense.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; The man was a prophet.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; In the mind of God,
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; like he told Jeremiah, "Before you was

[1:30:45] been fulfilled,
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; right? He takes us back to Genesis uh
[1:30:52] chapter 6
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; and the days of Noah,
[1:30:57] Matthew 24, Luke 17. What was he trying
[1:31:00] to show us? We back in Genesis.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; The prophecy of what was spoken by by

[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; God told him to build a boat, right, for
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; for the saving of the people.
[1:32:00] The message was so unusual,
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; right, that the people couldn't
[1:32:04] comprehend it.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; Ain't man ain't no water.

[1:32:23] kind of understanding.

[1:32:27] leaning to their own understanding
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; and God had given them a message that
[1:32:33] would save them,
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; right? But they was turning it down.

[1:32:59] message for 120 years,
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; right? And and and because because it
[1:33:06] was different than what the other
[1:33:09] preachers was preaching,
[1:33:12] it was criticized. Man, come on, man.
[1:33:15] Y'all heard this mad preacher talk about
[1:33:17] it's going to rain. But we never seen no

[1:41:18] 30,000 a year group of people in your
[1:41:20] church.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; But you need several millionaires to
[1:41:26] come up. You know, we be here struggling
[1:41:29] with a couple of couple of dollars.
[1:41:32] Couple of million. Don't folk raise a
[1:41:34] million dollars in the blink of an eye.

[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; Y'all ought to preach with me. Don't
[1:42:07] start me.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to be good.
[1:42:13] You see, stuff just don't make sense.
[1:42:15] But this this is the age in our first
[1:42:18] class ain't ain't good enough no more.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; We too deep and sophisticated. We done
[1:42:25] wrote books and all this. Half that
[1:42:27] stuff need to go in the garbage anyway.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Watch. He says, uh,
[1:42:38] so when we think of my text as a flash
[1:42:41] and red light, signs of his coming, it
[1:42:43] reminds me of waiting at a railroad
[1:42:45] station,
[1:42:47] right?
[1:42:50] That when a man or people stand around
[1:42:52] and many of us has, and when we was
[1:42:54] waiting to catch a train and and we
[1:42:57] can't hit the train or you don't see
[1:43:00] him, but you know it's time. Maybe the
[1:43:03] dispatcher says he's a little late. He's
[1:43:06] not exactly at time, but we don't know
[1:43:08] just when, but he will arrive soon. We
[1:43:12] know that he's coming.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; I don't care how much the critics talk
[1:43:17] about the addedity. I'm holding on to
[1:43:19] this to if this ain't that, I'm holding
[1:43:22] on to this to that cup.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; Is that right? I'm not I'm not turning
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; I I I'm just too scared to turn it
[1:43:31] loose.
[1:43:33] If if that's the right thing, I that's
[1:43:36] just how I feel.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; It's been the only thing that have kept
[1:43:39] me all these years.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; Right. Folk like to try new stuff.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; I'm just I'm weird.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; I find me a good restaurant, I'm going
[1:43:53] there.
[1:43:54] Not where I'mma be. You know, I saw
[1:43:58] brother Quinton. I'm at my little
[1:44:00] Chinese restaurant. I go there all the
[1:44:04] time. My mind be saying, "Go try this."
[1:44:08] Right. I'll be thinking about it. Boy,
[1:44:10] on my way there, I'll be like, "Nope,
[1:44:11] I'm gone until Chinese.
[1:44:14] They got everything I need. Right here.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; Right here."
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; They just said, "Sister, be going so
[1:44:23] wells take a chance." See, people like
[1:44:26] to take chances. I ain't that type.
[1:44:28] Amen.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; I don't like to take a chance with my
[1:44:32] taste buds.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; Experiment.
[1:44:38] Ain't nothing wrong with going to a
[1:44:39] different spot, though. I'm just talking
[1:44:41] about me. If you want to find out where
[1:44:44] I am, just know where I go. That's where
[1:44:46] I'll be.
[1:44:50] I don't kind of deviate.
[1:44:53] My weekends kind of be the same, but
[1:44:56] it's all right. It suits me. It may not
[1:44:58] suit everybody else. You might criticize
[1:45:01] me. I don't care. You don't go to work
[1:45:04] for me.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; You don't help me no make no money. You
[1:45:07] don't help me pay no bills. So, I don't
[1:45:09] care what you think and what you feel.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; When you start paying bills at 16617
[1:45:15] Northwest 38 Avenue, then I consider
[1:45:18] your opinion.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; I hear, brother.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; All right. When you start taking some of
[1:45:25] these pains that I be feeling in my
[1:45:27] body, uh, then I'll start thinking until
[1:45:30] then, I don't care what you think and
[1:45:32] what you feel.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; You know, when you get, you know, and I
[1:45:39] heard this from somebody, somebody said,
[1:45:41] "As you get older, I think it was
[1:45:43] brother Jack, too.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; When you start getting older, man, you

[1:47:38] of Noah,
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; right? Boy, I ain't got time to finish
[1:47:42] my thought. Yeah,
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; I just need when I start taught I need
[1:47:45] time but I ain't got time,
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; right? Cuz I can't stay on task.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; I can't cuz I cuz there's so much to
[1:47:55] say. Yes, sir.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; Brother Jack know what I'm talking
[1:47:57] about. Both time Jack. Brother Jack say,
[1:47:58] "Well, I ain't gonna finish this. I'm
[1:48:00] have to come back." Why? Because when
[1:48:02] you start talking and inspiration and
[1:48:05] and and feeling the need
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; for the people Yes, sir. I'm not never
[1:48:10] concerned about my sermon.
[1:48:13] I'm concerned about the needs
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; of the people.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; Right? I preach where was I?
[1:48:24] Brother Fred,
[1:48:26] I took a text that I preached here. I
[1:48:29] tried to preach that that text two
[1:48:31] services. Couldn't do it right because
[1:48:35] the needs of the church didn't warrant
[1:48:38] it. Right.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; Right. I had my thought. God say, "You
[1:48:42] got to ball that up.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; I got something else to talk about today
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; off the cuff." See, I'm glad I ain't
[1:48:50] just no no preacher.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; I'm glad that I I can get out of the way
[1:48:56] and and let God use the gift.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; Thought I'd preach the second service.
[1:49:02] Couldn't do it.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Then went to brother
[1:49:06] Stasis and preached the thought.
[1:49:09] cuz his church didn't need what I right
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; what they needed.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; Every sermon, every service needs
[1:49:18] something else. Yes,
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; My brother just talking. All right. In
[1:49:23] 20 years and you going to see your son
[1:49:25] in jail?
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; Hopefully not. Hopefully not your
[1:49:29] daughter
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; cuz they going crazy just as well as the
[1:49:34] Huh. You like, "Boy, I tell you what, I
[1:49:38] wish we' have got more of that kind of
[1:49:40] preaching."
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; It's almost like now people got you so
[1:49:45] pigeoned down you can't hardly preach.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; You preach hard. I ain't going back.
[1:49:52] That's too hard. They too legalistic.
[1:49:55] What about God? Look, we wouldn't have
[1:49:58] made it in Paul's day,
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; John the Baptist day. You bunch of
[1:50:03] snakes in the grass.
[1:50:08] Why kind of preaching that? We coming
[1:50:10] and bite.
[1:50:12] Folk folk were going in the water just
[1:50:15] as quick as they can. He called me a
[1:50:17] snake in the grass, but I'm going to get
[1:50:19] baptized.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; You talk to these people now and it's
[1:50:25] the sign of the age. You Let me tell you
[1:50:28] something. I was thinking I was thinking
[1:50:30] about this when I was when I was reading
[1:50:32] last night, the flashing red light signs
[1:50:34] of his coming, right? I know I ain't got
[1:50:36] a lot of time, right? Uh uh I was like,
[1:50:40] we I said, "Brother Brandon, I'm tell
[1:50:42] you, go back and listen to it or read
[1:50:44] the tape. I listen to the tape or read
[1:50:46] the book." Boy, he hitting hard.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; And he talking about sisters and women,
[1:50:50] which is a type of the church.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; When you see the condition that the
[1:50:54] women are in, that shows you the
[1:50:55] condition of the church, right?
[1:50:58] Well, he was ne. But it it's a sign of
[1:51:02] the day that we live in because these
[1:51:05] things was happening in the days of
[1:51:07] nowhere.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; And brother, he was just laying it in
[1:51:10] there. I was saying to myself, you know
[1:51:12] what? In modern day message, you can't
[1:51:17] preach that like that no more.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; Now, I don't been around for a good long
[1:51:22] time,
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; right? But when we got saved, Uh-huh.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. When we got saved, they was
[1:51:30] nailing it down.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; They weren't sugarcoating it and trying
[1:51:35] to make everybody feel good.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; See, in the old days, you know what was
[1:51:41] getting getting folks saved? Hell is
[1:51:44] hot.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; Huh? Hell is hot.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; Hell is hot. Yes, sir.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; Now they preaching. Boy, I'm tell you
[1:51:58] something, boy. I heard some some guys I
[1:52:03] was like, "What are y'all thinking about
[1:52:06] uh
[1:52:09] what be what be in heaven,
[1:52:13] pills, and this and that." You see,
[1:52:15] y'all minds is so contaminated,
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; bro. You won't find all of this stuff in
[1:52:22] heaven.

[1:52:53] the church, go out of the church. In the
[1:52:56] church, go out of the church.

[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm man that that you know, brother
[1:57:36] Bam, when he used to talk about
[1:57:38] predestination

[1:57:49] the term

[1:58:12] the Holy Ghost that's in me that's
[1:58:14] keeping me
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; because because I'mma tell you
[1:58:18] something. If you take the Holy Ghost
[1:58:20] out,
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; I won't be no different.
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; Than all the rest of the man the men out

[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; just like everybody else.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Brother Bam said the
[1:58:45] way the women, you know, carry
[1:58:46] themselves, he said you can't hardly
[1:58:48] blame the the men of the world.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; That's what it said. It's in there. Go
[1:58:54] back. I'm telling you what's in there.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; He said, you can't hardly blame the men,
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:59:04] without the Holy Ghost.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; Y'all think y'all be all that.
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; They got some It ain't And it ain't like
[1:59:16] it was back in the day
[1:59:19] where where you had to have game and
[1:59:23] y'all know what I'm talking about.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; Talk. You had to have a little swagger.
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; Y'all know, right?
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; You had to, you know, when I was coming
[1:59:30] up, man, you had to have a little
[1:59:32] swagger. You had to look good, right?
[1:59:34] You come be all bummy and nappy head,
[1:59:37] you know, no shaving and smelling like
[1:59:40] uhuh. You had to have your little polos
[1:59:43] on or whatever the fashion was back in
[1:59:46] them days.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; I mean, you had to have some sort of
[1:59:49] intelligence.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; To be attractive,
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; No, it ain't none of that. Why you got
[1:59:58] Why you got tattoos all over your face,
[2:00:00] on your head, and everything? Yeah,
[2:00:02] that's the attraction.
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; But that's a sign.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; Motorcycle bums and and prisoners and
[2:00:12] stuff had tattoos. The Bible say you
[2:00:14] shouldn't do it anyway.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; Right. Glory to God. But you know, plain
[2:00:22] Jane, you ain't got no tattoos. Not one,
[2:00:26] not what? Not a nail now, nowhere. Don't
[2:00:30] plan on ever getting what?
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; Ain't nothing wrong if you got your
[2:00:34] little tattoos on and all that. That's
[2:00:36] not what I'm saying
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; cuz you did that before you had any
[2:00:40] sense.
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; I just had senses back then.
[2:00:48] I'm tell it it it used to be the spirit
[2:00:50] of God that used to keep me from doing
[2:00:52] some of the crazy stuff that everybody
[2:00:53] else was doing. That's all it was.
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; Right. I remember when my boys went went
[2:00:58] with uh went to get earrings. Let the
[2:01:01] musician make the way. I I just I'm off
[2:01:04] topic. Boys boys went to get earrings
[2:01:07] and I was about the 10th grade and uh my
[2:01:11] mama told me I had I needed to do
[2:01:13] something for my mama that day. So I
[2:01:15] told the fell, "Ah, y'all go ahead." So
[2:01:17] they come back and the next day
[2:01:19] I saw them with them that earring in
[2:01:22] their ear.
[2:01:23] I like, "No,
[2:01:26] I'm glad I wasn't with y'all."
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; It was just something about me in here
[2:01:32] was like, "That ain't." And then I
[2:01:36] remember the first time um I saw him
[2:01:39] with two earrings,
[2:01:42] right? We me and Brother Jack back when
[2:01:45] we were younger, we used to go play
[2:01:48] basketball a lot. We was at gun club and
[2:01:51] uh seen this one little young fellas had
[2:01:54] two earrings. I'm like two earrings,
[2:01:57] man. I was struggling to see a dude with
[2:02:00] one. Now you got two.

[2:02:22] in your nose.
[2:02:25] They be like, "What? What? What?"
[2:02:28] Told a little young girl that I say I
[2:02:31] told her. I said, "Baby, I'll get me a
[2:02:34] princess." She said, "Yeah, baby, you
[2:02:36] ought to." And then come back and show
[2:02:38] it to me. Not
[2:02:42] just clowning.
[2:02:45] That's all it is.
[2:02:46] don't want no piercings,
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; That's a whole another spirit. That's
[2:02:53] demonic.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; Satanism,
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; spiritualism. See, people do things and
[2:03:03] don't understand the association
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; and what right and what what that says.

[2:03:30] to cover your face and head and
[2:03:32] everything with tattoos.

[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, maybe somebody need that cuz
[2:03:42] they may be thinking about soon as I'm
[2:03:44] 18, I'm going to get mad, too.
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; That's a devil.

[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; Glory to God, man. Some days some days I
[2:04:08] I sit back and be like, "Lord have

[2:04:50] but I wasn't going. And and she said,
[2:04:52] "But if you not going to go to school,
[2:04:55] you you need to get a job." I thought I

[2:08:24] could cook nothing. He said I'm taking
[2:08:28] you to my mama house.
[2:08:36] I couldn't even cook nothing.
[2:08:42] At least Gina had, you know, a couple of
[2:08:44] things on her resume.
[2:08:47] She she had a little spaghetti, a little
[2:08:49] baked chicken. She had two or three
[2:08:51] little things on the recipe,

[2:08:58] grew into, you know, her thing after a
[2:09:01] while. But hey, y'all don't want to be
[2:09:04] that. Grow up, you got children, you got

[2:09:51] [Music]
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing it again. I will be
[2:10:02] what you call me to be. Say, I will be
[2:10:07] what you've called me to be.
[2:10:12] Oh,
[2:10:13] I'll say yes.
[2:10:16] [Music]
[2:10:18] Oh Lord, I agree. My desire
[2:10:26] passionately,
[2:10:28] [Music]

[2:11:01] Lord. I agree. Oh Lord,
[2:11:05] in my desire
[2:11:09] [Music]
[2:11:10] passionately.
[2:11:14] Oh,

[2:11:22] be. That's what I will be.
[2:11:29] Come on, give the Lord a hand of praise.
[2:11:34] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:11:37] Amen. We certainly thank God for brother
[2:11:40] Smiley uh on today. as I was uh driving
[2:11:45] back, I had a chance to um tune in
[2:11:48] online and you know the um I don't think
[2:11:54] it could ever be um said enough how
[2:11:57] blessed we are uh to have ears to hear
[2:12:02] and eyes to see what the spirit is doing
[2:12:06] in this hour. As brother Smiley was
[2:12:09] saying is you just think about all the
[2:12:11] people that have passed through, family
[2:12:13] members, uh friends that have passed
[2:12:15] through and how if just that little
[2:12:17] group of the ones that we knew uh was
[2:12:21] just in church on a faithful on a
[2:12:23] faithful basis, we would need a large
[2:12:25] building, a really really large
[2:12:28] building. and um you know but but it's
[2:12:31] it's it's to me it's sad that people uh
[2:12:36] just don't understand you know just the
[2:12:38] importance of why why God sent us a
[2:12:41] prophet and and if if you've and I don't
[2:12:43] know maybe maybe people have not gone
[2:12:45] through um
[2:12:48] denominational hurt if I can use that
[2:12:51] term maybe they have not gone through
[2:12:53] that process and and watched the
[2:12:55] politics and and and all these other
[2:12:57] types of things in church and um you
[2:13:00] know it was a lot of nonsense. I
[2:13:02] remember growing up in it and it was
[2:13:04] really a lot of nonsense. Uh but not
[2:13:07] only that, if you had any experience
[2:13:09] where you you read the Bible and you saw
[2:13:12] that the Bible said something different
[2:13:14] than what they was actually teaching in
[2:13:15] church, if you haven't had those
[2:13:17] experiences, then it's hard for you to
[2:13:19] understand the importance of why God had
[2:13:21] to send us a prophet to take us back to
[2:13:24] the truth of the word.
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Uh I grew up in a
[2:13:29] household where you know a family where
[2:13:31] one side is Pentecost, the other side is
[2:13:34] Baptist and we trying to figure out
[2:13:35] which what's what's right. Right. We we
[2:13:38] see fallacies everywhere you know and
[2:13:41] but when we come to this
[2:13:45] oh glory to God
[2:13:47] uh we stop looking after we after after
[2:13:50] this found us. We didn't find this but
[2:13:52] this found us.
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. But but we thank God for his
[2:13:56] truth. We thank God for his word. Uh we
[2:13:59] thank God that uh we can see the signs
[2:14:02] and we we have something that helps us
[2:14:04] to meet the condition of this age. Amen.
[2:14:08] That's why anything happened, we're not
[2:14:10] alarmed. We're not we're not we're not
[2:14:12] um
[2:14:14] um we're not frantic,
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; right? We don't do that. when when um
[2:14:18] when they when the pope came out of uh
[2:14:21] the US and most people probably didn't
[2:14:25] see that coming, but we did. Anytime a a
[2:14:29] pope stepped down or a pope died, we had
[2:14:32] our eyes on something.
[2:14:35] People that believe this message, we had
[2:14:36] our eyes on something. We had our eyes
[2:14:39] on a prophecy. And I and and I remember
[2:14:42] brother Dwayne was the first one I heard
[2:14:44] bring it out because that I think the
[2:14:46] very day or the day um the day after the
[2:14:50] that that Pope from the US was
[2:14:51] announced, they had service there uh and
[2:14:54] brother Dwayne brought out that the man
[2:14:56] was born uh pretty much 9 months after
[2:15:00] brother Brandham spoke it.
[2:15:03] That's too perfect for me. That's too
[2:15:05] perfect for me. So here we have a uh
[2:15:09] modern events being made clear by
[2:15:10] prophecy. We have a pope coming from the
[2:15:12] United States. We have a a a woman vice
[2:15:16] president, president. And then and in
[2:15:19] that same quote, brother Random said,
[2:15:20] "It could be the Catholic Church or it
[2:15:22] could be a woman vice president,
[2:15:24] president." He said, "Both of them." And
[2:15:25] guess what? Both of them were fulfilled.
[2:15:29] &gt;&gt; Right? Both were fulfilled. So uh we
[2:15:32] have these things before us. We're
[2:15:33] closer to the coming of the Lord than
[2:15:35] we've ever been. And uh and I tell you,
[2:15:38] please don't miss it in this hour. Don't
[2:15:39] don't don't misunderstand what God is
[2:15:42] doing. Catch these signs. Uh and like
[2:15:44] like he said, even in the days of of um
[2:15:46] Noah preaching. Can you imagine that?
[2:15:49] Here God sends them a prophet, gives
[2:15:51] them a message to so they can get
[2:15:53] prepared, you know, so they don't have
[2:15:54] to go through the judgment. And what do
[2:15:56] they do? They reject the prophet.
[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; They reject the prophet. Well, you've
[2:16:02] read your Bible. You've read your Bible.
[2:16:04] Those that rejected Noah's message, what
[2:16:07] happened to them?
[2:16:09] They died. Trust me, you don't want to
[2:16:13] reject the revealed word for your day.
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; God sent you a prophet. Take what that
[2:16:19] prophet says. Follow it with everything
[2:16:22] you got. Amen. This is not to bring you
[2:16:25] to a man. This is to bring you closer to
[2:16:28] Christ. Amen. God bless you, brother
[2:16:32] Smiley. Thank you so much for the word
[2:16:35] of the Lord on today.
[2:16:37] Amen. As it was said earlier, um today
[2:16:43] is actually our last day fellowshipping
[2:16:45] here. And boy, did they send us out.
[2:16:48] They did they send us out of here. Y'all
[2:16:50] ain't coming back. We shutting off the
[2:16:52] AC on you.
[2:16:55] I think they made a mistake. We're we're
[2:16:57] not planning to be here next week uh
[2:17:00] because we'll be having our meeting
[2:17:02] there in uh at Palm Beach Gardens High
[2:17:04] School. And um the way that the school
[2:17:06] district works is um they put it on a
[2:17:09] schedule as to when the AC supposed to
[2:17:11] be on and when it's supposed to be off.
[2:17:13] And anytime it's off like this, there is
[2:17:16] no uh calling the um the the staff here
[2:17:22] at the the school and saying, "Hey, just
[2:17:24] turn on the AC." It don't work that way.
[2:17:27] It go through a whole process all the
[2:17:29] way back at the district level and uh
[2:17:31] and if they forgot to turn it on,
[2:17:34] you just have to deal with it. So, we
[2:17:37] thank God our journey has come to an end
[2:17:40] and uh we appreciate 3777 Jo. Um every
[2:17:45] time we pass by this location, we'll
[2:17:47] remember uh our days that we were here.
[2:17:50] As brother uh brother Quinton was
[2:17:52] telling me, uh really we're coming on
[2:17:54] our 4-year mark. August would be our
[2:17:57] four-year mark that we've been here in
[2:17:59] uh this building. But now the Lord has
[2:18:01] opened up another place for us to go and
[2:18:03] to worship. And uh we'll be sharing a
[2:18:06] facility there uh a church that has
[2:18:09] opened up their doors to allow us to
[2:18:11] come in. They only use it on Sunday
[2:18:13] mornings. So they they're giving us
[2:18:14] Wednesday nights, they're giving us two
[2:18:16] Fridays, and they're giving us every
[2:18:18] Sunday morning. uh we have to adjust our
[2:18:20] our our um times. You can just put that
[2:18:24] back up the slide there. We're adjusting
[2:18:26] our times on Sundays only. And um so
[2:18:29] Sunday's prayer will start 30 minutes
[2:18:32] earlier, go from 8:30 to 9:30. Sunday
[2:18:35] school will start a little earlier,
[2:18:36] start at 8:45, go to 9:15, and then
[2:18:40] rather than service starting at 10:30,
[2:18:41] service will start at 9:30 a.m. That's
[2:18:44] on Sundays uh only. Uh everything else
[2:18:48] will be um uh the same. So uh the name
[2:18:52] of the church that we'll be meeting at
[2:18:53] is Eagles Rest. That's not our church
[2:18:55] name. Our church name is Spirit and
[2:18:57] Truth Tabernacle. But we meet there and
[2:19:00] the address is there. 2922
[2:19:03] uh Jog Grove Acres, Florida. Uh
[2:19:06] Greenacres is actually where we started
[2:19:07] the church. Uh right around the corner
[2:19:10] from this church is where we started.
[2:19:12] And um I come to find out that this
[2:19:15] church used to be in the same plaza that
[2:19:17] we were in in Green Acres when we first
[2:19:20] started. They took over another church
[2:19:22] there that was in Green Acres at the
[2:19:24] same time we were. And then uh that
[2:19:26] church moved on and they end up
[2:19:29] following that church to their new
[2:19:30] location. They took over the first
[2:19:32] location. Then they took over their
[2:19:33] second location. And uh so we have been
[2:19:36] neighbors for a long time. And uh I just
[2:19:39] believe the hand of the Lord has us
[2:19:41] moving in this direction uh for this
[2:19:43] season until we move into our own space.
[2:19:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we just continue to trust the
[2:19:51] Lord. Uh brother JZ came and preached
[2:19:54] last week and um I went and walked
[2:19:57] around some property. That's all I can
[2:19:59] tell you. And I'm just waiting on the
[2:20:01] Lord to manifest. Amen. His word. So God
[2:20:06] is good. God is good. Amen. So, we thank
[2:20:10] God for all things. Thank God for you
[2:20:13] saints that came to be with us. Amen. On
[2:20:15] today, are y'all cruising
[2:20:19] work? Okay. Will you be here next
[2:20:22] weekend?
[2:20:25] Don't think so. Okay. All right. Well,
[2:20:27] good to have you all with us. Amen. Uh
[2:20:29] on today. Um, so next week church, uh,
[2:20:33] brothers, we're going to meet at the
[2:20:35] storage on next Thursday at 1:00 at the
[2:20:38] storage. That's where we have to get our
[2:20:40] things out and then take them to, um,
[2:20:43] the location for the meeting. So, we'll
[2:20:45] do that on next Thursday. We will have
[2:20:47] no service on uh, Wednesday night. Uh,
[2:20:50] we'll be preparing ourselves for the
[2:20:51] meetings on next weekend. Let's have a
[2:20:53] word of prayer. Amen. Before we depart,
[2:20:56] Father, we thank you for uh all that you
[2:21:01] have done and all that you continue to
[2:21:03] do.
[2:21:05] We are
[2:21:07] grateful as Lord,
[2:21:10] your man's servant came this morning and
[2:21:12] shared this thought on flashing red
[2:21:15] light signs. It was coming so much in
[2:21:17] that sermon as he's just even sharing at
[2:21:20] the end, brother Brandham calling out
[2:21:23] against the various sins of the people,
[2:21:26] Lord, and and uh it has to be dealt
[2:21:28] with. The people need to realize that
[2:21:31] the the enemy is attacking, Lord, in in
[2:21:34] in every area. So, Father, help us to to
[2:21:37] hear what the spirit is saying to us.
[2:21:40] That we would uh align ourselves with
[2:21:42] the word of God. That Lord Jesus, you'd
[2:21:45] be pleased with the lives that we will
[2:21:48] live. We thank you that you have given
[2:21:49] us eyes to see uh what the enemy is
[2:21:53] doing in this hour. And also, Father,
[2:21:56] you're giving us eyes to see what the
[2:21:57] spirit is doing in this hour. Lord, you
[2:22:01] have uh sent us a prophet and through
[2:22:04] the the revelation that has come forth
[2:22:07] uh through that prophet, the my God, we
[2:22:10] we the prophecies that have gone forth,
[2:22:12] we can God, we we we're reading uh
[2:22:15] tomorrow's newspaper today. And Lord,
[2:22:18] not that it alarms us and alerts us, but
[2:22:20] it helps us to prepare ourselves because
[2:22:22] we know that your coming is upon us. All
[2:22:25] these these signs, Lord, it's let let
[2:22:28] these are things that were supposed to
[2:22:29] happen before the second coming. Lord,
[2:22:31] they're right here before us. We're
[2:22:33] living in this day right now. Lord,
[2:22:36] don't let us get u mixed up and messed
[2:22:38] up. Father, help us to keep our eyes
[2:22:40] centered on you, Jesus. We ask, oh God,
[2:22:43] that as we leave this place, but not
[2:22:45] your presence, that you would go. Thank
[2:22:47] you for the saints that have come uh
[2:22:49] from far and from near to be a part of
[2:22:52] the service today, Lord. And uh we uh
[2:22:54] just uh thank you also for the years
[2:22:56] that you have given us here. And thank
[2:22:58] you for this door that was open for us
[2:23:00] to come in and have fellowship. And God
[2:23:02] now you have called us to another uh
[2:23:05] place. We go by faith knowing father
[2:23:08] that you have ordained every step that
[2:23:11] we take. We trust Lord that you would uh
[2:23:14] bless our our going out as you have
[2:23:16] blessed our coming in. And Lord, as we
[2:23:19] prepare for the meetings on next
[2:23:21] weekend, Father, move in a a mighty way
[2:23:24] in the midst of your people. May the
[2:23:25] spirit of God have the preeminence in
[2:23:28] that school. And Father, may people uh
[2:23:31] uh come one way, but leave a totally
[2:23:33] different way and lives be changed by
[2:23:35] the power of the Lord and by the word of
[2:23:38] God. We pray restoration will uh will
[2:23:41] happen in somebody's life. Oh God, we're
[2:23:43] already hearing testimonies of
[2:23:44] restoration happening. So God, we're
[2:23:46] expecting even more, Lord. Even healing
[2:23:49] in bodies and refillings and fillings of
[2:23:51] the Holy Spirit, Father, whatever the
[2:23:54] need of the people is, may they receive
[2:23:55] that. We pray, Father, that you would uh
[2:23:57] provide those that have a desire to be
[2:23:59] here, but baby Satan is is battling in
[2:24:01] their finances, God, uh supernaturally
[2:24:04] open up doors for them, Father, that
[2:24:06] they would be able to make these
[2:24:07] meetings. We've seen you, Lord, uh open
[2:24:10] up doors for people able to buy their
[2:24:11] plane tickets at the last minute. even
[2:24:13] got it less than what it was before. So,
[2:24:16] we know what you're able to do, God. You
[2:24:17] are God alone. And Father, we ask that
[2:24:20] you would move on behalf of your saints.
[2:24:22] And Lord, may they come with a heart of
[2:24:24] expectation, expecting you, Lord, to
[2:24:26] move in a in a in a very unique way.
[2:24:29] Bless us, Father, as we leave this place
[2:24:30] today. It's in Jesus' name we pray.
[2:24:34] Amen. Amen. Also, Brother Stanley, God
[2:24:37] bless you. Sister Vera, God bless you.
[2:24:39] Amen. Good to see you all. Amen. Praise
[2:24:42] the Lord.

[2:24:49] visitor. No, she not a visitor. Amen.
[2:24:53] God bless you all. Brothers will come uh
[2:24:55] and dismiss you. And don't forget uh our
[2:24:58] brothers, we have to break down the
[2:25:01] room. Amen. On today. So, let us do
[2:25:04] that. And um we'll say goodbye.
