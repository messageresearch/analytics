[35:41] Jackson.

[35:46] little gospel
[35:48] singers and u so it's good just to kind
[35:51] of take them back home like that and and
[35:53] just let them feel the anointing. I know

[37:04] us a couple times and and I always
[37:07] appreciate uh his ministry. Um had a
[37:11] chance just to fellowship a little with
[37:12] a little bit with him on yesterday and
[37:15] uh just the the insight that uh brother
[37:17] George brings uh to things. It just it
[37:21] it helps a lot, you know, and um I mean
[37:25] he's a um a man that has experienced a
[37:29] lot in his life uh being the prophet's
[37:32] son-in-law and uh but nonetheless with
[37:35] all the things that he's experienced and
[37:37] just the way that the Lord has allowed
[37:39] him to navigate uh we get a chance to
[37:42] benefit from the insight that comes
[37:44] through the seasons of navigation. Amen.
[37:48] So I'm I'm grateful. Amen. and that he
[37:50] had the time to be able to stop by and
[37:53] see us. Amen. On this morning, praise
[37:56] God. And tonight, uh he'll also be

[38:02] So, if you don't have anything to do,
[38:04] Amen. I'm sure you'll be blessed, amen,
[38:06] by just being in fellowship there on
[38:08] tonight in Boon Beach at Brother Jean's
[38:10] Church, Bride of Christ Tabernacle. So,
[38:13] that service will start at 6:00 p.m.
[38:16] Amen. Praise the Lord. Uh, also I wanted
[38:19] to um uh thank the Lord for last Sunday.
[38:24] Amen. I wasn't able to be here for
[38:26] Mother's Day, but brother Jerry uh did a
[38:30] fantastic
[38:31] job. Amen.
[38:34] and uh ministering and you know just um
[38:38] you know when when Mother's Day and
[38:40] Father's Day uh sometimes it's not easy
[38:43] to preach those sermons but uh one of
[38:46] the things I like it's just my own
[38:48] personal um conviction I guess if it's
[38:52] Mother's Day I like to try to have a
[38:53] sermon for the mothers I I really do I I
[38:56] go to the Lord and ask for a specific
[38:58] sermon to encourage mothers they they
[39:01] need
[39:01] it And uh it shouldn't just be one day a
[39:05] year, but uh but I do specifically try
[39:08] to address that. Amen. On Mother's Day
[39:10] and and uh so I asked Brother Jerry when
[39:13] I knew I wasn't going to be here and I
[39:14] said, "Could you could you get a sermon
[39:17] for the mothers?" And uh he said, "I'll
[39:19] I'll work on that, pastor." And he came
[39:22] out and just the Lord blessed Amen. Uh
[39:26] that word. The Lord blessed that
[39:29] word. Praise the Lord. And and there was
[39:32] something else that happened uh last
[39:34] Sunday uh that I was just absolutely
[39:37] blessed by. Um you know when I'm when
[39:40] I'm here, one of the things that uh my
[39:44] wife does is uh she says, you know, we
[39:47] ought to get some flowers for the
[39:49] mothers. And uh I say, "Okay." And we we
[39:52] go and we'll we'll we'll do that and
[39:53] we'll get the flowers for the mothers.
[39:55] And um so this year, Amen. just I had so
[40:00] much going on that I didn't get them
[40:02] flowers for the mothers and and we were
[40:04] sitting in our hotel room um you know
[40:07] listening to the service and uh and we
[40:10] were talking amongst ourselves say oh we
[40:12] didn't get them flowers for the mothers
[40:15] we all the way up here in North Carolina
[40:17] and didn't get them flowers I said yeah
[40:19] I'm sorry and uh while I'm saying I'm
[40:22] sorry I hear on the tape on the on the
[40:26] stream brother Jerry come up and Hey, uh
[40:30] me and Sister Melissa got some flowers
[40:32] for the
[40:33] mothers
[40:35] and praise the
[40:37] Lord. Now, I don't know who idea that
[40:40] was, Brother Jerry, but I thank I thank
[40:43] you and Sister Melissa. That's Sister
[40:45] Melissa's idea. God bless you, Sister
[40:48] Melissa. We really really appreciate
[40:51] that. Sometimes your your smallest
[40:53] gestures, you just don't know what it
[40:55] means. But I I'm sitting in a room in
[40:57] North Carolina saying, "Oh man, I forgot
[40:59] to do that." And here come the
[41:03] Cesars. Glory to
[41:06] God. I really appreciated that. Amen. I
[41:09] I thank God for it. You know, it it just
[41:11] it means something. Um when you see the
[41:15] ministry just continue to move in the
[41:17] right direction when pastors not around.
[41:20] Amen. That that mean that means an awful
[41:22] lot. So, uh I appreciate you all. Amen.
[41:25] so much. So much. We thank God for him.
[41:28] Um I think that's all I need to
[41:32] um uh mention. Oh, we have a a a guest
[41:36] minister coming not this Wednesday but
[41:38] the next Wednesday. Brother
[41:41] um Brother Thomas from Ghana. Uh brother
[41:45] Thomas, he's been here with us. I
[41:48] remember the last time he came. Um, this
[41:52] was a I have a what I would say have a
[41:56] very unique memory. There's different
[41:57] things that happened at different times
[41:59] and I never forget it. And uh so when
[42:03] brother Thomas came the last time
[42:07] um that night that he showed up on a
[42:10] Wednesday night, I I don't remember the
[42:12] sermon, but I do remember
[42:15] um that brother Garen came to church
[42:17] that night. And um and brother Thomas
[42:20] began to preach some things that was
[42:22] right in brother
[42:24] Garren's house. And uh brother Garren,
[42:28] y'all y'all might have y'all don't hear
[42:30] him too much, but that night he was over
[42:31] here screaming,
[42:33] "Amen." He sitting over here. Y'all
[42:35] remember that night? He was screaming,
[42:37] "Amen." And from that night to this,
[42:40] Brother Garren is uh taking back his
[42:43] position back there in the back and uh
[42:45] helping with the sound. But uh something
[42:49] something triggered that night that
[42:52] Brother Thomas was here. Amen. And on a
[42:54] Wednesday night, you just don't know
[42:56] when God is going to come in and speak
[42:58] to your situation. And what I found out,
[43:01] amen, is that uh the word of God has
[43:04] power to change anything.
[43:08] [Music]
[43:10] I'm I'm going to say that again. The
[43:13] word of
[43:15] God has power to change anything.
[43:21] Praise God. Amen. A a as you as you sit
[43:25] and you listen to the word of God, you
[43:26] don't realize you are being transformed
[43:28] from glory to glory every time you hear
[43:31] the word of God. Amen. It's the word of
[43:34] God that produce the sun that you
[43:36] experience and get all your vitamins
[43:39] from. Right. It's the word of God that
[43:41] produced the moon and stops the ocean
[43:43] from coming too far into the land. It's
[43:45] the word of God that does these things.
[43:48] It's the word of God that said, "Let
[43:50] there be light." And the Bible says
[43:52] there was
[43:54] Amen. It's the word of God that does
[43:56] that. The word of God has transforming
[43:59] power. And if we just allow God to do
[44:02] what he does, Amen. He won't fail. Amen.
[44:06] He won't fail. Let me uh go to Amazing
[44:09] Grace. Amen. And let's stand to our feet
[44:12] and let's welcome um God's servant to
[44:16] the uh pullpit uh brother George Smith.
[44:20] Amen. We thank God for him as he comes
[44:24] in his own special way. Amen. May you
[44:26] draw from the gift that God has given to
[44:28] us on this day.
[44:32] Amen. A
[44:34] rich like like
[44:40] me.
[44:41] Oh, I
[44:46] once was lost.
[44:50] Oh,
[44:52] now
[44:55] I
[44:58] wo was
[45:01] blind but
[45:03] now
[45:05] I
[45:09] see. Praise God. Oh, praise
[45:15] God. Praise God.
[45:19] [Music]
[45:26] [Music]
[45:31] Praise
[45:33] God. Praise
[45:40] God. Praise
[45:43] God. Praise God.
[45:48] Praise
[45:51] God. Praise
[45:55] God. Praise
[45:58] God. Praise
[46:02] God. Praise
[46:08] God. Amen.
[46:15] Good to be in Florida again.
[46:20] I think it was two years ago. Amen. But
[46:23] you know, I'm here for three
[46:25] reasons. One, pastor invited. When I see
[46:28] him or when I talk to him, when you
[46:30] coming by and number two, the spirit
[46:33] moved and here we are. Amen. But number
[46:36] three reason might be even greater. Um
[46:40] there's a friend of mine out west that
[46:43] uh doesn't speak much English. He's
[46:45] Spanish speaking, but the Lord deals
[46:47] with him in
[46:48] dreams. And so he called me one day and
[46:51] he said, "I had this dream." Yeah. He
[46:54] said, "Uh, I was like a fly on the wall
[46:57] and I could see brother Brandham's
[46:59] living room." Okay.
[47:01] And so in the living room he said you
[47:03] and Rebecca was over here sitting down
[47:06] and over here was sister Brandham and
[47:08] brother Neville in the chair you know
[47:10] they were talking and
[47:13] so that that was the scene. So directly
[47:16] brother Neville gets up to leave. Well
[47:18] the Lord called him in March of
[47:21] 1974. So he's over by the door and then
[47:25] Sister Ran comes to see him out and the
[47:27] Lord called her in May of
[47:30] 81. So they're over there and then they
[47:33] said, "Reco, come over here." So she
[47:35] goes over there. Lord took her in
[47:38] November of ' 06, almost 19 years ago.
[47:41] So they're in this other dimension. Yes.
[47:44] They look back at me and they said, "You
[47:47] keep doing what you're doing.
[47:50] So got to keep going.
[47:53] Hallelujah. Amen. Glory. Let's pray.
[47:56] Heavenly Father, we thank you for your
[47:58] mercy. We thank you for all you've done
[47:59] for us. You brought us here in our right
[48:01] mind. And Lord, you've given us
[48:03] blessings. And now we pray that you
[48:05] would send your spirit amongst us to
[48:07] interpret the word to us. Hallelujah. We
[48:09] love you. We thank you for every every
[48:12] blessing. Bless your people today, not
[48:14] only here, but in the other places where
[48:16] they're gathered, that your servants may
[48:18] be inspired to speak the truth. help us
[48:21] now in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. You may
[48:24] be seated.
[48:25] [Music]
[48:28] Today we're going to speak out of
[48:31] brother Brandham's absolute. All right.
[48:33] The
[48:34] scripture and uh today's Sunday. We're
[48:37] going to have Sunday school. All right,
[48:38] brother. So get your pencil and paper
[48:40] ready. And who knows what's going to
[48:42] happen, but it'll be the truth. Amen.
[48:46] So, we're going to go we're going to
[48:47] dive into it says here acts of the
[48:50] apostles, but it's actually acts of the
[48:53] Holy Spirit in the lives of really
[48:55] believers, you know, and uh we're just
[48:58] going to go through this carefully and
[49:00] point out a few things. You know, other
[49:02] people, not only right here in Florida,
[49:05] but everywhere they they they have our
[49:06] same Bible. It's not another Bible. It's
[49:09] same Bible. And they just kind of look
[49:11] superficially. But God has given us the
[49:13] spirit of God to look into revelation
[49:16] and look between the lines. That's
[49:17] right. And what we find between the
[49:20] lines has to be in perfect harmony with
[49:22] with what's on the line. Amen. So it's
[49:25] fundamental teaching, but we must know
[49:28] what the word says. Yes, sir. Now, the
[49:30] writer is brother Luke. He was a doctor.
[49:32] You'll find that in Colossians 4:14. He
[49:35] was a doctor, high level Greek citizen,
[49:37] and he was a good writer. because the
[49:40] book of Luke and the book of Acts are
[49:42] the longest books in the New Testament.
[49:44] So he accompanied Paul on his missionary
[49:47] journeys and he did a lot of the writing
[49:49] while Paul spoke. Okay. He might have
[49:52] written actually pinned most of the New
[49:55] Testament. Now why is this important to
[49:58] us here at the edge of time? We're about
[50:00] ready to take off. Well, I hope so. But
[50:02] you know, brother Rand also taught us
[50:03] that in every congregation's three kinds
[50:05] of believers.
[50:06] And now don't be pointing finger. Worry
[50:09] about who you are, right?
[50:12] Very easy. Oh, well, we know where she
[50:14] is. No, who are you? All right.
[50:17] And um so the world's falling apart. But
[50:20] you know what? The resurrection is very
[50:22] imminent. Amen. Amen. Prophet says
[50:24] resurrection is the cornerstone of our
[50:26] entire message. Amen. Amen. It's the
[50:29] cardinal resting place of the gospel. No
[50:32] matter what he did, if he did not raise
[50:34] again from the dead, then all of it's in
[50:36] vain. It proves to me that he was God.
[50:40] So, I don't have time to listen to
[50:41] people that are going to try to argue
[50:42] that Jesus wasn't God. It's a waste of
[50:45] time. We're not going to go there.
[50:47] That's right. He was God. And I think
[50:49] it's a great coronation to the full
[50:51] gospel is the resurrection. It's divine
[50:52] promises. So, to my opinion, the prophet
[50:55] says the resurrection is the greatest of
[50:57] all the promises of the things of the
[50:59] scripture. Amen. Yes, sir. So, we're
[51:01] thankful that we have a living word and
[51:05] we're not guessing. We know what we're
[51:07] we're speaking about. And u you know,
[51:10] we're we have the only man in history
[51:12] that I know of that went beyond the
[51:14] curtain of time and came back and told
[51:16] us what it was all about. And it was so
[51:18] wonderful you couldn't even describe it,
[51:20] you know. But um we are a part of God's
[51:23] plan. Amen. And no one is going in the
[51:27] rapture without the baptism of the Holy
[51:29] Ghost. Amen. It is fundamental. You must
[51:31] have it. You see the divine love
[51:33] reflecting in your daily life. That's
[51:36] why we come to church to see what's
[51:37] missing. You see, and to get ready and
[51:42] uh balance is very important. So, we
[51:44] must have balance in the scripture. Now,
[51:46] we don't have any place to hook this
[51:48] onto. Is this metal here?
[51:51] It's all wood and plastic. Well,
[51:54] anyway, balance is vital. Yes. Amen.
[51:58] You're not going without balance. Amen.
[52:01] So,
[52:03] so now this brother Luke, he became
[52:06] um a disciple. That's a follower. He was
[52:09] never an apostle. A disciple is a
[52:12] follower. While Jesus was here, he had
[52:14] 12 disciples. 12 followers. One was the
[52:17] devil. And Jesus knew who he was right
[52:18] from the beginning. That wasn't a slip
[52:20] up, you know. An apostle is one that
[52:22] sent out. It's a missionary, right? Uh
[52:25] Luke accompanied Paul the great
[52:27] missionary and the original disciples
[52:29] were mostly fishermen. They were just
[52:31] common people, you know. Um many
[52:34] couldn't even sign their name. Now we
[52:37] look at it today with our great, you
[52:39] know, understanding. Everybody's got a
[52:40] nice car, a nice suit. Is that the best
[52:43] you could find? No. That's the ones that
[52:46] were ordained, you know. Amen.
[52:48] So, these were just all ordinary men
[52:51] that God used in extraordinary ways to
[52:54] spread the gospel. They're the ones that
[52:56] could do the job, you know, because they
[52:58] were yielded and uh they were they went
[53:01] out after they were endued with power in
[53:03] chapter 2 that we'll get to in a little
[53:04] bit. But, uh they were God's choice. It
[53:07] all worked out, you know, just like with
[53:10] this crowd here. God God knows who
[53:12] should be here today. Amen. This gospel
[53:16] isn't for everybody in Florida. It's
[53:17] only for a few. That's right. Amen.
[53:20] That's right. Amen. So God knows who you
[53:22] are. He knows how to provide what you
[53:24] need. And um so after they were filled
[53:28] with power, Christ in spirit form, he
[53:31] showed them how to apply their faith.
[53:33] You see, and God is still in business
[53:35] today. Yes, sir. Changing lives, filling
[53:38] believers, anointing you to live in dark
[53:41] leadya. Amen.
[53:44] So this letter, the Acts, was originally
[53:48] just a letter that that uh Luke wrote to
[53:51] his pagan friend Theophilus, a very
[53:53] wealthy Greek man in order to show him
[53:56] the complete narrative of Jesus life,
[53:59] his works, his teaching, and thereby
[54:01] prove that Christianity is the only true
[54:04] religion. The rest of it is fake. This
[54:06] is the only true religion. Praise God.
[54:09] So he he he gave the narrative in in
[54:11] Luke. And now here's the other part. So
[54:14] the Gospel of Luke and Acts, they form a
[54:17] two volume set and they're both written
[54:20] about 30 years after the
[54:21] resurrection. Okay. Another point, the
[54:24] Holy Spirit is referred to more than 50
[54:26] times in this one book as the Holy
[54:29] Ghost, the spirit in relation to baptism
[54:32] with the Holy Spirit, being filled with
[54:33] the Holy Spirit, and being led by the
[54:35] Holy Spirit. Okay? And uh that's the
[54:38] message that carries over to our day.
[54:40] You see, must have the Holy Spirit or
[54:43] you will stay behind. Guaranteed. We can
[54:47] guarantee that. Yes, sir. Now, we don't
[54:49] we can't guarantee who all's bride. But
[54:51] if you don't have the Holy Ghost, you
[54:52] will be sitting in this church the day
[54:54] after the resurrection.
[54:56] Okay? So, there's no shortcuts, no
[54:58] respective persons, no matter what your
[55:00] name is, who your grandpa was. No, only
[55:03] one way to God. That's right. I don't
[55:06] know if you ever remember the old way
[55:07] back there was a man named uh Bishop
[55:09] Johnson up in Philadelphia. Yes, sir.
[55:12] And he had a theme song, one way, one
[55:14] way to God. Baptized in Jesus name.
[55:18] Okay. So Luke, where we at here? Acts 1
[55:21] verse one. The former treaties have I
[55:24] made, O Theophilles, is a good friend of
[55:26] his, of all that Jesus began both to do
[55:28] and to teach. Until the day in which he
[55:31] was taken up, after that he through the
[55:34] Holy Ghost had given commandments unto
[55:35] the apostles whom he had chosen, to whom
[55:38] also he showed himself alive after his
[55:41] passion by many infallible proofs, uh
[55:45] being seen of them 40 days, and speaking
[55:48] of the things pertaining to the kingdom.
[55:51] Now, this is the only mention in
[55:52] scripture of the time
[55:55] frame after the resurrection to the
[55:59] ascension says 40 days. That's a month
[56:01] or so. Okay? It might have been 39 days,
[56:04] might have been 29 days, but it was
[56:06] about a month. So, very similar to our
[56:09] time, Brother Ram says over here in
[56:13] uh letting off the pressure in Green
[56:15] Lake, Wisconsin,
[56:16] 1962. Um can't you see we are at the end
[56:20] time? It's all over. Now, this is a long
[56:22] time ago, but see, God's clock is
[56:24] different from ours. It's all over. The
[56:27] next thing will be a sweep that will get
[56:29] that little group together. Wow. Okay.
[56:32] In a month or so, she will be gone. As
[56:35] soon as she is gathered together. Well,
[56:37] we are at the end. There's no hopes left
[56:39] anywhere. Run to Jeffersonville. No. Run
[56:43] to Christ, people. Run to Christ.
[56:48] Amen. And so in another place he
[56:51] mentions says we're not getting people
[56:53] to Christ. We're getting them to an
[56:54] idea. We got to bring people to Christ
[56:57] to the word. You see, and just in
[57:01] passing here, you know, we we have the
[57:03] new pope. Okay. We've been waiting for
[57:04] many years for one to come from America.
[57:06] Yes, sir. God knew who he knew the time
[57:09] and everything. So in that paragraph, if
[57:12] you studied it, there's three parts to
[57:14] that. Yes, sir. One is the election of
[57:16] the pope. Okay. That's their business.
[57:18] They they did that. But he says in that
[57:20] in that same paragraph that that will in
[57:23] so many words open the door for this
[57:25] right here to sweep together. Bring that
[57:27] little group together.
[57:30] See the the real believers are going to
[57:31] come together. Like it or not, it's
[57:34] going to happen. That's right. And the
[57:35] ones that don't like it are going to
[57:36] start saying crazy things and they're
[57:38] going to drop off. Because only the
[57:41] bride's going up.
[57:43] So we don't know what he did or what he
[57:45] said in those 40 days. It says you're
[57:47] speaking of the things pertaining to the
[57:49] kingdom. Well, obviously, what else is
[57:51] he going to talk about? Right? He wasn't
[57:52] traveling village to village. He already
[57:54] did that. You see? So, let's not waste
[57:57] our time and energy wandering into the
[57:59] desert of speculation. Just leave it
[58:01] alone. God will reveal according to your
[58:04] need.
[58:06] Yes, sir. You see, we don't have to
[58:08] worry how to park the car. We got free
[58:10] parking out here. We don't have to worry
[58:12] about a lot of things. Just concentrate
[58:15] on getting ready. Okay. Verse four. And
[58:18] we're going to go slow so that you can
[58:20] understand it. But we're not going to
[58:21] read every verse. That'll be your job to
[58:24] read carefully every verse at home.
[58:26] Amen. You remember when I was here last
[58:28] time, I gave you four steps how to get
[58:29] close to God. Okay. Well, it's still
[58:31] true. Verse
[58:34] four. After being assembled together
[58:37] with them, he commanded them that they
[58:39] should not depart from Jerusalem, but
[58:42] wait for the promise of the father,
[58:43] which saith he, you have heard of me.
[58:48] Where did where did they hear that? John
[58:51] 14:15-18 and verse 26. And then he
[58:54] further expounds on the promise in verse
[58:56] 5. For John truly baptized with water,
[59:00] but ye shall be baptized with the Holy
[59:02] Ghost, not many days hence. Verse six,
[59:05] when they therefore were come
[59:07] together, they asked him, saying, Lord,
[59:10] will you at this time restore again the
[59:12] kingdom to
[59:13] Israel, well, after experiencing these
[59:16] infallible proofs and having close
[59:19] fellowship with a resurrected being that
[59:22] only Lazarus had been the one to come
[59:23] back, you know, but here's a resurrected
[59:25] being. and they're having fellowship and
[59:27] um having meals together. They were kind
[59:30] of like us. They had a political
[59:33] question. Who's going to be president?
[59:35] Who's going to be pope? Who cares? We're
[59:38] on the way out.
[59:40] That's it. And neither Mr. Trump or
[59:43] anybody else is going to take it back
[59:45] the way it used to be, right? We're
[59:47] going forward.
[59:49] Who wants to go back? We're going
[59:51] forward. You know, that's right. So, you
[59:54] know, they said, "Well, Lord, this is
[59:55] all wonderful. Um, but um and you know,
[59:58] we we love you, but now are you going to
[1:00:01] get the Romans off our back?" You know,
[1:00:03] that was their greatest thing they could
[1:00:06] think of. They were humans like us. In
[1:00:08] verse 7, uh, have you ever heard of Dr.
[1:00:11] Lamza? Okay. George Lamza was a good
[1:00:14] friend of brother Brandham. He was from
[1:00:16] Middle East over there in the Middle
[1:00:18] East. That was his where he was born.
[1:00:20] But he was a scholar and he made a
[1:00:22] translation of the Bible directly from
[1:00:24] the original text. And so he says over
[1:00:27] here in verse 7, "It is not for you to
[1:00:31] know the time or times what the father
[1:00:33] hath put in his own authority."
[1:00:36] Okay, in Florida language, that means
[1:00:38] it's none of your
[1:00:40] business. Right?
[1:00:42] These people should have understood by
[1:00:44] now that rebellion against Rome was not
[1:00:47] the proper Christian attitude. But
[1:00:49] rather faithfulness to the message of
[1:00:51] the hour and to the lifestyle of the
[1:00:54] gospel just imitating the master. Yes
[1:00:57] sir. We had a man today in our time that
[1:01:01] lived such a life some people thought
[1:01:03] that was Jesus Christ. Yes sir. Okay.
[1:01:05] Just just imitate that until it's real
[1:01:07] in your own life. You know,
[1:01:10] in Revelation chapter 4, the prophet
[1:01:11] says, and I know you've heard some of
[1:01:13] this, but we're going to read the whole
[1:01:14] paragraph because our friends didn't
[1:01:15] read the whole paragraph. Yes. Oh, how
[1:01:18] we need in Jeffersonville, thousands of
[1:01:20] lived voices.
[1:01:23] What's that mean? The thunder of God
[1:01:25] thundering out in sweetness, holiness,
[1:01:28] purity, undefiled lives, right? Walking
[1:01:31] around in the earth today without a
[1:01:32] blemish. Right. That's what we need.
[1:01:34] Without a blemish. Right. Yes. Amen.
[1:01:36] Real Christians. That's the thunder
[1:01:39] against the enemy. The devil doesn't
[1:01:40] care how loud you holler or how high you
[1:01:43] can jump or what you can do this or
[1:01:45] shout, whatever. But what hurts the
[1:01:47] devil, that's our business. Hurt the
[1:01:50] devil. Is to see that sanctified holy
[1:01:53] life, consecrated to God, say anything
[1:01:56] to him, call him anything, and he's just
[1:01:59] as sweet as he can be. Moves right on.
[1:02:01] That throws him away. That's the thunder
[1:02:03] that shakes the devil. Amen. Not
[1:02:06] something else that you imagine. Right
[1:02:07] here. So don't come around me. We got to
[1:02:10] say what he said. I know what he said.
[1:02:12] Amen.
[1:02:14] I've been I've been, you know, working
[1:02:17] with his words for 50 years. Amen. So
[1:02:20] verse eight, another promise. And you
[1:02:23] shall receive power after that the Holy
[1:02:25] Ghost has come upon you. And you shall
[1:02:27] be uh witnesses unto me, okay, of the
[1:02:31] truth both right here in Jerusalem.
[1:02:35] uh over in
[1:02:36] Judea, over in Samaria, and to the other
[1:02:39] most part of the earth. Amen. Somebody
[1:02:42] had to bring the gospel to Florida. Yes,
[1:02:44] sir. Didn't come in a parachute. Right.
[1:02:46] Oh, that's right. That's right. And from
[1:02:49] what we can understand, they probably
[1:02:51] spoke Spanish. All right. Yes, sir.
[1:02:53] Those original people came over here.
[1:02:55] That's exactly right. Okay. So, uh in in
[1:02:58] verse n, he took off, vanished into a
[1:03:01] cloud. Okay. And they some of them went
[1:03:04] and did what he said. Now you're
[1:03:07] probably some of you are not quite tuned
[1:03:09] in yet. Well, this is quite shallow.
[1:03:11] Yeah, ABC is quite
[1:03:15] shallow. We don't have French toast
[1:03:17] every day. Sometimes we have oatmeal.
[1:03:18] All right, brother. Sometimes we have
[1:03:20] piece of toast with just a little bit of
[1:03:22] butter. You know, we got to get back to
[1:03:24] the basics.
[1:03:26] But people say, "Oh, we're bride
[1:03:27] material. We want to hear the deep
[1:03:29] things." And what have we done with the
[1:03:31] deep things? argue and no, you're not
[1:03:34] right. No, that's not the way it works.
[1:03:36] No. So, be careful how we judge. Amen.
[1:03:40] Amen. We have an entire library of
[1:03:43] prophetic uh recordings where you can
[1:03:45] hear all the mysteries. That's right.
[1:03:48] Doctrine, Revelation, and guess what?
[1:03:50] It's on every cell phone on the planet.
[1:03:53] Amen. And English, Spanish, and
[1:03:55] whatever. Right. So, God knows what he's
[1:03:58] doing. Amen. You see? Amen.
[1:04:01] So, uh, I'm just here to point the way
[1:04:04] and encourage you to stay with God's
[1:04:06] program and stay balanced. That's
[1:04:08] exactly right. Now, the pastor and I
[1:04:11] went last night, had some a real good
[1:04:13] fish supper. Now, we can't have that
[1:04:16] every day. We got to have a balance.
[1:04:19] Amen.
[1:04:23] I was with a brother the other night. He
[1:04:24] ordered He ordered steak and uh ribs and
[1:04:29] mashed potatoes and French fries. That's
[1:04:32] not
[1:04:36] balanced. We got to stay balanced.
[1:04:39] Okay. So, where we at here? So, um see
[1:04:42] what you got to understand. We are a
[1:04:45] church full of Christians in progress.
[1:04:47] Not everybody had the same good coffee
[1:04:49] that you had. Not everybody came the
[1:04:52] same color car, you know. Amen. So, we
[1:04:54] got to review from time to time, check
[1:04:56] the foundation, be sure everything's
[1:04:58] okay. And um you know, not everyone came
[1:05:02] uh wide awake. Some people are going to
[1:05:04] go to sleep. I'm watching
[1:05:08] you. So, you're only seeing one person.
[1:05:10] I'm seeing all the happy faces.
[1:05:16] But you know, 1 John 3:11 says, "This is
[1:05:19] the message that you heard from the
[1:05:20] beginning that we should love one
[1:05:22] another." Amen. And so, we don't want
[1:05:25] to, um, push anybody aside. Love
[1:05:28] everybody.
[1:05:30] You're not, you can't waste your love.
[1:05:32] Amen. And so,
[1:05:34] um, we can try that in the natural
[1:05:37] flesh, but when it's spiritled, it's
[1:05:39] automatic. When you have the baptism of
[1:05:41] the Holy Ghost and spirit of the the
[1:05:44] Holy Ghost is not optional. It's not if
[1:05:45] you feel like it. It's not when you get
[1:05:47] to 20 or 21 or 49. No, it's essential.
[1:05:51] Amen. Okay. If you want to be with us at
[1:05:53] the meeting in the air. Amen. Okay. In
[1:05:56] verse 10, two angels appeared right
[1:05:58] there in your Bible. In verse 11, they
[1:06:00] said, "This same Jesus which is taken
[1:06:02] from you into heaven shall so come in
[1:06:04] like manner as you have seen him go into
[1:06:06] heaven." And from that verse, we have
[1:06:10] the private interpretation that the
[1:06:12] cloud of 1963 was the fulfillment of the
[1:06:15] word of the two angels. Brother Rem
[1:06:17] didn't teach that. That was a sign for
[1:06:19] him, right? Okay. And we can give you a
[1:06:22] whole 30 minutes on the truth of the
[1:06:24] matter. But um uh let's stay with what
[1:06:27] we know, not what could be, it might
[1:06:29] have been. And so and so said, let's
[1:06:31] stick with the truth. Okay. Okay. In
[1:06:33] verses 12- 15, they got together in the
[1:06:35] upper room. There was Mary, the mother
[1:06:38] of his earthly family was there,
[1:06:40] saintly, obedient, walking in the truth
[1:06:42] of the hour. She didn't have special
[1:06:44] clothes on. Everybody bow. No, that's
[1:06:46] not the way it worked. She was one of
[1:06:48] the believers, you know. She wasn't
[1:06:50] arrogant. She wasn't selfish. She wasn't
[1:06:52] demanding. She was just an obedient
[1:06:55] lamb. Amen.
[1:06:57] And in uh let's see here um in 1
[1:07:02] Corinthians 15:6 it says he was seen of
[1:07:04] 500 brethren at once. Now I wasn't there
[1:07:07] and neither was you. Your grandpa wasn't
[1:07:09] there. But it's commonly thought that
[1:07:12] those 500 are the ones that was out
[1:07:14] there on the Mount of Olives and saw him
[1:07:16] ascend.
[1:07:17] Okay? Whether it's true or not. But
[1:07:19] guess what? Only 120 made it to the
[1:07:21] upper room. You see? Where's the rest of
[1:07:24] them? Because that's only 24%. Wow. So
[1:07:28] the others, maybe they didn't take it
[1:07:30] serious. Maybe they Well, who wants to
[1:07:32] go down and sit with those crazy people?
[1:07:34] I'm going to go to the beach today. Oh,
[1:07:36] yeah. And on TV. I mean, we got all
[1:07:39] kinds of reasons not to come to church.
[1:07:42] Wow. But um 76% of the crowd didn't make
[1:07:46] it to the upper room. Now, me and
[1:07:48] Brother Jack, we've been to the upper
[1:07:50] room. It's It's not this big. It's a
[1:07:52] small place. Right? See, God already
[1:07:54] knew that. 500 people wouldn't fit there
[1:07:56] anyway.
[1:07:59] So 12, sorry, 15-2, they discussed the
[1:08:03] facts of the death of Judas, the
[1:08:06] traitor. And here's where they were
[1:08:08] quoting from Psalm 41:9 and
[1:08:10] 69:25, written by David, regarding the
[1:08:13] fact that uh where this man died, no one
[1:08:18] shall live there. Now, that's clear back
[1:08:20] in the Old Testament.
[1:08:22] There's all kinds of references to Jesus
[1:08:24] Christ and his life in the Old
[1:08:26] Testament. That's the only Bible they
[1:08:27] had. They had no New Testament. It
[1:08:28] wasn't written yet. That's right. That's
[1:08:30] right. And so to this very day, there's
[1:08:32] a place there in Jerusalem called
[1:08:35] Akalama, which is field of blood. It's a
[1:08:38] hillside. It's rocks. That's right. Now,
[1:08:40] real estate in Jerusalem is very, very
[1:08:43] expensive. You can't even imagine. Yeah.
[1:08:47] Better than Florida. Yeah. And so, um,
[1:08:51] this piece of ground, nobody lives there
[1:08:53] because scripture said so. That's
[1:08:55] exactly. You know, God's word is always
[1:08:57] true. Amen. And so, the rest of the
[1:09:00] chapter has to do with the replacement
[1:09:01] that they chose, brother Matias. But
[1:09:04] this is the first and last mention of
[1:09:06] him. And um, these people were all
[1:09:09] humans just like us. Okay? Uh, just like
[1:09:12] brother Brandham. The more you yield
[1:09:15] yourself to God, the more he can use
[1:09:17] you. Amen. If you only give him 10%,
[1:09:19] well then he's going to use 10%.
[1:09:22] And we're not talking about money. We're
[1:09:23] talking about time and you're you're
[1:09:25] yielding.
[1:09:26] So, uh, this is the only book in the
[1:09:29] Bible that's not finished yet.
[1:09:31] Everything else comes to to a finish.
[1:09:33] The book of Acts is not finished. It's
[1:09:35] being written today. Your life is being
[1:09:38] written as part of the book of Acts now.
[1:09:41] So, God is still in business. And um
[1:09:44] just like in the book of Acts, we're
[1:09:46] living in the continuation of the same
[1:09:49] spirit of God manifested through
[1:09:51] ordinary people completely yielded to
[1:09:54] Jesus Christ. Amen. And so we'll move
[1:09:57] right along here.
[1:09:59] Um and over here in um chapter two, you
[1:10:04] see the Bible is the greatest book we
[1:10:07] have. Amen. I know it's hard to believe
[1:10:09] that, but you know, it's it's the book
[1:10:12] that is going to it gives us the
[1:10:14] revelation of Jesus Christ, you know,
[1:10:17] and in our world, there's over 7,000
[1:10:20] known languages, but the Bible is
[1:10:22] available in 750 languages because some
[1:10:25] people have taken the the the time to to
[1:10:29] put it into that language. Some of these
[1:10:31] languages still today are only spoken.
[1:10:34] There's languages, groups of people have
[1:10:36] nothing in writing. Wow. Mhm. So, you
[1:10:39] got to go over there, got to learn what,
[1:10:42] you know, what is this, what's that, and
[1:10:44] form a dictionary. Wow. Translate, you
[1:10:48] know, make a dictionary and translate
[1:10:50] John. And you got to teach the people to
[1:10:52] read because they haven't they don't
[1:10:53] know anything.
[1:10:55] It's we got it made here.
[1:10:58] But the scripture says in John 8:32,
[1:11:01] "You shall know the truth, and the truth
[1:11:03] shall make you free." So, you have a
[1:11:05] choice. You can know the truth. Now,
[1:11:08] what you know is because what you've
[1:11:10] experienced, what you've read. That's
[1:11:11] how you know
[1:11:13] something. So, you can know the truth or
[1:11:15] you can keep going in your little circle
[1:11:18] round and round and stay in prison or
[1:11:21] you can come out and know the truth. So,
[1:11:23] you have a choice. Uh Romans 8:28, "And
[1:11:26] we know that all things work together
[1:11:29] for good for those who love God and
[1:11:31] called according to his purpose." Yes.
[1:11:33] Okay. So in um chapter 2 we have a very
[1:11:40] interesting situation where that
[1:11:43] these 120 are hiding up here in this
[1:11:46] upper room from all these crazy people
[1:11:49] you know religious Jews. So here we are
[1:11:52] in day 10 120ear in prayer seeking the
[1:11:56] fulfillment of Acts 18. And there was a
[1:11:59] noise from heaven. It wasn't because a
[1:12:01] truck was going by or some. No, it's a
[1:12:03] noise from heaven came down. Amen.
[1:12:05] Filled the house and tongues of fire
[1:12:08] appeared on each one of them
[1:12:11] and each one was filled with the Holy
[1:12:12] Ghost. They knew that they had arrived,
[1:12:16] you know. So, the church of Jesus Christ
[1:12:18] was launched at Jerusalem. That was the
[1:12:21] alpha church, the beginning. Okay. We're
[1:12:24] over here at the Omega church, right?
[1:12:26] Huh? through seven years, seven ages,
[1:12:29] 2,000 years, we're now restored back to
[1:12:31] the original by a prophetic message
[1:12:33] straight from God according to Malachi
[1:12:35] 4.
[1:12:37] And if you don't Malachi, if you don't
[1:12:38] like Malachi 4, because it's the Old
[1:12:39] Testament, fine. Go over look in your
[1:12:41] Bible in Matthew 17. Jesus
[1:12:44] himself. Oh, you'd be surprised. Oh,
[1:12:47] that's that's over there for those guys.
[1:12:50] Fine. But Jesus said, "Elijah shall
[1:12:53] truly first come and restore all
[1:12:55] things." And when he said that, do you
[1:12:58] think he knew what he was talking about?
[1:13:00] Do you think he might know? Let's see.
[1:13:01] What's that? WB. Oh, William Brandon. He
[1:13:04] knew all that. Yes, sir. But brother
[1:13:06] Brandham said, "I'm glad my B my name's
[1:13:09] not in the Bible cuz somebody else could
[1:13:10] come along and that would be them and I
[1:13:12] would be left out." Wow. So, wow.
[1:13:15] Anyway, so it says here from every
[1:13:17] nation verse 5, but let me just insert
[1:13:20] something here that brother Bram says in
[1:13:22] 1960 a prayer he's praying in
[1:13:25] discernment of spirit. Very interesting
[1:13:26] tape you should listen to
[1:13:29] 60-0308. In the prayer he says, "And
[1:13:31] we're here this morning, Father,
[1:13:33] gathered for no other purpose but to
[1:13:35] know and to study to know rather the
[1:13:37] will of God and what we must do to make
[1:13:40] Christ real to the people of this
[1:13:42] generation."
[1:13:43] That's the minister's job to make Christ
[1:13:46] real to the congregation.
[1:13:48] He says, "Knowing surely that in the day
[1:13:51] of the judgment, we will be brought face
[1:13:53] to face with this generation. And being
[1:13:56] ministers, we will be judges and those
[1:13:59] people to which we have spoken to and
[1:14:02] their attitude towards the word that we
[1:14:03] bring them will determine their eternal
[1:14:06] destination." It gets serious pretty
[1:14:08] quick. Therefore, Lord, in that day we
[1:14:10] would be a judge for against the
[1:14:12] generation that we preached to. Okay.
[1:14:14] So, here we are in the day of Pentecost.
[1:14:17] And um verse 5 says that there was
[1:14:19] people from every nation. Huh? Have you
[1:14:22] ever thought of that? Well, you see,
[1:14:24] God's timing is perfect. He has you here
[1:14:27] and not in South Carolina or wherever.
[1:14:30] No, you're here. Right. And
[1:14:33] so, um he's always on time. These people
[1:14:37] were gathered in Jerusalem for the feast
[1:14:40] of
[1:14:41] Pentecost. Because you see in scripture
[1:14:44] in Leviticus 23, God dealing with his
[1:14:47] chosen people, he instituted seven
[1:14:49] occasions throughout the calendar
[1:14:51] year. And on three of these occasions,
[1:14:55] all the men, all the male believers must
[1:14:58] come to the temple. That's in Exodus
[1:15:01] 23:14-19. And this would today this very
[1:15:05] time going on in Jerusalem was the feast
[1:15:08] of harvest or feast of Pentecost. A
[1:15:10] celebration of six days. Amen. Okay. So
[1:15:13] they're all here. Now these people got
[1:15:15] to sleep someplace. They got to eat
[1:15:17] someplace. And at that time Jerusalem
[1:15:20] was still just a walled city. 1
[1:15:23] kilometer 1 kilometer square.
[1:15:26] And so um that's exactly how these
[1:15:30] people were gathered. And it's exactly
[1:15:32] during this week that the spirit
[1:15:33] descended on the 120. So you got the six
[1:15:36] day feast down here and you got the the
[1:15:39] 120 up here with on the 10th day which
[1:15:42] fell within the six days. Uh-huh. God
[1:15:45] knows how to do this kind of stuff. And
[1:15:47] permitted them to speak in languages
[1:15:49] that all these people could understand.
[1:15:51] Wow. You see verses six and eight. Hey,
[1:15:55] aren't these guys from Galilee? You
[1:15:56] know, they're hicks. They're unlearned.
[1:15:58] You know, like the people from North
[1:15:59] Carolina, how they talk, you know, they
[1:16:01] talk a little different. Or up there
[1:16:03] where I live in the hills, bunch of
[1:16:05] rednecks up there in Tennessee. What are
[1:16:07] you saying? Virginia is even worse.
[1:16:10] There's people in Virginia I can't
[1:16:12] understand. Yes, sir. You know, so so
[1:16:16] they're understanding them in their
[1:16:18] language, but they got that Galilee
[1:16:20] accent. Yeah. You know, only God can do
[1:16:23] that. And so while they're while they're
[1:16:26] wondering, while Peter had their
[1:16:28] attention, verse 14 of Acts chapter 2,
[1:16:32] it says here, where we at? Um, but Peter
[1:16:35] standing up with the 11 lifted up his
[1:16:37] voice and said unto them, you men of
[1:16:40] Judea and all that dwell in
[1:16:43] Jerusalem, be this known unto you and
[1:16:47] hearken unto my words. Now friends, he's
[1:16:50] talking to thousands of people. No
[1:16:52] microphone. How' they do that?
[1:16:56] They must have been quiet for one thing.
[1:17:00] And so he preaches his first sermon.
[1:17:03] Maybe it's 30 minutes. We don't know.
[1:17:05] But he ends over here in verse 36 of
[1:17:07] chapter 2. And he says over here,
[1:17:10] "Therefore, let all the house of Israel
[1:17:13] know assuredly that God hath made that
[1:17:17] same Jesus whom you guys crucified. He
[1:17:20] made him both Lord and Christ. And he
[1:17:23] never did. Every time he spoke, he put
[1:17:24] that in there. You guys crucified him,
[1:17:26] you know. And um and so here he is. He
[1:17:31] was led entirely by the Holy Ghost. He
[1:17:33] did not beat them into submission. He
[1:17:35] simply was faithful to the truth. Amen.
[1:17:38] Did not call for immediate response. But
[1:17:40] in verse
[1:17:42] 37, and when they heard this, they were
[1:17:44] pricricked in their heart. In other
[1:17:45] words, something happened. And they said
[1:17:48] to Peter and the rest of the apostles,
[1:17:50] "Men and brethren, what shall we do?" In
[1:17:52] other words, we'd like to we'd like some
[1:17:54] of this. What's the first step to take?
[1:17:56] You know, and he gave him the eternal
[1:17:59] prescription. Repent and be baptized,
[1:18:02] every one of you, in the name of Jesus
[1:18:04] Christ for the remission of sins, and
[1:18:06] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:18:08] Ghost.
[1:18:09] For the promise is unto you standing
[1:18:12] here, and to your children, and to them
[1:18:15] that are far off, even as the many as
[1:18:17] our Lord our God shall call." Now, I had
[1:18:19] a text there this past week from a man
[1:18:22] over in where was he from? Somewhere in
[1:18:25] in South America, and he wanted to know,
[1:18:27] now this uh this part here where it says
[1:18:30] uh far off. Now, is that is that
[1:18:34] distance
[1:18:35] or you got to be pretty dense, you know,
[1:18:37] not to catch that? Yeah, he's speaking
[1:18:39] it over there, but it's it's happening
[1:18:41] today. It's time and people.
[1:18:46] So, this prescription that he gives here
[1:18:49] does in no wise subtract or contradict
[1:18:51] the commission a few days earlier uh
[1:18:54] where Jesus said over in Matthew 28:19,
[1:18:58] baptizing them in the name of the father
[1:19:00] and of the son and of the holy ghost.
[1:19:01] You know, it's rather the fulfillment,
[1:19:03] the manifestation, the revelation of the
[1:19:07] spoken word. Amen. But we have an entire
[1:19:09] world following the trinity idea without
[1:19:13] any revelation.
[1:19:15] So the very church that Peter founded
[1:19:18] according to them, they can't repeat his
[1:19:21] words.
[1:19:23] They got a problem. You know, uh
[1:19:27] sometimes I think I'd like to have an
[1:19:29] argument with the man in Rome. Okay,
[1:19:31] you're you're wearing the sandals of the
[1:19:32] fisherman. I don't claim that, but you
[1:19:34] claim you're wearing sandals of the
[1:19:36] fisherman. Why can't you say what he
[1:19:38] said?
[1:19:40] I mean, it would be a good argument, you
[1:19:43] know, but um verse 41, this yielded
[1:19:47] small yielded band of believers, 120,
[1:19:51] they're out here, and we only have
[1:19:53] Peter's words. I guess the others might
[1:19:54] have said a few words, too. But all of a
[1:19:57] sudden, we got a church of over 3,000
[1:19:59] now at the first gospel meeting. It's a
[1:20:02] simple formula. Ministry speaks, God
[1:20:05] does the work. Yes, sir. I can't make
[1:20:07] you believe. I can try to keep you
[1:20:09] awake, but I can't make you believe.
[1:20:11] Praise God.
[1:20:13] We can promise you gold stars and
[1:20:15] coffee, but right now we're talking
[1:20:17] about the word. Billy Graham said, "I
[1:20:20] found that when the gospel of Jesus
[1:20:21] Christ is presented with authority,
[1:20:23] quoting from the very word of God, he
[1:20:25] then takes that message and drives it
[1:20:27] supernaturally into the human heart."
[1:20:29] Amen. Amen. He was smart enough to know
[1:20:31] that. You know, brother Brandon says,
[1:20:33] "Preaching is God's program."
[1:20:36] Amen. So, we preach the truth honestly.
[1:20:40] God does the work in the human heart.
[1:20:43] So, you might not be gifted like some of
[1:20:45] these people were talking about here,
[1:20:47] you know, but your life is preaching
[1:20:49] every waking moment.
[1:20:52] When you walk out these doors and that
[1:20:53] other church comes out, when you go to
[1:20:55] lunch, you're just your life is
[1:20:57] preaching. You know, amen. A long time
[1:21:01] ago, like 900 900 years ago, there was a
[1:21:04] man in the Catholic church called
[1:21:05] Francis of
[1:21:06] Ais. So, brother Bram said he was a
[1:21:09] preacher of the gospel. So, we'll leave
[1:21:10] it at that. But he said, "Preach
[1:21:14] always. Use words when necessary."
[1:21:17] But see, we're 21st century Americans.
[1:21:21] We got our little buddy here. We're
[1:21:22] going to blah blah blah blah, you know.
[1:21:25] No, just live it. Yes, sir. If there's
[1:21:28] something in them, they will ask a
[1:21:29] question.
[1:21:31] Then you better have a answer ready.
[1:21:33] That's right. Don't Don't call Brother
[1:21:34] Jack. He's got other things to do.
[1:21:38] He might not even be on this continent.
[1:21:42] But when people ask why do you dress the
[1:21:45] way you dress as opposed to all the
[1:21:47] other harlots, you know why? Why this?
[1:21:50] Because the Bible. Because God has
[1:21:53] promised one man's spirit five times in
[1:21:58] the Bible. Elijah, it's in your Bible.
[1:22:02] You don't have to carry your Bible. Hey,
[1:22:03] let me use your Bible. There's Elijah.
[1:22:06] Elijah. Oh, yeah. I got that. Okay,
[1:22:08] let's go to John the Baptist. Oh, yeah.
[1:22:09] It does say that. And over here in
[1:22:11] chapter four, it says two different
[1:22:13] people. And Jesus said, "He'll surely
[1:22:16] come and restore." So, we've enjoyed the
[1:22:18] message of restoration.
[1:22:20] Okay. So from 42 to 45 there was unity
[1:22:25] of purpose and fellowship. That was
[1:22:28] God's program at that time. You see and
[1:22:31] some have tried it today to form a
[1:22:33] commune and let's put all the money in
[1:22:35] the basket and just use what we need. It
[1:22:37] doesn't work today. There's not enough
[1:22:39] Holy Ghost. There's too much, you know,
[1:22:41] uh crazy stuff going on. It was for them
[1:22:44] then. And in verse 46, it looks like
[1:22:46] they went to church every day. Huh? You
[1:22:48] think you got it tough? No. Every day.
[1:22:51] All right, brother. Yeah. They met
[1:22:53] together daily in their homes, Holy
[1:22:55] Ghost fellowship. They ate together.
[1:22:58] They remembered the Lord. They were
[1:23:00] actually having communion every day.
[1:23:02] Amen. Because in Luke 22, as often as
[1:23:04] you do this, you're remembering my
[1:23:06] death. You know, nowhere in the Bible
[1:23:09] does it say to remember my birth.
[1:23:11] No, that's all it's all Catholic.
[1:23:15] No, remember his death and resurrection.
[1:23:18] Yeah. Verse 47 says, "The Lord added
[1:23:21] daily to the church. God is in charge.
[1:23:24] We're only the instruments." You see,
[1:23:27] ready and willing to be used. Praise
[1:23:29] God. Brother Random said, "I'm just a
[1:23:31] public servant of God to you." And see,
[1:23:34] God knew when to take him because
[1:23:36] worship was already forming. You know,
[1:23:39] worship was forming. And a few years
[1:23:42] after he left, I made the statement, you
[1:23:44] know, all we need is the candles. we'd
[1:23:47] be just like the Catholic Church.
[1:23:50] And today it's even worse. So, so God
[1:23:53] knows what he's doing. He says, "I'm
[1:23:55] just a public servant to you." Just like
[1:23:56] the garbage man, the policeman public
[1:23:59] servant. Wow. The preacher is a public
[1:24:02] servant.
[1:24:03] So, we are not the managers of God's
[1:24:06] bride. All right. Amen. That's right. We
[1:24:09] can't tell you how to dress and how to
[1:24:10] do this. No. Just preach the gospel. The
[1:24:13] spirit of God will take care of that.
[1:24:14] Amen. Amen. We're only following New
[1:24:17] Testament examples. Yes, sir. Okay,
[1:24:19] let's see if we can get through a couple
[1:24:20] more chapters here. What time we got to
[1:24:21] go?
[1:24:24] Lunchtime. We'll be out before lunch.
[1:24:26] Don't worry. You all look pretty
[1:24:30] well. Okay. So, chapter three and four
[1:24:32] go together. It's a six-part drama.
[1:24:35] Okay. Power in the name of Jesus, which
[1:24:38] means Jehovah is salvation. So act one
[1:24:41] is verse 1- 11 of chapter 3. It records
[1:24:44] the healing of the lame man at the gate
[1:24:46] beautiful. This is the golden gate, the
[1:24:50] eastern gate. He was sealed up in 1541
[1:24:53] in an effort by the non-Jews at that
[1:24:55] time to prevent the Messiah from
[1:24:57] entering. You see,
[1:25:01] um, Jerusalem is a walled city. They
[1:25:05] didn't have airplanes. If you're going
[1:25:06] to attack, you got to go on ground. So
[1:25:08] they walled the city. had eight gates.
[1:25:10] So they sealed up this one gate because
[1:25:12] they they had a belief clear back then
[1:25:14] he'll come through the eastern gate.
[1:25:16] Yeah. Well, they sealed it up. It's
[1:25:18] bricked up till today. Not coming
[1:25:20] through here. Well, you know, Jesus
[1:25:22] doesn't need a open door. Come through
[1:25:24] the wall. Amen. But um according to
[1:25:29] scripture, Peter and John were going up
[1:25:31] to the temple at the appointed time, 9th
[1:25:33] hour, which is 3:00 p.m. And in verse
[1:25:36] two of chapter 3, and a certain man lame
[1:25:40] from his mother's womb, was carried,
[1:25:42] whom they lay daily at the gate of the
[1:25:44] temple, which is called beautiful, to
[1:25:47] ask alms of them that entered into the
[1:25:50] temple. Now, see, your Bible is full of
[1:25:52] details.
[1:25:54] This man didn't fall off a truck. No, he
[1:25:56] was born wrong. I don't know if you ever
[1:25:58] seen anybody like that, but it's like
[1:26:00] spaghetti. They can't do anything. No
[1:26:02] muscle, no
[1:26:03] nothing. And it says here, so the the
[1:26:06] lay man, he sees Peter and John coming.
[1:26:08] Now, this man, he's he's sitting on the
[1:26:10] ground, you know, he can't move, can't
[1:26:12] get up and go get a drink. He's sitting
[1:26:13] still and he's looking down. Arms for
[1:26:16] the poor. Arms for the poor. And he sees
[1:26:17] his feet
[1:26:18] approaching. And so he's begging for
[1:26:20] everybody that comes by. And so um he
[1:26:23] saw these two guys approaching and Peter
[1:26:26] fastening his eyes on him and John look
[1:26:30] on us. In other words, lift up your head
[1:26:32] and look at us. Wow.
[1:26:34] And he gave heed. He looked at him
[1:26:36] expecting to receive, you know, some
[1:26:37] money. Then Peter said, we don't have
[1:26:41] silver or gold. We're just poor
[1:26:42] preachers, you know. That's right. Yeah.
[1:26:44] But such as I do have, I give you in the
[1:26:47] name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise
[1:26:49] up and walk. And nobody ever said that
[1:26:51] to him. But here's two representatives
[1:26:54] that know the power, you know, and he
[1:26:58] and he didn't just stand back and holler
[1:26:59] at him. No, he reached down by the right
[1:27:02] hand, says right there, and lifted him
[1:27:04] up. And immediately his feet and uh
[1:27:08] ankle bones receive strength. So
[1:27:11] immediately he's got muscles, that he
[1:27:14] never had before.
[1:27:16] This man's about your age. He's over 35,
[1:27:19] 40. Yeah. He's never never walked. Wow.
[1:27:23] Immediately he's up here with the rest
[1:27:24] of us. Wow. Amazing. Amen.
[1:27:28] And so he leaping stood up and walked
[1:27:32] and entered with them into the temple
[1:27:34] walking and leaping and praising God.
[1:27:37] And all the people saw him walking and
[1:27:39] praising God. Well, I imagine so.
[1:27:41] They've been seeing him there for 40
[1:27:42] years now. He's walking. Amen. Huh. And
[1:27:45] they knew that he was the guy that been
[1:27:48] sitting there for years.
[1:27:49] And um and
[1:27:52] so they they have this tension. Wow. Now
[1:27:55] what what's going on here? And um of
[1:27:58] course he was he was very happy, you
[1:28:00] know. And so in verse
[1:28:03] 11, they're greatly wondering. This is
[1:28:06] act two. The first part is act three.
[1:28:08] Now act two greatly wondering. So Peter
[1:28:10] saw that he had their full attention and
[1:28:12] he preaches sermon number two. Because
[1:28:14] see, a an evangelist, uh, somebody
[1:28:17] that's anointed of of God, they'll they
[1:28:20] can discern when to speak and when to
[1:28:22] just go away. So, he sees he's got their
[1:28:24] attention. And, uh, it's just it's an
[1:28:27] open street meeting. Now, it says going
[1:28:29] into the temple. They didn't come into
[1:28:30] church like this. No, the the the
[1:28:33] building was only where the priest went
[1:28:34] in, but they had a big courtyard out
[1:28:36] there, and that's where all this has
[1:28:37] taken place. Wonderful. So act three,
[1:28:40] Peter's sermon identifies Jesus with the
[1:28:42] I am of Israel's history. Oh yeah, we
[1:28:45] all agree. Amen. Yeah, we can agree to
[1:28:47] that. Title could have been covenants
[1:28:50] will be fulfilled. Could have been. So
[1:28:54] 12-18. And when Peter saw it, u he
[1:28:58] answered unto the people, "Ye men of
[1:29:01] Israel, why marvel you at this? Why why
[1:29:04] you look on us so earnestly as though we
[1:29:07] did this by our own power?" No. The God
[1:29:10] of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, the God
[1:29:14] of our fathers, hath glorified his son
[1:29:17] Jesus, whom you delivered up, and denied
[1:29:21] him in the presence of Pilate, when he
[1:29:24] was determined to let him go.
[1:29:27] But you you denied the holy one and the
[1:29:30] just and desired a murderer to be
[1:29:33] granted unto you. And you killed the
[1:29:36] prince of whom God hath raised from the
[1:29:38] dead. Wherefore we are
[1:29:42] witnesses and this name see and his
[1:29:46] name. See it's all about his name. All
[1:29:47] through this book it wasn't his name.
[1:29:50] and his name through faith in his name
[1:29:52] hath made this man strong whom you see
[1:29:55] and know the faith which is by him hath
[1:29:59] given this perfect soundness in the
[1:30:02] presence of you all and now brethren I
[1:30:06] uh what that's an old word that means I
[1:30:08] wish and now brethren I wish that
[1:30:10] through ignorance I know that through
[1:30:12] ignorance you've done this as did also
[1:30:14] your rulers but these things those
[1:30:17] things which God hath showed by the
[1:30:21] mouth of all his holy prophets that
[1:30:23] Christ should suffer, he hath so
[1:30:26] fulfilled. All the things that happened
[1:30:28] to Christ was spoken of in scripture.
[1:30:31] You know,
[1:30:33] so this goes on and on and and it shows
[1:30:36] that there's hope for us in the 21st
[1:30:37] century because he's he's speaking there
[1:30:40] of of history, but he goes down here in
[1:30:42] verse 19, repent therefore and be
[1:30:44] converted that your sins may be blotted
[1:30:46] out. Because see, the gospel came first
[1:30:49] to the Jews. Yes, sir. Jesus was raised
[1:30:51] Jewish. He knew who he was, gave his
[1:30:54] life. It all it was just Jews. We were
[1:30:57] club. We had club on our back, you know,
[1:30:58] we were nobody. And so, um, it says
[1:31:02] here, "The times of refreshing shall
[1:31:05] come from the presence of the Lord, and
[1:31:07] he shall send Jesus Christ, which before
[1:31:09] was preached unto you, whom the heaven
[1:31:11] must receive." In other words, like it
[1:31:14] says in the Bible in Spanish, the heaven
[1:31:16] must hold back until the restitution of
[1:31:18] all things. So there's our time right
[1:31:20] there in that verse. Exactly. Right.
[1:31:23] He's going to be there until the bride
[1:31:25] is restored till the last one comes in
[1:31:26] and then we'll go. So it all fits
[1:31:29] together. Amen.
[1:31:31] All we have to do is get in step.
[1:31:34] Act four is chapter
[1:31:39] Act four is chapter one uh chapter 4 1
[1:31:42] through 4. And as they spake unto the
[1:31:44] people, the priests and the captain of
[1:31:47] the temple and the Sadducees came upon
[1:31:49] them. Now here's a here's a miracle
[1:31:51] that's been done. They all all Jerusalem
[1:31:54] knew about this guy sitting there for 40
[1:31:55] years. Okay? And now he's walking. Now
[1:32:00] they got to come up with an answer. They
[1:32:02] can't line up with Peter, you know. So,
[1:32:05] they came upon them being grieved. Why
[1:32:08] are you grieved? This man's healed now.
[1:32:10] No, they're grieved. They weren't in
[1:32:12] charge of this
[1:32:13] miracle. Grieved that they that these
[1:32:16] they taught the people and preached
[1:32:18] through Jesus the resurrection from the
[1:32:20] dead and they laid their hands on him
[1:32:23] that they uh and they put him in holding
[1:32:25] in the prison the next day because it's
[1:32:28] already evening. So, it's coming
[1:32:29] nighttime. Put him in jail.
[1:32:32] and um first night in jail for preaching
[1:32:35] the truth. Amazing. Very large crowd.
[1:32:39] 5-7 says, "And it came to pass on the
[1:32:41] next day that the rulers, the elders,
[1:32:44] scribes and all these important people
[1:32:49] uh they uh they gathered in Jerusalem
[1:32:53] and when they had
[1:32:54] set the preachers, you know, in the
[1:32:56] midst, by what power? By what name? H
[1:33:00] how did you do this? And Peter said,
[1:33:04] well with the filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:33:06] said unto them, you rulers of the
[1:33:09] people, elders of Israel, if this day
[1:33:12] were examined of the good deed done
[1:33:13] under this impented man, by what means
[1:33:16] he is made whole, be it known to you and
[1:33:20] all the people of Israel, you know, send
[1:33:22] the news out that by the name of Jesus
[1:33:25] Christ of Nazareth, whom you guys
[1:33:27] crucified, every time he puts that in
[1:33:29] there. That's right. Whom God raised
[1:33:32] from the dead, has given that man, he
[1:33:35] can stand here before you whole. This is
[1:33:37] the stone which is set it not of you uh
[1:33:41] builders which has become the headstone
[1:33:43] of the corner. Neither is there
[1:33:46] salvation in any other. But there's none
[1:33:48] other name under heaven, not the name of
[1:33:51] Smith or Brandom or anything else. No,
[1:33:54] no other name given amongst men whereby
[1:33:57] we must be saved. God, so he's he's
[1:34:01] wrapping it up real tight there, you
[1:34:02] know. Okay. So, Act
[1:34:05] five is uh Peter and John, they were
[1:34:08] released. Yeah. Verse
[1:34:11] 13. Then when they had And when they saw
[1:34:14] the boldness of Peter and John and
[1:34:16] received and perceived that they were
[1:34:18] unlearned and ignorant. See, they
[1:34:20] weren't only unlearned. didn't have no
[1:34:22] education, but they were ignorant.
[1:34:24] That's pretty bad.
[1:34:27] They
[1:34:28] marveled and to acknowledge that they
[1:34:31] had been with Jesus. Have is anybody in
[1:34:34] your life that last week, did they take
[1:34:37] notice that you've been with Jesus?
[1:34:38] Praise God. Did they Did they see you
[1:34:42] weaving in traffic? It's not Jesus.
[1:34:47] Glory. I mean, they do that out here.
[1:34:49] It's crazy.
[1:34:51] I'm going 65 and they're going 90.
[1:34:54] So, it's going to be by your life. It's
[1:34:57] not going to be how many tracks you pass
[1:34:59] out, how many church age books. No, your
[1:35:01] life is going to show. Just like here,
[1:35:04] they took notice they've been with
[1:35:06] Jesus. And beholding the man which was
[1:35:10] healed standing with him, they could say
[1:35:13] nothing against him. In other words, we
[1:35:15] okay, we realize this man's healed. Just
[1:35:17] don't use that name anymore. that don't
[1:35:19] don't use that name. But that's the
[1:35:21] power. Amen. You know, amen. Praise God.
[1:35:24] Well, so they were released. They were
[1:35:26] warned. Don't use that name anymore. And
[1:35:29] then verse 23, they had a testimony
[1:35:31] service. And when they were while
[1:35:33] they're testifying where they're telling
[1:35:34] about the great things and we we we
[1:35:37] suffered for his name's sake and so
[1:35:38] forth, God sends an earthquake to that
[1:35:40] region. Yes, sir. Yeah. It says right
[1:35:42] there in the scripture. And they were
[1:35:44] refilled with the Holy Ghost. Verse 31.
[1:35:46] And they shared joyfully. had things in
[1:35:48] common and u it was due to persecution
[1:35:52] you know it was voluntary it was only in
[1:35:54] Jerusalem so over here in the message um
[1:35:57] this great servant Moses brother Ram
[1:35:59] says as Moses went with that judgment
[1:36:01] stick before him that same stick tonight
[1:36:05] to the church is Jesus Christ if those
[1:36:08] Egyptians could have ever got that
[1:36:09] little simple stick out of Moses' hands
[1:36:12] they would have had him whipped and when
[1:36:14] the devil can get the deity out of the
[1:36:16] name of Jesus Christ. He's got the
[1:36:18] church whipped. We see it in action
[1:36:21] here.
[1:36:22] We don't see it a lot today, but it's
[1:36:24] still available. Yes, sir. And we see a
[1:36:26] defeated church a lot of times because
[1:36:28] they're not using what we have
[1:36:29] available.
[1:36:30] Amen. Paul wrote over here in to the
[1:36:33] saints in Philippi in chapter 2 of
[1:36:36] Philippians that at the name of Jesus
[1:36:38] every knee should bow of things in
[1:36:40] heaven, earth, under the earth, and that
[1:36:44] every tongue should confess that Jesus
[1:36:46] is Lord. That's coming soon. All the
[1:36:50] Muslims, all those crazy
[1:36:52] people, you know, those are those are
[1:36:54] children of Abraham also, but from the
[1:36:56] wrong side. And you know why we got this
[1:36:58] problem? Because God promised Abraham
[1:37:03] way back there in Genesis, I look
[1:37:05] Abraham, I love you and I know you're
[1:37:07] getting old, but through Sarah, you're
[1:37:10] going to have this son and you the whole
[1:37:12] promise. Okay, time goes by. It wasn't
[1:37:15] two weeks, it wasn't five months. Goes
[1:37:17] on and on and on. So finally Sarah
[1:37:21] having this great
[1:37:23] idea. Abraham, dear, now you see I'm
[1:37:26] old. I look ugly, right? So, you gave me
[1:37:28] this beautiful girl from down in Egypt.
[1:37:31] She's our mate. She sweeps. She does all
[1:37:33] the work here. And she's beautiful.
[1:37:34] Yeah, you're right. She's beautiful.
[1:37:36] Well, look, let's help God. You take her
[1:37:39] and go over there in the tent and then
[1:37:41] we'll have the baby and that we solve
[1:37:42] the problem. Wow. I can't I can't do it.
[1:37:46] Wow. From that day to this, we've got
[1:37:48] problems. That's right. Because she got
[1:37:51] her ideas in the middle. That's right,
[1:37:53] brother. Now you take like back there
[1:37:55] with Adam and Eve, we know the whole
[1:37:57] story thanks to William Brandon told us
[1:38:00] the whole story.
[1:38:02] But you see, if if Adam had been from
[1:38:06] the 21st century thinking, he would have
[1:38:09] said, "Now God, all due respect, sir,
[1:38:11] but look what this one
[1:38:13] did. I want another one."
[1:38:19] You know, God have mercy.
[1:38:21] You see, we got to make the Bible come
[1:38:23] alive. That's right, brother. And God
[1:38:26] only knows what the whole story is. I I
[1:38:28] don't know what's going to happen
[1:38:29] tomorrow. Amen. We We could have an
[1:38:32] earthquake right here and swallow the
[1:38:33] whole thing up. That's right. I mean,
[1:38:34] when California goes down, do you
[1:38:36] realize it's 500 4 to 500 miles wide,
[1:38:39] 1500 miles long? That's a pretty big
[1:38:41] chunk of land. When that goes
[1:38:44] under, water on the whole earth is going
[1:38:46] to be displaced.
[1:38:49] The Mississippi River is going to rise.
[1:38:50] That tide's going to go up into
[1:38:53] Kentucky. Forget Florida. Did you ever
[1:38:56] fly over Florida? It's like a pancake
[1:38:58] anyway. There's no hills here. So the a
[1:39:02] good 10-ft wave That's right. Wipe the
[1:39:04] whole thing off. So these things are
[1:39:07] coming, you know. Let's get ready to go.
[1:39:12] Read your Bible. Read your church age
[1:39:15] book. Pray. And what's number four?
[1:39:18] listen to God's prophet at least 30
[1:39:20] minutes. Okay. So, let's stop there.
[1:39:23] I'll be back. We'll continue with
[1:39:24] chapter five. Okay.
[1:39:29] [Applause]
[1:39:38] Praise the Lord.
[1:39:42] Uh, as I mentioned to you, um, just we
[1:39:47] got years of insight, uh, coming from
[1:39:50] from Brother George and just being,
[1:39:54] um, in the message around the message,
[1:39:57] uh, just seeing so much and I and and
[1:40:00] you know, I I love I love the balance. I
[1:40:03] just for me it just means it means
[1:40:06] everything. Um, and like you said, you
[1:40:09] know, we we've had for years years and
[1:40:12] years and years of people trying to go
[1:40:16] into the mysterious things of uh of this
[1:40:20] message and um and actually bringing out
[1:40:23] more confusion
[1:40:25] than um than we ever wanted,
[1:40:29] you know, ever needed. Uh I I know when
[1:40:32] I first came to the message and man we
[1:40:35] you know uh we just we heard we heard a
[1:40:38] lot of lot of deep
[1:40:40] things. We saw no life
[1:40:43] with all the deep things and and even
[1:40:46] even to this day I I I I listen to
[1:40:48] different people and you know they say
[1:40:50] different things and and I'm like that
[1:40:53] ain't
[1:40:54] right. That ain't all what the prophet
[1:40:56] said. you know, and and and like I told
[1:41:00] you all a few weeks ago, I look at
[1:41:02] charts. I'm like, "No, that chart is not
[1:41:05] using everything that the prophet said.
[1:41:06] You got one quote, but what about the
[1:41:08] rest of this?" Right? And u so we we
[1:41:11] want we want the whole thing. And and
[1:41:13] sometimes you just need to get right
[1:41:15] back down to just the basics, you know,
[1:41:17] of of what the prophet said. And and one
[1:41:20] of the things that he did tell us um
[1:41:23] when he preached the seals, he told us
[1:41:25] just live good godly lives. Don't don't
[1:41:29] don't try to make too much out of this,
[1:41:32] you know, more than what it is. Just
[1:41:34] live a good godly life. And and that
[1:41:37] that like you said, that's the Bible
[1:41:39] that people going to read, you know,
[1:41:40] that that's that's that's the thing
[1:41:42] they're going to see um when they see
[1:41:44] Christ manifested and living in you. Um
[1:41:48] and and even in witnessing we used to
[1:41:50] our witnessing was not witnessing about
[1:41:53] Christ.
[1:41:55] Our witnessing was um uh God sent a
[1:42:01] prophet.
[1:42:03] Well, they not saved yet.
[1:42:06] They're not even saved. They're not even
[1:42:08] Christians. Why we talking about a
[1:42:10] prophet and they don't even know Jesus?
[1:42:14] Right? And and and that's what we threw
[1:42:16] so many people off by that is God sent a
[1:42:18] prophet. You need to know this prophet.
[1:42:19] Like no, no, no, no, no. Do you know
[1:42:20] Jesus?
[1:42:22] If you don't know Christ, you'll never
[1:42:24] know nothing about this prophet. I'm
[1:42:25] telling you, you'll never even
[1:42:27] understand anything about it. You know,
[1:42:29] but first, we need to get you to first
[1:42:30] base. Do you know Jesus? The one that
[1:42:33] can wash your sins away. And then you
[1:42:36] start telling them how your sins got
[1:42:38] washed away. Right. And from that, now
[1:42:41] you begin to win people to Christ. Amen.
[1:42:45] I thank God for the word today. I uh I I
[1:42:49] really really
[1:42:50] do very very uh very very grateful and
[1:42:54] and and
[1:42:57] um Brother George made the statement
[1:42:59] didn't realize uh what he said. He says
[1:43:03] um you know all we got to do is just get
[1:43:07] get in step. And that that was our theme
[1:43:10] for last year. Get back in step.
[1:43:12] So, uh, we've been still kind of flowing
[1:43:15] with that theme for this year. But
[1:43:16] that's that's what the whole thing is
[1:43:17] all about. Getting in step with the word
[1:43:20] of God. That that's that's the primary
[1:43:22] thing we're trying to do. Get in step
[1:43:24] with the word of God. Amen. Lord have
[1:43:28] mercy. Um, as I was fellowshipping with
[1:43:32] brother George on last night, I just
[1:43:34] realized that, you know, we have done
[1:43:36] many years of of trying to argue with
[1:43:39] people about different things. And and I
[1:43:42] I don't been a part of many
[1:43:44] conversations where I'm I'm going to I'm
[1:43:46] going to prove to you
[1:43:49] uh what the prophet said and what the
[1:43:51] scriptures say. And and I even notice,
[1:43:53] you know, different people when they and
[1:43:55] they when they text and things like
[1:43:56] that, they they make sure they inject,
[1:43:59] you know, certain scriptures to try to
[1:44:01] show I'm I'm I'm scripturally sound and
[1:44:04] and what I'm saying to you. And uh so I
[1:44:08] try to just, you know, try to avoid
[1:44:11] that. I'mma just say what I need to say.
[1:44:14] And I already know the word is in me.
[1:44:16] And if you know the word, this little
[1:44:18] sentence that I'm putting here, you know
[1:44:20] it came from the Bible, right? Without
[1:44:23] me quoting exactly where it came from,
[1:44:25] right? But but people are always trying
[1:44:27] to dispute.
[1:44:30] It's always a dis a dispute. We got to
[1:44:33] move away from that, right? Uh we we
[1:44:36] know what God has said to us. Let's just
[1:44:38] take it and and live it and not worry
[1:44:40] about dispute with nobody. Uh even even
[1:44:43] online,
[1:44:45] folk post things in order to try to draw
[1:44:50] you.
[1:44:51] They they try to draw you in. And and
[1:44:54] sometimes you just got to avoid it right
[1:44:56] now. Now I get Brother Smiley made a
[1:44:58] comment a few weeks ago. Now I get what
[1:44:59] he's saying. I I actually saw the video
[1:45:02] that he was talking about and and and
[1:45:04] I'm like cuz I first I didn't know what
[1:45:06] he was talking about. Then I said, "Oh
[1:45:07] Lord, this is what this man doing
[1:45:09] preaching dressed like this." Brother
[1:45:11] Smileer said his just righteous
[1:45:13] indignation just would not let him p let
[1:45:16] that pass by. He had to say something
[1:45:18] kind of like what brother Brandham did
[1:45:19] when he saw them ladies in the in the
[1:45:21] hotel room. He had to say something to
[1:45:23] them. Right? They talk about whoopy this
[1:45:25] is life. He said no no no this ain't
[1:45:26] life. This is death. Right? He had to
[1:45:29] say something. So brother Smiler say I
[1:45:30] had to say he say a man there's
[1:45:33] something about a man that he won't go
[1:45:35] that far and dressing like that. Right.
[1:45:39] A man should there's something in a man
[1:45:42] that would say no. And I say I
[1:45:44] appreciate that, brother. I thank God
[1:45:46] for that. So sometimes we have to do
[1:45:48] that. But we're not going to dispute.
[1:45:49] Let's let's let's move away from from
[1:45:52] those things. God God bless you. God
[1:45:54] bless you. Amen. We thank the Lord. We
[1:45:57] thank the Lord. Let's give the Lord a
[1:45:58] hand of
[1:46:01] praise.
[1:46:03] [Applause]
[1:46:05] Amen. Amen.
[1:46:07] Um let us um um just give me something
[1:46:12] softly there and and what we'll do is
[1:46:15] we'll have a word of prayer and prepare
[1:46:16] to dismiss you. Just remember on tonight
[1:46:21] um brother George be ministering there
[1:46:23] in Boon Beach and
[1:46:27] um I know it'll be a blessing uh to you
[1:46:31] if you're able to come and just be you
[1:46:34] know in the service. Um
[1:46:38] just I'm
[1:46:41] I'm there's a lot said and some
[1:46:44] sometimes I don't know if we get it all
[1:46:45] but I I was just kind of you know
[1:46:47] gleaning and writing a little notes and
[1:46:50] um one of the things that that was said
[1:46:53] here is um we are a church of Christians
[1:46:57] in progress.
[1:47:00] and he made the the
[1:47:03] statement not everybody came in the same
[1:47:06] color car,
[1:47:08] right? And if you just look around the
[1:47:11] the the sanctuary uh today, not
[1:47:15] everybody dressed
[1:47:17] alike, not everybody look
[1:47:20] alike, but we're all still God's people.
[1:47:24] Amen. And and and what I gathered from
[1:47:26] that statement is if we can learn to
[1:47:29] respect our differences,
[1:47:33] I'm going say that again. If we can
[1:47:35] learn to respect our differences, then
[1:47:38] we can get a little further up the road.
[1:47:41] Now, that's just I'm talking uh church
[1:47:45] wise. Now in your family, if you can
[1:47:48] learn to respect the differences that
[1:47:50] God has made us all uniquely different,
[1:47:54] we got different temperaments, we got
[1:47:56] different uh thoughts, different
[1:47:58] desires, different actions, everything
[1:48:00] is different. If we can learn to respect
[1:48:02] our
[1:48:04] differences, it would bring such a
[1:48:06] unity.
[1:48:09] Even on your job
[1:48:12] when you get to when you get to work,
[1:48:14] everybody pull up differently. We got
[1:48:17] different cars. We we go to different
[1:48:19] homes when we leave work. We got
[1:48:21] different addresses. I mean, it's
[1:48:22] everything is different different. If
[1:48:25] you can learn to respect the differences
[1:48:29] and and and when you go to work, you
[1:48:31] know, you have to respect differences.
[1:48:32] You just can't. You got to learn how to
[1:48:34] work along with your co-workers. Praise
[1:48:36] the Lord. It can't always be your way.
[1:48:41] Amen.
[1:48:42] Right. I mean, this this this just life
[1:48:44] in general, right? It can't always be
[1:48:46] your way. Sometimes you have to
[1:48:48] sacrifice. You got to pull back and let
[1:48:50] your coworker kind of take the lead.
[1:48:53] Same thing in church. Sometimes you got
[1:48:54] to pull back and let somebody else kind
[1:48:56] of take lead. You know, you got to do
[1:48:57] the same thing in at home. Sometime you
[1:48:59] have to make the adjustments in order to
[1:49:02] make things work smoothly.
[1:49:05] I I just like I'm telling you it's it's
[1:49:08] the little insight that will take you so
[1:49:11] much further if you just catch what is
[1:49:14] being spoken to you. I'm I'm
[1:49:17] I'm I'm I'm I'm
[1:49:19] happy. I'm happy with with the word that
[1:49:23] we we got and and and as um Brother
[1:49:26] Solomon was just mentioning to me uh and
[1:49:28] brother George came and and confirmed it
[1:49:30] here today. Uh you all are aware of the
[1:49:34] um
[1:49:35] of the pope from the United States and I
[1:49:38] mentioned this on on on
[1:49:41] uh Wednesday night. I I am I'm just I'm
[1:49:44] crazy enough to believe that brother
[1:49:48] Brandham could have even said what city
[1:49:50] that pope was coming from.
[1:49:53] He just said a pope from the United
[1:49:55] States. And I love the way brother
[1:49:57] George brought that back around because
[1:50:01] uh when prophecy is, you know, is going
[1:50:03] forth, uh even when you look at the
[1:50:06] scripture and Jesus
[1:50:08] himself
[1:50:10] prophesies that there will be an Elijah
[1:50:12] that comes and restores all things.
[1:50:14] Brother George say this is Jesus now
[1:50:18] speaking of this. You think Jesus didn't
[1:50:20] know his name?
[1:50:25] Jesus. Yes. Who knows all things? You
[1:50:28] think you think Jesus could he could
[1:50:30] have said he could have he could have
[1:50:32] put in a scripture uh there's going to
[1:50:34] be a prophet by the name of William
[1:50:36] Miriam Brandom that's going to come and
[1:50:37] restore all things. Here's the problem
[1:50:40] with that. And this and and this this
[1:50:42] insight helps us. Here's the problem.
[1:50:45] Had he put the name there, everybody
[1:50:48] would have come naming their child
[1:50:50] William Mary and Brandon. And we'd have
[1:50:52] been looking at all these children
[1:50:54] wondering which one is the prophet. He
[1:50:57] left the name out intentionally
[1:50:59] and we have to identify the spirit that
[1:51:02] is on the man.
[1:51:05] How he aligns himself with the word.
[1:51:07] That's what we have to identify with.
[1:51:09] Not the name but the spirit.
[1:51:12] We see the spirit of Elijah here. We see
[1:51:15] the spirit of Elijah right here.
[1:51:19] And that's why we say this is the man We
[1:51:22] know who it is. I mean, look, Brother
[1:51:23] Brandham, and and that's why God's
[1:51:25] thoughts are so so so much further than
[1:51:27] our thoughts. We And oh, Lord have
[1:51:30] mercy. Oo.
[1:51:34] 21st century Adam,
[1:51:39] y'all. I don't know if we catching these
[1:51:41] things. A 21st century Adam, Eve get
[1:51:46] caught like that.
[1:51:48] 21st century Adam say, "God, this woman
[1:51:51] you gave me, look at what she
[1:51:55] did." I got another ribbon here.
[1:52:01] [Applause]
[1:52:02] [Music]
[1:52:05] It's a truth in the house.
[1:52:08] I I got I ain't got no more ribs. You
[1:52:10] can create a rib. But her sir, she's
[1:52:14] gone.
[1:52:17] [Music]
[1:52:18] Thank God Adam was living in the 21st
[1:52:20] century.
[1:52:23] But but but we we realize that Adam
[1:52:27] doing what he did. I was talking to the
[1:52:29] brother when he when Adam put his life
[1:52:32] in
[1:52:33] Eve. Do you realize Adam was a son of
[1:52:37] God? He has God he had God's life in him
[1:52:42] and he gave God's life to Eve.
[1:52:46] And this simply was um a type of what
[1:52:51] would happen when Christ went to a cross
[1:52:55] that he would give his life
[1:52:57] for us. Amen.
[1:53:01] We
[1:53:04] We got to be able to take some things,
[1:53:05] church. And I And And when I say we got
[1:53:07] to be able to take some
[1:53:10] things, we going to we got to die to
[1:53:13] ourselves.
[1:53:15] We got to die to our thoughts. We got to
[1:53:19] die to how we feel.
[1:53:21] We got We got to die to um you know, I
[1:53:24] I'm right and I'm going to always be
[1:53:27] right. We We got to die to this. The The
[1:53:30] scripture says except the corner wheat
[1:53:32] go in the ground and
[1:53:34] die alone.
[1:53:37] If you're not willing to die, the Jesus
[1:53:39] said you're going to abide alone. And
[1:53:41] and brother Brandham said, not only just
[1:53:43] die, he said it's got to
[1:53:46] rot.
[1:53:49] Unless you're willing to
[1:53:51] die,
[1:53:53] rot, you'll abide
[1:53:56] alone. But if you go through the process
[1:53:59] of death and rotting, you know what the
[1:54:01] Bible says? You'll bring forth much
[1:54:05] fruit.
[1:54:07] Yes, sir. But it takes a death in order
[1:54:10] to see life. And like he told us, you
[1:54:15] know, Jesus spoke more about remember my
[1:54:19] death. Not remember my life, but
[1:54:21] remember my death. I wonder if anybody
[1:54:24] else in the bride of Christ could say,
[1:54:26] "Lord, remember when I died to this
[1:54:28] situation, when I died to that
[1:54:30] circumstance. I died to what they were
[1:54:32] saying about me. I died to what they
[1:54:33] were thinking about me. I died. I died.
[1:54:35] I died. I died."
[1:54:37] You know, you know how a person dead? My
[1:54:40] pastor told us this. Say, when you kick
[1:54:42] a dead man,
[1:54:46] he don't say nothing. Not only does he
[1:54:49] not say nothing, you know what? You kick
[1:54:50] a dead man, he don't even feel it.
[1:54:54] [Music]
[1:54:59] We need some dead men and dead women.
[1:55:01] Amen. Where you don't feel that hurt,
[1:55:03] you don't feel that pain. Cuz when you
[1:55:05] feel it, you respond differently.
[1:55:07] But when you don't feel it, it like it
[1:55:09] never it never even bothers you.
[1:55:13] Lord, help us die.
[1:55:15] Help us die.
[1:55:17] Let's
[1:55:18] pray.
[1:55:21] Father, the word of the Lord has come.
[1:55:25] [Music]
[1:55:28] Father, as brother George just labored
[1:55:30] here this morning, we could hear your
[1:55:32] voice speaking clearly to us and to our
[1:55:37] circumstances and our
[1:55:39] situations. If we would just
[1:55:42] abide by the word of God, we will see
[1:55:46] change and we would
[1:55:47] see
[1:55:49] transformation. And he was like, it's
[1:55:51] just it's the preacher's job. Just just
[1:55:53] preach the truth. Just bring the word
[1:55:56] forth to the people. When you bring that
[1:55:58] word, just preach Christ, make them
[1:56:00] real. When you do that, it's God's job
[1:56:03] to take it and and add to the church
[1:56:06] just as we saw in the book of Acts.
[1:56:10] Peter stood up and quoted Joel too and
[1:56:13] and father somehow someway you begin to
[1:56:16] deal with hearts and 3,000 people were
[1:56:20] added to the
[1:56:22] church God in one day. So Lord, we know
[1:56:25] that that that this this word that we
[1:56:28] have is a word that transforms and
[1:56:32] changes lives if we would allow the word
[1:56:35] to do what it
[1:56:37] does. As as we heard this morning, Sarah
[1:56:41] got in the way of the
[1:56:43] word. She had her ideas. She had her
[1:56:46] thoughts. And that created more problems
[1:56:49] in the world. We still have those
[1:56:51] problems from that day all the way to
[1:56:53] this day because somebody got in in in
[1:56:57] the way of the
[1:56:58] word. Father, promise has been given and
[1:57:01] and all we need to do is Lord, just stay
[1:57:02] with that promise. Help us to stand
[1:57:05] behind the word. not get in front of it,
[1:57:06] but just stay behind it and allow your
[1:57:09] word to do, Father, exactly what you
[1:57:11] promised that it would do. Sometimes it
[1:57:13] requires a death to ourselves, just as
[1:57:15] you had to go to a cross and die. We
[1:57:17] have to take up our cross and we have to
[1:57:19] follow you,
[1:57:20] Jesus. We follow you into death because
[1:57:22] we know also as we follow into death,
[1:57:25] you will bring us forth into life.
[1:57:28] Father, I pray that you'd bless your
[1:57:30] servant, God. We thank you for him just
[1:57:32] pressing his way to come and share with
[1:57:34] us today.
[1:57:36] God, as you would uh uh take them
[1:57:38] tonight there to Boon Beach, Lord, use
[1:57:40] them once more for your glory and for
[1:57:41] your honor. And just trust, oh God, that
[1:57:44] um uh the saints would be blessed, that
[1:57:47] the right word would be spoken for that
[1:57:49] church. You know exactly what they're
[1:57:50] going through. And just as you spoke the
[1:57:52] right word to us on today, Father, we uh
[1:57:55] ask that you give them traveling mercies
[1:57:56] as he prepares to go back home on
[1:57:58] tomorrow. He has a long drive, but Lord,
[1:58:00] be with him, Lord, as he goes. him. And
[1:58:03] uh Lord, we just pray that you just
[1:58:05] continue to use him for your glory.
[1:58:06] Bless the saints that have come, those
[1:58:09] that have joined online, those that have
[1:58:10] heard the word of God. May this word
[1:58:13] produce life. God, don't let it just be
[1:58:16] something that goes in one ear and out
[1:58:18] the other, but Father, may it be
[1:58:20] something that we meditate on, we ponder
[1:58:22] on, we think about that Christ himself
[1:58:24] might come alive on the inside of
[1:58:28] us. It's in Jesus name that we pray.
[1:58:33] Amen. Amen. God richly bless you. Amen.
[1:58:38] We'll have uh the brothers come at this
[1:58:41] time to dismiss you. Amen. And we will
[1:58:45] look forward to seeing you all again on
[1:58:48] Wednesday night. Amen. At uh 7:30 as we
[1:58:53] just continue our journey uh through the
[1:58:55] scriptures there on Wednesday night. God
[1:58:57] bless you. Amen. And the brothers will
[1:58:59] come at this
[1:59:00] [Music]
[1:59:19] time. Heat.
[1:59:25] [Music]
[1:59:42] Heat.
[1:59:44] [Music]
[2:00:03] Heat. Heat.
