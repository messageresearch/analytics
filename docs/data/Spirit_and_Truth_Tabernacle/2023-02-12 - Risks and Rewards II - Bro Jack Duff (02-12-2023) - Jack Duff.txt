information uh sister Tanya sister Erica are kind of taking this and you can RSVP through them so sometimes sister Erica so keep that in mind uh now here on the giving this is uh very important I want to just kind of share this today I know that there we had a number of people that were watching service on last week online and they saw that we had cut the service a little short and they heard me announce on the on the stream that I need to meet with the church and and I just wanted to share that we had a local church meeting and I just wanted to share with our local church before it kind of got out online but you all many that have been online and I want to say this specifically to the people that have joined us online many have been praying with us on this journey to find a building you have watched us go from place to place from room to room you watched it and some of it I see y'all in a new place I see over here I see well we we they were asking me y'all got y'all church yesterday not yet but I I am happy to announce amen today that the Lord has blessed us to put a contract on a church amen praise the Lord glory to God amen uh so paperwork has been signed we have a closing date set for April and as I mentioned to the church there are a few hurdles that need to be jumped and uh and we are praying through all those hurdles thank you all uh I mean some people uh joined us last week on our three-day fast uh and uh and we're grateful for all the the uh prayerful support that we have been getting please continue to keep us in prayer as we go through this journey and uh the other thing that I'm going to ask for those that are joining us online I know that this may not be your home Church uh but we would ask that if you would like to contribute towards amen our uh uh purchasing of this property we would certainly welcome him and I wanted to share a quick testimony with you I was um this spirit and Truth is is where I attend church but I used to work for another local church here in the area and uh and I remember they were uh going through they were building a new campus and they were getting ready to go into that new campus and they asked all the staff people if they would just make a special offering towards that now I did not attend that church and I didn't really need to give them anything because I was not a part of their church but I said you know what wait a minute um these people have helped me right they put food on my table and and I know this ministry has been a help to many out there so this is why I'm asking this and you you'll find that I probably won't access ever again we only get to me I feel like we're only gonna have one time to buy a church like this uh if God got something in our future that's fine but but where we are now you know I'm just saying if we've been a help to you then just consider this but I said those people were help to me and um and I went home and uh and I just began to talk to my wife about uh how can we what can you know I would like to just give something to this church and and I was in a really really tight spot at the moment uh my house was uh they were threatening to take my house away because I hadn't made payments I was out of work and I couldn't make payments I was out of work for probably a good six or seven months and um and so you know I was just in a really really Jam there and they were threatening to come take my house away and served me with papers and all this and and here this church asked me to give at a time where it's really tight for me well I talked it over with my wife we prayed about it and we we actually made a fifteen hundred dollar pledge to that church it was it was a lot for us to give but we made a fifteen hundred dollar pledge to that church and I walked in uh one day and I just walked up and said here I just give the money you know for it you know you all asked for for people to give I'm giving fifteen hundred dollars towards it and uh just put it in um put an envelope and send it on off and just left it in God's hands after we gave that fifteen hundred dollars um I mean maybe a few weeks before they threatened to come take our house then I got a telephone call saying hey we want to work things out with you so you can keep your house but it was after I gave see what what released a blessing for me is when I gave come on somebody and I want to just share that because you know maybe maybe there might be some blessings that's been held up and and our giving is what releases it right so I'm I'm gonna ask it as we are on this journey you know April is when we're looking at closing and uh and we we you know we can we can never be short we can never have enough money I could say it like that for something like this and what I what I want to ask those that are joining us online uh this is not for the local church the local churches has already kind of contributed and they also going to continue to contribute they've made pledges you know and and those that are here locally if we ask you to just make your pledge today put your little um note inside the offering box as to what would you be able to give based on the amount we told you on last week what would you be able to give just put that in the offering box today just you know what your commitment is and I will go from there but we're asking those that are online if you would consider just pledging 500 towards what we're doing just those that are online if you would consider pledging five hundred dollars now some might say that's too much for me to give whatever you can just just be a blessing to Spirit and Truth Tabernacle and if somebody said well that's too little I want to give more we welcome that to God bless you amen we welcome it too but we're just saying if you would just would you consider giving 500 towards us and you can do that multiple ways right from your chair right from you sitting at right now you can stop on the side of the road if you listen and stop stop and pull up your cash app and go to dollar sign spirit and Truth tea praise the Lord go to go to Zale giving at John 423. say I'm gonna do something for the kingdom of God I got an opportunity and all not often you have opportunities like this and and sometimes you know here's what I learned that we have not because we ask not amen so sometimes people don't know what other people's needs are so I'm letting you know yes we do have a need we are we're we have a contract on a church and we plan on buying it amen and we could certainly use any help that we can get praise the Lord so you can you can use cash app you can use them if you say I don't have that but I got PayPal we'll take it PayPal take fees that's why we don't really use them but you will you can do PayPal giving at john423.org uh and also if you want to mail something into the church spirit and Truth Tabernacle PO Box 222462 West Palm Beach Florida 33422 and and we do receive I have even on this journey there's been different people that have male uh money for our building fund I want to say thank you some have sent it and put me in they say please don't tell anybody that we did this and I couldn't say nothing I couldn't say who it was what it was but I I tell you this much God knows you God saw that and I pray God will bless you amen so anybody else that wants to do that there's an opportunity amen that we have for you keep please keep us in prayer as we take this next step of our journey um I I I I I I'm expecting a miracle amen I'm expected America and I I I sister Bernice is playing I'm I'm gonna see a victory amen and I love that The Battle Belongs to the Lord it's not even our battle and you know one of the brothers has recently said he said you know he was thinking about you know some of this I mean and I'll just you know people people see and uh um this is a a very uh ex I don't say uh Florida West Palm Beach specifically it's very expensive place to live and um it's very hard for us to get property at a very cheap price it's hard the the basic house nowadays would cost four hundred thousand dollars now you can imagine what a church would cost for us this is a three million dollar deal three million dollars it's not easy right but you know what if God presented it to us and you open up this door then God gonna make a way for us it's just three million dollars so it's not not something like but our names is on the contract of a three million and when you look around you look at this this congregation like well that little congregation taking on all that old brother Jack man wait wait you forgot something you forgot something a little isn't much you didn't you didn't catch it yet you didn't see it you didn't hear it little is much when God is in it so we're not we're not we're not concerned about these things we know God is in control and and so every song you heard this morning it was it was it was directed just to encourage and uplift your faith we we we we we've taken a step of faith and we know God is in it we know God is in it praise the Lord so whatever you can do we certainly would appreciate if you want to just write a check for three million dollars we will we're going to say thank you we're going to say thank you we're going to say thank you we love you we love you praise God but God is good all right uh do I have any other announcements that I need to make mention of okay um next Sunday uh we will have brother Bill Hershberger uh coming from Sarasota and he'll be coming to speak over here uh for us he's also going to be speaking on Saturday night there is a group of Believers that are gathering I think in the Pompano Beach area um they and brother Bill and some of the brothers from over there they come over and they work with them um you know the Saints Prime predom predominantly speak Spanish and uh so they need brother bills you know sometimes he brings a brother that can speak in both you know English and Spanish and sometimes it does interpreting and all that but uh brother Bill say brother we can use some help because we come three hours maybe about 45 minutes from you all so next Saturday uh brother Josue and brother kwaku are gonna also go down to be a part of a service on Saturday night with this group and we just want to make ourselves available because brother brother brother brother kwaku can actually to speak Spanish he can preach in Spanish he don't want to but he can amen and uh but sometimes he like to take brother Josue as you know just an interpreter but uh we're looking just to kind of open up some fellowships some doors of fellowship with this uh this group of saints there just to let them know we're here we can help if you want our help we are here Amen to help so uh be in prayer Amen to the Lord will be with them I will actually be next week in New Mexico uh ministering in New Mexico a pastor that I met there and um and Arizona invited me to come to New Mexico so I'm going with brother Caleb Duran and uh we'll be there ministering together at a meeting in New Mexico so please keep us in prayer amen for next next Sunday uh praise the Lord amen our God is awesome he can move mountains amen amen I believe that I believe that musicians think y'all appreciate you all so much amen God bless you amen uh I want to continue our journey that we started on last week with risk and Rewards and um there's a a a scripture that I want to read a little differently than what we read on last week and we will just let the Lord have his way amen Let's uh let's get our Bibles and if you always stand with me I wanna [Music] praise the Lord all right um I want to read here from Matthew uh 19. and uh verses 27 through 30. a little different from what we read on last week verse 27 here in Matthew 19. then answered Peter and said unto him behold we have forsaken all and followed thee what shall we have therefore and Jesus said unto them verily I see unto you that we ye which have followed me in the Regeneration when the son of man shall sit in the Throne of his glory ye also shall sit upon twelve Thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel and everyone that have forsaken houses or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my name's sake shall receive a hundredfold and shall inherit everlasting life verse 30 says but many that are first shall be last and the last shall be first amen let's pray father we thank you for the word of the Lord we thank you God that we can read but God we need to be able to apply what we read to where we are so may the Holy Spirit come now and take control of these thoughts that you have given us today and Lord may you just direct it to the hearts of the people those that are present those that are online God directed and father may you just get all the glory and all the honor from our gathering here today it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you can be seated praise the lord we continue our journey here with risk a man uh and reward we started that on last week and and and and I wanted to just kind of move forward with this um the the word risk it means to expose someone or something valued to Danger harm or loss the word risk is to expose it to Danger harm or loss uh the word reward is a thing that's given in recognition for one's service their effort or achievement right it's it's what you receive in recognition of what you've done uh that's the reward now this term risk and reward is really a it's a business term but when we're talking about Christianity uh we need to understand that we're not taking risks amen what we are doing is stepping out on faith because the Bible tells us without faith it is impossible to please God Amen you you cannot please God if you're not willing to take a step of Faith blessed be the name of the Lord right so so here you know um uh even when I just kind of sort it through uh the message amen I was just looking for where where maybe brother Brandon might have used this word risk and there's very little uh quotes where he might have used this word rich but I did find one that I wanted to share with you Amen on today brother Branham talks about him taking a particular risk this is found in the sermon the power of God hallelujah it's found in the sermon the power of God and he makes a statement here he says here not long ago standing in a hospital with a young fellow about six seven years ago maybe a little better a young man dying with black diphtheria okay and he says the old dad called me to go pray for the baby or the boy rather he was about 15 years old and the boy was dying and the doctor he wouldn't let me go in he said you can't go in you got children of your own amen glory to God the man is telling the prophet you can't go in you got children of your own but brother Brandon makes a statement but I'll take the risks glory to God I like that I'll take the risk now goes on and says uh he says but you'll take diphtheria to your children it's what the doctors tell them says he says if I got faith enough to go into the diphtheria I got faith enough that God won't let my children take it Hallelujah amen he said you can't do it the man was was Catholic by faith I said now if I was a priest standing here and was going to give the last rights to that boy would you let pretty much would you let me in he says oh he said that's different he said I said no it isn't this is just as sacred to us as the last rights would be to you and what he's saying is just as sacred to us to have somebody come and lay hands on the sick knowing that God made a promise that they will recover no matter what the situation is no matter what the condition is they will recover Hallelujah he said he says uh he says uh uh no it isn't it that is it's just uh just scared scared to us he says just a secret to us that's the last rice would be to you well I I out talked him so he went up and dressed me up over in white and put a big thing over face I couldn't hardly see where I was going here I come through there with a a gown Dragon way behind me you have never known me then I walked through there it was all right there was there was one way of getting they said there was one way of getting there and that's following the rules I like that how the prophets say that you know now now understand he knew that if God would give him the ability to walk in and pray for that boy he felt that he had enough faith that the boy would get well not only that I got enough faith that I will not con contract the disease and I also got faith that I won't take it back home to my children Hallelujah now he was saying he probably said I don't need this soup but he said if that's the only way I can get in I'mma just follow the rules some of us need to stop sometimes and just follow the rules all right amen stop complaining and fussing and fight with people just follow the rules you still don't get the job done but follow the rules look look at what he says here now it says um uh uh there was there was one way of getting there that's following the rules always play the game square and you'll win so I went down through there and the mother and father went along they're laid the board dying being unconscious two days I went around I tried to talk to him he wouldn't talk so I knelt down looked at the father he looked at me the tears was in his eyes I laid my hands upon the boy I said dear heavenly father you said I am the resurrection in life you was the one who promised us these things and it's and and the father and this father of this child has called me here to pray believing that you sent me to pray for the sin and this uh father prayed with all my heart the prayer faith that that that would touch your garment and with unfailing and unfailing Faith as far as I know in my heart I believe for this young man to recover I said I asked this and Jesus Jesus name amen and brother random say he raised up now brother Ram say pretty much I prayed and I just raised up right he says oh Father looked over to the mother and said oh mother isn't it wonderful now they haven't seen anything they haven't felt anything they haven't heard anything but just the word of prayer that was offered and the father began to testify he says oh mother looked over to the uh the 000 father looked over to another said oh mother isn't it wonderful the boy is just as gone as he ever was he said oh I'm so happy it says in the little nurse standing there weeping she turned around she said sir I don't understand said do you know your boy is a dying he said no ma'am I don't see he says where you well now you see said he said my boy is not dying my boy is going to live Hallelujah say God promised it say well look it's good to have faith she said look at this now but said I tell you she said some kind of a cardiogram or Emma what they was doing some kind of machine they put on his heart and said when it ever goes down like that it's never been known in all medical history for it to ever come back again said the boy can't live over about uh three to four hours and that old man I will never forget he put his hand upon the shoulder that little young lady probably in her late teens he said sister dear she said you're looking to that machine that's all you got to look to amen but I'm looking at a Divine promise Hallelujah I'm not looking at my bank account and I'm looking at a Divine promise come on somebody I'm not looking at what I'm limited to look at I'm looking at a Divine promise Hallelujah no matter what the doctors have said look to God's to find promises says I'm looking at a Divine promise amen the next morning the boy took his breakfast and he's married and got children I got a child now see the woman all she knew was to do just but look at me what the machine said but this old man looked Faith Pierce beyond that that's why I was saying we got a sixth sense here church amen we got something that other people do not have we can see things that other people can't see so we're not just taking a risk we stepping out on faith we use in the sense that God gave us somebody say uh brother Jack that don't make no sense according right you're right because you limited to your five senses but when you got a sixth sense and only Christians have this when you have that then then it does make sense look at this let's go on he says this uh but this old man Faith Pierce beyond that and he saw God was able to do the exceeding I love this I had to just read it to you he saw God was able to do the exceedingly abundantly The God Who had promised never to fail uh to fail us or leave us or forsake us depends on what you're looking at the Christian looks at things they don't see because they walk by faith is that right we believe it because the Bible said so they believe it you said I believe you said glory to God is done amen that's how we believe is because God said so Faith tested Faith Trot it proves out a hundred percent God's Amber God is under obligation to answer that faith man I tell you when he told Peter to come out down the water he was under obligation to make sure competed in sync you want to know why Peter can't sing because I told you to come I'm the one told you to come so you can't sink hey man you can't fail on my word you understand that church we cannot fail when we're standing on the word of God amen we might not see this and we might not see that it ain't got nothing to do but we do see a promise I'm the Lord thy God and I supply all your needs and you know it's according to I love this it's not according to Wells Fargo it's not according to PNC it's not according to the credit union amen but it's according to my riches in glory that's the God we serve risk and reward this is something that we we're kind of face in in everyday life uh I was just as I was meditating on this thought you know just a little thing came to me even if someone had to decide on a surgery whether to to to to to to take the doctor's advice on on having surgery amen are not having surgery you take a risk either way you know because there's not one doctor that'll tell you it's a 100 chance they can always say something like it's 50 50. oh it might be 40 60. amen they they they don't have anything that's guaranteed but we do have something that's guaranteed this is the word of God it's guaranteed we can rest we can rest our weight on the Promises of God Hallelujah whatever God spoke to us we can rest on that but even if you decide say whether I take surgery or not take some it's a risk amen and and I'm gonna tell you sometimes the only way if you're facing a surgery the only way you can get peace is not by what the doctor says it's by what God speaks to you when God speaks to your heart it gives you peace and when you have peace you're no longer at risk when you have peace you're no longer at risk you're now at rest when God speaks to you he takes you from amen this this this feeling of rich but now he gives you peace and and now you have rest that you know God's gonna bring you through no matter what it's not the doctor that's doing the surgery anyway it's God Amen anointing the doctor Hallelujah glory to God I was also thinking if infidelity ever occurs in a in a marriage and confessions have to be made uh there's a great risk sometimes in sharing the information that needs to be shared there's a great risk because you don't know if your spouse Gonna Leave You don't know what they're going to do after you share but I can take as much the reward and this is spiritual liberation amen and not only spiritual Liberation but it's it's the miracle of experiencing emotional healing hallelujah amen so sometimes we all are faced with things where we have to take a risk but but but but remember this now when you when you when you're walking by faith you actually go beyond just risks amen you're standing on the word of God I was I was just again meditating and it came to my attention the widows of Zarephath um you know when we talk about risk versus reward this woman if we just use that term risk amen she was willing to risk some water come on somebody amen when the prophet approached her and says um you know give me a little drink fetch me some water and give me something to drink you know when that lady heard that this old man she didn't know he was a prophet she didn't know nothing all she knew is that this man made me need something because we are in a drought condition we're in a family condition and don't realize the reason that they're in this famine condition the man that caused the famine is standing at her front gate the man that caused the Trap the man said it won't be no rain until I call for it that man is standing at her front gate she don't realize who's there but but she's she's looking at this old man maybe with whiskers on and this man says you know just just give me some water Hallelujah God has sent him that because the brook had dried up and he said just give me some water and she took off running to go get water for the prophets my God but as she's on the way she heard the prophet say something it said and I bake me a cake as well and bring that to me with that water and at that point in time I think she had reached the limit she couldn't take no more she said now I heard you say water and I had no problem with that but but cake take I'm sorry now I only got just enough meal here Amen to bake a cake for me and my son say I'm gonna let him eat as much as he can and I'm gonna eat and that's gonna be the last of it we gonna die after that he said he say now now I understand that this is your last and I like this God loves to move when when we're in spots like that we're down to our last praise God this is all I've got but this is what I'm gonna give he say he said just just I understand that the dire situation that you said but what I'm gonna ask you to do is bake me a cake first oh hallelujah amen bake me a cake first and say I guarantee if you would bake me a cake first he says your Barrel will not go empty and your Crews will not run dry and he used those famous words and every believer a man loves to hear coming out of the mouth of God he said God said the Lord when that lady heard thus saying the Lord she went and got that cake prepared and gave it to the prophet and now I don't know how God did it but all I do know is that every time she went back to that Barrel there was just enough on the inside for her to make another cake every time she went to that cruise of all there was enough on the inside to make another cake and every day she went back there was more there God will not leave you empty please God I said he won't leave you empty amen it's gonna be more where that came from but be willing to pick God a cake verse she had to take the risks she had to step out on faith before she saw God move on her behalf she had to step out on faith that's what I was just sharing when we gave that fifteen hundred dollars I had to take a step of Faith first and when I made when I took that step of faith I saw God blessed in ways that that go be I mean yes they they threatened to come take the house but I'm still living there I'm still living there and here's what here's what here's here's what I found here's what I found God when I pay my tithes and my offering I'm standing on a promise I I'm I'm on top of a promise as soon as I bring my towels and my offering I'm I'm up there now and I'm standing on Solid Ground praise God anything the devil threw at my way all I do is take the devil back to the promise I didn't make the promise I said I didn't make the promise so I don't have to keep the promise [Music] he's a promise keeper I'm here to tell you that and all I did was step up on the props I just stood there hey praise God he told me if I brought my tires in my offering he said to me I will reputed devour for your sakes and then he said I'll open up the winners of heaven and pour you out blessings when you have room not enough to receive brother I stood on the promise since I stood on my promise and God did exactly what he promised me hey take a step of Faith this is not a risk this is a step of faith [Applause] chanting on the Promises of Christ my king hallelujah hallelujah glory to God thank you Jesus hey you got to be willing to do it Church anybody that ever amounts to anything got to be willing to take a step of faith and if he bids you come he not gonna let you fall why because I told you to come amen if I did you come I'm not gonna let you you ain't you ain't gonna have no negative testimony on me no I ain't gonna let you have a negative testimony on me Peter you're gonna have to get out of keep walking I know you don't took your eyes off of me Peter but you got to keep walking glory to God oh blessed be the name of the Lord hey man that Widow of seraphap took a step of Faith after after she heard thus said the Lord and her reward was that her Barrel did not go empty in her Crews did not fail we were reading amen I told you this whole uh thought came to me as I was reading through uh some devotions amen a cousin of mine brought this devotional book for me for Christmas and and I'm grateful for it amen and as I was reading it I told you in January 4th January 14th they had a devotion on there it says when God asked you to follow him he often doesn't give all the information about what risk about what is happening right away he says when you step out in faith he he gives guidance as you go Moses risks his life by approaching pharaoh and leading the Israelite side of Israel Israelite side of captivity Mary risk her marriage her reputation and her future by becoming the mother of Jesus and I want to say this by yielding to the prophecy of a virgin shall conceive following God's will is not without risk the only thing more risky than trusting God is not trusting him as I've thought about that there's a little a quote that came to me that I want to read to you out of the message the mighty conqueror brother Branham makes this statement in this sermon he says but as they went along the road that morning I can just see them oh my the greatest blow that ever happened to them here they was on the road that left their Church excommunicated for following him they thought surely he would do something uh Triumph there at the grave then they were taken from the church they couldn't return to church anymore and they would be branded mock that laugh that made fun of and that's the way a man does when he really sets out for Christ he has to cut every Shoreline to walk alone with Christ him alone and men and women of this world who have ever amounted to anything are men and women who have predominantly taken Christ for their Savior and stood alone in their decision amen it'll be the same way with every man here this morning or every woman boy a girl if you ever wish to amount to anything go forward with God don't trust your church don't trust your preacher your Rabbi your priest but stand alone in Christ Jesus it's the only way you can do it now when I read that amen I I can I can look around this this audience and I know there's many people that had to take a step of Faith like that hey when when they first told people I'm going to be a part of spirit and Truth Tabernacle or maybe you didn't tell them you they just found out that you was here hello somebody amen because it was risky it was a brand new ministry but 21 years later we still standing it was risky hey I mean CeCe Winans just to sing a song it wasn't easy but it was worth it glory to God you know and I was just sitting back there listening to the song service and you know I'm saying we might be in a school but we still know how to praise him and I'm gonna tell you the environment or the atmosphere that it's created right here in this place is greater than some atmospheres where people have their own building so it's not the building that makes us it's what God has done in our heart that makes us glory to God Amen will praise Him Amen in the corner of a Plaza come on somebody we'll play Praise Him in the course room we're pleasing in the technology room we'll Praise Him in somebody's living room wherever we at we'll Praise Him Blessed Be His holy name we not limited Amen to where we are after how we praise we're not limited Amen brother Tim nothing limits Our Praise glory to God I praise him in my car I praise him in the school I praise him on my child wherever I am I will praise the Lord I will praise the Lord [Applause] no we we're serious about our call hey [Applause] Hallelujah Church [Applause] and you see people worshiping like this when your conditions are the way they are you still worship like this what you really gonna do when God bless you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Glory Glory Glory Glory my God my God my car amen Church many many took a risk many took a risk some of us left some very comfortable situations but took a risk we stepped out on faith I remember a comment that my mama made me made to me years ago and and it just blessed my heart I hold on to it it's very dear to me when Mama first started coming here as a fellowship you know she uh she she made a statement she said I I I said that I think I need to go help the ministry I need to go there and I need to help the ministry and I appreciate that but she said she said but when I got here I realized that I wasn't helping the ministry the ministry is helping me and if the ministry can't help you if the ministry has not helped you and it can't help you you might be in the wrong place and it's not just my Ministry at all these ministers that come up here they should be able to help you know another thing that I just I like to say this you need to know this uh so so I'm a preacher that wants to minister to the whole person we want to minister to your whole being so yeah we're going to talk about your finances so you can get from underneath that curse hello somebody we're gonna talk about you being amen we want to pray for the sick so they can be healed glory to God we we're going to talk about things in your marriage as well and your family we want to talk about that we want to minister to the whole person it was a risk but there's been a great reward and and I I'm talking about I can praise God before before my blessing I can praise him because I know it's been a great can I say it like this if God don't do no more than what he already done he's done enough to deserve my praise [Applause] and you know that I put the word if God because I don't believe I believe God got so much more I believe that I believe he got the exceeding the abundant above all we can ask or even even think amen oh my I'm trying to get back here I wrote in my Bible I put it here you know brother Jacinda had come and preached and he challenged all of us you know write some things down that you want from God and put it inside your Bible and I took it and I stuck it inside the Bible and I left it there and it's been there for a while and uh there are certain things that I put there sometimes I have to go back and add things to the list but I keep it on the word and uh and one of the things I asked God for is not just for church and school but I asked him for a church debt free I asked God for debt free now I don't know how we're gonna get there to debt-free I don't know what God's plan is but I do know this it's gonna be debt free David risks his life and facing Goliath uh and I just love this because David he just couldn't stand to see this uncircumcised Philistine uh stand and defy the armies of the Living God now David was um you know watching over his father's sheep and just so happened this particular day his daddy said I need you to take some food down there to your brothers they're in the battle and and I want you to take some food down there to him and uh and as David is approaching he's seeing all the soldiers take for cover everybody running and David just beginning to wonder like well why is everybody running what's going on daddy say I was in battle but y'all ain't in battle y'all out here running what's going on and David also look up and they see this big giant of a man come out and issue a challenge say now look we don't have to have all this Bloodshed just send one man out here and if you get if you bring one man if I kill him then you all serve us but if he killed me then we'll serve y'all that'll be that'll be the contract that'll be the deal and David looked at the spelling me sorry about it running from him and he's like well what's the reward for somebody that would face this guy he said well you know you're getting married the King's Daughter this will happen now I'm saying well I really I'm not really uh interested in all the rewards but I am interested in not seeing amen the the name of my God defied it says now uh uh who do I need to talk to to go out here so everybody take off from his brother said learn what you're so naughty get out of here go back home to Dad you you're not even a warrior don't cut my hand don't don't don't act like you can do nothing about this so I I'm just kind of I'm kind of tired of this guy you know doing this and David started talking amongst the camp and next thing one of these guys are hearing David talk they're like wait a minute this guy talking different than everybody else and he's not running he's not afraid of him say no I ain't afraid you know what fellas i i i i i i a bear come up one time and got one of my daddy's sheep I went out after that bear because a bear sometimes can be just as tall as a Goliath so not only that there was a lion come up one time and got one of my daddy's sheep and you know I went out after that after that after that line he said and you know what I defeated both the bear and the lion and I think I can take this guy out they say wait wait wait maybe we need to get you in touch with Saul David goes and they introduce him to Saul and Saul said well are we here that you're talking that you want to go out here and face Goliath now you realize this is a great rich young man you could lose your life out here he says he says I'll tell you what I'll tell you what I got some armor that I want to give you why don't you put this armor and you go out there he says look I ain't tried none of this stuff that you're giving me he says but what I do know is that God delivered me from a bear and what I do know is God delivered me from a lion not just me but me and the Sheep I can I can go off my past experiences I know what God has already done and if he did it before praise God he will do it again now David can have this type of confidence and another another word that people use nowadays is God for dance he can have this type of God for dance because he knew what God had already done for the other thing David knew is that he was already the pre-anointed king so there was nothing that could happen that painted on the battlefield until he became king he was willing to take a step of faith he said I'll go face this Goliath and David said I'm not taking your your arm I'm not taking your spear but I'm taking a rock five rocks and a sling that's all I need Hallelujah it look it look look look look ridiculous how you gonna go face a giant praise cop amen when I when I start thinking about this I was preaching to myself at home amen and I can see Goliath coming out to the battlefield Goliath got his sword Goliath got a another man carrying his shield because I've got all this armor on Goliath got his helmet on praise God maybe he got shields on his arms you got to look at him he got his knees covered everything on Goliath is Covenant David got five rocks Amen in a sling there was only one spot and all this Army that Goliath had there was only one spot that was available for a direct blow praise His holy name and that was right in the center of the forehead the forehead is where you holding your Revelation praise His holy name it's where God gives you peace he gives you Revelation right there David took that sling and said look you coming and Define the armies of the Living God but I come to you in the name of the Lord God Goliath say I'm gonna feed your your flesh to the fouls he said we don't see whose flesh you feed praise God he picked up that rock began to sling it Glory he released one rock one Revelation one rock he stood on he threw that rock and hit him right in the center of the head knocked the giant down he didn't need the other four rocks one rock would do it all down goes Goliath but the map the battle wasn't over yet David went over and took his own sword you came with just what I told you who who gonna be fed to and these birds gonna have a lot to eat today took his sword and chopped his head off but he was willing to risk his life it brought encouragement it brought strength to the others when they saw what David did they knew that they could do the same thing somebody's got to be willing to risk something somebody's got to be willing to take a step of faith brother random makes this statement and works his faith Express David with a separate sling expressed the whole Israelite Army the faith that he had in their God now there was Goliath on the other side and he stood out there and made his boasts many times bigger than David he had fingers 14 inches long and he was a mammoth big fella the Philistine Giant and here was David the smallest one he was even too little to be in the army a man too much of a runt they couldn't use him so his brothers was out there in the Army and then Goliath was making his boasts but David now remember it was revealed to David he thought here's the armies of the Living God standing in their own land and there's a boasting uncircumcised Philistine out there we'll call him cancer tonight we'll call him paralytic that's that uncircumcised philistine praise God we'll call them stroke he's a liar praise God and everything must be reversed in the name of Jesus it says why David was no kind of a match for him not with any kind of a weapon he was no match that man's shoulder was probably 10 12 foot across he was probably standing 14 15 foot high a spear like a Weaver's needed probably 20 foot low the blade on it maybe four foot across and Little David standing there with a little piece of leather goat skin or sheepskin with two pieces of string tied to it uh he says but it was revealed to him Revelation struck him amen he said the god that took me out of the palms of the bear that took me out of the poison lion how much more will he deliver that uncircumcised Philistine in my hand amen we got to remember what God has already brought us from If He Did It Before He will do it again he's the same yesterday the day and forever the next uh uh uh devotion on January 15th it said no great things happen without some risks nor risked his reputation by believing that God would flood the Earth as he said he would Abraham left his home and Country to go where God sent him those who walk close to God have evidence based on their past experiences that God is real and active in the lives of those who love him and look at this this statement God loves to accomplish The Impossible in the lives of his people that was in my devotion God loves to accomplish The Impossible move the immovable break the unbreakable come on Church he'll do the impossible he lost accomplished The Impossible in the lives of his people they said take him up on it and I thought about this scripture amen uh second chronicles 16 starting at verse 7. amen God loves accomplished The Impossible in the lives of people amen second chronicles 16 verse 7 let's start there the Bible says this and at that time Hannah and I The Seer came to ASA king of Judah this is the prophet coming to the king and said to him because thou has relied on the king of Syria oh my and not relied on the Lord thy God therefore is the host of the king of fear escaped out of our hand so when they were getting ready to go to battle what he did was go out and hire amen another Army to try to come and help them out and he was relying on the strength of this other Army amen we got to learn to rely on the strength of God we all do our part but God is up to God to do everything you know what whatever you give God got to give it to you to be able to give it's God that got to bring it all together hallelujah hallelujah he said that the the king of Syria escaped out of her hand were not the Ethiopians he reminded him of some things that God had already brought him through were not the Ethiopians and the lubens are a huge hosts with very many cherished and Horsemen yet because thou this rely on on the Lord he delivered them into thine hand watch this watch this this one of my favorite verses for the eyes of the Lord run come on hear me walking running for the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole Earth to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him oh I like that here and there are some fools and therefore from his foot Thou shalt have wars I like that the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth to show himself strong in the behalf of Demo's heart is perfect for him that means god is looking for something to get involved with do you have a situation do you have a circumstance God is looking he's running here and he's running there looking for somewhere to get involved in something because when he gets involved it only brings him more Glory and when I read scriptures like that there's an old song that comes to mind somebody needs a lord come by here hey somebody needs you Lord I'm talking about in West Palm Beach come by here hey somebody needs your love at Spirit and Truth Tabernacle come by here oh [Music] the Bible says that you run to and fro throughout the whole earth are we on the Earth do we have a need where God is coming to get involved and when he shows up the miraculous things begin to happen see I told you I'm standing on the words and when I'm standing the word the devil ain't got a chance then because I know I'm standing on Solid Ground oh how I thank God the next one January 16th the devotion said used to be ready to risk resources what was the woman the Widow of Zarephath willing to risk her resources all I got is just a little I mean the water was no problem I I I you know I give some water but my my last cake my last one you should you should ask God thus saith the Lord if you will bake me a cake first Earth you won't die yes son now he didn't tell them that but he knew this that if she if if he and she were able to eat it would sustain them and they wouldn't die you don't even have to think about death no more sister praise God if you just bake me a cake first she was willing to risk her resources the devotion said you should be ready to risk resources reputation and even some relationships in order to be faithful to God Joshua and Caleb unlike the other spies were willing to risk everything because they trusted God's promises more than their human fears can I just Camp there just for a little bit everybody going I mean it's 12 of us chosen to go and just spell uh spout the land and y'all heard brother Quinton talk about that last week it's a few spies went in you got to understand there's a lot being said in that statement because if they spies from us then they're still part of us I don't know I hope you get that if if you left us then you're still part of us look this word ain't gonna let you go I don't care where you go this word will not release you so somewhere down the line we'll see him again but here the spies run off into the land and and and just to be selected as a spy was a great honor but here they go into the land and and they partaking of eating of the grapes they they see it flowing with milk and honey they they I mean they're carrying the grapes on their shoulders the two men got to care Oh cluster by themselves it's just it's just it's just Rich it's abundant I mean they see Otis they partake in of it but when they got back to the camp they share all the good news and at the end of sharing all the good news they put a butt but there are giants in the land and uh we look like grasshoppers amen compared to these these guys here we we probably better not go up and do that and Joshua and Caleb my God had a different spirit Joshua and Caleb said nah nah nah wait a minute God made us a promise he told us that we were going to have a promised land did not he bring us out of Egypt didn't I tell him open up the Red Sea did not y'all see Pharaoh's Army drowning it why are we scared now if God made the promise he's going to cast all the way through the Bible say they steal the people because they took him back to the word they still to be and the people stopped picked up Stones ready to try to crush the testimony but I'll tell you what if God is for you who can be against you and because of the people's unbelief it stop them from actually experiencing the promised land but Joshua and Caleb because of their holy following the Lord they went in and got they promised amen yesterday I was picking up some groceries amen my wife had you know and I'm I'm reaching out there and I had a smoothie in one hand and groceries in the other hand and Marshall you got all that I said yeah yeah I got it I got it I got it and she said she say uh you she'll say yeah I got I say I'm just as strong now as I was the first day I crossed Jordan she said all right Caleb but you gotta know who you are you got to know the promise that God Made You and Caleb knew that God made him a promise and and and even even God gave him not just the promise of of of of the land but he also got an extra promise that he was going to get he brung because he believed that take that land I'm gonna tell you something if you just take a a step of faith God might have a little extra for you that that you don't know about and it was at 45 years later when Caleb said you're not now look I'm just as strong as I was when when I when we crossed Jordan and you know and I knew we was going to get this land I I told him that 45 years ago but I ain't just satisfied just being in the land give me this mountain not just any mountain this mountain and Hebron was a very special Mountain but give me this mountain my God he got everything that he wanted and more because he was willing to take a step of faith in this message Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever brother random makes this uh statement oh and I forgot to read the rest of that um God already promised his rights to land all they had to do was take it God has made many promises and worked for his people will you take the risk of moving ahead and claiming them or will you lose heart and Mr blessing God has in store for you hearing the message Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever brother Brandon makes a statement look I want to say something to you there were some lepers at the gate one time at Samaria when it was besieged by the syrians they said why do we sit here till we die they were starving to death they was eating one another's children right in the city uh they they said if we sat here we die if we go in the city we die so if the only hope that we have is go down to the Samaritans if they save us we live but if they kill us we die whatever we're whatever we're going to die anyhow right so let's take a chance a risk let's take a chance on going down do you know the story a man amen and if you don't know the story let me just explain it to you when these boys took the took the risk to go down into amen the camp of the syrians amen they do say if we go back in the city they're gonna kill us we sit out here we're going to die if we go down there to the enemies Camp they might kill us wherever we go we might die so we might as well just try to take a chance and go down here to the camp of the enemy they got up four boys just began to walk glory to God towards the camp of the enemy and as they begin to step forward God got inside of their steps and it sounded like a great Army was coming rather than four men coming the Army sounds so great that the series got up from there they say they don't hire people against us and we got to get out of here right now they left all this stuff God had extra blessing for they left all these stuff they left their money they let their food they love their jewelry they love everything because God got in the steps of somebody that was willing to take a step of faith and in one day's time Israel went from being in famine to being in an abundance well that should tell you that it don't take God long to move one day's time we can go from famine to abundance but we have to First Take A oh yeah [Applause] God bless them they got so much they were sitting there eating and hiding eating and hiding like then they said look we done we done we're doing wrong we're doing wrong we gotta go tell somebody that this stuff is here we gotta go tell them and they went back into the City and the city they said now we can't believe that we can't believe it and the prophet of death spoke like the day before what was going to happen and after and one guy said if that happened you know I don't know it's prophecy I'll tell you what since you doubt it since you doubt it but you're going to hear about it but you won't be able to partake of it and when they come to the port and he went telling everybody that man got trampled in the streets and was not able to he died in the streets but it's because he failed to believe and not just believe let me tell you let me go a little further be careful what you say don't say the wrong thing don't say the wrong thing and well I'm just speaking the truth who's truth whose truth are you speaking because what you're saying is not my truth it might be doubt that you're releasing so just be careful what you say Hallelujah but that man said the wrong thing and he ended up dying in the streets and and they went down there and they realized man all this stuff to armies are left us and we're sitting up here with no no this and know that no all we had to do is take a step of faith God got in their steps but somebody got to be willing to take the risks let's keep reading let's keep reading glory to God he says this you know the story and they never only saved themselves but God rewarded them risk reward God rewarded them with that Faith until they saved the whole city of Samaria now you're sitting in the same place they that they said many of you along here in this uh cripples and afflictions laying on the on these cops and things here see you're in the same place you're not expected to go to the camp of the enemy but you're invited to the home of your father tonight to come and believe with a Christ with a bloody atonement laying there before the father tonight to make good your confession in him Jesus says to the right hand of God to make intercessions upon your confession you've got to accept it believe it and confess it uh confess it so to make it an Act of Faith believe it uh accept it believe it confess it confess it so let me get that right you got to accept it believe it and confess it so to make it an Act of Faith you said I believe you said it's done you got to accept it believe it and confess it so we're getting a new church in school I'm accepting that I believe it and I'm confessing it amen amen if I want to make it an Act of Faith I got to say those debt-free that's right we're getting a new church a new school debt free we'll just keep adding things to it you know why because I got ass he doesn't subtract you gotta accept it believe it confess it so to make it an act of faith if you'll do that the doctor's done all he can do everything else has done all they can do you too sister and you too young man and you all that can be done is already done there's nothing can be done out in in Medical Aid well if they've done all they can do then there's only one hope left for you and that's in Jesus Christ take it believe it hold on to it say if God God if others can if others can I can too if another church we just heard a few weeks ago they paid a thousand dollars for they they if they can get a blessing we can too and we heard we read it in the word that you're going to and fro we heard you was in Kansas and we heard what you did in Kansas this is Florida praise God this is West Palm Beach this where you placed us but you're looking for something we got something for you there's only one hope left for you that's in Jesus Christ take it believe it hold on to it say if God God of you others can I can too and you're my God the same as you were theirs I thank God for this there's many a man in Scripture that we could go back to and just look at and and some and and and and what I was I would call a uh a negative comparison one of those is Eve she took a risk Eve wrists by eating from the the tree of knowledge Good and Evil rather than eating from the Tree of Life she ate from the knowledge from the Tree of knowledge Good and Evil and It produced a reward God told him that the day that they did that it they would die and the producer what she got was the multiplication of sorrow in her conception she would bring forth children through Labor and she also lost the the ability of being co-equal with her husband Eve lost a lot when she when she doubted the word of God after after the fall after the fall her husband was supposed to be ruler over her Eve lost that ability to be co-equal after the fall she took a risk she was rewarded with negative things if you take the wrong risk you'll get rewarded with negative things another a man that we can look at um here my so many others let me just kind of uh throw this one Samson took a risk by sharing his secrets of his strength with Delilah thinking that she was just playing when when she was you know Samson the Philistines are pumped thee and now now he looked around he saw them Philistines there but he kept going back and laying in her lap he took a risk every time he went down to Delilah's house he was taking a risk just to get married to Amen to try to get married to a man of philistine that was a big risk any Young Brother young sister that might think about marriage somebody that's not a Christian you're taking a great risk and you'll be rewarded you'll be rewarded for it too let me tell you and it won't be a reward that you will enjoy don't take that type of risk wait for God to send you somebody let me tell you something you you live better single without having somebody like that but don't take the risks Samson kept taking a risk going down here to this lady house going down and see Samson tell me what the stream where your strength is oh it's here and it's there uh Samson the Philistines upon you look around and bust out of it and they said these guys will never get me well he kept going kept going finally Samson and she just threw the tears on him Samson you didn't lie to me I thought you loved me since I can't believe you make me look you make me so embarrassed in front of my own people you just dissing you that and I thought you loved me you wanted me to be your wife how can you treat me like this finally some I mean it just it just kept bringing them lower and Lord say you know what here it is the secret is if you cut my hair if you take if you take a man say that I had a covenant with God but if you take that Covenant away take my hair then I'll be just like any other man here's why he's laying down sleeping she gets the Clippers out cuts his hair and then she tapped some Samson Phyllis finds her opinion he jump up like he always did but this time no strength his God that left him took him and put him in bondage and man they treated him so bad took his eyes out they were so so I mean they say we finally got this fella you know I mean he he done killed my dad and he killed your daddy too he did yeah he get my uncle he get he done did so much we gonna take care of this guy right now and they're coming they had they had they made sport the Bible said he made sport they had a banquet around this guy Samson being led by a little boy can't see anymore anybody can do whatever they want to do to him he can't do nothing but in that condition had one thing that he could do and if you're a young man a young woman find yourself in the same condition as Samson there is one thing that you can do and here's the thing the thing that you do proves that God never left you even in all your failures and all your mistakes he never left you Samson say Lord I know I did wrong I did this wrong and I did he began to repent before God he said God I did all this and I know I was born I was placed on this Earth to destroy Philistines and look at what they're doing to me God I don't deserve to live I failed you God but I got one prayer one one prayer once more Lord if you would allow the script to come back in God I I promise I'll die with these Philistines and there's Samson say say total that lead me to the pillars where where this building is is built on leave me to the building it went running there and say well look at look at them what is he doing over that them pillars what what exception everybody laughing at him but they didn't know why he was praying that prayer say that the brother man will say the shock her hair begin to grow back and as he leaned against the pillars his once more Lord he pushed them pillars and they wonder where did the strength come from it came from a prayer God showed up again right after prayer and God is quick about it Sam's are beginning to push them pillars the next thing on here come the building down and more Philistines died at Samson's death then died during his lifetime are you willing to die to relationships are you willing to die to friendships are you willing to Die the things that's hindering you from walking closer to God be willing to risk it all just like these disciples they thought that you know what we don't risk it all and what have we got look not only not only when you risk it all Jesus told say y'all don't even realize what y'all done you know when when judgment come y'all fellas are going to get the opportunity to judge Nations not only that they say anybody anybody ever that forsakes houses good God you forsake brethren you forsake sisters use forsake father you forsake mother you forsake wife you forsake you anybody's ever done anything like that gonna receive of me a hundredfold and you're gonna inherit eternal life you never lose when you place your trust in Jesus it's never a risk it's never a risk when we talking about Jesus I'ma tell you it's a sure Foundation took a risk when they put Moses out in the in the now but they were rewarded she was able to raise her own baby in the house of pharaoh and got paid for raising her own baby that step of Faith paid off if we were to read earlier in that chapter and I'm trying to bring this home in Matthew um 19 were reading it was a story the Rich Young Ruler that it come to the Lord Jesus and he was not willing to risk his riches Jesus say if you want to you know sell everything you got and come follow me he was not willing to risk it now here's the thing and when you brother Branham showed us this clearly when you look at his story in the Book of Luke you know after he turned Jesus down you know what he got richer he was building barns for his riches he didn't even have enough to put he didn't have enough room to put all this stuff he got richer after he rejected Jesus but here's the other thing that happened to him one day this same fella while he's sitting there counting all his money didn't realize that his soul would be required of him and he ended up the Bible say lifted his eyes in hell an unfortunate thing that while he was in hell he was he he saw he saw Abraham and he says you know Father Abraham could you send my uh my somebody to my brothers and tell him not to come to this place they say no no he got the prophets up there if they don't want to hear the prophets they ain't going to hear nobody from he said no no no they were they were listening to somebody that's raised from the dead no they won't and here's the problem that young man when he walked away from Jesus was walking away from a calling that was in his life he risked his calling he risked a lot of things he left a lot of that and he took that calling to hell how many young men are using that calling for the things of the world rather than for God don't take your call into hell that young man risked his calling Jesus knew why he told him come follow me look you're never losing following me he said I just can't give up all my daddy's riches and my mamas I can't do that he's and he turned and walked away he risked it all he lost his life brother Branham makes a statement and a message Investments and I just want to again bring it to close there's this when we talk about risk and reward we're speaking from an investment perspective and what it means it's the possible profit that a particular activity may make in relation to the risk involved in doing it and let me just kind of put it like this I was telling my daughter it's not many things when it comes in your lifetime it doesn't happen often that you get an opportunity to be a part of either purchasing a church or Building a Church and in my lifetime it's only happened this is the second time it's happened for me and the first time amen it happened we were building a church and and it was great risk on a lot of people's part in order to get that church bit but I can look back now every time I walk through them Church doors I can look back at us doing the bricks us doing the roof up doing all the work that we did on that property and every person that has come through them doors that has been blessed all the meetings that I've had in that building we were part of that can I tell you some some of y'all y'all you are sowing seeds for your loved ones some of your loved ones won't come here to this school but you watch and see what happens when you get over there you have to be willing to take the risks there's a risk and a reward hearing the message Investments brother Brandon makes this statement these get rich overnight doesn't um the these get rich overnight doesn't it's a good businessman want fool with it if you got anything you want to invest in get some identified business something that's been proven it keeps this promise it pays off and here's another thing don't keep your money don't keep your money in your pocket now here's the thing here's what God what I what I see God say in that statement God know you got it yeah right don't keep it in your pocket hello somebody don't keep your money in your pocket you'll never get anything somebody will steal from you after a while Yay see you don't want to do that Jesus taught the same thing when you got a talent don't hide it you got to put it to use and when you put it to use it grows see there that this when you make an investment you're getting interest it grows right your investment growth don't you got to put it to use growing now I may be talking the Presbyterian Methodist Baptist in these breakfasts and whatever more you never know who is setting it for you see so remember if you got some Investments something to invest in invested in something that's good something that's real something that's been proven that'll pay off some good reliable identified firm that has been proven to pay off and ain't nothing greater than the kingdom of God I'm telling that right now has been proven to pay off in the past it's got a name behind it you men know that even if you have to take it slower coming up your Dividends are smaller yet I'd rather know all my money I was drawing two percent and and sure to get it then drawing 50 and never get it promise fifty percent see you want to stay with the firm or the business that's got a background has got a name behind it something that's going to pay off and some something that's right I said now this young fellow that we're speaking about this young businessman the Rich Young Ruler says why he was given the opportunity to make an investment in one of the greatest businesses that he could invest that could invest in he was given the opportunity to follow Jesus Christ and what a ridiculous thing that he did what a rational thing this young fellow given this type of an opportunity to invest his soul and his money and whatever he had in the kingdom of God and he turned it down flatly we look at him this morning as this young businessman as a very poor businessman but you couldn't have told him that Jesus couldn't tell him any better this young man failed to take the right risk that risk would sell everything you got come follow me he says no I can't do it he walked away he got richer but his end result his great reward was that in hell he lifted up his eyes God we don't want to be like that the best investment that you'll ever make is giving your heart to Jesus and yeah you're going to risk some things you're going to risk some friendships you're going to risk some relationships you're going to risk you know a lot of things out there in the world at your risk but there's a great reward that great reward is eternal life greater than anything else that you can do is give your heart to Jesus sell out with everything you got God I'm gonna follow you I'm gonna serve you I did it a long time ago and I'm telling right now it has paid off for me I have never regretted the day that I start serving the lord I've never regretted it and I think we got many people here today that feel the same never regret it when they gave God the entire heart everything not just part of me but all of me risk rewards God bless you foreign let's have a word of prayer now turn the service back over to brother Troy father we thank you for your word you've spoken to so many situations and we we know it's your voice that speaks God the most important thing that I want the people to hear today is that they could never lose in giving their entire Hearts to you maybe a young man a young woman that has been in the the the the the lap of Delilah but God I pray uh today that they would hear the voice calling to them they can come out of that situation they don't have to stay there that Lord that you love them God even in the midst of all that that you you care for them you're concerned about them and all they have to do is turn with a heartfelt prayer and you'll prove to them that you've always been there you've never left them neither have you forsaken them God I thank you for the Saints Lord that are with us on this journey of where we are and God we we hear the spirit of the Lord telling us bake a cake first and as we bake that cake then God our crews will not go dry and our Bearer will not be empty thank you for these promises that we can stand on the word of God knowing that what you have spoken it will come to pass so I pray your blessings Lord upon each one and we thank you Lord
