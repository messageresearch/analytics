[58:42] need to do before we go into the word of
[58:44] the Lord on today I need to give you all
[58:48] a quick update a man on on our pledges
[58:51] and that's just a PowerPoint slide it's
[58:55] already I think I already opened up this
[58:57] call of building front update and I just
[58:59] wanted to give you all a quick update
[59:01] and then we will go right into the word
[59:03] at the beginning of the year that we had
[59:06] our meeting and we discussed and voted
[59:09] that we would start you know pledging
[59:12] three years of pledge each person was
[59:15] going to pledge $3,000 each towards the
[59:17] building fund and you know for the next
[59:20] three years and that would allow us
[59:22] enough money to be able to buy our own
[59:25] place a man and I can't wait for the day
[59:28] that we do that my lord I know a man
[59:31] let's give the Lord praise in advance
[59:33] for what a young doing and you know we
[59:38] were I know that the Jesus is coming
[59:41] soon but Wow Amen while we're waiting on
[59:44] them we might as well be busy doing
[59:46] something for praise the Lord so but I
[59:49] just want to give a quick update to
[59:51] things that we talked about there in the
[59:54] meeting one was this building fun and
[59:57] the other was are offering a man and and
[1:00:00] you know we we pay a pretty good chunk
[1:00:05] of change to rent amen this space that's
[1:00:08] good that we can get up and know where
[1:00:10] we go in the church and you know and
[1:00:12] don't have to worry about you know
[1:00:13] nothing
[1:00:15] I thank God for that we you know God has
[1:00:17] been faithful to us for well over 10 or
[1:00:20] 11 years Amen here and if he continues
[1:00:22] to be faithful but I know that he uses
[1:00:25] all of us in order to make this a man
[1:00:28] what it is so we do appreciate
[1:00:30] everybody's offering and everything and
[1:00:32] what we ask is that if we had 35 people
[1:00:36] give $33 a week towards offering a man
[1:00:40] that would take care of our offer again
[1:00:44] a 35 people share the load then it would
[1:00:46] be no big big you might say 35 people
[1:00:49] have to give thirty three dollars and 33
[1:00:50] dollars for offering that's a lot well
[1:00:52] you didn't say that to your gas tank you
[1:00:57] say that to your gas tank and you ain't
[1:00:59] said it to the cable bill
[1:01:01] hello somebody there's a lot of other
[1:01:04] bills in your house that you can say
[1:01:06] that to but when they come to God oh
[1:01:08] that's not mine but we'll provide you
[1:01:10] with everything you've got right now so
[1:01:18] you know sometimes we got to change our
[1:01:20] perspective I mean I'm gonna be honest I
[1:01:22] can't give enough to God I can't give
[1:01:25] enough right and you know they they they
[1:01:28] they used to segment son you came
[1:01:30] because giving the more you give the
[1:01:33] more he gives to you right and and and I
[1:01:37] found that there's some truth to that
[1:01:38] song yes some truth I remember reading a
[1:01:41] story this man he told the Lord he had a
[1:01:44] car and he actually gave his car just
[1:01:46] somebody else he ended up with no car
[1:01:48] and he gave his car to somebody else and
[1:01:51] he went back in the house they pray and
[1:01:52] I say Lord I think I finally did it I I
[1:01:55] think I out gave you I beat you Lord and
[1:01:59] I is there okay said yeah just get my
[1:02:01] car I got nothing that Lord so I think I
[1:02:03] did it and then I got a call as they
[1:02:05] passed I got a helicopter that I want to
[1:02:08] give you
[1:02:12] and when it went when he heard that it's
[1:02:14] okay Lord you got man
[1:02:16] we went from a cop to helicopter you
[1:02:19] came because given please but uh you
[1:02:26] know I just wanted to if you would just
[1:02:29] hit next on that for me please this is
[1:02:31] just a brief update you might have to
[1:02:35] just hit that light switch there for me
[1:02:36] real quick just just so that you all
[1:02:38] know our goal for this year for 2018 our
[1:02:42] goal was to raise a hundred and five
[1:02:44] thousand so far pledged you know as far
[1:02:48] as what came in on the forms that were
[1:02:49] pledged was forty seven thousand three
[1:02:52] hundred twenty-five dollars was pledged
[1:02:54] and and received year-to-date
[1:02:58] is nine thousand one hundred thirty
[1:03:01] eight dollars a 30-cent received
[1:03:03] year-to-date so we started out I think
[1:03:05] the first month by a thousand and then
[1:03:08] the next month we got about another five
[1:03:10] thousand in last month there was another
[1:03:12] twenty nine hundred that came man
[1:03:14] so together we have a nine thousand one
[1:03:17] hundred thirty-eight dollars that has
[1:03:18] been given best as of April 30th all
[1:03:23] right as of April 30th and and then you
[1:03:26] know I told you early in the year we had
[1:03:28] to do a transfer from our building for
[1:03:30] him to our offering to cover our
[1:03:32] expenses and so that leaves us with a
[1:03:34] net of eight thousand seven hundred
[1:03:36] thirty eight dollars and thirty cents
[1:03:38] the one good I mean it's a bunch of good
[1:03:40] things never won it but one thing I want
[1:03:41] to point out is that since I told y'all
[1:03:43] about that transfer we haven't done it
[1:03:44] again I thank God for that
[1:03:47] thank God for that and and the other
[1:03:51] blessing that I see here is that we
[1:03:53] already as far as what was pledged we
[1:03:56] already got 10% actually it's over 10%
[1:03:59] it's actually 10 percent of this pretty
[1:04:01] much this goal right here has already
[1:04:03] come in so I'm grateful for that too
[1:04:05] God is daughters goddess goddess
[1:04:08] and man God is good so we're gonna keep
[1:04:10] moving forward in Jesus name and I want
[1:04:12] to thank all of you all for a man
[1:04:15] participating and amen and those that

[1:13:52] Deuteronomy chapter 30 we're gonna start
[1:13:55] reading at verse 11
[1:14:02] praise the Lord Amen so Deuteronomy
[1:14:06] chapter 30 verse 11 says for this
[1:14:10] commandment which I command thee this
[1:14:13] day it is not hidden from the neither is
[1:14:17] it far off it is not in heaven that thou
[1:14:20] should have stayed go up for us to
[1:14:22] heaven and bring it unto us that we may
[1:14:24] hear it and do it neither is it beyond
[1:14:27] the sea that thou should have say who
[1:14:30] shall go over the sea for us and bring
[1:14:33] it unto us that we may hear it and do it
[1:14:35] but the word is very nice unto thee that
[1:14:38] means it's very close to you the very
[1:14:40] the word is very nice to thee in thy
[1:14:42] mouth and in thy heart that thou mayest
[1:14:44] do it's a man see I have set before thee
[1:14:48] this day life and good and death and
[1:14:51] evil and that I command thee this day to
[1:14:54] love the Lord thy God to walk in his
[1:14:57] ways and to keep his Commandments and
[1:15:00] his statutes and his judgments that thou
[1:15:04] may live and multiply and the LORD thy
[1:15:07] God shall bless thee in the land whither
[1:15:10] thou goest to possess it but if thine
[1:15:13] heart turn away so that thou will not
[1:15:15] hear but shall be drawn away and worship
[1:15:18] other gods and serve them I denounced
[1:15:23] unto you this day that ye shall surely
[1:15:26] perish and that ye shall not prolong
[1:15:28] your days upon the land whither thou
[1:15:30] passes over Jordan to go to possess it I
[1:15:34] call heaven and earth to record this day
[1:15:38] against you that I have set before you
[1:15:41] life and death blessing and cursing
[1:15:46] therefore choose life that both thou and
[1:15:51] thy seed may live that thou mayst love
[1:15:54] the LORD thy God and that thou mayst
[1:15:56] obey his voice and and that thou mayest
[1:16:00] cleave unto him for he is thy life and
[1:16:03] the length of our days that thou mayest
[1:16:05] dwell in the land which the Lord swear
[1:16:07] to that father Abraham to Isaac and to
[1:16:09] Jacob to give them the Lord our blessing
[1:16:11] to the reading of his word let's just
[1:16:13] pray amen
[1:16:14] the word of the Lord today father we
[1:16:16] thank you for this opportunity a man to
[1:16:20] speak your word we thank you for the
[1:16:22] anointing that has been in the sanctuary
[1:16:25] today and Lord you have laid just a
[1:16:27] little thought on my heart today to
[1:16:29] address our youth and lord I pray that
[1:16:32] you would use this for your glory that
[1:16:35] it would strengthen and encourage each
[1:16:37] one of them Lord that's something to be
[1:16:40] said to help them in their journey and
[1:16:42] life and I God we take control over
[1:16:45] every spirit that's against your spirit
[1:16:47] and father may may your spirit now take
[1:16:49] complete control of your every heart and
[1:16:51] every mind we bind the hands of the
[1:16:53] enemy that would try to speak to the
[1:16:55] people while you're trying to speak to
[1:16:56] the people it's in the name of Jesus
[1:16:59] that we pray amen and amen god bless you
[1:17:02] you can be seated a man less some imma
[1:17:07] start just reading a little quote here
[1:17:08] for you and then we will go into a man
[1:17:12] what our thought is for today this is
[1:17:13] coming out of the sermon first and for
[1:17:15] life
[1:17:16] a man thirsting for life look at look at
[1:17:19] this it says let's take a little picture
[1:17:22] like let's let's take a little picture
[1:17:24] like this God the fountain of all life
[1:17:27] and the locals that went out of God that
[1:17:30] brood over the earth and he was brooding
[1:17:32] the word means like mothering or cooing
[1:17:35] amen brooding is it means like mothering
[1:17:38] or cooing the first thing is Hebrew the
[1:17:42] the like the little moist just began to
[1:17:44] come together and a little flower raised
[1:17:46] up God said that's good just keep on
[1:17:49] brooding and the next thing the grass
[1:17:51] and the vegetation comes up that's
[1:17:53] beautiful just keep on brooding then the
[1:17:55] trees came up that's beautiful I said
[1:17:58] God just keep on brooding the birds flew
[1:18:01] from the dust wonderful just keep on
[1:18:03] brooding the animals come from the dust
[1:18:05] keep on moving and the man come from the
[1:18:08] dust God brought man up out of the dust
[1:18:10] of the earth we're told we're made of 16
[1:18:12] elements of the earth potash calcium
[1:18:15] petroleum cosmic like and so forth and
[1:18:18] if we had been brought to this place by
[1:18:20] the grace of God we're not with changing
[1:18:22] amen he's changing the subject we've
[1:18:24] been brought to this place by the grace
[1:18:26] of God and we're free more
[1:18:27] agents to make a choice and if the Holy
[1:18:30] Spirit that brewed us from the earth and
[1:18:33] and starts to Amen brooding to our
[1:18:36] hearts and we accept him and bring back
[1:18:39] to him how much more is he able to raise
[1:18:41] us up in the last days when we got a
[1:18:43] chance to make a choice so it could only
[1:18:47] be through the brooding of the Holy
[1:18:48] Spirit that's how life comes is by the
[1:18:50] Holy Spirit therefore you can only have
[1:18:53] life by the Holy Spirit that's why Jesus
[1:18:55] said except a man be born again he can
[1:18:58] in no wise see the kingdom of God he
[1:19:00] goes on the state is and the psalmist
[1:19:02] saying I loving kindness is better than
[1:19:05] life then I began to think what kind of
[1:19:07] life was he speaking of that that the
[1:19:10] loving kindness of the Father was better
[1:19:11] than life then it come to my mind that
[1:19:14] there's a way that seemeth like it is
[1:19:16] life it is a perverted life my god now
[1:19:21] the devil cannot create nothing God is
[1:19:23] only creator there is and what is
[1:19:25] unrighteousness
[1:19:26] it's righteousness perverted then we
[1:19:29] notice that there's a perversion of
[1:19:30] righteousness that makes unrighteousness
[1:19:32] it's not original that's not right the
[1:19:35] original is it is right therefore God
[1:19:38] had no beginning it has no ending and if
[1:19:41] we become part of God we can no more
[1:19:43] diving God can die because we got his
[1:19:45] life in us by the new birth and we're
[1:19:47] just as eternal as God is eternal we
[1:19:49] cannot perish jesus said he that heareth
[1:19:51] my words believeth on him that sent me
[1:19:53] he that sent me hath eternal life to
[1:19:56] never come into judgment but has passed
[1:19:57] from death to life now the statement
[1:19:59] that that I'm really focusing on there's
[1:20:03] that we a man we have this chance to
[1:20:05] make a choice we have the chance to make
[1:20:08] a choice each one of your young people
[1:20:09] have a chance to make a choice and so
[1:20:12] today I want to talk about make the
[1:20:14] right choice amen make the right choice
[1:20:18] you have the chance to make a choice but
[1:20:22] we want to we're talking about making
[1:20:23] the right choice and as the Prophet was
[1:20:25] talking about how God was just brooding
[1:20:26] and just brooding and brooding and and
[1:20:28] certain things were happening in the
[1:20:30] earth and then that would be good and
[1:20:31] insert things here but that would be
[1:20:32] good you know when the birds come forth
[1:20:34] that would be good when the plants come
[1:20:36] forth that would be good you know our
[1:20:37] life kind of has the same turns there's
[1:20:39] certain things that happen
[1:20:40] like maybe when parents bring us a
[1:20:42] church that is good that is good for the
[1:20:45] parents to bring you to church but but
[1:20:47] the purpose of bringing to the church is
[1:20:49] to put you in an atmosphere that God
[1:20:51] could actually speak to you
[1:20:53] amen and then you can begin to have your
[1:20:55] own personal relationship with the Lord
[1:20:56] Jesus Christ amen the one that made you
[1:20:59] you know there's a purpose for your
[1:21:00] birth right you know there was a purpose
[1:21:03] that help your parents your mom did not
[1:21:05] have a miscarriage and now let me also
[1:21:08] tell you this you are not a mistake I
[1:21:10] don't care how you got here I don't care
[1:21:12] what your situation or circumstance is
[1:21:15] you're not in a state you are a fault
[1:21:17] that was in God's mind that had to be
[1:21:20] expressed at this very moment a man you
[1:21:23] you could not come at any other day but
[1:21:25] this thing and it seemed like this day
[1:21:27] is the worst day that any young person
[1:21:29] could live but God shows for you to live
[1:21:32] in this hour hallelujah I'd like to say
[1:21:35] it like this God had more confidence
[1:21:36] than you than he had in me because he
[1:21:40] put you here now and he put me in a day
[1:21:43] ahead of you
[1:21:44] oh my think about it God got a lot of
[1:21:47] confidence in you so we want to talk
[1:21:49] about making the right choice
[1:21:50] another thing choice is a great thing
[1:21:53] this is a statement a couple sickness at
[1:21:55] the Prophet Mason choice is a great
[1:21:57] thing there's an unwritten law among us
[1:22:00] of choosing and other good things that
[1:22:03] you as an individual you have the right
[1:22:05] to choose right and and the other thing
[1:22:09] I want you to leave here a man with this
[1:22:11] mourners that after you've made a choice
[1:22:14] after you've made a choice it is you and
[1:22:18] only you that have to live with the
[1:22:21] results of your decision right the
[1:22:24] choices that I've made I have to live
[1:22:26] with my choices amen and you can't run
[1:22:29] from that you have to embrace that you
[1:22:31] have to accept that you have to live
[1:22:33] with that the other thing I want to tell
[1:22:34] you that the choices that you young
[1:22:36] people are making right now are the
[1:22:39] choices that will impact not only you
[1:22:41] for your future but your children the
[1:22:44] choices that you're making right now you
[1:22:46] know when your parents made a choice to
[1:22:47] bring you to this church they knew it
[1:22:49] would have an impact in your life
[1:22:52] we're down the line so the choices that
[1:22:54] you make now one day will have an impact
[1:22:56] on those that you bring forth into this
[1:23:00] earth think about the choice and that's
[1:23:03] why I want to encourage you please make
[1:23:04] the right choice make the right choice
[1:23:08] now let's go on here a little bit a man
[1:23:11] and let's kind of talk about this
[1:23:13] there's there's there's some things that
[1:23:15] a man you can't choose you absolutely
[1:23:19] cannot choose they just they just given
[1:23:21] to you a man one of those a man is your
[1:23:24] genetic makeup you can't decide I know
[1:23:28] people trying to have all kind of
[1:23:30] surgeries and stuff nowadays to the
[1:23:32] change what they look like right there
[1:23:35] but we talk about the original right you
[1:23:38] can choose how you look God's just
[1:23:41] nature the way that he made you and I
[1:23:43] want to tell you that you are
[1:23:44] specifically designed by Almighty God's
[1:23:49] hand crafted right no matter what
[1:23:53] subject your genetic make that you are
[1:23:55] handcrafted you have made the way God
[1:23:58] want you to be late and you need to take
[1:24:00] joy in that because God don't make junk
[1:24:04] and they all start don't make mistakes
[1:24:10] God is a perfect God right you can you
[1:24:14] can choose your genetic makeup and the
[1:24:16] other thing is that you can choose how
[1:24:18] tall you're gonna be a house short
[1:24:20] you're gonna be you can't choose that
[1:24:23] hallelujah and then one of the other
[1:24:25] things you can choose is your family you
[1:24:31] know you can choose your mama you can
[1:24:34] choose your daddy you can choose
[1:24:37] anything that God gave you the ones that
[1:24:39] he gave you because he knew there was
[1:24:41] purpose behind that now sometimes you
[1:24:44] get to an age where you don't want to
[1:24:46] hear nothing that mom and daddy got to
[1:24:47] say all right but you're connected
[1:24:50] through a blood gene and no matter how
[1:24:53] often you might want to a man I
[1:24:55] disassociate yourself with your family
[1:24:58] you're still connected and I'm gonna
[1:25:00] tell you go through a season where you
[1:25:01] want to get you want to disassociate but
[1:25:03] then it comes another season where you
[1:25:04] like
[1:25:04] I love my people it's the seasons change
[1:25:09] all right so so so you know and parents
[1:25:13] I want to take you out let let them just
[1:25:14] go through this season it'll be all
[1:25:17] right
[1:25:17] right you can't choose you can't choose
[1:25:20] your family you can't you can't choose
[1:25:22] your brother you can't choose your
[1:25:23] sister God made that choice for you he
[1:25:26] just puts you inside of that family can
[1:25:28] we go on a little further hey man there
[1:25:30] are some things that you can choose when
[1:25:32] you're making the right choice there are
[1:25:33] some things you can't choose you can
[1:25:35] choose your friends but when you choose
[1:25:39] your friends I want to tell you please
[1:25:41] make the right choice because the wrong
[1:25:43] parents could put you in situations that
[1:25:45] you never thought that you would ever be
[1:25:47] I remember when I was a young man I had
[1:25:49] a friend I thought he was a friend I
[1:25:51] thought he was a real good friend and
[1:25:53] you know we were we were doing a
[1:25:56] friendly gesture we were walking him
[1:25:58] home Aiden and me and my brother we
[1:25:59] decided to walk this fella home you know
[1:26:01] we didn't want to walk home by stuff so
[1:26:02] we'll walk your home and me and my
[1:26:04] brother walk back you know by you know
[1:26:05] together and as we walk in this fella
[1:26:07] picks up a rock out the side of the
[1:26:10] other side of the road and we look what
[1:26:12] are you gonna do the rock and before you
[1:26:13] know he to launch the rock at a car and
[1:26:16] now he hit that car they was driving at
[1:26:18] a terrific speed he hit that car and you
[1:26:21] know how people love their cause
[1:26:22] right so this he hit the car and when he
[1:26:25] hit the car that car turn and whipped
[1:26:31] around and start coming after the
[1:26:33] non-sena this man just put us in trouble
[1:26:35] when he get home right where he probably
[1:26:38] they go me and my brother gonna be out
[1:26:40] here walking where they hit no clock but
[1:26:43] we not get in trouble for what he did
[1:26:47] choose your friends wisely and and let
[1:26:51] me tell you something else about your
[1:26:52] friendship if you got a friend that
[1:26:53] always agree with you that's probably
[1:26:58] not a friend if they always agree with
[1:27:02] you if y'all I had no disagreements
[1:27:05] because see your friendship is tested
[1:27:07] when you have disagreements when you
[1:27:10] have trials when you have things that
[1:27:12] you know make you don't want to talk to
[1:27:13] each other on the phone no more but your
[1:27:16] friendship is tested and when you can
[1:27:18] pick
[1:27:18] up the phone and still costs that you
[1:27:19] know what she was right I was wrong
[1:27:21] that's true friendship if you ain't got
[1:27:26] friends like that don't worry God would
[1:27:28] give you some just like that so you can
[1:27:32] choose your friends you know what you
[1:27:34] know another thing as you get older now
[1:27:36] right now you don't have this choice
[1:27:37] your parents made this choice for you
[1:27:39] your parents they say now if you live in
[1:27:41] this house you don't go to your gonna
[1:27:42] you're gonna do not go to church when we
[1:27:44] go to church and your parents decide
[1:27:45] what church they gonna go to well when
[1:27:47] you get older you can actually choose
[1:27:49] what church you want to go to can I tell
[1:27:52] you something make the right choice
[1:27:55] because every church is not talking
[1:27:57] about your soul and every Church is not
[1:28:00] concerned about your soul so make the
[1:28:02] right choice when you choose to church
[1:28:04] praise our Lord and man how am i Louie
[1:28:08] amen you know sometimes we choose with
[1:28:10] with ulterior motives right you know I
[1:28:13] go to church well why did you choose
[1:28:16] that church well because they do this
[1:28:17] because we drink coffee we do this we do
[1:28:19] well what about your soul alright what
[1:28:23] about your soul there the other thing is
[1:28:25] is sometimes we do that because we're
[1:28:26] trying to get away from something
[1:28:29] sometimes you need to face it don't run
[1:28:32] from it facing it's better to face it
[1:28:35] hallelujah so you can choose your you
[1:28:38] can choose your church one day you know
[1:28:40] one of your young people and I mean you
[1:28:43] all desire trust that you desire to have
[1:28:45] a spouse you'll get a chance to choose
[1:28:46] your spouse you have to live with your
[1:28:49] choice Amen you you you have the ability
[1:28:53] to choose to say yes or no to trouble
[1:28:55] right you can decide whether you're
[1:28:57] gonna get in trouble not get in trouble
[1:28:59] you can say yes or no you have that you
[1:29:01] have the ability to choose whether you
[1:29:02] don't serve God or not serve Him you
[1:29:05] also have the ability to choose to
[1:29:06] follow God's Word or not follow it right
[1:29:09] these are choices that you can make amen
[1:29:11] you're old enough to make those types of
[1:29:13] choices now choosing again as something
[1:29:17] that has been part of a man human it's
[1:29:21] just been a month from the days of Adam
[1:29:25] and Eve that the power of choice has
[1:29:27] been here right and and God gave them a
[1:29:29] choice in the Garden of Eden and that
[1:29:31] that power of choice
[1:29:32] today you have the same choice to choose
[1:29:34] good or evil this your choice it's not
[1:29:37] it's not mama nobody made you do it
[1:29:40] it's your choice and all I'm telling you
[1:29:42] this morning make the right choice
[1:29:44] now when Adam and Eve they had the
[1:29:45] choice gone home saying I don't even the
[1:29:47] tree of knowledge of good and evil evil
[1:29:49] tree of life you know you eat it at
[1:29:51] right tree of life you'll live forever
[1:29:52] but the day that you eat of the tree of
[1:29:54] knowledge good and evil that day you'll
[1:29:56] die right and they made the choice they
[1:29:59] made a conscious choice that they would
[1:30:01] eat of the tree of knowledge Knievel and
[1:30:03] not that not that they physically died
[1:30:05] on that day but that time sitting in
[1:30:08] right and they would not be able to live
[1:30:10] forever it might have took I don't know
[1:30:12] how nine hundred years later but they
[1:30:13] eventually died and that death came in
[1:30:18] because somebody made a choice and they
[1:30:20] made the wrong choice and when they made
[1:30:22] the wrong choice we all suffer from that
[1:30:24] choice listen let me tell you something
[1:30:26] either people can benefit from your
[1:30:29] choice or people gonna suffer from it
[1:30:32] make the right choice
[1:30:37] Abraham chose to leave the land of error
[1:30:41] and dwell in the plains of Mamre while
[1:30:44] he was there you know leaving the land
[1:30:46] of her he took his his nephew lot with
[1:30:48] him and and they got to a spot where
[1:30:50] there was just oh my just so much
[1:30:53] confrontation and conflict going on over
[1:30:56] the land that they were dwelling in so
[1:30:57] so Abraham told a lot said now look I
[1:30:59] tell you what you choose where you want
[1:31:01] to live and I you take you take you take
[1:31:04] whatever you want and then I take
[1:31:05] whatever is left over and brother madam
[1:31:07] said that's the Christian attitude
[1:31:08] always give your brother the best she
[1:31:12] let him choose and lot chose now I want
[1:31:14] to tell you something lot chose to take
[1:31:16] this land he look down a multi-city say
[1:31:18] boy look at that the city lights just
[1:31:20] look so good to live and they went
[1:31:22] walking amongst the city lights and when
[1:31:24] they got down there amongst the city
[1:31:26] lights a man he didn't realize that
[1:31:28] later on that would impact his check his
[1:31:31] children and impact his wife because
[1:31:33] when they got down there months of city
[1:31:35] lights when God was trying to pull them
[1:31:36] out of the stand that was there in that
[1:31:38] place God tried to pull him out his wife
[1:31:42] she had come been so attached to it
[1:31:44] that it was hard for her to leave and
[1:31:47] and and the angel said now when you go
[1:31:48] down and on turn don't turn and look
[1:31:50] back you turn you you keep going on
[1:31:52] pulling you out for a reason but they
[1:31:53] turn and they look back and she looked
[1:31:55] back and when she looked back she turned
[1:31:56] into a pillar of salt against what she
[1:31:58] made the wrong choice lot didn't realize
[1:32:04] that was going to come later on you
[1:32:06] don't realize sometimes the choices that
[1:32:08] you make now how they're gonna impact
[1:32:09] you later let me tell you something
[1:32:11] always choose right even when it's hard
[1:32:14] to choose right choose it it'll work out
[1:32:18] in the end can I go a little further
[1:32:21] another choice
[1:32:23] a man Ruth chose to go with Naomi and
[1:32:26] you know Ruth Ruth had to leave some
[1:32:29] stuff Ruth had to leave her comfort zone
[1:32:31] Ruth had to leave her family Ruth had to
[1:32:33] leave a number of things but she said
[1:32:36] you know what I'm choosing to go with
[1:32:37] you Naomi I'm gonna I said you're God
[1:32:40] gonna be my god you're people gonna be
[1:32:41] my people and no matter how much I'm
[1:32:44] criticized but I know I'm not I'm not an
[1:32:46] Israelite I don't care nothing about it
[1:32:48] I'm choosing to go with you because she
[1:32:51] made the right choice god bless Ruth to
[1:32:54] Mary bue ass and that Union brought
[1:32:58] forth a menace son old bands over it
[1:33:03] brought forth another son Jesse Jesse
[1:33:06] brought work brought forth brought forth
[1:33:08] a couple sons but the last one who
[1:33:10] happened to be the greatest King that
[1:33:12] ever lived in Israel David all because
[1:33:16] one woman made the right choice
[1:33:21] but it didn't stop with David you know
[1:33:24] in that same lineage is recorded that
[1:33:27] Jesus Christ was born out of that same
[1:33:30] lineage because Ruth made the right
[1:33:34] choice I think she's happy to live with
[1:33:37] her decision
[1:33:41] Moses let's read this in the Bible
[1:33:49] Moses in Hebrews 11 23 through 26 Moses
[1:33:55] made a choice see every generation every
[1:33:59] person is given the ability to make
[1:34:02] choices young people my encouragement to
[1:34:06] use and make the right choice in my
[1:34:09] generation I had to choose whether I was
[1:34:11] going to serve God or not serve Him I
[1:34:12] had to make that choice see it got I
[1:34:17] moved from a man mamama having to make
[1:34:20] me go to church to me wanting to go on
[1:34:23] my own
[1:34:24] even as a young man listen well Hebrews
[1:34:29] 11 verse 23 by faith of Moses when he
[1:34:31] was born was hid three months of his
[1:34:33] parents because they saw he was a proper
[1:34:35] child and they were they were not afraid
[1:34:37] of the Kings commandment by faith Moses
[1:34:40] when he was come to years refused to be
[1:34:42] called the son of Pharaoh's daughter
[1:34:44] Moses had it made y'all Moses had it
[1:34:47] made
[1:34:48] Moses was living in the house of Pharaoh
[1:34:50] and man he didn't have to worry about
[1:34:51] nothing can you imagine maybe Moses just
[1:34:53] sitting there he got servants all around
[1:34:55] him people ran when he get when he get a
[1:34:57] little thirsty somebody bring him
[1:34:58] something to drink he say lemonade they
[1:35:01] come with lemonade all right this ain't
[1:35:03] got enough ice somebody come with some
[1:35:04] ice all right whatever Moses worn it
[1:35:07] that's what Moses had because he was now
[1:35:10] considered the son of Pharaoh the son I
[1:35:12] mean he was the son of the leader of the
[1:35:14] nation but one day Moses made a choice
[1:35:19] it was probably the most difficult
[1:35:20] choice that he ever could make Moses
[1:35:22] made a choice to leave that to actually
[1:35:26] walk away from all attacked I mean not
[1:35:29] only was Moses a man the stomach Pharaoh
[1:35:31] Moses was in line to be the next Pharaoh
[1:35:34] but he made a choice that he will leave
[1:35:36] that and let's look at this let's look
[1:35:38] at this a man according to scripture
[1:35:40] verse 24 says by faith Moses when he was
[1:35:43] come to years refused to be called the
[1:35:45] son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing
[1:35:47] rather to suffer affliction with the
[1:35:51] people of God than to enjoy the
[1:35:53] pleasures of sin for Caesar now I need
[1:35:56] to tell me this just stop there just for
[1:35:58] a second sin is pleasurable
[1:36:02] now you you if you all have not come to
[1:36:05] this yet some of you all probably have
[1:36:07] there's some of you young people that
[1:36:08] the devil will enter is what will entice
[1:36:10] you with all kind of stuff some of y'all
[1:36:12] might might just struggle with lion some
[1:36:15] might struggle with you know I remember
[1:36:17] when I was young I had another friend
[1:36:20] see you gotta choose your friends wisely
[1:36:21] I had a friend I had a friend we went to
[1:36:23] the store and as we're in the store you
[1:36:26] know comic books with big things back in
[1:36:28] that day and and and this friend reached
[1:36:31] over grabbed the little book and stuck
[1:36:33] it in a jacket pocket and and I'm like
[1:36:37] no I never have done that like that I'm
[1:36:40] not used to this type of stuff and I'm
[1:36:42] not gonna do it all right ain't nothing
[1:36:44] just just grab ones and no no I'm not
[1:36:46] doing it now this friend by me being
[1:36:49] associated with them it was absolutely
[1:36:53] possible for me to actually get you know
[1:36:57] get pin with that the penalty the same
[1:37:00] way that they got there because does not
[1:37:02] not now is gonna be hard to explain to
[1:37:05] the police officer it's hard to explain
[1:37:08] to the judge that I just met this person
[1:37:10] I mean you know you know I've some y'all
[1:37:14] got friends or in social media you just
[1:37:17] met them and that is your best man
[1:37:20] hallelujah
[1:37:22] right and they made a ledger to do
[1:37:24] something and you gotta realize Satan
[1:37:27] wants to give you friends just like God
[1:37:30] wants to give you friends but the ones
[1:37:33] that God want to give you you gotta wait
[1:37:35] on him you get a little bit too lonely
[1:37:39] Satan will surprise you with some
[1:37:40] friends that you never thought you could
[1:37:42] have and they will pin some stuff on you
[1:37:44] that you never Oh Lord I thought these
[1:37:46] were friends be careful who you choose
[1:37:51] to be friends with and can I tell you
[1:37:54] something else it's okay to be by
[1:37:55] yourself until God give you a free can I
[1:38:01] say that again it's it's perfectly okay
[1:38:04] to stand alone until God give you a
[1:38:08] friend
[1:38:12] Moses here you know I was standing this
[1:38:18] that some of you all I got I got
[1:38:20] different age groups here some of y'all
[1:38:22] will be tempted in all kind of areas in
[1:38:24] your life
[1:38:26] some of y'all at the age where you know
[1:38:28] everybody around you got a boyfriend or
[1:38:31] girlfriend so you tempted to just do
[1:38:32] whatever you want to do to get a
[1:38:33] boyfriend or girlfriend make the right
[1:38:36] choice some of y'all might get tempted
[1:38:42] with drugs or alcohol somebody might
[1:38:44] present to you now and I'll tell you
[1:38:46] this you know and in my situation
[1:38:48] because we all get whatever it dis gets
[1:38:50] thrown in all of us ain't no ain't no
[1:38:51] sense in lying and Stanley don't happen
[1:38:53] but in my situation it was family
[1:38:55] members that introduced me to things
[1:38:58] like that and you got to make the right
[1:39:01] choice whatever it is always choose
[1:39:07] right see that that's why I read that
[1:39:10] scripture I said before you today life
[1:39:12] and death and and notice what God sent
[1:39:15] God actually told you what to do I'm set
[1:39:19] before you life and death and what God
[1:39:21] say choose life he's telling you what
[1:39:26] choice to me just if you wanted if you
[1:39:28] wanted to be if you want things to be
[1:39:30] easy choose life look at it
[1:39:35] verse 25 again choose a rather subtle
[1:39:39] fiction with the people of God than to
[1:39:41] enjoy the pleasures of sin for seasoned
[1:39:44] esteeming the reproach of Christ greater
[1:39:46] riches than the treasures in Egypt for
[1:39:49] he had respect unto the recompense of
[1:39:51] the reward by faith he forsook Egypt not
[1:39:55] fearing the wrath of the King for he
[1:39:57] endured as seeing him who is invisible a
[1:40:02] man Moses had the ability to make a
[1:40:06] choice I mean here's a man that had he
[1:40:10] had Egypt in his in his possession but
[1:40:13] he chose to leave what he had in Egypt
[1:40:16] and to follow God and the joint God's
[1:40:19] people you know what I had to come to
[1:40:22] that same does
[1:40:22] season one day when I when I chose look
[1:40:24] I'm gonna serve the Lord I'm not going
[1:40:26] to go you know the way a popular ping
[1:40:28] and I have friends that didn't go to
[1:40:30] church when I was coming up I remember
[1:40:33] lord have mercy we bi playing back a
[1:40:35] football and y'all know in the front of
[1:40:38] y'all houses they have weird mailboxes
[1:40:41] you just got this one little strip of
[1:40:42] grass just about this about this wide
[1:40:44] from here to here just this one strip of
[1:40:46] grass and then this was the street so we
[1:40:48] played football in the street and and
[1:40:51] and the rule was touched in the street
[1:40:55] tackle in the grass now when I go back
[1:41:00] and I look at how small that patch of
[1:41:02] grass is I think myself what in the
[1:41:06] world were we doing and we can't wait to
[1:41:09] get somebody in the grass right and we
[1:41:11] push them from the street into the grass
[1:41:13] so we can try to tackle them sometime
[1:41:16] they fall in the street
[1:41:18] but she was in the grass so that's the
[1:41:22] way the devil want to do you that's the
[1:41:26] way the devil want to do you here push
[1:41:28] in and push in to places that you never
[1:41:29] thought you'd go when we used to play
[1:41:31] games like that and I remember the boys
[1:41:33] want to play we have to you know you
[1:41:34] couldn't do it too much of that during
[1:41:36] the during the week because the storm
[1:41:39] was going down and some of y'all don't
[1:41:40] have that rule but in my house when Oh
[1:41:42] Lord
[1:41:43] yeah y'all ever heard a streetlight rule
[1:41:45] and when if a streetlight was coming out
[1:41:49] and Sue sure
[1:41:56] you know you know what that meant you
[1:41:59] better get on home
[1:42:01] don't let my daddy catch you outside
[1:42:03] with me street lights on and sometimes
[1:42:05] you know depending on what time of year
[1:42:07] sometimes a street lights came on little
[1:42:08] early might be 6:30 street lights on
[1:42:10] right then when the Sun you know things
[1:42:13] were changed in it you know it get a
[1:42:14] little later in the day and things like
[1:42:16] that so you might be able to play at
[1:42:17] night but we used to do most of our
[1:42:18] playing on the weekends so I remember
[1:42:20] Sunday I was our thing our parents they
[1:42:23] made the choice for us if you gonna go
[1:42:25] to church you live in this house you go
[1:42:26] into Church and lord have mercy
[1:42:28] we go to church and and soon as churches
[1:42:30] over we couldn't wait to get out there
[1:42:31] and start playing some ball with the
[1:42:32] kids but back in those days we had
[1:42:34] church twice on Sunday Sunday morning
[1:42:39] and Sunday night and and the rule was
[1:42:41] you going to church on Sunday
[1:42:42] it wasn't which service there was both
[1:42:48] services we got church on Sunday you go
[1:42:51] on the church so so you know as we were
[1:42:53] we would we went we would go out then we
[1:42:55] played with the guys we get out there
[1:42:56] and me and my brother know we know for a
[1:42:59] fact that we can't stay here and hang
[1:43:01] with these guys because you know it's a
[1:43:02] certain time that we got the you you
[1:43:05] learn how to tell time quick sometime we
[1:43:08] got to break away from this I don't care
[1:43:09] I could be on my way to touchdown might
[1:43:13] as well drop it cuz I gotta go home
[1:43:15] fellas you know what when I was young I
[1:43:18] hated living like that I hated it but
[1:43:24] today I'm so grateful that my parents
[1:43:27] instilled that in me and shake me and
[1:43:30] mold me into that type of man because it
[1:43:32] made me make a different decision when
[1:43:36] it was a time to make those decisions
[1:43:42] sometimes you have to force ate some
[1:43:45] stuff that you're involved with in order
[1:43:47] to follow Christ but in making the right
[1:43:51] choice I can I can guarantee you this
[1:43:53] morning I can guarantee you that you'll
[1:43:56] never regret the decision you make to
[1:44:00] follow him let's look at this other
[1:44:05] gentleman that was also presented a
[1:44:07] choice you you all have Moses had a
[1:44:11] choice but there's another man here in
[1:44:13] Scripture I like to pick up his story
[1:44:18] he's in Luke 18
[1:44:28] actually you know what he's also found
[1:44:31] in Matthew 19 let's pick him up in
[1:44:33] Matthew 19 and and and The Book of Luke
[1:44:36] Jesus tells of this saying man that made
[1:44:40] a he made the wrong choice Matthew 19
[1:44:47] verse 16
[1:44:54] this man his name the action doesn't
[1:44:59] have a name he just has a title and his
[1:45:02] title and scriptures he's tied up the
[1:45:04] rich young ruler and look at this this
[1:45:09] this man if I could just put it this way
[1:45:11] this this man one day came to church
[1:45:14] just like you're in church and this man
[1:45:17] had the ability to make a choice while
[1:45:19] he was in church but he he made the
[1:45:22] wrong choice look at this says behold
[1:45:25] one came and said unto him good master
[1:45:28] what good thing shall I do that I may
[1:45:30] have eternal life and he said unto him
[1:45:33] why I call this that'll be good there is
[1:45:36] none good but one that is God but if
[1:45:38] thou will enter into life keep the
[1:45:40] commandments that mean follow the Word
[1:45:42] of God right he said that I am which
[1:45:44] Jesus and he said on him which say like
[1:45:48] which Commandments you're talking about
[1:45:49] Jesus said thou should not thou shalt do
[1:45:53] no murder thou shalt not commit adultery
[1:45:55] thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear
[1:45:58] false witness
[1:45:59] you know those Commandments that he's
[1:46:02] giving us this year man you know when
[1:46:04] you even those of you that will get into
[1:46:07] a man relationships and everything like
[1:46:09] that
[1:46:10] you still got choices that you gotta
[1:46:12] make after your marriage you got the
[1:46:14] choice to make to keep your vows you can
[1:46:19] choose to keep them or not keep them but
[1:46:22] it's a choice that you make right you
[1:46:25] know and understand that when we choose
[1:46:27] you know if we choose not to keep our
[1:46:29] vows there are repercussions that come
[1:46:32] from that choice and when we choose to
[1:46:36] keep them there's also some positive
[1:46:38] repercussions that comes from that
[1:46:40] choice see so let's go and says thou
[1:46:42] shalt not steal thou shalt not bear
[1:46:43] false witness don't lie about people
[1:46:45] right tellin things that's not true
[1:46:47] about him say honor thy father and thy
[1:46:50] mother and thou shalt love thy neighbor
[1:46:54] as thyself
[1:46:55] so Jesus giving him Commandments that
[1:46:57] he's supposed to follow and you know
[1:46:59] even today we forget some of these
[1:47:01] Commandments amen
[1:47:03] and can I just put it this way you know
[1:47:05] oftentimes and I know we got some damn
[1:47:08] - I know we got some dads that don't
[1:47:11] even deserve no honor but is there are
[1:47:14] some fathers that do deserve honor and
[1:47:17] we need to learn how to give them their
[1:47:19] due respect cuz they didn't say just
[1:47:22] honor mama it said honor your father and
[1:47:25] your mother you know how young people
[1:47:27] get I can talk better than my mama Oh
[1:47:29] Lord yeah I know I know that you know
[1:47:32] brother branham say here's what happened
[1:47:34] in your life you're born you're
[1:47:37] connected to mama through that umbilical
[1:47:40] cord and everything like them you're
[1:47:42] born and and there's just there's just
[1:47:43] an automatic attachment there and mama
[1:47:46] takes you she's the first one to nurture
[1:47:48] you and she's the first one to teach you
[1:47:49] she's the first one to do this and that
[1:47:50] and she's raising you and doing all kind
[1:47:52] of things but uh but you know at some
[1:47:55] point in time mom might have to kind of
[1:47:56] push you off a little bit too Danny
[1:47:59] because daddy comes with a different
[1:48:01] perspective right he has certain wisdom
[1:48:03] that he brings from some of the things
[1:48:05] that he went through in life
[1:48:06] and he's got he's going to he's going to
[1:48:08] give that to you if you'll accept it
[1:48:10] right and then you know after you say
[1:48:13] say after it goes through Mama and Daddy
[1:48:14] to the event you say you get a teacher
[1:48:16] and that teacher actually starts pouring
[1:48:19] things into you and you know and you
[1:48:21] take that teacher from elementary school
[1:48:23] all the way up through college you have
[1:48:25] a teacher somebody giving you something
[1:48:27] you say but after you finish with all
[1:48:30] that who do you turn to because you got
[1:48:31] to have somebody else to lead you who do
[1:48:34] you turn to then and the kids that were
[1:48:37] sitting there that day and that serve to
[1:48:38] say okay we turn on we turn to Christ he
[1:48:41] said that's it that's the purp that's
[1:48:42] the right choice when you turn you to
[1:48:44] start allowing the Lord Jesus to lead
[1:48:46] you and to guide you and direct you now
[1:48:48] you've made the right choice let me go a
[1:48:53] little further let's look at this man in
[1:48:56] Scripture
[1:48:59] verse 19 says honor thy father and thy
[1:49:03] mother and thou shalt love thy neighbor
[1:49:05] as thyself the young man said to him all
[1:49:08] these things have I kept from my youth
[1:49:09] up what lack I yet he said I've been
[1:49:13] following the commandments I'm doing all
[1:49:15] that but what's the one thing I'm
[1:49:16] lacking jesus said unto him if thou will
[1:49:18] be perfect go and sell that thou hast
[1:49:22] and give to the poor and thou shalt have
[1:49:25] treasure in heaven and come and follow
[1:49:27] me so now he had a choice to me whether
[1:49:30] he was going to obey God's Word by
[1:49:31] selling everything he had give to the
[1:49:33] poor and then come and follow him now
[1:49:35] look at this verse 22 we see the man's
[1:49:38] choice it says but when the young man
[1:49:40] heard that singing he went away
[1:49:44] sorrowful for he had great possessions
[1:49:47] now I want to stop there now and what we
[1:49:49] get here is this man actually made this
[1:49:51] choice that he was not going to do what
[1:49:53] Jesus asked him to do he turned the
[1:49:58] opportunity to follow Christ down and I
[1:50:03] want you to I want you to I want to read
[1:50:05] something to you because after this man
[1:50:07] turned the opportunity to follow Christ
[1:50:09] down I want to tell you according to
[1:50:12] scripture the man got richer he actually
[1:50:16] made more money and he ever made in his
[1:50:18] life after he rejected Christ why do you
[1:50:23] think the devil wanted to want to set
[1:50:24] them up like that the devil tricked you
[1:50:27] and your finances and trick you and you
[1:50:30] know and your accomplishments and all
[1:50:31] these other things and and make you feel
[1:50:33] like you've accomplished something you
[1:50:35] actually missed out on the greatest
[1:50:36] thing that you could ever get and that
[1:50:38] was eternal life oh Jesus I want to read
[1:50:41] something to you this is out of the
[1:50:45] message investments says this rich young
[1:50:47] man said now there's something for you
[1:50:50] businessmen and I have to close notice
[1:50:53] now you'll let this thing deep in your
[1:50:55] hearts by rejecting Jesus it never
[1:50:57] stopped his increase of goods he
[1:51:00] continued on let's follow him a while
[1:51:02] down through the Bible his flow of goods
[1:51:04] got greater and because your business
[1:51:06] picks
[1:51:07] up a little bit don't you never think
[1:51:09] that all the time God's blessing the
[1:51:13] wicked prosper the wicked prosper you
[1:51:19] know he says this man got he got greater
[1:51:22] and he got to a place to her he was so
[1:51:24] great to all of his bars bursting almost
[1:51:27] he had to build new ones now he thought
[1:51:30] he had done the right thing by turning
[1:51:31] down Jesus and not making an investment
[1:51:33] in him he done the right thing because
[1:51:38] in the worldly possessions I'm going to
[1:51:39] say something now in worldly possessions
[1:51:41] he thought he'd done the right thing
[1:51:42] because he had prospered and that's what
[1:51:44] our denominations think because they
[1:51:46] organize themselves and their groups
[1:51:48] become millionaires and billionaires
[1:51:49] they feel that they are it then the
[1:51:53] Bible say there aren't rich and
[1:51:54] increased in goods to this age but don't
[1:51:57] know that your neck it miserable for
[1:51:59] wretched blind and don't even know it
[1:52:01] what a miserable condition men and
[1:52:04] brethren don't make an investment in
[1:52:05] something like that it's bound to perish
[1:52:07] while I'm not making investment and
[1:52:09] something that's proved down through
[1:52:10] that through the Bible and you know the
[1:52:12] text that I got written here we could be
[1:52:14] here tonight still on these texts
[1:52:16] proving through the Bible those who made
[1:52:18] that and and and and who turned it down
[1:52:20] I'm showing you a real investment to
[1:52:22] make put your life your time your money
[1:52:25] your talent put everything you got in
[1:52:27] Christ God guaranteed it
[1:52:30] God guaranteed it to us by raising him
[1:52:32] up again will rise in the last days he
[1:52:35] promised it what more could you look
[1:52:36] forward to tell me any investment you
[1:52:39] can make with pay off like that this
[1:52:41] young man he he turned when he walked
[1:52:44] away from Jesus and and this is this is
[1:52:46] what Luke was actually telling us he
[1:52:48] actually got his barns got so big he
[1:52:51] said you know what I'm done I'm done
[1:52:52] Teddy spawns town I'm gonna make myself
[1:52:53] some bigger barns because I got so much
[1:52:55] stuff I can't accumulate at all well he
[1:52:57] got he got Richard he got it got better
[1:52:59] but also in the Book of Luke it tells
[1:53:01] the same man that got rich that rejected
[1:53:04] Jesus the other thing happened to them
[1:53:05] the Bible says that in hell he lifted up
[1:53:07] his eyes you know why because he made
[1:53:11] the wrong choice he had an opportunity
[1:53:14] to make the right choice but this day he
[1:53:16] chose to make the wrong choice now you
[1:53:18] know I felt compelled in my spirit
[1:53:20] just kind of stopped i got young people
[1:53:22] at different phases of life some of them
[1:53:26] say man when i get 18 when i get 18 when
[1:53:30] you get 18 make the right choice
[1:53:33] sometimes I want when I get 21 when you
[1:53:37] get 21 make the right choice right you
[1:53:41] know we feel we you know that there's so
[1:53:44] many things that we actually feel that
[1:53:46] we need to do that we need to experience
[1:53:48] as young people you know I got to do
[1:53:50] this and I got Satan is the one that
[1:53:52] puts that before you and and and you
[1:53:55] know what second job is he want to get
[1:53:57] you out on a limb and when you're out on
[1:53:59] the limb he gonna cut the limb off on
[1:54:01] you
[1:54:04] that's the way the devil is who would
[1:54:07] serve a boss that loves give his people
[1:54:09] sickness and disease and you know and
[1:54:13] just anything negative that he can find
[1:54:15] that's what he wants to put on you right
[1:54:17] don't don't don't don't make the choice
[1:54:20] to follow Satan make the choice to
[1:54:23] follow God even when it hurts

[1:54:36] got to get out of send me I got some
[1:54:40] friendships that y'all gonna have to let
[1:54:43] go of you know and you let me tell you
[1:54:50] love another little secret that I I did
[1:54:52] when I was younger so Bible say honor
[1:54:55] your father and your mother

[1:54:59] that mean my momma was saved
[1:55:02] Holy Ghost feel saved and see kids can
[1:55:07] watch these things they see parents and

[1:58:09] and in the front booth before you can
[1:58:13] even get through the restaurant all of
[1:58:15] the church people were sitting in the
[1:58:17] front beef booth they have went to
[1:58:18] church that night I was at the prom so
[1:58:22] here they coming from church with their
[1:58:23] church clothes on I'm coming in this is
[1:58:27] a very uncomfortable
[1:58:29] position and I walk in these like Jack
[1:58:31] come on instant no I can't go in there
[1:58:33] Jack what's the Madison no y'all don't
[1:58:35] understand okay it's not okay come on so

[1:58:44] they don't say hello at our church god
[1:58:47] bless you brother Jack and you talk
[1:58:50] about shaking I'm like oh no I mean I'm
[1:58:55] just busted god bless you brother Jack
[1:58:58] oh this said another word that's all
[1:59:01] they had to say that's all they had to
[1:59:03] say and I went on back then to that
[1:59:05] table I couldn't eat I couldn't do
[1:59:07] nothing I was ready for the night to be
[1:59:08] over with God made a way for all right
[1:59:12] he made a way for me to feel something
[1:59:14] that I never want to feel again
[1:59:17] conviction you know what that night I
[1:59:21] made the wrong choice but since that
[1:59:23] night I'm making the choices I'm oh how
[1:59:27] would y'all like to feel if y'all went
[1:59:30] to the prom went out to eat and I was
[1:59:32] sitting in the restaurant god bless you
[1:59:35] especially after hearing a sermon like
[1:59:37] this and I just see you made the right
[1:59:41] choice
[1:59:52] young ladies there are many young ladies
[1:59:58] that leave home going to the prom and
[2:00:02] don't come back the same way they left
[2:00:06] and it's not because we're trying to
[2:00:08] take fun from you but we sold we
[2:00:12] certainly know how the devil will try to
[2:00:14] set you up and put you in a place that
[2:00:16] you never thought that you would be and
[2:00:19] you have to make some compromise and
[2:00:21] decisions don't do that to yourself
[2:00:26] remember I said this young man he made a
[2:00:28] choice one day he left her sorry I'm
[2:00:30] listening to that and this was Jesus
[2:00:33] preaching I ain't listening to that and
[2:00:34] you know what he got richer
[2:00:37] he actually increased in goods but one
[2:00:41] day the Bible said that his uh when he
[2:00:43] died in hell he lifted up his ass so you
[2:00:49] need to think about the choice make the
[2:00:50] right choice let me go on finish this
[2:00:54] this descriptor here Matthew 19 verse 23
[2:01:02] says then said Jesus sometimes disciples
[2:01:04] very loud to him to you that a rich man
[2:01:06] shall hardly enter into the kingdom of
[2:01:08] heaven and again I said to you it is
[2:01:10] easier for a camel to go through the eye
[2:01:11] of a needle than for rich men enter into
[2:01:14] the kingdom of God when his disciples
[2:01:16] heard it they were exceeding amazed
[2:01:18] saying who then can be saved but Jesus
[2:01:22] beheld them and said unto them with man
[2:01:25] this is impossible but with God all
[2:01:27] things are possible
[2:01:29] let me read one last quote here for you
[2:01:34] and this is out of the message by faith
[2:01:36] Moses my heart a man is two young people
[2:01:39] you you you all are presented with the
[2:01:41] ability to make the choice your free
[2:01:44] moral agents your parents can't make you
[2:01:46] all your life you're gonna have to make
[2:01:48] your own decisions at some point in time
[2:01:49] you have to live with those decisions
[2:01:51] and my encouragement I'm putting life
[2:01:54] and I'm
[2:01:55] and death before you please choose life
[2:01:58] make the right choice look at this by
[2:02:01] faith Moses it says there there's a
[2:02:07] choosing and we choose for ourselves we
[2:02:11] choose something that's for our own good
[2:02:13] but Moses chose the afflictions and the
[2:02:16] disgrace that he might walk with the
[2:02:18] people of God think of it now listen
[2:02:20] choose the afflictions of the people of
[2:02:22] God and counted it a greater treasure
[2:02:25] for he endorsed seeing him who was
[2:02:28] invisible now a lot one time had to make
[2:02:30] a choice and and it may be this morning
[2:02:33] that there be men and women sitting here
[2:02:35] that'll make your final choice you are
[2:02:38] today what you are because several years
[2:02:41] ago you chose to be what you are now I
[2:02:44] want to say that again you are today
[2:02:48] what you are because several years ago
[2:02:51] you chose to be what you are now see
[2:02:55] what what he says that tomorrow
[2:02:57] whatever you become tomorrow it'll be
[2:02:59] because of the choice that you made
[2:03:01] today go on it says and you choose now
[2:03:10] will determine what you'll be five years
[2:03:13] from and what you choose now will
[2:03:17] determine what you'll be five years from
[2:03:19] today five years from today you may be a
[2:03:23] missionary five years from today you may
[2:03:26] be a renowned Christian or five years
[2:03:28] from today you may be in hell because
[2:03:34] you made the wrong decision there's a
[2:03:39] lot of folk that start out in church in
[2:03:41] hell right now because they make their
[2:03:45] own choice five years from the day you
[2:03:48] may be cleaning spittoons and a barroom
[2:03:51] that that is that is a that's ashtrays
[2:03:56] alright cleanest Patil's in a barroom
[2:03:58] five years for a day you may be a
[2:04:00] prostitute on the street or you may be a
[2:04:02] man a woman that's a credit to any
[2:04:04] society because of your choice for
[2:04:06] Christ five years from the day you may
[2:04:07] be in glory going in the rap
[2:04:09] because you made your choice today but
[2:04:11] you've got to choose and don't look at
[2:04:14] what you see choose what you see by
[2:04:15] faith that's the only thing that will
[2:04:17] count is what you choose by faith lot as
[2:04:20] he had to make a choice Abraham give a
[2:04:23] lot his choice and God gives you your
[2:04:25] choice
[2:04:25] choose you this day whom will serve in
[2:04:28] the Garden of Eden there was a tree of
[2:04:30] knowledge and a tree of life man was
[2:04:32] given the privilege to choose either one
[2:04:34] he desired and so is it today you're
[2:04:37] given your privilege as a free moral
[2:04:39] agent to choose whatever you want to
[2:04:40] choose my advice is don't look at the
[2:04:43] modern things around you and the
[2:04:44] popularity and the glamour that you
[2:04:47] could be but choose rather by faith him
[2:04:49] that give the promise that someday he
[2:04:51] will come and he will write in all
[2:04:52] wrongs and will give you eternal life
[2:04:54] and raise you up no matter if you take
[2:04:56] the despised way but the Lord few make
[2:04:58] that choice it's not easy to live the
[2:05:01] Christian life that you are living it's
[2:05:02] not easy a man to be called church boy a
[2:05:05] church girl it's not easy I understand
[2:05:07] that but it's a choice that you have to
[2:05:08] make that you know what this is the
[2:05:10] right life to live and the life that
[2:05:12] these others are living is the one that
[2:05:13] I don't want to live you have to make
[2:05:16] that choice let me go on if there is
[2:05:18] trouble in in in the land in the hand if
[2:05:21] there's trouble in the land if there's
[2:05:23] trouble in the church troubles in the
[2:05:24] church if there's trouble in the home no
[2:05:26] matter where it is
[2:05:27] make your choice by faith I'll serve God
[2:05:30] I'll humbled my heart and his presence
[2:05:33] I'll take the way with God's children I
[2:05:35] see them despised and rejected and drove
[2:05:37] out and made fun of but I'll still take
[2:05:40] my post of duty I'll stay right by them
[2:05:42] and when they cry I'll cry with them and
[2:05:45] when they're when their sorrow I shall
[2:05:48] start with them they the way they live
[2:05:50] I'll live like Norma's and Ruth Ruth
[2:05:53] sent an ailment your ways will be my
[2:05:54] ways my ways will be your ways where you
[2:05:57] live I'll live where you go outgo that
[2:05:59] God the God that you serve will be my
[2:06:01] god take that choice though it pulls the
[2:06:04] very skin of your conscience of thinking
[2:06:06] that you're somebody skin your stuff
[2:06:08] down and take your way with the Lord's
[2:06:10] despise for you and stay lawyer on the
[2:06:13] field of service and at the post of duty
[2:06:16] young people I had to take this
[2:06:19] opportunity today just to encourage you
[2:06:21] make the right choice
[2:06:23] you know someday this world is gonna
[2:06:27] come to an end
[2:06:28] and we'll stand before God and we stand
[2:06:32] before God those of you that decided
[2:06:35] that you know what just like the rich
[2:06:37] young ruler I'm gonna reject what Christ
[2:06:39] was saying to me and I'm gonna do it my
[2:06:41] way those of you that decide that you
[2:06:44] know you already know what the end
[2:06:45] result was for the rich young ruler that
[2:06:47] would be your end result as well but
[2:06:50] those of you that say you know what I
[2:06:51] got everything handed to me I mean I
[2:06:53] could be this I could be that but I'm
[2:06:55] gonna choose to suck the afflictions
[2:06:57] with the people got like Moses did and
[2:06:59] watch what God does for you see when you
[2:07:02] stand on the other side and God judges
[2:07:04] us all this moment this day will be
[2:07:08] replayed it's been recorded and now it
[2:07:13] can be replayed not just on YouTube but
[2:07:19] in heaven and I want to tell you I call
[2:07:23] heaven and earth against you today you
[2:07:29] can choose life or death but God
[2:07:34] encourages you choose life choose life
[2:07:40] choose life let's break
[2:07:53] musicians don't worry just stay where
[2:07:55] you're at father just feeling led by
[2:08:05] your spirit to just take a moment and
[2:08:09] deal with the lamps each one here has
[2:08:15] been given the ability to make a choice
[2:08:19] they choose right they choose wrong so
[2:08:24] many so many things that that they know
[2:08:26] are right maybe language that they might
[2:08:29] use they know they wouldn't use it at
[2:08:31] home but yet the enemy is there just
[2:08:34] doing everything bombard them with it
[2:08:37] every day yeah and then they choose to
[2:08:39] just live like some of the other people
[2:08:40] and say some of the words that the other
[2:08:42] safe some are God in a place where maybe
[2:08:51] somebody's trying to pressure them into
[2:08:53] sexual activity they know what's right
[2:08:58] and what's wrong
[2:08:59] and God they they have to make choices
[2:09:02] on on everyday basis somebody might try
[2:09:04] to press them to to get them involved in
[2:09:07] drugs and alcohol so many other things
[2:09:10] out there that they could be involved in
[2:09:12] somebody has to make a choice but today
[2:09:16] Lord they've been given the choice
[2:09:17] they've been given an opportunity to
[2:09:19] follow Christ just the same way that
[2:09:22] rich young ruler was given an
[2:09:24] opportunity to follow Christ I pray that
[2:09:31] they won't reject this
[2:09:33] I pray that they would receive it I also
[2:09:37] pray that some today would come to that
[2:09:39] that spot where they make the right
[2:09:41] choice if they're not serving if they're
[2:09:43] not following if they're not living for
[2:09:44] you that today would be the day that
[2:09:46] they say you know what I made I made the
[2:09:48] right choice I'm following Jesus Lord I
[2:09:57] can only do what I can do just to try to
[2:10:01] reach them and whatever way I can and I
[2:10:05] pray that not one would be lost there's
[2:10:08] a struggle going on the enemy pulling
[2:10:10] left him right and Lord just doing
[2:10:13] everything he can to disrupt the lives
[2:10:16] of young people wants to destroy him
[2:10:22] that's what the Bible said he'd come to
[2:10:24] kill steal and destroy and got my prayer
[2:10:27] is that you will show them that you come
[2:10:32] to give them life and they give life
[2:10:35] more abundantly help them to choose you
[2:10:42] for you are not just the right choice
[2:10:45] but you're the only choice god I pray
[2:10:51] the thing would come to that
[2:10:56] while every head is foul there's a young
[2:11:01] person here today that has heard the
[2:11:04] voice of the Lord to speak to you about
[2:11:06] making the right choice and say brother
[2:11:09] Jack I have not made the right choices
[2:11:11] in the past but today I want to make the
[2:11:14] right choice I want to follow Jesus I
[2:11:17] really want to follow him if that's you
[2:11:22] and God has spoke to your heart just
[2:11:23] lift your hand right where you are and
[2:11:24] I'm not going to embarrass you if you
[2:11:28] say I want to be one of those that
[2:11:30] follow Christ because I haven't done it
[2:11:32] God knows every heart in this place
[2:11:38] and God gives us opportunity after
[2:11:41] opportunity to follow him today is
[2:11:45] another chance that's been given to you
[2:11:47] one day is going to be the last chance
[2:11:53] if the day the Lord has spoke to your
[2:11:55] heart as a brother Jack I'm not doing
[2:11:57] what I'm supposed to be doing I'm not
[2:11:58] following the way that I should be
[2:11:59] following I want you to pray for me

[2:12:16] there's others here's one thing I do
[2:12:17] know is that God don't play games with
[2:12:19] his work but God would stop and say no
[2:12:23] no no no no feed the the lambs feed him
[2:12:26] speak to him God has purpose for that I
[2:12:32] want to tell you something God loves you
[2:12:34] that he would change everything just to
[2:12:37] try to get a word to you but it can't
[2:12:41] force himself and you have to be the one
[2:12:43] to open up and let him in he asks you

[2:12:51] ruler will you follow me will you serve
[2:12:54] me will you love me

[2:13:31] pray to the ones that have lifted their
[2:13:33] hands Jesus that you would do the work

[2:14:04] those hands have going up that they've
[2:14:08] made the choice to follow you God that
[2:14:12] you would give them the peace that
[2:14:14] passeth all understanding their Lord
[2:14:16] that they would know that every sin
[2:14:17] would be washed away that you don't hold
[2:14:20] anything against them and God that you
[2:14:23] would give them the boldness that they
[2:14:24] need to be Christians in this generation
