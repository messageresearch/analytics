[4:35] bit more uh
[4:37] sound in my monotonous here tonight my
[4:39] brother
[4:41] just um just telling sister rebecca that
[4:46] i just wrote a little list of songs of
[4:49] things that i wanted to do to open the
[4:51] service
[4:52] and one of the songs well actually the
[4:54] song she's playing was the first song on
[4:57] my list
[4:58] uh without me ever telling her that uh
[5:01] that that's what i wanted to sing then i
[5:04] showed her the list
[5:05] and uh the second song that i had on my
[5:07] list
[5:08] was the second song she had on her list
[5:11] uh so the holy spirit is already here
[5:15] amen is already here

[5:21] word tells us that wherever two or three
[5:23] are gathered in my name there
[5:25] am i in the midst of him so you know i'd
[5:28] rather have jesus here than have anybody

[5:34] amen i know that he's here and amen
[5:37] let's just enter in tonight as we sing
[5:39] and
[5:40] we get our minds wrapped on easter and
[5:42] what our lord did for us some 2000 years
[5:44] ago when he died on that cross but he
[5:45] didn't stay on the cross
[5:47] he got up out of a grave amen and
[5:49] because he lives we live also amen

[11:25] grateful for that tonight
[11:27] i'm selfish enough to believe that uh if
[11:31] there was nobody else in the world that
[11:33] was willing to receive
[11:35] what christ did he still would have did
[11:37] it just for me

[49:38] up i said yeah well i got something on
[49:39] my heart and
[49:40] i've been working on everything does it
[49:42] pertain to
[49:44] uh uh easter and i say well
[49:47] i thought about it i said well well yeah
[49:51] yeah it can pertain to easter i throw
[49:54] the cross in there
[49:57] i thought across it now but you know i
[50:00] was
[50:01] having some work done to him at my house
[50:02] and and and and uh
[50:04] they put in the shower and and and the
[50:06] guy putting in the shower pin and he got
[50:08] the drain there in the middle
[50:10] amen and he putting the shower pan in
[50:12] and i'm watching him as he do this
[50:14] and he got to slope everything towards
[50:16] the pan
[50:17] he got the slope the left side towards
[50:19] the pan he got a slope the right side
[50:22] towards the center of the drain
[50:24] he got a sloping from the back he got a
[50:26] sloping from the front
[50:27] so that all the water go down the drain
[50:31] see calvary's in the drain that's where
[50:34] when
[50:34] scenes of water was washed away amen
[50:38] and i would say they had having the
[50:39] water goes down the drain
[50:41] so from the old testament to the new
[50:43] testament
[50:44] amen it all goes back to calvary
[50:47] if you preach a message and you can't
[50:49] take it back to calvary you need to
[50:51] check what you're preaching
[50:54] if you can't put calvary in there and
[50:56] find grace in the blood of jesus christ
[50:59] and what you're preaching
[51:00] you need to check it a little bit more
[51:02] because it all flows right back to count
[51:06] amen and it has to be pitched perfectly
[51:09] because if it's not pitched perfectly i
[51:12] had to go back and i tested
[51:13] i said i wait till everything get dry
[51:16] and i went and i turned the water on
[51:18] and me and my wife standing there and we

[51:24] is going
[51:24] everything is going ain't no puddling
[51:27] nowhere where the water's getting cold
[51:30] because see if you get to a place where
[51:32] the water can't go
[51:33] what you got to do you got to hone it
[51:35] down a little bit more
[51:37] hey man you got to hold down your
[51:38] revelation because see something is
[51:41] wrong you're starting to puddle

[53:24] beauty that we should desire him
[53:28] now listen he is despised
[53:31] now this is isaiah saying this
[53:35] he is despised
[53:39] and rejected is despised
[53:43] and rejected of men a
[53:46] man of sorrows and acquainted with grief
[53:52] and we hid as it were our faces
[53:55] from him my god
[53:58] he was despised and was
[54:02] us and we esteemed him not
[54:05] surely he has borne our griefs and
[54:07] carried
[54:09] our sorrows yet we did esteem him
[54:13] stricken smitten of god and afflicted
[54:16] you may be seated you may be seated
[54:20] now everybody go to verse 5 because he
[54:22] was wounded for our transgression
[54:25] and he was bruised for our iniquities
[54:28] and the chastisement of our peace was
[54:30] upon him
[54:30] and by every stripes we heal
[54:34] but i want you to really take a good
[54:35] look at all of that scripture what all
[54:37] that stuff he took to the cross with him

[55:02] pain he took all of that
[55:05] amen he took our grief
[55:10] he took our sorrows
[55:13] he took our oppression the depression
[55:17] people walk away from god because
[55:21] see that you got to understand the
[55:23] tricks of the enemy
[55:27] you got to understand the tricks of the
[55:28] enemy god took
[55:30] all of that all you have to do is have
[55:32] faith and believe now listen

[55:38] the cross have existed but see i'm going
[55:41] to take you somewhere
[55:43] we will be we've been we've been in us
[55:44] we've been in a cycle
[55:47] brother jack came out and he started
[55:48] preaching about the junctions of time
[55:51] amen brother willie just got right under
[55:53] the same anointing we started preaching
[55:54] about the junctions of time
[55:56] amen brother paul came he started
[55:58] talking about that clock

[56:02] but i'm here to let you know tonight
[56:04] amen that what we're going to and what
[56:07] we come from
[56:08] is back to eternity amen right now we're
[56:11] in these
[56:12] junctions we're in a junction of time
[56:15] let me read something from the message
[56:17] perfection amen preached in 1956
[56:22] 06 10 27
[56:26] all right you catch up with me when you
[56:28] can sister
[56:29] now this great chain of perfection was
[56:32] broken by
[56:32] time space amen
[56:36] time came because of sin
[56:39] amen that threw us into these junctions
[56:43] amen but we are not time creatures
[56:48] amen we are creatures of eternity
[56:52] that's why we this time thing just don't
[56:54] work for us
[56:55] i'm not mad at you sometime when all the
[56:58] time the clock go off this that nothing
[57:00] you know what
[57:01] cause we are not creatures of time we
[57:04] have to learn how to overcome
[57:06] you know time is a prison
[57:09] time is a prison we are
[57:13] imprisoned by time amen now sometimes
[57:17] some people are in prison
[57:18] and some people are in solitary
[57:19] confinement that's a prison in a prison
[57:22] all right now talk about it a prison and
[57:25] a prison
[57:26] not only are they in a time prison but
[57:29] then they're in another prison
[57:31] because they don't know who they are
[57:34] when you get into solitary confinement
[57:36] you lose your mind
[57:38] amen you begin to get so isolated amen
[57:41] from other people that your but mind
[57:43] begin to play tricks on
[57:45] you don't know who you are anymore amen
[57:49] but by the grace of god he came and took
[57:51] us out of solitary confinement
[57:53] amen we in general population amen ready
[57:56] to walk out the gates at any time
[57:58] [Music]
[58:01] out of time see when they give you
[58:04] when they give you punishment and put
[58:07] you in prison they give you
[58:08] time they give you
[58:11] time you got a certain amount of time
[58:15] you are imprisoned by the time
[58:21] but you are free you
[58:24] are free in christ jesus you are
[58:27] creatures of
[58:28] eternity you were born to be free
[58:31] you were born to sow like eagles
[58:34] amen amen amen now
[58:38] he says here he say the uh
[58:41] uh let us see this perfect circle
[58:45] he called it a perfect circle forever
[58:47] and ever
[58:48] and then all once sin drop
[58:51] and put a little he says his wife call
[58:53] it a little hickey
[58:55] just this little this little hickey here
[58:57] amen
[58:58] and in that little hickey is seven
[59:00] junctions amen but see he had to do that
[59:03] amen so that he can display his
[59:05] attributes
[59:06] [Music]
[59:08] he had to put us in that prison so he
[59:10] could come and be our lawyer
[59:12] he had to put us in that prison so he
[59:15] can be our advocate
[59:17] because unless we was in their prison
[59:19] amen we never have known
[59:21] the grace of god we would never know
[59:23] just how good he is
[59:25] the prophet said and who is this
[59:27] melchizedek we bypassed our people amen
[59:30] to come here
[59:32] amen in a flesh body amen to be tried
[59:35] and tested
[59:36] what's undetached by brothers and
[59:37] sisters our faith is on the test
[59:40] our faith is being tried and tested but
[59:42] by the revelation of almighty god
[59:45] if we can ever see a man into the unseen
[59:48] realm
[59:49] not looking with the natural eyes but
[59:51] look through the word of god
[59:53] amen we will see amen that god
[59:57] has already taken us into eternity
[1:00:03] amen bear with me
[1:00:08] amen amen he says here
[1:00:11] now time now is a little loop
[1:00:15] it loops down jesus
[1:00:19] was from eternity to eternity
[1:00:23] but he stepped into the time space
[1:00:26] and was made flesh and came through
[1:00:29] here in order to sink
[1:00:32] start in order to sanctify
[1:00:36] or put a streak of blood all across this
[1:00:40] place
[1:00:41] to redeem it and connect it
[1:00:44] back with god again for
[1:00:47] all eternity you see it right
[1:00:50] that's all time is
[1:00:53] then god amen god
[1:00:57] when it started here at the end of the
[1:00:59] little king
[1:01:01] in the perfect circle that made it
[1:01:05] a little king when god started here he
[1:01:08] was
[1:01:08] perfected everything he said
[1:01:11] was perfect everything he does is
[1:01:14] perfect
[1:01:15] so then the bible said that jesus christ
[1:01:17] the lamb
[1:01:18] was slain
[1:01:22] from the beginning of the little kink
[1:01:26] slain from the beginning of the little
[1:01:28] king
[1:01:29] so amen if if if he carried my sorrows
[1:01:35] to the cross he carried them before the
[1:01:38] king
[1:01:39] all right all right they were all see
[1:01:41] listen
[1:01:42] in the brother willie hit this thing i
[1:01:43] was telling him lord you're taking the
[1:01:44] fish out my butt
[1:01:46] in the mind of god you are
[1:01:50] already perfect that's right
[1:01:53] you were perfectly whole you were
[1:01:56] made whole there was no sin the
[1:01:59] the the the god has a sea
[1:02:04] of forgetfulness now when i was
[1:02:06] beginning to study this message i wanted
[1:02:08] to say now
[1:02:08] how can a god who's all perfect
[1:02:11] know all things forget
[1:02:15] good question how can he forget
[1:02:18] and the prophet began to explain the
[1:02:20] thing he said man can't forget but
[1:02:22] god he can forget
[1:02:25] he can forget because see what happened
[1:02:28] you know he took
[1:02:29] our sorrows i just read it here he took
[1:02:32] those things and he
[1:02:33] carried them to the cross and took them
[1:02:35] to hell
[1:02:36] and the bible says in revelation i
[1:02:38] believe it's revelation 20
[1:02:40] i got it written here revelation 20
[1:02:41] verse 5 that death and hell
[1:02:43] are be cast into the lake of fire amen
[1:02:46] and if you go back and read the
[1:02:47] scripture he said it would burn would
[1:02:49] find brimstone forever and ever
[1:02:51] that's not eternity it will have an end
[1:02:54] and when it's in amen it'll be from the
[1:02:57] memory of god
[1:02:58] so my sorrows your sorrows
[1:03:01] he carried the hell hell will be thrown
[1:03:04] into the lake of fire
[1:03:05] my transgressions your transgressions
[1:03:08] my wrongs your wrongs my faults
[1:03:12] your faults are be thrown in to the lake
[1:03:15] of the fire
[1:03:16] with the devil and his false prophets
[1:03:19] amen and to be gone annihilated
[1:03:23] god don't see it you've never done it it
[1:03:26] don't exist
[1:03:27] we're freeing him this week
[1:03:31] so what happened you got these memories
[1:03:35] the devil tried to bring these things up
[1:03:38] try to bring these things up but you
[1:03:40] were all ready
[1:03:42] already free amen because he was a lamb
[1:03:46] slain
[1:03:47] amen before the foundation of the world
[1:03:50] he carried your sorrows
[1:03:52] carried your grace amen your
[1:03:54] disappointments
[1:03:56] all of those things now that's something
[1:03:58] you have to do
[1:03:59] absolutely that's something you have to
[1:04:02] do
[1:04:03] the prophet was talking about here i
[1:04:04] believe in uh what message here message
[1:04:07] perfection
[1:04:08] oh lord god he says
[1:04:12] paragraph 46 now before he ever put
[1:04:16] the printed word this
[1:04:19] is the mind of god here it is
[1:04:23] talking about the word this is the mind
[1:04:26] of god
[1:04:27] that he thought before the foundation of
[1:04:30] the world
[1:04:32] and the world was before the world
[1:04:36] was ever laid it is
[1:04:40] that's the reason amen that's the reason
[1:04:43] he could put it on printed word
[1:04:46] and say that would be because he
[1:04:49] saw it before the foundation of the
[1:04:52] world
[1:04:53] and knew just what it would be
[1:04:56] and spoke it out and then he handed it
[1:04:59] down
[1:05:00] his knowledge to the prophets and they
[1:05:02] wrote it out
[1:05:04] and year by year and century by century
[1:05:07] we see it come to pass just exactly
[1:05:10] god giving a shadow of the old and a
[1:05:13] shadow of the new
[1:05:15] the drain on one side and the drain on
[1:05:18] the other side
[1:05:19] and we see it word by word
[1:05:23] amen being fulfilled with a faith
[1:05:26] we ought to have established in
[1:05:30] god with what a
[1:05:33] faith amen that we ought to have
[1:05:36] established
[1:05:38] in god amen
[1:05:41] now we see a man that in order in order
[1:05:45] look look
[1:05:46] in order to have faith
[1:05:50] true faith in god a lot of people can
[1:05:52] say
[1:05:53] you have faith i have faith we believe
[1:05:56] we have
[1:05:56] faith but unless you have a revelation
[1:05:59] unless you know listen the the the the
[1:06:03] woman with the issue of blood amen
[1:06:07] she had faith the bible said she had
[1:06:09] faith
[1:06:10] he said your faith made you whole but
[1:06:12] she saw
[1:06:13] duke jesus was coming she had spent all
[1:06:16] her money
[1:06:17] she had she had exhausted all of her
[1:06:20] resources
[1:06:22] she hadn't she had a problem she had a
[1:06:25] problem
[1:06:26] that the doctors couldn't solve she had
[1:06:29] a problem
[1:06:30] amen that the lawyer could solve all
[1:06:32] right and she
[1:06:33] heard that jesus was passing
[1:06:37] amen now no doubt weak in a body
[1:06:40] right sick from a loss of
[1:06:44] blood you lose blood you get weak
[1:06:48] little frail lady but she
[1:06:51] pressed her way out oh man
[1:06:55] to be in the presence of god
[1:07:00] she said if i can just i don't have to
[1:07:02] get his attention
[1:07:05] i just need to be in the presence
[1:07:08] now i hope y'all reading between the
[1:07:09] lines
[1:07:11] if i don't even have to get i just if i
[1:07:13] could just be in
[1:07:14] and get close enough so she had to fight
[1:07:19] her way
[1:07:20] amen through a crowd of people that's it
[1:07:23] she had to
[1:07:24] oh and the message in the message
[1:07:28] i got it right here in the message uh
[1:07:31] desperation
[1:07:32] yeah the prophet said you have to press
[1:07:36] into it you can't sit back and be slow
[1:07:39] for
[1:07:40] you can't sit back and be nonchalant
[1:07:43] amen he wants to give it to you he wants
[1:07:46] to give you
[1:07:47] everything that you stand in need of
[1:07:50] he wants to bless you beyond measure
[1:07:53] but he has to see a man that you really
[1:07:57] wanted
[1:07:57] he has to see some desperation out of
[1:08:00] you
[1:08:00] amen this woman with the issue with
[1:08:02] blood because she had the desperation
[1:08:05] and she pressed her way through the
[1:08:07] crowd she see that she couldn't get no
[1:08:09] closer to him
[1:08:10] amen no doubt there was big men amen
[1:08:13] bodyguarding trying to keep people away
[1:08:16] from him
[1:08:17] and protecting him and the people
[1:08:19] pressing just trying to touch him
[1:08:21] all the people touching him she said i
[1:08:23] just got to get down on my knees
[1:08:26] she get down on her knees and she just
[1:08:28] reached
[1:08:32] and touched the hem of his government
[1:08:36] and he said virtue left me
[1:08:40] he said strength left from my body
[1:08:44] why because it wasn't a physical touch
[1:08:48] it was a faith touch and see if your
[1:08:52] faith can touch listen we are given
[1:08:57] five senses
[1:09:01] and in these five senses he's given them
[1:09:04] to us
[1:09:06] to contact in this dimension of time
[1:09:10] yes see touch
[1:09:14] taste feel here hey man
[1:09:18] and we we have we have learned
[1:09:21] to rely on these five senses
[1:09:25] we have learned to rely on these five
[1:09:28] senses now
[1:09:29] we we we we we need them here i couldn't
[1:09:32] i couldn't read without it
[1:09:34] amen thank god for it thank god for
[1:09:37] giving us these five senses
[1:09:39] but i can't throw away the six
[1:09:42] amen i can't throw away a six amen if i
[1:09:46] was blind
[1:09:47] and couldn't see out of my natural eyes
[1:09:51] i would have to rely on somebody to lead
[1:09:54] me
[1:09:55] i would have to have faith that they are
[1:09:58] going to lead me into the right place
[1:10:01] amen at the right time you see
[1:10:04] but we are some we we hear amen so
[1:10:08] we we we have these eyes a man so but
[1:10:11] but
[1:10:11] but we can't see we have to be able to
[1:10:14] look into the unseen
[1:10:15] yeah we have to be able to
[1:10:19] look amen into the mind of god
[1:10:22] amen because see the i'm i'll give you
[1:10:25] listen here i call brother josue
[1:10:29] a few weeks ago and i he he had hurt his
[1:10:32] back
[1:10:33] i just called i just called to check on
[1:10:34] your brother see how you doing
[1:10:36] he said listen now he said my
[1:10:39] back is hurting
[1:10:43] but my back is a lie
[1:10:50] he said i feel pain in my back but the
[1:10:53] pain
[1:10:53] is a lie amen because the word of god is
[1:10:58] more
[1:10:58] real than the pain that i'm feeling
[1:11:03] i almost break
[1:11:06] i'm driving in the car whoa lord have
[1:11:09] mercy what hallelujah
[1:11:12] the word of god is more real to me
[1:11:16] than the pain that i'm feeling thank you
[1:11:18] lord
[1:11:20] that's the place we have to get to my
[1:11:22] brothers and sisters
[1:11:24] that's the place we have to get to and
[1:11:26] i'm talking about the scene and about
[1:11:28] the grace of god
[1:11:30] it was the grace of god amen that
[1:11:33] that that that saw you amen in his mind
[1:11:36] and a slam slain before you ever existed
[1:11:40] now the bible says that faith
[1:11:43] is the substance and he said the prophet
[1:11:45] brought out that we live on that
[1:11:46] substance
[1:11:47] before the foundation of the world
[1:11:49] before this world was ever created
[1:11:51] before there was dirt before there were
[1:11:53] trees before there was anything
[1:11:55] before there was even a molecule amen
[1:11:58] now
[1:11:59] our bodies are derived of 16 elements
[1:12:03] but before those 16 elements came to be
[1:12:06] a man that he formed your body out of
[1:12:09] the lamb was already slain
[1:12:12] amen and faith amen already is the
[1:12:15] substance
[1:12:16] amen before there was a substance there
[1:12:19] was faith
[1:12:21] and it was the substance amen that
[1:12:23] brought this all into reality
[1:12:27] so
[1:12:31] faith in order to have faith
[1:12:34] you have to have you have to be able to
[1:12:38] go into the mind of christ
[1:12:40] amen you have to be able to see yourself
[1:12:42] as he sees you
[1:12:45] as he see you because see this time
[1:12:48] thing
[1:12:49] amen is just a testing ground we we
[1:12:52] are walking through amen
[1:12:56] we must walk by faith now in order to
[1:12:59] walk a
[1:13:00] walking is a reference a man of
[1:13:02] fellowship
[1:13:03] amen it is a reference to fellowship
[1:13:06] amen because how can two walk together
[1:13:08] except there unless they agree
[1:13:10] amen so when when he talks about walking
[1:13:12] it's about
[1:13:13] fellowshipping with god on the roads and
[1:13:15] man that two men walk
[1:13:16] and jesus came and walked with them they
[1:13:18] were fellowshipping
[1:13:19] amen enoch walked amen and as he was
[1:13:22] walking he began to
[1:13:24] talk with god amen and he began to be
[1:13:26] revealed
[1:13:27] so much of who god was and who he was
[1:13:31] his faith transferred him to another
[1:13:33] dimension
[1:13:36] his faith got so high until it just
[1:13:39] transferred him to another dimension
[1:13:42] and i got the quote here prophet said
[1:13:44] that's what's happening right now
[1:13:45] we are being transferred we our faith is
[1:13:48] being
[1:13:48] anointed our faith has taken us
[1:13:50] elevating us into another dimension
[1:13:52] even as we speak
[1:13:56] why because our thinking has changed
[1:14:00] we are not creatures of time we are not
[1:14:03] creatures of this world
[1:14:05] we are not earthly creep we're not
[1:14:07] earthly bound
[1:14:09] amen we are eagles soul among the
[1:14:12] heavens
[1:14:13] amen now we come down amen because we
[1:14:16] have to come go to work
[1:14:17] just like that eagle do that eagle come
[1:14:19] down now he could come down the hunt
[1:14:21] he come now get his food and then he
[1:14:23] gets right back up there in the
[1:14:24] heavenlies

[1:15:28] make it all the way to calvary and leave
[1:15:31] all of your sorrows there amen
[1:15:35] the mind of god let me read a couple of
[1:15:39] quotes here
[1:15:41] amen to bring you along
[1:15:46] the prophet said amen
[1:15:51] he became the poorest
[1:15:54] amen from the most from the from the
[1:15:57] richest to the poorest
[1:16:00] from the most blessed to the most
[1:16:03] horrible suffering
[1:16:05] and then besides that we went down into
[1:16:09] the lower steps of hell
[1:16:11] bearing our sins
[1:16:14] and got to the end of the stream
[1:16:18] and he in and the end of the rope
[1:16:22] from the kink there
[1:16:26] lifted it up in the resurrection
[1:16:29] and connected it with the other part of
[1:16:32] eternity
[1:16:34] and made a highway of holiness
[1:16:38] that the unclean can come and be
[1:16:40] cleansed
[1:16:42] through the fountain through the blood
[1:16:44] drawn from emmanuel's vein
[1:16:47] where sinners plunged released the flood
[1:16:49] lose all the guilty stains
[1:16:51] he said come on to the highway and
[1:16:54] someday
[1:16:56] he who was at the beginning of time
[1:16:59] shall stand at the ancient of time and
[1:17:02] will pull the great gospel cord
[1:17:05] and all that was on that highway
[1:17:08] from the beginning of time to the
[1:17:10] ancient of time
[1:17:12] to the end of time shall be lifted up
[1:17:15] as he draws time out of existence
[1:17:20] as he draws time out of existence
[1:17:24] into an eternity you see it
[1:17:28] there it is the only true potentate
[1:17:32] the king of kings the lord of lords
[1:17:36] how did he do it by foreknowledge
[1:17:39] that he was the lamb slain then
[1:17:43] if he was 4 000 years later
[1:17:47] it come into time run out
[1:17:51] he was born they done to him
[1:17:54] they what he said they he they done to
[1:17:57] him what he said
[1:17:58] they would do 4 000 years later
[1:18:02] and then he was crucified and slain
[1:18:05] but correctly he was slain before the
[1:18:08] world began
[1:18:11] the for god for god foreshadowed him
[1:18:15] and said that he would take place
[1:18:18] and when god speak it has to be
[1:18:21] you get it oh my god foreshadow christ
[1:18:25] and it was to be that that's why
[1:18:28] it was already finished when god said
[1:18:32] the word
[1:18:33] that finished it there is a re there is
[1:18:36] the reason
[1:18:37] he was actually prefigured slain
[1:18:41] when god spoke the word
[1:18:44] before the world before the world
[1:18:48] notice now not only christ was slain
[1:18:52] to take away our sins but your
[1:18:55] name was written in the book of life
[1:18:59] before the world god wrote your name
[1:19:03] associated with his
[1:19:06] before the foundation of the world
[1:19:10] amen amen do you believe it amen
[1:19:13] amen no wonder
[1:19:17] sickness peril death nothing can
[1:19:21] separate us from the love of god
[1:19:23] this is christ because the foundation of
[1:19:26] the world
[1:19:27] he put us on a great old highway
[1:19:30] climbed up the horizontal rainbow went
[1:19:33] into the pinnacle of the beginning
[1:19:35] of time again hold the rope in
[1:19:39] his hand and someday say come on up
[1:19:43] we which are alive and remain to the
[1:19:46] come of the lord
[1:19:48] shall shall not prevent them which are
[1:19:51] died
[1:19:51] in the highway because the trump of god
[1:19:54] shall sound
[1:19:55] amen and sound and the dead in christ
[1:19:58] shall rise
[1:19:59] and shall be caught up together to meet
[1:20:01] him and
[1:20:02] meet him as the chain is lifted back
[1:20:05] into the cycle of eternity
[1:20:08] and then the ages roll on and
[1:20:12] his praises will sing
[1:20:16] when this mortal ding there
[1:20:20] that's here in the earth this mortal
[1:20:22] ding
[1:20:23] that's here in the earth we shall be
[1:20:26] separated from it it'll be cast to the
[1:20:30] outside
[1:20:32] of the chain of eternity it'll be cast
[1:20:35] to the
[1:20:36] outside of the chain of eternity it'll
[1:20:39] be on the outside of the gulf
[1:20:41] which no man can cross over
[1:20:44] cross or ever did ever will and
[1:20:48] when this link down here was lifted up
[1:20:53] was lifted to that part that's the paved
[1:20:56] holy highway
[1:20:58] that god has in the beginning
[1:21:01] where there was nothing to defile there
[1:21:04] is nothing to destroy
[1:21:06] sin caused the loop and when the loop
[1:21:08] continued right down
[1:21:10] through here and bring out the delegates
[1:21:13] and
[1:21:14] and when she is pulled up together to
[1:21:17] meet each end
[1:21:20] eternity rolls on and that's the redeem
[1:21:23] shall walk in you get it that's when the
[1:21:26] redeemed shall walk in
[1:21:28] amen now we we we we i was i was
[1:21:32] looking at this amen
[1:21:36] and uh i began to think on the song
[1:21:40] amen amazing grace yes
[1:21:43] and uh uh
[1:21:46] uh the the the the the word
[1:21:50] amen amazing as you
[1:21:53] think on the grace of god amen
[1:21:57] you know as i think on the grace of god
[1:22:02] it was okay that he i i i i appreciate
[1:22:05] that he woke me up this morning
[1:22:08] amen i appreciate that he gave me food
[1:22:10] to eat
[1:22:11] that's that's definitely the grace of
[1:22:13] god amen i appreciate that
[1:22:15] i got close to wearing a roof over my
[1:22:17] head that is definitely
[1:22:19] the grace of god amen i appreciate
[1:22:22] you know that i got a car to drive and i
[1:22:24] got a job to go through and all of those
[1:22:26] kind of things that is definitely the
[1:22:27] grace of god
[1:22:28] amen but when you when you really think
[1:22:31] about
[1:22:32] that the amazing grace of god
[1:22:35] the amazing grace of god is when he come
[1:22:38] down
[1:22:38] amen and he took all my sorrows amen
[1:22:42] when a perfect god
[1:22:43] amen that come down and he bore all of
[1:22:45] my sins and transgressions amen
[1:22:48] and when a perfect god came down amen
[1:22:51] and he took all of my sins washed them
[1:22:53] in his blood amen and washed them in the
[1:22:55] drain of forgetfulness
[1:22:57] amen that's the perfect god what an
[1:22:59] amazing
[1:23:01] grace grace
[1:23:04] is amazing
[1:23:10] i began to think about that
[1:23:15] amazing i say
[1:23:18] who would have thought of that
[1:23:22] uh uh word to put in front of the grace
[1:23:25] to describe how great it is
[1:23:28] i looked up the word amazing and it
[1:23:31] gave some different meanings and you
[1:23:33] could have said awesome grace
[1:23:36] it could have said he had a a a a
[1:23:40] wonderful grace
[1:23:42] it said wonderful
[1:23:46] it said awesome it said uh stupendous
[1:23:50] it said miraculous all right and then at
[1:23:52] the end
[1:23:53] it said unbelievable
[1:24:03] so my mind went to paradox
[1:24:06] unbelievable but true
[1:24:11] it was unbelievable but it's true so i
[1:24:16] went to the message paradox
[1:24:19] and in the message paradox he said they
[1:24:20] were baptized repented baptized and they
[1:24:22] come out to walk
[1:24:23] in a new life and a new land in a
[1:24:26] newness of journey
[1:24:28] among the people in the hand of god was
[1:24:30] upon them
[1:24:31] but finally they come to a place in this
[1:24:34] walk
[1:24:34] talking about the children of israel let
[1:24:36] me just add that and they said they were
[1:24:38] not satisfied with their walk
[1:24:39] of grace and they had to come to
[1:24:43] uh come to something that they could do
[1:24:46] themselves see that's our problem
[1:24:50] that's our problem now we're gonna get
[1:24:51] somewhere with that we always looking
[1:24:53] that we have to do
[1:24:54] why because we got these little crazy
[1:24:57] dollar mission we think we smart
[1:25:00] all right because we got a mind and we
[1:25:02] gotta we we can see and we can we can we
[1:25:04] can we can we can we can dissect we can
[1:25:06] navigate we can reason
[1:25:08] you know we can do all of these kind of
[1:25:09] thing so you know so we thinking what is
[1:25:12] something you got to do
[1:25:15] same mistake the children of israel made
[1:25:17] all right
[1:25:19] he said now uh uh that's where people
[1:25:22] think today
[1:25:23] of divine healing or something any other
[1:25:25] works of grace
[1:25:27] of god that there is something that
[1:25:30] that you have to do but there is
[1:25:33] nothing you have to do but believe
[1:25:38] just believe god
[1:25:42] and they if they would have continued on
[1:25:47] this promise wasn't given to them under
[1:25:49] the law
[1:25:51] the promise was given before the law
[1:25:55] without any conditions to it i
[1:25:58] have given you this land go on over into
[1:26:02] it but before they got to the promised
[1:26:06] land they decided that there was
[1:26:08] something they must do themselves
[1:26:13] and that's where we still find that
[1:26:15] among human beings
[1:26:17] we're prone to be the same way to be
[1:26:20] that way
[1:26:21] there is something that we've got to do
[1:26:24] amen
[1:26:26] we feel that we have got to
[1:26:29] have something into it also
[1:26:33] you do have you do have something into
[1:26:35] it
[1:26:36] right that's your surrender of your will
[1:26:40] your own ideas the will and idea of to
[1:26:45] the will and idea of
[1:26:47] almighty god and it's finished
[1:26:50] that's that's all there just take his
[1:26:53] promise
[1:26:54] don't think of nothing else whereby it
[1:26:58] and god does the rest of it
[1:27:02] and god does the rest of it
[1:27:05] now we we we we we we have to
[1:27:08] my brothers and sisters get our
[1:27:12] thinking i was i was i was so excited
[1:27:14] about this thing
[1:27:16] and uh
[1:27:20] i was going through the drive through to
[1:27:21] get something to eat and i told a young
[1:27:23] man at the drive-thru and said brother
[1:27:25] we got the elevator i think
[1:27:28] i ain't had nobody preached too so i
[1:27:29] figured i'd preach to the man at the
[1:27:30] drive to
[1:27:32] i said brother we got to elevate i think
[1:27:35] and he said back to me amen
[1:27:38] he said i was just telling this dude
[1:27:40] right now we got to think higher
[1:27:45] i say well i'm glad i said you're right
[1:27:50] he said we're just telling them in here
[1:27:51] man we got to think higher we got to
[1:27:53] start figuring out we got to stop
[1:27:54] thinking better man we better than this
[1:27:56] we got to start doing that say man you
[1:27:58] got to think outside of this you got to
[1:27:59] think outside of these 16 elements
[1:28:01] you got to think you you could see your
[1:28:03] mind has been so conditioned
[1:28:06] amen to this to like the chickens
[1:28:16] eating whatever they give you
[1:28:19] but the bible say man should not live by
[1:28:21] by bread alone
[1:28:24] but every word that proceedeth out of
[1:28:26] the mouth of god
[1:28:28] amen and without a revelation
[1:28:32] without a true revelation amen
[1:28:36] what are you feeding on
[1:28:43] in order for healing to take place
[1:28:47] sometime if there's a wound my wife is a
[1:28:50] woman
[1:28:51] she's a wound care expert and
[1:28:54] if the wound is to a place where the
[1:28:57] vessels and
[1:28:59] things are cauterizing you have to
[1:29:02] scrape away
[1:29:04] the dead tissue
[1:29:08] see so sometimes when you come to church
[1:29:11] god gotta scrape away the dead tissue
[1:29:14] gotta scrape away the dead tissue she
[1:29:17] say
[1:29:17] it has to do that until you can get
[1:29:19] fresh blood
[1:29:23] it has to do that's till you get fresh
[1:29:25] blood
[1:29:26] and then what they do is they have to
[1:29:28] put it together
[1:29:30] and from there god does the work
[1:29:35] see but you have to be willing to sit
[1:29:38] there
[1:29:38] and they and and and they scrape
[1:29:42] and it's painful and it hurt
[1:29:45] but once we get fresh blood healing can
[1:29:48] take place
[1:29:49] oh man
[1:29:53] healing can't take place until you
[1:29:55] scrape off the old dead tissue
[1:29:58] the old dead beliefs in your mind we
[1:30:01] have to get to the fresh
[1:30:02] bleeding blood of the word i'm not
[1:30:05] talking about that stagnant stuff
[1:30:07] amen those old beliefs those old ideas
[1:30:11] amen that you don't have a revelation of
[1:30:13] what they mean anyway
[1:30:14] but i'm talking about the bleeding fresh
[1:30:17] blooded
[1:30:18] word of god amen so that the healing can
[1:30:21] take
[1:30:21] place i'm not just talking about healing
[1:30:23] of your body
[1:30:24] i'm talking about the healing of the
[1:30:26] body of god
[1:30:28] amen amen
[1:30:31] hallelujah let me read something
[1:30:41] in the message desperation
[1:30:44] he said i believe the reason that we
[1:30:45] don't have desperation is because of a
[1:30:47] lack of love
[1:30:52] amen because of a lack of love of a lack
[1:30:56] of love
[1:30:56] god love but like god
[1:30:59] the love of god i think that the love of
[1:31:03] god
[1:31:03] causes desperation if god is in you the
[1:31:07] token inside of you
[1:31:09] will and they're talking inside of you
[1:31:10] and you see the conditions of the time
[1:31:14] and people waiting in sin
[1:31:17] the way they are it'll throw you into
[1:31:20] desperation
[1:31:21] he said i believe it will now
[1:31:24] the world plainly states if you want
[1:31:28] to put this down and go the word i'm
[1:31:30] sorry
[1:31:31] the word plainly states if you want to
[1:31:33] put this down he says in galatians 5 6
[1:31:34] that faith
[1:31:36] worketh by love faith worketh by love
[1:31:39] the only way that you can have faith is
[1:31:43] have love first because after all
[1:31:47] faith is love's incentive amen and
[1:31:50] center that's exactly
[1:31:51] what faith is it is the incentive to
[1:31:54] love now
[1:31:56] you if you don't have
[1:31:59] love you can't have faith
[1:32:05] if you don't have love you can't have
[1:32:08] faith
[1:32:10] how can you have faith he gave him he's
[1:32:12] given an example here about you well how
[1:32:14] can you have faith in your wife if you
[1:32:15] don't
[1:32:16] love her that's the feeling
[1:32:20] uh now how about in the agape
[1:32:24] to god how can it be if you
[1:32:28] don't love god if you said you
[1:32:31] love your wife and you never tell her
[1:32:33] and you never sat down
[1:32:35] and and made love to her express it to
[1:32:38] her kiss her and hug her
[1:32:39] and tell her that she's the best cook in
[1:32:41] the country all the things
[1:32:43] uh that you know and you uh she's pretty
[1:32:47] she's this
[1:32:48] and how you how much you love her
[1:32:51] if you don't do that she'll never know
[1:32:54] it
[1:32:55] that's the way if you don't do if you
[1:32:58] don't love her
[1:32:59] if you don't express it amen
[1:33:02] that's the way that's the that's
[1:33:05] that's the way we do to god
[1:33:08] when we love him we tell him about it
[1:33:12] we sit down and we adore him
[1:33:15] we worship him and see love drives
[1:33:19] us to that now what if something
[1:33:22] has got to be done for your wife why it
[1:33:25] throws you into desperation to get it
[1:33:27] done
[1:33:28] why if somebody says i'm gonna hear this
[1:33:31] later
[1:33:32] if somebody says your wife got cancer
[1:33:36] and if somebody says your wife got tb
[1:33:40] and she is fixing to die and you'll
[1:33:43] do anything see it'll throw you into
[1:33:47] desperation
[1:33:49] amen i'm a witness
[1:33:52] and that's the same thing that it is we
[1:33:55] must have
[1:33:56] love before we can have
[1:33:59] faith and faith when we have
[1:34:03] genuine love what does it do
[1:34:06] it pushes our faith to the battlefront
[1:34:11] now i'm gonna skip down here and i'm
[1:34:13] gonna read something
[1:34:15] amen you get the gist there down here on
[1:34:18] uh
[1:34:19] paragraph uh 76
[1:34:24] notice the bible said here also in james
[1:34:28] 16 5 16 if we confess our faults
[1:34:32] get if getting right making ready
[1:34:36] for it confess our faults one to another
[1:34:40] having no faults ask people to pray for
[1:34:44] you
[1:34:44] confess your faults one to another
[1:34:48] praying one for the other there you
[1:34:52] are when love with
[1:34:55] love love that i got
[1:34:58] confidence i can confess to you my wrong
[1:35:02] and you can confess to me you're wrong
[1:35:05] and i love you well enough that i will
[1:35:08] pray for you
[1:35:10] and you pray for me and we
[1:35:13] will and will stay with it with the
[1:35:16] effectual fervent prayer
[1:35:19] until it's answered that's
[1:35:23] desperation that's what we should have
[1:35:27] all the time amen
[1:35:30] that's what we should have all the time
[1:35:33] and you know what that is that is
[1:35:36] amazing
[1:35:37] grace unbelievable
[1:35:40] but true how can a people have love like
[1:35:44] that one for another
[1:35:45] it's unbelievable but true
[1:35:49] and i went on and i began to think about
[1:35:51] the song now amazing grace
[1:35:54] and the songwriter said how sweet
[1:35:57] the sound what does grace sound like
[1:36:02] i say what does grace sound like that is
[1:36:05] so sweet
[1:36:06] you want to know the sweetness that
[1:36:08] grace sound like when
[1:36:10] i walk into the sanctuary and i hear the
[1:36:13] songs of joy
