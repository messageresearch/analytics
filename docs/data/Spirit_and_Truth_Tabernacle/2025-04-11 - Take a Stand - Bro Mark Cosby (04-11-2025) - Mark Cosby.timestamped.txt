[40:10] we just thank our precious pastor for
[40:12] this opportunity and it's been a long
[40:14] time since I've been on the side of
[40:16] here. So thankful to the Lord. He's

[40:22] Thank you for all your prayers. I I
[40:24] appreciate it. He's been answering them
[40:25] and I return to work uh the 21st. I'll
[40:28] be back to work.
[40:34] Amen. Well, um we'll just bow in a word
[40:36] of prayer before we open our Bibles up.
[40:38] Dear heavenly father, um we just thank
[40:41] you for this precious moment, Lord. Just
[40:42] to be in your presence, Lord. Just thank
[40:45] you for this uh you service tonight,
[40:46] Lord. Father, we're just wanting to hear
[40:49] a word from you, Lord. Just just may you
[40:51] just move me out the way, Lord Jesus.
[40:53] Father, may they just hear from you and
[40:55] you alone, Lord. Lord, may you be with
[40:57] each need, each heart, Lord. Whoever may
[40:59] be listening on the live stream, Lord.
[41:01] May you speak to them personally as
[41:02] well, Lord. Father, may we feel your
[41:04] presence this morning, Lord, just
[41:05] tonight, Lord Jesus. Lord, may you just
[41:07] bring your word to life, Lord Jesus. May
[41:09] you just bring each quote to life, Lord.
[41:12] Father, may we just leave your your
[41:14] house, Lord, just encourage, Lord. May
[41:16] we leave your house just changed, Lord
[41:18] Jesus, because Lord, you have the power
[41:20] to change us right now, Lord Jesus. May
[41:23] you just breathe life into us, Lord.
[41:25] Lord, may you pour down revelation from
[41:27] heaven, almighty God. And Lord, may you
[41:30] just take control, Lord, of this
[41:32] service, Lord. May you have preeminence,
[41:33] Lord Jesus. We ask all these things in
[41:36] Jesus Christ's name.
[41:38] Amen. Open our Bibles to uh Hebrews chap
[41:42] 11 and we'll begin in verse
[41:49] 23. Say amen when you get there.
[41:54] So it's a very familiar scripture. So
[41:56] we'll start in verse 23 of Hebrews 11.
[41:59] So it says, "By faith, Moses when he was
[42:03] born was hid three months of his parents
[42:05] because they saw he was a proper child
[42:08] and they were not afraid of the king's
[42:10] commandment. By faith, Moses, when he
[42:13] was come to years, refused to be called
[42:16] the son of Pharaoh's daughter, choosing
[42:18] rather to suffer affliction with the
[42:21] people of God than to enjoy the
[42:23] pleasures of sin for a season. So, I
[42:25] like how the Bible brings out the
[42:27] pleasures of sin for a season. You can
[42:31] People may be enjoying their time living
[42:33] in sin, but that's only for a season.
[42:36] Amen.
[42:37] esteeming the reproach of Christ's
[42:39] greater riches in the treasures in
[42:41] Egypt. For he had respect, took a
[42:43] recompense of the reward. By faith he
[42:46] forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of
[42:48] the king, for he endured as seeing him
[42:50] who was invisible. Through faith he kept
[42:53] the Passover and sprinkling of the
[42:54] blood, lest se be destroyed, the
[42:57] firstborn should touch them. By faith,
[42:59] they passed through the Red Sea by dry
[43:01] land. Maybe somebody tonight has a Red
[43:03] Sea that they can't cross. But remember
[43:05] the same God that that part of that Red
[43:07] Sea there can part the same Red Sea for
[43:09] you as well which the Egyptians are
[43:12] saying to do were drowned. You may be
[43:14] seated. So the title of this message
[43:17] today is take a stand. To take a stand.
[43:21] We all got to take a stand for
[43:22] something. The greatest stand that you
[43:24] can ever take is for Christ. It it's a
[43:27] stand that will last forever into
[43:30] eternity. Some people take a stand for
[43:32] politics. Some people take a stand for
[43:34] certain rights. Some people take a stand
[43:36] for certain things. But the greatest
[43:37] thing you can take a stand is this.
[43:39] We're and brother Jack mentioned on
[43:42] Wednesday with all these voices. Some
[43:43] people take a stand for mental health.
[43:45] Let me take a stand for dietitionian.
[43:47] Whatever it is, it what the most
[43:49] important thing you could take a stand
[43:50] for is right here in this word. What
[43:53] that's what Moses did. He took a stand
[43:54] for God when it was nothing but
[43:57] heathenism around him. Nothing but uh
[43:59] doubt, nothing but discouragement. He
[44:01] decided to take a stand for God. Let's
[44:04] go to uh Daniel now. We'll talk a
[44:06] different character. So, we're going to
[44:07] just go to the Bible and just uh look at
[44:09] a couple people that have taken a stand
[44:11] uh for God and what it paid
[44:17] off. It's back on. All right. So, we'll
[44:20] go to the book of Daniel and we'll read
[44:22] um the first verse and we'll we'll read
[44:25] quite a lengthy in this scripture. Let
[44:27] me get to it myself. All right. So, I
[44:29] really like uh I really like the book of
[44:31] Daniel um because we're at the youth
[44:33] service and I was doing a little
[44:35] research and they said Daniel and the
[44:37] Hebrew boys were around 15 to 18. So, I
[44:40] think we all you guys can all fit into
[44:41] that age range right there. And I like
[44:44] it because they were put in a situation
[44:47] where they didn't have a group of
[44:48] believers around them. It was only four
[44:50] of them. And so, I just like how they
[44:53] could take a stand amongst not even
[44:55] being in their own land, being
[44:57] forcefully taken. um having wine,
[45:00] alcoholism all around them, having the
[45:02] king's meat, uh heathen sacrifices, all
[45:05] these things they had around them, but
[45:06] yet still they could keep an atmosphere
[45:08] around them of faith, but yet still they
[45:11] could keep their eyes on God. So what
[45:13] excuse do we have? We live in a country
[45:15] where we have the freedom of religion.
[45:18] We have Bibles in your home. Some
[45:20] countries can't if you even say the name
[45:22] Jesus, they'll kill you. So we I think
[45:24] we've gotten so lazy as Christians
[45:26] because of the amenities that we have,
[45:28] because of the things that are so easy
[45:30] to us. But a lot of people uh have to
[45:33] fight for these things that we have.
[45:34] They have to keep secrecy sometimes. But
[45:36] yet I think we've we've got so
[45:38] comfortable, brother Brandon. Many times
[45:40] we got so comfortable in in in in our
[45:43] our our Christianity that we we we
[45:46] failed to fight every day cuz it's a
[45:48] battle of faith that we must fight. Cuz
[45:50] look at Daniel and them. It was a battle
[45:51] of faith. They literally had to take a
[45:53] stand when when when King Nebuchadnezzar
[45:56] didn't even want them to worship God. He
[45:58] want them to worship him. So, let's keep
[46:00] it in verse one right here. In the third
[46:02] year of the reign of Joim, king of
[46:04] Judah, came Nebuchadnezzar, king of
[46:06] Babylon, unto Jerusalem and besieges it.
[46:08] Just imagine you're just having dinner
[46:10] with your family and somebody comes
[46:12] busting in your door and just take you
[46:13] into captivity.
[46:15] Those kids weren't expecting that.
[46:16] They're expecting to have they're
[46:18] enjoying their life as a kid, as a
[46:19] youth, probably going to school. But yet
[46:21] they got dragged out their house. And
[46:23] the Lord gave Joakeim, the king of
[46:25] Judah, into his hand, the part of the
[46:27] vessels of the house of God, which he
[46:28] carried into the land of Shinar, to the
[46:31] house of his God, and brought the
[46:32] vessels into the treasure of the house
[46:34] of his God. And the king spake unto
[46:36] Aspipen the master of his Enoch that he
[46:39] should bring certain of the children of
[46:40] Israel and princes of the king's seed
[46:42] and of the princes children to whom was
[46:45] no blemish but well fa favored and
[46:47] skillful in all wisdom and cunning and
[46:49] knowledge and understanding and had
[46:51] ability in them to stand in the king's
[46:52] palace and whom they might teach the
[46:55] learning and the tongue of the Chaldans.
[46:57] And the king appointed them a daily
[46:58] provision of king's meat and of wine
[47:00] which he drank. So nourishing them three
[47:02] years that at the end of there they
[47:04] might stand before the king. Now among
[47:06] them there's the the Hebrew children. We
[47:08] got Judah, Daniel, Hi, Misha and Aza.
[47:11] Those are real names, their real names,
[47:13] not the uh the names they were given in
[47:14] Babylon. Unto the prince of the Enochs
[47:16] gave them names. For he gave unto Daniel
[47:18] the name of Bel Beser, to Hani the
[47:21] Shadrach, to Mishel Mach, and to Araha
[47:24] Abendo. I like right here, verse eight,
[47:26] right here. I love what it says. Verse
[47:28] eight, but Daniel purposed in his heart
[47:32] that he would not defile himself with a
[47:34] portion of the king's meat. Now, he
[47:36] could have justified and say, "Well,
[47:37] everybody else is doing it." He said,
[47:39] "Everybody else is drinking the wine.
[47:40] Everybody else is drinking the
[47:41] sacrificial meats, but he decided on his
[47:44] own." He purposed in his heart. And the
[47:46] same thing we have to do is purpose in
[47:48] our heart to serve God. Because we're
[47:50] constantly surrounded by people who who
[47:52] blasphem the name of God. constantly
[47:54] surrounded by people who curse like
[47:55] sailors, constantly um surrounded by
[47:58] unbelief. But Daniel took a stand
[48:00] without even having the Holy Ghost like
[48:02] we do. So if he could take a stand like
[48:04] that, what can we do with the spirit of
[48:06] God living inside of us? So we have no
[48:09] excuse. He said, "But Daniel purposed in
[48:11] his heart that he would not defile
[48:13] himself with the portion of the king's
[48:15] meat, not defile oursel with Tik Tok
[48:17] videos, not defile oursel with filth on
[48:20] YouTube, on social media. Social media
[48:23] has its place. It has his goods, but it
[48:25] also has a lot of bads. So, nor with the
[48:28] wine which he drank. Therefore, he
[48:30] requested of the prince of the Enochs
[48:32] that he might not defile himself. He
[48:34] took a stand. He was willing. He was
[48:36] stand up. He was take a stand what he
[48:38] believed in. He he said, "Sir, we don't
[48:41] do these kind of things. I serve a
[48:43] mighty God and I can't I can't put
[48:46] myself in this position like these
[48:47] others are." So, let's keep going to
[48:50] verse nine.
[48:51] Now, God had brought Daniel into favor.
[48:53] I love right there, favor. If you take a
[48:56] stand for God, God will bring favor. We
[48:59] all can attest to that. That God will
[49:00] bring favor even when people don't even
[49:02] believe God have favor over you. I love
[49:04] that. So, that's why you don't have to
[49:06] compromise. We don't have to compromise.
[49:09] God didn't cause to be compromisers. He
[49:11] did not. The devil might be calling you
[49:13] to do that, but God didn't cause to do
[49:14] that. The devil will always want you to
[49:17] compromise with the word of God. You go
[49:18] back to the Garden of Eden. What
[49:20] happened? Compromise. Every time you
[49:22] compromise, that's when the devil can
[49:24] come in. That's when the devil will have
[49:25] his way. So now God had brought Daniel
[49:27] into favor and tender love with the
[49:30] prince of the Enoch. And the prince of
[49:32] the Enoch said in Daniel, I fear the
[49:33] Lord the king, who at the point of your
[49:35] meat and your drink. For why should he
[49:37] see your face is worse? Now the enemy is
[49:38] trying to say, "You sure you want to do
[49:40] this? You're going to hurt your body.
[49:42] You're going to hurt your system. You
[49:43] don't need to fast. You don't need to do
[49:45] this. Nah, you need to eat three meals a
[49:46] day." No. Sometimes we got to fast. We
[49:48] got to I believe that we eat fast but we
[49:51] don't fast enough. I remember a wise man
[49:54] told me that we we love to eat but we're
[49:57] scared to fast sometimes. I I believe
[49:59] that even Jesus said we need to be
[50:01] fasting.
[50:03] I'm not saying we got to fast three days
[50:05] a week. I'm just saying throw fasting in
[50:07] in in your prayer schedule, your prayer
[50:08] life sometimes. It makes a big
[50:10] difference. I I can testify to that.
[50:13] Amen. Let's keep going. I fear the Lord
[50:14] the king appointed your meat and your
[50:16] drink. For why should he see your faces
[50:18] worse liking the children which are of
[50:20] your sort? Then he shall make me
[50:21] endangered my head to the king. Then
[50:23] said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince
[50:25] of Enoch has set over Daniel and Hannah,
[50:27] Michelle, and Ezra, prove thy servant, I
[50:30] beseech thee, 10 days. I love that. He
[50:32] said, let me show you what my God can
[50:34] do. Cuz I'm not going to defile my my my
[50:37] life with the things of the kings, but
[50:39] I'm going to keep my life consecrated to
[50:41] God. He said, just give me 10 days. He
[50:43] said, give me 10 days. That's all I
[50:45] need. says uh to eat to plus to eat
[50:48] water to drink. Then let our countenance
[50:50] be looked upon before thee in the
[50:51] countenance of thy children that eat of
[50:53] a portion of the king's meat. And thou
[50:55] seeest deal with thy servants. So he
[50:57] consented to them in this matter and
[50:58] proved them 10 days. At the end of 10
[51:01] days, their countenance appeared fair
[51:03] and fatter in flesh than all the
[51:05] children which did eat the portion of
[51:06] the king's meat. So I I like that. So we
[51:10] have peer pressure. We all have peer
[51:12] pressure. The youth has peer pressure.
[51:14] We have peer pressure. But I I was a
[51:16] youth once and there's a lot of peer
[51:18] pressure. So you don't have to do the
[51:20] things that everybody else is doing
[51:22] because those things that they're doing
[51:24] is going to scar you. It may not seem
[51:26] like it now, but it will scar you. So
[51:29] that's why as as a youth, you want to
[51:31] keep yourself clean. That's why you want
[51:33] to wait till you're married. That's why
[51:35] you don't want to partake of parties and
[51:37] drinking because that stuff can destroy
[51:39] your life. How you dress is important as
[51:42] well.
[51:43] All those things matter. Holiness still
[51:45] matters to God. God is still a holy God.
[51:49] God still holds a God standard. I don't
[51:51] care if we live in in 2025. God still
[51:54] holds the same standard he did from the
[51:56] beginning in Genesis. God does not
[51:58] change. God will make a way for you. Be
[52:02] faithful to God. He'll be faithful to
[52:03] you.
[52:05] Take a stand. Let's finish this up. It
[52:08] says, "Thus Mesar took away the portion
[52:10] of their meat and the wine they should
[52:11] drink and gave them the pulse. As for
[52:13] these children, the four children, God
[52:15] gave them knowledge and skill in all
[52:17] learning and wisdom, and Daniel had
[52:19] understanding and visions and dreams."
[52:20] Now, at the end of the 10 days that the
[52:22] king has said he should bring them in.
[52:23] Then the prince and Enoch brought them
[52:25] in before Nebuchadnezzar. And the king
[52:28] communed with them, and among them all
[52:30] found none like Daniel, Hi, Misha,
[52:33] therefore they stood before the king. In
[52:35] all matters of wisdom and understanding
[52:36] that the king inquired of them, he found
[52:38] them 10 times better than all the
[52:42] magicians and straws that were in the
[52:44] realm of this god. And Daniel continued
[52:46] even to the first year of Cyrus. I love
[52:48] that. 10 times. That's because they took
[52:50] a stand for God. God made him that way.
[52:53] Yes, sir. Let's um let's read a quote.
[52:58] So, uh we got this quote from
[52:59] investments. So I I love investments
[53:02] because a lot of time when people think
[53:03] about investments they think of stock
[53:04] market but you invest in your life the
[53:08] career you take you invest um the type
[53:11] of friends you have you invest uh the
[53:14] type of job you have you invest um the
[53:17] the the type of things you watch on
[53:19] YouTube on TV on on Netflix you invest.
[53:23] So we can invest our time. I believe
[53:25] that's one of the greatest things that
[53:26] we can do is invest our time. It's one
[53:28] of the dangerous things we can do is
[53:29] invest our time because we have kids
[53:32] just just constantly being raised by
[53:35] tablets, smartphones, um TV, and that
[53:39] really poisons their mind because that
[53:42] their parents aren't um safeguarding it.
[53:44] They're just letting them just scroll
[53:45] and scroll and scroll and all you need
[53:47] to do is one click. I've been there
[53:48] before. One click and it destroys your
[53:50] life. Literally, just like that. And so
[53:52] we live in a day and age where it's such
[53:54] techn a technological age where we
[53:57] depend upon uh internet for so many
[54:00] things and and I think what it's done is
[54:02] make it it's made us numb like brother
[54:04] Jack said it's made us numb to the
[54:06] things we'll see something back in the
[54:08] day that we we we would like turn away
[54:09] from but now we just deal with it. And
[54:11] so we got to come to a place where we
[54:13] got to take a stand. We can't be
[54:15] compromising with the things that we
[54:16] watched. And so I I believe the greatest
[54:19] investment we can do is to take a stand
[54:21] for Christ. That's the greatest
[54:22] investment that you'll ever do because
[54:23] it's an investment that that is
[54:25] constantly it won't depreciate because
[54:27] of the market. It won't change because a
[54:30] company got bought out, but it it will
[54:31] it will always hold its value no matter
[54:33] what time, no matter what age, no matter
[54:35] how old you are. And you won't take a
[54:37] hit on if you if you withdraw it early
[54:39] because if you withdraw your 401k early,
[54:41] you take a hit. But but with Jesus, you
[54:43] don't take a hit.
[54:46] All right, let's go to investments. Um,
[54:47] so Daniel purposed in his heart that he
[54:50] was wasn't going to defile his
[54:51] investment. He purposed no matter what
[54:54] the world how rich the king gets, how
[54:57] much he tries to get me off of these
[54:59] things of the world, I'm not going to do
[55:01] it. I'm not going to defile my
[55:05] investment. Oh Christian world, don't
[55:08] defile your vestment. Don't take a
[55:11] chance in trying to date somebody that
[55:12] you know you shouldn't be dating. All
[55:13] right. It the first the first standard
[55:16] is does he or she have the Holy Ghost?
[55:19] If he or she does not have the Holy
[55:21] Ghost, no. No.
[55:25] Don't say, "Oh, I can change him or I I
[55:27] can witness him." No. What you're doing
[55:29] is is a recipe for disaster. You're
[55:32] going to wind up in heartache, tears,
[55:34] and a broken heart. Just like that.
[55:36] There's thousands of girls, thousands of
[55:38] guys who've done it. And each time I
[55:42] heart's broken. Yes, sir. So, Daniel
[55:45] purposed that he wouldn't do it. It paid
[55:48] off. Look at that. By saving his life
[55:51] when he was thrown into a lion's den.
[55:54] Look at that. His investment really paid
[55:56] off. The Hebrew children were determined
[55:59] that they would not worship an idol.
[56:02] Think about this. The Bible doesn't uh
[56:04] necessarily always talk about the
[56:06] thoughts. Just imagine being in a
[56:08] situation where you're literally one
[56:10] step from death. you just saw the um you
[56:13] just saw his servants just get burned by
[56:15] the fire and you're thinking, "Wow, I'm
[56:18] next." But yet their faith stood the
[56:21] test. They said, "If if God saved me or
[56:24] not, I'm still not going to bow down to
[56:25] you, king." So the same thing we got to
[56:27] do in our life. People are going to ask
[56:29] you to they're going to put you in
[56:30] comfortable situations where they want
[56:32] to the devil wants to see if your faith
[56:34] is really in God or not. And we got to
[56:36] pass that test because there's no
[56:38] greater God than God. There's only one.
[56:41] Let's keep going. This quote. So, the
[56:43] Hebrew children were determined all.
[56:44] They would not worship an idol. And it
[56:46] paid off by saving their life in a fiery
[56:48] furnace. I'm going to tell you this. A
[56:50] person who really makes an investment in
[56:52] Christ will never regret it. Not one
[56:54] time. Amen. Let's go to another quote in
[56:57] investments. You can't take the gospel
[56:59] over into the world. We got to get the
[57:02] world over here. H I love this right
[57:05] here. Hollywood reaches after shiny
[57:07] things. A monkey does the same thing. I
[57:10] don't want us to be monkeys because we
[57:13] over here reaching after fashion,
[57:14] reaching after the uh um popularity,
[57:17] reaching over this. Don't be a monkey,
[57:19] right? We're we're not monkeys. God
[57:21] didn't make us monkeys. I don't care
[57:23] what scientists say. We didn't come from
[57:24] monkeys. God made monkeys and God made
[57:27] us. Simple as that. So, we ain't
[57:29] monkeys. Don't be reaching after the
[57:31] thing the fancy things of the world and
[57:32] Hollywood and and compromising. Don't do
[57:35] it. So, Hollywood shines, but the gospel
[57:39] glows. I love that right there. There's
[57:41] quite a difference between shining and
[57:43] glowing. We're trying to put big. We're
[57:45] trying to put on big things and be
[57:47] something big. That's no way to get the
[57:49] outsider
[57:51] live the life and let Christ live in
[57:54] you. That's the important thing right
[57:56] there. Let Christ live in you. If Christ
[57:59] never dwells in your tabernacle, you're
[58:01] never going to live a life he wants you
[58:02] to live because God has a purpose for
[58:04] your life. But in order for him to lead
[58:06] you and guide you in the true purpose,
[58:08] he has to live inside your tabernacle.
[58:10] Like brother Troy said, in order for us
[58:11] him live inside your tabernacle, you
[58:13] have to let him in. He's knocking on the
[58:15] door and you got to let him in. True.
[58:17] It's the only way. I don't care how good
[58:19] of a person you are. I don't care how
[58:21] nice you are. I don't care how much you
[58:23] give to the poor. That's not will get
[58:25] you to heaven. God isn't looking for
[58:27] that. The first thing he's looking for
[58:28] is the seal of God. Do you have Jesus
[58:31] Christ living inside you, sealed away
[58:33] into the day of your redemption? That's
[58:34] the most I'm not saying don't be a good
[58:36] person, but I'm saying there's a lot of
[58:38] good people. I said this before across
[58:40] the pulpit. Muslims would will put a lot
[58:43] of a lot of Americans to shame of how
[58:46] good they live. That they because a lot
[58:49] of Americans are immorality, a lot of
[58:51] immorality, a lot of disgusting things.
[58:53] Even even some heathen tribes will put
[58:56] uh will put America into a shame. So, it
[58:59] just shows you it's not about how good
[59:01] of a person you can be. It's about is
[59:04] God living and dwelling inside of you.
[59:06] That's the most important thing. God
[59:07] isn't going to say, "Oh, well, wow. You
[59:09] did a good job. You gave to the
[59:12] Salvation Army every year. You you
[59:14] helped the needy. You did the poor."
[59:16] He's going to be check mark. You made
[59:17] it. No, he's going to say, "Do I see my
[59:19] spirit inside you? Is my spirit there?
[59:22] Well done and good and faithful
[59:23] servant." Cuz a well done, good and
[59:25] faithful servant is going to be sealed
[59:26] away into the kingdom of God.
[59:29] I lost my place. We're trying to put on
[59:30] big things and be something big. That is
[59:32] no way to get the outsider. Live the
[59:35] life and let Christ live in you. Makes
[59:38] him hunger and thirst to be like you.
[59:39] So, somebody should see your life and
[59:41] see something different about you.
[59:44] You're not going to be like you're not
[59:44] going to think everybody else. You're
[59:46] not going to be like everybody else, but
[59:47] something's different about you. They're
[59:48] going to notice. And it's it's not you,
[59:50] but it's Christ inside of you living
[59:52] that life. So, um just to thirst to be
[59:55] like you. You become salty, he'll get
[59:57] thirsty. The only thing we can be salty
[1:00:00] is let the life of Christ be in you for
[1:00:02] he is that salt only saves at that
[1:00:04] context.
[1:00:05] So I'm I'm a big advocate that we got to
[1:00:08] be careful in the type of music we
[1:00:10] listen to. Not everything that has the
[1:00:12] name of Christian is good. I grew up in
[1:00:15] a background where I loved some hip-hop.
[1:00:18] 50 Cent, Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre. I used to
[1:00:21] love that stuff. That that was my that
[1:00:22] was my stuff. But then when I got
[1:00:25] converted, I lost a desire. Amen. And I
[1:00:27] remember people will sometimes will talk
[1:00:30] about Christian
[1:00:31] rap. I'm like, Christian rap. I'm like,
[1:00:36] I heard it and I was like, this sounds
[1:00:38] like the same beat, same delivery, same
[1:00:42] spirit, but yet just Jesus.
[1:00:45] It's like, what's the difference? What's
[1:00:47] the difference to me? I'm like, I might
[1:00:48] as well just be living in Dr. Dre cuz
[1:00:50] it's the same spirit as rap. Rap has
[1:00:53] that same spirit. Even even they try to
[1:00:56] put the name of Christian on Christian
[1:00:57] heavy metal. There's no such thing.
[1:01:00] Christian heavy rock. There's no such
[1:01:01] thing. They probably got Christian uh
[1:01:04] techno for all I know. So it's like you
[1:01:07] can't put you can't just slap a name of
[1:01:08] Christ on there
[1:01:10] because I you just can't man. I'm sorry.
[1:01:13] It's just I'm not for that Christian
[1:01:15] rock, Christian rap. I I can't do it
[1:01:17] because it sounds like Well, I used to
[1:01:18] love that stuff in the world. It sounds
[1:01:20] the same. You just changing the name.
[1:01:22] That's all you doing. That's all. That's
[1:01:23] like a sheep in a a wolf in sheep's
[1:01:25] clothing. What's the difference? Same
[1:01:27] thing. You got like Kanye West making
[1:01:30] gospel albums. Snoop Dogg making gospel
[1:01:32] albums. We going to listen to that. No,
[1:01:34] I ain't going to listen. I know what
[1:01:34] life he live. I know what things he get
[1:01:36] into. So, I I ain't for that.
[1:01:41] The only way you can be salty is that
[1:01:43] the life of Christ be in you. For he is
[1:01:44] that salt only saves as it
[1:01:48] contexts. So, I like this quote. Um, if
[1:01:52] you don't stand for something, you'll
[1:01:53] fall for anything. So, I like that. Now,
[1:01:56] some people may take that take that a
[1:01:58] different way. Oh, I can stand. No, no,
[1:01:59] no, no. Take a stand for Christ. So, you
[1:02:01] won't fall for anything. Cuz a lot
[1:02:03] people don't take a stand now. And
[1:02:04] that's why there's so many people, they
[1:02:06] don't have identities. They don't know
[1:02:08] who they want to be. They trying to act
[1:02:10] like this group of friends, that group
[1:02:11] of friends, but yet they never find
[1:02:13] satisfaction because they're never
[1:02:14] trying to be themselves. God didn't make
[1:02:16] you to be like somebody else. He only
[1:02:18] made you to be like him. I'm say it
[1:02:19] again. He made you to be like him. Not
[1:02:22] like I'm not God didn't call me like
[1:02:23] brother Solomon. Brother Solomon's
[1:02:25] brother Solomon. Brother Solomon has a
[1:02:27] purpose in calling. I have a purpose in
[1:02:28] calling. You have a purpose in calling.
[1:02:29] So we're not here to be duplicates of
[1:02:31] each other. Cuz if if if we had all
[1:02:34] brother Marks, you guys would be
[1:02:37] scared. One's
[1:02:41] enough. All right. So Daniel was willing
[1:02:43] to take a stand. The Bible said he
[1:02:45] purposed in his heart. So, young people,
[1:02:48] uh, olderly youth people, I don't want
[1:02:50] to call you guys old. Uh, so you gota,
[1:02:52] we all got a purpose in our heart
[1:02:54] constantly because the devil is
[1:02:56] constantly trying to sidetrack you. He's
[1:02:58] trying to get you off the beaten path.
[1:03:00] And so, we really have, especially in
[1:03:02] this day and age, Satan knows his time
[1:03:05] is short. So, he's pulling out all his
[1:03:07] tricks. He's pulling out his whole
[1:03:09] arsenal. He's going to throw everything
[1:03:11] at you in the kitchen sink. And we got
[1:03:14] to be aware and ready for it cuz he's
[1:03:16] going to come in like Mike Ty. You
[1:03:18] remember Mike Tyson in his prime? He
[1:03:20] going to come in just like that and you
[1:03:22] got to block and then counter him just
[1:03:24] like that. And so we got just like when
[1:03:26] people got accustomed to Mike Tyson, he
[1:03:28] started to lose him more. So same thing
[1:03:29] with the devil. We got to get accustomed
[1:03:30] to the devil. See how he moves. Study
[1:03:32] him so we can we can go on the offensive
[1:03:34] and knock him out cuz that devil
[1:03:37] deserves a punch in his mouth. Knock him
[1:03:39] on his butt now. cuz he he he has no he
[1:03:43] has no right to be tormenting you. You
[1:03:46] say boot devil. Boot devil.
[1:03:51] Amen. So Daniel's willing to take a
[1:03:53] stand among all the peer pressure.
[1:03:54] There's going to be peer pressure young
[1:03:55] people in your life. It's going to come
[1:03:57] strong cuz the devil is scared of you
[1:04:00] getting to Christ. He is terrified of
[1:04:03] you getting to Christ. He's shaking in
[1:04:05] his boots right now. So that's why he's
[1:04:07] going to throw every temptation, every
[1:04:09] uh everything he can at you. Popularity,
[1:04:13] friends, money, drugs, vaping, all that
[1:04:17] stuff he's going to throw at you. I
[1:04:19] believe I believe that Daniel had the
[1:04:20] same revelation that Moses did. He knew
[1:04:22] that sin only lasted for a season. We
[1:04:26] got all these millionaires out here. We
[1:04:27] got all these people just uh Tik Tok
[1:04:30] influencers and they live. I was I was
[1:04:32] um I saw this one interview with uh Jake
[1:04:35] Paul. Paul, I don't even know who Jake
[1:04:36] Paul is. And just the way he was talking
[1:04:38] was just like I was like talking about,
[1:04:41] oh, my my therapist said this and said
[1:04:44] this. I'm like, bro, you still
[1:04:45] struggling with what you got. Your
[1:04:47] therapist just is have you looking over
[1:04:48] here so you don't notice that thing over
[1:04:50] there. So, I'm I'm not a big fan
[1:04:52] personally in going to therapist because
[1:04:55] if you go to a worldly therapist, you're
[1:04:57] you're taking uh their thoughts and nine
[1:05:00] times out of 10, they're not going to
[1:05:01] tell you biblical thoughts. Right now,
[1:05:04] now if your therapist is a true
[1:05:05] Christian, then I'll say, "Okay, that's
[1:05:07] fine." But if you go into a worldly
[1:05:08] therapist, you're going to get worldly
[1:05:10] thoughts. And if you have, and the thing
[1:05:12] is spirits, you can't you can't solve a
[1:05:15] spiritual problem with a worldly
[1:05:17] thought. Only God can can give you that
[1:05:20] that victory over that. And like you
[1:05:22] said, we got all these like brother
[1:05:23] Jack, all these podcasts, all these
[1:05:25] things, oh, you need to do this, you
[1:05:27] need to uh motivate yourself to do this
[1:05:29] and do that. Motivation is always going
[1:05:31] to be there. right? It's not going to be
[1:05:33] there. That's why the joy of the Lord is
[1:05:34] your strength. Yes, sir. Cuz we all can
[1:05:36] get in a state of depression. It's
[1:05:38] possible. But we have a way out of it.
[1:05:40] It's God. God is the only way. You can
[1:05:43] go to How many alcoholics um we've seen
[1:05:46] that they need to go to Aaou meetings
[1:05:47] and if they don't, they fall over or or
[1:05:49] they see alcohol, they they they like,
[1:05:51] "No, no, no, no. The God I serve when I
[1:05:54] got delivered from something in my
[1:05:55] life." Yes, sir. I lost all desire. I
[1:05:58] could see it in my face and I'll turn
[1:05:59] walk right away. That's true
[1:06:01] deliverance. Yes, sir. That's that's
[1:06:02] true deliverance. Cuz what this world
[1:06:04] needs isn't influencers. It needs uh a
[1:06:07] deliverer. It needs Jesus Christ. Let
[1:06:11] Jesus Christ change your life. He is
[1:06:13] going to influence, but he going to
[1:06:14] change your life completely. He said
[1:06:16] he'll make you new, new creatures in
[1:06:18] Christ. That what we need is a newness.
[1:06:20] We don't need something that doesn't
[1:06:21] work. as much medical technology we
[1:06:24] have, as much uh the AI that we have,
[1:06:26] but yet we still have how much more
[1:06:29] anxiety, depression, like it's never
[1:06:31] been before. Kids are just just being
[1:06:34] eaten alive by depression, anxiety, and
[1:06:36] fear. Eating alive. Uh adults being
[1:06:39] eaten alive. Um mental illnesses is
[1:06:41] coming like crazy. It shows me the the
[1:06:44] more we get uh advanced, the further we
[1:06:46] get away from God. And we got to get
[1:06:49] back to the basics. Get back to the
[1:06:51] ABCs. It's always been Christ. And
[1:06:53] that's what's going to solve your
[1:06:54] problem. I don't care how many good
[1:06:56] books you read about this and about
[1:06:58] that. They can't help you. It's not.
[1:07:00] It's not. They just they just words on a
[1:07:01] page. This book right here is life. This
[1:07:04] book right here will change you. If you
[1:07:06] got depression, it will deliver you. If
[1:07:08] you got alcoholism, it will deliver you.
[1:07:10] If if you got a a woman problem, a man
[1:07:12] problem, it will deliver you. This book
[1:07:14] is the only book in the entire world
[1:07:16] that can answer every single problem
[1:07:18] that you have. cancer. It will heal you.
[1:07:20] That guy's an answer to everything you
[1:07:22] can think of. Everything. Not one thing
[1:07:24] is left unturned.
[1:07:26] But a lot of people don't want God. They
[1:07:29] want to find a different route. I I've
[1:07:31] learned that sometimes in life, we will
[1:07:33] try to do the most not to work hard, but
[1:07:36] yet we'll work harder by not working
[1:07:38] harder. Literally, we'll work harder by
[1:07:40] not working harder. Just do the simple
[1:07:42] thing. Try Jesus. Try Jesus. Try him. I
[1:07:46] I guarantee you won't regret it. Right.
[1:07:48] Amen.
[1:07:50] He was not willing. So, Daniel wasn't
[1:07:51] willing to miss his opportunity of
[1:07:53] eternal life. He was willing to take a
[1:07:55] stand. I love I remember um one of my
[1:07:58] co-workers back in the day. I was I
[1:08:00] witnessed to him one time. He said,
[1:08:01] "Man, I'm going to hell. I don't care."
[1:08:03] I was like, "Bro, hell hell ain't going
[1:08:05] to be no party. You ain't going to be
[1:08:06] partying every techno." Nah, you going
[1:08:08] to be burning. Like, it ain't like that.
[1:08:10] People think, "Oh, hell going to be, oh,
[1:08:11] I'm going to be dancing and partying."
[1:08:12] No, no, no, no, no, no. You going to be
[1:08:14] in torment. There's no such thing as
[1:08:16] that. No such thing as it. I forgot to
[1:08:18] set my timer.
[1:08:21] All right, so let's um let's keep it
[1:08:23] going. I want you to also notice that
[1:08:24] God gave Daniel favor. So I just love
[1:08:27] how God will give his children favor
[1:08:30] with people you don't even think could
[1:08:31] give you favor with. I I just love that.
[1:08:33] So he didn't he didn't compromise his
[1:08:35] beliefs to try to get favor, but God
[1:08:37] gave him favor because he was faithful
[1:08:39] to his calling and to his to and to God.
[1:08:42] So don't try to be somebody else. Don't
[1:08:44] don't try to impress the boss. I see a
[1:08:46] lot of people at work. I ain't going to
[1:08:47] say nobody's names, but they they they
[1:08:49] like they like like the teachers pet.
[1:08:51] They walking behind the boss. Yes, boss.
[1:08:53] And this like a puppet. I'm not a
[1:08:56] puppet. God didn't make me a puppet. I'm
[1:08:58] I'm I'm sorry. If if you if you want to
[1:09:00] get promoted like that, go right ahead.
[1:09:02] I'm not me. If God has a job for you,
[1:09:04] for me, then he can open the door. I'm
[1:09:07] not gonna have to walk around and be a
[1:09:08] yes man. No, no, no. That's not who God
[1:09:10] made me to be. I'm not a yes man. Uh
[1:09:12] God, if God wants me to have that job,
[1:09:14] I'll get that job. It don't matter if a
[1:09:16] hundred people apply for it. If job has
[1:09:18] it for you, if God has it for you, it'll
[1:09:20] be open just for you. And nobody nobody
[1:09:22] else can take it. No matter how bad they
[1:09:24] want to take it. Simple as that. Amen.
[1:09:27] All right. The devil will always want
[1:09:28] you to compromise with the word of God.
[1:09:30] Always. Do you know why? Because he
[1:09:32] knows where your strength lies. He know
[1:09:35] that you can't defeat him, but he knows
[1:09:36] if you get lost and hidden in this word,
[1:09:39] then he is powerless against you.
[1:09:41] He's powerless. So that's what happened
[1:09:43] at the garden and that's what happened
[1:09:44] to Samson. Samson took his eyes off of
[1:09:48] the word. God spoke to him and said, "Do
[1:09:50] not cut your hair." Same thing today. We
[1:09:53] know a woman's hair is their Nazerite.
[1:09:56] And so that's why we don't women don't
[1:09:58] cut their hair for a reason. It's given
[1:09:59] to you for glory. Even the Bible says
[1:10:02] it's you dishonor your head if you cut
[1:10:04] it. So God gave your hair for a reason.
[1:10:07] It's your glory. God loves your hair
[1:10:10] long. Don't cut it. That's what that's
[1:10:13] how God ordained it. You lose you lose
[1:10:16] your strength if you cut it. Let's keep
[1:10:18] going. Our investments. So Daniel
[1:10:21] knowing that the world was going to come
[1:10:23] into the church and it did. That's a man
[1:10:26] that's today. We have all these big
[1:10:29] glass stained windows, mega churches, uh
[1:10:32] saying we believe in God, but yet God
[1:10:34] ain't even in their service. It's more
[1:10:36] of a concert. It's it's more of a
[1:10:38] entertainment show than it is uh the
[1:10:40] God's house. The modern day Pharisees
[1:10:43] and Sadducees even they worse actually.
[1:10:45] I think they I think at least the at
[1:10:47] least God said that the Pharisees has
[1:10:50] some sort of righteousness. He said if
[1:10:51] you're righteous exceed the
[1:10:52] righteousness of the Pharisees. At least
[1:10:54] the Pharisees has some sort of
[1:10:55] righteousness. Now today people don't
[1:10:57] even care. Dress any old kind of way.
[1:10:59] Hang let everything hang out in church
[1:11:02] and call yourself Christian. I never
[1:11:04] understood that God didn't call you to
[1:11:06] be like the world. He didn't call you to
[1:11:08] pattern off the world, but he called you
[1:11:09] to be like him. Amen. Let's keep it
[1:11:13] going. So, um, he took out one of these
[1:11:16] eternal life policies with God. And he
[1:11:18] purposed in his heart that he would not
[1:11:20] mar his investments. Amen. that church
[1:11:22] of the businessman. If people could only
[1:11:24] take that attitude, if God if you could
[1:11:27] only work to that end, that achievement
[1:11:28] and you'll not defile the investments
[1:11:30] you made in Christ with the things of
[1:11:32] the world and the glamour. Why? Anything
[1:11:34] can shine and glow. He says it again.
[1:11:36] And what reaches for a monkey. Don't be
[1:11:39] a monkey, please. That's right. Monkeys
[1:11:41] always reaching after something that's
[1:11:44] shiny. That's right. Noticed we are.
[1:11:47] That's what I mean. The devil will make
[1:11:49] monkeys out of Don't let the devil make
[1:11:51] a monkey out of you. I don't want to see
[1:11:52] y'all monkey be monkey monkeys. I don't
[1:11:53] want to see anybody in here be a monkey.
[1:11:55] Not Not one of y'all be monkeys. Y'all
[1:11:56] be reaching at God has something way
[1:11:58] better for what you're reaching for. God
[1:12:00] has something way better for what you're
[1:12:02] trying to reach for. Amen.
[1:12:04] If he can't, he's trying to make you
[1:12:06] think that you will come from one
[1:12:07] anyhow. See, with their educational
[1:12:10] system, things of this day, science is
[1:12:11] always trying to disprove God. Always.
[1:12:13] I'm like, y'all can't disprove God. I
[1:12:16] mean, they tried it in Noah's day. They
[1:12:19] drowned. Yes, sir. So,
[1:12:22] I And true science is God anyway because
[1:12:25] I mean, if you want to think about it,
[1:12:26] true science, these science tried to try
[1:12:28] a big bang theory. No, no, no. I didn't
[1:12:30] just The world just didn't blow up like
[1:12:32] that. No, no, no, no, no, no. All right,
[1:12:35] let's keep it going. All right, so um
[1:12:36] investments uh 1963. The Hebrew children
[1:12:39] was determined. They said, "All the rest
[1:12:41] of them are bowing when the flutes sound
[1:12:43] and when the bishops say stomp and the
[1:12:45] holy roller, the froggy jump." And he
[1:12:47] said, "We're not going to do it. You
[1:12:48] might do it. You're able to burn us up.
[1:12:50] You're able to kick us out. You're able
[1:12:52] to do this or do this the other, but
[1:12:54] we'll not bow down to your image
[1:12:56] anyhow." They wasn't going to defile
[1:12:59] that investment. It was going to the
[1:13:01] word, and the word they was going to
[1:13:03] stand on. And when the time came to make
[1:13:05] a decision, they was going to stand by
[1:13:08] the word. saved their lives. It had a
[1:13:11] fourth man down there. And I tell you,
[1:13:13] that fourth man will always be down
[1:13:15] there for you. When you take a stand for
[1:13:18] God, that fourth man will always be
[1:13:20] there to fight for you. Always.
[1:13:25] Always. Let's talk about another young
[1:13:28] person, a young person who didn't take a
[1:13:29] stand for Christ. We'll go our scripture
[1:13:31] reading in Mark 10. Brother Brandham
[1:13:33] mentioned this this young man many times
[1:13:36] o in the course of his ministry.
[1:13:40] And this man had the one of the greatest
[1:13:43] opportunities that any young person
[1:13:45] could ever have. And that was to
[1:13:47] literally meet Jesus Christ face to
[1:13:50] face. Man, that would be man. And
[1:13:54] he he defiled his investment. He didn't
[1:13:56] even make an investment. He he denied
[1:13:58] the investment.
[1:14:00] All right. Let's go to um Mark 10:1 17.
[1:14:03] And when he was gone forth into the way,
[1:14:05] they carried one running. He was running
[1:14:07] and kneel to him and asked him, "Good
[1:14:09] master, what shall I do that I may in
[1:14:12] inherit eternal life?" And Jesus said
[1:14:14] unto him, "Why callst thou me good?
[1:14:16] There is none good but one that is
[1:14:20] God. Thou thou knowest the commandments.
[1:14:22] Do not commit adultery. Do not kill. Do
[1:14:24] not steal. Do not bear false witness.
[1:14:26] Defraud not honor thy father honor sorry
[1:14:29] defraud not honor thy father and thy
[1:14:31] mother." And he answered and said unto
[1:14:33] him, "Master, all these things I
[1:14:34] observed from my youth." So this man
[1:14:36] wasn't wasn't a womanizer, but he was a
[1:14:39] a good faithful church member. Followed
[1:14:41] the commandments, respected his parents.
[1:14:44] He was a good person. Probably gave to
[1:14:46] the poor. We're not talking to some some
[1:14:49] heathen or or or like legion, but we're
[1:14:51] talking to a man who read his Bible,
[1:14:53] listened to what the priest had to say,
[1:14:55] and he had something in his heart that
[1:14:57] he knew he was missing something.
[1:15:00] Something in his life was missing. And
[1:15:02] he knew that Jesus had it, right? He saw
[1:15:05] something different about Jesus that
[1:15:07] other people didn't want to see. So he
[1:15:09] saw something different than what his
[1:15:10] priest was talking about. He he noticed
[1:15:12] that Jesus had something that no other
[1:15:15] man had. And he said and he answered
[1:15:18] said unto him, "Master, all these have I
[1:15:20] observed from my youth up." Then Jesus
[1:15:22] Then Jesus beholding him loved him and
[1:15:25] said unto him, "One thing thou lackest."
[1:15:27] He one thing that's it. One thing one
[1:15:31] thing was holding him from eternal life.
[1:15:33] Same thing could happen in our life. One
[1:15:35] thing could be hold you back from making
[1:15:37] it to the rapture. Don't let that one
[1:15:39] thing stop you from making it to the
[1:15:41] rapture. It will be the biggest regret
[1:15:43] you ever had in your life if one thing
[1:15:46] stopped you. And this man, we're going
[1:15:47] to say, we're going to pick up where
[1:15:48] this man went uh later
[1:15:51] on. Um let's see. Then then Jesus
[1:15:55] beholding him loved him and said unto
[1:15:57] him, "One thing thou lackest, go thy
[1:15:59] way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give
[1:16:02] to the poor." and thou shalt have
[1:16:03] treasure in heaven. And come and take up
[1:16:06] thy cross and follow me. And he and he
[1:16:10] was sad at that saying and went away
[1:16:11] grieved, for he had great possessions. I
[1:16:15] a wise man once told me, "If you can't
[1:16:17] let go of it, you probably shouldn't
[1:16:18] have it. If you can't let go of it, you
[1:16:21] probably shouldn't have it." So there's
[1:16:23] a reason why Jesus asked him to get rid
[1:16:25] of it because he was worshiping like a
[1:16:28] god. Money was his god. And now you're
[1:16:30] probably saying, "Brother Mark, I'm not
[1:16:32] rich." But you still can have an idol in
[1:16:35] your life. It could be popularity. It
[1:16:38] could be a career. It could be a fancy
[1:16:40] car you want later down the road. It
[1:16:42] could be a fashion. It could be it could
[1:16:44] be numerous amounts of things. So be
[1:16:47] careful what you look into.
[1:16:50] Don't Don't fall don't worship it like
[1:16:52] God cuz God is a jealous God. And that's
[1:16:56] why he asked this young man because he
[1:16:58] knew that he couldn't serve Jesus and
[1:17:00] his money at the same time. The Bible
[1:17:02] says, "Don't serve God a mammon. You
[1:17:03] can't. It's
[1:17:04] impossible." Let's keep going. And Jesus
[1:17:07] looked around about and saith unto the
[1:17:10] disciples, "How hardly shall they that
[1:17:12] have riches enter the kingdom of God?"
[1:17:14] So I I want to just point this out. So
[1:17:16] now you're probably saying, "Brother
[1:17:17] Mark, I I can't I can't have wealth and
[1:17:19] riches." I'm not saying that. What I'm
[1:17:21] saying is this, that look at Solomon.
[1:17:25] God bless Solomon. What did Solomon pray
[1:17:27] for? Not one thing about riches. He
[1:17:30] said, "Lord, wisdom to help your
[1:17:32] people." And he said, "Solomon says, you
[1:17:35] didn't ask for not one thing about
[1:17:36] riches. I'm going to bless you with
[1:17:37] riches." Abraham, God blessed him.
[1:17:40] David, God blessed him. So, it's a
[1:17:42] difference because he's talking about
[1:17:44] people who seek after riches. We got
[1:17:46] millionaires. You you got Bill Gates.
[1:17:49] You got uh many many millionaires. You
[1:17:52] could you could name Jeff Bezos. These
[1:17:55] people worship money. They worship
[1:17:57] money. And so that's what he's talking
[1:17:59] about cuz they worship. They they ain't
[1:18:00] willing to give it up. I could care less
[1:18:02] if I'm ever rich or not. I could care
[1:18:05] less about
[1:18:07] it. Cuz to me, God is more important
[1:18:09] than money. God said to supply all my
[1:18:11] needs according to his riches and glory.
[1:18:13] He promised that. He promised that to
[1:18:15] me. He'll supply every not my wants
[1:18:17] necessarily, but my needs. What I need.
[1:18:20] I'm not saying God can't make you a
[1:18:22] millionaire. I'm not saying that. But
[1:18:23] I'm just saying don't be striving after.
[1:18:25] Don't be falling in love with it. If God
[1:18:27] bless you a million dollars, praise the
[1:18:28] Lord. I'll be like, "Thank you, Lord."
[1:18:31] Let's keep going. And disciples were
[1:18:33] astonished at his words. But Jesus
[1:18:34] answered again and said unto them,
[1:18:36] "Children, how hard is it for them that
[1:18:38] trust in riches to enter into the
[1:18:40] kingdom of God?" Can you pull that
[1:18:41] picture for me,
[1:18:42] sister? And he said, "It is easier for a
[1:18:45] camel to go through the eye of a needle
[1:18:47] than for a rich man to enter into the
[1:18:48] kingdom of God." So I I want you to I
[1:18:50] want to put this like I want to put this
[1:18:52] so you guys can visualize this. It's not
[1:18:54] some needle, but a needle is this little
[1:18:56] door right here. So back in the day when
[1:18:58] a camel would enter, he would have to
[1:19:01] unload everything, go on his knees, and
[1:19:04] cross. I'm read this right here. The
[1:19:05] photo above is a similar gate in
[1:19:07] Nazareth. Illustrates the eye of the
[1:19:08] needle gate. Well, you can see that a
[1:19:11] camel could not pass through the gate
[1:19:14] unless first had all of it bagged,
[1:19:17] removed, and then stopped to get through
[1:19:18] the gate. So, sometimes we have things
[1:19:20] in our life that is stopping us from
[1:19:23] going through the eye of the needle. And
[1:19:25] we got to let go. We We got to take it
[1:19:28] off. We got to purge it so we can walk
[1:19:30] with Christ the way he wants us to walk.
[1:19:32] So, that if that camel had to do it,
[1:19:35] then so we got to do it, too. Because
[1:19:37] the way God is calling you is a straight
[1:19:39] and narrow way and you can't take a lot
[1:19:42] of things with you when you're walking
[1:19:44] with Christ. So things we got to
[1:19:46] sometimes dreams we got to push aside
[1:19:48] sometimes friends we got to leave all
[1:19:50] these things I I left many good friends
[1:19:52] not purposely but like when you're
[1:19:54] living the life of Christ your friends
[1:19:57] will slowly just walk away from you
[1:19:59] because there's two different spirits.
[1:20:00] You got the spirit of Christ and the
[1:20:01] spirit of the world. Simple. I lost a I
[1:20:04] had a best friend that was I known since
[1:20:06] high school and I haven't talked to him.
[1:20:09] He just he just proposed. I didn't know
[1:20:11] he had a girlfriend he proposed to. I
[1:20:12] didn't even know. I found on Facebook. I
[1:20:14] was like, "Okay, see." And I I haven't
[1:20:16] talked to him. I I try to contact him.
[1:20:19] Every time I would like, you know, um
[1:20:20] back I would try to, you know, reach out
[1:20:22] to him. He stopped being my friend
[1:20:24] because I I I just tell him the truth.
[1:20:26] You know, you need the Lord, man. And he
[1:20:29] would try to tell the same dirty jokes
[1:20:30] back in there. I'm like, "I'm sorry,
[1:20:31] man. I don't I don't tell jelly jokes
[1:20:34] anymore. I'm sorry. I'm not in that
[1:20:35] stuff anymore. I'm sorry, man. And it
[1:20:37] just it just wouldn't be as fun anymore.
[1:20:39] I would drink with them back in the day.
[1:20:41] Stop drinking. So, we lost the the
[1:20:44] things we had in common.
[1:20:46] And I like I'm And I didn't tell him,
[1:20:48] hey, I mean, I'm not doing this, but I
[1:20:49] just I was like, hey, I'm sorry, man. I
[1:20:50] don't drink anymore, man. I wouldn't
[1:20:52] laugh at the jokes. I'm sorry, man. I
[1:20:53] don't laugh in the jokes anymore. I'm
[1:20:55] sorry. It's just not who I am anymore.
[1:20:58] All right. So, let's keep it going. So,
[1:21:00] we see this young man rejected the very
[1:21:02] word that he claimed to follow. That
[1:21:04] that's crazy to me. People reject the
[1:21:07] very word that they're following. Same
[1:21:10] thing the Pharisees did. They really
[1:21:12] crucified the word of God that they they
[1:21:14] claim to read every morning, every day.
[1:21:16] And the same thing today, people are
[1:21:18] saying, "Oh, I'm a Christian. Oh, I'm
[1:21:20] this." But yet, you're living like the
[1:21:22] living like a devil, right?
[1:21:24] What sense is
[1:21:26] that? He rejected eternal life to follow
[1:21:29] a false god. This this rich man, he made
[1:21:31] riches and fame and fortune, his god. We
[1:21:34] see he knew he lacked something. He knew
[1:21:36] that he was missing something because
[1:21:37] even he went to church and believed in
[1:21:39] God, followed the commandments, was a
[1:21:40] good person, but yet he was still
[1:21:42] missing something. People still make the
[1:21:44] same mistake today. We see they go to
[1:21:46] church, but they never get to know who
[1:21:48] Jesus is personally. Never. They just go
[1:21:51] to church and learn, but never let Jesus
[1:21:54] into their heart. See, it's one thing
[1:21:55] knowing about Jesus, but it's different
[1:21:57] knowing Jesus because I can know about
[1:22:00] this person. I can hear stories about
[1:22:01] him. I But if I don't ever get to meet
[1:22:04] that person and know who he is, I'll
[1:22:05] never know who he truly is. I'll just
[1:22:07] know stories. Like if I just heard
[1:22:09] stories about testimonies of your life,
[1:22:11] but I never experienced a testimony. I
[1:22:14] don't know who Jesus is for myself. The
[1:22:15] testimony sounds amazing to me, but if I
[1:22:17] never experienced a personal experience
[1:22:19] with God, I'll never know who he truly
[1:22:21] is until I meet with him.
[1:22:24] So, let's keep it going.
[1:22:26] Um, see, a lot of people follow the
[1:22:28] golden rule. Oh, I'm a good person. The
[1:22:30] golden rule is good, but that is a
[1:22:33] ticket to heaven. The golden rule ain't
[1:22:35] a ticket to heaven. You should follow
[1:22:36] the golden rule. Yes. People say, "Oh, I
[1:22:38] believe in Jesus, but has to go so much
[1:22:41] deeper than that. So much deeper. Is he
[1:22:44] on the throne of your heart?" That's the
[1:22:46] question. Is he the center of your life?
[1:22:48] Is he your all and all? Is he your
[1:22:50] everything? Let's keep it going. read a
[1:22:52] quote and then we'll hop in. We'll see
[1:22:54] what this this uh rich young man went to
[1:22:55] after this. But the the prince that this
[1:22:58] young fellow was asked to pay was too
[1:22:59] great. He had to sell out. Are you
[1:23:01] willing to to wait it out for a husband
[1:23:03] or wife? Are you willing to wait it out?
[1:23:06] Don't don't don't just go based upon
[1:23:07] looks cuz looks will fade. It's what's
[1:23:10] in here that's going to last forever.
[1:23:13] Cuz many people make that. That's why uh
[1:23:14] this world is filled with so much
[1:23:16] divorce cuz people going after how they
[1:23:18] make me feel physically. Oh, are they
[1:23:20] funny? this and that. They ain't looking
[1:23:22] at what's inside of here because when
[1:23:24] you look inside of here, you'll see that
[1:23:26] person truth. A lot of a lot of times
[1:23:27] people don't pray about it. Pray about
[1:23:29] it. Don't just go Don't just go and
[1:23:32] waste your time. Cuz I I'm a firm
[1:23:36] believer that our time is so important.
[1:23:38] Pray about things. Say, "God, help me.
[1:23:41] Help me to notice. Help me to be ready
[1:23:43] for when the time comes that I'm ready
[1:23:45] to court. I'm ready to have a
[1:23:47] relationship." Because a relationship is
[1:23:49] a lot. And you want to make sure that
[1:23:51] God is in both lives. You want to make
[1:23:53] sure that person has a actual personal
[1:23:55] walk with God because if not, you're
[1:23:57] taking a gamble. And if you want to
[1:24:00] gamble, there's casino over there. But
[1:24:02] we ain't gambling over there. So that's
[1:24:04] what it's doing. That's literally when
[1:24:05] you gamble with somebody's not the
[1:24:06] world, you might as well just step in
[1:24:08] that big guitar, say, "Here, take my
[1:24:10] money." That's the same same way. That's
[1:24:11] what you're doing. When you say, "Oh,
[1:24:13] I'm going to try this person
[1:24:14] out." You you might as well look at that
[1:24:17] guitar and say, "Here, take my money.
[1:24:19] It's it's a dangerous it's a dangerous
[1:24:21] thing to do. Um because God gives us
[1:24:25] wisdom for a reason and we got to use
[1:24:28] that wisdom. I don't care how good the
[1:24:30] girl looks. I don't care how beautiful
[1:24:31] she is. I don't care if she got hair
[1:24:33] down to here and make sure she's the
[1:24:37] real thing. Because a lot of people will
[1:24:40] do putons and when you get married to
[1:24:42] them then they show off. Yes, sir. I
[1:24:45] even said this. You can marry a person
[1:24:47] could be a good person necessarily not a
[1:24:50] believer and you marry him and then the
[1:24:51] devil will change that person. Brother
[1:24:54] Jack mentioned that uh in Jubilee the uh
[1:24:56] the the uh boss could be good to the to
[1:24:58] the slave and then he decides to stay
[1:25:01] and then the boss just changes. Same
[1:25:03] thing relationship that person might not
[1:25:06] be good anymore. Devil might get a hold
[1:25:07] of him and and just run havoc in your
[1:25:09] life. Then you get a divorce and then
[1:25:12] maybe you have kids. Now the kids suffer
[1:25:15] because you decided not to pray about
[1:25:17] it. You decided not to see the person's
[1:25:19] life. And now the kids are not going to
[1:25:20] have a a family dynamic. They're going
[1:25:22] to have a separate dynamic. And that's
[1:25:24] not fair to the kids. We don't realize
[1:25:26] that every decision you make is going to
[1:25:28] impact not only you but your friends,
[1:25:30] your family, your kids. And those
[1:25:33] decisions are important. Be careful who
[1:25:35] you invest your I'm say again. Be
[1:25:36] careful who you invest your time with.
[1:25:39] Be careful because you can't get that
[1:25:42] time back. It's not like stocks. I I can
[1:25:45] lose money and gain money, but time you
[1:25:47] can't lose and gain it. Once you lose
[1:25:50] it, it's gone forever.
[1:25:52] Let's go to Luke 16 verse
[1:25:56] 19. Luke 16. Sorry. Luke 16 19. We'll
[1:26:00] see where this this rich young ruler
[1:26:02] came from. We'll see where he came where
[1:26:03] he where he went. I said 16:19. Okay.
[1:26:08] All right. All right, let's let's uh
[1:26:08] we'll pick it up in verse 19. There was
[1:26:10] a certain rich man. So now we're picking
[1:26:12] up where this man is now. He's a rich
[1:26:15] man which was clothed in a purple and
[1:26:17] fine linen and fared simply every day.
[1:26:20] So we see this man still his riches
[1:26:23] continued. So now prosperity does not
[1:26:26] necessarily mean you're close with God.
[1:26:28] A lot of people think oh prosperity. So
[1:26:30] I can tell you you got TD Jake. Let me
[1:26:32] not mention names. You got this preacher
[1:26:34] over here, that preacher over here
[1:26:36] rolling in money, but they ain't on the
[1:26:39] word of God, right? So, it shows me that
[1:26:41] that prosperity isn't a sign that you're
[1:26:45] following God cuz there's a lot of
[1:26:47] millionaires out here. There's lots of
[1:26:49] millionaires all over the place. Uh
[1:26:51] YouTube uh stars get be are
[1:26:53] millionaires. Tik Tocker stars and
[1:26:55] millionaires. But does that mean they're
[1:26:56] serving God? No, it doesn't.
[1:26:59] So, and there was a certain beggar named
[1:27:01] Lazarus, which was laid at his gate full
[1:27:03] of sores, and desiring to be fed with
[1:27:05] the crumbs which fell from the rich
[1:27:06] man's table. Moreover, the dogs came and
[1:27:09] licked his sores. And it came to pass
[1:27:11] that the beggar died and was carried by
[1:27:13] the angels unto Abraham's bosom. The
[1:27:15] rich man also died and was buried. And
[1:27:17] in hell he lifted up his eyes, being in
[1:27:20] torment, uh, and seeth Abraham a far
[1:27:22] off, and Lazarus in his bosom. So now
[1:27:25] this man, I love how brother Brandon
[1:27:26] really brings it out. He said this man
[1:27:29] was probably patted on the back. Oh man,
[1:27:31] you're amazing. You're a man of God. You
[1:27:33] give to the poor. All these things. He
[1:27:35] was being his his um ego was being
[1:27:37] pumped up. But yet when it was his time
[1:27:40] to meet with his maker, he realized that
[1:27:43] he didn't live a life that he he
[1:27:44] realized that he made the biggest
[1:27:45] mistake of his life by rejecting Jesus
[1:27:48] Christ when he was young. He thought
[1:27:49] that, oh, I still go to church. I'm
[1:27:52] still a good person. I still wear a
[1:27:54] skirt. I still I don't wear this. I
[1:27:57] don't wear this. I don't wear makeup. It
[1:27:59] goes more than not just about make it
[1:28:00] goes more just about makeup and and
[1:28:02] skirts. It goes much deeper than that
[1:28:04] because whatever's on the outside is
[1:28:06] going to go on the inside. So don't
[1:28:08] don't don't be don't put a put on. God
[1:28:11] didn't call us to be actors.
[1:28:13] God didn't cause us to be actors.
[1:28:16] Let it be a true life. Don't do it
[1:28:18] because mom and dad said so. Because mom
[1:28:21] and dad, they're they have their own
[1:28:23] stand. You got to take a stand. Let's
[1:28:26] keep it going. In hell he lifted up his
[1:28:29] eyes being in torment and seeing Abraham
[1:28:31] a far off and Lazarus in the b his
[1:28:34] bosom. And he cried and said, "Father
[1:28:35] Abraham, have mercy on me." It was too
[1:28:37] late for mercy then. And send Lazarus
[1:28:40] that he may dip the tip of his finger in
[1:28:42] water and cool my tongue for I am in
[1:28:44] torment in this flame. So now to whoever
[1:28:47] now whoever thinks that hell is going to
[1:28:50] be amazing, he this man was in torment
[1:28:53] in flame. No parties, no no P Diddy
[1:28:57] parties, none of that junk, none of that
[1:28:59] stuff. None of that stuff was there.
[1:29:04] See? So, and cool that tongue off. I'm
[1:29:07] tormenting the flame. But Abraham said,
[1:29:09] "Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime
[1:29:11] receivest thy good things." So, he chose
[1:29:14] to receive all the good things on this
[1:29:17] side.
[1:29:18] And he decided that, oh, I'm going to
[1:29:20] enjoy I'm going to live my life to the
[1:29:22] fullest. People say back in my day I
[1:29:23] used to say yolo. I don't know if you
[1:29:24] guys remember that. That's my day said
[1:29:26] that. So you only live once. That's what
[1:29:28] it stands for. And the thing is it's
[1:29:30] true you only live once. But do you want
[1:29:33] to take that chance and be in hell? Cuz
[1:29:36] uh I I know for one thing for me I I
[1:29:40] lived a tiny bit of that life and it
[1:29:42] wasn't fun. No, it really wasn't fun. I
[1:29:44] mean it's not fun at all. It's actually
[1:29:46] very dangerous. Um you could kill
[1:29:49] somebody if you drive drunk. Um, if you
[1:29:51] if you underage drink, you can go to
[1:29:53] jail. There's many things. There's many
[1:29:55] risk you're running a lot lot. You could
[1:29:57] um when you go to party like that, you
[1:29:58] can wind up pregnant. Now you're a a
[1:30:01] teen a pregnant teen. It's like it's too
[1:30:03] it's too many risk right there. I'm
[1:30:05] looking at it's too many risk. I've
[1:30:06] always learned that you want to weigh
[1:30:08] out the pros and cons. And to me,
[1:30:09] there's way too many cons. And there's
[1:30:10] no pros. So, let's keep it going. All
[1:30:13] right. So um but Abraham said, "Remember
[1:30:15] that thou in thy lifetime receiveth thy
[1:30:17] good things, and likewise Lazarus evil
[1:30:19] things. But now he is comforted, and
[1:30:21] thou are tormented. And besides all
[1:30:24] this, between us you and there is a
[1:30:26] great gulf fixed, so that they would
[1:30:28] which pass from hence to you cannot,
[1:30:30] neither can they stand to us that would
[1:30:32] come from thence." Then he said, "I pray
[1:30:34] thee, therefore," it's a little too late
[1:30:36] to pray now. I think he waited a little
[1:30:38] too late to pray. So don't don't wait
[1:30:40] until too late to pray. I'll tell you
[1:30:41] that because uh we in torment ah God
[1:30:45] ain't going to hear that. The mercy is
[1:30:47] gone. Like like grace, God's grace is a
[1:30:52] is a span given from when you're born
[1:30:54] until the day you're called. Don't miss
[1:30:58] that. Don't miss He's on a mercy seat
[1:31:00] right now. Don't miss why he's on the
[1:31:02] mercy seat. Some people say, "Oh, I'm
[1:31:03] had a deathbed
[1:31:05] confession." Some people don't have a
[1:31:07] deathbed. They die instantly. young
[1:31:09] people dying all the time just like that
[1:31:10] instantly. Just like that. And so don't
[1:31:14] say, "Oh, I'm going to I'm going to live
[1:31:15] my life and then have a deathbed
[1:31:16] confession." Not everybody's going to
[1:31:18] get a chance like a thief on the cross.
[1:31:21] That's the truth. Tomorrow's never
[1:31:23] promised. And besides, uh, he says, "A
[1:31:26] gulf between us." This is verse 27. And
[1:31:29] he said, I pray thee therefore, father,
[1:31:31] thou would send him to my father's
[1:31:32] house, for I have five brethren that he
[1:31:34] may testify unto them, lest they also
[1:31:36] come into this place of torment. Abraham
[1:31:38] said to him, "They have Moses and the
[1:31:40] prophets, let them hear them." And he
[1:31:42] said, "Nay, Father Abraham, but if one
[1:31:44] went from unto them from the dead, they
[1:31:46] will repent." And he said unto him, "If
[1:31:49] they hear not Moses and the prophets,
[1:31:51] neither they will be persuaded though
[1:31:52] rose from one rose from the dead." I
[1:31:54] love how he said that because this man
[1:31:56] had Jesus Christ in front of him, he
[1:31:59] missed it. Pharisees had Jesus Christ
[1:32:01] and still missed it. So he's saying if
[1:32:04] they don't listen to the word of God,
[1:32:07] they definitely going to listen to one
[1:32:08] come from the dead. So I like if Jesus
[1:32:11] came today, people would miss it even
[1:32:14] worse
[1:32:15] cuz everybody uh Brother Brandham said
[1:32:17] there's over 900 Christian denominations
[1:32:20] in 1960s and now there's over 30,000. I
[1:32:24] don't know what the math is on that.
[1:32:25] That's that's a that's a big percentage.
[1:32:27] So 37 different type of denominations.
[1:32:29] You got first bath, you got first
[1:32:31] baptist, second baptist, third baptist,
[1:32:33] f first Methodist, second Methodist,
[1:32:34] third. Which one's right? There's three
[1:32:36] different ones in each category. You got
[1:32:39] you got a African-American Episcopal
[1:32:40] Methodist church. You got this and that.
[1:32:42] And I'm like, which one is right? You
[1:32:44] got churches only allow whites, only
[1:32:46] church allow blacks. It's like, where
[1:32:49] where is the unity at? God called for
[1:32:52] unity. If if if you have a church that
[1:32:54] that can't have unity,
[1:32:58] then God I read my Bible. God is about
[1:33:02] oneness. He's not about separation. Only
[1:33:05] thing you separate is from unbelief.
[1:33:07] That's the only thing you separate
[1:33:09] from. All right, let's keep it going.
[1:33:11] How am I on time? Oh, it's getting late.
[1:33:13] All right. His payoff came certainly. He
[1:33:15] had a great funeral service. No doubt
[1:33:17] some well trained. Give me five more
[1:33:18] minutes. I'll be done. I promise. I I
[1:33:21] want to lie to you. I'll try five
[1:33:22] minutes. No doubt some well-trained
[1:33:25] clergymen come and spoke. No matter I
[1:33:27] guess he had the Christian businessmen
[1:33:30] of Paulbearsers and he had the celebrity
[1:33:32] of the country out and maybe a
[1:33:33] government official that they half
[1:33:35] massed a flag for him. All the
[1:33:36] dignitaries was there and the pastor no
[1:33:38] doubt or that man the priest whoever
[1:33:40] preached his funeral preached such a
[1:33:42] sermon that would touch the people with
[1:33:44] how great this man even to the poor in
[1:33:46] the street he gave. Oh our brothers in
[1:33:48] heaven today. But Jesus said he lifted
[1:33:51] up his eyes in hell and saw the policyh
[1:33:53] hold of eternal life far off in the
[1:33:56] bosom of Abraham and he took the way
[1:33:58] with the Lord's despised few as Jesus
[1:34:01] said blessed are they when men shall
[1:34:03] persecute you in the chapter chapter uh
[1:34:05] fifth chapter of Matthew say all men are
[1:34:07] evil against you falsely for my name's
[1:34:09] sake blessed are the poor in spirit for
[1:34:11] theirs is the kingdom blessed are the
[1:34:13] meek they shall inherit the earth you're
[1:34:15] the policy of eternal life yet he
[1:34:16] remained a member of the church see how
[1:34:18] notice You say, "Did he?" Yes. How can I
[1:34:21] prove that, preacher? He said, "Father
[1:34:23] Abraham, Father Abraham, I pray thee to
[1:34:26] send that policy holder down here with
[1:34:28] just a little bit of water. These flames
[1:34:30] are tormenting me." Watch Abraham, a
[1:34:33] son, a professed Christian, professed
[1:34:34] believer, as you would call it. You had
[1:34:36] your opportunity. You offered the
[1:34:38] opportunity of the policy of eternal
[1:34:40] life, which would give you the assurance
[1:34:42] of coming here. But you turned it away.
[1:34:45] You wouldn't take it. Now this poor man
[1:34:47] yet he accepted it. Now he is comforted.
[1:34:50] Now you are the beggar. Wow. I didn't
[1:34:54] see that before reading that. He said
[1:34:55] now you are the beggar. So this man you
[1:34:57] saw begging every day. You had all these
[1:35:00] nice things, but now the roles are
[1:35:02] reversed. Now you're the beggar and now
[1:35:04] you can't get no handouts. There's no
[1:35:06] handouts in hell. He missed his handout.
[1:35:08] God gave him a handout and he chose to
[1:35:11] take it away. He said, "I don't I I
[1:35:13] don't want your food. I I don't want to
[1:35:15] I don't want eternal life. I don't want
[1:35:16] bread. I don't want the bread that comes
[1:35:17] down from heaven and makes me whole. And
[1:35:20] he got what he You reap what you
[1:35:22] sow. Same thing in our lives. Whatever
[1:35:25] you are reaping, whatever you will sow.
[1:35:27] If you're planting little, you'll plant
[1:35:29] little. If you're investing little in in
[1:35:31] your walk with Christ, you'll reap
[1:35:33] little with your walk with Christ. Oh, I
[1:35:35] love Brother B says, "Oh, don't let this
[1:35:38] happen to you, friends. Don't make the
[1:35:42] same mistake. The way assurance can come
[1:35:45] is by Christ. The assurance that you are
[1:35:48] saved, that you're a policyholder. Now,
[1:35:50] if you haven't got that, why not take
[1:35:52] it? I like this song. I think somebody
[1:35:55] in a message might have wrote it, but
[1:35:56] I'm going to read it. I'm not going to
[1:35:57] sing. I'm not a singer. So, it's called
[1:35:59] stand. So, it says, I decided to take a
[1:36:01] stand, not believing I would lose my
[1:36:04] best friend, but I rather live right
[1:36:06] than living than in hell and lift my
[1:36:09] eyes. Says, oh, God's children, just
[1:36:11] stand. Oh, stand. Tell someone you
[1:36:14] stand. Then it says, stand for holiness.
[1:36:16] Stand for righteousness. And be counted
[1:36:18] among the men that shall reign with him.
[1:36:21] You stand when friends are gone. When
[1:36:23] you're all alone and believe he shall
[1:36:25] receive his own. All right, we going we
[1:36:28] going to speed read a little bit in in
[1:36:31] John. We doing a little little speed
[1:36:33] reading a little bit because we're
[1:36:35] running out of time.
[1:36:37] All right, so we're going to go to John
[1:36:38] chapter 3. So I want to just I want to
[1:36:40] make this so important. Whoever is
[1:36:42] listening, young people, you must be
[1:36:47] born again. Amen. You must there's no
[1:36:51] back door. Jesus said he's the way, the
[1:36:54] life, and the truth. You must be born
[1:36:57] again. There's no substitute. There's no
[1:37:00] serum. The only serum is to be born
[1:37:03] again. Don't think that you're born
[1:37:05] again. I rather I rather be born again
[1:37:08] and not know it but strive to be be born
[1:37:10] again. I rather have that all day
[1:37:12] because when we get comfortable
[1:37:13] sometimes we don't strive. So let's go.
[1:37:16] Uh so Nicodemus coming to him start
[1:37:19] verse one. There was a man of the
[1:37:20] Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the
[1:37:22] Jews. The scain came to Jesus by night
[1:37:25] and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that
[1:37:27] thou a teacher come from God for no man
[1:37:29] can do these miracles except thou do
[1:37:32] except God be with him. And Jesus said
[1:37:34] unto him, "Verily, verily, I say unto
[1:37:37] thee, look, it says, except a man be
[1:37:40] born again, not maybe, except a man be
[1:37:44] born again, he cannot see the kingdom of
[1:37:46] God." He cannot see the kingdom of God
[1:37:49] unless he's born again, filled with the
[1:37:52] Holy Ghost, and sealed away until the
[1:37:54] his until the day of redemption.
[1:37:58] And let's we'll go to John 10, and we'll
[1:38:01] speed read. And Jesus said unto them
[1:38:03] again, "Verily, verily, I say unto you,
[1:38:05] I am the door. All that ever came before
[1:38:07] me are thieves and robbers, but the
[1:38:08] sheep did not hear him. I am the door.
[1:38:10] By me, if any man enter, and he shall be
[1:38:12] saved, and shall go in and out and find
[1:38:13] pasture." Look, look what the devil
[1:38:15] does. The thief come not, but to steal,
[1:38:17] to kill, and to destroy. That's all the
[1:38:19] devil wants to do in your life is to
[1:38:20] steal, kill, and destroy. Young people,
[1:38:22] if you listen to the devil, he will
[1:38:24] steal, kill, and destroy. You'll do
[1:38:27] things that you'll have regret. You'll
[1:38:28] have scars. you you'll be uh doing
[1:38:30] things with people you probably
[1:38:31] shouldn't be doing and you'll have
[1:38:33] regret. So don't listen to the devil.
[1:38:36] Follow God right now. Make a stand.
[1:38:39] Invite him to your heart right now. I am
[1:38:42] the good shepherd. The good shepherd
[1:38:43] giveth his life for the sheep. All
[1:38:44] right. So now I'm I'm going to All
[1:38:46] right. I'm have to stop. I'm going to
[1:38:47] read. We're going to read one more
[1:38:48] scripture. I'm I'm going to stop. Okay.
[1:38:51] There's only one way you can go through
[1:38:52] Jesus Christ. You have to have to go
[1:38:54] God's provided way. It's the only way to
[1:38:57] go. Any other way is death. and we'll go
[1:38:59] first kings and we'll close after this.
[1:39:02] All right. So
[1:39:05] f All right. I'm we'll read that in one
[1:39:07] more quote. So first Kings um we'll go
[1:39:11] 18:21. And Elijah came unto all the
[1:39:14] people and said, "How
[1:39:15] long halt you between two opinions?"
[1:39:18] Maybe some there's people here tonight
[1:39:20] maybe on a live stream. How long are you
[1:39:22] going to hawk between two two opinions?
[1:39:24] If the Lord be God, follow him. If if
[1:39:28] Baal be Ba, then follow him. And the
[1:39:30] people answer. So if God is God, follow
[1:39:33] him. Give him give him your heart. Give
[1:39:35] him your life right now. And we'll close
[1:39:37] on this quote here in um instance 1962.
[1:39:41] And you know that there were some of the
[1:39:43] borderline believers that stood close
[1:39:45] and listened halfway. Probably like that
[1:39:47] rich young ruler, but they said we
[1:39:49] better go up. We know he was a good old
[1:39:51] man if there would come such a thing.
[1:39:53] We'll be standing close. Don't just be
[1:39:56] standing close. Be inside. Get in the
[1:39:59] arkw open now. Right? Because many
[1:40:02] people probably thought, "Oh, I I'll
[1:40:03] just get in at the last minute." But it
[1:40:05] was sealed shut and the water, man, this
[1:40:08] like this water won't stop. And
[1:40:10] eventually they drowned. So don't be
[1:40:12] like them. Don't stand close. Get in.
[1:40:16] Get in while the door's open right
[1:40:18] now. If there will come such a thing,
[1:40:20] we'll be standing close where we can
[1:40:22] get, oh, we get right in. He will open
[1:40:24] the door. But remember, Noah had no way
[1:40:26] of opening it. Just like with the the
[1:40:28] foolish virgins and the wise virgins.
[1:40:30] Some took oil with their vessels, some
[1:40:34] didn't. So don't be like the foolish
[1:40:36] virgins. Many people will come in that
[1:40:38] day and say, "Lord, oh Lord, did we not
[1:40:39] cast out demons? Did we not heal the
[1:40:41] sick?" And he said, "Depart from me."
[1:40:43] And these people were going to church.
[1:40:44] They were praying every day. They was
[1:40:46] reading the word every day, witnessing
[1:40:48] probably um soup suppers, all these
[1:40:50] things. But God said, "I did not know
[1:40:51] you, you workers of iniquity." He they
[1:40:53] never had a personal walk with him. They
[1:40:55] just went to church. That's it. It's
[1:40:57] more than just sitting in a seat. We got
[1:40:59] to get involved. Our life has to be on
[1:41:02] display for God. All right. He opened
[1:41:04] the door. Remember, uh, but don't don't
[1:41:06] you borderline with God. Don't you just
[1:41:08] be a good man. Oh, I like that. Don't
[1:41:10] you borderline with God. Don't just be a
[1:41:12] good man or good woman. You be filled
[1:41:15] with the Holy Ghost, baptized into the
[1:41:18] body by the Holy Ghost. Don't take a
[1:41:20] heresy, nothing about it. Stay there
[1:41:23] until you're dead and your life is new
[1:41:25] in Christ. Says stay there until you're
[1:41:27] dead and your life is new in Christ and
[1:41:30] you're whole. Life is changed. Just
[1:41:34] don't take an emotional sensation. Don't
[1:41:36] that don't do that. That that um stay
[1:41:40] there until something actually happens
[1:41:41] that change you completely. Stay there
[1:41:43] until something actually happens that
[1:41:45] changes you completely. So just in
[1:41:48] closing, let let's make an investment
[1:41:50] tonight. Let let's make an investment
[1:41:53] that will pay off in dividends. It will
[1:41:55] not only pay off here, but it'll pay off
[1:41:57] into the next world to come and and then
[1:41:58] some and then some. So, we got to make
[1:42:01] an investment in our internal
[1:42:02] destination. It's the only thing that's
[1:42:03] going to pay off. It's the only thing
[1:42:05] that's not going to depreciate. Uh I'm
[1:42:07] cool with Roth and IAS. All the things
[1:42:09] are good, but this investment is an
[1:42:11] investment that you you can't miss the
[1:42:13] opportunity. Eternal life is not
[1:42:15] something you want to miss because that
[1:42:17] time of regret, you're gonna be just
[1:42:19] like the rich man in hell lifting your
[1:42:20] eyes up. I don't want to see nobody
[1:42:22] lifting their eyes up in hell. I expect
[1:42:23] to see every one of you
[1:42:25] guys here with me on the other side
[1:42:28] rejoicing. Even on live stream, I expect
[1:42:30] to see you on the other side with me
[1:42:31] rejoicing. And so, no man left behind,
[1:42:34] no woman, no child left behind. All
[1:42:37] right. So, let's just bow our heads in a
[1:42:38] word of prayer.
[1:42:40] Dear gracious Lord, Father, I I didn't
[1:42:44] even get through all my notes, Lord. You
[1:42:45] you you know best, Lord Jesus. And
[1:42:48] Father, I'm just so thankful, Lord, that
[1:42:50] we can serve a mighty God, Lord, who
[1:42:53] you're still in the mercy seat, Lord.
[1:42:55] You're still calling us. You're still
[1:42:57] calling out to others, Lord Jesus,
[1:42:59] drawing men unto you. Father, this
[1:43:01] little word, Lord, that you spoke to us
[1:43:03] tonight, Lord. Let it just find such a
[1:43:06] hide it away in our hearts, Lord Jesus,
[1:43:08] that we may go out, Lord, and and just
[1:43:10] invest more of our time to you, Lord.
[1:43:12] Let us be careful the things that we in
[1:43:15] uh allow into our lives, Lord Jesus.
[1:43:18] Father, we only get one life. We only
[1:43:19] get one chance at this life, Lord. Let
[1:43:21] us not miss this opportunity you're
[1:43:23] giving us, Lord. You're speaking life to
[1:43:25] us right now. You're holding your hands
[1:43:27] out and say, "My child, come to me. I
[1:43:29] have I I have I have something for you.
[1:43:32] And Lord, may we just take that
[1:43:33] opportunity, Lord. Let us not be like
[1:43:35] that that rich man, Lord, who who who
[1:43:37] denied it, who who who just walked away
[1:43:39] from it, Lord. And then he thought,
[1:43:41] Lord, that uh that he could just outlive
[1:43:43] a good life and not have eternal life.
[1:43:46] But Lord, he saw his his demise. He saw
[1:43:48] where he ended up, Lord. Father, let us
[1:43:51] not end up in that same predicament,
[1:43:52] Lord. Father, you've given us an end
[1:43:54] sample, Lord Jesus, to show us that
[1:43:56] that's not the way to go, Lord. Father,
[1:43:59] may we take the away with the Lord's
[1:44:00] despised few, Lord. May May this be the
[1:44:03] night, Lord, that people get filled with
[1:44:05] the Holy Ghost. May this be the night
[1:44:07] where people get rebaptized. May this be
[1:44:08] the night where people get delivered.
[1:44:10] May this be the night, Lord Jesus, that
[1:44:12] we look back at this night and say,
[1:44:13] "Lord, I'm thankful I chose you." Say,
[1:44:16] "Lord, I'm thankful that I listen to
[1:44:18] your call. Thank you for calling me by
[1:44:20] my name." He knows your name. He knows
[1:44:23] the number of head hairs on your head.
[1:44:25] He knows what you like, what you
[1:44:27] dislike. And almighty God, we we we want
[1:44:29] to just live a life engulfed in you,
[1:44:31] Lord Jesus. May you just engulf us,
[1:44:34] Lord. May you take all malice, all envy,
[1:44:36] all strife away. Lord, may you take away
[1:44:39] any imperfection that's inside of us,
[1:44:40] Lord. Send your Holy Ghost tonight,
[1:44:42] Lord, and just purge us, Lord Jesus.
[1:44:44] Just just just purge us a flame, Lord.
[1:44:47] Just set us on fire for you, Lord Jesus.
[1:44:50] And Father, we'll be careful to give you
[1:44:51] all the glory and honor, Lord. May you
[1:44:53] Lord just have have lordship in our
[1:44:56] hearts and our life Lord Jesus. And
[1:44:59] father we thank you for all these things
[1:45:01] in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
