[43:25] Armistice Day uh to Veterans Day and uh
[43:30] with that I just want to read this
[43:31] little statement from uh God's Prophet
[43:34] Amen in honor of our veterans um because

[51:31] to be different it's going to be rest
[51:33] Restoration in
[51:34] completeness amen that when the Lord
[51:37] start a good works he brings it to an
[51:39] expected end yes sir when the Lord
[51:42] restores he restores completely am he
[51:45] restores your family he restores the
[51:48] number one restoration is eternal life
[51:51] what you had before the foundation of
[51:52] the world but because we were born wrong
[51:56] we B it but it's always in US amen and
[51:59] then the time comes that the Lord
[52:00] restore that life am that has no
[52:03] beginning has no end into your heart
[52:05] that's right and when you get that life
[52:07] to begin with every restoration is
[52:09] possible L amen amen so the biggest
[52:12] greatest Resurrection is restore eternal
[52:15] life to the church amen and when I talk
[52:16] about the church don't look at this
[52:18] building look at the people in the
[52:20] building look at Sons and Daughters of
[52:22] God here and outside here amen amen
[52:25] Glory Hallelujah to the Lord and I just
[52:28] want to share a little H just give you a
[52:30] little um report on the Pu Puerto Rico
[52:32] trip we went I think a couple of month
[52:34] ago with um a couple of Brothers brother
[52:37] Jos Abigail Linda brother Quintin Senor
[52:41] brother Mark and brother Jeffrey and it
[52:44] was a wonderful trip H we had brother
[52:47] Mark to minister to the Brethren the
[52:49] Friday that we arrive I think we arrive
[52:51] on Friday right that was probably his
[52:54] first Ministry outside the US it was
[52:56] such a blessing to the Brethren and the
[52:59] brothers asked brother Jeffrey to give a
[53:01] testimony of how he received a message
[53:03] so we had brother Jeffrey for the first
[53:06] time ministering in brother Marco house
[53:08] one of the brother's house and the whole
[53:09] congregation were around and he
[53:11] ministered read a Bible give a testimony
[53:14] of how he came to the message and then
[53:16] ministered the word of the Lord to the
[53:18] people it was a blessing so the the Lord
[53:21] is wonderful sister Abigail gave a song
[53:23] to the church and they enjoyed the song
[53:26] from sister abigil and sistera it was
[53:28] just an awesome time the brothers were
[53:30] happy and they said extend the
[53:32] invitation to every one of you H if you
[53:34] want to go to Puerto Rico they receive
[53:36] you with open
[53:37] arms so the Lord is good so let's come
[53:41] back to a restoration
[53:43] incompleteness like I said brother Jack
[53:45] has just been just gone through so much
[53:47] amen and I just want to just just piggy
[53:50] back from it so with your permission
[53:53] just to take a little from the
[53:54] restoration so I want to go to what is
[53:56] is restoration just go to the
[53:58] fundamentals of
[54:00] restoration when you said restore what
[54:02] does it mean restore is bringing
[54:04] something back to the original position
[54:06] like so here additionally said
[54:09] restoration means the action of
[54:10] returning something to the former owner
[54:12] right let's say oh don't don't worry my
[54:16] computer is used to falling
[54:19] so I will take it when I need it my
[54:21] computer myself they fall like I don't
[54:23] know million times a day
[54:26] myell phone the cameras are all gone
[54:28] because of it falls like 10 times a day
[54:31] thank
[54:33] you God bless
[54:35] you thank you so restoration means
[54:38] action of returning something to the
[54:39] former owner something that you have
[54:41] already let's say I have this book and
[54:43] somehow it got misplaced it got missing
[54:46] and then I look for it I find this book
[54:49] and bring it back I'm the original owner
[54:53] I repossess my book and then place it
[54:55] where it's supposed to be amen and
[54:57] Resurrection is the same thing you
[54:59] belong to the Lord Jesus Christ you were
[55:02] never the devil's
[55:04] property you never belong to the devil
[55:07] but you just got we got missing on this
[55:09] Earth we lost our way who we were am
[55:13] what we meant for this for this day amen
[55:15] but the Lord our father was always
[55:17] looking for us and he knew exactly where
[55:20] we were that's right it didn't matter
[55:22] where where you are Glory it didn't
[55:23] matter where how far you went yes in the
[55:26] in the economy of God you were always in
[55:28] the palms of his hands hallelujah amen
[55:30] you might look at somebody and you say
[55:32] this person is all messed up there's no
[55:35] mercy for him you might not even give
[55:36] him grace and mercy you might write him
[55:39] off you might call him a serpent seed
[55:42] you might call him a vagabond you might
[55:45] just describe him whatever adjective or
[55:46] adverbs that you want to describe but in
[55:49] the economy of God when you see this son
[55:51] of God messed up all of I mean from from
[55:54] head to toe all his or her life God
[55:57] knows him or her as my son my daughter
[56:02] God doesn't see him as a vagabond as a
[56:04] thief as a prostitute as a criminal he
[56:07] sees him as a Son of God because before
[56:10] the foundation of the world Christ Jesus
[56:12] was the lamp of God that was slain
[56:15] before the foundation of the world for
[56:16] that son and daughter of God amen amen
[56:19] and God has already redeemed him is just
[56:22] a matter of time and so Redemption is
[56:25] bringing you back to the or owner the
[56:27] place condition or the original estate
[56:30] amen where you supposed to be right you
[56:32] were meant to be a Son of God a daughter
[56:35] of God and Sons and Daughters of God
[56:37] what did they
[56:38] do if you bring forth a child yes you
[56:41] give him food as a baby giving breast
[56:43] milk right and all too too long you
[56:46] start teaching the the child how to talk
[56:48] all right because human being talk you
[56:50] might teach him English
[56:52] Swahili French Creo whatever language
[56:56] amen that you you speak you teach your
[56:58] your child to speak the same language
[57:00] you even go further to teach him other
[57:02] languages because you want your daughter
[57:04] to no more because you're a human being
[57:06] you teach your son your daughter how to
[57:08] eat how to take care of thems how to
[57:10] wear clothes how to put their shed the
[57:12] socks and things on when they get to S
[57:15] you teach them how to drive because
[57:17] human being you drive so that attribute
[57:19] you impart it to your daughter and your
[57:21] son and the Lord Jesus Christ does the
[57:23] same
[57:24] thing he speak into creation amen he
[57:28] speak out of creation amen he speak
[57:30] blessings healing eternal life into
[57:32] creation amen and he speak diseases
[57:35] sickness sorrow negatives out of
[57:37] creation so the Lord tries you put you
[57:40] in fire put you in Trials to bring the
[57:44] attribute that is already in you how to
[57:47] speak into creation not only speaking
[57:50] but how to think into creation amen
[57:53] there are certain things you don't have
[57:54] to speak you have to pray but you just
[57:57] have to think it from your heart and it
[58:00] comes to your thinking and as you
[58:02] project the thinking it becomes
[58:04] manifestation that is the god that you
[58:07] you that God that you are amen because
[58:10] you are an amateur God on this Earth so
[58:13] restoration is to bring you to the
[58:14] original position as a Son of God and as
[58:18] a daughter of godl and I think when we
[58:20] say Sons and Daughters of God we don't
[58:21] go deep enough we just take it shallowly
[58:25] oh I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of
[58:26] God I'm supposed to live holy to dress
[58:29] good to those are good but that doesn't
[58:32] make you a Son of God a daughter of God
[58:35] is the one that has got the attribute
[58:37] the nature the spirit of Jesus Christ in
[58:41] their heart amen amen so the first
[58:44] restoration if you want to go into
[58:45] scriptures is act chapter 2 verse 38
[58:49] praise God repent amen amen in other
[58:52] words transform all right get away from
[58:56] where you've been lost in your lost
[58:58] estate and come to the original estate
[59:02] amen where God your father meant you to
[59:05] be where Elohim elsh your father and
[59:08] your mother meant you to be to be a Son
[59:10] of God because without the spirit you
[59:13] can manifest certain things but you are
[59:15] still not where you're supposed to be
[59:16] that's right you might have the gift
[59:19] which the Lord give it to you without
[59:20] even
[59:21] repenting but you are not in the image
[59:24] of the Son of God so want to give you
[59:27] his spirit amen by the new birth amen
[59:30] and this hour I want you to go into your
[59:31] heart your heart is going to be the
[59:33] pulpit amen not the wooden wooden wooden
[59:35] uh structure here so put your heart as a
[59:38] Pulpit and ask yourself do I have the
[59:43] Holy Spirit baptism in my
[59:47] heart you have to question yourself and
[59:49] answer to yourself right do I have
[59:53] Christ on the inside of me Hallelujah
[59:56] yeah and if I do have Christ on the
[59:57] inside of me does Christ manifest on the
[1:00:00] inside of me because there's no two ways
[1:00:02] if Christ is on the inside he's going to
[1:00:05] manifest himself on the
[1:00:06] outside there's no way that you have a g
[1:00:10] to produce black hair right and you're
[1:00:12] going to produce gray hair or Grizzly
[1:00:15] hair or what is other other hairs that
[1:00:18] give me some of the hair
[1:00:21] types come in curly curly hair right if
[1:00:24] you don't have curly hair is not going
[1:00:26] to be kellly but if you you have the G
[1:00:28] to have to grow kellly hair you
[1:00:31] definitely going to bring kellly hair if
[1:00:33] you have the Gin to bring bring H all
[1:00:36] the attributes is going to come out of
[1:00:38] you so if Christ is on the inside you
[1:00:41] can't tell me Christ on the inside and
[1:00:43] Christ is not expressed on the outside
[1:00:46] so you have to make Assurance doubly and
[1:00:48] triply sure that Christ Jesus is on the
[1:00:51] inside of me quu amen Christ Jesus is on
[1:00:55] the inside of you amen amen so the first
[1:00:57] thing that Jesus begin to tell the
[1:00:59] people when he came on the day of
[1:01:01] Pentecost that repent amen it wasn't
[1:01:03] Peter speaking it was Jesus Christ
[1:01:05] speaking through the lips of Peter
[1:01:08] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:01:10] the Lord Jesus Christ and you the rest
[1:01:13] is not your part the first part is you
[1:01:15] repenting right seeking get married to
[1:01:18] him in the form of baptism all right
[1:01:20] take away your name amen I'm not taking
[1:01:22] about your Earthly name name is a nature
[1:01:25] do away with your nature and then let
[1:01:27] the nature of Christ take preeminence in
[1:01:30] your life amen that is repentance that
[1:01:33] is restoration and when do you do that
[1:01:36] the rest is going to bring a new life
[1:01:38] Glory that is the life of Jesus Christ
[1:01:40] in you that's right the Heavenly life
[1:01:41] that you had before the foundation of
[1:01:43] the world that you were robbed because
[1:01:45] of the sex birth sex means Satan and if
[1:01:48] cross Satan means sin in nature yeah but
[1:01:51] Christ want to take away the crisis
[1:01:54] because a life without Christ is the
[1:01:56] life full of Crisis Christ want to take
[1:01:58] that crisis out of your life where you
[1:02:00] can't even get along with your own self
[1:02:02] you can't get along even with your pets
[1:02:04] you can't get along with nothing
[1:02:06] nobody you can't hold a job you can't
[1:02:09] keep a marriage you can't keep your
[1:02:11] family you can't keep nothing because
[1:02:13] you can't get along with yourself how
[1:02:15] are you going to get along with others
[1:02:17] all you have a temper like a jet flight
[1:02:20] oh you can't get along so Christ has to
[1:02:23] consume Glory that nature and bring his
[1:02:26] nature in your heart Hallelujah then you
[1:02:28] begin to manifest as a daughter of the
[1:02:30] living Christ that that nature is
[1:02:32] consumed and is no longer in You by the
[1:02:35] nature of Jesus Christ God patience love
[1:02:38] joy Temperance forgiveness faith it just
[1:02:42] come automatically you don't have to
[1:02:45] Crown it you don't have to cram it you
[1:02:46] don't have to stress it out that's right
[1:02:48] but God on the inside manifest himself
[1:02:51] in your Tabernacle glory to the living
[1:02:54] Christ let's go let's go go ahead with
[1:02:56] the
[1:02:58] definitions right that is resoration
[1:03:00] let's go to definition of completeness
[1:03:03] completeness is the state or condition
[1:03:05] of having all the oh let me go
[1:03:08] completeness means as an entirety
[1:03:10] totality right of something the quality
[1:03:13] or state of being without
[1:03:16] restriction no condition can tell you
[1:03:18] not to do that wow because youve got
[1:03:20] Christ on the inside without restriction
[1:03:22] exception and qualification amen the
[1:03:25] world doesn't restrict you Satan doesn't
[1:03:28] qualifies you nothing tells you how much
[1:03:31] you can go in Christ you can go as much
[1:03:34] as Christ will let you go because you
[1:03:36] you are an eagle you don't have

[1:17:35] Resurrection in your family in your own
[1:17:37] life personal life among your family the
[1:17:40] sword of the Lord and of Gideon and I
[1:17:42] want us to read uh I think Judges
[1:17:46] chapter 7 if I'm
[1:17:49] right brother someone can you help
[1:17:52] me praise the Lord hallelujah praise God
[1:17:57] glory to the
[1:17:59] Lord and the midianites and amalekites
[1:18:02] and all the children of the East lay
[1:18:04] along in the valley lay along in the
[1:18:07] valley like grasshoppers for multitude
[1:18:10] and their camels were without number and
[1:18:12] the Sand by as the Sand by the seaside
[1:18:16] for multitude and when Gideon was come
[1:18:19] behold there was a man that told a dream
[1:18:21] unto his fellow and said behold I
[1:18:24] Dreamed A dream and lo a cake of barley
[1:18:27] bread tumbled into the midst of Midian
[1:18:29] and came unto a tent and smote it that
[1:18:32] it fell and overturned it and that the
[1:18:35] tent lay along and his fellow answered
[1:18:37] and said this is nothing else save the
[1:18:40] sword of the Lord sword of Gideon the
[1:18:43] son of joash a man of Israel for his for
[1:18:46] into his hand hath God deliver Midian
[1:18:49] and all the host and it was so when
[1:18:52] Gideon heard the telling of the dream
[1:18:54] and the interpretation thereof that he
[1:18:57] worshiped and returned to the host of
[1:18:59] Israel and said arise for the Lord hath
[1:19:02] delivered into your hand the host of
[1:19:04] Midian and he divided 300 men into three
[1:19:07] companies and he put a trumpet in in
[1:19:10] every man's hand with empty pictures and
[1:19:13] lamps within the pictures and he said
[1:19:16] unto them look on me and do likewise and
[1:19:19] behold when I come to the outside of the
[1:19:22] camp it shall be that as I do so shall
[1:19:25] ye do when I blow with the trumpet I and
[1:19:28] all that are with me then blow ye the
[1:19:31] trumpets also to every side of all the
[1:19:34] camp and say the sword of the Lord and
[1:19:37] of Gideon all right
[1:19:38] amen thank you brother Solomon God bless
[1:19:41] you the sword of the Lord and of Gideon
[1:19:44] sir why the Lord and of Gideon right you
[1:19:48] might say it should be the sword of the
[1:19:49] Lord Gideon doesn't have a sword
[1:19:51] absolutely but the Lord put the sword in
[1:19:54] the heart of Gideon amen let's look at
[1:19:57] Gideon his name all right what is Gideon
[1:20:00] means one who cuts
[1:20:03] down fell and heer of trees great
[1:20:07] warrior oh my God even his name
[1:20:10] testifies of his
[1:20:13] predestination the nature of Christ in
[1:20:15] you testify of who you are so Gideon is
[1:20:18] a fell a heer in the Hebrew words great
[1:20:20] warrior and one who cuts down Gideon
[1:20:23] will tear you down regardless of you are
[1:20:25] that's right and his family name is
[1:20:27] called jobal jbal means Contender with
[1:20:30] with bail or Bal opposer to the rule of
[1:20:33] materialism and so if you put Gideon and
[1:20:36] jobal together destroyer of evil
[1:20:39] anything that is evil that is enemy to
[1:20:42] God if you come in the way of Gideon
[1:20:44] Gideon will consume you and that is who
[1:20:47] you are
[1:20:48] amen regardless of your trial the Lord
[1:20:51] permited trial the Lord allowed in in
[1:20:54] the in the the tri in the way of Gideon
[1:20:56] and before God will restore God has to
[1:20:58] do certain things he has to take fear
[1:21:00] out of
[1:21:01] you because with fear we are not going
[1:21:04] nowhere he has to take division out of
[1:21:07] us because with division we are not
[1:21:09] going nowhere when the church is divided
[1:21:12] there can be
[1:21:13] restoration but when the church comes
[1:21:15] together with one Accord one mind like
[1:21:18] in the D of the upper room when the Lord
[1:21:21] when they were in the basement they had
[1:21:23] divisions among themselves one who said
[1:21:25] Lord in the Kingdom let I think one of
[1:21:27] the parents I forgot the disciples let
[1:21:29] my children be on your right hand side
[1:21:31] and the other disciples were mad how you
[1:21:33] want to be on the right hand side not us
[1:21:35] so they were fighting among themselves
[1:21:38] in fight in a family but God the Lord
[1:21:41] took away all the infight and then took
[1:21:43] away all the fear and brought them to
[1:21:45] the upper room and that's where the Lord
[1:21:48] has pleased you today the infight the
[1:21:51] backbiting rejections but then we come
[1:21:54] to together with one
[1:21:56] Accord one Spirit one heart one baptism
[1:22:00] One Faith one Christ one leadership one
[1:22:03] Bible one everything and then the spirit
[1:22:06] of the Lord will come into manifestation
[1:22:09] Hallelujah so the Lord has to deal with
[1:22:11] Gideon Gideon was a cow just like any
[1:22:14] one of us and if you watch the reading
[1:22:17] he said the multitude remember the word
[1:22:18] I saw like grasshoppers for multitude
[1:22:22] and what at the the the the the
[1:22:24] attribute is a grasshopper the Locust so
[1:22:27] these people were coming the midianites
[1:22:29] and the amales they were the
[1:22:30] grasshoppers that were eating the the
[1:22:32] the the the the bread and the corn and
[1:22:35] the wine that Israel had and what
[1:22:38] grasshopper do you have in your life
[1:22:39] today
[1:22:42] am what locers do you have in your life
[1:22:44] today Hallelujah it might seem so great
[1:22:46] in your mind but if you can just reject
[1:22:49] that mind and look at Christ amen take
[1:22:52] away your fear yes and let the Courage
[1:22:55] the fet of Christ comes into you you've
[1:22:57] already won the battle amen am the sword
[1:23:01] of the Lord and of Gideon amen why the
[1:23:03] Lord and Gideon because God is in Gideon
[1:23:07] manifesting God is God of heaven and his
[1:23:10] son Adam is God of the earth and God
[1:23:13] want you to root the Earth God has made
[1:23:16] you an element God has four element of
[1:23:18] the Earth the fire the Earth the water
[1:23:21] the air but it's a Fifth Element what's
[1:23:24] the Fifth Element is
[1:23:26] eternity eternity controls all the Four
[1:23:29] Element sir without eternity the sea
[1:23:32] will come all the way into the cities
[1:23:34] and drown the houses but there's a
[1:23:36] controller who controls the Four
[1:23:39] Element and he control that the sea you
[1:23:42] can come so far the ocean can come so
[1:23:43] far get back to the ocean amen amen the
[1:23:48] wind can blow so far right stop right
[1:23:50] here hurricanes can come so far right
[1:23:53] but God will said don't go this way I've
[1:23:56] got my angels Around My People in West
[1:23:58] Palm Beach in certain counties and you
[1:24:01] can do so far you can blow so far amen
[1:24:03] amen amen and God will protect his
[1:24:05] people amen so that is the God we serve
[1:24:09] let's read H one
[1:24:11] quotes let's go
[1:24:13] to
[1:24:15] 48304 the angel of the Lord verse
[1:24:18] paragraph two said I know the next thing
[1:24:20] to happen is the resurrection of the
[1:24:22] gift to the church and it's the hardest
[1:24:24] thing I've had to do in this pioneering
[1:24:27] work is to do this as to is to see the
[1:24:29] people that God cannot give back the
[1:24:32] gift to the church as long as his church
[1:24:34] is divided wow wow wow when the when
[1:24:38] there's division the devil breaks and
[1:24:40] Rule and it's a tactic politicians use
[1:24:43] politicians see a certain message to
[1:24:46] breing the people they fight among
[1:24:48] themselves and they sit at the top and
[1:24:49] Ru you that's right and that's where did
[1:24:51] they get from from the Devil and the
[1:24:54] devil use in the church as well the
[1:24:56] devil cannot bring qu bring fraus bring
[1:24:59] chaos and you fight each other and
[1:25:01] you'll be sitting there watching you
[1:25:02] guys fighting each other and he control
[1:25:04] you control your hearts but then if you
[1:25:07] can let God consume that division
[1:25:10] consume the chaos and then he like a
[1:25:12] glue bring us together then there's
[1:25:15] going to be a restoration amen so God
[1:25:18] has to we away the divisions the B
[1:25:20] biting I don't want to deal with this
[1:25:22] brother I don't want to deal with this
[1:25:24] brother I don't want to do deal with
[1:25:25] this sister but you can wrap yourself

[1:25:39] mistake yes as long as we in the flesh
[1:25:41] we're going to have frictions it's just
[1:25:43] normal amen sisters fight among
[1:25:45] themselves Brothers fight among
[1:25:47] themselves but that shouldn't bring
[1:25:48] division amen you should be able to let
[1:25:51] the Holy Spirit deal with your heart and
[1:25:53] let swe it away amen amen and the best
[1:25:56] way is to pray for one another amen you
[1:26:00] can never hit somebody you pray for amen
[1:26:03] you can never rob somebody you love and
[1:26:04] you pray for if you pray for somebody
[1:26:07] you can't hear them but if you don't
[1:26:09] pray for them the devil can put hatred
[1:26:11] because of what your brother or your
[1:26:13] sister did to you that's right when you
[1:26:15] pray the Lord the Holy Spirit the spirit
[1:26:18] of the of the of the of not the E the

[1:48:17] ministers keep touching the subject the
[1:48:20] more the Lord just just begins to open
[1:48:22] up to us and one of the thing that two
[1:48:25] two things brother um quu brought was
[1:48:28] that Celestial and terrestrial component
[1:48:31] and then also he said this three three
[1:48:33] elements of uh restoration for the
[1:48:36] individual restoration for the church
[1:48:40] and then it said restoration of the
[1:48:42] earth uh and all all three of those are
[1:48:45] three different sermons that could be
[1:48:46] preach you know and and we think about
[1:48:48] you know the Earth we know that God is
[1:48:51] promising a new Heaven and a new Earth
[1:48:54] and what the prophet told us is that
[1:48:56] this Earth that we have it's going to be
[1:48:57] the same one it's just going all the sin
[1:49:00] going to be taken off of it and it's
[1:49:02] going back to the original condition
[1:49:04] amen of what Adam and Eve had before the
[1:49:06] fall so uh just just wonderful wonderful
[1:49:09] thoughts that was presented to us and
[1:49:11] you know even as he he talked about the
[1:49:13] sword of the Lord and of Gideon um I was
[1:49:16] reminded uh in my mind of how brother
[1:49:19] Brandon was there in Sabino Canyon I
[1:49:21] believe or uh and he was up there
[1:49:24] praying just asking the Lord what what
[1:49:26] all this man all these visions and
[1:49:28] dreams and Lord what is all this now
[1:49:30] just there praying he has his hands up
[1:49:32] in the air and while he's praying a
[1:49:34] sword dropped down inside of his hand
[1:49:38] praise God Amen and and and and when he
[1:49:40] got the sword in his hand it said uh the
[1:49:43] sword of the king and here you know so
[1:49:46] the the sword that brother brandham he
[1:49:48] said he say I know what the sword of the
[1:49:50] King was he said that's the word of God
[1:49:52] so so when we say the sword of the Lord
[1:49:54] and of Gideon we we take the word and we
[1:49:57] drive Devils Back amen with the word God
[1:50:00] has given us a sword to fight the enemy
[1:50:02] with let's not be afraid to use our
