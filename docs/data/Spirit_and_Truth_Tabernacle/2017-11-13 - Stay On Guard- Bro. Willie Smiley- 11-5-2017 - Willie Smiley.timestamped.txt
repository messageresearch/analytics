[1:04:08] it's hard to turn down your brothers now
[1:04:11] late my brothers in Christ and they my
[1:04:13] brother-in-law's with him and brother
[1:04:14] Jack Carl it's hard to tell them no I

[1:04:20] start crying in here in a minute
[1:04:25] I feel the walls of blurry right now

[1:04:37] and they used to travel to come and get

[1:04:52] and I didn't complain they didn't ask

[1:04:59] that so anytime Jack needs me I'm I'm
[1:05:03] always here for me because one thing I

[1:06:42] unto the Angel of the Church of Ephesus
[1:06:45] write these things saith he that holdeth
[1:06:47] the seven stars in his right hand who
[1:06:51] walketh in the midst of the seven golden
[1:06:53] candlesticks I know that works in our
[1:06:56] labors and our patience and how about
[1:06:58] cannot spare them which are evil and has
[1:07:01] tried them which say they are apostles
[1:07:03] and are not and has found them Elias and
[1:07:06] hath born and has patience and for my
[1:07:09] name's sake has labored and has not
[1:07:12] fainted nevertheless I have somewhat
[1:07:15] against thee because thou hast left thy
[1:07:17] first love remember therefore from
[1:07:19] whence thou art fallen and repent and do
[1:07:22] the first work as I will come to thee
[1:07:25] quickly and will remove thy candlestick
[1:07:27] out of that place except I repent but
[1:07:31] this Dow hash that thou hatest the deeds
[1:07:36] of the Nicolaitans which I also hate he
[1:07:40] that has an ear let him hear what the
[1:07:41] Spirit says to the churches
[1:07:43] to him that overcometh will I give to
[1:07:47] eat of the tree of life which is in the
[1:07:49] midst of the paradise of God let us bow

[1:08:05] the gap and to be able to say something
[1:08:08] to the purchase of the bride and we just
[1:08:13] want to remember brother Jack continue
[1:08:15] keep them protect it and bring them back
[1:08:19] safely and we just think your father
[1:08:22] things in Jesus name Amen amen
[1:08:24] may be seated see also before I get
[1:08:28] started well tell you what young sisters
[1:08:31] I enjoyed that stone I definitely
[1:08:35] enjoyed that I like to break down they
[1:08:38] went in the fall seven just man I think
[1:08:41] I always I always have to mess with my
[1:08:46] nieces and tell them they starting to
[1:08:48] really reach in there and grab who they
[1:08:50] are I won't say what I acts
[1:08:53] say cuz I want nobody to get offended
[1:08:56] sometimes you offend people but I just
[1:09:00] enjoyed that this morning we we want to
[1:09:04] use as a little topic stay on guard stay
[1:09:09] on guard I wanna I wanna try to
[1:09:13] encourage us enlighten us to the hour
[1:09:17] and the age and the time that we're
[1:09:20] living in we're we're in spiritual
[1:09:23] warfare
[1:09:24] we're you know we're in a battle
[1:09:27] spiritually this is this is definitely
[1:09:32] not a relaxing time this is definitely
[1:09:36] not the time for the believers to relax
[1:09:41] is the time to prevail right this that's
[1:09:47] the hour that we're living in what we're
[1:09:50] finding is so many people are letting
[1:09:55] down their guard churches have let down
[1:09:59] the bar let down let down the standard
[1:10:07] really have gotten away from God I'm
[1:10:11] priest this morning now I'm started out
[1:10:13] slow but we're going we gonna break some
[1:10:15] bread this morning we but one of the
[1:10:21] things we don't realize by doing that
[1:10:23] the detriment what has happened to the
[1:10:27] church we don't see by doing so this is
[1:10:34] the reason why the churches in the
[1:10:36] condition that it's in and it and it
[1:10:39] really does not outside of you know
[1:10:43] people see a lot of emotions and
[1:10:45] sensations and people in the building
[1:10:47] but it does not resemble the original
[1:10:51] church that started at Pentecost right
[1:10:55] we got people in buildings we got people
[1:10:59] shouting we got people just like the
[1:11:04] Corinthians Church the
[1:11:06] they you know with a lot of gifts and
[1:11:08] things of that nature but they were
[1:11:10] immature not right but one of the things
[1:11:15] the Prophet makes a statement he talking
[1:11:18] about the feasts in church she said
[1:11:20] there's there's got to be another
[1:11:23] Ephesians to this journey but then he
[1:11:26] says now and it's gonna be important to
[1:11:29] what we want to talk about we're here
[1:11:32] and and you say well brother smiley what
[1:11:36] are you talking about if we understand
[1:11:38] correctly the Ephesians church they were
[1:11:41] a mature church right they were mature
[1:11:46] group of people Paul was able to preach
[1:11:49] things to the Ephesians church that he
[1:11:52] wasn't able to preach to just say the
[1:11:54] Corinthians the Corinthians we find and
[1:11:58] I hate to call us that because we
[1:12:00] shouldn't be that but we still see a
[1:12:03] little bit of the Corinthian
[1:12:04] ACTRA groups kind of lingering around
[1:12:08] that the the supposed to be fullness of
[1:12:13] the world but to me it's I'm not here to
[1:12:18] discuss Chennai's anybody this morning
[1:12:20] but it just shows the lack of maturity
[1:12:23] on the parts of of us and a lot of times
[1:12:28] you know we try to blame the ministers
[1:12:30] in the ministry but a lot of times it's
[1:12:34] just us come on now now y'all inshallah
[1:12:38] keep on shouting a lot of times I think
[1:12:43] it's more it's more of us than it is the
[1:12:47] preaching of the word of God right I
[1:12:50] wanna I want to take my time this
[1:12:52] morning because I want to show us some
[1:12:54] things this morning by the by the grace
[1:12:57] of God the spirit that was in that day
[1:13:02] and and they kind of show us what
[1:13:04] Satan's intent is Satan's Satan has
[1:13:08] always had a motive and an objective
[1:13:11] right and you know I'm grateful for the
[1:13:16] opening of the word because
[1:13:18] it identifies for me things that
[1:13:21] wouldn't initially be identified right
[1:13:25] come on y'all I'm gonna believe that the
[1:13:29] word open see we have got to be able to
[1:13:35] see and see means to understand right
[1:13:41] and and in the book of Revelation it
[1:13:45] says everything a worship the Beast
[1:13:48] whose name is not written in the Lamb's
[1:13:50] Book of Life before the foundation of
[1:13:53] world great small big no matter who you
[1:13:57] are how much money you got much
[1:13:59] education you got no matter who you are
[1:14:01] black white purple green you are once
[1:14:05] you go to worship that beast if your
[1:14:07] name is not written in the Lamb's Book
[1:14:09] of Life before the foundations of the
[1:14:12] world you're gonna do it you're gonna do
[1:14:16] it see and the only reason the elect
[1:14:20] will do it is because they've been
[1:14:22] illuminated is that right but that's the
[1:14:26] only reason why a man we will not
[1:14:31] worship the Beast because we can
[1:14:33] identify the bc's we understand the
[1:14:38] beast right we know where Satan's seat
[1:14:42] is part of it is out of Hollywood right
[1:14:51] you go back to oh it'll come to him in a
[1:14:55] second but so this morning we want to
[1:14:59] try to show us the enemy right the
[1:15:06] message of my concern like that is not
[1:15:08] about a man never has been never will be
[1:15:15] right it's got to be about God the
[1:15:20] thunders the seals all of that is about
[1:15:22] Christ
[1:15:24] right if you cannot see Christ in every
[1:15:29] light of the Scriptures you gotta go
[1:15:31] back because you don't miss something
[1:15:32] and in this hour we don't want to be
[1:15:36] missing anything right come on we do not
[1:15:41] want to be missing anything in this hour
[1:15:44] we want our understanding to be
[1:15:47] illuminated so so that amen we don't
[1:15:51] take the mark right we don't succumb to
[1:15:56] the spirits of this age right we're not
[1:16:01] defeated
[1:16:02] we're supposed to be prevailing people
[1:16:07] right lot of relaxed people we do we
[1:16:11] like to come to church and just kind of
[1:16:13] sit back you know and and no no no if
[1:16:17] you understand this our that should be a
[1:16:20] fervor hmm I can remember you know man
[1:16:26] I'll tell you what retrofire choice on

[1:17:37] God
[1:17:39] we did we get us excited about a loop
[1:17:44] helped us in a new pair you know a new
[1:17:47] car lose something we should ain't man
[1:17:51] be excited about being in the presence
[1:17:53] of God because being in the present
[1:17:56] bottles of leverage that some people
[1:18:00] would love to be Sydney y'all places I'm
[1:18:04] just gonna get out the way for a minutes

[1:18:10] that young man that did that just just
[1:18:15] my brother was just talking about you

[1:18:52] something that will really help us just
[1:18:55] see thee just listen this is a very
[1:19:00] deceitful age right
[1:19:04] this is a very deceitful age I'm going I
[1:19:09] have to say what I believe if it wasn't
[1:19:12] for coming in contact with Malachi for
[1:19:16] taking the book and eating the book I
[1:19:18] would be in trouble come on there's a
[1:19:24] lot of people quitting and walking away
[1:19:26] and giving up but I can only speak for
[1:19:28] myself this is just personal
[1:19:31] your revelation has got to be personal
[1:19:34] right your experience is personal
[1:19:37] because you ain't going to glory on
[1:19:39] brother Jack's experience right sister
[1:19:44] Erica's experience sister Tina sister
[1:19:47] you're not going in or nobody else you
[1:19:49] gotta go in on your own experience
[1:19:52] there's got to be a personal you gotta
[1:19:56] have a personal relationship with Jesus
[1:19:59] Christ
[1:20:00] failed self you're a man got to be for
[1:20:05] you and if nobody else for a man around
[1:20:09] your own yo ro you ain't man it for what
[1:20:13] you believe what you understand what you
[1:20:17] stand for where to go and you just pray
[1:20:25] for your neighbor that gotta cuz it
[1:20:29] takes not to reveal or you don't get it
[1:20:32] right but we want to look at the
[1:20:38] Ephesian age right and and but we want
[1:20:43] to see what restoration has done has
[1:20:48] brought us back to this place but
[1:20:51] there's a there's a fight I believe
[1:20:54] there's a battle and what we do not want
[1:20:58] to do is is succumb to the same spirits
[1:21:02] that overcame them in that age but I got
[1:21:06] a lot of information
[1:21:08] i reaiiy I'm just gonna drop this right
[1:21:11] quick imma keep moving I annoying a baby
[1:21:13] to get to it I was thinking about
[1:21:16] something that I preached years ago
[1:21:17] right about avoid and recapture
[1:21:22] right and I think brother Jack priest
[1:21:25] sitting brother Bradley preached it a
[1:21:27] little bit that's what we do we just we
[1:21:29] don't care preachers we preach what cuz
[1:21:32] it becomes more real to us and she we
[1:21:37] we're supposed to be free now that's
[1:21:41] what I believe how many three people we
[1:21:42] got free in the spirit I'm free
[1:21:46] ain't no change holding me not naturally
[1:21:50] but some folks got spiritual change
[1:21:53] right Amen you know it's something about
[1:21:57] going free if you ever been bound by
[1:22:02] anything by anyone right by mail by
[1:22:09] female or substance or gates or a thing
[1:22:14] of the devil in your mind if you ever go
[1:22:19] free you don't ever want to be a man
[1:22:21] bound up with that again see you you you
[1:22:26] you just run and you keep on running
[1:22:28] while you're running
[1:22:29] why are you running so fast because a
[1:22:33] man I know what it's like to be bound
[1:22:36] see you say what's right why are you
[1:22:39] ready I know what it's like to be bound
[1:22:41] in my mind I know it's like to be bound
[1:22:45] with substance abuse right Kubo
[1:22:50] depression oppression feeling like you
[1:22:55] know you're not gonna love you I'm gonna
[1:22:57] talk to me that this morning right come
[1:23:00] on and it's some people right up in here
[1:23:02] just like that
[1:23:03] because that's why we that's why do
[1:23:06] some of the things that they're doing
[1:23:08] right but because they they become
[1:23:14] captive to something see the objective
[1:23:19] and the intent of God through addiction
[1:23:21] is to make us free see we were we came
[1:23:27] here bound by representation because of
[1:23:31] what
[1:23:33] in the garden right representation by
[1:23:38] predestination now yeah I'm just saying
[1:23:41] y'all got to go find it cuz it's coming
[1:23:45] to me so I ain't got no I know it's in
[1:23:48] here but okay we tweet by representation
[1:23:52] but the blood see you don't have no
[1:23:56] excuse to be found right because
[1:24:02] prevailing power
[1:24:04] Amen is in the work and to prevail is is
[1:24:12] to prove more powerful than opposing
[1:24:16] forces huh but see you could never
[1:24:22] prevail apart from the Holy Ghost in you
[1:24:25] how many believe that without the Holy
[1:24:30] Ghost see you could never have
[1:24:33] prevailing power right you'll never
[1:24:37] overcome in this age see because you'll
[1:24:41] never even understand this age but I
[1:24:44] mean I hate to make this statement but
[1:24:48] I'm kind of inclined to believe a lot of
[1:24:51] people just don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:24:55] right
[1:24:57] because you watch they're under stuff
[1:24:59] just maybe there's some amnesia shop in
[1:25:03] the battle sometimes you you fight so
[1:25:09] long you fight so long until you forget
[1:25:13] that you're shunning god oh god the
[1:25:16] pressures of life the pressures of paint
[1:25:19] sometime you know bringing to a place
[1:25:22] where you forget what God and then done
[1:25:25] for you you forget who you are you
[1:25:29] forget what you once used to believe so
[1:25:37] just maybe we just need to get keep
[1:25:41] people amen in familiar territory
[1:25:46] you know the property talked about the
[1:25:48] young man who went off the war and and
[1:25:51] just was sharp in the battle didn't know
[1:25:54] who he was right and I guess one day
[1:25:58] they was taking him to this facility of
[1:26:00] this place the army and and and you know
[1:26:04] he was on a train and you know he the
[1:26:07] train stopped that he got off and say
[1:26:10] the young man starting started looking
[1:26:12] around coming now this is all about it I
[1:26:18] don't know y'all might have to give me a
[1:26:19] pass well I tell you what this morning
[1:26:21] so the young man started started looking
[1:26:23] around and it's just something about
[1:26:25] being in familiar territory you know it
[1:26:30] starts to bring you back huh and he
[1:26:35] started walking and and one man wanted
[1:26:37] to stop him woman let him go and he just
[1:26:41] kept on walking he found this path kept
[1:26:45] on walking and going and going and going
[1:26:48] till he walked himself home young miss
[1:26:52] there ya see if we let somebody stop us
[1:26:59] will never walk our way back home huh
[1:27:04] and when he when he got there daddy
[1:27:07] daddy was standing there waiting on him
[1:27:09] over the gun huh I believe every day his
[1:27:13] daddy split out on the porch with fake
[1:27:17] that white thing my son is coming back
[1:27:20] home
[1:27:23] I'm gonna come huh standing there and
[1:27:28] the Welcome committee say boy I knew you
[1:27:31] was coming home I think sometimes that's
[1:27:34] that's the way that parents got to do
[1:27:36] you you just stand there knowing no
[1:27:38] matter what they're doing no matter what
[1:27:40] they say no matter what condition are
[1:27:42] they in you'll know that one day they're
[1:27:45] coming back home said right amen
[1:27:52] stay on stay on now look at the
[1:27:57] Ephesians page the very name Ephesus has
[1:28:02] a strange compound mean it means that
[1:28:06] aimed at and relaxed right the high
[1:28:12] aspiration now this is something for me
[1:28:14] I'm quite sure brother Jack I preached
[1:28:16] on these lines but this way I met this
[1:28:18] morning okay it says that the high
[1:28:20] aspirations of this age that begun with
[1:28:25] the fullness of the Spirit right and see
[1:28:29] I believe that we have come back to the
[1:28:34] fools of the Spirit justification made a
[1:28:36] way for sanctification sanctification
[1:28:39] made way for the baptism of the Holy
[1:28:42] Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost made
[1:28:44] a way for the personal price right amen
[1:28:49] I believe that the faeces eight started
[1:28:53] out with all of God for light on the
[1:28:57] world they had a perfect interpretation
[1:29:00] of the word right because because God
[1:29:04] does not change if you look back to
[1:29:07] Genesis I like to look back at because
[1:29:10] that's my mirror that's the picture of
[1:29:13] redemption when I look back to the first
[1:29:17] church in Genesis which was Adam and Eve
[1:29:20] huh Daten they exemplify the first
[1:29:26] church and the first family God's
[1:29:29] perfect wheel right and I believe when
[1:29:32] you look back to Genesis they they had
[1:29:35] the perfect interpretation of the word
[1:29:39] right until a man the spirit of error
[1:29:42] Cain right so I believe that this shucks
[1:29:46] had the depth of God because this is
[1:29:48] what he says the fullness of the Word of
[1:29:51] God though they knew what the will of
[1:29:55] God is
[1:29:56] see and in this age we have the mind of
[1:30:00] Christ right to know what he wants done
[1:30:05] with his word but you first got the Amen
[1:30:10] getting people going again y'all stay
[1:30:13] whipping that y'all stay with me see the
[1:30:17] new birth is so important that's whether
[1:30:21] you know people people think that
[1:30:23] preaching you must be born again is
[1:30:25] beneath you know that's too simply
[1:30:28] simple right but that's one of the most
[1:30:31] important doctrines it is amen to the
[1:30:37] Christian journey because if if you
[1:30:40] cannot get people born again they'll
[1:30:43] never understand amen the message of the
[1:30:48] hours that right come on and see but
[1:30:51] only thing the message every hour that
[1:30:54] does is open the thing that we have up
[1:30:57] to so that we can't understand point us
[1:31:00] back to an original plan and program of
[1:31:03] God it's just that simple right we
[1:31:07] complicated sometimes but it's just that
[1:31:10] simple a ministry to come on the scene
[1:31:15] to show us things that we did not see
[1:31:18] didn't understand and will not
[1:31:21] understand come on y'all gonna look
[1:31:25] right on me but but that's the truth you
[1:31:30] said well why would you say that brother
[1:31:33] smiley because I grew up part that is a
[1:31:36] pop any car
[1:31:37] a little bit of methods a little open
[1:31:40] AME and and I realize now what has been
[1:31:48] revealed to me it's all together on a
[1:31:51] whole nother level
[1:31:54] then what the Bible was presented you
[1:31:58] know we just had a lot of like I was
[1:31:59] messing around with y'all earlier yeah
[1:32:03] yeah but I'm talking about real depth
[1:32:09] real light real understanding right
[1:32:14] something something they take us further
[1:32:17] than Genesis 1 and 1 in the beginning
[1:32:20] right something to take us all the way
[1:32:23] back to the mind of God to show us why
[1:32:28] all of this stuff is what it is because
[1:32:32] of what God had in his mind before let
[1:32:35] there be but see you know back then once
[1:32:44] this Ephesian age my god pray for me so
[1:32:46] I could keep moving
[1:32:47] you know moving up moving further
[1:32:50] because inspiration into striking me and
[1:32:52] I am at home it will probably take me
[1:32:54] two or three services but we'll see how
[1:32:57] we go this morning now we're talking
[1:33:01] about the the Ephesian age right and
[1:33:05] shortest and short us this age but also
[1:33:08] showing us the enemy in the midst of
[1:33:12] this age right because see what a thing
[1:33:16] we gotta keep in mind right Satan from
[1:33:20] from before he was ever kicked out of he
[1:33:24] had an objective right he according to
[1:33:29] the Book of Isaiah he wanted to exalt
[1:33:30] itself right above the stars of God come
[1:33:35] on now
[1:33:37] he see as well as God has had an
[1:33:41] objective Satan has had an objective see
[1:33:46] Satan Satan wanted an Eden of his kind
[1:33:51] he wanted children of his kind
[1:33:55] and he hasn't he has it he has a church
[1:34:04] come on let's get powerful he has a
[1:34:08] church he has a children he has a people
[1:34:12] he has an anointing his false but he has
[1:34:16] one he has an objective part of the kill
[1:34:20] steal and destroy
[1:34:22] huh I'm gonna say I believe it I believe
[1:34:25] that's in the Bible okay I'm gonna just
[1:34:31] drop a lot and y'all go back and get the
[1:34:32] tape but but watch he's talking about he
[1:34:37] said that it was aimed at and then they
[1:34:41] got relaxed right you say why you why
[1:34:45] you want to preached it because I you
[1:34:47] can see the spirit yup every minute I
[1:34:54] try to keep this coat on but I have a
[1:34:58] fan at home and ain't no fan of here
[1:35:01] I can't feel the ones out there it's a
[1:35:05] big machine here but they got relaxed
[1:35:10] and see we gotta be a people that
[1:35:14] prevail right
[1:35:16] like what says this way I started to
[1:35:19] prove more powerful than opposing forces
[1:35:23] to be victorious right victory is mine
[1:35:31] to come out on top right with handing
[1:35:35] out the tail right to succeed that's
[1:35:40] every aspect naturally and spiritually
[1:35:44] right it should bother you to feel like
[1:35:48] you know and I
[1:35:50] may not come to the height says but you
[1:35:55] should never limit yourself huh hello
[1:35:59] we should never limit ourselves
[1:36:02] naturally and spiritually spiritually
[1:36:07] there is no limits huh we just got to
[1:36:14] get beyond the barriers see once we get
[1:36:18] through all of them you know like the
[1:36:20] plane then it gets unlimited and see
[1:36:23] that's what we we trying to forget the
[1:36:26] church right and it's a fight like we
[1:36:30] said it's hard to manage people it's
[1:36:33] hard to get people to get in one accord
[1:36:37] and one man with you right to halt to
[1:36:40] your vision but see we never get the
[1:36:44] church beyond you know all the you know
[1:36:47] as the plane is going up then once you
[1:36:50] get to a certain altitude is unlimited
[1:36:53] see that's waiting limit we're limited
[1:36:58] because we have not gotten ourselves and
[1:37:02] then into our ought to be place but once
[1:37:06] we get there trust we're really
[1:37:10] beginning to see something see then
[1:37:13] we're not subject to teach see taste
[1:37:15] hear smell and things of that nature
[1:37:18] right we tweet like the Bible said it
[1:37:22] just shall live by faith right
[1:37:25] see sometimes you know you watch brother
[1:37:28] wesco right a perfect an example brother
[1:37:31] why still don't live by the elements of
[1:37:34] this this life and what people say well
[1:37:39] you can't do this and you can't do that
[1:37:41] you can't do this you can't go here you
[1:37:43] can't go there cuz like what's stopping
[1:37:45] me a pleasure now come on
[1:37:48] Kimmo you can't what's happening wait
[1:37:55] I'm in control I'm I'm on top what what
[1:38:08] devil what demon can stand before me
[1:38:11] don't worry that what he told Joshua he
[1:38:15] say nothing yes whatever you do don't
[1:38:20] look to the left or the right stay down
[1:38:21] the middle of the road and nothing will
[1:38:24] be able to stand before you network no
[1:38:28] cancer no devil no no no criticism no
[1:38:32] Matt would be able to stand before you
[1:38:35] I'll be with you huh hey man it's the
[1:38:41] rule to reign prevail over emotions why
[1:38:46] no that's a deep one right there that's
[1:38:49] a real that's a real deep one because
[1:38:53] the enemy fight us in our human spirit
[1:38:56] and I ni emotions I think that's one of
[1:39:01] the biggies why we can't grasp the the
[1:39:05] word of the hour because we're too
[1:39:08] emotional and we try to figure out how
[1:39:11] could this great loving God condemn
[1:39:14] these people over here you see it all
[1:39:18] the way through the Bible that's how I
[1:39:20] know you can do it look at what he did
[1:39:22] in the days of Noah right he said he
[1:39:27] sent the man with the revealed word for
[1:39:30] the date build up build an ark and call
[1:39:36] the people to the ark right a one man
[1:39:41] ministry right no it was the judgment
[1:39:46] power
[1:39:48] right amen the people I got is such a
[1:39:52] condition that God had come down but
[1:39:55] watch the righteousness of God look at
[1:39:59] the righteousness of God
[1:40:00] see Amen God God desired for all men to
[1:40:05] be saved but God knows that everybody
[1:40:07] ain't gonna be saying because
[1:40:09] everybody's not gonna get in but God is
[1:40:13] gonna give you a chance he's gonna give
[1:40:15] you an opportunity right building up
[1:40:19] tell the people look at that new light
[1:40:21] it's gonna rain that was too simple that
[1:40:28] couldn't comprehend it hina watch see
[1:40:32] you hate God God has got to reveal
[1:40:35] himself to you it's gonna rain we'd
[1:40:40] never seen rain
[1:40:42] it's because you've never seen it don't
[1:40:45] mean it's not gonna happen
[1:40:47] God said it's gonna rain if God's added
[1:40:53] that Scelzi
[1:40:55] right God is more than able to produce
[1:40:58] it if he's saying no amen I'm coming
[1:41:04] down in judgment but I'm gonna give
[1:41:06] opportunity I'm Sayla my fall we're
[1:41:11] right at the crust of judgment we better
[1:41:16] get in while we got a chance right come
[1:41:19] on come on what would we we we we we
[1:41:26] sciences we strong people we man we
[1:41:29] never seen let it come from down there
[1:41:31] we can shoot footage to the moon and
[1:41:33] prove ain't no rain up there it's been
[1:41:37] this certain way for you know all of
[1:41:40] this time right ain't man
[1:41:45] what that got to do with the God said
[1:41:47] it's gonna rain is gonna rain see that
[1:41:50] evidence that it was gonna rain was one

[1:42:19] boatbuilders in that day but they were
[1:42:24] not a man constructing something that
[1:42:28] will be able to withstand the judgment

[1:42:36] revelation came to Moses build an ark

[1:43:07] chaotic but you know one thing I like

[1:46:56] of education that he had right how could
[1:47:02] you you know how could I think about
[1:47:05] this thing though you know I ponder
[1:47:07] these things sometimes you know a man
[1:47:10] with with 7th grade education that's no
[1:47:13] way picking up this Bible and being able
[1:47:18] to grasp who he is his name those angels
[1:47:25] and all of the things that he presented
[1:47:27] it took more than a man to reveal it to
[1:47:30] him to prove how real how real his
[1:47:38] ministry right just how real it how
[1:47:44] scriptural that's like a priest groups
[1:47:46] messages this day description is 4 feet
[1:47:51] [Music]
[1:47:53] huh champ trench to show us the
[1:47:57] fulfillment of Scripture right trying to
[1:48:02] bring us out of the glare of another day
[1:48:05] into the marvelous life of Jesus Christ
[1:48:08] but I I would that we live in here
[1:48:12] trying to bring us out amen of judgment
[1:48:17] because you know the Bible says all
[1:48:21] cages right it's full of vomit come on
[1:48:28] he said become the cage of every
[1:48:32] cleaning hateful and unclean bird what
[1:48:37] what what is that pointing back to and
[1:48:39] you'd hate to say this this Mike I hope
[1:48:41] this don't hurt about a feeling but I'm
[1:48:42] a priest you look back through
[1:48:45] denominationalism now we're not dealing
[1:48:49] with so much with people but you look at
[1:48:52] the system the system you gotta say it
[1:48:58] like he see it right it's what was he
[1:49:02] always against this stuff right see even
[1:49:09] even in description we read it sister
[1:49:13] the start the system of things that the
[1:49:17] original church hated the spirit the
[1:49:20] system of thing that were contrary to
[1:49:23] the original to the depth of God see
[1:49:28] this while the Apostle Paul come on the
[1:49:30] scene dealing with the glacier stretch
[1:49:33] and say listen if you don't listen
[1:49:36] how quickly are are y'all remove from
[1:49:41] the original gospel the original word
[1:49:45] right to another gospel inspiration man
[1:49:52] it hasn't changed
[1:49:54] seducing clergy spirits to try to take
[1:49:58] you back into Judaism right take you
[1:50:05] back into amen something that did not
[1:50:09] possess the ability to make you fully
[1:50:11] free see under the law the law could
[1:50:17] only you know devil's a covering but
[1:50:21] it's a I'm the Calvary it's a total
[1:50:24] release
[1:50:27] it's a fall Jubilee that's why I'm crazy
[1:50:32] like I am today
[1:50:34] cuz I'm free see I heard I heard and see
[1:50:39] we just got to keep blowing the trumpet
[1:50:42] right and hopefully people to hear the
[1:50:46] gospel trumpet and come out come out
[1:50:50] come out of the world but also come out
[1:50:52] of of religion huh come out of
[1:50:58] denominationalism back to the Bible back
[1:51:02] to the word right how much time I got I
[1:51:06] don't know I got it I'm gonna preach a
[1:51:09] little why I gotta go I gotta have
[1:51:10] communion at home so but y'all alright
[1:51:13] wait lemme see
[1:51:16] alright blame it on brother Jean for not
[1:51:19] showing up glory to God amen your
[1:51:28] emotions of failure cuz in our emotions
[1:51:31] you know one day we are on the
[1:51:33] mountaintop and the next day you know
[1:51:35] you can't base it on that but the
[1:51:37] official a setting is aimed at and they
[1:51:39] relax this is the high aspiration of
[1:51:42] this age that had begun with the
[1:51:43] fullness of the Spirit the depth of God
[1:51:46] whereby they were aimed at the high
[1:51:48] calling of God right amen he says began
[1:51:53] to give way to unless this is an
[1:51:57] important statement write a less
[1:52:01] watchful attitude right it's almost like
[1:52:06] you know when you first become a
[1:52:08] Christian anything the man of God say
[1:52:10] you write on it pastor said it you know
[1:52:14] what the pastor say you you know you
[1:52:17] know how it is we raise the children and
[1:52:19] you know you always get that that
[1:52:21] honoring child and maybe you get that
[1:52:24] good child in that honor each time you
[1:52:27] know and and one meal huh you know you
[1:52:30] know what mama said please come over
[1:52:32] here
[1:52:33] alright you know my oldest sister was
[1:52:35] that one I was the good child
[1:52:38] oh boy couple here could you stay oh boy
[1:52:46] but you stay it put a little pressure on
[1:52:49] me you know sister got more heart than
[1:52:51] you boy you know do have me all out
[1:52:56] there - lord help us people people you
[1:53:04] you you're on fire right when we tell
[1:53:10] you Erica's some of the old ones was
[1:53:13] time Ewing Shonda and who wasn't
[1:53:16] Vernon Jimmy means Oh fire whatever you
[1:53:21] know we feared going into office brother
[1:53:26] let's go calling you
[1:53:28] not one we are it one did something we
[1:53:31] all got in trouble it was a body thing I
[1:53:36] want to see all the young people after
[1:53:38] church
[1:53:39] don't nobody leave and that was always
[1:53:43] hard for me because I was a little bit
[1:53:45] older than them I you know I'm gonna got
[1:53:46] a few years older there so it's hard for
[1:53:49] me to humble myself to a man you know it
[1:53:53] was because because I was about 25 then
[1:53:56] and I'm like man I grew up I have no dad
[1:53:58] I my old daddy who did not help me
[1:54:06] that was hard we would see like always
[1:54:09] in the sub but I humbled myself because
[1:54:12] he was demand of God you don't wanted to
[1:54:15] think one of the things I learned one of
[1:54:19] the things I learned I'm gonna just say
[1:54:20] this you know and it's a good one for
[1:54:22] young ministers because I think the
[1:54:24] young preachers in this day got a little
[1:54:26] take over spirit feel like you know
[1:54:31] sometime they know more right you don't
[1:54:37] know no more I watch them I listen to
[1:54:40] them I watched the accident and that's
[1:54:42] an indication to me you know very little
[1:54:45] [Music]
[1:54:48] but one of the things I learned I
[1:54:51] learned to trust God in the midst of
[1:54:55] headship
[1:54:57] so the brows i'ma tell you now we went
[1:55:00] from Bosco the brother James before I
[1:55:03] started pastoring one thing both of them
[1:55:05] rice is the brown over the High Line
[1:55:08] y'all rice is the brown come on that oak
[1:55:11] widow be right what one of the things I
[1:55:14] learned as a young preacher I trusted
[1:55:18] God with the man with the church I
[1:55:25] trusted God's leadership right amen I
[1:55:31] you know as I saw it the same way I
[1:55:34] didn't see it the same way a greeter
[1:55:36] same way I trusted God with his church
[1:55:42] then if anything is good is going wrong
[1:55:46] God will straighten it out somehow some
[1:55:50] way but I'm not going to put my opinion
[1:55:56] in my hand on it right I'm gonna leave
[1:56:00] it to God I will find out what I
[1:56:03] supposed to be doing my part my position
[1:56:07] my place in the body but I'm not gonna
[1:56:11] touch the man of God huh Bible said just
[1:56:18] that my anointed do my propers no heart
[1:56:20] it's not like the story in the Bible you
[1:56:23] know with King David this fella state
[1:56:25] and he you know he kind of you know come
[1:56:30] comes and like you know we're solid into
[1:56:33] David right man I tell you what what
[1:56:37] it was a hot heavy battle right then you
[1:56:39] know song I pulled it in this is an oven
[1:56:42] and in the man of god is dead
[1:56:45] huh what happened you know it got like
[1:56:52] this in his eyes and I took it that if I
[1:57:06] wanted to take if I wanted him out I
[1:57:09] could have took your knife several
[1:57:11] occasions I called him I called him in

[1:59:39] Bobby Holy Ghost people gonna find a
[1:59:44] getting that going I'm telling you I'm
[1:59:47] telling this just a warning this whole
[1:59:48] message is about a warning people don't
[1:59:51] get themselves in a whole lot of trouble
[1:59:53] right because of their lack of
[1:59:56] understanding a man of leadership
[2:00:00] come look at the days of Moses you ain't
[2:00:05] the only holy one in the ears of the
[2:00:07] buck see the attitude spirits don't die
[2:00:11] the fierce don't die
[2:00:13] you see spirits everywhere like still
[2:00:15] just as alive and well right ain't only
[2:00:20] holy but one in the bunch
[2:00:24] right some of y'all went here I'm gonna
[2:00:28] say we got this little thing going
[2:00:30] around you know I had you know I wasn't
[2:00:33] pretty and somebody called me this
[2:00:35] little more Millennials you blue
[2:00:38] Millennials better humping ourselves you
[2:00:44] say why you say that's about my smile
[2:00:46] let's eat because I realized something
[2:00:48] I'm gonna get to the point is the spirit
[2:00:51] of it is a spirit of division
[2:00:55] if the speed of the you see people be
[2:00:58] talking and all of you like see see they
[2:01:01] just forget to me they don't be
[2:01:03] understanding
[2:01:04] they'll be really used by the devil when
[2:01:10] you step up and you start
[2:01:11] wellwe've Millennials we this and with
[2:01:14] that and and we have not gone on this
[2:01:16] that's a rebellious spirit it's the
[2:01:20] spirit of division you can't listen
[2:01:24] Church you cannot work with a group of
[2:01:27] people like that see it would defeat my
[2:01:33] purpose as a shepherd to divide our
[2:01:36] church to come in and say well we got
[2:01:38] the baby boomers and we got to the
[2:01:40] Millennials and div but death what about
[2:01:42] the generation after the Millennials cuz
[2:01:44] there's another generation see this do
[2:01:48] what about them they chopped liver you
[2:01:53] see
[2:01:53] come on let go go such a history pull up
[2:01:57] Millennials and and the definition of
[2:02:01] the show you is smart to come see but
[2:02:05] when those little spirits drop it's a
[2:02:09] spirit a man of division it's the spirit
[2:02:12] of medallion of leadership that's the
[2:02:18] right way the wrong way to do things
[2:02:19] social media I was just gonna preach
[2:02:22] this morning i'ma going on home I'll see

[2:08:13] the flow well boy I tell you what that

[2:08:20] attitude so we miss God and simplicity

[2:08:30] Word of God to be preached in order for
[2:08:32] people to get well I know your mind cuz
[2:08:35] I don't want your mind to be blown I

[2:08:51] understand up you know what I'm finna go
[2:08:53] I pray this morning that you know I said
[2:08:58] some things that that kind of helped us
[2:09:03] it may be more seasoned folks here non

[2:09:26] have preached this and not been all over
[2:09:28] the place but when I go out and be so
[2:09:30] many things moving around in the spirit
[2:09:33] and the spirit and God said hit it boom
[2:09:39] hit that to hit this - he said why is he
[2:09:44] doing that because God is concerned
[2:09:46] about you God is concerned about folk
[2:09:50] being saved God is concerned about being
[2:09:53] people being delivered God is concerned
[2:09:56] about people prevailing over things
[2:09:59] right come on come on God God wants us
[2:10:04] to be on guard right to be watchful not
